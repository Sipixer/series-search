Brooklyn. She's a baby, not a city. What do you think, Bud? Got any suggestions? Toadette. I'm hungry. I'll get you guys something to eat. You're okay. I was paged? What are you doing here? Can we talk somewhere? I was thinking Doroth... Sarah? Where's the baby? No one saw anyone go in or out, and the baby's not in the nursery. - What was her condition? - Five weeks preterm. C-section because her mom's preeclampsia. Is that the father? Mr. Lozinski. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of Medicine. How long were you out of the room? 15, 20 minutes tops. - Was there a proximity alarm? - No alarms. What's that? The bracelet on your baby's ankle has a microchip that would set off alarms if she was carried through an exit. Call the police. Shut down all the exits. We are on lockdown. Nobody moves until we find that baby. .:: La Fabrique ::. R[H]Ã©sus AB+ Team Arrow - Benj - ShalimarFox Why won't you sign the divorce papers? It's been on my to-do list. Sorry. Will you sign them? Not until we have a real conversation about our marriage. I made a mistake coming here. I'm sorry. I'm gonna leave... this copy here. Code seven. Code seven.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.</i> And did anyone other than your nurses ever come by asking about your daughter? No, just those two. - I'll check in soon. - Wait. - What are you doing? - No, I need to help them look. You have to stay in bed. You pulled a stitch. Lay back down. I got it. Why don't I give you something to help you relax? I don't want to relax. I want to find my baby. - The police are searching room by room. - Who would take her? - What if she needs to be fed? - We're gonna find her. Why aren't the police talking to our nurse? What now? - Truth or dare? - You don't want to mess with me. True or dare queen at Newton north. I was kidding. We can find something interesting without relying on some juvenile game. Sure. Truth. They think I took the kid? - Do you think I would do something... - No, I'm just asking questions. The day I let the older brother hold the baby for the first time... so I put her in his lap. After a few seconds, she shrieked. I'm pretty sure he pinched her. I need to know this stuff. Anything out of the ordinary. It was sibling rivalry. I thought it was kind of ordinary. - What are you doing down here? - I was looking for McKenna's file. You mean this file? - The one I said I'd get? - Two hours ago? Seriously, you don't trust me with the immense responsibility of fetching a file? - Why are you looking through those? - Do you know what these are? The staff credentials files. - Those should all be in H.R. - Down here to be digitized. And we're locked in, and whoever's supposed to be watching 'em is locked out. We could look up anything on anyone. - Malpractice records, felony histories. - Put them away. Come on. We have a tiny window of opportunity to gain some insight into our colleagues. What if we just snoop on the boss? I think I can live with that. You're on two milligrams of morphine an hour. How the hell are you still awake? No, don't tell me. Ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the blood's not reaching your gut, you have intestinal hypoperfusion. That'd be stronger than the narcotics. The nurse said I might only have a day or two left. She was being kind. You're Dr. House, aren't you? Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date. The limp. I read about you. I sent you a letter before they knew what was wrong. I tried to get you to take my case. You should have kept reading. Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade. It started as tooth pain. No one got it that it was a heart problem. Till I had a series of massive heart attack... This doesn't bother you? You talking with your mouth full? A little. I meant the fact that you're standing here watching me die because my file bored you. I take maybe 1 in 20 cases. A lot of the people I turn down end up dying. It's really a good argument for there being more than one me when you think about it. - Truth. - All right. Have you ever had a threesome? - You haven't? - Wait, just because I'm bisexual? Do you understand what bisexual means? It doesn't mean you have sex with two people at once. And by the way, you didn't ask me if I'd had a foursome. Truth or dare? - You've had a foursome? - Now you've asked me two questions, so I get to ask you two. You see why I was the queen. Walker wouldn't do anything. He's my son too. I don't mean to sound cold, but he's your stepson. We can't ignore any possibility. Walker's been getting in fights a lot at school lately. Last week, he hit another kid with a book hard enough to draw blood. If he did something to the baby... We were working on it. - And we failed. - No, you had a conversation with House, then came back, informed me I'd been forever poisoned by him, and started packing. It's interesting how you leave out the part where you murdered another human being. A dictator who was committing genocide. You thought about doing it yourself. - But I didn't. - Right. Because you're not toxic like I am. What do you think is gonna happen here? You're gonna logic me into coming back? There must be over 30 malpractice settlements in here. He did a brain biopsy without CT mapping, causing brain herniation and death. Look at this one. Patient lost four liters of blood from a botched penisectomy. On a patient named Lisa Cuddy? Damn. They're all named Lisa Cuddy. He's not even here, and he's screwing with us. Where's the joy in that? You really want to get into his head? Yeah, but I decided against stabbing myself in the leg or getting addicted to pain pills. You can... skip the stabbing. - Where did you... - Confiscated them from a drug seeker. Didn't get a chance to turn 'em in. It is after hours. I'll take one. Walk in House's shoes for a night. One? I believe he wears a larger size. No cards, no flowers, not even a phone call. Let me guess. Lighthouse keeper. I was a classics Professor at Princeton for 26 years. Mostly research. So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago. That must be it. Not that you have no friends because, say, you're a miserable bastard. What do you care? The next few hours are gonna be grim. There'll be nausea, pain, no company, as soon as I can get myself out of here. I can unlock the regulator. You can put yourself in a narcotic haze, sleep blissfully to the end. Is that a favor to me or to you? Win-win. No, thanks. Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case? You think a classicist doesn't believe in fate? You think Odysseus would lie whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed? Come on, take my offer. Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out. I think you're the one who wants to numb himself out. Truth. How did your dad react when you came out to him? He made me tea. Doesn't matter what I tell him, he smiles, tells me he supports me, and makes me some peppermint tea. - Truth or dare? - Truth. Are you dating anyone? Now? No. Interesting, you added a modifier. Truth. When you were dating Foreman... If it was something personal about him or us, I don't think that's right to answer. We work together. That's the point! Something personal, embarrassing. - Pick something else. - You see, this is your problem. You act like you're so liberal and open, but you are the least... I changed my mind. Dare. Just no nudity. Yes, nudity. I want you to show your breasts to Taub. That is the most idiotic dare ever! Have you ever played this game? I thought showing me your breasts would be a little exploitative. Your dare is in the future, genius. If you're saying you won't do it... Of course I'll show my breasts to Taub. Tomorrow, perhaps, or maybe some time next year, you know, because I'm honor-bound. Truth or dare? It's understandable that you wouldn't be happy right now. Your world is changing. You scared? How do you feel about your sister? I hate her. Walker, this is important. Did you do anything to the baby? Did you move her somewhere? Hide her? - Nobody'd be mad at you. - I said no, so stop asking me. Bad pain day? Bad pain month. Since I'm not using it... If you don't want the morphine, you must have something of your own. I was in rehab. I had a little problem with the something of my own. Now all I take is ibuprofen, and it's two flights up. - For the whole month? - The pain's migrated. I think the arterial wall is damaged. - What, you don't know? - I haven't had an arteriogram yet. And you don't want the test. In case the arterial wall is fine. Which would mean that the pain is coming from something else. What's her name? Interesting... That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love. You're projecting. So what's her name? - What time is it? - What does it matter to you? It's T minus four hours. 8:20. Now tell me who she is and what are the pathetically long odds that she's gonna visit or call. And why that's a reason not to take the morphine. Dude. Dude. Is the room still spinning? Mine is. Maybe we shouldn't have taken so many. I'm gonna try to stand up. You be careful. That's working. I can't feel my face. No way. Way. Hit me. What? Hit me in the face. Seriously? You know you've always wanted to. - Now's your chance. - That's a great idea. We start a fight club. Maybe we... Oh, my God! That is so cool! I can still feel my hand. - I wasn't ready. - What were you gonna do? Flex your goatee muscles? Wait a minute. This is your credentials file? Give me that. That's why you came down here. Not for the patient file. You wanted... You wanted... I will answer whatever questions you want. But then you sign the papers. Did you ever love me? How can you even ask that? The first time you slept with me was because you were high. I was on the drugs because I was emotional. The emotions led to the sex, not the drugs. Not true. After that, you refused to let it go further. Because I knew I was falling for you and I didn't want to. And that never changed. You broke off our vacation because I bought you a ring. I got cold feet. I'm not proud. You almost called off our wedding because you couldn't give up the idea - of having your dead husband's baby. - Don't bring him up! Because even then, you weren't sure about me. Maybe if I was dying, - it would've been different. - That's unfair. It's exactly the point! He was dying when you met him, and gone just a year into the marriage. So it was all a honeymoon with him, and I could never match up to that. - The first time reality intruded... - Stop this. - Tell me the truth. - About what? - Did you ever love me? - I don't know! Thank you for finally telling me. Truth. You said you weren't dating anyone now. Does that mean you recently were, or soon will be? Look who's guarded now. You had no problem talking about your sex life, but your love life... Fine. Dare it is. No nudity now or in the future. You're too much of a nice boy, Wilson. Let's let the bad boy out for a bit. You have to go steal one dollar right now. From who? Come on. Interned at Hopkins. Old news. Here we go! Academic probation. I am asking you to please stop reading. I'm afraid I can't do that. Faked a lab result. Very wrong! And you came down to destroy the record before it gets digitized. Permanentized. Even wronger. I needed to beat all those elite, spoiled kids around me. To show no weaknesses, to win at everything. Why'd I just tell you that? I always talk too much when I'm stoned. Why'd I just tell you that? It was stupid. You had great grades. One lab result shouldn't have mattered. Except I didn't think I deserved to be at a top med school in the first place. Again. Faking lab results is one thing. But you needing to come down here to destroy the records 12 years after the fact... This isn't about med school. You don't think you belong here. At the hospital. Dr. Taub, Christopher Michael. So this is what it comes down to in the final hours. Deifying some lost love. Hoping to get her on the phone and make everything perfect. It's pathetic. Either you left her for a reason or she left you for a reason. - A phone call is not... - It's my daughter. Why isn't she here? I left my family... When Gracie was six. I was sort of... forced out, actually. After I'd had an affair with a student. For sex or love? Neither. I'd only married Gracie's mother because of the baby. But I didn't think I could handle commitment, and, like any decent academic, I proved myself right. And what time it is matters because? She's a dance teacher in Atlanta. She gets home from work at 9:00, and I just wanted to speak to her one more time. That's my story. What's yours? Same thing, pretty much. I'm gonna be dead in a few hours. Your secrets couldn't be safer. Unless you're keeping them from yourself. I like being alone. At least I convince myself that I'm better off that way. And then I met someone at a psychiatric hospital, of all places. She changed me. And then she left. We're better off alone. We suffer alone, we die alone. Doesn't matter if you're a model husband or father of the year. Tomorrow will be the same for you. But yesterday would have been different. Could you cook me up a chicken sandwich? Grill's closed. It's important medically. Dr. Hadley needs a high-protein meal right now. She doesn't like to talk about it, but she has hypoproteinemia. - We got chicken salad. - Yeah. That's cold. She needs to eat warm protein for this disease? Well, we could give her cold protein whose uptake enzymes haven't been activated, as long as you don't mind her risking liver and kidney failure and eventual death. But, it's worth it so you don't have to flip on the grill. You don't have to be obnoxious about it. How do you look... so okay? I spent months wondering how I made it go bad. If you never loved me, then... Then I didn't do anything wrong. Allison, come on. It's all right. I still don't know why I said that. It's not even true. I did love you. Just... Not in a way that would have ever worked. - Why not? - Because... everything you said is true. I'm a mess. I married a man I knew was dying. So God knows how screwed up I already was. Him dying messed me up even more. I pushed you out of my life. And... I'm unfixable. Not you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Truth. Shut up. I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - No, I didn't even play fair. You asked me how my dad reacted when I told him I was bisexual. And the Huntington's. - No tea party? - I never told him. He's been through enough. So he just visits his heterosexual, healthy daughter, and you go out to dinner and a movie - and talk about your garden? - I work late. He's staying at my house. It's easier if I stay elsewhere as much as I can. You can't suppress your life for his convenience. You don't see a little irony in that? That's exactly what you do for House. When he moved in with you, you bought a bigger place for him. No wonder you're not dating anyone. You're right. That woman, the woman I'm not involved with, her name is Sam Carr. But in 1990 and 1991, it was Sam Wilson. Your ex-wife? No, my mother. Yes, my ex-wife. Ex number one. She friended me a few weeks ago. We started emailing. It turns out she's recently divorced, and I wanted to ask her out. You can't take a woman to dinner, or else House will go running straight back to the loony bin? You're not worried about House but about yourself. Because she's an ex. So even dinner will mean it's immediately serious. What are your favorite parts that you remember? I liked how... I would wake up in the middle of the night, you'd put your arm around me, and you wouldn't even wake up. I liked watching you stand up to your dad at Christmas when he yelled at your mom. How you didn't even know you were strong. But you were. What do you miss? I miss a lot. But when I think about missing you, I think about that dance class that we took for the wedding. It's weird. I think, he's never gonna hold me like that again. I'm gonna miss this too. Published in The New England Journal at 26? Finished all the lab work a year earlier. Led a group of surgeons to fix cleft palates in Bangladesh? What can I say? That concert was very moving to me. I have to take a knee. I don't get it. This has got to be the most spectacular file down here. Why are you pretending to be ashamed? I would trade mine for yours in a second. When I was in med school, I thought I'd be House some day. Instead, I am a fellow working with... working for people years younger than me. So... we both have a few regrets. You should be proud of yours. Your life's been trending up. No news. How you holding up? You let them sedate you? - Do you have kids? - A little girl. I adopted her last year. I adopted Walker right after Donald and I got married. What if I can never love Walker the way I love my daughter? Does that make me a horrible person? Let me get you some tissues. Did you request some extra towels? What, why? There are eight towels in Sarah's room. - There should only be four. - House keeping handles towels. I need you to track down their logs, figure out who was up there and when. - Because they got extra towels? - Just find the logs. Now. - Adrienne, you okay? - Sure. What's wrong? Adrienne, give me your arm. The hair on her left arm is standing up. Asymmetric neurological function. She's having a pilomotor seizure. - She seemed fine a minute ago. - She was. She's probably been having complex seizures all day. She would be basically functional, but more or less acting on autopilot. She probably dropped the towels off twice. She could have taken the baby. We never really did have a proper good-bye. It's 9:00. It's Gracie. I can't come to the phone, so please leave a message.</i> I guess she's running late. You don't seem that surprised. That's what you expected to get. You waited until you knew she'd be out. Her aunt... said that she starts work late. Every now and then, I just call to hear her voice on the machine. I was never there when she needed me, so... What right do I have to need her now? None. Just means you're a hypocrite. 'Cause apparently you do. Forget about rights. Just tell her what you need to tell her. It's Gracie. I can't come to the phone, so please leave a message.</i> This is... your father. I love you. Anything? We've covered every room on Maldonado's logs. Been everywhere she's been. Where's the other cart? Isn't there usually another cart in here? Anyone in there? Lockdown's over.</i> I should go. I just asked Sam to dinner. Little baby's all growed up. You gonna tell your dad? I'll stop by his hotel, talk to him. Hotel? You said he was staying at your apartment. Was there any truth in anything you said? The part about it being a good idea for you to call Sam. That was true. Good night. Code seven has been lifted. Repeat, code seven... You want your file? Good for you. We don't have to tell anybody what we... - You got the patient file? - I'll grab it. Thanks. See you tomorrow. I think I'm ready to take you up on your offer. Lockdown ended a few minutes ago. Yeah. I know. I'm sorry I didn't take your case. Me too. Gracie... was the cutest six-year-old
