and this is the day that changes everything...</i> Put your hands up! You're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza. I will be framed for murder... Who the hell are you people? My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i> I know all this because I am living the same day...</i> over and over again. The day is the same, but different things happen. Every day I get another chance. For every decision, there's a consequence.</i> Garza sent evidence to my sister Jennifer and me before he died.</i> I think whoever killed this girl killed Garza.</i> My partner Andrea helped me figure out the clues.</i> That thing you asked about matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez. He's serving five consecutive life sentences.</i> My informant Damien may know something that can help me,</i> but Rita's ex-Husband Chad had the most important Information of all.</i> Where is it? The book-- - You have it. - No. You're lying. If you're right, book's on the front seat of my car. Now that I have the murder book, I have to find out who the girl in the picture is.</i> That thing you asked about matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez. He's been in Pelican Bay since '89, so no way he could have killed anyone. Keep that lying bitch in the trunk. I'll be there. They got Baxter, but they can't find Hop. I meet a chick like that, she'll be cooking for me in three days. No. We agreed this be done a certain way, and now you're changing the plans on me. No, I'm not angry. I feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over. Bye, mom. What are you doing here? That was nice. That was more than nice. It's been a while. A while? What was last night? No, I'm just saying-- I guess, I guess I just can't get enough of you. Where do you think you're going? Gotta go to the station pick up a murder book from this cop before he leaves for the day. You're in narcotics. Why do you need a murder book? This cold case that my pops was working on back in the day-- may be connected to something I'm working on right now. Your dad? That's kind of weird. You and your dad connected through a murder. There have been stranger things. What time you supposed to go meet this cop? I'm not. I'm just gonna break into his car and take it. Yeah, right. I hope they'll bust you. How you holding up? Eddie wasn't real happy about rehab, but... we talked about it. He knows he needs help. That's good. Here's the thing you called about. Miguel Dominguez. Gang task force didn't have much. This is way too thin for a guy with five consecutive life sentences. Yeah, I know. It didn't seem right to me either, but I checked. That's it. Hold up. He's a Latin disciple? It didn't come up anywhere I checked. It's the first tag G.T.F. put in the system. Anybody ask you why you wanted this? But you got me curious. Is this connected to the L.D. thing you're working with the feds? Yeah, I think so. And you were gonna tell me about that one day? All right, you wanna roll with me on this, you find out why there's only two pages on this guy. I have I.A. in an hour. God forbid I keep Shelton waiting. Well... He'll live. Any leads on the disciples yet? I'm about to go chase one down. Thanks for this. Where is he? I don't know! I don't know! I swear, man! Where's Damien? You gotta be kidding! We've got a problem. Hey, <i>ese</i>, you ain't got no business here. Turn around and keep walking. My business is with Damien. Move. - You're making a big mistake-- - Move. It's not what you think! Go! You have no right to be here, Hop. - This is my family. - I called. You didn't pick up. You know what this looks like? The lack of respect? You coming up in here with a gun? My moms is here. What the hell is wrong with you? I thought you had more sense than this. You're on the run, D. There are skinheads out there looking for you right now. You think I'm running? People look for me everyday, Hop. I ain't hiding' from nobody. And being here is important, all right? I promised my niece I'd make it to her party, and I keep my promises-- Something you need to work on. You lucky I'm with my family, or I'd deal with you myself. Yeah. We need to talk. Get out of here, all right? Before I change my mind about letting you leave. Two minutes... outside. I'm gonna be right back, all right, loco? Let me handle this <i>hura</i>. Better make it quick, Hop. I may be your boy, D, but I'm not one of your boys. We straight on that? I'm gonna remember this. Shut up and listen. Miguel Dominguez-- He's a Latin disciple connected to a murder I'm looking into. You want me to help you? Hop, you don't get that kind of love, all right? Everything that's happening to you right now, D.-- The skinheads, the hit on the safe house-- All goes back to this guy... to this case. What's that? It's a murder book. Any info on a murder goes right in here. So this is how you catch bad guys? Some of 'em. Who's this? She's a Jane Doe. Looks more like a Juanita to me. Look here. Now this hourglass was found next to her dead body. L.D. prints were all over it. So go catch him, Shaft. Already been caught. Dominguez has been doing life, Pelican Bay, since '89. Problem is, she was killed in '91. Well, he's definitely Fam. Old school as hell, but he ain't ringing no bells. What'd he do? Killed his parents in their sleep. Arrest report said the cops found him in the kitchen, Eating on a bowl of cereal, still had-- Still had the blood all over him. So then you do know him? Not as no damn Dominguez, bro. Well, as who? El Lloròn. The Crying Man. We don't talk about him, Hop... ever. Well, you about to talk right now. He's the bogey-man. Someone goes missing, must be <i>El Lloròn.</i> Kid don't eat his vegetables, you tell him <i>El Lloròn</i> is coming, and he cleans his plate. He's like Freddy... kill you in your dreams. - This is where she was found? - You know it? L.D. Territory? - Nah, man. - Come on, don't waste my time, D. Look, Hop. I got nothing more to say about El Lloròn. But I might be able to help you with her. Hop. El Madre Magdalena... She wants to know why you're looking for her. Tell her I need to know who she is... and why she died. The sister's been looking after immigrants and illegals since I was growing up. Somebody goes missing, the families come to her. They're all missing? Yeah. I knew her. She used to live down the street from me when I was growing up. Not that many. We should be out of here in no time, right? All right, where do you wanna start? Just start at the beginning. I already told you, Brett was with me all night. Ms. Shelton, if we could just go through the night one more time. He didn't do this. He got to my house around 9:00. He stopped and got Chinese, we watched a movie and we went to bed around 11:30. Did you fall asleep together? I woke up to use the restroom around 2:30, he was still asleep. He was with me all night. Will you excuse me? She seems pretty credible. Why, because she's cute? How about because she hasn't flinched from anything we've asked? - I believe her. - If she's telling the truth, someone's lying. Tell him what you told me. 'Bout to get outta here. Man, this toy cop over here said I had some dime bags on me. Now I did have 'em, but y'all need to let me back out on the streets, - 'cause you know I'm on the same team. - Team? Yeah, I been putting' in work for Hopper, man. I'm one of his C.I.S. This is what you brought me here for, man? Matter of fact, I saw my man this morning. You saw Hopper today? Yeah. Let's talk some more. Come on. What? Come on, man. I been up here all day. Yo, Hop, this is way too much work. Why don't you just tell me about El Lloròn? We don't have to mess with all this. We're in the basement of a church, nobody can hear you. What, you don't think the devil ever goes to church? She said, "why does a man who's wanted for murder care so much for a lost soul?" Cops been rolling through the hood looking for you, Hop. Tell her I was framed. This girl can lead me to the truth. - 'Cause... - Yeah, I know, I got it. She still needs to be found. We need to see if this girl's mother still lives around here. You know what? Here on out, you need to do this on your own, Hop. If this is all connected to El Lloròn, I ain't trying' to be involved on that level. You already are, Damien. Rita, is everything okay? Brett, where are you? - What's wrong? - This 2 detectives came and pull me off my job. They grilled me. - Wait, Chad didn't come get you? - Chad? I haven't talk to Chad in weeks. Brett, they're saying you killed a man. I know, I know and I didn't do it. I'll explain all that later. Listen, for now, stay in the house, no matter what. All right, I'm gonna call you right back. You reach Chad Shelton, leave a message.</i> Yeah, man, where are you? No. We agreed this would be done a certain way, and now you're changing the plans on me. No, I'm not angry. I just feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over. Bye, mom. What are you doing here? This is my family. Two minutes. Thank you, sister. All right, let's go. Excuse me. I told you, he'll see you when he's ready. Okay, you know what? Tell him he can find me in narcotics. Yeah, it's me. Reschedule Battle. He lost the book. How's your next week looking? Don't stress, Hop. This side of town, you blend right in. Yeah, right, with this bull's-Eye on my chest. Bull's-Eye? That's more like an "s." Today you're "Supercop." I still can't figure how you found that picture so fast. Been looking for it for a while. I hate this part. I know what you mean. - Yes? - Ma'am, I'm detective Hopper. Are you related to Isabella Contreras? Yes, I'm her mother. May we come in, please? Thank you. Yes ma'am, we've finally figured out what has happened to Isabella. I hate to say this to you, but... your daughter Isabella has been killed, Ms. Contreras. Con permiso, I... I've forgotten where the tea is. Ms. Contreras... See? She was just here yesterday. Who? Isabella? Yes. She told me before she went to work that... she would be back tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'm sorry, the tea. Damn, Hop. She thinks her daughter's still alive. You need to go through her things? I'm just saying, you need to show some more respect for the dead. I'm trying to find her killer, Damien. What do you call that? Hotel soaps and shampoos. Maybe she worked at a hotel, cleaned rooms, kept a few nice things. You ever heard of a hotel maid that could afford dinner at Morton's... Or these? She had a <i>papi chulo.</i> What, that means "sugar daddy"? I'm right with you. Ms. Contreras, did Isabella work at a hotel? No, a very expensive club. She tells me all the time how nice the people are-- very wealthy. You know the name of the club? She said it all the time. Just come back tomorrow when she's home. Then you can ask Isabella the name. - Ma'am, I can't come back tomorrow. - Isabella will be sorry she missed you. I wish I had Mr. Detweiler's number. He'd remember. Detweiler? Yes. He got Isabella the job at the club. You really should come back tomorrow. Now we've gotta find this guy Detweiler. I was cool helping you with sister Magdalena, but after that crazy-ass old lady, you can do this little "Tenspeed and Brown Shoe" routine by yourself. In case you forgot, I got my own drama. Yeah. Sure, I'll be there. He's good. How the hell did they find us? Get down! Punk-Ass bitches blew up my ride. We gotta bounce. I don't give a damn about that truck. Listen, anybody come near my family-- Mama, Rosa, anybody-- You burn them to hell. You take me back to my truck? I got a better idea. Move. Hey, I just saved your ass. Tu eres una maldiciòn. What? You're bad luck. Man, whatever. Just take me to my truck. Your legs ain't broke. Use 'em. Yo, wait! Forgot my damn... phone. Yeah, Andrea, it's me. Hopper, I heard something on the way over here. I know, I gotta tell you about that. You know about Chad? He was gunned down at an A.T.M. on Olympic and Gope. - What? - They think it was an armed robbery. Okay... Damien was attacked, and Chad was... This has never happened before. What are you talking about? You gotta take me to Rita's. I can't stop crying. How'd you find out? They called me at the police station. He still had me as a contact. Well, he was your husband. I know Chad and I had our problems, but he was a decent man. He was good in his own way. He just... He didn't have to die like that, so senseless. After they told me, all I could keep thinking about was you being safe. - They said... - I know, I know. It's not true. Then you shouldn't even be here if they're looking for you. No, I wanted to make sure you were all right. You should go. If anything was to ever happen to you, Brett... I'm not going anywhere. - Stop it. - I don't believe you. Seriously, I gotta go. So you're saying no to breakfast? When do you eat? I never see you eat. I eat, it's just... I know, cop stuff. - Cop stuff. - Come on. So what do you have to do today? Today I gotta find a guy named Detweiler. All right? Later. You're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza.</i> Consequence... decision... Tell me why this is happening! I swear to god, I will find you. Can I help you? Why are you doing this? That's funny, when I asked you why, you shoved a needle in my neck. Conrad! Margaret, call 9-1-1. Yeah, Margaret, why don't you do that? What do you want? You're gonna tell me everything, and then you're gonna give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you. Well, there's one. I'm gonna count to three. One... Two... Mr. Detweiler, I'm detective Brett Hopper. How can I help you? Just so we're clear, I know who you are and what you're capable of. I'm sorry. I don't follow. I also know that your wife Margaret is in the house with a shotgun. Don't call for help. Sure you don't want some? I wanna know about Garza and the Contreras girl. I wanna know why the hell you're doing this to me. Conrad. You didn't say you had company. Margaret. Dear, this is detective Hopper. Hello, detective. Remember, Timmy's birthday party is today at 4:00... Address is on your desk. Pleasure to meet you. Does your family know what kind of a man you are? That you torture and kill people for a living? - My family is none of your business. - You made my family your business. I'm just playing along. Timmy... He's a good-looking kid. Looks just like his mother, Lila. I bet you can't wait to go see them, along with your other daughter Catherine. Yeah, they have a really nice place in Westwood. - And when did you discover this? - Today. Well, sorry if I seem unimpressed, but you need to understand that I've been doing this sort of thing since you were a little boy with a toy badge, chasing after your father's shadow. What the hell do you know about my father? You're not that kind of man. You don't know what kind of a man I am. Trust me when I say that I do, and you are nothing like the people that I work for. What people? Who do you work for? People who'd do far worse than threaten my family. People who would do far worse than put a gun to my head, because that's never been done before. - You're gonna take me to them. - No, I'm not. Then you're gonna die. Hopper... What you don't realize is that I am prepared to do whatever it takes in order to protect my family. So... go ahead. Pull the trigger. Can I help you? Here, everything you want is inside-- The murder book, the hourglass, the photo, all of it. Just make it stop. - Don't know what you're talking about. - You don't have to come after me, my sister or Rita. All right? It ends today, you understand? You and the people you work for, you win. It's not that simple. Make it stop. He came to your house. I assume there must be a leak at the station. Maybe you should have asked Hopper how he found you before you let him go. Sorry, I felt letting him leave was the best way to handle the situation, especially after he left this. He had everything... - The hourglass, the missing film... - He had the murder book. How did he get it? I don't know. What did he hope to accomplish? All he said was, "make it stop." Beyond that, I have no idea what he knows. They're not going to be happy you allowed</i> Hopper to make contact with you. And how should I proceed? If he took the murder book, he knows much more than he's letting on.</i> Burn it all down. The cop who lost the book... He was gunned down at an A.T.M. The gang leader... Hopper... Kill them all. And the girl? I'll take care of the girl. Damien, shut up and listen. The skinheads are still out there looking for you. They're in a black van with a woman painted on the back. They're trying to kill you. Andrea, listen to me. I need you to do something. - Jen, are you all right? - Yeah, Brett, what's wrong? - Where are you? - On my way to the mall. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're okay. I'm fine. - Where's Randall and the kids? - At the house. Jen, I need you to get home immediately. Tell Randall if he sees anything shady, to call the cops. - Brett... - Jen, please, just do it. - Yeah. - We've got the girl. Good. I'm on my way. Nah, he's around here somewhere. They don't stray too far from where they live. Tell Fencik once we take care of this garbage, we'll call. Hey... Heard you were looking for me. We agreed this would be done a certain way, and now you're changing the plans on me. No, I'm not angry. I just feel like I keep telling you the same thing over and over. 'Bye, mom. What are you doing here? Tell you the truth, I'm not so sure. I thought something happened to you. I'm okay. What's... - Those detectives said... - I know what they said... I didn't do it. Why... Why is this happening? A lot of people could have been hurt today because of something I did... Something I took. I don't understand. The most important thing is that you're okay. Where's the girl? You said you had her. This is not a night for mistakes. I agree, sir. So what's the problem? You let him come to your house. Finish it. You just remember, next time it could be you. People are always wondering what the difference is between a warning and an example. The difference is rather simple. Most people don't heed warnings. But hey learn from examples.
