My pillows rule and you know it. You know, we could stay at your place tonight. Maybe. We'll see how the day goes. ...we've got a sigalert on the northbound 405 at the 10</i> to an overturned semi. It spilled over a hundred cases of diapers</i> all across the lanes of traffic. Somebody's tense. Keep going. I'll get over it. You've been working too hard. This coming from a girl who works four double shifts in five days? Life of a nurse. Life of a cop. Let's just take a drive up the coast. Blow off the world for a day. I got a meeting with Internal Affairs at 3:00. - This is about Andrea? - Yeah. How serious is it? Serious enough. I'd hate to lose another partner just 'cause somebody's got a personal axe to grind. You think Chad has something to do with it? I got it. Listen... your business is your business, and me bringing up my ex-husband in the shower just... ...that wasn't right, so I'll never do it again. I didn't mean to break your palm tree thing. My mom gave it to me. I'm sorry. Where can I get you a new one? This cute little place in Palm Springs. I think it's called a gas station. Listen... - I know things haven't been exactly... - No, everything's all good, all right? I'll call you at the hospital? - All right. - Be safe. Give Rambis a hug for me. Okay. I've got a dozen e-mails to return, a conference call that starts like now. And the note says... What? You want me in Burbank by 8:00? That's in 20 minutes. I'm in Venice. Crap. It's okay, ma'am. I'm a cop. Thank you, officer. Excuse me, ma'am! Miss! - I don't know some diapers or some... - Excuse me, miss. You dropped this. Somebody call 9-1-1! Oh my God! Are you okay? My car! My car! Mr. Hopper, your dog bark very hard last night. Oh, sorry about that, Mr. Zeitoun. You have a leak from upstairs. My wife say plumbers come. - Now we have leak. - Okay. - Thank you. - You have leak. We have leak. Rambis? Rambis. Rambis. Psycho dog, did you make this mess? All right, all right, I get it. Give me this. You have nine messages. Message one. Message two. Hello. Sis, I got six hang ups from you last night. What's goin' on? Nothing. We just... We just had a little problem with the phone. But it's okay now. You sure? You sound kinda rattled? It's... we're just late for school. So we'll talk later, okay? Bye. Message seven. Damn it, where you at? It's me, Damien.</i> Turn on your cell phone. They hit the safe house, Hop.</i> You need to come get my ass. Police! Hands up! Easy! I'm a cop. I'm a cop! Okay, okay, I'm relaxed. - Detective Brett Hopper? - Yeah. Get these guys off of me. You're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza. - What? - You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say... - Have a seat. - Before you all apologize for breaking down my door, I want to see the warrant. 'Cause you had to have more than some lame-ass anonymous tip to get a judge to sign off on that kind of a blitz. Well, they told us you'd puff up. I'm detective Choi. Detective Spivak. I've had the pleasure. Look, you know what we do in here, all the tactics, the back and forth, so I'm coming straight at you. What did you have against Garza? You gotta be kidding, right? We've got the murder weapon with your prints on it. All right, well, a gun's easy enough to plant. Prints are doable, too, a little tougher. Where'd you get it? Where do you think we got it? I don't know, but chances are, whoever gave you the gun is in on it. - Now tell me where you got it. - Your place. Your closet. The closet? Pretty stupid move, man. Why would you hang on to something like that? Somebody broke into my place and put that gun there. Now the neighbor said something about a plumber, - and my dog was going crazy, so... - Why'd you do it, Hopper? Was it personal, or did Garza have something on you? All right, you guys aren't. According to the newspapers, Garza was hit sometime last night, right? I was with somebody last night. Rita Shelton. She's a nurse at Westside. So I got an alibi. Secondly, I've never even met Garza, so you got no motive. How about murder-for-hire? I want my lawyer and a phone. After you're booked, like everyone else. Look into the camera, please. Thank you very much. You can step away. Hang on. That's my partner. - What's going on? - I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. I've got to get to my brother! They put me on leave. So before you go telling - certain people things you think... - Andrea, hello? Fingerprints, mug shot... I'm a little busy right now. Let's go, detective. You are a lucky man, Hopper. I got you one of the best defense attorneys in the state: Barry Colburn. He'll meet you at the court for arraignment.</i> Come on, Baxter. You gotta do better than that. Now flex some federal muscle and get me outta here. Doing my best. I've called all morning. Nobody's giving an inch, not the D.A.'S office, not L.A.P.D. I'm a cop with a clean record and an alibi. - How is this happening? - I know you're pissed. But this hurts me, too. Damien is on the run, and you're the only one he trusts. This case hinges on his testimony. Well, I'm sorry for being so insensitive. Seriously, how am I supposed to find my star witness without you? Did you see Damien last night? Did you talk to him? Give me something. He left a message on my machine. He wants me <i>to come get him.</i> Where is he? What happened at the safe house? Focus, Baxter. I'm the one in jail. Now I can't help you or Damien unless you get me outta here. Let's go. Hopper, why did you kill Garza? Baxter tried to put in a good word for you with the L.A. County D.A but Garza was one of theirs. - Right, Colburn... - Barry. Where's Rita? We can't find her. What do you mean? Did you check the hospital? She's not at the hospital, she's not in her apartment, she's not answering her cell. The cops and my people are looking for her. Colburn, your first and last priority as of right now is to find Rita Shelton. Do you understand me? Okay. By the way, pulled in a couple of favors and got you some time with your sister. Jen, where is she? I'll see you in there, Hopper. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. I'm fine. They said they found a gun. No. Well, they did. Someone else put it there. - Who would put... - I don't know. It doesn't matter because I have an alibi. Rita Shelton. Wait, you and Rita, as in Chad's wife? Well, ex-wife, but... And you didn't tell me. Jen, we haven't been talking as much as we... never mind that! I wanna know about those 6 hang ups from last night. And don't give me that mess about the phones. It's nothing, really. Is everything okay between you and Randall? - Of course. - Jen, I... I'm gonna kill him. Who you killing now? Chad. Jennifer. You're lookin' well. Come on, partner. Time to face the music. Boy, you know, cops will pull a lot of crazy stunts to weasel out of a meeting with Internal Affairs. But committing a murder, that definitely wins a prize, right, Hopper? You have an ugly smile. People say that about you, especially women. We'll meet you up on four, guys. I need a little quality time with my old partner here. I said we'll you up on four. Come on. You get the score of the Dodgers game? I know Andrea is a dirty cop. You'll help me prove it. Yeah, I got a few other things on my mind right now besides what my partner may or may not be into. Yeah, this whole murdering-the-assistant-D.A thing, it's a real shame, isn't it? You know this thing screams setup from like a mile away. Setup? No, they got you cold, man. Weapon, prints... But you got an alibi, right? Rita... Been spending a lot of time with her lately. When you gonna make an honest woman of her, get married already? Tell the truth. It bugs you she kept my last name, doesn't it? You need a breath mint. Here's what I don't understand... You don't want to break some unspoken code by telling on your partner, yet you got no problem sleeping with another man's wife? You were divorced, and we weren't partners anymore. You expect me to believe those years we rolled togeth... It never happened, Chad... Never. How is she these days, my little Rita? It's been a while, but there's certain things you just never forget. You know, like in the shower... You better watch it, convict. You play this right, I can help you. But you screw with me... Shelton! Why do I get the feeling you know more than you're telling? 'Cause I do. And due to the severity of the crime and the physical evidences against the suspect, the county requests no bail. We ask... Your Honor, the district attorney's office has been made aware of an exculpatory witness - who can attest to my client's... - A witness that we can't locate at this time, Your Honor. We consider the suspect to be a danger and a flight risk. - Can we ask... - Flight risk? He's a decorated 12-year veteran of the department. Veteran or not, the People are pursuing a charge of first-degree murder. Very well. People's request is granted. Suspect will be held without bail and remanded to county jail. Preliminary hearing is set for a week from today whether or not this witness has been produced. Dismissed. Find Rita. What is this? Where am I? Chad, is that you? Is this how Internal Affairs is running things now? Now that's enough questions, detective Hopper. You're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza. What? Garza, the assistant D.A. You're going to confess. I'm not gonna do a damn thing. Who the hell are you people? You know, you really need to get over this tough guy persona. It's not going to help you here. Show him. You know firsthand how dangerous this city can be. Anything can happen to anyone. Rita... Random acts of assault and battery, rape. Carjacking. I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! - I will kill you! - Calm down. There's more. Don't worry. Your sister and the kids are okay. I swear to God, I will find you. Well, whatever you do is your choice, detective, but just remember, for every decision, - I'm gonna kill you. - there's a consequence. Relax. Just a mild sedative. We'd like you to... unwind. Sleep on it. Remember... Decision, consequence. Decision. consequence. What was that for? I had the worst nightmare. It was so real. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I just. I feel a little sore. Brett, what's wrong? You ever have a déjà-vu? Yeah. Gives me the creeps when that happens. ...we've got a sigalert on the northbound 405</i> at the 10 due to an overturned semi. - It spilled over a hundred cases of... - Diapers. all across the lanes of traffic. It's quite a sight to see.</i> Brett? Baby, you don't... You don't look so good. I need a shower. Slow down. What happened? Oh, my side. Did I shave last night? What? No. Why? - What happened? - I gotta go walk Rambis. You gotta be kidding me. You have nine messages. Message seven. Damn it, where you at? It's me, Damien.</i> Turn on your cell... Yes, Rita Shelton. When she gets in, tell her not to go... Jen, stay at home with the kids, today. Don't go to school. - Yes. - Your place... I need a patrol car right outside her apartment. In your closet. It's a pretty stupid move, man. Murder weapon with your prints on it. Why would you hang on to something like that? My name? Detective Spivak. He just dropped it in the water. Rita Shelton, where is she? - I'm sorry sir, you need to wait. - I'm detective Hopper. I called earlier. I need to see her now! She's not here now. She's not here? But her shift started at 8:00. She called in and said she was taking a vacation day. A vacation day? She never said anything to me about... Out of the way ! Massive trauma to her head, internal bleeding, multiple fractures. - What happened? - Bus crash. Driver had a stroke, went out of control. Miss! You dropped this. Crash cart ready! Move her into bay three! I didn't go for coffee. This is not a request! You will sit in my office until you learn to... Brett? What are you doing here? Randall... I'm gonna kill him. You're dismissed. Don't you ever touch my sister again. From the assignment last night, who can tell me what country Jules Verne was referring to? Brett, what are you doing here? Security : first floor west. I can't find Rita. She's missing, so they're probably watching you. Rita? Rita who? Never mind. You're in danger. I need you to get the kids, get in a car and just drive. Don't tell me where to. Don't tell Randall. But go now. What is wrong with you? You're acting really crazy. There isn't any time! - What is it, Brett? - Just do what I say and go far away from here. What did you do? - Just go. - Go get the kids ! What if I pull the wrong block? Then we start the game over, alright? Hopper? Andrea. Thanks for coming. Didn't think you'd call considering the circumstances. Well, believe me, I didn't have anywhere else to turn. Good to know you think so highly of me. I didn't mean it like that. Listen, I need you to do me a favor in case I get caught again. Again? What do you mean? Nevermind. I need your help. I can't find Rita, and I think that she may be in danger. Now look, I know that... you got your own troubles to deal with right now but - I didn't say anything to I.A. about... - Let's just stick to your problem, ok? Tell me what happened with Garza. Garza? Why would you ask me... I'm sorry. Move! Get out of my way! Move! Doors opening. Doors opening. Move! Move! I've got him. He's boarding ! We got him. Suspect's on the westbound train. Cover all exits. Doors closing. Great minds, huh? We could tattoo the word "guilty" right across your forehead. I know I'm clean. Youall ain't got nothing. How about the murder weapon? I don't know what you talking about. Really? So you say the dive teams won't find anything off the Santa Monica pier? In the water. I think we hit a nerve. Who's feeding you this crap? Who's your source? You're not asking the questions, Hopper. We are. Now why did you kill Garza? You wanted the phone. Message seven. Damn it, where you at? It's me, Damien. Turn on your cell phone! They hit the safe house, Hop. You need to come get my ass! I'll be laying low where you first got it all started.</i> You know what I'm saying? Meet me there at 9:00 tomorrow night. That's tonight! Message eight. All right, time's up. Hopper, you should have received a package today.</i> Let's go. Bad enough you're in here for murder. You had to kick the crap out of your brother-in-law, too? It felt necessary... and good. Well, that's great. Anyway, I spoke to your sister, and she's trying to get him to drop the charges - but he's pretty pissed off. - Wait, she's still with him? Yeah, at the hospital. They're still picking the glass out of his back. Okay, listen, Colburn.. Barry... I need you to do me a favor and get my sister and her kids someplace safe. Why? Please don't ask me questions. Just do it. - What about you? - Don't worry about me. I'll get out of here soon enough. Yeah, that's what they all say. Stinking Dodgers! Down six runs going into the ninth. I had to turn it off. Meet you up on four, guys. I need a little quality time with my old partner here. Don't worry, fellas. I'll be gentle. Wanna know a secret, Chad? The Dodgers rally in the ninth. They win. Where is Rita? You are itching for a toe tag, aren't ya? Who is behind this? Who's watching? Where's Rita? You are certifiable. I'll make sure you end up on death row. You believe in second chances, Andrea? You cut a deal with I.A. to bring me in, yes or no? I'm not proud of it, okay. But I.A. is convinced I'm taking a payoff from some... - Are you? - No! You shouldn't keep it under your mattress. I found it in 30 seconds. What are you doing in my home, Hopper? I need to know if I can trust you. If we're still partners. Partners? You've been giving your partner the cold shoulder the last six months. Now you're wanted for murder and you say Rita's missing. - What's going on with you? - I don't know ! I'm just trying to get control of this day. This day is over. You gotta worry about tomorrow. This... mess you're in... have anything to do with the fact you've been looking into the Latin disciples? Where did you hear that? Don't worry. I haven't told anyone. I'm working this case for the U.S. Attorney's office. It's strictly confidential. We flipped this kid, Damien Ortiz against the disciples. Trial's tomorrow. Now he's on the run. If they're after him, they're gonna get him. Well, hopefully not before I do. The disciples are involved in Rita's disappearance? That's what I'm gonna find out. I need you to search her place for me. Check for signs of a struggle, - run a trace on... - Cell phone, yeah. Done this before. Does that mean you're gonna help me? You're gonna need this. Thanks. Where you headed? I'm going clubbing. Hey. I'm Damien's 9:00. Come on, bring him in. Arms out to your side. Turn around. What do you got here? Nice. Come on. Easy! Listen, wait, wait. You don't wanna do this, okay? Get damien, and we can discuss this like men. You think that first step's a bitch? Wait till the next one. Damien... Turned me against my own only - so you could sell my ass out? - I didn't sell you out! - Tell me what happened. - You know what happened. Your safe house was a death trap. Why would I be here helping you while I'm on the run for murder? - Murder? - Yeah. - Hey, yo, who you playing? - Hey, don't you watch the news? I'm wanted for killing an assistant D.A. You gotta tell me exactly what happened D., all right? 'Cause only a handful of people knew where we were hiding you. Well, somebody said something, right? 'Cause them Feds that's supposed to be looking out for me, protecting my ass, are long gone. I wake up, don't hear nobody in the house. Check the window, all the cars are gone. See some skinheaded fools coming my way strapped. Wait, skinheads? - Not disciples? - Nah, some good ol'hog-ridin' boys. Look, I ain't no fool, Hop. I figure the L.D.S farmed it out make it look like some other crew. All right, did any of these disciples say anything about Garza or me? You? Nah, this is bigger than you or some D.A, man. I need names, Damien. You're crazy. Our deal's off, Hop. You on your own. Just give me one name, D. Forget about Feds, forget about Baxter, all right? I will personally find you protection myself. - Nah, man. I don't think so. - You're making a mistake. Just give me a... You people know you just blew away a federal witness? Or is that part of the plan? Forget the kid. We have business to discuss, detective Hopper. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know what you're capable of. I know you can get at Rita and my sister and her kids. But if you want me to take the fall for Garza, you better not touch them. You understand me? How did you know this was about Garza? You're the one behind the curtain. You tell me. I need to know how you came to this information. What are you talking about You told me last time I was here. You think this is a game? Oh, no. Okay, listen, listen, I'll do whatever you tell me. Just don't hurt them! A little late for that. For every decision, there's a consequence. Stop! Why? Tell me why this is happening! Relax. Just a mild sedative. We'd like you to... unwind... sleep on it.
