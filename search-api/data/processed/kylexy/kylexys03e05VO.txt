relationship with you. - A relationship to do what? - Come see what we're about. We are making state of the art advances in science and technology. I'm not interested. Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of? Only Kyle. If you really sense that special bond between you and Kyle, you should act on it. How did you know his name? I never mentioned it. There's a lot of things I know about you, Jessi. A lot more than you think. I think it's time I explained. As long as you don't rat me out to Mom and Dad. - I won't. - Fine. Thank you, Jessi. I knew you couldn't keep your mouth shut. - Jessi didn't have to say a word. - I'm sure she was a pillar of secrecy. I thought you'd be with Andy. Her mom's extended their vacation rental. - I really miss her. - Listen to me. - Adam Baylin... - What? What about him? Adam died today. You may not realize it yet, but this changes everything. How's the speech? Overwritten and tedious. I doubt that. Most of the speeches at the psychology conference usually are. Thanks for coming, by the way. Thanks for inviting me. I thought you could use a weekend away. And I knew Josh would love the free room service. It's nice to see you smiling. There hasn't been a lot to smile about lately, I know. You okay? I think so. It's okay if you're not. When somebody you love dies it can take awhile to make sense of it all. Yeah, especially since Baylin technically died twice. - Just saying. - Maybe we should ride for a while in contemplative silence. Suit yourself. Let me know when we hit the hotel. I'll be the guy in the heated pool all weekend. Nicole had suggested this weekend away as a chance to get away from everything that was on my mind.</i> We were miles away from home and it seemed my mind had brought my problems along...</i> uninvited. Why're you moving Adam around? We figured if Latnok couldn't find him they couldn't convince him to come back. They want me to come work with them. With Baylin gone they'll have even more reason now. I won't do it. Well, they give you the choice. I was gonna tell Amanda everything. You'll just be adding her to a list of people that you've already compromised. - Is that what my life is now? - More than ever. - What's the matter? - That sign we just passed, it says we're on Route 41. I must have taken the wrong road. - What's going on? - Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. I knew I should have driven. Very funny, but we need to get off this road. I can turn at the next exit. Watch out! 6th Race - XY BelXander, MiniBen314, Ologele et Sniper2410</i> Saison 03 Episode 05 Life Support Forom.com & U-sub.net I think I'm fine. Josh? Seatbelts totally save lives. How bad is it? It's pretty bad. - Do you have your phone? - Yeah. I got nothing. You guys, I think I'm stuck. The dashboard on my side is caved in. Let me help you. No, no, no, stop. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. I just can't get out. Let me try the other side. I don't think anybody's coming in or going out this way. Hello? Are you all right? - Did you hear that? - Yes. Is everybody okay? - You sure you're okay? - No, I'm fine. I can just sit here - until someone comes. - Is anyone hurt? I don't have any choice about it, do I? It's freaking me out that nobody's answering.</i> Hello! I'll stay with Mom. We're fine. Oh, my God. I thought you guys were straight up toast. Which would have been a downer. The upside is, I have someone who can push my car out of the road, so thanks to you, I'm no longer a highway hazard. Not counting the accident I just caused, of course. By someone who can help I meant you. Come on. It'll only take a sec. Geez, Louise. Stare much? - You're pregnant. - Holy crap. Really? I got it. God, I hope somebody comes by. No one ever drives this road. - See? That only took, like... - Twenty seven point two seconds. But who's counting? Are you all right? It's all good. Braxton Hicks. Is that your baby's name? Braxton Hicks contractions. It'll pass. I think I'm gonna walk back a ways, see if I can't flag somebody down. - But you're pregnant. - And you're repeating yourself, so either you're a dumb little bunny, or you have a concussion. Either way, you're gonna need some help. - You should stay here. I... - I'm not an invalid. - You won't see anybody for miles. - I'm fine. What? My water just broke. You left these on top of the dryer. I thought I'd bring them to you. I just made that. With military precision. Don't want to wreck the hospital corners. You seriously don't want me sitting on your bed? I like to keep my room clean. Totally get it. Your space, your rules. Is that my shirt? You never wear it anymore. So, you just took it? You shouldn't wear this color. It looks better on me. Okay, so I can't sit on your bed but you can just raid my closet? Jessi, that is 100 percent not cool of you. That shirt is mine. Did you buy it? Then, technically, it's not yours. Dad! Are we having this discussion? - She's inappropriate. - She's mean to me. I am not mean! You're only nice to me when you want something. - Both of you, give it a rest. - Just keep her out of my face! I already told her it's not her color. You said you were coming right back. I was hoping to get this car started. If I had the right parts I could get you to the hospital before your baby was born. Check it, bunny. And, by the way, no offense, you're cute as a button, but, I'm the reject from the Macy's Parade, all right? I think I'd know if I'm actually going into labor. She's going into labor? - Who's this guy? - That's Josh. - And bunny over there? - Kyle. Great. I'm Gretchen. I want you to both listen to me very carefully, all right? I'm in my 35th week. I'm not due for at least another month. But your water just broke. You can expect to give birth in as few as two hours. Or as much as a full day from now. - How do you know that? - He knows a lot of stuff. Okay, then. Figure out how to get us out of here in under two hours so that I don't have to give birth in the woods like some crazy wolf mother person. Lucky for you, Kyle's an expert at wood births. I'll go talk to Nicole. - And she would be? - My mom. Finally. Someone who knows something about having a baby. Get her up here. I'll be right back. So, your mom's okay, right? She's just... stuck. You hungry? I've got some smoking hot cheese crackles in the car. Those things are disgusting. And I love them. Well, I took basic human biology, but as far as my own experience goes, it's basically, breathe, push, catch. What, like football? We're not gonna be able to do this. Sure, you can. You read the encyclopedia. Which gives a brief overview of the physiological process. But it doesn't tell you how to deliver a baby safely. How's she doing now? She's trying to hide it, but she's had a few contractions. About 20 minutes apart, 30 to 45 seconds each. Okay, well, it does sound like she's in labor. The contractions are just her cervix dilating so the baby can come out. We still have some time. - I can go get help. - No, no, you shouldn't leave her. - I'll go. - Walk three steps without limping. Look, we may not like it, but we're just gonna have to sit tight until help comes. - Here's another thing. - About the baby? You can't delay labor once it starts. So, if the baby comes before help does? Then Kyle will be delivering it, whether he wants to or not. Holy mother of macaroni! Wait. I feel it. A heartbeat. Really? Show me. Oh, my God. You... totally distracted me. Swell job. Contraction's over. I wasn't pretending. Really? You have ultrasound hands? Any other superpowers I should know about? 'Cause, I mean, if you could fly me to Seattle General right about now... I think you could use some water. Wait, don't leave me. She freaks me out! I have an idea. I'm gonna try and reach Jessi. Don't you guys have to be in the same room for your mind mail to work? I have to try something. Make sure Gretchen's comfortable. I'll just be a minute. Try your cell again. When we were touching, Jessi and I could access each other's minds.</i> We could always sense one another if we were near.</i> But lost in the woods, miles from home,</i> I had no idea if she would pick up what I was sending.</i> Or if she could understand that we need help.</i> - Father-daughter bonding? - He's keeping me out of your hair. - You're welcome to play, you know. - Right. She probably cheats. Accident. - What's happening? - Sorry, I was trying to reach Jessi. - Are you okay? You... - Oh, I'm fine. Did it work? - I have no idea. - Kyle, get up here! - I think Gretchen needs your help now. - I don't know what to do. Well, just tell her to push when she feels like it and trust her body to do most of the work. Is that all? There's nothing else I can do? All you have to do is keep her calm and focused and encouraged. Focused and encouraged. Less than two minutes since the last contraction. - The baby's coming. - Then you'd better get to it. Josh, grab a blanket. Use a couple of bags as pillows and set it up on that hillside over there. - There's one in the trunk of my car. - We're gonna get you propped up. Maybe a little Gravity will do part of the work. Ready? Come on. Got one. I think it's coming right now. Can you see anything? If you're waiting for a handwritten invitation, it's gonna be a while. Wait. Risk of infection. Nicely done, excitable, sidekick. Okay, I'm ready. I just lost my virginity. I'm not ready for this. He's a regular Santa's little helper, huh? It's okay. Go ahead and push. Just keep pushing. I can't do this. We need help. We need serious help. Don't worry. We're gonna get it. Everything okay? Something's wrong. - What is it? - I don't know. That's not a word. - That's definitely a word. - Not according to the game dictionary. How do you know that? Of course. You read it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I need a break. Oh, look. We're out of my soda. I wonder how that happened. And yes, I bought it. - Now you're just being selfish. - I'm being selfish? You're the one who takes what she wants when she wants it. - That's called being assertive. - You are unbelievable. Have you heard from your mother? No, but I'd like to have a few words with her right now. Someone just called. Her speech is in half an hour and they haven't arrived. They were supposed to be there hours ago. - I know. - Stephen. - Have you heard anything from Kyle? - I think so. Look. "Crash. Ravine." "Distress." - Dad, you don't think...? - No, we don't know anything yet. You try their cell phones. I'll try Highway Patrol. I can't do it. You're doing great. Just keep pushing. Just stop, okay? I'm tired of pushing and I just want this to be over. What's wrong? Gretchen, I promise I'll be right back. I'm just going to the car, okay? Okay? Bring back drugs, please. - How's the baby doing? - I was getting a strong heartbeat earlier but it's fading fast and the labor's not progressing. I don't know what to tell you. I could stimulate the baby with a little charge. You don't think that would be dangerous? I've done it before. What's wrong? - You're warm. - I got banged up a little. Nicole, you're bleeding! Oh, no, no, it's not that bad. - I gotta get you out of here. - The baby needs you. - You need help. - Somebody has to help that poor girl bring her baby safely into the world, and that person is you. Now, go! I'll be back for you as soon as I can. Go. Anything? We know that they were headed east on Interstate 90. Nicole used her credit card at a gas station about 42 miles outside of Seattle. Narrows our route options down to nine. So they either tookay a wrong turn or maybe they decided to take a scenic route. Kyle was driving, they wouldn't have taken a wrong turn. You're right. Maybe... It's got to be one of the scenic routes. That narrows it down to Rocky Canyon Road, Silica Heights and Elk Heights. I'll try to get Highway Patrol to search those roads. Yes, officer, Stephen Trager once again. Apparently, my family...</i> Wait. - It's Route 41. - Hold, please. - That's not one of the routes. - I know but that's what it is. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. It's Route 41. - Something's wrong. I know it. - No. Gretchen, I need your help. Can you stay with me? Good. You're gonna have another contraction in a minute. And when it comes I need you to push. Just close your eyes and focus, okay? - Okay. - Just think of something happy. - Smoking hot cheese crackles? - Yeah, that'll work. Okay. Okay, it's coming. Cheese crackle! Cheese crackle! Cheese crackle! Push. Come on, one more. Come on, you're doing it. You're doing it! You're doing it. Keep pushing. It's a boy. I'm gonna name him "Dumb Little Bunny" after you. You will? Absolutely not. Keep screaming, little buddy. Maybe somebody will finally hear us out here. I promise you, I'm gonna try and be, like, the most rad mother ever, okay? It's okay. It's okay. - I'll go tell Mom. - No, stay here. - But I want... - Josh, stay here. I hope he has an inny. Outy belly buttons are just weird. Just be glad he has one. - What's he saying? - Is it good or bad? Maybe if you shut up he could hear. Your wife has... internal injuries. Her organs are in distress. She has a punctured lung and right now her condition is critical but stable.</i> What is it ? What's wrong ? There's too much noise. Well, she's out of surgery. They were able to stop the internal bleeding but there was some damage. So, she'll be okay ? The doctors say the first few hours will be critical. She's a fighter. And they're hopeful she can pull through. Of course she'll pull through. She's Mom. She'll be fine. - Can we see her ? - What are you crying for ? We have to stay calm. Visitors aren't allowed in the ICU, but once she feels better - we'll be able to get back there. - We have to just sit here ? I know it's hard. But... we have to put our trust in her doctors. Now, they want me to fill out some forms, so... I'll be back. - Where's Jessi ? - Outside somewhere. I shouldn't have left her. If I would have got her out of the car, then... Kyle, this isn't your fault. I can't just wait here and do nothing. Then don't. You can help her. - But Stephen said her doctors... - Forget her doctors. All of them combined aren't as smart as you. You know I'd do anything to help Nicole. But I don't know how. And even if I did, they won't let me back there. You can't let a little thing like that stop you. If you don't know it by now, you might as well give up. Now I know it. Come on ! That's not gonna make it work. I'm sure Jessi could fix it. You have to stop fighting with Jessi. Why? Because she's the supernatural genius who saved the day ? No. Because you're betterthan this. Am I? Because I sort of thought I was the one who picked fights and then stood around like an idiot while everyone solved the problem. There is nothing you could do. That's the point. Jessi figured out where they were, Kyle delivered a baby. Even Josh was a hero. And... now... Mom's in there and there's not a thing that I can do to help. You help just by being here. That's not much, Dad. It is more than enough. It's helping me, okay ? Okay. Patient is male, 23 year old mechanic, admitted non-responsive. History of depression but no drug overdose. Toxicology reports are negative. Patient was dehydrated and in metabolic acidosis. Course of action ? What do you got ? He's a mechanic. He may have injected antifreeze, which means possible glycol poisoning. Impressive. How is it possible we haven't worked a shift together all year ? I wasn't supposed to be here today. Keep up, gentlemen. Female, car accident. Laceration to right torso, blood loss and acute internal injuries including rib fracture, subsequent pneumothorax. Blood oxygen levels extremely low, blood pressure is down. What can we expect to see, moving forward ? - Possible sepsis ? - No sign of external infection. Anyone else ? If her heart rate continues to fall, her kidneys will fail. Other organs would follow. Correct. Unfortunately, the damage is extensive and her systems have already shown signs of failure. So, we do nothing ? We've done all we can. Our job now is to make sure she's comfortable. There has to be a way to heal her. Can we rebuild the cells in her damaged organs ? Forward-thinking but hardly realistic. That sort of stem cell technology is years away. Now, let's move on. Andy, hey, I keep getting your voicemail. Anyway, you know how you always tell me to charge my phone in case of an emergency ? Well, you were right, I was wrong. Now, I don't want you to freak out, but I'm at the hospital. I'll try to talk quick so my phone doesn't cut off before I can... tell you what happened. I'm sorry I left you. But I'm here now. And I'm going to make you better. I promise. Code blue, room 347, Code blue, room 347.</i> What are you doing in here ? A power surge must have set off the alarm. Vitals appear stable. Is she better ? She'd have much better odds if you weren't interfering. If I catch you alone with her again I'll have you thrown out of the hospital. I had saved one life today by helping Gretchen's child into the world.</i> The birth in the woods was more natural and beautiful</i> than anything I had ever experienced.</i> And so different from my own birth.</i> But it had also shown me how life and death exist in uncertain equilibrium.</i> Would I be able to save Nicole and keep the scales balanced?</i> Did supporting one life mean I had to lose another?</i> I never got a chance to thank you. You got my message and sent help. You heard me. Is there any news? I couldn't help her. With everything we can do, I can't... There must be something. He's so beautiful. And she's so happy. We never had that. No. It's hard to believe he wasn't even here a few hours ago. He was still safe and protected. And all he had to do was get bigger and stronger. Now he's out here in the world and anything can happen. Do you think it's better to stay in a pod for 16 years? I guess the important thing is what we do after we're born. The fluid. What? Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid. It's what nourished us while we were in the pod. You think it could help Nicole? Adam used it to heal himself from a gunshot wound. It might help restore her damaged tissue. As far as Nicole's doctors know, that fluid doesn't even exist. There is one place you might be able to get some. - I can't ask Latnok. - How could you not? I know how you feel about them, but Nicole is in trouble. You have to ask for their help. You have to try. Josh told me I could find you here. I've spent my life respecting science and logic. Rejecting religion. But when it comes right down to it, I'm sitting here praying for a miracle to spare my wife. It may not be a miracle, but I think I know a way I can help her. Adam Baylin's formula. - From the pod. I can inject it... - Inject it? Into her IV. The doctors don't have an alternative. Kyle, you know that I... - But this... - Is hope. A real chance. Let me do this. Anyway, I hope you get this. My cell phone's dead so I guess I'll try again later. I don't know how you spent so much time in hospitals. I mean, I know you had to, but they're creepy and weird. I hate this waiting! I'm just... pretty scared. Andy, please. You get back. Please deposit 85 cents. Wait, wait. Please deposit 85 cents. Hold on, I'm not done yet. - Why are you still out here? - The waiting room is for family only. You're family, sort of. Not really. Yes, you are. As much as I try to convince myself that you're not. I'm sorry I make you miserable. You don't make me miserable. I'm just... a miserable person sometimes. Why? I don't know. I just am. I don't like fighting with you. - Yes, you do. You're good at it. - You're better. I am? You always know what to say to win. And that's something to be so proud of? Still, it's impressive. I feel like all I've been doing lately is fighting with people. You should stop. You're probably right. Especially now. Kyle will fix it. That's what he's good at. You gotta love Kyle. I mean in a platonic, brotherly sort of way. I'm sorry I said all those things to you earlier. I was panicked and I took it out on you. It's just... my family. They mean everything to me. They mean everything to me, too. I know they do. She's not doing well and the doctors don't think she can make it. But the fluid that Adam invented has regenerative properties. I know Latnok helped him when he was healing. And you think we kept the leftovers? My mother is dying! Please. I have what you need. I can get it to you. Thank you. But you have to do something for me. Join us at Latnok. Participate. - You're using this situation? - You are asking me to provide you with the one thing that might save your mother's life and yet you continue to see Latnok as evil in some way. We are all about scientific advances like Baylin's. All I'm asking you is, take part. I can have that fluid here in 20 minutes. It's your choice. A chance to save the woman who had saved my life</i> just by letting me into hers. As far as I was concerned, my choice had already been made.</i> She's gonna be okay. That's awesome news. She'll recover. I don't like being dishonest with him. All you did was help lead him to the cure. Gave him a nudge in the right direction. And now Nicole's better, right? I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today because I knew it could save Nicole's life. Now if you ever do anything to harm him,
