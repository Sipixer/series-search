That's a beautiful stone. I'll be back for that. It's not in there, kid. Your ring? - I sold it. - Who bought it? Welcome to Madacorp. I think I made a mistake bringing Jessi to you. I think it's vital that she continue coming. In fact, if Jessi misses even one appointment, I won't hesitate to call Social Services. 'Cause I like you. Don't you like me? Well, yeah. Let's count to 3 and both say what's on our minds at the same time. - I like you. - I have cancer. What? Zzyzx. That's the way in. When we were down there... I saw things. This was Baylin's. Can't get it open. Locks can play secrets. The stronger the lock, the bigger the secret. Adam Baylin's secrets are locked inside this box. The secrets of Zzyzx are locked inside my head.</i> But what could be so important to make me lock them away and keep them a secret from myself?</i> I guess sometimes the only thing more elusive than secrets</i> is the key to unlocking them. In this case, the key was the ring that Adam gave me: the ring I no longer had. I just don't understand what's so important that's locked inside Kyle's head. Everything that Zzyzx was able to feed him... that is, before you could fit their remains in an ashtray. How did your trip with Stephen Trager go? It went well. He opened up about his dead father. I'd say we bonded. And how are things with Nicole since your... altercation? We'll find out. She has another session with Jessi in a couple of days. We need to speed things up. Drop the spoon and back away from the stove, nice and easy. Come on, I'm starving. It's your fault this stuff smells so good. I think there was a compliment in there somewhere. Pasta, most delicious of all carb delivery systems. Yeah, it's an old family recipe. - How old? - Oh, about 53 minutes. Oh, I need you to set an extra place at the table. Amanda is joing us. Did Kyle invite her? Yes, and he's very excited and whatever the Kyle version of nervous is. Great. Kyle has a date. Bye-bye, leftovers. Josh, this is important to him. Hey, Josh, why don't you invite Andy over for dinner? What, no smart-ass reply? What's next, locusts? Hey, guys. We have a guest for dinner. This is my boss, Julian Ballantine. Sorry to spring this on you. Didn't get a chance to call. Don't be silly. It's so nice to finally meet you, Mr. Ballantine. Bye-bye, seconds. This is Josh and Lori. Good to meet you, and please call me Julian. I brought... red and white. - Didn't know what you'd be serving. - I like red. I mean... I mean, I will when I'm 21. I heard the door. Is Amanda... Oh, you must be Kyle. I heard so much about you from Stephen. We work together at Madacorp. Excuse me. You have to forgive Kyle. Tonight's kind of a date. You look beautiful. I didn't know what to wear. I wasn't sure how fancy it would be or not, so I... You wear what you were wearing the first time I saw you, when you were playing the piano. I had no idea I... Wait, how could you even remember that? How could I forget it? Well, I almost forgot. There's this concert at Seattle Phil. They're playing Pachelbel's works and... I'd love to. Go with you, I mean. Yes. That's good, that's good. Oh, please.</i> I almost brought champagne, but I figured I'd save it till after the test this week. - What test? - It's a systems integration test. We bring all the software and hardware online together at the same time. We synch it all up to the mainframe and evaluate the biometric signature compatibility. So you're turning neural impulses into computer data. Sounds you understand this stuff better than I do. You know, maybe I should have served dinner with a manual. I don't know what I did before we had Stephen around, after this week, I promise I won't keep him away from you any more than absolutely necessary. I figured Emily can handle the next trip solo. Emily went with you last weekend? Yeah. She's part of the project. I'd like to propose a toast, if I may. To Stephen and your wonderful family, whom I hope I get to know much better in the future. - Cheers. - Cheers. Transcript : swsub.com Subtitles : Projet-SG & SeriesSub Season 2 Episode 10 - House of Cards  - Baylin's ring? Yeah. I saw it right there on Ballantine's finger. What do you think? The man who just happens to be Stephen's boss also just happens to be in possession of a ring... Baylin's ring... that you pawned. A ring that just so happens to be the only way of opening Baylin's box that you happened to dig up out of that underground death trap. What do I think? I think there's no such thing as coincidence. I need to talk to Foss about this. Baylin told you not to trust him. Baylin told me not to trust Taylor. I think Taylor switched the message. Whatever. You can't just sit back and wait for Foss' blessing. Amanda, it's Kyle. He's gonna be thrilled no matter what you wear. Trust me, if I wear something lame, he'll remember it. What's the matter? I got a letter from this conservatory in New York. I applied there a long time ago to study piano. And I kind of got in. That's awesome. I'd kill to get to go to New York. I'm totally excited. It's just... It's for a whole semester, - and... - The long-distance thing. - It explains your attention to detail. - Yeah. Am I crazy to think it could work? I mean, it's three time zones away. With any other guy, I'd say don't waste your anytime minutes, but it's Kyle. He spent the last year pining over you from a distance. I'm sure one semester won't even make a dent. Dig in. Don't worry. There's, like, zero nutritional value in there. No, thanks. I can go back and get a turkey club, if you'd rather have that. Josh, my stomach's kind of on edge. I have a test tomorrow. Well, fear not. I got a laser printer that can print, like, nanoscopic so I can make you the primo cheat sheet. It's not that kind of test, Josh. You mean... It's how the doctors are planning more chemo. Right. You should get some popsicles, then. No, I was reading online that chemo makes you really dehydrated, - and one thing that helps is popsicles. - Josh... No, seriously. What flavors do you like? just in case - the cancer's back. - Please don't use the C word. The other C word. Remember when I said you couldn't talk to anyone about this? Well, that includes me. Homework? Oh, God, it feels like it. I've that systems integration test coming up. Right. Well, Ballantine sounded very impressed with you. So, um... hey, you never really told me about your business trip. You know, San Francisco. Oh. Well, it was... it was good. It was work, but it was good. And after everything that happened with my dad, it... it was just nice to get away. Lori, could you get that? Well, I'm glad you got a break. Yeah. And... as it turns out, Emily's got a few issues with her father, too. She really understood. Well, I'm glad you had someone to talk to. Phone for you. Oh. Thanks, hon. Hello. What's up? Really? Well, that's good news. But, hey, that's why we get paid the mid-range bucks. Absolutely. Ah, no problem. All right, you, too. Crap. You scared me. Who was that? Just someone from work. Listen, I'm gonna go take a shower, okay? Thanks for letting me come to work with you. Just... promise me you won't disassemble the mainframe. I didn't like misleading Stephen, but Declan was right. I couldn't sit back and do nothing. I had to face Ballantine on his own ground,</i> to try to figure out what we were up against.</i> You've no idea how delighted I was to hear you were coming with Stephen. What brings you here today? Research for a project. Must be very important if they let you out of school. There's a lot riding on it. Well, I hope I can lend a hand. I appreciate that. Right this way. Thank you, Mr. Ballantine. I don't know if Stephen has told you much about what he's been doing here, but he's working on the CIR, short for Cerebral Impulse Relay. It's a lot like an advanced MRI machine. You know, I must admit I'm not a science person. I'm more of a big picture kind of a guy. Well, what's the big picture of? Well, our hope is to help patients suffering from things like Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and dementia recover from memory loss. Give them back that part of their lives before they've really lost it. Ballantine's goal seemed like a noble one,</i> but I couldn't help thinking he was only telling me part of the truth.</i> Since an MRI is basically a giant magnet, no one's allowed to bring metal into the lab. Your password, sir. Shall we? Kyle, I'd like to introduce you to the Cerebral Impulse Relay, or CIR. But we like to call it "Sir. " Have a seat. Not to worry. She's not even online yet. We're still working out some of the kinks. But after the system's integration test, she'll be up and running. Maybe some other time. Count on it. That ring came from Baylin. He made a point of leaving it to you. Why would you pawn it in the first place? I tried to buy it back. And this Ballantine beat you to it. You know, this... this ring... this ring is important. More than you know. It... What do you mean? Look, you just should have told me sooner, that's all. I would have if I'd known where you were. You know what? What's done is done. So what did you find out about Ballantine? That he must be hiding something, there's enough security at Madacorp to hide whatever it is he's hiding. Well, after Taylor, that's one more person you can't trust. What is... What is he doing here? - What are you doing here? - He wants to help us. Like you said, Foss, Kyle's running out of people he can trust. Help us do what? Get answers. Ballantine invadedy home, my family, and my privacy. I don't know what he's doing with my ring and wants - with me or the Tragers. - So what do you want to do? I want to get my ring back. I'm glad you came. Well, it's important for Jessi. Come on in. Thanks, Nicole. See you in an hour. Right. I... I like your glasses. Oh, yeah? I lost my contacts. You should lose them more often. You look great. Thanks. Bye. Come on. The cameras we have to worry about are here, here, and here. We can disable those, assuming they're on the same circuit. Then there are motion detectors, double-redundant I.D. interfaces, and retina scanners. What's the matter? I just wonder where he comes in. Worry about yourself, Foss. Wrong. I have to worry about you because you could get me killed. We all have to work together on this. We have one shot, one opportunity. The system's integration test is the only time we know where and when Ballantine will be, and he'll have to take his ring off. That's our window. It's tomorrow or nothing. I don't know. I'm just seeing weird things. Weird how? I have this memory of being in a fire. I asked my sister about it, and she said there wasn't any fire. Sometimes it helps to draw the images. It may help to clarify some things. Want to give it a try? Don't worry how it looks. Just... draw what you feel. Did someone teach you to draw that way? No. Am I doing it wrong? No, no. You... Go on. You're doing fine. And you're sure this will fool Madacorp's retina scan? As long as Kyle can upload it into the security system. The image is clean. Amanda, you got my message. Yeah. I got the tickets. Totally scored the orchestra seats. Are you all right? Yes. I'm sorry, but something came up. What? Something important. It happens. I promise I'll make it up to you. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. I'd better go. You got a minute? Sure. I need to talk to you, strictly confidential. Okay. So you're not my mom, you're my therapist. Andy has cancer. Oh, no. Oh, Josh, I'm so sorry. I finally meet a girl that I like... I mean, she's awesome. She likes to play G-Force. She loves zombie movies... the unrated ones you think I don't watch. And... I want to help her through this, but she won't let me talk to her about it. What would you say to her if you could? I don't know. Something to make her feel better. You may not have to say anything to do that. Andy might just need you to hang in there with her, and if the time comes when she wants to talk, you'll be ready. Paige. Hello. It's Kyle. Hi. Is everything okay? Well, when I was in your office, I think I left my binder.</i> Okay, well, I can bring it home with me. I can pick it up. It's kind of important, I'm not that far away. Well, I'm heading to the systems integration test, but I can have security let you in. Thanks. No turning back now. You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. Are you? Absolutely. - Hello. - <i>Stephen Trager, please.</i> He's not in. Can I take a message? I'm calling from the Stratford Hotel. Mr. Trager stayed here last weekend, and it seems he left his contact lenses in his room.</i> My dad doesn't wear contacts. Are you certain? He was the last... Who is that? Wrong number. Okay. Here's hoping the test goes as well as it did in simulations. Well, you'll be fired if it doesn't. Kidding. But Hollander's out on her ass. Mr. Ballantine's office. I've got a package for Mr. Ballantine that I need a signature for.</i> I'll be right down. Thanks. How do we bypass the security system? Once I get inside Ballantine's office... Your password, sir. I'll be able to access the Madacorp mainframe.</i> That'll give me complete control of all building's</i> video cameras, doors, and retina scanners.</i> I'll be able to switch the image of Foss' retina with Ballantine's.</i> And you know where you'll be. Let me go, man! Get off me! Gonna take this punk upstairs. Cops gonna deal with him. Get off me, man! I didn't do anything! The truth is out there! Resistance is futile! You have a package here for Mr. Ballantine? Thank you, Mr. Ballantine. Damn it, did you have to practically break my arm? I had to look convincing. Why not just taser me? I considered it. Don't mess this up. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. You copy, Smith? Go for Smith. We got a report of a disturbance in the North B stairwell. Copy that. The guard will be detained... and so will the assistant. Foss, you're good to go. 781227. My code name at Zzyzx. What did Ballantine have to do with Zzyzx? I need to see my dad right now. Miss, is he expecting you? No, he's not expecting me. I tell you it's a family emergency! He's in the middle of a software test. Fine. I'll wait. I had no idea what I'd find on Ballantine's computer,</i> but once I was there, I had to take advantage of the opportunity.</i> 781228. I thought the experiments at Zzyzx had ended with me.</i> Well, looks like you two have your jobs for another day. - Was that a congratulations? - I think so. Lori, what's wrong? I need to talk to you in private. Well, let's go to my office. - Excuse me. - Of course. Looks like someone's upset over some contact lenses. We got a problem. - Did you get the ring? - <i>No.</i> Ballantine has it. He's headed your way. Get out now. Mr. Ballantine, there has been a security breach. Are you Paige? Where's your mommy? Away. - What's wrong? - I wanted a lion. - Can I have a crayon? - Sure. Who are you? Just a friend. What's going on? Honey, whatever it is, you can tell me. Are you having an affair with Emily? Why would you think that? The hotel called, the one you stayed at on your business trip. They said you left your contact lenses in the room. I don't wear contacts. I know. But Emily does. Oh, honey, the hotel made a mistake. I'm just afraid you did. Nothing happened. I've seen how you act when she calls. You get all happy and excited. We work together. She understands what I do. She understands you're married? - I'm sorry. - That's okay. No problem. That guard is Kyle's handler. - Did you get the ring? - No. We got to get out of here. Wait. Where's Foss? He's coming. There he is. Ballantine's headed this way. - Wait. Is he close? - What? Yes. We got to go. Can you stop the doors from retracting? I can. What? MacGyver reruns. The problem seemed complex, but the math was a simple mix of algebra and geometry.</i> The angle of the incidence equals the angle of</i> reflection on the Madacorp logo. - What are you doing? Kyle! - Come on, man. That gave me Ballantine's distance. Distance divided by the time told me that he'd reach</i> the elevator in... Three, two, one. Do it now. Lock down the building now. The building is now on lockdown. There's an emergency exit out in the lobby. Are you okay? Uh, I'm fine. You're not fine. Get up. Come on. We got company. - Just leave me. - No. They're coming. Get him out of here. - What are you gonna do? - Buy you some time. - We're not leaving you. - Listen to me. The ring is all you need. - What? - Now go. - Thank you. - Get out of here! We need backup, Level 3! Stupid ankle. - I have to go back. - You can't. They'll take the ring, it'll have been for nothing. - But Foss... - He wanted you to get that ring back. I hope it's worth it. Sir, we got this one, but the others got away. Take him to room 237. Move it. A kiss for Mommy? I missed you. I missed you more. Is this me? No. That's my new friend. Your new friend? Yeah. She made me these. Okay, sweetie, let's go. I was just... returning a CD of Lori's. Did you have fun, doing whatever you had to do? I wish I could have gone to the concert with you. It's okay. I understand. Actually, I don't understand. One minute you're thrilled to spend time with me and all excited to go to the concert, and then you cancel without telling me why. You say it's important, but you won't tell me why it's important. I know what's going on. You do? I rushed you into this. Admit it. Now you're having doubts. I do have doubts, but... If that's the way you feel, I need to tell you something... No. I have doubts about everything in my life... except how I feel about you. I just... What did you need to tell me? Not important. How bad do you suck? Well, you do. Gonna give me a chance? At the game? Aren't you working? You're just afraid I'll smoke you. Right. Dream much? I got the test results. And? Let's just say I'm gonna need a lot of Popsicles. Cherry okay? My favorite. Want half? Cool. - My turn? - Hit it. I'm gonna try the... Mr. Ballantine? Your appointment is here. Send him in. It's nice to finally meet you, Mr. Taylor. Pleasure. We had a little security breach. Someone stole my ring, but it's being taken care of. It had better be. No need for alarm. It was just a... heirloom from my late father. An heirloom. That heirloom is a Latnock ring. You people and your rings. Forgive me if I don't lose any sleep over a glorified pledge pin. You really don't have any idea how important that ring is. Do you? Adam Baylin's secret had been locked inside this box for 15 years,</i> almost as long as I'd been alive. Would his secrets provide
