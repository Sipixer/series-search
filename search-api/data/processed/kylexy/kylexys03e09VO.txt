Only Kyle. I've seen one of these symbols before. Kyle has a ring with this on it. He got it from his birth father. Adam... - something. - Adam Baylin? If Andy can't stay here, then she has to move to Cleveland! I know that's gonna be really hard for you to deal with. Everyone at Latnok seems genuine. But... I'm style not conviced about Cassidy. Have you seen anyone hanging around my office? Actually, I caught Jessi in there this morning. I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts, but I also know that she's volatile and unpredictable. - Her mother's not a friend of Latnok. - What do you know about Sarah? I foudn something, in Cassidy's office. - He has Sarah's ring. - How? I think he might have something to do with her disappearance. You can recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories. It's working! I see something... He killed her. She's dead. My mother is dead. We need to find out why he did it. We will. Hey, Jessi. I didn't know you were here. What's wrong? - It's okay. - What happenned? I heard you thrashing around. It was just a bad dream. It was terrible. I was at Latnok, and... I don't really remember... It's over now. Are you okay? Thank you for checking on me. It's... late. We should get back to sleep. Good night. Good night. 6th Race - XY BelXander and MiniBen314 Saison 03 Episode 09 Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Forom.com & U-sub.net Listen, Josh... I know you're upset about Andy leaving. I've been walking around with a pit in my stomach, I can't eat, I can't sleep. And everytime I think about her being gone... Yes, but she's not, yet. So don't waste your last few days together, moping around. What am I suppose to do? Give her a big send-off. What are her favourite things? G-Force. But juste, playing that for three days straight would be... what we always do. She's into the Cowkeys but, they're out on tour. - And Star Trek! - Star Trek? Popular science-fiction entertainment, encompassing six television series and several feature films. Well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia. Have you seen any of them? No. We'll take you when the new movie comes out. You'll like the character Spock. He's half-Vulcan, half-human. Vulcan? Alien race. So, he's different than everyone else. He struggles to understand human emotion. Sees the world from a unique perspective. Sounds interesting. Our man from the pod can relate. - Except Spock's got really big ears. - Which I have out in the garage. You own Spock ears? Want to dig 'em up? It'll impress Andy. Come on. Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you. That's not easy to do. Something wrong? Well... I need to talk to you about something. I saw you the other night. Kissing Jessi. I'm sorry. No, you don't need to apologize. The two of you have shared so much. You have a unique bond. It's not that surprising that you'd be attracted to each other. It is, to me. I mean, Jessi's always been really important to me, but... these new feelings, I... just don't how to deal with them. Those feelings are confusing enough for ordinary teenagers living in separate houses. It's so much more complicated for the two of you. So, what do we do? You may not like it, but... you and Jessi live here together, as part of our family. And for you to pursue that kind of relationship, well, it's just not appropriate. I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this kind of boundary with you before. It won't happen again. Thank you. I don't want either of you to be hurt. And you know how fragile Jessi is. I just signed for this. What is it? The label not clear enough for you, mate? I've got a new project for you. I want you to team up with Kyle. Seriously? Yeah. It's the formula for a growth accelerant. We've been trying to crack it for months. I think the two of you can make some headway. I don't want to work with him. Ask Jessi. No, that ain't gonna happen. I need someone I can trust. Besides, play nicely with Kyle, and you might make progress with that chick you're seeing. I'll e-mail you the assignment. Police are stil searching for any clues that may shed light on</i> the murder of a hunter found in the woods near Victor Falls</i> almost a month ago. The victim's throat was crushed. So far, police have no motive for the killing</i> and no suspects have been named. Come on, people, move it along. I thought you were open for business. That's right. My business. - We were just... - Tell you what. Sibling benefit. Ten minutes. Start slurping. This may be one of the few places we can be alone together. What? Did you listen in on me and Nicole this morning? Yes, and I don't think it's any of her business. We live in her house. We're part of her family. So... kissing me meant nothing to you? Of course it meant something to me. Then how could you not want to be together? Kyle, when you kissed me, I felt such a rush through my entire body. Didn't you feel it? Is it me, or are you getting a vibe? Trying not to. But they're definitely sitting at least two inches closer than they used to. - You don't think they're...? - God, I don't wanna talk about it. - Can we talk about something else? - Absolutely. So, how goes things with you and Nate? - Good. - That's great. You don't like him. I don't really know him. How well do you? It's still really new. I guess he doesn't talk about himself too much. I don't want to dump on what could be a really good thing for you. I just want you to be careful. Make sure you can trust this guy, that's all. - How's it going? - Good. Is Kyle around? He's back there. Why? I just want to partner up on a project with him. That's really nice. Well, see you later? Am I interrupting anything? So Cassidy's got something for us to work on together. You up for it? You and me? Why didn't Cassidy ask me to work with Kyle? I don't know. He doesn't like you. Fine. Good. You'll have another chance to impress me. We can't be together at Latnok either. We can't let Cassidy know we suspect anything. We can't cause any trouble. If he wants me and Nate to work together, we have to go along with it. Time's up. Get out. Hey, you're home early. - Where's Kyle? - At Latnok, without me. I'm not as fragile as you think. You don't understand how much Kyle means to me. I know how close you feel to him. Nobody cares about me like he does. No one makes me feel as happy or as safe. I need that. I need him. Kyle can still be there for you. But while you're both living in this house, he can't be with you, not in that way. I need to know why you have a problem with Jessi. She... She was poking around in here the other day. I think she may have broken into my safe. Why would she do that? I was hoping you could tell me. I don't know anything about it. Well, did you know that after your mother's car accident, Jessi said to me that if I ever harmed you or your family, she'd kill me. She was just being protective. She could never do anything like that. Really? Jessi is a good person. She's certainly lucky to have a friend like you. I'm just not sure you know who you're really dealing with. Is that all? You scared me. I owe you a few. What are you doing? Reading you. What? I know the look when a girl has a boy on her mind. - What? - You tell me. You can't keep those kinds of secrets in this house. Kyle kissed me. Wait a second, clarify. Did he actually kiss you? - Or did you throw yourself at him? - He kissed me. There was no throwing involved. Why does everyone think that's so wrong? Because it's Kyle, of the pure and beautiful soul. We only want what's best for him. - Which means not me. - No. Get out. Get out! God, I hate myself sometimes. Why do I say cruel things to people? To Declan, Hillary or Jessi? Jessi was the lucky recipient. But I couldn't help it. Am I supposed to ignore that the two of you were huddled up at The Rack today? - Huddled up? - We were just talking. Sharing secrets. What kind of secrets? Have anything to do with Latnok? Yes. Most of the students there have been great. It's Cassidy I need to know more about. So I have to make him believe I'm on his side. You need an olive branch. An overture. Ask him out to dinner. Invite him here. If you want him to believe he's winning you over, a dinner invitation from your parents... I'd like to meet this guy anyway. I don't want him in this house. You're not doing this unless we're part of it. - You and Josh shouldn't be here. - But I want to be. You make Cassidy too uncomfortable. Why is everybody shutting me out? I haven't done anything wrong. You don't want me around either. You know that's not true. You know what? I won't bother any of you anymore. You'd better leave the door open. You know, what we're doing with Cassidy is all about you. I'm trying to figure out why Sarah was killed, and I need him to trust me. So if he wants to drive a wedge between us, we have to let him. I just hate how everyone's looking at me like I'm this horrible person. Nobody in the family does. And you shouldn't care what Cassidy thinks about. Fine. Have your dinner. I'll stay away. Jessi, I need to know that you're committed to this. I have to trust that you can keep things under control. Don't you know me well enough to be sure? I just don't want any surprises. Lori, I need you to help me with something. But you'll have to keep it a secret. Espionage? All over it. - So what's my mission? - I need to know more about Cassidy. I think we should adjust the floor value here. Too many ideal elements. The algorithm lost stability about three adjustments ago. You're right. Easy to miss. Apparently, not for you. Cassidy teamed us up. He must think you can contribute. Cassidy just wants us to get along. I know he supervises everything, but have you ever seen him report to anybody? Why do you ask? Curious. Well, I have no idea who he answers to. All those senior Latnok guys, they're all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger. Right. So, what do we got? Maybe if we adjust the values in this sequence here... That's it. Cassidy's had people working on this for months and you solved it. Just like that. We solved it. I guess we're done. Kyle! I wanted to thank you. For what? For making an effort with Nate. It means a lot to me. I just want you to be happy, Amanda. I want the same for you. So, what's this big surprise? G- Force marathon? Give me more credit than that. - Well, show me already. - Not yet. Still gotta kick out a couple of paying customers so I can reap benefits that come with minimum wage authority. It turns me on when you go crazy with power. Just give me a minute. Whatever it is, he hasn't stopped working on it. Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee when he puts his mind to something. All right, guys, time's up. Makes me sad to think his ambition might stop when I leave. I don't know about that. He's already offered to take half of my shifts next week. I think he wants to stay busy so he doesn't miss you as much. I'm sorry, did I say something? No, it's fine. It's just... My moms changed our plans. We're not leaving in three days. We're leaving in the morning. And Josh doesn't know? This is our last night together. - Mrs. Trager, I presume. - Mr. Cassidy. It's Michael, please. These are for you. They're beautiful. - Please, come in. - Thank you. - Stephen Trager. - Pleasure, sir. - Kyle, how you doing, man? - Hello. It smells ridiculously delicious in here. Don't let that fool you. - Can I get you a drink? - I'd love one. Thank you. You know what it is? Give a girl a minute. The lights, like little stars, shiny surfaces. It feels very... futuristic. An interesting observation, Miss Jensen. Oh, my God. I loveStar Trek. I wanted to give you something really special. You did. - So you know what to do? - The mission is clear. - You love this, don't you? - Nothing like a little intrigue and reconnaissance to light up the night. Here they come. Hey! - Sorry. Too much? - Yeah, a little. A tad. Just, uh, act natural. We just bumped into each other. So did we. I mean, we were both here waiting for you, separately. And then we decided to sit at this table. Here at The Rack. And we're all here now, so you guys want to hang out for a few? - Great. - Fantastic. Hi. This is wonderful. Thank you. I haven't had a good home-cooked meal in I don't even know how long. Where is home, Mr. Cassidy? Brooklyn. OK. Uh, England. East London. Little town called Hackney. Still have family there? We've scattered. But I love Seattle. And my work keeps me busy, so... Kyle tells us you're not a scientist. No. I'm definitely missing that gene. So, what exactly is your contribution at Latnok? I foster. I encourage. Basically, I'm a professional nag. Kyle can attest to my persistence. Yes, I can. I think we'd all like to hear what's expected of Kyle. - Jessi, what are you doing here? - I live here. I thought you had plans to be out tonight. I changed my mind. Well, we were just having dinner. Great. Is there a place for me? - Of course there is. - I'll get you a plate. It must be exciting to have two minds like Kyle's and Jessi's in the mix. Oh, thrilling! Thrilling. Kyle's a natural-born leader. And Jessi shows great potential. This brownie is amazing. So good you want to save some for later. My cobbler's pretty great. Want some? Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit. So, what are you guys doing later? Whatever it is, we can't go back to my house. I've been banished. Your boss, Cassidy, is over for dinner with Kyle and my parents. He's not our boss. I thought he called the shots. Oh, I get it. What happens at Latnok, stays at Latnok. That's right, top secret. No, we like to keep the details confidential, but... I think I can trust you. Cassidy's in charge, but we have tons of freedom. He knows when to help and when to get out of our way. So you like working with him? He's fine. Yeah, whatever. He's, um... You know, we should get going - if we're gonna catch a movie. - No! I mean, I wanna try your cobbler. You used to dream about Mr. Spock? In my mind, we were dating. I was only 12, rember? It was innocent. We'd do things like eat cotton candy and play foosball at the International Space Station. Three days before you leave, and you pull out this great goofy stuff. Josh... Thank you. For what? I just don't think I've said it enough. You've been so great. I haven't been the typical first girlfriend and you've always been there for me. Through everything. And I have to tell you... Stop. No heartfelt goodbyes. We still have plenty of time for that. - Yeah, but... - No buts. Tonight is about you and me in our own private universe. You want to go where no man has gone before? Or just once before? How long have you been waiting to say that? All night long. Michael, you know, Kyle and Jessi share very unusual backgrounds. Two peas in a pod, so to speak. Yes. We've tried to keep their lives very private. My biggest concern is that they always stay protected. Absolutely. Look, my apologies for Latnok's regrettable actions on prom night. - Regrettable is putting it mildly. - Fair enough. But let me assure you, from this point forward, Kyle and Jessi's well being is always at the forefront. You know what I'd like to hear about? My mother. - Jessi. - What? - He must know Sarah. - I've heard of her. Brilliant woman. So you've never met? Never had the pleasure. Really. Jessi, you know she's been in hiding for years. She wants nothing to do with Latnok. That's right. She didn't trust you. She never met me. It's Latnok she had... has a problem with. Nate and I finished that project for you. So soon? Great. You must be working well together. - He was very helpful. - What was the project about? We don't know anything about this guy and he's here having dinner. - Jessi. - He doesn't trust me? - I don't trust him. - Jessi, please. He's done terrible things. - What are you talking about? - You're a liar! You have secrets. Maybe we should tell this family about the secret you've been keeping from them. I think it's beholden upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof. You remember that first night, Jessi. After the explosion... ...you found your way out of the pod and left Zzyzx. You took a little wander in the woods. You came across a man camping. No. A stranger to you. Please stop. And you killed him. An hour out of the pod, and she murdered someone. I'm afraid that's the sort of person that she is. It's in her nature. Jessi, what is he saying? I have the news reports. - The murder's still unsolved. - I didn't murder him. - He had a knife. - Then it's true? No. I was alone. I was scared. He tried to attack me. - Oh, my God. - I'm not a killer! I'm not a killer. Jessi! Jessi! Wait! I'm terribly sorry. I hate to drop news like that on you. I just can't believe it. It's a lot to take in. But I do feel I had to tell you. We've been concerned about Jessi for quite some time. Knowing that she's here with your family now... I don't think any of us want someone so... ...unpredictable getting closer to Kyle. Are you OK? She was so upset. I just hope she's all right. This is why he's extraordinary. He's only concerned about her. So is it off-limits, or can you tell us what you're working on at Latnok now? Unbelievable. What's with this super perky friendly routine? I'm showing interest. I'm being nice. That's so not like you. I think it's sweet that you're trying to connect with me - as Declan's ex-girlfriend. - See? I'm sweet. I'm trying to connect. And in answer to your question, I've got a bunch of new ideas, too soon to discuss. You have to run them by Cassidy? Why all this interest in Cassidy? I just want to get a sense of your life. I don't like him. He didn't want me to date you at first, and he didn't exactly threaten me, but we got pretty close to Don Corleone territory. - The guy creeps me out. - How weird. Kyle, I know tonight didn't work out the way we'd hoped. We all want the best for Jessi. But clearly, she's a very troubled girl. And you've spent an excessive amount of time being her anchor. That has got to be draing. She's my friend. I'd do anything for her. You're a good man. I just don't want her instability jeopardize your future. We never had a chance to talk about that... I'd still like to. Maybe we can meet later. That would be wonderful. The Rack? Half an hour? Sounds like a plan. OK, - the coast is clear. - I always pictured the fairy-tale ending to the perfect date as me climbing through your sister's window. I wish I could beam you up to maintain the theme of our evening. Anyway, let's move. Yes, sir. He's coming. Dad! How's it going? Is Star Trek night over already? What happened? Did you get mopey again? No, it was great. You were right. Andy loved the whole super-galactic send-off. - Genius idea. - Then why...? Let me explain. Josh, I can't believe you... ...look so tired. I'll go tell your mother that you're home and that you're going straight to bed. To sleep. So this is it. My domain. You must study a lot. There's always someone studying more. Why do you make everything a competion? Direct. Sorry. No, I think I need that. You should call me on my stuff. It's good. Can I get you anything? I could use a soda. Machine's right downstairs. Your beverage, milady. Thank you. - You OK? - Fine. Hello? Is anyone here? Kyle? Jessi. Where is everyone? We closed early. - I don't know what it is you want. - The truth. I know you killed Sarah. Why? Sarah left. Now I'm sorry she couldn't handle being your mother. Don't you dare speak of her that way. She didn't leave me, you killed her. You need help. Actually, I think you do. See what's happening to the water? I can do that to you. I can manipulate the blood flow in your body. - What? - I can target certain areas and make the vessels expand and contract. - Jessi, listen... - Why did she have to die? I suggest that you answer me. You don't want to accept that Sarah left. I had nothing to do with it! What are you doing? Stop! Don't! You need to calm down. He murdered my mother! Stay out of it. It didn't happen that way. What are you saying? You want the truth? Sarah attacked me. What? She saw me that night! She knew I was Latnok. She was gonna kill me. She lost it! I was protecting myself. I had no choice. You're lying. I can tell that you're lying. It makes no sense. You need to tell her what's going on. Baylin's experiment, prolonged gestation in a pod. We're starting it up again. The experiment. Why would you do that? I'm looking at the reason, you're a success. Sarah found out. She didn't approve. So you killed her! You took everything from me! My mother! And now Kyle! Jessi, don't! You know what I did. You can't even look at me anymore. That's not true. We can get through this. No. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm already a murder. Speak to me. - Kyle, she's... - No, don't say it! Please. It didn't work. Jessi, please! Breathe! Kyle, I got nothing, man. I got nothing. Come on, we gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here. - I won't leave her. - Kyle, you can't be here. You can't be here, man. I'm sorry. They're gone. Are you all right? I slowed my heartbeat down to two beats per minute. And it was strangely relaxing. You better go. Nicole's waiting for you at home. Do you think we convinced Cassidy? But he'll send people to clean up the mess. Won't they tell him they didn't find my body? Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'm so happy you're home. Are you all right? Oh, I'm fine. Kyle explained the trick you were pulling on Cassidy. I just wish I'd known about it from the beginning. We didn't want to worry you. Well, that part of your plan was unsuccessful. I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about what happened to me that night. No, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. And the way I reacted... You know you can always count on me. I was just so surprised, hearing it like that. Well, that's why I decided to tell Kyle before. When we were planning all this, he said, "No surprises." And... that was the one secret I never shared. So I told him. And... he understood. He always does. So... how did it go at The Rack? Just like we wanted. I don't like that Kyle's still out there with Cassidy. Kyle can handle him. We had fooled Cassidy, and he revealed my biggest challenge,</i> Latnok was re-starting Adam's experiment.</i> I had to stop them. I had to keep up the charade. It was an accident. - You know that, don't you? - That still doesn't change - what happened. - She was gonna kill me. You saved my life. I promise I will take care of this. I will take care of you. But you need to pull it together, go home. Tell them you met with me, but you never saw Jessi. Look at me. Look at me. I'll make sure there is no trace of what happened. This never happened. As far as anyone's concerned, Jessi ran away and she's not coming back. Do you understand? Yes. We're in this together now, Kyle. And together, there is nothing that we can't do. But we need to trust each other. I trust you. Do you trust me? I hadn't had much experience lying. Do you trust me?
