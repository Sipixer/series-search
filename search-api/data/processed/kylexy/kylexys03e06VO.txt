- You could never lose me. - I already have. I'm Cassidy. There is a foreign hottie who seems into you. - You're available. - I guess. Guess? Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of? - Only Kyle. - Kyle? I'm sorry, I really am, but it, the sex, is done. Why would you invite Lori Trager here if you were meeting me? - I see the problem. - You told me not to see her. I thought you'd be happy. Watch out! We've done all we can. Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.</i> Think it could help Nicole? There is one place you might be able to get some. - My mother is dying. - I have what you need. - I can get it to you. - Thank you. But you have to do something for me. Join us. At Latnok. It's your choice. I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today because I knew it could save Nicole's life. Now, if you ever harm him or anyone else in that family, I'll kill you. She's gonna be OK. Thank you. How's Mrs. Trager? She's okay. Getting her strength back slowly. - We're taking good care of her. - That's great. I was gonna come by. I mean, I should have. - But I was really busy at work. - That's okay. You don't have to avoid The Rack, you know. - Oh, I'm not avoiding it. - Because, even though we're not... It doesn't mean you have to give up smoothies. I'd still make you one if you wanted me to. Amanda, I still like smoothies. - You do? - Of course. - I've just been busy. - Right. Sure. - How about lasagna? - A lasagna smoothie? I could make one and bring it by. - Want to make lasagna for me? - For the family. Your mom probably doesn't feel like cooking nowadays. That'd be great. - Well, I gotta... - Me too. Lasagna! - What did she want? - Were you listening? No. I was watching. She just wanted to say hello. What's the point in dumping you if she still wants to talk? - She was being polite. - She broke up with you and hurt your feelings. That's not very polite. I'm getting over it. I'm trying. Today should help take your mind off it. I don't want the family to know I'm going to Latnok. - I don't want to upset Nicole. - Then don't go. I've made a deal. And I've seen what they're capable of. If I don't go today, it won't be the end of it. So you won't say anything? I won't. I'm glad I can count on you. 6th Race - XY BelXander and MiniBen314 Saison 03 Episode 06 Welcome to Latnok Forom.com & U-sub.net I've waited a long time for this day. Why are we at a university? What did you expect, to go to my underground lair? It wouldn't surprise me. Well, maybe this will. I know your previous impressions of Latnok have been not so great, but I'm determined to change all that. I want you to see that we're not about stuffy suits or mad scientists. What are you about? The future. These are the best and brightest minds on campus, but none of them hold a candle to you. What do they know about me? I told them you're a genius. A prodigy. A real find. But that's all they know. As far as they're concerned, you're just my latest recruit. The one I wanted most of all. That sounds pretty. Thanks. I'm writing a song for my mom. Don't you want her to feel better? Yeah, that's why I'm... Don't you have anything else you could be doing, like magically lighting small animals on fire? - Why would I do that? - It's a joke. Never mind. I need a favor. And you've teed it up so successfully. Please don't tell Kyle anything about Cassidy. Finally you've opened your eyes up to the hotness next door. So you won't tell him? Why do you care if Kyle knows you've been seeing Cassidy? I just don't think he'd like it. Whatever. But my silence comes with a price. The keys to your apartment. Mark and I need privacy. But it's mine. And yet you want me to keep your secret. What a predicament. I thought you were done being mean to me. This isn't mean. This is sibling politics. Kill or be killed. Ask Josh. So do we have a deal or what? We have a deal. You look great. How do you feel? I can finally go up and down the stairs without feeling like a Ginsu knife is piercing me in the lungs, so pretty good. Scratch that. - What's that? - Hospital bill. How much? Too many pages... Oh, my God. - Is that before insurance? - I wish. Stephen, we don't have this kind of money. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do about what? Dinner. You know what? I... I don't feel like cooking. Is she okay? She'll be fine. Don't worry about it. - Is this sponsored by the university? - The university gives us the space in exchange for bragging rights generated by our ideas. What kind of ideas? Advances in science, technology. Working towards a better more sophisticated civilization. I don't have a great history with people who say that. Yeah, well, forget about everybody else. We're the real deal. And this lovely little pixie is Jackie. Who holds the record for darts, Guitar Hero and the longest keg stand. Let me know if I can kick your ass at any of them later, cutie. - What's she working on? - Nuclear suitcase bomb. Plants, mate. Growth patterns. My goal is to accelerate the maturation period. A system like hers could help eradicate world hunger. Have you considered binding FT proteins to activate the nucleus of the meristem cells? No. No, I haven't. So, the great mind has finally come to play with us mortals. Yeah, most people open with "hello," but that will work. Nathanial Harrison, Kyle Trager. - Hello. - Hello. And goodbye. I've got work to do. Why don't you tell Kyle here what you're working on? Maybe he can help. No offense, Boy Genius, but I graduated high school at 13, and I have an IQ of 156. I think I got it. Nate considers himself top dog around here. He thinks I'm an idiot because I have the IQ of a normal person. I don't take it personally. I've got better hair. So, make yourself at home. Get to know everyone. I believe you already know... I'm glad we finally got you in here. Easy there. You're hitting a little too close to the Promised Land. I love the never-ending role reversal. - The who? - With us. First it was you who didn't want to... you know. Then... it was me. Now it's you. Wait a minute. Were those little twinkly finger maneuvers is your way of telling me that you've changed your mind? I don't know. Would that be such a bad thing? Are you testing me? Is this a test? Josh, I'm not testing you. I just missed you. I missed you, too. Really bad. Josh, I need to... - have an exorcism! - Don't you knock? - Don't you lock? - It's okay. You can look. I'm so, so, so sorry. - But I need to talk to you. - Now? My cue to leave. Did you get a <i>How to Screw Your Brother Over</i> handbook the day I was born? No, but you were lucky it was me and not Mom! Which is what I wanted to talk to you about. - Is there something wrong? - Yeah. I caught a glimpse of the hospital bill. - They can't pay it. - How do you know that? They walked me through the finally finances when they made their will. - They have a will? - Yes, idiot, and now we have a problem. So, where's our chief problem solver? I've been involved for two years. I know I didn't tell you or Lori. I swear to you, I met her totally by accident. Lori needs to know. Okay. You're right. I'll tell her. I know this is a bit overwhelming for you, your first day and all, but we're good people here. And we have the best resources available. It's all about discovery and opportunity. - Scientific and financial. - Financial? We're encouraged to chase grants and enter competitions. For myself, I cleared more than 80,000 last year. So, have we won you over yet? See you later. I'm here to pay a debt, keep my word. Beyond that, I have no interest in being part of this. If you can't let go of past impressions, your time here is not going to be productive. So go home. Seriously, go home. Sleep on it. If you're not back tomorrow morning, then so be it. Debt paid. Deal? Deal. There has to be something we can do. We were hoping you could help us figure that out. - Where's Jessi? - Out. We figured this was the one place we could privately summit without Mom and Dad stumbling in. So, what's our strategy? I make minimum wage, and this slacker over here doesn't work at all. I could take my guitar and play on a street corner. You'd do better without the guitar. Okay, enough kidding around. We're talking thousands of dollars here. We're never gonna come up with that kind of cash. I have an idea. I had been released from my debt to Cassidy,</i> but now a new debt had arrived. What was the price I'd have to pay for the situation I had created?</i> And, in the end, would it be worth it?</i> I had no way of knowing. But I also knew I had no choice. Hello, this is Cassidy. Please leave a message.</i> Cassidy, it's Kyle. I'll be back tomorrow. Good morning. I need to know about all available competitions with a cash prize. Suddenly the entrepreneur, right? No problem. Mark can help you with that. A hoverboard competition. - The deadline's... - Thirty-six hours and 23 minutes. Judged here on campus. It's exactly what I need. No, I think what you need is a breath. I know how smart you are, but even if you manage to construct the prototype, but it's highly unlikely, the real question is whether it will work. Nate's been jamming on this for a year. - He's still working the bugs out. - I have to try. I really... If you could just show me where I could work. Yeah... we'll set you up a station here. So, head over heels or a broken heart? Most songs are about one or the other. - How do you know I'm writing a song? - I know you pretty well. Yes, you do. I'm hoping if I write enough songs, I can sell one of them. So, which one is it? She's gonna make me say it. How's that guy, Mark? That guy, Mark, is... good. Good. And you are...? - Good. - Good. I guess I'll see you around. Sounds like a whole lot of goodness going on around here. I'm hoping we can move past the awkward stage. One minute you're telling each other everything, and the next you don't know what to say. Exactly. Just because you break up with a guy doesn't mean you stop - having feelings for him. - I know. I don't want to, but sometimes I still do. I just... I can't get past the whole Jessi thing. Kyle does not have feelings for Jessi. Trust me, I would kill him. She's after him. Jessi's the kind of girl who gets what she wants. Jessi likes someone else now. She does? She's over Kyle. So... maybe, you don't have to be. Jessi's got a sweet secret pad. What's all this? Everything I can afford to part with and not walk around naked. And why is it here? Cause if I'm gonna sell everything I own online, I don't want my parents to know. That's where you come in. Not remotely following. You'll be my boxer-shipper. I thought you brought me here for more exciting purposes. That can be the reward for a job well done. How did you get the keys to this place, anyway? Lori blackmailed them out of Jessi, I blackmailed 'em out of Lori. - What do you have on Lori? - Nothing. I just inferred things. She's a guilty person. You're so cute when you're being diabolical. I just really want to help my mom. I know you do. And I'm happy to help. But maybe we can get to the reward part first? Someone's in a rush to get to the good stuff. Here we are, alone in our secret little apartment. No fears of getting caught. Do you have any idea how many couples would kill for a deal like this? Or how much they'd pay for it. You're a genius! Apparently, now I'm also a pimp. You really think you can build a working prototype in less than 2 days? Seems like maybe you're not as smart as they think you are. - Maybe so. - This isn't like playing with Legos. There's no way you can finish. Your board is burning. - What was that for? - My tomato plants doubled their growth in 12 hours. - That's amazing. - Thanks to you. - You're so nice. - Well, why wouldn't I be? How are you feeling? - Much better. - Good, because I have some news. I made a decision. I've been thinking about it. - I'm not gonna go to college. - What? It doesn't make sense for me to spend 4 years in school when all I care about is my music. Plus, it's so expensive. You know I love you and I try to respect your life choices, but this is a non-starter for me. - But... - Please don't make me play the mom who just got out of the hospital and has a weak heart card. Okay. You need time to process. There's not enough time in the world for this one. - Let me get that. - I've got it. I've got it. All right. Suit yourself. - Let me get it. - I've got... I've got it. You're not supposed to get it. Why not? Because we're supposed to treat you delicately until you feel better. Who told you that? Since when do you listen to Lori? I guess you're right. Okay, so, where are you coming from? - I was out. - Just wandering the streets aimlessly? Why would I do that? No, I meant you could tell me more if you want to. No, I can't. Why not? Because I'm not supposed to upset you. Lori again? What does he think would upset me? I really shouldn't be talking to you about this. I think you should. I think I did something really bad. And I don't want Kyle to know, but I'm worried that what I did might affect what he's doing, and then he won't realize what's being done. What happened? Tell me. I can't believe you're working with them.</i> It was the only way to get you help when you were so sick. - I had to make the deal. - Now you need to unmake it. I'm serious, Kyle. I don't want you involved with those people. - It's not as bad as you think. - Not as bad? They followed you, they toyed with you, they kidnapped Amanda! - So far there's been nothing... - No, don't do that. Don't tell me anything other than that your relationship with them is over. It can't be over. I'm sorry. How could you tell her? I was worried. I don't like that you're involved with them. I don't like that I'm involved with them! But I have to be. Why? Why can't you just walk away? I had the chance, but Stephen and Nicole ran into money trouble, so now I can't. Money trouble? Yes. The hospital bill is really high. I didn't know that. I have to help them, no matter what it takes. Why are you always helping people, even if it's hurting you? Because that's what you do, Jessi. - That's what people do. - But Cassidy's a bad person. I don't trust him. What do you know about Cassidy? What do you know about Cassidy? I met him awhile ago. He didn't tell me he was part of Latnok, at first. - What did he tell you? - I thought he was my neighbor. He lived down the hall from Sarah's apartment, probably as a way of keeping tabs on me. He told me that Latnok is changing and that you and I can help with that change. - And you believed him? - I didn't know what to believe. Sarah hated them, but then she left. He was there, being so kind and supportive and telling me how important we both were to the future. When Nicole got injured and she needed help... - You suggested I go see him. - You would have gone anyway. But you encouraged me without telling me the whole story! You did exactly what Cassidy wanted! I'm sorry. I'm working with the people I trust least in this world. I never thought you'd be just like them. Hello? An appointment for what? What apartment? Hello? That was one of Josh's friends, canceling a 10:30 appointment. What appointment? He hung up. Said something about an apartment. What do you know about this? Nothing. Not a thing. Zero. You want to try that again? Four-ninety-eight, four-ninety-nine, five hundred. Not bad. Except for the fact I've had to clean this place five times in the past 24 hours. - We could hire a maid. - No, that'd cut into our profits. The last party left the bathroom looking like a chunk-style soup factory exploded. I've still got to scrub the toilet before the 10:30. 10:46. - Maybe they're not coming. - Well, they'd better come! One appointment is 50$ less stress my mom has to worry about. Amen. I'll get the door, you manage the facilities. Don't think you guys'll get out of paying full price. What, exactly, are we paying full price for? Dad! Mom! Great to see you! - Andy. - Leaving. Now. I'm late for my family summit, which hopefully goes better than this is about to. - What is going on here? - A little entrepreneurial venture. - Are you in some kind of trouble? - You mean before right now? Why would you need money? Andy's birthday. - She's expecting diamonds. - Well, then start mining. Cause you're gonna give all this money back, and you're gonna clear out of here immediately. - I just wanted to... - Just wanted to what? Tell us, please, because we really want to understand. Nothing. I'm sorry. I suck. Am I on too many painkillers, or is there something seriously wrong with our children? Don't you ever sleep? This has to be done. You know, I know you're only into it for the prize money now, but, Kyle, I really think you're gonna like it here. - Why? - Well... I know, for me, it is the first time I can remember, I'm in a place where I'm not this super-smart outsider. We all are. It's my home. I guess I have a different definition of home. Speaking of, I haven't talked to Lori yet. Do you have any tips on how to keep her from hating me? You're asking the wrong person about keeping secrets from his girlfriend. - Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend? - Not anymore. - Is she hot? - Amanda's a nice girl, Nate. In other words, totally off-limits to you. Amanda? - That's a pretty name. - Leave her out of this. What's this? You're not satisfied with moving into my project? You've got to steal my materials now, too? - I didn't steal them. - Cassidy told him - he could use our supplies. - Was I talking to you? Look, you can't just waltz in here and take over. - I don't want to take over anything. - Who are you, anyway? Where'd you come from and where'd you learn to make that? - I'm self-taught. - That's impossible. Is this kindergarten? We share. We help each other. Well, I'm not helping him. Kyle isn't here. I'm not here to see Kyle. I made a lasagna. To help out. Okay. I'll take it. - I told you, Kyle isn't here. - And I said I'm not here to see him. Is that why your eyes are darting all over for him? Why do you even care? You already have a new boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. That's what Lori said. Here. Just take the stupid lasagna. I heard about the Nate thing. Sorry about that. Ignore him. Should I ignore that you were conspiring with Jessi to get me in here? She told you about that, huh? - Good. - Good? We've liked the idea of her here for awhile, but so far she hasn't proved to be a very trustworthy girl. I'm glad to hear that she's honest with you. Maybe there is room for both of you here. I don't want Jessi to have any part of this. Not after everything you've done to her. And to me. You have to understand, they wanted you here desperately. - Who? - The old guard, stuffy suits. They put enormous pressure on me to bring you in. They wanted their greatest achievement on their side. You still haven't even told me for what. Do you not see? That's for you to determine. Inspire them. Be inspired. Shape the future. With you on board there are no limits. But I'm not on board. I'm only here to help my family. What can I do to convince you? How can we earn your trust? You can't. What happened? Nate. Bye-bye. Jerk. You don't even know what you just did. I probably don't care, either. Nate, for God's sake, man, shut it. - Kyle, we can fix this. - I don't want you to fix it. You all talk about being family, taking care of your own. Well, I'm going to take care of mine. Kyle, wait. Don't. Aren't those Dad's old speakers? Yes. I need the magnets to make the board levitate. He's gonna kill you, you know. I tried yours first, but they weren't big enough. That's... You what? Oh, bro! We've got to talk about the concept of personal property. I thought Latnok had unlimited resources. - I had a setback with them. - The competition's tomorrow. And - you don't have the right materials. - I know that. Why don't you just levitate with the board? 'Cause that would be cheating. One day we'll discuss this sporadic morals thing you've got going. I'll have the test scores in by tomorrow. Yeah, thanks, you too. So do I want to know why half the kitchen appliances are on the driveway? - Science project. - For what? For fun. You know Kyle. Loves to have fun with science. Good times. - Oh, hi. - Hi, Mom. Child number one is acting deceptively vague again. What is up with them? Oh, child number four makes an appearance. Sarah's been sending me these for expenses. Jessi, this is a lot of money. We need to open up a bank account for you. Actually, I wanted to give it to you guys. No, this is for you. This is her way of taking care of you. But she doesn't. You do. I should pay rent. You're living here as part of our family. None of the other kids pay rent, so why should you? Why's everybody so concerned about money lately? Oh, no. - What? - The bill. You all know about the bill. Okay, what's going on? I know you know about the hospital bill. I'm trying to win a science competition so I can pay your hospital bill. That's why I went to Latnok. If I win it I can make the money you owe. How am I supposed to feel, knowing this is the price you're paying for saving my life? I am the adult here. It is my job. It is my responsibility to take care of all of you. But it's my fault. I was driving, and I wasn't paying attention. I was thinking about Adam's death, and what Foss said that night, and I made the wrong turn. I wasn't focused, and that's when we ran off the road. Is that what you think? That you're responsible for this? Yes. Because it's true. So I'm finishing this project, I'm winning this competition tomorrow, and I'm fixing this problem that I caused. And I'm sorry if you're not okay with it, but, I won't let you stop me. I won't stop you. I just don't think it had to be this way. So I hear you're solving the world's problems. I know Nicole's upset, but I'm doing this. Actually, I was just wondering if there's anything I can do to help. Where do you need me? Okay. Here we go. Dude, you're floating. Steady, steady. - How's it look? - Good. Magnets are running a little hot, but they're OK. We need to prime the fields. - Kyle, you're flying. - Okay, let me go. What? You sure? - Looking good, Tragers. - Steady, steady. I can't compensate! Stephen, shut it down. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - The board isn't. - We can fix it. - Is there time? It's not about time. It's the magnets. They're not pure enough. I was hoping we could mimic their chemical makeup, - but we couldn't. - Industrial magnets cost thousands of dollars. They're not easy to come by. - I know where we could get some. - No. You're not asking them for anything anymore. I don't care what the consequences are. - But we... - Kyle, please. Then it's over. We're done. Jessi, I don't really feel like talking. I don't need to talk. I just want you to have this. - Did you get this from Cassidy? - No. I cashed the checks that Sarah sent me. Then I tracked down an online supplier who sold me the magnets for half the market value. - Do you think it will work? - I don't know. But at least now we have a chance. - Thank you. - You're welcome. No, we've got it. We've got pens for everyone. I'll start final assembly. - Well, you good? - Yeah. Praying won't help you now, newbie. Look, I don't quite know how it went down, but we can assume that whatever happened, Nate was out of line. We've all been there. So where do you need us? Look, he's all confused. We're here to help you. - I'd like that. - Cool. This is the main frame. I'm gonna need those, too. Now, taking the stage, our final two contestants,</i> Kyle Trager and Nate Harrison. The current leader had an elevation level of five feet,</i> six and one half inches, 22.4 second duration.</i> Followed closely by five feet, three inches and 19 seconds.</i> You're just the girl I need to talk to. - What are you doing here? - It's a long story that ends with me telling you that I've liked you since the minute we met. Which doesn't excuse the fact that I didn't tell you this before now. - I know. - Tell me what? The Latnok organization? The one Kyle's working with? I'm a part of it. You're... what? Don't. I can't deal with this right now. We'll talk about it later. You know, when you paint a loser gold, you still know what's inside. I'm just saying. All right. Begin. I hope that thing doesn't explode. "Experimental" and "prototype" are just synonyms for "kaboom." Cream always rises to the top. We have a 50,000 dollar grand prize winner.</i> Round one goes to you. - There doesn't have to be a round two. - Don't be so sure about that. - That was amazing. - Great job. Kyle, that was so awesome. Dude. Congratulations, Kyle. Everything has a price. I had paid mine, certain of the outcome.</i> And yet, here I was, wondering if, possibly, I had been wrong.</i> Why are you in such a good mood? Cleaning up other people's trash is punishment. Two reasons. One, Kyle saved the day and we're not on the verge of bankruptcy anymore. I thought we'd have to sell the house and move, which would've sucked. And two, after we're done cleaning, we have the apartment all to ourselves. A swing and a miss. Josh, we need to talk. No. Role reversal again? I wish. I have some really bad news. Hey, what's the matter? You're not sick again, are you? Please tell me you're not, 'cause I know you rely on me to be strong, and I don't know if I can handle that. It's not the cancer. It's worse. What could be worse than that? Cleveland. Excuse me? You may not be moving, but I am. My mom got a job she couldn't pass up. We move at the end of the month. You can't move. What about us? We're closed. I'm the kind of guy who can't take no for an answer. Except I'm tired and I really want to go home. You don't look tired. But I'll get out of your hair. Slink sadly home to ponder the sad state of life without a caffeine buzz. The pity strategy. Nice. This is for telling me I don't look tired. You're saving my life. I'm Nate. - Amanda. - Amanda. That's a pretty name. Come in. Did you win? Are you still mad? I don't want to be. Help me understand. You knew better, yet you did it anyway. I never wanted to hurt you. You're the most important person to me in the world. I just... I wanted to be accepted by them, and I let him manipulate me. Why would you want to be involved with them at all? Because it... would have been something that you and I shared. - Jessi, we share a lot of things. - Not enough. I wanted more. I need to trust that you'll always be honest with me. Otherwise, we won't share anything. In that case... I guess you should know Amanda came by. She did? - When? - The other day. Why didn't you tell me? 'Cause I think that she still likes you. What does that have to... Wait, she does? What does that have to do with you not telling me? What is it? Why didn't you tell me about Amanda?
