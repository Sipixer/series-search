longer in his mother's womb. That's why he was smarter. I worked years developing an artificial womb.</i> It was supported by a secret group known as Latnok. When you first came here, everything in the world was new. Adam created me, but you are my family. I saw you kissing Jessi. It just wouldn't be appropriate. It won't happen again. When you kissed me, I felt such a rush. Didn't you feel it? My heart says there's still something there. As much as I want us to be together, we can't. - My Mom's changed our plans. - Josh doesn't know?</i> This is our last night together. No heartfelt goodbyes. Tonight is about you and me. You're going straight to bed. - Who are you? - Michael Cassidy. They put enormous pressure on me to bring you in. They wanted their greatest achievement on their side. Why the interest in Cassidy? I don't like him. The guy creeps me out. You know what I would like to hear about? My mother. I think it's beholding upon me to tell you what sort of person you have living under your roof. After the explosion, she came across a man camping.</i> And she killed him. - Oh, my God. - It's in her nature. He murdered my mother. She knew I was Latnok. She was gonna kill me. Baylin's experiment... we're starting it up again. Sarah found out. I'm already a murderer! - How did it go at the Rack? - Just like we wanted.</i> - Kyle's still out there with Cassidy. - Kyle can handle him. You saved my life. I will take care of this. Do you trust me? I do. Ruse. Charade. Deception. No matter how you define the words, they begin and end with a lie.</i> Here you go, mate. My mum always said tea was medicine for the soul. How are you feeling? How should I feel? It's going to take some going through. You've been through a lot tonight. What are you going to tell everyone else at Latnok? This group here don't need to know anything other than what you're gonna tell your family about Jessi running away. But the senior members, they know. - You told them already? - It's my job, mate. Got to keep them up to speed. But they're not even care that Jessi's dead? You have to understand. You're their guy. You always have been. Come on. I want to show you something. - Was this mine? - The one and only. Took a little maneuvering to rebuild it after the explosion at Zzyzx, but, but that's why our young geniuses come in so handy. They rebuilt this? Not exactly. They built it in pieces. Mark's algorithms. Nate's hoverboard magnets. Everyone contributed something. You tricked them. Their inventions had practical applications. - That's all they needed to know. - What did I give you? I'm sure you can figure it out. The growth accelerant that Nate and I developed. - Helps with muscle growth. - Why didn't you just tell me that this is what you were doing when you brought me in? How would you have felt about that? If Zzyzx had their way, I would have spent my entire life in this pod as some type of bio-computer. That's not the kind of technology you want falling into the wrong hands. There's your answer. They knew you wouldn't approve. They were right. But... you don't really have a choice in the matter, do you? Unless you want everyone you know to know the truth about what you did to Jessi. Is that what this is? More blackmail? I like to think of it as self-preservation. We gonna have a problem with that? Look, in a couple of days, Latnok are gonna have a warehouse full of specimens in gestation to keep them occupied. They already have everything they need? I have everything they need. I give it to them... they leave you alone. Consider this your freedom. My gift to you. My lies had brought me an offer of freedom.</i> But now Adam's misguided experiment was in the hands of a blackmailer... a murderer. I knew I wouldn't truly be free until I stopped him.</i> 6th Race - XY BelXander and MiniBen314 Saison 03 Episode 10 Bringing Down the House Forom.com & U-sub.net Thank God. You're okay? It worked. I got him to tell me everything. - What did he say? - I'll explain it all, I promise. But I need to see Jessi. I need to know that she's okay. I'm okay. Your arms are growing. They are? They're at least a half-centimeter bigger in circumference. Have you increased your exercise regimen? Maybe a little. Your... Your pectoral muscles are also expanding. What? Your hand... feels nice. Does this one, too? Did you just shock me? No. Why would I shock you? I don't know. I... I felt a charge go through my body. - That's your libido. - What? No it isn't. I would have felt that before. You never felt a charge with Amanda? I felt other things. Well, maybe there was a power surge in the area. Maybe. So, how did you sleep last night? I didn't. Neither did I. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I'm sure it wasn't easy... confronting Cassidy about Sarah. I was acting. I'm fine. I promise. There's that power surge again. Josh is still asleep, but I talked to Lori about what's going on. I'll finish getting dressed and be right out. I'll be in the other room, pretending to be dead. I'm not happy about this. I'm sorry. Jessi came in, and things got weird. But, - It won't happen again. - Not that. Well, yes, that. But more importantly, I don't like this game you guys are playing with Cassidy. It's dangerous. I don't like it either. I've given you a lot of leeway in the past, but this just feels different. There's something about it. Something about Cassidy... He scares me. I'm going to take care of it. I promise. I need it to be over. We can't keep doing this to our family. Hide and seek with parents downstairs is not cool. Straight to voice mail? Not cool. Leaving without saying goodbye? Even less cool. What's wrong with you? Call me back. Can anyone help me figure out how to throttle my girlfriend long-distance? - Why long-distance? - Because she left. Vamoosed. Hitched a ride on the a-train to Cleveland. She didn't even have the courage to tell me in person. She left this on my pillow. On your pillow? Ask Dad. Oh, I will. Mom? Are you okay? You know what? Yeah. If she's just gonna up and leave like that, forget her. I'm fine. Dandy. Copa-freakin'-cetic. She was probably afraid to say goodbye. Then she's a coward. Good riddance. Josh, I'm sorry. But there's something else we need to talk about... Here's what I have so far. Leave it open. Well... In order to fill, say, 100 pods, Cassidy would need at least 5,000 gallons of formula on hand. Not to mention the space he'd need to house the pods. I ran a search, and there are over 5300 warehouses in Seattle that are big enough. The formula would have to be kept at a certain temperature in order to sustain its nutritional elements... probably a few degrees below body temperature. That's a way to narrow it down. We can access the city police's thermal imaging scans, like how they find the people growing the weed. - The weed? - Yeah, the... The blaze. The herb. The chronic. - Where did you pick that up? - Cable. Once we find where they're hiding the formula, we need to sabotage it so that it doesn't work. And destroy any way of re-creating it. What about the pods? How do we destroy them? We won't need to. Without the formula, they're useless. Where? I hear her heartbeat. You're still listening for her heartbeat? It comes naturally now. She's coming to the window. You've gotta go. She can't see you. You're supposed to be missing. Hi. I'm sorry. I know this is weird, but I really need to talk to you and I don't want anyone else to know about it. What happened? Here, come in. - I think you were right about Nate. - What did he do? I found all this odd research in his dorm room. You were in his dorm room? I saw the number from the Ouija board. When you asked what your birthday was? 7 8 1 2 2 7. There were drawings of these chambers... that could carry a baby without a birth mother. Or an umbilical cord. Your father's name, Adam Baylin, was everywhere. I know you have secrets, and I try not to pry, but Kyle, - it's like he was studying your life. - Does he know you saw all of this? You said there were people who would use those you care about to get to you. Is he one of them? I think he might be. Why do I always do this? Why do I always get involved with the lying, cheating jerks? I'm sorry. Amanda, I need you to stay away from him. I can't guarantee it's safe to be around him. What? It's you. The Charlies, the Nates of this world... those are the real jerks. You, no matter what, are one of the good guys. I always knew you were. Even when I thought I didn't. I try to be. You are. Kissing Amanda, I felt a rolling flutter deep inside.</i> I'd heard the term before, 'butterflies.' How was it possible to feel electricity for one person</i> and butterflies for another? I think Cassidy has Adam's data stored on an isolated server at the university. I saw the system last night. If I can get back in there, I can swap it out with a dummy drive and figure out if he made any back-ups. I need to get rid of all of them. Don't you think Cassidy would be watching you closely? I'll need some sort of distraction. You can't go. - You're dead. - I know. And dead girls get stuck in the house doing thermal scans of Seattle's industrial district. I almost hate to suggest it, but what about Mark? We don't know if we can fully trust him yet. I do. I mean, based on my little recon mission last night, we know he's no fan of Cassidy's. And I know it's not my life we're talking about, but, your secret is my secret, too. It's all of ours. Do we have to spend the rest of our lives not ever letting anyone else in? This situation is too extreme, Lori. No matter how much you care about him. The problem is, we don't have anyone else who has an excuse to be in Latnok. That's not entirely true. What is this, Bring Your Mother to Work Day? I'm sorry, Michael. I hate to bother you like this, but, can I speak to you? It's about last night. I know I wasn't the best dinner guest, but I didn't think my behavior - warranted a house call. - No, it's Jessi. She never came home. I see. I'm sorry. Come in. Thanks. So, she wasn't at her apartment? First place I checked. I don't know why I thought she might come here, especially after your confrontation. But, I didn't know where else to look. Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my fault. Oh, please, no. It's not the first time she's run away, unfortunately... - Where did she go the last time? - The woods. It's a long story, and yes, we've already looked. She's had a rough go of it. You used to counsel her, didn't you? Is there a problem? No, not at all. It's just... It's a bit of a sore subject. I received a warning for taking her in. I almost lost my license. Well, she was very lucky to have had you helping her. Thank you. It's nice to feel appreciated. You've done an amazing job with Kyle. All I know, you mean a lot to him. He means a lot to us. Are you cleaning? In a manner of speaking, yes. I am cleaning my life. I have too many things that remind me of Andy. I am purging... And please don't touch anything. It's all exactly where I want it. Staphylococcus aureus. No. That is in fact a cup. Inside the cup. The bacteria. How long has this been here? Could be this morning... Could be last month... Your room is the perfect environment for it to grow. It's warm, dark, and a little... - Manly? - Dank. Why am I letting you stand in my room and insult me? - Because your dankness... - Manliness. Just gave me an idea of how to disable the formula. I needed to burn Adam's journals to erase his records of the experiment.</i> But I knew I was also burning the only real connection I had</i> to the man who had given me life. And the way he had given it. Thank you for earlier. I'm just glad it's over. According to the hard drive, he made a single backup of data. I think I saw the disc in his safe when I found Sarah's ring. He'll have moved it by now. Maybe to his apartment. Now you're breaking into his apartment? If I don't destroy every trace of this formula, he'll just re-create it. I have to make sure that doesn't happen. I can't help wishing you'd just taken him up on his offer of freedom. They're re-starting the experiment. They're playing God! And if Cassidy is any indication of the kind of people they are, - I don't want them to have that power. - I understand. I do. But the deeper in you get, the more it's changing you. - Changing me? - You fake Jessi's death. You're lying, you're sneaking around, breaking laws... This just isn't you. At least it's not who you used to be. - Thanks for coming with me. - Are you kidding? Being your lookout, breaking into someone's apartment... It's like the old days. I'd be pissed if you hadn't asked me. This is it. I have the keys to Jessi's apartment. I'll go in there, climb through the air-conditioning ducts, and then drop down into Cassidy's. Or, I could just pick the lock. Don't ask. Isn't that breaking and entering? It was okay when you were just entering? Let's see what we find. Cassidy's passport and birth certificate. - In case of a quick getaway, I guess. - He's not using his real name. It says Michael Cassidy Kingsley. Mother, Grace. Father, unknown. Grace Kingsley. Why does that name sound familiar? Grace Kingsley... Grace Kingsley was in Adam's notebooks. She's a member of Latnok. Easy, killer. It's just a game. It's not just a game. It's our game. Mine and Andy's. I thought making things explode would make me feel better, but it only reminded me of how much this sucks. It does suck. Believe me, I know. Lori didn't move thousands of miles away while you were still both in love and leave you without saying goodbye. All she did was reject your sorry ass. I have an idea. Death by porn? Just give me a few minutes. I have to make a call. If his mother knew Adam, then she must have known Sarah. I wonder if she knows her son is a killer. This is everything on the disk. - That's the formula for the fluid. - You found it. - It worked. - What did? The thermal imaging. That facility is storing a large amount of something at the temperature we were tracking. Let's assume we're right, and the existing formula is there. I'll go, add your bacteria to the fluid, then get out before anyone knows I was there. I wish I could go with you. I do, too. We should see what else is on the disk before we destroy it. The pod schematics. Step one. Genome insertion. Step two. Clone development. Clone? I thought they used human embryos. That's the way it's always been done. They must be using someone's genetic sequence to create a clone. - 7 8 1 2 2 7. - That's impossible. Latnok isn't planning to gestate babies in those pods. They're making clones... of me. - You've got to be kidding me. - Is that even possible? It never was before. Now with the pods and the formula, the development process is a more regulated environment. I can't even wrap my head around the breach of scientific ethics. It's even worse than just cloning. Jessi and I were in gestation for sixteen years. That's what allowed our brains to develop the way they did. Without all that time, we'd be just like everyone else. So in order for them to create more children like you... They would have to be in the pods for years. But why just you? Why not both of you? They think I'm damaged. I think we've already established how wrong they are. Still, Kyle is special. It's understandable why they would want more like him. If I'm special, it's not because of how I came into this world. It's what happened to me once I was in it. You took me in. You loved me like I was one of your own children. Having you in my life... that's what makes me special. But this, what they're planning, it's robbing someone of their childhood... their connection to a mother... a family. I can't allow that. Which is why we have to make sure it doesn't happen. - Is that mold? - No. Mold is a fungus. This is a bacterial agent that will compound exponentially when introduced into a live organism. It'll basically suffocate any nutritional elements growing in the formula, so it won't allow anything to grow. Of course it will. I have to get going. Just... Be careful. Please. I'll be home soon. Are you sure you don't need back-up? We can't risk anyone seeing you until this is all over. When it is over, what happens with your life? What do you mean? We'll destroy the experiment. And then we can focus on Cassidy. But one day soon, if we're successful, your life will just return to normal. I'm starting to realize my life can never be normal. But it would be nice to get back to some type of constant. Does constant mean Amanda? I don't know what it means. Sorry, Jessi. I wish I did. I wish I could understand how I could have feelings for more than one person. You're saying you have feelings for me? Why would you even have to ask that? - What are you looking for? - Nicole. Why? Good luck. - What happened? - The lamp blew out. I'll fix it. - I rock. - Why do you rock? And why aren't we making me feel any better yet? Maybe this will. Hi. Jackie told me how to hijack the car's navigational system and walk Andy through linking up a video camera. So even though she's on the road in the middle of the country, you get to see your girlfriend. Don't understand that at all, but... thanks, man. Really. You're welcome. Where are you? Some rest stop in North Dakota. Declan totally hacked into our minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one. Your moms are lesbians. How could they not? Are they... listening to me right now? Lucky for you, they took my brothers in to pee. Good, because you are in big trouble, young missy. I know. I totally suck. You totally do. How could you not say goodbye? I chickened out. I couldn't say goodbye to you. I still can't. Well, then it doesn't have to be goodbye. It can be hello with a lot of miles between us. In that case, hello. Hi. You know what? We can say hello every day until I get to see you again. And then every day after that. This should only take about 20 minutes. Just need to cable the system and run a quick diagnostic. No problem. I imagine you're not dropping off another lasagna. - I'll come back later. - Sorry. But you can't leave. - Why? - Because you've seen me. - Not following. - I'm supposed to be missing and if you tell your new boyfriend that I'm not, you'll ruin everything. He's not my boyfriend. He's not anything anymore. I told Kyle I'd stay away from him, but he still has all that stuff about him in his dorm room. - Why didn't you just take it? - I don't know. - Because that would be stealing. - But Nate stole it in the first place. I guess it just didn't occur to me, all right? - I'm not as smart as you. - That's true. I just came to say that Nate's working until ten tonight, so if Kyle wants to get into the room, he can. - Kyle's not home. - Then you do it. - I can't go anywhere. - You still haven't explained that. And I don't plan on it. Look, unfortunately, you're gonna have to do it. Do what? Break into his room and steal his files? I was thinking firebomb, but okay. Almost done. It's just... You don't have to watch. Unless you just like... lurking. Ninety-six percent. Ninety-seven. - Can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you. I'm going to ghost his system. So, basically it'll be like I'm sitting right where you are. Less chance for operator error. Okay. Open up the systems file. I need you to get his IP address. - If you know... - I know what that is. Save the sarcasm. Type it into the "share host" box down at the bottom. And change all the settings to "allow." Perfect. There's a lot of stuff here Nate's been collecting. About Kyle? See for yourself. I've wanted to know his secrets for so long... Here it all is. Yeah, well take a good look. No. When he's ready to tell me, then it'll mean something. For now, this is just weird. Always the good girl. Not all of us can be as wild as you, Jessi. Apparently, you can. Amanda? What's wrong? Nate... This is Cassidy. I caught Kyle's girlfriends going through my stuff. - Girlfriends? - Amanda and Jessi. Jessi. That's impossible. She's... missing. Well, if she was, she isn't anymore. Find out what they know. Shut it down. Mr. Cassidy wants everyone out of here. - I haven't finished yet. - We have orders. We need to check the perimeter. What are you doing? What is this? A bacteria. - A bacteria? Why would you... - Mark. We don't have much time. Do you have any idea what you've been helping Cassidy do? Computerized in-vitro gestational chambers. For women who can't give birth naturally. I wish that's what it was. - What are you talking about? - Cassidy has been using you. Latnok is not what they say they are. And that I need your help. I need you to trust me. Please. I'll distract them. Just do what you need to do and get out. Hello? You're very anxious, for someone who's looking for a dead girl. - I told you, I didn't see anything. - I wish I could believe that. I really do. - Why did you do that? - I thought you could use the help. We have to get the files and get moving. - He's not gonna be out for very long. - Why not? Because you don't hit hard enough. Better? Where are they? What did you do? Relax. They're on their way to the Rack. To meet you, actually. I may not be a genius, but I know how to clone a cell phone. Speaking of, you've put me in quite a bind with your little tricks. Latnok's gonna think I failed them. Failed them? Or failed her? - What? - You know what I'm talking about. So you found out about my mum. You know, if she had her way, you wouldn't still be living this life of yours. Latnok would have complete control over you, and believe me, it's only a matter of time before she figures out how to get what she wants. I was going to convince her to let you go. All because I thought you saved my life. Who knew what a clever little liar you would be? I had no choice. We all have choices. Like how I am choosing to forgive you for what you've done and give you a chance to fix it. Then no one need be any the wiser. Even if I knew how to do that, I wouldn't. Oh, you know. It's all up there in that head of yours. Forgot about that, didn't you? I can think of a few people who probably haven't. But they went about it the wrong way in the past. Anyone with a brain knows there's only one way to get you to cooperate. You figured out what I did to get rid of Sarah. So you know what I'm willing to do to get what I want. We're okay. Nate's still out cold. That ring... looks a lot like the one Kyle wears around his neck. Nate stole it from Cassidy. It belonged to my mother. So I guess you kind of helped me find it. And you saved me, so... I guess we're even? Look, I know we've never really gotten along, but... I don't know. I feel like we might be a little bit closer than before. So I think it's only fair that I tell you... Tell me what? I'm going to tell Kyle I want him back. You really have the nerve to say that? After everything that happened tonight? Like I said, fair warning. You deserve it. You're a lot braver than I thought. Origin...? What is it? I don't believe it. You still wear Adam's Latnok ring. How awfully sentimental. And lucky for me. - Why are you doing this? - Because that is what they want. That's what she wants. And if you try to stop me, I'm just gonna have to keep hurting you. Then, I'm gonna hurt Jessi... until she wishes she had really died. And then, just when you think it couldn't get any worse, I'll hurt everybody that ever mattered to you. Starting with Amanda. How you feelin' about that, mate? Nicole had been right when she said she didn't recognize the person I had become.</i> The person I had been before would have never done this... - You won't do it. - What makes you so sure? Because Grace Kingsley, my mother... What about her? She's your mother, too.
