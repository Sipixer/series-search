He doesn't communicate, and he was found wandering alone in the city. But there is one more thing we should see. - No belly button. - I have a new patient, and I'm bringing him here for a little while. - You don't know him. - Don't want he touches my things. He's a very sweet, very special boy. He's this super brain... with amnesia. He can't understand the simplest things, but does calculus like it's 2 plus 2. He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but somehow speaks Chinese? Mom, I'm telling you, Kyle is not human. 781227. Spelling out your alien birthday? It's you! 1985? The guy in the photo. It's Adam Baylin. Adam Baylin has been missing for 20 years. You gotta stop asking questions! If you don't, you're gonna put your family in danger. - Who are you? - It's Mom. The Peterson's live in Connecticut. I'll be ready to go by tomorrow. Now that I know, I'm ready. You're not telling me something. You've proven you can keep my secrets. If there was anything to tell, don't you think I'd bring you in on it? - Thanks for everything. - Take care, kid. I'll take care of 781227 and Adam Baylin. In the meantime, 781228 is in excellent condition. What did you tell him? To go with the Petersons, it was the only way to keep Tragers out of danger. You two are very good liars. It's our job. I'm Adam Baylin. - What do you want from me? - What would you like to know? Everything. He's home. Home? With his parents. It's okay. It's just another dream. I have a... bad feeling. Kyle's okay. There's nothing to worry about. Come on. - Transcript : swsub.com - - Projet-SG.net | SeriesSub.com - Season 2 Episode 1 - The Prophet - Every story has a beginning. Every life has meaning and potential. But I didn't know my story's beginning, nor realize my true potential, until a few month's ago when I first met Adam Baylin. I've waited a long time to meet you Kyle. There's so much that I want to tell you. There's so much that I want to know. I'll answer all of your questions... at least the ones that I can. I want you to feel at home here. Are you hungry? Would you like something to drink after your trip? Thanks. Try again. What's the trick? There is none. The magic is in your mind. You only need to discover and release it. Teach me. We'll have to start at the beginning. Are you familiar with Einstein's contributions? I've read about him. He was a genius. No question. Why do we think Einstein's was capable of such brilliance and innovation when his peers must have worked just as hard? He had a gift? Or... a head start? The typical gestation period for a human being is 40 weeks. Einstein spent several weeks longer in his mother's womb. His brain had more time to develop. That's why he was smarter? Well, not just smarter. Einstein believed it was why he perceived the universe differently. There've always been rumors that Einstein conducted a series of secret experiments in the 1920s. Allegedly, he tested the idea of extending natural pregnancy, mostly on primates, hoping the animals would develop superior brains. But when the experiments failed, they say that Einstein abandoned the project, although other scientists were still intrigued. They resurrected the experiments in the 1950s, this time without Einstein and under tighter secrecy. They decided to implant human embryos in surrogate human mothers. Did it work? After many failures, there was one successful pregnancy. A healthy 13-month gestation. 13 months? Unfortunately, the surrogate mother died when the child was born. What happened to the child? You're looking at him. Okay, here's the deal. Mom and Dad really need this trip, so you can't do anything to stress them out while they're away. I'm planning a weekend of quiet reflection. Seriously. If you have your loser friends over, don't be total pigs. And keep them out of my room. Don't want their little hands in my underwears. That was one time in sixth grade. God, let it go. Okay, I think we have everything. We don't. Well, Lori is in charge. Not more than one friend over at a time, and no one spends the night. If you're referring to Declan, I don't think that's a concern. Why? Is everything okay with you guys? We're fine... I guess. It's hard to tell what he's thinking nowadays. Forget about things here. Enjoy your weekend. Yeah. Just go. Have fun. It's not like you're counting the minutes or anything. I'm down to seconds. All right. We'll call you later. If you hear from Kyle, make sure he knows I have my cell. And give him the number of the hotel. What? Can we go? Sweet freedom. Give me half. Sorry. Bank's closed. You drew this symbol. For Zzyzx. Zzyzx was my conception, Kyle. My hope at the time was to create children with more sophisticated brains, children who could enlighten the world and advance civilization. So I continued the experiment. Even if it meant harming more surrogate mothers? I didn't. I worked years on developing an artificial womb. Finally, I designed a chamber that I believed could work, and I invented a fluid that would provide oxygen and nourish the embryo placed inside. So there was no need for a natural mother... and obviously, no umbilical cord. And as a result, the child would not have a belly button. You're saying I was gestated inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx. A carefully monitored chamber. So you created me. Yes. My first memory is waking up in the forest, fully grown, covered in that pink fluid you were talking about. How long was I kept inside that chamber? Your whole life. All the fine ladies showed up tonight. Check it out! Party of the year! The party's over. Such a tragedy, Kyle. Ever since you left, the rowdy queen of rebellion has become a total buzzkill. I'm attempting thoughtful, sober, and restrained until Mom and Dad get over you being gone. Dude, you should be here. It's, like, the whole school. Hey, I was talking to Kyle. - Actually, I should go. - Wait. I want to hear how you are. Sorry. We'll talk later. He's always doing that. You cut it too close. I told you. I'm responsible for the security here. Two minutes, Kyle. Two minutes... or Zzyzx can trace the connection. I've been careful. You gotta stop pretending that you're living with your parents in Connecticut. Stop contact with the Tragers. It's too dangerous. It's an unnecessary complication. It's necessary for me. If you didn't like dinner, you could have just said so. What happened? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I just tripped over the table. His IQ's off the charts. His ability to avoid furniture, well, gets him every time. Kyle, this is Brian Taylor, an old friend of mine. Very old. We grew up together. Nice to meet you. Me as well. I've heard... a lot about you. Really? Yeah. He tells me everything. Almost everything. All right, I'll check in on you later. I'll be inside if you need me, all right? Kyle... living here alone, I've... relied on both of them over the years. Taylor's managed to turn my dreams into reality. He brings any useful ideas I have to the outside world, and it's Foss' job to protect me from it. From Zzyzx? Yes. I sent him there to work. He's my eyes and ears. Why did Zzyzx order my termination? I don't know. Years ago, I realized that some of my backers had other plans for the experiment. I protested. They tried to kill me. - So I just disappeared. - But you left me there. Every time that I tried to remove a subject from the chamber, the subject died. You mean the child died. I'm sorry. It's just that... I'm the subject. I'm the child. The original purpose of the experiment was noble and good. It was supported by a secret group of visionaries, great humanitarians known as Latnok. Latnok? It's Hungarian. It means... The Prophet. Ready to get started? Change within, change the world around me. That's right. Once you teach your mind to alter the positive and negative polarity of the cells in your body... - The glass will move. - Not the glass, the water inside it. The glass is just a container. It's the content that matters. The content. Take a shot. I have no idea what I'm doing. It took me 20 years to master this. Give yourself at least 5 minutes. Free your mind. And concentrate. All the evidence of the festivities has been eliminated. You actually made a list? I'm taking no chances here. Dumped the empty bottles in our neighbors' bins, glued the broken picture frame, and got the stains out of the couch. The only thing left is making sure you don't narc on me. I won't say anything. They're still gonna know. There's always one little thing you overlook. No way. I've got it all covered. Except that. Oh, crap! Nice save. Hey, guys, we're home. Hey. How was San Francisco? Oh, we had a great time. Just what we needed. Yeah. How'd it go here? Everything's cool. No major damage? It was quite dull, actually. - Did a lot of reading. - Have you heard from Kyle? - Just a quick chat on-line. - How's he doing? Who knows? He signs off so fast all the time. Well, he didn't call us. I hope he's okay. Maybe he sent an e-mail. What's this? I had nothing to do with it. Josh, start talking. I had a few friends over. Okay. How long am I grounded? Why don't you go get next year's calendar. I don't know. What do you think? We just got home. Let's deal with this later. What are you doing? Trying to imagine what it was like inside the chamber. Must be why I like the tub. You must have seen me when you worked at Zzyzx. Yeah, I saw you. Did I know what was happening? Was I aware? You were in some kind of sleep state. Did I look comfortable? You seemed to be, yeah. So I just stayed there asleep the whole time? Look, I... I don't know what they were doing to you. You saw me. A person floating in a tank year after year, and you never bothered to ask what was going on? I did my job. - Your parents are home. - The door's closed. Which is technically against their rules. If I don't break a few rules soon, I'm gonna explode. It's not easy being the good girl. Well, here's your chance to corrupt me. What is it? Nothing. Come on. Where's the guy who used to crawl through my bedroom window? I guess I'm... just distracted. Yeah... ever since Kyle left, just like my mom. Comparing me to your mom. That's not good. Well, we all miss him, but you can't sit around and brood all the time. It's just... it was pretty wild how he left. I know. So fast. No time for closure. Hey, he should come visit, right? Good luck with that. Why are you being so negative? Kyle's gone. He's not coming back. Can't hurt to ask. Hey, Kyle. How are you? I'm fine. How's it going with you? No, not this time. Tell me what's happening with you. How are things in Connecticut? It's all good. Are you going out? A little bit. - Meeting people? - A few. Getting along with your parents? Things are going well. - Well, things here kind of suck. - Why? What's wrong? We're all basically craving some Kyle-time. So here's the plan. Use our frequent-flyer miles and catch a flight to Seattle. You want me to come to Seattle? It'd be so great if you could surprise everyone. - Well... - My mom would flip out, in a good way. Will you come? I take that as a "no. " I just stumbled. No. Something's wrong. Tell me. The two of us share a gift, Kyle. Our minds can enable our bodies to do extraordinary things, like... Swim faster. Jump off a roof. You jumped off a roof? I didn't know I wasn't supposed to. Foss told me you had a seizure. I was trying to hear a distant conversation. Well... you put too much strain on your mind. I've spent years challenging myself, testing what I could do... at a great cost. My mind is stronger than ever, by my body is failing me. Failing you? Your mind's potential is... far greater than mine, and so is the toll it can take on your body. You have to condition yourself or you're gonna die too young... ...before you've even had a chance to live, Kyle. The timer. It's hard, you know? You feel like... everyone looks to you for support so... You try to be strong, as usual. You try to... go on and... smile like everything's back to normal, but... inside, you know it's not. It's like you've made this strange and... powerful connection with someone, and then suddenly, he's gone. And you can't just... get on with your life. Not when you feel this void... and this terrible sense that something is wrong. It just... I really miss him. You know, I... I feel like I've lost one of my own children. You just let me know if anything else comes up. I will. Just keep me in the loop on things. Sorry. Kyle. It's okay. Come on in. Are you turning Adam's latest dream into reality? Something like that. I heard he tripped again the other night. Must have scared you. It did. How about that, huh, Adam? Someone else cares about you besides me. Well... I feel like I'm seeing double. - Talk with you later. - All right. I hope I didn't alarm you. I'm still worried about the timer. Let me worry about that. We should tell Foss. No, we can't. He's too cautious. He'll want us to leave here, and there's still so much to do. I want you to remember this moment. After I'm gone, all of my experiences, everything I've studied and learned will be yours. Your mind is a powerful tool. Develop it, protect it. Use it wisely. But more important than your mind, it's your soul that touches people. You can touch the world, Kyle. It's who you are. It's who you're meant to be. How about Shanghai Garden? - If I see another lettuce wrap... - Well, I can't live on pizza. Hey, guys. Dad, you and me : mushroom, garlic, pepperoni. I had that for breakfast. Compromise: We go for sushi. An invitation to hell. Here's an idea: Mom could actually make something. What? She has time now. She stopped working. Look, I know your mom hasn't been as focused lately. Focused? I throw this awesome rager while you're out of town, and she still hasn't said a word about it. Swift, Josh. Remind them to punish you. And we will, believe me. We just have to discuss how. Make me sweat it out, huh? Well, it's not working. It's totally working. Anyway, Mom's been in such a funk since Kyle left, I asked him to visit. - Kyle's coming? - I don't know. I mean I invited him but he basically cut me off. I haven't heard from him since. It's gotta be tough he's trying to connect with his real parents while staying in touch with us. So, what, we can't talk to him? Well, I just think... if we're all gonna move on we have to let each other go. - Ready to try again? - I can't do this. Well, I told you. It takes time. No. I don't want this. I didn't ask to come here. I had people who I loved, who loved me. I had a life. You'll have an extraordinary life. I don't want to hear about Latnok or their experiments or how I was locked in a tank. I'm a human being. How could you put me in there? Why did you create me in the first place? I had no one. No real family. No one whose mind worked like mine, who could experience the world the way that I did. I always felt different. And I thought if there were another person... You didn't want to be alone. I hope in time you can forgive me, Kyle. What is it? He's been shot! Get inside. - Now! - I won't leave him! I'm here. Please. There's still so much you have to teach me. The briefest connection can make the strongest, most indelible impression. Adam encouraged and inspired me and helped me unravel the mystery of my past But without him, my future seemed more uncertain and dangerous than ever. Zzyzx will kill him. They had the opportunity, and they didn't. - They'll be back. - Then we have to - get him out of here. - And then what? And then Kyle runs for the rest of his life? You build him a prison to hide like you did for Baylin - Well, you tell me the alternative - I worked security at Zzyzx for years I know every in and out. I'll go tonight - and eliminate the threat. - You will do no such thing. What are you talking about? "Eliminate the threat?" What does that mean? Zzyzx killed Baylin because he knew too much about them. You know too much, too. No! I have an obligation to protect you. - Not by eliminating anyone. - They'll come after you - I won't let them find me. - They'll target the Tragers to draw you out. Do you wanna be safe? Do ya? Do you want them safe? Then I need to do this. You'll do nothing. You'll harm no one. Have you heard from Kyle? Not lately. Would you know if he's traveling somewhere with the Petersons? He never said anything. Well, the last time you talked to him, did he seem all right? What did he say? You know Kyle. He's a man of few words. Do you realize that was the longest conversation we've had in weeks? And what a surprise. It was all about Kyle. - Josh, I'm worried about him. - You're worried about him? Right. I threw a party while you weren't home. There was unsupervised minors messing around in our house. There was underage drinking and... inappropriate behavior and... probably a few illegal substances I didn't know about. And you busted me for it. You actually found out. And then you did nothing. Nothing. By why should you? I only live here. I'm only your son. Feels strange not having him here. Yeah, it does. It seems Adam planned for everything. He was always ten steps ahead, preparing for every contingency. You mean he expected... To be killed? He had to live with that possibility, that fear. As will you now. I'll manage, like he did. You have to disappear for a while. We have to keep you as far away from Zzyzx as we can. Foss thinks they'll find me. You let me worry about Foss. Where is he? I never thought I'd hear Josh begging to be punished. It was more than that, and you know it. Look, I'm concerned about Kyle. That doesn't mean I'm not attentive to Josh or anyone else in this family. Who are you kidding? Do you think you're fooling anybody and you're not concerned about Kyle. You're being completely stressed out and obsessed. Steven, I can't help feeling that something is wrong. Well, get over it. He's not ours to worry about anymore. I know how much you miss him. I know that you can't stop caring about him. We all do. But Kyle is not here, we are. We just need to feel that you're here with us. The heart rate is stable. We'll move on to the next phase as soon as possible. - What did you do? - Get in. - They're innocent. - They're not innocent! They killed Baylin! They'll kill you! No! I did what needed to be done. And you feel nothing now? - People died. - I know that. - We're responsible. - No. No. I'm responsible. Those people, they ordered you terminated. They saw you as inhuman, as... expendable. The waste product of a failed experiment. It's... Keep learning what Adam had to teach you. Get stronger. Condition your mind and body like he said. He kept everything organized, but there's just... there's so much of it. I just don't know where we should start. We? I'm gonna stay here and read his notes and see if I can help. Why would you do that? You think I'm just gonna walk away from you now? Sometimes the connections you make with other people sneak up on you. You share experiences. You have a history. You form a bond. I should take a picture. You better do it fast. It's not gonna last long. The natives are hungry. Dinner's my choice tonight. I think not. Excuse me? I can still taste that chili you ordered yesterday. - Good. So you've already eaten. - Let's not order in. - I'm with you. Let's go out. - No, actually, I'd like to cook tonight. What, is that such a scary thought? No, no. That sounds great. Absolutely. And one more thing. No phone, no Internet, no video games for a week. Plus, you're getting a job. You need to take on some real responsibility. Harsh. It wasn't your fault. Adam knew you couldn't protect him every minute. I hope you know that. We should get started. You've a lot to learn. I won't be able to, not in this house. Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers. If I stay here, safe but shut in, I might as well have stayed inside that tank. I won't be able to touch the world like Adam said if I'm not part of it. - You don't know what you're asking. I know I can't tell them about the experiment or the people who died without making them accomplices. I know I'll have to keep my past a secret. You'll be lying to them, every day. No. I lied so that I could leave. And now I'll lie so that I can return. But beyond that, I'll do everything in my power to live by the truth. Why do you wanna go back there and complicate your life? It's not complicated. It's simple. I love them. Taylor will provide all the details. I understand. Well, you got what you wanted. I expect you to honor our agreement. I will. It took a lot to get you here. I won't let you waste your potential. Thank you for doing this, for everything you've had to do. Be worth it. You made our favorites. Well, I'm making up for a lot of missed meals. Welcome back. Is it ready yet? Almost! - It smells so good! - I know. I'm dying here. Dinner is served. Oh, my God. In that moment, all the things I'd learned about myself all the gifts I need to develop and all the secrets I promised to hide didn't matter. All that mattered was being home with my family, feeling that connection again...
