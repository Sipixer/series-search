Jessi was so excited to find out that her mother is really alive. All she wants is to know you. We have to get away from all this, Jessi. We have to start our new life. I'll be back. Sarah just left. I would never do that to you. I know that. Just go out there, find a girl, grab her and just... rebound. - Oh, my God! - I can't believe you refuse to speak to me over something that doesn't even matter. What doesn't matter, the fact that Declan kissed you - or that you let him? - I didn't let him. - I'm Jackie. - Declan. Are you a good guy or am I wasting my time? - I'm about 80 percent good guy. - Those are pretty good odds. My mom got a job she couldn't pass up. We move at the end of the month. You can't move. What about us? I never caught your name. - Jessi. - I'm Cassidy. Everyone else at Latnok seems genuine. I'm still not convinced about Cassidy. - What do you know about Sarah? - She's not a friend of Latnok. He's hiding something in his office. He has Sarah's ring, but it might have something to do with her disappearance. My mother didn't leave me. I don't think she did. I need to find out what happened to her. Promise me you'll help me find out. I promise. - Are you okay? - I've just been doing some research. I tapped into the rental car company's records, and it turns out Sarah returned her car the day after she supposedly left town. It was definitely Sarah? I called the rental company. The car was dropped off. I mean... nobody saw her, exactly. - But it still could've been Sarah. - That's true. What's the matter? Nothing. Just a headache. We'll find her, right? She was so hopeful. How could I tell her what I feared might have happened to her mother?</i> We'll find her. 6th Race - XY BelXander and MiniBen314 Saison 03 Episode 08 The Tell-Tale Heart Forom.com & U-sub.net Yes? Don't mind me. Just keep at it, big guy. What are you doing? You're a paragon, Stephen Trager. The kind of man a son can hope to be someday. Paragon? At least you're attempting to butter me up with an SAT word. Come on. You know you can ask me anything. You're right. I mean, you love me unconditionally, and you always have my best interests at heart. And that's why you're gonna let Andy move in with us. Don't say no. No is not on the list of acceptable responses. Unfortunately, it is. Come on! Mom brings home strays whenever she wants and the one time I ask, you suddenly get picky? Kyle and Jessi are a different story and you know it. But if Andy can't stay here, then she has to move. To Cleveland. For, like, ever. I know that's gonna be really hard for you to deal with. So don't make me have to deal with it. Please, Dad. I'm sorry. I really am. It's just not an option. Not even a tiny sort of "let me discuss it with your mother" option? Not even that. Great. Way to be there for me. Stop it. Stop what? You're looking for Cassidy. Don't. I'm just wondering where he is. We can't let him know we suspect he's involved in Sarah's disappearance. It'll just make it harder to find what he's hiding. I know. So act normal. I could make him tell us what he's hiding. - That's not acting normal. - It is for me. Good work. My head. Are you okay? You can do this. How are my two favorite brainiacs this morning? Good, thanks. Fine. - Is everything all right? - She's just been tired. Maybe you're coming down with something. I'm fine. See? I'll have them fix up a cup of tea. You'll feel better. - You don't have to do that. - It's all right. I'm here to help. You know the plan. Copy his cell's memory card, then get out. Just make sure you buy me enough time. I'll try. - You have time for a demonstration? - Yeah, absolutely. What you got? The door was open. I swear, I knocked and rang the bell, but... - obviously... - Kyle's not here. - Actually, I stopped by to... - He and Jessi were all bunched up and whispery at breakfast table, which, if you ask me, is a little too buddy-buddy for my taste because, get this, apparently Jessi is crushing on Kyle something fierce. I don't know where they went or when Kyle's coming back. All I know she lured him out of the house to a cabin to lock him up and turn him into her love-slave. I'm here to see you. You are? I came to see if you wanted to hit The Rack. And it looks like you could stand some quality friend time. Why, because I'm dancing around the house and babbling like you're the first person I've talked to all day? I'll get my purse. As you can see, I've modified the design to accommodate several different energy sources. It can use electricity, fission or solar power to process a petabyte of data from the sensor. That's really interesting. Thanks. I've also reduced the transfer time to less than a picosecond so the data now degrades only a tenth as much as when I started. Fantastic. Good job. Now, onto the program specs. That's fantastic. Really good work, man. There's this really funny video about a Star Wars kid. - You should see it. - Saw that one. Made the rounds a few years ago. But good work. Keep it up. Oh, my God. Are you all right sweetheart? Good. Guys, step back. Get someone to fix that. What are you doing? What are you looking at? Are you okay? I don't know, I feel strange. I'm gonna take you home. - What took you so long? - I wanted Sarah's ring. I didn't take it. I didn't have time. Good. He would've missed it. I hate that he has it. It's hers. We'll get it back eventually. Meanwhile, that was a good cover with Nate. I really thought you were sick. - You OK? - What happened? - You fainted. - I fainted? I thought you were pretending, and then you just... Are you OK? Yeah. I guess I got a little dizzy. This is a lot to deal with. If you need to take some time... - No. - Jessi... Thank you for looking out for me, - but you promised you'd help. - And I will, but... Kyle, I'm fine. Let's go home and check out Cassidy's call log. And here, working like a drone we find the boyfriend.</i> The boyfriend is not in the mood. This isn't still photography. Look alive. Look around. It's dead in here. When it gets like this, I need you to entertain me, which you will not do once you're 2,000 miles away. And imagine me there, missing you. Thus, the whole point of my Andi-mentary. When I need my Josh-fix, I'll just pop it in. But let me tell you. This? Not buyin' the DVD. Even on clearance. So pep up or perish. OK, so this song, you have to listen to the words because they're romantic, without being sappy. Do you do a play-by-play every time a guy gives you a mix? Mark has good taste in music. Terrific. Sorry. This is weird, huh? Last time you were the one making the mixes, and I was forcing Hilary to listen. But now... - So you guys still aren't talking? - I don't wanna talk about it. Don't you think if you two could get in the same room...? There is no way I'm getting in the same room with Hilary. Who says Hilary wants to be in the same room as you. You ready? - For what? - Ignoring you and hanging out with me. You're the one who was all, "Meet me at The Rack, we need some quality..." Friend time? I know I lied to get you both down here, but this fight has gone on too long. So I'm just gonna get us some coffee and you two can work it out. Not funny, Declan. Open up. This is not what I signed on for. Quality friend time, ladies. Make it happen, and I set you free. - You find anything? - No. Just that Cassidy likes to order takeout a lot. He likes pizza. His phone logs aren't giving us anything. It would help if we had a record of Sarah's calls. Sarah was always on the run. She wasn't the kind of person - to use a regular cell phone. - Isn't. - What? - She isn't the kind of person. You're right. We still don't know anything for sure. I'm sorry. He wanted Andy to move in with us? Yeah, he did. I feel terrible. - He's really taking this hard. - You said no, right? Of course. I just... wish I didn't have to. There's no way we can have two kids whose hormones are exploding living together under our roof. No one can just disappear. We should go back to the apartment and take a look around. I think we're too late. Nicole's already scrubbed the place, and Josh and Andy have cleaned. You were there that night. - You're a witness. - Kyle, Sarah was gone when I got back. - I didn't see anything. - You don't know if you saw anything. But if you access your holographic memory, you might find a clue. - I don't know how to do that. - I'll walk you through it. You can recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories. - I don't know. - I'll be right here for you. - How do I do it? - You just need to focus. - Nothing is happening. - Just relax. - I am relaxed. - More relaxed. No. - You should get in my tub. - Really? It helps me. Lay back. Okay. Are you ready? Close your eyes. Concentrate on the night you left Latnok and went back to the apartment. I went inside. It was dark. Quiet.</i> Sarah? You're okay. I'm here with you. What happens next? I saw the letter. I read the letter. She said she left. She couldn't be my mother anymore. But Sarah didn't write the letter. Remember? - Cassidy did. - Cassidy. You saw him that night, too. That's when we met. He was friendly. Relaxed. He had his dog with him.</i> - Nothing strange. - Then you left to help me. And I met Cassidy when we were at Latnok. What is it? When I got back to the apartment, Cassidy was already there, in the hall. He got back from Latnok so quickly, ahead of me. Why would he have to rush? What did you see when you got back? - Sorry. - He was going to do his laundry.</i> He's just standing there, holding the basket.</i> There has to be something. Sorry... What is it? What did you see? Blood. Jessi, are you okay? You're burning up. - How is she doing? - We couldn't... She's still running a fever. 101.3, down from 102 a couple of minutes ago, but up from 100.8 at the hour. A human thermometer. That can come in handy. - Poor thing. - Why won't it go down? Well, a fever is just the body fighting off an illness. As long as it doesn't get too high, it's good that she's sleeping it off. People get sick. It happens. - Not really to you and Jessi, but... - There's no other - physiological signs of illness. - That can happen with a virus. What is it? Jessi and I discovered some new information about Sarah. I don't think she abandoned Jessi. Something happened to her. She's been really upset about it. And then the fever. You think her illness is psychosomatic? Yes. But how do I treat a psychosomatic problem? We might be able to help her with therapy, but we need - to get her fever down first. - Right. Treat the symptoms. I think I have an idea. It's okay. I've seen how rowdy my sister can get on a sugar rush. Probably not a good idea to feed the animals. All part of my plan. Lock the door behind me, 'cause I'm going in. You're a brave man, Declan. It's been a pleasure knowing you. Now, listen, this whole thing is my fault. I was in a bad place, I was drunk and I kissed her. I shouldn't have done it, but I did and now it's done. - You guys work out your differences. - Thanks, traitor muffin. But no carbs for me. It's bikini season. Oh, it's not to eat. You two should just get your aggression out the way you usually do. Orange-flavored soda. Flavored syrup. Need I go on? You're not seriously suggesting we have a food fight. - Seemed like it helped before. - What would help is if some people didn't jump to conclusions and call their best friend a slut. Best friends don't break the girl code. He just said it was his fault. Why won't you accept it? I'll accept it when you admit that you wanted it to happen. - Bring it. - It is on. - Thanks, man. - Any time. - Psst! Hey, Declan. - What are you doing here? Might've asked around, I heard you hang out here. - Is that weird? - A little. But in a good way. Um, why are they staring at us? They're, um... going through a thing. Uh, care to join me over here? I don't think this is all for show. I think he really likes her. I know. - He's got the Trager gaze. - The what? Well, that's what I called it when he looked at you that way. - It's kinda dorky. - Jealous. You wish he was looking at you like that. - I do not. - Do too. - Do not. - Do too. All right, fine. You know what? I did want him to look at me with that stupid moony look. I even thought he and I might have something. But I let it fizzle out... because of you. You did? Because you're more important to me than any guy, no matter how great his arms are. What are we doing? We've been fighting for weeks over something Declan started and now he's completely moved on. I see your point. Instead of fighting, we should be figuring out ways to make him suffer. Yeah. Let's find a way out of here and crash his date. I never thought I'd see your tub being used as an actual tub. - Her temperature's still not dropping. - We just put the ice in. Give it a little time. Do you think she knows, deep down, that Sarah's not OK? It's possible. Her reaction, the fever, maybe her body is fighting her deep-rooted anxiety as if it were some kind of infection. Almost like she knows what happened. - What if she does? - You mean, like a suppressed memory? What if Jessi witnessed something, something she doesn't want to admit? Kyle, in my experience, if she's gone to such great lengths to deny it, - she won't want to go back there. - I could go with her. I could access her memories, if she lets me. Kyle, what you're talking about, even if I could wrap my head around it, I'm not sure it's the best way. I know it's extreme. But I have to help her. I have to try everything I can. Okay. Definitely not getting out that way. Looks like it's gonna be up and over. - Ew, it's dirty up here! - Revenge is dirty work. Oh, my shirt! Maybe you should think twice before leaving the house with half an outfit. Excuse me, Lori, I didn't know I should dress for hijinks. I so don't feel fabulous right now. Not your best moment, no. Jessi, I want to help you. I can try and access your memories, but I need your permission. Just want to sleep... Sleeping won't help you feel better. This might. - I don't want to... - We should try. Remember, I'm still here with you. All right. What is it? I feel like I'm invading her privacy. She's remembering all these moments that she's... ...that she's had with me. Sometimes people hide disturbing thoughts or emotions with ones that calm them. Almost like a child puts a blanket over a stuffed animal that frightens them when it's time to go to sleep. - So I'm the blanket. - But you can't be forever. Not if you want her to face her memories. - They must be very intense. - Kyle, you don't have to be the one to do this. Yes, I do. I want to keep trying. I'll leave you alone for a little while. Thanks. Jessi, I want to try again. I need you to help me. Think of a time when you were happy, safe. Focus on that memory and I'll be there. - You're here. - I said I would be. - This is nice. - It is. And I know you don't want to leave. But I have to, don't I? I'll stay with you. Whenever you're ready. You have to be the one who takes us. - Trager, what are you up to? - Hils and I made up.</i> We want you to come outside so we can thank you.</i> Okay. Where are you guys at? What are you talking about? We're outside on the patio.</i> - Where? - Behind you. Open it, Trager. Open it! - Hi. - Cute little blonde thing. We need to talk. Behold the species, boyfriend. A rare breed, prone to strange and erratic behavior. Nothing erratic about what I'm doing. Yon spending your paycheck on fake tattoos and superballs. You don't think that's a little off? Got it. Andromeda Summer Faith Jensen, will you marry me? - Well? - Well... - Are you serious? - Totally, 100 percent. I love you and I want to get married. What kind of idiot, asinine idea is that? The only kind that will keep you from leaving me. Oh, my God. You've lost your mind. Why? Why is it so crazy? I could write an encyclopedia on why it's crazy. Well, start writing, because I'm not taking no for an answer. You might not believe this, but I'm quite the coffee brewer. You're right, I don't believe you. - No! You can't do this. - But you questioned my skills. You can't come back here. What if my boss comes back? Then he'll get the best cappuccino he's ever tasted. Hey, I've seen one of these symbols before. Kyle has a ring with this on it. - That's impossible. - No, I'm pretty positive. He got it from his birth father. - Kyle was adopted? - By the Tragers, yeah. - Who's his birth father? - I don't know. - Adam something. - Adam. - Adam Baylin? - You know what? I shouldn't even be talking about this. It's Kyle's business. - What is that sound? - I don't know. It sounds like butterfly wings. Jessi, you said you saw blood. Yes. In the laundry basket. On a towel stuffed down at the bottom. We can stop if you need to. No, I can do this. I don't see anything else. Try looking at the memory differently. At crime scenes, detectives use ultraviolet lights to view evidence. You mean blood evidence, right? Yes. Are you okay? We can do the same by adjusting our vision to display the ultraviolet part of the spectrum our eyes normally can't see. I'll try it. It's working. I see something. It's more blood. And more. Jessi! Jessi! Jessi, it's okay. I'm sorry. We're done. We're done. I'm sorry. Is she OK? We're stopping. Don't worry. We're done. It's okay. That's it. I'm calling a doctor. It's OK, Jessi. We're not going back. We'll figure this out another way. No. She's in there. She's in his apartment. - Jessi, stop. - Help me! I need to get in there. Yon can't. It's a memory. It's already happened. No! Let go of me. I can help! Sarah! - Sarah! - Jessi, please. Stop. Stop. Okay. What is that? What? Do you know what it is? - You do. - Jessi... What? I don't... No. No! - Maybe it's not. - It's a heartbeat. It's Sarah's heartbeat. Why didn't I recognize it? Because it's slower than it should be. - Kyle, she's dying in there! - Look at me. - I can't! - Look at me! Look at me. Don't look away. I'm right here. It's just you and me. - Kyle... - I know. I know. Just stay with me. No! He killed her! I was here all along! - And I didn't save her! - You couldn't. You didn't know. She's dead. My mother is dead. I don't know what they said but... Apparently, it wasn't what I thought it would be. I'll call you. OK, so she's kind of adorable. You've always been a sucker for cute and smart. - We wanted to sabotage you. - We did. But then when we were trying to explain to her what a jerk you were... We realized it was pretty sweet of you to get us to patch things up. Does this mean you two are back on track? Looks like your dirty double-cross served its purpose. Well, watching you guys fight was breaking my heart, even if it did inflate my ego a little. - Oh! - It was so not about you. I'm just glad you two are friends again. But if that blonde little bimbo hurts you... Just say the word and we'll crush her. Don't worry. I'm okay. I never could get used to Kyle seeing through me all the time, but with two of you, I guess now I'll have to. I guess. I know you had to relive something today, Jessi. Something that you saw that was really bad. You don't have to tell me about it. - I will. I just... - It's too much right now. - And that's OK. - One day, I'll tell you. - I promise. - When you're ready. And whenever that is, I promise I'll still be around to hear it. I'm not going anywhere. I guess you can see through me, too. I want to be here for you. You are. - Can we talk about it? - Not until your answer is yes. Then it'll be a hundred years of silent solitude. Fine, I'll talk. I'm sorry, okay? I know you meant well, but getting married won't solve our problems. In fact, I think our collective three moms and a dad would probably kill you, and then me, and then probably you again. Seriously? This is how you're gonna be? - What the hell is your problem? - Finally, he speaks! Yeah, and here's what he has to say! No... you... didn't. It's gonna stink later! You see, this is the Josh I'm gonna miss. Do I want to know? - I'm going to my room. - Since when do you want to go to your room? When I send you, you don't go to your room. - It's just been a long day. - Too long for a G-Force marathon? Come on, I'll let you kick my ass. I said ass and I get nothin'? Josh... I don't know what to do. - Hi. - Hi. How do you feel? Exhausted. Drained. But a little bit free. Good. You didn't tell Nicole. I don't think anyone should know about this yet. - I know it's not over. - No. We need to find out why he did it. We will. But there's something I want you to see. What is it? There's a service that backs up cell phone data. - Even disposable cell phones. - Like Sarah's? - I found her records. - You did? The call records lead nowhere. But there were pictures she took. Of what? You. Memories are our way of keeping the past alive.</i> Some are so painful we never want to visit them again.</i> But a memory can also be a gift, something we can open again </i> and again in orderer to fill ourselves with happiness.</i> And sometimes a moment becomes a memory the instant it's happening</i> because it is so true, so pure and so significant, you want to capture it forever. - Nate? - What's up? Do you see anyone hanging around my office? Actually, I caught Jessi in there, this morning. - Jessi? - Why? Something's wrong? No, no. Just curious.
