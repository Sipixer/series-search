But there is one more thing you should see, no belly button. I have a new patient, and the place where he's staying isn't safe, so I'm bringing him here for a little while. You mean some mental patient's going to live in our house? He's a very sweet, very special boy. I don't want him touching my things. If your mom says he's coming, he's coming and that's final. Yo,juice me! Did he just learn to talk in one day? No. Lori, that's impossible. That was an hour-long test. How long did it take him, five minutes? Yeah, and he got them all right. What is this kid, seriously? Somebody has to be missing this kid. Well, so far, no one's filed a report. I was hoping that you wouldn't mind if Kyle stayed with us a while longer. They called it sleep. A strange state after dark during which they did nothing. Thought nothing. But made odd noises, and sometimes spoke. How could they just lie there all night? There was so much to learn and explore. I didn't know where to begin. Every taste and texture made my senses explode. Kyle, it's four o'clock in the morning. It seemed to matter what this number was. What were you thinking? Stephen, he didn't know any better. Was he raised by wolves? No, apparently by Chinese people. Ok, enough. It's late. Let's finish this up in the morning. Kyle, you must be exhausted. When did you wake up? I didn't wake up. Have you been having trouble sleeping? I don't sleep. You mean not tonight. I mean not ever. Kyle, you've been with us for over a week, and you're telling us you haven't slept? Not even once? Never. Hi, hon. Hey Huh, we only have about an hour. Those numbers again. They planned everything around them. How about you? You have to go in? No, I took time off to be with Kyle. Those numbers represented time, Which they never seem to have enough of. So, I'll tell you why Kyle hasn't slept for ten days. He's an alien. He's not an alien. I've never seen him sleep, and his bed is right next to mine. That's because you fall asleep before he does. Save your imagination for summer school. Which reminds me, no more X-box until you finished those assignments. I'm gone. No breakfast? No time. How could she not have any? It seemed to be all they talked about. Mom, there's a detective here to see you. Kyle, You said the last thing you remember was being in the woods. Now ah, how did you get there? I don't know. Do you remember why you weren't wearing clothes? I don't remember ever having any. Ok, uh. How old are you? We don't know. We're guessing around 16. Where did you live before here? Nowhere. I'm sorry. I just don't remember. It's ok, Kyle. You will. I wish I could report more progress. But uh, no one's even filed a missing person report that fits Kyle's description. No one noticed he's gone? How could that be? He has to have come from somewhere. Someone has to be missing him. Well, maybe he left a bad situation at home. So, you think Kyle's a run-away? Or something terrible could have happened to him. I've seen it in my practice: Patients with amnesia, caused by some traumatic experience. I've seen people with amnesia, too. But uh, never to this degree. I've never seen anyone like Kyle before. It was madness at my house last night. Captain Clueless ate half our kitchen. Kyle? I wouldn't mind feasting on him. That boy's a hottie. There's Declan. I can't believe he hasn't even called you since the party. Well, he can do what he wants, so can I. Yo, Hills. Hey, there. Trager, haven't seen you around? I've been busy. No time for me anymore? Might be able to fit you into my schedule. As long as you ditched the skank. We saw you mauling that nymph at your party. She was mauling me. I couldn't shake her. Besides, you took off with that guy. What guy? The 'Kung-Fu Master'? The dude who broke through my window to mess with the cop? -You mean -Kyle! O, the way he scooped her up and carried her off. Isn't he incredible? Let him chew on that for a little while. Hi, I'm Nicole Trager. We're here to see Dr. Stone. Nicole, all you've written down here is Kyle. His name is the only thing we know about him and even that we made up. No memory, no medical history. No, he's like a 16-yr old new born. Well, at least with a new-born we know who the parents are, we have a genetic history. So, where do we start? Well let me see the films. They said the MRI machine was broken. It had to be. Nobody can produce that much brain activity. He does have an extraordinary aptitude for math. It's not possible. Even a genius IQ would not show half of those results. I had no idea what he was looking for. Good. Kyle, open, aaah. Or why he'd thought he'd find it in my mouth. Maybe it was in his. Now, I'm not a dentist. But now these ones here, his teeth don't look worn at all. They look brand new. He didn't know what a toothbrush was until I showed him. Lay back, Kyle. You tell me. I've never seen anything like it. Not really a genetic abnormality... I knew something was missing. Skin graft? But I didn't know why it mattered. What for? And no trace of the scar? Perhaps surgery that corrected uh an unbiblical hernia. Dr. Stone, I don't think they'd wipe out the whole naval. Some of his characteristics are, unusual. But he's in excellent shape physically. Obviously his mental health is a cause for concern. Well, I'll be working with him to recover his memory. But right now, I'm more worried that he's not sleeping. Well, I didn't know who I was, I'd have trouble sleeping, too. But he must be sleeping, Nicole. He looks fine, not tired at all. But he says he hasn't slept in 10 days. Not once, and I've never seen him sleep. Give him one of these. Guaranteed to give him a good night's sleep. And don't worry, Nicole. Normal people can't go long without sleeping. And you think Kyle is normal. No belly button aside, heart rate's good, blood pressure's fine. Just like any other kid his age. O, my! I think I got it. What if time is different on Kyle's home planet? Josh, this is Kyle's home planet. One earth day might be like an hour for him. So ten days Is like ten hours! Yea, I get it. You're being ridiculous. Think about it. He's this super brain with amnesia. He can't understand the simplest thing, but does calculus, like it's 2 plus 2. He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but somehow speaks Chinese? He never sleeps, and I haven't even gone through the whole belly button thing yet. Mom, I'm telling you. Kyle is not human! Oh, Kyle. Of course you are human. See, even he's not sure. Stop wasting time. Go do your homework. That's a waste of time. I didn't know time could be wasted. Kyle. I want you to try something. Sometimes people have trouble sleeping because they're concerned about something that's happened to them. Am I? I'm not sure, but this might help you recall some experiences. I want you to draw anything, anything at all. Anything you can remember about where you came from, about your home. Great. Now it does make any sense to you now. Kyle's still at it. He's been drawing for hours. Good, wear him out. The way he draws. It's almost like he snaps a picture in his head and then reproduces it. It's the same sort of thing over and over. This must be the place near Victor Falls where he was first seen, his earliest memory. What do you think it means? Well, I think something significant may have happened there, but I can't explain it yet. Chamomile always does the trick for me. It's very soothing. It's gonna help you sleep. Tastes like horse pee. Josh It does. What does horse pee taste like? How would I know? You just said It's an expression. A rude one. Here, Kyle, try the tea. It's hot though, be careful. No, not the teabag. The water, you drink the tea. Alien What are you doing? Eats teabag. I'm keeping a list. What makes Kyle an alien. It's good? It's good. Now I'm the teabag. Somehow I felt safe here. Secure, at peace. He loves it under there. Cuz he's weightless, like in space. Out! I'm right! See? He's still under. Kyle! Relaxed? One of us is. So, what's up for tonight? Hit the town with Mr. Kung-Fu? Nope, just hanging. Maybe I'll swing by later. Maybe I'll be around. Hold on. Kyle, do you mind? Sorry. The future today. Mada Corp on the web at MADA CORP dot com. Likes white-noise. Check. Dude, you'll never sleep with that on. Yo! Hands off the stash! My Sour-Patche Kids, they're sacred. I can't wait to fall asleep. Last night, the entire sports illustrated swimsuit issue came to life: Just me and seven super models. I am so prime for the sequel. Ok, Kyle. Well, you've had a bath, some warm tea, feeling tired? No. I'm sure part of the problem is you're anxious. Remember, Detective Breen and the police are still searching. We're looking for answers. In the meantime, you've got to get some sleep, and this will help? Will you take it? I took it. No, you have to swallow it. And then I'll sleep? Good. Perfect. Goodnight boys. Sleep well. Sweet dreams. Oh, they will be. He looked so pleased, stretched out, doing nothing. But I still felt like the whole world was calling out to me, waiting to be explored. I learned it was wrong to touch things in the house while they were sleeping. So, I went outside. Wow How'd you do that? You're like the dog whisperer. What are you doing out there? Can't sleep. Me neither. Every time I get done with all my stuff, I just can't pass out for eight hours. I need a little down time, you know? Downtime? Yea. Just sit here, do nothing, just look at the stars. They make you feel so small, I just lose myself when I look up there I heard that you don't remember anything. That must be really hard, scary. I should get some sleep. You should too, Kyle. I bet your family's searching for you right now. I mean, they have to be. You didn't just fall from the sky. Ahh! What are you doing? Walking? Why are you out of bed? I wasn't sleeping. Stop skulking around, you can give a person a heart attack. Lori? Great. What's going on? Nothing, I heard him down here, I wanted to make sure he was ok. With full makeup on? What? Oh I haven't washed my face yet. Upstairs. Now. Dad, I was just Move Kyle, did you get any sleep? No. Alright. Come on, upstairs. Let's go back to bed. What happened? Oh, it's ok. Go back to sleep. Where did you go? Outside. You went outside, Kyle? Yes. What did you do? I looked at the stars. Ok. Now is not the time for star-gazing Kyle. Now is the time to get some sleep. I'll see you guys in the morning. You had to be out there, didn't you? Under the stars? So they could find you. Are they gonna beam you up? Beam me? Your peeps, dude. Your real family, in the stars. Coffee? Black. In fact, just toss me the can I'll chew on the grinds. Oh, you never fell back to sleep either? No, at least Kyle got some sleep. You checked on him? No, his door was closed. I was afraid to make a sound. Morning, I need a Cup of Joe. You need a pick me up? Make chocolate milk. Kyle still asleep? He's not in his bed. He isn't? Kyle? Check the bathtub. He loves it in there. Wonder if he wandered out again. What, did he wander out before? Found him. Kyle? What are you doing? Waiting. For what? To go home. Tell me he's not an alien. Well, I spoke to Dr. Stone and he can't understand why the pill didn't work. Didn't do anything. He's still rare and to go. He said if this continues, he wants to admit Kyle and sedate him. Well, he should. No? He has to sleep. No, I don't want Kyle knocked out in some hospital. Well, I don't either but what we're doing isn't working. Well, he needs to be where it's familiar, where he feels comfortable. How comfortable can he be, if he can't sleep here? So what happened last night? You never came out. Sorry, I got nabbed. Feels like you're jerking me around, eh Trager? Declan, my parents caught me and You and who? That guy Kyle? Was he in there with you? Look, Kyle's one of my mother's head cases. He's just staying with us for a while. Hillary was just messing with you. That right? Yea, so come by tonight. You're going to leave me hanging again? No way. I'm so there. Ok, then. Later, Trager. Later. Where are we running? No place, we're just running. Why are we running? Uh, well the plan is to exhaust you. We, started at ten after, right? Gotta go at least half an hour. Why? Well, it's good exercise, gets rid of stress. Stress? Yea, pressure, tension. Running takes away what's worrying me. It's my time to escape. But you watch time when you run. And time is just numbers that people made up. Well, we need those numbers to keep order in the world. So you can never really escape time. You can never just be. Well, I think you can escape, in your own head. Let's pick up the pace. Go faster. Hey, how did it go? I'm beat. He's ready for a marathon. It's incredible, that kid is a lightning bolt. Look at this. This line he drew. It has nothing to do with the picture. That's strange. Stephen, I'm gonna stay up and watch him tonight. Make sure he didn't wander out again. What are you gonna do, camp out by his door? Well, I think he'd feel more secure with me nearby. Alright, we'll go in shifts. Me first. I knew I loved you. No midnight X-box for me tonight, and no nasty-nasty for you and Declan either. What are you talking about? They're posting guards to keep track of Kyle, right out my door. Oh, no. Yea, welcome to Alcatraz. Trager, you're killing me. Can't you slip by him? No, come back later. Why, so you can bail on me again? Don't go high maintenance on me. Maybe they'll fall asleep and I can sneak out. I'm not staying up for a maybe. Then we'll have to make it another time. You're not happy. No, Kyle. I'm thrilled. You don't sound thrilled. It's called sarcasm. Get used to it. You wanted to leave with him. No, I wanted to stay here trapped in my room all night. Sarcasm. You're catching on. Why did you want to go? Because we have a good time. Well, can't you have a good time another time? I don't know, maybe? It doesn't work that way with us. We don't make plans. Why? Kyle, you ask too many questions. Get out, go to bed. Stephen? Huh? Is he asleep? Go, you have a huge meeting tomorrow. I'll take over. Are you feeling tired at all? My body feels slower. My muscles ache a bit. Good. That's good. But my head can't stop thinking. You have to, clear you head, Kyle. Do what I do, count backwards from a hundred. You counted already. Ok, count backwards from a thousand. No, a hundred thousand and if that doesn't work, try a hundred million. Twelve-thousand six hundred and eighty, twelve-thousand six hundred and seventy nine You're still counting? Sweetie. Huh? What? We overslept. O, my meeting! Is it too late? Damn it, Nicole. I can't afford to make mistakes like this! We'll get over this hump. Kyle will acclimate. This was supposed to be temporary. You said he'd be here, till somebody claimed him, or till you find him another place. I'm trying to. No, you spend all day taking care of him. He wakes us up every night. It's like have a new baby in the house. New babies keep you up. Yea, but this one is huge! And he's not our kid. He doesn't belong here, Nicole. We can't just abandon him, because it's not easy to have him around. We're the only thing he has right now. And I can't give up on him. Kyle? Thank you. Detective Breen has squad cars in the area, they're still looking for him. He's been gone all day. Is that all they can do? Do they know Kyle's sort of different? Oh, they know all about him. Kyle's listed as a missing person. So, our missing person's missing. It's not funny. It's going to get dark soon. Kyle could get hurt. Since when do you care? Well, I don't want anything bad to happen to him. It's my fault. I was horrible to him. I know that's why he ran away. No, sweetheart. Actually, I think he overheard me and your dad. We may have upset him. Well, I was nice to him, I was! Sort of. Well, I've been all over the neighborhood several times. There is no sign of him. Let's check downtown where the cops first found him. No, no. I think the city frightened him. I just, I don't think he would go there. Kyle doesn't know anywhere to go. Yes, he does. Nicole, this is a long shot. Well, it's worth trying. Why would he come out here? Besides our house, this is the only home he knows. He's here to go home! E. T 'hone home' His stump looks like a landing pad for a shuttle or something, sent by his mother ship. -Oh, for Pete's sake. -Should have left him home. How did he even make it out here, on his own? Dad, you're talking about someone with no belly button. Who knows what he can do? Dork, he's not up there! I'm looking for the craft. Come, on. Knock it off. Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! It's ok. Gotcha. You're ok. We were so worried. -What are you doing here? -Why'd you come? I came so my family could find me. I think we just did. Come on. I understood then. We need patterns. Time to be away, time to rest. Congratulations, you look exhausted. You feel it? Yes. But what if I don't sleep? Oh, tonight is your night, Kyle. You just have to find a right spot for yourself. And just relax, get comfortable. Be right back. How is he doing? Well, he looks beat. Heh. But who knows. We may be in for another long night. Well, let's get him to bed. Kyle? Dad! Oh, I know. I know, but that's where he's most comfortable. In the bathtub?! Who cares, at least he's asleep. If people find out, I will die. I'm telling ya, this guy's an alien! I'm calling Steven Spielberg. Ok Oh, now that he's finally asleep, I have a ton of stuff to catch up on. Hold on, hold on. Why don't you just stay here and be with me. I'm so glad Kyle can rest. Now he can start to remember.
