Kyle is still Kyle. I know you think I'm a bad guy. This whole thing with Hillary is just physical. It has nothing to do with how much I love Amanda. - You're still together. - Why not? I've been lying to Lori for months. My grades are screwed. Look me in the eye, and tell me all of it was for nothing. It wasn't for nothing, and I can't say any more. Zzyzx experimented with artificial reproduction and produced two primary assets: the male called... XY, the second is a female, XX. She apparently escaped. She's fully developed. Consider her dangerous. - Can't be. - Who is he? - The other asset. - XY? I thought you said he was terminated. I'm going to tell Declan. - I can explain it to him. - No, you can't. I need someone I can talk to. Then you know what, go ahead. Tell 'em everything. And we'll see how long it takes before somebody catches wind of who you are and drags you out of there. Is that what you want? Back to normal, a phrase of such simplicity it nearly defines itself. The months that had passed since I'd left had been anything but, and I was ready for that part of my life to be over. I was going to pursue normalcy as if my life depended on it. ...so you just give the team statistics a value of 2/3x, factor in floor conditions and several other simple formulas... What's he talking about? The basketball pool at the office. I have a secret weapon. Stephen, isn't that a little... unfair? Absolutely. Brad took the whole thing last year. This year he's going down. Who's getting death by fork? Declan, if he's not dead already. I wouldn't know. You two still having problems? If by problems you mean him not returning my calls all weekend, then yes. I'm over it. Josh, I need your friend Robby's number. His mom asked me to volunteer for the Active Parents Committee. - Oh, really? - To which you probably said, "No way in hell." What's wrong with a little volunteering? I have the time. Time to contribute to the social annihilation of your son. Then it was time well spent. - May I say something? - Depends. Latin, Greek or Arabic? Go ahead. Thank you. For this. For everything. You're welcome. So cool. She cleaned up well. It took some work to get her to understand the concept of soap. Does she just sit there all day? Sometimes she sits facing the other way. Can she hear us? The room is completely soundproof. We recovered some of the hard drives from the explosion at the former Zzyzx complex. I was right. The other subject, XY, the boy she drew in the pictures... he wasn't terminated like we were led to believe. Why would they lie? He's something of theirs in his head, something they wouldn't want to admit was missing. What is it? Your job is to get it back. Where is he now? I'll set up a retrieval unit. I wish it was that simple. The last time someone tried to grab that boy, an entire complex was firebombed. I'd still like my parking space in the morning. Fair enough. Everything you need to know is in that file. What should I do about the girl? Actually, she makes me nervous just sitting there. Get her a teddy bear or something. - Transcript : swsub.com - - Projet-SG.net | SeriesSub.com - Season 2 Episode 3 - The List Is Life - What's this? St. Collette, the patron saint of people... - who have lost a parent. - people who have lost a parent. You heard. I'm so sorry. I can't take this. It was my gift for you. Now it's a gift from me. Everything's gonna be okay. I promise. Young love makes me want to hurl. I wonder if Dull and Duller will make Best Couple again this year? For what? The "Hit List". Everyone votes anonymously in different categories. You know, things like Biggest Fashion Don't or Hottest Teacher. Most in Need of an Enema. - It sounds mean. - It is. But that doesn't stop everybody from voting. Well, why would anyone care? Lesson number one: The list is life. I don't think I like that. You're telling me. You didn't suffer through last year's humiliation. - Hillary made the list. - Yeah. Biggest Sl... Four-letter word rhymes with... "chut. " I suppose it could be worse. I could have an entire category named after me. That hairnet... has the Biggest Geekman award written all over it. Okay, Deichman's got a lock on that. That's why it's named after him. I don't know, dude. You're sort of giving him a run for his money. Bana-guava. Hold the wheatgrass. I just got hammered on G-Force. This guy keeps popping in my game and wiping me out. You're not supposed to spend your breaks on the Internet. It's, like, against the rules. Be less cool. It'll really help your cause. Nice guy. Why are you eye-stalking those two? I'm gonna tell Amanda the truth. That's a bad idea with a capital very. Lesson number two: The messenger always gets shot. Not literally, but... you shouldn't be the one to tell her. She'll hate you for keeping it a secret in the first place. It's a no-win situation. You could tell her. You don't even like her. And you're the one he cheated with. What's done is done. There's no need in making a bigger mess out of things than I already have. I have to go. So soon? Lori's here. I can't talk to her right now. - What's this? - I found these... in Baylin's files. I can't just come meet you whenever you call. - People will start asking questions. - All these feats... all of them... were performed by ordinary people. Kyle, imagine what you could do. Are these real? There they are. We need to meet more often and start exploring your physical limits. I start school again tomorrow. Well, then after school. After school, there are clubs, activities, hanging out. - I was hoping... - Shouldn't waste your time... hanging out. Kyle, this is what Adam wanted for you. And we need to see that through. All right? Now, the basic... principle, obviously, is mind over matter. Hey there. War and Peace. A little light reading. When do you think you'll start working again? I haven't decided yet. We haven't had a moment alone in a long time. How you feeling? I think... I thought it'd be easier to get back to normal. What you've been through is anything but normal. It's gonna take some time to adjust. You don't have to rush it. But what if I want to? Sometimes we... run away from things as a way of... protecting ourselves from having to deal with them. Do you wanna talk about it? How much time do we have? You tell me. I think I'll keep running a little longer while I figure it out. As long as you know I'm here when you're ready. You still have 29,642 words left. You're not going anywhere. I read the family history. These people seem to consider him one of their own. It's gonna be hard to make him disappear. Actually, we'd like to get what we need without anyone noticing we were there. I'm not sure that I understand how that's possible. You know what a firewall is, I assume. Of course. XY's brain is powerful... like a computer. He's managed to develop a... mental equivalent of a firewall. It's what prevented Zzyzx from being able to control him and what will prevent us from... getting what's inside his head. That's where she comes in. What, like a mental hacker? In a manner of speaking, yes. I was joking. We need what he knows. She's the only one capable of getting it. How? I mean, he's been living a normal life in the suburbs. Look at her. She hardly seems capable of assimilating. Just leave that to me. Lori doesn't live here anymore. Where'd she go? To hell. It has excellent lighting. You're upset about Declan. I don't understand. I knew we were having issues, but nothing that deserves him ignoring me. I don't know what I did. You didn't do anything. Then what? You've been talking to him, you must know something. I think he's just going through something right now and he's trying to work it out in his head without bringing the people he cares about into it. I'm his girlfriend. He should be able to talk to me instead of avoiding me. Trust that I could help. He sucks. - We're gonna be late for school. - School sucks. I can't get up. My whole body hurts. Mind over matter. Use your mind to convince your body it feels better. If you believe you don't hurt, you won't. Will that work? For the next five minutes. Come on. Come on. - Kyle! - Hey, man, good to have you back. Where's Amanda? Well, you don't have to worry about Amanda. She's fine. I don't see it that way. Yeah? Well, how do you see it? You weren't honest with her when you had the chance. Telling her the truth would have hurt her. It was a no-win situation. But right now... it seems like she's the only one losing. Now that's a well-balanced meal. What the... This is a guys' bathroom. Relax. I have brothers. It's the only place I can get a good wireless signal. Uh, how about a classroom? Yeah, they're not so into using class time to play G-Force. I play G-Force. Have you come across the handle AndyJ yet? - He's ruining me. - I know. I heard you talk about it at the Rack. Bana-guava, hold the wheatgrass? I order it, like, everyday. Sorry. No big. Speaking of doing weird things in weird places, I'm pretty sure there's a cafeteria about a hundred yards from here. - I'm hiding out. - From? The cafeteria is full of landmines during "List Season." I don't wanna be branded some loser like L.K. Deichman. You'd rather be a loser who eats lunch in the bathroom. At least I'm in the right bathroom, - Miss whatever-your-name-is. - It's Andy, actually. Andy Jensen. Or AndyJ to you. Today is your last chance to buy your tickets to the fifth annual ... Tickets are only ten dollars at the front office. - Unbelievable. - I have the answer. To life? Or to how I'll get my boyfriend to quit his dump-and-dodge routine? - What are you wearing? - You like? You look Amish. It's part of my strategy to avoid the slut vote. I'm also gonna revirginize. Re-what? Revirginization. Think about it. If it's ours to give away, then it's ours to take back. But we worked so hard to get rid of it. My problems began the minute sex entered the picture. Next thing you know, I'm the "chut" of the century. And if I had never had sex with Declan, I wouldn't be in this situation. How does one revirginize? We just agree to it. I mean, there's this whole ceremonial thingy, but mostly it's just us deciding that it's true. Mind over matter. If we convince ourselves it's true, then it is. We'll live our lives not motivated by boys or sex or anything to do with boys and sex. In which case, what do we do with ourselves? I guess we'll have to ask a virgin. There you are. I feel like I haven't seen you all day. Look, I'm late for class, but we need to hang out. I have the bonfire committee at three. You want to help? I can't after school. I'm sorry. Bummer. Well, maybe this weekend. - Bye. - Bye. Will I see you at the bonfire? Well, Amanda's in charge of it. Hmm, she'll be busy. Yes, she will. And what will you be? That depends on you. Well, then I guess anything's possible. What's this? I recommend that you learn it. All of it. - Who's Jessi Hollander? - See for yourself. Don't bring me to work if you're just gonna make me sit here all day. Hello. - I'm Emily's boss. - Hi, Jessi. - Her sister. - Nice to meet you. What did you do to her? Think of it like downloading a program into a hard drive. Only she's the computer, and her life is the program. Yesterday she was a non-communicative, cold-blooded killer with no means which to live her life outside of that room. Today... she's a young teenaged girl who likes strawberry ice cream and Avril Lavigne. And what about her memories? Zzyzx, the guy that she killed in the woods... Deleted. Everything she experienced in the first few days of her life has been erased. How? Ms. Hollander, we're a multi-billion dollar technological research and development corporation. We have resources. She thinks that she's my sister. I'm just supposed to live that lie? That's the assignment. What's the next step? Get her into that family's life. Destabilizing the boy's support structure will make him more vulnerable... receptive to her. And she'll just know what to do? She won't know she knows anything. She'll just think that she's the new girl... hoping to make friends. I recommend that you take her for a test drive. Don't try to make contact. Just ease her in. Watch for cracks in the facade. I don't think Adam meant for us to take these studies literally. It's basic science. Your body won't feel the burn until it reaches the temperature of the fire. So I need to keep my internal temperature constant. I understand what I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why. This isn't... about walking on coals. This is about you using your mind to change the physiology of your body. You can do it. Come on. Focus. Hey! You're on the planning committee? - Uh, that's sweet. - Actually, no. We're here to talk to you. Oh, yeah? About what? Well, we were wondering... How do I put this? Let's cut to the chase. We're revirginizing. We need to know what your people do for fun. My people? Yeah, you know, the pure types. You're serious? Revirginizing? We're a little adrift, socially speaking. Okay, well, uh, it's not that complicated. For example, the bonfire committee. Yeah, we're not so much committee folk. We'll, I guess I can't help you then. Maybe now's a good time to start? Yeah, we can be bonfirey. Okay, well, uh, tiki oiling or barbecue scrubbing? You go ahead. I'll hold your purse. Go ahead. Go. You made 400 cupcakes for the bonfire? Yeah, well... keeps me busy. I appreciate this new Martha Stewart universe you've been inhabiting, but what's going on? Do you think it would be... awful if I didn't go back to work? I didn't know that was an option. I've been waiting to feel ready, but lately I'm starting to wonder if I ever will. But you love your job. I did. Then I let myself get too close to a patient and I nearly fell apart when I lost him. Kyle is not an ordinary patient. We all fell apart when he left. If you don't want to go back to work, that's okay. Things at the company are going well. We're gonna be just fine. But I hate that you're doubting yourself. I just don't feel good at it anymore. Why would you say that? With Kyle... I still have a feeling that something's not right, but he won't open up to me. I can't break through. The sex shack. Many a sandy night spent in here. Focus. Why do you guys wanna revirginize? We're trying to make better life choices. So you think having sex is a mistake? Why do you ask? No reason. It's just... What? Tonight's mine and Charlie's two-year anniversary... I don't know. I thought it might be time. No! I mean... I don't think it's a good idea. Why not? I mean... I know he's not perfect, but we've been through so much together and he's been so patient. I feel like I'm finally ready. Major gossip. I don't like gossip. Well, you're not gonna like this, either. But I think there's something that you should know about Amanda. What are you doing? Where are you going? We were just starting to make progress. Sorry. This is important. Wait. Wait! You're letting petty things compromise your destiny. What do you mean, my destiny? Like Baylin said... You can change the world. What if I don't wanna change the world? What if I just wanna be normal? The last time we had this conversation, you made a skylight explode. You're not normal. You're never gonna be. I'm not gonna let you ruin what we're trying to do here. What you're trying to do. I don't wanna do it anymore. I'm taking back what's near and dear. Letting go of all I fear. Holding on with all my might. Saving myself for prom night. Drink. - Okay, now we're born-again virgins. - Yes. B- A-V. BAVs. - It's got a ring to it. - I like it. Are you appreciating the irony that we just held our revirginization ceremony in the sex shack? Is she here? Look at Prince Charming over there. I'm so glad I never slept with him. So many new people. You know what to do. Mingle and blend in. You want me to go with you? No, I don't need my big sister glued to my hip. Have you seen Amanda? - No. - McDonough! Let's go. Come on. You're still hanging out with Charlie? I found myself a little short on friends lately. I'm worried he's not the kind of person he's pretending to be. You would know. Kyle, thank God. All my helpers bailed on me. Sour Patch Kids on me. Hi, Amanda. I was wondering if I could tell you about the cash box. Sure. So when can you break free? You're in a hurry. Yeah. I'm a couple of other things, as well. Hmm, I can see that. Yeah. Just give me five minutes. You promise? Yeah. Okay. What's that look? Back in business, huh? Yeah. Yeah, my business, man. I don't think you're as careful as you think. What's that supposed to mean? It means you better go find your girlfriend before she isn't. You suck. - What? - You heard me. There's absolutely nothing rational or intelligent or remotely kind about the way you've been treating me. - Lori, I... - Let me finish. I feel hurt and angry and, at the moment, a little drunk, so... I'm here to tell you that you suck. I know I've been crazy. If I could figure out how to explain it, I would. How can we be together if you can't talk to me about what you're going through? Oh, my God. You wanna break up. This is a place where the silent treatment is not gonna fly. If you wanna break up, you're going to have to say it. I wanna break up. And I suppose a why would be asking too much. I just, um... I can't. Well, that's great. Really nice. Really mature. I mean, it doesn't matter anyway. I've already erased you. You and me? Done. Never happened. It's going well, right? People are having fun? Are you? I will now that work's done. There's something I was hoping to talk to you about. What's up? If you knew a secret about somebody, would you tell them even though it might hurt them? Is is it something someone told you never to tell? No, but they probably don't wanna hear it from me. - Kyle, what's this about? - Amanda, they're calling for more sodas over there. I just... Oh, it never ends. All work and no play. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm being a good friend. What are you doing? Don't pull that innocent stargazer crap with me. Amanda's the only one who falls for it. Now what the hell do you think you're doing? Kyle, look at me. I'm talking to you. Oh, hey, sorry. You know, you ought to be nice. Out of the way. Jessi, stop! Let go. It's cool. Go for a walk. What happened? I don't know. I... What do you think you're doing? I'm gonna find Amanda. I wont let you lie to her; it's not right. Oh, right, I forgot. You're the guy who refuses to throw a punch. - Tanner, give it a rest. - Hey, whose side are you on? - No one's. - Well, then stay the hell out of it. Fire. - Somebody... - Oh, my God! There's a girl in there! Get help! Somebody call 911! Help! It's too hot. Mind over matter. Everything I had walked away from was right here in front of me. Everything I didn't want to be was everything I knew exactly how to do. We need help over here! Get down, Kyle! Get down! She's breathing! How are you not burned? Go! Get outta here! Run! How... Please don't ask me any more questions. Why? Because you'll want to know why I can do what I can do and I won't be able to explain it to you because... I can hardly explain it to myself. But I can... help you figure it out. You don't have to be in this alone. I'm not. I have you and this family. And I don't want anyone to have a reason to take me away. I wouldn't let that happen. If anyone found out, you might not have a choice in the matter. We just got you back. If it means never letting you go again... no one else needs to know that you're different. Nicole, I don't want to be different. I just want to be ordinary. Honey... we could ignore all the things about you that you can't explain and you could try to act like everybody else, but tonight there was a girl trapped inside a burning building and your only instinct was to save her. That's who you are. And there is nothing ordinary about it. Crap. So busted. Before you say anything, yes, I have been drinking. And, yes, I know it's not a good idea. And, no, I cannot promise that I will never do it again. I do, however, recognize that I'm using it as a crutch to hide from the mistakes of my past, and I can assure you that I intend on living a much less destructive life for myself in the future as soon as I... figure out what my life is supposed to be. I love you, and I didn't drive. Oh, and I'm a virgin. Again. She's not actually getting away with that, is she? Good. Cupcake, anyone? Where's Kyle? He seemed a bit out of it today. He was feeling a little down. I talked to him. Then he'll be fine. You're good at that. He's right, you are good at that. Then I guess it's time to stop running from it. Oh, so how was the rest of your night? Uneventful. I don't think they did it. You don't? I have great sex radar. I can tell. Besides, Amanda's a textbook case. She'd want the night to be perfect, and last night's... pyrotechnic near-tragedy was hardly the ideal setup. I hope you're right. And voting season's over in five, four, three, two... I think we're about to get sage words of wisdom, Kyle style. You mean, like, why are we both so worried about what other people think of us? Or we can't be liked until we like ourselves. Ooh, I bet it's that we get to decide who we really are, not anyone else. Huh. Interesting. You're good. - Save me. - From what? The list just came out. I don't want any part of it. Do we really need any more ways to be mean? That's what I say. Hey, I didn't see you leave last night. You missed all the craziness. How's the girl from the fire? She's going to be completely fine. I guess she got out just in time. That's a relief. It's a miracle is what it is. - Let me ring you up. - Crap! Are you on it again? Worse. I'm not even on it at all. But you are. What? I guess that just goes to show how wrong it can be, huh? Totally. Hey, who got "Biggest Slut" anyway? What? What's going on? I think they saw this. What? That's a really stupid joke. Very funny, everybody. Very funny. That's good. Amanda, it's... it's a joke. It's not a joke. I'm sorry, but it's not. I know. I slept with him. She's lying. She is? It doesn't look like it. - Amanda... - Stop. Just stop. This is what you wanted to tell me. You didn't think I wanted to hear it from you. You were wrong. In life, everybody gets labeled. Charlie was a cheater, giving Amanda the label of the betrayed. With the breakup of the "Best Couple," Declan and Lori are left with a new label: the heartbroken. People try to tell us who we're meant to be, but it's up to us to decide whether or not the label fits. After everything I'd done to fight it, I finally understood the label I was meant to have. I would never be normal or ordinary. My destiny... was to be extraordinary. This is the label I've accepted, and now it's my responsibility to earn it.
