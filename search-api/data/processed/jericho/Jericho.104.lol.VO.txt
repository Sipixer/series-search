maybe Denver. Are we under attack? This could've been a test. Could've been an accident. Look, I know you're telling people it was an accident but if it was an attack, Sheriff and there's chaos out there, you might not want the wrong people knowing that Jericho is still here. Dale Turner's mother died tonight in another explosion --Atlanta. --Oh, my God. --Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air? --Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho. A direct, concentrated hit. Anyone exposed too long... How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins? Stanley. No, hey! No, uh-uh. Stanley, don't touch her. How do you know the rain's radioactive? Denver's pretty far away. Well, we don't know how many bombs there were. Oh, my God. We got something! Are they just reporting it or are they behind it? Maybe we're being invaded. If this country is at war, we need to know it. More than electricity or food, this town needs information. --We can't just sit here in the dark. --He's right. Makes us too vulnerable. We could organize a group of people send them out in every direction --The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. --Let's hope not. I'm telling you, it's the Midwest. From the skyline, I'm thinking Cincinnati. I wish we could read the license plates. Let's make Cincinnati a question mark. --Jake. --Hey, Stanley. Hey, Bonnie. --Anything new? --No, not since yesterday. Shep and Gray should have been back by now. Our radios went silent about 50 miles out. God, it makes you wonder what happened to whoever shot this. I think that might have been the last thing they ever saw. The generator's running out of gas. We're going to lose the TV. I'll take care of it. How can you? Gas pumps don't work at the station with the power down. Look, I don't want you to worry. Sorry, folks. We're closing early tonight. Take a flashlight, it's dark out there. What? It's only 9:30. You heard her, let's move it, folks. Time to go home. Let's move it out. --Hey. --Hey. --Is the generator out? --No, out of booze. --Any more images? --No, just the same loop. Come on, I'll walk you home. Where do you live? That way. So is it weird being home after so long? A little bit. I still can't get used to Bailey's without the mechanical bull. Stanley must have cried when they took that out. He had the record. When did the Pizza Garden become the Cyberjolt Cafe? Oh, when the Health Department shut down the Pizza Garden. What?! --Oh, don't tell me you liked the Pizza Garden. --I used to work there washing dishes. Oh, you must not have done a very good job. That came from the alley. It's the pharmacy. Why don't you go get some help? Help... H... Help. Jake. Who is he? I don't know. Help me get him out of here. Not without gloves or a hazmat suit. We got to get him to a doctor, now. Is that radiation sickness? I think it might be. --Heather, Heather. Get her out. --Okay. Let's go. Come on, Bill, let's go. --Help us pick him up. --I'm not touching him. No way. Not me. He could be contagious. He's not contagious, Bill. I'm sorry, Stanley. What if it was me lying here, Bill? Would you walk away then? We could get sick touching that guy. It's not like with you, Stanley. We don't even know who this guy is. I just stopped by Bailey's to check on the TV signal. --Can't you cut your husband some slack? --And that took three hours? --I was only there for, like, an hour. --We're in a state of emergency, Eric. I'm aware of that, April. Dr. Peterson's gone to Kansas City to look for his daughter. --And Dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours. --Well, I am here now. --What do you want from me? --And you... decided to go have a beer. I've got a baby on a ventilator and the generator is almost out of gas. Well, don't you have a hand pump? Who'd pump it? Out of the way. Out of the way. Out of the way! --April, he's having trouble breathing. --Get him in Room Three. Who is that? Who's in there? Hello? Who is that? --It's just me, Mrs. Leigh. --Oh, Dale. What are you up to? --You scared me to death. --It was supposed to be a surprise. What? Oh... Where did you get all this? The train that never showed up. It smashed into a car. There's a ton of food just sitting on it. It's just about five miles outside of town. Well, we can't just take it, it's not ours. Not all of it, anyway. The town took your food. Well, it was an emergency. And so is this. The hell with them. Who is this man? Anyone recognize him? Not so far. Those burns... --Does that mean that he was close to the blast? --Why'd he come to Jericho? --It's a hell of a way from Denver. --Maybe he's related to someone in town. Then why'd he break into the pharmacy? --Any I.D.? --No, just some keys. He doesn't even have a wallet. --Is he going to be okay? --Depends on the dose that he got. Son, you and Stanley should go wash up. --Those clothes might still be contaminated. --There's a shower down the hall. Dad. We got another situation. There's not much more gas in the generator here. Bailey's tavern went dark tonight. That was the only satellite dish in town getting a signal our only link to the outside world. --You okay? --Yeah. We're going to have to get people to siphon gas out of their cars. What if more come? There's not enough gas to keep the clinics going for all of them. --You saying we ought to turn them away? --No, I'm saying we have limited resources. Well, for right now, let's just get as much as we can. Some of the nurses are spooked. They're worried about contamination. Honey, I'll do anything I can to help you. If you could, keep an eye on this baby then I could see to the other patients. Sure. I hope to God the power doesn't go. Look, we'll do everything we can until we can't. Dad, it's Sam. Dad, I'm thirsty, are you in there? --Any word from Shep or Gray? --No, Mayor. Still can't get 'em on the radio. Maybe they got captured by those tanks Stanley saw. Those tanks are probably just National Guard --okay? So-- --You don't know that. --They could be-- --Shh. They could be China, they could be Iran. Al Qaeda, North Korea-- anybody who hates us. They could be coming here and what's our line of defense? You're looking at it. Jake? Oh. Had to take a shower. --Go ahead. --No, I I did; I just took a shower. Oh, right. So what's up? I... April said that the medical center was running low on gasoline for the generator and it occurred to me that if we had a length of hose and a funnel, we could siphon gas out of our cars. Then it occurred to me there's all that gas in the tanks at Murthy's gas station and if we could get enough suction we could get all the gas we wanted... Would a water pump do it? Bonnie. This could be my brother. --Is this how they die? --No. Stanley didn't get it this bad. --He could still got cancer. --No, we don't know that. Listen. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Take care of him. I'm going to have to put him on a ventilator it'll use up power but-- But the baby has the better chance for survival --save the generator for the baby. --Hey, hey, hey, what about him? Give him something for the pain. --Keep him comfortable. --Sit back and watch him die. Well, I don't like it, Jake, but that's the most rational option we have right now. Unless you can think of something better. --Will your generator last until morning? --I think so. All right, give me until then. Can you tell me your name? Victor. Miller. Victor. Victor, you're in a medical clinic. --Okay, we're going to take care of you. --No, no. They're coming. They're coming. So how long do you think he'll be unconscious? Could be a long time. If he ever wakes up again. Who are "they"? Who's coming? Well, maybe he saw passengers from one of those planes. He could've meant terrorists. Unless he wakes up, we don't know what kind of danger we're in. For right now, hire as many deputies as you can use them to help you get gas. Clinic's running low. But it's not my gas, it belongs to Noraco. It's no use to anyone, Mr. Murthy. Without electricity, the pumps don't even work. --And we'll leave you an I.O.U. for the 500 gallons. --I could be fired. With all due respect, who's going to fire you? It's a different world now, Mr. Murthy. All right, let's get them open. Stanley will be here any second. They're never coming back. The district manager, any of them. Are they? No. Shortly after my mother died, my husband was transferred to St. Louis. It was hard to leave Memphis, because it was our home. But eventually we learned to love it. How did your mother die? M.S. Aly, what area of St. Louis are we from? --Kirkwood. --Which is where? --Near Powder Valley. Lots of hiking, trails and nature. We love to hike. --Sam, where'd you go to school? --The Crow School. Crow Island School. God, we've gone over this so many times. And we'll go over it again and again until we get it right. Mom... You know what, I can't keep doing this. Keep Samuel inside. I've got my story. Hey. We lived in a two-bedroom house we drove a green Volvo, we had a stay-at-home mom, which is bull because she worked all the time because our dad was never around. Upstairs. Go on. --You got a minute? --Of course. You probably heard the, uh, Sheriff's been killed, along with three more of our men. I heard. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Well, we're down to just me and Bill, and neither of us is trained for a national emergency. I don't think anyone is prepared for this. We need a few more deputies. --And I thought since you were a cop in St. Louis and all... --No. It's a very flattering offer, but I'm still settling my family. It'd just be for the time being. Look, Mr. Hawkins, people are on edge. All right, we've got break-ins and kids vandalizing. We just need some more manpower to show people there's still law and order in this town. All right. When do I start? You're already on the clock. We're asking everyone in town to donate five gallons of gas. Sorry, honey. I need my car. But, Gracie, if the clinic goes down, people could die. I sympathize, Eric, but I already gave this town my whole store. Someone else can donate gas. Bill. What's up? I'm going to head to the clinic with what I've got. How are things on your end? It's not looking good. We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic. People are scared, Eric. They're hoarding. Maybe we can't afford to be so polite. I couldn't find an empty pesticide container. --I thought this water tank might do. --No, no, we can't use steel. There's too much risk of static. One spark, the whole thing could blow sky-high. We don't have time to look for something else. Well-well, who's going to fill it? --Well, what do you want to do, draw straws? --No, I'll do it, you got Bonnie to take care of. Don't be a martyr. I've already been irradiated. --I'm doomed. --No, you're going to live to be 100, remember? --Our pacts never work out. --Let's just do this before we think about it too much. Get off the truck, Stanley. Get off the truck. Back up. Hey, Allison. This place has been a zoo all day. --Uh, that's $1.69. --Okay. --You got the last bag of corn chips. --I'll give you 20 bucks for them. --She picked them up first. --Fine, I'll give you the 20. Or how about this? I'm having a party. If you give me the chips, then I'll invite you. --I don't even know you. --So? It's not like there's anything else to do. You're awesome. Come by anytime, it's the big house at the top of the Pines. Okay, well, thanks, I guess. Hi. Oh, God... The generator's down! Somebody call April. Hurry. We've lost all his machines. --He's not breathing. --Okay, I've got to get to the baby and I only have one hand pump. You used to be a nurse, Gail. You'll do fine. Let's go. Keep a steady pace. Uh, guys, we have a problem. It's stuck. No, no... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't feel bad. --I'll loosen it up for you. --No. The gas has been sloshing around in there building up fumes. --If you force the cap, and it sparks... --What do you want to do, huh? Look, with all the static electricity built up we could blow the thing to kingdom come. That was dumb. All right, here, get that to him. Let's go! I can't get a heartbeat. Let's go! All right, got it. Go, Stanley. How's he doing? --He was down for about two minutes. --I need help with the cardiac feed. See that black switch? Can you turn that on? Oh, right. I invited you. --Oh, yeah, but, you know I don't... I don't have to... --No, forget it. Come in. Hey, where's April? Come on. Come on. April... I got 75 gallons of gas. For the generator. Thanks. We got it covered. Sky, look who invited himself. Just put it over there. Why are you such a jerk when you're with your friends? --Did I interrupt a lover's spat? --Stop it, Lisa. You know what? I'm gonna go home. I only came here 'cause you begged me to. Just... go home. Victor! Victor. It's okay. April! April! Vic... Victor, you said they're coming. Who's coming? They need... help. Who does? Who needs help? 20 from... Denver. Where are they, huh? Where are they? Lake... A lake? --Boat. Boat dock. --A lake with a boat dock? A lake with a boat dock. What road is it on, do you remember? I... have my... daughter. --...coming... --April! Can I help you? Hey, turn that down. --Yeah, we had a complaint that you're using too much power. --And? --And... the party's over. --You can't do this. --This is a private home. --All right, everybody pack it up. --How much gas you using to run this place, Skylar? --None of your business. It's my generator, it's my gas. Right. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Just go home. Jimmy. Jimmy! You got to get over here. We found Shep's truck. Bill? No sign of Shep, but look what I found inside. Looks like Victor Miller forgot his wallet. This is the man you were talking about? The... The stranger in the hospital? Yeah. You recognize him? No. I just think we should ask him what he did with your friend Shep. April, we need to talk to Victor Miller. --He's unconscious. --I think you need to wake him up. No. Still the same stuff. Look at all the people running. What if they come here? Hey. You worked a miracle. Generator's full; we can go three more days. Great, three days. Hey. Everything's going to be all right. You know, when you say it, I almost believe it. Eric, you there? Go, Jimmy. We found Shep's truck. Meet us at the clinic. I'm on my way. It doesn't matter. We have got to go look for his family. Why'd he have Shep's truck? We need to know what he did with him. --I know, but we can't just torture a dying man. --No one is torturing anyone. We could give him a shot of adrenaline. --It'll wake him up enough to question him. --He's dying of third degree burns. --It'll be like waking him up on fire. --Uh... Our people are dying out there. Shep may already be dead. --We need to protect ourselves, Jake. --We need to protect ourselves from this. Jake, Shep, he's one of us. --We need to find out what this guy did to him. --Hey, he is going to die, anyway. But he could save some people's lives. Eric. --I'd like to do this myself. --No, I'm not leaving him. Okay. What's going on in there? --They're asking him a few questions. --Like hell they will. That's my patient. --Let go of me. --We need information. You have no right. --He could be a murderer. --And that gives you the power to do anything that you want? Yes. Yes. Victor, it's going to be okay. We'll make this quick, all right? Hey. The car you drove here-- did someone give it to you? No, no. It was... It was... on the side... of the road. Okay. It... It was... running. Okay, okay. --But was there anybody in it? --No. I had... to help them. Where are they? --Do you remember anything else about the lake? --It burns. --Was it off a dirt road? --It burns. --He needs morphine. --Was your daughter at Bass Lake? --Y-Yes. --He needs morphine, Jake. --Please, please. Hey. Hey! We said families only, hmm? --Why? Why did you go back to Denver? --I... --I couldn't let them die. --It was a mistake, Vic, --because now we are a man down. --No. Some... some... S-Someone... Someone flipped. A traitor. There's...a tra... traitor. Do you know who it was? Come on, man, tell me. --Vic, who was it? --I... Tell me. Do you know who it was? You... know. He's gone. We had to do it. I thought you were going to a party, hon. You're worth ten of her. --Ten of who? --Skylar Stevens. --She's not a bad person. --Hmm. We're not like them. They can be nice sometimes, but don't be fooled. That's what my mom used to say. Well, she was a smart lady. You scared? 'Cause I remember when I did something wrong waiting for my old man to come home. Baby, what you did today-- that wasn't just you going to a party. It wasn't. You put your mother, your brother, all of us at risk. Do you hear? And if you pull something like this again girl, you have no idea how scared you'll be. I need a few volunteers. There's a group of people just outside of town. No way, man! It's too dangerous out there! They're at Bass Lake. They may have radiation sickness. We need to bring them here get them to the clinic before it's too late. --Turn it back on! --We've seen it. We've seen it 100 times. A man just died in our clinic. Our clinic! He was traveling with his daughter and about 20 other people. All right, it could have been Shep or Gray or any of us. They need our help. Are we going to help them? Or are we just going to sit here watching the same three images over and over? Jake? I'll donate gas if you need to fill your car to get them. --Thank you, Mary. --I'll go with you. Thank you. Anybody else? --I'll go with you, Jake. I'll go. --Let's go. --Yeah, me, too. --Thank you. Earlier today, we buried 20 people-- refugees from Denver. People we didn't know, but were prepared to welcome into our town. Unfortunately, they died of radiation poisoning before we could reach them. For those people from Denver, and for our own people, for Sheriff Dawes and Deputy Riley for Deputy Conner and Deputy Salem... ...for people out there somewhere we know nothing about who might be suffering and dying right now-- I ask that we take a moment of silence. If you've lost a loved one, would you please stand? If someone you love is missing, would you join those standing? We stand because we know that every life matters. We have to fight for every life, even when it seems hopeless, even when we're afraid, because the battle ahead isn't just for our survival it's for our humanity. I think I'm going to be okay. Jake. Hi. You're a good man for trying to help someone you didn't even know. --Hey, you thirsty again? --No. Couldn't sleep. --Where did you go to school, Sam? --Crow Island. --Who is your dad? --You. --Who loves you more than anything in the world? --You. And, Sam,
