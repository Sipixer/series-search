came from the west, maybe Denver. Maybe one of you would like to tell me just exactly who you think is in charge here. Gray's finally getting that election, huh? Is the mayor nervous? Not as nervous as he should be. You're blushing. It's a reaction to the iodine, okay? It's a reaction to having your shirt off in front of me. Did you steal from me, Dale? After everything I have done for you? Everything you've done for me? You wouldn't have a store if it wasn't for me. Where are you going? To get the generator. From Jonah? Yeah. Even if you get a generator, it won't end there. If you push my father, Jake,he'll push back. Mitchell Cafferty, that is not yours! Whoa, easy, big fella. Mitchell and the other guys don't see our arrangement the way I do. Gracie, we've got all this food out here. We sure could use a place to distribute it. You'd have to stop doing business with Jonah. GRACIE: I'm in. SAMUEL: Dad! I need you. Right now! Dad! Hey. What you got there? A football. Yeah, yeah. I know that. What's it for? You have to teach me to play. Why? 'Cause I don't know how. Well, I'm not sure I know how. Okay, okay, uh... I know a little. Come on. What, this is something that has to be done right now? Yeah. Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Putting a hand pump on this well, so we don't have to waste generator power for water. There's really a well under there? First well in Jericho, according to the sign. I remember another first that happened right there. You shouldn't have dared me. Nobody had to dare you. Yeah, well, I remember one of your finer moments. Right over there, behind Bailey's. Mm-hmm. Yeah, let's not talk about that. I could get sick right here. Some people can't hold their apple wine coolers. No. No. You kept singing that depressing song by that uh, that bald girl. Sinead O'Connor, and that was our song. Our song? I never got to vote. Hey, um, let's-let's talk about what happened right there. The day you went to get medicine for your dad. Heather kissed you. She talked to me about it. Yeah, I-I don't want her to get hurt. I have no plans to do that. Mrs. Leigh? Mrs. Leigh! Mrs. Leigh. Oh, Gracie! (sobbing): No! Dad. Do we know who did this? No witnesses. She was already gone by the time Dale found her. Sure Dale didn't kill her? The blood on the floor has been drying for a long time. And that boy is incapable of doing something like that. Nobody is incapable under the right circumstances. JIMMY: Mayor Green, Mitchell Cafferty has something to tell you. What the hell... You back off! Easy. Jonah said he killed her, but I didn't believe him. Jonah Prowse said he did this? Jonah showed up at the compound, and his arm was all torn up. He said that he killed Gracie because she wouldn't do business with him anymore. He was trying to prove to me and the rest of the guys that he was still in charge. Where's Jonah now? I don't know. He hit me with a tire iron, I just saw him driving off. You believe this guy, Johnston? He broke out of our jail. He's a fugitive. Listen, I wouldn't blame you if you locked me up right now. But if you want any help tracking down Jonah, I'm ready. Eric, why don't you talk to Mitch here? See if he can help. Let's go. This guy is a criminal, Johnston. Yeah, I know what he is. I'm trying to figure out what he knows. We can arrest him anytime. We just had our first murder in 30 years. And I've been mayor of this town for 25 of those years! Maybe that's the problem. You still think Jericho's the same sweet little town, it was before the bombs. We need somebody who understands... Save it for the election, Gray. This is what the election is about! You want to get this civilian off the crime scene? Just tell me the name of the song. If you don't remember, I'm not telling you. I remember it was sad and depressing. You must not remember our relationship. It's a great house. Yeah, thanks. The first one Roger and I looked at. We made an offer immediately. Well, when you know what you want, why keep looking? Thanks for walking me home. Thanks for helping with the well. Bye. Shh! Shh-shh-shh. Don't say a word. www.1000fr.com Present Capture:XXY Sync:FRM@openext</font> I just heard. I'm so sorry, Dale. The only lead we have to go on right now is that Mitchell Cafferty said Jonah confessed. Mitch is not much of a witness. I was there yesterday, when Gracie stood up to Jonah. She said she wasn't going to do business with him anymore. He couldn't have been too happy about that. All right. We need to pull a couple of guys off of patrol and go find them. If Jonah did this, he is not going to come in willingly. I'm coming, too. No, Dale. I know how to shoot a gun. Son, the last thing you need to be doing right now is waving a gun around at the man you think killed Gracie. He did it. You said yourself she stood up to Jonah, and now she's dead. You're not going, Dale. There's something that I have to talk to you about. Gray's going to use this for all it's worth, Dad. A lot of people are starting to listen to him. Well,you listen to me. I've known Gracie all my life. We're going to find the man who did this. We're going to bring him to justice. And I do not want to hear another word about this election. Yes, sir. Any news on Jonah? No, no one in here has seen him. Jonah better hope that Gray doesn't find him. He says he's going to make an example out of him. What's he going to do, string him up? You can't kill someone in the middle of Main Street. Yeah? Tell that to Gracie Leigh. Gray came back from Topeka a changed man. He's not messing around. And I, for one, think he's got the right idea. W-wait a minute. You're not voting for Gray Anderson? I'm not going to answer that. This is still America. Yeah, just barely. MIMI: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Okay, that was good. Um... let's try again. What was good about that? I don't know. Just pick up the ball. Why can't you throw it to somebody else when they're chasing you? I don't know what you mean. When they're chasing you. When who is chasing who, son? The guys that want the ball. God, why do you suck at this? Hey, you got to watch your mouth. Hey, it's too cold for you to be out here playing without jackets. How's it going? Not so well. I need to get back to work. Son, the trick is the grip, all right? Put your little finger and your ring finger... no, this one. Yeah, it should go on the white stripe. Thumb goes underneath it. Okay? And just go... just-just throw it to me. Okay? All right. There's nothing wrong with that. Hey, I thought basketball was your game. They're kind of all my games. Hey, Jake. Need your help. I'll be right there. So, where we going? Jonah's compound. My dad and Eric are meeting us there. You think he's still out there. I think he doesn't have a lot of places to hide or a lot of people to turn to. Well, he must have some other friends in town or maybe family. Hold on. What if they can't find him? He can't just get away with this. They'll find him. What am I supposed to do? Sit down, Dale. There's some things you need to know. Come on. After the bombs went off and your mother died, Gracie changed her will. She left her store to you. I was the witness. The papers are in a locked box at the bank along with the keys. Nobody expects a 16-year-old boy to run that business. You need to take some time and think about what you're going to do with all this. I'll be there if you need me. I can't take her store. I quit. I called her a liar. I said the worst things... That happens in families. People get mad, say things. But that doesn't erase everything that came before. Gracie loved you. And she wanted you to have her store. Come on, guys, check around back. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing, Gray? Manhunt, same as you. Got to thinking that Jonah might be coming to Emily for sympathy. We can handle this. Yeah? Who's that? Those of us who have been training to protect this town. You're doing a hell of a job. This is dangerous, Gray. We can't just have a bunch of vigilantes running around town. It's a little late for that. I've seen two other truckloads of guys running around this neighborhood. The town is heading towards chaos. It's not going to calm down till somebody finds Jonah Prowse. What's going on? We're looking for Jonah Prowse. He killed Gracie Leigh. Since he's your father... Not in any way that matters. Well, we'd like to look around a little bit. No. She wouldn't hide him, Gray. We're going to look around a little bit and then we'll be gone. Hey. There's no sign of him in the backyard. That's good news. Come on, I'll patrol with you for a while. Let's go, Gray. Watch this house. Let's go. Thank you. Where is he? I don't know what you're talking about. You didn't even blink when you heard about Gracie. Where is he? Jake... I didn't kill Gracie Leigh. Then why are you holding us at gunpoint? 'Cause maybe you won't believe me. Maybe you'll try and be some kind of hero and take me in. He's bleeding. He needs a doctor, Jake. JONAH: I'm not going into town. Jake, you're going to help me get out of here. I'm not helping you do anything. For all I know, you're a murderer. I didn't do it! I walked out this morning-- found myself surrounded by my own men. Mitchell Cafferty's there. He tells me Gracie Leigh's been murdered. When I asked him who did it, Mitchell says to me, "You did. And I saw the whole thing." Before I knew it, he's got a knife on me. And he sliced my arm open. But I took a crowbar to him before he could finish the job. Your guys sided with Mitch? It didn't sit too well with them that my little girl stole our haul from the food drop and I stopped Mitchell Cafferty from putting a bullet in her brain. So they did this to you because you wouldn't kill me? Okay, okay, okay. Get him up. (groans) We got to take him in. But we got to be careful. There are a lot of people out there who would rather shoot first and ask questions later. Mitchell will keep coming until he kills me. We'll take him to Town Hall. You'll be safe there. Those guys will walk right in that jail... and kill me and anyone else who gets in their... What'd you come here for, huh? You put your own daughter at risk... Shut up! Just get him... just get him a doctor. Okay, okay Dale. Hey. What happened? She was murdered... stabbed. Dale... Dale! I just heard. SEAN: You the one who found her? Yeah. Open the place up. Let's have some fun. Back off, Sean. What do you care? It's not your store. Yeah, it is. All of it. What are you talking about? Gracie gave it to me. Worked out for you then, huh? Dale... Stop it. You're lucky I don't take you out right here. SKYLAR: Get out of here, Sean. Sean, you all right? Come on, get out. See you around? Hey. Did you find the guy? No, no, not yet. Um, look, I got to check on something in the basement, and then I'm going back out there with Gray and his men... Between that basement and all the men with guns... Hey. What's wrong? Robert, is this what we have to look forward to? People showing up, you grabbing that damn gun and running off? It's not all that different than before. Yeah, that worked out so well for us, didn't it? So when are we going to lose you? Lose me? I don't know that you are. The kids are getting used to having you here. Yeah? What about you, D? Me, too. I don't want to go anywhere. I like being here. You lock the basement-- or you tell those men to fight their own battles and stay home. The damn world ended. Can't you just be with us? Kenchy, I need you to come with me. Where? I'll tell you on the way to the medical center, all right? Look, we need some supplies. Oh... you want me to kill someone? You need a real doctor, my friend. A real doctor wouldn't do what I need done. Come on. Let's go. How bad is it? Well, whoever did this used a serrated edge. We could have done without that. Did you stop the bleeding? Mostly. I gave him a shot for the pain. Probably fall asleep now. Is this the guy? The murderer everybody's talking about? He says no. Oh, no one's going to believe him. They're out for blood. He's not going to get a fair shake. Yes, he will. I'll go get my dad. He can bring him in, make sure things are done the right way. It's Jonah's only chance. Okay. All right. Lock the door. Mind if I wash my hands? We're not safe. Gracie's death makes that all too clear. I tell you what, Mary. The chaos I saw when I was fighting my way back home to Jericho, well now, it's right here on our Main Street. Criminals like Jonah Prowse think we're easy targets now. Well, I'll tell you what, Neil. I think we should go find Jonah Prowse and make an example of him. And he shouldn't get to sit around for 15 years before he gets what's coming to him. We got to send a message. (murmured assent) Crime will not be tolerated. We are willing to do whatever it takes to keep Jericho safe. So please remember at the polls tomorrow... Dad, I need your help. ...to vote Gray Anderson for a new Jericho. Watch it. Sorry about that, Ma. Oh, no, no. We are not doing that. Come on, now. You can call me Pa. Seriously, that really creeps me out. Good creepy or bad creepy? What? Look. What we did... it's not what you think. I had a weak moment. It was a mistake. Well, I'm really good at making mistakes. Yes, you are. Believe me, it was a pleasant surprise, but we can't do this anymore. Because of Bonnie? Yeah, I'll talk to her. She'll be fine. Do you know how many second dates I've had in the last five years? I'm guessing not many. And do you know why? Yeah, because you're obnoxious and demanding and totally self-absorbed. Yeah. And you are sweet, simple and bull-headed. You can't handle someone like me. This will never work. Ah, that's what they said about Brangelina. Are you seriously quoting Us magazine right now? Yeah, what do you think they'd call us? Stimiley? Mimiley? St... Stimi. You are such an idiot. You're harboring a criminal, Jake. He's hurt. And he needed a doctor, so I got one, and then I came to you. Well, we have got us one hell of a problem, Jake, because if anyone knows that you've been hiding Jonah Prowse while the whole town has been out looking for him, they'll throw us all in jail. Jonah says Mitchell killed Gracie and then he set him up. What do you think? He might be telling the truth. You're not a judge or a jury. Now, we're gonna go get him, we're gonna bring him in... Good, that's what I came here for! Well, you better hope... He's gone. Let's get him! Come on! That's him! Let's get him! Well, well... Jonah Prowse. Can't get away from us, huh? Pick him up! Get him up, guys. All right, let's go. Get out of the truck. Do you solemnly swear to uphold the laws of the State of Kansas and faithfully discharge the duties of Mayor? I do. Congratulations. Friends, thank you for placing your trust in me to lead Jericho through this difficult time. This town belongs to all of us and we must work together to survive. The resources of this town also belong to all of us, and therefore, as my first official act as Mayor, I am ordering the food from the food drop to be distributed immediately. And now, to the subject of security. One of our citizens was brutally murdered. But her murderer will be held to account. Justice will be swift and sure, you have my word. Don't take that too serious. They're not calling for your head on a platter. Why'd you run? My father was going to bring you in... Your father just got shown the door, Jake. I didn't want this to happen. Jonah made his own bed. I'm sorry your dad lost the election. I feel if I hadn't gotten you involved... No. The people spoke, and they got exactly what they wanted. What do you want, Mitchell? Just visiting. Hey, sweetie? Do you mind giving me and my man here a little privacy? It's okay. I'll be back in a second. So I hear you and I are going to be partners now. Where'd you get that? Well, you're running the store, you're gonna need protection. From who? Jonah's in jail. This has nothing to do with Jonah. Don't make the same mistake that Gracie made. I get half the cut. Or those people out there are going to be putting flowers and candles on the sidewalk for you. Okay? See you tomorrow... and the next day. And the next day. Are you knitting? Yeah, it's one of the few things that ever just zoned me out. I learned in the dorm at Vassar. Not so hot for me now, are you? No, it's just, um... Actually, I think that belonged to my mother. Oh, my God. I am... so sorry. I found it half finished in a trunk upstairs. It's okay. No, no, no. I'll-I'll put it back. No, no, no. I think... I think you should finish it. No, I couldn't. Look, it's okay. I actually think my mother would have liked you. Really? No, not at all. Manley. Our tabloid name. Mimi and Stanley. Manley. Is that <i>really</i> the message you want to be putting out there? You're right. Good point. Stimi's better. Dad... We're going to have to... take down all these posters. Get this place back to normal. I don't think normal's where we're headed. (chuckles): Yeah. I, uh... I'm sorry. So am I. DALE: Mayor! Mitchell Cafferty did it. What? He killed Gracie. What are you talking about, Dale? He said if I refuse to give him a cut of the store, he'd do to me what he did to Gracie. Let's find Gray. All right, Jonah. Get up. Let's go. Let's go. Where you taking me? You'll find out when we get there. JOHNSTON: Gray, what are you doing? We're moving him to a more secure location. There's a lot of folks who want to rip him apart after what he did. We don't know what he did. He hasn't had a trial yet. Well, these are special circumstances, Johnston. We don't have a judge. As mayor, I formed a tribunal, and he was found guilty. You did what? Mitch just told Dale that he would do to him what he did to Gracie if he didn't go along with him. Well, did anyone else hear him say that? No. That's hardly proof. What? You think I'm lying? I'm not lying. GRAY: He was trying to intimidate you. It doesn't mean he actually did it. JAKE: This is unbelievable. You don't even care who killed her. You just want Jonah. I've got Jonah! He's innocent. He's far from innocent! He's been preying on this town for years! From now on, guys like him go away! We don't coddle them, we don't make deals with them. JAKE: What are you planning on doing, Gray? You going to kl him in cold blood? Say he tried to escape while moving him to a secure location? Who's going to do it? Bill? You gonna put a bullet in Jonah's head when Gray tells you to? I'm not shooting anybody. It's up to you, Gray. Go on. No? This is what you want,right? You make the rules? Decide who lives and dies? Go ahead and do it. But you do it here, in front of me and Dale. In front of everyone. Not... not in some back room with your buddies. Don't let someone else do the dirty work for you, Mayor. You want him dead? You take this gun and blow his brains out. Gray, no. You better be damn sure he's guilty. Because if he's not, you're a murderer, and justice will be swift. HNSTON: Jonah agrees to leave town and not come back. Exile. Worked for the Greeks. The town gets rid of Jonah Prowse, and you get to save face. All right. Now, what about Mitchell Cafferty? Why don't you let me handle that? Look, um... Johnston, I love this town. I just want to keep it safe. Like it always was. What it always was is a democracy. That's easy when things are going all right. But when you're scared or mad, it gets to be a lot harder. I'll try to watch out for that. Oh, I think we'll all be watching. You know, my father-- your grandfather-- he was a... he was an excellent athlete. You know? I mean, all sports, Sam. He won lots of awards when he was in school. But the thing is, when I was your age, he was in the Air Force, and he was gone a lot, and he didn't have time to teach me much, so... Sam, that's why I suck at football. Me, too. I'm sorry about that, son. Yeah. Oh, here she comes. Come on. Okay? Come on. Ready? Hut! You practice hard. There you go, Coach. Hey, hey. I'm here. Okay? Right here. Robert! Hey, isn't that what football players do to each other? This will keep you warm. Emily, when Chris was born... Don't. When Chris was born, you were four years old. Your mother said she wanted a clean break. I was into some bad stuff, and she didn't want you and Chris growing up in it, so I let her go. But I didn't want to. She never got over you. We loved each other. It was like... Like you and Jake. Don't blame Jake for your brother's death. That's on me. I pushed Chris to do that job. He wasn't ready. He wasn't cut out for that kind of life. Jake wanted out. I didn't understand that then, but I sure do now. That boy still loves you. Don't you have a curfew or something? No. Cool. So this is what you've been saving your generator rations for. Nice music, Mary. I'll have cold coffee and candles the rest of my life if I can just have music now and then. You know I love you, right? Yes. Hey. Hey. How did it go? He's gone. It's the best thing for now. Yeah. Yeah. You don't suppose they have any of those apple wine coolers back there, do you? Feel like talking, huh? No. Just the opposite. Hey, Mary, can we get two more of whatever it is you're pouring? It almost looks normal in here. Like the bombs never even happened. Let's stay in here as long as we can, huh? * It's been seven hours and 15 days... * Finally remembered the name of that song. Mary had it on the jukebox. * Since you been gone * Come on. Come on! * I can do whatever I want * * I can see whoever I choose * * I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant * * But nothing * * I said, nothing can take away these blues * * 'Cause nothing compares * * Nothing compares to you... * What about Heather? What about Roger? You know how this goes. We should be grown-ups, and walk away right now. You're right. We should. * Like a bird without a song * * I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard * * But I'm willing to give it another try... * ERIC: Jake! Jake, we got to go outside. Now! Let's go. * Nothing compares... * They need help. Take them inside. Jake! Some of them were on planes that landed in the middle of nowhere. They've been walking for weeks. They must have gone through hell. Oh, my God!
