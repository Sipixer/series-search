- Hey, how you doing? We grew up together over in New Bern. This is Russell and Mike. - Hey. - Yeah, we met. With a dozen full-size windmills, you could power the whole town. I'm gonna help turn the lights on for everyone back home. - You're just going to leave? - Won't be for very long. Johnston, you SOB. How the hell did you lose an election? No, the question is: how did you get to be in charge in New Bern? - They get tired of you being sheriff? - No, I'm still sheriff. Just got a little more authority. Does this thing work? Can we get power from it? Probably sometime tomorrow. Let's get it up as fast as we can. Can we buy some more of these things? You got one of the only salt mines around for 400 miles. - We're going to need food. - Won't see another crop till spring. Spring crop is what I'm talking about. Ten wind turbines for, let's say... ten percent of your spring crop. No, we can't put ourselves in that position. Starve next fall or freeze this winter. Okay, look, we'll give you the food. We can have the wind turbines to you in a couple weeks. We're going to need ten Jericho men to help us build them. Is this about manpower for wind turbines? Or is it more about making sure you get our crops come spring? I am not going to build these things on credit. You want them now? You're going to help make them. What you are about to do... means this town's survival. All right, let's move out. If anything happens to any of them... you're the first one I come for. I know. Hey, Jeff, they're back. I didn't expect to see you till spring, Russell. I thought you might be needing these. Your windmills. It's good to see our guys back, but... it's going to take some time for me to find the guys to replace them. You don't need to replace them. Well, now, wait... our agreement was that we got ten windmills for ten percent of the crops. You'll get your windmills, but we don't need your men. Constantino called it an act of good faith. I didn't think Constantino knew that term. But... I'll take it. Stanley! - Welcome home. - Thanks. Where's Eric? He didn't come back, Mary. He said he wasn't ready. But... I'm sure he'll be back soon. Okay. Thanks. I didn't know you guys were coming back today. - None of us did. - How are you? You okay? Where's Eric? Come here. He didn't come back with us. Why not? When I talked to him, he was still pretty messed up about April's death. He said he was thinking about staying in New Bern for a while to get his head together. - When was this? Three days ago. Then, he didn't show up for work, and I haven't seen him since. I don't know what's going on in New Bern. When I asked about Eric, they couldn't tell me anything. Then, the cops started escorting us wherever we went. Then today, out of nowhere, Russell says, "Pack it up, we're going home", like... like it wasn't safe for us there anymore. Where's my brother? - I don't know. - What? I know he hasn't been seen for a few days. Did you even try to find him? - I asked Constantino. - And? And he told me that they were looking for him. And then this morning, he told me to bring the rest of your guys home. What the hell's going on over there, Russell? Should I be worried about him? Answer me. Should I be worried? I would be. - I'm going with you. - No... you've been gone for weeks. Go home. You need someone who knows their way around New Bern. I'll try to find Heather as soon as I get there. She knows it better than any of us. Look, it's not safe out there. You can't go by yourself. I'm not. I need your help. Season 1 - Episode 19 " Casus Belli " [ Transcript ] swsub.com [ Synchro ] Hutch / aSpro5oo [ www.seriessub.com ] You can't just ride into New Bern and start breaking china, Jake. I got to try and find him. I can't just... There's something going on in that town. I can feel it. Stanley starts asking questions, and they just send them home? Okay, but you understand why I can't just up and leave, right? - He's my brother. - And you said he was upset, so maybe he just... - If you're saying no, just say no. Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no. I'm saying we got to understand the situation. The situation is... he's been missing for three days, and I came to you... for help. Okay. But if we do this, we do it my way. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're home. I missed you guys so much. You're totally back. Mrs. Green. I'm really sorry to bother you like this, but... I thought you should know. Know what? The men came back from New Bern, and Eric wasn't with them. Why not? He decided to stay a little longer. Decided to or Constantino insisted? Stanley talked to him. He said... he said he wasn't ready to come home. - How'd you hurt your hand? - Oh, I just... was trying to fix the copper tubing on my still. It just popped off and cut me. Is alcohol really a priority right now? Actually, it's not to drink. I was trying to make antiseptic for the med center. I should go. - You got any sand over there at the bar?  - Sand? Yeah, I think I can show you a way around that copper tubing. I'll just give you a hand. See you in a bit. Guys... yo, listen. Stop unloading that. Put that back. What the hell is this? - Salt.  - Who gave you permission to take it from the mine? 51% of the mine belongs to me. I just took it from my half. You don't have a half... of anything. Your parents do. Look, I know you still think of me as a child... and I can't help it if that's where you're stuck, but the fact is I have a right to what I own. You are a minor and you don't own anything as long as your parents are still alive. Or do you have some information that I don't have? Look, just... just take the salt back to the mine and don't make me have to send my guys to do it. Proof of residence? We're not from here. Sorry, you're going to need to turn this car around and proceed back the way you came. I'm here to see my brother. His name is Eric Green. You're not hearing me, sir. No one's allowed... No, you're not hearing me. I have to see him. He came here as part of the deal you made with Jericho. Now... Hey, Jake... I want to talk to Phil Constantino. - Get out of the car. - Hell, no. Put your hands on the dashboard. I want to see your hands. That's Johnston Green's son. Let him through. I'll escort him in to see Sheriff Constantino. Go ahead, let him through. Mister, Mister. Do you have any food? I'm sorry, I don't... I'm sorry, I don't have any. All right, ma'am, come on. Get those kids out of there. Hey, come on. Come on, please. I thought we had it bad. What the hell happened here? Ravenwood. My brother is missing. I know. I've got patrols out looking for him. - And no leads? - No. Sorry, I wish there's more I could do. You're the sheriff and the mayor. You can do more. I'm trying, Jake. You sure Eric even wants to be found? What's that supposed to mean? We all knew April. We know what happened. Last I heard that Eric was having a tough time. He'll be fine as soon as we get him home. You know what? Let's face the facts. He might have been attacked. Could be lying in a ditch somewhere. - Why would you say... - Take it easy! The fact is some folks around here aren't too fond of Jericho these days. That's why I sent the workers home today. When your brother went missing, I got worried for their safety. Why? There's been a lot of rumors flying around about your town. What are people saying? They're mad that Jericho didn't warn us about Ravenwood. They think you're going to renege on your part of the food deal. We've had it rough here, okay? They're just looking for somebody to blame. - Where was Eric last seen? - The factory. End of his shift. Look, we're just trying to help. What is it that you want that we're not giving? I want to talk to Heather Lisinski. Take care of each other, Kansas. Anything new from Mr. Hewitt? No, it's just the same bulletin about the riots in Chicago Camp West. Hey, thanks for taking on a shift. Jimmy, it's the least I can do to make myself useful. I feel like such a freeloader sitting around your house all day. You kidding me? You're like the best houseguest ever. You cook, you do the dishes, you never get bored playing Boggle. And we're dreading the day you and your husband work things out. That sounded a lot less insensitive in my head. - I'm sorry. - No, I understand, thank you. Listen... can I talk you about something? Yeah, what is it? Last night Sam and Woody were drawing pictures. That's one of Sam's. I didn't want to bring it up at the house with everyone around, I thought it might be upsetting. No, I'm glad you showed this to me. I'm not a psychiatrist, but that really looks like a kid dealing with some kind of trauma. I'm-I'm not surprised. I mean.... 30 million people died a few months ago. I'll bet there's kids all over the country still trying to process that. Maybe, but it's so specific. The bodies, the house. He's coming by after school. I'll talk to him then. - Thank you. - Sure. Sand keeps the copper from buckling. How'd you learn this? Well... like... most things that are fun and illegal... from my dad. So the stories Eric tells are true. Afraid so. You remember that book... something about... women are from Venus, and men are wrong. Not that I read the book, mind you, but I did,  you know... flip through Gail's copy of it. Lot of stuff in there about men needing to... go off and hold up in a cave sometime. Now, I don't know if this was actually in the book, but... if men can't find a cave, they'll make one. Out of... whatever circumstances happen to be lying around. Yeah, you're probably right. I'm sure that's all it is. This isn't your fault, Mary. It wasn't anybody's fault. I think Eric's figuring that out. This place is the only reason New Bern made it through the Depression. The factory whistle's like a heartbeat to this town. Put the wind turbines binds together just down here. Sheriff! Who's that? It's a friend of Heather's. We met him at Black Jack. Good news. - This guy knows where your brother is. - Really? Where? Eric went home. He and Heather both. They... left this morning. - Home? To Jericho? - Why would they do that? Why didn't they go with the convoy? Well, Heather had to talk him into going. So... by then, the other guys had left. So, I lent them my car and my rifle. They didn't seem worried at all. Probably back in Jericho by now. Right. - Hope they're okay. - Thank you. - We got to clear the building. - All right. What happened? We had to retrofit all the machines after the EMP, and one of them overheated. Caught part of the building on fire. You got what you need? Yeah, mystery solved, I guess. Good. Glad to hear it. If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins will escort you out of town. No. We don't need to be escorted. It's policy. You're big on policy. We almost lost everything when Ravenwood came through here. I'm big on anything that keeps us alive. - Thanks. - No problem. Move the truck. Let them through. - You buying any of that story? - Nope. Neither was Ted. Slipped me this when he shook my hand. - It's an address and... - "Come Alone" So, we done here? Back it up. Let them through. How long have I been gone? No, before you answer that, how long has he been here? - It's very recent really. He hasn't been here that long. I asked you to do one thing for me, Mimi. One thing! You know, you listen to me, Stanley. Your sister is not a child anymore. You can't just throw this fit and kick Sean's ass and think that's going to be the end of it I hope you're going to explain why I can't. Because if you do, she's just going to latch on that much tighter. Unless they really get angry, in which case, the age-old teenage remedy is to run away, which used to mean that they'd hear from them in a couple of days when they ran out of bus money. Nowadays, chances are much better that you'll find their bodies on the side of a road. Look... right now it is under our roof. And it's a pain in the ass, I know, but it's a safe and manageable pain in the ass, and I suggest you let it stay here before it turns into anything more than that. That's Perkins' truck. What's he doing staking out Ted's trailer? Let's ask him. Hand your gun to my friend, and let's pay Ted a little visit. Come on. Where's my brother? I don't know, ask him. He threatened to throw me in jail this morning if I didn't feed you that lie. - So you haven't seen Eric? - No. Not for days. - What about Heather? - She left for work this morning. Next thing I know, they tell me she's gone missing, too. Two people disappear, nobody knows anything? Oh, somebody does. Right? Where is he? Screw you. Hey, come on, Jake, we got to be smarter than that. We need answers. Getting answers... is easy. It's getting the truth... that takes work. When did you last see Eric Green? Look... this is not my thing. I didn't ask you that, did I? Why do you act like we did something wrong? We were attacked. How do you figure that? The those machines didn't overheat this morning at the factory. It was his brother... and that girl. They sabotaged it. They would never do that? We need that factory just as much as you do. - I saw them. - If you saw them, then where are they? They ran away. Hold his knees, please. Look, why would I be staking out a trailer park if we had them? Huh? Constantino put us on alert. He gave a SOS. - SOS? - Shoot on sight. Look at me. What is in that factory? I don't know. No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop. Ask Constantino. Ask Constantino. He knows? Look at me. - We go to the factory. - But Eric... I don't know about Eric. But we cannot search this whole town. So we should go and see what it was that he was risking his life for. All right. You got some place safe you can go? Yeah, my grandfather has an old hunting cabin. You take what's important because you are not coming back here. Get up. On your knees. What is he doing? - Down on your knees. - What? What are you doing? Hawkins! Is that doing it your way? You asked me to come along. - What were you going to do? - You want the truth? Less than you would have. You see, I've done... I've done enough, Jake, to know better. It's the fear of torture that gets results. Actual torture only works in the movies. And this one guy, he was so skinny, you could count his ribs through his shirt. I tried to give him food when I could, but none of us had much so... And then one day, I could just... see it in his eyes. He'd, uh... he'd given up. I never thought I'd be so thankful to live on a farm. From now on, I promise I'll only complain intermittently. Well, we don't have much, but, uh... we'll always have enough, so... Dude, all they need to do is get the Internet back up. After that, it's a piece of cake. Why is that? Well, you could do anything. I mean, you could run for president. Make a virtual White House. Fly a plane into that. I mean, virtual cities and towns... nothing to nuke. - Yeah, but... where would we get... stuff? What stuff? I don't know. Food, clothes, blankets, fuel. Not a problem. After the Internet is back up, you just order all that stuff. You know, Stanley, you would not believe how helpful Sean has been around here with the livestock, and the house, and... just everything. It's true. Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause I am much more of a vibe guy. What the hell is a vibe guy? You know... I mean, I've never been into, like, physical labor. I'm more the guy that people have around for my vibe. My house, my rules, my vibe. And you sleep there. So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m., I've got this flashlight in my face. Gail's over on her side of the bed trying to find the phone to call the cops and finally, I located the light switch. It's Eric, who's standing there and he says, "I can't go to sleep until I confess I'm drunk. " I said, "You're what?" He said, "I'm drunk." "It won't ever happen again. I don't know what I was thinking." Well, meantime, he looks perfectly normal, his speech isn't slurred or anything. Gail starts grilling him. Turns out he has had a beer and a half. I said to him, "Son, do you have any idea how much beer it takes to get drunk?" He said, "No, I don't. " I said, "Well, get out of here and don't wake me up again until you do." He left, Gail and I just could not stop laughing. She doesn't laugh too much anymore. Here I am rambling on. We probably ought to go take a look at that still. Good idea. Hey, buddy. Your mom just ran to the little girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat? Could you give us a minute? Sure. Say, you know what? Why don't we go sit in my office, maybe we can talk. About what? About your artwork. This is Russell. He saved our butts out at the Black Jack. Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar. Stevens, right? Something we can help you with? Well, I was thinking we could help each other. You've got a salt mine with no real distributor. I've got men, trucks, guns, but no supplies. - If we become partners... - Partners? I'm asking for half your share of the mine. We're doing okay now. Okay, but the people in Jericho, they only need so much salt. I've been out there. I know the trade routes, where to find the highest bidders and how to make it back here in one piece. What's in it for us? Bigger profits. Where I'm going, I can get you five times what you can make here. And... I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you. When do you need an answer? Before I leave in the morning. Believe me, this is good for everyone. It's a full inventory of Jericho. It's our mine. And our town. They sliced it up like they own it. What do they know that we don't? Come on. Hey, sweetie. What's going on? We were talking about my drawings. Look, do you mind waiting in the lobby a minute? I just need to talk to Mr. Taylor alone. Okay? What are you doing? Darcy, something going on, and it's not just about the bombs. My son has enough to deal with, you know, without being poked and prodded. If there's a problem with him, I'll take care of it myself. Right. Thank you. For what? Letting Sean stay. You're welcome. And for not calling him an idiot even when he is done. Okay, if you know that... Sorry. Just a little frog in my throat. Don't let me interrupt your nice sibling-bonding moment. That's what it is, right? Sean can be an idiot, but he can also be really great. All guys are like that, you have to put up with the "idiot" stuff... to get to the "great" stuff. Yeah? And where did you come by that litlle pearl of wisdom? What did she say about me? When did he learn how to sign? He's sleeping with a deaf girl. That's my sister. I guess if Sean Henthorn is my biggest problem, then I'm a pretty lucky guy. Want to get luckier? What are you doing? It's binding. The lawyer said it makes me an emancipated minor. By declaring your parents dead? This is wrong in every way that something can be wrong. - Let's just forget about this. - You can't do that. - It's legal. - So, what, are you gonna pedal your little bike to Topeka and file this, Dale? Forget that I'm the mayor. Okay, I'm speaking to you as your parents' friend. My parents would want me to have my share of the salt mine Your parents are coming back. And if it turns out that that is not true, then I will help you learn the business. And who decides when that happens? You? I mean my decision, are you saying laws don't apply any more? You didn't make a decision. You signed a piece of paper. Do you really want your parents to be dead that badly? - Okay, stop it. - No. You're advising her, Dale. Did you also tell her how her parents died? Because New York survived, so I guess you probably had to get pretty creative, right? Were they killed there? Or were they murdered on their way back to the child who meant everything to them? It's just a piece of paper. Come on. They're making mortar rounds. They're running a munitions factory. Hurry up. Constantino wants those tonight. We'll have them ready. They're getting ready for war. We need to get back to town. No, we need to try and stop them. Cover me. Hey, there he goes. Down there. Hold it! Hand it over. Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner. Or lunch. Take your pick. I was helping Mary. It took longer than I expected. You told Eric we'd take care of her. What I meant was that we'd help keep her alive. What I didn't mean was that we'd run over there and spend the entire day every time she needed somebody to do a little heavy lifting. Wait. You don't think I'm the reason Eric left? Do you? Is that what you think? I think Eric left for a lot of reasons... ...but Mary may be why he comes back. I don't want to have to come back to this house again. Did you get all the toys you want? So, what did you and Mr. Taylor talk about today? Nothing. Now, Sam, you know we don't keep secrets in this family. Yeah, I know, baby. What's he doing here? I think we should talk. Hey, Sam, honey, why don't you go upstairs to your room and get that last box, okay? Hey, buddy. Look, I-I understand, you know, you being curious about my family. We haven't made a lot of friends here. We just kind of keep to ourselves, but if you want to ask any questions, just talk to me, okay? Leave my children out of it. But I think Sam's trying to say something with that drawing. Something he can't put into words. What do you mean? He's drawing a little boy that's afraid... ...because his dad's not around to protect him or his family. I told him he's not alone. I know what it's like to have parents who have split up. I told him I'd been through it, and... I think I turned out okay, so... I think you turned out better than okay, Jimmy. I appreciate that. So, I guess I'll head back to the house then. See you there. Thank you, Jimmy. Sure. - How did it go? - Good. Turbines all went up without a hitch. Thank... Thank you. You were as good as your word. Even better. I'm glad you see it that way, because I have another proposition for you. We need salt. Well, it's no problem. I'll have my guys load up your truck. Well, actually, I mean to help you sell it. We were thinking a quarter stake in the mine. Would we be Constantino? Is that what all of this good will was about? No. Hear me out. This will work for both of us. For both of our towns. If you agree to let me sell salt from the mine. I'm sorry. I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins think this is kind of cute. Well, for whatever it's worth, we did conduct a legal transaction. - Not for sale. - Your people on New Bern who think it should be. - I don't care what they think. You need to. When I saw that map of Jericho, I asked Heather about it. She didn't think New Bern could do that to us. Then she snuck in, and, uh... she saw the mortars and... their plans. Look, you're going back to whatever rock you crawled out from under. Dan, get in here! Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more going on here than you realize. - Is that so? - I'm trying to help you. Look, New Bern barely survived the winter. And the people there, they know the food is coming from you. And they also know that it's not going to be enough to feed everyone, and so, some of them, they're thinking, what can we do about that right now? I want you to find every deputy you can and get them up to the salt mine. I want it under heavy guard until further notice. Gray, I've already got men up there. Gray, listen to me. This deal is a good thing. I know you don't see it that way right now, but please, you do not want the alternative. These rumors about Jericho, about the food hoarding, about how they sicced Ravenwood on us... maybe they're not just rumors. We restored their power supply, and now that Jericho has what it needs, it has no intention of making good on its half of the deal. Why didn't you just leave town? 'Cause we wanted to break the machine, stop the factory. Then they caught us. They brought me here. So, where is she? Where is Heather? She's dead, Jake. But it's not enough for them to keep their food and leave us to starve. You, up. You, too. They want to see us destroyed. I looked their mayor in the eye, I told him how desperate our situation was. But on the day that we made good on our end of the deal, what did they do? They tried to destroy the factory that keeps this town alive. Here's your proof. These are the sons of Johnston Green, sent from Jericho to wreak havoc on this town. Now we know, if these people had their way, New Bern would cease to exist. With your help and sacrifice,
