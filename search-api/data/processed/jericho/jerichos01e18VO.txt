sold us all out. You’re smart enough to know that they would say anything to get you to talk. Get the package. In the last three months, I remembered all the reasons... why I needed you in my life. So have I. I've also remembered why it can never work. I told Darcy she and the kids can come stay with us. Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate that. We have also received reports that the bombers gained the trust of local officials which allowed the terrorists access to secure locations. I’ve heard that voice before. - That's the guy that does the farm report.  - It’s real news. In New York, the terrorists who were apprehended, were all carrying nearly perfect fake FBI badges. - You're drunk. - Yes, I am, Darcy. Yes, I am. What ? What is it, Rob ? Is all that really worth it for 6 kids ? Six kids in a conference room is not Harvard, but it's a start. I meant for you. I think it's time we start trying to get things back to normal. To be honest with you, if I'm a kid... going to school isn't exactly high on my list of priorities these days. Hey, Jimmy. Hey, can I... borrow you for a few minutes, I need your help. I'm going to get you a bat signal or something. What's wrong ? You remember, last week on the radio broadcast, they said that terrorists used fake FBI badges to move through security ? I've seen one of those badges. Where ? I never went to Law school, but I'm going to go ahead and guess. - This is breaking and entering. - It's called probable cause. It's called paranoïd abuse of authority. Come on, let's go... before he comes home and catches you... prying up his floorboards. The terrorists had FBI badges... Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge. You think that's just coïncidence ? Maybe he's FBI ! Please, tell me you thought of that. I did... and I asked his family. And they all say he's FBI. But... when they said it they all had this look on their face like... there was something that they weren't saying. Sort of like the look I've got on my face right now. Look, I had a hunch, and I was right. Now, he's out on patrol... he's not going to be back for a while, so... Come on ! Did you bust this lock open ? You know, this is kinda weird, but... if he's FBI, isn't this what his basement would look like ? That's... that's what I said... until I saw this. - Does Gray know about this ? - No. I wanted to get a second opinion before I told anyone. What do you want to do ? Don't. Who are you ? Season 1 - Episode 18 " A.K.A. " [ Transcript et Synchro ] aSpro5oo Special thanks to <i>SubsGuy [ www.seriessub.com ] Hand it over. Nice and slow. Slide it over. What the hell are you doing here ? Did you wipe out 23 American cities ? - Get out of my house. - Answer the question ! - Why would you even think that ? - You've got a working generator... and a food supply. So like you knew the attacks were coming. - I'm gonna give you 10 seconds... - Back up ! Jimmy knows I'm here. If I don't call him off when he gets back... you're gonna have a lot more people than me to deal with. I'm an FBI agent, Jake. That's what I heard. Problem is the radio was reporting the terrorists used forged FBI badges to get their bombs into position. What is that room ? How were you involved in all of this ? I need to know. 5 months ago, this was a map of our country. Now, it's an antique. It's a picture of the way things used to be. Right now... all we're sure of is this. But this is where we start to rebuild. So how do we do it ? How ? We look to our history. We study the people that came before us. - Are you going to take attendance ? - No. Where are you going ? My mom's at home right now... trying to grow beets out of our bathtub so we can eat newt month. This stuff... isn't important. I guess school's out early today. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I don't think I should be hanging around at home right now. So, I guess I'm stuck here. So it's come to this... I want you to know this has nothing to do with you personnally, I'm... sure you're... wonderfull. But let's be honest here, you're the one that lays the fewest eggs and I distinctly told all of you that this was going to happen. I believe I made myself perfectly clear in that regard. All right. The thing is... If you knew me at all, you would... see how really funny this is, because this is so not my thing. No... this is Stanley's thing. It's just... I'm awfully hungry. And... I don't want to get into the whole circle of life business, but... I just cannot eat anymore sprouts. OK ? Enough stalling... Here we go... Here's my concern... I've heard stories about how you're gonna react to this, and if I see half of you running around, well I just know I'm gonna freak out. So if you could do your best to minimize that part of it... I'd just really appreciate it. Sprouts it is. You really out here looking for deer? Thought they were all gone. What do you want Harry ? Do you think you could come into city hall today ? Gray’s still out, and it’d be nice to have... somebody around who knows what they're doing. Not my job anymore, and get lost, I'm trying to shoot some deer. Just be for a day or two. You're starting to look an awful lot like a deer, Harry. I've been in the FBI for 15 years. I worked law enforcement after college, and then I joined the bureau. Where did you go to school ? Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ? The FBI, what were you working on ? I was sent here to monitor the phone calls made in the area to a... suspected terrorist cell. - And what did you find out ? - Nothing. Trail went dead. We about done here ? Not even close. Tell me about her... Sarah Mason. She's gone. You're pretty thorough. Also took care of the one in the cabinet and the one behind the water heater. There's only one loaded gun in this house... and it's mine. Sit down. Arms behind you. Tell me about Sarah. Jimmy said she was also a cop in St Louis. She's working with you ? Against you ? Who are these people ? You are making a serious mistake. - I am a Federal Officer. - Really ? Really sure you're not. Robert Willer... State Department. How about Robert Snyder... Colombus PD ? Commander Robert Richmond... Naval Intelligence. None of those are real... and neither is that badge. Who the hell are you ? Who do you you work for ? You do not wanna know what I know. - I think I can handle it. - Really ? Cause I can barely handle it, and I was trained for this. You want to tell me... or you tell the whole town. All right. But once you hear this... You are a part of it, Jake, and there is no going back. Who do you work for ? CIA. Sarah Mason and I were part of an off-the-books team. We were tracking the bombs used in the attack. Where did they come from... the bombs ? The US government brought them in. See, after the Soviet Union fell... neglected military in the satellite republics started selling their nuclear stockpiles on the black market. So the CIA started an operation... get that material by any and all means necessary. But a few years ago, a shipment disappeared on its way to the DOE storage complex in Oak Ridge. And that is where my CIA team came in. Why you ? I'm the best at what I do. And what is that ? Satellite installation. I have a 2 o'clock appointment with Mr. Higgins. I've been inside all day. How's the weather out there ? You know, it looks like rain. Thank you. - Hello Victor. - Hawkins. I believe you know everyone here... except this young lady. - Robert Hawkins. - Sarah Mason. All right, let's get down to it. We have a lot of ground to cover. As most of you know... a shipment of nukes from project Red Bell is missing. What you don't know... is that we have quality intel that those warheads... have been converted into 25 small... high yield devices. These bombs have been dissiminated to extremists cells active within the United States. So, is this Al Qaeda ? I wish it were that simple. It's much larger than that. It's a cross section of domestic militias... anarchists, and religious fanatics. As you can see, these are terrorists... that would never collaborate, ideologically or politically. The only thing that links them, is the desire to take down the federal government. Our job, is to get undercover in these cells... and find these bombs. So who do we think is orchestrating this ? The agency's been at this from every angle... and all we know is that he's got deep ressources, an ability to coordinate diverse groups, and by all indications... he's an American. We were broken up into groups of two. Each unit was... assigned a terrorist cell. One agent went undercover, one acted as a handler. You can't expect me to believe you were sent here... undercover. What's so special about this place ? You know, I would show you, but... that's clever. It's over there... behind the map. Where did you get this ? Those are defense department projections they've been doing since the 50s. The fallout scenarios in the event of a nuclear attack on 20 US cities. And you see Jericho ? It's outside the fallout zones, Jake. It's got a salt mine, plenty of farm land, and access to an untainted water table. So you weren't here to monitor phone calls ? Jericho was a rally-point in case we failed in our mission. Failed ? Or succeeded ? And Johnston, was... He wanted to come, I know he did. He's just having a hard time dealing with things lately. He always gets quiet... when he's going through something, but... just wish I could think of something to help him get through this. We miss you, sweetheart. There's no more sprouts. You finished them ? I was hungry. What are you doing here, Sean. It's like 9:30 in the morning... Oh, my... You slept here ? Well, actually... there was not a lot of sleeping going on. Get out of the house ! What are you doing ? - You let him spend a night ? - Yes. Well that doesn't seem like something Stanley would approve of, does it ? Stanley's not here. Just like that. You infiltrated a terror cell planning a nuclear attack ? Yeah... just like that. It took me 2 years. 8 months of it in prison... developing contacts, getting into the network. The only outside person I communicated with was my handler. After prison, I spent another year trying to gain their trust on the outside. And even then, I was only scratching the surface. But you got in. How ? They were looking for high grade government IDs. You gave them their badges ! I had to proove that I was loyal and valuable to the cell, Jake. - I think I've heard enough. - No ! You barely scratched the surface. You're the one who wanted to hear this, so why don't you hear it all ? The cell was looking for IDs. And I needed to get higher up in their organisation. So I let it be known that I had a source. See, the badges... were going to be tagged so that my team could track them. They sent me to make the buy with another cell member. It was a kid named Daryl. How do we know these are real ? They're real enough. Where did you get them from ? How and where I got these badges... is my business. What you do with them... is yours. - Nice doing business with you. - You too. We should celebrate, man. Go out, get some girls. Except you don't really seem like the type. All serious. Are you married ? I was. Really ? What happened ? What the hell is going on ? Hold it right there ! I'm sorry man. You gotta be kidding me. FBI ! Hands in the air ! Back against the car. It turns out Daryl was an FBI informant. But my handler got me out, and we kept my cover intact. So the FBI have an informant in my target cell. And they can't tell us anything about that ? You know, I'm damn lucky that my cover wasn't blown. - Your cover's intact, yes ? - Yeah, we believe so. Then let's move on. Have you been able to make contact with those coordinating the attack ? No... but at this stage, I recommend that we take down the cells that we've already inflitrated. You know, at the very least that would disrupt the overall plan... maybe delay it for... - How many of the bombs can you get ? A third, for sure... half if we're lucky. Look... I know... it's not ideal, but at this stage, it is the safest move. That's still a dozen bombs in play. - What are you doing ? - I just think there's a way to... speed this up and get all the bombs at once. - Yeah, and we agreed that... - Do you mind ? I think there may be a way to get us further inside. My partner tells the cell leader that Daryl is the FBI informant. That gives him the credibility that he needs to move up faster. Then let us handle the FBI... and do whatever is necessary to save the operation. - It's all gonna take some time, but we're close  - OK. We're counting on you, and you know the risks. You'd better be right about this. This is the right way to go. Trust me. What would you have done ? Stayed in, or pulled the plug ? It seems like the wrong question to me. I'd ask myself how much I trusted my partner. Well, if I can sneak up here without you so much as turning around... how are you gonna hear any game ? I heard you half a mile back in those shoes. You said you'd come with me to see April today. Fine. You coming home for dinner ? There are no deer in these woods, they've all been picked clean. Then, I guess I'll be here a while. I never wanted to be a mom'. I didn't sign up for this. You know what, you're right. I owe it to Stanley. So I'm just gonna have to jump in... with both feet, whether she wants to hear from me or not. Listen to me going on about my own problems. You must be ady to take this hatchet and do the damn job yourself. I didn't know that he knew how to sign. What did he say to you ? Never mind, look... That boy's bad news. Now, I can't stop you from seeing him... but he is no longer welcome in this house, do you understand me ? Allison... so why do you feel like you can't hang out at home ? You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to. It's not that I don't wanna talk about it. It's just... my family's pretty weird. My family was pretty weird too. In fact, when I was your age, I didn't want to hang out with them either. What about now ? They're gone. There's this thing that went down at my house... a couple weeks ago. I did something. OK. What did you do ? I did something that... can't be forgiven. Now my mom just keeps... looking at me. Like I've changed into some kind of monster, or something. You know you haven't, right ? So... even though you weren't sure about the plan, you outed the informant to the cell leader. Once we decided to leave the bombs in play, it was the only way for me to get deep enough into the cell and gain their trust. I told the cell leader that Daryl was the informant, but I wanted to get him out of there before they killed him. Come on, grab what you need and let's go. They're gonna hunt me down, and they're gonna kill me. It's your lucky day, Daryl. They're gonna get you into witness protection, so don't worry. We're gonna get you out of here. Stay there. - Damn it ! - What is it ? Daryl, we just wanna talk. The cell leader. You gotta get me out of this place. Run ! I'll tell them that you got away. I think my leg is broken. Please, help me ! Or I'm gonna tell them who you really are. I'm sorry. So, I finally gain their trust. I was in. You killed him. It was either killed him... or possibly let millions of people die. They died anyway. Jake ? You're still down there ? Call him off. You're not helping your cause by keeping that gun in my face. Hey, Jake ? Do not make me kill him Jake. All right. - All right ! - Jake ? What's going on, Jake ? We need a little more time, that's all. - You're sure ? - Yeah, we're all right. - I... I'm out front. - OK. Turn around, Jake. It is not about this anymore. We're past this. Starting now, we trust each other. You need to tell me everything. Done telling. Now, I gotta show you. What are you doing here ? It's your first day at a new school. You know, the last time you had one of those, Sam was in diapers. Doesn'’t look like you had a big turnout. No, most people left early. I guess you knew better. I figured you didn't really want me around the house anyway. Why would you say that ? You know... because of what I did. Allison, I love you. OK ? Nothing will change that. Hear me baby ? Nothing will change that. My little girl. Mom, please don't be mad at me. I'm so sorry, mom'. - Here's the part I don't get. - What ? If you're telling the truth... you made it. You made it deep inside the cell, you gained their trust. Right. Then, what happened ? Somebody tipped off the terrorists, Jake. Before we could find out who... the terrorists moved up their plan. Victor ? We made a mistake, a very big mistake. This is the moment we prepared for. Strike will go off tomorrow, at precisely 8:05 Eastern. OK. No... listen ! The trucks... they're white. License plate Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida... I tried to warn the agency... but we were too late. Some of the bombs were meant for New York. We managed to head them off. Even after 4 years of work... I couldn't stop all of them. I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. Since when have you been funny ? I have always been funny. Yeah, not for a long time. What is it Rob ? - Rob ? - I won't be long. Not interrupting, am I ? You know you are. You're not exactly returning our calls. I told my wife I was done. I promised her, Victor. - We need you back. - Why me ? Because you're the best at what you do. Which is what ? Your family will be there, when you get back. Team is meeting tomorrow. Come listen to what this is all about. If you wanna walk away after that... you walk away. 2 o'clock... tomorrow. Tell the desk jockey you have an appointment with Mr. Higgins. If they ask about the weather... tell hem it's gonna rain. Who was that ? I might need to go to a meeting tomorow. I can't keep doing this, I can't. We'll be fine, D. What is that ? It's the end of the rabbit hole, Jake. Gimme a hand with this. So you believe me now ? Is that what I think it is ? It was meant for Columbus, Ohio. You brought a nuclear bomb... here. What would you have done with it ? What do you gonna do with it ? I'm gonna keep it safe. I'm gonna keep it secret, you know. Because... it gives the town some power, Jake, but it also makes them a target. Look... I know what you're thinking... You're wishing you'd walked away when I gave you the chance, right ? Why didn’t you show me thing when I walked in the door today. You didn't walk in. Jake ? Hey, Jake ? I've been watching you, Jake... and you can handle yourself. And I've seen what a help you have been to this stown. But I needed to know that I can trust you. That you could handle it if I told you everything. Jake ? This bomb... it's our burden, now. Whatever happens next... that is gonna be up to you. OK ? He's FBI. Just like he said. But... We're in good hands. That's good to hear. I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Hawkins. We do that, outside. I didn't know that. There’s something I want to say to you. I'm still learning... so just, please bear with me. Stanley... is... important... to me. You... are... important... to me. I... want... you... to be safe. So please... be patient... with me. I'm trying... I'll try too. So... hug ? Right. I brought you some dinner. Thank you. You know what, I am damn lucky that my cover wasn’t blown. - Your cover's intact ? - Yeah, we believe so. Then let's move on. But at this stage, I recommend that we take down the cells that we've already infiltrated... How many of the bombs can you get ?
