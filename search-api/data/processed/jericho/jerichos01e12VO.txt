with custom security and design features you won't find in any other fleet. I see that you're an Embry-Riddle grad. ATP-certified, 1,600 verified FAA hours. Clearly well qualified, Mr. Green. Flying's in my blood. I started working on my Grandpa's crop duster when I was 10. Now you understand that we charter exclusively to top executives and celebrity clients, so absolute discretion is a must for our flight crew. Hey, anything past getting the plane safely from "A to "B" is none of my business. Good, of course, finding out everything we can about the people who are piloting our planes is our business. And according to your visa records, you spent a little time in the Middle East over the last few years. 14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq. But you were never military? I worked for an independent contractor. Left that off the resum. I didn't think it was relevant. State Department has you flagged as a person of interest. I'm an interesting guy. There was an incident. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Which contractor were you working with when this incident occurred? One of the big ones. - Halliburton, Blackwater? - You said discretion was a must. Look, I'm going to be straight with you. I think there's room in our operation for someone like you, but there is no way that I can hire you if you are unable to clear this up. Do you understand that? Thank you for your time. The president is scheduled to address the nation tomorrow</i> amid growing disapproval. Recent polls show his rating plunging double digits</i> into the 20s, even amongst partisan voters.</i> With midterm elections on the horizon,</i> this is not a good sign for the administration.</i> I've already been summoned, Sarah. They want me in position. This is good news. We talking locally or back to the farmland? I'm waiting to hear. Congratulations. It was your idea. I have to say that... when they recruited me, I thought I was prepared for just about anything. But nothing like this. Well, that's because nothing like this... has ever happened before. This is it. Yes. This is the moment we've prepared for. All the devices have been secured. The other cells are receiving their instructions as we speak. The target cities have been confirmed. Your routes have been scouted and cleared. We're ready. The strike will go off tomorrow at precisely 8:05 Eastern. Take a look around you, gentlemen. These are the faces of the men who will change the world. Season 1 Episode 12 "The Day Before" Transcript: swsub.com Synchro: Loky [ www.seriessub.com ] - Hey, Dad, you got a second? - Nope. USA Today's having a contest to find the top five towns under 5,000. I was thinking we should submit Jericho. Why, so some big developer can come in and start buying the town up, maybe turn Main Street into a strip mall with a half a dozen coffee shops or so? Dad, there are worse things in the world - than vente frappuccinos. - Speak English. This could be a good thing. The kind of headlines that will bring out voters next month. Son, I am not worried about beating Gray Anderson. The people of this town have kept me in office for over 20 years. I will earn their votes by doing the job they hired me to do. What are you guys doing here? Your father missed his checkup this morning and April was nice enough to take off her lunch hour to make a house call. Well, sorry, Doc, but we're gonna have to reschedule - for sometime after the election. - Johnston. You're gonna do this whether you like it or not. I've had this terrible cold and you've not been feeling well for almost a week. It's a bad one. Half my staff has come down with it. Do you want to strip here or would you like to go somewhere a little less public? My office. That's my guy. Yo, yo, how'd it go? Well, Freddy... so much for your lucky tie. "Driver wanted. Military experience. Plus, travel opportunities." Something tells me they're not talking about the Bahamas. I need a job. You're no driver, man. You're a pilot, a freakin' good one. Right now, all I am is broke. Unless you want to pay my rent for me. Sorry?! Tell you what I can do, though. Set you up with a drink. Oye! Mira! Hit us up with a couple of cervezas. What's up with you and the manners? I know you didn't just whistle for me like some dog. - Oh, baby... - Don't you "baby" me, baby. You're the worst tipper in here. What, that ring on your finger, that don't count? Finally pulled the trigger, Freddy? - All right. - You know it, baby. Hey, she's got some good-looking sisters. Unless you're still all hung up on that farm girl back in Iowa. - Kansas. - Same thing. No, not the same thing. Yeah. Hold on a second. Don't go anywhere, all right? Where am I gonna go? Sarah, the schedule's changed. It's happening tomorrow during the President's address. I'll be there as soon as I can, but there's something I need to take care of. You get everything together and I'll meet you back as soon as I can. Where are you going? To get my kids. Robert, there isn't enough time. Robert! Anna. - Congratulations. - Thank you. He's a good man. I don't know how good he his, but... he promised to take care of me. - Call me crazy, I believe him. - What's this? My best man hitting on my fiance? Best man? You gonna make me ask? You're more a brother to me than the one I grew up with. Back at ya. I'm happy to do it. Got some more good news, too. Uh, sweetie, will you... will you give us a moment to talk? What if I told you I got a gig lined up? Eight weeks, a hundred G's, all cash. What kind of gig? The kind we're good at. Cargo run. Quick in, quick out. $30,000 up front, $70,000 when it's done. Where? Afghanistan. - No. - Come on. You've been looking for work for what, six months? We do this one gig and we are set. You could open that flight school. Maybe go home, snag back that girl. Why are you doing this to me? I can't believe you'd even ask after what we saw over there, what we did. All we did was not get killed, J. Innocent people died, Freddy. Innocent people. I see it every time I close my eyes. Which isn't too damn often these days. Well, we'll be smarter this time, man. You know that I got your back, man. I'm sorry. You're on your own this time. I can't go back there. I'll tell you what, Jerry, you agree to sit down face to face, I'll flip you a pair of open day boxes at Wrigley. No strings. I swear on a stack of cheddar dogs. Great. 6:00 at The Pump Room. See you there. Chicago again? Hey, teach, half day? Feel like helping me prepare a syllabus or... grading 30 essays on Orwell's Animal Farm? No, I have a better idea. Have a sub do that and come to Chicago with me tonight. That would send a great message to my students. I'll write a letter for you. "Dear kids, sorry I can't teach you ungrateful brats today. "I'm with my fiance getting drunk on draft beer and having tons of Chicago-style sex." I think it's Chicago-style pizza. That, too. One night. Your students will catch up. Book it. Seriously? You're not going to try to talk me out of it now, are you? No. I'm done talking. 46 tackles, three sacks and a couple of interceptions... You all right? I'm worried about Freddy. You want a beer? No. I think he's in over his head with something. What are you talking about? These guys started coming around. Like... soldiers but not. They, they came by again after you left. Well, he's a big boy. He can hang out with whoever he chooses. It's not like that. When he came back, Freddy had a black eye, saying he's going away for two months and not to try to find him. Tell him you don't want him to go. You don't think I did that? He says he doesn't have a choice, that he's doing it for me. What do you want me to do? Help him. Go with him if you have to. I know what he did for you in Iraq. I know you owe him your life. Yeah. That doesn't appear to be worth very much, right now. I'm pregnant, Jake. I just... I have a bad feeling about all this. - Robert, what... - Don't make a scene. What are you doing here? You need to come with me. Look, don't tell me what to do. You are not allowed within 500 feet of this family. Circumstances have changed, Darcy. Mom! Mom. Oh, my God. The kids. Unlock the door from the inside. Alison, it's, it's okay. It's okay. You let them out of there right now, or so help me, I'll start screaming. No, you listen to me very carefully. In five seconds, I'm getting on this truck and I am leaving Washington for good. And I did not come here to discuss this with you. Now you can either trust me, and come with us or you can stay here. But you will never ever see your children again. Hey, buddy, you in? I'm in. Glad you changed your mind. I'm telling you, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Then how come this isn't the first time I've heard you say that? Do me a favor. Skip ahead in your mind a couple of months. Visualize yourself on a... Mexican beach, knee deep in bikinis and Benjamins. I try not to think that far ahead. Keeps me from being disappointed when things go to hell. My pop once told me if you don't keep an eye towards where you're going, you'll never get there. Speaking of eyes... You should see the other guy. Fine, introduce us. Who's the job for, Freddy? Don't matter who. They know you, and your reputation. I'm not going anywhere until I know. It's an offshoot of Ravenwood. You'll meet 'em, tomorrow right before we get on a plane. In the meantime, all you gotta worry about... is this. There's three times that waiting for you when this is over. All we gotta do is run a convoy through enemy territory without getting killed. How many times I gotta get your back before you start believing it, huh? Seat's all yours. Thank you. Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when I got money on a game. Swung on, it's a high blast out toward left field.</i> It's way back, and it is gone! Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks. Pay up! Better yet, better yet. Buy my, uh, good luck charm here, a drink on me. Don't waste your money, I have an expense account. What is your best wine? Beer. Vodka, rocks. Did you know that it is a three-hour cab ride from the airport to this godforsaken town? Scenic, though, ain't it? If you like corn. Well, now, who doesn't like corn? I mean, you got corn on the cob, cornflakes, corn nuts, corn dogs, cornsicles. Cornsicles? It's a joke, lady. Can you not talk to me, please? Thank you. - Corn, corn chips? - Seriously. Don't talk to me. Bailey's. Hey, there. Hi. Am I going to see you this week? Well, you can see me right now. Just turn around. What are you doing here? You have no idea how badly I want to kiss you right now.</i> Well. Why don't you step into my office?</i> What in the... heck do we have here? It's time for some changes, Johnston. Starting with your diet. A man can't live on that. Can if he wants to stay married to me. Your blood pressure was ten points over your last checkup. Well, that's just the stress. It's always up at election time. Then drop out of the race. What has gotten into you? Something happened watching April listen to your heartbeat. I began to wonder. How many good years do we have left together? Did you hear something I didn't? 'Cause all she told me was I might be getting a cold. This isn't, this isn't just about health, yours or mine. When you first took office you made two oaths. One to the people of this town, and the other one to me. Do you rember what you said? Yeah. That I would never let the job come before you and the kids. I'm just asking for equal time. I hear you, honey. You all stay put. Mom, do something. Robert, let us go. Please, I'm begging you. I'll be back in five minutes. - And then what? - And then... we leave town. Oh, you're crazy, I'm not going anywhere with you. Dad, stop. Dad! Let go of her, Robert! Listen to me, okay. I would never do anything to hurt you, your mother, or your brother. You believe me? Do you believe me? I barely know you. Listen, Robert, you are scaring Samuel. Unscare him, Darcy. Do you have your cell phone? No, he took it when he picked me up. Not mine. Really? Where is it, honey? In my backpack. 911. What is your emergency? The door was unlocked. I love what you've done with the place. What do you want, Agent Hicks? Guess whose name just popped up on an international passenger manifest? You got me on a no-fly list now? No, not yet, but... I thought maybe... we could work out a deal. You're about to get into bed with some very bad people, Jake. Lucky for you, your timing is perfect. We're looking to nail Ravenwood. They did that? They've been running weapons since the start of the war. They'll sell arms to anybody, even our enemies. We need someone working for us that they'll consider credible. And why would I say yes to you? Because... ...you know firsthand what they're capable of. Sarah, come on, we don't have... Sarah? Hold it right there. Drop the case. Walk towards me slowly. Put your hands in the air... now! This your truck? It's a rental. Moving day, you know? What seems to be the problem? Open the back. Okay. What the hell? Cuff him. Hands behind your back. Help! Help! Unlock the door. - Please. - It's okay. We're gonna get you out of here. - Can you open this door? - We can't. Can you unlock the door. Watch out! Hey, Dad. - Hey, Eric. - Mary. Oh, darlin', would you get him a beer, too? Sure thing. Thanks. So, um... Why did I ask you here? Yeah. Is everything okay? Uh, your mother and I have been... talking about the next chapter in our lives. Be more accurate, she's... pointing out how I seem to be unwilling to turn the page. Sounds like Mom. When I first took office, you were in... what? Third grade? Second. My team won the pee-wee football trophy that year. I scored two touchdowns in the championship game. Hard to remember back that far. Maybe because you didn't make the game, Dad. Right. Well, your mother is afraid that if I keep going the way I'm going, we're gonna wind up missing more than pee-wee football. And I've been thinking about it, and I want to ask you a question. If I decided to drop out of the race, would you consider running in my place? What? You'd make a good candidate, son. You've been here your whole life, you live clean, unlike your brother Jake. Plus, selfishly, I'd get to... step down and still have some influence over how things were run. Oh, y-you're serious? Well, you... You're smart, you're decisive. Even got yourself a law degree. Which I plan on using some day. Plan on doing a lot of things some day. Nothing you've been sharing with me. Let me know if you need anything else. So, you take the night and think about it. Talk to April about it. It's gonna effect her, too. Yeah. Hey. - What's up? - We need to talk. What's up? Cargo, we're transporting for Ravenwood, you have any idea what it is? I don't ask those kind of questions, man. Stinger Missiles. RPGs. It's not like this was ever some kind of humanitarian mission. They've been selling them to the insurgents, Freddie They'll be used to kill our own guys! The Feds are on to the whole thing. They want us to help take down Ravenwood. Whoa. Are you crazy? We don't have a choice. They're watching us. So is Ravenwood, man. I'm more worried about them than the government. If we don't work with the Feds, they'll make sure Ravenwood believes you are. - You got your money with you? - What? - Your money. - Yeah, I can get it. Get Anna, grab whatever you can, we'll meet in an hour. - Then what? - We'll take off tonight. If they come after us, at least we'll have a head start. All right? Nobody from school better see us. Gonna make it pretty hard for me to get on that plane tonight and call in sick tomorrow. You know, if this was Chicago, you could walk for miles without ever running into anyone you know. Really? Chicago again? Plus, there's the pizza, the Cubs, the culture... What are you getting at, huh? Okay, I have a confession. The meeting tomorrow isn't just a meeting. It's an interview for a startup venture capital firm. Final interview, actually. Are you serious? Well, I thought maybe you could get to know the city a little. You might fall in love with it. You're a jerk. Emily, we have to at least talk about it. We have talked about this. This is not the kind of opportunity you can just say no to. Really? No. There. How hard is that? I cannot believe you. We're supposed to be married in a few months. Why do you think I'm doing this? Because you're selfish, and you don't listen. I told you when you proposed to me I didn't want to move. Now you go behind my back like this? Yeah, well, screw me for thinking you might be open to changing your mind. I mean, what is it about this town that's got you so... addicted to it? This town is my history. It is everything that I know and love. It's where I want my kids to grow up. If you don't understand that, then maybe... Maybe what? I'm not getting on that plane with you tonight. If you decide to take that job tomorrow, then don't bother coming back. I'm tired. Allison, there are two bedrooms upstairs. Take your brother up to the one on the right. That's where you'll sleep. Who's stuff is all this? Who lives here? We do. Go on upstairs. I'll be there in a minute. Come on, Sammy. I'll read to you. I don't know what's going on, Robert, and right now, I'm... I'm too exhausted to fight, but I promise you one thing. Come tomorrow, one way or another, I will have you arrested. But you know, come tomorrow, a whole lot of things will be different. Freddie, come here. - All right. What happened?! - Ravenwood. Those sons a bitches shot me! Oh, God! Take it easy, take it easy. Find Anna. Make sure she's all right. First, we got to get you to the hospital. All I care about is Anna and my kid. Get them on that bus. Then you get the hell out of here, too! They're gonna come after you. Oh, they're coming after you. Try to stay with me. 911. What is your emergency? I need an ambulance right away. My friend's been shot, he's lost a lot of blood. Is he breathing? Stay with me, Freddie! Sir, is he breathing? Stay with me, man. Come on, man, stay with me. You're all right. You're all right. Stay with me. I can't believe he's gone. I'm really sorry. It's not your fault. You did... You did everything that you could. I don't want it. I don't want it. It belonged to Freddie. Use it for the baby. My family will help me. You keep it. No. I promised him. Just put it away. Platform for Houston. Platform six.</i> You better go. Come with me. Come on, you can start over, too. No, I can't. Not yet. Then where will you go? You were up early. Oh, I've been coughing all night. I didn't want to wake you. Paris. I hate France. I'm sure they'd be devastated to hear it. Studied French and Italian for four years. After all those years, all I can remember is my name, how to count to ten and, "Would you please pass that packet of sugar?" Book the trip. I don't think they take reservations six years in advance. I was thinking more like Christmas. What the hell. Book one for Italy, too. Hello. Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? Jake. One new message. Hey, Emily, it's Roger. Just tried your cell, but I couldn't reach you. Hopefully, you haven't run off with the milkman yet. Last night was terrible. I kept wanting to... get up and tell the captain I'd made a horrible mistake, and to turn the plane around. My home is where you are, babe. And if that means Jericho, Kansas for the rest of my life, it'll be a happy one. I'm flying back tonight. I get into Wichita at 10:30. I can't think of anything I'd rather see than your beautiful face when I get home. And in case you're wondering, I... I didn't go on that interview. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, it's you. Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell. Look, I have been standing out here forever waiting for a cab. Yeah, I suggest you nicely ask someone for a ride. Do you know where the Richmond Farm is? Well, yeah, I ought to. I'm Stanley Richmond. - You got to be kidding. - No. You see, now is the part where you tell me your name. Mimi Clark. Really? Well, it's... nice to meet you, Ms. Clark. Do you not read your mail? Nope. Nothing but bills and bad news. Why? Well, this would be a little of both. I work for the IRS. And according to our records, you owe more than $180,000 in back taxes. It's nice to meet you. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.</i> We all know that these divisions pale in comparison</i> to the fundamental dangers posed by the thrt of terrorism.</i> We have an eternal commitment to leave the world</i> a better place for our children and grandchildren.</i> This has always been our promise. Not another step. Where are my kids? Give me the keys. Darcy, put that gun down, 'cause you don't even know how to use it. I don't want to shoot you, Robert, but so help me, I'm prepared to! Now, give me the keys! Mom! Mom, come quick! Baby, stay outside! Mom! Mom! Something's happening!</i> Woody, what are you looking at? Jake! Jake, we got to go outside! Now! Help them. Help them.</i> Bring them inside. Some of them were on planes. Landed in the middle of nowhere. Been walking for weeks. They must have gone through hell. Can you give me a hand with this?</i> Oh, my God. Roger. Is it really you? I thought you were dead. Come on. Come with me. We only have another half hour before the generators shut down. Well, I'm sure they'll make an exception. Do we have any extra blankets? I already brought everything down I could find. Listen, Eric, these people need medical attention. You have to find a doctor. I'm okay. Are there any more people out there? We could send a search party. 21 men and 32 women. I'll do a head count. What happened to you out there? We waited in that field for two days after our plane went down. No one came. Eventually, I... went for help. I walked for... I don't how long. Wound up in this... refugee camp. Nebraska. Most of us are from there. I can't imagine what you've seen out there. Roger? I said, I can't imagine what you've seen. Couldn't have imagined it either. Hey, wash up. Dinner's almost ready. Robert? Darcy, I need you to keep the kids in the house for a while until I can sort something out. What does that mean? It means you stay inside, and you don't answer the door. Here. We're playing football. Man, Sam, that is really cool. Daddy's gonna put that on the fridge. Sam, I want you to go upstairs, tell your sister dinner's ready. Okay? Right now. Allison! Are we in danger, Robert? I've asked you that question a thousand times, you've always said no. I don't... mean to scare you, D. All right, we'll do whatever you say. I trust you. My God. Where did they all come from? I'm gonna need warm water, as much as you can make. I've made a list of the injured. How's he doing? I think he might be in shock. He doesn't want to be treated until everybody else has been seen. - Jake, I, um... - Go. He's gonna need you. You have moderate frostbite on your toes and fingers.</i> You need to keep them clean and warm.</i> Do you have a place to stay? Do you know anyone
