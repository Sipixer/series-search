If it was an attack, and there is chaos out there, you might not want the wrong people knowing that Jericho is still here. Oh, my God, we got something. - Was that Korean? - I think it was Chinese. - Mandarin. Question is: Were they just reporting it or are they behind it? The last time I saw you, you were going to tell your wife about us and we were going to start our life together. I wake up in the morning and I want it to be you there so badly. It hasn't been a particularly good morning, if you know what I mean? Of course, it could be the nerves as much as the pregnancy. You didn't tell Eric about the baby? Everyone that I ever cared about was incinerated four weeks ago. And you're gonna tell me that you know how I feel? - I'm trying to be nice to you. - Well stop being nice to me! Hello, Jonah. The guy did four years at Lansing for extortion and assault, and you want to negotiate with that guy? I've seen what happens when people lose their hold on law and order-- you start striking bargains with the bad guys, it's the beginning of the end. Why are you talking to him? It's okay, all right? It didn't have anything to do with you. He's my father-- it has everything to do with me. We need a security force. A real one, trained. Sanctioned, by you. Make sure you do it right. Darn it! I really thought I had that one. Well, we'll get 'em next time. Let's get back on patrol. - He's trying hard. They all are. - Trying? This isn't a drill. If he can't hit a turkey with a shotgun, what happens when his target shoots back? - They really invited you on a turkey shoot? - Mmmm. - What'd you say? - I declined politely. I don't care if it is Thanksgiving. Be nice to have a real turkey. - Well, you know, if I shot it, you would have to clean it. - Yeah, good point. Hey, what about you guys? You gonna be crushed not to have a turkey this year? I'm a vegetarian. Right. - Well, we'll have plenty for you. - There's not "plenty" of anything. We'll make do. - I'm just glad you're gonna be here. - Hey, me, too. How come you missed all the other Thanksgivings? - Was business trips. - On Thanksgiving? Well, you know... it wasn't a big holiday where Daddy was working. Those days are over, son, okay? Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. Oh, you sure you want to donate all at? A lot of folks need it more than I do. Some of my students are so skinny I barely recognize them. - Where'd you find it? - The garage. Roger was such a planner, you'd think we already had five kids. - You want to have five kids? - He wanted five kids. I said I was good for two, and after that he was on his own. Emily, I don't quite know what I'm serving for Thanksgiving this year but always know that you're welcome at our table, honey. Thanks, I usually go to my aunt's. - Do you guys still have that football game before dinner? - Of course. There are some things the apocalypse can't change. - How's your throwing arm? - Still better than Jake's. - Oh, Gray's finally getting that election, huh? - Yeah, next week. Is the mayor nervous? Not as nervous as he should be. - How long do think it'll take us to train our guys? - Oh, weeks at best. Look at us-- for every cop and veteran, we've got an accountant or travel agent, or a farmer. Watch it, buddy. Think Ravenwood will be back? When they run out of towns, yeah. Questions is, how long... Must have scared them off. Whoa. What the...? Those are the first planes I've seen since the bombs. But not the last. - What is that? - It sounds like bombers. Darcy, come on. Everybody. I want everybody into the basement until they pass. - And, hey. Listen, I have got to... - Okay, go. Go. What the hell's going on? What are they dropping? God only knows. You think it's a bomb? Why would someone put a parachute on a bomb? Good point. Whoa, whoa. - You think that's safe? - You want to do it? Okay, I'll shut up. What is that? I'd tell you if I knew Chinese. Whoa, folks, hold up. Let's just wait until we know what we got here. It's all from China. - Are we being invaded? - I doubt it. If they wanted to invade, they'd have sent troops. - So this is charity. - We're getting aid from China? Why isn't our own government helping us? - The United Nations or the Red Cross? - Mayor... Oh, hey, guys. How many chutes did you say were out there? Well, I counted 12. Well, let's get everybody with a working vehicle out there and round this stuff up. - Bring them where? - Well, for now, here. - And somebody find Eric for me. - All right. - Okay. So... we're down to a few cases of liquor and three cases of near beer. And 13 bottles of mustard. What about booze from the still? Well, the last batch tasted like paint thinner and may cause blindness but everybody drank it, so... I guess if they're not all dead, then we can stay open. Look, we'll figure it out. Everything's gonna be fine. That makes no sense at all. And yet I totally, completely believe you. What else do we need? We got each other and mustard. - Mayor's looking for you. - What's up? - Didn't you hear? - No, I was in the back. - Oh, right. - Doing inventory. - What is it, Jimmy? - Uh, planes. - There are parachutes from China all over town. - I'm right behind you. I got to get back. Bonnie and Mimi must be freaking out. All right, give him a hand. - Hawkins. - Hey. What does it say? - Your guess is as good as mine. - I doubt that. Only one of us speaks Chinese. What are you talking about, Jake? The broadcast, when it came over the satellite, you knew it was Mandarin. Hey, you know, you can know when somebody's talking German but that doesn't mean you can speak German, right? That's not what I meant at all. - What I'm saying is... - Jake! - You get a good look at those planes? - Yeah. The jets were mig 19s. - he bombers, they looked like Antonovs. - You know your planes. My grandfather made sure of that. - So they were Russian? - Yeah, except the Russians stopped making them in the '70s. - Since when do we let foreign jets fly through our airspace? - Happened only once. Italy patrolled the border after 9-11. - But that was it. - And Italy is an ally. Russia? China? I imagine the last contact we had with them were those missiles we saw flying a few weeks back. We can't give out this food. - What are you talking about? - The people are hungry, Jake. - I don't care. - We can't have this conversation here. - Inside. - Jake, the people need that food. - We all could use the food. How do we know it's safe? - Well, if the Chinese are trying to hurt us, they sure picked a funny way to do it. - What if, what if this is the second wave of the attacks? They wait until we're hungry, and then they poison our food supply. - Who would do that? - A smart enemy. If they were to invade, we'd have no one healthy enough to fight them. It's like the British did to the Indians. - Gave them blankets for the winter, but didn't mention they were infected with smallpox. - I don't even want to think about this. Do you really think the Chinese are trying to poison us? I don't know, but whoever it was, they had no problem blowing us up. Check with April-- maybe there's a way we can test the food. Well, what if there isn't? In the meantime, we tell everybody who's handling this stuff to put gloves on first and we don't hand out to anybody until we're sure it's safe. We may not have that choice. Folks, let's calm down. Hey! Hey! Back it up right now! - Everybody, drop what you have and take a step back! - Bill! Put that damn gun away now! Get this area cordoned off! Don't do this, people. This is Jericho. This is not some third-world village. We got no power, no phones, no gas. We may not be the third world, but we're getting there. We need food now. - Folks, we don't know what is safe and what is not safe. - The only people I've seen trying to hurt us have been out on that road and they look a lot like you and me. This looks like help, and I say we take it. - Are you okay? - I am great! Come on. - So you know we're not being attacked? - Yeah, of course. I do talk to the neighbors, you know. Why are you so happy? Because we have chocolate. That stuff wasn't half bad, and I'm still alive. The only thing that proved is that you're clinically stupid. - When are you going to hand out that food, Johnston? - We are not having that debate here. What, should we have it in your office again? Maybe this time I sucker punch you. Listen, if you're still breathing this time tomorrow, maybe we'll distribute this stuff. In the meantime, do the town a favor and forget you want my job for one second. - Seemed to be in every box. - Yeah. Could this mean we're gonna be conquered? - It doesn't say that. - "Do not fight"? It could be the price we pay for free food. - That's it. - All I know is that between the stunt Gray's pulling and these flyers, we could have a problem keeping order. Is this all of the pallets? Almost. They're numbered one through 12. One through five is food and this dried fish stuff. Six and eight: we got medical supplies, water. Ten, 11, 12: grain, blankets, and fuel. That leaves seven and nine. They're still missing, but we got people looking for them. - We need to get this stuff off the street before there's nothing left to protect. - Yeah, you're right. My customers need that. You are taking everything. With those air drops, there's no telling what's out there to trade. We got to be ready. Well, what about me? We had a deal, Jonah. You'd bring me things, and I give you a cut. Now you just take. Mitchell Cafferty, that is not yours. Whoa, whoa, easy, big fella. Take it easy. Gracie... Mitchell and the other guys don't see our arrangement the way I do. If it were up to them, they'd just come in here and snap your neck. But I don't want to see that happen. Let's go. Long time, no see, Johnston. It was supposed to be longer. Gracie, we got all this food out here. We sure could use a place to distribute it. Only thing is, you'd have to stop doing business with Jonah. We have a deal. Had a deal... the one you broke. I'm in. That stays. And this. Come on. Come on. It's good to have you back, Mayor Green. Well, those prices you've been charging, those are going to have to stop. Hey, look, we just need a place to store the food. - Well, how am I going to make...? - Hey, if you don't like it, there's always Jonah. I like it. Well, in that case, it's good to have you back, too, Gracie. Look. Isn't it great? Hey, hey, hey, you don't know if that's okay. - Well, it's not Teuscher, but in a pinch... - I mean, you don't know if it's safe. Well, if the chocolate didn't impress you, maybe this will. - It's a generator. - So we can get power back and communications. - Listen, take my truck and go tell Jake. - But do we have to give up all the food? It's not our food; it's the town's food. You mean, the town that was going to blow that bridge and leave us for dead? That town? A: They didn't blow up the bridge, and B: you were on the other side of it at the time. Take the truck and go tell Jake. We're not sharing the chocolate. - And we can fit all the food into Gracie's store. - Good, good. Regarding the medical supplies, would you guys mind, um...? I'll go to the clinic and give them to April. Thank you. So, are we going to see you for Thanksgiving? I think Mary and I are going to spend it together. Well, you're always welcome. Football starts at 3:00. Thanks, but I don't want to put you guys in an awkward position. You could have thought of that before you moved in with your mistress and left your wife with us. - I'd better get back to Main Street. - Thanks, son. Yeah, now it feels like the holidays. - Why do you keep acting like it's no big deal? - I don't. - I'm also trying not to act like a hypocrite. - Oh... - This is nothing like what we went through. - Oh, no? I seem to recall when my mother thought your name was "the other woman." And I ignored her just the way Eric's ignoring us. Now, if this is so different, I'm not seeing it. It is different, because we were barely in our 20s she wasn't your wife... ...and she wasn't pregnant. April's pregnant. She's a few months along. Does Eric know? April made me promise not to tell him. So, then, um, you're mad at Eric over something he doesn't even know about? That bag of rice could feed this whole crowd. They'd like to know when they're gonna see some of it. Well, odd as it might seem to you, Gray, we're trying come up with a plan to distribute this stuff fairly. It might have to last us through the winter. Through the winter? - My family's hungry now, not when you decide it's okay for them to be hungry. - This might be the last food we get. - Yeah? Well, we're not getting it, Jake, you are. - Look, we're hungry, too, Bill! Bill, nobody here is taking anything. If you'll just wait, you'll find there's plenty of this to go around. It may come as a surprise to some of you Greens, but many of us can think for ourselves. It is like Filene's Basement out here. - Oh, never mind. - Where's Stanley? - He's back at the farm. - We found two more parachutes. One of them has a generator. What are we doing here? Where is it? Well, it was right here. Let's try this way. Oh, my God. Stanley. - Hey, what happened? - Jonah... Nobody grabs a gun until we have a plan. - Jonah could have killed Stanley. - But he didn't. And I'm not getting us into a firefight unless I can get us out-- all of us. Look, why don't I go down there with Jimmy and Bill and talk to them. Uh, all due respect, Eric... hell no. Look, Jonah knows he's outnumbered. If we let him know our intent, he will listen to reason. Yeah, let's talk to him, 'cause that's worked out so well in the past. - If you'd shut Jonah down when I told you to, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - We need that generator. Without it we're stuck in the 1800s, and the longer we wait, the longer Jonah has to hide it or to trade it off. - It's now or not at all. - Nobody moves on the compound unless I say so. Nobody shoots unless I say so. Are we clear? Yes, sir. All right then, let's load up. - I'll take Jimmy and Bill... - You sit this one out, Gray. I have Jonah to worry about. I don't need somebody shooting me in the back. Maybe Dad will be home in time for our first Christmas together. - He'll be here. Won't he, Mom? - Yes, he will. You know what I'm most thankful for? Being reminded of how many excuses you always made for him. Doctor said no concussion, so... That thick skull of yours finally came in handy. - Where do you think you're going? - After Jonah. - No, you aren't. Stanley, please don't go. Stanley, if anything happened to you... Think of Bonnie. - Where you going? - To get the generator. - From Jonah? - Yeah. - Slow down-- we can think of a better way. - It's too late. Even if you get the generator, it won't end there. If you push my father, Jake, he'll push back. What do you want me to do? I've got Jonah. What about those pallets? - I don't see them. - Maybe they're gone already. Maybe not. They're on that flatbed. Okay. Jonah. Johnston. Give us the generator, you can keep everything else. I've got no idea what you're talking about. Let's take a look around, I'll show you. Sorry. Private property still means something out here. Now, if I still had a way of making a living at Gracie's market... this might be a different conversation. Open the gate or we're coming through. Those supplies dropped for everyone, not just you. You don't get to decide for the rest of us. I'm looking out for the whole town, what about you? Who the hell do you think saved Jericho from those mercenaries? I'm hanging on to the genny. We'll call it even. This doesn't end well for either of us, Jonah. Let's get ready. He's taking the genny! He's taking the truck out! - Who the hell...? - Hold it, don't shoot. What the hell were you thinking? That you could have gotten killed, and Jonah wouldn't have hurt me. What? - What about Mitchell? - He almost shot you. - Hell, we almost shot you. - But you didn't, Jake. - God, when we were in high school you would have been right there with me. - We're not kids anymore. Why don't you just say, "good job"? - What...? No. - I know it's what you're thinking. - I'll put these back on my way out. - Wait up, son. I got to go-- I told Mary I'd be back an hour ago. Well, she's waited this long, she can wait five more minutes. Grab a chair. Now, son, we both know that marriage is hard. It's a little late for this speech, Dad. Fine. I'll just fast-forward to the next one. Fatherhood is harder. - What are you talking about? - April's pregnant. I just found out myself. And I got to hear this from you? Well, I shouldn't be the one telling you. I'll probably be in the doghouse till next Thanksgiving but I thought you ought to know. - Well, I had no idea. - Now you do. And now you need to do the right thing. - I have, Dad. I tried to work things out with April. - Try harder. Look, a bad marriage doesn't get better because you add a kid. No. No, it doesn't, but you are going to have to stop thinking about yourself first. You give up that right when you bring a child into this world. Son, you and April had the bad luck to fall out of love at the same time but you can get that back. You're not hearing me, Dad. I don't think I ever loved April. I love Mary. And I have to trust that. My old friend iodine. Okay, so what do I do here? Just, um, dab the cotton ball in the iodine. Put the cotton ball on the cut. Ow! - Gently, please. - I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. - You know, I'm going to be okay, so... - No, the doctor said that we had to clean the wounds twice a day. So come on, please, off with the shirt. What do I got to close my eyes? Oh, my God. - You're, uh... - What? You're blushing. It's a reaction to the iodine, okay? - Ow! - I think it's a reaction to having your shirt off in front of me. - Don't flatter yourself. Come on, come on, I'm not done. Please, off with the shirt. You know, I'd guess a lot of things about you but being shy in front of women wasn't one of them. If, we're... if we're going to do this, can we at least talk about something else please? - Like what? - I don't know... What do you usually do on Thanksgiving? My mom and I go to a resort in Punta Mita. - That's Mexico. - Hmm. Why? What do you do? Uh... watch football, eat turkey, take a nap, like everybody else I guess. Well, you're missing out. Lounging by the infinity pool watching the surfer boys and sipping what most experts would agree is the world's finest mango margarita. Sounds fun. Un-American, but fun. It was. You're all set. Sorry you had to suffer through that. What's the plan, Jonah? The day I have to answer to you, Mitchell, we're in deeper trouble than I thought. You don't have to answer to me. You have to answer to them. Hey, I always find a way. Not today you didn't. - They outplayed us... once. It happens. - No, they didn't outplay us... she outplayed you. Are you mad that I didn't let you take the shot? - That I didn't let you kill my daughter? - You're getting soft, Jonah. - And your mistakes are costing us. - Saving Emily was no mistake. What about letting Mayor Green kick you out of town? I mean, come on, for God... You were taking orders from Gracie Leigh this morning. Hey, all you need to remember is I'm the guy that keeps saving your ass. You think you can do a better job than me? You going to make your move? I didn't think so. Let's go. You think we should hold on to these parachutes? - I mean, they're pretty trashed. - Why not? You can make some of those pants you used to wear in high school. Hey. What's that? It looks like a microchip. What's it for? I don't know. But I know who to ask. They're called RFIDs-- Radio Frequency Identifiers. - It's like a bar code, right? - Yeah. You know, if we had the right equipment, we could find out who sent 'em here. How do you know about this, Mr. Hawkins? I read a lot, Eric. Why are they in the chutes? They're used for tracking inventory, mostly by big global companies and by one military. - China? - No, the U.S. These chutes, they're from our air force. Let me get this straight now-- we're talking about Vietnam-era planes flying through Kansas airspace doing a Chinese drop and they're using U.S. Air Force equipment to do it. Sounds about right. - In what world does that make sense? - Ours. Stanley? - Stanley? - In the kitchen. You are not supposed to be up. - You know what? - I-I don't have a turkey, but, uh... I do have tequila. What about mangoes? You know, I've never seen a mango. - But... I have Tang. - Instant Tang? So in honor of your, um, first Thanksgiving here in Jericho I've made what some critics believe to be the world's finest... Tang-o margaritas. Oh, that's awesome. - Hey, listen, your father's not a hundred percent, so no roughing up the passer. - Are you kidding? - What? - All of it-- I mean, the football, the Thanksgiving dinner, I mean... - What about it? - Well, we're just holding on to these... these traditions like nothing happened out there? We're holding on to these traditions because of what happened out there. Oh, son! Good to see you made it. Yeah. I'm not staying. I was wondering if I could talk to April. Sure. So... it's over. Yeah. When were you planning on telling me about the baby? When I knew it wouldn't affect your decision. I didn't want you to stay with me because of the baby, Eric. - Well, I think we're the only two people that agree on that. - Great. Why did you come here? I came here to tell you that I'm sorry for what I did but I can't live a lie anymore. And I'll do whatever it takes to take care of that baby. Why should I believe you? You don't have to believe me. I'll just be there. - I think that's it. - How do we know this thing isn't some kind of bomb? Well, Gray's still alive, so let's risk it, huh? Thanks for your help, Mr. Hawkins. - Sorry to take you away on Thanksgiving. - Yeah. Hey, you know what, Bill? Could you hold off? Just give me ten minutes. No problem. Thanks. Guess we have one less dish to wash. Did you know about all this? Eric and Mary? You don't have to answer that. I knew a little. Think it'll work out? He says she makes him happy. Well, what about when she doesn't make him happy, he's gonna leave her, too? - Dad, it's not your problem. - I know, I know, it's just... - my one goal when I was raising you boys was that even when things got tough you made the right choices. - Hi, Emily. - Hey. Glad you could make it. You missed the football. I didn't want to show Jake up. - Really. - Mm-hmm. Hey, Jake, honey, put Emily next to you. Thank you. God, I hope April has a girl. Hey. I'm sorry. Yeah, that might've flown two hours ago. I know. I know, but, uh... Wait. Look, um, will you come with me? There's, uh, something I want to show you. Please, D. Hey, Bill. Thanks. Go ahead. You believe that? Wow!
