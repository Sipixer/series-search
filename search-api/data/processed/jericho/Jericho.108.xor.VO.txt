Not stopping until we get to Rogue River. --You can't just leave her on the side of the road like that. --See that second set of skid marks back there? Means someone forced her off the road and probably robbed her and killed her. For all we know, they could be waiting out there to do it again. I don't like it anymore than you do but if we don't make it, Dad dies. This is the world we live in now. Oh. Yes, it's ready. Oh, no, honey, watch out, sweetie. It's hot. Wow, I can't believe it worked, Mom. Yes, your father is a very smart man. --Should I go get him? --No, honey. He's working. Besides, this thing needs time to cool. Hello. Mrs. Hawkins, do you mind if we come in for a few minutes? Hey, Gray Anderson and Jimmy are here to see you. --They say about what? --No. I mean, I didn't get the feeling it was just a friendly house call. Okay. Okay. I got a route to the County Hospital in Rogue River. --Take Cedar Run Road... --No good. You don't even know what I was going to say. --Put the map away, we're taking the back roads. --Jake, Dad's on borrowed time. --We need to get the medicine and get back here! -- I spent most of my teenage years driving these roads. We'll make up the time. You always think you know better. These things loaded? Yes, it's loaded. What are we going to have to do, Jake? I don't know, but when it comes time to do it... I'll be ready. You haven't said anything for miles. Stay sharp. What happened to you, Jake? --What do you mean? --The last five years? Where were you? I'm assuming jail. --Why won't you tell me? --Why does it matter? Because, all that time I stood and I watched Mom and Dad suffer. Every time the phone rang, they thought it was you. I used to hate calling the house because we sound the same on the phone. I couldn't listen to them realizing it was only me. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry for what I did to our family but don't use me as an excuse for not getting on with your life. What's that supposed to mean? You wouldn't be the first guy to leave his wife, Eric. Look, I'm not telling you to leave her --I'm just saying that... -- You don't know what you're talking about, Jake. I'm talking about what you're afraid to say. Life's too short. Well, don't worry about me. Just drive. --Thanks for talking with us, Robert. --No problem, Gray. What's this all about? When I was in Topeka, people were saying that all of this could be a first step in a foreign invasion, except that getting all these bombs into the country would be pretty difficult... Without help on the inside. Exactly. I understand you and your family moved to Jericho just before the attacks. You bought your house in cash on a cop's salary. --Am I under arrest for not taking on a 30-year mortgage? --No, of course not. Well, if you wouldn't mind --my family and I were just about to sit down to dinner. --Actually, if you wouldn't mind humoring us, for a couple more minutes. You know, since all of this happened we're all, I think, understandably curious about anybody who's new in Jericho. Well, why don't you just ask me the question? You really think I was the mastermind behind the largest terrorist attack in the history of the world? Were you? Sorry... Listen, would you mind if I just ask your family a few questions? That's funny. You know, when I was a cop, that is just the kind of thing that I would say during an interrogation. --Purely informational. --And I would have said that, too, Gray. Well, Darcy's been wanting to get to know the neighbors. Come on. How long can he hold on like this? I can't say for sure. Maybe 12 hours. --12 hours? --I am so sorry. I... I've been married to that man for a long time. I refuse to believe this is the way it ends. --Oh,  hey. --Hey. --I brought some food. --Yeah. Come in. Gail's upstairs. I used to have this phobia of dairy products that didn't need to be refrigerated. Now I think God for processed cheese food. I brought soup-- creamy mushroom --The only stuff I have left is what I had for the food drive. --I guess we're not the only ones. How is he? He's getting worse. April doesn't think he has a lot of time. Oh, hi. I heard the door. I thought it was the boys. Heather brought some food. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. I'm so sorry about your husband, Mrs. Green. In this day and age, how can someone die of a fever? It's the 21st century, I can't get the right drugs. Can't even find ice to cool him off. I can make ice. I... one of the students had a project in the science fair last year. I just need water and... Do you have fertilizer? Maybe. In the garage. Okay. I can do this... I think. Okay, let's try. Okay. Grab every large bowl you have. And can you get some buckets, and get some fresh water from the well. It'll be cooler. I'll get the fertilizer. Buckets are in the laundry room. Where is everybody? Come on. Let's get to the hospital. See those markings? These homes were evacuated 10-25 by FEMA. 10-25-- that means they came through a month after the bombs. Well, if FEMA was here, at least there's still some sort of government. As  of a week ago. What  are the other numbers? The zero is the number they found alive. And the two? The number of dead. We're going to go in, we're going to get the medicine, and we're going to get out. Okay. "Federal Emergency Management Agency has determined that radioactive fallout from the blast in Lawrence, Kansas has contaminated the water table of this region. "Under no circumstances should water from any taps or wells be consumed. FEMA." Well, I guess that explains why this place is empty. What the hell?! Where's that coming from?! We got to get inside! Stay close. Oh, my God. What happened here? You okay? Yeah. --Where do you think those shots came from? --Top floor. Who the hell would be shooting at us? I don't know; if they have any Cipro, it's probably upstairs. .556. From an automatic weapon. Maybe they belong to these guys. --I didn't know Rogue River had a SWAT team. --They don't. These guys aren't cops. They're government contractors. A private army. A firm called Ravenwood. What are mercenaries doing in Kansas? The same thing they've been doing in Iraq and New Orleans. The military's been stretched so thin the past few years, mercenaries became a commodity. The real question is, did they kill these people? --Look, let's just get the drugs and go, okay? --All right. --You ready? --Yeah. Nice job with the stove. You burn the wood in the broiler-- right. Yeah. You know, we're just lucky we had gas instead of an electric 'cause it's got its own built-in vent. Where's your brother? How should I know? I'm here with you. Allison... manners. Let me know when dinner's back on. Will you, um... just pardon me a moment? So, Darcy, why did you decide to move to Jericho? Hey. I don't like that guy. I need you to do something for me, okay? The ammonium nitrate in fertilizer extracts the heat from the water. --How long is this supposed to take? --I think a while. I'm going to go up and check on him. God, I hope I'm not screwing this up. She's been up for 24 hours. They've been married for 40 years. Can you imagine? I'm was supposed to be married tomorrow. Hey, hey. Roger's coming back. So'Jake. All right, stay close to the wall. Come on. Come here. Look, if something happens to me, get in the car and go. All right? Find another town. Search house to house, if you have to. Jake, nothing is going to happen to you. Okay? Nothing ever does. Go! Go! Move! You went to Crow Island School. We moved here after our grandfather died. --Sam, are you listening? --I'm hungry. I want dinner. Oh, God... You know what, Sam? You should tell that to the guys in there. Just keep saying it as much as you can, okay. --Hey, pal, what you drawing? --My old house. Oh, yeah? Well, where is that? I'm hungry. Well, you know what, as soon as we're finished talking --maybe your mom will give you some of that pie. --I want it now. --Well, in a few... --Now. I'm hungry. --He gets a little cranky when he's hungry. --Yeah, I see that. --You mind if we get him something to eat? --No, no, of course not. I'll take him to the kitchen. Come on, Sam. Would you mind hanging out for a couple minutes? Whatever. Sam. See ya, buddy. You okay? You say something? All I hear is ringing. It'll pass in a minute. --You down there, freeze! Drop your weapons! --No. We're here for medicine. It's an emergency. We don't want trouble. There's no medicine here. We want to look for ourselves. We can trade you for food. We have everything we need. Go away. --Jake... --What? What, are you crazy? Didn't you hear him? He's scared. He threw a grenade. That was a flash-bang, not a grenade. It's just loud and bright to scare us. If he'd wanted to kill us, he would have. Putting our weapons down and coming up. You come up and I'll shoot you. All right, just take it easy. That's far enough. Gail... Oh, it's me, April. Gail's downstairs. She'll be up soon. I wish there was something more I could do. But there isn't. Please just hold on a little longer. Can I tell you a secret? You are going to be a grandfather. I haven't told anyone yet. Not even Eric. I don't know what he's going to say. But this child needs a grandpa. Hold on, okay? Please. You're with Ravenwood. How do you know? I spent a year and a half in the Green Zone running a supply rig up and down Route Irish to BIAP. You were in Iraq? --Soldier? --No, I just drove a truck for another contractor but I met a lot of Ravenwood guys. Where were you? Fallujah. Man, I thought I had it bad. I thought it was the worst thing I'd ever lived through... till  now. You mind putting that thing down? I'm just here for medicine. We don't have a lot of time. This is my brother Eric. I'm Jake. Come on. Randy Payton. I'll take you to see the doc. You're in, uh... you're in pretty bad shape. Morphine and instant coffee are the only things keeping me standing right now. What are you doing in Kansas? Not enough National Guard. Homeland Security hired us. Brought us in to protect the governor of Nebraska. Wait, the governor's alive? Don't know. When we landed, they brought us over here to help FEMA evacuate Rogue River. Where to? FEMA  set up a tent city in a Wal-Mart parking lot. A few miles north of here. What happened to these people? These are the ones that couldn't be moved. Too old... too sick. So you just killed them? No, not me. We tried to move them. But the doctors wouldn't allow it. There were so many of them. Crying out, begging. The guys, they just wanted to come in and they just wanted to take the medicine and they wanted to leave but the doctors started arguing with them and then, one of our guys, he... he just snapped. He started firing. Before I knew it, they all emptied their weapons. Why didn't you stop them? How do you think I got shot? They left me for dead with everybody else. There's the doc. When I came to, he was working on me. Patched me up as best he could. Been trying to save everybody else since then. I need more bloody light. --Doc? --Yeah? This is Jake and Eric. And they need medicine. Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia. Forgive me if I don't shake your hand. I need Cipro. Right. Morphine's worth a lot more, you know? Hey, I'm not selling it, all right? I need it now. It's for my father. It's Ravenwood. They're back. There are six or eight of them. They brought a truck. They're gonna clean out the hospital. Medicine, supplies, anything that's not nailed down. And they're gonna kill anybody they find alive. We know what they did. We can't let them get inside. Hey! Hey! One down. --What about a back exit? --It's barricaded. You want to live, stand up and fight. Well, that's when my grandma died and left everything to my parents. They wanted me out of the school I was in, so... we moved. --Was your father away from home a lot when you were a kid? --Of course. He's a cop. Mm. Did he bring friends around, anybody you thought was kind of strange? His friends are all cops. What about money? --Did your parents ever argue over money? --Doesn't everyone's? No, I-I'm thinking... you know, about the sudden windfall. --Like my Grandma's inheritance? --Right. When was that again? What-what, are you stupid? I already told you, six months ago. Don't be disrespectful, Allison. Dad, this is bull-- he's in our house acting like we're criminals or something. --Are you harassing everyone in town or just the black people? -- That's enough --Why are you letting him do this? --Look, I apologize, Mr. Anderson. --You're  apologizing to him? --Yes, and so will you. --Oh-ho, forget that. I'm not sorry. --Apologize. Dad, he's a racist! I hate this stupid town-- I wish we never moved! They're coming in. Why weren't they shooting? Ammo's in short supply-- they're gonna wait to fight in close. --Take some of these clips. --They're all empty. Look, we got to get the medication and get out of here. Doc! Where's the Cipro? --Where's the Cipro! --On the shelf. They're gonna come straight for us. We got to hide, let 'em pass, then we can slip out. I couldn't even save one. Not even one! Doc, we got to go or we're gonna be dead, too. --I got it, I got it! --Come on! My girl's been through a lot. --But I raised her better than that. --I want to assure you, Mr. Hawkins, that this is not about color. Black, white or otherwise, my only objective is to protect the people of Jericho. I got a boy about the same age. You should bring yours over sometime-- Samuel could use a playmate. Would you mind if Jimmy has a quick look around the house while we talk? Excuse me? Just a question of being thorough. And is... searching houses standard policy here? I thought this was... Kansas, not Soviet Russia. You know, we been pretty easy-going about all this. And I'm only asking for a little more patience so I know I can vouch for you. Unless... you're afraid there's something we'll find. You know, if you can overlook the mess... ...we can overlook the violation of our civil rights. Um... I'll just take a quick peek around, and... then we'll be on our way. Come on, let's go. What do you say we wait till they leave the building? That could take hours-- Dad doesn't have hours. What's wrong with him? He's gone into septic shock. Sepsis? You have to go back. What are you talking about? If your father's in septic shock, that means his organs are shutting down. That means that by the time you get to him his body won't even be able to process the Cipro. You need an intravenous drug. It's called Levaquin. --It's back in the ICU. --What's it look like? It's a clear bottle, purple label. --You'll need syringes. --Jake, this is nuts. We can't go back there. Well, we can't take the chance we have the wrong medicine. --What, we gonna shoot our way through? --Yeah, if I have to. I'm with you. Are you with me or not? Okay. --But we need a plan. --All right. This is definitely taking too long. Like the water should be freezing by now. You know, let's just dump these and start over. --Okay, shouldn't we wait till we figure out what we've done wrong? No. This is all we have. The mayor's running out of time. We got to cool him down. Everybody's counting on me, and it's not working. Yeah, but we have to give it time to work. Okay, you're freaking out! This one's cold. It's working. What did you do differently with this one? The... the bowl-- it's aluminum. --God, plastic's an insulator-- I'm so stupid. --So we just need more of these, right? --Yeah. --Anything metal-- pie tins, anything. --All right, I'll get 'em from the kitchen. --Okay. We got ice! Don't shoot. I'm a doctor. I'm unarmed. On your knees. Who are you? I can help your friend. What's your name? What's your name? --Don't make me ask you again. --Eric. Eric Green. I'm a doctor. The Red Cross brought me here. To shoot at me? --That wasn't me. --Who was it? The guys in that muscle car? I don't know what you're talking about. Where are they? Where are they? They're in the therapy room downstairs. There's, uh, three or four of them. Get 'em. Your man lost a lot of blood. I can help him. Get up. Fire in the hole! Clear left. Clear right. Room's empty. Move out. All right, we need something to cut his shirt. Uh, s-something sterile. Hey, what are you doing? I'm... I'm just getting something for the pain. He can handle the pain. Just get to work. You people drafted my husband into your police force and now you're suspecting him of being a criminal. We're not suspecting anything. --We just want to know... --Yeah. "Who's in your town." Yeah, I heard. This has been unpleasant for all of us. Some more than others. I found something. Darcy. I'm gonna need a minute alone with Mr. Anderson. Payton, let's go! Go on! Come on! Car's out front. Go! No. This is on me. --Payton. They'll kill you. Come on. --I don 't care. I deserve this. I emptied my gun up there, too. Go. Let me do this. Come on! Go! --Where's Payton? --He's not coming. Why didn't you just tell me you were a federal agent? How do you even know that that badge is real? I guess... I don't. The fakes are usually made of aluminum. It's cheaper. Lighter. If it's heavy... ...that's how you know. Don't just assume that because somebody has one of these that it is real especially not these days. --But why didn't you say anything? --Because I don't know you. I don't know who I can trust. You see, the bureau was tracking some suspicious contacts between unknown people in this area of Kansas and... terrorist groups abroad. What kind of contacts? Pay phone calls. Money transfers. You know, I was relocated to investigate undercover, Mr. Anderson. and as far as I'm concerned I am still on the job, so... --I would appreciate your discretion. --No, of course. Jimmy's the only one who knows. --I'll make sure it stays that way. --Good. The people who did this, they will try to hit us again. We can't let that happen. But from now on, we keep an open line with one another. Okay, then. Man, it's been a long day. If you don't mind... I'm just happy to have you on the team, Mr. Hawkins. I'm very sorry for the intrusion. You do not have to apologize for anything. You did good work. Is he? Barely. Just hurry. --Okay, let's go. --April... --This is Dr. Kenchy. --April Green. Did you get the Cipro? This is Levaquin. It will go directly into his system. --Are we on time? --Well... if his body is strong enough, we will know by morning. He's strong enough. You're gonna be all right, Dad. You're going to be okay, sweetheart. It's a nice job. Got the key? Thank you. I know you're one of the good guys. --Thanks for staying with my mom. --Glad to help. She's being humble. She saved your father's life. Well, you guys get some sleep. What did you see out there? Another time. Good night. Good night. --What's all this stuff? --I don't know. How you feeling? Honestly... Couldn't tell you. You'll be okay. All right? You'll get through this. You're a much better person than I am, so... I know you'll be fine. I don't know if I'm a better person. I'm in love with Mary Bailey. You knew that, didn't you? I'm gonna tell April. Life's too short, right? Whatever you do, I'm sure it'll be the right thing. Let's get some rest. Where's my jacket? I don't know. Did you leave it in the car? Jake, I left my jacket back there-- the wallet is in the jacket-- the address. --What if those guys come here? --Those guys are dead, all right? Payton took care of it. Don't worry. --I'm sorry I screwed up. --You did great out there today. Get some sleep, we'll worry about it tomorrow. --Good night. --Good night.
