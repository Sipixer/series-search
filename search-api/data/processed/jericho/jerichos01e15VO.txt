the middle of nowhere. They've been walking for weeks. They must have gone through hell. Oh, my God. Roger. There's a woman in that group of refugees that Bill is processing. I think you should talk to her. Hello, Rob. Someone on my team sold us all out. You're smart enough to know that they would say anything to get you to talk. At current levels of consumption, we will be completely out of gas and diesel in two weeks. We can live without power for now, but we won't see spring if we don't eat. All right, look, the further out you get, the hairier the roads are, and food being as scarce as it is, there's bound to be trouble out there. Why are they following us? Stanley, hold on! Jake! It's Mom and Dad, honey! You're going to be all right. So, I'm being watched? It's the Old Man. He's coming for us, using us against each other. If they kill me, they will never find the package. I have something in my possession, and there's people out there that want it. And that puts you, me and the kids in danger here. Then listen to me... Sarah is not on our side. I'm telling you, Robert, she's not here to help us. Hawkins is starting to put the pieces together. He needs to be eliminated. - I know. - Why are you stalling on this one? Because this one is different. You won't make it out of Kansas with the fuel you've got, and you're not going to find another drop out there. The folks who left last week are probably in Arizona by now. If they weren't murdered on the highway. It is suicide to leave, Ridley. There's no food, no heat. It's suicide if we stay. This... this is everything. I mean, it's every farm. At least until the spring crops come in, and that could take months. And what if we don't factor in the refugees? They're a part of this town now. A lot of extra mouths to feed. They've done their part, Gray. They've helped hunt, cut firewood... Resources they use up five times faster than they supply them. When the windmills come in from New Bern, most of our fuel issues will be solved. What about every day until then? Ridley and his group are about to leave. If people want to try and make it on their own, that's their right. You know as well as I do that come springtime, we'll find their bodies out there. Well, what do you want me to do, Johnston? Wh-What am I missing that's not on that board? You find it for me, 'cause I don't see it. Without some "X" factor, we're not going to make it through the winter. Not all of us. We have to make some hard decisions. And I think the last ones in should be the first ones to go. Clear the streets! We need to clear the streets! Who's in charge here? I'm Gray Anderson. I'm the mayor of Jericho. Glad to meet you, Mayor Anderson. I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill. Fourth MAR-DIV, Fourth Tank Battalion, Charlie Company. So you're...? Sir, we're the United States Marines, and we're here to help. Season 1 - Episode 15 " Semper Fidelis " [ Transcript ] swsub.com [ Synchro ] Loky / aSpro5oo [ www.seriessub.com ] They sent the marines? We were deployed to Western Kansas to set up a firm base and prep the outlying towns for the arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers. Now that we've won the war, it's time to start rebuilding. War? What war? - You didn't hear? - No. We lost all communications after the EMP. Well, we nuked the hell out of North Korea and Iran. So they were behind it? From what I hear, which isn't much, Iran financed it, North Korea supplied the bombs. We've got troops all over the world going after the... terrorists who snuck them in, but at least we took out the big dogs. What happens now? Largest reconstruction effort in the history of the country. So there's somebody finally in charge? The former secretary of HHS is now the president. We heard there were six guys from six different capitals claiming to be president. Resolved. The federal government is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio. How did they decide on Columbus? All I know is, my orders are coming from the commanding officer of the Fourth Battalion, and those are to restore lights, power and infrastructure to Kansas, one town at a time. W- Wait, wait. When is that going to happen? Should have your shelves full of Oreos and Hot Pockets by the end of the year. Welcome back to the grid, Jericho. Thank God for the US Marines. Hey! Hey! It's over. There are kids out here. Get a room. Come on. We should have been on the road yesterday. Well, I'm packed. Hi. We're all fueled up. How are we doing? We'll be ready when we're ready. I'll get the rest of my things from downstairs. How many more times are we going to have to move? - This should do it. - Really? You're going to stay in one place from now on? Sergeant Green. Marine Corps? Ah, hell, no. Army Rangers. Well, I'll try not to hold it against you. Listen, Gunny, how long before the engineers get here? Could be two days, could be two weeks. In the meantime, why don't you get a wish list of what you need, and I'll forward that on to Battalion Headquarters in Dodge City, and we'll start to get y'all back on your feet.  - Roger that. Just tell me how I can be of service. Going to need a command post. - Use the sheriff's office. - Great. Excuse me. If you guys are going to be here for a while, why don't I take your men over to my tavern. Thanks, ma'am, my troops could use it. Wymore! Front and center! Move it, move it! Muster up and follow this young lady here. The liberty call is sounded, but remember... conduct yourselves like marines. - Aye Sir. Don't you "sir" me, PFC. I work for a living. Dismissed! Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant. Couple of months ago, I would have had that kid doing push-ups till he puked, but, uh, they've been through a lot. I understand. Anything else we can do? Well, Sergeant, uh... one other thing. Corporal Mullin! Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge some replacement parts. Our radio, well, it took a couple of pretty good hits. Do you have any idea where I could start? Maybe I could help. Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin. - Jake. - Maggie. So you're the town's electronics expert? No, I'm not an expert at anything. - But I can improvise. - I'll take that. We'll see what we can find. So, uh... I've been thinking... Maybe leaving my family... isn't such a good idea. What? Why? We've been over this. They-they're not safe here with you. I know. There are people out there who would... hurt them in order to get to me. But at least I understand the dangers. I can protect them. You're not thinking straight. This is my family, Sarah. It never mattered before. Now it does. What's it going to take... someone slitting your wife's throat before you get it ? You're right. We will drop them at the safe house, and then we'll keep moving. It's the right thing for them. I just realized... Hmm? If the government is up and running, you know what that means, right? - No Paperwork. They'll need accountants again. Does that mean I'm back in debt? Don't be so negative. New York made it. Come next summer, I'll be taking walks though Central Park. What? Dude! This is awesome! I could totally be a marine. I could totally see that happening... Except for everything about you. God, I... Don't worry about her. It's a phase, trust me. The minute everything calms down, he's as good as gone. Yeah, yeah, maybe you can give him a ride out of town on the way to New York. Thinking about leaving this town is not the same thing as thinking about leaving you. No? Well, it adds up to the same thing, Mimi. Maybe you could come with me. Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry. That's not my life. Well, this isn't mine. I've missed you. Me, too. We should get going. Start loading up the truck, huh? Go on, get out of here. I heard what happened. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm better than the truck. Be able to quit worrying about you one of these days, right? Hey, Jake. Amazing, huh? Yeah, it's great news. I'll see you later. How are most of the towns out there? Let's just say I haven't seen anything like this since we entered the CZ. "CZ"? Contamination Zone. You're in CZ-12, and you're better off than most. That's hard to imagine. Try taking a walk through what's left of Lawrence, Kansas. What's it like? Buildings are all gone. People who are left are fighting their neighbors for food and water. Makes you wonder if the survivors are the lucky ones. We need a transistor for their radio. Can we take apart the jukebox? Oh, you're going to take my music? Isn't there anything else you can take apart? You've got three Spin Doctors albums on here. Trust me, it's a public service. Don't worry, there's an old ham radio in City Hall. Maybe we can take that apart. - Thanks anyway. - Bye. Oh, hey, big guy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I think you have something of mine. Sweetie, let's sit down on the couch. Your dad and I have some talking to do. You go ahead, Sam. Just play with your coloring books. This is what you want, right? Among other things. You been lying to me, Robert. When did you fall back in love with your wife? It's okay. You go back to your book. Go ahead. We tried to institute rationing early on, but it took some time for people to accept that we were really on our own. Looks like you did a better job than most towns I've seen. Town's lucky to have a military man in charge. Well, I guess we made out all right. With salt from my mine, we've been able to do some trading with nearby towns. Your town seems to have been blessed. That said, uh... I can't say you'll be a priority on the list. Um, uh... Wait a minute... what list? We got detachments all over Kansas assessing each town's needs. Relief is given on an as needed basis. Wait a second. You're saying that because we planned better than others it will come against us? We can make out for a while longer if we have to. That's easy for you to say. You're not being held accountable. Why don't you give me that want list and, uh, I'll see what I can do. Try that one. Perfect. So you're really not going to tell me what happened? Doc says frostbite. Doctor also say who kicked your ass? Someone ran us off the road. Most of it's a blur. Just, uh, tried to stay alive, you know? I do. - So, the marines, huh? - Yeah. Is it everything you hoped for? There are moments. But when I signed up, I never thought I'd be fighting Americans. Good people forced to do bad things. That's got to be rough. I'm sorry. It's not your problem. What? Just, uh, wondering why someone like you would join the marines. Someone like me? I had an office job until a few years ago, but I got bored. I wanted to see the world. - Have you? - I've seen Omaha. - You? - What, seen the world? Yeah. Yeah, I just saw all the wrong places. Man, you have this brooding, bad-boy thing down to an art. The video I was sent before the attacks, those people were not holding you captive. You were just... what, you were playing me? Me playing you? We were living together. I showed up here and you have a family again. It's okay. It's just a... a story, you know? It's just a story we're telling. Go back to your book. You made me promises, Robert. Who were the people in that video? Is that who you're working for? I was. Now, I'm working for myself. So why don't you give me what I want, and then this story can have a happy ending. What are you gonna do in the Marines finally... - cut you loose? - I try not to think about it. That means you have. After everything I've seen... I'd like to find a nice little town and just settle in for the duration. I don't think those exist anymore. I just found out they do. What about you? You ever thought about flying again? Maybe for the military? Sure. Safer than being on the ground, right? Not if you're a radio operator. I'm the safest of all. I get to ride in the tank. But if you ride in the tank, how'd the radio get shot? What, you think a girl can't... get out and kick some ass every once in a while? Who you trying to call on that thing anyway? Uh, division headquarters in Dodge City. That's about 200 miles away. This thing's made it farther. Of course, that was before it took some rounds. Fourth MAR-DIV. Fourth MAR-DIV, this is First Platoon, Charlie Company. Authentication "thunder." Over. Fourth MAR-DIV. Fourth MAR-DIV. This is First Platoon, Charlie Company. Authentication "thunder." Over. Lima Charlie Thunder. This is Charlie Company Actual.</i> We've been trying to raise you on this frequency for days. Division needs the entire fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP. Do you copy? Aye, aye, sir. Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal. Roger that, Charlie Company Actual, out. What's going on? We just got ordered back to Dodge City. What are you going to do with the package, Sarah? Sell it. And get as far away from here as possible. What happened to you? The last few months, I've learned two things. Everybody has a price. And everybody lies. Sit still, Sam. - Take your... - Stay there I was just having a conversation with your husband... about what's more important to him... His job... or his family. Why are you leaving ? Because we were ordered to. Sorry, but I can't reveal operational orders. Army Corps of Engineers will be through eventually. Eventually? How long? Sir, listen, I'm sorry, but I just don't know. You ready to roll? Good to go, Gunny. But I don't know about the tank. Don't know if we have enough fuel to make it back to Dodge City. Leave it behind if we have to. We'll post Sigloch and Kent here till we can make it back. Sergeant, without armor we're sitting ducks for those highwaymen. We're marines. We'll make do. I can get you fuel. Not much, but enough to get you back to Dodge. Just give me an hour. I'm listening. Plus... whatever supplies you need. But I just need assurances that Jericho will be taken care of. There's three C-130s full of Red Cross supplies that are supposed to arrive in Kansas in 12 days. I guarantee you'll be at the top of their list. That's all I ask. All right, people, listen up! We're going to stand down for one hour. When the relief effort comes, are you guys coming with it? No. You're going have to flirt with a whole new batch of grunts. And the Corps of Engineers are nowhere near as cute as I am. You should think about... coming back when you get out. What would I do here? That's a question we're all asking ourselves, but... you're a good fit. You know, before all this started, I might have agreed with you. But, uh... I won't make it back here. Corporal Mullin! Yes, Gunnery Sergeant. Why is your gear not loaded up? - Uh... - Don't answer that. We're headed over to the town hall. The mayor wants to express his appreciation. Somebody needs to stay here. You... Youjust drew the short straw. Aye, Gunny. I'm going to go get the last of the supplies from the sheriff's office. Get the package. You know I can't do that. You think I'm going to believe a word you say? Come on. We can work this out. You had your chance to go with me. Please! Shut up! You're losing something tonight. I promise you that. Only question is, is it going to be something with a heartbeat? I'll get the package. Please put that gun down. Why don't you get Allison down here, too? Lima Charlie Thunder. This is Charlie Company Actual.</i> Do you copy? Lima Charlie, it's cold as hell out here. Hello? This is Jake Green. Jake Green, this is an official Marine channel. Get off this... Hello? Hello. Are you taking fire? Hey, Gunny! It's just a little something to remember us by. This is too kind, Mr. Mayor, but, uh, we really should press on. No, you can't take off on an empty stomach. Come on in, I got a little surprise for you. Just something to show our gratitude. Come on. I need you to grab some of our guys from patrol and do a sweep of the area, all right? Take guns. Are you kidding? I mean, we got the US Marines Corps here. Something's wrong about all this. Trust me. Okay, okay. Well... what am I looking for? A guy with a radio for starters. Check anywhere within earshot of the fireworks. All right, maybe it's nothing. Just check. - All right? Go! - Okay. I can't talk. What? It's good talking to you. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Honored guests. I was very hopeful that former Sergeant Green might like to say a few words. Ladies and gentlemen, um... Marine Corps has a motto "Semper fidelis" Always faithful. And I think it's very fitting that in our darkest hour, it was marines who came to our rescue. Never before in our nation's history has a motto been so tried... ...and so necessary. Gunny, Marines, semper fi. So, Gunny, the Fighting Fourth. Seen more than your share of action. From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war, there's the fourth. Semper fi. Excuse us a second. What is the matter? What's going on? Downstairs. I just, uh... I heard the fireworks over the marines' radio, and Dodge City is 200 miles away. - What?  - They've got somebody on the edge of town pretending to be their headquarters. I sent Stanley and a couple of the guys to check it out. Tell me I'm crazy. If you are, so am I. Nobody calls an NCO "sir," and a marine would never say, "Hoo-ah." That's an Army thing. These guys did both. Marines are all about detail. Well, if they're not marines, who are they? People with enough firepower to wipe us out. And we gave them half the town's supplies. What do we do? Well, we've got to tell Gray. How do we get Gray alone? He's right next to them. We got to do something about that tank. That thing gets turned lose on Main Street, it'll be a bloodbath. Even if you get that tank, they'll still have a room full of hostages. She's right. We better get back before they start to wonder. Try to get a message to Gray, and I'll wait for Stanley. I'll see what I can do about the tank. Hey. How was Dodge City picking up our fireworks? We pick up pops and pings all the time... Don't lie to me! Hello? Anyone out there? Stanley, is that you? Jake, we found this guy camping out here with this radio. Says he's with the marines. I'm going to bring him back. Is any of this real? The gun's real. I'm sorry. You con people out of stale food and enough fuel to get to the next town? You don't know how bad it is out there. Yeah, I do. Where'd you get all this? There was a food riot in our refugee camp. A dozen marines never had a chance against 10,000 starving people. So you killed them? They retreated and we took what they left. Tried to get some food in the next town. It worked so well, we kept doing it. Don't. You're not leaving town with those supplies. Don't get yourself killed doing something stupid, Jake. I don't want that on my conscience. You don't have it in you. Open it. Step... back. My God. - This has been here the whole time? - It is not armed, and the lead blocks all the radiation... - You brought that into our house?! - D... We were almost out of here, and you told him, Maggie? He figured it out. He heard the fireworks on the radio. - So what do we do with him now? - What do you mean? Let's just leave. And what... wait for him to tell the whole town when we're half a mile out? It'll be Greenville all over again. We're not killers. I was a P. E. teacher who saw too many movies. Now I'm a marine. I'm adapting. - No. - It's him or us. I vote for you. You know, ammunition being in such short supply, I doubt those weapons are even loaded. You want to take that chance? I know damn well this one is. Son of a... bitch! Get your hands up! Get them up! Get up. How dare you wear that uniform! It's not a uniform... it's a costume. Half the towns we go through don't even fly the flag. Wait. Everything you said about the war, North Korea, it was all a lie? Some of it we heard, some we made up. It's anybody's guess what's really going on out there. Well, we still have laws in Jericho, and tomorrow I'm going to let the town decide what to do with you. We can't do that, Gray. The hell we can't! People need to know what we're up against. Not like this. Well, they're going to find out eventually. Yeah, they will. And by then, the worst of it will be over. But food's not enough. You said it yourself. Without some "X" factor, we don't make it through the winter. Well, this is it. People need faith just as much as they need food. And what the hell do we do with them? Then we give a hero's exit. Ooh-rah. How can I be sure you won't follow me? I won't follow you. Not if I take your son with me, you won't. My God. I'll leave him just outside of town. No! - Dad! - Allie, get them out of here! - You okay? - I'm fine, Dad. - I'm sorry. - Dad... I'm fine. Let me take this. You are not fine. Robert, we are not fine! How long till-till more people come after you? Huh, after us? - Come on, D, we're safe here. - Don't...! We'll never be safe with you. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, baby girl. Move out! Let's go! Our own personal escort out of town? Look, you're a smart girl, you need to get out before these guys get you killed. And go where? Towns aren't taking refugees, and there's only one thing they want women for. Stay here... all right, you'll be safe. It's not going to work. Not after the story we told. Not now, Mimi. Like hell not now, Cornhusker. Cornhuskers are from Nebraska. I'm a Jayhawk. What? What? You drive me so crazy, and you know that I can't stay here forever, but... the truth is... I can't live without you, either. Really? Yes, really. We got enough food to get all of you a few days down the road. Hey, how about some water, man? Make do. You'll leave your weapons on the tank, and you will move out. Do it. Come on. Let's go. Be careful. What do we do? We soldier on. What do we do with that? Got room in your barn? Seriously? Why not.
