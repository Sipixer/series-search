You heard the man. Rise and shine, babe. I thought we were gonna sleep in. - We did, got up at 6:00. - Oh, Roger. Maybe this wedding isn't such a good idea. Still have a few hours to change your mind. - If you come back to bed, I won't. - Oh, Emily, I wish. Got to meet the folks. Apparently, they're not all that thrilled about their accommodations. 'Cause they're only in the best bed-and-breakfast in town. Yeah, well, when you're used to staying at the Pierre overlooking Central Park... Do you think your parents will ever get used to a small town girl stealing away their big city boy? Sure. Soon as we move back to civilization. Right. Noise and traffic and pollution. Don't forget about the crime. I'm not kidding, Roger. This is it. When we're married, this is where we live. Sure that's what you want? What's that supposed to mean? Sure it's what you want? Roger. Roger! Roger! Roger. We're filling up the hummers now. - What's that? - Some one in the window. There's someone here. Hey! What the hell are you guys doing out there? Hey, I'm talking to you. Sorry, we didn't want to knock at this hour. - Stanley, what's going on? - Go back inside and lock the door. You're on private property. This isn't a gas station. I'll see to it you're reimbursed, sir. - We work for the federal government. - Yeah, what kind of work? Just making sure folks have everything they need-- medical supplies, clean water, food. A friend of mine told me to look him up if we came through. You know Eric Green? I'm sorry, I can't help you. Thanks for the fill-up. Hey. You stay down here all night? Thought I'd keep an eye out, just in case. - Listen, Jake, yesterday when you talked about where you been... - How'd it go with April? Did you tell her about you and Mary? Didn't think it was the right time. Yeah, it's never gonna be. Eric... Hey, come in. Hey. Sorry to come by so early. We were awake. What's up? Some guys showed up at the farm last night. Couple Humvees, guns. - They knew Eric's name. - Ravenwood. Who? Mercenaries. We ran across them in Rogue River. Okay, well, what the hell do they want? Everything. - Ravenwood? What the hell is that? - It's a private security firm. They hire thugs and army dropouts They give them big guns and send them out to play soldier. - What are they doing in Kansas? - FEMA hired them to evacuate Rogue River. But now they're in business for themselves. They stripped the town of all their supplies they killed police and civilians. You've heard of these guys? - Now they want to hit Jericho. - I think they were scouts. - Probably want to know if we're worth a visit. - We should fortify, just in case. - Shore up our borders at the most vulnerable points. - Already there. - I ordered armed checked points on Cherry Valley Road and Route 660. - Check points? Yeah, keep track of who's coming into town. The mayor was sick, you were gone, I figured it shouldn't wait. They'll probably come from the east across the Tacoma Bridge. I think we should block it. My farm is on the other side of that bridge. - And so's 30 other families. - Everyone on that side will have to come into town. - It's not safe to stay over there. - Over there. You want me to abandon my farm? - Jake, you've got to be kidding. - Just for now, Stanley. Bill, get some guys together, start collecting ammo. Whatever they're willing to part with. - We'll stockpile it here. - I still have some explosives at the mine. We'll take anything you got. Morning, April. I thought I could get Johnston to eat something. No, it's better to let him sleep. Let his body adjust to the meds. Oh, okay. - You ready for some more good news? - Are you kidding? His blood pressure's stabilizing. And the fever seems to be resolving. I think he's going to be okay. Well, that calls for a real celebration. Can I offer you some mashed black-eyed peas? None for me. It hasn't been a particularly good morning if you know what I mean. 'Course, it could be the nerves as much as the pregnancy. Nerves? You didn't tell Eric yet? Oh, he was just so exhausted last night. And then he was up and gone before I had the chance. - Any idea where he went? - No. He and Jake were both gone when I came downstairs this morning. Gail... do you think he'll... well, the timing just seems so... You're talking about my first grandchild. The timing couldn't be better. Now tell him. Get as many guys as you can. There's a farm up the road with a couple of dead trucks. - Bring them back here, we'll use them as a barricade. - Got it. - You think that'll make a difference? - It's better than nothing. This isn't your first run-in with Ravenwood, is it? Why? You go off on your road trip all of a sudden they're headed for Jericho. Would've thought you'd be more careful is all. You think I led them here on purpose? Hey, I'm just trying to put the pieces together, Jake. Well, let me make it easy for you. - My family lives in Jericho. - So does mine. - Everything I do, I do to protect them. - Same here, man. Well, then let's stop screwing around and get it done. What am I doing? - Em, you in there? It's Heather. - Yeah, just a second. - Sorry to barge in. - That's okay. These are for you. - Closest thing I could find to a wedding bouquet. - Thanks. I'm sorry, is this weird? You were supposed to get married today. I figured I should do something special. You know, to acknowledge the day. Maid of honor and all. Just ignore me, okay? This is really sweet, what you did. You got any plans for today? Besides not getting married? 'Cause I kind of planned a whole day to keep you occupied. I thought we'd start with a hike. - Nothing exotic, just a hike along the river. - I don't think I'm gonna be great company. Company's kind of the point. - Keep moping to a minimum. - I don't really have a choice, do I? Not so much. Good. Okay, we're gonna need another car. Put it here. Let me guess-- this isn't your first run-in with these guys either, is it? - You know, there's only one thing I need to know from you, Jake. - What? Would you even know when you're in over your head? - Hey, you're back. - Yeah. Just for a second. Got to get this stuff to town hall. Eric, wait. I have... I have something to tell you. Okay. Let's talk. When I, uh... had the divorce papers drafted I did that because I couldn't see a future for us. But now I can. I can't. What? Look, the last thing I want to do on this Earth is to hurt you, April... but I'm in love with someone else. Who? Mary Bailey. April... Look, April... - April, I'm sorry... - No, you don't get to do this. You son of a bitch. Get the trucks! Let's go! They're coming! They're here. Hey, they're here! Come on, back. Just run! Come on, hustle. Keep coming, keep coming. Let's go, let's go. Come on, move. Move. Everybody keep moving. Check your positions, check your clips, safety's off. Come on, everybody! - Remember what we talked about! - Nobody fires until I say so. And everybody remember all right? The most important thing to do before squeezing the trigger is to breathe, okay? Somebody here want to talk to me? Whoever's in charge, this road needs to be cleared. We're under government orders to collect supplies. Breathe. Cease fire. Cease fire. Listen up. We're here on government orders to collect supplies. Your cooperation is mandatory? Understood? Mandatory. When I get back here, this bridge better be cleared. Or I'll clear it myself. You got four hours. Understood? Let's roll. What the hell are we going to do? There's no way we can hold this bridge. We're going to have to take it out. I agree. What are you saying? There can't be a bridge. I struck gold with Mr. Adams. - He gave up all that ammo without fight? - Oh, he kept plenty. Guy's rec room looks like the basement of the Alamo. - Where do you want this? - In the gun locker. Eric... Why aren't you at the bridge? We need to talk. - No way, we're not doing it. - Think about it-- with the bridge gone, we can't be overrun. Until Ravenwood turns around and comes at us from another direction. Not before they pass New Bern or some other town. - Better them than us. - This will buy us time. Then we focus our manpower and resources on securing the other roads. I can't believe what I'm hearing. If we destroy that bridge, it is gone forever. Do you think we can do without it? What about the farms on the other side? - Access to the food for winter. - There are farms closer to town. Okay, what about the homes you'll isolate? - Jake, that means cutting off Stanley. - They'll have to come over. - Look, there has to be a better way. - Ravenwood is coming back right now. We've got no time. What do you suggest? We can get more men. - Pull them off the outposts if we have to. - Send more men out there, you're going to get more men killed. Bill... lock up the explosives. - Now wait a minute... - Nothing happens to that bridge. We can face them with whatever we can muster. - How can you...?! - The answer is no. Okay, I'm just going to go into Gracie's and get some trail mix, or, you know, shoe polish, dental floss, whatever's left. Oh, and if the engine starts to shake just slide over and gun the gas. And keep your eye on the temperature. If the needle hits the red, cut the gas, 'cause you've got about two seconds before it's about to explode. Okay? - Why-why can't I just go in? - Oh, no, no, no. I don't want you to go through the trouble. Right. Hey, space cadet, what are you waiting for? Come on, let's go. So, this is it. You ready? Why, don't I look ready? Well, you're definitely dressed for the occasion. So, yeah, let's roll. What are you waiting for, Em? Emily... Emily... Emily... Emily! Em... Em, Em, turn it off. - Turn it off. - I'm sorry. - There was a truck with these guys with guns. - Yeah. Um, we're not hiking today. Everybody's supposed to stay indoors. Something's going on outside of town. - All the roads are blocked. - Let's go home. Home? They didn't say "home." They said "indoors." Heather, I, uh... Hey, look, it's not the end of the world, right? 'Cause that already happened. What should we do? We're going to proceed directly to phase two. - I found two flare guns. - Good. Position a couple of guys maybe two miles out. Give them the flare guns. Tell them to send up a signal when they have Ravenwood in sight. Gray, I'm going to round up as much diesel and fertilizer as I can. I'll meet you back at the bridge. He's making explosives? - So you're blowing it anyway? - That's right. Look, Jake, you got loyalty to your brother and your family, I get that. So if you want to bow out, no one will blame you. But that bridge is coming down. Where are you going? Someone's got to tell those people who live out there to come over. - So this is phase two? - Yep. Hey, you guys here about that thing at Tacoma Bridge? Yeah, why do you think we nixed the healthy portion of today's program? Keys please. Uh, I don't know what that plan is but I don't know if it's such a good idea. What exactly is the plan? This may be the last bottle of single malt Scotch Kansas sees in a long time. You say the word, we open it. But if we do, you're not leaving till it's finished. So phase two is that we get completely obliterated? More or less Works for me. He's been here since this morning. I felt bad for him. It sounds like he's had a rough couple of weeks. Ladies. So what do you say? I say what the hell. That's my girl. Who's on lookout for the flares? Stanton Broksmier. You're blowing up the bridge? The Millers will be here in an hour. They got their old Nova working. You can ride with them. - Go pack your bag. - No. Don't argue with me. When that car gets here, you're going to be in it. Now go. And what about you? I'm staying. Don't be stupid, Stanley. They're coming back. Jake, I'll hold them off. I did it before. Look, it's going to be a couple of guys this time. They left a pile of bodies in Rogue River. You want to wind up like that? Stanley, please don't get yourself killed for a house. Hey, my grandfather built this house from the ground up. And that room you've been sleeping in... That was my dad's room when he was a kid. They put that in your audit file? I'm not about to give it up without a fight. If we had guardsmen, people who were trained-- we could take a stand, but we don't. Once we blow that bridge, everyone who's on this side of it is on their own. Okay, so go warn people. You're wasting time here. They're here. Get your stuff. I'm not leaving. This is my home, too. - Bonnie, it is not safe for you here. - I'm not afraid. - Bonnie... don't argue with me. - We'll be okay if we stay together. Stanley. - She's not going? - I can't force her. You're risking her life-- and yours. - I don't get it, Stanley. - Because it's not your family. Bonnie grew up in this house, we both did. This house is her only connection to a mother and father she barely even remembers. That's funny, I though you were that connection. Good luck. Skoal. Ah! Oh... Whoa. This is your captain speaking. - We are experiencing minor turbulence. - Are you okay? I am awesome. Hey. You there. Mr. Dark and Intriguing. Keep my friend company till I get back and there's a shot in it for you. Your friend is spicy, huh? May I? - So it's your birthday? - No. I... No. To privacy then. Pretty bad out there, isn't it? Oh, poverty, murder, disease. It's bloody miserable. Sorry. Sorry. - I am drunk, and I haven't slept in weeks. - Me, too. - Sent everything out, right? - The last box just went out on the truck. Bill, what's going on here? I'm sorry, Eric. I got this, Bill. - Where the hell's the dynamite?! - The decisions been made. - We're blowing the bridge. - Who's "we"? - Myself, Robert Hawkins, the deputies... and your brother. - Hey. - I've got to talk to Dad. - No, you will talk to me right now. - I don't have time. April told me. - Mom, I didn't mean for things to turn out this way. - Oh, really? How did you mean for things to turn out? You're the one who chose not to work on your marriage. - You're the one who chose to cheat on your wife. - I am trying to do the right thing. - I know it doesn't seem that way right now... - What's going on? - Johnston... - Dad... The mercenaries from Rogue River, they followed us back. We have a checkpoint at the Tacoma Bridge and I think we can defend it but there's this plan to destroy it and cut off the town. Gray Anderson? Yeah, he's out there right now wiring it. - Where are Jimmy and Bill? - Out there helping Gray. - Dad, I'm alone I'm this one. - Get your brother and stop them. Jake is with them, too. Then you stop them. Whatever it takes, you stop them. Whatever it takes. - How's it coming? - Just a few wires left. Hurry guys. All right, everybody, keep it moving! We got to keep up the pace. We gotta keep moving. - We see that flare, it's going to be too late. - John, I need to borrow your truck. Please. We don't have much time, folks. All right, good. Hold on to that. Make sure the lines don't cross. - Keep the gold away from the blue. - Jake. Got it. Yeah, yeah. Eric... Here, run this to the trunk. - Dad wants this stopped. - Well, Dad doesn't have all the information. - It's still his call, Jake. - Well, here's not here to make it. Eric... What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm putting an end to this. We could see that flare any minute. You'll be cut off. You can't go out there, all right? Eric! Oh, my God. That's the flare! - They're coming! - We got two minutes. - Ravenwood is coming. Still have to run the trunk line. Eric's out there. There's no time, Jake. Get everybody off the bridge. - Get as far away as you can. - What are you doing? Go! Go now! Go! Come on, guys! Come on! Everybody off the bridge! Get as far away as you can! We're gonna do it! We're gonna blow it! Come on! Not bad. Not bad this time. So I had just... just started my practice. - Been in the country for about six months. - Where? Las Vegas. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. It's a wonderful town. It's really a wonderful place. It's not quite so wonderful without water and electricity. Practically threw myself at the Red Cross to get out. A noble gesture, designed to save my own ass. You did what you had to do. So, they sent me to Kansas, and here I am. I really should be sitting by a pool surrounded by beautiful women. Redheads, preferably. And blondes. Blondes, too. Yeah, smoking a cigar, living the American dream. - I was supposed to be married today. - Really? I was going to be right... right over there. Feet kicked up, having a drink. - Emily! - Yeah? - What do you want to hear next? - Same one. "Polyester Bride" on endless loop? Are you being ironic on your wedding day, Emily Sullivan? If I was being ironic, it would Alanis. And it's Emily Hammond in, like, 30 minutes. Hey, hold on there. We need extra hands, okay? Heather, there's no way I can leave with the bar this busy. - Can you hold the phone up during the wedding so I can hear? - Got you programmed. - Hey, Stanley, when are you getting dressed? - After the game. The wedding is in a half an hour. Oh! Overtime?! Why?! Before we head over to the church I'd like to make a toast to the blushing bride and banker boy. Banker man. Well, it's a banker any way you slice it. Who here would have ever matched Roger with Emily? Talk about high-risk investment. There's nothing risky about him. Exactly. To Emily and Roger. May they live happily together in eternal blandness. Never questioning their life never looking too closely. Never wondering if they weren't meant for something else. Down the hatch, everybody. To the future. Rest in peace. What does he think he's doing? He's making a stand. The bridge is wired. You just parked over a couple of pounds of dynamite. Turn your trucks around or I blow it. We're on government orders to collect food and medicine for a refuge camp near the Rogue River. Same government that ordered you to kill all those people in the hospital? It's been a crazy few weeks. A lot of confusion out there. Just step aside, we'll take what we need and be on our way. Go ahead. give the order. If I go, you go. Is something funny? Yeah, this whole thing. You're not going to push that button. Here's how it's going to go. You and your farmer buddies, you stand down, we get back in our vehicles, we drive into town take what we need and never come back. Nobody has to die. Man down! Man down! You're gonna need a lot more snipers, pal. We got cars coming! Get in positions, now! - Is that Jonah Prowse? - What the hell's he doing here? What's this town worth to you? You know, pretty soon, things are going to start to get back to normal. The government will put itself back together. And they'll be looking to help all of you get back on your feet. And you know who they're going to send? Me. Let's go! Next time you want to destroy my route into town I'd appreciate a head's up. You're welcome. Really. Don't mention it. Can I make a suggestion? Start figuring out how to fight for yourselves. If Eric hadn't come to get me, you'd all be burying Jake in a shoebox tomorrow. So is this how it's going to be? Drunken days, lonely nights, disturbing visions of a dead fiance? Are you...? What? Dead? Would that make it easier? No. I don't know. I don't even know what your voice sounds like, it's been so long. I should have been on the plane with you. You never would have left this place. Ever ask yourself why? Brother, mother gone. No father to speak of. What is it that keeps you so tied to Jericho? I don't know. I think you do. Em? You okay? - What happens if they come back? - Yeah! - We've got armed sentries posted. - If it comes to it, the bridge is still wired. I still say we take it out now. Well, you're not calling the shots, Gray. - I'm glad to see you up on your feet, Johnston. - Mayor. Now, maybe one of you would like to tell me just exactly who you think is in charge here. If we're hit from the other side, that bridge might be our only line of retreat. Help is on the other side of that bridge. Our people-- the whole world-- is on the other side of that bridge. We destroy that bridge, we've already lost. Everyone here wants this to happen. Including your son. No. Not everyone. You guys come up with a real plan to protect this town, you let me know. - Dad, I think you should... - You hold your tongue. I'm the only one here who was elected. I will not do this. It is as simple as that. Maybe it's time we let the people decide if they still want you making their decisions. Stanley? No, she can't. She can't. You're an idiot. Yeah. She said it's fine with her. Right. I'll be outside. I kind of put you in a bad position out there, huh? Gray used you, son. I hope you see that. Dad, you didn't see what those guys are capable of. - But I'm not here to fight. - What are you here for? We need a security force. A real one. Trained. Sanctioned by you. This belonged to your grandfather. He had it on him when he landed at D-day. When he had to take command of his platoon, that manual and his training got him from Omaha Beach into Germany. I remember the story. Make sure you do it right. I'm not coming home tonight. I'll stop by tomorrow and pack some clothes. - Look, Mom, April... - Will have a home with us as long as she wants one. Thanks, Jimmy. We did good today. No. No, we just got lucky. Emily? Is everything all right? Yeah. I saw Heather. She's pretty wasted. I've been a little over-served myself. I know what today is. My mom, she still has the invitation on the fridge. You know, we never talked about him. About Roger. What do you want to know? How did he propose? Cristal and caviar. Beats the hell out of malt liquor in a video store parking lot. We were teenagers. What the hell did we know? Knew enough not to go through with it. Why did you come back, Jake? Hmm? Why couldn't you have just stayed away?
