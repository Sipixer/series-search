- I'm a whole new level of freak! - Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals To free lucifer from hell. And why would an angel rescue me from hell? Because we have work for you. She's no nurse. She's Lilith's personal chef. Sucking blood? You got to know that's wrong. I wish to god i could stop. You give yourself over wholly to the service of god and his angels? Yes. I swear. You're an angel, aren't you? I'm zachariah. This man is a prophet of the lord. I'm not drinking the demon blood for kicks. She's poison, Sam! Look what she did to you! You walk out that door, don't you ever come back. Our father who art in... Heaven... Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, blah, blah, blah. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us... from evil. Truer words never spoken, huh, sisters? But sometimes it seems as if it's difficult to know the creator. Sometimes i feel in a very literal sense... That i have been wandering the desert for years. Looking for our father. Well, not our father. My father, see, he's in jail. Your dad put him there. I almost gave up hope. But "ye of little faith"... Because i finally found him or at least, the spot where his cage door opens. It's right here. In a damn convent, for god's sake. - Life is funny. - Father? Shut your friggin'pie hole, you little slut! Then again, i suppose it makes sense. Folks forget my... daddy is an angel, after all. Or was. I mean, i suppose some dumb bastard stood here, felt a jolt of his holy juice, and thought, "i'm gonna build me a nun factory." Well... It's the right idea... Wrong angel. So... If any of you gals are the praying type. Now would be a good time to start. Sam? Your head in the game, here? I'm good. Let's go. You okay? I just said i was. Look, i know hand-holding really isn't my thing. But still, Dean was wrong saying what he said to you. No, he was right to say it. I don't blame him, after what i did. After we're done, you guys will patch things up. - You always do. - You're talking like i got an "after." Don't say that. I can feel it inside me, Ruby. I've changed. For good. There's no going back now. I know what i got to do. It's okay. I'm just saying. Dean's better off as far away from me as possible. Anyway, doesn't matter. Let's just get this done with. Dean? Dean. - You listen to a word i said? - Yeah, i heard you. I'm not calling him. Don't make me get my gun, boy. We are damn near kickoff for armageddon. Don't you think we got bigger fish at the moment? I know you're pissed and i'm not making apologies for what he's done, - But he's your... - Blood? He's my blood is that what you're gonna say? He's your brother, and he's drowning. Bobby, i tried to help him. I did. - Look what happened. - So try again. It's too late. - There's no such thing. - No! Damn it! We got to face the facts... Sam never wanted part of this family. He hated this life growing up. Ran away to stanford first chance he got. And now it's like déjà vu all over again. Well, i am sick and tired of chasing him. Screw him. He can do what he wants. - You don't mean that. - Yes, i do, Bobby. Sam's gone. He's gone. I'm not even sure if he's still my brother anymore. If he ever was. You stupid, stupid son of a bitch! Well, boohoo! I am so sorry your feelings are hurt, princess! Are you under the impression that family's supposed to make you feel good, bake you an apple pie, maybe? They're supposed to make you miserable! - That's why they're family! - I told him, "you walk out that door, don't come back," and he walked out anyway. - That was his choice! - You sound like a whiny brat. You sound like your dad. Well, let me tell you something... Your dad was a coward. My dad was a lot of things, Bobby, but a coward? He'd rather push Sam away than reach out to him. Well, that don't strike me as brave. You... are a better man than your daddy ever was. So you do both of us a favor... don't be him. Hello, Dean. It's almost time. We're gonna take you to the nursery, sugar. Let mommy and daddy get some sleep. He's a beautiful child. Absolutely scrumptious. Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man bake me a cake as fast as you can pat it and roll it and mark it with a "b" and put it in the oven... So, we need to talk. Hello, Dean. You're looking fit. Well, how'bout this? "The suite life of zack and cass." It's a... Never mind. So, what is this? Where the hell am i? Call it a greenroom. We're closing in on the grand finale, here. We want to keep you safe before showtime. Try a burger. They're your favorite. From that seaside shack in delaware. You were 11, i think. - I'm not hungry. - No? How about ginger from season 2 of "gilligan's island"? You do have a thing for her, don't you? Tempting. - Weird. - We'll throw in mary ann for free. No, no. Let's... bail on the holodeck, okay? I want to know what the game plan is. Let us worry about that. We want you... focused, relaxed. I'm about to be pissed and leaving, so start talking, chuckles. All the seals have fallen. Except one. That's an impressive score. That's... That's right up there with the washington generals. You think sarcasm's appropriate, do you? Considering... You started all this? But the final seal... ... it'll be different. Why? Lilith has to break it. She's the only one who can. - Tomorrow night, midnight. - Where? - We're working on it. - Work harder. We'll do our job. You just make sure you do yours. And what is that, exactly? If i'm supposed to be the one that stops her, how? With the knife? - All in good time. - Isn't now a good time? - Have faith. - What, in you? Give me one good reason why i should. Because you swore your obedience. So obey. - What, no devil's trap? - I don't need one. Look at you, all'roided up. It's like a-rod and madonna over here. - Where's Lilith? - I'm not scared of you. Yeah, you are, actually. And with good reason. What's my upside? Okay, i tell you, you kill me. I don't tell you, you still kill me. I get away somehow, Lilith will definitely kill me. So where's my carrot? I think what you should be worrying about is what happens before you die. Screw it. It's Sam. Leave me a message. Hey, it's me. Look, i'll just get right to it. I'm still pissed... And i owe you a serious beatdown. But... I shouldn't have said what i said. You know, i'm not dad. We're brothers. You know, we're family. And... No matter how bad it gets, that doesn't change. Sammy, i'm sorry... Stop! Stop! Please! - You'll tell me where she is? - Fine. Fine. Just... - let me die. - Deal. Tomorrow night. Midnight. She's gonna be at a convent. St. Mary's, Ilchester, Maryland. - A convent? - Lilith... She's gonna break the final seal. - And what is the final seal? - I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I swear! Ohh, please! I'm begging you, kill me, please! Fine. Wait. You can't. - Why not? - Because we got to take her with us. It's the final run on the death star, and you need more juice than i got. You promised. Sorry, sister. You're a walking, talking can of whup-ass. - You bitch! - I know. Just can't trust anyone these days. Least you won't be able to crack me open that easy. That so? Don't forget, it's not just me you're bleeding. In fact, i think i'm gonna take a little, Siesta in the subconscious... Hand over the wheel for a little bit. - What are you talking about? - Cindy Mccellen, R.N., Come on down! What... Where am i? Oh, my god, i can't move. What's going on? Help! Help me, please. Great. Father, look... I'm not exactly the praying type, but still, i made the sacrifice. I got you a bagful of nuns. So... Can you hear me? Can you whisper through the door? I'm here, my son. It's so good to hear your voice, padre. I have been searching for you for so long. You have no idea. The others have lost faith. Dickless heathens. - But not me. - You've done well. So... - How do i bust you out? - Lilith. Lilith? Father, she's... Trapped neck-deep in the pit. - It won't be easy. - Lilith. Lilith can break the seals. Yeah, okay. - But what do i do? - You must find me a child. A very special child. What do you mean? What child? - You got to be kidding me. - What? Get this. St. Mary's abandoned in'72 after a priest disemboweled eight nuns. What's black and white and red all over? That's not funny. The priest said it wasn't his fault. He said a demon made him do it and that he even remembered the demon's name. - Yeah? - Azazel. So, Lilith, yellow-eyes. All the a-listers are paying visits. Certainly gives the joint credibility. As a place where the final seal goes down. It's good enough for me. Let's pack up nurse betty and hit the road. Hey, maybe... look. - What? - Maybe we can find another demon. Sam, no. That blubbery "don't hurt me" crap, it's just an act. - She's playing you. - I'm not so sure. Even if she's not, there's still a hell-bitch snoozing in there. I mean, come on. It's not like you haven't done this before, right? Just listen to me, okay? My name is Cindy Mccellen. I'm a nurse in the nicu over at Enfield memorial. I have a husband named Matthew, okay? We've been married 6 years. He's got to be worried sick about me. And i don't even know who you are, And i'm not gonna tell anybody anything. Please just let me go. No! Please, no! You asked to see me? Yeah, listen, i need something. Anything you wish. I need you to take me to see Sam. Why? There's something i got to talk to him about. What's that? The B.M. I took this morning. What's it to you? Just make it snappy. I don't think that's wise. Well, i didn't ask you for your opinion. Have you forgotten what happened the last time you met? No. That's the whole point. Listen, i'm gonna do whatever you mooks want, okay? I just need to tie up this one thing. Five minutes... that's all i need. No. What do you mean, no? Are you saying that i'm trapped here? You can go wherever you want. Super. I want to go see sam. Except there. - I want to take a walk. - Fine. I'll go with you. - Alone. - No. You know what? Screw this noise. I'm out of here. Through what door? Damn it. What are you... a 12-year-old girl? Just play it already. Mind your own business. God, i wish she would just shut up. Well, that can be arranged. I don't get it. All the demons you cut with the knife... What do you think happens to the host? How is this any different? Is that supposed to make me feel better? I know that you're having a tough time here, Sam, But we're in the final lap here. Now is not the time to grow a persqueeter. Would you drop the friggin'attitude? I'm about to bleed and drink an innocent woman while she watches. And save the world as a result. I don't know. I just... I'm starting to think... Maybe Dean was right. - About what? - About everything. We're gonna see this through, right, Sam? Sam? Son of a bitch. Quit hurling feces like a howler monkey, would you? It's unbecoming. Let me out of here. Like i told you... too dangerous out there. Demons on the prowl. I've been getting my ass kicked all year. Now you're sweating my safety? You're lying. I want to see my brother. That's... ill-advised. You know, i am so sick of your crap riddles And your smug, fat face. What the hell is going on? Why can't i see Sam? And how am i gonna ice Lilith? You're not. ... going to ice lilith. What? Lilith's going to break the final seal. Fait accompli at this point. Train's left the station. But me and Sam, we can stop... You don't want to stop it, do you? Nope. Never did. The end is nigh. The apocalypse is coming, kiddo, to a theater near you. What was all that crap about saving seals? Our grunts on the ground... We couldn't just tell them the whole truth. We'd have a full-scale rebellion on our hands. I mean, think about it... Would we really let 65 seals get broken unless senior management wanted it that way? But why? Why not? The apocalypse. Poor name, bad marketing... puts people off. When all it is is ali/foreman... On a... slightly larger scale. And we like our chances. When our side wins... and we will... It's paradise on earth. Now, what's not to like about that? What happens to all the people During your little pissing contest? Well... You can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs. In this case... truckloads of eggs, But you get the picture. Look... It happens. This isn't the first planetary enema we've delivered. No, Dean. Probably shouldn't try to bash my skull in with that thing. Wouldn't end up too pleasant for you. What about Sam? He won't go quietly. He'll stop Lilith. Sam... has a part to play. A very important part. He may need a little nudging in the right direction, But i'll make sure he plays it. What does that mean? What are you gonna do to him? Forget about him, would you? You have larger concerns. Why do you think i'm confiding in you? You're still vital, Dean. We weren't lying about your destiny. Just... omitted a few pertinent details. But nothing's changed. You are chosen. You will stop it. Just... not Lilith or the apocalypse. That's all. Which means? Lucifer. You're going to stop lucifer. You're our own little russell crowe, complete with surly attitude. And when it's over... And when you've won... Your rewards will be... Unimaginable. Peace, happiness... 2 virgins and 70 sluts. Trust me... one day, we'll look back on this and laugh. Tell me something. Where's god in all this? God? God has left the building. Howdy. Lady, this is private property. You're not supposed to be here. But i'm here for mass. And so are you. You can't reach him, Dean. You're outside your coverage zone. What are you gonna do to Sam? Nothing. He's gonna do it to himself. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, right, right. Got to toe the company line. Why are you here, Cass? We've been through much together, you and i, And i just wanted to say, i'm sorry it ended like this. "Sorry"? It's armageddon, Cass. You need a bigger word than "sorry." Try to understand... this is long foretold. - This is your... - Destiny? Don't give me that "holy" crap. Destiny, god's plan... It's all a bunch of lies, you poor, stupid son of a bitch! It's just a way for your bosses to keep me and keep you in line! You know what's real? People, families... that's real. And you're gonna watch them all burn? What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion. In paradise, all is forgiven. You'll be at peace. Even with Sam. You can take your peace... And shove it up your lily-white ass. 'cause i'll take the pain and the guilt. I'll even take sam as is. It's a lot better than being some stepford bitch in paradise. This is simple, Cass! No more crap about being a good soldier. There is a right and there is a wrong here, and you know it. Look at me! You know it! You were gonna help me once, weren't you? You were gonna warn me about all this, before they dragged you back to bible camp. Help me... now. Please. What would you have me do? Get me to Sam. We can stop this before it's too late. I do that, we will all be hunted. We'll all be killed. If there is anything worth dying for... This is it. You spineless... Soulless son of a bitch. What do you care about dying? You're already dead. We're done. - Dean... - We're done. Sam, it's time. Are we doing this or not? Give me a minute to think. - Sam... - Give me a damn minute, ruby! Better think fast. First unheard message. Listen to me, you bloodsucking freak. Dad always said i'd either have to save you or kill you. Well, i'm giving you fair warning. I'm done trying to save you. You're a monster, Sam... a vampire. You're not you anymore. And there's no going back. Do it. Thank god. Castiel! Would you mind explaining just what the hell you're doing? He won't be gone long. We have to find sam now. - Where is he? - I don't know. But i know who does. We have to stop him, Dean, from killing Lilith. But lilith's gonna break the final seal. Lilith is the final seal. She dies, the end begins. That sounds... moist. Uh, what are your rates? We can get you one girl, one hour... $1,000. Okay. Then, uh, i'll take 20 girls for the whole night. Um, sir, i'm not sure you can afford that. Lady, sometimes you got to live like there's no tomorrow. - This isn't supposed to happen. - Sir? No, lady, this is definitely supposed to happen, but i just got to call you back. Don't be afraid. We're going to save the world. St. Mary's? What is it, a convent? Yeah, but you guys aren't supposed to be there. You're not in this story. Yeah, well... We're making it up as we go. Aw, man! Not again! It's the archangel! I'll hold him off! I'll hold them all off! Just stop Sam! I've been waiting for this... For a very long time. Then give me your best shot. Sam! Sam! Sam! Dean? What are you waiting for?! Now! Sam, now! You turned yourself into a freak. A monster. And now you're not gonna bite? I'm sorry, but that is honestly adorable. You did it. I mean, it was a little touch-and-go there for a while, but... you did it. What? What... what did i do? You opened the door. And now he's free at last. He's free at last. No, no, no. No, he... Lilith... I stopped her. I killed her! And it is written That the first demon shall be the last seal. And you bust her open. Now guess who's coming to dinner. Oh, my god. Guess again. You don't even know how hard this was... All the demons out for my head. No one knew. I was the best of those sons of bitches! The most loyal! Not even Alastair knew! Only Lilith! Yeah, i'm sure you're a little angry right now, But, i mean, come on, Sam! Even you have to admit... i'm... i'm awesome! You bitch. You lying bitch! Don't hurt yourself, Sammy. It's useless. You shot your payload on the boss. The blood... You poisoned me. No. It wasn't the blood. It was you... and your choices. I just gave you the options, and you chose the right path every time. You didn't need the feather to fly. You had it in you the whole time, dumbo. I know it's hard to see it now... But this is a miracle so long coming. Everything Azazel did and Lilith did just to get you here. And you were the only one who could do it. Why? Why me? Because... because it had to be you, Sammy. It always had to be you. You saved us. You set him free. And he's gonna be grateful. He's gonna repay you in ways that you can't even imagine. You're too late. I don't care. I'm sorry.
