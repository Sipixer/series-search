Lilith was the final seal. I killed her, and I set Lucifer free. Jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what? You're the michael sword. - What do you mean, I'm the sword? - You're michael's weapon. - I'm a vessel? - You're the vessel. Rufus turner. He's a hunter. I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive. Need some help here! - What the hell was that? - An enochian sigil. It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including Lucifer. It was my fault. But Jo did good out there. - You're angry. I understand. - Angry? "Angry" doesn't begin to touch it! Is this about me hunting or something else? You chose a demon over your own brother. I just don't think I can trust you. What's it been... like, three days now? We got to cheer him up. Maybe I'll give him a back rub. What, then? Look... We might have to wrap our heads around the idea That Bobby might not just bounce back this time. What's in the envelope? Went to radiology. Got some glamour shots. Let's just say the doctors are baffled. Holy crap. Yeah, well, Cass carved you one, too. Hello? Castiel? Speak of the devil. St. Martin's hospital. Why? What are you... blue team to I.C.U., please. Blue team to I.C.U. Cellphone, Cass? Really? Since when do angels need to reach out and touch someone? You're hidden from angels now... all angels. - I won't be able to simply... - Enough foreplay. Get over here and lay your damn hands on. Get healing... now. I can't. - Say again? - I'm cut off from heaven and much of heaven's power. Certain things, I can do. Certain things, I can't. You're telling me you lost your mojo just in time To get me stuck in this trap the rest of my life?! I'm sorry. Shove it up your ass. At least he's talking now. I heard that. I don't have much time. We need to talk. Your plan to kill Lucifer. - Yeah, you want to help? - No. It's foolish. It can't be done. - Thanks for the support. - But I believe I have the solution. There is someone besides michael Strong enough to take on Lucifer... Strong enough to stop the apocalypse. Who's that? The one who resurrected me and put you on that airplane. The one who began everything. God. I'm gonna find god. = S05E02 = Supernatural Team - God? - Yes. - God. - Yes. He isn't in heaven. He has to be somewhere. Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla. No, he's not on any flatbread. Listen, chuckles, even if there is a god, He is either dead and that's the generous theory. - He is out there. - Or he's up and kicking And doesn't give a rat's ass about any of us. Look around you, man. The world is in the toilet. We are literally at the end of days here, And he's off somewhere drinking booze out of a coconut. - All right? - Enough. This is not a theological issue. It's strategic. With god's help, we can win. It's a pipe dream, Cass. I killed two angels this week. My brothers. I'm hunted. I rebelled. And I did it... all of it... for you. And you failed. You and your brother destroyed the world. And I lost everything... for nothing. So keep your opinions to yourself. You didn't drop in just to tear us a new hole. What is it you want? I did come for something. - An amulet. - An amulet? What kind? Very rare, very powerful. It burns hot in god's presence. It'll help me find him. A god emf? I don't know what you're talking about. I got nothing like that. I know. You don't. - What... this? - May I borrow it? Dean. Give it to me. All right, I guess. Don't lose it. Great. Now I feel naked. I'll be in touch. When you find god, tell him to send legs! Your belt. Your belt! Here... hold this. Hello? Bobby, damn it, can you hear me? - I can't hear you. - Listen. I need a little help. Seems I'm up to my ass in demons. Whole damn town's infested. Where are you? Pass... rado. Coloro... Colorado? River pass, Colorado? River pass! You there? Bobby, it's... This is the only road in or out. No signal. Rufus was right. Demons got this place locked down. Looks like we're hiking in. And the hits just keep on coming. Hello, boys. Ellen, what the heck's going on here? We're us. Real glad to see you boys. The can of whup ass I ough to open on you. You can't pick up a phone? What are you... allergic to giving me peace of mind? I got to find out that you're alive from Rufus?! - Sorry, ellen. - Yeah, you better be. You better put me on speed dial, kid. Yes, ma'am. What's going on, ellen? More than I can handle alone. - How many demons are there? - Pretty much... whole town, Minus the dead people and these guys. So... this is it, right? End times? It's got to be. Seems like it. It's me. This is Sam and Dean. They're hunters... here to help. You guys hip to this whole demon thing? Yeah. Are you? My wife's eyes turned black. She came at me with a brick. Kind of makes you embrace the paranormal. All right, catch us up. I doubt I know much more than you. Rufus called... said he was in town investigating omens. All of a sudden, the whole town was possessed. - Me and Jo were nearby... - You're hunting with Jo? Yeah, for a while now. We got here, and the place... the place was like you see it. Couldn't find Rufus. Then me and Jo got separated. I was out looking when I found you. Don't worry. We'll find her. Either way, these people cannot just sit here. We got to get them out now. No, it's not that easy. I've been trying. - We already made a run for it once. - What happened? There used to be 20 of us. There's three of us now. You don't know what it's like out there. Demons are everywhere. - We won't be able to cover everybody. - What if we get everyone guns? What... are you gonna arm up baby bump over here? More salt we can fire at once, more demons we can keep away. There's a sporting-goods store we passed on main on the way in. I bet they got guns. All right. You stay. - We'll go. - What about... If Jo and Rufus are out there, we'll bring them back. Hold on. Why don't I just go? What? Alone? Yeah. Somebody's got to stay here and start giving them shotgun 101. It's gonna go a lot faster if you stay and help, okay? While you go get guns and salt and look for Jo and Rufus? - That's stupid. - I can handle it. You don't want me going out there. I didn't say that. - Around demons. - I didn't say that. Fine. Then let's go. I'll get the salt. You get the guns. - We'll go together. - It's right there. Can we at least do this like professionals? Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus. You know your way around a gun at all? Where'd you serve? Fallujah... two tours. Got back a little over a year ago. Takes one to know one. Where'd you serve? Hell. No, seriously. Seriously. Hell. What's wrong? Just... at the store. Those demons were possessing teenagers. I had to slit some kid's throat. - Come on, Sam. You had to. - I know. I just... it used to be... I just wish I could save people, like I used to. What... you mean when you were all hopped up on demon blood? I didn't say that. - I'll be back. - Where you going? I can't sit here on my ass. My daughter's out there somewhere. I'm not back in half an hour, go. Get these people out of here. No, wait. I'll go with you. Hold on. Can I talk to you for a second? You're gonna go out there again? Crap doesn't hit the fan with coffee breaks. I'll go. It's fine. Just stay here, get'em ready. I'll cover ellen. - Why's it got to be you? - Oh, that's right. I forgot. You think I'll take one look at a demon And suddenly fall off the wagon, As if, after everything, I haven't learned my lesson. Have you? If you actually think... So, where'd you see her last? Up ahead. So, what's up with you and Dean? It was hard not to notice... How different things are between you guys these days. Lot of bad road there, huh? What happened? Some girl come between you or something? Just... stresses of the job. You know how it is. Kind of surprised... you and Jo hunting. Weren't you always saying she couldn't hack the life? She can't. But if she's gonna do it anyway... You want to keep an eye on her. - Is that a chimney going? - Looks like it. Come on. Guess we found base camp. Demons don't get cold. Makes you wonder what they're burning. Don't move, you evil skank! Don't you hurt her. Don't you... Give me my mom back, you black-eyed bitch! Ellen! Run! Got you now, you bastard. No way you're getting out of those. Did you up myself. You're stuck right where i want you. You evil son of a bitch. Wait. Just wait. Exorcizamus te. Stop! Omnis satanica. Please! "The lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." "He layeth me down in green pastures," "and he raiseth me up again." "Yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death," "i shall fear no evil. Where's Sam? They took him? Demons took him? Oh, my god. What if they're in here... the demons? - Could they get in? - No. Everybody sit tight. I got to... We need to get a plan together. Tell me everything. Please! Come on! Omnis immundus. Look. Something's not right. Do you see that? Come on! Stop. Listen to me. Wait a second. - Why isn't it working? - I don't know. Listen to me. Something's not right. But he's not as strong as he thinks he is. You can see that. Please. Please. Just listen to me. Dean, one of them's in Jo. We got to get it out without hurting her. It called me a bitch. - Bruise a little easy, don't you think? - No, that's not what i meant. It called me a black-eyed bitch. What kind of demons are these? Holy water and salt roll right off. My daughter may be an idiot, but she's not stupid. She wears an anti-possession charm. It's all kind of weird, right? The whole thing's off. - What's your instinct? - My instinct? My instinct is to call Bobby and ask for help. Or Sam. Well, tough. All you got's me, and all i got's you. So let's figure it out. All right. Do you know why Rufus came to town? Was there a specific omen? He said something about water. That's all i know. Padre, you know what she's talking about the water? The river ran polluted all of a sudden. When? Last wednesday. And the demon thing started up the next day. Anything else? Anything. Maybe. But it's pretty random. Good. Random's good. Shooting star does that count? Real big. Same night, wednesday. That definitely counts. So you think that all this comes from outer space? This isn't "X-Files", pal. "And there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the river, and the name of the star was Wormwood. And many men died." Revelation 8:10. Are you saying that this is about the apocalypse? You could say. And these specific omens they're prelude to what? The four horsemen. And which one rides the red horse? War. That cherry mustang parked on main? You can't think that a car... it's the way i'd roll. I mean, think about it. It all makes sense. If War is a dude and he's here, maybe he's messing with our heads. Turning us on each other. You said Jo called you a black-eyed bitch. They think we're demons. We think they're demons. What if there are no demons at all and we're all just killing each other? Wait just back up. It's the apocalypse? Sorry, padre. Who the hell are you? What are you? You caught me. Popped in to watch. I can hustle like that. So, the Roger everyone around here knows... the real Roger? Buried in a ditch. So, who are you? Here's a hint. I was in germany. Then in germany. Then in the middle east. I was in Darfur when my beeper went off. I'm waiting to hook up with my siblings. I've got three. We're gonna have so much fun together. I know who you are. There aren't any demons in town, are there? Just frightened people ripping each other's throats out. I really haven't had to do too much. Take out a bridge here, lay in a little hallucination there... sit back, pop some corn, watch the show. Frankly, you're really vicious little animals, Sam. - You're doing this. - Please. Last week, this was Mayberry. Now these people are stabbing each other's children. 'cause you made them see demons! Honestly, people don't need a reason to kill each other. I mean, you seen the irish? They're all irish. You think I'm a monster. I'm jello shots at a party. I just remove inhibitions. I'm gonna kill you myself. That's adorable, considering you're my poster boy. What's that supposed to mean? You can't stop thinking about it... Ever since you saw it dripping off the blade of that knife. You're wrong. Save your protests for your brother. I can see inside your head. And, it is one-track city in there. Blood, blood, blood. Lust. For power. Same as always. You want to be strong again. But not just strong. Stronger than everybody. Good intentions... Quick slide to hell, buddy boy. You feel bad now? Wait till you're thigh-deep in warm corpses. Because, my friend, i'm just getting started. Showtime for the meat suits. Watch this. He did it! He said they're coming! He said they're coming to get us! Stop. Jo, Rufus, he's lying. You shut your mouth. Jo! He's lying! So, now you're saying that there are no demons and that War is a guy. You believed crazy before. Open up! Let me in! It's Roger! I saw them... The demons. They know we're trying to leave. They said they're gonna pick us off one by one. - What? - You said there were no demons. There's not. Where did you go? Someone should go out, see what's going on! Where did you see the demons, what did they say? - We just sit here, we're gonna be dead. - No, we're not! - They're gonna kill us... - Unless we kill them first. - Hold on. - No, we got people to protect. The able-bodied go, hunt some demons. Slow your roll. This is not a demon thing. Look at their eyes! They're demons! Hope those are real. Those two could have been demons the entire time. All this salt and holy-water talk... as far as i'm concerned, it's all crap. Are you sure? It's them or us. I think i saw some knives in the kitchen. Great. Go. Hey, Rufus. Pipe bombs won't kill a demon. Right. But in my experience... Demons come at you slower if they're in a body with no limbs. One of them is in my mother. Jo, listen to me. You know i'm gonna do everything i can. Your mom's gonna be okay. Unless she comes through that window. All right, let's move. Stay low. Move fast. Now, you listen up, Joanna Beth Harvelle. Listen to me. I'm not a demon. Think, Rufus. All those omens. You go to hell. The polluted water, the shooting star, the red mustang... It's War. I'm telling you, it's War. You're damn right it is. The horseman! - Horseman? - Yes! He's turning us against each other. You're hallucinating. The horseman. War. Yes. Did you figure this out all by yourself, genius? We all on the same page? Good. Hi, Jo. We got to find War before everybody in this town kills each other. Damn it! Where's Sam? Upstairs. You three go around back. Take the alley. Dean. It's not demons. - It's War. - War. I just can't figure out how he's doing it. The ring. The ring, that's right. He turned it right before he made everybody hallucinate - and go hellbitch. - Right. We got to move. Come on. People, cease fire! Stop shooting! Stop! I'm getting too old for this. I'm not what you think, honey. Come on, keep this right here. "Stop firing" usually means "stop firing." That's a sweet little knife. But come on. You can't kill War, kiddos. We know. So, pit stop on mount doom? - Dean. - Sam, let's not. No, listen. This is important. I know you don't trust me. Just, now i realize something. I don't trust me either. From the minute i saw that blood, only thought in my head... and i tell myself it's for the right reasons, my intentions are good, and it feels true, you know? But i think, underneath... ... i just miss the feeling. I know how messed up that sounds, which means i know how messed up i am. Thing is, the problem's not the demon blood, not really. An, what i did, i can't blame the blood or ruby or anything. The problem's me. How far I'll go. There's something in me that... scares the hell out of me. And the last couple days, I caught another glimpse. So, what are you saying? I'm in no shape to be hunting. I need to step back, 'cause I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best we just... Go our separate ways. I think you're right. I was expecting a fight. Truth is, I spend more time worrying about you than about doing the job right. And I just... I can't afford that, you know? Not now. I'm sorry, Dean. I know you are, Sam. Hey, you... Want to take the impala? That's okay. Take care of yourself, Dean.
