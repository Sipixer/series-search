Winchester! Son of a bitch! - How you doin', corporal? - Hey, Mr. D. Dad? - This is gonna sound a little crazy. - Mary is my mother. - Excuse me? - And I am your grandson. My parents are Mary and John Winchester. I don't know -- Mary gets killed by a yellow-eyed demon. - You don't want those people's souls. - No, I just want their children. Why any of them? I'm gonna stand over their crib, and I'm gonna bleed into their mouths. So, you've been using your freaky E.S.P. stuff? - No. - Sure about that? You didn't want me to go down that road, - so I didn't go down that road. - Well, let's keep it that way. We know what Azazel did to your brother. What we don't know is why. Your brother is heading down a dangerous road, So stop it... Or we will. Where's Lilith? Kiss my ass. I'd watch myself if I were you. Why? Because you're Sam Winchester, Mr. Big hero? And yet here you are, slutting around with some demon. - Real hero. - Shut your mouth. Tell me about those months without your brother... About all the things you and this demon bitch do in the dark. Tell me, hero. How'd it feel? Good. - No more headaches. - None? That is good. I got you. It's all right. So... Anything you want to tell me, Sam? Dean, hold on, okay? - Just let me... - You gonna say, "let me explain"? You're gonna explain this? How about this? Why don't you start with who she is... and what the hell is she doing here? It's good to see you again, Dean. Ruby? Is that ruby? Don't! Ruby, stop it. Well, aren't you an obedient little bitch? Ruby. Ruby... he's hurt. Go. Where the hell do you think you're going? The e.r... unless you want to go another round first. Dean, what are you doing? What, are you... Are you leaving? You don't need me. You and ruby go fight demons. Hold on. Dean, come on, man. You satisfied? I guess not. Do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone? How far from normal? From human? - I'm just exorcising demons. - With your mind! What else can you do? I can send them back to hell. It only works with demons, and that's it. - What else can you do?! - I told you! And I have every reason in the world to believe that. Look, I should have said something. I'm sorry, Dean. I am. - But try to see the other side here. - The other side?! I'm pulling demons out of innocent people. - Use the knife! - The knife kills the victim! What I do, most of them survive! Look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year. That what ruby wants you to think? Kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers? Slippery slope, brother. Just wait and see. Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and god knows where it ends. I'm not gonna let it go too far. It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't know you... ... i would want to hunt you. And so would other hunters. You were gone. I was here. I had to keep on fighting without you. And what I'm doing... It works. Well, tell me. If it's so terrific... Then why'd you lie about it to me? Why did an angel tell me to stop you? What? Cas said that if I don't stop you, he will. See, what that means, Sam -- That means that god doesn't want you doing this. So, are you just gonna stand there and tell me that everything is all good? Hello? Hey, Travis. Yeah, hey. It's good to hear your voice, too. Um, look, it's not a really good time right now. Well, just give me the details, and... Carthage, missouri. Looking for Jack Montgomery. Jack, are you stoned? What? It's good. I'm starving. - Is -- is there dessert? - It just so happens. Hey, babe? Are you gonna finish your steak? You're kidding, right? You've had two already. I don't know. I'm just... hungry. Or you have tapeworm. Please. I never felt better. I can't believe it. Mom... a hunter? I wouldn't have believed it, either, if I hadn't seen it myself. That woman could kick some ass. I mean, she almost took me down. How'd she look? I mean... Was she happy? Yeah, she was awesome. Funny and smart. So hopeful. Dad, too. Until, of course... what? Nothing. It's just... Our parents, and now we find out our grandparents, too? Our whole family murdered, and for what? So yellow eyes could get in my nursery and bleed in my mouth? Sam, I never said anything about demon blood. You knew about that? Yeah, for about a year. A whole year. I should have told you. I'm sorry. You've been saying that a lot lately, Sam. But whatever. You don't want to tell me, you don't have to. - It's fine. - Dean. Whatever. - Hey, babe, when's dinner? - 45 minutes. I'm starving! Jack, a delicious, unmicrowaved, non-takeout,</i> homemade meal is coming. Are you sure that's him? Only Jack Montgomery in town. And we're looking for...? Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird. - Weird? - Yeah. All right, well, yeah, I've seen big weird, little weird, weird with crazy on top. But this guy? I mean, come on, this guy's boring. I don't know, Dean. Travis seemed pretty sure. Honey? I'd say that qualifies as weird. Travis. See, Sam. Told you we should have hid the beer. Smartass. Get over here! Ohh, good to see you. - You too. - Good to see you. You too, Travis. Man, you got tall, kid. How long has it been? Oh, got to be 10 years. You still a -- oh, what was it? A mathlete? - No. - Yep, sure is. Been too long, boys. I mean, look at you... Grown men. John would have been damn proud of you... Sticking together like this. Yeah. Yeah, we're as thick as thieves. Nothing more important than family. Sorry I'm late for the dance. Thanks for helping out an old man. I'm a little, uh, shorthanded. So, you track down Montgomery? Yeah, we found him at his home. And? He had a hell of a case of the munchies, topped off with a burger that he forgot to cook. That's him, all right. What's him? Boys, we got a rougarou on our hands. A rougarou? Is that made up? That sounds made up. They're mean, nasty little suckers -- Rotted teeth, wormy skin, the works. Well, that ain't this guy. He was wearing a cellphone on his belt. He'll turn ugly soon enough. They start out human, for all intents and purposes. So, what, they go through some kind of metamorphosis? Yep, like a maggot turning into a bull fly. But most of all, they're hungry. Hungry for what? At first, for everything, but then... For long pig. - Long pig? - He means human flesh. And that is my word of the day. Hunger grows in till they can't fight it, till they got to take themselves a big, juicy chomp, and then it happens. What happens? They transform completely and fast. I think I need stitches. - I got to go. - What? - I got to get out of here. - Where are you going? Jack?! One bite's all it takes -- Eyes, teeth, skin all turns. No going back, either. They feed once, they're a monster forever. And our man Jack's headed there on a bullet train. How'd you find this guy if he's a walking, talking human? Let's just say it runs in his family. - You mean, uh... - Killed his daddy back in'78. Son of a bitch mangled eight bodies before I put him down. Guy used to be a dentist -- Cadillac, trophy wife. Little did I know, pregnant trophy wife. She put the boy up for adoption. By the time I found out, he was long gone, lost in the system. You mean to tell me you couldn't find someone? I'm not sure I wanted to. The idea of hunting down some poor kid... I don't think i'd have had the heart. Wanted to wait, make damn sure I had the right man. Apparently, I do. One more, please. Can I get some more peanuts? Come on. What are you drinking? It's my treat. No, thank you. Oh, don't be like that. Have a drink with me. - I'm waiting for someone. - Okay, well, where is he? Hey, douche bag. She doesn't want to talk to you. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. I said... She doesn't want to talk to you, you fat... sweaty... dick. You fat... Sweaty... Dick. Now, leave her alone. You, uh, seriously want to do this, guy? You know, I really think I do. So, fire, huh? The only way I found to kill these bastards -- Deep-fry 'em. Well, that's gonna be... Horrible. Is that what you did to Jack's dad? - Not wasting any time, are you? - None to waste. The guy hulks out, we won't be finding bodies, just remains. What if he doesn't hulk out? I did a little homework. I've been checking out the lure on rougarous. What, my 30 years of experience not good enough for you? What? No. No, I-I just wanted to be prepared. I mean, not that you didn't -- Sam loves research. He does. He keeps it under his mattress right next to his k-y. It's a sickness. It is. Everything you said checked out, of course, but... I found a couple of interesting stories about people who have this rougarou gene or whatever. See, they start to turn, but they never take the final step. Really? See, if they never eat human flesh, they don't fully transform. So, what -- Go vegan, stay human? Basically. Or in this case, eat a lot of raw meat, just... - Not... - Long pig. Right. Good on you for the due diligence, Sam. But those are fairy tales. Fact is, every rougarou I ever saw or heard of... Took that bite. Okay, well, that doesn't mean that Jack will. So, what do we do? Sit and hope and wait for a body count? No, we talk to him, explain what's happening. That way, he can fight it. Fight it? Are you kidding me? You ever been really hungry? I mean, haven't-eaten-in-days hungry? Yeah. Right, then. Somebody slaps a big, juicy sirloin in front of you, you walking away? That's what we are to him now -- Meat on legs. I'm sorry. I'm sure he's a stand-up guy. But it's pure, base instinct. Everything in nature's got to eat. You think he can stop himself 'cause he's nice? I don't know. But we're not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for. What's up with your brother? Don't get me started. God. You scared me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you. How are you feeling? I'm feeling pissed, Jack. I had to drive myself to the hospital last night. I was there until 2:00. I'm so sorry. - What happened? - I don't know. I saw your blood, and I-i... got dizzy, and I just had to get out. Well, you could have called. I left you a dozen messages. I know. My phone died. I couldn't find a pay phone. I -- it was a mess. But I am... Sorry. And I promise it won't ever happen again. Certainly... Not to a wife as stunning as you. Better not. I swear, you know. One little cut. Blood's never bothered you before. I've changed. This doesn't get you off the hook, you know. No, no. Think -- think diamond. Think kobe-sized. What has gotten into you? I don't know. Hey, Jack. Just slow down. Jack. Jack, I mean it. Stop. Jack. Ow! Jack! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! You son of bitch. I'm sorry. What the hell is wrong with you? I don't know. I don't know. So we're gonna go have a little chat with this guy, which, you know, I'm down. But I just want to make sure, if push comes, you're gonna shove. Meaning? Well, odds are we're gonna have to burn this guy alive. This guy has a name and a wife. Who we're probably gonna make a widow? You heard Travis. He's gonna turn. - They always turn. - Well, maybe he won't. Maybe he can fight it off. And maybe he can't. That's all I'm saying. - We'll just have to see, then, okay? - This is what I mean, Sam. You sure your emotions aren't getting in the way here? What are you talking about? You know, nice dude, but he's got something evil inside. Something in his blood. Maybe you can relate. - Stop the car. - What? Stop the car or i will. You want to know why I've been lying to you? - Because of crap like this! - Like what? The way you talk to me, the way you look at me like I'm a freak! - I do not. - Or even worse, like I'm an idiot! Like I don't know the difference between right and wrong! - What? - Do you know the difference, Sam? I mean, you've been kind of strolling a dark road lately. You have no idea what I'm going through. None. - Then enlighten me! - I've got demon blood in me! This disease pumping through my veins, and I can't ever rip it out or scrub it clean! I'm a whole new level of freak! And I'm just trying to take this... This curse... And make something good out of it. Because I have to. Let's just go talk to the guy. I mean Jack. Okay? Jack Montgomery? I'm Sam Winchester. This is my brother, Dean. We need to talk. About? About you. About how you're changing. Excuse me? You're probably feeling your bones move under your skin... And your appetite's reaching, you know, hungry hungry hippo levels. How am I doing so far? Who the hell are you guys? We're people who know a little something about something. We're people who can help. Please, just hear us out. A-a what? A rougarou. Sounds made-up, I know, but, believe me, it's not. All right, I've noticed certain things. Some strange things, but I just... I don't know. I'm... I'm sick or something. Your father was one of these things. Your real father. He passed it on to you. No. Are you guys listening to yourselves? - You sound like you're... - Skip the whole "you guys sound crazy," shall we? You're hungry, Jack. You're only gonna get hungrier. - Hungrier for? - Long pig. You know, a little manburger helper may have crossed your mind already. No. It doesn't have to be like this, Jack. You can fight it off. Others have. We're not gonna lie to you, though. It's not gonna be easy. You're gonna feel like an alcoholic swimming around in whiskey. But I'm telling you, you got to say no, - Or... - Or what? You feed once, and it's all over. And then we'll have to stop you. Stop me? My dad... Did, uh, somebody stop him? Yes. Get off my property right now. I see you guys again, I'm calling the cops. Jack, your wife, everybody you know, they're in danger. Now! Good talk. Jack, I don't know where you are, but you're scaring me. Come home. We need to talk. Please? Damn it, Jack, no! Come on. Wait! We're here to save you, I guess. - I'm calling the police. - We should go. Michelle, I'm home. Hey, babe? Are you here? Michelle. Michelle? Okay. We're gonna stay calm. We're gonna give this man whatever he wants. Anything. Just take it and go, please. I'm sorry about this, Jack. I truly am. It's not the way that I wanted it to go. Who are you? You already met some friends of mine. Two brothers? They said that if I... Look, I haven't hurt anybody. Not yet, but you would've. They always do. - I'm doing you a favor, son. - Jack, what's he talking about? Tell her, Jack. Tell her the truth. She deserves to know. Just let her go. She's not a part of this. A part of what? Jack?! I really do apologize, but she is part of it. What? Michelle... Tell him what you told me when I got here. Michelle? I said... "don't hurt me... Because I'm pregnant." J-just hold on a minute. Now you see the mess we're in? I can't make this mistake all over again. I won't be around in 30 years. This has got to end now. I know you don't believe me, but I'd give anything not to have to do this. No. No. No. No. Oh, god. Please don't! You don't have to do this! If you want to kill me, kill me, but not my wife. Okay? - I'm begging you. - Ain't got no choice. My condolences. Jack. Jack! Stay away from me! Michelle. I guess now we know where Travis is. That stupid son of a bitch. Oh, god. Think that's Travis? What's left of him. Guess you were right about Jack. Dean! Dean? Dean can't come to the phone right now. Jack! If you hurt him, I swear to god! Calm down! Your brother's alive. But not if you don't calm down! All right, Jack. Listen. Open the door. We can figure this out, okay? We'll have ourselves a little brainstorming session. Jack, please. I don't think so. After what you did? What? What are you talking about? You sent your friend here. He tried to burn my wife alive! What? Why? He didn't say. I guess psychopaths don't have to explain themselves. Listen to me. You got to believe me. My brother and i, we never would have hurt her, okay? Oh, god, I'm so hungry. Jack, don't do this. I can't ever see my family again. You two... Your friend... You made me into this! No one's making you kill us. Listen to me. You got this dark pit inside you. I know. Believe me, I know. But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it. You don't have to be a monster. Have you seen me lately? It doesn't matter what you are. It only matters what you do. It's your choice. Jack! You did the right thing, you know. That guy was a monster. There was no going back. Sam, I want to tell you i'm sorry. - I've been kind of hard on you lately. - Don't worry about it. It's just that your, uh -- Your psychic thing -- - It scares the crap out of me. - If it's all the Same, I'd really rather not talk about it. Wait a minute. What? You don't want to talk? You? There's nothing more to say. I can't keep explaining myself to you. - I can't make you understand. - Why don't you try? I can't. Because th thing, this blood... It's not in you the way it's in me. It's just something I got to deal with. Not alone. Anyway, it doesn't matter. These powers -- It's playing with fire. I'm done with them. I'm done with everything. Really? Well, that's a relief. Thank you. Don't thank me.
