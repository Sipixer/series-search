Supernatural 306 Agents page and plant, fbi. Gentlemen. What brings you by? We need to see amber greer's body. Really? What for? The police report said something clawed through her skull? You didn't read the autopsy report That i e-mailed out this morning? We had, server issues. When they brought her in, We thought she was attacked by a wolf or something. Or something. But we were wrong. - Is that a... - It's a press-on nail. - We found it in her temporal lobe. - Is that even possible? Wait, are you saying that she did this to herself? She scratched her brains out. It'd take hours, and it'd hurt like hell, - But sure, it's possible. - How? Pick your acronym, ocd, pcp. It all spells "crazy." My guess... some kind of phantom itch. An extreme case, but... - Phantom itch? - Yeah. All it takes is someone talking about an itch... or thinking about one, even... And suddenly you can't stop scratching. Thanks, doc. Okay, now, some of these questions might seem a bit odd, But please just bear with me. Have you noticed any cold spots in the house? - Okay, what about strange smells? - Smells? Whatcha lookin' for? Don't know yet. It's... jimmy, right? So, amber was your babysitter? Yes, sir. Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked. Especially ms. Chancey. She only cared about two things... "dynasty" and bedtime.

Yeah, guy in there... mr. Stanley. He says he saw it, But he's not making a lick of sense. Senile. Thanks. Mr. Stanley? It was just a joke. I didn't know it would really work. What would work? All i did... Was shake his hand. - You ready? - Hit it, mr. Wizard. That'll do, pig. What the hell? That crap isn't supposed to work. This thing doesn't even have batteries. So, what? Are we looking at cursed objects? Sounds good. Maybe there's a powerful witch in town. Is there any link between the, The joy buzzer and the itching powder? One was made in china, the other mexico, But they were both bought from the same store. Welcome to the conjurarium, Sanctum of magic and mystery. You the owner? Yep. You sold any itching powder or joy buzzers lately? Yeah, a grand total of one of each. They aren't exactly big-ticket items. You boys here to buy something or... what? So, you get many customers? Kids come in. They don't buy much, But they're more than happy to break stuff. These days, all they care about are their iphones And those kissing-vampire movies. The whole thing makes me just... Angry? Yeah. Yeah, i am angry. This shop has been my life for 20 years, And now it's wasting away to nothing. - Which is why you hate them. - I suppose. You wish there was something you could do about it. Yeah, i guess i do. So you're taking revenge... ... with this. Something tells me this guy is not a powerful witch. Sorry. Sorry. I'll just slip this tooth under your pillow, And while you're asleep, The tooth fairy will float down And swap it out for a quarter. So some freak is gonna come in my room while i'm sleeping And take my tooth? Sounds scary. No, thank you. Come on. Good night, sweetie. Hold still. You might feel just a little... Pinch. I appreciate that, Nurse... - fremont. - Please... call me "jen." "Jen" it is. What's up with toothless? - Cavity creeps get ahold of him? - Yeah. Close. He wrote up a description... 5'10", 350 pounds, Wings, and a pink tutu. Said it was the tooth fairy. So he's obviously whacked out on painkillers. Maybe. Whatever it was got past locked doors and windows Without triggering the alarm. Come on. The tooth fairy? And it left 32 quarters underneath his pillow... One for each tooth. I will see your crazy and raise you some. There's a couple of kids upstairs with stomach ulcers... Say they got it from mixing pop rocks and coke. Another guy... His face froze that way. What way? He held it too long, and... it stuck. They're flying in a plastic surgeon. If you add all that up... I got nothing. I thought sea-monkeys were real. They are. They're brine shrimp. No, i mean like in the ads. Like the sea-monkey wife cooks the pot roast For the sea-monkey husband, And the sea-monkey kids play with the dog In a sea-monkey castle... real. I was 6, but i believed it. Point is... Maybe that's the connection. The tooth fairy, the pop rocks and coke, The joy buzzer that shocks you... They're all lies that kids believe. And now they're coming true. Okay, so whatever's doing this is reshaping reality. It has the powers of a god. Or... of a trickster. Yeah, with the sense of humor of a 9-year-old. Or you. Dude, seriously... still with the ham? We don't have a fridge. I found something. Here. Tooth fairy attack was here, Pop rocks and coke was here, Then you've got itching powder, face freeze, and joy buzzer... All located within a 2-mile radius. We got a blast zone of weird, And inside, fantasy becomes reality. Looks like. And what's the a-bomb at its center? Four acres of farmland... and a house. Our motel isn't in that circle, by any chance? Yeah. Why? Dude... That's not what i think it is, is it? I got bored. That nurse was hot. You know you can go blind from that, too. Give me five minutes. We'll go check out that house. Do not use my razor! Can i help you? What's your name? Who wants to know? The... ... fbi. Let me see that. What, you guys don't knock? - Are your parents home? - They work. You mind if we ask you a few questions, Maybe take a look around the house? I don't know. Come on. You can trust us. We're the authorities. What's that? It's called soup. You heat it up, and you eat it. Right. I know. It's just... I used to make my own dinner, too, - when i was a kid. - I'm not a kid. Right. No, i know. I'm robert, by the way. Jesse, nice to meet you. Did you draw this? It's the tooth fairy. That's what you think the tooth fairy looks like? Yeah. My dad told me about him. What, didn't your dad tell you about the tooth fairy? My dad? My dad told me different stories. The tooth fairy isn't a story. What do you know about itching powder, jesse? That stuff will make you scratch your brains out. Pop rocks and coke? You mix them, and you'll end up in the hospital. Everyone knows that. - You shouldn't have that. - Why not? It can electrocute you. Actually, it can't. It's just a wind-up toy. It's totally harmless. Doesn't even have batteries. So, it can't shock you? Nope. Not at all. I swear. All it does is just shake in your hand. It's kind of lame. See? What did you say your name was, again? Dude, what the hell? I had a hunch. I went with it. - You risked my ass on a hunch?! - You're fine. We know who's turning this town into willy wonka's worst nightmare. The kid. Everything jesse believes comes true. He thinks the tooth fairy looks like belushi, Joy buzzers really shock people. Boom. That's what happens. But convince him the joy buzzers don't actually work, And they go from killing machines back into crap toys. He probably doesn't even know he's doing it. How is he doing it? Dug up what i could on jesse turner. It's not much. "B" student, won last year's pinewood derby. But get this. Jesse was adopted. His birth records are sealed. - So you unsealed them, and...? - There's no father listed, But jesse's biological mom is named julia wright. She lives in elk creek, on the other side of the state. Whatever you're selling, i'm not interested. We're not salesmen. Agents page and plant, fbi. Put your badge in the slot. Your partner's, too. What do you want? Thank you. We just had a few questions... About your son. I don't have a son. He was born march 29, 1998, in Omaha. You put him up for adoption? What about him? We were just wondering... Was it a... Was it a normal pregnancy? Was there anything strange? - Stay away from me! - Mrs. Wright, wait! We just want to talk! You're not demons? How do you know about demons? I was possessed. A demon took control of my body, and I hurt people. I killed people. That wasn't you. But I was there. I heard a woman beg for mercy. I felt a young girl's blood drip down my hands. That's how you knew about the salt. I picked up tricks. It was in my head for months. - How many months? - Nine. So your son... The whole time. The pregnancy, birth... All of it. I was possessed. The night the baby was born, I was alone. And the pain was... It was overwhelming. I screamed. And it came out a laugh... Because the demon was happy. It used my body to give birth to a child. When it was over, something changed. Maybe the demon was tired or if the pain helped me fight it, but... Somehow, I took control. And the demon wailed inside me. It pounded against my skull. I thought my head was gonna explode. But... I knew. I knew what I had to do. And when I was alone with the baby... Part of me... Part of me wanted to kill it. But, God help me, I couldn't do that. So... I put it up for adoption. And I ran. Who was the father? I was a virgin. Have you seen my son? Is he human? His name's Jesse. He lives in Alliance. He's a good kid. So, now what? We need help. - I take it you got our message. - It's lucky you found the boy. Real lucky. - What do we do with him? - Kill him. This child is half demon and half human, but it's far more powerful than either. Other cultures call this hybrid, cambion or katako. You know him as the Antichrist. That wasn't me. Who put that there? Anyway, I don't get it. Jesse is the devil's son? No, of course not. Your bible gets more wrong than it does right. The Antichrist is not Lucifer's child. It's just demon spawn. But it is one of the devil's greatest weapons in the war against heaven. If Jesse's a demonic howitzer, what's he doing in Nebraska? The demons lost him. They can't find him. But they're looking. They lost him because... Because of his power. It hides him from both angels and demons. For now. So he's got, like, a force field around him. Well, that's great. Problem solved. With Lucifer risen, this child grows strong. Soon, he will do more than just make a few toys come to life. Something that will draw the demons to him. The demons will find this child. Lucifer will twist this boy to his purpose. And then, with a word, this child will destroy the host of heaven. Wait, you're saying that... Jesse's gonna nuke the angels? We cannot allow that to happen. Wait. We're the good guys. We don't just... Kill children. A year ago, you would have done whatever it took to win this war. Things change. Look, we are not going to kill him. All right? But we can't leave Jesse here either. We know that. So... We take him to Bobby's. He'll know what to do. You'll kidnap him? What is going on in this town, it's what happens when this thing is happy. You cannot imagine what it will do if it's angry. Besides, how will you hold him? With a thought, he could be halfway around the world. - So we... - So we tell him the truth. You say he's destined to go dark side. Fine. But he hasn't yet. So if we lay it all out for him, what he is, the apocalypse, everything! He might make the right choice. You didn't. And I can't take that chance. Damn it. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's no worries. You okay? It's just today, a little... Shaky. Talking to the Winchesters will do that to you. Don't you recognize me, sweetheart? We had some great times together, didn't we? And then you stole something from us. Hid it away. That was very, very naughty of you. So we watched, and we waited. And now... They told you where he is, didn't they? I think it's time we go and visit our son. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Mom! Dad! Your mother and father are sleeping. They won't wake until morning. I'm sorry. Was there a guy here? In a trench coat? Was he your friend? Him? I did that. But how? You're a superhero. I am? Who else could turn someone into a toy? You're Superman. Minus the cape and the go-go boots. See, my partner and I, we work for a secret government agency. It's our job to find kids with special powers. We're here to take you to a hidden base in South Dakota. Where you'll be trained to fight evil. - Like the X-Men? - Exactly like the X-Men. In fact, the guy we're taking you to, he's even in a wheelchair. You'll be a hero. You'll save lives, you'll get the girl. Sounds like fun, right? They're lying to you. Stay right there, dreamboat. Can't hurt you. Orders. You, on the other hand? Hurting you's encouraged. Leave him alone! You're beautiful. You have your father's eyes. - Who are you? - I'm your mother. No, you're not. You're half human... Half one of us. She means demons, Jesse! Those people you call your parents, they lied to you, too. You're not theirs. Not really. - My mom and dad love me. - Do they? Is that why they leave you alone all day? Because they love you so much? These people... These impostors, they told you that the tooth fairy was real and that your toys could hurt you and other things that aren't true. They love you so much they made your whole life a lie. Look into your heart, Jesse. You've always known you weren't theirs, you've always known you were different. Everyone has lied to you. They're not FBI agents. And you're not a superhero. - Then what am I? - You're powerful. You can have anything you want. You can do anything you want. Don't listen to her, Jesse! They treated you like a child. Nobody trusted you. Everybody's lied to you. Doesn't that make you angry? See? It does make you angry. But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse. Wouldn't it be better if there were no lies? Come with me... And you can wash it all clean. Start over. Imagine that. A world without lies. She's right, we lied to you. But I'll tell you the truth. I just want... To tell... Stop it. I wanna hear what he has to say. You're stronger than I thought. We lied to you. And I'm sorry. So here's the truth. I'm Sam Winchester. That's my brother, Dean. We hunt monsters. Except when you are the monster. - Right, Sammy? - And that woman right there is Julia. She's your mother. But the thing inside of her, that you're talking to, - it's a demon. - A demon? He's done nothing but lying since you've met him. Don't listen to him. - Punish him. - Sit down and shut up. There's... Kind of a... A war between angels and demons, and... You're a part of it. I'm just a kid. You can go with her if you want. I can't stop you, no one can. But if you do... Millions of people will die. She said I was half demon. Is that true? But you're half human, too. You can do the right thing. You've got choices, Jesse. But if you make the wrong ones, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life. Why are you telling me this? I have to believe someone can make the right choice. Even if I couldn't. Get out of her. How did you do that? I just did. Kid... You're awesome. Is she gonna be all right? Eventually. Look, truth is, he's kind of a buddy of mine. - Could you turn him back? - He tried to kill me. Right. But he's a good guy. He was just confused. It's been a long night. We'll talk about it later. What now? Now we take you some place safe. Get you trained up. You'd be handy in a fight, kid. What if I don't wanna fight? You're powerful. More powerful than... Pretty much anything we've ever seen. - That makes you... - A freak. To some people, maybe. But not to us. We're kind of freaks ourselves. I can't stay here, can I? The demons know where you are, more will come. I won't go without my mom and dad. There's nothing more important than family. We get that. And if you want to take them with you, we'll back your play. But you got to understand... It's gonna be dangerous for them, too. - What do you mean? - Our dad... He would take us with him wherever he went. Where is he now? Dead. A demon killed him. Look, Jesse... Once you're in this fight, you're in it till the end. Win or lose. What should I do? We can't tell you. It's your choice. It's not fair, I know. Can I go see my parents? I need to say goodbye. Sure. He's been up there a long time. He's gone. Where? I don't know. Jesse put everyone in town back to normal. The ones still alive. Then he vanished. What does it say? That he had to leave to keep his parents safe. That he loves them and he's sorry. - How do we find him? - With the boy's powers, we can't. Not unless he wants to be found. You think Jesse's gonna be okay? I hope so. You know, we destroyed that kid's life by telling him the truth. We didn't have a choice, Dean. You know, I'm starting to get why parents lie to their kids. You want them to believe that the worst thing out there is mixing pop rocks and coke. Protect them from the real evil. You want them going to bed feeling safe. If that means lying to them, so be it.
