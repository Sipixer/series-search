just east of here. We might even make pennsylvania faster than we thought. Yeah. Problem is we're not going to pennsylvania. Wait... what? I just got a call from an old friend. Her father was killed last night. She thinks it might be our kind of thing. What? Yeah, believe me, she never would've called, never, if she didn't need us. Come on. You coming or what? By "old friend," you mean... a friend that's not new. Yeah, thanks. So, her name's cassie, huh? You never mentioned her. Didn't i? No. Yeah, we went out. You mean you dated someone? For more than one night? Am i speaking a language you're not getting here? Dad and i were working a job in athens, ohio. She was finishing up college. We went out for a couple weeks. And? Look, it's terrible about her dad, but it kind of sounds like a standard car accident. I'm not seeing how it fits with what we do. Which, by the way, how does she know what we do? You told her. You told her the secret. Our big family rule number one... we do what we do and we shut up about it. For a year and a half, i do nothing but lie to jessica, and you go out with this chick in ohio a couple of times and you tell her everything? Dean! Yeah, looks like. Anderson: It's a newspaper we put out here, not a bulletin for the mayor's office. Get off your soapbox, jimmy. I'm urging a little discretion is all. No, i think you're telling us what you want us to print and what you want us to sit on. I know you're upset, cassie. I liked your dad a lot. But i think your grief is clouding your judgment. Two black people were killed on the same stretch of road in the same way in three weeks. Jimmy, you're too close to this. Those guys were friends of yours. Again, i'm very sorry for your loss. Dean. Hey, cassie. This is my brother, sam. I'm sorry about your dad. Yeah, me, too. My mother's in pretty bad shape. I've been staying with her. I wish she wouldn't go off by herself. She's been snervous and frightened. She was worried about dad. Why? He was scared. He was seeing things. Like what? He swore he saw an awful-looking black truck following him. A truck? Who was the driver? He didn't talk about a driver, just the truck. He said it would appear and disappear. And in the accident, dad's truck was dented like it had been slammed into by something big. Thanks. Now, you're sure this dent wasn't there before? He sold cars, always drove a new one. There wasn't a scratch on that thing. It had rained hard that night. There was mud everywhere. There was a distinct set of muddy tracks from dad's car leading right... to the edge where he went over. One set of tracks... his. And the first person killed was a friend of your father's? Best friend... clayton solmes. They owned a car dealership together. Same thing... dent, no tracks. And the cops said exactly what they said about dad... "he lost control of his car." Can you think of why your father and partner might be targets? No. You think this vanishing truck ran him off the road? When you say it aloud like that... listen, i'm a little skeptical about this ghost stuff or whatever it is you guys are into. Skeptical. If i remember, i think you said i was nuts. That was then. Hmm. I just know that i can't explain what happened up there, so i called you. Mom. Where have you been? I had no idea you'd invited friends over. Mom, this is dean, a friend of mine from... college, and his brother, sam. Well, l-l-l-i won't interrupt you. Mrs. Robinson? Hmm? We're sorry for your loss. We'd like to talk to you for a minute, if you don't mind. I'm really not up to that just now. Dd: Jimmy meant something to this town. He was one of our best. It won't be the same without him. Our best seem to be dropping like flies. Clayton, my father, jimmy. What is it exactly you want me to do? Well, how about closing this section of road for starters? Close the main road, the only road in and out of town? Accidents happen, cassie. That's what they are... accidents. Did the cops check for denting on jimmy's car to see if it was pushed? Who's this? Dean and sam winchester, family friends. This is mayor harold todd. There's one set of tracks... one. Doesn't point to foul play. Mayor, the police and town officials take their cues from you... if you're indifferent about... indifferent? Would you close the road if the victims were white? You're suggesting i'm racist, cassie. I'm the last person you should talk to like that. Why is that? Why don't you k your mother? I'll say this for her... she's fearless. Mm-hmm. Bet she kicked your ass a coupleimes. What's interesting is you guys never really look at each other at the same time. You look at her when she's not looking. She checks you out when you look away. It's just a... just an interesting observation in a, you know, observationally interesting way. You think we might have some more pressing issues here? Hey, if i'm hitting a nerve... oh, let's go. Excuse me. Are you ron stubbins? Friends with jimmy anderson? Who are you? We're with mr. Anderson's insurance company. Just here to dot some i's and cross some t's. We were just wondering, had the deceased mentioned any unusual recent experiences? What do you mean, "unusual"? Well, visions, hallucinations. It's all part of a medical examination kind of thing. What company you say you were with? All tional mutual. Tell me, did he ever mention seeing a truck, a big black truck? What the hell you talking about? You even speaking english? Son, this truck, a big, scary, monster-looking thing? Yeah, actually, i think so. Hmm. What? I have heard of a truck like that. You have? Where? Not where... when. Back in the '60s, there was a string of deaths. Black men. Stores they disappeared in a big, nasty black truck. They ever catch the guy who did it? Never found him. Hell, not sure they even really looked. See, there was a time this town wasn't too friendly to all its citizens. Thank you. Truck. Keeps coming up, doesn't it? I was thinking. You heard of the flying dutchman? Yeah, a ghost ship infused with the captain's evil spirit. It was basically a part of him. So, what if we're dealing with the same thing? A phantom truck who's the extension of some bastard ghost, re-enacting past crimes. The victims have all been black men. I think it's more than that. They all seem connected to cassie and her family. All right, well, you work that angle. Go talk to her. Yeah, i will. Oh, and you might also want to mention that other thing. What other thing? That serious unfinished business. Dean, what is going on between you two? So maybe we were a little bit more involved than i said. Oh, okay, yeah. Okay, a lot more... maybe. I told her the secret about what we do, and i shouldn't have. Look, man, everybody's got to open up to someone sometime. Yeah, i don't. It was stupid to get that close. I mean, look how it ended. Would you stop? Blink or something. You loved her. Oh, god. You were in love with her, but you dumped her. Oh, wow. She dumped you. Get in the car. Get in the car! Dean. Hey. Hey. Come on in. So, you busy? The paper is doing a tribute to jimmy. I was just going through his stuff, his awards, trying to find the words. That's got to be tough. For years this family owned the paper, the dorians. They had a whites-only staff policy. After they sold it, jimmy became the first black reporter. He became editor. He taught me everything. Where's your brother? Not here. All right, so, what brings you here? I'm trying to find the connection between the three victims. By the way, did you talk to your mom about what todd said about not being a racist? I did. She didn't want to talk about it. So, just then, why did you ask where my brother was? Nothing. Not important. Could it be because without him here it'just you and me and not you, me, and sam, which would be easier? It's not easier. Look... no, forget it. It's fine. Keep it strictly business. I forgot you do that. Do what? Oh, whenever we get... what's the word, close?... anywhere in the neighborhood of emotional vulnerability, you back off or make some joke or find any way to shut the door on me. Oh, that's hilarious. See, i'm not the one who took that big, final door and slammed it behind me, and i'm not the one who took the key and buried it. Are we done with this metaphor? All i'm saying is i was totally up front with you back then and you nailed me with it. The guy i'm hoping might be in my future tells me he professionally pops ghosts. Those weren't the words i used. And he has to leave too work with his father. I did. All i could think was, if you want out, fine. But don't tell me this insane story. It was the truth, cassie, it didn't sound so insane the minute you thought i could help. Back then i thought you just wanted to dump me. Whoa, let's not forget who dumped who, okay? I thought it was what you wanted. Well, it wasn't. I didn't mean to hurt you. Well, you did. I'm sorry. Yeah, me, too. Absolutely. Actually, we were always pretty good at fighting. This, we were good at. It's all the other stuff, not so much. Hey, i tried. I told you who i really was. It was a big first for me. Why'd you tell me? I don't know. I guess i couldn't lie to you. Dean... when you told me that story, it scared the hell out of me. I thought you were nuts, dangerous even. Actually... maybe i was looking for a reason to walk away. In my work i see some horrible things, things that can't be explained. I deal with them. But working things out with you? I'm a scary one, all right. Hmm. Well, usually thgs get worked out when you really want them to. Yeah, but i'm still really involved in my dad's work. No more excuses, okay? From you or me. Okay. Yeah you're kidding. And he's with me. Where were you last night? You didn't make it back to the motel. Nope. I'm guessing you guys worked things out. We'll be working things out when we're 90. So, what happened? Every bone crushed, internal organs turned to pudding. The cops are all stumped, but it's almost like something ran him over. Something like a truck? Yep. Tracks? Nope. What was the mayor doing here anyway? He owned the property. Bought it a few weeks ago. Yeah, but he's white. Doesn't fit the pattern. Killings didn't happen up on the road. That doesn't fit, either. Thanks. I'm trying to find some link between those killings in the '60s and what's going on now. There wasn't a lot about it in the paper. Not surprising. Probably minimal-police-work deal. Back then, equal justice under the law wasn't too literal around here. Yeah? Sam: Okay, the courthouse records show that mr. And mrs. Mayor bought an abandoned property. The previous owner was the dorian family, for like 150 years. Dorian? Yeah. Didn't you say the dorian family used to own this paper? Along with most everything else around here. Real pillars of the town. Right, right. That's interesting. What? This cyrus dorian, he vanished in april of '63. The case was investigated but never solved. It was the time the string of murders was going on. Well, i pulled a bunch of paper up on the dorian place. It must've been in bad shape when the mayor bought it. Why is that? The first thing he did was bulldoze the place. Mayor todd knocked down the dorianlace? It was a big deal. One of the oldest local houses left. It made the front page. You got a date? Uh... the 3rd of last month. Mayor todd bulldozed the dorian family home on the 3rd. The first killing was the very next day. Dean! Maybe you could throw a couple shots in that. You didn't see who was driving the truck? It seemed to be no one. Everything was moving so fast. And then it was just gone. Why didn't it kill us? Whatever is controlling the truck wants you afraid first. Mrs. Robinson, cassie said that your husband saw the truck before he died. Mom? Hmm? Martin was under a lot of stress. You can't be sure about what he was seeing. Well, after tonight i think we can be reasonably sure that he was seeing a truck. What happened tonight, you and cassie are marked, okay? Your daughter could die, so if you know something, now would be a really good time to tell us about it. Dean... yes. Yes, he said he saw a truck. Did he know who it belonged to? He thought he did. Who was that? Cyrus... a man named cyrus. Is this cyrus? Cyrus dorian died more than 40 years ago. How do you know he died, mrs. Robinson? The paper said he went missing. How do you know he died? We were all very young. I dated cyrus a while. I was also seeing martin, in secret of course 'cause interracial couples didn't go over too well then. When i broke it off with cyrus, and when he found out about martin... i don't know... he changed. His hatred... his hatred was frightening. The string of murders. There were rumors, people of color disappearing into some kind oa truck. Nothing was ever done. Martin and... martin and i, we were gonna be married in that little church near here, but last minute, we decided to elope 'cause we didn't want all the attention. And cyrus? The day we set for the wedding was the day someone set fire to the church. There was a children's choir practicing in there. They all died. Did the attacks stop after that? No, there was one more. One night that truck came for martin. Cyrus beat him something terrible, but martin... you see, martin got loose and he started hitting cyrus and he just kept hitting him and hitting him. Why didn't you call the cops? This was 40 years ago. He called on his friends... clayton, solmes, and jimmy anderson... and they put cyrus' body into the truck and then rolled it into the swamp at the edge of his land and all three of them kept that secret all these years. And now all three are gone. So is mayor todd. Now, he said that you of all people would know that he is not a racist. Why would he say that? He was a good man. He was a young deputy back then, investigating cyrus's disappearance. Once he figured out what martin and the others had done, he he did nothing because he also knew what cyrus had done. Why didn't you tell me? I thought i was protecting them. And now there's no one left to protect. Yes, there is. Oh, my life was so simple. Just school, exams, papers on polycentric cultural norms. So i guess i saved you from a boring existence. Occasionally i miss boring. So, this killer truck... i miss conversations that didn't start with "this killer truck." Ah... all right, well, this cyrus guy, evil on a level that infected even his truck. When he died, the swamp became his tomb and his spirit was dormant for 40 years. So, what woke it up? The construction on his house or the destructi. Right. Demolition or remodeling can awaken spirits, make them restless. Like that theater in illinois. Yeah. And the guy who tears down the family homestead, harold todd, is the same guy that kept cyrus's murder quiet and unsolved. So now his spirit is awakened and out for blood. I guess. Who knows what ghosts are thinking anyway. You know we're gonna have to dredge that body from the swamp? Maman. You said it. Yeah. Hey. Hey. She's asleep. Now what? You stay put and look after her. And we'll be back. Don't leave the house. Don't go getting all authoritative on me. I hate it. Don't leave the house, please? You coming or what? Sam: All right, let's get her up. All right. Little more. Little more. Litt more. All right, stop. Nice. Hell yeah. Now i know what she sees in you. What? Come on, you can admit it. You're still in love with her. Can we focus, please? I'm just saying, dean. Hold that. All right. What am i getting? Gas, flashlight. Got it, got it. All right, let's get this done. All right. Got it. All right, let's get to it. Think that'll do it? I guess not. So burning the body had no effect on that thing? Sure it did. Now it's really pissed. But cyrus's ghost is gone, right, dean? Apparently not the part that's fused with the truck. Where you going? Going for a little ride. Gonna lead that thing away. That rusted piece of crap, you got to burn it. How the hell am i supposed to burn a truck, dean? I don't know. Figure something out. Figure something... Hey, you got to give me a minute. I don't have a minute! What are we doing?! Uh... let me get back to you. Hey, cassie? Hey, it's sam. Okay, i need some information and it has to be exactly right. All right, dean. This better be good! Where are you? I'm in the middle of nowhere with a killer truck on my ass! It's like it knows i put the torch to cyrus! Dean, listen to me. It's important. I have to know exactly where you are. Decatur road, about two miles off the highway. Okay, headed east? Yes! Oh, you son of a bitch. Okay, uh, turn right. You make the turn? Yeah, i made the turn! Move this thing along a little faster! All right, you see a road up ahead? No! Wait, yes, i see it! Okay, turn left. What?! All right, now what? Go exactly 7/10ths of a mile and stop. Stop? Exactly 7/10ths, dean. 7/10ths, 7/10ths. Dean, are you still there? Yeah. What's happening? It's just staring at me. What do i do? Just what you are doing... bringing it to you. Wh... Come on, come on. Dean? You still there? Dean? Where'd it go? Dean, you're where the church was. What church? The place cyrus burned down and murdered all those kids. There's not a whole lot left. Church ground is hallowed ground whether the church is still there or not. Evil spirits cross over hallowed ground, sometimes they're destroyed. So i figured maybe that would get rid of it. Maybe? Maybe?! What if you were wrong?! Honestly, that thought hadn't occurred to me. "Well, that honestly didn't occur to me." I'm gonna kill him. my mother says to tell you thanks again. This was a better goodbye than the last time. Yeah, well, maybe this time it'll be a little less permanent. You know what? I'm a realist. I don't see much hope for us, dean. Well, i've seen stranger things happen. Hell of a lot stranger. Goodbye, dean. I'll see you, cassie. I will. I like her. Yeah. You meet someone like her, ever make you wonder if it's worth it... putting everything else on hold,
