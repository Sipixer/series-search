Dare. Okay, lame. You have to... say "bloody mary" in the bathroom. Is that the best you can come up with? Who's bloody mary? She's this witch. I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash. It doesn't matter who she is. If you say her name three times in the bathroom mirror, she appears... and scratches your eyes out! So why would anyone say it? Because it isn't real. No turning on the lights. And remember, three times. Bloody mary. This is so stupid. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Scared you. You guys are jerks. Lily? You mind keeping it down? Sorry, daddy. Sorry, mr. Shoemaker. You so like him! Hey, geek. You guys having fun? You're out past curfew. Thanks, dad. Why Sam ? No! - Why Sam? - Sam, wake up. I take it I was having a nightmare? Yeah, another one. Hey, at least I got some sleep. Hey, you know, sooner or later, we're gonna talk about this. Are we here? Yep. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio. So, what do you think really happened to this guy? So what we're gonna find out. Let's go. Hey. Hey. Can I help you? Yeah, we're the... med students. Sorry? Oh, doctor... Fliglavitch didn't tell you? We talked to him on the phone. We're from Ohio state. He's supposed to show us the shoemaker corpse. It's for our paper. Well, I'm sorry, he's at lunch. Oh. Well, he said, uh oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter. You don't mind showing us the body, do you? Sorry, I can't. Doc will be back in an hour. You can wait for him, if you want. An hour? We got to be heading back to columbus. Yeah. Look man, this paper's half our grade, - So if you don't mind helping us out? - Look, man No. I'm gonna hit him in his face, I swear. Follow me. Dude, I earned that money. You won it in a poker game. Yeah. The newspaper said his daughter found him. She said his eyes were bleeding. More than that. They practically liquefied. Any sign of a struggle, maybe somebody did it to him? Nope. Besides the daughter, he was all alone. What's the official causeof death? Doc's not sure. He's thinking massive stroke, maybe an aneurysm. Something burst up in there, that's for sure. What do you mean? Intense cerebral bleeding. This guy had more blooding his skull than anyone I've ever seen. But the eyes? What would cause something like that? Capillaries can burst. See a lot of bloodshot eyes with stroke victims. Yeah, you ever see exploding eyeballs? That's a first for me. But, hey, I'm not the doctor. Think we could take a look atthat police report? You know, for our paper? I'm not really supposed to show you Might not be one of ours. Might just be some freak medical thing. How many times in dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death? Uh, almost never. Exactly. All right. Let's go talk to the daughter. Feel like we're underdressed. You must be Donna,right? Yeah. Hi, uh... We're really sorry. Thank you. I'm sam.This is dean. We worked with your dad. You did? Yeah.This whole thing I mean, a stroke. I don't think she really wants to talk about this right now. It's okay, I'm okay. Were there ever any symptoms? Dizziness, migraines? No. That's because it wasn't a stroke. Lily, don't say that. What? I'm sorry, she's just upset. No, it happened because of me. Sweetie, it didn't. Lily, why would you saysomething like that? Right before he died,I said it. You said what? Bloody Mary, three times in the bathroom mirror. She took his eyes, that's what she does. That's not why dad died.This isn't your fault. I think your sister's right,lily. There's no way it could have been Bloody Mary. Your dad didn't say it,did he? No, I don't think so. Sam:The Bloody Mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing? Not that I know of. I mean, everywhere else, all over the country, kids will play Bloody Mary. And as far as we know, nobody dies from it. Hey well, maybe everywhere it's just a story, but here it's actually happening. The place where the legend began? But according to the legend, the person who says... the person who says you know what gets it But here... Shoemaker gets it instead,yeah. Right. Never heard anything like that before. Still, the guy did die right in front of the mirror. And the daughter's right. The way the legend goes, "you know who" scratches your eyes out. It's worth checking into. What are you doingup here? We... we had to go to the bathroom. Who are you? Like we said downstairs, we worked with Donna's dad. He was a day trader or something, he worked by himself. No, I know, I meant... and those weird questions downstairs, what was that? So you tell me what's going on or I start screaming. All right, all right. We think something happened to Donna's dad. Yeah, a stroke. That's not the sign of a typical stroke. We think it might be something else. Like what? Honestly, we don't know yet. But we don't want it to happen to anyone else. That's the truth. So, if you're gonna scream, go right ahead. Who are you, cops? Something like that. I'll tell you what. Here. If you think of anything, you or your friends notice anything strange, out of the ordinary, just give us a call. All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town. There's gonna be some sort of proof a local woman who died nasty. Yeah, but a legend this wide spread, it's hard. I mean, there's like 50 versions of who she actually is. One story says she's a witch, another says she's a mutilated bride. There's a lot more. What are we supposed to be looking for? Every version's got thingsin common. It's always a woman named Mary, and she always dies in front of a mirror. So we've got to search local newspapers public records as far back as they go, see if we can find a Mary who fits the bill. Well, that sounds annoying. No, it won't be so bad, as long as we... I take it back. This will be very annoying. I'm not sure. They were cops or detectives or something. Whoever they were, they were cute. Jill. You didn't think so? Yeah, okay,they were cute. But, still,do you think something could have happenedto Donna's dad? Maybe Lily was right. Maybe Bloody Mary got him. Very funny. Wait, I'm sorry. Was that fear I hear in your voice? No. Charlie... I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now. Jill, quit it. Oh, no, I can't help myself. I'm gonna say it. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Jill? Jill! You're such a freak. I'll call you tomorrow. You did it. You killed that boy. Why Sam? Why'd you let me fall asleep? 'Cause I'm an awesome brother. So, what did you dream about? Lollipops and candy canes. Yeah, sure. You find anything? Oh, besides a whole new level of frustration? No. I've looked at everything. A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine, committed suicide in front of a mirror, and a giant mirror fell on a guy named dave. But, uh... No Mary. Maybe we just haven't found it yet. I've also been searching for strange deaths, in the area, you know, eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing. There's nothing. Whatever's happening here, maybe it just ain't Mary. Hello? And they found her on the bathroom floor. And her-her eyes... they were gone. I'm sorry. And she said it. I heard her say it. But it couldn't be because of that. I'm insane, right? No, you're not insane. God, that makes me feel so much worse. Look... we think something's happening here, something that can't be explained. And we're gonna stop it, but we could use your help. What did you tell Jill's mom? I just said I needed some time alone with Jill's pictures and things. Great. I hate lying to her. This is for the greater good. Hit the lights. What are you guys looking for? We'll let you know as soon as we find it. Hey, night vision. Thanks. Perfect. Do I look like Paris Hilton? So, I don't get it. I mean, the first victim didn't summon Mary, and the second victim did. How's she choosing them? Beats me. I want to know why Jill said it in the first place. It's just a joke. Somebody's gonna say it again. It's just a matter of time. Hey. There's a black light in the trunk, right? Gary Bryman? You know who that is? No. So, Gary Bryman was an 8 year-old boy. Two years ago, he was killed in a hit and run. The car was described as a black toyota camry, but nobody got the plates or saw the driver. Oh, my god. What? Jill drove that car. We need to get back to your friend Donna's house. Linda shoemaker. Why are you asking me this? Look, we're sorry, but it's important. Yeah. Linda's my mom, okay? And she overdosed on sleeping pills. It was an accident, and that's it. I think you should leave. - Donna, just listen - Get out of my house! Oh, my god. Do you really think her dad could have killed her mom? Maybe. I think I should stick around. All right. Whatever you do, don't... Believe me, I won't say it. Wait, wait, wait. You're doing a nationwide search? Yep. The NCIC, the FBI database any mary in the country who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me. But if she's haunting the town, she should have died in the town. I'm telling you. There's nothing local. I check. So, unless you've gota better idea. Why Mary's choosing a victim? It seems like there's a pattern. I know I was thinking the same thing. With mr. Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run both had secrets where people died. Right. There's a lot of folklore about mirrors that they reveal or your lies, or your secrets, that they're a true reflection of your soul, which is why it's bad luck to break them. Right. Right. Yeah, so maybe if you've got a secret, I mean, like a really nasty one where someone died, then mary sees it and punishes you for it. Whether you summoned her or not. Take a look at this. Looks like the same handprint. Her name was Mary Worthington an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I was on the job for 35 years, detective for most of that. Now, everybody packs it in with a few loose ends, but the Mary Worthington murder... that one still gets me. What exactly happened? You boys said you were reporters. We know Mary was 19, lived by herself. We know she won a few beauty contests, dreamt of getting out of Indiana, being an actress. And we know, the night of march 29th, someone broke into her apartment and murdered her, cut out her eyeswith a knife. That's right. See, sir, when we ask you what happened, we want to know what you think happened. Technically, I'm not supposed to have a copy of this. Now, see that there, "t-r-e"? Yeah. I think Mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer. You know who it was? Not for sure. But there was a local man, a surgeon, Trevor Sampson. And I think he cut her up good. Now, why would he do something like that? Her diary mentioned a man she was seeing. She called him by his initial, "T." Well, her last entry, she was gonna tell to his wife about their affair. But how do you know it was Sampson who killed her? It's hard to say. But the way her eyes were cut out, it was almost professional. But you could never prove it? No. No prints, no witnesses. He was meticulous. Is he still alive? Nope. If you ask me, Mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret. But she never could. Where's she buried? She wasn't. She was cremated. What about that mirror?  It's not in evidence lockup somewhere, is it? No. It was returned to Mary's family a long time ago. You have the names of her family by any chance? I mean, you bring these strangers into my house, and they ask me things like that? They were only trying to help. Please, Donna, you have to believe me. What? About bloody mary? Please, I know it sounds crazy. "Crazy" doesn't even begin to cover it. I mean, it's one thing for my sister to believe this crap. She's 12. But you? Think about the way your dad died, okay, and the way Jill died. Okay, so... Bloody Mary. No! Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. See? Nothing happened. Why would you do that? Oh, my god, there really is something wrong with you. Elements that lose electrons become positive ions, which are smaller than other atoms of the same element. Therefore, the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius Charlie! Charlie! Charlie, stop it! What's wrong? Just calm down! - Charlie! - Aah! Let me go! Charlie! Oh, really? Ah, that's too bad, Mr. Worthington. I would have paid a lot for that mirror. Okay, well, maybe next time. All right, thanks. So? So, that was Mary's brother. The mirror was in the family for years, until he sold it one week ago to a store called estate antiques, a store in Toledo. So wherever the mirror goes, that's where Mary goes? Her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow. Isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits? Yeah, there is. When someone would die in a house, people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped. This Mary dies in front of the mirror, and it draws in her spirit. Yeah, but how could she move through 100 different mirrors? I don't know but if the mirror is the source, I say we find it and smash it. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Hello? Charlie? Hey. Hey. It's okay. You can open up your eyes, Charlie. It's okay, all right? Now, listen. You're gonna stay right here on this bed. You're not gonna look at glass or anything else that has a reflection, okay? as long as you do that she cannot get you. But I can't keep that up forever. I'm gonna die, aren't I? No. No. Not anytime soon. All right, Charlie, we need to know what happened. We were in the bathroom. Donna said it. That's not what we're talking about. Something happened, didn't it, in your life. A secret... where someone got hurt? Can you tell us about it? I had this boyfriend. I loved him. But he kind of scared me, too, you know? And... one night at his house, we got in this fight. Then I broke up with him, and he got upset and he said he needed me and he loved me. And he said... "charlie, if you walk out that door right now, I'm gonna kill myself." And you know what I said? I said, "go ahead." And I left. How could I say that? How could I leave him like that? I just... I didn't believe him, you know? I should have. Her boyfriend killing himself, that's not really Charlie's fault. You know as well as I do, spirits don't exactly see shades of gray, Dean. Charlie had a secret, someone died. That's good enough for Mary. I guess. You know,I've been thinking, it might not be enough to just smash that mirror. Why, what do you mean? Mary's hard to pin down, right? And she moves around from mirror to mirror. So, who's to say that she's not gonna just keep hiding in them forever? So maybe... we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it. Well, how do you know that's gonna work? I don't, I'm not for sure. Well, who's gonnasummon her? I will. She'll come after me. All right, you know what? That's it. This is about Jessica, isn't it? You think that's your dirty little secret, that you killed her somehow? Sam, this has got to stop, man. I mean, the nightmares and-and calling her name out in the middle of the night, it's gonna kill you. Now, listen to me. It wasn't your fault. If you want to blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or, hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I'm the one that dragged you away from her the first place. I don't blame you. You shouldn't blame yourself, because there's nothingyou could've done. - I could've warned her. - About what?! You didn't know what was gonna happen. And, besides, all of this isn't a secret. I mean, I know all about it. It's not gonna work with Mary anyway. No, you don't. I don't what? You don't know all about it. I haven't told you everything. What are you talking about? It wouldn't really be a secret if I told you, would it? No. I don't like it. It's not gonna happen. Forget it. Dean, that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it. And you know what? Who knows how many more people are gonna die after that? Now, we're doing this. You've got to let me do this. Well, that's just great. All right, let's start looking. Maybe they've already sold it. I don't think so. That's it. You sure about this? Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. I'll go check that out. Stay here. Be careful. Smash anything that moves. Crap. hold on Whoa, guys, false alarm. I tripped the system. Who are you? I'm the boss's kid. You're Mr. Yamashiro's kid? Come on. Come into this one. It's your fault. You killed her. You killed Jessica. Like I said, I was adopted. Yeah. You know, I just I really don't have timefor this right now. You never told her the truth, who you really were. But it's more than that,isn't it? Those nightmares you've been having of jessica dying, screaming, burning you had them for days before she died. Didn't you?! You were so desperateto ignore them, to believethey were just dreams. How could you ignore them like that? How could you leave her alone to die? You dreamt it would happen! Dude. Sammy, sammy! It's sam. God, are you okay? Uh, yeah. Come on, come on. You killed them! All those people! You killed them! Hey, sam? Yeah? That's got to be like what, 600 years of bad luck? So this is really over? Yeah, it's over. Thank you. Charlie? Your boyfriend's death, you really should try to forgive yourself. No matter what you did, you probably couldn't have stopped it. Sometimes bad things just happen. That's good advice. hey, sam? Yeah? Now that this is all over, I want you to tell me what that secret is. Look... You're my brother.
