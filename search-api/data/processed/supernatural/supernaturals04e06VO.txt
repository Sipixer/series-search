I've got demon blood in me, Dean. I'm a whole new level of freak. Wait, it's not Ruby, it's Lilith. Sic him, boy! You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of hell. I can throw you back in. Run! It'll kill you! Synchro : IceFre@k Agent tyler, agent perry, meet frank o'brien. He died of a heart attack, right? Three days ago. But o'brien was 44 years old and according to this, a marathon runner. Everybody drops dead sooner or later. It's why I got job security. Yeah, but frank kicked it here. Now, just yesterday, two perfectly healthy men bit it in maumee. All heart attacks. You don't think that's strange? Sounds like maumee's problem to me. Why's the fbi give a damn, anyway? We just want to see the results of frank's autopsy. What autopsy? The one you're gonna do. First dead body? Far from it. Oh, good. Because these suckers can get pretty ripe. Hey, hand me those rib cutters, would you? Is that from a wedding ring? - I didn't think Frank was married. - Ain't my department. - Any idea how he got these? - You know what? When you drop dead, you actually tend to drop. Body probably got scraped up when it hit the ground. What? I-I can't find any blockages in any of the major arteries. Heart looks pretty damn healthy. Hold that a second, would you? Oh, sorry. Spleen juice. Hell's bells, linus, have you seen my -- Who are they? Federal agents. I, uh -- And you kept them waiting? You -- you said not to disturb. Come on back, fellas. Shoes off. Al britton. - Good to meet you. - You too. Thank you. Okay. So... What can I do for uncle sam? Well, we're looking into the death of frank o'brien. We understand some of your men found his body. They did. Me and frank -- We were friends. Hell, we were gamecocks. That's our softball team's name. They're majestic animals. I knew frank since high school. To be honest, I just this morning got up the strength to go see him. Frank was... He was a good man. Yeah. Big heart. Before he died, did you notice frank acting strange? - Maybe scared of something? - Oh, hell, yeah. Real jumpy. - You know what scared him? - No. Wouldn't answer his phone. Finally, I sent some of my boys over to check on him, and, you know the rest. So, why the feds give a crap? You don't really think there's a case here? No, no. It's probably nothing. Just a heart attack. No way that was a heart attack. Definitely no way. Three victims, all with those same red scratches, all went from jittery to terrified to dead within 48 hours. Something scared them to death? All right, so, what can do that? What can't? Ghosts, vampires, chupacabra? It could be a hundred things. So we make a list and start crossing things off. All right, who's the last person to see frank o'brien alive? His neighbor, Mark Hutchins. - Hang on, hey. - What? I don't like the looks of those teenagers down there. Let's walk this way. Tyler and perry. Just like aerosmith. Yeah, small world. So, the last time you saw frank o'brien? Monday. He was watching me from his window. I waved at him, but he just closed the curtains. Did you speak to him recently? Did he seem different? Uh, scared? Oh, totally. He was freaking out. Do you know, uh -- - Do you know what scared him? - Well, yeah, witches. Witches? Like...? "Wizard of oz" was on tv the other night, right? And he said that green bitch was totally out to get him. - Anything else scare him? - Everything else scared him... Al-qaeda, ferrets, artificial sweetener, those pez dispensers with their dead little eyes -- - Lots of stuff. - So, tell me -- What was frank like? I mean, he's dead, you know? I don't want to hammer him, but he got better. He got better? Well, in high school he was -- he was a dick. A dick? Like a bully. I mean, he probably taped half the town's butt cheeks together, mine included. So he pissed a lot of people off. You think anyone would have wanted to get revenge? Well, I don't... - Frank had a heart attack, right? - Just answer the question, sir. I don't think so. Like I said, he got better - after what happened to his wife. - His wife? So he was married. She died about 20 years ago. Frank was really broken up about it. Don't be scared of donny. He's a sweetheart. It's marie you got to look out for. She smells fear. Any luck at the county clerk's office? I'm not sure i'd call it luck. Frank's wife, jessie, was a manic-depressive. She went off her meds back in'88 and vanished. They found her two weeks later, three towns over, strung up in her motel room... Suicide. Any chance frank helped her along to the other side? No, frank was working the swing shift when she disappeared. Airtight alibi. How was frank's pad? Clean. Searched it top to bottom. No emf, no hex bags, no silver. So probably no ghosts, no witches, no demons. - 3 down and 97 to go. - Yeah. Dude, you're going 20. And? That's the speed limit. What? Safety's a crime now? Dude, where are you going? That was our hotel. I'm not gonna make a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. I'm not suicidal. Did I just say that? That was kind of weird. Do you hear something? Am I haunted? Am I haunted?! Yeah, how about it. Keep looking. Dude. Look at this. - I just talked to bobby. - And? Um, well, you're not gonna like it. What? It's ghost sickness. - Ghost sickness? - Yeah. God, no. Yeah. I don't even know what that is. Some cultures believe that certain spirits can infect the living with a disease, which is why they stopped displaying bodies in houses and started taking them off to funeral homes. - Okay, get to the good stuff. - Symptoms are you get anxious... ... and scared, then really scared, then your heart gives out. Sound familiar? Yeah, but, sam, we haven't seen a ghost in weeks. I doubt you caught it from a ghost. Look, once a spirit infects that first person, ghost sickness can spread like any sickness through a cough, a handshake, whatever. It's like the flu. Now, frank o'brien was the first to die, which means he was probably the first infected. Patient zero. Our very own outbreak monkey. Right. Get this... Frank was in Maumee over the weekend. Softball tournament... Which is where he must have infected the other two victims. Were they gamecocks? Cornjerkers. So, ghosts infected frank, he passed it on to the other guys, and I got it from his corpse? Right. So now, what, I have 48 hours before I go insane and my heart stops? More like 24. - Super. - Yeah. Well, why me? Why not you? You got hit with the spleen juice. Yeah, um, you see, bobby and I have a theory about that, too. Turns out all three victims shared a certain, personality type. Frank was a bully. The other two victims -- One was a vice principal, the other was a bouncer. Okay. Basically, they were all dicks. - So you're saying i'm a dick? - No. It's not just that. All three victims used fear as a weapon, and now this disease is just returning the favor. - I don't scare people. - Dean, all we do is scare people. - Okay, then, you're a dick, too. - Apparently, I'm not. Whatever. How do we stop it? We gank the ghost that started all this. We do that, the disease should clear up. You thinking frank's wife? Who knows why she killed herself, you know? What are you doing waiting out here, anyway? Our room's on the fourth floor. It's high. I'll see if I can move us down to the first. - Thanks. - Sure. Everything all right? Oh, yeah. Just peachy. - Find anything? - Yeah. Jessie o'brien's body was cremated, so I'm pretty sure she is not our ghost. Quit picking at that. - How you feeling? - Awesome. It's nice to have my head on the chopping block again. I almost forgot what that feels like. - It's freaking delightful. - We'll keep looking. You okay? Dean. We've been completely ignoring the biggest clue we have -- You. - I don't want to be a clue. - The abrasions, this -- The disease, it's trying to tell us something. Tell us what... Wood chips? Exactly. I'm not going in there. I need backup, and you're all I've got. You're going in, dean. Let's do this. It is a little spooky, isn't it? Oh, I'm not carrying that. It could go off. I'll man the flashlight. You do that. Emf's not gonna work with me around, is it? You don't say. Come on. What -- "To frank. Love, jessie." Frank o'brien's ring. What the hell was frank doing here? No idea. That was scary! Wait. Luther garland. Hey, this is, uh... ... this is frank's wife. Plot thickens. Yeah... But into what? Guess we got the right place. This is the guy on the file. Thanks. Is he... drunk? No. Deputy, according to this, luther garland's cause of death was physical trauma. What does that mean? The guy died 20 years ago -- Before my time. Sorry. Then can we talk to the sheriff? He's out sick today. Well, if you see him, will you have him call us? We're staying at the bluebird. Mind if I take this? Know what? You're awesome. Thanks. Um, y-you too, I guess. Who was that? It, uh -- those fbi guys. What did they want? A file -- Luther garland's. Sheriff? They know. They know. They know what you did, and they're gonna make you pay. This isn't gonna work. Come on, these badges are fake. What if we get busted? - We could go to jail. - Dean, shh! Calm down. Deep breath, okay? There. You feel better? Just come on. Don't scratch. Mr. Garland. Hi. I'm agent tyler. This is agent perry -- FBI. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your brother luther. Let me see some i. D. Certainly. Those are real. Obviously. I mean, who would pretend to be an fbi agent, huh? That's just nutty. What do you want to know? Uh, well... According to this, your brother luther died of physical trauma. You don't agree. No, I don't. Well, then, what would you call it? Don't matter what an old man thinks. Mr. Garland... We're just trying to get the truth on your brother. Please. Everybody was scared of luther. They called him a monster. He was too big, too mean-looking. Just too different. Didn't matter he was the kindest man I ever knew. Didn't matter he'd never hurt no one. A lot of people failed luther. I was one of them. I was a widower with three young'uns, and I told myself there was nothing I could do. Mr. Garland, um... Do you recognize this woman? It's jessie o'brien. Her man, frank, killed luther. - How do you know that? - Everybody knows. They just don't talk about it. Jessie was a receptionist at the mill. She was always real nice to luther, and he had a crush on her. But frank didn't like it. And when jessie went missing, Frank was sure that luther had done something to her. Turns out the old gal killed herself, but frank didn't know that. They found luther with a chain wrapped around his neck. He was dragged up and down the stretch outside that plant till he was past dead. And o'brien was never arrested? I screamed to every cop in town. They didn't want to look into frank. He was a pillar of the community. My brother was just the town freak. You must have hated frank o'brien. I did for a long time, but... Life's too short for hate, son. And frank wasn't thinking straight. His wife had vanished. He was terrified. A damn shame he had to put luther through the same, but... That's fear. It spreads and spreads. Now we know what these are -- Road rash, and I'm guessing luther swallowed some wood chips when he was being dragged down that road. Makes sense. You're experiencing his death in slow motion. Yeah, well, not slow enough, huh? Say we burn some bones and get me healthy. Dean, it won't be that easy. No, no. It'll be that easy. - Why wouldn't it be that easy? - Luther was road-hauled. His body was ripped to pieces. He was probably scattered all over that road. There's no way we're gonna find all the remains. You're kidding me. Look, we'll just have to figure something else out. You know what? Screw this. - Come on. - No, I mean, come on, sam. What are we doing?! - We're hunting a ghost. - A ghost -- exactly. Who does that? - Us. - Us? Right. And that, Sam... That is exactly why our lives suck. I mean, come on. We hunt monsters! What the hell?! I mean, normal people, they see a monster, and they run. But not us -- no, no, no. We -- We search out things that want to kill us. Yeah? Huh? Or eat us! You know who does that? Crazy people! We... are insane! You know, and then there's the bad diner food and then the skeevy motel rooms and then the truck-stop waitress with the bizarre rash. I mean, who wants this life, sam? Huh? Seriously? Do you actually like being stuck in a car with me eight hours a day, every single day? I don't think so! I drive too fast, and I listen to the same five albums over and over and over again, a-and I sing along. I'm annoying. I know that. And you -- you're gassy! You eat half a burrito, and you get toxic! I mean, you know what? You can forget it. Whoa, dean. Where are you going? Stay away from me sam, okay? 'cause I am done with it. I'm done with the monsters and -- and -- and the hellhounds and the ghost sickness and the damn apocalypse. I'm out. I'm done. Quit. I looked everywhere for you, dean. How the hell did you get here? Ran. What do we do now? I got less than four hours on the clock. I'm gonna die, sammy. Yeah, you are. You're going back. Back? Downstairs, dean -- hell. It's about damn time, too. Truth is, you've been a real pain in my ass. No! You get out of my brother, you evil son of a bitch! No one's possessing me, dean. This is what i'm going to become. This is what I want to become. There's nothing you can do about it. - Howdy, sam. - Hey, bobby. Hey, thanks for coming so quick. Where's dean? Home sick. Oh, this isn't helping. So, have his hallucinations started yet? Yeah, a few hours ago. How we doing on time? We saw the coroner about 8:00 a. M. Monday morning, so, uh... Just under two hours. What about you? You find anything? This, uh, encyclopedia of spirits dates to the edo period. You can read japanese? Guess so, show-off. Anyway, this book lists a kind of ghost that could be our guy. It, uh, infects people with fear. - It's called a buruburu. - It say how to kill it? Same as usual -- Burn the remains. Wonderful. Uh... is there a plan "b"? Well, the buruburu is born of fear. Hell, it is fear. And the lore says we can kill it with fear. So we have to scare a ghost to death? Pretty much. How the hell we gonna do that? So, just ride out the trip, okay? You're -- you're gonna be fine. We got a plan.</i> What is it? Uh, just a good plan, all right? Hang in there. This is a terrible plan. Yeah, tell me about it. I know I said, "scare the ghost to death," but this? You got a better idea, i'm listening. Sheriff? What are you doing? Why are you looking into luther garland's death? Hey, hey, you're -- you're sick. You're sick. You're sick, all right? Just like me, okay? You got to relax. Frank o'brien was my friend. So he made a mistake. So I didn't bust him. So what? And you're gonna bring me down over that?! No, sir. - Get away from me! - Al, you got to calm down! Step back! Any luck? I don't know what's wrong, bobby. Last time he came right at us. It's almost like he's, uh... Like he's scared. So now what? I guess I got to make him angry. Hey, luther! Come on, luther! Where the hell are you? What are you waiting for? You're going back. It's about damn time, too. Hi, dean. No. No. Yes. It's me... Lilith. Oh, I missed you so much. It's time to go back now. You -- you are not real! What's the matter, dean? Don't you remember all the fun you had down there? You do remember. 4 months is like 40 years in hell. Like doggy years. And you remember every second. You are not real. It doesn't matter. You're still gonna die. You're still gonna burn. Why me? Why'd I get infected? Silly goose. You know why, dean. Listen to your heart. What? Bobby, punch it! So you guys road hawl the ghost? With a chain? Iron chain etched with a spell word. Now, that's a new one. It was what he was most afraid of. It was pretty brutal, though. On the upside, i'm still alive, so... - Go, team. - Yeah. How you feeling, by the way? Fine. You sure, dean? 'cause this line of work can get awful scary. I'm fine. You want to go hunting? I'll hunt. I'll kill anything. He's adorable. I got to get out of here. You boys drive safe. You too, bobby. Hey, thanks. So, uh... So, what did you see? Near the end, I mean. Oh, besides a cop beating my ass? Seriously. Howler monkeys. Whole roomful of them. - Those things creep the hell out of me.
