The family business. THEN Today's your lucky day,kid. - You watch out for sammy,okay? - Yeah,dad. You know I will. Dad. Time of death -- 10:41 A.M. I miss him,man,and I'm not all right. Neither are you. I'm dealing with dad's death! Dad's dead,and it hurts so bad, you can't take it. I'm okay! I swear,the next person who asks if I'm okay, I'm gonna start throwing punches. NOW Okay,we got booze... we got chocolate... and...wait for it. Tortured emo rock. Guaranteed cure for any broken heart. You didn't have to do all this. I'm fine. Yeah,I can see that. Thanks,neal. You're a good friend. It's probably him. I'll take care of it. Where is she? Chill out and think about this,okay? - I need to talk to her. - Some other time. You get out of my face now. Angela? Leave...me...alone. Angela,I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're sorry? Oh,that's great. Angela,listen to me. I don't want to listen to you! - I'm done listening! - Listen to me. How could you do this? I loved you. Angela? Angela! -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> SUPERNATURAL Season 02 Episode 04</font> Come on,sam. I'm begging you. This is stupid. Why? Going to visit mom's grave? She doesn't even have a grave. There was no body left after the fire. She has a headstone. Put up by our uncle, a man that we've never met. You want to pay your respects to a slab of granite put up by a stranger. - That's not the point. - Then enlighten me. It's not about a body or a casket. It's about her memory, okay? And after dad,it just -- it just feels like the right thing to do. It's irrational is what it is. Look,man, no one asked you to come. Why don't we swing by the roadhouse instead? We haven't heard anything on the demon lately. We should be hunting that son of a bitch down. That's a good idea. You should. Just drop me off,I'll hitch a ride, and I'll meet you there tomorrow. Right. Stuck with those people, making awkward small talk until you show up. No,thanks. CHILDREN SHOULDN`T PALY WITH DEAD THINGS I think,uh... I think dad would have wanted you to have these. I love you,mom. Thank you. Angela mason. She was a student at the local college. Her funeral was three days ago. And? And? You saw her grave -- everything dead around it in a perfect circle. You don't think that's a little weird? Maybe the grounds keeper went a little agro with the pesticide. No,I asked him. No pesticide,no chemicals. Nobody can explain it. Okay, so,what are you thinking? I don't know. Unholy ground,maybe. what? If something evil happened,it could easily poison the ground. Remember the farm outside of cedar rapids? Yeah. It could be the sign of a demonic presence... ...or the angela girl's spirit, if it's powerful enough. Well,don't get too excited. You might pull something. It's just stumbling onto a hunt... - here of all places? - So? So,are you sure this is about a hunt,not something else? What else would it be about? Just forget it. Believe what you want,sam, but I let you drag my ass out here. The least we can do is check this out. Yeah,fine. The girl's dad works in town. He's a professor at the school. - Dr. Mason? - YeS. I'm sam. This is dean. We were friends of angela'S. We -- we wanted to offer our condolences. Please come in. She was beautiful. Yes,she was. This is an unusual book. It's ancient greek. I teach a course. So,a car accident. That's -- that's horrible. Angie was only a mile away from home when... it's got to be hard... losing someone like that. Sometimes it's like they're still around, almost like you can still sense their presence. You ever feel anything like that? I do,as a matter of fact. That's perfectly normal, dr. Mason, especially with what you're going through. You know, I still phone her. And the phone's ringing before I remember that,uh... family's everything, you know? Angie was the most important thing in my life. And now I'm just lost without her. I'm very sorry. There's something going on. We just haven't found it yet. Dean,so far you got a patch of dead grass and nothing. Well,something turned that grave into unholy ground. There's no reason for it to be unholy ground. Angela mason was a nice girl who died in a car crash. That's not exactly vengeful-spirit material. You heard her father. Maybe daddy doesn't know  everything there is to know about his little angel, You know what? We never should have bothered that poor man. We shouldn't even be here anymore. So,what,sam?We just bail without even figuring out what's going on? I think I know what's going on here. It's the only reason I went along with you this far. - What are you talking about? - This is about mom's grave. Got nothing to do with it. You wouldn't step within 100 yards of it. Look,maybe you're imagining a hunt where there isn't one so you don't have to think about mom or dad. You want to take another swing? Go ahead if it will make you feel better. I don't need this crap. Dean,where are you going? I'm gonna go get a drink... alone. - Who the hell are you?! - Wait,wait,wait,wait. Hold on! I'm calling 911! - 'm angela's cousin. - What? Yeah,her dad sent me over to pick up her stuff. My name's alan -- alan stanwick. Her dad didn't say that you were coming. Well,I mean... How else would I have the key to your place? So,I'm sure you got a view of angela that none of the family got to see. Tell me,what was she like? What was she really like? She was great... just...great. I mean,she was so... great. Yeah. Yeah. You two must have been really close,huh? We were. But it's not just her, it's matt. Who? Angela's boyfriend. Right -- matt. Uh,what about him? He killed himself last night. He cut his own throat. Who does that? That'S...terrible. He was taking angela's death pretty hard,and I guess... I mean,he'd been messed up about it for days. Messed up how? He kept saying that he saw her everywhere. Well,I'm -- I'm sure that's normal. I mean,with everything he was going through. He said that he saw her... as in an acid trip or something. Were angela and matt a happy couple? I mean,was there any reason that angela would be angry with him? What? No,of course not. Why do you ask? Just asking. Where did matt live? Next on cinemax, "casa erotica iv," a tale of two latin beauties, Hey. What? Awkward. - Where the hell were you? - Just working my imaginary case. Yeah? And? Oh,well,you were right. I didn't find much. Yeah. Except angela's boyfriend died last night -- slit his own throat, but,you know,that's normal. Uh,let's see. What else? Oh,he was seeing angela everywhere before he died. But,you know,I'm sure  that's just me transferring my own feelings. Okay,I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe there is something going on here. Maybe? Sam,I know how to do my job despite what you might think. We should check out the guy's apartment. I just came from there... a pile of dead plants just like the cemetery. Hell,a dead goldfish,too. - So,unholy ground? - Maybe. I'm still not getting that powerful angry-spirit vibe from angela. I've been reading this, though. - You stole the girl's diary? - Yeah,sam. And if anything, the girl's a little too nice. So,what do you want to do? Keep digging, talk to more of her friends. - You get any names? - You kidding me? I have her bestest friend in the whole wide world. I didn't realize the college employed grief counselors. Oh,yeah. Yeah,you talk,we listen and maybe throw in a little therapeutic collage whatever helps jump-start the healing. Well,I think I'm okay. Thanks. Well,you heard what happened to matt harrison,right? Yeah,I did. We just wanted to make sure you were okay. Grief can make people do crazy things. Look,I'm sorry about what happened to him.I am. But if matt killed himself, it wasn't 'cause of grief. No? Then why? It was guilt. Angie's death was matt's fault, and he knew it. How was matt responsible? She really loved that guy, but the night of the accident, she walked in on him with another girl. She was really torn up. That's why she crashed. Um,look, I got to get ready for work, so thanks for the concern, but,seriously,I'll be okay. Well,my vengeful-spirit theory is starting to make a little more sense. I mean,hell hath no fury. So,if angela got her revenge on matt,you think it's over? Well, there's one way to be sure. Yeah? What's that? Burn the bones. Burn the bones? Are you high? Angela died last week. So? So there's not gonna be bones. There's gonna be a ripe,rotting body in the coffin. Since when are you afraid to get dirty,huh? Ladies first. Hold that. I missed you. They buried the body four days ago. I don't get it. Look. - What is that? - I'm not sure. I've seen these kinds of symbols before. Dean,take it easy,okay? You're angie's friends. - Dr. Mason -- - we need to talk. Well,come in. Thanks. You teach ancient greek. Tell me... what are these? I don't understand. You said this had something to do with angela. It does. Please,just humor me. They're part of an ancient greek divination ritual. - Used for necromancy,right. - That's right. See, before we came over here, we stopped by the library and did a little homework ourselves. Apparently, they use rituals like this one for communicating with the dead, even bringing corpses back to life -- full-on zombie action. Yeah. I mean, according to the legends. Now,what's this all about? - I think you know. - Dean. Look,I get it. There are people that I would give anything to see again, but what gives you the right? - Dean. - What are you talking about? - What's dead should stay dead! - What? - Stop it! - What you brought back isn't your daughter! These things are vicious, they're violent! They're so nasty, they rot the ground around them. I mean,come on! Haven't you seen "pet sematary"? You're insane. - Where is she? - Get out of my house. I know you're hiding her somewhere. Where is she?! Dean,stop! That's enough. Dean,look -- beautiful,living plants. We're leaving. - I'm calling the police. - Sir,we're sorry. We won't bother you again. - What the hell's the matter with you? - Back off. That man is innocent. He didn't deserve that. So she's not here. Maybe he's keeping her somewhere else. Stop it! That's enough,okay? Enough! - Sam,I know what I'm doing. - No,you don'T...at all. I don't scare easy,but you're scaring the crap out of me. Don't be overdramatic, sam. You're lucky this turned out to be a real case, 'cause if it wasn't,you would've found something else to kill. You're on edge, you're erratic, except for when you're hunting,'cause then you're downright scary. You're tailspinning,man, and you refuse to talk about it, and you won't let me help you. I can take care of myself, thanks. No,you can't! And you're the only one who thinks you should have to. You don't have to handle this on your own. No one can. - If you bring up dad's death one more time -- - dean,it's killing you. Please. We've already lost dad. We lost mom. I've lost jessica. And now I'm gonna lose you,too? We better get out of here before the cops come. I hear you,okay? I'm being an ass, and I'm sorry. But we got a freakin' zombie running around. We need to figure out how to kill it. Right? Our lives are weird,man. You're telling me. Come on Honey, is something bothering you? It's about matt. Haven't we already talked about that? I know,but,uh -- haven't we wasted enough time on him already? Come sit down. You always said that he didn't deserve me. - You were right. - Angela... you didn't get out and go see matt or... I've been here the whole time. Neal...you really think I could do something like that? No,I... I don't know. I can't help it. You just -- you seem... different? You're right. I am. I've realized... you're the only one who ever really loved me. You proved that. You brought me back. I'm with you now. Isn't that what you always wanted? We can't just waste her with a head shot? Dude,you've been wahing way too many romero flicks. You're telling me there's no lore on how to smoke them? No,I'm telling you there's too much. There's 100 different legends on the walking dead, but they all have different methods for killing them. Some say setting them on fire. One said -- where is it? Right here -- feeding their hearts to wild dogs. That's my personal favorite. But who knows what's real and what's myth? Is there anything they have in common? No,but a few said silver might work. Silver's a start. But now how are we going to find angela? We got to figure out who brought her back. Any ideas? I think if it's not her dad, it might be that guy,neal. - Neal? - Yep. How'd you come up with that? Well,you got your journal,I got mine. "Neal's a real shoulder to cry on. He so understands what I'm going through with matt." There's more here where that came from. It's got unrequited duckie love written all over it. But that doesn't mean he brought her back from the dead. Hmm,did I mention that he's professor mason's T.A.? Has access to all the same books. Hello? Neal! It's your grief counselors. We've come to hug. Silver bullets? Yeah,enough to make her rattle like a change purse. Unless it's where he keeps his porn. It sure looks like a zombie pen to me. Yeah. An empty one. You think angela's gone after somebody? No,I think she went out to rent "beaches." Look,smartass. She might kill someone. We got to find her,dean. Yeah. All right,she clipped matt because he was cheating,right? Yeah. Well,takes two to,you know, have hard-core sex. I don't know. It just seemed that angela's roommate was... broken up over matt's death. I mean, like really broken up. Hello? Hi,lindsay. I'm home. You know what you did. I'm sorry! I am so sorry! Not sorry enough! God. God. Oh,my god. Oh,my god. I got you. I got you. Damn, that dead chick can run. What now? I say we go have a little chat with neal. So,the silver bullets, they did something,right? Yeah,something,but not enough. What else you got? Um,okay,besides silver, we have "nailing the undead back into their grave beds." It's mentioned a few times. It's probably where the whole vampire-staking lore came from. Their grave beds? You serious? Yeah. How the hell are we gonna get angela back to the cemetery? What are you guys doing here? You know,I've heard of some people doing some pretty desperate things to get laid, but you You take the cake. Okay,who are you guys? You might want to ask angela that question. - What? - We know what you did. The ritual...everything. You're crazy. Your girlfriend's past her expiration date, and we're crazy? When someone's gone, they should stay gone. You don't mess with that kind of stuff. Angela killed matt. She tried to kill lindsay. I don't know what you're talking about. Hey,no more crap,neal! This blood is on your hands. Now,me and him can make this right, but you got to tell us where she is. Tell us! My house. She's at my house. You sure about that? Listen. It doesn't really matter where she is. There's only one way to stop her. We've got to perform another ritual over her grave  to reverse the one that you did. We're going to need some black roots, some scar weed,some candles. It's very complicated, but it will get the job done. She'll be dead again in a couple hours. I think you should come with us. I'm serious,neal. Leave with us right now. No. No. Listen to me. Get out of here as soon as you can. But most of all,be cool. No sudden movements. Don't make her mad. Let's go. You said you'd stay in the house. I'm sorry. I just needed to see you. Neal,please. You have to help me. Oh,god. Come with me to the cemetery. Neal,they're trying to kill me. We have to stop them. You mean kill them? It's true -- - matt and lindsay. - They hurt me. If you love me,you'll make sure nobody hurts me again. Take me to the cemetery, then all this will be over. We can start new lives together. Okay. God help me,but okay. I'll go get the car. Just... just wait here. Neal,you look nervous. No,I'm fine. Were you... going to leave me? No,of course not. You were,weren't you?! How could you?! Neal,I loved you! Angela -- You really think this is gonna work? No,not really. But it was the only thing I could come up with. Wait. It's not what you think. I didn't ask to be brought back, but it's still me. I'm still a person. Please. Please don't! What's dead should stay dead. Rest in peace. Yeah, for good this time,okay? You know, the whole fake-ritual thing, luring angela into the cemetery -- pretty sharp. Thanks. But did we have to use me as bait? I figured you were more her type,you know? She had pretty crappy taste in guys. I think she broke my hand. You're just too fragile. We'll get it looked at later. You want to stay for a while? No. Dean,what is it? I'm sorry. For what? The way I've been acting. And for dad. Well, he was your dad,too. It's my fault that he's gone. What are you talking about? I know you've been thinking it. So have I. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out. Back at the hospital, I had a full recovery. It was a miracle. And five minutes later, dad's dead,and the colt's gone. You can't tell me there's not a connection there. I don't know how the demon was involved. I don't know how the whole thing went down exactly... but dad's dead because of me. And that much I do know. We don't know that, not for sure. Sam... you and dad... you're the most important people in my life. And now... I never should have come back, sam. It wasn't natural. And now look what's come of it. I was dead. And I should have stayed dead. You wanted to know how I was feeling. Well,that's it. So tell me. What could you possibly say to make that all right? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily
