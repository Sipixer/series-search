Look,man,that thingcould come back,all right? Dean,please. What if I'm like her? What if I'm tied upin here someplace? What if all thisis in my head? I mean,it could,you know maybe it gives ussome kind of supernatural acid and then justfeeds on us slow. No,dean,that doesn't make sense,okay? What if that's whyshe keeps appearing to me? She's not a spirit. It's like more and more I'mcatching flashes of reality -- you know, like I'm in heresomewhere,I'm catatonic,and I'm taking all this stuffin,but I can't snap out of it. Okay.Look.Yeah,you're right. I was wrong. You're not crazy,but we needto get out of here fast. I don't think you're real. Did you feel that? You feel this? I'm real. This is not an acid trip.
