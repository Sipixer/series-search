But I can do something. We've got everything we need to build a bomb. - What are we doing? - Hunting a ghost. You know who does that? Crazy people! We are insane! Tomorrow we hunt the devil. This is our last night on earth. Take this thing to Lucifer and empty it into his face. - You know I'd never hurt you. - You listen to me, you son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you myself. - I'm going to rip your heart out! - That's good, Sam. You keep fanning that fire in your belly. All that pent-up rage. I'm gonna need it. The nurses tell me that you're not taking your medication. You want to tell me why? Susan? The pills make me sleepy, but I can't... If I sleep, it'll come. You mean the monster. - Now, we have talked about this. - But it killed Annie. Susan, you're schizophrenic. Your mind plays tricks on you. You get confused. Sometimes you see things. I know what I am. Like I can see my dead son standing right behind you. I know he's not real. But the monster, it is real. Annie was your roommate, and what happened to her was painful for all of us. Perhaps it's easier for you to conjure up a monster than to face how tragic her suicide really was. I can hear it at night. In the walls. Please! You have to believe me. There is no such thing as monsters. Oh, my God! Help me! Help me!! They're starting early tonight. Hurry! It's coming! Help me! = 511 = = Supernatural Team = You were referred to me by a Dr. Babar in Chicago. That's right. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar? I don't know. I don't have any elephant books. Look, doctor, I think that... The doc was in over his head with this one 'cause my brother's... Okay, fine. Thank you. That's not necessary. Why don't you tell me how you're feeling, Alex? I'm fine. I mean, okay, a little depressed, I guess. All right. Any idea why? Probably because I started the apocalypse. - The apocalypse? - That's right. And you think you started it. I mean... I killed this demon, Lilith. And I accidentally freed Lucifer from hell. So, now he's topside, and we're trying to stop him. - Who is? - Me. And him. And this one angel. You mean like an angel on your shoulder? No, his name's Castiel. He wears a trench coat. See, doc? The kid's been beating himself up about this for months. The apocalypse wasn't his fault. - It's not? - No. There was this other demon, Ruby. She got him addicted to demon blood. Near the end, he was chugging the stuff. My brother's not evil. He was just... High. Could you fix him up so we can get back to traveling around the country and hunting monsters? Erma... Cancel my lunch. Dr. Fuller would like to keep you both under observation for a couple of days. - Both? Me too? - Yes, sugar. The doctor thinks that would be best. All right. I'm just gonna give you a little checkup. Look, let's get one thing straight. I've seen Cuckoo's nest, so don't try any of that soul-crushing authoritarian crap on me. Okey-dokey. Go ahead and take down your pants. Wait! What? What for? - How was your silkwood shower? - Okay. Yeah. Good. Good... - Good water pressure. Did the nurse... - She was very thorough. Good, good. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. It's the least we could do. Martin saved dad's ass many times. He's a great hunter. Was. Until Albuquerque. Besides, I just figure it's best we keep busy. Better than what? Nothing. Okay, look... You have been worrying me. Come on, Sam, stop. Ours being in the looney bin doesn't give you the right to head-shrink me. Ellen and Jo dying, it was a freakin' tragedy, okay? - But I'm not gonna wallow in it. - You always do this. You can't just keep this crap in. Watch me. There he is. You boys got big. - You look good. - Thanks. You do, too, Martin. Well, thanks for coming. In the old days, I could've taken care of this with both hands tied behind my back. Well, now... - What do you think we're hunting? - I don't know yet. A ghost, demon, monster. Animal, vegetable, mineral. Hospital's had five deaths in the last four months. Doctors keep calling it suicides, but they're wrong. So you've seen this thing? Has anyone seen this thing? Well, a couple of patients have... ... had glimpses but that's not a lot to go on. - Are they reliable? - Sure. Why wouldn't they be? Gee, I don't know. I know you boys think I'm a bag of loose screws. Well, you wouldn't be wrong. But I wouldn't have called you unless there was something here. I can feel it in my gut. We believe you. Have you checked any of the bodies, found signs of an attack? I don't... I don't go around dead b-bo... B- bodies anymore. Alex, Eddie. Well, I'm glad to see you're making friends. Why don't you and Mr. Creaser join us for group? Please, right this way. Actually, I'm going to be putting you in the afternoon group. What? Why? To be frank, the relationship with your brother seems dangerously codependent. I think a little time apart will do you both good. All right, so, who would like to start us off? Anyone else? All right, Ted. Calm down. I am calm. And I'd very calmly like to talk about the monster that's hunting us. Ted, we're not going to have that discussion again. It's not good for group. I agree. You know what else isn't good for group? - A monster eating all our faces off! - All right, fine. Thank you. - Now, anyone else... - I saw it! - When it killed Susan! - I did too. - It had lobster claws. - It didn't! - It was an alien, like on X-files. - Stop it! Stop helping! Listen to me! - We're all dead! - That's enough! There is no monster. Now, Ted, do you need me to call the orderlies? Or can you behave? Behave. King me! Eddie? I'm Dr. Erica Cartwright. I've been assigned your case. You're my shrink? Lucky me. And you're my paranoid schizophrenic with narcissistic personality disorder and religious psychosis. Lucky me. Can we talk? I've actually got some questions for you. What a coincidence. I've got some for you, too. Well, then, quid pro quo, Clarice. Okay, Hannibal, I'll go first. - How many hours a night do you sleep? - Three or four every couple of nights. What can you tell me about the suicides in here? - They were tragic. - Noticed anything strange? You know, like, I don't know, black smoke, sulfur? No. Why? What's that supposed to mean? Demon signs. I hunt demons, monsters, that kind of thing. - How many drinks do you have a week? - Well, I got to sleep sometime, so... What's seven days, times... Somewhere in the mid-50s. Ever feel any cold spots or get a chill walking through the hospital? - Not that I can remember. If I had? - It means there's a ghost around. When was the last time you were in a long-term relationship? - Define "long-term." - More than two months. Never. - The patients see anything weird? - In here? All the time. Let's talk about your father. - You okay? - I just got "thraped." So, no, I am not okay. Tell me you found something. A guy says he saw a creature. We should talk to him. Back here in an hour? The sooner we take care of this the sooner we can get gone. This place gives me the creeps. I'm Wendy. Maybe this place isn't so bad. Dude... You cannot hit that. Oh, so torn. About time. Nurses are on their rounds. We got 15, 20 minutes. Where's this guy? Room 306. - Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up! - Back off, Dean! - I found something. - What? Right here. Give me a hand. This hole goes all the way through to his brain. What does that mean? Let's find out. Seriously? You might wanna keep watch. - Dude! - Look... His brain's been sucked dry. That's fascinating. Somebody's coming. What are you doing here? Pudding! All right. Come on, you two. Crazy works. Are those original gacys? - I painted those. - Back on point, please. - Whatever this thing is, - Good. it slurpees your brain, sucks you dry. Then it makes the deaths look like suicides. Any ideas? A bad one. What is it? Well, I bet you a chicken dinner it's what we're up against. A wraith. They crack open skulls and feed on brain juice. - You ever tangle with one before? - Never. - Never wanted to, neither. - So how do we kill it? Silver. You so much as touch a wraith with the stuff, and the skin will crackle. Now, that's the good news. The bad news is they can pass as humans. It could be any Peter, Paul, or Mary in the joint. Fantastic. So how do we find it? A mirror. Lore says a wraith will show its true form in a mirror. We just got to spot-check every patient and every staff member. But, I mean, what's it doing in a mental hospital? A nuthouse... It's a perfect captive victim pool. Sure. Who's gonna believe a patient when they say they saw a monster? It's the perfect hunting ground. What's up, doc? You tell me. Hunting. A wraith, actually. Could be anybody. So, I could be a monster? No. You're clean. - Why you? - Why me what? Why do you have to hunt monsters? Why not let someone else do it? I can't find anybody else that dumb. It's my job. Somebody's got to save people's asses. Yours included. So, is there a quota? How many people do you have to save? - All of 'em. - All of them? - You think you have to save everyone? - Whole wide world of sports. How? Whatever you've got, I've heard weirder. It's the end of the world, okay? I mean, it's the damn biblical apocalypse. And if I don't stop it and save everyone, then no one will, and we all die. That's horrible. Tell me about it. I mean, apocalypse or no apocalypse, monsters or not, that's a crushing weight. To feel like six billion lives depend on you. God. How do you get up in the morning? Good question. Hello, Eddie. Doc. All right. I had to raid three nurses' stations to get these. They're only silver-plated, but they should work. Not today, sweetheart. Come on. Keep walking. I want him now. He's larger. You've had worse. Fuller is on call tonight, so we'll hit him after lights out. - All three of us. - What? Martin, we got to get past the security, past the orderlies, and then cut the boss man's throat, okay? It's gonna suck but we could use the backup. No, I can't. - I can't. - We know what happened in Albuquerque. You don't know the half of it. God... I used to be just like you two. I used to think I was invincible. And then... - Well, I found out I'm not. - Martin, you are still a hunter. No, I'm not! I'm useless! Why do you think I checked myself into the hotel California? I'd give anything to help you boys. I would. But I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. He's still in the building. Take the west wing, I'll take the east. Look at his arm! The cut's not burning! It's not him! It's not him. You okay? No, I'm not okay. I am... Awesome! They give you something? They gave me everything. It's spectacu... lacular. You always were a happy drunk. - The doctor wasn't a wraith. - I know. I don't understand, I saw it in the mirror. It wasn't human. Or you're seeing things. Maybe you're going crazy. - I'm not crazy. - Well, come on! You've been at least... Half crazy for a long time. Since you got back from hell... Or since before that, even. And we're in a... We're in a mental hospital. Maybe you finally cracked. You know, maybe... Maybe now you are really, for-real crazy. I made a mistake. That's all. I'll find the thing. I know, I know. It's okay. Look at me. It's okay... Cause you're my brother. And I still love ya. - You missed our session today. - I'm a little busy. - Still hunting that wraith? - People are dying. People die all the time. Look, just let me do my job, maybe save your life? - Not my life that I'm worried about. - Oh, my go... I am fine, okay? I'm fine! Come on. Even you don't believe that. All this pressure you're putting yourself under, all this guilt... It's killing you. You can't save everybody. You can't. Hell, these days, you can't save anybody, Dean. - What'd you say? - The truth, Dean. You got Ellen and Jo killed. You shot Lucifer, but you couldn't gank him. You couldn't stop Sam from killing Lilith, and you broke the first seal. All you do is fail. Did you really think that you, Dean Winchester, with a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude, were gonna beat the devil? Please. The world is gonna burn, and there is nothing you can do. Who are you? How do you know that stuff? - Settle down. - Tell me! I said settle down. Are you... Who is she? Who? - What are you, blind? Her! - Pal, there's nobody there. I'm not real. I'm in your head... Cause you are going crazy. Just leave me alone. You asked to see me? Thanks. I wanted to apologize. I feel horrible about what I did to you. I thought you were a monster. I know that. The question is, why? It doesn't matter. Because after what happened last night, I had a... Moment of clarity. I realized there's no such thing as monsters. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. But honestly? Monsters are the least of your problems. People can learn to live with delusions, but the anger I saw in you. You hurt those two men, and you were going to kill me. The look in your eyes when you came after me... It was like you were barely even human. Like a man possessed. I know. Please... Just... Could you give me a second chance? This isn't a prison. You'll be allowed to go to the day room. Under supervision. Thank you. But if there is one more outburst, I will transfer you to a facility that is equipped to handle violent patients. And believe me, they will be far, far less forgiving. What's wrong? It's not the demon blood, Sam. - It never was. - What? The problem was you. It was always you... The lies, your arrogance, that black spot on your soul. We're all gonna die because of you. - It's all your fault! - You killed us! - Pathetic freak! - You evil son of a bitch! Leave me alone! Stop it! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I didn't do it! Get off of me! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! What's happening? What's happening? Martin, martin, it's me! It's Dean! I'm sorry. You look like hell, boy. - I feel like it, too. - Where's Sam? Lockdown. He went crazy, thank God. - What? - I'm going crazy, too. I'm seeing things, I'm hearing things. We both are. - Crazy's the clue. - What do you mean? - Dean? - Crazy's the clue. You said that! What? The things me and Sam have done, the stuff we've seen... We're gonna end up going guano eventually, probably end up like a couple of drooling nutbags. No offense. None taken. But me and him freaking out on the same day? I mean, it's got to be the... - The monster. - What? Where? No, there's nothing there. Look... What if this thing doesn't just feed on the insane? What if it makes people insane? Is that possible? Does that seem real? Well, I'm not the most reliable source on what is real, but it sounds... Makes sense. Okay, so... so we got infected. something shot us up with crazy. You know, something... Maybe... - Maybe it was the ghost of my dad. - No. Focus on the wraith. - Focus! - Right, the wraith. The wraith. Okay, so the wraith, the wraith... It poisoned us. Maybe with venom, you know, by touch. Or venom, or saliva. Wendy. Wendy! Wendy slobbered all over me and Sam! That's how we got infected! I can't step on the cracks. Is this real? It is, sugar. It's very real. She's still alive! There's two patients in Wendy's room. They attacked me. Dean? Can you hear me? You've got to get out there and kill that thing. I'll take care of her. - I can't. - You have to. You have no choice, son. Dean, run! Run! Let me go! You are far too angry to be out there in the real world. - You! - Of course it's me. I got to say, you hunters don't exactly live up to your rep. I mean, Martin's a wreck. He's harmless. And you and your brother come in here, talking about killing monsters? Kind of made you easy to spot. Then all it took was a touch. And you were mine. I love it in here. This place is my own personal five-star restaurant. Crazy brains... They get soaked in dopamine and adrenaline and just all sorts of hormones and chemicals that make them delicious. And the crazier they are, the better they taste. You did this to me! Well... I helped. But that rage? No, no, no, no. That's all you. I don't make crazy. I just crank up what's already there. You build your own hell. But I give you the legos. And when you're ripe... I make all of your problems disappear. You get away from him! Do you think this is gonna end well for you? But I'm crazy, so what the hell. Still crazy? Nomore than usual. We gotta get outta here. Well, looks like Tom Cruise was right. Shrinks suck. What? Sam, you okay? - The wraith... - What? - She was right. - No, she wasn't. She's dead, okay? Let's hit the road. I need a drink. Or 12. Most of the time I can hide it. But I am angry. I'm mad at everything. I used to be mad at you and dad, then Lilith, now it's Lucifer. And I make excuses. I blame Ruby or the demon blood. But it's not their fault. It's not them. It's me. It's inside me. I am mad... All the time! And I don't know why. Stop it. So what if you are? What are you gonna do, take a leave of absence? You gonna say yes to Lucifer? What? - No, of course not, I... - Exactly. That's exactly what you're gonna do. Take all that crap, and bury it. Forget about it! That's how we keep going. That's how we don't end up like Martin! You with me? Come on, man. Are you with me?
