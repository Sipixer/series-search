Mary ! No ! Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days. I swore I was done hunting. I can't do this alone. No ! We got work to do. This was dad's single most valuable possession. Everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. I think he wants us to pick up where he left off You know, saving people, hunting things, family business. No. I got to find Jessica's killer. It's the only thing I can think about. Sam, You know we're gonna find dad, right ? Yeah. I know. Nervous flyer ? It's that obvious, huh ? You know, what are the odds of dying in a plane crash ? I mean, what 20,000 to one ? Wow. That's, uh, really reassuring. Thank you. Thanks. Miranda, how are you today ? I'm doing just fine, Chuck. Welcome aboard. 15c towards the back of the plane, on the right. Have a nice flight, sir. Oh, I'm counting on it. Um... uh, 11F, - that's the middle of the plane, on... - Thank you ...the left. Excuse me. Do you know how long we've been up ? Oh, uh... about 40 minutes. Wow. Time really does fly, huh ? Excuse me. I've got to stretch my legs. you, what the hell are you doing ?! Morning, sunshine. What time is it ? Huh, It's about 5:45. In the morning ? Yep. Where does the day go ? Did you get any sleep last night ? Yeah, I grabbed a couple hours. You, liar 'cause I was up at 3:00, and you were watching a George Foreman infomercial. Hey, what can I say ? It's riveting tv. When was the last time you got a good night's sleep ? I don't know, A little while, I guess. It's not a big deal Yeah, it is. I appreciate your concern. I'm not concerned about you. It's your job to keep my ass alive, so I need you sharp. Seriously, are you still having nightmares about Jess ? Yeah. But it's not just her. It's everything. I just forgot, you know ? This job. man, it gets to you. You can't let it. You can't bring it home like that. So, what ? All this it... never keeps you up at night ? Never ? You're never afraid ? No, not really. That's not fear. That is precaution. All right, whatever. I'm too tired to argue. Hello ? Dean, it's Jerry Panowski. You and your dad helped me out a couple years back. Oh, all right, yeah, up in kittanning, Pennsylvania, the poltergeist thing. It's not back, is it ? No. No. Thank god, no. But it's something else, and... Well, I think it could be a lot worse. What is it ? Can we talk in person ? Thanks for making the trip so quick. I ought to be doing you guys a favor, not the other way around. Dean and your dad really helped me out. Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist ? Poltergeist ? Man, I loved that movie. Hey, nobody's talking to you. Keep walking. Damn right it was a poltergeist practically tore our house apart. Tell you something if it wasn't for you and your dad, I probably wouldn't be alive. Your dad said you were off at college. Is that right? Yeah, I was. I'm... taking some time off. Well, he was real proud of you. I could tell. He talked about you all the time. He did ? Yeah, you bet he did. Oh, hey, I tried to get ahold of him, but I couldn't. How's he doing, anyway ? He's, um... ...wrapped up in a job right now. Well, we're missing the old man. We get sam. Even trade, huh ? No, not by a long shot. I got something I want you guys to hear. I listened to this. Well, it sounded like it was up your alley Normally I wouldn't have access to this. It's the cockpit voice recorder for united britannia flight 2485. It was one of ours. Mayday√© Took off from here, crashed about 200 miles south. Now, they're saying mechanical failure. Cabin depressurized somehow. Nobody knows why. Over 100 people on board. Only seven got out alive. Pilot was one. His name is chuck lambert. He's a good friend of mine. Chuck is, uh... well, he's pretty broken up about it, like it was his fault. You don't think it was? No, I don't. Jerry, we're gonna need passenger manifests, hum...a list of survivors. All right. And huh... any way we can take a look at the wreckage? The other stuff is no problem, but the wreckage fellas, the ntsb has it locked down in an evidence warehouse. No way I've got that kind of clearance. No problem. Hey Hi. You've been in there forever. You can't rush perfection. Homeland security? That's pretty illegal, even for us. Yeah, well, it's something new, you know? People haven't seen it a thousand times. All right, so, what do you got? Well, there's definitely E.V.P. on the cockpit voice recorder. Yeah? Listen. "No survivors"? What's that supposed to mean? There were seven survivors. Got me. So, what are you thinking? A haunted flight? There's a long history of spirits and death omens on planes and ships, like phantom travelers. Mm-hmm Or remember flight 401? Right the one that crashed, the airline salvaged some of this parts,* put it in other planes, then the spirit of the pilot and copilot haunted those flights. Right. Yep. Maybe we got a similar deal. All rigth so, survivors which one do you want to talk to first? Third on the list Max Jaffey. Why him? For one, he's from around here. And two, if anyone saw anything weird. he did. What makes you say that? Well, I spoke to his mother, and she told me where to find him. I don't understand. I already spoke with homeland security. Right. Some new information has come up. So if you could just answer a couple questions... just before the plane went down, did you notice anything unusual? Like what? Strange lights, weird noises, maybe... voices. No, nothing. Mr. Joffey Jaffey. Jaffey. You checked yourself in here, right? Can I ask why? I was a little stressed. I survived a plane crash. And that's what terrified you? That's what you were afraid of? I... I don't want to talk about this anymore. I think maybe you did see something up there. We need to know what. No. No, I was... delusional seeing things. He was seeing things. It's okay. Then just tell us what you thought you saw, please. There was... this... man. And, uh, he had these... eyes... these, uh... black eyes. And I saw him I thought I saw him... what? He opened the emergency exit. But that's... that's impossible, right? I mean, I looked it up. There's something like two tons of pressure on that door. Yeah... This man, huh... did he seem to appear and disappear. Rapidly.It would look something like a mirage. What are you, nuts? He was a passenger. He was sitting right in front of me. Say here we are George Phelps, seat 20c. Hmm. Man, I don't care how strong you are. Even yoked up on pcp or something, no way you can open up an emergency door during a flight. Not if you're human. But maybe this guy George was something else some kind of creature, maybe, in human form. Does that look like a creature's lair to you? This is your late husband? Yes, that was my george. And you said he was a... dentist? Mm-hmm. He was headed to a convention in Denver. Do you know that he was petrified to fly? For him to go like that... how long were you married? 13 years. In all that time, did you ever notice anything... strange about him, anything out of the ordinary? Well... uh, he had acid reflux, if that's what you mean. I mean it goes without saying. It just doesn't make any sense. A middle-aged dentist with an ulcer is not exactly evil personified. You know what we need to do is get inside that ntsb warehouse, check out the wreckage. Okay. But if we're gonna go that route, we'd better look the part. I look like one of the blues brothers. No, you don't. You look more like a... seventh-grader at his first dance. I hate this thing. Hey. You want into that warehouse or not? what is that? It's an E.M.F. Meter... reads electromagnetic frequencies. Yeah, I know what an E.M.F. Meter is, but why does that one look like a busted-up walkman? That's what I made it out of. It's homemade. Yeah, I can see that. Check out emergency door handle. What is this stuff? One way to find out. Homeland security? What? One team of you guys isn't enough? What are you talking about? Two of your buddies went inside not five minutes ago. These monkey suits do come in handy. Listen Chuck It's like getting back on a horse, only in this case, a little twin engine. Not even a horse more like a pony. I'll be right there with you too. * Anytime you feel like you don't want the wheel, I'll take over. Look, Chuck, we don't have to do this today. I'm not trying to rush you. No, the... the waiting is worse. Okay, they're filling up the tank. Then we go. Huh. This stuff is covered in sulfur. You're sure? Take a look for yourself. "You effin' piece of..." if you fellows will excuse me, I have an idiot to fire. Hmm. Here is not too many things that leave behind a sulfuric residue.* Demonic possession? It would explain how a mortal man would have the strength to open up an emergency hatch. If the guy was possessed, it's possible. This goes way beyond floating over a bed or barfing pea soup. What mean it's one thing to possess a person, but to use them to take down an entire airplane? You ever heard of something like this before? Never. I'm ready. Let's do this. How you feeling? I feel great. You'll be back flying jumbos before you know it. I hope so. How long we been up? Huh... Almost 40 minutes. Wow. Time really does fly. so, every religion in every world culture has the concept of demons and demonic possession, right? I mean christian, native american, hindu. You name it. Yeah, but none of them describe anything like this. Well, that's not exactly true. You see according to japanese beliefs, certain demons are behind certain disasters, both natural and man-made One causes earthquakes. Another causes disease. And this one causes plane crashes? All right, so, what? We have a demonthat's evolved with the times and found a way to ratchet up the body count? Yeah. You know, who knows how many planes it's brought down before this one? What? I don't know, man. This isn't our normal gig. I mean, demons, they don't want anything just death and destructionfor its own sake. This is big. I wish dad was here. Yeah. Me too. Hello? Dean it's Jerry Oh, hey, Jerry. My pilot friend... Chuck Lambert, is dead. Wha... Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened? He and his buddy went up in a small twin. About an hour ago. The plane went down. Where'd this happen? About 60 miles west of here, near nazareth. I'll try to ignore the irony in that. I'm sorry? Nothing. Jerry hang in there, all right? We'll catch up with you soon. Another crash? Yeah. Let's go. Where? Nazareth. Sulfur? Well, that's great. All right, that's two plane crashes involving Chuck Lambert. This demon sounds likeit was after him. With all due respect to Chuck, if that's the case, that would be the good news. What's the bad news? Chuck's plane went down exactly 40 minutes into flight. And get this so did flight 2485. 40 minutes? What does that mean? It's biblical numerology. You know Noah's ark, it rained for 40days. The number means death. I went back, and there have been six plane crashes over the last decade that all went down exactly 40 minutes in. Any survivors? No. Or not until now,at least not until flight 2485, for some reason. And the cockpit voice recorder remember what the E.V.P. Said? "No survivors." It's going after all the survivors. Something finish the job. Really? Well, thank you for taking our survey, and if you do plan to fly, please don't forget your friendsat united britannia airlines. Thanks. All right. That takes care of Blaines Anderson and Dennis Holloway. They're not flying anytime soon. So our only wildcard is the flight attendant amanda walker. Right Her sister Karen said her flight leaves Indianapolis at 8:00. Yeah but it's her first night backon the job. That sounds like just our luck. Dean, this is a 5-hour drive made even with you behind the wheel. Call amanda's cellphone again, see if we can't head her off at the pass. I already left her three voice messages. She must have turned her cellphone off. God,we're never gonna make it. We'll make it. right there. They're boarding in 30 minutes. Okay. We still have some cards to play. We need to find a phone. Airport Services. Hi. Gate 13. Who are you calling, Sir I'm trying to contact an Amanda Walker. She's a flight attendant on flight, um... Flight 424. "Amanda walker," "Amanda Walker, you have a phone call" "white courtesy phone, gate 13." Come on. This is amanda walker. Miss walker. Hi, this is Dr. James Headfield from st. Francis memorial hospital. We have a Karen Walker here. Why Karen? Nothing serious just a minor car accident, but she was injured, so Wa-wait, that's impossible. I just got off the phone with her. You what? Five minutes ago. She's at her house, cramming for a final. Who is this? Uh, well... there must be some mistake. And how would you even know I was here? Is this one of Vince's friends? Guilty as charged. Wow. This is unbelievable. He's really sorry. Well, you tell him to mind his own business and stay out of my life, okay? Yes, but... he really needs to see you tonight, so No, I'm sorry. It's too late. Don't be like that. Come on. The guy's... ...a mess. Really. It's pathetic. Really? Oh, yeah. Look, I've got to go. Um... Tell him to call me when I land. No, no. Wait, Amanda. Amanda! How are you? - Hey, boss. - Hey Damn it! So close. All right, it's time for plan "B." We're getting on that plane. Oh,oh,Now, just hold on a second. Dean, That plane is leaving with over 100 passengers on board, and if we're right, that plane is gonna crash. I know. Okay. We're getting on the plane, we need to find that demon and exorcise it. I'll get the tickets. You get whatever you can out of the trunk. * security. Meet me back here in five minutes. Are you okay? No, not really. What? What's wrong? Well, I kind of have this problem with, uh... flying? It's never really been an issue until now. You're joking, right? Do I look like I'm joking? Why do you think I drive everywhere, sam? All right. Uh, I'll go. What? I'll do this oneon my own. Are you, nuts? You said that the plane's gonna crash. Dean, we can do it together, or I can do this for myself. I'm not seeing a third option, here. Come on! Really? Man... - Just try to relax. - Just try to shut up. You're humming Metallica? Calms me down. Look, man, I get you're nervous, all right? But you got to stay focused. Okay. I mean, we got 32 minutes and counting to track this thing down or who Everit's possessing, anyway and perform a full-on exorcism. On a crowded plane.That's gonna be easy. take it one step at a time, all right? Now, who is it possessing? It's usually gonna be somebody with some sort of weakness, you know, a chink in the armor that the demon can worm through, somebody with an addiction or emotional distress. Well, this is Amanda's first flight after the crash. If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up. Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Are you Amanda? No, I'm not. Oh, my mistake. All right, well, that's got to be amanda back there,so I'll go talk to her, and, uh, I'll get a read on her mental state. What if she's already possessed? There's ways to test that. I brought holy water. No. I think we can go more subtle. If she's possessed, she'll flinch at the name of god. Oh. Nice. Hey. What? Say it in latin. I know. Okay. Hey! What?! Uh, in latin, it's "Cristo." Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot! - Hi. - Hi. Can I help you with something? Oh, no. I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier. It makes me feel better to walk around a little bit. Oh, it happens to the best of us. Of course, you being a stewardess, I guess flying comes easy to you. You'd be surprised. Really? You're a nervous flier? Yeah, maybe a little bit. How is it that,being a stewardess, you're scared to fly? Kind of a long story. Right. I'm sorry for asking. It's okay. You ever consider other employment? No. Look, everybody's scared of something. I just, uh... I'm not gonna let it hold me back. Huh. So... Cristo. I'm sorry. Did you say something? Cristo? I-I didn't, I didn't Yeah, nothing. Never mind. Okay. All right, well, she's got to be the most well-adjusted person on the planet. - You said "cristo"? - Yeah. - And? - There's no demon in her. There's no demon getting in her. So, if it's on the plane, it can be anyone... anywhere. - Come on! That can't be normal! - Hey, hey, it's just a little turbulence. Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay? So quit treating me like I'm friggin' fool. - You need to calm down. - No, I'm sorry I can't. Yes, you can. Dude, Stow the touchy-feely, self-help yoga crap. - It's not helping. - Listen, if you're panicked, you're wide opento demonic possession, so you need to calm yourself down right now. Good. Now, I found an exorcism in here that I think is gonna work the ritual romano. What do we have to do? It's two parts. The first part expels the demon from the victim's body. It makes it manifest, which actually makes it more powerful. More powerful? - Yeah. - How? Well, it doesn't need to possess someone anymore. It can just wreak havoc on its own. Oh. And why is that a good thing? Well, because the second part sends the bastard back to hell once and for all. First thing's first we got to find it. Ohh! Don't do that. Anything? No, nothing. How much time we got? 15 minutes. Maybe we missed somebody. Maybe the thing's just not on the plane. You believe that? Well, I will if you will. What? What is it? Cristo. she's not gonna believe this. 12 minutes, dude. Oh, hi. Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope. Actually, that's kind of what we need to talk to you about. Um, okay.What can I do for you? This is gonna sound nuts, but we just don't have time for the whole "the true this out there" speech right now. Look, we know you were on flight 2485. Who are you guys? Now, we've spoken to some other survivors. We know something brought down that plane and it wasn't a mechanical failure. We need your help Because we need to stop from happening again. - Here. Now. - I'm sorry - Here. I-I'm very busy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But listen to me, huh... the pilot in 2485, Chuck Lambert. he's dead. Wait. What? What, Chuck is dead? He died in a plane crash. That's two plane crashes in two months. That doesn't strike you as strange? Look, there was something wrong with 2485. Now maybe you're sensitive maybe you didn't but there's something wrong with this flight, too. Amanda,you have to believe us. On... on 2485, there was this man. He...had these eyes. Yes. That's exactly what we're talking about. I don't understand what are you asking me to do? Okay. The copilot, we need you bring him back here. Why? What does he have to do with anything? Don't have time to explain. We just need to talk to him. Okay? How am I supposed to go in the cockpit - and get the copilot - * I * there's something broken back here, whatever will get him out of that cockpit. Do you know that I could lose my job - if you -- - you're gonna lose a lot more if you don't help us out.* Okay. Yeah, what's the problem? Wait. What are you doing? You said you were just gonna talk to him. We are gonna talk to him. Oh, my god.What's wrong with him? Look. We need you calm. - We need you outside the curtain. - well, I don't underst..., I don't know Don't let anybody in, okay? Can you do that? Can you do that? Amanda? Okay. Okay. Hurry up, sam. I don't know how much longer I can hold him. I know what happened to your girlfriend! She must have died screaming! Even now, she's burning! Sam! "prayer"... I got him. Where'd he go? He's in the plane. Hurry up.We got to finish it. I don't know. I was walking through the airport, then it all goes blank. I don't even remember getting on the plane. Anything else? No, that's all. "thank you" Let's get out of here. You okay? Dean, it knew about Jessica. Sam, these things,t-they read minds. They lie. All right?That's all it was. Yeah. Come on. Nobody knows what you guys did, but i do. A lot of people could have been killed. Your dad's gonna be real proud. We'll see you around, Jerry. You know, Jerry. Yeah. I meant to ask you how did you get my cellphone number, anyway? I've only had it for like six months. Your dad gave it to me. What? When did you talk to him? I mean, I didn't exactly talk to him,but I called his number. His voice message said to give you a call. Thanks again, guys. This doesn't make any sense, man. I've called dad's number like 50 times. It's been out of service. This is John Winchester. I can't be reached.
