You know, it's, uh, Such a complete series, What with Dean going to hell and all. My god! That was one of my favorite ones, because Dean was so... Strong... And sad and brave. And Sam... I mean, the best parts are when they'd cry. You know, like in -- In "heart," When Sam had to kill Madison, the first woman since Jessica he really loved. And in "home," when Dean had to call J	ohn And ask him for help. Gosh... If only real men were so open and in- In touchwith their feel??? Real men? I mean, no offense.

And he's a genius, so don't piss him off. "Sam and Dean Approached the run-Down..." "...Approached the ramshackle house with trepidation."</i> "Did they really want to learn the secrets "That lay beyond that door? Sam and deantraded soulful lo "Then, With determination, "Dean Pushed the doorbell with forceful... Determination." Ugh! You Chuck shurley? The Chuck shurley who wrote the "supernatural" books? Maybe why I'm Dean. Sam. The Dean and saming you've been writing about. Look, uh... I appreciate your enthusiasm. Really, I do. It's, uh, it's always nice to hear from the fans. But, uh, for your own good, I strongly suggest you get a life. See, here's the thing. We have a life. You've been using it to write your books. Now, wait a minute. Now, this isn't funny. Damn straight, it's not funny. Look, we just want to know how you're doing it. I'm not doing anything. - Are you a hunter? - What? No. I'm a writer. Then how do you know so much about demons ??? Is this some kind of "misery" thing? Ah, it is, isn't it? It's a "misery" thing! It's not a "misery" thing. Believe me, we are not fans. Well, then, what do you want?! I'm. And that's Dean. Sam and Dean are fictional characters. I made them up! They're not real! - Are those real guns? - Yup. These are real rock salts these are real fake ids Well, I got to hand it to you guys. You really are my number-One fans. So, I-I think I've got some posters in the house. - Chuck, stop. - Please wait. - Please, don't hurt me. - How much do you know? Do you know about the angels? Or Lilith breaking the seals? Wait a minute. How do youbout that? The question is how do you know. Cause I wrote it? You kept writing it You know but after the publisher got bankrupt, but those books never came out.???? Okay, wait a minute. This is some kind of joke, right? Did that -- Did phil put you up to this? Well, nice to meet you. I'm Dean winchester, and this is my brother, Sam. The last names were never in the books. I never told any about that. I never even wrote that down. Oh! Oh, you're still there. Yup. You're not ??Ion. Nope. Well, there's only one explanation. Obviously I'm a god. You're not a god. How else do you explain it? I write things and then they come to life. Yeah, no, I'm definitely a god. A cruel, cruel, capricious god. The things I put you through -- The physical beatings alone. Yeah, we're still in one piece. I killed your father. I burned your mother alive. And then you had to go through the whole horrific deal again with jessica. - Chuck... - All for what? All for the sake of literary symmetry. I toyed with your lives, your emotions, for... - ...Entertainment. - You didn't toy with us, Chuck, okay? You didn't create us. Did you really have to live through the bugs? Yeah. What about the ghost ship? Yes, that too. I am so sorry. I mean, horror is one thing, But to be forced to live bad writing... If I would have known it was real, I would have done another pass. Chuck, you're not a god! We think you're probably just psychic. No. If I were psychic, you think I'd be writing? Writing is hard. It seems that somehow, you're just... Focused on our lives. Yeah, like laser-Focused. Are you working on anything right now? - Holy crap. - What? The er...?? It's, uh, it's kind of weird. "Weird" how? It's very vonnegut. "Slaughterhouse-Five," vonnegut, or "cat's cradle," vonnegut? - What? - What? It's, uh, "kilgore trout," vonnegut. I wrote myself into it. I wrote myself, at my house... Confronted by my characters. "I was sitting in a laundromat," Reading about myself sitting in a laundromat Reading about myself -- My head hurts. There's got to be something this guy's not telling us. "Sam tossed his gigantic darks into the machine. "He was starting to have doubts about Chuck, About whether he was telling the whole truth. - Stop it. - "'Stop it,' Sam said." Guess what you do next. "Sam turned his back on Dean. His face, brooding and pen." I mean, I don't know how he's doing it, But this guy is doing it. I can't see your face, but those are definitely Your "brooding and pensive" shoulders. You just thought I was a dick. E guy's good. So... You wrote another chapter? This was all so muchier before you were real. Can take just spit it out. You especially are not gonna like this. I didn't like hell. It's Lilith. She's coming for Sam. Coming to get him? When? Tonight. She's just gonna show up? Here? Uh... "Lilih patted the bed seductively. "Unable to deny his desire, Sam succumbed, And they sank into the throes fiery demonic passion." You're kidding me, right? - You think this is funny? - You don't? I mean, come on. "Fiery demonic passion"? It's just a first draft. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Lilith is a little girl. No, uh, this time she's a -- "Comely dental hygienist ington, indiana." Great. Perfect. So what happens after the... "Fiery demonic" whatever? I don't know, that hasn't come to me yet. Dean, look, there's nothing to worry about. Lilith and me? In bed? How does this whole psychic thing of yours work? You mean my process? Yes, your "process." Well, it usually starts with a headache. A really bad headache. Aspirin is useless, so... I drink. Until I fall asleep. The first time it happened, I thought it was just a crazy dream. The first time you dreamt about us? It flowed. It just it it kept flo Still does. I-I can't stop it, really. You can't seriously believe -- Humor me. Look, why don't we, we just... Take a look at these and see what's what. You -- ...knew you were gonna ask for that. Yeah. Dean, come on. "The minivan accident wasn't that bad, "But Dean was still seeing stars. "He scratched absently at the pink-Flower band-Aids on his face." So? So, I've seen you gushing blood. You'd use duct tape and bar rags before you'd put on a pink-Flower band-Aid. - What's your point? - My point is this -- All of this -- I-Is totally implausible, it's nuts. He's been right about everything so far. You think he's just gonna ground out at first now? "Dean slid behind the wheel of his beloved impala "And drove off, "The plastic tarp on the rear window flapping like the wings of a crow." A tarp? Yeah. On the rear window. And you drive it like that. Well, he might be wrong about the details, But doesn't mean he's wrong about the end result. So we just got to run? We are a rom?? Way... From ready for a face-To-Face death match with Lilith. ??? What seems to be the prm? Bridge is out ahead. We're just trying to get out of town. Yeah, afraid not. - Is there a detour? - Nope. There's not a side road that takes us to the highway? To get to the highway, you have to cross that river. To cross the river, you have to take that bridge - How deep's the river? - Sorry. Afraid you boys are gonna have to spend the night in town. Hey, this could be a good thing. I mean, if this is what puts us on the path to Lilith, Then all we got to do is get off the path. How do you mean? It's a blueprint of what not to do. I mean, if the pages say that we go left -- - Then we go right. - Exactly. We get off-Book. We never make it to the end. It's opposite day. It says that we, uh, we get into a fight, So no fighting. No research for you... No bacon cheeseburger for you. Yeah, no problem. I'll just order something else. Hi, uh, what's good? Well, if you like burgers, oprah's girlfriend said We had the best bacon cheeseburgers in the country. Really? I'll just have the cobb salad, please. I'll have the... veggie tofu burger. Thanks. - This whole thing's ridiculous. - Lilith is ridiculous? The idea of me hooking up with her is. Right. 'Cause something like that can never happen. Dean, for the first time, We have warning that Lilith is close. So? So... We've got the jump on her. If we know when she's coming, we know where she's -- This is an opportunity. Are you -- It frustrates me when you say such reckless things. Well, it frustrates me when you'd rather hide that fight. Cobb salad for you. Ane tofu veggie burger for you. Thank you. It's not hiding. It's being smart. It's picking your battles. And is a battle that we are not ready to fight. Oh, my god. This is delicious. Tofu is amazing! I am so sorry. I gave you the bacon cheeseburger by mistake. Dude, this place charges by the hour. Yeah, well, the book says Lilith finds you at the red motel. Hence, the uh, ??? It's opposite day, remember? What are you doing? Couple of x bags ought to Lilith-Proof the room. So, what? I'm supposed to just hole up here all night? That's exactly what you're gonna do, okay? And no research. I don't care what you do -- Use the magic fingers or, watch ??? ?? Oh, dude, come on. Oh dude. Com on ??? What you gonna do? Well, the pages say that I spend all day riding around in the impala. So I'm gonna go park her. Behave yourself, would you? No homework. Watch some porn. Tureador Re d Hey! - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Thanks for coming. Ah, sure. Um... I was just wondering how much you know... About me. What do you mean? Have you seen ons of me When I'm not with Dean? Oh... You want to know if I know about the demon blood. You didn't tell Dean. I didn't even write it into the books. I was afraid it would make you look unsympathetic. Unsympathetic? Yeah, come on, Sam. I mean, sucking blood? You got to know that's wrong. It scares the hell out of me. I mean, I feel it inside of me. I... I wish to god I could stop. But you keep going back. What choice have I got? If it helps me kill Lilith op the apocalypse -- Ght that was Dean's job. That's what the angels say, right? De not... ...he's not Dean lately. Ince he got out of hell. He needs help. So you got to carry the weight? Well, he's looked after me my whole life. I can't return the favor? Yeah, sure you can. I mean if that's what this is. What else would it be? I don't know. Maybe the demon blood makes you feel stronger? More in control? No. That's not true. I'm sorry, Sam. I know it's a terrible burden -- Feeling that it all rests on your shoulders. ??? All rest on my shoulders? That seems to be where the story's headed. Am I strong enough to stop Lilith tonight? I don't know. I haven't seen that far yet. Omg ??? - Stars - ??? I'm so sorry. I just didn't see you. Are you okay? And sorry about... You know. M-My daughter's going through a doctor phase. What are you talking about? You're better now. , no... - Dean. - I take it you knew I'd be here. You look terrible. That's 'cause I just got hit by a minivan, Chuck. Oh. That it? Every damn thida you write about me comes true. And all you have to say is "oh"?! Please don't yell at me. Why do I get feeling There's ththing that you're not telling us? How you know what you know, for starters! ??? I don't know how I know. I just do. That's not good enough. How the hell are you doing this?! Dean, let him go. This man is to be protected. Why? He's a prophet of the lord. You... You're castiel... aren't you? It's an honor to meet you, Chuck. I...??? Whoa, whoa, what? This guy, a prophet? Come on, he's -- He's... He'scticallya penthouse foru Did you know about this? I, uh, I might have dreamt about it. And you didn't tell us?! It was too preposterous. Not to mention arrogant. I mean, writing yourself into the story is one thing, but as a prophet? That's like m. Night-Level douchiness. This is the guy who decides our fate? He isn't deciding anything. He's a mouthpiece -- A conduit for the inspired word. The word? The word of god? What, like the new new testament? One day, these books -- They'll be known as the winchester gospel. You got to be kidding me. I am not... kidding you. If you'd both please excuse me one minute. Him? Really? You should've seen luke. Why'd he get tapped? I don't know how prophets are chosen. The order comes from high up on the celestial chain of command. How high? Very. Well, whatever. How do we get around this? Around what? The Sam-Lith love connection. How do we stop it from happening? What the prophet has written Can't be unwritten. As he has seen it, So it shall come to pass. Re d Come on. We're getting out of here. What? Where? Anywhere, okay? Out of this motel, out of this town. I don't care if we got to swim, we are getting out. Dude, where are all the hex bags? I burned them. - You what? - Look, if Lilith sis coming, which is a big "if" -- No, no, no. It's more than an "if." Chuck is not a psychic. He's a prophet. - What? - Cass showed up, and apparently Chuck is writing the gospel of us. - Okay. - Okay. Let's get the hell out of here. No. Lith is gonna slaughter you. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. So what? You think you can take her? Only one way to find out, Dean, and I say bring her on. - Sam... - You think I'll do it, don't you? - You think I'll go dark side. - Yes! Okay? Yes. The way you've been acting lately? The things you've beendoing? Oh, I know. How you ripped alastair apart like it was nothing, like you were swatting a fly. Cass told me, okay? What else did he tell you? Nothing I don't already know. That you've been using your psychic crap, And you've been getting stronger. We just don't know why, and we don't know how. - It's not what you think. - Then what is it, Sam? 'Cause I'm at a total loss. Are you coming or not? No. Well,I feel stupid doing this. But...I am fresh out of options. I need some help. I'm praying,okay? Come on. Please. Prayer is a sign of faith. This is a good thing,Dean. So does that mean you'll help me? I'm not sure what I can do. Drag Sam out of here -- Now. Before Lilith shows up. It's a prophecy. I can't interfere. You have tested me and thrown me every which way. And I have never asked for anything. Not a damn thing. But now I'm asking. I need your help. Please. What you're asking,it's... Not within my power to do. Why? 'Cause it's "divine prophecy"? Yes. So,what -- We're just supposed to sit around A - And wait for it to happen? I'm sorry. Screw you. You and your mission. Your god. If you don't help me now, Then when the time comes And you needme... ...don't bother knocking. Dean. Dean! What?! You must understand Whyi can't intercede. Prophets are very special. They're protected. I get that. If anything threatens a prophet, Anything at all, An archangel will appear to destroy that threat. Archangels are fierce. They're absolute. They're heaven's most terrifying weapon. And these archangels, they're tied to prophets? Yes. So if a prophet was in the same room as a demon -- Then the most fearsome wrath of heaven would rain down on that demon. Just so you understand... Why I can't help. Thanks,Cass. Good luck. What are you doing here? I didn't write this. Come on. I need you to come with me. What? Where? To the motel where Sam is. That's where Lilith is. Yeah,exactly. I need you to stop her. Are you insane? Lith? I know what she's capable of, Dean -- I wrote her. All right, listen to me. You have an archangel tethered to you,okay? All you got to do is show up and boom! -- Lith gets smoked. But I-I haven't seen that yet. T- The story -- Chuck,you're the only shot that I've got left. But...I'm just a writer. This isn't a story anymore,man. This is real! And you're in it! Now,I need you to get off your ass and fight. Come on,Chuck. No friggin' way. Okay,well,then, How about this -- I've got a gun in my pocket, And if you don't come with me, I'll blow your brains out. I thought you said I was protected by an archangel. Well, interesting exercise. Let's see who the quicker draw is. Hello,Sam. I've been waiting for you. Where's the knife,Sam? On the nightstand. By the bed. You're gonna have to try a lot harder than that. How 'bout this? You're strong. But you're notthatstrong. Not yet. So why don't you throw me around then? Because I can't And you know it. You're immune to my charms. Seems we're at a stalemate. Why are you here? To talk. Yeah,well, I'm not interested. Hmm... Even if I'm offering To stand down... From the seals... The apocalypse... All of it? You expect me to believe that? Honestly? No. You were always the smart one. But it's the truth. You can end it,Sam. Right here,right now. I'll stop breaking seals, Lucifer keeps rotting in his cage. All you have to do is agree to my terms. Why would you back down? Why now? Turns out, I don't survive this war. Killed off,right before the good part starts. What do you want? For it to go back to the way it was. Before I had angels to deal with 24/7. The good old days, When it was all baby blood all the time. And what do you want in return? Your head on a stick. Dean's,too. Call it a consolation prize. So what do you say,Sam? Self-Sacrifice is the winchester way,isn't it? You really think I'm stupid enough to fall for this? I make a deal, I have to follow through. Those are the rules, And you know it. Are you really so arrogant That you would put your life before the lives of 6billioninnocent people? Maybe it's all that demon blood pumping through your pipes. Man after my own heart. You think I'm likeyou? I amnothinglike you. Then prove it. Going once. Going twice. Fine. Swell. By the way,a contract with me will take more than a kiss. A lot more. Don't worry. The dental hygienist in here? She wants it bad. I am the prophet Chuck! You've got to be joking. This is no joke. See,Chuck here's got an archangel on his shoulder. You've got about 10 seconds before this room is full of wrath And you're a piece of charcoal. You sure you want to tangle with that? So deals,huh? That's what she said. To call the whole thing off -- Angels,seals,lucifer rising, The whole nine? That was the gist of it. Huh. What? You didn't think once about taking it? You kidding me? You spent all day trying to talk me off the Lilith track. I'm just saying... She would have found some way to weasel out of it. And all it would have cost us was our lives. Yeah, I guess you're right. Anyway. That's not the point. What's the point? The point is, She's scared. I could see it. Lilith is running. Running from what? Don't know. But she was telling the truth about one thing. What's that? She's not gonna survive the apocalypse. I'll make sure of that. Did you see it? Who are you? I'm Zachariah. You may know me From your work. What do you want? Did you see it? Is it true? Is all of that...really going to happen? Have you been wrong so far? I got to warn Sam and Dean. I wouldn't advise it. People shouldn't know too much about their own destiny. You try...and I'll stop you. Where are you going? To go kill myself. Don't be melodramatic, Chuck. We'd only bring you back to life. What am I supposed to do?
