- For a while now. The mooks have melted down the gun by now. I hear differently. And if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it. In chapter 33 of "Supernatural", there was that girl Bela. She stole The Colt from you, and then she "said" she gave it to Lilith, rember? You know she lied, right? - She never really gave it to Lilith. - What? Bela gives The Colt to a demon named Crowley. Crowley? Mr. Pendleton, I presume. The name's Crowley. In my negotiations, I was dealing with a very young attractive lady. Yes. I know. But you, piggy banker... You... are a big fish. And I wanted to do you the honor of sealing this deal personally. But she said the deal would be sealed with a kiss. That's right. No, I mean, she's... Your choice. You can cling to six decades of deep-seated homophobia or just give it up. And get a complete bailout of your bank's ridiculous incompetence. - There are just things... - Going once. - No, I don't think so. - Going twice. All right! Got him. = 510 = = Supernatural Team = The demon Crowley is making a deal. Even as we speak, it's... Going... down. "Going down"? Right. Okay, huggy bear. - Just don't lose him. - I won't lose him. Damn you. Enjoy the obscene wealth. See you in 10 years. I followed him. It's not far, but... ... it's layered in enochian warding magic. I can't get in. That's okay. You did great. We'll take it from here. Hello? My car broke down. I need some help. We'll be down in a minute. Evening, pretty lady. - Get yourself on in here. - I just need to make a call. You don't need to call anyone, baby. We're the only help you're ever gonna need. You know what? I think I should wait by my car. We said get your ass in here. - Nice work, Jo. - Thanks. Okay. Shall we? It's "Crowley," right? So... the hardy boys finally found me. Took you long enough. Do you have any idea how much this rug costs? This is it, right? This is what it's all about. We need to talk. Privately. What the hell is this? Do you know how deep I could have buried this thing? There's no reason you or anyone should know this even exists at all. Except that I told you. - You told us? - Rumors, innuendo... - Sent out on the grapevine. - Why? Why tell us anything? I want you to take this thing to Lucifer and empty it into his face. And why exactly would you want the devil dead? It's called... Survival. But I forgot... you two, at best, are functional morons. Yeah, you're functioning... morons. Mor... Lucifer isn't a demon, remember? He's an angel... famous for his hatred of humankind. To him, you're just... filthy bags of pus. If that's the way he feels about you... ... what can he think aboutus? But he created you. To him, we're just servants. Cannon fodder. If Lucifer manages to exterminate humankind... ... we're next. So... Help me. Let's all go back to simpler, better times. Back to... when we could all follow our natures. I'm in sales, damn it. So, what do you say? What if... I give you this thing... And you go kill the devil? Great. You wouldn't happen to know where the devil is, by chance, would you? Thursday. Birdies tell me... He has an appointment in Carthage, Missouri. Great. Thanks. Right. You probably need some more ammunition. Excuse me for asking, but aren't you kind of signing your own death warrant? What happens to you if we go up against the devil and lose? Number one... He's gonna wipe us all out anyway. Two... After you leave here, I go on an extended vacation to all points nowhere. And three... How about you don't miss?! Morons! All right, big boy. I think I'm starting to feel something. It's got to be a trap, right? Sam winchester having trust issues with a demon. Better late than never. Yeah, and thank you again for your continued support. You're welcome. And, you know, trap or no trap, we got a snowball's chance, we got to take it, right? Yeah, I suppose. Besides, I'm not sure it is a trap. Check it out. Carthage is lit up like a christmas tree with revelation omens. And look at this. There's been six missing persons reported in town since sunday. I think the devil's there. Look, when you think about it... ... you can't come with. Dean... Look, I go against Satan and screw the pooch... We've lost a game piece. That, we can take. But if you're there... Then we are handing the devil's vessel right over to him. - That's not smart. - Since when have we ever done anything smart? - I'm serious, Sam. - So am i. Haven't we learned a damn thing? If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it together. That's a stupid friggin' idea. Boy. Talk about stupid ideas. Good god. True, that. So... Dangerous mission tomorrow. Guess it's time to... Eat, drink, and... You know... Make merry. Are you giving me the "last night on earth" speech? - What? - What? If i was, would that work? No. Sweetheart, if this is our last night on earth, then I'm going to spend it with a little thing I call "self-respect". - If you're into that kind of thing. - Everybody, get in here! It's time for the lineup. Usual suspects, in the corner. Come on, Bobby. Nobody wants their picture taken. Hear, hear. Shut up. You're drinkin'my beer. Anyway... I'm gonna need something to rember your sorry asses by. Always good to have an optimist around. Bobby's right. Tomorrow we hunt the devil. This is our last night on earth. You getting a signal? No, nothin'. Nice and spooky. - Place seem a little empty to you? - We're gonna go check out the PD. You guys stay here... See if you can find anybody. - Ever heard of a door handle? - Of course I have. - What is it, cass? - This town's not empty. Reapers. - "Reapers"? - As in more than one? They only gather like this at times of great catastrophe... Chicago fire, san francisco quake... Pompeii. Excuse me. I need to find out why they're here. Hello, brother. - Station's empty. - So is everything else. - Have you seen cass? - What? He was with you. Nope. He went after the reapers. - Reapers? - He saw reapers? Where? Well, kind of... everywhere. Lucifer. So, I take it you're here with the Winchesters. I came alone. Loyalty. Such a nice quality to see in this day and age. Castiel, right? Castiel... I'm told you came here in an automobile. Yes. What was that like? Slow. Confing. What a peculiar thing you are. What's wrong with your vessel? Yes, um... Nick is wearing a bit thin, i'm afraid. He can't contain me forever, so... You... You are not taking Sam Winchester. - I won't let you. - Castiel. I don't understand why you're fighting me, of all the angels. You really have to ask? I rebelled. I was cast out. You rebelled. You were cast out. Almost all of heaven wants to see me dead. And if they succeed, guess what. You're their new public enemy number one. We're on the same side, like it or not, so... Why not just serve your own best interests? Which, in this case, just happen to be mine. I'll die first. I suppose you will. This is great. We've been in town for 20 minutes. We've already lost the angel up our sleeve. You think... You think Lucifer got him? I don't know what else to think. There you are. Meg! You shouldn't have come here, boys. Yeah? I could say the same thing for you. Didn't come here alone, Dean. - Hellhounds! - Yeah, Dean... Your favorite. Come on, boys. My father wants to see you. - I think we'll pass. - Thanks. Your call. You can make this easy, or you can make it really, really hard. When have you known us to ever make anything easy? Run! Jo, stay back! Boys, need some help here! It'll be all right. You're gonna be all right. Thank you. How's she holding up? - The salt lines are holding up. - Safe for now. Safe or trapped like rats. You heard Meg. Her father's here. This is our one shot, Sammy. We got to take it. - There we go. - Sam, some help here, please. The number you dialed is unavailable. Please... Damn it, boys. KC5 Fox Delta Oscar, go ahead. Bobby, it's Dean. We got problems. It's okay, that's why I'm here. Is everyone all right? It's Jo. It's pretty bad. Okay. Copy that. Now we figure what we do next. I don't think she's... I said, "what do we do next?", Dean. Right. Okay, right. Now... Tell me what you got. Before he went missing, did Cass say how many reapers? I don't know. He said a lot of things, I guess. - Does the number matter? - Devil's in the details. Bobby, it's Ellen. The way he was looking, the number of places his eyes went, I'd say over a dozen reapers, probably more. - I do not like the sound of that. - Nobody does. What does that sound like? It sounds like Death, son. I think Satan's in town to work a ritual. I think he's planning to unleash Death. As in this dude and taxes are the only sure thing? As in Death. The horseman, the pale rider in the flesh. Unleash? Hasn't Death been tromping all over the place? I've died several times! Not this guy. This is the angel of death, big daddy reaper. They keep this guy chained in a box 600 feet under. Last time they hauled him up, Noah was building a boat. That's why the place is crawling with reapers. They're waiting on the big boss to show. Any other good news? In a manner of speaking. I've been researching Carthage since you've been gone, trying to suss out what the devil might want there. What you just said drops the last piece of the puzzle in place. The angel of death must be brought into this world at midnight through a place of awful carnage. During the civil war, there was a battle in Carthage. So intense the soldiers called it "the battle of hellhole." Where'd it go down? On the land of William Jasper's farm. I got the Winchesters pinned down. For now. What should I do? Leave them alone. Are you sure? - Shouldn't we... - Trust me, child. Everything happens for a reason. Well, Castiel... You have some time. To change your mind. We know where the devil's gonna be, we know when, and we have the Colt. We just have to get past... Eight or so hellhounds and get to the farm by midnight. After we get Jo and Ellen out of town. - Won't be easy. - Stretcher? I'll see what we got. Stop. Guys, stop. Can we be realistic about this, please? I can't move my legs. I can't be moved. My guts are being held in by an ace bandage. We got to... We got to get our priorities straight here. Number one, I'm not going anywhere. - Joanna Beth, stop talking like that... - Mom. I can't fight. I can't walk. But I can do something. We've got propane, wiring, rock salt, iron nails, everything. - Everything? - To build a bomb, Sam. Jo... no. You got another plan? You got any other plan? Those are hellhounds out there. They've got our scents. Those bitches will never stop coming after you. We let the dogs in, you guys hit the roof, make a break for the building next over, and I can wait here with my finger on the button. Rip those mutts a new one. Or at least get you a few minutes' head start, anyway. - I won't let you. - This is why we're here, right? If I can get us a shot on the devil... Dean, we have to take it. This might be your last chance to treat me like an adult. You might wanna take it. You heard her. Get to work. Okay, this is it. See you on the other side. Probably sooner than later. Make it later. Somebody's got to let them in. And like you said, you're not moving. You got me, Jo. And you're right. This is important. But I will not leave you here alone. Get goin' now, boys. I said go. And, Dean... Kick it in the ass. Don't miss. I will always love you, baby. Honey? Jo... It's okay. It's okay. That's my good girl. You can go straight back to hell, you ugly bitch! We know what happened to some of the town's people. Last words? I think I'm good. Me too. Here goes nothin'. You wanted to see me? You don't need that gun here. I'd never hurt you. Not really. Well, I'd hurt you. So suck it. Where did you get that? Now... Where were we? Don't feel too bad, Sam. There's only five things in all of creation that gun can't kill, I happen to be one of them. But if you give me a minute, I'm almost done. You know... I don't suppose you'd just say yes right here and now? End this whole tiresome discussion? - That's crazy, right? - It's never gonna happen! I don't know, Sam. I think it will. I think it'll happen soon. Within six months. And I think it'll happen... In Detroit. You listen to me, you son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you myself. You understand me? I'm going to rip your heart out! That's good, Sam. You keep fanning that fire in your belly. All that pent-up rage. I'm gonna need it. What did you do? - What did you do to this town? - I was very generous with this town. One demon for every able-bodied man. And the rest of them? In there. I know, it's awful, but... These horsemen are so demanding. So it was... Women and children first. I know what you must think of me. But I have to do this. I have to. You, of all people, should understand. What's that supposed to mean? I was a son. A brother, like you. A younger brother. And I had an older brother who I loved. Idolized, in fact. And one day, I went to him and I begged him to stand with me. And Michael... Michael turned on me. Called me a freak. A monster. And then he beat me down. All because I was different. Because I had a mind of my own. Tell me something. Any of this sound familiar? Anyway... You'll have to excuse me. Midnight is calling. And I have a ritual to finish. Don't go anywhere. Not that you could if you would. Now, repeat after me. We offer up our lives blood, souls. To complete this tribute. What? They're just demons. You seem pleased. We're gonna win. Can you feel it? You cloud-hopping pansies lost the whole damn universe. Lucifer's gonna take over heaven. We're goin' to heaven, Clarence. Strange. Because I heard a different theory from a demon named Crowley. You don't know Crowley. He believes that Lucifer is just using demons to achieve an end. And that... Once he does... He'll destroy you all. You're wrong. Lucifer is the father of our race. Our creator. Your God may be a deadbeat, But mine... Mine walks the earth. You can't gank demons, can you? You're cut off from the home office, and you ain't got the juice. So, what can you do, you impotent sap? I can do this. Oh, hello, Death. The governor has declared a state of emergency for Paulding County, Including the towns of Marion, Fetterville, and Carthage. The storm system has reportedly touched off a number of tornadoes in the area. Death tolls
