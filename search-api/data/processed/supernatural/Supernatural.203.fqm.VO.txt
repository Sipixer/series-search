CONNECTION WITH... FIRST CATTLE MUTILATIONS, NOW TWO MURDERS? KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE RITUAL STUFF. YOU KNOW, LIKE SATANIC CULT RITUAL STUFF. [ LAUGHS ] YOU'RE NOT KIDDING. NO. THOSE COWS AREN'T BEING MUTILATED. YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I KNOW? HOW? BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CATTLE MUTILATION. COW DROPS, LEAVE IT IN THE SUN, WITHIN 48 HOURS THE BLOAT WILL SPLIT IT OPEN SO CLEAN IT'S JUST ABOUT SURGICAL. THE BODILY FLUIDS FALL DOWN INTO THE GROUND, GET SOAKED UP, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT GRAVITY DOES. BUT, HEY, IT COULD BE SATAN. WHAT NEWSPAPER DID YOU SAY YOU WORKED FOR?

[ SIGHS ] ALL RIGHT, LIFT HER LIP UP AGAIN. WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO THROW UP. NO, I THINK I SAW SOMETHING. UGH. IS THAT A HOLE? IT'S A TOOTH. SAM, THAT'S A FANG. RETRACTABLE SET OF VAMPIRE FANGS. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. WELL, THIS CHANGES THINGS. YOU THINK? [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] HOW'S IT GOING? LIVING THE DREAM. WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU? TWO BEERS, PLEASE. SO, WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME PEOPLE. SURE. IT'S HARD TO BE LONELY. YEAH, BUT, UM, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. GREAT. SO, THESE PEOPLE WOULD'VE MOVED HERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, PROBABLY PRETTY ROWDY, LIKE TO DRINK. YEAH, REAL NIGHT OWLS, YOU KNOW? SLEEP ALL DAY, PARTY ALL NIGHT. BARKER FARM GOT LEASED OUT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO -- REAL WINNERS. THEY'VE BEEN IN HERE A LOT -- DRINKERS, NOISY. I HAD TO 86 THEM ONCE OR TWICE. THANKS. SMILE. WHAT? SHOW US THOSE PEARLY WHITES. FOR THE LOVE OF -- YOU WANT TO STICK THAT THING SOMEPLACE ELSE? I'M NOT A VAMPIRE. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I HEARD YOU GUYS IN THERE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT VAMPIRES? HOW TO KILL THEM. NOW, SERIOUSLY, BRO, THAT KNIFE'S MAKING ME ITCH. HEY! WHOA. EASY THERE, CHACHI. SEE? FANGLESS. HAPPY? NOW, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? SAM AND DEAN WINCHESTER. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU KNOW, I MET YOUR OLD MAN ONCE -- HELL OF A GUY, GREAT HUNTER. I HEARD HE PASSED. I'M SORRY. IT'S BIG SHOES, BUT, FROM WHAT I HEAR, YOU GUYS FILL THEM -- GREAT TRACKERS, GOOD IN A TIGHT SPOT. YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT OUR FAMILY. WORD TRAVELS FAST. YOU KNOW HOW HUNTERS TALK. NO, WE DON'T. I GUESS THERE'S A LOT YOUR DAD NEVER TOLD YOU, HUH? Sam: SO, UM... SO, THOSE TWO VAMPIRES, THEY WERE YOURS, HUH? YEP. BEEN HERE TWO WEEKS. DID YOU CHECK OUT THAT BARKER FARM? IT'S A BUST. A BUNCH OF HIPPIE FREAKS. THOUGH THEY COULD KILL WITH THAT PATCHOULI SMELL ALONE. WHERE'S THE NEST, THEN? I GOT THIS ONE COVERED. LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG. IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU FELLAS, BUT I'VE BEEN ON THIS THING FOR OVER A YEAR. I KILLED A FANG BACK IN AUSTIN, TRACKED THE NEST ALL THE WAY UP HERE. I'LL FINISH IT. WE COULD HELP. THANKS, BUT, UH, I'M KIND OF A GO-IT-ALONE TYPE OF GUY. I'VE BEEN ITCHING FOR A HUNT. SORRY. BUT, HEY, I HEAR THERE'S A CHUPACABRA TWO STATES OVER. GO AHEAD AND KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT. IT WAS REAL GOOD MEETING YOU, THOUGH. I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK ON THE FLIP SIDE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ DOG BARKING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ CLICK ] [ SCREECHING ] [ MOTOR WHIRRING ] [ HOWLING ] [ BONES CRACK ] SO, UH, I GUESS I GOT TO BUY YOU THAT DRINK. NO, NO, I GOT IT. COME ON. I INSIST. THANK YOU, SWEETIE. [ CHUCKLES ] ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST. THAT'S RIGHT. [ SIGHS ] DEAN [LAUGHS] YOU GAVE THAT BIG-ASS FANG ONE HELL OF A HAIRCUT, MY FRIEND. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. YEP. YOU ALL RIGHT, SAMMY? YEAH, FINE. LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE, SAMMY. HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS TO CALL ME THAT. OKAY. NO OFFENSE MEANT. JUST CELEBRATING A LITTLE -- JOB WELL DONE. RIGHT. WELL, UM, DECAPITATIONS AREN'T MY IDEA OF A GOOD TIME, I GUESS. OH, COME ON, MAN, IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS HUMAN. YOU GOT TO HAVE MORE FUN. SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL HIM. YOU COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM THIS GUY. YEAH, I BET I COULD. LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA BRING YOU GUYS DOWN. I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK TO THE MOTEL. YOU SURE? YEAH. SAMMY... REMIND ME TO BEAT THAT BUZZKILL OUT OF YOU LATER, ALL RIGHT? SOMETHING I SAID? NO, NO. HE JUST GETS THAT WAY SOMETIMES. TELL YOU WHAT, MATCH QUARTERS FOR THE NEXT ROUND. SO I PICKED UP THIS CROSSBOW, AND I HIT THAT UGLY SUCKER -- SILVER-TIPPED ARROW RIGHT IN HIS HEART. SAMMY'S WAITING IN THE CAR, AND ME AND MY DAD TAKE THE THING INTO THE WOODS, BURN IT TO A CRISP. I'M SITTING THERE, AND I'M LOOKING INTO THE FIRE, AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, "I'M 16 YEARS OLD. "KIDS MY AGE ARE WORRIED ABOUT PIMPLES, PROM DATES. "I'M SEEING THINGS THAT THEY'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW, NEVER EVEN DREAM OF." SO RIGHT THEN, I JUST SORT OF -- EMBRACED THE LIFE? YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] HOW'D YOU GET STARTED? FIRST TIME I SAW A VAMPIRE, I WAS BARELY 18. HOME ALONE WITH MY SISTER. I HEAR THE WINDOW BREAK IN HER ROOM. I GRABBED MY DAD'S GUN, RUN IN, TRY TO GET IT OFF HER. IT WAS TOO LATE. SO I SHOOT THE DAMN THING, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS ABOUT AS USEFUL AS SNAPPING IT WITH A RUBBER BAND. IT RUSHES ME, PICKS ME UP, FLINGS ME ACROSS THE ROOM, KNOCKS ME OUT COLD. WHEN I WAKE UP, THE VAMPIRE'S GONE... MY SISTER'S GONE. AND THEN? THEN... TRY EXPLAINING THAT ONE TO YOUR FAMILY. SO I LEFT HOME... AND THEN BUMMED AROUND LOOKING FOR INFORMATION -- HOW YOU TRACK THEM, HOW YOU KILL THEM. AND I FOUND THAT FANG. IT WAS MY FIRST KILL. SORRY ABOUT YOUR SISTER. YEAH. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL. I CAN STILL SEE HER, YOU KNOW, THE WAY SHE WAS. [ SIGHS ] BUT, HEY, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I MEAN, YOUR DAD -- IT'S GOT TO BE ROUGH. YEAH. YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE GUYS. TOOK SOME TERRIBLE BEATINGS -- JUST KEPT COMING. SO YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING TO YOURSELF, "HE'S INDESTRUCTIBLE. HE'LL ALWAYS BE AROUND. NOTHING CAN KILL MY DAD." AND JUST LIKE THAT... [SNAPS FINGERS] HE'S GONE. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS TO SAMMY. [ CHUCKLES ] NO, I GOT TO KEEP MY GAME FACE ON. BUT, UH... TRUTH IS, I'M NOT HANDLING IT VERY WELL. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THIS -- HOLE INSIDE YOU? AND IT JUST GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND DARKER AND DARKER? GOOD. YOU CAN USE IT. KEEPS YOU HUNGRY. TRUST ME, THERE'S PLENTY OUT THERE NEEDS KILLING, AND THIS WILL HELP YOU DO IT. DEAN, IT'S NOT A CRIME TO NEED YOUR JOB. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HARDRAILS ROADHOUSE. HEY, ELLEN -- SAM WINCHESTER. SAM, IT'S GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU. YOU BOYS ARE OKAY, AREN'T YOU? YEAH, YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE. GOT A QUESTION. YOU EVER RUN ACROSS A GUY NAMED GORDON WALKER? I KNOW GORDON. AND? HE'S A REAL GOOD HUNTER. WHY YOU ASKING? WE RAN INTO HIM ON A JOB. WE'RE KIND OF WORKING WITH HIM. DON'T DO THAT, SAM. I-I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS A GOOD HUNTER. YEAH, AND HANNIBAL LECTER'S A GOOD PSYCHIATRIST. HE IS DANGEROUS TO EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AROUND HIM. IF HE'S WORKING ON A JOB, LET HIM HANDLE IT AND MOVE ON. ELLEN -- NO, SAM, YOU JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU, OKAY? RIGHT, OKAY. YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE THIS LIFE? HMM? IT'S ALL BLACK AND WHITE. THERE'S NO MAYBE. YOU FIND THE BAD THING -- KILL IT. MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR LIVES IN SHADES OF GRAY. IS THIS RIGHT? IS THAT WRONG? NOT US. NOT SURE SAMMY WOULD AGREE WITH YOU, BUT, UH... DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S MUCH LIKE US. I'M NOT SAYING HE'S WRONG -- JUST DIFFERENT. YOU AND ME, WE WERE BORN TO DO THIS. IT'S IN OUR BLOOD. STEP BACK, ELI. MY NAME'S LENORE. I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. WE JUST NEED TO TALK. TALK? YEAH, OKAY. BUT I MIGHT HAVE A TOUGH TIME PAYING ATTENTION TO MUCH BESIDES ELI'S TEETH. HE WON'T HURT YOU, EITHER. YOU HAVE MY WORD. YOUR WORD? OH, YEAH, GREAT, THANKS. LADY, NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST VAMPIRE I'VE MET. WE'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS. WE DON'T KILL HUMANS, AND WE DON'T DRINK THEIR BLOOD. WE HAVEN'T FOR A LONG TIME. IS THIS SOME JOKE? NOTICE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. OKAY, UH, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE, BUT SHOULDN'T YOU BE STARVING TO DEATH? WE FOUND OTHER WAYS -- CATTLE BLOOD. YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE -- IT'S NOT IDEAL. IN FACT, IT'S DISGUSTING. BUT IT ALLOWS US TO GET BY. OKAY. UH, WHY? SURVIVAL. NO DEATHS, NO MISSING LOCALS, NO REASON FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO COME LOOKING FOR PEOPLE LIKE US. AND WE BLEND IN. OUR KIND IS PRACTICALLY EXTINCT. IT TURNS OUT, WE WEREN'T AS HIGH UP THE FOOD CHAIN AS WE IMAGINED. WHY ARE WE EXPLAINING OURSELVES TO THIS KILLER? ELI. WE CHOKE ON COW'S BLOOD SO THAT NONE OF THEM SUFFER. TONIGHT, THEY MURDERED CONRAD, AND THEY CELEBRATED. ELI, THAT'S ENOUGH. YEAH, ELI, THAT'S ENOUGH. WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. WE'RE LEAVING THIS TOWN TONIGHT. THEN, WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE? WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING TO ME? BELIEVE ME, I'D RATHER NOT. BUT I KNOW YOUR KIND. ONCE YOU HAVE THE SCENT, YOU'LL KEEP TRACKING US. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE GO. HUNTERS WILL FIND US. SO YOU'RE ASKING US NOT TO FOLLOW YOU. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE. WE'RE NOT HURTING ANYONE. RIGHT, SO YOU KEEP SAYING. BUT GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU. FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO? I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO. TAKE HIM BACK. NOT A MARK ON HIM. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] THIS IS THE BEST PATTERN I CAN ESTABLISH. IT'S SKETCHY, AT BEST. LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALL COMING FROM THIS SIDE OF TOWN, WHICH MEANS THE NEST WOULD BE AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE, RIGHT? YEP, THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING. PROBLEM IS, THERE'S 35, 40 FARMS OUT THERE. I SEARCHED ABOUT HALF OF THEM ALREADY BUT NOTHING YET. THEY'RE COVERING THEIR TRACKS REAL GOOD. I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEARCH THE OTHER HALF. WHAT TIME IS IT? WHERE IS SAM? CAR'S PARKED OUTSIDE. PROBABLY WENT FOR A WALK. SEEMS LIKE THE TAKE-A-WALK TYPE. YEAH, HE IS, BUT... WHERE YOU BEEN? CAN I TALK TO YOU ALONE? YOU MIND CHILLING OUT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES? DEAN, MAYBE WE GOT TO RETHINK THIS HUNT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE WERE YOU? [ SIGHS ] IN THE NEST. YOU FOUND IT? THEY FOUND ME, MAN. HOW DID YOU GET OUT? HOW MANY DID YOU KILL? NONE. SAM, THEY DIDN'T JUST LET YOU GO. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHERE IS IT? I WAS BLINDFOLDED. I DON'T KNOW. YOU GOT TO KNOW SOMETHING. WE WENT OVER THAT BRIDGE OUTSIDE OF TOWN, BUT WE SHOULDN'T GO AFTER THEM. WHY NOT? I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LIKE OTHER VAMPIRES. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE. YOU'RE JOKING. THEN, HOW DO THEY STAY ALIVE OR UNDEAD OR WHATEVER THE HELL THEY ARE? THE CATTLE MUTILATIONS. THEY SAID THEY LIVE OFF OF ANIMAL BLOOD. AND YOU BELIEVED THEM? LOOK AT ME, DEAN. THEY LET ME GO WITHOUT A SCRATCH. WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYING -- NO, MAN. NO WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY LET YOU GO. I DON'T REALLY CARE. WE FIND THEM, AND WE WASTE THEM. WHY? WHAT PART OF VAMPIRES DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, SAM? IF IT'S SUPERNATURAL, WE KILL IT. THAT'S OUR JOB. NO, DEAN, THAT IS NOT OUR JOB. OUR JOB IS HUNTING EVIL. AND IF THESE THINGS AREN'T KILLING PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT EVIL. OF COURSE, THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME, SAM. THEY'RE NOT HUMAN, OKAY? WE HAVE TO EXTERMINATE EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM. NO, DEAN, I DON'T THINK SO, ALL RIGHT? NOT THIS TIME. GORDON'S BEEN ON THOSE VAMPS FOR A YEAR. HE KNOWS. GORDON? YOU'RE TAKING HIS WORD FOR IT? THAT'S RIGHT. ELLEN SAYS HE'S BAD NEWS. YOU CALLED ELLEN? AND I'M SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO HER? WE BARELY KNOW HER, SAM. NO THANKS. I'LL GO WITH GORDON. RIGHT, 'CAUSE GORDON'S SUCH AN OLD FRIEND. YOU DON'T THINK I CAN SEE WHAT THIS IS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR DAD. A POOR ONE. SHUT UP, SAM. HE'S NOT EVEN CLOSE, DEAN, NOT ON HIS BEST DAY. YOU SLAP ON THIS FAKE SMILE, BUT I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT 'CAUSE I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, DEAN. DAD'S DEAD. AND HE LEFT A HOLE, AND IT HURTS SO BAD YOU CAN'T TAKE IT. BUT YOU CAN'T JUST FILL UP THAT HOLE WITH WHOEVER YOU WANT TO. IT'S AN INSULT TO HIS MEMORY. OKAY. YOU CAN HIT ME ALL YOU WANT. IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. I'M GOING TO THAT NEST. YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME WHERE IT IS. FINE. I'LL FIND IT MYSELF. DEAN. GORDON? YOU THINK HE WENT AFTER THEM? PROBABLY. DEAN, WE HAVE TO STOP HIM. REALLY? 'CAUSE I SAY WE LEND A HAND. JUST GIVE ME THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, WOULD YOU? YOU OWE ME THAT. YEAH, WE'LL SEE. I'LL DRIVE. GIVE ME THE KEYS. HE SNAKED THE KEYS. [ ENGINE SPUTTERS ] I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. I JUST FIXED HER UP, TOO. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] SO, THE BRIDGE, IS THAT ALL YOU GOT? THE BRIDGE WAS 4 1/2 MINUTES FROM THEIR FARM. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I COUNTED. TOOK A LEFT OUT OF THE FARM, THEN TURNED RIGHT ONTO A DIRT ROAD, FOLLOWED THAT FOR TWO MINUTES SLIGHTLY UPHILL THEN TOOK ANOTHER QUICK RIGHT, AND WE HIT THE BRIDGE. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE A MONSTER PAIN IN THE ASS... ...BUT YOU'RE GOOD. IN THE TRUCK, THANK YOU. WE CAN'T LEAVE LIKE THIS. LENORE, LISTEN TO ME. WE NEED TO STAY AND FIGHT. THEY WERE MY FRIENDS, TOO, ELI, MY FAMILY. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS SELF-DEFENSE -- KILL OR BE KILLED. THEY CAN'T HUNT US IF THEY'RE DEAD. KILLING THOSE THREE WOULDN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. THERE'S MORE WHERE THEY CAME FROM. WE'RE OUTNUMBERED. THIS...THIS IS ALL WE CAN DO. TRY AND REASON -- YOU CAN'T REASON WITH THESE PEOPLE. THEY'RE GONNA KILL US ALL ANYWAY. WE SHOULD AT LEAST TAKE A FEW OF THEM WITH US. I'M NOT GIVING UP HOPE. IF WE CAN CHANGE, THEY CAN CHANGE. NOW, GO INTO TOWN AND GATHER THE OTHERS. WE LEAVE BEFORE SUNRISE. DEAD MAN'S BLOOD, BITCH. SAM, DEAN, COME ON IN. GORDON, WHAT'S GOING ON? JUST POISONING LENORE HERE WITH SOME DEAD MAN'S BLOOD. SHE'S GONNA TELL US WHERE ALL HER FRIENDS ARE, AREN'T YOU? WANT TO HELP? LOOK, MAN -- GRAB A KNIFE. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO START IN ON THE FINGERS. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HEY, LET'S ALL JUST CHILL OUT, HUH? I'M COMPLETELY CHILL. GORDON, PUT THE KNIFE DOWN. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SAM HERE NEEDS TO CHILL. JUST STEP AWAY FROM HER, ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M WASTING MY TIME HERE. THIS BITCH WILL NEVER TALK. MIGHT AS WELL PUT HER OUT OF HER MISERY. I JUST SHARPENED IT, SO IT'S COMPLETELY HUMANE. GORDON, I'M LETTING HER GO. YOU'RE NOT DOING A DAMN THING. Dean: HEY, HEY. GORDON, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. Gordon: WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT? IT'S LIKE I SAID, DEAN -- NO SHADES OF GRAY. YEAH, I HEAR YOU. AND I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. DO YOU? THE VAMPIRE THAT KILLED YOUR SISTER DESERVED TO DIE, BUT -- [ CHUCKLES ] KILLED MY SISTER. THAT FILTHY FANG DIDN'T KILL MY SISTER. IT TURNED HER, MADE HER ONE OF THEM. SO I HUNTED HER DOWN, AND I KILLED HER MYSELF. YOU DID WHAT? IT WASN'T MY SISTER ANYMORE. IT WASN'T HUMAN. I DIDN'T BLINK. AND NEITHER WOULD YOU. Sam: SO YOU KNEW ALL ALONG, THEN. YOU KNEW THE VAMPIRES WEREN'T KILLING ANYONE. YOU KNEW ABOUT THE CATTLE, AND YOU JUST DIDN'T CARE. Gordon: CARE ABOUT WHAT? A NEST OF VAMPIRES SUDDENLY ACTING NICE, TAKING A LITTLE TIME OUT FROM SUCKING INNOCENT PEOPLE, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BUY THAT? TRUST ME. IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE. AND I CAN PROVE IT. [ GUN COCKS ] LET HIM GO. NOW! RELAX. IF I WANTED TO KILL HIM, HE'D BE ON THE FLOOR. JUST MAKING A POINT. [ GASPING ] [ HISSING ] HEY! THINK SHE'S SO DIFFERENT? [ HISSING ] STILL WANT TO SAVE HER? LOOK AT HER. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME -- EVIL, BLOODTHIRSTY. NO. NO. YOU HEAR HER, GORDON? NO. NO. WE'RE DONE HERE. SAM, GET HER OUT OF HERE. YEAH. UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH. GORDON, I THINK YOU AND I GOT SOME THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. GET OUT OF MY WAY. SORRY. YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT, TOO, BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW. IF YOU WANT THOSE VAMPIRES, YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH ME. FINE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN? YOU DOING THIS FOR A FANG? COME ON, DEAN, WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE HERE. I DON'T THINK SO, YOU SADISTIC BASTARD. YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOUR BROTHER. YOU'RE A KILLER LIKE ME. UGH. OH, SORRY. YOU KNOW, I MIGHT BE LIKE YOU, I MIGHT NOT. BUT YOU'RE THE ONE TIED UP RIGHT NOW. I MISS ANYTHING? EH, NOT MUCH. LENORE GET OUT OKAY? YEAH, ALL OF THEM DID. THEN, I GUESS OUR WORK HERE IS DONE. HOW ARE YOU DOING, GORDIE? GOT TO TINKLE YET? ALL RIGHT. WELL, GET COMFY. WE'LL CALL SOMEONE IN TWO OR THREE DAYS, HAVE THEM COME OUT AND UNTIE YOU. Sam: READY TO GO, DEAN? NOT YET. I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE. WELL, IT'S -- IT'S BEEN REAL. [ SNIFFLES ] [ CLEARS THROAT ] OKAY. I'M GOOD NOW. WE CAN GO. [ CHUCKLES ] SAM. YEAH? CLOCK ME ONE. WHAT? COME ON. I WON'T EVEN HIT YOU BACK. LET'S GO. [ CHUCKLES ] NO. LET'S GO. YOU GET A FREEBIE. HIT ME. COME ON. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST WENT 12 ROUNDS WITH A BLOCK OF CEMENT, DEAN. I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK. I WISH WE NEVER TOOK THIS JOB. IT JUST JACKED EVERYTHING UP. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THINK ABOUT ALL THE HUNTS WE WENT ON, SAMMY, OUR WHOLE LIVES. OKAY. WHAT IF WE KILLED THINGS THAT DIDN'T DESERVE KILLING? YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THE WAY DAD RAISED US. DEAN, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM... ...DAD DID THE BEST HE COULD. I KNOW HE DID. BUT MAYBE HE WASN'T PERFECT. AND THE WAY HE RAISED US, TO HATE THOSE THINGS -- AND, MAN, I HATE THEM. I DO. WHEN I KILLED THAT VAMPIRE AT THE MILL, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. HELL, I EVEN ENJOYED IT. YOU DIDN'T KILL LENORE. NO, BUT EVERY INSTINCT TOLD ME TO. I WAS GONNA KILL HER. I WAS GONNA KILL THEM ALL. YEAH, DEAN, BUT YOU DIDN'T, AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. YEAH. 'CAUSE YOU'RE A PAIN IN MY ASS. [ CHUCKLES ] I GUESS I MIGHT HAVE TO STICK AROUND
