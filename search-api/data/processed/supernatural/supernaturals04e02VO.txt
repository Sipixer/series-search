Ronald Reznick. This is Special Agent Victor Henrickson. You're not gonna go to Hell. Sic him, boys Somebody help me! Getting pretty slick there, Sam. What the hell is going on around here, Ruby? - Who're you? - Castiello. I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition. - I mean what are you? - I'm an angel of the Lord. Why would an angel rescue me from Hell? Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you. Hey, it's Olivia. I'm not in. Leave a message. Olivia, it's Bobby. Call me back, would you? I got something big.</i> I could use your help. You! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Synchro: IceFre@k Then tell me what else it could have been. Look, all I know is I was not groped by an angel. Look, why do you think this Castiello would lie to you about it? Maybe he's some kinda demon. Demons lie. A demon who's immune to salt rounds and devil's traps... And ruby's knife?! Dean, Lilith is scared of that thing! Don't you think if angels were real, that some hunter somewhere would have seen one... At some point... ever?! Yeah. You just did, Dean. I'm trying to come up with a theory. Okay? Work with me. We have a theory. One with a little less fairy dust on it, please. I'm not saying we know for sure. - I'm just saying that I think we... - Okay, okay. That's the point. We don't know for sure so I'm not gonna believe that this thing is a freaking angel of the Lord because it says so! You two chuckleheads want to keep arguing religion, or do you want to come take a look at this? I got stacks of lore... Biblical, pre-biblical. Some of it's in damn cuneiform. It all says an angel can snatch a soul from the pit. What else? - What else, what? - What else could do it? Airlift your ass out of the hot box? As far as I can tell, nothing. - Dean, this is good news. - How? Because for once, this isn't just another round of demon crap. I mean, maybe you were saved by one of the good guys, you know? Okay. Say it's true. Say there are angels. Then what? There's a God? At this point, Vegas money's on yeah. - I don't know, guys. - Okay, look. I know you're not all choirboy about this stuff, but this is becoming less and less about faith and more and more about proof. - Proof? - Yes. Proof that there's a god out there that actually gives a crap about me personally? I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it. Why not? Because why me? If there is a god out there, why would he give a crap about me?! I mean, I've saved some people, okay? I figured that made up for the stealing and the ditching chicks. But why do I deserve to get saved? I'm just a regular guy. Apparently, you're a regular guy that's important to the man upstairs. Well, that creeps me out. I mean, I don't like getting singled out at birthday parties, much less by... God. Okay, well, too bad, because I think he wants you to strap on your party hat. Fine. What do we know about angels? Start reading. You're gonna get me some pie. Yes, Dean, I'll get the chips. Dude. When have I ever forgotten the pie? Exactly. I got to go. Yeah, all right. Bye. - Ruby. - So, is it true? Is what true? Did an angel rescue Dean? You heard. Who hasn't? We're not 100% sure, but I think so. Okay. Bye, Sam. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Wait. What's going on? - Sam... - They're angels. - I'm a demon. They're not gonna care if I'm being helpful. They smite first, and then they ask questions later. - What do you know about them? - Not much. I've never met one, and I don't really want to. All I know is that they scare the holy hell out of me. Watch yourself, Sam. I'm not scared of angels. - Keep the engine running. - Why? - What's going on? - I got a friend one state over... Olivia Lowry. I've been trying to reach her for three days on this angel thing. It's not like her to ignore this many calls. Olivia Lowry... A hunter, right? Yeah. We're gonna go check on her. You guys follow me. - Scoot over. - Yeah. - Dude? - Yeah? Where's the pie? Olivia? Bobby? Salt line. Olivia was rocking the EMF meter. Spirit activity. Yeah... On steroids. I never seen a ghost do this to a person. Bobby, you all right? I called some hunters nearby... - Good. We can use their help. - Except... They ain't answering their phones either. Something's up? You think? Yeah, this is jed. I'm not around. Uh, leave a message.</i> Jed, Dean Winchester again... Friend of Bobby Singer's.</i> Look, we think something's happening. We think it's happening to hunters.</i> Just want to make sure you're okay. Call me back. Yeah, we're at Jed's. It's not pretty. He looks even worse than olivia. What about you? I checked on Carl Bates and R.C. Adams.</i> They've redecorated... In red. What the hell is going on here, Bobby? Why did a bunch of ghosts suddenly want to gank off-duty hunters? I don't know, but until we find out, you guys better get your asses to my place. We're on our way. Hi, Sam. It's been a while. Hi, guys. It's been a while. So, how do we survive? Henriksen. Are you... Did you... I didn't survive... If that's what you're asking. I'm sorry. I know you are. Look, if we'd known Lilith was coming... You wouldn't have left half a dozen innocent people in that police station to die in your place. You did this to me. It was your fault. She was after you, and I paid the price. You left us there to die! Damn it, Bobby! Pick up! How you feeling, huh? How many fingers am I holding up? None. I'll be fine, Dean. - Henriksen? - Yep. Why? What did he want? Revenge 'cause we got him killed. - Well, we did, Dean. - All right. Stop right there. Whatever the hell is going on, it's happening to us now, okay? I can't get a hold of Bobby, so if you're not thinking answers, don't think at all. I'll go. You check outside. Come out, come out, whoever you are. Dean Winchester. Still so bossy. You don't recognize me? This is what I looked like before that demon cut off my hair and dressed me like a slut. Meg? Hi. It's okay. I'm not a demon. - You're the girl the demon possessed. - Meg masters. Nice to finally talk to you when I'm not, you know, choking on my own blood. It's okay. Seriously, i'm just a college girl. Sorry -- was. I was walking home one night and got jumped by all this smoke. Next thing you know, Im a prisoner... In here. Now, I was awake. I had to watch while she murdered people. - I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah? So sorry you had me thrown off a building. - Well, we thought -- - No, you didn't think! I kept waiting, praying! I was trapped in there screaming at you! "Just help me, please!" You're supposed to help people. Why didn't you help me? - I'm sorry. - Stop saying you're sorry! - We didn't know. - No... You just attacked. Did you ever think there was a girl in here? No. You just charged in, slashing and burning. You think you're some kind of hero? No, I don't. You're damn right. Do you have any idea what it's like to be ridden for months by pure evil... ... while your family has no idea what happened to you? We did the best we could. - Are you scared, Bobby? - We were scared, Bobby. - When the monster came for us... - And grabbed us tight. - And we couldn't even scream. - You were right there, Bobby. - You were in the house. - You were so close. You could have saved us, Bobby. - We're here, Bobby?! - You walked right past that door. - The monster had us. - And you didn't find us. And now they won't find you. It wasn't just me, Dean. I had a sister. A little sister. She worshiped me. You know how little siblings are, right? How they'll do anything for you. She was never the Same after I disappeared. She just... She just got lost. And when my body was lying in the morgue, beat-up, broken. Do you know what that did to her? She killed herself! Because of you, Dean! Because all you were thinking about was your family, your revenge, and your demons! 50 words of latin a little sooner, and I'd still be alive. My baby sister would still be alive. That blood is on your hands, Dean! You're right. Hold on, Bobby! I'm coming! Come on, Dean. Did your brain get french-fried in hell? You can't shoot me with bullets. I'm not shooting you. Iron. So, they're all people we know? Not just know. People we couldn't save. Hey, I saw something on Meg. Did she have a tattoo when she was alive? I don't think so. It was like a-a mark on her hand... Almost like a brand. - I saw a mark, too, on Henriksen. - What did it look like? Uh, paper? Thanks. That's it. I may have seen this before. We got to move. Follow me. Okay. Where are we going? Some place safe, you idiot. - Is this... - Solid iron. Completely coated in salt. 100% ghost-proof. You built a panic room? I had a weekend off. What? You're awesome. See, this is why I can't get behind God. What are you talking about? If he doesn't exist, fine. Bad crap happens to good people. That's how it is. There's no rhyme or reason... Just random, horrible, evil -- I get it, okay. I can roll with that. But if he is out there, what's wrong with him? Where the hell is he while all these decent people are getting torn to shreds? How does he live with himself? You know, why doesn't he help? I ain't touching this one with at 10-foot pole. Found it. - What? - The symbol you saw... The brand on the ghosts... Mark of the witness. Witness? - Witness to what? - The unnatural. None of them died what you'd call ordinary deaths. See, these ghosts... They were forced to rise. They woke up in agony. They were like rabid dogs. It ain't their fault. Someone rose them... - On purpose. - Who? Do I look like I know? But whoever it was used a spell so powerful it left a mark, a brand on their souls. Whoever did this had big plans. It's called "the rising of the witnesses." It figures into an ancient prophecy. Wait, wait. What book is that prophecy from? Well, the widely distributed version's just for tourists, you know. But long story short -- Revelations. This is a sign, boys. - A sign of what? - A sign of what? The apocalypse. Apocalypse? As in Apocalypse Apocalypse? The four horsemen, pestilence, $5-a-gallon-gas apocalypse? That's the one. The rise of the witnesses is a... - Mile marker. - Okay, so, what do we do now? Road trip. Grand canyon, star trek experience. Bunny ranch. First things first. How about we survive our friends out there? Great. Any ideas aside from staying in this room until judgment day? It's a spell... to send the witnesses back to rest. - Should work... - Should? Great. ... if I translate it correctly. I think I got everything we need here at the house. Any chance you got everything we need here in this room? So, you thought our luck was gonna start now all of a sudden? Spell's got to be cast over an open fire. - The fireplace in the library. - Bingo. That's just not as appealing as a ghost-proof panic room, you know? Cover each other. And aim careful. Don't run out of ammo until I'm done, or they'll shred you. Ready? Hey, Dean. You remember me? Everybody on the floor now! He's got the laser eyes. Ronald, huh? With the laser eyes? I wish I could say it's good to see you. I am dead because of you. You were supposed to help me! If you're gonna shoot, shoot. Don't talk. Upstairs, linen closet... Red hex box. It'll be heavy. Got it. Kitchen. Cutlery drawer. It's got a false bottom. Hemlock, opium, wormwood. - Opium? - Go! You walked right by us while that monster ate us all up. You could have saved us. You know what really pisses me off, Sam? You saw how I suffered for months. I thought you must have learned something. I thought I died for something. But what you're doing with that demon, Ruby... How many innocent bodies has ruby burned through for kicks? How many girls just like me? And you don't sendher back to hell?! You're a monster! I'm all right, Bobby! Keep working! - Victor. - Dean. - I know. - No. You don't. It's my fault you're dead. I left you behind. And the minute I heard about that explosion, I thought, "I should have known." I should have protected you. Not so fast. You think you left and Lilith came and we all died in a beautiful blast of... white light? If only. 45 minutes. - What? - Over 45 minutes. Lith said she wanted to have some fun. The secretary was first. Remember her? Nancy, the virgin. Lith filleted nancy's skin off piece by piece, right in front of us, made us watch. - Nancy never stopped screaming. - No. That was the last. Victor... Tell me how it's fair. You get saved from hell... I die. Why do you deserve another chance, Dean? You all right? No. Let's go. Ronald. Hey, come on, man. - I thought we were pals. - That's when I was breathing. Now I'm gonna eat you alive. Well... come on, i'm not a cheeseburger. Cover Bobby! Fireplace! Excellent job with the witnesses. You were hip to all this? I was, uh, made aware. Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest. But you didn't. I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos -- You know, Michael Landon. Not dicks. Read the bible. Angels are warriors of god. - I'm a soldier. - Yeah? Then, why didn't you fight? I'm not here to perch on your shoulder. - We had larger concerns. - Concerns? There were people getting torn to shreds down here! And, by the way, while all this is going on, where the hell is your boss, if there is a God? - There's a God. - I'm not convinced. 'Cause if there's a God, what the hell is he waiting for? Genocide? Monsters roaming the earth? The freaking apocalypse? At what point does he lift a damn finger and help the poor bastards that are stuck down here? - The Lord works -- - If you say "mysterious ways," so help me, I will kick your ass. So, Bobby was right... About the witnesses. This is some kind of a... - Sign of the apocalypse. - That's why we're here. Big things afoot. Do I want to know what kind of things? I sincerely doubt it, but you need to know. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals. Okay. I'm guessing that's not a show at seaworld. Those seals are being broken by Lilith. She did the spell. She rose the witnesses. And not just here. - 20 other hunters are dead. - Of course. She picked victims that the hunters couldn't save so that they would barrel right after us. Lith has a certain sense of humor. Well, we put those spirits back to rest. It doesn't matter. The seal was broken. Why break the seal anyway? You think of the seals as locks on a door. Okay. Last one opens and... Lucifer walks free. Lucifer? But I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon sunday school. There's no such thing. Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we're here walking among you now for the first time in 2,000 years? To stop lucifer. That's why we've arrived. Well... Bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses. That's nice. We tried. And there are other battles, other seals. Some we'll win, some we'll lose. This one we lost. Our numbers are not unlimited. Six of my brothers died in the field this week. You think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around? There's a bigger picture here. You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of hell. I can throw you back in. You all right? What's wrong, Dean? So... You got no problem believing in... God and angels? No, not really.
