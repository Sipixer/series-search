She just -- into thin air,you know? What about you? No,same as before. Sorry,man. Ellen did have one thing. A hotel in cornwall,connecticut -- two freak accidents in the past three weeks. Yeah,what's that have to do with ava? It's a job. I mean,a lady drowned in the bathtub, then a few days ago,a guy falls down the stairs, head turns a complete 180,which isn't exactly normal,you know? I don't know -- it might be nothing,but I told ellen we'd think about checking it out. - You did? - Yeah. - You seem surprised. - Yeah,it's just,you know... not the patented sam winchester way,is it? What way is that? Just figured after ava,there'd be,you know, more angst and droopy music and staring out the rainy windows. I'll shut up now. Look,I'm the one who told her to go back home. Now her fianc?s dead, and some demon has taken her offto god knows where,you know? We've been lookingfor a month now,and we got nothing. So I'm notgiving up on her,but I'm not gonna letother people die,either. We got to saveas many people as we can. Wow,that attitudeis just way too healthy for me. I'm officially uncomfortable now. Thank you. All right,call ellen. Tell her we'll take it. Dude,this is sweet. I never get to workjobs like this. Like what? Old-school haunted houses. You know -- fog,secret passageways,sissy british accents. Might even run into fred and daphne while we're inside. Mmm,daphne -- love her. Hey,wait a sec. I'm not so surehaunted's the problem. What do you mean? You seethis pattern here? That's a quincunx. It's a five-spot. - Five-spot. - Yeah. That's for hoodoo spellwork,isn't it? You fill this thingwith bloodweed,you got a charmto ward off enemies. Except I don't seeany bloodweed. Don't you thinkthis place is a little too white-meat for hoodoo? Maybe. May I help you? Hi. Yeah,I'd like a roomfor a couple of nights. Hey! - Sorry about that. - No problem. Well,congratulations. You could besome of our final guests. Well,soundsvaguely ominous. No,I'm sorry. I mean,we're closingat the end of the month. Let me guess -- you guys are here antiquing? So,a king-size bed? What? No.No,no. We're -- two singles. We're just brothers. Oh. Oh,I'm so sorry. What did you meanthat we looked the type? You know,speaking of antiques,you have a really interesting urn on the front porch. - Where did you get that? - I have no idea. It's been there forever. Here you go,Mr. Mahogoff. Yo u'll be stayingin room 237. Sherwin,could you show thesegentlemen to their rooms? Let me guess -- antiquers? - I can give you a handwith that bag. - I got it. - So the hotel'sclosing up,huh? - Yep -- miss susantried to make a go of it,but the guests just don't comelike they used to. Still,it's a damn shame. It may not look it anymore,but this place was a palace. Two different vice-presidents laid their headson our pillows. My parents worked here. I practically grew up here. I'm gonna miss it. Here's your room. Thanks. You're not gonnacheap out on me,are you,boy? What the... what? That's normal. Why the hellwould anyone stay here? I'm amazed they keptin business this long. All right,victim number one -- joan edison,43 years old, a realtor handlingthe sale of the hotel. And victim number twowas larry williams,moving some stuffout to goodwill. They're both tied upin shutting the place down. Yeah,Maybe someonedoesn't want to leave,and they're using hoodooto fight back. Who do you thinkour witch doctor is -- susan? Doesn't seem likely. She's the one selling. So,what,then,sherwin? I don't know. Of course,the most troubling question is,why do these peopleassume we're gay? You are kind of butch. Probably thinkyou're over compensating. Right. Hey. Look at that -- more hoodoo. - Hi,there. - Hi. Everything okaywith your room? - Yeah,yeah. - Yeah,yeah. - Yeah,everything's great. - Good. Well,I was justin the middle of packing.

She would.Huh?Huh? It's true. Okay. Come on in. All right. All right. Wow. This is a lot of dolls. They're nice,you know. They're not supercreepy at all. I supposethey are a little creepy.

Where's grandma rose now? Up in her room. You know,I'd reallylove to talk to rose about her incredible doll -- no. I mean,I'm afraidthat's impossible. My mother's been very sick,and she's not takingany visitors. What do you think? Dolls,hoodoo,mysterious shut-in grandma? Well,dolls are used in all kind of voodooand hoodoo, like cursesand binding spells. Yeah,maybe we foundour witch doctor. I'll go see what I can dig upon granny. You get online,check old obits,freak accidents. - See if she's whacked anybody before. - Right. Don't go surfing porn. It's not the kindof whacking I mean.

We're working a case. That guywho hung himself -- I couldn't save him. What are you talking about? You couldn't have done anything. That's an excuse,dean. I should have founda way to save him. I should havesaved ava,too. Well,you can'tsave everyone. Even you said that. No,dean,you don't understand,all right? The more people I save,the more I can change. - Change what? - My destiny,dean.

Got distracted. Have a drink. Yeah,thanks. So,poor guy,huh,killing himself? That kind of thing seems to begoing around lately. Yeah. Yeah,I heardabout the other ones. It's almost like this hotelis cursed or something. Every hotelhas its spilled blood. If people only knewwhat's gone on in some of those roomsthey've checked into. You know a lot about the place,don't you? Down to the last nail. I'd love to hearsome stories. Boy,you should never say thatto an old man. This is little miss susanand her mother,rose. Happier days. They're not happy now? I don't know. I never really knew one. Well,this is rose's home. Been in the familyover a century. Used to bethe family estate,and now she gets to livein some senior-living graveyard, and they tearthis place down. That's too bad. - I hear roseisn't feeling well,either. - No,she isn'T. What's wrong with her? It's not my businessto say. Who's this? That's rosewhen she was a little girl. Who's that with her? That's her nanny,marie. She looked after rosemore than her own mother. How you feeling,sammy? I guessmixing whiskey and jager wasn't such a gangbuster idea,was it? I'll bet you don't remembera thing from last night,do you? No,I can still taste the tequila. You know,there's a really goodhangover remedy. It's a greasy pork sandwichserved up in a dirty ashtray. - Oh,I hate you. - I know you do. Hey,turns outwhen grandma rose was a tyke, she had a creole nannywho wore a hoodoo necklace.Ugh. - So you thinkshe taught rose hoodoo? - Yes,I do. All right. I think it's timewe talk to rose,then. Oh,you needto brush your teeth first. Hello? Susan? Clear? Mrs. Thompson? Mrs. Thompson? Rose? Hi,Mrs. Thompson. We're not here to hurt you. It's okay. We... rose? Dean. This woman'shad a stroke. Yeah,but hoodoo's hands-on. You got to mix herbs and chant,build an altar. So it can't be rose. - Heck,maybe it's not even hoodoo. - She could be faking. What do you want to do,poke her with a stick? Dude,you're not gonnapoke her with a stick. What the hell? What are you doing in here? We just wantedto talk to rose. Look at her. She's scared out of her wits. I want you out of my hotel,or I'm calling the cops. Your turn. Eightsies. Have youstarted packing yet? - No. - Why not? I don't want to move. Yes,I know,but we have to. But maggie sayswe're not allowed to move. Yeah. Tyler,enough. Maggie is imaginary. You're too oldto have an imaginary friend,and I am done pretending. I don't like her. Okay,then. See you later. - You okay? - I think so. Come on. Come on. Let's get inside. Let's go. - Whiskey. - Sure. I know the feeling. What the hellhappened out there? - You want the truth? - Of course. At first,we thoughtit was a hoodoo curse,but that out there -- that was definitely a spirit. Here. You're insane. It's been said. Look,I'm sorry,susan. We don't exactly have timeto ease you into this, but we need to knowwhen your mother had the stroke. - What does that have to do -- - just answerthe question. About a month ago. Right beforethe killings began. You see? So what if rose was working hoodoo,but not to hurt anyone,to protect them? She was using the urnsto ward off the spirit. - Until she had a strokeand couldn't anymore. - I don't believe this. Listen,that car didn't tryto run you down by itself,okay? I mean,I guess it didtechnically,but with a spirit -- forget it. Believe what you want,but youand your family are in danger. So you need to clear everybodyout of here -- your employees,your mother,your daughters,everyone. I only haveone daughter. - One? - I thought tylerhad a sister named maggie. Maggie's imaginary. Where's tyler? She's going to stay herewith me,and you can't stop me. There's nothingyou can do about it. Maggie,don'T. You're notsupposed to bother grandma. I know. Come on. Let's play. Can we have a tea party? We can have lots of tea parties forever,ever,until ever Tyler! Oh,my god! Tyler! Tyler! She's not here. Susan,tell us what you knowabout maggie. Tyler's been talking about hersince mom got sick. Okay,did you ever knowanyone by that name? Think,think -- somebodythat could have lived here,might have passed away. My god -- my mom had a sisternamed margaret. - She barely spoke about her. - Did margaret die herewhen she was a kid? Yeah,she drownedin the pool. Come on. I don't like it up here. I'm scared. It's okay. All you have to dois jump. I can't swim. I know. But it won't hurt. I promise. And then we can be togetherforever,and no one will bother us. Why don't you justcome with me and mommy? Because I can't leave here,and you can't leave me. Please. I don't want to be alone. Tyler! Tyler! Mommy! Is thereanother entrance? Around back. All right,let's go. Keep working.

We just got to get grandma. I don't get it. Did maggie just stop? Seems like it. Where the helldid she go? Paramedics saidit was another stroke.

Ready to go,kiddo? Yeah. Tyler,you're sure maggie'snot around anymore? I'm sure. I'd see her. I guess whatever's going onmust be over. You two take care of yourselves,all right? Thank you. Yeah. Both of you. Think you could have hooked upsome milf action there,bud. Serious,I think she liked you. Yeah,that's all she needs. Well,you saved the mom,you saved the girl.
