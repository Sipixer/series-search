She doesn't like you very much? - How long did they gave you? - One year. Did you know? About Dean's deal? - That Lilith holds the contract? - Yes. You got two months left, dean. You're not gonna go to hell. It's not Ruby. It's Lilith! - Where's Ruby? - I sent her far, far away. Sic him, boy. Somebody help me! Sam! Help! Help! Help. www.seriessub.com Hello? September... We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected. - Bobby? - <i>Yeah.</i> It's me. - <i>Who's "me"?</i> - Dean. Who is this? - Bobby, listen to me. - <i>This ain't funny.</i> Call again and I'll kill you. Surprise. I don't... Yeah, me neither. But here I am. Bobby, it's me! My ass. Wait! Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed. You're about the closest thing I have to a father. It's me. - I am not a shapeshifter. - Then you're a revenant! If I was either, would I do this with a silver knife? That's what I've been trying to tell you. It's... It's good to see you, boy. Yeah, you too. But... How did you bust out? I don't know. I just, uh... Just woke up in a pine bo... I'm not a demon, either, you know. Sorry. Can't be too careful. That don't make a lick of sense. Yeah, you're preaching to the choir. Your chest was ribbons, your insides were slop, and you'd been buried four months. Even if you could slip out of hell and back into your meats -- I know. I should look like a "thriller" video reject. What do you remember? Not much. I remember I was a hellhound's chew toy... And then lights-out. Then I come to six feet under. That was it. Sam's number's not working. He's... He's not... Oh, he's alive, as far as I know. Good. What do you mean... As far as you know? - I haven't talked to him for months. - You're kidding? - You just let him go off by himself? - He was dead set on it. You should have been looking after him. I tried. These last months haven't been exactly easy, you know, for him or me. We had to bury you. Why did you bury me, anyway? I wanted you salted and burned... Usual drill... But sam wouldn't have it. I'm glad he won that one. He said you'd need a body when he gotou back home somehow. - That's about all he said. - What do you mean? He was quiet... Real quiet. Then he just took off. Wouldn't return my calls. I tried to find him, but he don't want to be found. Oh, damn it, Sammy. What? Oh, he got me home okay. But whatever he did, it is bad mojo. - What makes you so sure? - You should have seen the grave site. It was like a nuke went off. Then there was this... This force, this presence, that, I don't know, but it... It... It blew past me at a fill-up joint. And then this. What in the hell? Yeah, it's like a demon just yanked me out or rode me out. But why? - To hold up their end of the bargain. - You think Sam made a deal? It's what I would have done. Yeah, hi. I have a cellphone account with you guys and, uh, lost my phone. I was wondering if you could turn the gps on for me. Yeah. The name's "Wedge Antilles." Social is 2474. Thank you. How'd you know he'd use that name? You kidding me? What don't I know about that kid? What's the deal with the liquor store? Your parents out of town or something? Like I said... The last few months ain't been... All that easy. Right. Sam's in Pontiac, Illinois. - Right near where you were planted. - Right where I popped up. Hell of a coincidence, don't you think? So, where is it? Where's what? The pizza that takes two guys to deliver. I think we got the wrong room. Hey, is... Hey, ya, Sammy. - Who are you?! - Like you didn't do this! - Do what?! - It's him. It's him, Sam. I've been through this already. It's really him. But... I know. I look fantastic, huh? So, are you two, like... Together? What? No. No. He's my brother. Got it... I-I guess. Look, I should probably go. Yeah, yeah. That's probably a good idea. Sorry. So, call me. Yeah, sure thing, kathy. Christie. Right. So, tell me, what'd it cost? The girl? I don't pay, Dean. That's not funny, sam. To bring me back. What'd it cost? Was it just your soul, or was it something worse? - You think I made a deal? - That's exactly what we think. Well, I didn't. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying. So, what now? I'm off the hook, and you're on, is that it? You're some demon's bitch boy? I didn't want to be saved like this. Look, Dean, I wish I had done it, all right? There's no other way that this could have gone down. - Now tell the truth! - I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the devil's gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in hell for months... For months... And I couldn't stop it. So, I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right? Dean, I'm sorry. It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to apologize. I believe you. Don't get me wrong... I'm glad that Sam's soul remains intact, but... That does raise a sticky question. If he didn't pull me out, then what did? So what were you doing around here if you weren't digging me out of my grave? Well, once I figured out I couldn't save you, I started hunting down Lilith, trying to get some payback. All by yourself? Who do you think you are, your old man? Yeah, I'm sorry. I should have called. I was pretty messed up. Oh, yeah. I really feel your pain. Anyways... I was checking these demons out of tennessee, and out of nowhere they took a hard left, booked up here. - When? - Yesterday morning. When I busted out. You think these demons are here 'cause of you? But why? Well, I don't know. Some badass demon drags me out, and now this? It's got to be connected somehow. How you feeling, anyway? I'm a little hungry. No, I mean, do you feel like yourself? - Anything strange or different? - Or demonic? How many times do I have to prove I'm me? No demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts. They got to have something nasty planned. I feel fine. Look, we don't know what they're planning. We got a pile of questions and no shovel. We need help. I know a psychic a few hours from here. Something this big, maybe she's heard the other side talking. - Hell, yeah. It's worth a shot. - I'll be right back. Hey, wait. You probably want this back. Thanks. Don't mention it. Hey, Dean, what was it like? What? Hell? I don't know. I must have blacked it out. I don't remember a damn thing. Thank god for that. Yeah. She's about four hours down the interstate. Try to keep up. I assume you'll want to drive. I almost forgot. Hey, sweetheart, did you Miss me? What the hell is that? That's an ipod jack. You were supposed to take care of her, not douche her up. Dean, I thought it was my car. Really? Tthere still one thing that's bothering me. The night that I bit it -- Or got bit -- How'd you make it out? I thought lilith was gonna kill you. Well, she tried. She couldn't. What do you mean she couldn't? She fired this, like, burning light at me... And... It didn't leave a scratch, like I was immune or something. Immune? I don't know who was more surprised -- her or me. She left pretty fast after that. What about Ruby? Where is she? Dead or in hell. So, you been using your, freaky E.S.P. stuff? No. Sure about that? Now that you got immunity... Whatever the hell that is... Just wondering what other kind of weirdo crap you got going on. Nothing, dean. Look, you didn't want me to go down that road, I didn't go down that road. It was practically your dying wish. Yeah, well, let's keep it that way. You're a sight for sore eyes. So, are these the boys? Sam, Dean... Pamela barnes. Best damn psychic in the state. - Hey. - Hi. Dean Winchester. Out of the fire and back in the frying pan, huh? Makes you a rare individual. If you say so. Come on in. So, you hear anything? Well, I ouija-ed my way through a dozen spirits. No one seems to know who broke your boy out or why. - So, what's next? - A s√©ance, I think. See if we can see who did the deed. You're not gonna summon the damn thing here? No. I just want to get a sneak peek at it, like a crystal ball without the crystal. I'm game. Who's jesse? It wasn't forever. His loss. Might be your gain. - Dude, I'm so in. - She's gonna eat you alive. Hey, I just got out of jail. Bring it. You're invited, too, grumpy. You are not invited. Take each other's hands. And I need to touch something our mystery monster touched. Whoa! Well, he didn't touch me there. My mistake. I invoke, conjure, and command you... Appear unto me before this circle. I invoke, conjure, and command you... Appear unto me before this circle. I invoke, conjure, and command you... Appear unto me before this circle. I invoke, conjure, and command... Castiello? No. Sorry, Castiello, I don't scare easy. Castiello? Its name. It's whispering to me, warning me to turn back. I conjure and command you... Show me your face. I conjure and command you... Show me your face. I conjure and command you... Show me your face. - I conjure and command you... - Maybe we should stop. I almost got it. I command you... Show me your face. Show me your face now! Call 911. I can't see. I can't see! I'll be up in a jiff. Yeah, you bet. - What'd bobby say? - Pam's stable and out of ICU. And blind 'cause of us? We still have no clue what we're dealing with. - That's not entirely true. - No? We got a name -- Castiello or whatever. With the right mumbo jumbo, we can summon him, bring him to us. You're crazy. Absolutely not. We'll work him over. I mean, after what he did? Pam took a peek at him and her eyes burned out of her skull, and you want to have a face-to-face? - You got a better idea? - Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. I followed some demons to town, right? So we go find them. Someone's got to know something about something. Thanks. You angling for a tip? I'm sorry. I thought you were looking for us. To hell and back. Aren't you a lucky duck? That's me. So, you get to just stroll out of the pit? Tell me, what makes you so special? I like to think it's because of my perky nipples. I don't know. It wasn't my doing. I don't know who pulled me out. Right. You don't. No, I don't. Lying's a sin, you know. I'm not lying. But I'd like to find out. So if you wouldn't mind enlightening me, flo. Mind your tone with me, boy. I'll drag you back to hell myself. No, you won't. 'cause if you were, you'd have done it already. The fact is, you don't know who cut me loose. And you're just as spooked as we are. And you're looking for answers. Maybe it was some turbocharged spirit? Or, uh, Godzilla. Or some big, bad boss demon. But I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. 'cause whoever it was, they want me out... And they're a lot stronger than you. So, go ahead. Send me back. But don't come crawling to me when they show up on your front doorstep with some vaseline and a fire hose. I'm gonna reach down your throat and rip out your lungs. That's what I thought. Let's go, Sam. For the pie. Holy crap, that was close. We're not just gonna leave them in there, are we? There's three of them, probably more. We only got one knife between us. I've been killing a lot more demons than that lately. Not anymore. The smarter brother's back in town. Dean, we got to take them. - They are dangerous. - They're scared, okay? Scared of whatever had the juice to yank me out. We're dealing with a bad mofo here. One job at a time. How you doing, kid? Aside from the church bells ringing in my head... Peachy. What are you doing? - Couldn't sleep. Went to get a burger. - In my car? Force of habit. What are you doing up? Well, uh, bobby's back. We're going to grab a beer. All right. Well, uh, spill some for me, huh? Done. Yeah, i'll catch you later. Why the hell didn't you tell him? - 'cause he'd just try to stop us. - From what? Summoning this thing. It's time we face it head on. - You can't be serious. - As a heart attack. - It's high noon, baby. - We don't know what it is. I-it could be a demon. It could be anything. That's why we got to be ready for anything. We got the big-time magic knife. You got an arsenal in the trunk. This is a bad idea. I couldn't agree more, but what other choice do we have? We could choose life. Bobby, whatever this is, whatever it wants, it's after me... That much we know, right? Well, I got no place to hide. I can either get caught with my pants down again, or we can make our stand. - We could use Sam for this. - Nah, he's better off where he is. Your eyes. I could still smell your soul a mile away. Who was here? - You saw it. - I saw it. What was it? It's the end. We're dead. We're all dead. What did you see? Go to hell. Funny... I was gonna say the same thing to you. Damn it. Getting pretty slick there, Sam. Better all the time. What the hell's going on around here, Ruby? I wish I knew. We were thinking some high-level demon pulled dean out. No way. Human souls don't just walk out of hell and back into their bodies easy. This guy bleeds, the ground quakes... It's cosmic. No demon can swing that. Not Lilith... Not anybody. Then what can? Nothing I've ever seen before. That's a hell of an art project you got going there. Traps and talismans from every faith on the globe. How you doing? Stakes, iron, silver, salt, a knife... I mean, we're pretty much set to catch and kill anything I've ever heard of. This is still a bad idea. Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first 10 times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell? Amate spiritus obscure... So, million-dollar question -- You gonna tell dean about what we're doing? Yeah, I just got to figure out the right way to say it. Look, I just need time, okay? That's all. He's gonna find out, and if it's not from you, he's gonna be pissed. Oh, he's gonna be pissed anyway. He's so hardheaded about this psychic stuff, he'll just try and stop me. Look, maybe I'll just take a step back for a while. I mean, I'm not exactly in your brother's fan club, but he is your brother, and i'm not gonna come between you. I don't know if what I'm doing is right. - I don't even know if I trust you. - Thanks. What I do know is I'm saving people... And stopping demons. And that feels good. I want to keep going. You sure you did the ritual right? Sorry. Touchy, touchy, huh? Wishful thinking, but maybe it's just the wind. Who are you? I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition. Thanks for that. We need to talk, Dean. Alone. Your friend is alive. Who are you? Castiello. Yeah, I figured that much. I mean what are you? I'm an angel of the lord. Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing. This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith. Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes. I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... Overwhelming to humans and so can my real voice... But you already knew that. You mean the gas station and the motel? That was you talking? Buddy, next time, lower the volume. That was my mistake. Certain people... Special people... Can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong. And what visage are you in now? What... Holy tax accountant? This? This is... a vessel. You're possessing some poor bastard? He's a devout man. He actually prayed for this. Look, pal, I'm not buying what you're selling. So who are you, really? I told you. Right. And why would an angel rescue me from hell? Good things do happen, Dean. Not in my experience. What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved. Why'd you do it? Because God commanded it.
