- Castiel. - I mean what are you? - I'm an angel of the lord. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals. Those seals are being broken by lilith. - Last one opens and... - Lucifer walks free. So, you been using your, - freaky E.S.P. stuff? - No. Yeah, well, let's keep it that way. - I'm just exorcising demons. - with your mind! I can send them back to hell. - But try to see the other side here. - The other side?! I'm pulling demons out of innocent people. - Use the knife! - The knife kills the victim. What I do, most of them survive! You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of hell. I can throw you back in. - How was the store? - Oh, madness. Everyone in town was stocking up. Did, uh, you get enough? I had to arm-wrestle norma bleaker for these. Honey, she's 74. And a lot stronger than she looks. Remember last year? We ran out at 6:30. It's just one piece. You can have as much as you want... After halloween. No. Oh, who needs a bath? Oh, there we go! - You coming? - I'll, uh, i'll be up in a minute. Okay. Luke, what's taking you so long? Oh, my god! Synchro VO: IceFre@k Now, how many razor blades did they find? Two on the floor, one in his stomach, and... one was stuck in his throat. He swallowed four of them. How is that even possible? The candy was never in the oven. We just have to be thorough, mrs. Wallace. Did the police find any razors in the rest of the candy? No. I mean, I don't know. I don't think so. I just... I can't believe it. You hear urban legends about this stuff, but it actually happens? More than you might imagine. Mrs. Wallace, did luke have any enemies? Enemies? Anyone who might have held a grudge against him? - What do you mean? - Co-workers. Neighbors. Maybe a woman. Are you suggesting an affair? - Is it possible? - No! No, luke would nev-- I'm very sorry. We just have to consider all possibilities. If someone wanted to kill my husband, don't you think they'd find a better way than a razor in a piece of candy he might eat? Really? After that guy choked down all those razor blades? It's halloween, man. Yeah. For us, every day is halloween. Don't be a downer. Anything interesting? We're on a witch-hunt, that's for sure. But this isn't your typical hex bag. No? Goldthread... An herb that's been extinct for 200 years. And this is celtic, and I don't mean some new age knock-off. Looks like the real deal. Like... 600-years-old real. And, uh... That is the charred metacarpal bone of a newborn baby. Oh, gross. Relax, man. It's, like, at least 100 years old. Oh, right, like that makes it better? Witches, man. They're so freaking skeevy. Well, it takes a pretty powerful one to put a bag like this together. More juice than we've ever dealt with before, that's for sure. What about you... Find anything on the victim? This luke wallace -- He was so vanilla that he made vanilla seem spicy. I can't find any reason why somebody would want this guy dead. This party blows. We should just go t. P. Somebody. - Uh, hey, justin. - Yo. You break into the booze yet? Uh, it's triple-locked. So, you guys going to the mausoleum party tomorrow night? Are you gonna be there? It's gonna be rad. I'm gonna get so baked. Well, it's got to be better than this g-rated assfest. Oh, come on, it's not that bad. Oh, check it out. Okay, bobbing for apples is lame. Oh, come on, it's halloween. Uh... lame. I stand corrected. Well, I want to try. She can really hold her breath. Jenny? Help me! Jenny, what's wrong? Help! Come on, let's go! What is happening? Jenny, come on! Help! Jenny! Oh, my god. Yes. I got this one. Two words... Jail bait. I would never. You know, it's just so weird. I mean, the water in the tub... It wasn't hot. I had just been in there myself. You friend didn't happen to know a man named luke wallace? Agent seger... FBI. Um, who's luke wallace? He died yesterday. I don't know who that is. I'm telling you, both of these vics are squeaky-clean. There was no reason for wicked-bitch payback. Maybe 'cause it's not about that. Wow. Insightful. Maybe this witch isn't working a grudge. Maybe they're working a spell. Check this out. "Three blood sacrifices over three days... The last before midnight on the final day of the final harvest." Celtic calendar... The final day of the final harvest is october 31st. - Halloween? - Exactly. What exactly are the, uh, blood sacrifices for? Uh, if I'm right, this witch is summoning a demon. And not just any demon -- Samhain. Am I supposed to be impressed? Dean, samhain is the damn origin of halloween. The celts believed that october 31st was the one night of the year when the veil was thinnest between the living and the dead. And it was samhain's night. Masks were put on to hide from him, sweets left on doorsteps to appease him, faces carved into pumpkins to worship him. He was exorcised centuries ago. So even though samhain took a trip downstairs, the tradition stuck. Exactly. Only now, instead of demons and blood orgies, halloween is all about kids, candy, and costumes. Okay, so some witch wants to raise samhain and take back the night? - Dean, this is serious. - I am serious. We're talking heavyweight witchcraft. This ritual can only be performed every 600 years. And the 600-year marker rolls around... - Tomorrow night. - Naturally. It sure is a lot of death and destruction for one demon. That's 'cause he likes company. Once he's raised, Samhain - can do some raising of his own. - Raising what, exactly? Dark, evil crap and lots of it. They follow him around like the friggin' pied piper. So we're talking ghosts. Zombies? - Leprechauns? - Dean. Those little dudes are scary. Small hands. It just starts with ghosts and ghouls. This sucker keeps on going, by night's end, we are talking every awful thing we've ever seen, everything we fight all in one place. It's gonna be a slaughterhouse. How's it going? Awesome. Yeah, I talked with mrs. Razor blade again.</i> I've been sitting out in front of her house for hours, and I've got a big, steamy pile of nothing. Someone planted those hex bags, someone with access to both houses. - There's got to be some connection. - Yeah, well, I hope we find him soon 'cause I'm starting to cramp like a... Son of a bitch. Quit whining. No, sam, I mean "son of a bitch." So? Our apple-bobbing cheerleader? Tracy? The wallaces' babysitter. She told me she'd never even heard of luke wallace. Interesting look for a centuries-old witch. If you were a 600-year-old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in, wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader? I would. Well, tracy's not as wholesome as she looks. Did some digging. Apparently, she got into a violent altercation with one of her teachers. Got suspended from school. Bring back memories? What do you mean? Being a teenager, all that angst. Oh. What'd you think I meant? Nothing. Now, that brings back memories. Dude, I need a bigger kiln. You gentlemen wanted to talk to me? Ah, Mr. Harding. Oh, please. Don. - Okay, don. - Even my students call me don. Yeah, we get it, don. Uh, I'm agent geddy. This is agent lee. We just had a few questions about, uh, tracy davis. Uh, yeah, tracy. Uh, bright kid, loads of talent. It's a shame she got suspended. You two had a, uh, violent altercation. Yeah, she exploded. Uh, if principal murrow hadn't walked by when he did, - Tacy would have clawed my eyes out. - Why? You know, I was only trying to rap with her about her work. It had gotten inappropriate and disturbing. More disturbing than -- Than, uh, those guys? She would cover page after page with these bizarre cryptic symbols. And then there were the drawings... Detailed images of killings, gory, primitive. She would depict herself in the middle of them, participating. Symbols? What kind of symbols? Uh, anything like this? Yeah. Yeah, I think that might have been one of them. - You know where tracy is now? - I would imagine her apartment. - Her apartment? - Yeah. She got here about a year ago alone, as I understood it, as an emancipated teen. God only knows what her parents were like. So? Tracy was nowhere I could find. Any luck with her friends? Luck is not our style. Friends don't know where she is. It's like the bitch hopped a broom. She could be making the third sacrifice any time. Yes, thank you, sam. Trick or treat. This is a motel. So? So we don't have any candy. - No, we have a ton in the, uh -- - We did, but it's gone. Sorry, kid, we can't help you. I want candy. Well, I think you've had enough. Who are you?! Sam, sam, wait! It's castiel... The angel. Him, I don't know. Hello, sam. Oh, my god. Er, uh, I didn't mean to -- Sorry. It's an honor. Really, I-I've heard a lot about you. And i, you. Sam winchester -- The boy with the demon blood. Glad to hear you've ceased your extracurricular activities. Let's keep it that way. Yeah, okay, chuckles. - Who's your friend? - This raising of samhain -- Have you stopped it? Why? Dean, have you located the witch? - Yes, we've located the witch. - And is the witch dead? - No, but... - We know who it is. Apparently, the witch knows who you are, too. This was inside the wall of your room. If we hadn't found it, surely one or both of you would be dead. Do you know where the witch is now? - We're working on it. - That's unfortunate. What do you care? The raising of samhain is one of the 66 seals. So this is about your buddy lucifer. Lucifer is no friend of ours. It's just an expression. Lucifer cannot rise. The breaking of the seal must be prevented at all costs. Okay. Great. Now that you're here, why don't you tell us where the witch is? - We'll gank her, everybody goes home. - We are not omniscient. This witch is very powerful. She's cloaked, even to our methods. Okay, well, we already know who she is. - So, if we work together -- - Enough of this. Who are you, and why should I care? This is uriel. He's what you might call... A specialist. What kind of a specialist? What are you gonna do? You -- both of you, you need to leave this town immediately. Why? Because we're about to destroy it. So this is your plan, you're gonna smack the whole freakin' town. We're out of time. This witch has to die. The seal must be saved. - There are a thousand people here. - 1,214. And you're willing to kill them all? This isn't the first time I've... Purified a city. Look, I understand this is regrettable. - Regrettable? - We have to hold the line. Too many seals have broken already. So you screwed the pooch on some seals, and now this town has to pay the price? It's the lives of 1,000 against the lives of 6 billion. - There's a bigger picture here. - Right... 'cause, uh, you're bigger-picture kind of guys. Lucifer cannot rise. He does, and hell rises with him. Is that something that you're willing to risk? We'll stop this witch before she summons anyone. Your seal won't be broken, and no one has to die. We're wasting time with these mud monkeys. I'm sorry. - But we have our orders. - No, you can't do this. You -- you're angels. I mean, aren't you supposed to -- You're supposed to show mercy. Says who? We have no choice. Of course you have a choice. I mean, come on, what, you've never... Never questioned a crap order? What are you both, just a couple of hammers? Look, even if you can't understand it, have faith the plan is just. - How can you even say that? - Because it comes from heaven. That makes it just. It must be nice to be so sure of yourselves. Tell me something. When your father gave you an order, didn't you obey? Sorry, boys, it looks like the plans have changed. You think you can stop us? No. But if you're gonna smite this whole town... Then you're gonna have to smite us with it because we are not leaving. You went to the trouble of busting me out of hell. I figure I'm worth something to the man upstairs. You want to waste me? Go ahead. See how he digs that. I will drag you out of here myself. Yeah, but you'll have to kill me. Then we're back to the same problem. I mean, come on. You're gonna wipe out a whole town for one little witch? Sounds to me like you're compensating for something. We can do this. We will find that witch. We will stop the summoning. - Castiel, I will not let these -- - Enough. I suggest you move quickly. Astronaut! What? Nothing. I thought they'd be different. - Who, the angels? - Yeah. Well, I tried to tell you. I just -- I mean, I thought they'd be righteous. Well, they are righteous. I mean, that's kind of the problem. Of course, there's nothing more dangerous than some a-hole who thinks he's on a holy mission. But, I mean, this is god and heaven? This is what I've been praying to? Look, man, I know you're into the whole god thing and jesus on a tortilla and stuff like that. But just because there's a couple of bad apples doesn't mean the whole barrel is rotten. I mean, for all we know, god hates these jerks. Don't give up on the stuff is all I'm saying. Babe ruth was a dick, but baseball's still a beautiful game. Are you gonna figure out a way to find this witch, or are you just gonna sit there fingering your bone? You know how much heat it would take to char a bone like this, dean? No. A lot. I mean, more than a fire or some kitchen oven. Okay, betty crocker, what does that mean? It means we make a stop. So, tracy used a kiln to char the bone? What's the big deal? That hex bag turned up in our room not after we talked to tracy... After we talked to the teacher. Oh, my god. Those are all from children. I'm guessing he's not saving them for the dog. The decision's been made. By a mud monkey. You shouldn't call them that. Oh, That's what they are -- Savages, just plumbing on two legs. You're close to blasphemy. There's a reason we were sent to save him. He has potential. He may succeed here. At any rate... It's out of our hands. It doesn't have to be. And what would you suggest? That we drag dean winchester out of here, then we blow this insignificant pinprick off the map. You know our true orders. Are you prepared to disobey? Thank you. He was gonna kill me. Ugh, that sick son of a bitch. I mean, did you see what he was doing? Did you hear him... How sloppy his incantation was? My brother always was a little dim. He was gonna make me the final sacrifice. His idea. But now, that honor goes to him. Our master has returned. This spellwork's a two-man job, you understand? So for 600 years, I had to deal with that pompous son of a bitch. Planning, preparing -- Unbearable. The whole time, I wanted to rip his face off. And... ... you get him with a gun. Oh, I love that. You know, back in the day, this was the one night you kept your children inside. Well, tonight, you'll all see what halloween really is. What -- what are you doing? Just follow my lead. My love. You've aged. This face... I can't fool you. Your beauty is beyond time. Whore. What the hell was that? Halloween lore. People used to wear masks to hide from him, so I gave it a shot. You gave it a shot? How are we gonna find this mook? Where would you go to raise all the dark forces of the night? - A cemetery. - Yeah. - So, this demon's pretty powerful. - Yeah. It might take more than the usual weapons. Sam, no. You're not using your psychic whatever. But -- Don't even think about it. Ruby's knife is enough. - Why? - Because the angel said so, for one. - You said they were fanatics. - they happen to be right about this I don't know. Doesn't seem they're right about much. - Forget the angels, okay? - You said yourself, these powers -- It's like playing with fire. Please. Dude, i'm tripping balls. Yo, shh. Be quiet. It's the cops. Mr. Harding? I mean... don? Uh, don, you, uh -- You locked us in. Help them. - Dude, you're not going off alone. - Do it. Stand back! Stand back! Come on, come on, get out! Move! Bring it on, stinky. Yeah. That demon-ray-gun stuff... Doesn't work on me. Zombie-ghost orgy, huh? Well, that's it. I'm torching everybody. Tomorrow is november 2nd. That's an anniversary for you, right? What are you doing here? It's the day azazel killed your mother, and 22 years later, your girlfriend, too. It must be difficult to bear, yet you brazenly use the power he gave you, his profane blood pumping through your veins. Excuse me? You were told not to use your abilities. What was I supposed to do? That demon would have killed me and my brother and everyone. You were told not to. If samhain had gotten loose in this town -- Been warned twice now. You know, my brother was right about you. You are dicks. The only reason you're still alive, Sam winchester, is because you've been useful. The moment that ceases to be true, the second you become more trouble than you're worth, one word... One... And I will turn you to dust. As for your brother, tell him that maybe he should climb off that high horse of his. Ask dean... What he remembers from hell. Let me guess. You're here for the "i told you so." No. Well, good, 'cause I'm really not that interested. I am not here to judge you, dean. Then why are you here? Our orders -- I've had enough of these orders of yours. Our orders... Were not to stop the summoning of samhain. They were to do whatever you told us to do. Your orders were to follow my orders? It was a test... To see how you would perform under... Battlefield conditions, you might say. It was a witch... Not the tet offensive. So, i, uh, failed your test, huh? I get it. But you know what? If you were to waive that... That magic time-traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again, i'd make the same call... 'cause, see, I don't know what's gonna happen when these seals are broken. Hell, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is is that this here -- These kids, the swings, the trees, all of it... Is still here because of my brother and me. You misunderstand me, dean. I'm not like you think. I was praying that you would choose to save the town. You were? These people -- They're all my father's creations. They're works of art. And yet... Even though you stopped samhain, the seal was broken, and we are one step closer to hell on earth for all creation. And that's not an expression, dean. It's literal. You of all people should... Appreciate what that means. I'll tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul. Okay. I'm not, uh... A hammer, as you say. I have questions. I... I have doubts. I don't know what is right and what is wrong anymore... And whether you passed or failed here. But in the coming months, you will he more decisions to make.
