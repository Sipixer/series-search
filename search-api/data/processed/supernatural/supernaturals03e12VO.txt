Okay, i promise you, whoever's out there is not here to help us. Look, you got to believe us. Everyone here is in terrible danger. Why don't you let us out of here so we can save your asses? From what? You gonna say "demons"? Don't you dare say "demons." Let me tell you something. You should be a lot more scared of me. How's the shoulder? It's awesome. I'll live. You know, if we get out of here alive. So, you got a plan? Uh, please. Please. We need your help. It's... it's nancy. Nancy, right? Nancy, my... my brother's been shot.

Thanks. Let her go! Let her go! You okay, nance? Try something again, get shot. And not in the arm. What the hell was that? We're like sitting ducks in here. Yeah, i know. Would it kill these cops to bring us a snack?! - How many you figure are out there? - I don't know. However many there are, they could be possessing anyone. Anyone could just walk right in. It's kind of wild, right? I mean, it's like they're coming right for us. They've never done that before. It's like we got a contract on us. Think it's because we're so awesome? I think it's 'cause we're so awesome. Well, howdy, there, sheriff. - Uh, sheriff? - It's time to go, boys. Uh... you know what? We're just comfy right here. But thank you. What do you think you're doing? We're not just gonna sit around here and wait to die. We're gonna make a run for it. - It's safer here. - There's a swat facility in boulder. - We're not going anywhere. - The hell we're not. Stay back! - Hurry up! - It's too late. I already called them. They're already coming. Is he... Is he dead? Henriksen. Hey. Is that you in there? I shot the sheriff. But you didn't shoot the deputy. Five minutes ago, i was fine, and then... Let me guess... some nasty black smoke Jammed itself down your throat? You were possessed. Possessed like... Possessed. That's what it feels like. Now you know. I owe you the biggest "i told you so" ever. Officer amici. Keys. All right. So, how do we survive? Well, that's nice. It's not gonna do much good. - We got an arsenal here. - You don't poke a bear with a bb gun. - That's just gonna make him mad. - What do you need? - Salt. Lots and lots of salt. - Salt? What, is there an echo in here? There's road salt in the storeroom. Perfect. Perfect. We need salt at every window and every door. How you holding up, nancy? Okay. When i was little, I would come home from church and talk about the devil. My parents would tell me to stop being so literal. I guess i showed them, huh? That should hold. Thank you. Hey, where's my car? Impound lot out back. Wait. You're not going out there? Yeah. I got to get something out of my trunk. They're coming! Hurry! - Everybody okay? - Define "okay." All right, everybody needs to put these on. They'll keep you from being possessed. What about you and sam? - Smart. - How long you had those? Not long enough. Hey, that's jenna rubner. It's not jenna anymore. That's where all that black demon smoke went? Looks like. Shotgun shells full of salt. - Whatever works. - Fighting off monsters with condiments. So, turns out demons are real. F.Y.I... ghosts are real, too. So are werewolves, vampires, changelings, Evil clowns that eat people. Okay, then. If it makes you feel better, bigfoot's a hoax. It doesn't. How many demons? Total? No clue. A lot. You know what my job is? You mean besides locking up the good guys? I have no idea. My job is boring. It's frustrating. You work three years for one break, And then maybe you can save... a few people. Maybe. That's the payoff. I've been busting my ass for 15 years To nail a handful of guys, and all this while, There was something off in the corner so big. So, yeah. Sign me up for that big, frosty mug of wasting my damn life. You didn't know. Now i do. What's out there? Can you guys beat it? Can you win? Honestly, i think the world's gonna end bloody. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't fight. We do have choices. I choose to go down swingin'. Plus, you got nothing to go home to but your brother. Yeah. What about you? You rockin' the white picket fence? Empty apartment, string of angry ex-Wives. I'm right where you are. Imagine that. - How do we kill her? - We don't. - She's a demon. - She's here to help us. Are you kidding? Are you gonna let me out? And they say chivalry's dead. Does anyone have a breath mint? Some guts splattered in my mouth While i was killing my way in here. - How many are out there? - 30, at least. That's so far. Oh, good. 30. 30 hit men, all gunning for us. Who sent them? You didn't tell dean? I'm surprised. - Tell me what? - There's a big new up-And-Comer. Real pied piper. - Who is he? - Not he. Her. - Her name is lilith. - Lilith? And she really, really wants sam's intestines on a stick. 'Cause she sees him as competition. You knew about this? Well, gee, sam, is there anything else i should know?! How about the two of you talk about this later? We'll need the colt. Where's the colt? - It got stolen. - I'm sorry. I must have blood in my ear. I thought i just heard you say that you were stupid enough To let the colt get grabbed out of your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands. Fantastic. This is just peachy. - Ruby... - Shut up. Fine. Since i don't see that there's any other option, There's one other way i know how to get you out of here alive. - What's that? - I know a spell. It'll vaporize every demon in a one-Mile radius... Myself included. So, you let the colt out of your sight, and now i have to die. So, next time, be more careful. How's that for a dying wish? Okay. What do we need to do? You can't do anything. This spell is very specific. It calls for a person of virtue. I got virtue. Nice try. You're not a virgin. Nobody's a virgin. No. No way. - You're kidding me. You're... - What? It's a choice, okay? So, y-You've never... Not even once? I mean, not even... So, this spell... What can i do? You can hold still. While i cut your heart out of your chest. - What? - What are you, crazy? - I'm offering a solution. - You're offering to kill somebody. And what do you think's gonna happen to this girl when the demons get in? - We're gonna protect her. That's what. - Very noble. - Excuse me. - You're all gonna die. Look, this is the only way. - Yeah, yeah. There's no way that you're gonna... - Would everybody please shut up?! All the people out there... Will it save them? It'll blow the demons out of their bodies. So if their bodies are okay... yeah. I'll do it. - No, no. You don't need to do this. - Hell no! - All my friends are out there. - We don't sacrifice people. We do that, we're no better than them. We don't have a choice. - Yeah, well, your choice is not a choice. - Sam, you know i'm right. Sam. What the hell is going on? Sam, tell her. It's my decision. Damn straight, cherry pie. Stop! Stop! Nobody kill any virgins! Sam, i need to talk to you. Please tell me you're not actually considering this. We're talking about holding down a girl and cutting out her heart. And we're also talking about 30 people out there, dean... Innocent people who are all gonna die, along with everyone in here. It doesn't mean that we throw away the rule book and stop acting like humans. I'm not gonna let that demon kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl Who hasn't even been laid. I mean, look, if that's how you win wars, then i don't want to win. Then what? What do we do, dean? I got a plan. I'm not saying it's a good one. I'm not even saying that it'll work. But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin. Okay, so, what's the plan? Open the doors, let them all in... And we fight. - Get the equipment to work? - Yeah. - So? - So, this is insane. You win "understatement of the year." Look, i get it. You think... I don't think... i know. It's not gonna work. So long, boys. - So, you're just gonna leave? - Hey. I was gonna kill myself to help you win. I'm not gonna stand here and watch you lose. And i'm disappointed... because i tried. I really did. But, clearly, i bet on the wrong horse. Do you mind letting me out? I'm leaving. Who wants to stop me? All set?! Yeah! Let's do this! God, i hope this works. Go! Go! Go! When this is over, i'm gonna have so much sex. But not with you. We better move. Henriksen, now! I better call in. Hell of a story i won't be telling. So, what are you gonna tell them? The least ridiculous lie i can come up with in the next five minutes. Good luck with that. Not to pressure you or anything, - But what are you planning to do about us? - I'm gonna kill you. Sam and dean winchester were in the chopper when it caught on fire. Nothing's left. Can't even identify them with dental records. Rest in peace, guys. Now get out of here. Yeah. Oh. Hey, there. Excuse me. I'm looking for two boys. They're brothers.
