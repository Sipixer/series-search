DU, I'M LIKE DILLINGER OR SOMETHING. DEAN, IT'S NOT FUNNY. IT MAKES THE JOB HARDER. WE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL NOW. WELL, WHAT DO THEY GOT ON <i>YOU?</i> I'M SURE THEY JUST HAVEN'T POSTED IT YET. NO ACCESSORY, NOTHIN SHUT UP. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU'RE JEALOUS. NO, I'M NOT! UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU GOT ON THE CASE THERE, YOU INNOCENT, HARMLESS YOUNG MAN, YOU? "ARCHITECT SEAN BOYDEN PLUMMETED TO HIS DEATH "FROM THE ROOF OF HIS HOME -- A CONDOMINIUM HE DESIGNED." BUILD A HIGH-RISE AND JUMP OFF -- THAT'S CLASSY. WHEN DID HE CALL ANIMAL CONTROL? TWO DAYS EARLIER. DID HE ACTUALLY SAY "BLACK DOG"? YEAH. "VICIOUS, WILD, BLACK DOG." THE AUTHORITIES COULDN'T FIND IT, AND NO ONE ELSE SAW IT. IN FACT, THE AUTHORITIES ARE A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO HOW A WILD DOG COULD GET PAST THE DOORMAN, TAKE THE ELEVATOR UP, AND START ROAMING THE HALLS OF THE CUSHIEST JOINT IN TOWN. AFTER THAT, NO MORE CALLS. HE DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK. TWO DAYS LATER, HE TAKES A SWAN DIVE. YOU THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH AN ACTUAL BLACK DOG? WELL, MAYBE. WHAT'S THE LORE ON IT? IT'S ALL PRETTY VAGUE. THERE ARE SPECTRAL BLACK DOGS ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT SOME SAY THEY'RE ANIMAL SPIRITS, OTHERS SAY DEATH OMENS. BUT ANYWAYS, WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY'RE BIG, NASTY... YEAH, BET THEY COULD HUMP THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR LEG. LOOK AT THAT ONE. HUH? [ CHUCKLES ] WHAT? THEY COULD. SO, YOU AND SEAN BOYDEN WERE BUSINESS PARTNERS FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. NOW, ONE MORE TIME, THIS IS FOR... A TRIBUTE FOR MR. BOYDEN -- ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST. FUNNY TO YOU? NO, IT -- IT'S JUST A TRIBUTE. YEAH. SEE, SEAN ALWAYS GOT THE TRIBUTES. HE KILLS HIMSELF, LEAVES ME AND HIS FAMILY BEHIND, BUT HE GETS ANOTHER TRIBUTE. RIGHT. ANY IDEA WHY HE'D DO SUCH A THING? I HAVE NO CLUE. HE LIVED A CHARMED LIFE. HOW SO? HE WAS A FLAT-OUT GENIUS. I MEAN, I'M CAPABLE, BUT, NEXT TO HIM, UH... IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY EITHER. NO? YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? THERE WAS A TIME WHERE HE ULDN'T EVEN DESIGN A PUP TENT. HELL, 10 YEARS AGO, HE WAS WORKING AS A BARTENDER AT TS PLACE CALLED LLOYD'S, A COMPLETE DIVE. SO, WHAT CHANGED? YOU GOT ME. BUT OVERNIGHT HE GETS THIS HUGE COMMISSION, AND HE STARTS DESIGNING -- HE STARTS DESIGNING THE MOST INGENIOUS BUILDINGS ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. IT WAS LIKE THE LEVEL OF VAN GOGH AND MOZART. IT... WHAT? IT'S FUNNY -- TRUE GENIUSES, THEY SEEM TO DIE YOUNG, DON'T THEY? TO HAVE THAT KIND OF TALENT, WHY... WHY JUST THROW IT AWAY? SO? THE SECRETARY'S ME IS CARLY. SHE'S 23. SHE KAYAKS... AND THEY'RE REAL. YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ASK HER IF SHE'S SEEN ANY BLACK DOGS, DID YOU? EVERY COMPLAINT CALLED IN THIS WEEK ABOUT ANYTHING BIG, BLACK, OR DOGLIKE. THERE'S 19 CALLS IN ALL, AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS. YOU MEAN, CARLY'S MySpace ADDRESS? YEAH, MySpace -- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? SERIOUSLY, IS THAT LIKE SOME SORT OF PORN SITE? I SWEAR, IF THIS IS ANOTHER FREAKIN' POMERANIAN BARKING IN THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD... AFTERNOON, MA'AM. UH, ANIMAL CONTROL. OH, SOMEONE ALREADY CAME YESTERDAY. OH, WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING UP. WE'RE LOOKING FOR DR. SYLVIA PERLMAN. THE DOCTOR, WELL, SHE -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN SHE'LL BE BACK. SHE LEFT TWO DAYS AGO. OKAY. AND YOU ARE? I'M MISS PERLMAN'S MAID. SO, WHERE DID THE DOCTOR GO? I'M NOT SURE. SHE JUST PACKED AND WENT. SHE DIDN'T SAY WHERE. THAT STRAY DOG, DID YOU FIND IT FINALLY? UH, NOT YET. YOU DIDN'T EVER HAPPEN TO SEE THE DOG YOURSELF, DID YOU? WELL, NO. I NEVER EVEN HEARD IT. I WAS ALMOST STARTING TO THINK THE DOCTOR WAS IMAGINING THINGS, BUT SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT, SO... YOU KNOW, I READ SHE WAS THE CHIEF SURGEON AT THE HOSPITAL. SO SHE'S GOT TO BE, WHAT, 42, 43? THAT'S PRETTY YOUNG FOR THAT JOB. YOUNGEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLACE. SHE GOT THE POSITION 10 YEARS AGO. AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS, 10 YEARS AGO. YEAH, WE KNOW A GUY LIKE THAT. OH, LOOK AT THIS. LLOYD'S BAR. MISS PERLMAN? I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR HOURS! YOU NEED TO VACATE THE ROOM, OR YOU GOT TO PAY FOR THE NIGHT! OKAY, NO PROBLEM. HEY. YEAH? THAT'S WEIRD. WHAT? THINK SOMEONE PLANTED THESE? IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE WEEDS? THESE ARE, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM? YARROW FLOWERS? YEAH. USED FOR CERTAIN RITUALS, AREN'T THEY? YEAH, ACTUALLY, SUMMONING RITUALS. SO, TWO PEOPLE BECOME SUDDEN SUCCESSES ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THEY WERE HANGING OUT HERE AT LLOYD'S. WHERE THERE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A CROSSROADS. YOU THINK? LET'S FIND OUT. SEEM ABOUT THE DEAD CENTER TO YOU? YAHTZEE. I'D BE WILLING TO BET THAT'S GRAVEYARD DIRT. AND A BLACK CAT BONE. THAT'S SERIOUS SPELLWORK. I MEAN, THAT'S DEEP SOUTH HOODOO STUFF. USED TO SUMMON A DEMON. NOT JUST SUMMON ONE. CROSSROADS ARE WHERE PACTS ARE MADE. THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING DEALS WITH THE DAMNED THING. [ Sarcastically ] YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT ALWAYS ENDS GOOD. THEY'RE SEEING DOGS, ALL RIGHT... BUT NOT BLACK DOGS. THEY'RE SEEING HELLHOUNDS -- DEMONIC PIT BULLS. WHOEVER THIS DEMON IS, IT'S BACK AND IT'S COLLECTING. AND THAT DOCTOR LADY, WHEREVER SHE'S RUNNING, SHE AIN'T RUNNING FAST ENOUGH. HOLY... HOLY? I WANT TO PLAY GUITAR. I WANT TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. SO...HOW DO WE -- DO WE SHAKE ON IT? Sam: SO, IT'S JUST LIKE THE ROBERT JOHNSON LEGEND, RIGHT? I MEAN, "SELLING YOUR SOUL AT THE CROSSROADS" KIND OF DEAL? EXCEPT THAT WASN'T A LEGEND. YOU KNOW HIS MUSIC. YOU DON'T KNOW ROBERT JOHNSON SONGS? SAM, THERE'S OCCULT REFERENCES ALL OVER HIS LYRICS. I MEAN, "CROSS ROAD BLUES," "ME AND THE DEVIL BLUES," "HELLHOUND ON MY TRAIL"? STORY GOES THAT HE DIED CHOKING ON HIS OWN BLOOD. HE WAS HALLUCINATING AND MUTTERING ABOUT BIG, EVIL DOGS. AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN. YEAH. WE GOT TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE ELSE STRUCK ANY BARGAINS. RIGHT, SO, WE GOT TO CLEAN UP THESE PEOPLE'S MESS FOR THEM? THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY SQUEAKY-CLEAN. NOBODY PUT A GUN TO THEIR HEAD AND FORCED THEM TO PLAY "LET'S MAKE A DEAL." SO, WHAT, WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEM TO DIE? SOMEBODY GOES OVER NIAGARA IN A BARREL, YOU GONNA JUMP IN TO TRY TO SAVE THEM? DEAN... ALL RIGHT...FINE. RITUALS LIKE THIS, YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR OWN PHOTO INTO THE MIX, RIGHT? SO THIS GUY PROBABLY SUMMONED THE THING. LET'S SEE IF ANYONE INSIDE KNOWS HIM... IF HE'S STILL ALIVE. WHAT'S THIS GUY'S NAME, AGAIN? GEORGE DARROW. APPARENT QUITE THE REGULAR AT LLOYD'S. THIS HOUSE PROBABLY AIN'T UP NEXT ON "MTV CRIBS," IS IT? [ Chuckling ] YEAH. SO, WHATEVER KIND OF DEAL HE MADE...

PLEASE, JUST 5 MINUTES. SO, WHAT IS THAT STUFF OUT FRONT? GOOFER DUST. WHAT, YOU BOYS THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING, BUT NOT GOOFER DUST?

MAYBE IT'LL DO YOU SOME GOOD. 4 MINUTES LEFT. MR. DARROW... WE KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. YEAH, THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO. BUT IT'S NOT HOPELESS, ALL RIGHT? THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO. LISTEN, I GET THAT YOU BOYS WANT TO HELP, BUT SOMETIMES A PERSON MAKES THEIR BED AND THEY JUST GOT TO LIE DOWN IN IT. I'M THE ONE CALLED THAT DEMON IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT'D YOU DO IT FOR? I WAS WEAK. I MEAN, WHO DON'T WANT TO BE GREAT? WHO DON'T WANT THEIR LIFE TO MEAN SOMETHING? I JUST... [SIGHS] I JUST NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRICE. WAS IT WORTH IT? HELL, NO.

I NEVER COUNTED ON THAT. AFTER OUR DEAL WAS DONE, THE DAMN THING STAYED AT LLOYD'S FOR A WEEK, JUST CHATTING, MAKING MORE DEALS. I TRIED TO WARN FOLKS, BUT WHO GONNA LISTEN TO AN OLD DRUNK?

YOU DID IT TO SAVE HER? SHE HAD CANCER. THEY HAD STOPPED TREATMENT. THEY WERE MOVING HER INTO HOSPICE. THEY KEPT SAYING, "MATTER OF DAYS." SO, YEAH, I MADE THE DEAL... AND I'D DO IT AGAIN. I'D HAVE DIED FOR HER ON THE SPOT. DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HER IN ALL THIS? I DID THIS FOR HER. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? I THINK YOU DID IT FOR YOURSELF... SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT HER. BUT, GUESS WHAT, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT <i>YOU</i> NOW. WHAT IF SHE KNEW HOW MUCH IT COST? WHAT IF SHE KNEW IT COST YOUR SOUL? HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'D FEEL? OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

I'M GONNA GO TO THE CROSSROADS AND SUMMON THE DEMON. SUMMON -- ARE YOU NUTS? MAYBE A LITTLE. BUT I CAN TRAP IT. I CAN EXORCISE IT, AND I CAN BUY US TIME TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT. YEAH, BUT HOW MUCH TIME? I DON'T KNOW. AWHILE. IT'S NOT EASY FOR THOSE SUCKERS TO CLAW THEIR WAY BACK FROM HELL AND INTO THE SUNSHINE. NO. NO WAY. NOT ALLOWED TO SAY NO, SAMMY, UNLESS YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA. DEAN, YOU CAN FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT LETTING YOU SUMMON THAT DEMON BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT RIGHT NOW. ???? YOU'VE BEEN ON EDGE EVER SINCE WE FOUND THAT CROSSROADS, DEAN, AND I THINK I KNOW WHY. WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. DAD. YOU THINK MAYBE DAD MADE ONE OF THESE DEALS, HUH? HELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING IT.
