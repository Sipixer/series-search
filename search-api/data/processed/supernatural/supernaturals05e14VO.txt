- The horsemen - Which one rides the red horse? - War. - You can't kill war, kiddos! We know. - The ring. - The ring. You can't stop thinking about it. Ever since you saw it dripping off that knife. Blood, blood, blood. I'm not some junkie! I think that the "Dean and Sam" story sucks! It is not fun. It's not entertaining. It is a river of crap that would send most people howling to the nuthouse! - How many people do you have to save? - All of 'em. How do you get up in the morning? That's a good question. I'm just tired, man. And I'm done. I am just done. First date. I had a really good time tonight, Russell. Can I see you again? Sunday, maybe? I just don't want to be alone on Valentine's day... Again. I know what you mean. I'm sorry, I just... I don't want you to think I'm the type of person who... No, I should apologize... Oh, God. I respect the crap out of you right now. Shut up! Your neck! I think I bit you. It's okay. It's good. I've been so alone. So empty... I know. Me too. I want you... All of you... - Inside me... - Yes. = 514 = = Supernatural Team = So... You found the bodies? There was blood everywhere. And... Other stuff... I think Alice was already dead. But Russell wasn't? I think he was, mostly. Except... He was still sort of... Chewing a little. How could two people even do that... - Eat each other to death? - That's a really good question. Now, the last few days, did you notice her acting erratically? - How do you mean? - I mean, did she seem... Unusually hostile, aggressive? No way. Alice never drank, never even swore. She was a nice girl. And I'm talking, like, a nice girl... Like she still had her promise ring, if you know what I mean. - She was a virgin? - No premarital. I used to wonder how she did it. I mean, you know, didn't do it. It was her first date in months. She was so excited. Apparently, they were both pretty excited. How'd it go? No EMF, no sulfur. Ghost possession and demonic possession are both probably out. - That's where I was puttin' my money. - Nope. What, then? Dude! At the coroner's... You didn't see these bodies. I mean, these two started eating and they just... Kept going. Their stomachs were full. Like... Thanksgiving-dinner full. Talk about co-dependent. We got our feelers out. Not much more we can do tonight. All right. I'm just gonna go through some files. You can go ahead and get going. Sorry? Go ahead. Unleash the kraken. See you tomorrow. - Where am I going? - Dean, it's Valentine's day. Your favorite holiday, remember? What do you always call it... Unattached drifter Christmas? Be that as it may... I don't know. Guess I'm not feeling it this year. So you're not into bars full of lonely women? I guess not. - What? - It's when a dog doesn't eat... You know something's wrong. Remarkably patronizing concern. Duly noted. Nothing's wrong. We gonna work or what? No me gusta. - Have you been proofing this, Jimbo? - Sorry? Tell me you are not checking your cellphone again! She's got you on a leash. I'm not. She just wants to know where I am. She wants to know that you're whipped. - It's not like that. - It's like... - Brad, just give me two minutes. - No, man. No. I'm the project leader on this, and I'm not gonna half-ass it 'cause my wingman has gone mental over some chick he meta week ago. Jim? Holy crap. Where were you? I know. It's just I had to... You can't choose work over me, Jim! I won't, Janice. I'm sorry... Jimbo, due respect, but honestly, bro... - What are we gonna do, Jimmy? - I don't know, baby. Seems like whatever we do, something in life is always gonna keep us apart... Work, family, sleep. Now prison, maybe... Maybe. I have an idea. How we can stay together... Forever... - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Agent Marley, you just can't stay away. Heard you tagged another double suicide. - I've just closed them up. - Dr. Corman, this is my partner. - Special agent Cliff. - Agent Cliff. I've finished my prelims. I pulled the organ sets and sent off the tox samples. - You mind if we take a look? - Not at all. But like I said, their... Good-and-plenties are already tupperwared. - Super. - Leave the keys with Marty up front. And please, gentlemen... Refrigerate after opening... Be my Valentine? Wait a second. These hearts both have identical marks. Check this out. It looks like a letter. What? I think it's enochian. You mean like angel scratches? Like the tagging on our ribs? Dean, I don't know. Cass, it's Dean. Room 31-c, basement level, St. James medical center. I'm there now. I get that. I'm gonna hang up now. Right. You're right, Sam. These are angelic marks. You'll find similar marks on the other couples as well. What are they? what do they mean? It's a mark of union. This man and woman were intended to mate. But who put them there? Your people call them Cupid. A what? What human myth has mistaken for Cupid is actually a lower order of angel. Technically it's a cherub, third-class. - Cherub? - Yeah, they're all over the world. There are dozens of them. You mean the little flying fat kid in diapers? They're not incontinent. Anyway. So, What you're saying... What I'm saying is a cupid has gone rogue. And we have to stop him. Before he kills again. Naturally. Of course we do. You just happen to know he likes the cosmos at this place? This place is a nexus of human reproduction. It's exactly the kind of... Garden the cupid will come to pollinate. Wait a minute. You're not hungry? - What? I'm not hungry. - You're not gonna finish that? He's here. - Where? - I don't see anything. There. The same-side-of-the-booth couple over there? Meet me in the back. - Cass, where is he? - I have him tethered. Zoda kama mahrana. Manifest yourself. So, where is he? Here I am! - Help! - Help is on the way. Yes, it is. Hello, you! - This is Cupid? - Yes. And look at you? - Is this a fight? Are we in a fight? - This is their handshake. - I don't like it. - No one does. What can I do for you? - Why are you doing this? - Doing what? Your targets. The ones you've marked. They're slaughtering each other. What? They are? Listen, birthday suit, we know. You been flittin' around, popping people with your poison arrow, - making them murder each other! - We don't know why. You think that I... I don't know what to say. - Should somebody maybe go talk to him? - Good idea, give 'em hell, Cass. We didn't mean to... Hurt your feelings. Love is more than a word to me. I love love. I love it! If that's wrong, I don't wanna be right! Of course. - I have no idea what you're saying. - I was just on my appointed rounds. What my targets do after that, it's nothing to do with me. I was following my orders. Please, brother. Read my mind. Read my mind, you'll see. - He's telling the truth. - Jiminy Christmas, thank you. Wait, you said you were just following orders? Whose orders? Heaven, silly. Heaven. Why does heaven care if Harry meets Sally? Mostly they don't. Certain bloodlines, certain destinies. - Like yours. - What? The union of John and Mary Winchester... Very big deal upstairs, top priority arrangement. - You fixed-up our parents? - Well, not me, but... It wasn't easy, either. They couldn't stand each other. When we were done with them, perfect couple. Perfect? They're dead! I'm sorry, but... The orders were very clear. You and Sam need to be born. Your parents were just... Meant to be. A match made in heaven, heaven! Son of a bitch! Where is he? Where'd he go? I believe you upset him. - Upset him? - Dean. Enough! - You just punched a Cupid! - I punched a dick! Are we gonna talk about what's been up with you lately or not? Or not. You wanted to hear about any other weird ones. Lester Finch. Pulled his records. This gentleman used to weigh 400 pounds or so, till he got a gastric bypass, which brought down his weight. But then for some reason, last night, he decided to go on a Twinkie binge. So, he died from a Twinkie binge? After he blew out the band around his stomach, he filled it up till it burst. When he could no longer swallow, he started jamming the cakes down his gullet with a... With a toilet brush. Like he was ramrodding a cannon. So, what do you make of it? I'd say that it was a very peculiar thing to do. So, this guy was not marked by Cupid, but his death is definitely suspicious. I just went through the police blotter, and counting him, that's eight suicides since Wednesday and 19 ODs. Way out of the average. If there's a pattern here, it ain't just love. It's bigger than we thought. See you in 10. I know what you are, damn it. I could smell you. What does a demon got to do with this, anyway? Believe me, I got no idea. You okay? I'll be all right. Let's crack her open. What's the worst that could happen? - What was that? - It's a human soul. It's starting to make sense. - Now, what about that makes sense? - When did you start eating? Exactly. My hunger. It's a clue, actually. For what? This town is not suffering from some love-gone-wrong effect. It's suffering from hunger. Starvation, to be exact. Specifically... - Famine. - Famine? As in the horseman? Great. That's great. I thought famine meant starvation, like as in, you know, food. Yes, absolutely. But not just food. Everyone seems to be starving for something. Sex, attention, drugs, - love. - Well, that explains the puppy-lovers that Cupid shot up. Right. The cherub made them crave love, and then famine came, and made them rabid for it. But what about you? Since when do angels secretly hunger for white castle? It's my vessel. Jimmy. His... appetite for red meat has been touched by famine's effect. So, famine just rolls into town and everybody goes crazy? "And then will come famine "riding on a black steed. "He will ride into the land of plenty. "And great will be the horseman's hunger, "for he is hunger. "His hunger will seep out and poison the air." Hungry. Famine's hungry. He must devour the souls of his victims. That's what was in the briefcase. The Twinkie dude's soul? Lucifer has sent his demons to care for famine, to feed him, make certain he'll be ready. Ready for what? To march across the land. Hungry. Sam Winchester. The vessel. He's here. - Where? - At the hospital. We fought, but he got away. I got this off him. Good. Yes. After lunch. Now, where is it? Sorry? The one who loves cream cake so much. Where is his soul? I am sorry, no. The Winchester took the case from me. He had the knife. I lost it. But I'm hungry! I'll get another. I won't be 10 minutes. Hungry! Now! Delicious! Famine? This whole town is just gonna eat, drink, and screw itself to death? We should stop it. That's a great idea. How? How did you stop the last one? War got his mojo from this ring. After we cut it off, he tucked tail and ran. And everybody that was affected, it was like they woke up out of a dream. - You think famine's got one, too? - I know he does. Let's track him down and get to chopping. - What are you, the hamburglar? - I've developed a taste for beef. - Well, have you even tried to stop it? - I can stop anytime I want. Whatever. Sam, let's roll. I can't. I can't go. What do you mean? I think it got to me. I think I'm hungry for it. - For what? - You know. Demon blood? You got to be kidding me. Get him out of here. Beam him anywhere but here. It won't work, he's infected. The hunger is gonna travel with him. What do we do? You go cut that bastard's finger off. You heard him. Before you go, you better... You better lock me down. But good. Hang in there, we'll be back as soon as we can. Be careful. And hurry. Hey, Marty. Is Dr. Corman around? - You haven't heard? - Heard what? Guy's been dry for the last 20 years. But this morning, he left work, went home, and drank himself to death. It's famine. Pardon? - Give us a minute, please? - Sure. Crap! I liked this guy. They haven't harvested his soul yet. If we wanna play "follow the soul" to get to famine, our best shot starts with the doc, here. Are you serious? These make me... Very happy. - How many is that? - I lost count. It's in the low hundreds. What I don't understand is where is your hunger? Slowly but surely, everyone in this town is falling prey to famine, but so far, you seem unaffected. When I wanna drink, I drink. When I want sex, I go get it. Same goes for a sandwich or a fight. You're saying you're just well-adjusted? God, no. I'm just well-fed. There. Guys? What happened? I don't think it worked. I think I'm still... - Still hungry. - Look at this. Someone trussed you up for us. Boss says we can't kill you. But I bet we can break off a few pieces. Get him off! Get him off! Wait your turn. Demons. You want to go over the plan again? Happy meal! The plan? I take the knife, I go in, I cut off the ring hand of famine, and I meet you back here. Well, that sounds foolproof. This is taking too long. The other Mr. Winchester. What did you do to him? You sicced your dog on me. I just threw him a steak. So this is your big trick? Making people cuckoo for cocoa puffs? Doesn't take much. Hardly a push. America... All-you-can-eat, all the time. Consume, consume. A swarm of locusts in stretch pants. And yet, you're all still starving because hunger doesn't just come from the body, it also comes from the soul. It's funny, it doesn't seem to be coming from mine. I noticed that. Have you wondered why that is? How you could even walk in my presence? I like to think it's because of my strength of character. I disagree. I see. That's one deep, dark... Nothing you got there, Dean. Can't fill it, can you? Not with food or drink, not even with sex. You're so full of crap. You can smirk and joke and lie to your brother, lie to yourself, but not to me! I can see inside you, Dean. I can see how broken you are, how defeated. You can't win, and you know it. But you just keep fighting. Just... Keep going through the motions. You're not hungry, Dean, because inside, you're already... Dead. Let him go. Stop! No one lays a finger on this sweet little boy. Sam, I see you got the snack I sent you. - You sent? - Don't worry. You're not like everyone else. You'll never die from drinking too much. You're the exception that proves the rule. Just the way... Satan wanted you to be. So... Cut their throats. Have at them! Please, be my guest. Well... Fine. If you don't want them... Then I'll have them. I'm a horseman, Sam. Your power doesn't work on me. You're right. But it will work on them. Help... Help! Guys... If you're out there, please... Help! That's not him in there. Not really. I know. Sam just has to get it out of his system. - Then he'll be... - Listen, I just... I just need to get some air. Please...
