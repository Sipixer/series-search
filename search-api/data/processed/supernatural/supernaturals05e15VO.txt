they're prelude to what? - The four horsesen. - And which one rides the red horse? War. This town is suffering from famine. - As in the horseman? - Great. The angel of death must be brought into this world through a place of awful carnage. Hello, death - Bobby, who is that? - She's my wife. It's the end of the world. And if I don't stop it and save everyone, then no one will and we all die. I'm just tired, man. I'm done. I am just done. I need some help. Here on the savanna, the wildebeest lounges, lazy and self-content... And oblivious to the fierce predator that stalks him from the shadows. The predator is the cheetah... ... Perhaps smaller than other big cats, but the world's fastest land mammal, Capable of speeds up to 70 miles per hour. Finally, the slow-witted wildebeest begins to sense the danger it's in, but... Who are closing in for the kill. When it attacks, it attacks quickly. Please! God! No! = 515 = = Supernatural Team = Bobby, listen, when you get this message, call! Is he still not home? How far could he get in that chair? So, what do we do? Guess we just do it ourselves. Mr. Wells, why don't you tell us what you saw in your own words. - Call me digger. - Digger? - Who gave you that name? - I did. You gave yourself your own nickname? You can't do that. Who died and made you queen? Why don't you just tell us what you saw? I saw Clay Thompson climb into Benny sutton's trailer through the window. Couple minutes later, Clay walked out, and Benny's dead. And... Is this the guy you saw? He was all covered with mud, but, yeah. That's Clay. And you are aware that Clay Thompson died five years ago? Yep. And you're positive that it was this guy. - You calling me a liar? - No. Of course not. Look. Can you think of any reason why Clay Thompson... alive or dead... would want to kill Benny Sutton? Hell, yeah. Five years ago, Benny's the one that killed Clay in the first place. Is that a fact? Yeah, so-called "hunting accident." Now, if you ask me... Clay came back from the grave to get a little payback. Go on. Owen, put down the cupcake and pick up an apple. Okay. I love you. Heads up. "Fargo." - Digger. - Sheriff. Gentlemen. I'm sheriff Jody Mills. I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Agents Dorfman and Neidermeyer. FBI Welcome to Sioux Falls, gentlemen. Can I ask you what you're doing with digger here? They doing their job. They believe me... sheriff. The FBI believes a dead man committed a murder? We're just asking a few questions. That's all. If a dead man didn't commit the murder then who did? What'd you say your jurisdiction here was again? Our jurisdiction is wherever the United States government sends us. How'bout me and your supervisor have a little chat about that? Absolutely. Agent Willis speaking. Agent Willis, this is sheriff Jody Mills... Bobby? Excuse me? Is this Bobby Singer? Listen, I don't know who this is, but... This is Agent Tom Willis of the FBI. Bull crap. FBI? So... So you know Bobby singer? That is... A fun coincidence. Here's what I know about Bobby Singer. He's a menace around here... Ass-full of drunk-and-disorderlies and mail fraud. - You understanding me? - I think we all can agree that you've made yourself perfectly clear, yes. So, whatever the three of you are planning, it ends here. Now! Ten-four on that, agents? Yeah. You know how many times we called? Where have you been? Playing murderball. What's that smell? Is that soap? - Did you clean? - What are you, my mother? - Bite me! - Bobby, seriously. I been working. Trying to find a way to stop the devil. Find anything? What do you think? Bobby, it's just there's a case less than five miles from your house. What, the the Benny Sutton thing? - That's what this is about? - You knew about this? Hell, yes. I checked into it already. There's nothing here. Except a witness who saw a dead guy commit murder. - What witness? Digger Wells? - Yeah. So? So, he's a drunk. What about the lightning storms? - They look like omens. - Except in February in South Dakota in storm season. Guys, I thought it was something, too. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. So who killed the guy? Take your pick. This Benny Sutton guy was a grade-a son of a bitch. There's a list of the living a year long wouldn't mind putting a cap in his ass. So, you're telling us... nothing? Sorry. Looks like you wasted a tank of gas on this one. All right. What's up? Isn't that the graveyard back there? Yeah. So what? Bobby already checked it out. And? What, Bobby's never wrong? Come on. We'll take a peek, and then we'll hit the road. Can't hurt. - That look fresh to you? - Yeah, actually. What is going on here? I don't know, but something stinks. Don't shoot me! Please! There's money in the safe. - We don't want your money. - What do you want? Anything. Please... You're Clay Thompson, right? Who are you? - FBI. - FBI? Oh, my God. This is about Benny. What about Benny? He killed me! He shot me in the back! I'm supposed to let him get away with that? Hold up. Are you confessing? Please. I'll go with you. Just don't wake my kids. You'll go with us where? Jail. Let me get this straight. You're Clay Thompson, and you died five years ago? And three days ago you climbed out of your grave, and you killed Benny Sutton? So you are, in fact, a dead guy. I guess. I don't know what I am. Clay? I called 911. It's okay, honey. These men are the FBI. They're here about Benny. Why don't you come with us, Mr. Thompson? I think that'd be best. Dean. He's a monster. He's a soccer dad. What do you want to do with him? Freeze! Drop your guns! Remember the guy you said that was dead and couldn't possibly commit murder? There he is. And? "And"? And you're welcome... for catching the undead killer zombie. Whatever he is or isn't that don't give you the right to shoot him - in the middle of the street. - Shoot me? - You're free to go. - Free to go? I can't believe you were gonna kill me. - You're a zombie! - I'm a taxpayer! So, what? Sheriff's on the take? Yeah. No. The zombies are paying her off? So, what? Now they're friends? Bobby, I thought the sheriff hated you? She did till five days ago. What happened five days ago? The dead started rising all over town. So you knew about this? Yep. I think what Sam meant to say is, you lied to us? Look... I told you there was nothing here. And there isn't. Not for you. There are zombies here. There's zombies... And then there's zombies. Come with me. You want to tell us what the hell... I didn't realize you were bringing company. 00 A.M., babe. You didn't need to cook. Oh, pl I'lletre pome mo lates. Who was that? Karen. My wife. Your new wife? My dead wife. This is incredible, Mrs. Singer. Thank you, Dean. What? It is. It's great, Karen. Thanks. Could you, just give us a minute? Are you crazy? What the hell? - Dean, I can explain. - Explain what? Lying to us? Or the American girl zombie making cupcakes in your kitchen?! First of all, that's my wife, so watch it. Bobby, whatever that thing is in there, it is not your wife. - And how do you know that? - Are you serious? You think I'm an idiot, boy? My dead wife shows up on my doorstep, I'm not gonna test her every way I ever learned? - So what is it? Zombies? Revenant? - Hell if I can tell. She's got no scars, no wounds, no reaction to salt, silver, Holy water... Bobby, she crawled out of her coffin. No, she didn't. I cremated her. Somehow, some way, she's back. That's impossible. - Tell me about it. - You bury her ashes? - Yeah. - Where? In the cemetery. That's where they all rose from. How many? 15, 20. I made a list. There's Karen... Clay... Sheriff Mills... her little boy came back. And there were no signs? No omens? There were the lightning storms. That's what we said. What else? "And through the fire stood before me a pale horse. And he that sat atop him carried a scythe, and I saw since he had risen, they, too, shall rise, and from him and through him." So, what, death is behind this? Li imke "gr reaper" death? Awesome. Another horseman. Must be Thursday. Bobby... Why would death raise 15 people in a podunk town like Sioux Falls? I don't know. You know, if death is behind this, then whatever these things are... It's not good. You know what we have to do here. She doesn't remember anything. - What do you mean? - Being possessed. Me killing her... Her coming back. Bobby... No, no, don't "Bobby" me. Just... Just listen, okay? She hums when she cooks. She always... Used to hum when she cooked. Tone deaf as all hell, but... And I never thought I would hear it again. Look, just read revelation. The dead rise during the apocalypse. There's nothing in there that says that's bad! Hell, maybe it's the one good thing that comes out of this whole bloody mess. And what would you do if you were us? I know what I'd do. And I know what you think you got to do. But... I'm begging you. Please. Please. Leave her be. So, what do you think? There's nothing to think about. I'm not gonna leave Bobby at home - with the bride of frankenstein. - Then what do you want to do? Just walk in there in front of Bobby and blow her skull off? If she decides that Bobby's face is the blue plate special, I'd like to be there. Fine. See what else we can find out. - Oops. Did I scare you? - No. There's... Nothing scary about you at all. Feel like some lunch? I'm good. Thanks. Come on there's more pie. I don't think that Bobby wants me inside. Guess it'll have to be our secret, then? Come on. I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that you like pies. Did you bake all these? I don't know what it is. Since I got back, I can't stop baking. - When do you have time to sleep? - I don't. Must be the excitement. Or being dead. You don't trust me. - Why would you say that? - Come on, Dean. That's why you're here. Keeping an eye on me? I know who you are. Just like I know Bobby's not the same mild-mannered scrap dealer I married. You hunt things. I'm a thing. I get it. Then you know that Sam and I would never let anything happen to him. - He's like a father to us. - I understand. He's lucky to have you looking out for him. But you're not the only one. Is that so? I remember everything, you know. When I died. That demon taking over my body. And the things it made me do. And Bobby having no choice but to... You know what he did. But I can see it in his eyes when he looks at me. The guilt. It weighs on him. Just tell him you remember. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you've never been in love. He's my husband. My job is to bring him peace. Not pain. Mrs. Jones?! Ezra Jones? Ezra Jones? What is it? Maybe you could tell me from here? I'm gonna regret this. Keep your damn voices down. Karen's upstairs. I'm sorry, we're a little tense. Who's old lady Jones? - The first one to come up. - First one to go bad. - She was always a nutty broad. - Nutty how? Like the way she ate her husband's stomach? That level of nutty? Look, Bobby, I feel for you. But you have to acknowledge you're not seeing this straight! Whether you admit it or not, these things are turning. We have to stop them. All of them. Time to go. You heard me. Off my property. Or what? You'll shoot? If Karen turns, I will handle it my way. This is dangerous. I'm not telling you twice. - He's crazy. - It's his wife, Dean. So he goes full metal jacket on us? We're his family, Sam. Look, man. Bigger fish, okay? We got zombies about to turn this town into a giant chew toy. And he's alone in the house making pie with one of 'em! - All right? So? - So! I'm gonna have to go back there and kill her. - That's the only thing I can think of. - If he sees you, you're dead. Then, I won't let him see me. I'll head to town and rescue everyone. Should be easy. Sounds like. - I'm gonna need some help. - What about the sheriff? Last time I checked, she was pro-zombie. You'll have to convince her. - How? - I don't know, you're just gonna. There. Does that feel better, honey? I'm so hungry, mommy. I know. I know... Mommy's gonna make you some soup, okay? I don't know what else to tell you, doc. We checked the thermometer three times. His temperature is 111 degrees. Hold on, doc. - I'm hungry! - Can you take that in to him? Dr. Dwight, it's Jody mills. Karen, stay away from the windows. I'm okay. I'm okay, I just... I'm okay. I just got to be dizzy. - You're burning up. - I'm okay. I just need something to eat. And I'll be fine. Really. I don't know how to explain it, doctor. That's why we're calling you. Sean? Owen? Let's go! - My husband! - He's dead! - That was not my son! - You're right. It wasn't. Listen, sheriff. Your town is in danger. People are in danger, and we need to help them now. Can you do that for me? Can you focus for me, sheriff? Sheriff? - How do we put them down? - Head shot. We're gonna need weapons. We can start by rounding up everybody we can find. Is there a safe place we can take people? Jail. Right. Give me a minute. I'm so hungry, Bobby. I'll fix you something to eat... In a minute. I can feel it. It's happening. It's gonna be all right. It's not. I'm turning, Bobby. You know I am. It's okay. - Do it. - No way. - Please. - No. I remember. You remember what? Everything. The demon inside me. You killing me. I remember. Then you know... Why I can't do it again. I remember something else, too. When I came back... - There was a man. - What do you mean, a man? At the grave. He was so thin. Like a skeleton. And he told me to give you a message. Me? Why didn't you tell me this before? You've seen so much. I just... I just wanted to see you smile. What was the message? If I hand you a gun and you see a dead person, I don't care if it's your friend, your neighbor or your wife, you shoot for the head. That's the only way we survive. Who the hell are you? - Friend of Bobby Singer's. - Town drunk. I thought... - He was. - Who told you that? Bobby Singer. Stay sharp. I'll watch the front door. You know, if you want to sit this one out... Let's just get going. Little help here? - Got any more ammo? I'm low. - We got plenty. Just run back past the zombies. It's in the van. A simple "no" would have been fine. What are they doing here? - I think I get it. - What? That ain't good. - I'm out. - Me too. Kind of a tight fit, don't you think? It's all right, they're idiots. They can't pick a lock. Don't you ever get tired of being wrong? I'm making this stuff up as I go. Sue me. Get down! Are you okay? If there's any zombies left out there, we can't find 'em. - How are the townspeople? - Pretty freaked out. Hell, traumatized. A few of them are calling the papers. Nobody's believed 'em yet. Would you? How are you holding up? Is that everyone? All but one. Thinking maybe I should apologize for losing my head back there. You don't owe us anything. Look, I don't know squat from Shinola about love, but... At least you got to spend five days with her, right? Right. Which makes things about a thousand times worse. She was the love of my life. How many times do I gotta kill her? Gonna be okay, Bobby? You boys should know... Karen told me why Death was here. What? I know why he took a stroll through a cemetery in the sticks of South Dakota. He came for me. - What do you mean, you? - Death came for me. He brought Karen back to send me a message. - You? Why you? - Because I've been helping you. I'm one of the reasons you're still saying no to Lucifer, Sam. This was a hit on your life? I don't know if they wanted to take my life or... My spirit. Either way,
