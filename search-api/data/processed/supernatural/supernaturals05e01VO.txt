You're possessing some poor bastard? This is... a vessel. I had to give my consent to invite him in. Chuck shurley? We have a life. You've been using it to write your books. Dean, let him go. This man is to be protected. - Why? - He's a prophet of the lord. - Who are you? - I'm Zachariah. I'm Castiel's superior. And how am I gonna ice lilith? You're not. Lilith's going to break the final seal. - You don't want to stop it, do you? - You are chosen. You will stop it. Just... not lilith or the apocalypse, that's all. I'm sorry. - Sammy, let's go. - Dean... He's coming. - Come on. - Dean! What the devil is your name? Sa... S... S... Yosemite Sam! Yosemite Sam? Let's see. Here it is. What the hell? I don't know. Folks, quick word from the flight deck. We're just passing over Ilchester, then Ellicott city, on our initial descent into Baltimore... Ilchester? Weren't we just there? So if you'd like to stretch your legs, now would be a good time to... Holy crap! = S05E01 = Supernatural Team ... and governor O'Malley urged calm, saying it's very unlikely an abandoned convent would be a target for terrorists, either foreign... - Change the station. Hurricane kinley, unexpectedly slamming into the galveston area... ... announced a successful test of the north korean nuclear... - ... baffled... - ... swine flu... Don't say anything. It's okay. We just got to keep our heads down and hash this out, all right? First things first. How did we end up on "soul plane"? Angels, maybe? I mean beaming us out of harm's way? Whatever. It's the least of our worries. We need to find Cass. Geez! Sam. Hey, Chuck. So... you're okay? My head hurts. No, I mean my last vision. You went, like, full-On vader. Your body temperature was 150. Your heart rate was 200. Your eyes were black. Your eyes went black? I didn't know. Where's Cass? He's dead. Or gone. The archangel smote the crap out of him. - I'm sorry. - You're sure? Maybe he just vanished into the light or something. He, like, exploded. Like a water balloon of chunky soup. You got a... Right here? Is that a molar? Do I have a molar in my hair? This has been a really stressful day. Cass, you stupid bastard. Stupid? He was trying to help us. Yeah, exactly. - So, what now? - I don't know. Oh, crap. What? I can feel them. Thought we'd find you here. Playtime's over, Dean. Time to come with us. You just keep your distance, ass-hat. - You're upset. - Yeah, a little. You sons of bitches jump-started judgment day! Maybe we let it happen. We didn't start anything. Right, Sammy? You had a chance to stop your brother, and you couldn't. So let's not quibble over who started what. Let's just say it was all our faults and move on. 'Cause like it or not... ... it's apocalypse now. And we're back on the same team again. Is that so? You want to kill the devil. We want you to kill the devil. It's... synergy. And I'm just supposed to trust you? Cram it with walnuts, ugly. This isn't a game, son. Lucifer is powerful in ways that defy description. We need to strike now, hard and fast before he finds his vessel. His vessel? Lucifer needs a meat suit? He is an angel. Them's the rules. And when he touches down, we're talking four horsemen, red oceans, fiery skies... The greatest hits. You can stop him, Dean. But you need our help. You listen to me, you two-faced douche. After what you did, I don't want jack squat from you! You listen to me, boy! You think you can rebel against us? As Lucifer did? You're bleeding. A little insurance policy in case you dicks showed up. No! Learned that from my friend Cass, you son of a bitch. This sucks ass. Here. Hex bags. No way the angels will find us with those. - Demons, either, for that matter. - Where'd you get it? - I made it. - How? I learned it from ruby. Speaking of... How you doing? Are you jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what? It's weird. I tell you the truth, I'm fine. No shakes, no fever. It's like whoever put me on that plane cleaned me right up. Supernatural methadone. Yeah, I guess. - Dean. - Sam. It's okay. You don't have to say anything. That's good. Because what can I even say? "I'm sorry"? "I screwed up"? Doesn't really do it justice, you know? Look, there's nothing I can do or say that will ever make this right. So why do you keep bringing it up? All I'm saying is, why do we have to put this under a microscope? We made a mess. We clean it up. That's it. All right, so, say this is just any other hunt. You know? What do we do first? We'd, figure out where the thing is. All right. So we just got to find... The devil. All right, keep it together. Keep it together, man. It's you, Nick. You're special. You're chosen. "And then Sam touched..." No. "... caressed Dean's clavicle." "This is wrong, said Dean." "Then I don't want to be right," "replied Sam, in a husky voice." You. - You're... - Carver Edlund. Hi, becky. You got my letters. And my marzipan. Yeah, yummy. - But... - I am your number-one fan. You know, I'm Samlicker81. I'm sorry. You're what? Webmistress at morethanbrothers.net? Oh, yeah. You're my number-one fan. That's why I contacted you. You're the only one who will believe me. - Are you all right? - No. I'm being watched. Okay, not now. At least, I don't think so. But I don't have much time. I need your help. You need my help? That's right. I need you to get a message to Sam and Dean. Okay? Look, Mr. Edlund... Yes, I'm a fan, but I really don't appreciate being mocked. I know that Supernatural's just a book, okay? I know the difference between fantasy and reality. Becky, it's all real. I knew it! But then how would you explain an earthquake, a hurricane, and multiple tornadoes, all at the same time, all around the globe? Two words... Carbon emissions. Yeah, right, wavy gravy. You okay, lady? Sam is it really you? And you're so firm. Do I know you? No. But I know you. You're Sam Winchester. And you're... ... not what I pictured. I'm Becky. I read all about you guys. And I've even written a few... Anyway... Mr. Edlund told me where you were. Chuck? He's got a message, but he's being watched. Angels. Nice change-up to the mythology, by the way. The demon stuff was getting kind of old. Just, what's the message? He had a vision. "The Michael sword is on earth. The angels lost it." - The Michael sword? - Does he know where it is? In a castle, on a hill made of 42 dogs. 42 dogs? Are you sure you got that right? It doesn't make sense, but that's what he said. I memorized every word... ... for you. - Can you quit touching me? - No. Hey, Bobby. Good to see you boys all in one piece. You weren't followed, were you? You mean by angels, demons or Sam's new superfan? - You heard. - I heard, Romeo. So... sword of Michael? You think we're talking about the actual sword from the actual archangel? You better friggin' hope so. That's Michael toughest sumbitch they got. You kidding me? Tough? That guy looks like Cate Blanchett. I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, believe me. He commands the heavenly host. During the last big dust-up upstairs, he's the one who booted Lucifer's ass to the basement. He did it with that sword. So if we can find it... We can kick the devil's ass all over again. All right. So, where do we start? Divvy up and start reading. Try and make sense of Chuck's nonsense. Kid? You all right? No, actually. Bobby, this is all my fault. I'm sorry. Sam... Lilith did not break the final seal. Lilith was the final seal. Sam, stop it. I killed her, and I set Lucifer free. You what?! You guys warned me about Ruby, the demon blood but I didn't listen. I brought this on. You're damn right you didn't listen. You were reckless and selfish and arrogant. I'm sorry. You're sorry you started armageddon? This kind of thing don't get forgiven, boy. If by some miracle, we pull this off... I want you to lose my number. You understand me? There's an old church nearby. Maybe I'll go read some of the lore books there. You do that. I never would have guessed that your daddy was right. About what? About your brother. What John said... You save Sam or kill him. Maybe... Maybe what? Maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to save him. Bobby. He ended the world, Dean. And you and I weren't strong enough to stop him proper. That's on us. I'm just saying your dad's right. Dad. - It's got to be in here somewhere. - What the hell are you talking about? Here. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. What the hell is it? It's a card for my dad's lockup in upstate new york. Read it. "Castle storage. 42 rover hill." Castle on a hill of 42 dogs. So you think your dad had the Michael sword all this time? I don't know. I'm not sure what else Chuck could have meant. It's good enough for me. I always knew you were a big, dumb, slow, dim pain in the ass. But i never dreamt you were so v. I. p. I mean, you're gonna ice the devil? You? If i'd have known that, i'd have ripped your pretty, pretty face off ages ago. Try again. Go back further. Hi. These are the days of miracle and wonder. Our father's among us. We're all dreaming again for the first time since we were human? It's heaven on earth. Or hell. We really owe your brother a fruit basket. My god, you like the sound of your own voice. But you, on the other hand, you're the only bump in the road. So every demon... every single one... is just dying for a piece of you. Get in line. I'm in the front of the line, baby. Let's ride. What is that... peanut butter? Your surrogate daddy's still awake... screaming in there. And i want him to know how it feels slicing the life out of you. No! Now! No! You miss me? 'cause i sure missed you. It's not so easy without those super-special demon powers, no! No! No! No! No! Need some help here! What happened? He was stabbed. Can we get a gurney? Just wait here. No, we... we can't just leave him! Just don't move. I've got questions. - We got to go. - No. No way. The demons heard where the sword is. We got to get to it before they do, if we're not too late already. Come on! I see you told the demons where the sword is. Oh, thank god. The angels are here. And to think... they could have grabbed it any time they wanted. It was right in front of them. What do you mean? We may have planted that particular piece of prophecy inside chuck's skull, but it happened to be true. We did lose the michael sword. We truly couldn't find it. Until now. You've just hand-delivered it to us. We don't have anything. It's you, chucklehead. You're the michael sword. What? You thought you could actually killed lucifer! You simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing? No. You're just a human, dean. And not much of one. What do you mean, i'm the sword? You're michael's weapon. Or, rather, his... receptacle. - I'm a vessel? - You're the vessel. Michael's vessel. How? Why... why me? Because you're chosen! - It's a great honor, dean. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, life as an angel condom. That's real fun. I think i'll pass, thanks. Joking. Always joking. Well... no more jokes. Bang. - God! - You son of a bitch! Keep mouthing off, i'll break more than his legs. I am completely and utterly through screwing around. The war has begun. We don't have our general. That's bad. Now, michael is going to take his vessel and lead the final charge against the adversary. You understand me? How many humans die in the crossfire, huh? - A million? 5, 10? - Probably more. If lucifer goes unchecked, you know how many die? All of them. He'll roast the planet alive. There's a reason you're telling me this instead of just nabbing me. You need my consent. Michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin. Unfortunately, yes. - There's got to be another way. - There is no other way. There must be a battle. Michael must defeat the serpent. - It is written. - Yeah, maybe. But, on the other hand... eat me. The answer's no. How about this? Your friend bobby... we know he's gravely injured. Say yes, and we'll heal him. Say no, he'll never walk again. No. Then how about we heal you from... stage-4 stomach cancer? No. Then let's get really creative. Let's see how... sam does without his lungs. Are we having fun yet? You're going to say yes, dean. Just kill us. Kill you? Oh, no. I'm just getting started. How are you... alive? That's a good question. How did these two end up on that airplane? Another good question. 'cause the angels didn't do it. I think we both know the answer, don't we? No. - That's not possible. - It scares you. Well, it should. Now, put these boys back together and go. I won't ask twice. You two need to be more careful. Yeah, i'm starting to get that. Your frat brothers are bigger dicks than i thought. I don't mean the angels. Lucifer is circling his vessel. And once he takes it, those hex bags won't be enough to protect you. - What the hell was that? - An enochian sigil. It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including lucifer. - What, you just brand us with it? - No. I carved it into your ribs. Hey, cass, were you really dead? Yes. Then how are you back? You're dreaming, nick. But it doesn't mean this isn't real. I'm not your wife, nick. I'm an angel. An angel? My name is lucifer. Sure. Naturally. Could you do me a favor there, satan, and remind me to quit drinking before i go to bed? I'm here because you're special, nick. There's very, very few people like you. Is that so? You're a vessel... a very powerful vessel. Meaning what, exactly? I need to take control of your mind and your body. To be honest... it'll probably be unpleasant for you. But it is necessary. Okay, look... if it's just the same to you, i think i'd like to wake up now. I told you... this is real. Don't be afraid. This is your choice. You need to invite me in. Even if this is real, which it's not, but assuming it was... why the hell would i do something like that? You people misunderstand me. You call me "satan" and "devil," but... do you know my crime? I loved god too much. And for that, he betrayed me... punished me. Just as he's punished you. After all, how could god stand idly by while that man broke into your home and butchered your family in their beds? There are only two rational answers, nick... either he's sadistic... or he simply doesn't care. You're angry. You have every right to be angry. I am angry, too. That's why i want to find him... hold him accountable for his actions. Just because he created us doesn't mean he can toy with us, like playthings. If i help you... can you bring back my family? I'm sorry. I can't. But i can give you the next best thing. God did this to you, nick. And i can give you justice. Peace. How do i know you're telling the truth? Because, contrary to popular belief, i don't lie. I don't need to. What i need... is you. Nick, i need you to say yes. Then yes. "Unlikely to walk again"?! Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch! Wait till i get out of this bed! I'll use my game leg and kick your friggin' ass! Yeah, you better run! - You believe that yahoo? - Screw him. You'll be fine. So, let me ask the million-dollar question. What do we do now? Well... we save as many as we can for as long as we can, i guess. It's bad. Whoever wins, heaven or hell, we're boned. What if we win? I'm serious. Screw the angels and the demons and their crap apocalypse. They want to fight a war, they can find their own planet. This one's ours, and i say they get the hell off it. We take 'em all on. We kill the devil. Hell, we even kill michael if we have to. But we do it our own damn selves. And how are we supposed to do all this, genius? I got no idea. But what i do have is a g. E. d. And a "give 'em hell" attitude, and i'll figure it out. You are nine kinds of crazy, boy. It's been said. Listen, you stay on the mend. We'll see you in a bit. I was awake. I know what i said back there. I just want you to know that... that was the demon talking. I ain't cutting you out, boy. Not ever. Thanks, bobby. You're welcome. I deserve a damn medal for this, but... you're welcome. You know, i was thinking, dean... maybe we could go after the colt. Why? What difference would that make? We could use it on lucifer. You just said back there... i just said a bunch of crap for bobby's benefit. I mean... i'll fight. I'll fight till the last man, but let's at least be honest. We don't stand a snowball's chance, and you know that. I mean, hell, you of all people know that. Is there something you want to say to me? I tried, sammy. I mean, i really tried. But i just can't keep pretending that everything's all right. Because it's not. And it's never going to be. You chose a demon over your own brother, - and look what happened. - I would give anything... anything... - to take it all back. - I know you would. And i know how sorry you are. I do. But, man... you were the one that i depended on the most. And you let me down in ways that i can't even... i'm just... i'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here. You know? What can i do? Honestly? Nothing. I just don't... i don't think that we can
