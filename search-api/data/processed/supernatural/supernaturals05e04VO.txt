- More like demonic germ warfare. - What if we all have it? What if we all go crazy? Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a gun. They say this gun can kill anything. - I'm a vessel? - You're the vessel. You need my consent. Michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin. Unfortunately, yes. The answer's no. - You know who I am. - Lucifer. You're the one, sam. You're my vessel. That'll never happen. I know you don't trust me. - So, what are you saying? - I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best we just go our separate ways. Good evening, brother. Is your soul rapture-ready? Thank you, sir. God bless. Good evening, folks. Is your soul rapture-ready? Because what I'd like to do is just show you exactly what god's love is for you. Okay, god bless. Excuse me, but have you taken time out to think about god's plan for you? Too friggin' much, pal. We're talking about the colt, right? - I mean, as in The Colt? - We are. That doesn't make any sense. Why would the demons keep a gun around that kills demons? What? Did... I didn't... I didn't get that. It's kind of funny, talking to a messenger of god on a cellphone. It's like watching a hells angel ride a mo-ped. This isn't funny, Dean. The voice says i'm almost out of minutes. All right. I'm telling you, Cass, the mooks have melted down the gun by now. I hear differently. And if it's true and if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it. Where do we start? Where are you now? Kansas city. Century hotel, room 113. I'll be there immediately. I just drove like 16 hours straight. I'm human. - And there's stuff I got to do. - What stuff? Eat, for example. In this case, sleep. I just need like four hours once in a while. So, you can pop in tomorrow morning. I'll just... ... wait here, then. Damn it, Cass, I need to sleep! Dean, it's me. It's quarter past 4:00. This is important. So, you're his vessel? Lucifer's wearing you to the prom? That's what he said. Just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in. So, that's it? That's your response? - What are you looking for? - I don't know. A little panic, maybe? I guess i'm a little numb to the earth - shattering revelations at this point. What are we gonna do about it? What do you want to do about it? I want back in, for starters. I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches. I'm gonna hunt him down. So, we're back to revenge, then, are we? 'cause that worked out so well last time. Not revenge. Redemption. You're just gonna walk back in and we're gonna be the dynamic duo again? Look, Dean, I can do this. I can. I'm gonna prove it to you. Look, Sam... It doesn't matter... Whatever we do. It turns out that you and me, we're the... The fire and the oil of the armageddon. On that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere... Stay away from each other for good. It does not have to be like this. We can fight it. You're right. We can. But not together. We're not stronger when we're together, Sam. I think we're weaker. Because whatever we have between us... Love, family, whatever it is... They arealways gonna use it against us. And you know that. We're better off apart. We got a better chance of dodging Lucifer and Michael and this whole damn thing... If we just go our own ways. Dean, don't do this. Bye, Sam. = 504 = = Supernatural Team = Little girl? Little girl? Are you hurt? You know the not-talking thing is kind of creepy, right? Oh, crap. "NO ENTRY by order of acting regional command" August 1st, 2014. That's never a good sign. Croatoan pandemic reaches Australia. I thought I smelled your stink on this "back to the future" crap. "President Palin defends bombing of houston." Certainly a buyer's market in real estate. Let's see what's happening in sports. That's right... No more sports. Congress revoked the right to group assembly. What's left of congress, that is. Hardly a quorum, if you ask me. How did you find me? Afraid we had to tap some unorthodox resources of late... Human informants. We've been making inspirational visits to the fringier christian groups. They've been given your image, told to keep an eye out. The bible freak outside the motel... He, what, dropped a dime on me? - Onward, christian soldiers. - Okay, well, good, great. You have had your jollies. Now send me back, you son of a bitch. You'll get back... All in good time. We want you to marinate a bit. - Marinate? - Three days, Dean. Three days to see where this course of action takes you. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means... that your choices have consequences. This is what happens to the world if you continue to say "no" to Michael. Have a little look-see. Bobby? Bobby, I'm coming in! Where is everybody, Bobby? "Camp chitaqua." No, baby, what did they do to you? What the hell? I should be asking that question, don't you think? In fact, why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't gank you right here and now? Because you'd only be hurting yourself. Very funny. Look, man... I'm no shapeshifter or demon or anything, okay? I know. I did the drill while you were out. Silver, salt, holy water... Nothing. But you know what was funny... Was that you had every hidden lock pick, box cutter and switchblade that i carry. Now, you want to explain that? And the... resemblance, while you're at it? Zachariah. Come again? I'm you from the tail end of 2009. Zach plucked me from my bed and threw me five years into the future. Where is he? I want to talk to him. - I don't know. - You don't know. No, I don't know. I just want to get back to my own friggin' year, okay? If you're me... Then tell me something only I would know. Rhonda hurley. We were... 19. She made us try on her panties. They were pink. And satiny. And you know what? We kind of liked it. Touch√©. So, what... Zach zapped you up here to see how bad it gets? I guess. Croatoan virus, right? That's their endgame? It's efficient, it's incurable, and it's scary as hell. Turns people into monsters. Started hitting the major cities about two years ago. World really went in the crapper after that. What about Sam? Heavyweight showdown in Detroit. From what I understand, sam didn't make it. - You weren't with him? - No. No, me and Sam, We hadn't talked in... Hell, five years. We never tried to find him? I got other people to worry about. Where you going? I got to run an errand. You're just gonna leave me here? I got a camp full of twitchy trauma survivors out there with an apocalypse hanging over their head. The last thing they need to see is a version of "the parent trap." So, yeah, you stay locked down. All right, fine. But you don't have to cuff me, man. - Oh, come on. - You don't trust yourself? Absolutely not. Dick. Hey, Dean. You got a second? No. Yes. I guess. Hi, chuck. Hi. So, listen, we're pretty good on canned goods for now, but we're down to next to nothing on perishables and hygiene supplies. People are not gonna be happy about this. So, what do you think we should do? I don't know. Maybe... share? Like at a kibbutz. Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be out on a mission right now? Absolutely. And I will be. Easy, lady! Risa. You spent the night in Jane's cabin last night, didn't you? Uh, what? I- I don't... did i? I thought we had a "connection." - I'm sure that we do. - Yeah? - Hi, risa. - Screw you. I'm getting busted for stuff I haven't even done yet. What? Never mind. Hey, Chuck, is... Cass still here? I don't think Cass is going anywhere. So, in this way, we're each a fragment of total perception... Just one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. Now, the key to this total, shared perception... It's... It's surprisingly physical. Excuse me, ladies. I think I need to confer with our fearless leader for a minute. Why not go get washed up for the orgy? You're all so beautiful. What are you, a hippie? I thought you'd gotten over trying to label me. Cass, we got to talk. - Strange. - What? You... are not you... Not "now" you, anyway. No! Yeah. Yes, exactly. - What year are you from? - 2009. Who did this to you? - Is it zachariah? - Yes. Interesting. It's friggin' fascinating. Now why don't you strap on your angel wings and fly me back to my page on the calendar? I wish I could just, strap on my wings, but I'm sorry... No dice. What, are you stoned? Generally, yeah. What happened to you? Life. Watch out! Damn it. I'm not gonna lie to you. Me and him... It's a pretty messed-up situation we got going. But believe me, when you need to know something, you will know it. Until then, we all have work to do. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? You just shot a guy in cold blood. We were in an open quarantine zone... Got ambushed by some crotes on the way out. Crotes... croatoans. One of them infected Yager. How do you know? 'cause after a few years of this, I know. I started seeing symptoms about a half an hour ago. Wasn't gonna be long before he flipped. I didn't see the point in troubling a good man with bad news. "Troubling a good man"? You just blew him away in front of your own people. Don't you think that freaked them out a little bit? It's 2014. Plugging some crote, it's called commonplace. Trading words with my friggin' clone... that might have freaked them out a little. - All right, look... - No, you look. This isn't your time. It's mine. You don't make the decisions. I do. So, when I say stay in, you stay in. All right. I'm sorry. Look, I'm not trying to mess you or... me... - Us up here. - I know. It's just been a really wacky weekend. Tell me about it. What was the mission, anyway? The Colt? The Colt. Where was it? Everywhere. They've been moving it around. Took me five years, but... I finally got it. And tonight... I'm gonna kill the devil. So, that's it? That's The Colt? If anything can kill Lucifer, this is it. Great. Have we got anything that can find Lucifer? - Are you okay? - We were in Jane's cabin last night. And, apparently, we and Risa have a connection. You want to shut up? We don't have to find Lucifer. We know where he is. The demon that we caught last week... He was one of the big guy's entourage. He knew. So, a demon tells you where Satan's gonna be, And you just believe it? Oh, trust me... he wasn't lying. And you know this how? Our fearless leader, i'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth. Torture? Oh, so, we're... we're torturing again. No, that's... that's good. Classy. What? I like "past you." Lucifer is here. Now, I know the block and I know the building. Good... it's right in the middle of a hot zone. Crawling with crotes. You saying my plan is reckless? Are you saying we walk in straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the crotes, and we shoot the devil? Okay, if you don't like "reckless", - I could use "insouciant," maybe. - Are you coming? Of course. But why is he? He's you five years ago. If something happens to him, you're gone, right? He's coming. Okay. I'll get the grunts moving. We're loaded and on the road by midnight. All righty. - Why are you taking me? - Relax. You'll be fine. Zach's looking after you, right? No, that's not what I mean. I want to know what's going on. You're coming because I want you to see something. I want you to see our brother. Sam? I thought he was dead. Sam didn't die in detroit. He said "yes." "Yes"? Wait. - You mean... - That's right. The big "yes". To the devil. Lucifer's wearing him to the prom. - Why would he do that? - Wish I knew. But now we don't have a choice. It's in him and it's not getting out. And we've got to kill him, Dean. And you need to see it... The whole damn thing, how bad it gets... - So you can do it different. - What do you mean? Zach said he was gonna bring you back, right? To'09? When you get back home... You say "yes." You hear me? Say "yes" to Michael. That's crazy. If I let him in, then Michael fights the devil. The battle's gonna torch half the planet. Look around you, man. Half the planet's better than no planet, which is what we have now. If I could do it over again, i'd say "yes" in a heartbeat. - So why don't you? - I've tried! I've shouted "yes" till I was blue in the face! The angels aren't listening! They just... left... gave up! It's too late for me, but for you... No. There's got to be another way. That's what I thought. I was cocky. Never actually thought i'd lose. But I was wrong. Dean... I was wrong. I'm begging you. Say "yes." But you won't. 'cause I didn't. Because that's just not us, is it? So, you're really from'09? Yeah, afraid so. Some free advice? You ever get back there, you hoard toilet paper. You understand me? Hoard it. Hoard it like it's made of gold. 'cause it is. Thank you, chuck. You'll thank me, all right. Mark my words. I'll see you around. Let me see those. You want some? Amphetamines? It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe. Don't get me wrong, Cass. I'm happy that the stick is out of your ass, but... What's going on with the drugs And the orgies and the love-guru crap? What's so funny? Dean, i'm not an angel anymore. What? Yeah, I went mortal. What do you mean? How? I think it had something to do with the other angels leaving, but when they bailed, my mojo just kind of... ... drained away. And now, you know, i'm practically human. I mean, Dean, i'm all but useless. Last year, broke my foot... laid up for two months. So, you're human. Welcome to the club. Thanks. Except I used to belong to a much better club. And now i'm powerless... I'm hapless, I'm hopeless. Why the hell not bury myself in women and decadence, right? It's the end, baby. That's what decadence is for. Why not bang a few gongs before the lights go out? But, then... That's just how I roll. There. Second-floor window. We go in there. You sure about this? They'll never see us coming. Trust me. Now, weapons check. We're on the move in five. Hey... me. Can I talk to you for a sec? Tell me what's going on. - What? - I know you. You're lying to these people and to me. Is that so? Yeah. See, I know your lying expressions. I've seen them in the mirror. Now, there's something you're not telling us. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't seem to be the only member of your posse with some questions. So maybe I'll just take my doubts over to them. - What? - Take a look around you, man. This place should be white-hot with crotes. Where are they? They cleared a path for us. - Which means that this is... - A trap... exactly. Then we can't go through the front. Oh, we're not. They are. They're the decoys. You and me... we're going in through the back. You mean you're gonna feed your friends Into a meat grinder? Cass, too? You want to use their deaths as a diversion? Man, something is broken in you. You're making decisions that I would never make. - I wouldn't sacrifice my friends. - You're right. You wouldn't. It's one of the main reasons we're in this mess, actually. These people count on you. They trust you. They trust me to kill the devil and to save the world. And that's exactly what i'm gonna do. No. Not like this, you're not. I'm not gonna let you. Oh, really? Hello, dean. Aren't you a surprise. You've come a long way to see this, haven't you? Well, go ahead. Kill me. Kill you? Don't you think that would be a little... redundant? I'm sorry. It must be painful... Speaking to me in this... shape. But it had to be your brother. It had to be. You don't have to be afraid of me, Dean. What do you think I'm going to do? I don't know. Maybe deep-fry the planet? Why? Why would I want to destroy this stunning thing... Beautiful in a trillion different ways... The last perfect handiwork of god? You ever hear the story of how I fell from grace? Good god. You're not gonna tell me a bedtime story, are you? My stomach's almost out of bile. You know why god cast me down? Because I loved him. More than anything. And then god created... ... you. The little... Hairless apes. And then he asked all of us to bow down before you... to love you more than him. And I said, "father... I can't." I said, "these human beings are flawed, murderous." And for that... God had Michael cast me into hell. Now, tell me... Does the punishment fit the crime? Especially when I was right? Look at what 6 billion of you have done to this thing. And how many of you blame me for it? You're not fooling me. You know that? With this sympathy-for-the-devil crap. I know what you are. What am i? You're the same thing, only bigger. The same brand of cockroach I've been squashing my whole life... An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground, Supernatural piece of crap. The only difference between them and you Is the size of your ego. I like you, dean. I get what the other angels see in you. Goodbye. We'll meet again soon. You better kill me now! - Pardon? - You better kill me now. Or I swear, I will find a way to kill you. - And I won't stop. - I know you won't. I know you won't say "yes" to Michael, either. And I know you won't kill Sam. Whatever you do... You will always end up here. Whatever choices you make, whatever details you alter, we will always end up... ... here. I win. So, I win. You're wrong. See you in five years, Dean. If it isn't the ghost of christmas "screw you." Enough. Dean, enough. You saw it, right? You saw what happens. You're the only person who can prove the devil wrong. Just say "yes." How do I know that this whole thing isn't one of your tricks? Some angel hocus-pocus? The time for tricks is over. Give yourself to Michael. Say "yes", and we can strike. Before Lucifer gets to Sam. Before billions die. Nah. "Nah"? You telling me you haven't learned your lesson? I've learned a lesson, all right. Just not the one you wanted to teach. I'll just have to teach it again! Because I got you now, boy, And i'm never letting you... Son of a... That's pretty nice timing, Cass. We had an appointment. Don't ever change. How did Zachariah find you? Long story. Let's just stay away from jehovah's witnesses from now on, okay? What are you doing? Something I should have done in the first place. If you're serious and you want back in... ... you should hang on to this. I'm sure you're rusty. Look, man, I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm... whatever I need to be. But I was, uh... Wrong. What made you change your mind? Long story. The point is... maybe we are each other's achilles' heel. Maybe they'll find a way to use us against each other. I don't know. I just know we're all we've got. More than that. We keep each other human. Thank you. Really. Thank you. - I won't let you down. - I know it. I mean, you are the second-best hunter on the planet.
