And we have a winner. All right. Let's go whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. Just holster it up, There, tex. - What's the problem? - "what's the problem"? Come on, where do i begin? I mean, first of all,We don't even know if Lilith actually holds my deal. We are going off Ofela's intel? Now, when that bit The air comes out crooked, okay Second, even if we could Get to Lilith, we have to gank her. And third, isn't this the same Lilith that wants your giayoon a pike? Should i continue? Ain't you just bringing down the room? - Well, it's a gift. - I'm sorry. So, then, what are we Supposed to do, Dean? Well, just 'cause i got to die Doesn't mean you have to, okay? Either we go in smart Or we don't go in at all. Okay, fine.That's the case, I have the answer. - You do? - Yeah. A surefire way to confirm it's Lilith And a way to get us A bona fide demon-killing ginsu. Damn it, Sam, no. We are so past arguing. Dean, i am summoning Ruby. The hell you are! We got enough problems as it is. Exactly. And we got no time And no choice, either. Come on, man, she is the miss universe Of lying skanks, okay? She told you that she could Save me, huh? Lie! She seems know everything about Lilith But forgot to mention -- oh,Right -- Lilith owns my soul! Okay, fine, she's a liar. She's still got that knife. - Dean? - For all we know,she works for Lilith. Give me another option Dean. - Tell me what else - Sam is right. No! Damn it! Just no. We are not gonna make the same Mistakes all over again. You guys want to save me, Find something else. Where you going, Bobby? I guess to... Find something else Ad constringendum, Ad ligandum eos pariter Et solvendum. Et ad congregantum eos coram me. You know, Phones work, too. Hey, Sam. How's tricks? How do you get around so fast? I got the super bowl jetpack. So... You called? Did you know? I'm gonna need a tiny bit more. About Dean's deal -- That Lilith holds the contract. Yes. I did. And, what, you didn't think that was important? - You weren't ready. - For what? If i told you,you two yahoos Would have just charged After her half-cocked, And Lilith would have peeled the meat From your pretty, pretty faces. Well, we're ready now. I want your knife. You're right about one thing. You <i>are</i> ready. And now's the time, too Lilith's guard's down. Is that so? She's on shore leave, A little r&r. What the hell does that ? Trust me. You don't wanna know. You didn't lose Those hex bags i gave you? - We got 'em. -Good. Then she won't sense you're coming. So, you'll give us the knife? No. But you just said -- You want to charge in With one little pigsticker? It's a waste of a true-blue window, Like hitting hitler With that exploding briefcase -- forget it. Ok, then how? I know you wanna save your brother, Sam. No, you don't. You told Dean you couldn't. You have been lying to me all along! So, just give me your damn knife! You're not the one that i've been lying to. - Oh, so you can save him? - No. But <i>you</i> can. What? Sam, you've got some god-given talent. Well, not <i>god</i> given, But you get the gist. All that psychic crap? That's gone ever since Yellow eyes died. Not gone. Dormant. And not just visions,either. Why do you think Lilith is so scared of you? Right, she's scared of me. If you wanted, you could wipe her off the map Without moving a muscle. - I don't believe you. - It's the truth. And you decided to tell me this just now? Um...demon. "manipulative" is kind of In the job description. The fact is, is that you never Would have considered it, - Not until you were -- - Desperate enough? You don't like being different. You hate the way Dean Looks at you sometimes, Like you're some sort of sideshow freak. But suck it up because we got A lot of ground to cover, And we got to do it fast. But we <i>can</i> do it. Look,call me a bitch and hate me if you want. But i have never lied to you, Sam. Not ever. And i'telling you -- You can save your brother. And i can show you how. So, that's you, huh? Our slutty little yoda. Dean. Charming as ever. Oh, i knew you'd show up... 'Cause i knew Sam wouldn't listen! But you're not gonna Teach him anything. You understand me? Over my dead body. Oh. Well, you're right about that. What you are gonna do Is give me that knife. Then you can go crawl back Into whatever slop you came from And never bother me Or my brother again.Are we clear? Your brother is carrying A bomb inside of him, And we'd be stupid not to use it. Dean, look,Just hold on -- Sam, don't. Come on, man. What are you, blind? Can't you see That this is a trick? - That's not true. - She wants you to givin To this whole demonic, Psychic whatever, okay? Hell, she probably Wants you to become her little "antichrist superstar." I want Lilith dead. - That's all. - Why? I've told you why. Oh, right, yeah.Because you were human once, And you liked kittens And long walks on the beach. You know, i am so sick Of proving myself to you. You want to save yourself, This is how, You dumb, spineless dick! Whoa! Ruby, hey! What the hell are you grinning at? Missing something? I'll kill you,You son of a bitch. Like i said... I knew you'd come. Wait! You're just gonna leave me here? Let's go, Sam. Oh, so, you're just too stupid To live, is that it? Then fine.You deserve hell. I wish i could be there, Dean. I wish i could smell the flesh Sizzle off your bones! I wish i could be there To hear you scream! And i wish you'd Shut your piehole, But we don't always get what we want. What, you gonna let Ruby Rot down there? That's the idea. Dean, what if, uh... what if Ruby is right? What if i <i>can</i> take Lilith Quit looking at me like that. What, are you goe Her the "carrie" stare, And Lilith goes poof? I don't know what Ruby meant. you know, maybe we should just go and ask her Sam, you wanted the knife. I got you the knife. Dean, just listen to me for a second. Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers And put 30 demons on our ass, and all we got's one little knife? I mean, like you said, we go in Smart or we don't go in at all. Well, this ain't smart. We got one shot at this, Dean -- Just one. So, if there's A surefire way, They maybe we should Just talk about it. Sam, we are not gonna make The same mistake all over again. You said that, But what does that even mean? Don't you see a pattern here? Dad's deal,My deal, now this? Every time one of us is up to the crick The other is begging to sell their soul That's all this is, man. Ruby's jrut jerking your chain down the road. You know what's it's paved with, And you know where it's going. Dean. What are you afraid's gonna happen? This is me.I can handle it. And if it'll save you -- Why even risk it? Because you're my brother. Because you did the same thing for me. i know. And look how that turned out. All i'm saying... Sammy, all i'm saying is That you're my weak pot You are. And i'm yours. You don't mean that. We're -- we're family. I know. And those evil son Of bitches know it, too. I mean, what we'll do For each other, you know, How far we will go -- They're using that against us. So, what, we just stop Looking out for each other? no. we stop Being martyrs, man. We stop spreading it for these demons. Take this knife. And we go after Lilith our way, The way dad taught us to. Ane go down,Then, uh... Then we go down swinging. What do you think?
