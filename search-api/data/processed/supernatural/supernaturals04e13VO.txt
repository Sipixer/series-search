- What was he supposed to do? I was 9 years old. The training, and melting the sliver into bullets? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors. Lock the doors and windows, close the shades. And most important Watch out for sammy. I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man. It's called being a good son. Dad's gonna be here, right? He'll be here. Promise. - Where is he, anyway? - On business. - And that's why you ran away. - I was just going to college. It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone. Your brother and me... We needed you. You walked away, sam. You walked away! You're the one who said, "don't come back," dad. You closed that door, not me! This is never the life that I wanted for you. Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could. She's such a slut. So? Personally, i'm very pro-slut. What happened, anyway? She totally banged jamie jaffe, that's what. She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything. Hi, taylor. How was your weekend? Fine, I guess. You didn't... Go to the rodeo? That's my spot. Sorry. This is a skeev-free zone. Slut! - Slut! - Good bye... Slut! Slut! Slut! You shouldn't listen to those jerks. Leave me alone. I just mean... I'm sorry, that's all. You? You're sorry? Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig. You think I'm ugly? Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean it, okay? I'm not ugly. You'reugly. I'm not talking about it anymore. I already told the cops and the doctors. No one believes me. They think I'm crazy. Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most. April, why did you tell the police you were possessed? It doesn't matter. It matters to me. When I... When I hurt taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body. I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop. I just wanted to stop. I'm sorry. You don't need to apologize. April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and taylor didn't get along. Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her. Never. Do you believe me? Yeah, I do. Just a couple more questions. On the day this happened, did you... Happen to smell anything? Anything... Like what? Like rotten eggs or... Sulfur? Um, no. Okay. Did you... notice any black smoke? What are you, crazy? So? I think she's telling the truth. I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically... Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me. Kind of? She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulfur. Maybe it's not a demon. I mean, kids can be vicious. We're already here. Might as well check out the school. Right. The school. What? Truman high, home of the bombers. - What's your point? - I don't know. We went there, like... For a month a million years ago. - Why are you so jazzed to go back? - I'm not. I just think it's worth looking into. All right, well, what's our cover? Fbi? Homeland security? Swedish exchange students? Don't worry. I got an idea. Okay. Got your lunch? Books? Butterfly knife? - Yeah, dean. - You okay? Sure. Sammy... This is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only november. I'm just sick of being the new kid. You'll be fine. If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know. Relax. Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops. As soon as he gets back, we're out of here. To another school. Awesome. Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester. Hi, sam. Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester. Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself? Not really, sweetheart. Take your seat. Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself? Not really. Okay. Grab a seat. Whoa, that's yours? Awesome! Where are your books? Don't need 'em, sugar. Not gonna be here long enough anyway. All right, gang... Essay assignment. Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you. I'm barry. ... on your most memorable family experience. Just a reminder, though this is going to be worth half your final grade. Leave him alone. I'm going for a record. I said, "leave him alone." You want to take his place... midget? Yeah. Sure. Okay eveybody, if you have any questions? Alright, let's get started, good luck. Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented. A game of skill, agility, cunning. A game with one simple rule... ... dodge. Sorry. Uh, Substitute coach roth... Yes? Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball. Well, ms. B's in massachusetts getting married, so we're playing. - She says it's dangerous. - Take a lap! But... Go nuts. Having fun? The whistle makes me their god. Right. Nice shorts. Find anything? I've been over the entire school twice. No sulfur. No sulfur, no demon. No demon, no case. I don't know. Maybe I was wrong. It happens to the best of us. I say we hit the road? But after lunch. It's sloppy-joe day. Good hustle, colby! Walk it off! I need to copy your algebra homework again. Why? 'cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick? I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak. That fist? What happened? How's the nonviolence assembly going? Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisinart is not a "healthy display of anger." So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear? Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit. - It's got to be ghost possession. - Yeah, but that's pretty rare. But it happens. I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body. All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building? Yeah, but where? I mean, there's no emf. Maybe we could find out who it is, at least. Check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something. Way ahead of you. I had to break into the principal's office to get this. Oh, and fyi, 3 of the cheerleaders are legal. Guess which ones. There was only one death on campus. It was a suicide back in'98. Some kid named barry cook. What? I knew him. How did he die? He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom. That's where... Right where the chick got swirleyed to death, exactly. So, what? This ghost is possessing nerds? And using them to go after bullies, yeah. Well, does that sound like barry's M. O? Barry had a hard time. - Thanks, sam. - Great school. I don't care. Three years, and I'm out of here. I'm going to michigan state. They got the best vet program in the country. Do you like animals? They're a lot nicer than people. So tonight i'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter... Mm, kinky. ... and the midnight screening of "i spit on your grave" at the cinedome. I can't. I have a curfew... At 11:00. So? So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month. Yeah, parents. Terrifying. When's your curfew? I don't have one. Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they? My dad's out of town on a job. It's just me and my brother. For how long? Couple of weeks. Seriously? Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the pines. The motel? Hbo, magic fingers, free ice... It's great. I guess. What? I do whatever I want, whenever I want. It's perfect. But... Don't you miss your dad? Yo! Sammy! That's your brother with amanda heckerling? He's cool. Yeah. He thinks so. Hey, tough guy. I been looking for you. Still want to take barry's place? - Get out of here, barry. - I'll go get a teacher. - You want to go? - I'm not gonna fight you, dirk. Why not? You chicken? - Come on! - No. Get up! Get up! - Come on! Get up! - hey, get back! Get back. That is enough. So long, barry cook. You all right? Barry was my friend. I just burned his bones. Well, he's at peace now, sam. I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I could have helped the kid, you know? You read the coroner's report same as me. Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man. School was hell for that kid. His parents had split up. He just wanted out. It was tragic, but it's not your fault. To tell you the truth, I'm glad we got out of that town. I hated that school. It wasn't all bad. How can you say that after what happened to you? That kid's dead. I'm gonna rip his lungs out! - It's not a big deal. - Not a big deal? Sammy, look at yourself. If dad was here... He's not. Well, I am! And as soon as I'm finished with that dick... Shut up, okay?! I don't need your help. That's right, you don't. You could have torn him apart. So why didn't you? Because I don't want to be the freak for once, dean. I want to be normal. So taking a beating... That's normal? Any word from dad? He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least. We weren't supposed to be here this long. At least you've got amanda. She's cool. Dude, she wants me to meet her parents. I don't do parents. Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you? I'll wait for you outside. Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it. Oh, no, it's not about the fight, sam. You know this assignment was nonfiction, right? Yes, Mr. Wyatt. So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh? Why would you write something like this, sam? It doesn't matter. As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving, so... - You can flunk me if you want to. - I'm not flunking you. I'm giving you an "a." Now, aside from the werewolf, is that really how you'd describe your family? Yeah. Well, your brother is quite a character. And your father... He seems, uh, driven. Anyway, it's good, sam. It's really good. Have you ever thought about pursuing writing? I can't. I have to go into the family business. Family business? Yeah, my dad's a m... My dad's a mechanic. So I have to be a mechanic, too. Do you want to go in the family business, sam? No one's ever asked me that before. Well? More than anything, no. Well... I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but... ... you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Look, I mean, I know what it's like. I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me. So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you. But the point is... There may be three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life, and you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else. You seem like a great kid, sam. Just live the life you want to live. We came back here so you could talk to a teacher? He's a good guy. Well, whatever. Go have your robin williams "o captain! My captain!" Moment. Just make it quick. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me how to find room 305? Sure. Um... Head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the... third door on the left. Thanks, sam. You got tall, winchester. Trust me. This will help. That ghost is dead. I'm gonna rip its lungs out! Well, you know what I mean. It knew my name, dean. My real name. We burned barry's bones. What the hell? Maybe it wasn't barry. Maybe we missed something. We just got to go back. No way. - How did we not see this before? - What? Check it out. Look, martha dumptruck, revenge of the nerds, and hello kitty... They all rode the same bus. Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted. That would explain why there's no emf at the school, but not the attacks. Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt. They can't just bail. Unless this one can. There's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles. Then whenever they leave the body, they're... they're bungeed back to their usual haunt. But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want. So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into truman? It's possible. Ghosts getting creative... That's super. Definitely ain't clean. Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty! Come out, come out, wherever you are! I don't get it. No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here. Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair, hell, a hangnail, something's got to be tying the ghost to this place. We just got to find it. Got a new driving permit. Issued two weeks ago. - Just before the first attack. - Yeah. Name of the bus driver is dirk mcgregor sr. 39 north central avenue. Mcgregor? Why? I knew his son. Did you know everybody at this school? Got to watch where you're going, man. Leave him alone, dirk. You never learn, do you, midget? Get to the bus, barry. What's the matter? You scared? Don't worry. I'll go easy on you this time. Come on, lose-chester. Let's see what you got. Come on, freak! Freak! You're not tough. You're just a jerk. "Dirk the jerk." So, you were friends with dirk? Yes, sir, in high school. I don't recall dirk having many friends at truman. Here, sit. Sit down. When did, uh... When did dirk pass? He was 18. What happened to him? Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and too many drugs then. He just slipped through my fingers. It was my fault. I should have seen it coming, you know? Dirk, he, uh... Well, he had his troubles. What kind of troubles? School was never easy for dirk. We didn't have much money, and, Well, you know, kids... They can be cruel. They picked on him. They picked onhim? They called him poor and dirty and stupid. They even had a nickname for him... Dirk the jerk. And after what happened to his mother, he... His mother? Yeah, jane, my wife. She died when dirk was 13. Cancer. I was working three jobs, so... it fell to dirk to take care of her. And he was a great kid. He made sure jane got her medicine. He helped her, cleaned up after her. But, you know, you... You watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... It does things to a person. Horrible things. I didn't know about his mother. He wouldn't talk about her, not even to me. Lot of anger in that boy. I'm sorry. Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. Mcgregor. You mind telling us where dirk is buried? Oh, he wasn't. I had him cremated. All of him? Well, I kept a lock of his hair. Oh, that's... That's nice. Where do you keep that? On my bus, in my bible. Thanks for subbing tonight, eddie. My pleasure, coach. Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal, there? I got it all under control. What the hell was that? Everyone okay? Dirk! Winchester. What are you gonna do, shoot me? Don't need to. That rope is soaked in salt water. You're not going anywhere. All right, everybody stay where you are. You'll be okay. Aren't you the P. E Teacher? Not really. I'm like "21 jump street." The bus driver sells pot. It's not here! - Where is it? - No way you'll ever find it. Where is it?! Sam winchester. Still a bully. You, you jocks... You popular kids... You always thought you were better than everybody else. And to you, I was just dirk the jerk, right? Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you. I'm not evil, dirk. I'm not. And neither were you. Trust me. I've seen real evil. We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other... Us and everybody else. That's high school. But you suffer through that, and it gets better. I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that... You or barry. Nothing is gonna get better for me. Not ever. Dean! Find the hair! Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like. Little help? He's giving you the full cowgirl. Five more minutes, jerry. Amanda, hey! Gettysburg address, 1863, right? History test next period. We're studying. Come on, baby. She means nothing to me. Don't be mad. I'm not mad, dean. I thought maybe... underneath your whole "I could give a crap," baboy thing, that there was something more going on. I mean, like the way you are with your brother. But I was wrong. And you spend And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool but it's just an act. We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid. And I feel sorry for you, dean. You feel sorry for me, huh? Don't feel sorry for me. You don't know anything about me. I save lives. I'm a hero. A hero! What? What?! Dad? Finally. I can't wait to get out of here. This place sucks. Come on, sam. Uh, Mr. Wyatt? Yes. You probably don't remember me, but my name is Sam Winchester, and I just wanted to thank you. For? I was a student here, and you gave me some advice once. Winchester Right. Yeah. You, uh... - You wrote that horror story. - Yeah. Yeah, I did. Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story. - What do you mean? - Nothing. Sorry. So, what was this advice? I might need to plagiarize myself down the line. You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business. You said I should make my own choices. So you've managed to do your own thing, then? Yeah, for a while, yeah. And I think I went to college because of you. But, you know, People grow up. Responsibilities. But still, um... you took an interest in me when no one else did. That matters, so... Thank you.
