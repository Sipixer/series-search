"elroy mcgillicuddy"? and his two loving sons. so... what else did the doctor say about dean? nothing. look... if the doctors won't do anything, then we'll have to -- that's all. i don't know. i'll find some... hoodoo priest and lay some mojo on him. we'll look for someone. yeah. but, sam... i don't know if we're gonna find anyone. why not? i found that faith healer before. that was one in a million. so what? we just sit here with our thumbs up our ass? no, i said we'd look. all right? i'll check under every stone. where's the colt? your son is dying, and you're worried about the colt? we are hunting this demon, and maybe it's hunting us, too. that gun may be our only card. it's in the trunk. they dragged the car to a yard off of i-83. all right, you got to clean out that trunk before some junk man sees what's inside. i already called bobby. he's like an hour out. he's gonna tow the impala back to his place. all right. you go meet up with bobby. you get that colt and bring it back to me. and you watch out for hospital security. i think i got it covered. hey. here. i made a list of things i need. have bobby pick them up for me. acacia? oil of abramelin? what's this stuff for? protection. [ sighs ] hey, dad... you know the demon? he said he had plans for me and children like me. you have any idea what he meant by that? no, i don't. well, you sure know something. [ sighs ] oh, man. dean is gonna be pissed. look, sam, this -- this just ain't worth a tow. i say we empty the trunk, and sell the rest for scrap. no. dean would kill me if we did that. when he gets better, he's gonna want to fix this. there's nothing to fix. the frame's a pretzel. the engine's ruined. there's barely any parts worth salvaging. now, listen to me, bobby. if there's only one working part, that's enough. we're not just gonna give up on... okay. you got it. here... dad asked if you could get this stuff for him. what john want with this? protection from the demon. what? nothing. it's just... bobby. what's going on? come on, dad. you got to help me. i got to get better. i got to get back in there. i mean, you haven't called a soul for help. you haven't even tried. aren't you gonna do anything? aren't you even gonna say anything? i've done everything you have ever asked me. everything. i've given everything i've ever had. now you're just gonna sit there, and you're gonna watch me die? i mean, what the hell kind of father are you?

[ breathing erratically ] [ breathing stops ] sammy, tell me you can freaking hear me, man. there's something in the hospital. now, you got to bring me back, and we got to hunt this thing. sam! you're quiet. you think i wouldn't find out? ?? what? that stuff from bobby. you don't use it to ward off a demon -- you use it to summon one. you're planning on bringing the demon here, having some stupid macho showdown. i have a plan, sam. that's exactly my point! dean is dying, and you have a plan! you care more about killing this demon than you do saving your own son! no, no, no. guys, don't do this. do not tell me how i feel. i am doing this for dean. how? how is revenge gonna help him? you're not thinking about anybody but yourself. it's the same selfish obsession! come on, guys, don't do this. that's funny. i thought this was your obsession, too. this demon killed your mother, killed your girlfriend. you begged me to be part of this hunt! now, if you killed that damn thing when you had the chance, none of this would have happened. it was possessing you. i would have killed you, too. yeah, and your brother would be awake right now. shut up, both of you! go to hell. i should have never taken you along in the first place. i knew it was a mistake. i said "shut up!" dude, i full-on swayzed that mother.

[ monitor beeping ] don't worry, sammy. i'm not going anywhere. i'm getting that thing before it gets me. it's some kind of spirit, but i could grab it. and if i can grab it, i can kill it. woman: can't you see me?! why won't you look at me?! now what? somebody talk to me! say something, please. can you see me? yeah. all right, just calm down. what's your name? tessa. okay, good, tessa. i'm dean. what's happening to me? am i -- am i dead? that sort of depends. i don't understand. i just came in for an appendectomy. i hate to bear bad news, but... i think there were some complications. it's just a dream, that's all. this is just a very weird, unbelievably vivid dream. tessa, it's not a dream. then what else could it be? you ever heard of an out-of-body experience? what are you, some new-agey guy? you see me messing with crystals or listening to yanni? it's actually a very old idea. it's got a lot of different names -- bilocation, crisis apparitions, fetches. i think it's happening to us. if it is... it means that we're spirits... of people close to death. so we're gonna die? no. not if we hold on. our bodies can get better. you can snap right back in there and wake up. what do you mean you felt something? i mean, it felt like... like dean. like he was there, just out of eyeshot or something. i don't know if it's my psychic thing or what. but do you think it's even possible? do you think his spirit could be around? anything's possible. well, there's one way to find out. where are you going? i got to pick something up. i'll be back. wait, sam. i promise i won't hunt this demon, not until we know dean's okay. i got to say, i'm impressed. with what? you. most people in your spot would be jello by now, but you're taking this pretty well. maybe a little better than me. don't get me wrong -- i was pretty freaked at first. but now i don't know. maybe i'm dealing. so you're okay with dying? no, of course not. i just think whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. it's out of my control. it's just fate. hmm. that's crap. you always have a choice. you can either roll over and die, or you can keep fighting no matter what. woman on p.a.: dr. christie to room 237. code blue. dean, where are you going? just wait here. man: give me another amp of epi, please. [ monitor beeping ] [ whispered voices ] get away from her! [ flatline ] all right. let's call it. time of death -- 5:11 p.m. at least she's not suffering anymore. hey. i think maybe you're around. and if you are, don't make fun of me for this, but, um... but there's one way we can talk. oh, you got to be kidding me. [ sighs ] dean? dean, are you here? god, i feel like i'm at a slumber party. [ sighs ] all right, sam. this isn't gonna work. [ exhales sharply ] [ gasps ] i'll be damned. [ laughs ] oh, it's good to hear from you, man. it hasn't the same without you, dean. damn straight. all right. dean, what? "h"... "u"... "hunt"? what, "hunting"? are you hunting? dean, it's in the hospital, what you're hunting? do you know what it is? one question at a time, dude. what is it? i don't think it's killing people. i think it's taking them... you know, when... when their time is just up. the reaper. dean... is it after you? if it's here naturally, there's no way to stop it. yeah, you can't kill death. man, you're, uh... i'm screwed, sam. no. no, no, no. there's got to be a way. there's got to be a way. dad will know what to do. dad? [ hinges creak ] [ steam hissing ] [ groans ] hey, so dad wasn't in his room. where is he? but i got dad's journal, so who knows? maybe there's something in here. thanks for not giving up on me, sammy. son of a bitch. hi, dean. you know, you read the most interesting things. for example, did you know that reapers can alter human perception? i sure didn't. basically they can make themselves appear however they want... ...like, say, a pretty girl. you're much prettier than the last reaper i met. i was wondering when you'd figure it out. i should have known. that whole "accepting fate" rap of yours is far too laid-back for a dead girl. but, you know, the mother and the body. i'm still trying to figure that one out. it's my sandbox. i can make you see whatever i want. what is this, like a turn-on for you, huh? toying with me? you didn't give me much choice. you saw my true form, and you flipped out. kind of hurts a girl's feelings. this was the only way i could get you to talk to me. okay, fine. we're talking. what the hell do you want to talk about? how death is nothing to fear. it's your time to go, dean. and you're living on borrowed time already. [ speaking latin ] [ speaking latin ] [ creaks ] what the hell are you doing down here, buddy? i can explain. yeah? you're gonna explain to security. come on. you follow me. [ gun cocks ] hey. how stupid do you think i am? you really want an honest answer to that? you conjuring me, john? i'm surprised. i took you for a lot of things, but suicidally reckless wasn't one of them. i can always shoot you. you could always miss. pfft! [ chuckles ] and you only got one try, don't you? did you really think you could trap me? oh, i don't want to trap you. [ gun uncocks ] i want to make a deal. dean  are you here? couldn't find anything in the book. i don't know how to help you. but i'll keep trying, all right? as long as you keep fighting. i mean, come on, you can't... [ chuckles ] you can't leave me here alone with dad. we'll kill each other. you know that. dean, you got to hold on. you can't go, man, not now. we were just starting to be brothers again. can you hear me? look, i'm sure you've heard this before, but... you got to make an exception. you got to cut me a break. tessa: stage 3 -- bargaining. i'm serious. my family is in danger. see, we're kind of in the middle of this, uh... war. and they need me. the fight's over. no, it isn't. it is for you. dean... you're not the first soldier i've plucked from the field. they all feel the same. they can't leave. victory hangs in the balance. but they're wrong. the battle goes on without them. my brother, he could die without me. maybe he will. maybe he won't. nothing you can do about it. it's an honorable death, a warrior's death. i think i'll pass on the 72 virgins, thanks. i'm not that into prude chicks anyway. that's funny. you're very cute. there's no such thing as an honorable death. my corpse is gonna rot in the ground, and my family is gonna die. no. i'm not going with you. i don't care what you do. well, like you said... there's always a choice. i can't make you come with me. look, you're not getting back in your body, and that's just facts. so, yes, you can stay. you'll stay here for years -- disembodied, scared. and over the decades, it'll probably drive you mad. maybe you'll even get violent. what are you saying? dean, how do you think angry spirits are born? they can't let go, and they can't move on. and you're about to become one -- the same thing you hunt. it's very unseemly, making deals with devils. how do i know this isn't just another trick? it's no trick. i will give you the colt and the bullet. but you got to help dean. you got to bring him back. why, john, you're a sentimentalist. if only your boys knew how much their daddy loved them. it's a good trade. you care a hell of a lot more about this gun than you do dean. don't be so sure. he killed some people very special to me. but, still, you're right. he isn't much of a threat. and neither is your other son, of course. you know the truth, right... ...about sammy and the other children? yeah. i've known for a while. but sam doesn't, does he? you've been playing dumb. can you bring dean back? yes or no. no. but i know someone who can. it's not a problem. good. and before i give you the gun, i'm gonna want to make sure that dean's okay, with my own eyes. oh, john, i'm offended. don't you trust me? hmm. fine. so we have a deal? no, john, not yet. you still need to sweeten the pot. with what? there's something else i want as much as that gun. maybe more. it's time to put the pain behind you. and go where? sorry. i can't give away the big punch line. moment of truth. no changing your mind later. so, what's it going to be? [ voices singing softly ] what are you doing that for? i'm not doing it. you can't do this! get away! what's happening? aaaaaaah! [ growls ] today's your lucky day, kid. [ gasps ] [ gasps ] dean! [ coughing ] help! i need help! i can't explain it. the edema has vanished. the internal contusions are healed. your vitals are good. you got to have some kind of angel watching over you. thanks, doc. you said a reaper was after me? yeah. how did i ditch it? you got me. dean, you really don't remember anything? no... except this pit in my stomach. sam, something's wrong. [ knock on door ] how you feeling, dude? fine, i guess. i'm alive. that's what matters. where were you last night? i had some things to take care of. well, that's specific. come on, sam. did you go after the demon? no. you know, why don't i believe you right now? can we not fight? you know, half the time we're fighting, i don't know what we're fighting about. we're just butting heads. look, sammy, i've... i've made some mistakes. but i've always done the best i could. i just don't want to fight anymore, okay? dad, are you all right? yeah. yeah, i'm just a little tired. hey, son, would you mind, uh -- would you mind getting me a cup of caffeine? yeah. yeah, sure. what is it? you know, when, uh -- when you were a kid, i'd come home from a hunt, and after what i'd seen, i'd be -- i'd be wrecked. and you -- you'd come up to me, and you'd put your hand on my shoulder, and you'd look me in the eye, and you'd... you'd say, "it's okay, dad." dean...i'm sorry. why? you shouldn't have had to say that to me. i should've been saying that to you. you know, i put... i put too much on your shoulders. i made you grow up too fast. you took care of sammy. you took care of me. you did that. and you didn't complain -- not once. i just want you to know... that i am so proud of you. this really you talking? yeah. yeah, it's really me. [ sniffles ] why are you saying this stuff? i want you to watch out for sammy, okay? yeah, dad, you know i will. you're scaring me. don't be scared, dean. [ sighs ] okay. dad? [ flatline ] no, no, no, it's our dad. it's our dad! okay. let's try again. an amp of atropine. okay. stop compression. come on, come on. still no pulse. okay. that's it, everybody. i'll call it. time of death -- 10:41 a.m.
