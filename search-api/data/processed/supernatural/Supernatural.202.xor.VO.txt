THIS CRAP AIN'T REAL. AIN'T NOBODY CAN TRACK A DEMON LIKE THIS. OUR DAD COULD. THESE ARE NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL OVERVIEWS, CROSS-SPECTRUM CORRELATIONS. I MEAN...DAMN. THEY'RE SIGNS, OMENS. IF YOU CAN TRACK THEM, YOU CAN TRACK THIS DEMON -- YOU KNOW, LIKE CROP FAILURES, ELECTRICAL STORMS. YOU EVER BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING? IT AIN'T FUN. CAN YOU TRACK IT OR NOT? YEAH, WITH THIS, I THINK SO. BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME. GIVE ME... 51 HOURS. HEY, MAN! BY THE WAY, I DIG THE HAIRCUT. ALL BUSINESS UP FRONT, PARTY IN THE BACK. HEY, ELLEN, WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A POLICE SCANNER. WE KEEP TABS ON THINGS -- NO, NO, NO, NO. THE FOLDER. UH... I WAS GONNA GIVE THIS TO A FRIEND OF MINE, BUT TAKE A LOOK IF YOU WANT. THANKS.

SO, I GUESS I GOT 51 HOURS TO WASTE. MAYBE TONIGHT WE SHOULD... OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND. WHAT? NOTHING, JUST... WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TOSS ME SOME CHEAP PICKUP LINE.

CHECK THIS OUT. YEAH. A FEW MURDERS NOT FAR FROM HERE THAT ELLEN CAUGHT WIND OF -- LOOKS TO ME LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A HUNT. YEAH, SO? SO, I TOLD HER WE'D CHECK IT OUT. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME -- KILLER CLOWN? YEAH, HE LEFT THE DAUGHTER UNHARMED AND KILLED THE PARENTS. RIPPED THEM TO PIECES, ACTUALLY. AND THIS FAMILY WAS AT SOME CARNIVAL THAT NIGHT? RIGHT, THE COOPER CARNIVAL. HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH SOME PSYCHO CARNY IN A CLOWN SUIT? THE COPS HAVE NO LEADS, AND ALL THE EMPLOYEES WERE TEARING DOWN SHOP -- ALIBIS ALL AROUND. PLUS THE GIRL SAID SHE SAW A CLOWN VANISH INTO THIN AIR. COPS ARE SAYING TRAUMA, OF COURSE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, SAM -- "WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE CLOWNS?" OH, GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU DIDN'T THINK I REMEMBERED, DID YOU? COME ON, YOU STILL BUST OUT CRYING WHENEVER YOU SEE RONALD McDONALD ON THE TELEVISION. AT LEAST M NOT AFRAID OF FLYING. PLANES CRASH! AND APPARENTLY CLOWNS KILL. SO, THESE TYPES OF MURDERS -- THEY EVER HAPPEN BEFORE? UH, ACCORDING TO THE FILE, 1981, THE BUNKER BROTHERS CIRCUS. SAME M.O. -- IT HAPPENED THREE DIFFERENT TIMES, THREE DIFFERENT LOCALES. IF IT IS A SPIRIT, IT'S USUALLY BOUND TO A SPECIFIC LOCALE -- A HOUSE OR A TOWN. HOW'S THIS ONE MOVING FROM CITY TO CITY? CURSED OBJECT, MAYBE. SPIRIT ATTACHES ITSELF TO SOMETHING, AND THE CARNIVAL CARRIES IT AROUND WITH THEM. GREAT. PARANORMAL SCAVENGER HUNT. THIS CASE WAS YOUR IDEA. BY THE WAY, WHY IS THAT? YOU WERE AWFULLY QUICK TO JUMP ON THIS JOB. SO? IT'S JUST NOT LIKE YOU, THAT'S ALL. I THOUGHT YOU WERE HELL-BENT FOR LEATHER ON THE DEMON HUNT. I DON'T KNOW -- I JUST THINK TAKING THIS JOB, IT'S WHAT DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO DO. WHAT DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED? YEAH. SO? NOTHING. [ <i>EVIL LAUGHTER</i> ] I'M COMING FOR YOU.

Sam: CHECK IT OUT -- FIVE-O. DID YOU GET HER NUMBER? MORE MURDERS? TWO MORE LAST NIGHT. APPARENTLY, THEY WERE RIPPED TO SHREDS, AND THEY HAD A LITTLE BOY WITH THEM. WHO FINGERED A CLOWN. WHAT? YES, A CLOWN, WHO APPARENTLY VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. DEAN, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR A CURSED OBJECT, IT'S LIKE TRYING TO FIND A NEEDLE IN A STACK OF NEEDLES. IT COULD BE ANYTHING. WELL, IT'S BOUND TO GIVE OFF EMF, SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SCAN EVERYTHING. OH, GOOD. THAT'S NICE AND INCONSPICUOUS. I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO BLEND IN. EXCUSE ME. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MR. COOPER. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM AROUND? WHAT IS THAT -- SOME KIND OF JOKE? OH, GOD, I'M SORRY. YOU THINK I WOULDN'T GIVE MY EYETEETH TO SEE MR. COOPER OR A SUNSET OR ANYTHING AT ALL? WANT TO GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP HERE? NOT REALLY. Man: HEY, BARRY, IS THERE A PROBLEM? YEAH, THIS GUY HATES BLIND PEOPLE. NO, I DON'T. HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? NOTHING. IT'S JUST A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING. LITTLE? YOU SON OF A BITCH. NO, NO, NO! COULD SOMEBODY TELL ME WHERE MR. COOPER IS? PLEASE? YOU BOYS PICKED A HELL OF A TIME TO JOIN UP. TAKE A SEAT. WE GOT ALL KINDS OF LOCAL TROUBLE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? A COUPLE OF FOLKS GOT THEMSELVES MURDERED. COPS ALWAYS SEEM TO START HERE FIRST. SO, YOU TWO EVER WORK THE CIRCUIT BEFORE? UH, YES, SIR, LAST YEAR THROUGH TEXAS AND ARKANSAS. DOING WHAT? RIDE JOCKEYS? PULL SHOOT? A-AND-S MEN? LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING, I GUESS. YOU TWO HAVE NEVER WORKED A SHOW IN YOUR LIVES BEFORE, HAVE YOU? NOPE. BUT WE REALLY NEED THE WORK. AND SAM HERE'S GOT A THING FOR THE BEARDED LADY. [ LAUGHS ] YOU SEE THAT PICTURE? THAT'S MY DADDY. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HIM. HE WAS IN THE BUSINESS -- RAN A FREAK SHOW TILL THEY OUTLAWED THEM MOST PLACES. APPARENTLY DISPLAYING THE DEFORMED ISN'T DIGNIFIED. SO, MOST OF THE PERFORMERS WENT FROM HONEST WORK TO ROTTING IN HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS. THAT'S PROGRESS, I GUESS. YOU SEE, TS PLACE IS A REFUGE FOR OUTCASTS, ALWAYS HAS BEEN, FOR FOLKS THAT DON'T FIT IN NOWHERE ELSE. BUT YOU TWO... SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL, FIND A COUPLE OF GIRLS, HAVE 2.5 KIDS, LIVE REGULAR. SIR... ...WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND WE DON'T WANT REGULAR. WE WANT THIS. Dean: HUH. WHAT? THAT WHOLE "I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL" THING -- YOU JUST SAYING THAT TO COOPER, OR WERE YOU, YOU KNOW, SAYING IT? SAM? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW? I THOUGHT THAT ONCE THE DEMON WAS DEAD AND THE FAT LADY SINGS THAT YOU WERE GONNA TAKE OFF, HEAD BACK TO WUSSY STATE. I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS. REALLY? YEAH, I THINK... DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED ME TO STICK WITH THE JOB. SINCE WHEN DO YOU GIVE A DAMN WHAT DAD WANTED? YOU SPENT HALF YOUR LIFE DOING WHAT HE DIDN'T WANT. SINCE HE DIED, OKAY? YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT? NO, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM AT ALL. [ EMF DETECTOR CLICKING ] [ BELL RINGING ] [ <i>EVIL LAUGHTER</i> ] WHO IS THIS? ISOMEBODY THERE? I'M COMING. IS SOMEBODY THERE?

LIKE A REAL HUMAN SKELETON? In the fun house. WHAT IF THE SPIRIT ISN'T ATTACHED TO A CURSED OBJECT? WHAT IF IT'S ATTACHED TO ITS OWN REMAINS? DID THE BONES GIVE OFF EMF? WELL, NO, BUT -- We should check it out anyway. I'm heading to you. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, KID? JUST SWEEPING. BULL. AND WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SKELETONS? WHAT'S EMF? DUDE, YOUR BLIND-MAN HEARING IS OUT OF CONTROL. WE'RE A TIGHT-KNIT GROUP. WE DON'T LIKE OUTSIDERS. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS. WE GOT A PROBLEM? YOU TELL ME. YOU'RE THE ONE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BONES. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS? WHAT? MY BROTHER AND ME... WE'RE WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THEM. WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? LONG STORY. Girl: MOMMY, LOOK AT THE CLOWN. Woman: WHAT CLOWN? HE DISAPPEARED. COME ON, SWEETIE. COME ON. DEAN, I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU TOLD PAPASIAN ABOUT THE HOMICIDAL PHANTOM CLOWN. I TOLD HIM AN URBAN LEGEND ABOUT A HOMICIDAL PHANTOM CLOWN. KEEP IT DOWN. OH, AND GET THIS. I MENTIONED THE BUNKER BROTHERS CIRCUS IN '81 AND THEIR EVIL-CLOWN APOCALYPSE. GUESS WHAT. WHAT? BEFORE MR. COOPER OWNED COOPER CARNIVAL, HE WORKED FOR THE BUNKER BROTHERS. HE WAS THEIR LOT MANAGER. YOU THINK COOPER JUST BROUGHT IT WITH HIM? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT CLOWNS. WANT TO COME IN AND PLAY? WANT TO SEE MOMMY AND DADDY? THEY'RE UPSTAIRS. [ GIRL SCREAMING ] HEY! Sam: HEY! SAM, WATCH OUT! WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE? Woman: OH, MY GOD! GET AWAY FROM MY KID! THEY SHOT MY CLOWN. YOU REALLY THINK THEY SAW OUR PLATES? I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE. BESIDES, I HATE THIS FREAKING THING ANYWAY. WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE. WHAT'S THAT? WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH A SPIRIT. THAT ROCK SALT HIT SOMETHING SOLID. YEAH, A PERSON, OR MAYBE A CREATURE THAT CAN MAKE ITSELF INVISIBLE? YEAH, AND DRESSES UP LIKE A CLOWN FOR KICKS? DID IT SAY ANYTHING IN DAD'S JOURNAL? NOPE. WHO YOU CALLING? MAYBE ELLEN OR THAT GUY ASH WILL KNOW SOMETHING. HEY, YOU THINK, UH... YOU THINK DAD AND ELLEN EVER HAD A THING? NO WAY. THEN WHY DIDN'T HE TELL US ABOUT HER? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THEY HAD SOME SORT OF FALLING-OUT. YEAH. YOU EVER NOTICE DAD HAD A FALLING-OUT WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY? DON'T GET ALL MAUDLIN ON ME, MAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN THIS STRONG, SILENT THING OF YOURS. IT'S CRAP. I'M OVER IT. THIS ISN'T JUST ANYONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS DAD. I KNOW HOW YOU FELT ABOUT THE MAN. BACK OFF, ALL RIGHT? JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT CARING AND SHARING LIKE YOU WANT -- NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, DEAN. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DEAL WITH THIS, BUT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, MAN. LISTEN, I'M YOUR BROTHER, ALL RIGHT? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY. DUDE, I'M OKAY! I'M OKAY! THE NEXT PERSON WHO ASKS ME IF I'M OKAY, I'M GONNA START THROWING PUNCHES. THESE ARE YOUR ISSUES. QUIT DUMPING THEM ON ME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS SUDDEN OBEDIENCE YOU HAVE TO DAD. IT'S LIKE, "OH, WHAT WOULD DAD WANT ME TO DO?" YOU SPENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SLUGGING IT OUT WITH THAT MAN. HELL, YOU PICKED A FIGHT WITH HIM THE LAST TIME YOU EVER SAW HIM, AND NOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT? WELL, I'M SORRY, SAM, BUT YOU CAN'T. WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS TO ME? I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THIS. I'M DEALING WITH DAD'S DEATH. ARE YOU? I'M GONNA CALL ELLEN. THANKS A LOT. RAKSHASA. WHAT'S THAT? ELLEN'S BEST GUESS. IT'S A RACE OF ANCIENT HINDU CREATURES. THEY APPEAR IN HUMAN FORM, THEY FEED ON HUMAN FLESH, THEY CAN MAKE THEMSELVES INVISIBLE, AND THEY CANNOT ENTER A HOME WITHOUT FIRST BEING INVITED TO. THEY DRESS UP LIKE CLOWNS, AND CHILDREN INVITE THEM IN. WHY DON'T THEY JUST MUNCH ON THE KIDS? NOT ENOUGH MEAT ON THE BONES, MAYBE? WHAT ELSE YOU FIND OUT? APPARENTLY, RAKSHASAS LIVE IN SQUALOR. THEY SLEEP ON A BED OF DEAD INSECTS. AND THEY HAVE TO FEED A FEW TIMES EVERY 20 TO 30 YEARS -- SLOW METABOLISM, I GUESS. THAT MAKES SENSE -- THE CARNIVAL TODAY, THE BUNKER BROTHERS IN '81. PROBABLY MORE BEFORE THAT. SAM, WHO DO WE KNOW THAT WORKED BOTH SHOWS? COOPER? COOPER. YOU KNOW, THAT PICTURE OF HIS FATHER, THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM. YOU THINK MAYBE IT WAS HIM? WELL, WHO KNOWS HOW OLD HE IS? ELLEN SAY HOW TO KILL HIM? LEGEND GOES A DAGGER MADE OF PURE BRASS. I THINK I KNOW WHERE TO GET ONE OF THOSE. WELL, BEFORE WE GO STABBING THINGS INTO COOPER, WE'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE DAMN SURE IT'S HIM. OH, YOU'RE SUCH A STICKLER FOR DETAILS, SAMMY. ALL RIGHT, I'LL ROUND UP THE BLADE. YOU GO CHECK IF COOPER'S GOT BEDBUGS. WELL, I GOT ALL KINDS OF KNIVES. I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT A BRASS ONE, THOUGH. [ GUN COCKS ] WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? CHECK THE TRUNK. YOU? ME. ALL RIGHT!

I MEAN ANY OF THOSE SIGNS OR OMENS APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, MY RIG WILL GO OFF LIKE A FIRE ALARM. YOU MIND? WHAT'S UP, MAN? ASH, WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO DO ALL THIS? M.I.T., BEFORE I GOT BOUNCED FOR FIGHTING. M.I.T.? IT'S A SCHOOL IN BOSTON. OKAY. GIVE US A CALL AS SOON AS YOU KNOW SOMETHING? Sí, Sí, COMPADRE. HEY, LISTEN. IF YOU BOYS NEED A PLACE TO STAY, I GOT A COUPLE BEDS OUT BACK. THANKS, BUT NO. THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO FINISH. OKAY. YOU WERE RIGHT. ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT ME AND DAD. I'M SORRY THAT THE LAST TIME I WAS WITH HIM, I TRIED TO PICK A FIGHT. I'M SORRY THAT I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE ANGRY AT HIM. I MEAN, FOR ALL I KNOW, HE DIED THINKING THAT I HATE HIM. SO, YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW -- IT IS TOO LITTLE. IT'S TOO LATE. I MISS HIM, MAN. AND I FEEL GUILTY AS HELL. AND I'M NOT ALL RIGHT... NOT AT ALL... ...BUT NEITHER ARE YOU. THAT MUCH I KNOW. I'LL LET YOU
