and that means hunting down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can. whoops. let me guess -- you're offering up your own soul? all you got to do is bring sam back. i'll give you one year and one year only. if you try and weasel your way out,then the deal is off. yellow-eyed demon: how certain are you that what you brought back is 100% pure sam? what the hell just happened? that's a devil's gate, a damn door to hell! hope to hell you boys are ready 'cause the war has just begun. sam: hello. hey,sam. hey,bobby. what you doing? oh,same old,same old. you buried in that book again? sam,you want to break dean free of that demon deal, you ain't gonna find the answer in no book. then where,bobby? kid,i wish i knew. so,where's your brother? polling the electorate. what? never mind. well,you boys better pack it up. i think i finally found something. * she looked at me with big brown eyes * [ knock on door ] dean? * and said, "you ain't seen nothing yet" * dean,you -- you conscious? bobby called, and he thinks that maybe we -- oh,god. let me see your knife. what for? so i can gouge my eyes out. it was a beautiful, natural act,sam. it's a part of you i never wanted to see,dean. hey,i appreciate you giving me a little quality time with the doublemint twins. no problem. really? well,i got to say, i was expecting a weary sigh or an eye roll,something. not at all. you deserve to have a little fun. well,i'm in violent agreement with you there. [ chuckles ] what's bobby got? not much. crop failure and a cicada swarm outside of lincoln,nebraska. could be demonic omens. or could just be a bad crop and a bug problem. but it's our only lead. any freaky deaths? nothing bobby could find -- not yet,anyway. it's weird,man. the night the devil's gate opened, all these weirdo storm clouds were sighted over how many cities? 17. 17. you think it would be "apocalypse now," but it's been five days and bubkes. what are the demons waiting for? beats me. driving me crazy. i tell you, if it's gonna be war, i wish it would just start already. be careful what you wish for. hear those cicadas? that can't be a good sign. no. no,it can't. so,we're eating bacon cheeseburgers for breakfast,are we? well,sold my soul. got a year to live. i ain't sweating the cholesterol. so,bobby, what do you think? we got a biblical plague here or what? well,let's find out. looks like the swarm's ground zero. candygram! that's awful. that so can't be a good sign.</i> you hear that? this is supposed to be my birthday party.</i> oh,my god. grandma is making out the invitation list.</i> sue ellen is gonna hire... bobby,what the hell happened here? i don't know. and j.r.'s gonna use it... check for sulfur. ...for one of his big deals! and now you're gonna buy my clothes!</i> i hate this family! bobby: isaac? tamara? [ british accent ] bobby. what the hell are you doing here? i could ask the same. heya,bobby. hello. bleeding here. bobby: isaac,you sure got some nice digs here. yeah. if i can find anything. honey... where's the palo santo? well,where'd you leave it? i don't know,dear. that's why i'm asking. palo santo? it's holy wood from peru. it's toxic to demons like holy water. keeps the bastards nailed down while you're exorcising them. thank you,dear. you'd lose your head if it wasn't for me. so,how long you two been married? eight years this past june. the family that slays together... right. i'm with you there. so,how'd you get started? oh,you know... i'm sorry. it's not -- that's none of my business. it's -- it's all right. well,jenny,if you look as pretty as you sound, then i'd love to have an appletini.</i> yeah. call you. that was the coroner's tech. and? get this -- that whole family, 'cause of death -- dehydration and starvation. there's no signs of restraint, no violence,no struggle. they just sat down and never got up. but there was a fully stocked kitchen just yards away. what is this, a demon attack? if it is,it's not like anything i ever saw, and i've seen plenty. what now? what should we do? uh,we're not gonna do anything.</i> what do you mean? you guys seem nice enough, but this ain't "scooby-doo," and we don't play well with others. we'd cover a lot more ground if we all worked together. no offense,but we're not teaming with the damn fools who let the devil's gate get open in the first place. no offense? isaac,like you've never made a mistake. yeah,locked my keys in the car, turned my laundry pink. never brought on the end of the world,though. [ chuckles ] all right. that's enough. guys,this isn't helping. dean -- look,there are couple hundred more demons out there now. we don't know where they are, when they'll strike. there ain't enough hunters in the world to handle something like this. you brought war down on us -- on all of us.</i> okay. that's quite enough testosterone for now. excuse me. yes? those are...nice shoes. oh,yeah. they are nice.</i> those are nice shoes. aren't they? i want them. sorry. last pair. excuse me. i want those shoes. what,are you crazy? no. what? dean: what happened outside makes you realize how fragile life really is. you got to make every second count. excuse me a minute, would you? sure. dean,what are you doing? i'm comforting the bereaved. what are you doing? working. dead body, possible demon attack -- that kind of stuff. sam,i'm sorry. it's just i don't have much time left,and... ...got to make every second count. yeah,right. sorry. apology accepted. whoa. [ whistles ] looking spiffy,bobby. what were you,a g-man? attorney for the d.a.'s office. i just spoke to the suspect. yeah? so,what do you think? is she possessed or what? don't think so. there's none of the usual signs -- no blackouts, no loss of control. totally lucid. just,she really wanted those shoes.</i> spilled a glass of holy water on her just to be sure. nothing. maybe she's just some random wack job. if it had been an isolated incident,maybe, but first the family, now this? i believe in a lot of things. coincidence ain't one of them. did you boys find anything around here? no sulfur,nothing. well,maybe something. see? i'm working. anything interesting? i don't know yet. might just be a guy... or it might be our guy. what time is it? seven past midnight. you sure this is the right place? no. but i spent all day canvassing this stupid town with this guy's stupid mug, and,supposedly, he drinks at this stupid bar. that's not funny! yeah. uh,all right,so -- so,john doe's name is walter rosen. he's from oak park, just west of chicago. went missing about a week ago. the night the devil's gate opened? yeah. so you think he's possessed? it's a good bet. so,what,he just walks up to someone,touches them, and they go stark raving psycho? those demons that got out at the gate -- they're gonna do all kinds of things we haven't seen. you mean the demons we let out?</i> guys. all right. showtime. wait a minute. what? what did i just say? we don't know what to expect out of this guy. we should tail him till we know for sure. oh,so he kills someone and we just sit here? we're no good dead! and we're not gonna make a move until we know what the score is. hey,bobby,i don't think that's an option. why not? damn it! thanks. you're welcome. pull the car in back. we'll be right out. i love you. i know. what do you think you're doing? i'm just hitting the head. no. i mean,what do you think you're doing here?</i> i don't like hunters in my bar. man,you really walked into the wrong place.</i> hold on. i like the girl. wish i had me a girl like that.</i> i can think of about a thousand things i'd like to do to her. you're not gonna lay one filthy finger on her! i got something for you. here. have a drink on me,hmm? isaac? on the house! isaac! isaac,no! baby,please! oh,he's down! all right,honey. your turn! [ tires screeching ] come on,we got to go! he's dead! get in the car! dean,come on! aah! go,go,go,go, go,go,go,go! tamara: and i say we're going back -- now! sam: hold on a second. i left my husband bloody on the floor! okay,i understand that, but we can't go back. fine. then you stay. but i'm heading back to that bar. i'll go with her. it's suicide,dean! so what? i'm dead already! how you gonna kill 'em? can't shoot 'em. you can't stab 'em. they're not just gonna wait in line to get exorcised! i don't care! we don't even know how many of them there are! yeah,we do. there's seven. do you have any idea who we're up against? no. who? the seven deadly sins, live and in the flesh! "what's in the box?!" brad pitt,"se7en"? no? what's this? "binsfeld's classification of demons." in 1589,binsfeld i.d.'d the seven sins -- not just as human vices but as actual devils. the family -- they were touched by sloth. and the shopper... that's envy's doing -- the customer we got in the next room. i couldn't suss it out at first until isaac. he was touched with an awful gluttony. i don't give a rat's ass if they're the three stooges or the four tops! i'm gonna slaughter every last one of them! we already did it your way. you burst in there half-cocked and look what happened! these demons haven't been topside in half a millennium! we're talking medieval, dark ages! we've never faced anything close to this! so we are gonna take a breath... and figure out what our next move is! i am sorry for your loss. so you know who i am,huh? we do. we're not impressed. why are you here? what are you after? he asked you a question. what do you want? ya! ohh! we already have... what we want. what's that? we're out. we're free. thanks to you, my kind are everywhere. i am legion, for we are many. so me, i'm just celebrating. having a little fun. fun? yeah. fun. see,some people crochet. others golf. me? i like to see people's insides... on their outside. i'm gonna put you down like a dog. please. [ laughs ] you really think you're better than me. [ laughs ] which one of you can cast the first stone,huh? what about you,dean? you're practically a walking billboard of gluttony and lust. and,tamara, all that wrath. ooh. tsk,tsk,tsk, tsk,tsk,tsk,tsk. it's the reason you and isaac became hunters in the first place, isn't it? it's so much easier to drink in the rage than to face what really happened all those years ago. aah! whew! [ laughs ] my point exactly. and you call us sins. we're not sins,man. we are natural human instinct. and you can repress and deny us all you want, but the truth is, you are just animals. horny... greedy... hungry... ...violent animals. and you know what? you'll be slaughtered like animals,too. the others -- they're coming for me. maybe. but they're not gonna find you... 'cause you'll be in hell. someone send this clown packing. my pleasure. exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica... aaaaaaah! i don't think we're gonna have to worry about hunting them. what does that mean? i think maybe this joker's right. they're gonna be hunting us.</i> and they're not gonna quit easy. you guys, why don't you take tamara and head for the hills? i'll stay back,slow them down, buy you a little time. sam: you're insane,dean. just forget about it,okay? sam's rit. there's six of them,guys. we're outmanned, we're outgunned. we'll be dead by dawn. maybe,but there's no place to run that they won't find us. look,if we're going down, we're going down together, all right? let's not make it easy for them. demon's out of the guy. and the guy? he didn't make it. here we go. isaac: tamara! tamara! tamara! tamara! help me! please! i got away, but i'm hurt bad! i need help! it's not him. it's one of those demons. it's possessing his corpse. [ knock on door ] baby! why won't you let me in? you left me behind back there. how could you do that? we swore... at that lake in michigan. remember? we swore we would never leave each other! how did he know that? steady,tamara. you just gonna leave me out here? you just gonna let me die?! i guess that's what you do,dear! like that night those things came to our house... ...came for our daughter! you just let her die,too. you son of a bitch! tamara,no! you're not isaac! fat,drunk,and stupid is no way to go through life,son. exorcizamus te,omnis immundus spiritus,omnis satanica... i suppose you're lust. baby,i'm whatever you want me to be. just stay back. or what? good point. i'm not gonna hurt you -- not yet. not unless you want me to. here's johnny! come on. you really think something like that is gonna fool someone like me? i mean,me? let me guess -- you're pride. the root of all sin. and you... are sam winchester. that's right. i've heard of you. we've all heard of you. the prodigy,the boy king. looking at you now, i got to tell you, don't believe the hype. you think i'm gonna bow to a cut-rate, piss-poor human like you? i have my pride, after all. and now with your yellow-eyed friend dead, i guess i don't really have to do a damn thing,now,do i? you're fair game now,boy, and it's open season. you! who the hell are you? i'm the girl that just saved your ass. well,i just saved yours,too. [ chuckles ] see you around,sam. wait! sam: think she's gonna be all right? no. definitely not. well,you look like hell warmed over.</i> you try exorcising all night and see how you feel. any survivors,bobby? well,the pretty girl and the heavy guy, they'll make it. lifetime of therapy bills ahead,but,still... that's more than you can say for these poor bastards. bobby,that knife -- what kind of blade can kill a demon? yesterday,i would have said there was no such thing. i'm just gonna ask it again -- who was that masked chick? actually,the more troubling question would be, "how come a girl can fight better than you?" three demons,dean... at once. hey,whatever it takes to get you through the night,pal. yeah,well,if you want a troubling question, i got one for you -- if we let out the seven deadly sins, what else did we let out? you're right. that is troubling.</i> see you gents around. tamara? the world just got a lot scarier. be careful. you too. keep your eyes peeled for omens. i'll do the same. you got it. wait,bobby. we can win this war, right? catch you on the next one. so,where to? uh,i don't know. i was thinking louisiana maybe. little early for mardi gras, isn't it? yeah. listen, i was talking to tamara, and she mentioned this hoodoo priestess outside of shreveport that might be able to help us out, you know,with your -- with your demon deal. nah. "nah"? what does that mean,"nah"? sam,no hoodoo spell's gonna break this deal. it's a goose chase. we don't know that. yes,we do. forget it. she can't help. we're not going, and that's that. what about reno,huh? you know what? i've had it. i've been bending over backwards trying to be nice to you, and...i don't care anymore. that didn't last long. yeah,well,you know what? i've been busting my ass trying to keep you alive,dean, and you act like you couldn't care less. what,you got some kind of death wish or something? it's not like that. then what's it like,dean? sam -- please,tell me. we trap the crossroads demon, trick it, try to welsh our way out of the deal in any way, you die,okay? you die. those are the terms. there's no way out of it. if you try to find a way, so help me god, i'm gonna stop you. [ sighs ] how could you make that deal,dean? 'cause i couldn't live with you dead. couldn't do it. so,what, now i live and you die? that's the general idea, yeah. yeah,well, you're a hypocrite,dean. how did you feel when dad sold his soul for you? 'cause i was there. i remember. you were twisted and broken. and now you go and do the same thing...to me. what you did was selfish. yeah,you're right. it was selfish.</i> but i'm okay with that. i'm not. tough. after everything i've done for this family, i think i'm entitled. truth is,i'm tired,sam. i don't know, it's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel. it's hellfire,dean. whatever. you're alive, i feel good... for the first time in a long time. i got a year to live,sam. i'd like to make the most of it. so what do you say we kill some evil sons of bitches and we raise
