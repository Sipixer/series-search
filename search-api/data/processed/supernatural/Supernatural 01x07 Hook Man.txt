Here, wear this. Um... I don't know if this is really me. Lori, there's a hot chick buried somewhere in there. Okay, okay. so? Damn, girl! He's not gonna know what hit him. okay, I think he's probably downstairs. I'll see you later. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. There's nothing you wouldn't do. It's true. I thought we were going to the party. Well, we can't arrive on time. You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you brought me here on purpose. What? I'm offended. Yeah, I'm sure. Do you want to get that? Definitely not. No. It's okay. Hey, I mean it. What was that? I don't know. What is that? Rich, no! Just wait here. What the hell? Rich, let's go. Aah! Aah! Rich? Rich? Rich, where are you? Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you for your time. Your half-caff double venti vanilla latte is getting cold over here, Francis. Byte me. So, anything? I had them check the FBI's missing-persons databank. No "John Does" fitting that description. I even ran his plates for traffic violations. I'm telling you, I don't think dad wants to be found. Check this out. News item out of plains courier, Ankeny, Iowa. It's about 100 miles from here. "Mutilated body was found near the victim's car parked on 9 mile road." Keep reading. "Authorities are unable to provide "a realistic description of the killer." "The sole eyewitness, whose name has been withheld, is quoted as saying the attacker was invisible." Could be something interesting. It could be nothing. One witness who didn't see anything doesn't mean it's the invisible man. But what if it is? Dad would check it out. Why are we here? Victim lived here. Nice wheels. We're your fraternity brothersfrom ohio. We're new in town, transfers. Looking for a place to stay. Who are you? We're your new roommates. Do me a favor?Get my back. Big game today. He's the artist. Things he can dowith a brush... so... murph, is it true? What? We heard one of the guys heregot killed last week. Yeah. What happened? They're saying some psychowith a knife, maybe a drifterpassing through. Rich was a good guy. Rich was with somebody? Not just somebody Lori Sorenson. Who's lori sorenson? You missed a spotdown on the back. Lori's a freshman.She's a local. Super hot. And get this she's a reverend's daughter. You wouldn't happen to know which church, would you? Our hearts go out to the family of the young man who perished, and my personal prayers of thanks go out, as well, because I believe he died trying to protect my daughter. And now, as time heals all our wounds, we should reflect on what this tragedy means to us as a church... ..as a community, and as a family. The loss of a young person is particularly tragic. A life unlived is the saddest of passings. So, please, let us pray for peace, for guidance, and for the power to protect our children. I can't. It's sunday night. It's just us girls. We're gonna do tequila shots and watch "reality bites." My dad makes dinnerevery sunday night. Come on, lori. I know this has been hard, but you are allowed to have fun. I'll try. Okay. Are you lori? Yeah. My name is Sam. This is my brother, Dean. We just transferred hereto the university. I saw you inside. We don't want to bother you. We just heard about what happened. We wanted to say how sorry we were. I kind of know what you're going through. I-I saw someone get hurt once. It's something you don't forget. Dad, hum... This is Sam and Dean. They're new students. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. I must say that was an inspiring sermon. Thank you very much. It's so nice to find young people who are open to the lord's message. Listen, we're new in town, actually, and we're looking for a... tell me, Lori, what are the police saying? Well, they don't have a lot to go on. I think they blame me for that. What do you mean? My story. I was so scared, I... guess I was seeing things. That doesn't mean it wasn't real. So you believe her? I do. And I think she's hot, too. No, man, there's something in her eyes. And listen to this. She heard scratching on the roof and found the bloody body suspended upside down over the car. Bloody body suspended? That sounds like the hookman legend. That's one of the most famous urban legends. You don't think that we're dealing with the hookman. Every urban legend has a source, a place where it all began. What about the scratches and the tire punctures and the invisible killer? Maybe the hookman isn't a man at all. What if it's some kind of spirit? Here you go. Arrest records going back to 1851. Thanks. Okay. This is how you spent four good years of your life, huh? Welcome to higher education. Hey, check this out. a preacher named Jacob Karns was arrested for murder. He was so angry over the red-light district in town that one night he killed 13 prostitutes. "Some of the deceased were found in their beds, "sheets soaked with blood, others suspended upside down from the limbs of trees as a warning against sins of the flesh." Get this he murder weapon? Looks like the preacher lost his hand in an accident, had it replaced with a silver hook. Look where all this happened. 9 mile road. Same place where the frat boy was killed. Nice job, Dr. Venkman. Let's check it out. I know this is your first time really living alone since mom died. That's not it. I worry about you. There are 22 girls in there. I'm perfectly safe. That's what I'm worried about. You don't think I know what goes on in there? Dad, do we have to have this argument again? I'm over 18. I can live my own life. Which means partying with that roommate of yours. I'm an adult. I can take care of myself. Good night. Lori. Lori, come Lori. Taylor, are you awake? Here you go. If it is a spirit, buckshot won't do much good.# Yeah. Rock salt. Hmm. Salt being a spirit deterrent. Yep. It won't kill 'em, but it'll slow 'em down. That's pretty good. You and dad think of this? I told you, you don't have to be a college graduate to be a genius. Over there, over there. Put the gun down now! Now! Hands behind your head! Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay. Get down on your knees! Come on, do it! On your knees. Get down on your bellies. Come on, do it. He had the gun. Oh, my god! Saved your ass. Talked the sheriff down to a fine, dude. I'm Matlock. But how? Told him you were a dumb-ass pledge and that we were hazing you. What about the shotgun? I said that you were hunting ghosts and that spirits are repelled by rock salt. You know, typical hell week prank. And he believed you? Well, you look like a dumb-ass pledge. I just want to take her home. I understand, reverend, but Lori's now connected to two murders and I can't ignore that. Listen to me. Arrest her now or let me take her home. Make sure she's available for questioning. Thank you. Sweet heart, give it normal. Okay. Here we go. Why would the hookman have come here? This is a long way from 9 mile road. Maybe he's not haunting the scene of his crime. Maybe it's about something else. Dude, sorority girls. Think we'll see a naked pillow fight? Try and be quiet, will you? Me be quiet? You be quiet. "Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?" That's right out of the legend. Yeah, that's classic hookman, all right. It's definitely a spirit. Yeah. I've never smelled ozone this strong before. Hey, come here. Does that look familiar to you? It's the same symbol. Seems like it is the spirit of Jacob Karns. Let's find the Dude's grave, salt and burn the bones, and put him down. "After execution, Jacob Karns was laid to rest in old north cemetery in an unmarked grave." Super. Okay, so, we know it's Jacob Karns, but we still don't know where he'll manifest next. Or why. I'll take a wild guess about why. I think your friend Lori has something to do with this. You've been holding out on me. This college thing is awesome! This wasn't really my experience. Let me guess library, studying, straight as. What a geek. Did you do your homework? Yeah, it was bugging me. How is the hookman tied with Lori? I think I came up with something. 1932 "clergyman arrested for murder." 1967 "seminarian held in hippie rampage." There's a pattern here. In both cases, the suspect was a man of religion who openly preached against immorality and then found himself wanted for killings he claimed were the work of an invisible force, killings carried out get this with a sharp instrument. What's the connection to Lori? A man of religion who openly preaches against immorality. Except this time instead of saving the whole town, he's just trying to save his only daughter. Reverend Sorenson. Do you think he's summoning the spirit? Maybe. Or you know how a poltergeist can haunt a person instead of a place? The spirit latches onto the reverend's repressed emotions, feeds off them. Without the reverend ever even knowing it. Either way, you should keep an eye on Lori tonight. What about you? I'm gonna go see if I can find that unmarked grave. Here we go. That's it. Next time, I get to watch the cute girl's house. Hello, preacher. I saw you from upstairs. What are you doing here? I'm keeping an eye on the place. I was worried. About me? Yeah, sorry. No, it's cool. I already called the cops. No, seriously, I think you're sweet, which is probably why you should run away from me as fast as you can. Why would you say that? It's like I'm cursed or something. People around me keep dying. I think I know how you feel. Goodbye, preacher. No one will talk to me anymore... except you. The sheriff thinks I'm a suspect. And you know what my dad will say? "Pave faith." What does he know about faith? I heard you guys fighting before. He's seeing a woman, a married woman. I just found out. She comes to our church with her husband, I know her kids, and he talks to me about religion, about morality? It's like on one hand, you know, just do what you want and be happy, but he taught me raised me to believe that if you do something wrong, you will get punished. I just don't know what to think anymore. Sam? Lori, I can't. That someone you lost? I'm sorry. Lori. Come inside, please. I'll come in when I'm ready. Ack! Aah! No! No! Dad! It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. We were just talking. Then Lori's dad came out, and then he appeared. A big man carrying a weapon, some kind of a hook? Yes, sir. Ever seen him before? No, sir. Son, it seems every time I turn around, I'm seeing you. I suggest you try to stay out of trouble. Yes, sir. It's all right. I'm with him. That's my brother. Hey, brother. Let him through. Thanks. Go ahead. You okay? Yeah. What the hell happened? Hookman. You saw him? Damn right. Why didn't you torch the bones? You talk about I did. You sure it's the spirit of Jacob Karns? Sure as hell looked like him. And that's not all. I don't think the spirit is latching onto the reverend. Yeah, the guy wouldn't send the hookman after himself. I think it's latching onto Lori. Last night she found out that her father is having an affair with a married woman. So what? So, she's upset about it. She's upset about the immorality of it. She was raised to believe that if you do something wrong, you get punished. Okay, so she's conflicted, and the spirit of preacher Karns is latching onto her emotions and doing the punishing for her. Right. Rich comes on too strong. Taylor tries to make her into a party girl. Dad has an affair. Remind me not to piss this girl off. But I burned those bones. I buried them in salt. Why didn't that stop him? You must've missed something. No, I burned everything in that coffin. Did you get the hook? The hook? It was the murder weapon, and in a way it was part of him. So, like the bones, the hook is a source of his power. So, if we find the hook... both: We stop the hookman. Here's something,I think. Logbook, Iowa state penitentiary. "Karns, Jacob personal affects, disposition thereof." Does it mention the hook? "Upon execution, all earthly items shall be remanded "to the prisoner's house of worship, St. Barnabas church." Isn't that where Lori's father preaches? Yeah. Where Lori lives? That's why the hookman's been haunting reverends and reverends' daughters for the past 200 years. Yeah but if the hook were at the church or Lori's house, don't you think someone might've seen it? I mean, a blood-stained, silver-handled hook? Check the church records. "St. Barnabas donations,1862. Received silver-handled hook from state penitentiary. Reforged." They melted it down, made it into something else. All right. We can't take any chances. Anything silver goes in the fire. I agree. So Lori's still at the hospital. We'll have to break in. All right, take your pick. I'll take the house. Okay. Hey. Stay out of her underwear drawer. I got everything that even looks silver. Better safe than sorry. Move, move. Lori? What are you doing here? What is it? I've been trying to understand what's been happening, why? Now I know, so I'm praying for forgiveness. Forgiveness for what? Don't you see? I'm to blame for all this. I've read in the bible about avenging angels. Trust me. This guy, he's no angel. I was so angry at my father. Part of me wanted him punished, and then he came and he punished him. It's not your fault. Yes, it is. I don't know how, but it is. I killed rich. Taylor, too. I nearly killed my father. Lori. I can see it now. They didn't deserve to be punished. I do. Come on. We got to go. Go! Come on! No! Come on, get up. Sam, drop! I thought we got all the silver. Why is he still here? Maybe we missed something. Lori, where did you get that chain? My father gave it to me. Where'd your dad get it? It was a church heirloom. He gave it to me. Is it silver? Yes. Sam. And you saw him, too, the man with the hook? Yes, I told you. We all saw him. We fought him off, and then he ran. And that's all? Yeah, that's all. Listen, you and your brother oh, don't worry. We're leaving town. You gonna be okay? Yeah. I still don't know what happened, but... I do know you saved my life.
