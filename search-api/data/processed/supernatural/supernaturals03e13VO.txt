It was almost 11. I came out, and i was like, "what's going on?" - And i was like... - Wait, watch this. Oh! He got blasted. It was crazy. What's a death echo? We got a problem here. That ghost ain't it. Yeah, that's real. Like, that happened. What's a death echo? Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay? They keep replaying how they died over and over and over again, Usually in the place where they were ganked. It's about as dangerous as a scary movie. Maybe the echo's not dangerous, but maybe something else is. You're right. All right, we need to get out of here, guys. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Pack it up. What about all of our equipment? We got more material. We got all kinds of stuff. We'll make you guys recurring guest stars. Wait! Where's corbett? I wish to communicate with the restless spirits here. Uh, lights out? Oh, i think i got night vision here. That's better. No man left behind. That was corbett. We'll get him! Go back! Guys! No! Where are you, dude? Tell us where you are! Let me go! Guys! You need to come back, corbett. No!! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on. Corbett's... He's not here. Let's go. Let's go. No. No. No. But that's corbett. No, that was corbett. Didn't you hear that? Go, go, go, come on. Guys. Guys. Guys. Here we go. Here we go. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Hey. Hey. Hey. Watch him. Watch him. Go. Go. Move. Move. Turn it off! Oh, god, what's happened? Oh, god. He's gone. He just disappeared. Let's just go through all the angles. Let's go through all the cameras we have. - Well, it's 12:04, dean. You good? You happy? - Yeah, i am happy. "Let's go hunt the morton house," you said. "It's our grand canyon." - I don't want to hear this. - You got two months left, dean. Instead, we're gonna die tonight. What the hell is going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Every door, every window, I'm guessing every exit out of this house... They're all sealed. - Why are they sealed? - It's a supernatural lockdown, okay? Whatever took corbett doesn't want us to leave, And it's no death echo. This is a bad mother, and it wants us scared. Or it just wants us. Uh, guys, the camera's fritzing again. Guys, the emf's starting to spike. Everybody, stay close. There's something coming. Is this the same echo you guys saw earlier? No, it's a different guy. Multiple echoes? What the hell's going on? Beats me. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Uh, hey, buddy! Hey. Hey. Wake up. You're dead! - Hello! - What's he doing? What's he doing? It's rare, but sometimes you can shock an echo out of its loop If you can talk to the part of the ghost that's still human, But usually you have to have some kind of connection to the deceased. Come on! Wake up! Be dead! You guys hear that? What's that sound? You guys hear that? Snap out of it, buddy, huh? Come on, what are you waiting for? You're gonzo! You're dead! Hey! Where the hell did it go? Dude, there's no records of any of this here. No one got shot here. Obviously, no one got run over by a freaking train. - Stay close. - Did the echoes take corbett? Yes. No. I don't know. We don't know That's what we're trying to figure out, okay? All right, stay close. Okay, look, death echoes are ghosts, okay? Now, ghosts... they usually haunt places where they lived or where they died. Except these mooks didn't live or die here. - Right. - So, what are they doing here? Hey, give the lady a cigar. All right, seriously, does looking at this nightmare Through that camera make you feel better or something? I mean... Well, yeah. Uh, yeah. I think so. Freeman daggett, house's last owner, Officially commended for 20 years of fine service At the gamble general hospital. He's a doctor? Janitor. This looks like his den. When'd you say he died, 64? - Yeah, heart attack. - What are these, c-Rations? Yeah, army-Issued, three squares... Like a lifetime supply. God, is that all he ate? One-Stop shopping. Hello. Locked. Oh, come on, guys. This is ridiculous. I mean, how the hell is this supposed to find corbett, huh? We should be digging up the friggin' floorboards right now. "Survival under atomic attack." An optimist. Crap. Crap. Taxidermy. Okay. You said daggett was a hospital janitor? Yeah. Got three toe tags here... One, death by gunshots, Train accident, and suicide. What? Well, that explains why all the death echoes are here. They're here because their bodies are here Somewhere in the house. Daggett brought the remains home from the morgue to play. Wait a minute. Closer to the herd, okay? She's fine. Harry. Harry, i got an 8.6 and climbing fast. Something huge is coming. Look. Something big is coming. It's past 11, you guys. What? Nobody move! Hold on. Hold on. Stay quiet. It's really cold in here. Some kind of surge. Oh, no. God, i am so scared. I'm so scared. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, maggie. My best friend... And my best sister. - Listen, ed. - Are you banging my sister? No! No! Hold my glasses. What the are you doing?! Cut it out! We're down by two people. Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me my glasses. Did he knock my... my tooth there? Uh, no. Thanks, spruce. Yeah, it's my fault. That's real great. That's nice. Thanks. Hey, you got to keep listening to my voice, okay? I'm right here. Stay awake. Don't listen. It stops hurting, so don't worry. Corbett, stay with me. Stay with me, you got it? I'm right here. Hey. Stay with me. Don't. Don't. No. No! - Corbett! Where'd you guys go? - Where are you guys? Dean, what are you doing? So daggett was a cold war nut, okay? He was... he was an amateur taxidermist. He liked to slow dance with cadavers, and all he ate were c-Rations, - So what the hell are we looking for?! - Horrible little life. Yeah, a lonely life. A cold war life. He was scared. - He was scared. He was scared. - Scared of what? What? Dean, where are you going? Wait, don't leave me in here, you guys. Get away from me. This won't hurt. It's okay. It's okay. Relax. Relax. - Where are you going? - Guys like daggett back then, The ones who were really scared of the russkies... They built bomb shelters. I'm guessing he's got one. I'll bet you it's in the basement. Um, who closed the door? It did. It wants to separate us. - Ed! Listen to me! - What? There's some salt in my duffle. Make a circle and get inside. - Inside your duffle bag? - In the salt, you idiot! Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Harry, hurry up. Get in the circle. Get in the circle. Come on. Come on. Quick. Quick. Guys, guys, i don't want to die, And i don't want you to die. Harry, listen... listen to me, okay? Listen. If we don't die... ... it's totally okay if you, uh, do my sister. Nice. Guys. It's coming again. My camera. Get in close. Why does this keep happening? Why does this keep happening? Oh, god. Oh, god. Hey, can i ask you something? - What? - Earlier, you and sam... He said you had two months left? Yeah, it's complicated. A while ago, sam... No. No. No. I'm not gonna whine about my problems To some reality show. I'm gonna do my job. - Is it cancer? - Shut up. You hear that? I've been waiting for some more friends. I get lonely. But you're comin to my party, aren't you? - Is that music? - Yeah, it's coming from behind this wall. You're strong. You'll stay a good, long time. Yeah? Corbett's a... he's a death echo. He's reliving his own murder. Over and over forever. What's this daggett guy's problem anyway? Loneliness. He's never heard of a realdoll? No, no, no, daggett was the norman bates, Stuff-Your-Mother kind of lonely. That's why he lifted these bodies from the morgue, Threw himself a birthday party, Except they were the only ones who would come. Anyway, so, at midnight, he sealed them in the bomb shelter And went upstairs and o.D.'D on horse tranqs. How do you know this? Cause he told me. Oh. Yeah. Okay, so now that he's dead, what? Same song, different verse, Trying to get people to come to his party? Pretty much, yeah. Stay forever. Are those real bullets? It's rock salt. Oh, no. Oh, god. Wait, guys. Guys, it's... it's corbett. He's... he's... he's trapped. He's in a lot of pain, you know? We got to try and... We got to try and pull him out of his loop. We have to. - Oh, god. - Don't cross the line of salt. Corbett, listen to me. Okay, i'm not gonna hurt you. Listen. Listen. Oh, god. Corbett. Oh. Oh, god. Oh, i can't, okay? He's not hearing me, okay? He won't stop dying. Seriously... you're still shooting? It makes him feel better. Don't ask. Ah, hell, guys. Get in your ghost-Role thing. Something's coming. I know how we can get through to him. How? He had feelings for you. He wanted you. - Wanted me to what? - You know. And you know what you've got to do. You can do it, ed. You've always been the brave one. Yes, you can. You make us brave... maggie, right? Yeah. I can do. You got to go be gay for that poor, dead intern. You got to send him into the light. Maggie, no. No. It's okay. Corbett, look. Hey, it's just ed, buddy. It's just me. Hey, hey, corbett, listen to me. Listen to me. I... we... You meant... Corbett, you meant a lot to the team. You meant... You meant a lot to me. You know, never back down... Never say a bad word? I remember that, corbett. I remember that. I remember because i love you, corbett. I really, truly love you. Do you remember that? Do you? Yeah. Yeah, corbett, it's... Corbett, yeah, it's me. It's me. Look at me. You got to help us, man. You have to help us, corbett. Please. Please. Please help us right now. Take it easy. You all right? Uh, guys... This is bad... very bad. You all right, dude? You all right? God. Leap year, february 29th, the morton house. A tragic day... A day of souls bound in torment, Of lives held in cruel balance. But the ghostfacers... they did the best that they could. We lost a beloved friend, But we gained new allies. We know this much... That every day, including today, Is a new beginning. We learned more than we can say In the brutal feat of the morton house. The ghostfacers were forced to face something Far more scary than ghosts. They were forced to face themselves. War changes man. And maggie. War changes man... And one woman. You know, corbett, we just... Oh, gosh, we just like to think That you're out there watching over us. As far as we're concerned, You're not an intern anymore. You have more than earned full ghostfacer status. Plus, it'd be cool to have a ghost on the team. Yeah. You know, and here we were, Thinking that, you know, we were teaching you, And all this time, you were teaching us... About heart, About dedication, and... About how gay love can pierce through the veil of death And save the day. Thank you, alan j. Corbett. Go well into that starry night, young turk. Go well. Come on, spruce. I got to get all this stuff packed up. So? Pack and talk. - I don't know what to say. - Say what comes to mind. This is one of our confessional moments, corbett, So confess. What do you think was gonna happen tonight? What do you think's gonna happen tonight on this trip? I think tonight... i really do... I think all our dream are gonna come true. Does that sound stupid? Kind of does, yeah. So, guys, what do you think? You all right? You know, i kind of think it was half awesome. Half awesome... that's full-On good, right? Yeah. I mean, it's bizarre how y'all are able to... To honor corbett's memory while grossly exploiting the manner of his death. Well done. Yeah, that's a real tight rope you guys are walking. Yeah. All right, guys. No, that's reality, man. Yeah. Corbett gave his life searching for the truth, And it is our job over here to share it with the world. Right. Well, um, our experience... You know what you get when you show the world the truth? A straightjacket or a punch in the face... - Sometimes both. - Right. Oh, come on, guys, don't be 'facer haters Because we happen to have gotten the footage of the century. Oh, yeah. - You got us there. - Yeah. Yeah, well, we'll see you guys around. Dicks. Oh, yeah. Start laying off some dvds. Sounds like a good idea, spruce. You know, guys, i think we're gonna need a bigger office here, you know, Cause we're gonna go national, And then it's gonna go international, and then... Hey, menudo left their dance bag behind. What's inside, huh? What the hell is this? Uh, i seem to be having some technical difficulty over here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! "No operating system found"? Wait a minute. We clean? No-O-O-O-O-O-O! Electromagnet wiped out every tape and hard drive they have. World just isn't ready for the ghostfacers. That's too bad. I kind of liked the show.
