- Yeah, I want this rawhead extra frickin’ crispy. - And remember, you only get one shot with these things. - So make it count. - On three. One. Two. Three. - Is it still here? Ok. Grab your sister’s hand, come on, we gotta get you out of here. - Alright, go! - Sam! - Sam, get ‘em outta here! - You take this! - Come on. - Dean! - Dean, hey. - Hey. - Sir, I’m so sorry to ask. There doesn’t seem to be any insurance on file. - Right. Uh, ok. - Okay, Mr. Burkovitz. - Look, we can finish this up later. - No, no, it’s okay. - We were just taking a shortcut through the neighborhood. And, um, the windows were rolled down, we heard some screaming. - We drove past the house, and we stopped. Ran in. - And you found the kids in the basement? - Yeah. - Well, thank God you did. - Excuse me. - Sure. Thanks for your help. - Hey, Doc. Is he— - He’s resting. - And? - The electrocution triggered a heart attack. Pretty massive, I’m afraid. - His heart—it’s damaged. - How damaged? - We’ve done all we can. - We can try and keep him comfortable at this point. But, I’d give him a couple weeks, at most, maybe a month. - No, no. There’s—there’s gotta be something you can do, some kind of treatment. - We can’t work miracles. I really am sorry. - Have you ever actually watched daytime TV? It’s terrible. - I talked to your doctor. - That fabric softener teddy bear. Oh, I’m gonna hunt that little bitch down. - Dean. - Yeah. Alright, well, looks like you’re gonna leave town without me. - What are you talking about? I’m not gonna leave you here. - Hey, you better take care of that car. Or, I swear, I’ll haunt your ass. - I don’t think that’s funny. - Oh, come on, it’s a little funny. - Look, Sammy, what can I say, man, it’s a dangerous gig. - I drew the short straw. That’s it, end of story. - Don’t talk like that, alright? We still have options. - What options? - Yeah, burial or cremation. - And I know it’s not easy. But I’m gonna die. And you can’t stop it. - Watch me. - This is John Winchester. I can’t be reached. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean. 866-907-3235. He can help. - Hey, Dad. It’s Sam. Uh….you probably won’t even get this, but, uh….It’s Dean. - He’s sick, and uh….the doctors say there’s nothing they can do. - Um….but, uh, they don’t know the things we know, right? - So, don’t worry, cause, uh…. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get him better. - Alright….just wanted you to know. - What the hell are you doing here? - I checked myself out. - What, are you crazy? - Well, I’m not gonna die in a hospital where the nurses aren’t even hot. - You know, this whole I- laugh-in-the-face-of-death thing? It’s crap. I can see right through it. - Yeah, whatever, dude. Have you even slept? You look worse than me. - I’ve been scouring the Internet for the last three days. - Calling every contact in Dad’s journal. - For what? - For a way to help you. - One of Dad’s friends, Joshua, he called me back. - Told me about a guy in Nebraska. A specialist. - You’re not gonna let me die in peace, are you? - I’m not gonna let you die, period. - We’re going. - I got it. Man, you are a lying bastard. Thought you said we were going to see a doctor. - I believe I said a specialist. Look, Dean, this guy’s supposed to be the real deal. - I can’t believe you brought me here to see some guy who heals people out of a tent. - Reverend LeGrange is a great man. - Yeah, that’s nice. - I have a right to protest. This man is a fraud. And he’s bilking all these people out of their hard - earned money. - I take it he’s not part of the flock. - But when people see something they can’t explain, there’s controversy. - Come on, Sam, a faith healer? - Maybe it’s time to have a little faith, Dean. - You know what I’ve got faith in? Reality. Knowing what’s really going on. - How can you be a skeptic? With the things we see everyday? - We see them, we know they’re real. - But if you know evil’s out there, how can you not believe good’s out there, too? - Because I’ve seen what evil does to good people. - Maybe God works in mysterious ways. - Maybe he does. - I think you just turned me around on the subject. - Yeah, I’m sure. - I’m Dean. This is Sam. - Layla. - So, if you’re not a believer, then why are you here? - Apparently my brother here believes enough for the both of us. - Come on, Layla. It’s about to start. - Well, I bet you she can work in some mysterious ways. - Yeah, peace, love, and trust all over. - Come on. - What are you doing? Let’s sit here. - We’re sitting up front. - What? Why? Oh, come on, Sam. This is ridiculous. I’m good, dude, get off me. - Perfect. - Yeah, perfect. - Each morning, my wife, Sue Ann, reads me the news. - Never seems good, does it? - Seems like there’s always someone committing some immoral, unspeakable act. - But, I say to you, God is watching. - God rewards the good, and He punishes the corrupt. - Who does the healing here, friends? The Lord who guides me in choosing who to heal by helping me see into people’s hearts. - Yeah, or into their wallets. - You think so, young man? - Sorry. - No, no. Don’t be. - Just watch what you say around a blind man, we’ve got real sharp ears. - What’s your name, son? - Dean. - Dean. I want—I want you to come up here with me. - No, that’s ok. - What are you doing? - You’ve come here to be healed, haven’t you? - Well, yeah, but— - No, maybe you should just pick someone else. - Oh, no, I didn’t pick you, Dean, the Lord did. - Get up there! - You ready? - Look, no disrespect, but I’m not exactly a believer. - You will be, son. You will be. - Pray with me, friends. - Alright, now. - Alright, now. - Alright, now. - Dean! - Say something. - So, you really feel okay? - I feel fine, Sam. - Well, according to all your tests, there’s nothing wrong with your heart. - No sign there ever was. - Not that a man your age should be having heart trouble, but, still it’s strange it does happen. - What do you mean, strange? - Just yesterday, a young guy like you, 27, athletic. Out of nowhere, heart attack. - Thanks, Doc. - Oh, no problem. - That’s odd. - Maybe it’s a coincidence. People’s hearts give out all the time, man. - No, they don’t. - Look, Dean, do we really have to look this one in the mouth? - Why can’t we just be thankful that the guy saved your life and move on? - Because I can’t shake this feeling, that’s why. - What feeling? - When I was healed, I just—I felt wrong. - I felt cold. And for a second, I saw someone. This, uh, this old man. And I’m telling you, Sam, it was a spirit. - But if there was something there, Dean, I think I would’ve seen it, too. I mean, I’ve been seeing an awful lot of things lately. - Well, excuse me, psychic wonder. But you’re just gonna need a little faith on this one. - Sam, I’ve been hunting long enough to trust a feeling like this. - Yeah, alright. - So, what do you wanna do? - I want you to go check out the heart attack guy. I’m gonna visit the reverend. - I feel great. Just trying to, you know, make sense of what happened. - A miracle is what happened. - Well, miracles come so often around Roy. - When did they start? The miracles. - Woke up one morning, stone blind. Doctors figured out I had cancer. - Told me I had maybe a month. So, uh, we prayed for a miracle. - Now, I was weak, but I told Sue Ann: “You just keep right on praying.” - I went into a coma. Doctors said I wouldn’t wake up, but I did. - And the cancer was gone. - If it wasn’t for these eyes, no one would believe I’d ever had it. - And suddenly you could heal people. - I discovered it afterward, yes. - God’s blessed me in many ways. - And his flock just swelled overnight. - And this is just the beginning. - Can I ask you one last question? - Of course you can. - Why? Why me? - Out of all the sick people, why save me? - Well, like I said before, the Lord guides me. - I looked into your heart, and you just stood out from all the rest. - What did you see in my heart? - A young man with an important purpose. A job to do. - And it isn’t finished. - I’m telling you, he seemed healthy. Swam every day, didn’t smoke. - So, a heart attack just kind of seemed, well, bizarre. - And you said he was running, right before he collapsed? - Yeah, yeah, he was freaking out. - He said that something was, uh, was after him. - Did he say what? - Well, thin air is what. I mean, it wasn’t anything. - Alright, thanks. - Hey, buddy? Your, uh, your clock’s busted. - Oh, yeah, we, uh, can’t get it workin’. Just froze at 4:17. - Is that the same time Marshall died? - How’d you know? - Dean, hey. - Hey. - How you feeling? - I feel good. Cured, I guess. - What are you doing here? - You know, my mom, she wanted to talk to the reverend. - Layla? - Yes, I’m here again. - Well, I’m sorry, but Roy is resting, and he won’t be seeing anyone else right now. - Sue Ann, please. This is our sixth time, he’s got to see us. - Roy is well aware of Layla’s situation. And he very much wants to help just as soon as the Lord allows. - Have faith, Mrs. Rourke. - Why are you still even here? You got what you wanted. - Mom. Stop. - No, Layla, this is too much. - We’ve been to every single service. If Roy would stop choosing these strangers over you. - Strangers who don’t even believe. I just can’t pray any harder. - Layla, what’s wrong? - I have this thing…. - It’s a brain tumor. - It’s inoperable. In six months, the doctors say... - I’m sorry. - It’s okay. - No. It isn’t. - Why do you deserve to live more than my daughter? - What’d you find out? - I’m sorry. - Sorry about what? - Marshall Hall died at 4:17. - The exact time I was healed. - Yeah. - So, I put together a list of everyone Roy’s healed, six people over the past year - And I cross-checked them with the local obits. Every time someone was healed, someone else died. - And each time, the victim died of the same symptom LeGrange was healing at the time. - Someone’s healed of cancer, someone else dies of cancer? - Somehow. - LeGrange—he’s trading a life for another. - Hello? - Wait, wait, wait. So, Marshall Hall died to save me? - Dean, the guy probably would’ve died anyway. - And someone else would’ve been healed. - You never should’ve brought me here. - Dean, I was just trying to save your life. - But, Sam, some guy is dead now because of me. - I didn’t know. - Pray with me, friends. - The thing I don’t understand is how is Roy doing it? How’s he trading a life for a life? - Oh, he’s not doing it. Something else is doing it for him. - What do you mean? - The old man I saw on stage. - I didn’t wanna believe it, but deep down I knew it. - What are you talking about? - There’s only one thing that can give and take life like that. - We’re dealing with a reaper. - You really think it’s the Grim Reaper? Angel of death, collect your soul, the whole deal? - No, no, no. Not the Reaper, a reaper. - There’s reaper lore in pretty much every culture on Earth. Go by a hundred different names. - It’s possible that there’s more than one of ‘em. - But you said you saw a dude in a suit. - Well, what, do you think he should’ve been workin’ the whole black robe thing? - You said it yourself that the clock stopped, right? - Reapers stop time. And you can only see ‘em when they’re comin’ at you, which is why I could see it and you couldn’t. - There’s nothing else it could be, Sam. The question is how’s Roy controllin’ the damn thing? - That cross. - What? - There was this cross. I noticed it in the church tent, I knew I had seen it before. - Here. - A tarot? It makes sense. I mean, tarot dates back to the early Christian era, right? - When some priests were still using magic? And a few of them veered into the dark stuff. - Necromancy, and how to push death away, how to cause it. - So, Roy is using black magic to bind the reaper? - If he is, he’s riding the whirlwind. It’s like putting a dog leash on a Great White. - Ok, then we stop Roy. - How? - You know how. - Wait, what the hell are you talking about, Dean? We can’t kill Roy. - Sam, the guy’s playing God, he’s deciding who lives and who dies, that’s a monster in my book. - No, we’re not gonna kill a human being, Dean. - We do that, we’re no better than he is. - Okay, so we can’t kill Roy, we can’t kill death. Any bright ideas, college boy? - Okay, uh, if Roy is using some kind of black spell on the reaper, we’ve gotta figure out what it is. - And how to break it. - If Roy is using a spell, there might be a spell book. - See if you can find it. - Hurry up, too, the service starts in fifteen minutes. I’ll try to stall Roy. - Roy LeGrange is a fraud. He’s no healer. - Amen, brother. - You keep up the good word. - What do you got? - Roy’s choosing victims he sees as immoral. And I think I know who’s next on his list. - Remember that protestor? - The guy in the parking lot? - Yeah. Yeah, I’ll find him. But you can’t let Roy heal anyone, alright? - Layla. Layla Rourke, come up here, child. - Oh, man. - Layla, listen to me, you can’t go up there. - Why not? We’ve waited for months. - You can’t let Roy heal you. - I don’t understand. I mean, Roy healed you, didn’t he? Why wouldn’t I at least let him try? - Because if you do, something bad is gonna happen. I can’t explain, I just need you to believe me. - Layla. - Please. - I’m sorry. - Layla. Layla! - Help! - Pray with me, friends. - I hope you’re ready. - I am. - Help! Help me, please! - Where is it? - It’s right there! - Alright, come on! - Fire! - Hey, tent’s on fire! - Everybody, get out of here! - No! No, please! - Please, don’t stop! Please! Reverend, please! Please! - Friends, if you’d all just leave the tent in an orderly fashion, then we can figure out what’s going on out there. - I did it. I stopped Roy. - David, I think it’s okay. - No! - Dean, it didn’t work! The reaper’s still comin’! - I’m tellin’ you! I’m tellin’ you, it must not have worked. Roy must not be controlling this thing! - Well, then who the hell is? - Sue Ann. - Help! Help me! Help! - I got ya. I got ya. - Thank God. - I just don’t understand. After everything we’ve done for you, after Roy healed you. - We’re very, very disappointed, Dean. - You can let him go, I’m not gonna press charges. The Lord will deal with him as he sees fit. - We catch you around here again, son, we’ll put the fear of God in you, understand? - Yes, sir. Fear of God. Got it. - Layla. - Why would you do that, Dean? When it could’ve been my only chance. - He’s not a healer. - He healed you. - I know it doesn’t seem fair. And I wish I could explain, but Roy is not the answer. I’m sorry. - Goodbye, Dean. - I wish you luck. I really do. - Same to you. - You deserve it a lot more than me. - Private session tonight. No interruptions. I give you my word. I’ll heal your daughter. - Thank you, Reverend. God bless you. - So Roy really believes? - I don’t think he has any idea what his wife’s doing. - Well, I found this hidden in their library. - It’s ancient. Written by a priest who went dark side. - There’s a binding spell in here for trapping a reaper. - Must be a hell of a spell. - Yeah. You’ve got to build a black altar. - With seriously dark stuff. Bones, human blood. - To cross the line like that, that preacher’s wife. Black magic, murder. - Evil. - Desperate. - Her husband was dying, she’d have done anything to save him. - She was using the binding spell to keep the reaper away from Roy. - Cheating death. Literally. - Yeah, but Roy’s alive, so why’s she still using the spell? - Right. To force the reaper to kill people she thinks are immoral. - May God save us from half the people who think they’re doing God’s work. - We’ve gotta break that binding spell, Dean. - You know, Sue Ann had a Coptic cross like this. And when she dropped it, the reaper backed off. - So, you think we’ve gotta find the cross or destroy the altar? - Maybe both. - Whatever we do, we better do it soon. - Roy’s healing Layla tonight. - That’s Layla’s car. She’s already here. - Yeah. - Dean. - You know, if Roy would have picked Layla instead of me, she’d be healed right now. - Dean, don’t. - And if she’s not healed tonight, she’s gonna die in a couple months. - What’s happening to her is horrible. But, what are you gonna do? Let somebody else die to save her? - You said it yourself, Dean. You can’t play God. - Where’s Sue Ann? - House. - Go find Sue Ann. I’ll catch up. - What are you—? - Hey. - You gonna put that fear of God in me? - You see him? - No. - Psycho mutt. - I gave your brother life, and I can take it away. - Sam, can’t you see? - The Lord chose me to reward the just and punish the wicked. - And your brother is wicked. And he deserves to die just as Layla deserves to live. - It's God’s will. - Goodbye, Sam. - Mrs. Rourke, pray with me. - Pray with me, friends. - Alright, now. - No! - I don’t understand. - I don’t feel different. - My God! What have you done?! - He’s not your God. - Reverend? - Sue Ann? - You okay? - A little bit weak. - Yeah. - Alright, come on, we should get going. - What is it? - Nothing. - What is it? - We did the right thing here, didn’t we? - Of course we did. - Didn’t feel like it. - I got it. - Hey, Layla. Come on in. - Hey. - Hey. - How’d you know we were here? - Sam called. He said you wanted to say goodbye. - I’m gonna grab a soda. - So, um, where are you going? - Don’t know yet. Our work kind of takes us all over. - You know, I went back to see Roy. - What happened? - Nothing. - I mean, he laid his hand on my forehead, but nothing happened. - I’m sorry. - I’m sorry it didn’t work. - And Sue Ann. She’s dead, you know? Stroke. - Yeah, I heard. - I mean, Roy’s a good man. - He doesn’t deserve what’s happened. - It must be rough. - To believe in something so much, and have it disappoint you like that. - You wanna hear something weird? - Hm? - I’m okay. Really. - I guess, if you're gonna have faith, you can’t just have it when the miracles happen. - You have to have it when they don’t. - So, what now? - God works in mysterious ways. - Goodbye, Dean. - Hey. - Uh, you know, I’m not
