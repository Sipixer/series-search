Easy marks over there. No big. Wasn't a total loss. I don't know what it is you think i did to your wife or girlfriend, mother or sister, but, i just want you to know, my feelings were real. That ain't my problem, man-witch. You owe my friend some years. That's what this is. I'm sorry. He lost. Them's the breaks. Then un-lose him. Go ahead and shoot me if it makes you feel better. Besides, i could use a good... tickle. You want years? Great. - Play me for 'em. - Fine. Dean, no! They're my years. I can do what i want. Lozenge? What? It's barely linty. Okay, suit yourself.

Shuffle up and deal. This is gonna be fun. You find anything? You might say. Who the hell are you?! Dude, relax. It's me. Hi. What the hell happened? You know... found the game. I thought you said you were good at poker. I am. Shut up. You were just gonna shoot some old guy? Is that it? I didn't know what you were. I mean, h-have you seen you? You look like... the old chick in "titanic." I know. Shut up. I was gonna say "emperor palpatine." I see you met john mccain there. Either of you want to tell me what happened? Bobby's an idiot. That's what happened. Nobody asked you to play. Right. I should have just let you die. And for damn sure, nobody asked you to lose! - It's like "grumpy old men." - Shut up, sam! What the hell were you thinking? He's a witch. He's been playing poker since guys wore tights. - You just don't get it. - Yeah, i get it, bobby. You saw a chance to turn the hands of the clock back and get out of that damn chair. Pretty tempting. - i can imagine. - No, you can't. You got me. I never been paralyzed. But i tell you something, i've been to hell, and there's an archangel there wanting me to drop the soap. Look at me! My junk's rustier than yours! - you hear me bellyaching? - Actually, yeah. I'm having a heart attack. No, you're not. - What is it? - Acid reflux. Guys your age can't digest certain foods. You're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger. You want to keep emoting or you want to talk about solving this little issue of yours? It's got to be about the chips. I slid 'em across, patrick did his little witchy number, and you prettied up in a hurry. What are you all thinking? Some kind of magic chips or something? Definitely. - You remember what he chanted? - Every word. All right, then let's find out where he stashes his chips. And steal me 50. Benjamin button me back into burger shape. What do you think? I think you ought to put some clothes on. Ready for housekeeping, sir? Born ready. You're just like my grandfather. He hits on anything that moves, too. You're adorable. And dangerous. Can we just go? I got to say, i kind of like the guy. I'm out. Dime-store model. Piece of cake. It's like "mission: pathetic." Watch out. I could have done that. What are you doing? Aren't you the chick from the bar? I'm a lot more than that. It's all right, sweetheart. They're harmless. You boys want chips? Take 'em. They're just chips, einsteins. It's showmanship. This may come as a shock, but the magic does not lie in a pile of crappy plywood or in any phony abracadabra. It's in the 900-year-old witch. You boys want years? Score 'em the old-fashioned way. Texas hold 'em. Fine. Let's do it. What card am I holding up? That's what I thought. If your eyesight's that bad, what about your memory? I'm not a murderer. You, on the other hand... No, Sam. Dean... What, Sam not much of a player? Happy trails, Dean. Enjoy the twilight of your life. Should have taken better care of that ticker, though. You're free to go. Oh, but, Sam... Your brother's situation. That's punishment enough, but I can't let you leave Without a small parting gift. What are you doing? You'll find out soon enough. Let's get out of here, Sam. Dude... I believe that he-witch gave you the clap. Little help here? You know, I still think I should play. You're not good enough. I'm better. Bobby's way better. We both lost. Exactly. So, what? So I don't get a say in this anymore? When you get to be our age... You're 30, Dean! I've watched you hustle plenty of poker. Knowing the game is not enough. It's not about playing the cards. It's about playing the other guy. I know that. Hooray for you. All i'm saying is, I played this guy. I know his style. I can take him. No, Bobby. You don't have enough years in the bank. I got enough. - No, you'll die if you lose. - So what if I do? What exactly am I living for? The damn apocalypse? Watching men die bloody while I sit in this chair, can't take a step to help'em? No. It's the facts. I'm old... And broke down... and I can't... I ain't a hunter no more. I'm useless. And if I wasn't such a coward, I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth day I got home from the hospital. Bobby, you are not playing again. I'm not... letting you do that. There's another way out of this. There's got to be. And i'm gonna find it. Take it. It'll help you. What is this? The most powerful reversal spell you've ever laid your eyes on. - And it reverses what? - Patrick's work, all of it. You saying I could be normal again? You and everyone else he's ever played. Who's still alive. Why the hell should we trust you? Trust me, don't trust me. I don't care. The spell is real. If it zaps everyone, don't that include your man? And me, too. I look good for my age. Lady, this don't add up for squat. - Why would you want that? - I have my reasons. Do it quick. We leave town tomorrow. Bet. I sense you've got me by the jewels on this one, hesh. I fold. What are you up... like 13 years there, hesh? What do you say we call it a day? Thanks, Patrick. Hesh here is gonna live to see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah. Isn't that right, hesh? - Thanks again, Patrick. - Shalom, my friend. That was nice of you. I'm a nice guy. What can I do you for? Deal. Jawbone of a murderer. Great. You know, this really sucks. How do we even know her spell's gonna work? We don't. But we ain't got a plan "b." Now, less flappin' and more diggin'. Oh, god! My elbows! I'm all creaky. Hurry up, you crybaby. Pound it up your ass, ironsides. One little grave. Then you do it. Fine. I'll hop right in. Well, least your legs are numb. Shut up and dig, grandma. Now it's my back! Can you straighten up? Yeah, but a little sympathy wouldn't hurt. Butt cheek tingling? That's kind of personal. So "yeah"? It's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging. You know, Bobby... Killing you is officially on my bucket list. I like you, Sam. I do. You're smart, and your heart's clearly in the right place. I can tell a lot about a guy by looking. - You mean you're psychic. - No. That'd be cheating. I'm talking about good old-fashioned intuition. Right. Let's just play. We are playing. Does your big brother know you're here? Bet five. Didn't think so. I raise. Here you are, right... trying to clean up their mess, And they still want to sit you at the kiddie table. You're not the little brother anymore, Sam. Then again... ... maybe you are. You're in over your head here, Sam. You can keep making these moves... You know... Playing it cautious, playing the percentages. But i'm still gonna kick your ass into the nursing home. Does this armchair-psychology routine usually work for you? You tell me. You're the one who's losing. Little break? How's it going in there? How do you think it's going? What about you? You have everything you need? We still need a little he-witch DNA. He was chewing it. Hurry up. Please. All right. Just keep him busy. And, Sammy... Don't lose. Gairmidh mi air maponus, dia na hogalachd. Gairmidh mi air sucellus, dia na time. Till an-drasda obair uile gu bheilair a bhith deanta. Mar sin bitheadh. Drop it in. How do I look? Question... Is this what you meant to give your big brother? The one you gave him never passed my lips. Won't do a scrap of good. I don't like cheating, Sam. Stop it! Patrick, let him go! - He tried to kill us! - I did it, I gave him the spell! What? Why... - Why would you do that? - You know why. You know. Keep... playing. Everything we put in that spell was kosher. Everything except the damn toothpick. You got to go get a speck of DNA. Strap on your track shoes. Oh, goody. More stairs. It's too damn clean in here. First witch I ever heard of didn't spew bodily fluids all over the place. Toothbrush, comb... anything. Look at you... The percentage player betting the farm. Awful transparent of you, Sam. If I had a monster hand like you have, I'd trap you. But you get so excited, you bet yourself right out of a big pot. I fold. Set of ladies, I'm guessing. Nice bluff. If we had time, I could make a real player out of you. I got time. Maybe. But I can't say the same for Dean. Your brother's gonna be dead soon. And when I say "soon"... I mean minutes. The game's not over still I say it is. Blinds. So, when it's about your brother, You get so emotional, your brain just flies right out the window. - Good to know. - Go to hell. I'm all-in. - Don't do that, Sam. - I can't leave until it's over? Fine. It's over. Now, where's my brother? There's poker and then there's suicide. Just play the hand. Dean? Dean, you there? Fine. Dean?! I'm sorry, kid. Aces full. You're crying. For a witch, you're so nice, it's actually kind of creepy. It's okay. It was a great hand. Just... ... not as great... ... as four 4s. Well played. You know, that whole... Going-out-of-your-head bit... Very method. Well, there's more to you than meets the eye. Cash these in for Dean, please. With pleasure. Dean, you hear me? Damn it, Dean! Idjit. I can't do this. - Yes, you can. - Don't make me. I don't want to win. I buried my daughter. And she looked like this. It's not natural. You knew... When you decided to come with me. This is what you wanted. You're still young. You're so beautiful. - You have me. - I miss my family. I'm sorry, Patrick. - I thought you loved me. - I do. Sweetheart, of course I do. I thought I was cut out for this, But i'm not. I don't think I can do this without you. You got on okay for a long time before you met me. Check. All-in. All-in. Thank you. No tricks... you actually beat the guy? How the hell? Just lucky. - I'll see y'all guys later. - Where you going? Nowhere. - A booster shot. - Don't say it. I guess, we can get the van loaded. I shouldn't have called you an idiot. Which time? I'm sorry. I mean, I actually... I get it. Getting old ain't a bachelor party. And dealing with the crap you got to deal with... - Don't you go on pity patrol. - I'm not. I'm not. I'm just... I'm saying, you know, if I was in your shoes... You'd never stop complaining. Fair enough. You're not useless, Bobby. Good talk. No, wait a minute. Listen to me. You don't stop being a soldier 'cause you got wounded in battle. No matter what shape you're in, bottom line is, you're family. I don't know if you've noticed, but me and Sam, we don't have much left. I can't do this without you. I can't. So don't you dare think about checking out. I don't want to hear that again. Good. Thanks. Now, we done feeling our feelings? 'cause i'd like to get out of this room before we both start growing lady parts.
