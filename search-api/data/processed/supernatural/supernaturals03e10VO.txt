I've been busting my ass trying to keep you alive, Dean, And you act like you couldn't care less. I don't want you to worry about me, Dean.</I> I want you to worry about you.</I> I want you to give a crap that you're dying. Every damn demon, they were all human once? Every one I've ever met. The answer is yes, by the way -- The same thing will happen to you. There's no way of saving me from the pit, is there? No. www.1000fr.com Presents Capture:Evelyn¡«zx Sync:Óêäì@FRS</font> Oh. I'm sorry. Sir? Wake up. Wake up! You hear me? Wake up! Sir, wake up! Help! I need some help in here! Supernatural S03E10 * down around the corner * half a mile from here * you see them long trains runnin' * * and you watch them disappear There you are. What are you doing? Having a drink. It's 2:00 in the afternoon. Drinking whiskey? - I drink whiskey all the time. - No, you don't. What's the big deal? You get sloppy in bars. You hit on chicks all the time. Why can't I?</I> It's kind of slim pickings around here. What's going on with you? * she lost her home and her family * * and she won't be coming back * without love I tried, Dean. To do what? To save you. Can I get a whiskey? Double, neat. - I'm serious, Dean. - No, you're drunk. I mean, where you're going... what you're gonna become. I can't stop it. I'm starting to think maybe even ruby can't stop it. But, really, the thing is, no one can save you. - What I've been telling you. - No, that's not what I mean. I mean, no one can save you because you don't want to be saved. I mean, how can you care so little about yourself? What's wrong with you? Hello? Yes, this is mr. Snyderson. What? Where? So, what's the diagnosis? We've tested everything we can think to test. He seems perfectly healthy. Except that he's comatose. Mr. Snyderson, you're his emergency contact. Anything we should know? Any illnesses? No, he never gets sick. I mean, he doesn't even catch a cold. Doctor, is there anything you can do? Look, I'm sorry, But we don't know what's causing it, So we don't know how to treat it. He just... went to sleep and didn't wake up. So, what was Bobby doing in pittsburgh? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? "Silene capensis," Which, of course, means absolutely nothing to me.</I> ?? Dr. Walter gregg, 64, university neurologist. How'd he bite it? Um, actually, they don't know. They say he just went to sleep and didn't wake up. That sound familiar to you? All right, um... so, let's say Bobby was looking into the doc's death, - You know,hunting after something... - that started hunting him. Yeah. All right, stay here. See if you can make heads or tails of this. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna look into the good doctor myself. So, you're dr. Gregg's lab assistant. That's right. Well, his death must have come as a shock to you. Yeah, it did. But, still, go in your sleep, peaceful -- It's what you wish for, right? Yeah, right. Dr. Gregg, uh, studied sleeping disorders? Dreams? I don't understand. I went over all of this with the other detective. You already spoke to another detective? Yes, a very nice older man with a beard. Well, I'd love to hear it again, if you don't mind. Thing is, I'm sort of busy. Maybe we could do this later? Sure. Yeah. I'll just bring you down to the station later this afternoon And get your statement on tape, do it all official-Like. Look, okay, I didn't know about dr. Gregg's experiments -- Not until I was cleaning out his files. His experiments -- The ones he was conducting on sleeping? No one knew, okay? Not the university, not anybody. I already spoke with a lawyer, And he told me that I can't be held liable for anything. T1maybe you couldn't, But that was before the new evidence came to light. - New evidence? - Mm-Hmm. What n evidence? I'm not at liberty to say. Look, I'm just a grad student. This was a gig to cover tuition. Maybe so, but, still, this -- This -- This could go on your permanent record. Unless you hand over the doctor's research to me -- All of it. Look, I don't know what the r.A. Said, But, uh, I was growing ferns. Take it easy, phish. That's not why I'm here. Really? Oh, thank god. Okay. I want to talk to you about dr. Gregg's sleep study. Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right? You were one of his test subjects, right? Yeah. Ss you're on duty or whatever. I guess I can make an exception. Now, dr. Gregg was testing treatments For a charcot-Wilbrand syndrome, Which means... um, I, uh, I can't dream. I had this bike accident when I was a kid, And I banged my head pretty good, And I haven't had a dream since. Till the study... uh, sort of. What'd the doc give you? It's this yellow tea. It smelled awful -- Tasted worse. What did it do? Just passed right out. And I had the most vivid, super-Intense dream. Like a bad acid trip, you know? Totally. I mean, no. That was it. I dropped out of his study right after that. I didn't...like it. To tell you the truth... it kind of scared me. How is he? No change. What you got? Well, considering what you told me about the doc's experiments, Bobby's wall is starting to make a hell of a lot more sense. How so? This plant, silene capensis, Also known as african dream root, It's been used by shamen and medicine men for centuries. Let me guess -- They dose up, bust out the didgeridoos, And start kicking around the hacky. Not quite. If you believe the legends, it's used for dream-Walking. I mean, entering another person's dreams, Poking around in their heads. - I take it we believe the legends. - When don't we? But dream-Walking is just the tip of the iceberg. - What do you mean? - I mean, this dream root is some serious mojo. You take enough of it, with enough practice, You can become a regular freddy krueger. You can control anything. You could turn bad dreams good. You could turn good dreams bad. And killing people in their sleep. For example. So, let's say this doc Was testing the stuff on his patients tim leary-Style. Somebody gets pissed at him, Decides to give him a little dream visit, He goes nighty-Night. But what about Bobby? I mean, if the killer came after him, How come he's still alive? I don't know. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me!! So, how do we find our homicidal little sandman? It could be anyone. - Yeah? - Yeah. Anyone who knew the doctor, had access to his dream shrooms. Maybe one of his test subjects or something? Possible, but his research is pretty sketchy. I mean, we don't know how many subjects he had or who all of them were. What? In any other case,we'd be calling Bobby And asking him for help right now. Know what? You're right. - What? - Let's go talk to him. Sure. I think we might find the conversation a bit one-Sided. Not if we're tripping on some dream root. - What? - You heard me. You want to go dream-Walking inside Bobby's head? Yeah, why not? Maybe we could help. We have no idea what's crawling around in there. - How bad could it be? - Bad. Dude, it's Bobby. Yeah, you're right. One problem, though.We're fresh out of african dream root. Unless you know someone who can score some... - Crap. - What? Bela. Bela? Crap. You're actually suggesting we ask her for a favor? I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah. Hey, Sam. Bela. I didn't think there was a chance in hell you'd show up. Well, I'm full of surprises. Though, truthfully, you want to know why I'm here? Okay. Because of you. Uh, what are you doing? I can't stop thinking about you. What? Are you sure? Sam. Sam. Sam. Oh. Sam, wake up! Dude, you were out. And making some serious happy noises. Who were you dreaming about? - What? - No one. Nothing. Come on. You can tell me. Angelina jolie? No. - Brad pitt? - No! No. Dude, it doesn't matter. - Whatever. - Whatever. I called Bela. Bela? Yeah? W-What'd she, you know, say? She's...gonna...help us? Shockingly, no, which puts us back to square one. I've been trying to decipher the doctor's notes. Unfortunately, he has worse handwriting than you do.</I> You gonna come help me with this stuff? Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec. Bela, as I live and breathe. You called me, remember? I remember you turning me down. Well, I'm just full of surprises. Hey, Bela. What's going on? I brought you your african dream root. Nasty stuff. And not easy to come by. Why the sudden change of heart? What, I can't do you a little favor every now and again? No, you're not. Now, come on. I want to know what the strings are before you attach 'em. You said this was for Bobby singer, right? Well, I'm doing it for him, not you.</I> Bobby? Why? He saved my life once... in flagstaff. I screwed up, and he saved me, okay? Are you satisfied? Maybe. So, when do we go on this little magical mystery tour? Oh, you're not going anywhere.</I> I don't trust you enough to let you in my car,</I> Much less Bobby's head. No offense. None taken. It's 2:00 a.M. Where am I supposed to go? Get a room. Oh, they got the magic fingers, A little "casa erotica" on pay-Per-View. You'll love it. You... nice to -- S-Seeing you... ...Bela. Well, shall we dim t lights And sync up "wizard of oz" and "dark side of the moon"? Why? What did you do during college? Wait, wait, wait. Whew. Can't forget this. Here. What the hell is that? Bobby's hair. We have to drink Bobby's hair? That's how you control whose dream you're entering. You got to drink some of their, uh... some of their body. Well, guess the hair of the dog's Better than other parts of the body.</I> - Bottoms up. - Yeah. Feel anything? No. You feel anything? No. Maybe we got some bad schwag. Hey, when did it start raining? When did it start raining upside down?</I> Okay, I don't know what's weirder -- The fact that we're in Bobby's head Or that he's dreaming of better homes and gardens.</I> Wait. Wait a second. Imagine the place without the paint job, More cluttered, dusty, books all over the place. It's Bobby's house. Yeah. Bobby? Bobby? Dean. I'm gonna go look outside. No, no, no. Stay close. Dude, I'll be fine. Just look around in here. Look, we got to find him. Don't do anything stupid. Dean! Dean! Bobby? Bobby?! Who's out there? Bobby, you in there? Dean? Yeah, it's me. Open up. Hey. How the hell did you find me? Sam and I got our hands on some of that dream-Root stuff. Drearoot? What? Dr. Gregg -- The experiments? What the hell are you talking about? Hurry. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.What's going on? - She's coming. Okay, you know this is a dream, don't you? W-Whate you crazy? It's a dream, Bobby. None of this is real. Does that look made up? No. Bobby, who is that? She's... she's my wife. Why, Bobby? Why did you do this to me? I'd have rather died myself than hurt you. But you did hurt me. You shoved that knife into me... again and again. You watched me bleed... watched me die. Bobby, she's not real. How could you? You were possessed, baby. You were rabid. And I didn't know what I know now. I didn't know how to save you. You're lying. You wanted me dead.</I> If you'd loved me, you would have found a way!! - I'm sorry. - Come on. - Who are you? - Who are you? You don't belong here. You're one to talk. You're in my friend's head. Well, you got a poor choice in friends. This is self-Defense. He came after me. H-He wanted to hurt me. That may be because you're a killer. You should be nicer to me. In here, you're just an insect. I'm a god. I'm telling you -- All of it, your house, your wife -- It's a nightmare. I killed her. Boby This is a dream and you can wake up. Hell, you can do anything.</I> Just leave me alone. Let her kill me already. Look at me. Look at me. You got to snap out of this now. You got to snap out of this now! You're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let you die. I'm not gonna let nnu die. You're like a father to me. You've got to believe me.Please! I'm dreaming? Yes! Now, take control of it! I don't believe it. Believe it. Now, would you please wake up? Sweet dreams. Hey, Bobby... that, uh, that stuff -- All that stuff with your wife... ...that actually happen? Everybody got into hunting somehow.</I> I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. If it weren't for you, I'd still be lost in there... or dead. Thank you. So, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm. My guess is he's long gone by now. He ain't much of a stoner. - No? - No. His name's jeremy frost -- Full-On genius -- 160 I.Q. Which is saying something, Considering his dad took a baseball bat to his head. Here's father of the year. He died before jeremy was 10. Looks like a real sweetheart. Injury gave him charcot-Wilbrand. He hasn't dreamt since. Till he started dosing the dream drug. Yep. yep. How did he know how to dig up your worst nightmare and throw it at you? Hey, he was rooting around in my skull. God knows what he saw in there. Yeah, how'd he get in there in the first place? Isn't he supposed to have some of your hair, your dna, or something? - Yeah. - Yeah. Before I knew it was him, he offered me a beer. I drank it. Dumbest friggin' thing. Oh, I don't know. It wasn't that dumb. Dean, you didn't. I was thirsty. That's great. Now he can come after either one of you. Well, now we just have to find him first.</I> We better work fast... and coffee up. 'Cause the one thing we cannot do is fall asleep.</I> Two days later. I mean, this jeremy guy's not a friggin' ghost. Where the hell could he be? Dean, you sure you don't want me to drive? You -- You seem a little...caffeinated. Well, thanks for the news flash, edison! Jeez. Tell me you got something! - The strip club was a bust, huh? - Yeah. That was our last lead. What the hell, Bobby?! Don't yell at me, boy. - I'm working my ass off here. - Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just -- I'm -- I'm tired. Well, who ain't? What's Bela got? What do you got, Bela? Sorry. Sometimes the spirit world's in a chatty mood, And sometimes it isn't. - She's got nothing. - Great! Well, I'm just gonna go blow my brains out now! ?? Let me ask you something. What are you doing helping us? Bobby, I'm surprised you don't remember. Flagstaff? Oh. Yeah. Right. Flagstaff. All right, that's it. I'm done. What are you doing? Taking myself a long-Overdue nap. What? Dean, jeremy can come after you. That's the idea. Excuse me? Co on, man. We can't find him, so let him come to me.</I> On his own turf -- Where he's basically a god? I can handle it. Not alone you can't. Ow! What are you doing? Coming in with you. - No, you're not. - Why not? At least then, it'll be two against one. 'Cause I don't want you digging around in my head. Too bad. Dean. For the love of god. What are we still doing here? I have no idea. There's someone out there. * stars shining bright above you * * night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" * Hey. You gonna sit down? Come on. We only have an hour Before we have to pick ben up from baseball. * say nighty-Night and kiss me I've never had this dream before. * just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me * Stop looking at me like that. Sorry. Dean. I love you. Where'd she go? Dean. Okay. Dean? Jeremy? Hey, Dean. Well, aren't you a handsome son of a gun. We need to talk. I get it. I get it. I'm my own worst nightmare. That it? Huh? Like the "superman iii" junkyard scene -- A little mano y mano with myself? Joke all you want, smartass. But you can't lie to me. I know the truth. I know how dead you are inside... how worthless you feel. I know how you look into a mirror... and hate what you see. Sorry, pal. It's not gonna work. You're not real. Sure I am. I'm you. I don't think so. 'Cause, see, this is my siesta...</I> not yours. All I got to do is snap my fingers, and you go bye-Bye. I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you. Like I said... we need to talk. Dean. Hey. Wake up. Boy, you just don't know When to leave well enough alone, do you? You're a psycho. - You're wrong. - Yeah? Tell that to dr. Gregg. The doc? No, no, the doc's the one who got me hooked on this stuff, And then he took it away. But I needed it, And he wouldn't let me have it. So you killed him. I can dream again. You know what that's like -- Not to be able to dream? Y-You never rest -- Not really. I-It's like being awake for 15 years. And let me guess -- That makes you go crazy. I just want to be left alone. I just want to dream. Sorry. Can't do that. That's the wrong answer. I'm getting better and better at this -- Stronger and stronger all the time. But you and your brother... you're not waking up... not this time. I'm not gonna let you. I mean, you're going to hell, And you won't lift a finger to stop it. Talk about low self-Esteem. Then, again, I guess it's not much of a life worth saving, now, is it? Come on, Dean. Come on. Wake up. ?? You are nothing. You're as mindless and obedient as an attack dog. - That's not true. - No? What are the things that you want? What are the things that you dream? I mean, your car -- That's dad's. Your favorite leather jacket -- Dad's. Your music -- Dad's. Do you even have an original thought?</I> No. No, all there is is "watch out for Sammy. Look after your little brother, boy." You can still hear your dad's voice in your head, can't you? Clear as a bell. Just shut up. I mean, think about it. All he ever d was train you... boss you around. But Sam... Sam, he doted on. Sam, he loved. I mean it. I'm getting angry. Dad knew who you really were -- A good soldier and nothing else. Daddy's blunt little instrument. Your own father didn't care whether you lived or died. - Why should you? - You son of a bitch! My father was an obsessed bastard! All that crap he dumped on me about protecting Sam -- That was his crap! He's thalone who couldn protect his family!</I> He's the one who let mom die! Who wasn't there for Sam! I always was!</I> It wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me! And I don't deserve to go to hell! You can't escape me, Dean. You're gonna die. And this -- This is what you're gonna become.</I> You can't stop me. There's nothing I can't do in here. Because of the dream root. That's right. Yeah? Well, you're forgetting something. What's tha I took the dream root, too. Jeremy?! Jeremy! No. No. Dad? You answer me when I'm talking to you, boy! You did a little dream-Weaving of your own in there, huh? Yeah, uh, I just sort of concentrated, And it happened, you know? Didn't have anything to do with... you know, your psychic stuff? No. I mean, I don't think so. Good. Good. Hey, you guys seen Bela? She's not in her room. She's not answering her phone. She must have taken off or something. Just like that? That's a little weird. Well, if you ask me what's weird, it's why she helped us in the first place. I thought you saved her life. What the hell are you talking about? The thing flagstaff. That thing in flagstaff was an amulet. I gave her a good deal. That's all. Well, then, why did -- You boys better check your pockets. ?? No, no, no, no, no, no. The colt. Bela stole the colt. Damn it, boys! Pack your crap. Why? Where are we going? We're gonna go hunt the bitch down. Hey, Sam, I was wondering -- When you were in my head, what did you see? Uh, just jeremy. He kept me separated from you. Easier to beat my brains out that way, I guess. What about you? You never said. Nothing. I was looking for you the whole time.</I> Sam... yeah? I've been doing some thinking. And... well, the thing is... ...I don't want to die. I don't want to go to hell. All right, yeah. We'll find a way to save you. Okay, good. You n't escape me, Dean. You're gonna die.
