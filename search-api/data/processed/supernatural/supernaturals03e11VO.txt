Somebody need a friend? So, the police report says dexter hasselback Is a professor, but that's not all he is. What is he? I talked to his daughter. The guy's quite the journalist. Columns in magazines, a blog. He writes about tourist attractions -- Mystery spots, ufo crash sites. He gets his kicks debunking them. I mean, he's already put four of these places out of business. Here. Truth warrior"? More like a pompous schmuck, you ask me. Yeah. Tell me about it. I mean, i've read everything the guy's ever written. He must have weighed a ton, he was so full of himself. When did you have time to do all this research? Come on. What? It's funny, you know. I mean, this guy spends his whole life Crapping on mystery spots and then he vanishes in one.

Your kind loves that, don't they? Yeah, sure. Okay. Just put the stake down. - Sam, maybe you should... - No! There's only one creature powerful enough To do what you're doing -- Making reality out of nothing, Sticking people in time loops. In fact, you'd pretty much have to be a god.

We've killed one of your kind before! Actually, bucko, you didn't. You're joking, right? You chuckleheads tried to kill me last time. Why wouldn't i do this? And hasselback -- What about him? That putz? He said he didn't believe in wormholes, So i dropped him in one. Then you guys showed up. I made you the second you hit town. So this is fun for you? Killing dean over and over again? One... yes, it is fun, And two... this is so not about killing dean. This joke is on you, sam. Watching your brother die every day. Forever. You son of a bitch. How long will it take you to realize You can't save your brother... ...no matter what? Oh, yeah? I kill you, this all ends now. Oh, hey! Whoa. Okay. Okay. Look. I was just playing around. You can't take a joke, fine. You're out of it. Tomorrow, you wake up, it'll be wednesday. I swear. You're lying. If i am, you know where to find me -- Having pancakes at the diner. No. Easier to just kill you. Sorry, kiddo. Can't have that. - What, are you gonna sleep all day? - No asia. Yeah, i know. This station sucks. It's wednesday! Yeah, which usually comes after tuesday. Turn that thing off, would you? What, are you kidding? - This isn't the most beautiful song you've ever heard? - No. Jeez. How many tuesdays did you have? I don't know. I lost count. Hey, wait. What do you remember? I remember you were pretty whacked out of it yesterday, Then i remember running into the trickster. But, no, that's about it. All right. Pack your stuff. Let's get the hell out of town -- Now. No breakfast? No breakfast. Are you sure we should just let the trickster go? Give me your wallet. Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Just relax. I am relaxed! Okay. All right. Nobody wants this to end the wrong way. Let's talk about it a sec. Dean! No. No, no, no, no.No no Hey. Hey. Come on. Not today. Not today. This isn't supposed to happen today. Come on. I'm supposed to wake up. This is sam. Leave a message. Sam, it's bobby. Heard about that demon thing You took care of in death valley. Nice job. It's been about three months we talked, though. It'd be nice to hear your voice. Give a call. I'm here. Sam? Bobby again. Look, i'm worried about you. Just tell me you're not sitting alone somewhere, Obsessing over this damn trickster. Call me, sam. We can find it together. No one man should take something like this on alone. You hear me? By the way, that vampire nest in austin... Hell of a job. Sam? It's bobby. I found him. It's good to see you, boy. What are we doing here, bobby? This is the last place, for sure, The trickster worked his magic. So? So, you want this thing? I found a summoning ritual to bring the trickster here. What do we need? Blood. How much blood? Ritual says near a gallon. It's got to be fresh, too. Meaning we have to bleed a person dry. And it's got to be tonight, Or not for another 50 years. Then let's go get some. You break my heart, kid. What? I'm not gonna let you murder an innocent man. Then why'd you bring me here? Why? Cause it was the only way you'd see me. Cause i'm trying to knock some sense into you. Because i thought you'd back down from killing a man. Well, you thought wrong. Leave the stuff. I'll do it myself. I told you, i'm not gonna let you kill anyone. It's none of your damn business what i do! You want your brother back so bad... ...fine. What are you talking about? Better me than a civilian. You're crazy, bobby. I'm not killing you. Oh. Now i'm the crazy one. Look, sam. I'm old. I'm coming near the end of my trail. But you can keep fighting, saving folk. But you need your brother. So let me give him back to you. Bobby... You and dean, you... You boys are the closest thing i have to family. I want to do this. Okay. Good. Just make it quick. Do it, son. Yeah, okay, bobby. But you want to know why? Because you're not bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby! You're right. I was just screwing with you. Pretty good, though, sam. Smart. Let me tell ya. Whoever said dean was the dysfunctional one Has never seen you with a sharp object in your hands. Holy "full metal jacket." Bring him back. Who? Dean? Didn't my girl send you the flowers? Dean's dead. He ain't coming back. His soul's downstairs doing the hellfire rumba as we speak. Just take us back to that tuesday -- Or wednesday When it all started, please. We won't come after you. I swear. You swear? Yes. I don't know. Even if i could... - You can. - True. But that don't mean i should. Sam, there's a lesson here That i've been trying to drill Into that freakish, cro-Magnon skull of yours. Lesson? What lesson? This obsession to save dean. The way you two keep sacrificing yourselves for each other. Nothing good comes out of it. Just blood and pain. Dean's your weakness. The bad guys know it, too. He's gonna be the death of you, sam. Sometimes you just got to let people go. He's my brother. Yep. And like it or not, This is what life's gonna be like without him. Please. Just... Please. I swear, it's like talking to a brick wall. Okay, look. This all stopped being fun months ago. You're travis bickel in a skirt, pal. I'm over it. Meaning what? Meaning that's for me to know and you to find out. What, are you gonna sleep all day? I know. No asia. This station sucks. It's wednesday. Yeah. Which usually follows tuesday. Turn that thing off. Dude, how many tuesdays did you have? Enough. Wait. What do you remember? I remember you were pretty whacked out yesterday. I remember catching up with the trickster. That's about it. Let's go. No breakfast? No breakfast. All right. I'll pack the car. Wait. You're not going anywhere alone. It's the parking lot, sam. Just... Just trust me.
