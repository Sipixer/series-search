- There's something in my closet. See? There's nothing there. - You're sure? - I'm sure. Now, come on. Into bed. I don't like this house. You're just not used to it yet. But you and your brother and me, we are going to be very happy here. I promise. I love you. The chair. Okay. Right. The chair. Just to be safe. Please, god, don't let it be rats. Terrific. All right. I've been cruising some websites. Think I found a few candidates for our next gig. A fishing trawler found off the coast of Cali. Its crew vanished. And we got some cattle mutilations in west Texas. Hey! Am I boring you with this hunting-evil stuff? No, I'm listening. Keep going. And here a Sacramento man shot himself in the head... three times. Any of these things blowing up your skirt, pal? - Wait, I've seen this. - Seen what? What are you doing? Dean, I know where we have to go next. Where? Back home. Back to Kansas. Okay, random. Where'd that come from? All right, um... this photo was taken in front of our old house, right? The house where mom died? Yeah. It didn't burn down right? I mean not completely, they rebuilt it, right? I guess so, yeah. What the hell are you talking about? Okay, look, this is gonna sound crazy, but the people who live in our old house, I think they might be in danger. - Why would you think that? - Uh... just, um... look, just... You got to trust me on this, okay? - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Trust you? - Yeah. You got to give me a little bit more than that. I can't really explain, it is all. Well, tough. I'm not going anywhere until you do. I have these nightmares. I've noticed. And sometimes they come true. Come again? Look, Dean... I dreamt about Jessica's death for days before it happened. Sane people have weird dreams, man. I'm sure it's just a coincidence. No, I dreamt about the blood dripping, her on the ceiling, the fire, everything, and I didn't do anything 'cause I didn't believe it. Now I'm dreaming about that tree, about our house, and some woman inside screaming for help. I mean, that's where it all started, man. This has to mean something, right? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know, Dean? This... This woman might be in danger. - This might be the thing that killed mom and Jessica. - All right, just slow down,would you? I mean, first you're telling me that you've got this Shining... ...and then you tell me that I've got to go back home, especially when... When what? When I swore to myself that I would never go back there. Dean, we have to check this out. Just to make sure. I know we do. You gonna be all right, man? Let me get back to you on that. Yes? Sorry to bother you, ma'am, - but we're with the federal... - I'm Sam Winchester and this is my brother, Dean. Um...we used to live here. You know, we were just driving by, and we were wondering if we could come see the old place. Winchester... That is so funny. You know, I, I think I found some of your photos the other night. You did? Okay. Come on in. Juice, juice, juice! Juice, juice,  juice! That's Richie. He's kind of a juice junkie. But, hey, at least he won't get scurvy. Sari, this is Sam and Dean. - They used to live here. - Hi. Hey, Sari. So, you just moved in? Uh, yeah, from Wichita. You got family here? No, I just, uh... um, needed a fresh start. That's all. So new town, new job I mean, as soon as I find one, new house. So, how you liking it so far? Well, uh, all due respect to your childhood home, I mean, I'm sure you have lots of happy memories here, but this place has its issues. What do you mean? Well, it's just getting old like, the wiring, you know? We've got flickering lights almost hourly. Oh, that's too bad. What else? Um...sink's backed up. There's rats in the basement. I'm sorry. - I don't mean to complain. - No. Have you seen the rats or have you just heard scratching? - Just the scratching, actually. - Mom? Ask them if it was here when they lived here. What, Sari? The thing in my closet. Oh, no, baby, there was nothing in their closets. Right? Right, no.No, of course not. She had a nightmare the other night. I wasn't dreaming. It came into my bedroom, and it was on fire. You heard that ? A figure on fire. - And that woman Jenny, that was the woman in your dreams? - Yeah. And you hear what she was talking about ? scratching, flickering lights ? - Both signs of a malevolent spirit. - Yeah well. I'm just freaked out your weirdo visions are coming true. Forget about that for a minute. - The thing in the house, do you think it's the thing that killed mom and Jessica? - I don't know! Has it come back or has it been there the whole time? Maybe it's something else entirely. Sam, we don't know yet. Those people are in danger, Dean. - We have to get them out of that house. - And we will. - No, I mean now. - And how you're gonna do that ? - You got a story she's gonna believe? - Then what are we supposed to do?! We just got to chill out, that's all. If this was any other kind of job, what would we do? We'd try to figure out what we were dealing with. - We'd dig into the history of the house. - Exactly. Except this time we already know what happened. Yeah, but how much do we know? How much do you actually remember? - About that night, you mean? - Yeah. Not much. I remember the fire... the heat. Then I carried you out the front door. You did? Yeah, well, you never knew that? No. And, uh... well, you know dad's story as well as I do. Mom was... was on the ceiling. Whatever put her there was long gone by the time dad found her. And he never had a theory about what did it? If he did, he kept it to himself. God knows we asked him enough times. Okay. So, if we're gonna figure out what's going on now, we have to figure out what happened back then, and see if it's the same thing. Yeah. Talk to dad's friends, neighbors, people who were there at the time. Does this feel like just another job to you? I'll be right back. I got to go to the bathroom. This is John Winchester. If this is an emergency, call my son Dean, 866 907 32 35. Dad... I know I've left you messages before. I don't even know if you get 'em. But I'm with Sam and we're in Lawrence, and there's something in our old house. I don't know if it's the thing that killed mom or not, but... I don't know what to do. So, whatever you're doing, if you could get here... please. I need your help, dad. No, sir, nothing weird down there. I promise. - Sink just backed upon its own. - I'll take a look. Thanks. Oh, okay, I'll get out of your way. So you and John Winchester, you used to own this garage together? Yeah, we used to. A long time ago. Matter of fact, must be 20 years since John disappeared. So, why are the cops interested all of a sudden? Oh, we're reopening some of our unsolved cases, and the Winchester disappearance is one of them. Uh-huh. Well, what do you want to know about John? Whatever you remember, you know. Whatever sticks out in your mind. He was a stubborn bastard. I remember that. And, uh... oh, whatever the game, he hated to lose, you know? It was that whole marine thing. But, uh... well, he sure loved Mary, and he doted on those kids. But that was before the fire. That's right. He ever talk about that night? No, not at first. - I think he was in shock. - Right, but eventually, what did he say about it? Oh, he wasn't thinking straight. He said, uh... he said something caused that fire and killed Mary. He ever say what did it? Nothing did it. It was an accident. An electrical short in the ceiling or walls or something. - I begged him to get some help, but... - But what? Oh, it just got worse and worse. How? Oh, he started reading these strange old books. He started going to see this palm reader in town. Palm reader? You have a name? No. All right, so, there are a few psychics and palm readers in town. There's someone named El Divino. There's... There's the mysterious Mr. Fortinsky. - Uh, Missouri Moseley, some dude -- - Wait, wait... Missouri Moseley? What? That's a psychic? Uh...yeah.Yeah, I guess so. In dad's journal... Look at this. First page, first sentence. Read that. "I went to Missouri... and I learned the truth." I always thought he meant the state. All right, then. Don't you worry about a thing. Your wife is crazy about you. Whew! Poor bastard. His woman cold-bangin'the gardener. Why didn't you tell him? People don't come here for the truth. They come for good news. Well? Sam and Dean, come on already. I ain't got all day. Well, let me look at you. Oh, you boys grew up handsome. And you were one goofy-looking kid, too. Sam. Oh, honey. I'm sorry about your girlfriend. And your father... ...he's missing? How'd you know all that? Well, you were just thinking it, just now. Well, where is he? Is he okay? I don't know. Don't know? You're supposed to be a psychic, right? Boy, you see me sawing some bony tramp in half? You think I'm a magician? I may be able to read thoughts and sense energies in a room, but I can't just pull facts out of thin air. Sit! Please. Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table, I'm gonna whack you with a spoon. I didn't do anything. Well, you were thinking about it. Okay, so... our dad. When did you first meet him? He came for a reading a few days after the fire. I just told him what was really out there in the dark. I guess you could say I drew back the curtains for him. What about the fire? Do you know about what killed our mom? A little. Your daddy took me to your house. He was hoping I could sense the echoes, the fingerprints of this thing. And could you? I don't... What was it? I don't know. But it was evil. Look, I feel just awful about the poor man's hand, but how can I be held liable? Yeah, but I can't afford a lawyer. Okay, listen, y-you just got to let me call you back. Richie, mommy's gonna be right back, okay? Okay. Okay. So, you think something's back in that house? Definitely. I don't understand. What? I haven't been back inside, but I've been keeping an eye on the place, and it's been quiet. No sudden deaths, no freak accidents. Why is it acting up now? I don't know. But dad going missing and Jessica dying and now this house, all happening at once. It just feels like something's starting. That's a comforting thought. Juicy! Oh, baby, either we have rats or mommy is going crazy. Richie? Richie?! Baby, where are you?! Wha... - Mum! - Oh, my god! Oh, baby! Sam, Dean, what are you doing here? Hey, Jenny. Um, this is our friend Missouri. If it's not too much trouble, we were hoping to show her the house, you know, for old time's sake. No, you know, this isn't a good time. - I'm kind of busy. - Listen, Jenny,it's important. Ow! Give the poor girl a break. Can't you see she's upset? Forgive this boy. He means well. He's just not the sharpest tool in the shed. But hear me out. About what? About this house. What are you talking about? I think you know what I'm talking about. You think there's something in this house, something that wants to hurt your family. Am I mistaken? Who are you? We're people who can help, who can stop this thing, but you're gonna have to trust us, just a little. If there's a dark energy around here, this room should be the center of it. Why? This used to be your nursery, Sam. This is where it all happened. That an emf? Yeah. Amateur. I don't know if you boys should be disappointed or relieved, but this ain't the thing that took your mom. Are you sure? How do you know? It isn't the same energy I felt the last time I was here. It's something different. What is it? Not it... them. There's more than one spirit in this place. What are they doing here? They're here because of what happened to your family. You see, all those years ago, real evil came to you. It walked this house. That kind of evil leaves wounds, and sometimes wounds get infected. I don't understand. This place is a magnet for paranormal energy. It's attracted a poltergeist, a nasty one, and it won't rest until Jenny and her babies are dead. You said there was more than one spirit. There is. I just can't quite make out the second one. Well, one thing's for damn sure, nobody's dying in this house, ever again. So, whatever is here, how do we stop it? So, what is all this stuff anyway? Angelica root, van van oil, crossroad dirt, a few other odds and ends. What are we supposed to do with it? We're gonna put them inside the walls in the north, south, east, west corners on each floor of the house. Punching holes in the drywall. Jenny's gonna love that. She'll live. And this will destroy the spirits? It should. It should purify the house completely. We'll each take a floor, but we work fast. Once the spirits realize what we're up to, things are gonna get bad. Okay. Careful. Look, I -- you know, I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you guys here alone. Just take your kids to the movie or something, and it'll be over by the time you get back. Okay. Aah! Uhh! Sam! Sam! Come on. Are you sure this is over? I'm sure. Why? Why do you ask? No, never mind. It's nothing, I guess. Hello? We're home. What happened? Hi. Sorry. Um, we'll... we'll pay for all of this. Don't you worry. Dean's gonna clean up this mess. Well, what are you waiting for, boy? Get the mop. And don't cuss at me. Okay. So, tell me again. What are we still doing here? I don't know, I-I just... I still have a bad feeling. Why? Missouri did her whole zelda rubenstein thing. The house should be clean. This should be over. Yeah, probably, but I just want to make sure. That's all. The problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now. Dean! Dean! You grab the kids, I'll get Jenny. - Come on! - Jenny! - I can't open the door! - Stand back! - Come on! - No, my kids! Sam's got your kids. Come on. Help! Please! Come here. Don't look, don't look. Sari, take your brother outside as fast as you can and don't look back. Are you okay, baby? - Sari, where's Sam? - He's inside. Something's got him. Ugh! Aah! Sam! Sam?! Sam! - No, don't! Don't! - What? Why? Because I know who it is. I can see her now. Mom. Dean. Sam. I'm sorry. F-for what? You, get out of my house. And let go of my son. Now it's over. Thanks for these. Don't thank me. They're yours. Well, there are no spirits in there anymore, this time for sure. Not even my mom? No. What happened? Your mom's spirit and the poltergeists' energy, they canceled each other out. Your mom destroyed herself going after the thing. Why would she do something like that? Well, to protect her boys, of course. Sam, I'm sorry. For what? You sensed it was here, didn't you? Even when I couldn't. What's happening to me? I know I should have all the answers, but... I don't know. Sam, you ready ? Bye. Bye Sam. Ah. Don't you boys be strangers. We won't. See you around. That boy... he has such powerful abilities. Why he couldn't sense his own father, I have no idea. Mary's spirit... do you really think she saved the boys? I do. John Winchester, I could just slap you. Why don't you go talk to your children? God, I want to. You have no idea how much I want to see them.
