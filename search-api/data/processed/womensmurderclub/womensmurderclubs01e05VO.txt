(lindsay) are those blood stains on that scarf? yeah, i was gonna ride by the labe and see if the blood belonged to the victim. or our killers. what are we thinking? ethan came here to meet somebody and got ambushed? or he was followed-- they ? his car ? following hime pulled his gun... things went south from there. there was a scuffle. killer lost his scarf. maybe he was wounded. ethan got a clean shot to the forehead. uh, i'll be right back. okay, we know nothing fit to print, so don't bother asking. i wasn't going to ask. i was going to offer information. well, in that case, offer away. this park used to be totally evil-drug-dealer infested. then there was this whole save-the-park campaign, a-and-- it got caned up, i know. who do you think did the cleaning? oh, right, the police. do you think the dealers came back? could be another one of our ten possible theories. maybe his cell records will shed a little light. i'll get rolling on a subpoena. looks like another ? i love my job. y at the hall. i've gotta go notify a very young widow. yes? good evening. i'm inspector boxer. this is inspector jacobi. we're looking for ethan williams' wife? beth? well, she's with ethan. they went out for a walk when he came home from work. we're ethan's parents. is everything okay? i'm very sorry to tell you, uh, your son was found dead. he was shot and killed. what about beth? where is she? oh, my god! the baby. they had a baby with them? beth is nine months pregnant. ±¾×öä»½ö¹©ñ§ï°½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- womens.murder.club µú1¼¾µú5¼¯ -=ææàãðü×öä»×é=- ·­òë£ºòàãî ð£¶ô£ºf.o.g. ê±¼äöá£ºd&ëéêó</font> found a scarf at the crime scene. ethan's parents said that beth was wearing one when they left. it had blood on it. search the whole park? there was no body. it looks like an abduction. the car was abandoned, and we found beth's purse in her bedroom with 200 bucks and credit cards inside. so she didn't take off on her own. whoever killed him-- most likely took beth. and there's only one reason people are gonna abduct a woman who's nine months pregnant. somebody wants that baby. beth williams, white female, 20 years old. we believe she was taken from hawthorne park at approximately 11:00 p.m. now until we find her and her baby, they are all you care about. baker, martinez, i want you guys to hit the art gallery where beth's husband worked. you guys work the neighbors, see if there was anybody suspicious hanging around beth or ethan in the last few days. miller, recanvass the park area, and you look for video cameras in a 10-block radius. now this girl is stickin' out to here. she'll be hard to miss. inector boxer's gonna be in the thick of things, so i'm command central. everybodgets o.t. tonigh let's find her. (officers speaking indistinctly) you contact the girl's parents? they're both dead. she moved here out of high school. outside of her in-laws, she's got nobody. which is probably why she was in such a hurry to start a family of her own. at least she's young, white and pretty. the media will help us. what was that? what? that. well you got married soon. you knew that. well, yeah, but th is really soon. you know... i liked our invitations better. they were less fancy. gee, thanks. make sure you notify all the divisions. our place is kind of small, so ethan and beth would drive to the park to take a walk, you know, get... get some privacy. is it possible they were buying drugs? no. how can you even ask me that? have you seen anyone unfamiliar hanging around the neighborhood lately? had either of them made any new friends? i don't think so. i mean, ethan was always out working, you know, either at the art gallery or at the mall. you know, they were trying to save up for their own place. how about beth? was she working? doctor told her  take it easy. she had some bleeding early on. but she wants to go to college after the baby is born, maybe be a nurse. was beth already pregnant when they got married? uh-huh. they were married almost a year when that happened. it wasn't planned. but they got used to the idea real quick. they were so excited about that little baby girl. find beth... and my granddaught. please. just find them. how's he doing? eh. it's a hell of a thing to lose a kid. i told him to go home and try to get some sleep. you should grab a couple of hours yourself. this thing could drag on. yeah, maybe later. well, i'll go make the coffee. ethan called a bunch of discount stores looking for a good deal on a crib. okay. what's this call at 10:00 last night? somebody named consuelo ?. she hasn't called me back. okay, well, i need more than that. i need a full name. i need an address. yeah, phone company couldn't get us complete records till start of business. they're on their way over. meantime, i'm doin' the best i can. hey, it's  a i situation. what did jacobi find out? well, everyone at the gallery seems to think that ethan walked on water. i'm sure jacobi will hear the same story at the mall. yeah, people have such nice things to say about a dead man. yeah, maybe this time it's actually true. yeah, what else you got? was there anything useful? okay, thanks for calling. i set up a hotline at the "register" web site. goabout  calls so far. let me guess-- beth was abducted by aliens. either that or arab terrorists. the crazies can't decide. perfect timing. here's the bullet. how can you have such a gross job and still be more emotional stable than the rest of us? speak for yourself. what's that, a .38? i'm betting it matches the .38 his company issued him a few months ago. make sure you get it tested. yeah. always do. the preliminary x screen came back. our boy's clean. he would've made a good papa. you didn't check for alcohol. page three. he was sober. somebody's snippish today. did you check under the nails for d.n.a.? already at the lab. i put a rush on it how could anybody want a baby so badly they'd kill fort? god, you're young. hey, i'm with her-- midnight feedings and babysitters or clubbing with my girls and noisy sex with my boyfriend. when's the last time we went clubbing? we could.</i> you do realize that if you don't have kids, you'll have  grow old without a lifetime supply of funky homemade ceramic pencil holders. you love those pencil holders. more than life itself. what about you? you want a little boxer baby? i just want to find theirs. they were married and in love, their first baby on the way. whole life was in front of 'em. ethan was pretty nervous about the baby. poor guy barely had any fingernails left. chewed 'em to the quick. but  w ay into the dad thing. their lamaze teacher's business card. it's pretty worn around the edges. looks like it's been in and out of his wallet a lot. "consuelo sanchez." ms. 10:00-p.m. phone call. did they have lamaze classes when you were having kids? you'd have to ask my ex-wife. which wife-- one, two or three? (laughs) i forget. what i do remember is working overtime for five years ? i bet you were a good father. eh, i was a cop. so do you think the kidnapper's planning to keep this baby for himself, or is he planning to sell it? i don't know. i just hope he waits for beth to go into labor before cutting her open. hi, we're looking for consuelo sanchez. (woman) they were a real sweet couple. ethan would take off work so he didn't miss any classes. why did they call you last night? oh, beth was having braxton hicks contractions. i said take a walk. it... oh, god. if they hadn't gone for that walk, this never would have happened. it's not your fault, but we do need to know where you were last night. uh, i was at my cousin's. i can give you her number. it's like there's a black cloud over my class. last week, one of my girls gave birth to a stillborn. she was nearly full-term. did she know beth? they always sat together. what was her name? i don't think she's up for talking to cops right now. tell me her name. melanie topor. she was gonna be a single mom. melanie topor? what is that sound? melanie? san francisco police department. we need to talk to you. (woman) come in. what do you want? is there a baby here? i don't have a baby. my baby died. i'm very sorry. do you, uh, mind if we look around? i still have milk. when i feel better, i'm gonna take it to the hospital for the sick babies. it shouldn't go to waste. i have 15 bottles in the freezer. melanie... we're investigating the disappearance of beth williams and the murder of ethan williams. oh. do you know anyone who could have hurt them? well, the tv said beth was kidnapped by somebody who wanted her baby. your lamaze teacher said that you and beth were good friends. she was, uh, she was pretty lonely. why do you say that? well, she was cooped up with ethan and his parents... and then he found out about her boyfriend. beth had a boyfriend? what was his name? i don't know. i met her after they split. you don't think that he was the one tt-- melanie, can you remember anything she told you about him? this is very important. i'm trying. i think she said that he was-- he was from saramon. such a stupid thing to remember. th-that's fine. can you remember anything else? she said that he was handsome and exciting-- a lot more fun than ethan... at first. but then she got pregnant... and did an amnio and found out that it wasn't his, and he started screamin' at her for sleepin' with her husband. she said it was the first and the last time he ever hit her. oh. excuse me. yeah? hey. the blood work ? came back it's placental blood mixed with amniotic fluid. okay, thanks. beth's water broke at the crime scene. that was 11 hours ago. if she's still alive, she's in labor... now. her husband works two jobs, goes to lamaze classes, and she goes cheatin' on him? she got married too young. she didn't have her head on straight. one day she's into safe. next day she's into sexy. she es her whole life all mapped out for her and decides she doesn't like it. so no perfect couple award after all. just once before i die i would like to see a marriage that really was what i thought it was. you know, my first child, i was only in labor six hours. that baby could be out in the world already. i'm not gonna accept that as a possibility. why? because if the baby's been born, there's a chance we're not looking for beth anymore. we're looking for her corpse. as long as beth is in labor, she's probably safe. yeah, why risk cutting the baby out of her when it's already coming out the natural way? there is another possibility. beth and romeo got back together. they whack hubby and ride off ? (lindsay) with hubby's baby? i can't see boyfriend raising another man's child. ? she didn't meet him on the job. she didn't have one. there are other places to meet men. yeah, the hotline got a couple of calls that beth shopped at the market on 7th and walnut-- a prime hookup spot. do you know how many of those hotline tips actually lead somewhere real? and yet i am checking out each and every one of them that don't involve martians or o.j. simpson. i'm gonna schedule another press conference, keep beth's face out there. i'm gonna go torture the in-laws some more. something is up with her. is something up with her? baby cases. cops hate baby cases. ohh. yeah, that's right. press conference is set for half an hour. here's a couple more pictures you can use. let me know if you need anything else. how's she doing... with everything? i worry about her. she doesn't want to be worried about. yeah, i know, but... why'd you take this job? it's a big step up for me. you had other opportunities, better ones. i hear you could have gone and worked for the chief. i wanted to work homicide. you wanted an excuse to be near her again. i am marrying heather. if you say so. i can't believe beth had an affair. how could she do that to our son? did ethan know about it? we believe so. he never said anything to either of you? he always protected us from the bad stuff. when he was a boy, he didn't go to the hospital till his appendix almost burst. he didn't want to complain about the pain. techs found this in the trash can and put it back together. to "beth williams." return address "sam johannes." i remember that. you hardly ever get handwritten letterthese days. i asked beth who it was from. she said an old friend. you think that's the guy? if he hurts my granddaughter, i'll make that son of a bitch pay. no, i will. according to jill, sam did three years for almost killing a guy with a pool cue. any chance he's from san ramon? you want everything. so beth is one of those girls who wants to marry mr. clean but likes doing the nasty with the nasty bs. the story of my life. who are you, clean or nasty? (chuckles) sam johannes? where is he? (man) no, no, that was fine. you can mark it. hey, hey, hey, hey. oh. merry christmas. nice. (jacobi) sam johannes? what? you sam johannes? where's beth williams? i don't know who you're talking about. your girlfriend. where is she? where's the baby? i need to talk to my lawyer. he could be holding beth prisoner somewhere. we gotta talk to this slimeball's coworkers... got people on it. and get in touch with his wife. baker has people on that. wellget him some help and go through his credit cards. who's this, his lawyer? lindsay, lindsay, i need you to take it easy, okay? we're no longer married. you're not allowed to give me inane advice. sure i can. i'm your boss. you have to understand, my client got screwed by the cops once before. we have a missing girl whose water broke at least 14 hours ago. i can assure you sam had nothing to do with it. how do you know beth? last time i talked to you people, i got three years in san q. how long were you sleeping with her? (scoffs) that wasn't the nature of their association. what werthey doing, playing parcheesi? if this baby dies while you're jerking me around, i will make san q. look like club med. we got enough to hold this guy? sure, except for that whole probable cause thing. inspector jacobi? sam's wife sachiko. uh, ma'am, why don't we go back to my desk? beth williams was not my husband's girlfriend. then who was she? you wanted to adopt beth's baby? before we go any further, we need assurances that-- we met her on an internet adoption site. it's kind of an informal place where pregnant women can connect with people who want to become parents. beth didn't have a computer.she ? we've been trying for years to adopt or even be foster parents, but-- when you have a felony on your record, no one wants you, even if you've got ten years sober, and you've completely turned did ethan know that beth wanted to give up the baby? yeah. we met the both of them over coffee. they were getting divorced. i don't think either one of them wanted to become a single parent. why'd she choose you? she said she liked my e-mails. and you offered them money, too, right? how much? don't answer that. and that's why you weren't talking, because baby buying is illegal. it was only $15,000, and it was to cover maternityxpenses. totally legal. depends on the contract. which you sent beth in the mail. and she i.m.'ed us yesterday that she'd signed it and that ethan would, too, as soon as he got home. but then we never hed from her again. maybe you did. maybe beth told you that they had changed their minds, and you weren't getting the baby after all. see? what'd i tell you about cops? is my client under arrest? it would be better for you-- okay, let's get the hell out of here. come on. come on. good luck. sachiko, is there anything else you could-- come on. dale peterson. beth and i were i.m.'ing one day, and she said she had a boyfriend named dale peterson. dale peterson from san ramon. i'll start hunting him down. meanwhile i'm gonna need-- computer hard drives from beth's local library. i'll draw up a subpoena and track down our resident geek. (cindy) here we go. somebody at the library logged in to pacificbaby.net. talk about creepy. any old pervert could log on here and say he's an adoptive couple. find some vulnerable pregnant woman and invite her to some... who knows. this job is bad for my head. okay. sam johannes chatted with "bw20." beth williams, 20 years old. this is from 9:30 last night. bw20 says, "we'll bring you the contract first thing tomorrow." (jill) "i can't tell you how happy this makes us." so sam the man and sachikoko were telling the truth. (telephone rings)</i> wait a minute. why didn't beth tell her good friend melanie that she's putting her baby up for adoption? (ring) jill bernhardt. she probably felt weird about giving up the baby ? you know, salt in the wound. wa a minute. is there anything from what's his name-- dale peterson? uh, not yet. got it. gotta move. what is it? that was lindsay. dale peterson is not from san ramon. he lives onthe "san ramon." it's a boat. i have about five minutes to push through a search warrant. (typing) (lindsay) this place is certainly a step up from her in-laws'. yeah. she meets an adventurer who lives on the high seas... hell, i'd run away with him, too. dale petson? san francisco p.d. we have a warrant. you smell that? yeah. bleach. (lindsay) somebody's been cleanin'. not a very good job. mnh-mnh. lindsay... we got a knife. you think we're looking at another homicide? i think either way, beth had her baby. still no leads on dale peterson. no permanent place employment. what do you think he did with beth after... we're sending down divers just in case. i'm gonna hit the marina and see if anybody saw dale, beth or a very newborn baby. all right, keep me posted. how could anyone do this? actually, homicide is a leading cause of death of pregnant women. oh, my god. if you want to kill someone, at least shoot them. don't slice them open with a fish knife. it's possible he just used the knife to cut the baby's umbilical cord. why go to all that trouble for a baby that isn't even his? maybe dale thought beth lied and the baby really was his. we found the placenta. that's it. no kids. i mean it. you don't have to give birth on a boat. ugh. was the baby born alive? no way to know. what? (cindy) hey, i got a hotline tip that a-- forget the damn hotline. that a pregnant girl used to hang out at some bar by the pier with a guy who lived on a boat. so i've been making the rounds, and, uh, guess who's trying to pick up a young hottie at the lucky badger? dale peterson. you wait. i'm on my way. i'll keep saying it. i have no idea what happened to this baby. you want me to say it in french, spanish... she was born on your boat. if i could help you guys, i would. i've got nothing against beth. i think she's a great girl. a little screwed up, but who isn't? when's the last time you saw her? i broke up with her... must be months ago. we hear she broke up with you because you like to hit pregnant women. that's not my style. okay, she kicked me in the nads when i told her it was over. but i never touched her. you were pissed the baby wasn't yours. are you kidding? i was thrilled. look... beth was a small-town girl that i met on the pier one day listening to street musicians. i invited her to my boat. we had a good time for a few months there. i figured she was looking for a little break from her boring life. i am sorry if she was hoping for more. her blood is all over your boat. great. i haven't been home in three days. i never go there on the weekends, and she knows that. maybe i should go in there. hey, she's doing great. she's a pro. where were you last night from 9:00 p.m. on? that's my business. my partner is still on your boat. i can just give him a call and tell him to tear the place apart. i was with a friend. i travel in a lot of different circles. this one's a little more, uh, pacific heights. uh-huh. what's your lucky friend's name? all right, see, that's where i'm kind of stuck. um, she provides me with the wherewithal to maintain my lifestyle. and unfortunately, she's, uh, she's a little shy, so. shy because she doesn't exist. we've got you cold on beth's murder, and you know it. whatur main concern is right now is this baby girl. so if you could just tell us where she is and ease her grandparents' minds, i'm sure we can work out a deal. i'm a pretty laid-back guy... but i don't like it when chicks try to hustle me. is that what beth did to you? even chicks as sexy as you. what did you do with the baby? honey, if you want a baby, i'll give you one. whoo! get up! you want to mess with me? wow. boxer. boxer! you're not gonna tell me where this kid is? you gonna hit me? get the hell off me! boxer! lindsay, hey! back off. back off. where is that baby? i can handle it. back off! back--back off! you back--come on. come on. where the hell is that baby? boxer? is that your name? yeah, i want the videotapes, 'cause i'm pressin' charges. you just made me a millionaire, baby! get off me! what the hell did you do that for? are you kidding me? i was about to break him-- in half, which doesn't help! now we still don't know if the baby is alive or dead. lindsay, calm down. calm d--god, i am so glad i'm not married to you anymore. you and me both. maybe jacobi ought to take the lead on this one. maybe jacobi should take the lead on the entire department! lindsay. how could you-- lindsay? what? luke just called from the e.r. somebody droed off a baby girl. you're sure nobody saw the baby being dropped off? are we sure it's beth's baby? uh, shwas found in a fishing tackle box by the back maintenance door. i don't suppose anybody was careful about fingerprints? i didn't think so. here's your little princess. is she okay? yeah. her attending says she's doing great. oh, she's actually kind of beautiful. ??? you can touch her. no, thanks. stop! sir, ma'am, i-- thank you. you can't come in here dressed like that. is that her? you're not dressed properly. please, we just need to see our child. i'm sorry. you don't understand. we're the family. we'd like to see our child. thank you. please don't interre. sam. uh, why don't we just go in the hall? let's just go out in the hall. that baby is legally ours. actually, she's not. her mother agreed to it. r lawyer says the birth mother's wishes-- you don't have a signed contract. the grandparents' claim is preeminent. how'd you know the baby was here? um, we read it on the internet... on some tv station web site. when? maybe a half an hour ago. my boss gave the media the information 15 minutes ago before that, no one knew. okay, so it was 15 minutes ago. you want another trip downtown? some woman called my cell phone about an hour ago and told us the baby was at the hospital. you didn't recognize her voice? no. give me your phone. we just didn't want things to get complicated. give me your phone. now. i didn't call anybody. you used t payphone right down the block. that's not too bright. i-i didn't. what happened to beth, melanie? what'd you do to her? nothing. that's crazy. tell me why we shouldn't believe that you killed beth and ethan and stashed the baby somewhere. these weren't for sick babies, were they? they were for beth and ethan's baby. but you panicked, and you dumped the baby at the hospital. no, you got it all wrong. that's not what-- you're under arrest. that not why i took the baby there. i...i don't know what happened. she was scared. she asked me for my help. she said it was best for the baby. she? no! beth! get back. get out. just calm down, all right? nobody has to get hurt today. out! out of the room! all right. all right. now just calm down. you, too. get out. it's okay. i got it. i said get out. drop your gun. a lot of people have been looking for you. shut up. drop it. okay. god. don't make me shoot you. okay. just calm down, all right? look. see? is that your husband's gun? oh... is that the one you shot him with? i was just trying to scare him. the gun went off. you were mad at him. he said that he would sign the adoption papers. he promised me, but... then he wouldn't do it. and then your water broke, and you knew the baby was coming, and you didn't know what to do. i just--i just. i just wanted to be free, go somewhere, you know? like, start all over again without-- without ethan or dale or the baby or anybody. why not just give ethan the baby and go? why give him anything? he was breaking up with me, and i needed the money so i could start fresh. so the gun went off, and you panicked. and i couldn't go anywhere. i didn't go to the hospital. they'd find me. and you delivered that baby all by yourself? i was so scared. then the baby started crying, and i had to get her to the hospital. i knew melanie would help. she's my only frie. are they coming here? my partner probably called them. beth, why don't you just give me the gun? no. no. i'm leaving. beth-- i'll shoot you. do you want to know how your daughter is? doctors say she's doing fine. beth, you could've dropped that baby into the ocean. it certainly would have been a lot safer r you. but you didn't. you took her to the hospital. you did a great job of bringing your baby into this world. no! no! you okay? i'm fine. ??? you know the media's not allowed to take pictures up here. shh. shh, shh, shh. i'm just saying... don't let us stop you. luke never sees that picture. oh, come on. you look adorable. hey. hey. this little girl looks like she's about ready to go home. shh. wherever that is. she belongs with her grandparents. hey. sweetie. oh. oh, my gosh. oh, look at her. oh, sweetie. oh, my gosh. excuse me. would you mind if i took a picture?
