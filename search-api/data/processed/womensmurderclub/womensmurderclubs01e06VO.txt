Oh, No. Oh, No. All Right, So I'll See You Back Here At Noon. Okay. All Right? Come Here. Mwah. Oh, My... You're Gonna Be Great. It'll Be Fine, I Promise. Boxer. Yeah, Uh, I'll Be Right There. Ow. Son Of A... I Know, I Know. I'm Sorry. You Have A Hot Date Last Night I Didn't Know About? No. Why? 'Cause I Tried Callin', But Your Phone Was Off. So What Did They Call Us For? It's A Suicide, Right? Ah, It's Joe Donovan. Joe Donovan? San Fran's Q.B. For The What, I Don't Know, Last 15 Years? Three Super Bowl Rings, Future Hall  Famer? Q.B. Stands For Quarterback, Right? You Must Be The Pride Of Texas. Come On, Mrs. Donovan. I Have To Be With Him. They're Gonna Take Him Away. It's Okay, Mrs. Donovan. Let's Just Go Back Upstairs. Joe's Wife Parris. She Found The Body This Morning I Just Need My Husband. When She And The Kids Returned From Their House In Napa. At The Moment, She's Floating Away On A Fistful Of Sedatives. Wait, Did The Kids See-- No, They Didn't See A Thing. So Wife, Two Kids-- This Guy Must Have Been In Some Serious Pain To End It This Way. Joe Donovan Was Not One To Let Pain Stop Him. The Man Once Played Half A Game With Two Broken Ribs And A Dislocated Shoulder. You Respected Him. Yeah, And So Should You. He Did Take The Coward's Way Out. What? I'm Just Saying-- That You Woke Up On The Wrong Side Of The Bed This Morning. I Can See That. Uh, Is Tom Here? No. Why? No Reason. U Guys Are Just In Time. So He Got Things Rolling With Booze And Pills, Then Got The Job Done With A Knife? Depressing, But Definitely Possible. Or Not. Looks Like Murder To Me. Okay, So A Guy Is Found Dead In A Hot Tub With Booze, Pills, Slit Wrists, And It's Not Suicide? Yeah. What Are You Thinking? It Just Doesn't Fit. Not To Generalize, But Most Men, When They Choose To End It, They Pick A More Traumatic Exit Like, Uh, Hanging, Shooting, Train Tracks. Unlike Most Women, Who Are Vain Till The End. They'll Take Slit Wrists Or A Bottle Of Pills Over A Gunshot To The Head Any Day. Maybe Joe Donovan ??????????????/ No, The Science Supports Lindsay. His Cuts Start Superior And End Inferior To The Wrist, And That's The Exact Opposite Of What I'd Exct. And The Knife Was Wiped Clean. There Are No Prints On It. Plus There's No Suicide Note. Someone Staged This. I Had Joe's Poster On My Wall Growing Up. Number 11, Big Guns. Ah, This Is So Surreal. Okay. One, How Old Are You? And Two, A Football Player? I Would Have Guessed More, You Know, ????Nsync, Backstreet Boys. My Parents Only Had One Kid, So You're Looking At The Son My Father Always Wanted. That's Kind Of Sweet. Is That The Wife? No, That's The Agent-- Drew Kaplan. The Wife Was At A Charity Event In Napa Last Night. She Left Joe Here At Home For Guys' Poker Night. Yeah, The Donovans They Raised Half A Million-Plus For The Children's Cancer Ward At Mission Cross North Last Year. Okay, Let's Get Take It Back To The Station.???? The Vultures Are Circling. No Offense. Why Is The D.A.'S Office Here? Standard Procedure In Cases This High Profile. Is There Something Suspicious About Joe's Death? We Have No Comment Maurice! Maurice, You Saw Joe Last Night. What Was His Mood Like? How Does It Feel To Be The Starting Quarterback? Come On, Give Me A Break. Joe Was A Friend. I'm Not Even Thinkin' About The Game. So You, Uh, Left Theame Early. Yeah. Mo Got Lucky On The River, Knocked Me Out Around 11:00. Hate It When Then Happens. Yeah. Uh, Mo--That's Maurice Jackson, Right? Yeah. Mm. Okay, I Think That's It. You Know, I-I Used To, Uh, I Used To Play A Little. You Know, They Said I Had Great Hands. So You Were A Wide Receiver? ??????????/ Think You Might've Had A Little Something For Me? You Know, Well, Maybe In My 20s. Yeah, Well, Let Me Know If There's Anything Else I Can Do For You. All Right. Why--Why Can't I Get A Blind Date With A Guy Like That? 'Cause He's Married. Hey, Is That Who I Think It Is? The One And Only. I Just Finished Taking His Statement. I Almost Asked Him To Sign My Football. Ah, I Should've Asked Him To Sign It. What Is It About This Game? Move. Hey, Uh, Would You Mind Signing This For My Partner, Please? It's--It's For My Nephew, Actually. His Name Is Warren. How's The Case? Good. Uh, We Just Talked To Three Of The Guys That Were Playing Poker With Joe Last Night. After The Game, They All, Uh, Went Home To Their... Wives, Uh, Or Mistresses Or Their Girlfriends. You Know, E-E-Each Guy Said That Joe Wasn't The Type To Kill Himself, But, Um, No One's Venturing A Guess On Who Would Want To Murder Him. We Haven't Spoken To Maurice Jackson Yet. What About The Knife? It Matches The Set At The Donovan House, But Their Set Is Complete. The One That Was Used To Kill Joe Seems To Be An Orphan. It's Got Some Special Imprint On It They're Having Trouble Identifying. Uh, You Try Pulling The Tapes From The Houses In Joe's Neighborhood? We're On That, And Claire's Having A Hard Time Determining The Time Of Death, Uh, Just 'Cause, You Know, The Body Was Boiling In A Hot Tub. Okay. Okay. Okay, Wait. I'm Sorry That I Kicked You Out... No. You Know, After We... I Panicked. Me, Too. Wait. Um... What? You, Uh... Okay, Well, Uh, Th's It For Now. Okay. Mm. Joe Had Ten Million Reasons Not To Commit Suicide. That Was, Uh, Joe's Salary This Year. Oh. Oh. Really? Well, We Don't Think That Joe Committed Suicide Either. How Is It That You Ended Up At The House, Ms. Kaplan? The Team Offered Joe A 1-Year Extension On His Contract. We Were Gonna Discuss It Over Breakfast, So I Went To The House. The Cops Were Already There, And Parris Was Hysterical, So I Fed Her Some Pills. Thanks For That. I Have Plenty To Go Around, And I Certainly Didn't Want Her Talking To Anyone In That State. Let's Talk About That Contract. Rumor Mill Has It Joe Was Gonna Retire After The Season. Negotiation 101? Hello? That's What I Wanted You And Everybody Else To Think. And Joe? What Did He Think? Joe Was Gonna Sign. I Mean, He Had Me Set A Press Conference For Thursday. All Right. So According To The Housekeeper, You Have The Donovans' House Keys, Their Alarm Codes, So You And Joe Were Close, Right? Oh, I Get It. I'm Hot, He's Hot, We Worked Closely Together, Probably Couldn't Keep Our Hands Off Of Each Other. It Always Leads To Sex, Right? You Tell Me. Look, I Was Joe's Work Wife-- Contract Negotiations, Image Licensing, You Name It, And Occasionally Some Emotional Hand-Holding, But Only When It Came To Football, And Even Then I Didn't Enjoy It. Tenderness, Intimacy-- That Was Parris' Job. Besides, I Spent The Night With My Ver... Rachel. Do You Even Care That Joe Is Dead? You Know, Right Now It Is All About Damage Control. I'll Cry Later. And Idea Who'd Want To Kill Joe? Well, I Did Leave My Old Agency To Start My Own Company. They Weren't Pleased That I Took Their Star Client. So Maybe They Killed Joe To Punish Me. Right, Because This Is All About You. Huh? Whcan't I See Him? Who? Joe Donovan. He's Here, Right? His Body's Here, But The Joe You Remember Has Passed On To A Better Place. Well, Can I At Least See His Body Then? No. What About His Super Bowl Ring? Did He Have That On Him? Isn't There Some Homework You Can Do Before Your Dad Gets Here? Mom, Please, My Hero Is Dead. I Can't Do Homework. I Have Something You Guys Are Gonna Want To See. Hey, Nate. Nate, You Take One Step Outside Of This Room, And I Don't Need To Tell You What's Gonna Happen,Ight? Fine. Do You Remember How You Gave Me Ground Rules Before I Was, Uh, You Know, In The Club, And How I Have Followed Every Single One Of Them? Now I Have Some Ground Rules. Is That Really Necessary? It Is If You Want To See The Disk. Give Us The Ground Rules. You Do Not Get To Ask The Name Of My Source. What If I Need To Talk To Him? Another Reporter, Who Will Not Be Named, Taped A Closed Practice That Joe's Team Held Last Week. If The Team Or The League Found Out, This Person Could Be Fired. You Do Not Get The Name Of My Source. It Seems Reasonable. I Don't Like It. Okay. Okay, Fine. Okay, Thanks. There's Just One More. You Don't Get To Keep The Disk. All Right, No. If There's Information On That Disk That Can Help Me Solve This Murder-- These Are My Ground Rules. A Man Is Dead. Fine. It Better Be Good. Cover Two... Wait, I Saw That Other Guy At Joe's House This Morning. Maurice Jackson, Backup Quarterback-- First-String The Moment Joe Died. And The Only One Of Joe's Poker Buddies From Last Night That Hasn't Come In To Talk To Us Yet. Come On. You Want A Piece Of Me? I'm-A Kill You! You're Dead! I Promise I'm-A Kill You! You're Gone! Maurice, Chill, Man! Well, Let's See If Maurice Keeps His Promises. Heard Maurice Jackson Finally Came In. Is Lindsay Sharpening Her Claws? Ah, She Was, Until He Lawyered Up. Of Course. I Wonder What $1,000-An-Hour Pretty Boy Maurice Has On Retainer. Hey, We Must Be Going To The Same Place. Hanson. Public Defender? Doesn't Maurice Have Ten Million Reasons To Hire A High-Priced Pit Bull? $3 Million. He May Have Been A First-Round Pick, But He's Still Second-Stri. I Handled A Case For Maurice When I Was Still In Private Practice. We Kept In Touch. I S In The Neighborhood, Told Him I'd Stop By. Uh, Assault, Wasn't It? Hey, Someone's Been Doing His Research. Yeah, But You Know That That Case Got Thrown Out Of Court, Right? On A Technicality. Well, God Is In The Details. So I've Advised Mauricnot To Talk. So Book Him Or Let Him Walk. Okay. Miss Bernhardt, Always A Pleasure. Give Me Two Minutes. Hmm? Mm. We Both Know A Public Defender Can't Have A Private Client. Doesn't Mean I Can't Give Him Free Advice If I So Choose, Which I Do. Maurice Was The Last Person At The Poker Game, Which Means He Was The Last Person To See Joe Alive. Listen, I Saw Him At Joe's House. He Cared About Him, And If He Cared About Him, He Should Want To Do Everything Possible To Help Catch The Man Who Lled Him. I'll Tell You What, Um, If You Go Out To Dinner With Me, I'll Let Your Inspector Friends Talk To Maurice. That's Completely Unethical... And Ridiculous! So Sue Me. Joe And I Talked Playbook. It Got Late. He Said His Back Was Killing Him, And He Was Gon' Hit The Hot Tub. He Was Alive And Well The Last I Saw Him. I Don't Know What Else To Tell You. You And Joe Ever Fight? 'Cause I Heard You Got Into It Last Week. You Got A Temper,???????????// I Like To Think Of It As Passion. That Was A Misunderstanding, And He Came After <I>Me.</I> A Misunderstanding That Ended With You Threatening To Kill Him. I've Been Taking A Crash Course On Football Since Joe Died. There's A Big Difference Between First-String And Second-String. You Had A Lot To Gain With Joe's Death. What Happened To Our ??????????? Why Would I Kill Joe? He Was Retiring. No, He Wasn't. You Have No Idea What You're Talkin' About, Lady. But I Do.????????????? Waiting On The Table For His Signature. He Was About To Announce It ????????????? Now At Had To Have Infuriated You. We're Done Here. Come On. Look, I Wanted To Be The Starter More Than Anything, But If Joe Wanted Back With The Team, And The Team Wanted Joe, I'm Cool With That. You Act Like I Don't Got Options. I Coulda Aed For A Trade, And Ten Other Teams Would've Signed Me In A Heartbeat. Nate? Are You Supposed To Be In There? You're Not Supposed To Be In Here. Come On. That's Not Joe. It's Just His Body. Hey, Do You Remember That Game A Couple Years Ago-- San Fran, Chicago? Q.B.S Couldn't See 20 Yards In The Snow? I Watched That Game With My Dad. Me, Too. Oh, The First Half Was A Total Defensive Battle. But When Joe Came Out Of The Locker Room After Halftime, Mm, Man, You Could Just Tell He Was Over It... He Laid That Perfect Spiral Into Williams' Waiting Arms To Start The Third Quarter. He Never Looked Back. You Should Remember Him That Way. You Stay Put Like You're Supposed To. Maybe I'll Show You My 2005 Super Bowl Program... Signed By The Team. Don't Tell My Mom I Was In There. Pinkie Swear. I Mean, It's Extortion... Or Blackmail Or Something. Just Go To Dinner With Him. It's Not Like U Still Have Any Feelings For The Guy. That's True. There's History, But We're Figuring Out How To Make Things Work, Kind Of Like Lindsay And Tom. Okay, Not Like Lindsay And Tom. It's Just I'm Trying To Be Super Extra-Good Girlfriend Right Now. Luke Is Being Deposed Today. For What? A Couple Months Ago, A 4-Year-Old Girl Came In To The E.R. Her Parents Thought She'd Eaten Some Crayons. Her Uth Was All Green. She Seemed Fine. She Was Running Around. Her Blood Work Was Good, So Luke Sent Her Home. In The Middle Of The Night, She Died--Iron Poisoning. Turned Out She'd Eaten A Bottle Of Multivitamins. That's Awful. Yeah. But I'm Sure Luke Did Everything He Could. The Parents Are Probably Just Trying To Make Sense Of It And Looking For Someone To Blame. Absolutely, I Get It, Believe Me. It's Just I Wish... I Don't Know, Some Other Doctor Had Been On That Night. What'd I Miss? Claire's About To Give Us The Rundown. Joe Donovan-- The Man Was Not Fine. Degenerative Arthritis, Multiple Concussions, Numerous Broken Bones. I Don't Know How This Guy Got Out Of Bed In The Morning, Let Alone Played A Game Of Football. The Tox Results Came Back. Joe Had Enough Benzodiazepine In His System To Knock Him Out Cold. So That's How ????????? To Cut His Wrists Without A Struggle. There's One Drug In Joe's System That I Haven't Been Able To Identify. I'm Having The Lab Run More Tests. Other Than That, It's What We Expected--Alcohol, A Small Amount Of Steroids And A Pharmacy Of Painkillers. Well, The Painkillers ??? The Guy Was A Boy Scout Except For A D.U.I. He Got Three Years Ago. No Drinking Was Involved, But He Did Cop To Taking Too Many Pills For An Injury. He Did Twice The Amount Of Community Service Hours He Was Sentenced To And Put It Behind Him. Wait, Ouldn't Lindsay Be Hearing All Of This? She Already Has. I Caught Her Right Before Joe's Wife Showed Up. Guess Those Sedatives ????? We Spoke To Your Nanny-- Julie, Was It? She's One Of Our Nannies, Although I-I-I Think That Julie's The Boys' Favorite. She Told Us That She Watched The Kids Last Night In Napa While You Went Alone To The Charity Dinner At Gallerka Vineyards. That's Right. Um... I Snuck In To Kiss The Boys Good Night When I Got Home Around... Midnight, And Then I Took A Sleeping Pill To Help Me Nod Off. You, Uh, Pop A Lot Of Pills, Mrs. Donovan. How Was Your Marriage? I Don't See How That's Relevant. I Know This Is Hard, But Anything That You Can Tell Us Will Help. It Was Hard Having Joe Gone All The Time. And Even When He Was At Home, I--His Mind Was On The Game. But That's Part Of The Deal When You Marry A Professional Athlete. I Knew What I Signed Up For It. What About Affairs? Joe?????????????? Joe Was A Star He Could Have Any Woman That He Wanted, But He Wasn't The Type. He Lived His Life Like He Played The Game, 100% Committed. Drew Kaplan Said That She W Joe's Work Wife. More Like A Slave Driver. Did You Know That She Convincehim To Sign On To Do Another Year, When All He Wanted To Do... Was Retire And Spend Time With Me And The Boys? Work Wife? I Don't Think So. I'm Sorry This Is So Upsetting, Parris. I Think That's Enough For Now. Thank You For Coming In. We Need To Subpoena The Gps Records From The Wife's Car. I Want Confirmation That Parris Was In Napa Last Night. Mrs. Donovan Is A Suspect? Well, Statistics Are Statistics For A Reason. It's Usually The Spouse... Even If She Does Come In A Perfect Package. Uh, I Need To Talk To You For A Second. We're Gonna Have This Conversation Now? Yeah, Just Take A Sec. Okay. It--We Were Vulnerable. It Was A Moment, All Right? No, No, Not--Not-- Hold On, No Running! Everyone Stay With Your Buddies. Hey! We're Here. Hi. Ew! Ms. Donnelly Kissed A Boy. That's Gross. It's My Fianc? That Makes It Okay. Hi, Lindsay. Hello. Uh, Like I Was Saying, Heather Is Visiting With Her Class Today. Whoa. Look Over There. That's Great. Do You Guys Have Any Questions? I'm So Sorry. I He ????????/ Are We Early? No. No, Right On Time. Is She A Cop? She's Too Pretty To Be A Cop. A Lady Can Be A Cop? I'm An Inspector, Actually. Um, Homicide. What's Homicide? Okay, You Guys, I Think-- I Thk We Should Let Inspector Boxer Get Back To Work. Have You Ever Shot Anyone? Well, Uh, Yes, But, Um, Only When I Didn't Have Any Other Choice. Are You Married? I Used To Be. I Mean, He-- It Doesn't Matter. Hey, Who Wants To See A Gun? Me! Me! Uh, I Need To Borrow Inspector Boxer For Just A Minute. Aw. Hey, Hey. You Know What's More Fun Than Talking To Her? Candy! It's Right Over There By The Jail Cell. Come On. Come On. Go, Go, Go, Go, Go! Have You Lost Your Mind? Is This Just Gonna Be A Thing Of Hers? She's Just Gonna Pop Up Whenever She Wants To? We Got Your <I>Us'.</I> Thank You. Tom Is Marrying Her. She's Gonna Be Around For... Ever. I Just... Have You Seen The Way She Looks At Him? It's Just So Googly-Eyed. You Mean Kind Of How, Like, You Look At Him? Okay, I Am Not, Nor Have I Ever Been, Googly-Eyed... Over Anyone. Distract Me. Tell Me About The Gps Records. Parris' Car Sat In The Driveway Of Their Napa Home From 11:45 P.M. Till 8:00 A.M. The Next Morning When She And The Kids Drove Back To San Francisco. Damn It. Good News Is I've Nailed Down Time Of Death. Joe Bled Out And Died Around 3:00 A.M. It'd Be So Nice If We Had A Suspect. What About Maurice? I Thought You Hadn't Ruled Him Out. No, I Haven't. I Actually Got Somebody Following Up On That. Maurice Jackson? Cindy Thomas, "San Francisco Register." How'd You Get In Here? I Sort Of Snuck In. I'm Doing A Piece On The Stadium's Ground Crew For The Metro Section. Hey, Just Five Pain-Free Minutes, And Then You Can Go About Your Day. I Can Be Happy Knowing That I Got To Talk To The Guy Who Led Texas Back From An 18-Point Halftime Deficit In The Bowl Game Of-- What Are You, Like Rain Man Or Something? It Was Just Pretty Hard To Forget. Uh, So About The Ground Crew, Just One Quote? You Expect Me To Believe That On The Day Joe Donovan Dies, The "Register" Wants To Do A Piece On The Stadium's Ground Crew? You Want To Ask Me About Joe? Just Be Straight. How's This For Straight? My Dad Died 18 Months Ago. He Loved Joe Donovan. I Loved My Dad. We Used To Watch Every Game Together. Now I Watch For Us Both. Every Game? I Could Tell You Every Stat, Every Injury You Or Joe Ever Had. (Chuckles) Joe's Would Be A Long List.</I> Off The Record, I Swear... I Don't Know, It's Just-- It's Weird To Think About Joe As Regular Flesh And Blood. Yeah, Joe Was Human, All Right. He Was 35. He Had Numbness, Pins And Needles... And Dr. Boyd Let Him Play? Seriously, Off The Record, One Fan To Another. Look... They Had Blowups About This All The Time. Would Be Fighting About It Today If Joe Was Here. I Don't Want To See That In Print. Not A Chance. Hey, Take Care Of Yourself Out There. I'll Be Fine, Rain Man. You Came To Check On Me. I Couldn't Stand Not Knowing How You Were. How'd It Go? Um, The Plaintiff's Lawyers Are--Are Threatening Criminal Charges. Crimal? Where's The Intent To Harm Or--Or Blatant Indifference? The Parents Said That, Uh, That I Didn't Listen. They Said That, Uh, That They Told Me That It Could've Been Vitamins. I Thought They Said Crayons. I Was Just Coming Off A 24-Hour Shift. They Were Yelling In Spanish. I Thought I Understood 'Em. I Don't Know. Maybe I Should've Gotten A Translator Or-- No, No, Hey. It Sounds Like A Negotiation Ploy. Okay, Just Don't Let Them Settle, Especially If It Means Admitting Guilt. Yeah, Well, It's The Hospital's Lawyer, So I Don't Have Much Of A Say In This. If They Bring Me Up On Criminal Charges, My Career Is Over. Even If I'm Acquitted, I'm Done. Let's Not Go There Just Yet. Don't You Think We Should've Called First? It's Called The Element Of Surprise. Plus, My Source Said That Dr. Boyd Likes To Keep Late Hours. So You're Thinking The Team Doctor Offed The Star Q.B. Because He Was Gonna Rat Him Out For Overmedicating His Players? Yeah, It's Possible. And I've Been Doing Research On The Game. Team Doctor's Don't Have The Best Reputations For Putting Their Players' Health First. Dr. Boyd? It's Insctors Boxer And Jacobi From The San Francisco Police Department. Could We Have A Moment Of Your Time, Please? (Clattering) Dr. Boyd, Are You In There? Stop! (Jacobi) I Said Halt! Stop! Oh, Come On. (Grunts) Drew Kaplan. Oh, This Time, It Is All About You.</I> My Partner Is Irritated You Made Us Run. I Don't Like Running. I Was Scared. It Was Dark. You Know, The League's Not Goa Look Too Kindly On An Agent Trying To Steal Team Health Records. Well, I Didn't Steal Team Records. Right, Just Joe's. I Was Just Trying To Protect My Client. Your Client Or Yourself, Ms. Kaplan? This So Doesn't Look Good For You. I Didn't Kill Joe.</I> I Am Just Trying To Contain The Ridiculous Rumors. "The Bench Report" Wrote That They Found Steroids In Joe's System. "The Bench Report"? It's A Sports Blog. Yeah, If Mainstream Press Got Ahold Of That... I Had To Make Sure There Was Nothing In These Files That Could Hurt Joe's Reputation. As His Agent, I Have A Responsibility To Ensure That His Memorabilia And Licensing Earning Potential Doesn't Fade. Yes, You Wouldn't Want Something Like Death To Get In The Way Of A Little Money. Especially When 10% Of $10 Million Has Already Been Thrown Out The Door. I Owed It To Joe's Children. Well, It's Nice To Know That There Are Still Some Selfless People In This World, Ms. Kaplan. Thank You, Inspector Boxer. You Think She's Guilty? Yeah, Of Being A Greedy, Conniving Agent.</I> She Also Stood To Profit More From Joe Being Alive Than Dead, So I Don't Tnk She Killed Him. Well, I'm Gonna Send A Uni Back Out To Pacific Estates. A Couple Of Those Houses Haven't Released Their Security Tapes. Okay. Meanwhile, Let's Talk To Dr. Boyd. Hey, Lindsay. Hey, I Was Hoping I'd Run Into You. (Jacobi) I'll, Uh, Start Without You. Can We Talk? Here? Now? I Was Thinking The, Uh, Break Room. Uh, We Are In The Middle Of A Very Important Case, So... Please, Lindsay. Just One Minute. Okay. (Sighs) Okay, This Is Really Awkward For Me. I'm Not Really Sure Where To Start. Uh, If You Need More Time, We Can Do This Later. No. I Can Do This. I'm Sorry. Excuse Me? I'm Sorry. For What? Sit. Cookie? (Sighs) When We First Met-- That Day In Tom's Office-- I Tried To Play It So Cool, Like I Could Care Less That Tom Was Working With His Ex-Wife Again, But Truthfully, The Whole Thing Terrified Me. I Mean, What If He Realized He Still Loved You Or Something? No, He Doesn't. No, I Know. It's Stupid. And Then When You Walked In On Us-- The Thing With The Italian Shirt? Mm, I Barely Remember That. I Was Happy, Like I Felt Like I Was Staking My Claim Or Something. It's So Juvenile. It's Understandable. And Then Yesterday You Were So Cute With The Kids. Can You Forgive Me? Yes. Yes, I Can. Thanks. Oh. Yeah. Oh, Tom Always Said I'd Like You If I Just Gave It A Chance. Well, You Seem Nervous, Dr. Boyd. Anything You Want To Ask Me Is Covered Under Doctor-Patient Confidentiality. So You Don't Care That People Are Starting To Say That You Were Feeding Joe Steroids? For Medicinal Purposes Only, To Bringown Swelling. What About Painkillers? Seems To Me That Was To Keep Him Going, Even When His Body Said No. Isn't There A Policy Against Overmedicating Athletes? I Never Once Overmedicated Joe. Well, Joe Admitted As Much When He Got The D.U.I. Three Years Ago. It's Always The Doctors Who Take The Fall, Isn't It? When The Evidence Points In That Direction, Yes. You Know What? Joe Is Dead. I Don't Need To Protect Him Anymore. Joe Didn't Pop Too Many Pills The Day He Got That D.U.I. He Had A Seizure Due To A T.B.I. He Suffered In A Game Two Weeks Prior. Drove Off The Road, Crashed Into A Tree. He's Lucky No One Got Hurt. T.B.I.-- Traumatic Brain Injury. Joe Asked Me To Hide The Seizure So He Could Continue To Play. I Tried To Talk Him Out Of It, But He Wouldn't Listen. Football-- That Was Everything To Him. (Cindy) How Big Of A Piece Do You Need? Not Much. Oh! Brains Belong Inside The Head. Sorry. So Jacobi Talked To Dr. Boyd. Joe Was Neither Drunk Nor On Drugs When He Got His D.U.I. Three Years Ago. So What, He Was High On Life? He Had A Seizure. It Was A Lingering Side Effect Of T.B.I.-- Traumatic Brain Injury. I'm Learning Football Terms. Doesn't T.B.I. Go Along With What Maurice Told Cindy About Joe-- Numbness And Tingling? I Went Back To Watch The Fight Between Joe And Maurice To See If There Was Anything We Missed, And There's--There's Nothing That Points To Maurice, But I Was Able To Play Around With The Video And Zoom In A Little Bit, And I Swear, Right Before The Fit Starts, Joe's Hands Start Shaking Like He Lost Control. (Claire) Okay, You Know How We Couldn't Identify One Of The Drugs In Joe's System? Well, The Results Came Back. It Was Rasagiline. (Lindsay) I've Never Heard Of It. It's Not Exactly In My Wheelhouse Either. Rasagiline... Is A Therapeutic Drug Approved Last Year By The F.D.A. Well, What Does It Treat? That's What I Wanted To Confirm. Joe Donovan's Substantia Nigra Cells Were Dying Off, And The Ones That Were Left Are Abnormal. English, Please. Joe Donovan Had Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's Is A Degenerative Disease. Joe Could've Lived For Years. I Mean, As An Athlete, The Thought Of Losing Control Of His Body... I Don't Know, Maybe Joe Did Want To Check Out. Joe Wasn't A Quitter. (Laughs) If I Didn't Know Any Better, I'd Say You Respected The Guy. Well, I May Even Watch A Game One Of These Days. You Remember The Donovans' Nanny? You Mean Three Nannies? No, Julie Gits--The One Who Was Corralling Parris The Morning Joe Died. Yeah. Well, She Was Supposed To Be In Napa, But Her Car Drove Back Into Pacific Estates At 1:30 A.M., Anshe Exited Little More Than Two Hours Later. Okay, You Wrangle The Nanny. I Will Sweet-Talk The Tech Guys Into Jumping Our Little Video Enhancement Program To The Front Of The Line. There You Go. (Lindsay) Hey, We Got The Nanny On Videotape. Heather Said That She Ran Into You. Yeah. She Was Dropping Off Cookies. Did--Did She Seem Weird? Did She... (Clears Throat) Actually, She Apologized... To Me. How's That For Irony? Whew. Look, Linz, Heather Can Never Know About This. Well, That-- That's Your Call. It Was A Mistake-- Onetime Thing, Never Happen Again. Hey, You Showed Up On My Doorstep. Hi. The Techs Are Still Working On The Video. Keep Your Fingers Crossed. What, Is She In There? Yeah, But Listen, If I-- I Think I Can Handle The Nanny. What The... I Tried To Warn You. The Girl Is A Faucet. Did She Say Anything? Oh, Lots. Let's See, She, Uh, Stole A Candy Bar When She Was 12. She Once Played Sick To Go To A White Stripes Concert. She Borrowed One Of Mrs. Donovan's Dresses Without Her Permission-- Did She Say Anything About Joe Donovan's Murder? Well, Not Yet. We Only Made It Through Spring '06. Do We Have Any Soothing Chamomile Tea Lying Around? (Crying) It's Okay. We Can Keep Going. I Promise. This Many Tears... You Know, Someone Might Look At That As A Sign Of Remorse. You Want To Tell Us What You're Sorry About? I--It's The Kids. I Think About Them Not Having Their Dad. (Jacobi) And You Feel Responsible? He Was A Great Guy. Okay. Uh, Why Don't You Tell Us A Little More About Joe? A Lot Of Players, You Know, They Don't Want To Be Role Models. But Joe To It Really Seriously. He Said He Had A Reason To Stand Up And Be Counted. "Stand Up And Be Counted," Those Were His Exact Words? Why? (Lindsay) Hey. Um, Mrs. Donovan, I Am Afraid That I Have Some Really Upsetting News. Your Nanny--Julie-- Drove Into Pacific Estates At 1:30 A.M. The Night That Joe Was Killed. Julie? She Was In Napa. What--What Are You Saying? Your Husband And Julie Had More Than An Employer-Employee Relationship. That's Not Possible. We Think That Julie Drove To Your House That Night To Have... Some Sort Of Rendezvous With Joe, And Something Went Horribly Awry. My Husband Would Never Cheat On Me. I Know That This Is A Lot To Take In, But If You'll Just Hear Me Out, Please. Go Ahead. But This Whole Cheating Thing Is Crazy. We've Discovered That Julie Regularly Picked Up A Prescription For Rasagiline. The Prescription Was In Your Son Johnny's Name, But It Was Really For Joe. Rasagiline Is A Drug That Is Used To Treat Parkinson's Disease. It Seems That The Only Person That He Trusted With That Information Was Julie. No, I Was The One Who Talked Our Family Doctor Into Putting The Prescription In Our Son's Name. So... You Knew Joe Had Parkinson's? Of Course I Did. I Was His Wife. Joe Wanted To Keep Playing, But The League Never Would've Let Him If They Had Known. It Was My Duty To Make It Happen. I Should Get Home And Be With My Boys. They're Gonna Be Devastated. Julie Was Family. Of Course. Just One More Thing-- The Press Conference That Was Scheduled For Tomorrow? What About It? He Was Gonna Announce His New Contract. I Think He Was Going To Announce To The World That He Had Parkinson's. Joe Wanted To Stand Up And Be Counted. That's The Kind Of Man That He Wa Wasn't He? Wait, Uh, I'm Sorry. There Is One More Thing That We Should Discuss. What? Your Confession. Have A Seat. Well, The Good News Is Joe Wasn't Cheating On You.</I> I Told You That. But He Did Share A Lot With Julie... At Night, When She Was Up With Your Kids And You Were Knocked Out On Sleeping Pills. For Example, Joe Told Her That He Was Afraid You Wouldn't Stick With Him Once Things Got Rough. Joe Was Still In Great Shape. He Was Working Out Harder Than Ever. I Know. His Stats Actually Went Up This Year... Six Years, I Try To Get Her To Watch Football. One Dead Body, Suddenly She's An Expert On The Game. "Expert" Might Be Too Strong A Word. She Still Hasn't Figured Out That Once You're Benched And A New Starter's Been Named, You Might On Occasion Make It Back Into The Game, But, Uh It's Probably Better If You Move On To A New Team. Sooner Or Later, You Were Gonna Have To Take Care Of Him In All Sorts Of Unglamorous Ways, And You Just Didn't Sign Up For That. If You Didn't Get Out Now, Before He Became A Public Spokesperson For His Illness, Well, Then When Could You? I Mean, Come On, Grieving Widow... Heartless Bitch Who Left Her Sick Husband. You Yourself Said That You Have Julie's Car Driving Into The Neighborhood. Julie's, Not Mine. I Think With A Little Video Enhancement We'll Be Able To See That That's You Behind The Wheel, Not Julie. I've Been Thinking A Lot About Something Lately--</I> (Sighs) Mistakes... Some Of 'Em You Can Get Past.</I> They'll Eat You Alive For A While,</I> But... Eventually They Just Fade Away.</I> Murder... Is Not One Of Those Mistakes. This Is The Knife We Found Next To Joe's Body. It Has A Little Imprint On The Handle. You Can Hardly See It, But Goshen Catering Puts Those On Their Knives As An Identifier So They Can Distinguish Their Knives From Their Clients. Well, We Must Have Used Them For Some Other Event. They--They Left It At The House. Goshen Catering Worked The Charity Dinner That You Attended The Night That Joe Died. Their Inventory List Says That This Is The Knife They're Missing. Well, Anybody At That Party Could've Taken It. They--</I> You Stole The Knife, You Took Julie's Car And You Drove Home To Surprise Joe With A Nightcap. And You Know What? He Was Probably Happy To See You. You Poured Him A Spiked Drink, And When He Was Too Weak To Fight Back, You Slit His Wrists. You Killed Your Children's Father, Parris. You Confess Now, At Least They'll Know You're Sorry. I Want My Lawyer. Now. Okay. Just To Be Clear, You Are Going To Jail For The Rest Of Your Life. When A Judge Sees This Evidence And Hears That You Didn't Confess, He Will Have About As Much Sympathy For You As You Had For Your Husband. What'd You Do To My Son? Me? What? Nothing. He Seems To Be A Little Bit In Love With You. We Bonded. Well, Where Is Everybody? What Happened To Celebration Mojitos? Jill Had Dinner Plans, And Lindsay Disappeared Once Parris Was Booked. What's Gonna Happen To The Donovan Boys? Moving To Orlando. At Least They'll Be With Family. So You Know How I... Totally Won Maurice's Trust With My Doe-Eyed Charm And Razor-Sharp Knowdge Of Sports Stats? Mm-Hmm. He Sent Over Two Box Tickets To Sunday's Game. Isn't Accepting Gifts Against Newspaper Policy? I Thought About That, But I Don't Really Cover Sports, So I Don't See It As A Conflict Of Interest. Nice Rationalization There, Skipper. You'll Think So, Too, When I Tell You That I, Um... I Want To Give The Tickets To Nate And Ed. You Know, Fathers, Sons, Football--It's A Thing. So Now My Husband's Gonna Be In Love With You, Too. Oh, I'm Glad You're Here. They're Holding A Table For Two Off In The Corner-- Nice Mood Lighting-- And It Is Perfect. It's One Seat Short. Luke's Joining Us. A Threesome. How Sassy. He's In Trouble. The Hospital Is Trying To Throw Him Under The Bus, And He Needs The Best Lawyer In San Francisco. That's You. This Is True, But As You Pointed Out, I Can't Take On Private Clients. And As You Pointed Out, You Can Give Free Advice. In This Case, You Can Be Puppet Master To The Hospital Lawyer's Strings. Luke Has No Idea How Bad This Is, And I Don't Want Him To Know. By The Way, You And Me? Never Happened. If That's How You Want To Play It. I'm Trusting You With The Man I Love. Can You Believe I Found Parking Right Around The Corner? A San Francisco Miracle. Hey, Man. Hi. Hanson North, Meet Luke Ben. Nice To Meet You. Well, Let's Go Get That Table. Sure. Can You Help A Man Out? I Thought You Left. I Needed A Drinking Partner. You Don't Have To Cheer Me Up, Jacobi.
