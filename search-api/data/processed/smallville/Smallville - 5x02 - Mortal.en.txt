The board of directors will ask questions, Mr. Luthor. For what I'm paying you, doctor, I'm sure you can buy some answers. Keep him isolated. Twenty-four-hour surveillance. Notify me immediately if there's any change in his condition. Hey! Sorry about that, Mr. Luthor. Yeah, my bad. You're good at making friends, aren't you, Lee? I guess I'm just a people person. Hey, he... He's out! Can I light up a room or what! Get your hands up. Get your hands up. Time to do your thing, boys. Go, go. Stop! Freeze! - What's going on? - Let's blow this joint. - Where to... - Now, boss? Smallville. Okay, pull! Steady! - Steady up! Pull! - Left side. Come on! Steady! - Pull! - Okay. That's good. Pull! Almost there! Okay, brace it. - It's good? - It's great. It's a lot heavier than I remember. You're just gonna have to learn to pace yourself. You're only human now, remember? Martha! The joys of manual labor. It's not so bad. I kind of like being sore. Makes me feel like I accomplished something. No pain, no gain, right? Well, being a mere mortal does have its drawbacks. Are you all right? Are you sure this is what you really want? It's what I've always wanted. I was talking about you, Clark, not your feelings for Lana. I mean, one day I find out my best friend's an <i>alien...</i> ...and then the next day, presto change-o... ...he's just your average Kansas farm boy. Excuse me if I'm finding this a little hard to accept. Well, you're gonna have to just get used to it. This is who I am now. Clark, with all that you were able to do... ...I just can't help but thinking that your destiny is more... ...than just milking cows and raising barns. Destiny is another word for no choice. Okay. What about alien Ken and Barbie? - They tore apart Smallville looking for... - They were looking for Kal-EI. They're gone, and so is he. Just let it go, Chloe. - Here you go. - Thank you. I've never been so thirsty. It's incredible, isn't it, how the entire town gets together to rebuild Smallville. Thanks to Lex. If he hadn't pulled those strings at FEMA... - ...we'd still be waiting for relief money. - Yeah, he's a real hero. Hey, Clark? We're getting low on nails. - Can you run to the farm and grab some? - Yeah. - I'll come with you. - Yeah. The happy couple. Sneaking off while there's work to be done? Supply run. - I'll wait for you. - Okay. I get the feeling I'm not her favorite person. She doesn't trust you. I'm sure you're used to that kind of reaction from people by now. Look, clark, we've all made mistakes. That's in the past. For whatever reason, we've been given a second chance. I hope we can rebuild more than just the town. So do I. I can't believe a second meteor shower hit Smallville. Like the first, when we were kids, wasn't bad enough. Maybe this time it's different. Maybe it's not the end of something but the beginning, a second chance. Clark, there are so many things that I haven't told you. Things that I've done. Whatever we've both done, it's in the past now. The past can't hurt us anymore. You're right. No more crystals or spaceships or meteor showers. Sounds good to me. - This will only take a second. - No hurry. I think I need a break anyway. Found them. You know, sometimes taking your time isn't a bad idea. Sorry. It's okay. We should probably be heading back anyway. You're right. We should probably be heading back. Everyone's waiting for us at the barn raising. Which means we're all alone. Wait, we should... We should take this slow. Clark, we've been taking it slow for four years now. I know. It's <i>just...</i> ...I want our first time... ...to be as special as you are. It's... It's my first time. It's mine too. - You and Jason never...? - No. No. You and Alicia...? No. You're the only one I've ever really loved. It's only been you, Lana. My parents. Hey, Mom. Dad! We were just... We were just... Clark! Pretty girl. I approve. - What do you want? - What every freak in Belle Reve wants. You! Get in there! - Sit down. - Lana. - Stop it! - Stop? Fun's just getting started, baby girl. Clark, what's going on? Who are they? - I don't know. - Oh, but we know you. You're a legend in Belle Reve. Half the freaks are there because of you. What is he talking about? - You got the wrong guy. - Oh, yeah? Well, maybe sweetmeat here knows where I can find the right one. No. Clark! Boy, you do not wanna be pissing me off! - Strange. - He does not seem... What we expected. I told you, you got the wrong guy. Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to kill you. Or maybe I should start with your little girlfriend. All right, Clark. As long as you're happy with who you are. Happiness is such an elusive creature, isn't it? We all wish for it, but very few ever really find it. Doesn't make the search less important. Or the destination. You remember the last time we stood here together? I ended up unconscious on the ground... ...and you somehow landed in the Arctic. - I don't remember what happened. - Then why have you been avoiding me? It's been weeks since I brought you back from the hospital in Yukon. - I've been busy, Lex. - Right. I heard being a third wheel is very time-consuming. Clark and Lana are finally together. They're happy. That's all that should matter to a friend. I think you know more than you're telling <i>me...</i> ...about what happened to you in this cave, about clark's involvement. You think you're a friend, but you're playing a dangerous game. Like covering up the spaceship Lana said crashed during the meteor shower? Lana was hysterical. She didn't see what she thought. Well, maybe you didn't either, Lex. Stop asking me questions or I will start asking my own. Level 3? So you've heard of it? Yeah. It's supposed to be a top-secret research facility at LuthorCorp. Everybody thinks it's just a myth. Spending a couple weeks in there can make it real. You've been in Level 3? Oh, yeah, I had a real nice stay: Gourmet food, satellite TV... ...and a nifty green cocktail shot in my neck three times a day. - They were experimenting on you? - Trying to amp up what we could do. And it worked. Then one morning I woke up in Belle Reve. No more satellite TV, no more green cocktails. Got you hooked and cut you off. We all got our cross to bear, and this is yours: You're gonna break into Level 3, you're gonna get that <i>serum...</i> ...otherwise you're gonna play all by your Ionesome. What do you need me for? I've seen what you can do. - Just go and get it yourself. - They got defense systems... ...to keep people like me out. But if the stories I hear about you in Belle Reve are true... ...you shouldn't have any problem. Looks like we got ourselves some company. Clark better have an excuse for not bringing those nails. I'm sure he does. Clark? Clark, we sent you after those nails hours ago. - What happened? - I got sidetracked. Where's Lana? She's not feeling well. She's lying down. Why is your shirt on inside out? - I think I'll go check on Lana. - No! Wait! You never believe me! Why are you all over me? - Can't you back off for five minutes? - Clark Kent. What's gotten into you? Yeah, boy! That ain't no way to talk to your mama. - What's going on here, clark? - Pipe down, old man. Listen, fella, I don't know who the hell you think you're talking to... Stop! Just stop. I'll do what you want. Don't hurt anyone. Smart move, farm boy. You got two hours to get back here with the serum... ...or I'm gonna fire me up a family barbecue. All I know is the serum is in a vault somewhere in there on Level 3. What about Lex? I mean, if we just told him what was going on... No, I called. He's en route to Washington. It's up to us. We gotta get in. Well, I'm always up for a little Mission: Impossible. Okay, so this is where your nut job said he was experimented in? - Yeah. - According to records... ...this section of LuthorCorp was closed a year ago. Turned into storage. Great cover if you don't want <i>anyone...</i> - <i>...to</i> know what you're up to. - Exactly what I thought. Now, I couldn't pull up anything called "Top Secret Evil Lab" on the schematics. But I did find this. Or, more accurately, didn't. - Level 3. - Guess someone forgot to pencil that in. What? I like to come prepared. - Chloe, where'd you get all this stuff? - EBay. Hey. Is that a flash-bang grenade? Careful! It was a graduation present from Lois. I'm saving it for a special occasion. Why didn't you tell me about this stuff? We all have our secrets, Clark. Relax. We still got a couple of minutes before the guards swing back around. - You sure this is gonna work? - You got a better plan? Well, normally I'd just rip open the door, then super-speed past the cameras... ...and somehow open the vault with my heat vision. So you're saying now that you're human, you have no useful skills? - Not so much. - Great. Finally land my own superhero and this is what I get. But we don't need superpowers for this. Get the door open and then access the cameras. Then loop the hallway over and over. - And then I'Il... - Clark. That kind of electronic hocus-pocus is gonna take hours to rig up. Sometimes it's easier if you <i>just...</i> ...turn off the power. Looks like the kid went and called the law. - He doesn't love you much. - Clark wouldn't go to the police. - It's just routine. - Yeah, well, too bad for her then. We'll get rid of her. Don't freak out. Baby, you'll know when I freak out. Get rid of the sheriff or your wife's toast. Martha. Just a second. - Sheriff. - I'm sorry to trouble you <i>folks...</i> ...but three real mean cusses busted out of Belle Reve last night. Put guards in the hospital... ...and we found the car they stole up the road. - We'll keep our eyes open. - Yeah, you be sure and do that. Where's the missus? She's still at the barn raising. I was just there, I didn't see her. Well, make sure she knows what's going on when she turns up. I sure will. Thank you. Wait a minute. Is that coffee I smell? We're running out of time. - There's gotta be another way. - Clark, there isn't. The only direct access to Level 3... ...is through a magnetically sealed door with power backup. You have to get in through the vents and unlock the mag-Iocks from inside. How much further? According to the diagram... ...you should be getting close to an exhaust port right above no man's land. Take your next left. Come on, Clark, left. - I'm going in circles. - No, you're not. It just feels that way because you're in a confined space with no visual markers. This is impossible. It's a million degrees in here. Gosh, I didn't realize super-whining was one of your powers. Pete was a lot better at pep talks in these situations. Pete? You told Pete your secret? I kind of had to. He saw my ship. Pete got to see your spaceship? What was that? Oh, no. You tripped some sort of lockdown protocol. What? - Well, what do I do? - Go. Go, go, go. Make a left. Clark, I said left. Go, Clark. Hurry. Hurry. Clark? Clark, are you all right? Clark? Clark, are you okay? Yeah. Super. Good coffee, Mr. Kent. Thank you, sheriff. You mind if I finish my chores while there's still some daylight? Oh, right. Yeah, I should get going myself. Thanks for the coffee. Wouldn't think a man with your heart condition... ...would take to smoking, Mr. Kent. Oh, those are mine, sheriff. You know, I started after the meteor shower. Nerves. Nasty habit, Miss Lang. You ought to quit before they kill you. Thanks again for the hospitality. I'll let myself out. All units. We got a 10-11 out at the Kent farm. - I repeat, a 10-11 out at Kent farm. - Oh, sheriff. Mr. Kent! - That really... - Hurt! Get the field up! Get down. Check him out! Well, ain't this a right pickle. Clark, how's it going? Well, I'm not really crazy about heights. Okay. Chloe, what am I looking for? Okay, just a really big door. Big door. Big door. - Got it. - <i>Okay.</i> Now look for the manual override switch. Good work. You didn't have any trouble with guards. No, it was weird actually. It was like they were only guarding the perimeter outside. Can you get us in? No. The locking mechanism's controlled by fingerprint access. There's gotta be a way to bypass it. Maybe if I had, like, a week, or Lex's thumb... Lex's thumbprint. What? What the hell is this, sheriff? Another day in Smallville. - We cannot... - Maintain the field. Finishing each other's sentences is really starting to grate on me. - We need... - The serum. You ain't the only ones. You keep that field up, all right? We're almost home. - Perhaps we should... - Cut... - Our losses. - No! No! We're gonna stick to the plan, wait for the Kent boy to get back... ...and then we're off the hook. So you guys shut up, and you concentrate. Is it just me, or are they starting to look desperate? Don't worry, Mrs. Kent. Clark will figure a way to get us out of this. He always does. - Is that gonna do it? - It better, it's our last clean print. All right, hand me the tape. Thank you. Hello? Time's up, bright boy. I want my stuff. - I got it. I'm on my way. - You better be. Who needs superpowers with you around? Clark. He's got a couple of minutes, and then I'm gonna start killing me some people. Starting with you, Mom. Can you disrupt the signal? Might shut the grid down. I could try, but that could take hours. Chloe, I already told him I had the serum. - Call. See if he can give you more time. - He's not a "more time" guy. We don't have a choice. You can't just walk in. Without your abilities, the lasers will cut you to pieces. There might be one other way. - Find where the signal's coming from. - What are you gonna do? Whatever it takes. - Sheriff! - Hey, hey. - Sheriff! - Let him through! - What do you think you're doing? - I'm trying to save my parents and Lana. Please, pull your men back. Last time I checked, I was wearing the badge and barking orders. - I can stop this. - This is not the time to be a hero. I'm not! Look, I'm just a normal guy that doesn't wanna see everyone he loves die. Please, sheriff, you have to trust me, I can do this. Even if I lost all sense and I gave you the okay... ...there is some kind of invisible barrier or whatnot around the whole place. How do you plan to get past that? With this. Nice and easy. I'm feeling kind of twitchy. - Get the force field down! - He did it. Look, shut up. He ain't done nothing yet. All right, get the field back up. Get it up! Get it up! - Starting to wonder if you forgot us. - Everything's gonna be okay. Ain't nothing okay till I say so. They really did a job on you at Luthorcorp, didn't they? Look, they made me more than I was. I didn't ask for <i>it...</i> ...but the power grows on you really fast. I guess all the talk about you is true, kid. - You really are out of this world. - You have no idea. God! Oh, God! You little son of a... Sometimes it's easier just to turn the power off. - Get him out of here. - Let's go. Keep moving, Sparky. That guy has some serious issues. Let's hope Belle Reve can hold him this time. Or you can always knock his lights out again. Or call the authorities before you hatch another harebrained rescue scheme. Sorry, sheriff. That aside, nice work, Mr. Kent. You ever consider a career in law enforcement? She's right, clark. What you did was amazing. Hi. Hey. - Give us a second? - Of course. Breaking news: Clark Kent saves the day. - Yeah, thanks to you. - Yeah, well, I just did what I usually do. You're the one that took down three meteor freaks without any... ...special advantages. - Then again, once a hero, always a hero. - No. It's a one-time thing. I'm done with all that now. Clark, you may have moved on... ...but people are not gonna let go... - We talked about this. I'm not the one you should worry about. I traced the signal I picked up in the vault. I found a secondary video feed hidden in the frequency. Someone was watching us. - This isn't possible. - Disappointed? Clark. I heard. Is everyone all right? - What are you doing? - What I should've done a long time ago. Chloe traced the video feed from Level 3. You were watching us the whole time. I don't know what you're talking about. She pulled records from Belle Reve. You were there the day those psychos escaped. And you helped them somehow, didn't you? What did you promise them, Lex? Serum to last the rest of their lives? - You're being irrational. - This whole thing was a setup, a test! And to do it, you put Lana and my family in danger. - Clark... - No! I thought we could start over, Lex. But you're too obsessed with the past, with me. But I'm different now, and I'm through playing games with you. You wanna test me? Wanna see what I'm really made of? Do it yourself, coward. Satisfied? Clark. What happened? Had to say goodbye to an old friend. Have you ever heard of a handshake? Come here. All right. Sorry. God, you're a mess. After everything that's <i>happened...</i> ...I thought I knew what my life would be like now. I thought... ...it would be easier. But I guess you can never be certain what's gonna happen <i>tomorrow...</i> ...can you? No. No, you can't. Subtitles by
