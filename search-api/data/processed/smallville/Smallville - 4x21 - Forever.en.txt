that 4 years has gone by this fast? There you go. Ok. "To Brendan. A photographer who could... always capture the moment". Thanks. Sure. I gotta run. See ya. Hi. Hi. See ya at lunch. Hello? Hello? Is anyone in here? Hello? Haley? Oh, thank God, I don't know what's going on, but I think we're the only two people in... Oh my God! What going on? Help! Help me! Help! 4x21 Forever He's obvious been thinking about this for a while. You have to let him make his own decisions, Jonathan. Hey. You mind telling me why you have a financial aid... package for Central Kansas? That's where I'm going to college. What happened to Met. U.? What happened to Ohio, what happened to Miami? I thought I'd stay closer to home. Clark... I know starting over with new friends... in a new city can seem overwhelming, but... you can't let that hold you back. This is one of the most important decisions... you going to make in your entire life. You don't think I know that? Does Lana happen to be going to Central Kansas? I don't know where Lana's going to school, so no.. this is not about Lana. Oh, so it's about us. You don't think I can run this farm without your help. This is where I'm needed. Clark, your destiny lies far beyond... those corn fields out there. And I'm not about to let you turn your back on that... just because of us. Now I've got a farm to run. Clark? Is that really the reason? Those tests, was really hard... I know, I had formally badly in that.. Lisa, Delia. Do you guys know what's going on? You better hurry Chloe, or you're going to be late for Trig. Wait, Trig? Guys, there's no classrooms behind these doors! Just play along. He's watching. Brendan, wait! Don't let the door shut behind you.. What are you doing!? Are you playing along too? Playing along? Chloe, I planned it all. You brought us here? Just because it's the last day of school, doesn't mean it can't last forever. Brendan, you're not serious. Why would you wanna stay stuck in high school... when there's so much else out there. I thought you of all people would understand. You're the editor of the torch, prom queen, Chloe, you had everything in high school. Once you leave, all that's going to be left... is a lifetime of disappointments. But not in here. Brendan, you cannot keep us here forever. You have to move on. To what? Look Chloe, some of us didn't get into our dream colleges like you. When you're staring at a pile of rejection letters, moving on really means... working at a local video store for the rest of your life. Oh how can you be sure the rest of us... are going to go along with this? Wendell? Wendell. Come here. I said come here! I didn't do anything, I swear. Chloe was just wondering what happens... when we don't play along... No. No, please. Wendell. No I didn't... It's best if you realize... how much better off you are here, Chloe I'll save a seat for you at lunch. What do you think? I think it's finally starting to hit me. It's truly over, isn't it? You know I remember walking through those doors... the first day of freshman year. Actually, I think you tripped. Well I couldn't help it, you made me nervous. It was cute. Who knew you'd turn into this... big high school football star. Former, football star... who's gotten used to seeing you... every morning at the lockers. But I guess that's all going to change... now that you're going off to college. Well, I don't know if I'm going to go. Really? I mean, what do you mean, you're the one that's always dreamt of leaving this town, ever since you were a little girl. I know, it's just that right now I feel I've been making... that decision because... it's what everyone expects us to do. If I go, I want to make that choice... for the right reasons. So you're staying. In Smallville. I don't know. I think it would be really hard... with all of you guys gone. Will not all of us will be gone. I'm thinking of commuting to Central Kansas. Then maybe I won't have to spend any more time... trying to figure out how to say goodbye. Wendall Johnson! Chloe Sullivan! Haley Timmins! Delia Watkins! I would've thought Chloe would be the first one in line. LuthorCorp is the legal conservator of the cave, we can do any excavation work we want down there. I'll have to call you back. I thought we had concluded our business. Almost.. Clark was going to take care of that tonight. It's nothing I can't handle by myself. I know what you're doing Jonathan. You can't take the place of Clark on this farm, no one can. Every other farm in the county has... at least five hands to help out. Sweetheart, my family managed to run this farm for generations... before Clark came around. I see no reason why I can't run it by myself. Sometimes I wonder which one of you is more stubborn. Why don't I give you a clue? When are you going to admit that the truth is... you and I can't run this place alone? Martha, what exactly is it that you want me to do? You want me to tell our teenage son... that we can't possibly survive around here without him? What kind of parents would that make us? Honest ones. How many times has he asked... be treated like it to an adult? This decision took a lot of maturity. Or guilt. Martha, Clark still feels responsible... for my heart problems. I'm not going to allow him to do this... out of pity. It's not pity, Jonathan. Clark knows that if he leaves... he can only come back a few times a year. And he doesn't want one of those times... to be your funeral. Chloe? I don't know if Met. U.'s ready... for the wall of weird. She didn't get the Torch out today. Maybe the printers aren't working. No. It's not even in its final format. There's no way that Chloe would... let the last day of school... go by without giving her final word. And when was the last time that Chloe... pulled an all-nighter with a deadline, didn't finish her latte? Or leave without her lifeline? I guess I should have trusted my instincts. I knew you were working with Jason. Judging from the fact that... 10 minutes ago I lost all... feeling in my hands, you have a very curious... definition of... collaboration, Lex. Genevieve! and the dutiful son. The Oedipal bond sure has a way of... flourishing when it's fed, doesn't it Lex? Lionel, the stones may be just another hobby for you... but I didn't search all these years... just to reach a stalemate... You're making a big mistake Jason. I know she's your mother but... don't think for a second she won't turn on you. Trust me on this one. Jason. It's okay mother. I don't expect them to understand... the meaning of family loyalty, especially when the only thing running... through the Luthor blood is betrayal. Now we want the stone you stole from us. Yes Lex, your father has one of the stones. And what do you want from me? I have a feeling that he'd sooner die... than give up that stone. But all that might change... if his own flesh and blood... were at stake. You obviously don't know my father as well as I do. I hope for your sake... you're wrong. I've got a couple of cappuccinos... and a double espresso. Where you're.. There we go. Thank you. I'm impressed, "Smallville". Of all the seniors skipping... the last day of school, I didn't expect to see you. I'm on lunch break. Right, right, because why would you do anything... like any other normal teenager in America. The last day of school is a "get out of jail free" card. Even my best employee Haley... flaked on her morning shift. I'm here looking for Chloe, have you seen her? After my 2 A.M. java run to the Torch last night... so that she could make her deadline. I'm guessing she's crashed out somewhere. Lois, she never published the last issue. It's kind of why I think something is going on. Um, Clark? Could you sign my yearbook? Yeah! Is this the girl who didn't show up to work today? "Most Likely to be a Shark's Cheerleader"? Yeah, that's our girl. Thanks. Listen, Wendall, Haley, Chloe, and Delia. They didn't pick up their graduation robes today. Not your "Most Likely to Ditch" crowd, you think something's happened to them? I don't know. Anything seem weird last night when you left Chloe? No, she was just swarming through a pile of photos... with some photographer kid. Hi. Hey, Didn't mean to scare you there. It's ok. Just wondering if you'd sign my yearbook actually. Sure. "Most Likely to be a Cover Girl". I think the photographer... had something to do with this! Thanks. Of course a photograph could never... take the place of the real thing, right? Chloe, You better get to class. The bells going to ring soon. You don't want to be late. I'll be right there. Brendan! What are you two talking about? We were just planning a study session... for Mr. Kramer's quiz. I have a surprise for you. If you ask me, "Most Likely to be a Cover Girl" is selling her short. But at least you'll have a friend in here with you. Chloe, what's going on? Chloe, I'm going to let you tell Lana the rules. Okay! Great! How did I end up back in school? Okay, don't wig out.. We're not in school. Why are you acting like this? He's watching. Brendan, A.K.A., Mr. Medusa's touch, re-created this place. It's kind of like a cage. Gives new meaning to the phrase... "capturing the moment", doesn't it? But how... The last thing I remember... is signing his yearbook. Lana... will you sign my yearbook? Okay. Look at the names. I seriously doubt it's just a coincidence... that the slumber party's guest list... is all on the "most likely to... " page. We have been collected! Hey guys! I told Brendan you had a crush on him... like he wanted me to. What are you guys talking about? Brendan wants high school? We'll give him high school. Where is... the stone? God! Lionel, Lex is your son. And despite what you want him to believe, I know you don't want to watch him die. Jason, darling... Oh, God! Stop! Stop it! Where is it? I gave it to Lana! Lana doesn't know anything about this. You wouldn't have trusted anything that valuable to her. I gave it to her for the same reason... that I gave her that map to the temple. She is the chosen one, and we all know that! Jason... I'll take care of Lana. You promised me you wouldn't hurt her. Has she ever shown any gratitude? Lana has no idea how much... you've been protecting her. And for what? For her to choose Clark over you? You know, I would never betray you the way she has. I wouldn't underestimate her, Genevieve. Don't forget... Lana Lang's ancestor... pledged that she would revenge your family. I would leave folklore in the past if I were you, Lionel. My ancestors burn traitors at the stake. Let's hope you're not one of them. Brendan? He's got to be in here, it's like his second home. Just like Chloe should be at the Torch. This whole "10 Little Indians" thing, it's starting to give me the creeps. Popular guy. Cheerleaders, alternate girls, jocks. Brendan knows everyone. It's sort of like your fast track... to the front page of the torch. That's a little "Norman Bates". It's everyone from the "Most Likely... " list. Lana? Oh God, do you think they're...? No! It seems more like a collection, like he's keeping them somewhere. Lois, check this out. Oh, thanks Clark. It's like they're his paper dolls, or something. Except these blueprints are to scale. Must have rebuilt this part of the school somewhere. Nash Construction. Hey! It's amazing how much material... we have for tomorrow's issue already. Well, I want to make sure you have some great shots... to work with. You know, it's funny. Four years in school together, and I had no idea... that you and Haley were such good friends. Why? What did she tell you? Nothing I didn't suspect already. You know, the more I think about it, the more I can't believe... you re-created this whole place... for all of us. After I got those rejection letters, I realized I spend so much time... proving myself in the end... and none of it mattered on the outside. And we have to do it all again if we left. So, how'd you do it? I told my dad... if he didn't do it, I turned my own annoying step-monster... into his own personal mannequin. You should have seen the look on her face, it was just... Let's go. Please, get us out of here! You shouldn't have tried to get away, Haley. I thought you felt the same way... I did about our future. Brendan, you can't keep us here forever. You have to let us go. I don't think you really want that. I know you'll like it here. Or you'll end up like your friend Haley. I don't blame you for getting caught up in all this Jason. Your mother... she's a difficult woman to resist. Though you were suppose to... get close to Lana but.. What happened, did you... stray a little too far from those apron strings? You know, with all your resources, would've thought by now you'd know that Lana... is nothing more than my mother's pawn. Pawn? Well that's true but, upon you fell in love with. It must be killing you that you've... sacrificed... your feelings for Lana... in exchange for some... maternal warmth... it seems you can't do without. Makes us look like the Waltons, doesn't it? I'm sorry.. Lex, I got you involved in all this. You may not believe me but I, truly wish I were here alone. To be honest dad, I'm glad you're here with me. Now knock that iron out of the fire, and get it as close to my chair as you can. We have to split up. Go! Wait Lex, don't do this, don't do this! Come on, look at me. You and I, we're not that different. It was never about you and me, it was about our parents, please! Lex please! I always knew I had to protect Lana from you! But not as much as you've been protecting... your best friend, huh? Ah.. Clark? Clark doesn't have anything to do with this! Oh you don't believe that. Clark's more connected to this than any of us. You just choose to ignore it. I mean, think about it... the symbols burned into the kid's barn? The fields? It's a little late and obvious to the... shifting the blame in the 11th hour. Why can't you see what's right in front of your face, Lex? It's Clark. He's.. He was... about to kill you, Lex. Or divulge something... you didn't want me to know. Lex, you saved my life back there. I was returning the favor son. I had no choice. I know you have the stone. If anything happens to Lana... you'll be begging for an end like that. How cliché, an abandoned warehouse. Oh great. You know maybe there's another way in... around the corner. Why don't you go check, I'll see if I can find the key for this lock. Keys? I highly doubt they're under the welcome that, but... you knock yourself out. Chloe. Chloe? Brendan. You have to release everybody. I wanted you to be a part of all this Clark. But you guys... you guys had no right coming here! You have to let them go. Things change. No matter how much we don't want them to. We can't live in high school forever. You don't really want that. Clark... think about it. She could stay like this forever. Always be with you. You wouldn't be afraid if she ever left you. I'm not afraid of that, Brendan. You should be. She'll leave you, Clark. She might never come back. If you really care about her, you'll do anything you can to keep her. Let her go! What's... happening...? No! Just... stop! They're going to find out... what it's like to lose someone... forever. No! Clark... Lois! Hey. My God... Wow, I haven't seen you use that... thing in a long time, I thought maybe you'd outgrown it. Dad I think.. I think.. Clark... The time comes in everybody's life... when they realize... their parents aren't going to be around forever. Dad, I... Clark, I just.. I just don't want you sacrificing your potential... because of me. It's not a sacrifice dad, it's a choice. It's a really fine line, don't you think? Dad, I get the feeling we could talk about this all night, and you're still not going to understand. Oh, I understand a whole lot more than you think. Right. That's why you came up here to change my mind. Dad, you raised me to make my own decisions. Why don't you trust me on this? Because you are a lot like me. I have a full ride to Met. U. waiting... for me when I graduated. Problem is, my father needed me on this farm. So I stayed. Dad that's a pretty big footnote to leave out. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want it to weigh you down. As much as I loved my father, I.. a part of me still resents him for needing me that much. I don't want you to feel that. That's not the kind of father I.. I ever wanted to be. Dad. This isn't about the kind of father you are. It's about the kind of son I want to be. Hey. Thank you. So I guess this is it, huh? It's not like we're never going to see each other, right? Yeah, you'll have.. summers and holidays. This sucks! Big time. Suddenly, all those tests and teachers we hated. Seem a lot less scary than the big question mark... that's hanging out there. You'd think after everything that happened to Brendan, it'd be a whole lot easier to say goodbye to all this. There's a lot here to say goodbye to. You know, not to go all "psycho-sympathizer" guys, but I... can't blame Brendan for wanting... to keep everybody together. Although, after that little lock-in... I can't think of anything scarier... than being stuck in the past... and not moving on. Wait a minute, Lana... Did you say I'll have summers and holidays? What about you? I'm staying in Smallville. I thought you said you weren't sure. Don't you wanna see what else is out there? Well that's exactly why I went to Paris last year, but... there's a reason that I was drawn back home. I'm just not sure that I've explored all the possibilities... here. Maybe things won't change much after all...
