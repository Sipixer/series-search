Your friend chloe's gonna be here any minute. Any minute. Thanks for your help,buddy. Shelby? Shelby? what is Shelby? What,boy? You see something I don't? Clark. Earth to superfreak. Everyone,please,sit down. Are you still with us,clark? What's going on? Well,you said that you and your dog were in the barn when you heard something. And then you left us for a bit. What are you talking about? How'd I get here? So,what attacked you? Was it a kryptofreak again? No,no,no,I know. It was a spirit from the phantom zone, right,kal-el? How do you know that name? 'Cause you never shut up about it, oh,great son of jor-el. Settle down,gentlemen. Wait,back off! Take it easy,clark. Take those deep breaths we talked about. Who are you? It's me... dr. Hudson. Hold on. I don't want to have to hurt anyone. Why don't you just use your superspeed and run away? What? Why are you doing this to me? What do you want? What's happening?! Let me go! Please,someone! Why am I here?! -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> SMALLVILLE Season 06 Episode 12</font> here! I don't belong in here! I'm not crazy. I don't belong here. Back away from the door. Back away from the door! How'd I get here? Think back,clark. You know how that happened. Someone or something attacked me in my barn. Is this 33.1? It's lex. He's always wanted to get me under his microscope. I'm afraid your obsession with lex luthor is part of the fantasy world that you created after you experienced your psychotic break. I get it. You want me to think I'm crazy. I would prefer not to use pejoratives. You suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. You have for a number of years... ...after the death of your birth parents in the smallville meteor shower. See,it's not true. My birth parents were out of town for the meteor shower. You were placed in the wonderful adoptive home of the kents. But like many children, you invented a make-believe world to help you deal with the trauma you endured. You convinced yourself that you came from another planet, that you possessed special powers and you used them to save humanity. Whatever you're trying to do, it's not gonna work. An active imagination wasn't a problem when you were a boy. But when you entered your freshman year at high school, you slipped permanently into your fantasy world. If you're gonna play mind games, you got to try harder. This isn't a game,clark. You're sick. And your condition is getting worse. But the good news is, I have developed a new treatment that will cure you. Tell lex that I don't buy it. Lex isn't your nemesis. And 33.1 doesn't exist. For the last 51/2 years, you've been a resident of the fairview psychiatric hospital. Everything else - your superpowers, your alien lineage, your secret identity... ...it's all a delusion. Hey,stop licking the ball - it's cheating. Time for medication. All right,let's go. Keep on moving. Keep on moving. That means you,too. Let's go. Don't hide that pill under your tongue. Swallow it. You're not crazy,kal-el. We don't have much time, so listen to me closely. I believe you're from another planet. What makes you say that? Because like you, I'm not from here. I come from mars. You can't trust anyone. Hey! Don't even think about it. Mom? Mom! Clark,you're home! I can't believe it! What are you doing here? What are all your things doing in the loft? Clark, this is my home now. After your dad passed away, nell and I bought the farm from your mom. Not everything has changed. I kept this. You once said that looking through it brought me closer to you. And having it here makes me feel like you're always with me. I don't understand. I know. This must be really hard for you. You've been gone a long time and a lot has changed. But none of that matters anymore. Freshman year, you promised me that we would never be apart. You were right. We weren't dating then. You... you were with whitney. The football jock? Clark... there's only one person I've ever been in love with... you. It's okay. The doctor said that you'd suffer mild amnesia after the treatment. What treatment? I didn't have any treatment. But you were released from the hospital. I wasn't released. I escaped. Lex luthor put me in that hellhole. Lex didn't put you in there. No! I don't care if you two are engaged - stop protecting him! I hardly know lex luthor. I'm gonna call the hospital. No,stop. You're lying. You're in on this, aren't you? He sent you here! That's why you're here - to distract me until he shows up. Please stop. What did lex do with my mother? Where is she?! She's probably at the mansion - the luthor mansion. Clark... Thank god. You're okay. Oh,clark! Oh,I've been a wreck all day. Everyone at the hospital is so worried about you. You knew I was in that place? Dr. Hudson called lionel the moment you disappeared. They've both been looking for you. Lionel? He must be in on it. He must have told lex the truth about me. Clark,please, try to calm down. Calm down? Mom,you don't understand. They put me in that asylum. They took away my powers. Oh,sweetheart... it'll be all right. Mom,we have to get you out of here. We have to get you away from lionel. No,clark. Lionel and i are married now. I- I meant to tell you, but I-I was afraid of how you'd react. How could you? He's a good,decent man. Lionel's made sure you've gotten better care than I could ever afford. He's been lying to you! No,clark. Dr. Hudson's treatment will make you well again. Please, I just want my son back. No,you're coming with me right now. No,I - ADALEFLINE they're drugging you,too. Clark,those are my allergy pills. What are you doing? You need help,clark. Mom,you don't understand what's going on. - You're coming with me. - No. - Right now! - No! Come on! Mom! You have to - please,don't hurt him! Stop! There's nowhere to run, mr. Kent. Just relax and put your hands behind you. Chloe,how'd you find me? Are you kidding me? I've been in gps mode ever since my contact I.M.'D me about the breakout this morning. Look,I can't stay here. I don't want to get you involved. Clark, I already am involved. You think you're the only one whose life's been turned upside down? Why do you think I've been under the radar? Chloe,they're after me, not you. They're after both of us. Now,don't ditch your sidekick till you get your powers back. You might need me to cover you. Glad to see you,chloe. I was beginning to think I was actually losing it. Clark,once we get this thing on the front page, father and son luthor are gonna be wearing matching orange jumpsuits. Lex... I got to go see him. Wait a minute. You just got out,clark. You're gonna go back into the devil's lair? Lex is more dangerous than ever right now. Even more reason to stop him. No,clark,you don't have your powers back. You could get hurt like everyone else. Powers or no powers, I won't let him do this to me. All right,fine. Since your superspeed's out of gas,take my yaris. And be careful. Surprised to see me? My father said you were out. I just never thought you'd have the nerve to show your face. You may have taken my powers,lex, but I'm not afraid of you. And I won't let you ruin my life. Your... life. I think you have that a little backwards. Did you forget our little run-in on the loeb bridge five years ago? When you save someone's life, you tend to remember. You really think you saved me. Well,then, let me refresh your memory. I have to spend the rest of my life in this chair because of you. This isn't possible. I was there - and you caused the accident! Oh,you claimed you saw my car swerving out of control, so you jumped in front of it to save me with your superpowers. But when I jerked the wheel, my porsche flipped end over end and wrapped around the guard rail. That's not what happened. If it was up to me, you'd be rotting in jail. But my father insisted you go to that mental hospital instead. Anything to impress martha kent with his kindness. This is a trick. It's a trick! Really? Open your eyes, you crazy son of a bitch! Does this look like a trick to you?! If there's one thing I regret in my life... it's that I didn't just run you over. Clark. I knew you'd come here to see chloe. What happened to the coffeehouse? Clark,this has been an abandoned movie theater for as long as I can remember. No,this doesn't make sense. This can't be real. Lana,lex said that I... caused his accident. Is that true? It's all in the past now. Clark,come back to the farm with me. We can get through this. We can get through anything. None of this makes sense,lana. And you and I - we're not together anymore. Ever since kindergarten, we've been together,clark. Thought that this would help you to remember. It's from the gumball machine at quinn's market. You gave it to me when we were 10 years old. You said that it was my wedding ring. And when you put it on my finger and kissed me for the first time, that's when you stole my heart. I don't remember. You suffered so much in that hospital. Every weekend when I'd come to visit, I could see it in your eyes. I never gave up hope that you'd get better. I don't know what's going on. But chloe does. She knows who I am. Clark,you shouldn't see her right now. Chloe! Clark,thank god. What's going on? ******Lex and his men took everything. They're trying to wipe me off the face of the earth. You know, lex is in a wheelchair. Clark,when it comes to the luthors, you can't trust anything,okay? We got to go subterranean until you get your powers back. But,chloe, I'm not so sure. Nothing's the way it's supposed to be. It all seems so crazy. ****** We're not crazy. We're just the only two that know the truth. That's why they put us in the mental institution. I tried to tell you. What's she doing here? Chloe was in fairview with you. You were in that place,too? They put me in that snake pit to shut me up. You know that she has a family history of mental illness. Don't listen to her,clark. She's just trying to confuse you. Clark,please, just come with me. And I'll get you the help that you need. I should have known you'd never be able to resist her. You never could. If she's here,it means they're not far behind. Chloe,hold on! Just stay here! We'll figure this out! There's nothing to figure out,clark. I know who you really are, and they're gonna kill me for it. I have to go! Mr. Kent, just take it easy. Chloe? Chloe. Clark,I'm not crazy. No. No! Chloe? This can't be real. Chloe didn't die. No. She couldn't have. I'm sorry,clark. I know how much you cared about your friend. What the hell do you want from me? For you to have a happy,healthy life. And it will become a reality... after this treatment. I'm not gonna go through with it. I know who I am! I'm not sure you do. Your name is clark kent, not kal-el. And jor-el isn't your father. JOREL ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP Dr. Fine,dr. Milton fine, please report to level three,stat. When the human mind has faced tremendous emotional pain, it has no choice but to protect itself. You've taken bits and pieces of your surroundings and created an alternate universe where you feel safe and secure. Clark... in a world where you truly have no power, you chose to give yourself superpowers. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  A PRISON MEMOIR PHANTOM ZONE Good morning,doctor. Good morning,raya. FIARBIEW MENTAL HEALTH  HOSPITAL That'll be all,raya. BUILDING CAPACITY 331 This is a piece of meteor rock from smallville. Oh,it's - it's all right,clark. It can't hurt you. It's not what you call kryptonite. ****** Chloe... really is dead. I'm sorry,clark. I'll get the treatment ready. You can't give in,kal-el. You must resist. None of this is real. Leave me alone. Listen to me. When you were attacked in the barn, you were infected by a being that you released from the phantom zone. The phantom zone doesn't exist. Yes,it does. And if you were a human, that spirit would have taken you over with ease, uthor. But you're a lot stronger than that. You're kryptonian. You're a patient in a mental hospital. You're just as crazy as I am. If you give in to hudson and undergo this treatment, the entity will gain control of your body with all its powers and unite the other fugitives from the phantom zone. Together,they'll enslave all of mankind. If this is all in my head, then how are you here? I'm in your mind as well, trying to help. But there's only one way to purge this parasite and regain your consciousness. You have to kill hudson. Kill hudson? I can't kill a man. He's not a man. Hudson's a phantom. You told me not to trust anyone. Why should I trust you? You know who you are,kal-el. Trust yourself. Well,if it isn't our visitor from mars. Look within. Believe in yourself. The future of mankind depends on it. Whoa,what's the matter, there,freak,huh? Scared of a little fire? Isn't mars the red-hot planet? Welcome home. Get him out of here. It's time,mr. Kent. I didn't want you to go through this alone. Dr. Hudson said I could come. So close,clark. You're gonna get better, and we can finally be together, like we were always meant to be. I want you to be real. I am real. Okay. Let's say that I am a hallucination... and that your world really does exist. I'm about to marry your greatest enemy. You're an alien from another planet who's responsible for so much tragedy. Do you really want to live in that reality? I don't know what to believe anymore. Don't you just want to take this treatment and be with me? Of course I want to be with you... more than you could ever imagine. Then stop fighting,please. You've lived like this carried this burden of being a hero. It's time to just let go and live a normal life. I've never been normal. Your destiny isn't to save the world,clark. It's to be with me for the rest of our lives. There's no need to be afraid,clark. The procedure is quite painless. It will be over in the blink of an eye. Shelby? I'm still in the barn. Settle down,son. I know who I am! **** ******* Stop it! You're having another episode. Think about lana. You could be together at last. Get out of my mind! It's you. Welcome home,kal-el. Clark? Clark,are you all right? Hey. - Hi. - shelby. Thank you,buddy. You saved my life. You're sure I was only out for a second. I was walking from my car when I heard you fall, and by the time I got to the barn,you were on your feet. It felt like a lifetime. I got to give the phantom props. Dangling the lana carrot is a pretty tempting offer. But he clearly has never come across the steel will of clark kent. Chloe, you don't understand. I almost gave up everything and everyone that I care about... ...for lana. Wait a second. Based on the pending nuptials, I thought lana was past tense. So did I. The truth is, I still love her. I guess kryptonite's not your only weakness. So,who was i in your alternate universe? Editor in chief of the dailyplanet? Or a pulitzer prize winner, maybe? Something like that,yeah. The important part is... ...you were the one person who believed in me. I don't know what I'd do without you,chloe. Oh,is this when I'm supposed to cue the barry manilow music? No,seriously. You mean a lot more to me than you know. You look like you've got something on your mind. It's that obvious,huh? You don't hide your feelings as well as you think. How you doing? - I mean,with - - fine. Yeah. Everything's fine. Good. So,are you gonna tell me? What was that look in your eye? Oh,I... I had a dream about you last night. I hope that it wasn't a nightmare. No. We were 10 years old, and I gave you a plastic ring from a gumball machine at quinn's market. Sweet. What was the occasion? It was an engagement ring. What happened next? I woke up. Lana. I should have guessed your delay wasn't the herbal tea. Clark. It's good to see you out and about,lex. You know,you actually sounded convincing when you said that. I appreciate the civility. You ready to go? We don't want to keep the wedding planner waiting. Yeah,we were just saying goodbye. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily
