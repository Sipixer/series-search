Roger Nixon. I'm a journalist, and I'd like to write a story about you. - Whitney's going off to join the Marines. - Really? If you're gonna take me on, son... ...you're gonna have to bring your game up to a whole different level. Just promise me Saturday night's gonna be great. It'll be a night you won't forget. There's a whole lot more to your friend Clark Kent than meets the eye. You'd better pray you're not wrong. You're not my enemy. You're my son. I believe the term is, "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war." - Lana's there. - Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now. I'll tell the entire world about your son! Jonathan, look! Damn it! Help me! But he knows everything! - I will not let him destroy this family. - No! Please! Jonathan! Clark! No! And now, the season premiere of Smallville. Lex! I'm your father! Son! Dad! Dad! No! Nixon! - Give me the camera! - Get the hell away from me! Lana? Lana. I need help! I need a doctor here! - I need help. Now. - What have we got? Pupils are responsive. Respiration appears normal. Got a good pulse. She's gonna be all right. Can you tell me her name? Mom! Dad! Mom? Mom! Mom! - Mom, you okay? - Clark! Clark. We have to find your father. He was outside when the tornado hit. - I'm gonna get you to a hospital. - No, Clark, listen to me. - That reporter was in the cellar. - Nixon? He videotaped the ship. He's gonna expose your secret. - Your father chased him out into the storm. - I've gotta find them. Mom? Where's the ship? There's swelling in his vertebrae, resulting in partial loss of nerve control in his legs. His spleen is ruptured... ...and he's sustained severe trauma to his optic nerve. I want a medevac to Metropolis General. I want a team of specialists. Your father's critical. Moving him is not an option. - This isn't just any patient. - I know who Lionel Luthor is. - I cannot give him any special treatment. - That's not what I meant. He's my father. Do everything you can for him. Lex. Lex. Yeah, Dad, I'm here. Don't worry. I'll fly in specialists from Metropolis to personally supervise your case. I saw it... ...in your eyes, son... ...what you were thinking. Life would be so easy... ...if I was out of your way. Dad, I'm sorry. Dad! - Dad! - He hasn't been back to the house! Did you call the sheriff? The hospital? - The phones are down. - Dad grew up in tornado country. - The first thing he'd do is take shelter. - I don't know if he was thinking straight. I've never seen your father that angry. He said he wasn't gonna let Nixon destroy our family. Do you think he...? No, he would never do that. Oh, no! I won't say anything about your son, I swear to God! Please! Don't kill me! Oh, God. - Oh, God. I thought you were gonna kill me. - Yeah, you would think that. - Hey, Dorothy, back from Oz? - Chloe. What are you doing? Shouldn't you be in bed? I'm okay. The doctor says it's just a mild concussion. Besides, a lot of people need this bed a lot more than I do. Well, I'm just glad you're okay. What happened? Well, I was driving back after dropping Whitney off, when the wind picked up. This mailbox slammed against my windshield, and I went off the road. That's when I saw the twisters. - Before I knew it, the truck was sucked up. - God. You walked away with a small bump. That's amazing, even by Smallville standards. - No, it's impossible. - What? Nothing. The next thing I knew, I was waking up here. So you clicked your heels, said, "There's no place like home," and ended up here. Apparently Clark brought me in. - Clark? - Yeah, have you seen him? No, not since he vanished from the dance. I spent three hours looking for him. Guess the Spring Formal was kind of a bust, huh? Yeah, well, at least now I know where he disappeared to. If it's any consolation, you guys looked great together. It's not, but thanks. Dad? Clark, I ran into your mother at the hospital. She told me about your dad. I checked every acre of this place, I gotta head for the woods. Clark. My father was injured in the twister. He's in pretty bad shape. - Lex, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? - It's in the doctor's hands now. During the storm, my father was trapped beneath a column. If I hadn't pulled him out, he would've died. Before I did, I hesitated. I was thinking that maybe my life would be better off if I just left him to die. - You saved him, that's the important part. - No. My father won't see it that way. Forgiveness is not in his emotional lexicon. If anything, he'll probably see my saving him as a sign of weakness. What are you gonna do? Help my friend find his dad. You got another flashlight? - Dad! - Mr. Kent! Mr. Kent! Dad! - Do you know whose car that is? - No. I think we can cover more ground if we split up. Yeah. - I'll meet you back here in a half-hour. - Okay. Great. What are you doing? Looking for my cell phone. It's our only hope. The greatest story in human history, and I'm not gonna get a chance to write it. Clark is not a story, he's my son. And I'm not gonna let you sabotage his life while you make yourself famous. Is that why you chased me? What were you planning on doing, Kent? Were you gonna bludgeon me and bury me in a shallow grave? You were trespassing on my property, and you tried to kill my son in that truck. You have the most amazing being on Earth doing chores on your farm. Why are you hiding him? Tell the world and let them see for themselves. I think I should leave that up to him for when he's older. Well, when do you suppose that'll be? Draft age? Drinking age? When he's ready. Why don't you stop playing the protector and admit the truth. You kept him because you couldn't have children of your own. We kept him because he is our son and we love him. He's not your son, you deluded hick! He's not even human. You can kill me for saying this, but you know I'm right. You're just a small man whose son's destiny is too big for you to comprehend. Clark doesn't belong to you. He belongs to the world. Hello? Lex? Nixon? Where the hell are you? You stupid son of a bitch! I thought you wanted to get out of here! I did want out of here, till I realized you were in bed with Lex Luthor. And I would rather rot down here than watch the two of you destroy my son's life! Nixon, you still there? Just calling the fire department so we can get a rescue team out here. No, you weren't. I heard you trying to talk to Roger Nixon. He was at the farm today. He was with my dad when the tornado hit. Clark, I didn't know Nixon was involved. Why should I believe you? You already lied about knowing him once. That's the second time you've hesitated today. Maybe what my dad said about you is true. Clark, wait. - You're tired and upset. - Don't try to turn this around on me! Are you really here to find my dad, or to find Nixon? - Do you even have to ask? - I don't have time for this. - I've gotta find my dad. - Clark! Dad! I'll talk to the Red Cross people... ...see if they have any new information about your father. Clark. - Any luck? - We looked all night. The search-and-rescue team combed the farm but didn't find anything. I don't know what to do, he's been missing for over 12 hours. You'll find him, Clark. I know it. Thanks. - I thought you'd be home recuperating. - I wanted to help. You know, a lot of people helped me out after the meteor shower. Meant a lot. I'm just glad you're okay. So how did you find me? I was lucky, I guess. You were in a field next to the road. You must have been thrown free from the truck. Is that really what happened? Yeah. Why? I just keep seeing something that doesn't make any sense. The truck was caught up in the tornado, and you... You just... Clark. No new word. I'd better get back to work. You'll find him. I'm gonna stay and work the phones. If anybody's seen or found him, they'll call in. They discovered an old couple trapped in their garage this morning. So there's still hope. Dad's missing because of me. I brought this upon us. You can't blame yourself. You can't change who you are. As long as you live, people will try to exploit you. Your father and I have tried to shelter you as long as possible... ...but one day we won't be there for you. You'll have to carry the burden of your gifts on your own. - Don't say that, Mom. - When your day comes... ...I have no doubt in my heart that you'll make us proud. Now go back out there. These old foundations, they mix lead in with the cement for stability. - Afraid we're gonna die of lead poisoning? - Clark can't see through lead. He can see through solid objects? Unbelievable. What else can he do? Do you have any idea what I'd do with his abilities? The wealth, the power he could amass, it's unimaginable. You are exactly the reason why I keep his abilities a secret. If it wasn't me, it would've been someone else. It was just a matter of time before the story got out. - Yeah. - The people have a right to know. Without any regard to the consequences to my son. Mr. Kent... ...since the beginning of time, people have been looking at the stars, and wondering: "What's out there?" Clark is the answer that they have been waiting for. - I think I know a way out of here. - You gonna tell me what that is? You give me the tape of the ship, and I will. That's not gonna happen. It's your life or your story. You've gotta decide which is more important to you. I have. You gonna share your plan with me? Feel that. Go on. - The mortar's weaker here. - Yeah. If we can get through here, I'm sure that we can tunnel up to the surface. - Clark. - What do you want? I should have come out and told you the truth right away. I do know Roger Nixon. I was just trying to protect you. Protect me from what? Before the tornado, Nixon approached me. He offered to sell me information about your family. - What kind of information? - It doesn't matter. He's a liar. He'll do anything for a story. I warned him to stay away from your family. When I saw his car, I... I realized he might have had something to do with your father's disappearance. Why didn't you tell me before? I didn't want to alarm you unless I knew for sure. You know, Lex, I don't know what to believe anymore. Believe that I'm your friend. I've got something to show you. - What's that? - It's a map. A cellular frequency grid, to be exact. I had my people look into it. Only one cell tower survived the storm, meaning Nixon, and possibly your father... ...had to be within a one-mile radius of where we were last night. I don't know if it will help, but it's worth a shot. - Mr. Kent! - Dad! - Well, this is the edge of the grid. - There are no structures marked on the map. Sorry, Clark. Wait, what's that? The twister must have dropped it here. - He's not in here. - What are you, part bloodhound? Yeah. How do you know? Mr. Kent! Dad! Mr. Kent! - Did you hear that? - It's the kids. Chloe! Pete! - Help! - We're down here! They can't hear us! They can't. I gotta keep on digging. Go! Roger, take it easy! It's not stable down here. I got your legs! Hang on! Did you hear something? Come on, let's start again. - Mr. Kent? - Dad! Here we see a terrifying example of the tornado's fury. This truck was literally ripped apart. Incredibly, the young driver, Lana Lang, survived. Reminding us that, even in the midst of utter devastation, miracles can happen. It must have been awful for you. Yeah. I don't think I've ever been that scared in my entire life. I'm glad you're all right. Thanks for all your help, Mrs. Kent. - I know it must be hard for you right now. - I'm a saint. I just can't believe how familiar all this feels. - The meteor shower? - Yeah. God. - I remember it like it was yesterday. - Yeah, me too. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to dredge up bad memories. It's okay. For so long it seemed to define me. That fairy princess picture on Time magazine. Well, if it makes you feel any better, you made one wish come true that day. Jonathan and I were in Nell's buying flowers, right before the meteor shower... ...and you were sitting on the counter with your wings and wand... ...and you asked me if I wanted to make a wish, so I did. And not long after that, Clark came into our lives. I've never even told Clark that story. Clark is so lucky to have you and Mr. Kent as parents. I've always been kind of envious. You seem so open. I'm glad that you and Clark have become close. Yeah. Me too. - Mr. Kent! - Mr. Kent? Mr. Kent! Chloe? I've been wanting to apologize for leaving you at the formal. Didn't I tell you that leaving in the middle of a tornado to save a friend... ...totally gets you off the hook? - Besides, I know you'd do the same for me. - Oh, in a heartbeat. So how can I make it up to you? Actually, you know, I've been thinking. It's funny how a natural disaster puts your life in perspective. But I think it might be better if we just stay really good friends. Anything other than that just gets too complicated. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. - You do? - Yeah. Yeah, our friendship is so important to me, the last thing I want to do is screw it up. Good. Great. Perfect. I'm really glad we got that straightened out. I'm gonna check over here. Okay, I'll catch up in a sec. My feet are throbbing. Mr. Kent! - Hey. - Hey. - What's up with the fake smile? - Nothing. Clark and I just reaffirmed that we're really good friends. And nothing else. - Pulled the "friends" card on you, huh? - No, I did. Defense mechanism. Listen, Chloe... ...it's okay to feel bummed out. Last night was supposed to be special... ...and it got ruined. It was just so close to being perfect. Listen to me, I sound so pathetic. A tornado hit, people are in real trouble... ...and I'm upset because Clark didn't fulfill my wish-fulfillment fantasy. You must think I'm an awful person. Yeah, you're a real monster. Come on. I can't breathe. The cave-in must have cut off the air supply. Dying in a tomb, that's ironic. At least you've got a legacy to leave behind. That's something to be proud of. First time Clark used his abilities... ...he'd crawled under... ...a big oak bed that my grandfather had made, and I... I crawled underneath to try and get him out, and then, all of a sudden, the... The frame just came up in the air. He was a toddler lifting, I don't know what it was, 500 pounds over his head. What did you do? We decided to take him to a doctor or a scientist. Somebody more equipped... ...to understand than we were. But when we got in front of the office, Martha said that if we left him there... ...that they would want to keep him, and we'd never see him again. So I took him home. Now, that may have been a mistake. But it was a mistake I'd gladly make again. Time is of the essence. The spine may heal, but the optic nerve will get worse if it goes untreated. - So surgery's the only option. - No, I recommend against this. I say, let the patient's condition stabilize before surgery is attempted. Yes, surgery's risky, but the alternative could be worse. It's your decision. Do it. Fine. Where'd you get these maps? My mom borrowed them from the county planner's office. They list every zoning change going back to 1920. Look, the plans from 1988 show an old church near Hobson's Pond. - I've never seen a church there. - It was destroyed in the meteor shower. According to this, there's a crypt in the basement. Your dad could have known about it. I was right there. The motor home must have been concealing the entrance. Clark! You can't dig him out on your own. Clark, Pete and I'll go into town. We'll get a rescue team and meet you out there. Okay! - Dad! - Clark! - Dad! - Clark. Kent, what's happening to him? You gotta get him away from the meteor rocks. They make him sick. Come on, get him out of here! What are you doing? I don't need the tape. I got all the evidence I need right here. What are you doing? Nixon! You don't understand! The rocks... Clark... Oh, son of a... You're not... ...taking my son! Like I said, the people have a right to know. And unlike you, Mr. Kent... ...I am willing to kill for what I believe in. Clark. - Mr. Kent, are you okay? - Yeah. Son. You've gotta help me. Clark, are you okay? I'll survive. Your dad's got a cracked rib, but he'll be all right. Well, like you said, he's a survivor. And so are you. I never realized how strong you were until today. Thanks, Clark, but I was terrified. You didn't show it. You were like super mom. Dad, how you feeling? Thank you. Kind of like a house fell on me. That's how I feel. - Dad, I'm glad that you didn't, you know... - What, kill Nixon? I have to admit, it was the hardest thing I ever did, took every fiber of my being. But I started thinking about you and what your Mom and I've tried to teach you. I realized if I had done that, Nixon would have won. It's a good thing Lex was there. Clark. Nixon told me that Lex offered to pay him for information on us. Lex told me he warned Nixon to stay away. One of them is lying, son. The question you need to ask yourself is, which one tried to kill you... ...and which one saved your life? If I have any more questions, I'll give you a call. - Thanks. Mr. Kent. - Lex. - Look... - Lex... You saved my life, and I want to say thank you. To a fresh start. Yeah. Clark. Your mom told me what happened with you and Lana in the tornado. The only person who was there, and I can't even share it with her. Well, son, I'm here, you can share it with me if you want. Dad, I've survived a lot. Being inside that twister... I've never been so scared in my life. I couldn't see anything. Things were bouncing off me. I didn't have any control. It could've been the wind, but I moved toward the truck... ...and it felt like I was willing myself to do it. It felt like I was flying. Lex. Lex. Dad? Dad. How are you? The doctors won't tell me what's going on. I know. I wanted to tell you myself. There's every chance I'm gonna get back... ...the full use of my legs. Well, that's great news. Isn't it? I need to say something to you. If I've acted ruthlessly... ...it was because I knew my opponents wouldn't hesitate to do the same. I know you've always seen us as opponents. Lex, when I needed help... ...you saved my life. And I thank you, son. Listen. I know you agreed to go right ahead... ...right away, to operate. - I thought it best to take immediate action. - I would have done the same thing. And we both... ...would have been wrong. What are you saying? I'm blind. The operation failed. And that's not going to change. It would have been better if you had not helped me. If you'd let me... ...die. Lex? Lex. Lex. What are you doing, Clark? - Thinking. - Looks like you're hiding. I just can't wait for things to get back to normal. It won't. Why do you say that? Nell used to tell me that after the meteor shower. But these events change you. Wipes out your illusions. You discover things about yourself. What'd you discover? I've always had this sense that I was going to die young. Maybe because of my parents. Felt guilty I'd survived. When the tornado came, I thought... ...this was it, fate had finally found me. Then I saw you in the truck... ...and you put your arms around me and told me everything was going to be okay. I know, it sounds crazy. But I started to think of all the other times you've been there to protect me. I thought, "Maybe there's more to Clark Kent than meets the eye." You're right. It does sound crazy. There's nothing more to me than what you see. Clark. You know you can tell me anything, right? I know, Lana. But I wasn't in that truck. Then how did I survive? It doesn't make any sense. Maybe you just weren't meant to die young. Just remember: You can't hide out here forever. Subtitle by:
