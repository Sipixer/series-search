Luthors are not afraid! We don't have that luxury. We're leaders. You have a destiny. You'll never get anywhere with your eyes closed. Abracadabra. - Afternoon, Nell. - Jonathan! Martha. What a surprise. What brings the reclusive Kents to town? Tulips. Red ones, if you have them. What about a tiger orchid? No, thanks. Martha has her heart set on tulips. Yes, well, they are a very uncomplicated flower. That's a beautiful dress, Lana! Are you a princess? - I'm a fairy princess. - Where are her parents? They're at the homecoming game. I'm being the good aunt. Do you want to make a wish? I would love to make a wish. Abracadabra. I know what you wished for. I see a little face. It's all I ever wanted. Hey, looks like Smallville won again. Lex? Son? Now, where do I sign? Right here, Mr. Luthor. - Help me. - Huh? Help me, please. Hey, kid... Help me. Help me, please. What on God's Earth...? Hi, Lana! Mommy! Daddy! What's happening, Jonathan? Lex! Lex! Where are you? Lex? Lex? Martha? Kids don't just fall out of the sky, Martha. - Then where did he come from? - I don't know. But he must have parents. If he does, they're definitely not from Kansas. Sweetheart, we can't keep him. What'll we say? We found him in a field? We didn't find him. He found us. Clark, you're gonna be late! Coming, Mom. - Ah, ah! - It tastes better from the bottle. - Where'd you learn your manners? - On a farm. Afternoon, sleepyhead. I have class tonight so you two are on your own. And no pizza! There's food in the fridge. Hey, what you got there, son? Permission slip. It's for the football team. They're having tryouts this afternoon. - You played football, Dad. - That was different. - Why? - You know why. I'll run at half speed- Lot of things can happen in the heat of the game. Most new guys hardly even play. Chances are I'll ride the bench half the season. I can be careful. I know you can be careful, but what if there's an accident? Look, Clark, I know this has gotta be really hard for you... ...but hang in there like we promised. I'm sick of hanging in there. All I wanna do is go through high school without being a total loser. I can't believe you bet against him. If the clock moved any slower, he'd be extinct. Did you hear that? - So did anyone ask you to the dance? - Not yet. If nothing pans out, maybe you... Take a break from your soap opera. I'm not interested in Clark. Your vehement denial has been duly noted. Maybe you and I could go. Not as a date thing, more of a friend thing. Hi, guys. Didn't you just-? Weren't you-? - I took a shortcut. - Through a black hole? You'll have to excuse our reporter. Her "weirdar" is on Defcon 5. She thought the bus was attacked. Just because everyone ignores the strange things that go on... ...doesn't mean they don't happen. We'd love to join you and Scooby for another zany adventure... ...but we need to hand in these slips before homeroom. I'm having second thoughts. I don't think it's a good idea. This is the only way. Wait. You two are trying out for the football team? What is this, some sort of teen suicide pact? We're trying to avoid being a scarecrow. What are you talking about, and why the whispering? It's tradition. Before the game, the players pick a freshman... ...take him and paint an S on his chest. - String him up like a scarecrow. - Sounds like years of therapy. That's why we're trying out. They won't choose one of their own. - I'll see you guys in class. - Bye. - Give him 10 seconds. - Five. One, two, three, four, five. Statistical fact. He can't get within 5 feet of Lana Lang... ...without turning into a freak show. Nietzsche. Didn't realize you had a dark side, Clark. - Doesn't everybody? - Yeah, I guess so. So, what are you, man or superman? - Haven't figured it out yet. - Lana. There you are. Hey, Clark. I was wondering if you could do me a favor. Could you check my English paper? I didn't finish until 2 a. m. - I'm not sure about the ending. - I'll bet it's great. Dude. Are you feeling all right? - You look like you're about to hurl. - I'm fine. You forgot one, Clark. Payback time. Thanks, Dad. Ready! Down! Set! Hike! Red and gold no doubt We're here to win one out</i> I knew you could do it, Clark. Clark, Clark, Clark... Clark! How do I look? Like a tackle dummy. Good luck. Come on, don't die on me! I could've sworn I hit you. If you did, I'd be... I'd be dead. Clark! - Son, you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Who's the maniac driving the car? - That would be me. Lex Luthor. I'm Jonathan Kent. This is my son. Thanks for saving my life. I'm sure you'd have done the same. You have an extraordinary boy. If there's any way I can repay you- You could drive slower. My aunt'll be back any minute. Oh, come on! We're living on the edge. If Aunt Nell finds us here, your life won't be worth living. - Where is she anyway, bridge club? - Lex Luthor's. I didn't know your aunt was in with the Luthors. She sold them a ton of land. They own the Metropolis Sharks. She could put in a good word. If you want a good word, ask Clark. - He saved Lex's life today. - You're kidding. Sometimes people can surprise you. I think it's kind of cool. Coach said a scout from Kansas State is coming to the game on Saturday. That's great. I don't want to be a "Remember him?" Smallville's got enough of those guys. I want you to wear this to the game. I can't take this. You can give it back after you win. Is it really made from a piece of the meteor that, you know...? So much bad luck came out of it... ...there can only be good luck left. Jeez, kid! Scared the crap out of me. Don't I know you? You look like that scarecrow kid. Where the hell you been? Hey, freakazoid, wake up. That was 12 years ago, man. That was just a game. What do you want? To play. - Hey, Mom, whose truck? - Yours. It's a gift from Lex Luthor. "Dear Clark: Drive safely. Always in your debt... ...the maniac in the Porsche. " I don't believe it. Where are the keys? Your father has them. I know how much you want it, son, but you can't keep it. - Why not? I saved his life. - So you deserve a prize? That's not what I meant. How about you drive it, and I'll drive the old one? - Everybody wins. - It's not about winning, Clark. It's not like the Luthors can't afford it. Do you know why that is? Remember Mr. Bell? We'd fish on his property. Mr. Guy? He sent us pumpkins on Halloween. Lionel Luthor promised to cut them in on a deal. He sent them flashy gifts. Once they sold him their property, he went back on his word. He had them evicted. You're judging Lex on what his father did? No, Clark, I'm not. I want to make sure you know... ...where the money came from that bought that truck. Clark, I know you're upset, son, but it's normal. Normal? How about this? Is this normal? I didn't dive in after Lex's car. It hit me at 60 mph. Does that sound normal to you? I'd give anything to be normal. It's time, son. Time for what? The truth. I want you to take a look at something. I think it's from your parents. Your real parents. What does it say? I tried to decipher it for years, but it's not a language known to man. What do you mean? Your real parents weren't exactly from around here. Where are they from? What are you trying to tell me? I'm from another planet? I suppose you stashed my spaceship in the attic. Actually, it's in the cellar. This is how you came into our world, son. It was the day of the meteor shower. This is a joke, right? Why didn't you tell me about this before? - We wanted to protect you. - Protect me from what? You should have told me. Clark. Clark! - Who's there? - It's me. Clark. Clark Kent? What are you doing creeping around the woods? You'd never believe me if I told you. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Clark, wait. Just wasn't expecting to see anyone out here. Are you okay? I'm hanging out in a graveyard. Does that strike you as okay behavior? Hey, I'm here too. Good point. What's your story? Can you keep a secret? I'm the Fort Knox of secrets. I... ...came out here to talk with my parents. You must think I'm pretty weird, conversing with dead people. I don't think you're weird, Lana. Do you remember them? They died when I was 3. I'm sorry. It's not your fault, Clark. Come on, I'll introduce you. Mom, Dad? This is Clark Kent. Say hi. Hi. Yeah, he is kind of shy. How should I know? Mom asks if you're upset about a girl. - Dad asks if it's about a guy. - No, no. He has a twisted sense of humor. Seriously, Clark. Why are you out here? Ever feel like your life was supposed to be something different? Sometimes I dream I'm at school, waiting for Nell to pick me up. But she doesn't come. My parents drive up and they're not dead, they're just really late. I get in their car and we drive back to my real life in Metropolis. That's when I wake up. And for a minute, I'm totally happy. Until I realize I'm still alone. What's that, Mrs. Lang? Yeah, I'll tell her. Your mom wants you to know you're never alone. That she's always looking over you. No matter what. What's that, Mr. Lang? Your dad thinks you're a shoo-in for homecoming queen. They really say all that? Oh, they're quite chatty once you get them started. Thanks for walking me home. Beats creeping around the woods. You realize this is the longest conversation we've ever had? We should do it again. Yes, we should. So are you going to the dance? Yeah, with Whitney. Right, of course. How about you? No, figured I'd sit it out. If you change your mind... ...I might save you a dance. Good night, Clark. Hello? Hello? Clark? I didn't see you. I buzzed, but no one answered. How'd you get through the gate? Squeezed through the bars. If this is a bad time- No, I think Heiki has sufficiently kicked my ass for the day. This is a great place. - If you're dead and need it to haunt. - I meant it's roomy. It's the Luthor ancestral home. So my father claims. He had it shipped over from Scotland. I remember trucks rolled in for weeks. No one ever moved in. My father had no intention of living here. He's never been here. - Then why ship it over? - Because he could. How's the new ride? That's why I'm here. What's the matter? You don't like it? No, it's not that. I can't keep it. Clark, you saved my life. It's the least I can do. Your father doesn't like me. It's okay. I've been bald since I was 9. - I'm used to people judging me. - It's not personal. He's just not crazy about your dad. Figures the apple doesn't fall far from the tree? Understandable. What about you, Clark? Did you fall far from the tree? I'd better go. Thanks for the truck. Clark? Do you believe a man can fly? Sure, in a plane. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about soaring with nothing but air beneath you. - People can't fly, Lex. - I did. After the accident, when my heart stopped. It was the most exhilarating two minutes of my life. I flew over Smallville. And for the first time... ...I didn't see a dead end. I saw a new beginning. Thanks to you, I have a second chance. We are the future, Clark. I don't want anything to stand in the way of our friendship. - That's the third guy. - And they're all former jocks. - Who's the weirdo? - I don't know. Let's check him out. His name's Jeremy Creek. This is a picture of him 12 years ago. - This I took four hours ago. - That's impossible. He'd be 26. Must be a kid who looks like him. I thought he was a twin, until we checked this. He left the state infirmary. He'd been in a coma for 12 years, suffering from electrolyte imbalance. - Hasn't aged a day. - He just woke up? There was an electrical storm. The hospital's generator went down, and when it came back on, he was gone. Electricity charged him up. He's back, putting former jocks into comas. Why? Because 12 years ago today, they chose Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow. "Comatose boy found 20 yards from meteor strike. " - The blast must have done something. - No, this can't be right. - I think you ought to show him. - Show me what? It started out as a scrapbook and just mutated. What is it? I call it the Wall of Weird. It's every strange event that's happened in Smallville since the meteor shower. That's when it all began. The town went schizo. - What do you think? - Why didn't you tell me about this? Do you tell me everything about your life? We all keep secrets. Lana? My fault. It's all my fault. Chloe, just leave me alone. Congratulations, Clark. You're this year's scarecrow. - Don't mess with me right now. - Come on, bring it on! - What's with you and Lana? - Nothing. Like her necklace? Huh? Good, because it's as close as you'll ever get to her. Never changes. Help me. Hurts, doesn't it? You're Jeremy. I thought if I punished them, it'd stop. But it never stops. Wait. Where are you going? Homecoming dance. I never made it to mine. Get me down. Please? You're safer here. Help me. Help me. Clark? Oh, jeez. Who did this to you? Doesn't matter. You need to see a doctor. - I'll be okay. - At least let me give you a ride. Jeremy, you need to stop this. I don't know how you got here. - You should have stayed away. - I won't let you hurt my friends. Those people aren't your friends. The sprinklers will get them wet. I'll handle the rest. - They never did a thing to you. - This isn't for me. This is for others like us! What happened to you was my fault. I can understand your pain. I'm not in pain. I have a gift... ...a purpose and a destiny. So do I. Give it up, Jeremy. Are you okay? Who are you? Where am I? I'm Clark Kent, and you're in Smallville. I want to go home. What is that? Who did this to my truck? - The one on top. - That's cool. Your grandfather gave me that telescope... ...when I was about your age. I came downstairs for breakfast one morning, and there it was. Are you okay? Can I answer that in about five years? Yeah. Dad. I'm glad you and Mom are the ones that found me. We didn't find you, Clark. You found us. I didn't see you tonight, Clark. Lana. What are you doing here? I saved you that dance. Is everything okay, Clark? It's perfect.
