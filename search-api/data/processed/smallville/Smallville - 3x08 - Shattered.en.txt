Wasn't that the idea? Throat hurts. You'll feel better when the swelling in your vocal cords goes down. Personally, I think society places too much emphasis on looks. It should be the character of a man that counts. Don't you agree... ...Mr. Edge? I think you have me confused with someone else. You can change your face, your hair, your voice... ...but not your DNA. You still sweat the same. I don't walk out of here in five minutes... ...my people have orders to send the police... ...and inform my father that you didn't die on the docks that day. Maybe he'll send somebody to finish the job. What do you want? When you and my father were teenagers... ...you conspired to kill my grandparents... ...and split the insurance money. You on something, Lex? -Because, frankly, you sound delusional. -No, I've got evidence... ...but I need hard proof to bring down my father. You tell the whole story, he goes to prison. And maybe you can get a new life to go along with the face. I blow the building. Lionel gets rid of his bastard father and his gin-soaked mother. The slum lord splits the insurance payment with us. Lionel uses his cut for his first start-up. And the rest is history. Sorry for the interruption, sir, but your father called again. I did what you asked. I told him you weren't here. You look worried, Darius. Relax. Darius! Lex? Are you alone? Yeah. What happened to you? Somebody tried to kill me last night. Let's get you to a hospital, call the police. No hospitals, no police. These people are professionals. They killed my security guard, Darius. They tried to finish me off too. I just need time to think. -Who would want to kill you? -The less you know, the better. Lex, I can't help you if you don't tell me what's going on. It was probably my father. You guys have had your problems, but you really think he'd try to kill you? -lt was either him or Morgan Edge. -Morgan Edge. Isn't he the crime boss I read was killed in a shootout a few months ago? He survived, went underground. Got some hack plastic surgeon to change his appearance. What does he have against you? I have evidence linking him and my father... ...to a crime that can get them the death penalty. That evidence was supposed to be delivered to the U.S. Attorney. Clark, is that you? But it's in my safe, Clark, and I can't go back there. Clark? I thought I heard somebody up here. Since you're up with the cows, why don't you give me a hand with milking? Sorry, Dad, I got some last-minute cramming to do. All right. But I expect you to get an A. Yes, sir. All right, I'll go get what's in your safe. No. It's too dangerous, Clark. -My people could be in on this. -lf anyone asks, I'll just play dumb... ...tell them I was there to meet you. Tell me exactly what happened. Mr. Kent. Can I help you? I'm here to see Lex. Most of the household is still asleep. Is Darius on duty? He had the night off. You got stuck with the graveyard shift. What a bummer. Anything unusual happen? Not until you arrived. Right. Well, I know how to take a hint, so.... Tell Darius I was asking for him. I'm telling you, Lex, it's like being in The Twilight Zone. There was nothing wrong. I didn't imagine getting shot at, Clark. They must've had cleaners to cover their tracks. Yeah, well, they missed a spot. I found this in the hallway. I called Darius' house to see if anyone knew he was missing. But according to his answering machine, his wife and kids are visiting their grandparents. Darius is probably at the bottom of Crater Lake by now. Maybe we should call the U.S. Attorney. Tell him what? He was nervous about... ...going after someone as powerful as Lionel Luthor to begin with. I don't think he'll be issuing warrants based on a shard of glass. Is there anyone who can corroborate any part of your story? Well, is Lex all right? He's freaked out. Pretty shaken up, but he's alive. How'd you get mixed up in this? I was-- I was just researching Lionel Luthor for a story. I found out that he ran with a pretty tough crowd as a kid. Morgan Edge? Yeah, I thought Lex would be interested, but I had no idea... ...he'd develop this theory that Edge and Lionel murdered his grandparents. Chloe, these people are dangerous. They could come after you too. Lex and I both agree you should stay out of sight. No. Nobody who knows anything about this is safe. Not until whoever's responsible is exposed. I'm not gonna leave you alone. Grab your laptop, and let's go. Hello, Clark. -Miss Sullivan, isn't it? -Yeah. Clark, Mr. Luthor has something he'd like to talk to you about. I'm afraid it's serious. Have you seen Lex, Clark? -Not for a few days. -Lex is missing. It's important that I find him. Mr. Luthor, I know Lex pretty well. If he wanted you to know where he was, you probably would. Lex is seriously ill. He needs help. What do you mean, ill? There's a psychotic break. Lex has had a psychotic break. That can't be right. It happened while he was on that island. I thought he'd beaten it... ...but he's had a relapse. He's suffering from paranoid delusions. He's hearing voices. He sees things that aren't there. I want my son. I want him back... ...the way he used to be. If you hear from him, Clark, you have to help me. We have to get him the care he needs. Lex, what are you doing down here? I had to get the baby. He was crying. My father woke him. The baby? What baby? My little brother Julian. Lex-- He's asleep. And the baby was a figment of Lex's imagination? He did have a little brother named Julian. He died as an infant when Lex was still a kid. That must've been traumatic for him. Anyway, Chloe's with him now... ...and he seems perfectly fine. I don't get it. One second, he's thinking he's holding a baby... ...and the next, he's making complete sense. I don't understand how you could hide him in our barn without telling us. Dad, he was scared. And he thinks Lionel's trying to kill him. -He said Morgan Edge is still alive. -Morgan Edge. He's involved. Morgan Edge knows about your abilities. He knows that kryptonite can kill you. How could you not tell us that? -There's more. -More? He said Morgan Edge has had plastic surgery. Even if he showed up, we wouldn't know it was him. So Morgan Edge is alive, and he's had plastic surgery. Clark, don't you think that that sounds like another one of Lex's delusions? Come on. I know how hard it is for you to see Lex in this condition... ...but he needs psychiatric care. You think you know people... ...and you realize it's all just a facade. Lex, you know we only want what's best for you. Save the cloying maternal posturing for your own son, Mrs. Kent. I heard you all talking. Little Kent cabal... ...such a selective group, aren't you? And so secretive. Plotting to pack me off to the loony bin. I tried to stop him. I'm sorry. You're all watching me now? Lex, where are you going? To find Morgan Edge and prove I'm not crazy. You're either with me or against me, Clark. Choose right now. Clark. -Maybe you should wait in the car. -No. Lex, I've got your back. That's why I'm here. Lex, maybe this is the wrong place. No. No, this was the place. No, Edge was here. That was only yesterday. And these people look like they've been here a while. Don't you see? It's part of the cover-up, Clark. It wouldn't be that hard. Bring in a few machines, some immigrant labor. If you want to vanish, why go through the trouble? I don't know, Clark. Lex.... You gotta ask yourself... ...is there any possibility you might be imagining all this? Where's Morgan Edge? Where's Edge? Tell me where he is, or I'll stitch this seam through your hand! Lex, he doesn't understand a word you're saying. -Come on, let's go. -All right, Clark, you win. But I'm not imagining this, am l? Huh? -Let's go. -Huh? Am I imagining this? Go! Go! Come on. There's gotta be more evidence. Maybe we should call the sheriff, get her to bring in a forensics team. What do you want to do, Lex? Mr. Luthor. Darius. -You're alive. -We were worried about you, sir. You're in on this, aren't you? In on what, sir? Lex. -Come on, Lex. -Lex. Thank God. We were looking everywhere for you. Did you call her? -I don't even know who she is. -She's my psychiatrist. Don't you think it's a little convenient she just happens to be here? Security called me, Lex. You need to come with me. No. No, I'm not going anywhere. Somebody tried to kill me last night. I jumped through a window! Look, I have proof. The window was broken. You got angry during our last session... ...and threw this vase through the hall window. I'm gonna give you something. What is this? Huh? Some kind of hallucinogen? It's a sedative. No. No, you're working for my father. -Drugging me to make me crazy. -We need to get you to a hospital. All right, Mr. Luthor, everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right. Wait. Get on the ground! Both of you, on the ground! -Get on the ground! -Lex. -Lex, give me the gun. -No, Clark. If they take me to the hospital, I'll wind up dead or drooling in a padded cell. -Why would they want to do that? -It's a perfect plan, Clark. If the world thinks I'm crazy... ...no one will believe what I found out about my father and Morgan Edge! -Think about it, Clark. -Young man, your friend is very sick. These conspiracy theories are a symptom of his condition. Shut up! Maybe I am crazy, Clark. I honestly don't know anymore. But what if I'm right about all this? Are you really just gonna let them put me away? Hello? Are you here? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I got your message. I brought the food. Now tell me what I'm doing here in the middle of the night. Lex. What's wrong? There's a possibility he's being drugged. People are after him. I couldn't bring him to the farm, and I knew you knew this place. Why didn't you tell me about this? Because if Lex is right, everyone who's involved is in danger. And I promised myself I would never put you in that position again. What exactly are we mixed up in? I wish I knew. I need you to stay with him. Where are you going? I gotta get some evidence to Chloe that may prove that he's being drugged. She couldn't come here because we think she's being watched. Don't worry, Lana. I'll tell you everything. Be careful. He's not himself. Go. Hey. -Thanks for meeting me out here. -Of course. Find out if this can make someone hallucinate. I'll get it to my source at the pharmacology lab. I need to check out a Dr. Claire Foster and the two security guards. -lf there's a conspiracy, they're likely in on it. -I dug up some of Lex's medical records. Apparently, this isn't the first time he's had this kind of problem. -What are you talking about? -Well, after his brother died... ...Lex went right back to boarding school. And soon after that, he started exhibiting some pretty bizarro behavior. What do you mean, "bizarro"? His housemaster found him sitting in the bell tower in the middle of the night... ...singing a lullaby to a wrapped-up blanket. You know, I want to believe that this is a conspiracy... ...just as much as you do, believe me... ...but I think we need to start preparing ourselves... ...for the possibility that Lex really is losing his mind. Thank you for coming, Lana. I'm just glad you're letting me help. What is this? It's chamomile. It'll help you relax. Liar. What? Liar! -Lex, what's wrong? -You're trying to drug me! -I would never do that. -I shouldn't have trusted you. -Lex, wait. -Keep away from me! Lana? What's the trouble, mister? You know, I was never quite sure which of them was more out of touch with reality... ...Don Quixote, jousting with imaginary enemies... ...or his loyal lackey Sancho Panza... ...indulging his master's fantasies in spite of the danger to everyone else. Wait a minute. Where are you going? I'm going to find Lex. If I were you, I'd be careful. Lex is convinced you're responsible for everything that's been happening to him. Well, I'm touched by your concern, but you and I both know which of us is to blame. -Mr. Luthor, I don't think-- -No, no! I don't want to hear it. If you had listened to me, Lex would already be getting the help he needs... ...and Miss Lang wouldn't be here fighting for her life. Clark? Are you okay? But don't worry about me. My security personnel are well-equipped to protect me... ...and to find my son. Now, I strongly suggest the two of you go home... ...before you do any more damage. Miss Sullivan. The drug analysis came back. It was just a common sedative. Lionel's right, Chloe. -I really screwed up. -Maybe not. There are a lot of drugs that could make Lex see pink elephants. Now, the question is, how did it get into his system? The mansion. Everything's brought to him there. The food, the drinks. So for all we know, they could've been dosing him for weeks. How'd you do it? -Do what? -Get the drugs into Lex's system. I don't appreciate some farm boy coming in here and accusing me of a felony. Don't underestimate farm boys. -Baling hay can make you pretty strong. -Come on, you're gonna break my arm! Not if you tell me how you drugged Lex. It was the Scotch. -Tell me who you're working for! -I don't know who they are, all right? -All I have is a cell phone number. -Then call it. Tell them to be at the Smallville Stables by noon... ...with a bag full of Benjamins or I go to the cops. Kid, you're crazy. These people are not gonna pay you off. They're gonna kill you. I'll take my chances. Thank you, Mike. Lex. How'd you get in here, Lex? When people think you're insane and you're holding a rifle to their head... ...they tend to do what you ask. Put the guns down, all right? Sit down. Let's talk. Sure, Dad. We'll have a nice father-son chat. All right, sit down. About how you and Morgan Edge killed my grandparents... ...and how you're drugging me to make the world think I'm crazy. Hey, why not do the whole thing on Oprah, you know? Spill our dysfunctional guts on national TV like regular families do. All right, I understand why you're angry. I found out the same thing. The slum lord that owned my parents' tenement... ...hired Edge to blow it up for the insurance money. -Just like you planned it. -No. Lex, no. Lex, no, they were parents. No matter how badly they treated me, I would never hurt them. And I know deep down you don't want to hurt me. -You know what disappoints me, Dad? -All right, tell me. You hired pros to kill me. You always taught me, if you want something done right, do it yourself. Lex, the person responsible for this is Morgan Edge. I know where he is. Believe me, we can get justice. Lex. Lex! Listen to me. You'll wake the baby. It's-- It's Julian. -Are you seeing Julian again? -You know I can't take it when he cries, Dad. Julian isn't here, Lex. He's dead. -No! -No, Lex. You can't blame yourself for the baby's death. -Shut up! -I know you didn't mean to hurt him. I know. -Shut up! -Lex, it was an accident, Lex. -Tell me where Morgan Edge is now! -All right. All right. You have to be careful. Lex, please. Be careful. Please, Lex. I can't bear to lose another child. Hello? Tell me where to find the guy you're working for or I keep squeezing. Check it out. Jameson? I gave you a chance, Edge, but you really screwed it up. -Now drop the gun. -Your father's the one who screwed up. If we'd done it my way, you'd be dead by now. What are you talking about? You think you could've escaped if I wanted to kill you? It was your father's idea to make you look crazy instead. You're lying! It's true, Lex. Lionel's gone soft in his old age. He was willing to lose his parents, but he couldn't bear to lose another child. Neck still bothering you? Muscle aches, sleeplessness? All common side effects of the drugs. I knew I wasn't crazy. Tell me how you did it. Lionel thought of everything. First the dope, then getting the window fixed, then setting up the sweatshop. All little details to push you over the edge. How do I know it wasn't all you? Well, take a look around you. You think I'd be in digs like this if I hadn't cut a deal with your old man? You gotta admit, it was an elegant plan. Just like when he was a kid. Either you crack so completely that you can't form a coherent sentence... ...or anything you say sounds like the ravings of a madman. But he doesn't have to win, Lex. We can bring him down. Together. Maybe I'll just kill both of you. Hi, Kal. I had a feeling we'd see each other again. That's why I've been carrying these around. -You know each other? -We go way back. You're in on this too, Clark? -You're in on this too? -No, Lex... ...it's not what you think. Thank you. Don't thank me, Clark. You're part of this. I have to kill you too. You think you can just slither away from me, Clark? Lex, I'm your friend. I would never do anything to hurt you. What'd you do? Did you betray Edge too? Is that why he beat you to a pulp? Tell me, Clark! What's the price of a Judas kiss these days? I was right about you all along, Clark. You're not even human. That car hit him at 80 miles an hour. And he tossed it like a toy. Did you see him? See who? No, no, no. He was right there. He was right there, I swear! It's all right, Lex. We're gonna get you the help you need. No. No. He was right there. Look at the car! Look at it! Look! He was right there. Clark! Hey. How's Lex? Lex isn't doing so good. I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted to help him. The doctors say that you're doing better. I almost died, Clark. I know. I always thought you were being paranoid. About what? That being around you is too dangerous. But it's true. -Lana-- -It's okay, Clark. I know. You were only looking out for me. But you're right... ...I think I have to stay away from you. Dr. Foster. Good evening, Mr. Luthor. Why do these institutions always... ...stink of ammonia? How's Lex? Now that he's here, I can control his meds much more tightly. By the time he finishes his treatment, he won't have any short-term memory left. Wasn't that exactly what you wanted? Never believe for a second, doctor, that this is what I wanted. I love my son more than life itself. But he leaves me no choice. --------------------------------------------- -**- English Subtitles by jondon -**- Smallville Taiwan Fans Site
