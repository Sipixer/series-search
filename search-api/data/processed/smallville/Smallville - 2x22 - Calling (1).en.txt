It's Dr. Walden. There's been a complete normalization of his higher brain functions. Considering the source of the trauma, nothing surprises me. You mean the Kawatche caves? How does a linguist go into a coma deciphering a Native American language? If you had that answer, doctor, you'd be running the place. The day is coming. The day is coming. The day is coming! Lana. It's almost midnight. Yeah, I took a chance you'd still be up. You getting a head start on your term paper? I've gotta give the toast at Lex's rehearsal dinner. Makes European history seem like a breeze. - I'm supposed to guess what's in the box? - No. You're supposed to close your eyes. Don't peek. Okay. I know. It's not your birthday for another seven minutes... ...but I wanted to surprise you. You did. I get the feeling it's not in a good way. It's just, it's not really my birthday. It's just some date my parents picked off the calendar for the adoption papers. Maybe some of us want to celebrate the day you came into our lives. I never thought of it that way. Make a wish. I've been wishing for the same thing ever since I was 5. And now? And now I don't have to. She's standing right here in front of me. - Good morning, Mom. - How was your birthday party? So you're the one who told Lana. She knows we're not big on birthdays... ...but wondered if she could do something special. Thanks. I feel bad. We never had parties when you were little... ...but we were always nervous. - It's okay, I understand. I know... ...but what mother denies her son a birthday party? It's a part of childhood. All the mistakes you made with me, you can correct with the baby. - Wouldn't want to scar the little one too. - Thanks a lot. So, last night? - Are you prying? - Okay, never mind. - Hello. Look what the cat dragged in. - Lex, have you had breakfast? Thanks, but I can't stay. I just wanted to ask you and Mr. Kent for a favor. I know we've had our differences, so this might sound strange... ...but it would mean a lot to me. It's customary for the bride and groom to sit... ...with their parents at the rehearsal dinner... ...so since mine won't be there, I was wondering... ...would the two of you consider standing in? Lex, we would be honored. Great. That just leaves one open seat at the table. Right next to you, Clark. Any suggestions? Chloe. The one name you won't find on the list... ...for Smallville's biggest event of the century. Don't worry, it's not like I'm holding out... ...for my fairy godmother to bring glass slippers. I'm still not convinced Lex won't have me in a headset... ...running around with ice buckets. Is this what you were doing until 2:00 in the morning last night? Yeah. Well, I can't vouch for my calligraphy skills... ...but if you need any help, just let me know. Hey, you guys. I'd like a double espresso, please. Were you burning the midnight oil last night too? I was just... ...working on a toast for Lex's dinner. Chloe, ready to go? - Everybody okay? - Yeah. - Great. - Perfect. Just checking. Right. Well... We better get going. I have ashes to sweep and wicked stepsisters to undermine. - You didn't...? - No. I had a really good time last night. I was thinking maybe we could go out after the rehearsal dinner tonight. Maybe. Lana, is everything okay? If this is about last night, we can take it slow. Clark, I think last night may have been a mistake. I'm really busy. I'll call you later? Here's the revised seating chart for the rehearsal dinner. - Who are the people marked in blue? - Relatives who still talk to each other. How about the red? Family feuds and people who haven't spoken in at least five years. And the yellow ones scattered throughout? Buffer zones. Relatives who have no particular allegiance... ...and whose conversation won't incite a riot. If this medical career doesn't work out, you should consider the United Nations. - I'm not done yet. - By the way, put the Kents at our table. I asked them to sit with us at the dinner, fill in for my parents. Lex. I think it's great that you wanna make them a big part of this, but... But what? Don't you think this might be the right moment to reach out to your father? Helen. I'm touched that you want us to reconcile. But it's not gonna happen. Besides... ...the only family I need is you. I don't believe this. We should call the police. Is anything valuable missing? Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that, Helen. - They take anything important? - The vial of blood I drew from Clark. Tell me why you would even still have that. I thought I might need it someday, in case he got sick again. It wasn't labeled. There's no way anyone could connect it to Clark. Then why would anybody wanna steal it? It looks like somebody just broke open the refrigerator and took whatever was inside. The police think it may have been junkies looking for drugs. Or maybe somebody who wanted to make it look that way. Are you saying you think that I staged this? We're the only ones who knew about Clark's blood. - And you never told anybody else? - Of course not. Not even the man you're about to marry? Mr. Kent... Lex is not the man you think he is. Considering that you're about to spend the rest of your life with that man... ...and what you know about my family... ...you had better be right. I don't think it's a good idea that you seat Lana next to me. What happened? I wish I knew. Clark. None of us really understands the fairer sex. It's why we're so captivated by them. I went for it last night. - Don't tell me she shot you down. - No. It was the opposite. It was like this perfect moment, and then this morning... She wanted to pretend it never happened. You've upped the stakes, Clark, and she's scared. She figures if she folds now, she'll cut her losses. We're meant to be together. I've never been so sure about anything. Yeah, well, don't tell me, Clark. Tell her. - Hey. - Hey. Come on. - Lana, last night was a big deal for me. - Clark. Look, you don't have to avoid calling me if you don't feel the same way. No, it meant a lot to me too. Everything seemed so clear, but today it just feels a lot more complicated. Is this about Chloe? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about her... ...but there are three friendships at stake here, and I don't wanna risk losing ours. The friendship isn't gonna go anywhere. It'll just become something better. And what happens down the road if things don't work out? - Will our friendship survive that? - I don't know. Lana, I've wanted this for so long, I think it's worth taking the chance. The day is coming. Clark? Are you all right? The day is coming. Clark, what is it? I'm sorry, I have to go. The day is coming. The day is coming. The day is coming. - What do you think it means? - It's probably just delusional rambling. But your scans say his brain activity is normal again. The day is coming. Does that look normal to you? The day is coming. The day is coming... The cataracts, they're gone. They faded during the course of a day. - How do you explain that? - I can't. I know you want to see if he says anything else, but for his own safety... ...I need to sedate him. - The day is coming! The day is... The day is coming. I think it says, "The day is coming." - You learned how to read the symbols? - No, just an educated guess. It's what Walden kept saying before he escaped. I wonder how he wrote it. Apparently, he's developed the ability to emit some kind of energy from his hands. I think maybe it has something to do with whatever happened to him in the cave. Why are you telling me all this? You found him, Clark. Just wondering if you could shed any more light on the situation. I've already told you everything I know. These symbols... ...they look like the one on your barn. Lex, I told you. I don't know how to read this language. I believe you, Clark. Then what am I doing here? I thought, based on our mutual interest in the cave... ...we could solve this mystery together. I'm sorry, Lex. I'm as mystified as you are. I know who you are. Hey, Helen. Are you planning a rehearsal dinner or a peace summit? This whole wedding is starting to feel just as political. It's hard to know what side everybody's on. You're not having second thoughts, are you? Sorry, l... - It's all gotten very complicated. - Sounds kind of familiar. You wouldn't be talking about a tall, dark, handsome best man, would you? If you knew that Lex was keeping secrets from you... ...but he was being truthful about the important things like... Like the way he feels about you. Would that be enough? I guess you have to decide. Is the part of themselves that they're willing to share with you... ...better than not having them in your life at all? You don't really think he's hidden it in here, do you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talking about the valuable object... ...Lex stole from your office. Lex would never steal from me. If you believe that, what are you doing rummaging around in here while he's out? How do I know you didn't break into my office? Oh, my. It seems I've antagonized the lady of the house. Please, would you tell my son I dropped by to offer my best wishes? Oh, no. That would be difficult, wouldn't it? Because we'd have to explain that we ran into each other... ...when we were in here and I caught you snooping and... Oh, that could get really messy. Especially with your wedding day almost upon us. Get out. Can I ask you a question, Helen? Why are you marrying Lex? Because I love him. Dr. Walden? It's me, Clark Kent. Dr. Walden. Are you down here? Interesting, isn't it? - Mr. Luthor. - That... ...octagonal recess in the wall, I mean. I once had what you might call a keepsake that matched this. Exactly. Just disappeared from my office. It was that same day you rescued your mother and me. What are you doing down here? I have taken over conservatorship of the caves. - Didn't Lex tell you? - No, he didn't. He just doesn't want to admit defeat, and he's still fighting me on this. I ran into some of his security people down here. They were looking for that doctor. Dr...? Dr. Walden? Dr. Walden was obsessed with these caves. Well, I could understand why. Look at this. These symbols... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They are... Are they arranged in a different... ...order than they were before? That's strange. Don't you think, Clark? It's all Kawatche to me. If you see Dr. Walden, be careful. He could be dangerous. I don't get it. First the refined kryptonite, now the caves. What does Luthor want? I don't know, but I think we have a bigger problem. Dr. Walden can read Krypton language. He wrote it on the ceiling at the hospital. - You think he's figured out your secret? - Is that why you're so worried now? I'm not sure, but something's going on in that cave. The symbols have changed. - What does it say now, son? - "The day is coming... ...when the last son will begin his quest to rule the third planet." - Clark. - Don't you see? I'm the last son. Why humiliate yourself like this, Dad? When are you gonna accept the fact that you're not invited? You know, Lex, I'm not here to grovel for a place at your table. I wanted to tell you that... ...your restraining order to keep me out of the Kawatche caves has been rejected. Flat out. And you couldn't have had your lawyers tell my lawyers that over the phone? It's curious, though... ...your renewed interest seems to come right on the heels of Dr. Walden's escape. And Clark Kent seems to share your opinion. He was down there too, looking for your linguist. Lex! - I did it, Lex. - Dr. Walden. I finally read the wall. I know what it says. We'll talk all about it, but first we need to get you help. - Let the man tell us. - Stay out of this. The wall, doctor, what does it say? "The last son will rule the planet." Don't you see? It's Clark Kent! - I think that's a pretty big leap. - No. I've never seen more clearly in my life. - I know exactly what has to be done. - What is that, doctor? We have to kill Clark Kent. Before he destroys us all. Dr. Walden, you're confused. "Dear guests..." No, it's gotta be something else. "Friend..." "Friends and family..." First line's always the hardest. - Hey, Chloe, what's up? - Big news. Your friend Dr. Walden woke up. I wouldn't exactly call him a friend of mine. I was just wondering if you wanted to come out of retirement... ...and do the story with me. Hey, I appreciate the offer, but now really isn't a good time. I didn't mean right this second, Clark. I wish things could be like they were. Yeah, me too. I just feel like there's this huge rift between us... ...and no matter how hard I try, I can't get back to you. We'll get there, Chloe. It's just gonna take a little bit of time. Well, whatever happens, let's just... Let's promise to be honest with each other. I mean, you're a big boy, I'm a big girl. I think we can handle it. As long as we tell the truth. Okay, well, I'd better get going. You have your rehearsal dinner, and I have the Torch. So... Break a leg, Clark. Sorry I'm late. - Where have you been? - Business crisis. Don't worry, I'm all yours now. I need a moment with the best man. Okay. - Hello, Mrs. Kent. - Everything is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Hello, Lex. - Hey. - Mind if I have a word with your son? - No, go right ahead. - Is everything all right? - Dr. Walden paid me a visit. Nobody was hurt. He's on his way back to the hospital. - Well, that's good news. - Clark, he was ranting about you. - What'd he say? - That the writing on the cave wall says... ...you're going to rule the world. I'm gonna rule the world? - He's obviously nuts. - Of course he is. Unfortunately, my father was there. He heard the whole thing. He didn't believe him, did he? He quoted one of his favorite Elizabethan poets. Twixt truth and madness lies But a sliver of a stream He's not just gonna let this drop. I thought I'd warn you. I certainly do admire your work ethic, Miss Sullivan. - Late at night, here you are, still at it. - Yeah. Well, I wasn't invited to the rehearsal dinner, so... Yes, we have a lot in common. I spoke to the managing editor of the Daily Planet. It's all set. A weekly column on current affairs from the young person's perspective. I don't know how to thank you. Nurturing a promising young talent is a reward in itself. And I've got your first assignment. A complete investigative profile of Clark Kent. What possible interest could the Daily Planet have in a farm boy from Smallville? This isn't for the Daily Planet. They'll be in touch with you. No, this is for me. Just combine it with any research about his family you already have. I blew off my journalistic skepticism... ...and allowed myself to actually believe... ...that you were interested in just helping me. You're playing in the real world now, Miss Sullivan. You have to give to get. Mr. Luthor. I don't know what your interest is in Clark... ...but you can take the offer and shove it down your thousand-dollar pants. Clark's very lucky to have a friend like you. All that integrity. I wonder, though, if he had to make a choice, would he sacrifice his dream... ...out of loyalty to you? Any change? No, he'll be out for hours. Can I have everyone's attention, please? I think Lex picked me to be the best man because he knew... ...how comfortable I was speaking in front of people. I've been looking through every book from Socrates to Shakespeare... ...trying to find someone who can put into words the way... ...Lex and Helen feel about each other. But what I realized is, there are no words for it. That when you have it, you trust it. You believe in it. Take a chance on it. You're willing to sacrifice anything to keep it. No matter what the cost. - To Helen and Lex. - To Helen and Lex. Thanks. - Clark, are you all right? - Yeah... ...I just gotta get some air. - Clark. - Son. - What's the matter? - It's the key. There's something wrong at home. I have to go. I came looking for you. And I found the proof. You... ...are the one. Dr. Walden, listen to me. - You need help. - No. You need to die. Dr. Walden... Dr. Walden, no! - Doctor, you're making a mistake. - No, I'm not. I'm doing this for mankind. With the exception of Clark's migraine... ...I thought the evening was mercifully uneventful. What's wrong? Nothing. If we're gonna spend our lives together, we need to be honest with each other. You're always saying that. I found a file on Mrs. Kent in your bookshelf. It contained confidential medical records. From my office. I got that from a Disease Control agent who was investigating Mrs. Kent's case. You mean you bribed someone for it. I've told you... ...the Kents are very important to me. I was concerned about Martha's health. What were you looking for, anyway? Something that was stolen from my office. Do you think I was involved in the break-in? Please tell me you weren't. If you really believe I'm capable of that kind of deceit... ...maybe you shouldn't be marrying me. Maybe you're right. I had to pry it from his hand. It wasn't your fault, Clark. The man tried to kill you. He was delusional. Even the sheriff agreed, son. Walden was responsible for his own death. What if he was right? - What if I am a threat to mankind? - I'll never believe that. And neither should you. What does it mean? The day is coming when I'll begin my quest to rule? We don't know, son. But when and if that day does come... ...your mother and I both know that you'll do the right thing. His entire body's been burned beyond recognition. But look. Whatever he was holding here, it protected the skin it was covering. I've never seen anything like this. Send it to me. Send you what? The hand. I never got a chance to tell you how beautiful you look tonight. Clark, you scared me. Surprised me. Just wanted to see you. Kind of ran out on dinner. I thought your toast was really beautiful. I had a lot of inspiration. Sorry I've been so confused about us. It's just... I'm scared. So am I. You have so many secrets in your life. I know. I just don't want my feelings for you to be one of them. Neither do I. Kal-EI, it is time.
