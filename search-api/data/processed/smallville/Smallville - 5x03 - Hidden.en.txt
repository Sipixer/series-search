Look, just take out your key. - No. No. - Do it! Tom. - No. - You know what to do. Don't do it, Tom. - I'll kill him. - Don't listen to him. We can't let this happen. Tom, no! On three. - One, two, three. - Don't do it! Don't do it! I'm sorry. Hey, Gabriel. I'm surprised MIT even lets you converse... ...with us pedestrian Met-Uers so early. - <i>Chloe, you have to get out of town.</i> - I've been trying since yesterday. I had no idea "just the necessities" would take so long to pack. Listen to me, Chloe. Pretty soon, it's all gonna be over. I know it sucks to say goodbye. But if Smallville managed without their cyberwizard... ...I'm sure they'll survive without their star reporter. Chloe, you're the one person who will understand why I had to do it. You have to make people realize it wasn 't my choice. It's the only way. Gabriel, what are you talking about? How much time did I spend at the <i>Torch</i> helping you chase the big story? In one hour, you're finally gonna get it. What happens in an hour? Smallville's finally gonna be gone forever. DEFCON 1. Countdown commencing. Hi. Hi. That was the best night's sleep I've had in weeks. Thanks for listening. It's just about 6:30 on a sunny... - Oh, God. - Oh, my God. How did we fall asleep? I told you we should've gone to the Talon. How can that hurt so much? All right, look. Okay, my dad's not gonna be up for 15 minutes. Then we gotta get out of here. You gotta get out of here. Sticking around for breakfast sounds like fun. What? Pass me my shoe. "We won't fall asleep, I promise." What else are we gonna do at 2:00 in the morning? - Look, you're not mad, are you? - I'm furious. Come on. Hey, Clark, what...? Mr. And Mrs. Kent. I can explain. Clark and I made this decision together... ...so if you're angry, you should be angry at both of us. We... We're not mad. It... But this is an... You're <i>both...</i> ...in new territory. Lana, this is about a whole lot more than just you. So if you don't mind, I'd like to speak to my son alone, please. You sit down. Just... Just remember, I am 18. I've been in love with Lana since I was 7, so it's not like we rushed into something. Please tell me you were at least safe. - Yeah, Mom. - Safe? Safe has got nothing to do with this. You shouldn't be doing anything like this under our roof. - Like you didn't do it? - Clark. There's a lot of conversations we didn't have. - I didn't think we needed to. - You guys think I'm not normal. No, no. It... It... It's just that... You're just so much more vulnerable now... ...without your powers. Knock, knock. Okay, I just passed Lana flying out of here. What would she be doing here at 6:30 in...? So, chloe, clark said you're... You're off to Met U today. Looks like you're getting an early start. Not without one last "why me?" moment, though. I got a cryptic call from Gabriel Duncan. The tech guy from the <i>Torch?</i> Yeah, well, I guess today's my lucky <i>day...</i> ...because he said that Smallville is going to be history... ...in exactly 53 minutes. Have you spoken to Sheriff Adams about this, Chloe? I think I've used up my limit of "cry wolfs" with her. Why don't you find Gabriel. I'll speak to the sheriff myself. Early morning or late night? What the hell are you doing here? I've been admiring your sketches. I didn't mean to pry. No, of course not. You were just going through my things to get better acquainted. - You can't just come in here. - I didn't mean to rattle you. There was no answer, so I started to get concerned. Lex, I'm fine. Are you sure about that? Look, I just wanna talk about what you saw that day. Weren't you the person who told me I was hallucinating... ...last time I mentioned a spaceship? Lana... ...I might have appeared skeptical, but I still believed in you. That's why I sent an expert to the site. Whatever caused that crater was not a meteor. Have you talked to anyone else about this? Like Clark? You know, when you start rambling about spaceships and aliens... ...people kind of look at you funny. Well, they must not have the same faith in you that I do. You're not crazy. Sheriff Adams, can I speak to you for a minute? It's nothing to worry about. It's just a routine drill. It's a routine drill at the Hamstead farm, huh? What...? Wouldn't have anything to do with the missile silo in their field? Why don't you go on back to your truck. It's no secret the government put these things out here. I just thought they decommissioned them. Mr. Kent, thank you, we've got it all under control. Thank you very much. Why don't you just relax, sir, and let us do our job. Officers can stand down. There isn't even a missile in here. This is a false alarm. Not exactly. That signal did not come from in here. It was rerouted. There are at least 15 silos that are still active in the county. He could be in any one of them. Missile tracking unlocked. Enter revised coordinates for new point of impact. Gabriel. It's locked. We call it "plan B." It's for those of us who can't crush metal with our bare hands. Hello. Gabriel? Colonel Duncan? Is anybody here? Find anything? Does the fact that Gabriel's father was a not-so-retired military colonel count? These briefs are only a few weeks old. A colonel with an aerospace engineering degree from Purdue? Do you think that he might be the lighthouse keeper... ...for the local nuclear missiles? Wall of Weird times 100. Well, looks like Gabriel was giving you a run for your money. Yeah, I'd say he lapped me a few times. Why would he be so obsessed with meteor freaks? Oh, come on. Now, journalistic curiosity is one thing... ...but papier-mâchéing your walls with them is another. Call me conventional, but shouldn't this have been a red flag for Gabriel's dad? I just... If Gabriel was so determined to go atomic on the meteor epidemic... ...why didn't his dad stop him? Looks like he tried. I expected results by now. - Mr. Luthor... - Why isn't this open? That laser uses technology so cutting edge... ...even the military doesn't know about it. We've tried. Luthorcorp doesn't believe in finite solutions. I'm not sure you understand, sir. We've used every chemical compound that exists. Every alloy of metal, every method known to man. Which would clearly suggest that this craft isn't known to man. So I recommend you and your team start thinking out of the box. - I'm... I'm trying to explain... - For every question, there is an answer. Now, if you find that task too challenging... ...I'll recruit someone who doesn't. Find a way in. Wait. I didn't see this before. That's because it wasn't there. I don't know how they'll check 15 silos in 40 minutes. Well, neither can you anymore, Clark, if that's what you're thinking. - It's rough being regular flesh and blood. - Never stopped you. Of all the people in Smallville, you're the only one he warned. - He just wants me to tell his story. - Either way, he trusts you. Maybe we don't need to search every silo. - Hello. - <i>Gabriel. Hi, l... I need your help.</i> I started to leave town, then I was freaked out when I was driving. And then this dog ran out on the road and l... Chloe, slow down. What happened? L... I guess I must have overcorrected, and I ran my car into a ditch. And I can't get it started now. I'm really scared. - Can you help me? - Where are you? Route 87, near the old mill. Okay, just hang on. I'll be there as soon as I can. Tell me what the symbols mean. I'm not buying it, Dad. You're in there. You've been obsessively drawing these for weeks. They're identical to the markings on the ship. You'll never open it. Only he can open it. Gabriel, I'm sorry. Everything happened so fast. - I didn't know who to call. - It's all right. Come with me. - You'll be safe there. - Gabriel. Which silos did you activate? I trusted you. Whatever your reasons for doing this, killing's not the answer. You're wrong, clark. It's the only answer. Clark! Clark! No! - You can't just leave him, he's gonna die! - Don't fight me. - Clark! No! - Chloe, you have to trust me! No! Farmer heard the shot and found him on 87. Male, 18, gunshot wound to chest. Massive bleeding. Vitals are unstable. We need to intubate now. Prep him for the OR immediately. - Clark? - How serious is it, doc? Can't tell until I open him up. It looks like the bullet pierced his lung. - Bullet? - Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask <i>you...</i> ...to stay in the waiting area. Gabriel, Clark could die out there. In 20 minutes none of it will matter, Chloe. Missile trajectory locked. Latitude 37 north. You're gonna kill everyone in Smallville. How could you do that? It's not that difficult. The fail-safes were programmed back in 1979. It only takes a moderate genius to bypass them. You don't watch your dad do the same drill for 10 years... ...and not pick up a thing or two. Don't look at me like that, chloe. You're safe here, okay? With me. Besides, you're getting what you always wanted. The story of a lifetime. You actually think I care about that right now? You should care. The last meteor shower left 10 times as much rock to infect people... ...than the last one. Pretty soon, there's gonna be more psychos running around this town. This is the only way to end it. It's my one chance to be a hero. So you're exterminating a few meteor freaks... ...by sacrificing the lives of innocent people? Innocent? Every single one of those mutants was innocent before the meteor showers. My dad warned me to stay away from the rocks... ...because they turned people into mutants. Your dad? Were those his articles on the wall? He tried to warn people. He said the meteors were destroying the town. No one would listen. Then during the last one... ...he became one of them. You know, a lot of people think special abilities are a gift. You didn't have to kill him just because he wasn't normal anymore. He asked me to. No one wants to live like that, Chloe. Pretty soon, no one will have to. I don't even know if you can hear me... ...but I need you to know... ...that from the first moment that I saw you... ...I knew that no one could make me happier than you. But I also knew that you'd never change. You'd... You'd always be running around, trying to save the day. All those times I pulled away... ...it's because I knew this day would come. - You're not supposed to be in here. - Please, you need to clear the room. Charging 200. Clear. Charging 300. Clear. Charging 300. Clear. Three-fifty. Clear. Okay, I'm calling it. Time of death, 7: 18 a.m. Oh, my God. Miss Lang. Miss Lang. Oh, no. Mr. And Mrs. Kent... ...we did everything we could... - No. ...but we lost him. Doctor, we have a problem with the Kent boy. Two minutes to launch. Lockdown initiated. Seal outer doors. Security level four. Warning systems on. Access denied. Final launch sequence initiated. Access denied. Lockdown complete. Sixty seconds to ignition. Oh, God. Why couldn't you understand? This is the only way! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... ... five, four, three, two, ignition. Hello, Kal-EI. How do you know to call me that? You're my son. Jor-EI? And I hope the time is coming when you will call me father. I was... I was just at the hospital. How did...? How did you get me here? The portal in the cave. When this body was activated by the crystal, it became a... An oracle of Kryptonian knowledge. A vessel for me to inhabit if ever you should need me. That time was now. Am I dead? Your mortal journey is over, yes. But your imminent destiny is too important to be sacrificed. You will return... ...with all your natural gifts. Unfortunately, this rectification does not come without a price. The life of someone close to you will be exchanged for yours. No. No, I would never ask for that. You already did when you decided to relinquish your powers and disobey me. It was your choice. Then just don't bring me back. It's too late. For everything in nature, there is a balance. The life force that has been returned to you will soon be taken from... From someone you love. You're about to face your darkest hour, my son. But remember... ...the lessons that we learn from pain... ...are the ones that make us the strongest. Always know that I love you. Clark. The hospital lost our son. If I had any idea what happened... ...I wouldn't have to call the police, now would I? Listen, I want you to get ahold of Sheriff Adams and send her over there. - I have to call you back. - Clark. Oh, Clark. Clark. Son. They told us you were dead. Yeah... I was. - Jor-EI? - Yeah. He returned your powers, didn't he? I'm not human anymore. It was the only way I could come back. We heard about a missile malfunction. You stopped it, didn't you? It's not easy to sacrifice the thing you want the most... ...to save other people. We're so proud of you, clark. The real sacrifice would've been not coming back at all. Son. After all those threats... ...Jor-El just decided to offer to give you your powers back? He didn't ask for anything in return? No. Mr. And Mrs. Kent? Clark. Lana. I heard about clark's resurrection. You know, I've... I've never really believed in miracles... ...but I've certainly done my share of asking for them today. Me too. But I think that we have different reasons. It's clark's medical file. That's confidential. I heard you asked for it at the hospital. All of his test results came back normal. When are you gonna realize, Lex, that he is just like the rest of us? Do you really believe that? Or is that what you have to tell yourself to stay in a relationship with him? You've had doubts about him too. You can't deny it. I was wrong. Believe me, there's nothing unusual about Clark... ...except his ability to see the good in people who don't deserve it. I think you're forgetting something, Lana. Whatever new lie he told you... ...however he swept it under the rug... ...a normal person doesn't rise from the dead. Aren't you gonna give your old dad a hug? I was told you were missing from Belle Reve. Man, I don't understand. You've been nearly catatonic for weeks. Didn't I just overhear you say you'd been looking for miracles all day? Looks like I'm it. So maybe now you can tell me why you've... You've been wandering <i>around...</i> ...mumbling things like "Krypton" and "Kal-EI." Krypton? Kal-EI? I <i>don't...</i> The last thing I remember is standing here arguing with you. That was weeks ago. Okay. You don't recognize these? Looks like something from the cave. What is it? I found you carving them with a corkscrew. Oh, wasn't I creative. I wish that I could unlock the labyrinth of my subconscious. I'm sorry to disappoint you, son. I have my father back. What's to disappoint? If anything, I'd say this is cause for celebration. When Kansas didn't merge with Oklahoma today... ...I kind of guessed you were involved. Looks like you're okay. You don't look too bad yourself. For a dead guy. I heard what happened at the hospital. You went and got your powers back, didn't you? I didn't have a choice. I know how much you've dreamt of <i>having...</i> ...a bland, mundane, generic life... ...but being normal is highly overrated. And besides, it makes my whole sidekick role a lot easier... ...if you can bring super-duper strength to the table. I mean, not that we didn't make a great team out there today... ...minus the whole part where I was kidnapped and you were shot. So... ...are you healing, or how does that work exactly? Unscathed on the surface. But that's not what's going on underneath, is it, Clark? I guess I'll never be able to escape who I really am. Back to the lies... ...and hoping no one will ever ask to see the scar. Namely, Lana? - We've never talked about Lana... - That's because we don't need to, clark. I'm a big girl now. I do have one confession. I really liked being the only one who knew all about... ...you know, you. For lack of a cheesier word, it just made it... ...special. But if you honestly believe that you can stay with Lana and not tell her... ...I think you're seriously kidding yourself. I don't have a choice. I can't expect her to react like you did. But don't you think you owe her the choice? I can't take that risk. I've risked too much already. And now someone else is gonna have to pay for it. Clark, is everything okay? What's going on? I never should've given up my powers. Why didn't I listen to him? Chloe, I think I've made a terrible mistake. Subtitles by
