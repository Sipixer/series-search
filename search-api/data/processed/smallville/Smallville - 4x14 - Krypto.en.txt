Hello...? Hey, fellas. Hercules. What happened in there? I don’t know. Get him inside. Load up! Where the hell’s Einstein? Call him back. Hey, this is Chloe. I’m not in right now, so leave a message and I’ll get right back to you. Hey, Chloe, it’s Lo. I’m officially out of the dorm and on my way back to the Kents’. But I realized I’m still getting my mail at your place. Can you bring it by in the morning? Okay, thanks. Bye. Oh, my God. What have I done? Oh my God Ok... I didn't see you. Ok... We’re gonna get you out of here. Ok You’re gonna be fine. I know you’re gonna be fine. Everyone I’ve ever hit was all right. Smallville - Season 4 Episode 14 "Krypto" Hey. I was just getting in. What are you guys doing? We seem to have a visitor. A hungry visitor. Hey, he’s supposed to be tied up in... the barn I chained him to a post for a second so that I could get my stuff out of the car and well... Yeah. I had him chained right there. Okay, that’s just bad wood. That’s not my fault. How’d that post break? Oh, my allergies... Where did you say you found him? Actually, I kind of... hit him. You hit him? With your car? No, with my fist. I was gonna call the vet, but when I got in just now he seemed fine. I think you need to make some fliers in the morning. That way, maybe we can figure out who he belongs to. He’s got a collar. I’m sure somebody’s missing him. Fine with me. Actually, it might be fun to have a dog around. Maybe if we can’t find out who owns him, we can keep him. Why don’t we just see what happens tomorrow, Clark? Yeah, don’t get too attached. I’m going to bed. We should all get some sleep. You know, I’m gonna do my chores. It’s three o’clock in the morning. Dad, since Lois is staying here, if I’m gonna do my work at super speed, I have to do it when she’s not looking. All right, then why don’t you start with that? Come on. Well, at least I don’t have to hide anything from you. - Hey, Chloe. - Hey. Lois, uh, had her mail forwarded to my apartment. Is she around? Yeah, she’s probably still in the, uh...shower. Who’s the puppy? We don’t know his name. Lois found him. She’s bringing home strays now, huh? How is the new tenant? Lois? Well, she, uh, re-recorded our answering machine... ...uses all the hot water, oh, and she took over my bedroom. - She’s doing great. - Ok. How are you? I don’t know. It’s just kind of hard to be myself with her around. Yeah, but now you got this guy. You can be yourself around him, right? And I’m always around. Ooh, it’s cold. I’m gonna go see if I can find her. All right. I’ll be right in. Ok Come on. We’ll see if this’ll hold you. Good boy. Stay. Holy... Hey Looks like you got a secret too. Where are you from? Good boy. - What did you do? - What? Oh, I, um... it must have rolled. Through a fence? Yeah, weird, huh? Yeah. Yeah, weird. But, I mean, it happens, you know? The emergency brake must’ve slipped or something. It’s old, you know? It’s an old tractor. It is old. Anyway, I’m gonna get going. - I’ll see you guys around. - Bye. Just playing with Skippy here. We’re not gonna call him Skippy. Okay, Lois, what would you like to call him? Let’s see. He’s annoying, and I can’t seem to get within ten feet of him without getting sick... I think we should call him Clarkie. Come here, Clarkie! Come here, boy! I made him some fliers. He can be somebody else’s allergy now. You know what? I don’t think we’re gonna have to use those. I found one of those microchip ID tags under his skin. I think they can scan it at the animal shelter. I spent all morning on these I’ll be right back. I have to tell my parents something. Don’t give me that look. Clarkie. We should probably get your mom a new pot roast while we’re out. Sit, Clarkie. Good dog. Hey, Shhh Hi How can I help you guys? - We found this dog. - Actually, I found him. Well, hit him actually. Not hard. We call him Clarkie. We don’t call him Clarkie. Is it the “ie” part you don’t like? Because... we could always just make it Clark. But then that would get really confusing, and hey... maybe you should consider changing your name. You could be Skipper. Anyway, uh, we think he might have an ID chip. We were wondering if you could scan it for us. If it’s not too much trouble. Um, well, sure, I guess. Whoa! Easy, boy. Yeah. He doesn’t seem to have a lot of love for you. Maybe I should do that. Bless you. Thanks Luthorcorp? You’re kidding. Huh. It must be one of those lab dogs or something. Lab dogs? I’d be happy to take him off your hands and return him for you. Actually, you know what? Um, that’s okay. We’ll take care of it. Thanks. Come on, boy. Come on. I should probably get your name and address, though... in case someone from LuthorCorp calls. It’s policy. Would you mind taking him back to the farm? I’m gonna go talk to Lex. Terrific. Come on. Let’s go sneeze a while. Heel, Clarkie. Thanks Hey, Josh Guess who just showed up? Einstein Yeah, Some guy named Clark Kent’s keeping him out on his farm. That’s good news little brother. ‘Cause I was thinking that we were gonna have to rob that truck tomorrow with just this dummy. Why do you have to do that? What do you care? It’s just a dog. How’s he doing, anyway? It can still hold a few hours, He’s got a couple hours left in him long enough to help us get Einstein back. And then we can shoot them both up and... get their strength back for tomorrow. So how come you guys couldn’t get the effect to last longer anyway? I don’t know, Zack. I was just a trainer. The plan’s back on, little brother. Let’s close up shop, huh? Yeah sure. Genevieve... What a surprise. If you’re looking for Jason, I sent him to Metropolis on a business errand. Actually, I came here to see you, Lex. Oh, I didn’t realize we had any more business to discuss. Drink? I take it my son has proven to be a good hire. Excellent. He’s taken a real passion for the project I’ve given him. I gather this project does not require him to relocate out of Smallville. Highly doubtful. I underestimated you, Lex. Well, that’s a common mistake. But not one I usually make. Seems that headstrong young men have... become my blind spot. Ask Jason. And now you. You asked me to give Jason a position at LuthorCorp. I’m not sure I understand your problem. You know exactly why I wanted you to hire Jason. Get him away from Lana Lang. But instead, you decided to co-opt him for your own purposes. Genevieve... paranoia is not a very attractive quality in a woman. I’m just trying to protect my son. Well, maybe you should get together with my father and write a parenting book. I bet it’d be a bestseller. Then you’re no longer interested in how your father was released from prison? I’ve chosen to believe my father truly is reformed. Therefore, the question of his guilt or innocence no longer bothers me. But it’s great seeing you again, Genevieve. And you too, Lex. Give my best to Jason. It’s a shame he won’t be able to help you... find what you’re looking for. It’s hard to believe he’s as strong as Clark says he is. He certainly is a beautiful dog. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I know what you’re thinking. Well, it might be nice for Clark to have a dog. It’s been kind of a lonely year for him. Well, wait a minute. What happens when Clark goes off to college next year, huh? Who winds up having to take care of that dog? Me. Lois, it’s time for dinner! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You see? Well, remember when Clark did that? He was only three. It’s not funny. Hey! What happened? That’s my T-bone! Oh, bad dog. Clark Grab a stick. I was just about to break. Lex, is LuthorCorp doing experiments on dogs? I’m not really sure that’s any of your business. Lois found a stray dog. It has a LuthorCorp ID tag. Are you? Clark, when I took over the company, I found quite a few irregular experiments being conducted at my father’s request. One of them involved animal testing. What were they doing? If I remember correctly, they were... mixing meteor rock with a steroid to enhance canine strength. Why would your dad be interested in making super-powered dogs? If I understood my father’s insanity, Clark, I’d be a much happier man. But I suppose in this case, there were military applications. I guess I’ll never really know for sure. The results were inconclusive. I had animal rights activists picketing the site so I closed it down. I was told the dogs were destroyed. Evidently not all of them. Is it exhibiting any problems? Is that your way of asking me if it has super strength? No No, I assume you’d tell me that because... I’d have quite a liability on my hands if he did. The dog’s perfectly healthy. Well, then I’m sure the Kent farm will be... a perfect home for him. Sorry about dinner. I guess it’s just sandwiches tonight. Jonathan? Jonathan! Stay back Jonathan! - Oh my god, Jonathan! - Stay back Martha... - Get away! - No! Get away! Get away from him. Sweetheart. Are you ok? Are you all right? That's ok. Lois, get the car keys. We have to take him to the hospital. Dad, what’d they say? Well, the doctor said he’d never seen a dog that could bite clean through bone before. Look at this. The store owner’s in a coma. He was attacked by something that could pulverize a steel door. Now the police think it’s a bear, but... You think it was the dogs. Someone’s obviously controlling these dogs and using them. Look, the only people that knew we had the dog were Lex and that guy at the animal shelter, and since the boy billionaire probably doesn’t go around robbing convenience stores... We should check it out. Well, let’s do that first thing in the morning, all right? Um, Clark, would you give me a hand signing out, would you? Look, son, I know that you’re... really attached to this dog, but I’m worried he could be dangerous, even to you. I know, that’s why I have to find out who’s doing this and stop them. No, Clark... son, it won’t make any difference. If they had anything to do with putting that man in a coma... then they’re gonna have to be put down. Dad, when you and mom found a super-powered boy in a cornfield, you didn’t give up on me just because I might be dangerous. You raised me. You gave me a chance. He’s a good dog, Dad. Someone’s just using him to do bad things. We should give him a chance. I want you to leave here with me tonight. Why? Because of Countess Marguerite Isobel Theroux? You know that name, don’t you? Is this what Lex has you doing? Researching 17th century witches? You’re incapable of giving a straight answer, you know that? So apparently when Isobel was condemned to die, she vowed to rise again through one of her descendents. You knew that that was Lana, didn’t you? That’s why you had me bring her to Isobel’s tomb in Paris because you knew that if she received the mark then she was the one. Which means it’s-- it’s my fault... that everything’s happening to her. You can’t blame yourself. How could you use me like that? Look, it’s not safe for you to stay here. Well, I’m not leaving Lana. Well, perhaps you’ll change your mind when you hear the rest of the story. Isobel was condemned by a woman named Gertrude. Isobel vowed... that when she rose from the dead, that she would wipe out all of Gertrude’s heirs. We’re Gertrude’s ancestors, Jason. So you think that Lana is going to kill you? No But Isobel will, and who knows when she’ll return? Mother, I walked out on Lana once before. I’m not gonna do it again. Then you’re in love with a girl... that may kill our entire family. What is it, an obstacle corse? Oh, crap! You see him anywhere? Come here, Clarkie! Come here, boy! Wow. Could the dander get any thicker in here? You know, I’ve been thinking. Clarkie might’ve had something to do with what happened at that convenience store, but I don’t think he hurt that guy. There wasn’t any blood on him when I found him. We’re not gonna call him Clarkie, okay? We’re gonna call him Bear or Bandit or something. Uh, no and no. What is all this? It’s LuthorCorp payroll. They’re gonna hit an armored truck. And it’s happening right now. Lois, call the police. I’m gonna see if I can catch up with these guys. Hold on there, Forrest Gump. What are you gonna do, run? We brought my car, remember? Lois, look-- Unh-unh. We can call the cops on the way. You are so weird sometimes. You know, can you go a little bit faster? Hey, you were gonna be hoofing it about ten minutes ago. Besides... I don’t want to hit anything. It should be right here. Well, it’s not. Let’s go, let’s go, come on! Get the money. Grab the money, come on! Stop yelling at me. I dropped the bag, okay? Wait, turn left, turn left. Why? Just do it! What is this, another one of your famous hunches, or are we just on a little scenic route here? - Okay, stop here. - Wha-- where? - Here ! Stop here! - Okay! Go, go Grab the bags, let's go! I am. Come on, faster! Those guys back there don’t look so good. Forget these screwed-up guards. Get the money. Let’s go! All right. Come on. Buckle up, little brother. Come on. Can you go see if you can help those guys? It’s all right, buddy. We’ll get you out of here. Clark? What’s he barking about? I don’t know, but in five minutes it won’t matter. We burn the truck, the dogs, everything. All the evidence. What-- We’re gonna be in the Keys before anyone knows we’re gone. Where’s Einstein? - What the hell? It’s that guy from the animal shelter. Well, well, well. Looks like someone has some explaining to do. Oh Well you just had to be a hero, didn’t you? Sometimes heroes get burned. Are you sure about this? He saw our faces. We can’t let him walk. This wasn’t part of the plan. The plan is working, okay? We got the money and we’re almost out of here. You’re not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? Huh? No I didn’t think so. Come on. Make a wish, little brother. Going somewhere? This guy’s quite a hero from what I understand. Yeah, I hope my dad lets me keep him. Doctor, you didn’t notice anything unusual about any tests you ran on him, did you? Like what? Well, he just seems really strong sometimes and he likes to get into things. Well, if anything, I’d say his strength is a little below average. You’ve got a perfectly normal, healthy dog here. You thought of a name yet? I was thinking of calling him Krypto. Interesting name. Well, I better be going. Thanks, Dr. Klein. You’re welcome. Krypto What does it mean? Friendly. It’s because his background is so... cryptic. Speaking of his background, I went out to the scene of the robbery and saw my armored truck. From the look of the back doors, I can only assume it was the handiwork of some very strong dogs. Lex, you told me I could keep him back when you thought he was a failed experiment. But Clark, if the experiment didn’t fail, this dog could be dangerous. But he’s not dangerous now. He saved my life. I’ll take my chances on his loyalty. So do you mind telling my why I was up until two in the morning researching Jason’s family tree? I mean, not that it wasn’t, you know, halfway interesting, it’s just... you definitely got your place in the Guinness Book of Strangest Last-Minute Requests. I, uh, saw him downstairs talking to his mom. It was obviously a heated discussion, but uh... when he came up to the apartment, he didn’t even mention it to me. Well, did you hear what they were talking about? No But it clearly rattled him. Chloe, he’s keeping something from me. You know, I don’t even know who I can trust anymore. Did you find anything? Not much. I mean, I can only go back as far as his mom’s grandmother. After that, it’s like someone just chopped off a part of his family tree. There’s nothing there. I can tell you that she comes from a town called Castelnois de Montmiral. That’s all I know. Well, except that... Lana, are you okay? Chloe... this is the town that my ancestors come from. And Isobel Theroux. Well, on a scale of weird to ten... Genevieve’s grandmother is the one who moved Isobel’s tomb into that church in Paris. Why would anyone move a witch’s tomb into a church? I think that’s something you need to ask Jason. If you’re looking for my son, he’s not here. I’m just returning something. Yes, yes. How’s the research coming? I’m not sure I know what you mean. Yes, you do. I mean Isobel. I understand your hesitation. When I found out that you’d been... hired by my son, I put a few of the pieces together and saw a connection. You, hmm.. you’re Genevieve Teague’s boy. Yes Of course You can’t trust her, Jason. Of course, you can’t trust my son either, but I think you know that. And I suppose you’re gonna tell me I can trust you, though. What’s this? Open it. I think it might help you. Done. Well, took you long enough. Now you just have to fix the dining room table, the window, the fence, and... I thought bathing him was supposed to help with my allergies. Well, maybe you’re allergic to the soap too. Maybe I’m allergic to you. Can you grab me a towel please? Thanks. So, what are we gonna call him? And don’t give me any of this Skipper crap. I was thinking we could call him Krypto. Why, because he’s so cryptic like you? I don’t think so. Why not? Because I think it’s dumb. You can call your next dog Krypto. Look, it’s not that hard. Max, Lucky, Rocky, Bailey, Scamp, Monty, Bud? Hey, you’re gonna have to pick one of those if you want to keep him. Really? You know, when I was a little girl, we had a dog that looked just like this one. Maybe that’s why I liked him so much right away. His name was Shelby. I can live with that. Well, it beats Clarkie. yeah... Come on, Shelby! Let’s go outside. Nice catch! Come on, boy!
