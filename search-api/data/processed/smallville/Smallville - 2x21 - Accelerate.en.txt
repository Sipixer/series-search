and get your butt out of there! - I don't think she can hear you, Pete. - Guys, hit the mute button, okay? Lance! Oh, Lance! Oh, I saw it again! Hello? Who's there? - Would you like some tea? - Yes, please. - I've got an elephant. What do you have? - Rhinoceros. Would you like an apple? Good. Lana? I got a hippopotamus. You're so big. Why are you scared? Do you want to play with me? Lana, what's going on? I thought I... I guess... The lights went out, and... I guess the movie creeped me out. I thought I saw... Thought you saw what? - Nothing. - Let's get out of the dark. You sure you're okay? You look like you've seen a ghost. That's my favorite dress. You're... You're not real. - I am too real. - No, you died. Lana? Chloe's dad said you were up here. Lana, what is it? Clark. It sounds so ridiculous. You can tell me anything, Lana. You know that. Clark, do you believe in ghosts? We used to come out here all the time. We'd make little boats... ...out of flowers and float them downstream. They always sunk before they got around the bend. Is this where she drowned? It was raining... ...and the bridge was slippery. The next thing I knew... It's okay. Okay. Funny thing is... ...Emily always believed in ghosts. Whenever a candle flickered or a curtain rustled... ...she'd insist it was my mom trying to talk to me. As much as I wanted to believe her, I always knew it was make-believe. Maybe this is her way of showing me that the dead can communicate with us. If she is a ghost, why do you think she waited so long to contact you? I don't know. There's just gotta be a rational explanation for this girl. Have you kept in contact with her parents? No, they split up after the accident. I don't know where her mom is, but her dad moved to Grandville. Maybe you're not the only one who's seen her. Didn't you see the "No Trespassing" signs? Mr. Dinsmore, it's me, Lana Lang. Oh, well, look at you. All grown up. Mr. Dinsmore, this is... This is going to sound strange... ...but I think I saw Emily. What is this, some kind of sick joke? I don't mean to upset you. It's just... ...I've seen her twice. We figured if anybody else had seen her, it'd be you. Sure, I've seen her... Whenever I hear her favorite song... ...or see a young girl jumping rope in the park. Losing a child is something a parent never gets over. Now, if you'll excuse me. Mr. Luthor, I would think quick decision-making would be your forte. That's why I made the quick decision to put Helen in charge of the wedding. Well, I don't see her here, and we're three weeks away and counting. - Hello. - I knew you had your vices, son... ...but I didn't realize gluttony was one of them. Oh, I suppose if there's anyone who's an authority on the seven deadly sins... ...it's you, Dad. Amaretto truffle. Could I have some water, please? The liqueur seems to be overpowering the butter. Thank you. As much as I value your epicurean input, Dad... ...I'm curious, why are you in Smallville? I wanted to give you my gift in person... ...since it's obvious by now that I won't be receiving a wedding invitation. You offered the woman I love $ 100,000 to leave me. I did you a favor, Lex. That was the ultimate test of loyalty. And she passed with flying colors. You should be thanking me. Thanking you? Well, my thank-you note must be lost in the mail... ...along with your invitation. Go on, open it. - A Caribbean honeymoon. - Your own private island. I'll throw in the LuthorCorp jet as well. Why? I just want you to be happy, Lex. Clark, when you turned in your press pass... ...you relinquished all of your computer privileges. I don't mean to be hall monitor, but it is school policy. - I'm trying to help Lana. - Of course you are. What are you saving her from today? She's being haunted by a girl who died six years ago. Okay, I'm piqued. Go on. She thinks it's a ghost. I'm not so sure. It's not like people haven't come back to life around here. Even though it goes against my natural slant toward all things Wall of Weird... ...I think there's another explanation for this. Lana's been through a lot in her life. Maybe this haunting is a way she's dealing with it through her subconscious. You think she's seeing things that aren't there? No, I think to her they're very real. - She's not crazy. - I wasn't saying she's crazy. All I'm saying is, there's a lot of things about Lana that you don't know. I mean, you don't hear her crying in her room at 3:00 in the morning. What you see is just a mask. - Why are you telling me this? - Because she talks to you. Regardless of what's going on between us, she's still my friend. Chloe. Thanks. Lock up when you're done. Sweetheart, I've been looking all over for you. - Everything's different. - What do you mean? Where are all the bunnies? Honey, we can talk about that when we get home. Okay? This is our home, Daddy. No, not anymore, sweetheart. Our home's in Grandville. I don't understand. Lana said I died. Lana doesn't know what she's talking about. Yes, she does. She's my best friend. Emily... ...get in the car. No. I'm not going. I don't want to be locked up anymore. I want to be a normal girl. I want to play with Lana. You have to listen to me, Emily. You are never to see Lana Lang again. - Do you understand? - You can't tell me what to do. I'll do whatever I want. Clark, couldn't the boneyard visit have waited till after the rain stopped? It's the only way to disprove the zombie theory. Yeah, well, if this Emily girl really is a ghost... ...I really don't think she'd appreciate you scoping out her coffin. Pete, here it is. "Emily Eve Dinsmore. Loving child, blessed angel." The body hasn't been touched. Where did she go...? Clark? Let me in, Lana. I know why you're scared of me. I saw my grave. But I'm not dead, Lana. Who are you? I'm Emily, silly. - What do you want from me? - My daddy said I can't see you anymore. Did you do something bad? Lana. She's here. Where? - I swear it, Clark, she was right here. - Lana, it's okay, I believe you. Emily's not a ghost. I saw her. In the graveyard. It's where I found this. Her father gave it to her because she wanted a necklace like mine. But it can't be Emily. She couldn't still be 10 years old. I don't know who it is. But I think I know how she's able to just appear out of nowhere. I think she moves faster than we can see her. - How? - I'm not sure, but... Hey... ...at least we know you're not losing your mind. Thanks, Clark. Back from Metropolis so soon? Awfully long drive for quality health care. You tailing me, Lex? I hope not. - A bit obsessive, don't you think? - I heard you were here. - I wanted to make sure you were okay. - I came to visit a former employee. He's just been admitted. Unfortunately, he's still unconscious. He must have been an exceptional worker to merit a visit from the CEO. I like to think that I treat everyone at LuthorCorp as part of the family. Oh, that would explain their lack of loyalty. Have you become so cynical that you read ill will into my good intentions? I'm just wondering why you're spending so much time in Smallville lately. You may not believe me, I'm sure you won't... ...but I've always tried to be a good father to you, son. I worry about you. Son, these obsessive, paranoid tendencies... The danger with indulging them is that you lose perspective. And you turn your back on what truly matters. Lex? Coming? He's sleeping. I tried to wake him up. He needs to take care of me. I have nowhere to go. - What's your name? - Emily. He's my daddy. I think our daddies are friends. Mine was just in here. He's a bad man. - Did he do something to your daddy? - He took the bunnies away. - What bunnies, Emily? - The ones in the back yard. Maybe I should talk to your mommy. Is she here? Come on, stay close. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. This must be what you saw at the Talon. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. Who needs human companionship when you could have a Gabby Abby? I remember this. I gave it to Emily for her ninth birthday. Last entry's from the day before she died: "I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. Lana and I are going to the river. We're going to be best friends forever." Lana. Oh, my God. - Clark, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let's get out of here. You did the right thing, calling the police. - He was trying to clone his daughter? - More than try. We think he succeeded. Whoever's funding him's sure got a lot of money. Dinsmore even wanted her to have the same memories as Emily. - That's why he gave her the diary. - That little girl must be so confused. All she wanted was a friend, and I just scared her away. - I have to go and find her. - Lana, I don't think that's a good idea. Clark's right. Until we know more, why don't you stay here? - Mrs. Kent, Mr. Kent. - Hello, sheriff. - We followed up on your story. - You found the lab. After we got your call, we went and checked it out. David Copperfield must've got there first. I saw them. The people who took everything away? The sleeping girls. Why are they like me? - Emily... - My daddy said I can't remember... ...because I had an accident. You don't remember anything because you didn't write that. A different Emily did. She's the girl buried in the graveyard, isn't she? Yeah. This is her story. But you have to write your own. Why would my daddy lie to me? He probably thought that telling you the truth would make you feel different. But there's nothing wrong with being different. I'm different too. It doesn't change who we are. Yes, it does. Lex, what are you doing here? I could ask the same of you. I met Emily Dinsmore. You can't blame me for being a little intrigued... ...after I found out she died six years ago. So you don't know anything about the lab that was down here? They cloned Emily here. That's why your father's been refining meteor rocks. - What? - There were jars of it. Right where you're standing. Before Dinsmore left LuthorCorp, he was developing a technique... ...to speed up cell growth. He claimed he could incubate a rabbit embryo to adulthood in a matter of days. He's been using the meteor rocks as Miracle-Gro. That's why Emily looks like she's 10 years old already. All ethics aside, it's an astonishing accomplishment. Well, tell that to the little girl who doesn't know who she is. I brought you a picture. Thanks. Emily, I want to talk to you. Are you ready to go to the river? Not today. - Don't you want to be friends anymore? - Of course I do, but... Come to the river. I'll race you. I want everything to be like before. No! Emily, wait. You're here about Emily, aren't you? She's a remarkable girl. - Did he find her? - Not yet. But, knowing my father, he will. You know that Emily will never be safe in his care. - I don't have many options. - I'm offering to protect her. You loved her enough to create her. Don't you want her to have a normal life? Of course I do. But Emily's accelerated growth caused... ...severe chromosomal damage. She has no conscience, she has no concept of right or wrong. She's dangerous. Lana? - Clark, what's wrong? - Where's Lana? I thought she was in the living room doing her homework. Emily, it's too slippery out here. - It's okay, Lana, we won't get in trouble. - You don't understand. We've already been out here once before. Is that why Daddy's mad at you? It was raining... ...and I fell into the water and you jumped in after me. - Because I'm your best friend? - Yes. You kept swimming beside me, telling me I could make it... ...that I'd be fine. And when I looked back, you were too far away... ...and the current was too strong. Didn't you save me? No. I thought you were my best friend. If I could go back and change that day, I swear to you, I would. I live every day knowing that it should have been me. This time it will be. Lana. Lana. Oh, please. Lana. Lana, it's okay. It's okay, it's me. It's all right. You're okay. Clark. Hold me. Lex, what's the crisis? One minute, you want nothing to do with me... ...and then I'm inundated with urgent messages. How does it feel to play God, Dad? If I left in the middle of brunch with the governor... I know you've reopened Level 3. The ominous Level 3. Instead of abandoning the project like you claimed... ...you dispersed the research into smaller, undetectable labs. How could you buy in to such a myth? Your connection to Dinsmore is more than a myth. You're genetically engineering human beings. Oh, Lex. Lex. Extraterrestrials. Secret labs. It's science fiction, son. I saw Emily Dinsmore with my own eyes. If you'd kept your mind on business, you might have noticed that the state... ...has placed the conservatorship of the Kawatche cave under my control... ...effective today. That's impossible. - I was under contract for five years. - That's what I told the governor. But, apparently, somehow, he's learned of a series of accidents... ...and several unfortunate deaths that occurred under your watch. I'm sorry, son. I've tried to teach you: Always keep a sharp eye on the ball. - Smooth as silk. Good job, Dad. - Thanks. You realize, Clark, this baby is gonna be one lucky kid... ...having you as an older brother. I mean that, Clark. Just a... Just a second. Lana. Hi. Lana, I heard Sheriff Adams is still looking for Emily. But I'm concerned about you. Are you doing okay? I'm gonna be fine. Just worried about Emily, after all she's been through. - Yeah. - I hope the police find her soon. I'm sure they will. Do you think I could borrow Clark for a couple of minutes, Mr. Kent? Yeah, I don't see why not. If this is the mysterious Lana, I like it. What is this all about? Us, kind of. I just wanted to thank you for yesterday. There were a few minutes there when I really thought I might be losing it. But you never doubted me. Not for a second. You always believe in me. It means a lot. Lana, what is this all about? It's just that sometimes I... I feel like you've created this perfect picture of who I am. That's what I see. This might sound silly. But I have this fear that... That one day you'll finally get a good look at me and... I'm going to disappoint you. That you'll see that I'm not as strong... ...or as good as you think I am. And I'm afraid that it'll change the way you feel about me. Nothing could ever do that. Maybe it's me that needs to start believing in you. We'll do better next time. I assume this means I can continue the project. I don't think that would be a wise decision, Pete. You've jeopardized the research once already. - You said you wanted a prototype. - Yes, I did. And this phase has brought us closer to our goal. But I don't want you working on the project any longer. - You're too emotionally involved. - She's flawed... ...but she's my daughter. - No. No, she's not. She's a poor approximation. This specimen is defective. You can't take her away from me. She's... ...my life. She's the property of LuthorCorp. Hello, Emily. I don't like you. You know what I think, Emily? I think... I think we just got off on the wrong foot. Look at this. You want to hold him, Emily? Go ahead. Where's my daddy? You mustn't worry about him, Emily. I'm gonna take very good care of you. You'll see. What do you think you should call your rabbit? - Bunny Buns. - Bunny Buns? That's a beautiful name. This tastes good.
