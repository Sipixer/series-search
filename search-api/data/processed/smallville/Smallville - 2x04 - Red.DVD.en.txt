- I think we'll be lucky... ...if the glue holds through graduation. I wonder if the ruby's even real. You sure you're gonna do this? I'm here, aren't I? - What? - I believe your dad's exact words were: "Three hundred and fifty dollars is a lot to spend on something you really don't need." I earned that money. Besides, Dad said it was my decision to make. Which means that you're really not supposed to buy it. I know the first day at a new school can be rough, so if you have questions, just ask. So, what do you Crows do for fun? Between the tractor-pulls and the hoedowns. - There's the Talon. - Which is...? A coffeehouse, and a really cool place to hang out. But I'm kind of biased, because I sort of own it. Gee, I'll have to check it out. Whoa. Who is the major hottie in primary colors? That's Clark Kent. No offense, Lana, but maybe I could get him to show me around. You feeling all right? Yeah, I feel great. Excuse me. It's Jessie, isn't it? Perhaps Ms. Lang didn't tell you, but there's a dress code here at Smallville High. Lame and lamer? You think that's funny, Mr. Kent? By the way, I'm not changing. Well, perhaps you'd like to discuss your attitude in my office. Excuse me, Mr. Gibbons? I think she looks really hot, and I think that your dress code sucks. Excuse me? I mean, come on. It's her first day, cut her some slack. Besides, I don't think you should be the one giving fashion tips. Tomorrow, young lady, proper attire or you're going straight home. I guess we can finish our tour. Where did that come from? I don't know... ...but I think I liked it. I'm telling you, man, I don't know where she is. Look, Kyle... ...I know that you want to do the right thing... ...but Jessie and her father are fugitives now. It's my job to bring them in. What kind of U.S. Marshal are you, anyways? The kind that gets results. - Okay. - Okay? Okay, what? I've heard from her once or twice. She called me collect from someplace in Kansas. Where in Kansas? It's a big state. All over. They were from pay phones. Check my phone bill. That's all I know. You have to believe me. Relax. I believe you. So you'll let me go now? Oh, I would, but Jessie might call. And you might decide to warn her. So this is what I was talking about. It's right over the county line, and they don't check IDs. Dude, this is like a bar. I know. You're the one who says if you wanna have fun, you gotta take risks. We can go this weekend. The day Clark Kent decides to break rules, I'll be there. - All right. - Clark, right? Jessie Brooks. That place rocks. I checked it out on my way into town. - Are you planning a road trip? - Lf we do, I'll let you know. You'll need to know how to get in touch with me. In case you require a translation, that was her hitting on you. She is kind of hot. Aren't you married to Lana in your imagination? Clark! You and Jessie seem to be making fast friends. Just trying to make the new girl feel welcome. Don't worry, Lana, I haven't taken my eye off you all day. So we still on for that cram session tonight at the Talon? If you're still gonna be there, absolutely. I'll be there. So soon as you get this shined to your liking, I get the first ride. Yep, and all the others can just take a number. Hey, where's Clark? He's really late. Looking for me? Yeah. Weren't you supposed to be here with me, working on the garage door? Dad, that'll take, like, two seconds. And I thought we agreed you weren't gonna buy that ring. I thought we decided it was my decision to make. That's because I assumed that you would make the right one. Clark, that ring costs a lot of money. And I'm tired of worrying about every nickel and dime. Clark, why don't you go wash up for dinner. I'm not hungry. Besides, I have chores to do. What was that all about? I think our not-so-normal son might be going through some classic teenage rebellion. Well, I think I liked dealing with heat vision a lot better than that. - Martha, that was a bad decision he made. - But it was his to make. I seem to recall a certain young man who defied his father... ...and spent $500 on an old motorcycle. Challenging him is only gonna make it worse. When I got up this morning, I was pretty sure this was my office. Lex! I thought you wouldn't mind if I had a few changes made... ...since I'm gonna be here a while. Go on. What I mind is not being consulted. I didn't realize I'd need my son's permission to try to make my... ...situation here a trifle more bearable. I've lost my sight. Allow me at least a modicum of dignity. Give him whatever he wants. - Barkeep, I'm looking for a girl. - Aren't we all? The girl in this photo used that phone over there. Any crime in that? No, but she is a teenager... ...and we both know the legal drinking age in Kansas is 21. If she comes back in, you call me. The number's on the back. I think we should start in the middle... Hey, Clark, glad you made it. We're just doing American history, the Red Scare. Hey, can we do that tomorrow? - Why, is something wrong? - No, it... It's really nice out tonight. Let's go for a drive, go dancing. Are you asking me on a date? I'm asking you to have some fun with me. This is a little unexpected, to say the least. But we really have to study. Did you know when you get all serious, your nose crinkles up? It's really sexy. Pete and Chloe are waiting for us. - Well, let me use your sheet. - Yeah. Maybe we should check... What did you get for number five? Hey, man. Where are your books? You guys want to go to a bar? You can commit academic hara-kiri, but the rest of us need to cram for this test. You guys, high school's supposed to be fun. This is not fun. - Come on, my treat. - When did you and the money truck hook up? Since I decided there's no percentage in playing poverty. I'm gonna get a refill. I'm gonna get you some decaf. Here, I'll give you a hand. Yeah, I have never... Did you know that Chloe had a birthmark on her cheek? - No, she doesn't. - Not that cheek. Are you doing what I think you're doing? - Clark, that's Chloe you're scoping, man. - Not just Chloe. - Come on, let's go have some fun. - Clark, this test is half our grade. If you want to party this weekend, I'm with you, but right now, I need to do this. All right. Well, when you're through with Boring 101, give me a call. You're kidding. Thank you. What's wrong? That was the credit card company. They were... ...calling to verify some charges that were made on our card? Last night? When did we get a satellite dish? This is silk! - Clark! - Clark! Where did you get all this? Discount Eddie's in Metropolis. Open all night! You mean to tell... You mean you took our credit cards and you bought all this...? - You bought all this junk? - Yeah. I figured it was time I had the cool stuff everyone else has. Clark Kent, you stole from us. No. I used your credit cards. What's the big deal? We don't have to pay for it right away. Well, I'll tell you the big deal... ...the big deal is, you're gonna take all this garbage back right now. Come on! - Yeah, right. - Yeah, right. After you've taken this garbage back... ...we're gonna have a conversation about this new attitude you've developed. Well, Dad, you can talk all you want. I'm out of here. Clark! Clark, come back here! You're not going to school dressed like that. Okay. Then I just won't go. Jessie, please, you're a smart girl. You know we can't afford to draw attention to ourselves. Need a ride? Clark? Jessie. - My hero. - Jessie, I need you to... Okay, what planet is that guy from and what did he do with Clark? Well, Clark... ...thanks for the ride. Anytime. So much for the shy and retiring Clark Kent. I was just giving her a ride to school. Say the word and I'll save you the return trip. Catch up with you later. Clark Kent, chick magnet. What's wrong with this picture? People change, Pete. - Clark, I'd like a word with you, please. - Not right now, Dad. - Get in the truck, son. - Give me one good reason why I should. Because I am your father, and I just told you to get in the truck. You're not my father. You never were. You all right, sir? Here you go. - I can't believe Clark would do that. - It's like he's a whole different person. - How are we gonna get him home? - I don't know. Fact is, if he doesn't want to come home, there isn't much either one of us can do. Here, I'll take it. I'll get that. Takes your whole teenage-rebellion theory to a new level. This is more than teenage rebellion. A change this drastic doesn't happen overnight. Martha, it's Clark. All of his other abilities cropped up overnight. Do you think this is part of his development? I don't know. But from what he said... ...I guess those feelings have been boiling up for a while. No, Jonathan, Clark loves you. But there's something seriously wrong with him. I don't think another father-and-son talk is gonna help this time. Maybe Pete can help. They're always together. We should find out if he has any idea what's causing Clark's behavior. Well, we've gotta do something. Lana, we need to talk. Clark, please, I really need to get these orders done. Your coffee can wait. I got the impression that you were jealous when you saw me with Jessie. Don't be ridiculous. You can spend time with anyone you want. Don't get me wrong. I was happy you were jealous. Clark, what is going on with you? I've decided to tell you the truth, Lana. About...? - About everything? - Try me. What do you want to know? For starters, how about what happened the day the twisters hit? We'll get there. But right now we should concentrate on more important things, like... I've had feelings for you for a long time... ...and I know that you've had feelings for me too. So I think we should stop pretending. So, what? Is this supposed to be some... ...all-new Clark Kent? - Well, that depends. Do you like him? Clark, l... What about Jessie? Jessie who? You're the one I want to be with. I'll pick you up at 8. Pete, you are not gonna believe what I found out. Our "el cheapo" class rings are, in fact, fake. Chloe, there's something wrong with Clark. More than usual? Last night at the Talon, the motorcycle... ...other stuff. - What kind of other stuff? The kind that has Mr. And Mrs. Kent calling my house. They're worried. It's, like, they think he's on drugs. Clark would have to be on drugs to be on drugs. Just be careful with that. - What is it, anyway? - My expose. See this lovely $350 piece of school spirit? It's a rip-off. The jewelry company was substituting worthless meteor rocks for rubies... ...to save money. - Chloe... ...rings, red. Meteor rocks, green. Not the load they found near Hobbs Pond. Note the red vein. You can read all about it on page one of today's Torch. Pete. Chloe's gonna force a recall because the rings are made from this. - Think that's what's causing his behavior? - Well, that's when it started. Right after he slipped on the ring. If the green meteor rocks affect Clark physically... ...maybe the red affects him emotionally. That explains his personality changes. The longer he's exposed to the green, the worse he gets. If the same is true with the red, God help us. - We're gonna find him, get that ring back. - How are we gonna do that? Like you said, if he doesn't wanna do something, we can't force it. Sweetheart, I don't know, but we have to figure out a way. I came to shoot some pool, but it looks like this establishment's been closed. My father's presence has required certain sacrifices. - Why don't you throw him out? - Clark... ...it's not like the thought hasn't occurred to me, but... ...his blindness changes the situation. Just because your father has a problem doesn't mean he needs to ruin your life. I wasn't aware a $2000 coat came with a backbone. What's going on? I'd like to borrow the Ferrari. Got a hot date tonight, and I wanna... ...rock her world. "Rock her world"? So, Lana at last. Like you said, a man needs to know when to make his move. I'm glad you're finally acting on your feelings, but... ...Lana's never struck me as a girl to be impressed by a Ferrari. Fast cars... ...fancy home and a ton of money never hurt you, did it? Come on, I just want to make tonight special. I don't know. It's a very expensive piece of machinery, difficult to handle. It's not like I'm going to... ...drive it off a bridge. All you have to ask yourself is... ...who's more responsible than Clark Kent? This place is great! I guess. Not exactly what I was expecting. What are you looking at? Clark, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Want a beer? - What? - Do you want a beer? - No! And since when do you drink? If you don't wanna drink, let's dance. Clark, this place isn't us. Let's go somewhere else and talk. I'll take that dance, Clark. - Whoa! - I took your advice, Lana... ...and checked out the Talon. - Yeah? Yeah, that's why I decided to come here. - Clark, come on. Let's go. - One dance. Lana, I'll be right back. - So do you like living in Smallville? - It's the only place I ever lived. Well, there's a big, bad world out there. The right person ought to show you. Anyone in mind? I'm leaving. Lana, we just got here. Why don't you go get us some drinks. We'll all have a good time. You're unbelievable! What happened to telling the truth? What happened to "Spend time with whoever you want"? - Is that the way you want it? - Sure. There's enough of me to go around. - Lana... - Is there a problem here? Not anymore. I'd let the lady go if I were you. - You're going down, smart guy. - I don't think so. Oh, God! - Oh, God! - Help him! Anybody else? I can't be here when the cops get here. Yeah, let's go pack our bags, see that big, bad world you were talking about. Let it go, man! Let it go! Where were you all night? We looked everywhere. Last night was the best night of my life. - We want to help you. - Help me? Help me what? Stay here on the farm? Doing chores, wasting my life for a $20-a-week allowance? Clark, I wish you could hear yourself for just a minute. There's something very... ...very wrong with you. It's that ring. You're still upset about me buying this stupid thing. How pathetic. Clark. You really don't want to touch me. Why don't you just hand it to me, then. Clark, please, it isn't the ring itself. Chloe found out it's made out of red meteor rock. You know how the green rock makes you sick? Well, we think the red rock is affecting your mind. It's changed your personality, Clark. So everything I've been doing and saying is because of this? That's right. That's why you gotta take that thing off right away. Take it off? I just wish I would have found it sooner. If you guys wanna waste your life in this mudhole... ...that's your problem. I'm through being poor. We might not have all the things that other people have. - I didn't think our family was about that. - With my abilities, I can make millions. Sports, TV, it's all waiting for me. You're the ones who force me to hide who I am. No. We are the ones who have been trying to protect you. We don't want anybody taking you away. Protecting me? Using me. I'm just another piece of equipment to keep your farm going. That's all gonna change. Lex, if it's all right, I'm gonna keep the Ferrari a bit longer. - I'll send it back when I get myself set up. - Whoa, slow down. Clark, what's going on? I left home. What happened? You have a fight with your folks? My parents don't understand me. The truth is, there's nothing left for me in Smallville. What about Lana? She's old news. I got a new girl, Jessie. Kind of sudden, isn't it? You're the one always telling me to find my destiny. Well, one thing's for certain, it's not here in Kansas. So you've just packed your stuff and you're off. You have no idea what I'm capable of. Really? Why don't you fill me in. Let's just say that when I'm through showing the world what I can do... ...I'll have everything I've ever wanted. I may be even richer than you. Maybe you're right to get away from your folks. Maybe I should do the same. If my father wants the mansion so much... ...he can have it. - I never wanted to live in Smallville. - You can come with me. Nobody's using the penthouse in Metropolis. Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. I like the sound of that. Let me just tie up some loose ends at the office. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. - Hey. - Hey. So I heard from a source that you had a big date with Clark last night. Wouldn't call it a date when the guy you went with leaves with someone else. Wow. You just went from the gossip column to page one. Sorry, sometimes my "glib-o-meter" goes into overdrive. No. I guess... You know, he's so secretive. I guess I was thrown for a loop... ...by a Clark who could say all the things that the old Clark couldn't. Well, welcome to the conundrum that is Clark Kent. Part knight in shining armor, part "Where did that come from?" Miss? - Can I get a refill here? - Yeah. Yeah, just a second. Thanks. Here you go. Louise. Did you get an owner and an address on the license plate I asked you to run? Of course I know who he is. Thanks. You're an angel. Are you sure this is the right thing to do? Pete, Clark would not listen to reason. We don't have much of a choice here. There's only one way to stop the unstoppable. - Yeah... - Excuse me. Mr. Kent. Pete, why don't you... Why don't you get going. Lex, this is really not a very good time. I understand you and Clark have been having problems. I don't want to be rude, but I'd prefer it if you'd stay out of my family's problems. Believe me, Mr. Kent, I'm not trying to pry, but... ...Clark's my friend. I'd hate to see your relationship fall apart. I appreciate your concern... ...but Clark and I can work this out. Then why is Clark hiding out at the mansion? Lex? Is that you? Hey! Whoa, hey! What do you want? Lionel, go back to your room. Better yet, pack your bags and get the hell out. I beg your pardon? Lex may be too afraid to tell you, but I'm not. No one in Smallville wants you here. You seem to know a lot about me. You got a name? - Clark Kent. - Jonathan and Martha Kent's son? As far as I know, they're good people. I'm astonished they've raised... ...such a blatantly aggressive offspring. If you like them so much, I'm sure they'll put you up. I hear they have a spare bedroom, and I know they could use the cash. You've got a lot to learn about tact, young man, but you speak your mind. That's good. It'll take you far. I'm going to the top. - Mr. Luthor? - Yes. I apologize for the interruption. I'm a federal marshal. Your people let me in. What can I do for you? This man was seen last night leaving the scene of a disturbance in your son's Ferrari. Was that while you were on your way to the top, Clark? Where can I find this girl? I've never seen her before. Is that supposed to scare me? How'd you do that? You've got no idea who you're dealing with. What's happening? - Who's shooting? - Don't worry, Lionel... ...he missed. I'll call security. Why are you looking for Jessie? It's not her, it's her father. They were witness protection. They rabbited. - Why? - He's a corporate whistle-blower. His former employer offered me a million dollars if I could get evidence. What kind of evidence? Computer disks, accounting files, memos, endless smoking guns. Look, we can split it. It's enough money to start a whole new life. That's a great idea... ...but who needs you? Thought you forgot about me. Ready to go? Almost. I know about your father, Jessie, and the disks. We're not going anywhere until I have them. I don't understand. Why are you doing this? The money. You said you wanted to leave this town... ...and a million dollars is more than enough money to make a fresh start. If I give you those disks, my dad is a dead man. He was dead when he started running. - Didn't I tell you I didn't want to split? - You need me, kid. I know the players, how to get the money. Now give him the disks, Jessica! I don't want to hurt you, son. But I will. Get out. Just like my dad... ...always telling me what to do. I don't listen to him. What makes you think I'm gonna listen to you? Where are the disks? In the floorboards? In the ceiling? In here? Doesn't really matter. I'll figure it out one way or another. So why don't you save yourself a lot of pain... ...and make it sooner. You can kill me, you can tear this house to the ground, you won't find those disks. Jessie. Please don't do this. I never realized how easy it would be to get everything I've ever wanted. Clark! Pete? - It take the whole study group to find me? - No. Lionel Luthor heard you mention Jessie. Jessie, run! How far is she gonna get, Pete? A mile or two? You know no one can get away from me. Clark! - I won't let you hurt anybody else. - Still trying to tell me what to do. Are you scared? Then again, you and Mom were always afraid of me. No. We've had nothing but love for you. That makes what I'm about to do all that more difficult. Pete. Do it. Pete. Clark, I'm sorry. Clark! Dad? It's okay, son. It's all right. You okay, man? Thanks, Pete. Who is that? What's...? What's going on? Lex? What's going on in here? What...? I didn't order any more work to be done. - I'm putting the office back the way it was. - You... Have a drink, Dad. Bas Armagnac, 1963? It's my favorite. There was a time when I thought our taste in brandy was all we had in common. And now? I've been thinking about the months after the meteor shower... ...the way people looked at me. A baldheaded boy, thinking I was a freak. Please, Lex, not another tale of your tortured youth and how I... How I failed you as a father... Actually, you gave me some excellent advice. You told me to stop feeling sorry for myself. These were the cards fate had dealt me. It was best that I accept it and move on. Stop acting like your blindness gives you an excuse for self-pity. So the son becomes the father. No, Dad. I'm through indulging you like a child. My office remains my office. You don't like it, leave. Well. Seems I have done a better job of raising you than I thought. Or perhaps... ...you've finally learned the value of directness from your friend... ...Clark Kent. He's a very interesting young man. - Hi. - Hey. - Here. - Thanks. I went by Jessie's. They've completely cleared out. Well, maybe they stopped running and have gone to the authorities. I just hope she's all right. You know, Dad, the things that I did and I said, I really didn't mean them. Clark... ...the red meteor rocks might have affected your personality, but... ...we gotta face it, those feelings all came from somewhere. Now, I know compared to Lex, we don't have a whole lot around here, but... ...up until now, I never really thought it bothered you. Maybe it does. Sometimes. And then I remember what's really important... ...and none of that matters. No matter how crazy I got... ...you two stood by me. That's something all the money in the world can't buy. - But, still, it was a very close call, son. - I know. When I put that ring on, I felt this sudden urge to tell the whole world my secret. - Lex, Lana, Jessie. - But you didn't, Clark. I know, but the feelings are still there. It's like I have these two identities and I don't know which one's the real me. The real you is the one who came back to us... ...and we never had any doubt that you would. Nell told me you were riding, that this is one of your favorite places. It's pretty. I got a little lost along the way, but... ...here I am. Those for me? Yeah. I wanted to apologize. I was hoping maybe we could be friends, like we were before. So you thought that if you brought me flowers, I'd pretend like nothing happened? You have to believe me. The things I said, the way I was acting... ...that wasn't me. Even the part where you said you had feelings for me? - Lana... - Clark... ...you can't have it both ways. Either it was you, or it wasn't. Wish I could explain, but I can't. Story of your life. Lana... ...I really am sorry. I know you are. It's not enough anymore. Do you think you can find your way home? Hope so. Subtitle by:
