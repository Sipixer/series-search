Next. Well, look who it is. -Hiya, freak! -Van, back off! You're the one that should be in here! You're the one that should be in here! They should lock you up, you freak! Hey, Kent. It's me, Eric. Been struck by lightning lately? Good to see you, Clark. Tell my two favorite ex-girlfriends I said hello. Keep moving, lan. Jeez, kid. You seem to know a lot of people in here. Where's Lex? You got 1 0 minutes. Lex? Clark, I was wondering if I'd ever see you again. I've been trying to visit you. The doctors said you weren't ready to see anyone. -Are you okay? -I know your secret. Don't worry. I haven't said a word to anyone. I need you to get me out of here. I've seen what you can do. That car hit you at 60 miles an hour... ...and you tossed it like a toy. Breaking me out's not gonna be too much of a challenge. -Lex, I want to-- -Then do it, Clark. My father's never gonna let me out. You're my friend. Please, Clark. Don't let me rot in this cesspool. I'm sorry. -Hey! -Come on! Get that bastard out of my sight! I'll never forgive you for this, Clark! Never! Never! Save me. Save me. Get up, Curly. Time for your 9:00 meds. Get up. Oh, God! Hey, Luthor! What are you doing here, my friend? I'm gonna take you back to your room, okay? Just relax. I've never seen Lex so angry with me. It's like he just went.... Crazy? Well, you can't take it personally, Clark. It was hard not to. He asked me to break him out. You said no, didn't you? Yeah. -Well, that's good. -Yeah, it's great. He just broke himself out, injured two guards along the way. He doesn't belong in there. He's being drugged. Well, we don't know that for sure. This isn't his first brush with mental illness. Well, Lionel's never gonna let him out. I'm his only chance. You can't just break somebody out of a state institution. Then you'd go to jail, and Lex would be out there, a fugitive with your secret. -Pete knows, and that's turned out okay. -Lex is different. Look, I'm not saying you should put your secret above Lex's well-being. I just think that you should stay out of this one. -Dad-- -Clark. You don't know everything that's going on here. Now, if you get involved-- It could just get worse. You know, you've got another friend in a hospital that you haven't visited. Lana doesn't wanna see me right now. She was in shock, Clark. She didn't mean what she said. Except she's right. All I've done is put her in danger. She's better off without me. What about you? Are you better off? You know, you can save the whole world, Clark... ...but you gotta take care of your own heart too. Go see her. Good, Lana. One more step. Okay. Okay, that's enough for today. It goes for you too, Adam. I know my limits. If you overdo it, you'll undo all your hard work. If I listened to people like you, I'd still be in bed. -Good work today, sweetie. -Thanks. Hurts, doesn't it? Like you wouldn't believe. I think you're getting off way too easily. -Excuse me? -You have to learn to push through the pain. If we all sat down every time it hurt, this country never would've been built. Well, I doubt the Founding Fathers broke their legs in four places. What happened, bad pileup in cheerleading practice? No, no, seriously. How'd you end up in here? A horse got spooked. I ended up under its hooves. I'm guessing that's not a good place to be. I'm Adam. Lana. All right, Lana. We both know that you have one more lap in you in this puppy. -Let's see it. -How about not? I know "struggle" is probably not in your vocabulary... ...but just to let you know, here, it's credo. For your information, I haven't walked in a month. Feeling sorry for yourself may work now, but it won't get you up a flight of stairs. -Are you always this obnoxious? -I'm telling you how it is. No one's ever honest with girls like you. I bet you have a boyfriend that's always protecting you, right? But he's not here. No one's gonna fight this battle for you. You're on your own. See you around. Hello, Lex. You were making such good progress, son. You're the one who taught me: Attack adversity head-on. And had you been taking your medication, you would've done just that. This institution is not your adversary, Lex. Your illness is the enemy. But I'm better now. I don't need the meds. That story about you killing your parents... ...was nothing more than a paranoid delusion. See, somewhere along the line, I veered off into the abyss... ...but I've managed to claw my way back. But that's irrelevant now. What do you mean? When your attempt to escape failed... ...you sabotaged my efforts to have you released... ...to be cared for at home. But I told you, I'm cured. A cured patient doesn't belong in a hospital. Oh, it's painful to see you like this. You know I have your best interest at heart, don't you? The only interest you have... ...is staying out of prison. I'm not insane, and you know it. It's sad to see a man who's lost his mind. But it's tragic when he's convinced himself that he's sane. You son of a bitch. You did this to me. You're the one who's insane! You did this to me! Well, if it isn't Ku Klux Van. -Get out of my grill, freaks. -I'd watch your mouth if I were you. Yeah, we heard about your little one-man ethnic-cleansing campaign. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Come on. You were picking off meteor freaks... ...Iike ducks on the first day of hunting season. And now you're stuck in here with all us ducks. Quack, quack. We don't wanna hurt you, Van. -The three of us have something in common. -I seriously doubt that. Clark Kent put us all in here. And word on the ward is you know his weakness. -Why should I tell you? -Well, because. We're looking to sample the sweet taste of revenge. If you weaken him, I can leech his powers and break us out of here. Wait, you took Clark's powers? -How? -It's a lightning strike. He took them back with a high-voltage shock. How do I know I can trust you freaks? The enemy of your enemy is your friend. I don't feel comfortable moving forward with the procedure. Comfortable? Your comfort level is of no concern to me, doctor. I've indulged you for a month while you've conducted this drug therapy... ...and not only does Lex's memory remain completely intact... ...but he attempted to escape. I can't afford to waste any more time. Mr. Luthor, the procedure you're proposing is Draconian. It's successful in less than 50 percent of patients. It leaves the other half with irreparable brain damage. Are you willing to take that risk? No risk, no reward. Isn't that what they say, doctor? Performing this procedure on a patient who doesn't require it is unconscionable. But it's not the first time. You've experimented with it before. We had a mutual agreement, didn't we? I strongly suggest you keep your part of the bargain. So start the procedure immediately. Clark, turn a light on. It's bad for your eyes. Why are you working so late? Trying to prove Lex doesn't belong in Belle Reve. -And what'd you find on Lex? -Well, I have his medical records. Dr. Foster's definitely drugging him. There are millions of reasons why she could be administering this drug. Psychotherapy is just trial and error. This doesn't prove anything. I know. But I gotta do something. Well, why don't we work on this in the morning. This is just a pit stop. I have to pick up Lana on my way home. How is Lana? It's been really tough. She could use some moral support. I sent her a card. Nothing says, "l love you," more than a $1.50 piece of cardboard. If she wanted me there, Chloe, I'd be there. Right now, I'm just trying to keep my promises for once. Keep me posted on the 'Free Lex" front. Chloe, wait. Dr. Foster has recommended Lex for radical electroshock therapy. That's a little extreme, don't you think? It is. Memory loss is almost a given... ...and if things don't go exactly as planned, Lex could turn out a vegetable. When does this happen? Twenty-four hours. Is that my package? I still don't get what you want with one of these rocks. How about we just forget the whole thing? Whatever floats your boat, my man. So did you get what you were waiting for? It's in the box. When Kent comes back... ...he's gonna have a little surprise waiting for him. You need a spot? Look, when Clark shows up, I'll be ready. But until then, don't pretend we're friends. I just wanted you to meet my better half. Well, you should know better than to trust a meteor freak. What's the emergency? Everything's fine here. Is this what you're planning on doing to Lex? There's nothing wrong with Lex. You drugged him. That's why he's delusional. If you're here to accuse me of malpractice, I hope you have the facts to back it up. I'm sure you could explain Lex's dubious drug regime... ...but what about the existing lawsuit for radical electroshock therapy? What happened to Mr. Watkins was unfortunate. But for your information, that suit was dropped. -Because Lionel Luthor paid it off. -I'm very busy. So if you two will excuse me. Do you think if you turn Lex into a vegetable, Lionel Luthor's gonna let you off the hook? You have all the power here, doctor. Please, help Lex and yourself. Newspaper, magazine, crossword puzzle? What do you think? Right. It must be a little bit difficult to turn the pages. What do you do when you have an itch? Get out of my face. Boy, I bet you are just itching to get out of this place. Mr. Luthor, what would you do if I told you... ...I'd figured out a way for certain animals to escape the zoo? -I'd ask you why you're still here. -Funding issues. Once I'm out, I need to disappear. And a new identity doesn't come cheap. Oh, I admired your ambition. But when you tried to murder my friends to get my money... ...you went a little too far. I know I've made some mistakes in the past... -...but I'm all better now. -And I'm happy for you. The both of you. Now, take your little cart, and go sucker some other patient with a bank account. Suit yourself. Of course... ...if my brain were about to be deep-fried... ...I might have a little bit different attitude. It's gonna be hard to get around when your toes are permanently curled. Fear's an effective sales tactic, but it doesn't work on me. How about facts? See... ...you're on deck, Mr. Luthor. Where'd you get this? I know everything that goes on in this dump. If you wanna save your cerebrum, you know where to find me. -You okay? -Yeah, I'm just pushing through the pain. -I see you changed your therapy time. -Yeah, I wasn't crazy about the company. Would you believe me if I told you I was a nice guy once with no issues? Nice guys normally have the most issues. That's why I came. I wanted to apologize. Sorry for taking it out on you. I was upset because you're kind of right. I haven't really been pushing myself. I guess it's because I know when I get back on my feet... ...my life's gonna be different. I don't really know if I'm ready to face it. So you never got around to telling me why you're in here. Isn't it obvious? Fine cuisine, post-modern decor. No, really, what happened? Well, I tried to get into a burning building, and a beam collapsed on me. My parents were inside. I thought I could save them. God, I'm so sorry. It happened. Now I have to move on. See? I guess I'm a little afraid of my future too. I convinced Foster to stop the procedure. She's on her way now to sign the cancellation papers. And you think this is a good thing? Clark, he knows your secret. I can't let him turn Lex into a vegetable just for that. -You can't trust him. -And you've never given him a chance. And you give him too many. You think it's easy keeping a lid on your secret? I've gotta think about it all the time. I gotta say "meteor rock," not "Kryptonite," and I gotta cover your unexplained exits. -Pete, I'm sorry. You've never said anything. -Clark, that's not the point. The point is that I got your back... ...but Lex won't. Chloe, what's wrong? Claire Foster's dead. They found her car wrapped around a tree off Highway 54. I feel the invisible hand of Lionel Luthor. You two had better back off before he sets his sights on you. I know you were just trying to help Lex, but you've made matters worse. -There's gotta be another way to stop it. -Dr. Foster tried and look what happened. Lionel Luthor is gonna make sure this procedure happens. Lex. Clark, I knew you'd come. Let's get you out of here. All this time... ...I was right about you. What do you know? It worked. If it weren't for you, Kent... ...I'd be at Harvard right now with a coed on each arm. What the hell are you doing to him? Your buddy's our first-class ticket out of here. Is that how you plan to escape? I'm not giving you a cent. Clark's my friend. You ought to pick your friends better, since he didn't tell you his little secret. Come on, let's get out of here. No. Lex. -Leave him alone! -Or you'll do what, Mr. Luthor? Considering they're coming to fry your ass in about five minutes. Leave him alone! Well, here he is. Right on schedule. -Eric. -Time to give me those powers back. It's not like you use them anyway. This will never work. Are you kidding? There's enough voltage in here... ...to power a small, Third-World country. Save your strength, Clark. I'm gonna need it. Clark! Clark! Clark! They've got Clark! -How the hell did he get out? -I don't know, but I ain't taking any chances. No! No! -There you go. Almost. -Okay. Done. It's not Mount Everest, but it is a start. A few days ago, I wouldn't have thought that possible. Sometimes you just have to look impossibility straight in the eye. Mrs. Kent, what a surprise. Chloe had a late deadline. She asked if I could give you a ride home. -I'm gonna go. -Okay. -Hello. -Hello. Interesting physical therapist. So how's Clark? I got his card. -I'm sorry he hasn't come by to see you. -To be honest, that was kind of my idea. Lana, I know that Clark's not always the easiest person to understand... ...but he never meant to put you in danger. Did he send you to argue his case? He doesn't know I'm here. I'm sure he'd be upset that I was meddling. I just want him to be happy. I know. But you need to be happy too, Lana. Thanks, Mrs. Kent. Please. I'll pay you whatever you want. You'll never have to work another day in your life. He doesn't want your money, son. He wants to make you better. Just like I do. -You're a liar. -No. Be strong, Lex. -Liar! -I'm sorry, son. -No, don't do this, Dad. Don't do-- -Be strong. Be strong. Be strong. Be strong. I'm sorry, son. I didn't think it would have to come to this. If it were a gangrenous limb, we could amputate. The brain, unfortunately, is infinitely more complex. No, don't do this! -Do it. -No! Hey! Come on, let's go! I'm right here. What happened to your better half? It's a lot easier to break one person out than two. Let's go. -What is it? What's happening? -We don't have any power. -There must be a short somewhere. -Well, fix it. Do you feel any different? Does that answer your question? Welcome back to being normal, Clark. Kind of sucks, doesn't it? All right, you'll pay for the two wasted years I spent in here. -Eric, let's go. -I'm not through with him yet. They're gonna realize we're gone. They'll be here any minute. -What do I care? It's not my problem. -No, no, wait a second. -We're a team. I thought we were friends. -There's no such thing as friends in here. Hey! Is that all you got? That little jolt make you insane, Clark? Look who's afraid to use their powers now. I don't know what happened. Again. But, sir, the way this equipment is working, we should wait. Do it. Again. Tell me where Lex is. Now. Lex. Son? It's over. -Hi. -Hey. Am I hallucinating? No crutches. It's amazing what you can accomplish when someone's cracking a whip over your head. -You okay? -Yeah. This? Don't let it spook you. I tend to get dehydrated from time to time. Well, I know that these probably can't compare to the desserts in here... ...but I wanted to thank you for being such a pain in the butt. Anytime. So I guess this is goodbye. Just because I finished physical therapy doesn't mean I won't come by and visit. Lana, please. I'm a memory from a painful moment in your life. Who wants to be reminded of that? We all push through the pain, Adam. Maybe you're not willing to do that. Lana, I'll be completely honest with you. I like you. But I get the feeling that there's someone else... ...and I don't wanna be caught in the middle of anything. There is nothing to be caught in the middle of. But... ...I'm not really ready to be jumping into another relationship right away. Trust me, I don't wanna be your rebound boy either... ...but I would like to be your friend. Oh, I'd like that. Good. Then we're friends? Friends. Lex. -Clark. -How you feeling? Great, actually. Never better. I heard you came to visit me, and I wasn't a very cordial host. If that's true, I'm sorry. Did your dad tell you why he had you committed? He said I had a psychotic break. They think my island trauma precipitated it. I'm grateful my father recognized it in time. Me too. Do you wanna tell me something, Clark? No. It's good to have you back, Lex. Welcome home. You know, Clark, there is one thing I'll never forget. What's that? How important your friendship is to me. I'm sorry, Clark. Lex is okay. Your secret's safe. You gotta find some consolation in that. Lex is right. Lionel got away with murder. But you didn't tell him what really happened. Well, I figured, what's the point? Clark. Clark, I do not want you and Chloe taking up this charge. Someone's gonna make Lionel pay for his crime. Someday somebody will make Lionel pay for his crime... ...but that day is not today, Clark. I know this is very difficult... ...but you have to realize there are people who are more powerful than you are. Yeah. You okay? In a way, I envy Lex. He seemed so happy. I wish I could erase the last few months of my life. I heard they're having a welcome-back party for Lana at the Talon. Why don't you go. You never quit, do you? It's called tough love. Come on. Go. I know your secret. I know your secret. I haven 't said a word to anyone. I know your secret. I haven 't said a word to anyone. Why didn't you show me this sooner? -lt took all week to enhance the audio, sir. -A week? And this is the best you can do? I know your secret. I know your secret. I know your secret. --------------------------------------------- -**- English Subtitles by jondon -**- Smallville Taiwan Fans Site
