- I don't want "I'm sorry." I want to know how my father beat me out of a $ 150 million contract... ...that you assured me was a done deal. They'd only know the exact amount if they had inside information. Since we were the only ones who knew it, and I certainly didn't tell my father... ...that leaves you in a very uncomfortable position. If I no longer have your confidence, I'll tender my resignation in the morning. My father would want more than your resignation. He'd hobble you at the knees and do everything in his power... ...to ensure you'd never work in the corporate world again. But I'm not my father. All I want to know is how he found out. And how I can stop it from ever happening again. Lex, what's going on? Big Brother is listening, or should I say Big Daddy. These are just what I've found so far. State-of-the-art, high-tech surveillance. I'll have to get experts to sweep the rest of the mansion. - Are you saying your dad's spying on you? - I had a multimillion-dollar contract. The last minute, LuthorCorp manages to underbid me. You do the math. - Lex, you gotta calm down... - Don't tell me to calm down, Clark. How would you feel if someone listened to every private word you uttered? Learning all your secrets? Lex. These devices could be anywhere. - In the sofa cushions, in the heating vents. - I already checked. What about your stereo? Hey, Dad. Want me to make this extra-crispy for you? No, thanks. And if I do say so myself, I've cooked this bird to perfection. Just the way your mother likes it. Why aren't you going to Metropolis for your anniversary? Well, last year while we were out of town... ...somebody had a party at our house. Well, you know what, I think a picnic sounds perfect. So do I. But I can't go. Wait a minute, what do you mean you can't go? Lionel just called. LuthorCorp's finalizing a major acquisition tomorrow... ...and he needs me to go with him to his Metropolis office to prepare. Didn't you tell him it's your anniversary, Mom? I'll be back tomorrow night. We can celebrate then, any restaurant you want. Will you put it on your LuthorCorp expense account? Oh, Jonathan. You can't make me feel any worse about it than I do. I know how hard you worked planning today... ...but I don't have a choice. He's my boss. - I'm your husband. Believe me, I'd much rather spend today with you. But this job is important to me. I never thought I'd see the day where this job was more important than this family. - You shouldn't be working for Lionel Luthor. - Clark. He only got this major acquisition because he was spying on Lex. Clark. This is between your mother and I. Jonathan, how many times have you put this farm above our personal lives? - That is different, Martha. - Why? I'm working toward the same goal: Our family's financial security. I wish this job didn't bother you so much. I have to go. All right, Lex. What's so urgent? Remember the new American Embassy in Moscow, Dad? It was so riddled with surveillance hardware... ...the State Department had to abandon it. I've got a meeting. I don't have time to chat about foreign affairs. Actually, the topic is domestic. I've discovered a bug problem right here in my very own home. Corporate espionage, it's a fact of modern business, Lex. I'm surprised your security was so lax. It's still hard to imagine how the perpetrator could have gained access to the mansion. Do I detect a faint whiff of innuendo? Of course not, Dad. I just wanted to congratulate you on winning that contract. Oh, is that what this is about? Making an excuse for your defeat. Because I don't have time for excuses. As for your bug problem... ...I suggest you call an exterminator. - This is Mr. Green. - I've finished the appraisal you requested. - We're ready to close escrow. - How soon can you complete it? Today. We're here and ready to roll. You get full access to the property, audio and video. Do we have a go? Mr. Green, are you there? - Mr. Green. - Do it. We're on. You don't think it's too much? It depends who you're wearing it for. What do you call your newly discovered biological father's wife? Well, personally, I'd call her Mrs. Small, but that's just me. - So you're really going to see her. - Yeah. Kind of feel like I'm auditioning. What if she votes me off the island? Lana, anyone who gets to know you realizes how special you are. Thanks, Clark. That's really sweet of you to say. You're always the one telling me I need to be more honest. Yeah. Well, maybe you see me that way because we're friends. But to Jennifer Small, I'm just her husband's illegitimate daughter... ...trying to worm her way into his life. Lana, if she accepts you, then great. But if not, that's her loss. Isn't your priority Henry? That's been going well. Yeah. But maybe it's the whole "adopted kid fantasy" thing... ...but I can't help thinking that if I don't screw it up... ...I might have an actual family. Look, Lana, I want you to have everything you wish for, I really do. Just because you have a family doesn't mean every day is a picnic. Unless, of course, you're a Kent. Well, to be honest, my parents aren't really getting along right now. I'm sorry, Clark. Do you want to talk about it? Later. You've got someplace to be. Okay. Clark. Whatever it is, your parents will work it out. After all, some people are just meant to be together. Lex. What's the most romantic restaurant in Metropolis? I'm sure there are a lot opinions on that, Clark... ...but personally, I'd have to go with La Petite Fleur. Could you score me a reservation for tonight? - Who's the lucky girl? - My mom. It's my parents' anniversary. My dad had a picnic, but now she's in Metropolis with your dad. They're in Metropolis? At LuthorCorp? On a Sunday? Yeah. Can you believe that he makes her work on her anniversary? To my father, there's no such thing as a personal life. Listen... ...since it's their anniversary, I could do better than reservations. What do you have in mind? Well, if you excuse me a minute to make a few calls, I'll explain. Accessing database. - Kern. - This is Green. I want you to terminate. Now. - You realize you'll forfeit the deposit. - There are people in there. I want you out. I understand. Our client has canceled the project. He believes there are people in the building. Hey, what are you doing? You think we broke into the office of one of the richest men in the world to plant bugs? We ain't leaving this place until we empty that vault. Bishop. Nicky. How long have we worked together? We're not thieves. We were hired to do a specific job. Job description's just been changed. Go out and check the other offices. Bishop, get the torch. Sign here. Okay. - Martha? - Yes. - Is something wrong? - No. It's just that when you said work couldn't wait till Monday... ...I didn't think I'd be the only one here. Thought you'd like to work in your new office. New office? I don't understand. Look inside the top left-hand drawer of the desk. Go ahead. Open it. Turn it over. "To Martha, with deep affection: L.L." I'm promoting you, Martha, which means I'll be needing you more in Metropolis. Which means you'll need someplace to work. Lionel... ...I'm flattered, really, but I can't accept this. And as far as working in Metropolis... ...this job is putting enough strain on my family as it is. Martha. I know how much you've given up to be... ...a farmer's wife, but with your brains and your talent... ...don't you deserve to make your own ambitions a priority for a change? We'll discuss it over dinner. Hey, love birds. Wrong place, wrong time. - Who is this? Martha? - I don't know. Put your hands up. Let's go! Get them in the air! Now! Clark. Clark! I don't suppose you know why there's a helicopter parked in our front yard. Lex is gonna take you to Metropolis. So you can take Mom to dinner. So this was your idea, was it? It was Clark's. I just offered to provide the transportation. Look, I don't know how things work in your house... ...but we think it's important to respect other people's privacy. - Dad. - It's all right, Clark. Mr. Kent. Since the day I moved to Smallville... ...I've done nothing but try to be a friend to you. And in return, you do nothing but lecture me with sanctimonious platitudes. I'm done listening to them. - Dad, that was not fair. - Everything was fine in this family... ...until we let the Luthors into our lives. - That wasn't Lex's fault. - Hey! I appreciate your concern, but it is not your responsibility to fix everything. So just stay out of it. Hey, Pyne. Got a little present for you. Lionel Luthor. Good, you just saved us a whole lot of time. Get him to open the vault. Too late, genius. You already burned the plate. Access: Section Two. How the hell did the cops get tipped off? What have you got in your hand? - Open it up. - Stop, you're hurting him. Lionel, please. Panic button, state of the art. Check him out. Let's go. Come on. A man in my position can never take too many precautions. Why don't you just let us go? You can avoid adding kidnapping to breaking and entering. You should listen to this woman. I find her advice invariably sound. - I think he's all right. - We should have left. If you'd kept to the plan, none of this would have happened. - What's wrong with you?! - Are you crazy? - Shut up! - You shut up! - What are you doing?! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Drop it now! All right. All right, all right, all right. Let's just settle down, okay? - Drop it, Pyne. - Just relax. All right. Relax. Let's take it easy. I'm gonna put my guns down. All right? Just gonna get the money, and we're gonna get the hell out of here. Get back to work on that vault. You're wasting your time, you know. There's nothing in there of value to any of you. Keep your eyes on them. We'll need them later for leverage. - More coffee? - Henry, why don't you get it? - Give Lana and I a chance to get a word in. - Sure, I'll be right back. This really is a cute place, Lana. - You've got great taste. - Thank you. And thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I know it can't be easy for you. Lana, you seem like a very together young woman... ...which is why I feel I can be completely candid with you. I don't want you getting too close to Henry. Mrs. Small, I don't know what you think... ...but I am not trying to interfere with your family. That's not what I'm worried about. Lana, when I married Henry, he was the editor of the Law Review. He was gonna run for Congress. Now he runs a law practice for lost causes out of our living room. He believes in what he's doing. Yeah, until it gets too difficult or he loses interest. Which he always does. You think he'll lose interest in me. Henry has two children in boarding school. He never calls them. And even when they're home, he doesn't have time for them. Or anyone else. Why are you telling me this? I'm trying to do you a favor. I do not want to see you get hurt the next time Henry's priorities suddenly change. So... ...what have you two ladies been talking about? We are live at the LuthorCorp Tower, where sometime earlier this afternoon... ...armed gunmen apparently entered the building, and are now... ...holding LuthorCorp chairman and CEO Lionel Luthor hostage... ...along with at least one unidentified female employee. - Mom. - Lf anybody tries to hurt your mother... - I'm not gonna let that happen. - Clark. Clark! I'm not gonna try and stop you, but I want you to be careful. I'm gonna follow you in the truck and get there soon. Dad, there's a faster way for you to get to Metropolis. You just have to talk to Lex. Get him out of here. - What? - I hired you to bug an office... ...not create a media circus. - Yeah? Well, we ran into a little snag. - Who is this? - Tell you what, Mr. Green. You show me your caller ID and I'll show you mine. - I want to talk to Kern now. - Kern's definitely not in charge anymore. Mr. Kent. I take it you've seen the news. If I hadn't been so bull-headed... ...and taken you up on your offer... ...Martha and I'd probably be on our way to dinner. Instead... Believe me. There's plenty of blame to go around. Lex, I was wondering... - I was wondering if l... - Sure, Mr. Kent. I'll give you a helicopter ride to Metropolis. Young man, you too. Stay behind the barricade. Let's go. Stand up and put your hands on your head. Stand up! Turn around. I can explain. Hold still. Keep your fingers linked. I'm listening. My name is Clark Kent. My mom's a hostage being held up there. Thought you'd play hero? Assuming you're who you say... ...you almost got your mom killed. Every opening in there is wired with alarms. The kidnappers control the security system. And they've threatened to shoot hostages if anyone so much as sets a big toe inside. Come on, hero. You're coming with me. Move it! So, what are we gonna do? They saw you kill Kern. They can ID us, Pyne. And I for one am not going down for murder. Understand me? We will deal with them when the time comes. I know what you're thinking. If I hadn't asked you to work today, you'd be at home right now with your family. I don't blame you, Lionel. It's just that Jonathan and I left on such bad terms. That's ironic. I had quite a row this morning too with Lex. If they kill us... ...those will be the last words we ever spoke to each other. Pyne, you're up. What the hell is this? I want you to monitor the radio channels. Nothing gets... It's okay. It's okay. Clark? - You know this kid? - Yes, ma'am. He's my son. Okay, you keep him away from the building or I'll arrest him. All right? - Lieutenant, I'm... - I know who you are. I'd appreciate an update on the negotiations. This way. - What happened? - I listened to the police. - I found a way into the building. - Really, how? No one's watching the Daily Planet. - You're not thinking about jumping. - It's the only way. - Clark, that's gotta be over 200 feet. - I can make it. You don't know that. - Besides, don't you have a fear of heights? - Lf we're not here to get Mom, then why? Listen to me. I am just as concerned about your mother as you are. But we can't afford to make a mistake that could get her killed. Where's the damn money? I told you there was nothing in there of interest to you. Check this out. Could be worth something. What the hell is this? Martha, perhaps the gentleman hasn't noticed... ...that I'm blind. Would you mind telling me what he's referring to? It's... ...some sort of metallic disk, shaped like an octagon. It's nothing, a keepsake. - Sawyer. - Where is my transportation? I told you, I need a show of good faith first. You give me one of those hostages. Okay. Fine. Get up. You got 10 minutes, then you can take this one out in a body bag. We're working on it. Stay cool up there. Stay cool. Whatever you do, don't hurt any of the hostages. Just stay calm. Yeah, well, how am I supposed to stay calm, huh? I opened up that damn vault expecting my retirement fund... ...and instead I find a bunch of files, green rocks all cut up into bars. - What else was in there? - What's it to you? Answer me and maybe I can help you. I don't know. Just what I told you. Oh, and some metal octagon-Iooking thing. Listen to me. Pack up everything. The files, the bars, the octagon. Yeah, then what? I know a way out of the building. But first, you let the hostages go. Pyne? Better take a look at this. - We got company. - Check it out. A window just blew out on the 30th floor. Get the team together, we're going in. Let's go. Move it. What the hell's going on? Sounds like a chunk in that safe is worth something to you. Tell you what, I want a million dollars and I want a way out of here. - You're in no position to negotiate. - This is not a negotiation. All right? We get out of here or nobody does. All right, listen to me. Luthor has a private elevator. It'll take you to a tunnel that leads to a garage three blocks away. Hey, Lionel. You been holding out on me? Is there some kind of secret way out of here? Oh, yes. And whatever that anonymous coward, your Mr. Green, is offering... ...I'll double it... ...in exchange for our lives... ...and the contents of the safe. Hear that, Green? Looks like we got us a bidding war. Look, no matter what Luthor is promising, you can't trust him. Oh, but I should trust you? Somebody who hides his own identity? Think I'd rather deal with Lionel. I'll match what he's offering, just don't hurt them. Don't hurt who, Lex? - Were you talking to those men up there? - Mr. Kent... ...whatever I'm doing is in the best interest of your wife and my father. Believe me. If I find out that you had anything to do with what's going on out here... ...you will pray to God you never set foot in Smallville. You believe me. Where's my mom? Where is she?! So as soon as the banks open, I'll have the money wired... ...to any account you choose, anywhere in the world. - All right, we got a deal. - Good. But I'm hanging on to everything till I get that money. All right. Bishop, pack up the stuff in the vault. So you'll tell who's on the other end of the line? You'd probably know better than I do. Why don't you think who your enemies are? Come on, lady, you can help out too. Pick up the files. Come on! Today! Come on! - Pick them up and put them with the rest. - Okay, I'm picking them up. I... All right, that's good. Get over there and help your boss up. Lionel. - Martha. The octagonal disk, where is it? - I don't know. Why is it so important? Come on, time's up. Let's go. Move. Move, move! What the hell happened? The cops cut the power. We've gotta go! Bishop, don't! Clark! Get out of here now! Clark! Clark! Are you alone? Answer me, are you alone? Clark! Clark. Are you all right? Lady, you and the kid get up, put your hands over your head, or I kill the old man. He's dead. Clark. Those files over there, burn them. There's one about you. We can't let it get out. Metropolis P.D., nobody move! Hands where I can see them! Clark. - How did you get inside? - The boy's resourceful, Lex. What difference does it make how he did it? He saved us, that's what's important. Dad. I did everything I could to secure your release. No, I'm sure you did a great deal. I'll send someone to the mansion for my things. I'll help them pack. Thank you. - What's that? - It's my resignation. There's no way I can keep working for Lionel. He had refined meteor rocks in his vault, a file on Clark. I can't believe I trusted him. Without that file, at least the police can't find out anything about me. To think I made this job such a big priority... ...and Lionel may have only hired me to learn more about Clark. Sorry, Mom. I know how important your work has been to you. It's not more important than you. Wait. Are you sure that this is the best thing to do? - Quit, I mean. - What do you mean? I thought you'd be happy about it. If you hadn't been working for Lionel... ...then we'd have no way of knowing that he was keeping tabs on Clark. So instead of staying away from him... Maybe we should take a page out of the Luthor playbook. - Sweetheart. You coming up? - In a minute. Subtitle by:
