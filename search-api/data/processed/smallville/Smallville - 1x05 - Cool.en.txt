and the chance of hooking up. If I recall, you're the one who wanted to come to this party. I didn't know it was gonna be so cold. It's like 20,000 degrees below zero. -It doesn't feel that cold to me. -What, are you from an ice planet? I'm gonna go thaw out by the fire. Have fun. Hey, Kent. You're friends with Chloe. Is she flying solo tonight? Believe me, Sean, you're not her type. Well, you'd be surprised. If you want, I could rub them for you. Well, nothing heats up the body like friction. Wow. I can't believe you just delivered that line with a straight face. All I did was offer to keep your hands warm, Chloe. -And he knows my name. -I've read your editorials in the <i>Torch.</i> -Pretty cool. -Well, thank you, Sean. I sit next to Jenna in bio class. Remember, you dumped her last week? -It was mutual. -So you're here trolling for fresh meat. Don't worry, Chloe. I'm not gonna make a move on you. No matter how pretty I think you are. Sean, Hail Marys down by the lake. Yeah. -Hey, can I get your number? -Why? You're never going to call. -I'll call you tomorrow. I promise. -Well, I won't hold my breath. -Come on, Sean, let's go. -Hey, Whitney, back pass. Did you just write your phone number down on Sean Kelvin's hand? Don't sound so shocked, Clark. Guys do find me attractive even though I don't have raven hair and the initials "L.L." That's not what I meant. -The guy's a dog. -Clark, relax. I just gave him my number to get rid of him. Get Pete. The taxi's leaving. -What's with you and that Chloe Sullivan? -What do you mean? -The girl from the <i>Torch.</i> You into her? -Another notch, dog. That's cold. Hey, hold on, pizza's here. -Sorry, dude. -Go ahead. I'll get the ball. Whoa. Hey, where's Sean? I don't know. He's probably in the back of some car. -The distributor gets 12.5. -Feed bill over six months at 5%. Plus the mortgage at 8.2. -Plus the harvester repairs gives us-- -Fifty-four thousand... ...five hundred and one dollars and thirty-eight cents. Hey, son. Look, I'm sorry. We didn't mean for you to hear all that. You don't have to protect me. Is it that bad? It's pretty bad. We might have to take out a loan. -Another one? The interest would put us-- -Clark, don't. -Maybe I can help. -You have. -Last season you saved us four hands. -I'm thinking bigger picture. Forget about this whole high-school thing and try out for a pro sports team. I could make a ton of money in endorsements. Just trying to lighten the mood. Much as we'd love to see your face on a cereal box... ...we'd settle for you getting to school on time. Forgot. -That's 65,200-- -Go. And one. -So did Sean call? -Negative. Not that I was waiting by the phone or anything. Maybe he got caught up. One time my sister didn't hear from a guy for a week. Turned out his grandmother died. As much as I appreciate the spotlight here, I'm fine. You're probably better off. Sean's a total dog anyway. He's not that bad, Clark. He's always been cool to me. Because you can't get past your Lana crush, don't knock us for making a love connection. I thought we were focusing on me. -I don't have a crush on Lana. -Then ask another girl out. -Like who? -Like Chloe. I'm not a crash-test dummy you can use to try out your dating skills. You, if you like Lana so much... ...why don't you just ask her out? And, you, stop acting like a Vegas bookie... ...picks your dates. And both of you? Treat me better. This is the flu season, young man. I don't even know why you came in today. I felt fine this morning, and now I can't get warm. Let's see. This can't be right. You're not a Popsicle. Let's try again. Here we go. Now you're giving me the chills. I'm sending you home. I'm all right. I'm actually feeling a little better now. Thanks. Whoa! I come in peace. -I'm so sorry. I didn't hear you. -I'm just glad you weren't welding. -What brings you out here? -Those artichokes of yours. -I need about 30 if you've got them. -Thirty. That's a lot. I'm hosting a dinner tomorrow for the local farming community. Just a talk about some financial options. A lot of farms are having money trouble. -Most people aren't looking for more loans. -I'm offering my role as an investor. Help people modernize and expand. This town once grew 20% of the corn in the state. Smallville was a heavy hitter. It just lost the drive to stay competitive. Or its connections. If this town ever had connections, they wouldn't have named it Smallville. Your husband hasn't kept his feelings about me a secret. I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts, even if you're not interested. Jonathan doesn't hate you. It's just, your family's track record hasn't been the best. Tell him I intend to change that. That's a great exhibit. Caught it in St. Petersburg. Whitney and I are going to Metropolis. I thought we'd check it out. Trying to give the quarterback some culture? It was his idea. He figures one afternoon at the museum, he's off the hook for six months. For someone who wants people to keep an open mind... -...you're quick to judge. -Hey, Whitney. What can I say? I just think you're with the wrong guy. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, I was just checking out some stuff for us to do tomorrow. Metropolis, remember? Some of the guys are pulling together and getting the fight on pay-per-view. It's tomorrow. And you gave them your money already. Yeah. Hey, we'll go next weekend, okay? I promise. -I'm really sorry, Lana. -Culture can wait. I'll make it up to you. See you. You know, she's free tomorrow night. Hey, Clark. This is the perfect time for you to ask her out. She's got a boyfriend, Lex. A high-school boyfriend isn't a husband, he's an obstacle. I bet if you ask Lana to go with you to the Radiohead concert, she'll say yes. -And if she says yes? -I'll give you the tickets. Why are you doing this? You're like the younger brother I never had. Someone should benefit from my experience. -I can't just ask her out. -The hardest thing... ...is telling the girl you love that you like her. I'll raise the bet. You ask her in the next 60 seconds... ...you get the tickets and I'll throw in a roundtrip limo ride. Starting now. -Hey, Lana, you busy? -Completely swamped. That's why I'm sitting in a coffee shop trying to wade through a Russian classic. That was a joke, Clark. Good. Because there's this thing tomorrow night. Define "thing." It's a concert. Radiohead, to be exact, and I've got a couple of tickets. Wow. Where'd you get these? A friend. Something came up at the last minute... ...and I was wondering if you'd like to go, you know, with me. -I'd-- -Just as friends. Definitely. I'd love to. Let me get this straight. You walked in to get a cappuccino... ...and walked out with a date with Lana Lang. It's not actually a date. Even with the "just as friends" rider, I'm impressed. How did you score the tickets? I'm guessing a certain follically challenged individual was behind it. Lex hooked me up. Actually, Chloe, I have you to thank. -What did I do? -You were right. I just had to get it out. Well, good. I'm glad. Maybe this is your chance. Chloe, don't I owe you a phone call? -I guess so. -What are you doing right now? Well, I've got to put the paper to bed. Maybe afterwards we could do something. Jenna, Jenna, wait up. Okay, I was playing barely hard to get. What's the problem? Clark Kent gets a date with Lana Lang... ...and suddenly there's no luck left for the rest of us. Sean, is that you? I've been waiting for you. Thought you might like to take a shower. Sean? Well, what are you waiting for? The water's nice and warm. Sean? Sean, what happened to you? I'm sorry, but I don't know what's wrong with me. Sean, you're really scaring me. What do you want? I just want to get warm. It's bad enough you ride that motorcycle, but do you have to repair it in the house? If I didn't, you'd never have a reason to be angry with me. I'll trade you. Do all the engine work you want, but come with me to Lex's. -We've already talked about that. -I talked, you grunted. I thought that I was rather articulate. Sweetheart, the Luthors have sold out anyone who's ever trusted them. They don't keep their word. "They" is Lex's father, not him. Be honest, you've never seen him be anything but generous. Arrogant and a little strange, yes, but he's been a good friend to Clark. -We have to at least hear him out. -Why? We need options, Jonathan. Our home is on the line. Our farm. You don't have to like him to listen. Besides... ...I already told him we would come. -Hello, citizens. -I'm not familiar with this child. -Where's the moody one, lives upstairs? -He's going on a date tonight. -Not a "date" date, but to a concert. -Who might this "not a 'date' date" be with? Lana Lang. Lex hooked me up with tickets and his limo. -He did? -It's okay if I go, right? Well, I guess Lex Luthor has worked out all of our evenings for us. Clark. Isn't Lana still going out with Whitney? She's not married, Mom. -<i>Hello?</i> -Bella. Bella, it's me, Sean. What do you want? Well, I thought we might get together, do something? Yeah, like that's gonna happen. Come on, Bell, we were good together once. Sure, I might have made some mistakes, but, you know.... -<i>Save it for some other girl.</i> -Bella. Bella! Chloe. Your online horoscope suggests that you try not to flaunt your excitement. Which will be hard, since you've waited for this date since your first growth spurt. I'll say this once more, then I'll print up bumper stickers. This isn't a date. All right. Just check Lana's outfit. If a girl wears something new, she thinks it's a date. -I thought you came over for fashion advice? -Burn that. What else have you got? I'll check the laundry basket. -Hello. -<i>Hey, Chloe.</i> -Sean, hi. -<i>Don't I owe you an apology?</i> -Guess who just called me. Sean. -Did he apologize for blowing you off? He said he wasn't feeling well. Chloe, I saw him go off with Jenna. Maybe she made him feel better. Well, he promised it was completely over with her. You like him, don't you? He may be a little intellectually challenged, but he's really hot. He begged to get together, just to talk. I told him he could bring me a coffee at the <i>Torch.</i> -Sounds like a date. -It's not a date. It's a fact-finding mission to see if he deserves a date. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Don't worry. I figure if you can take a risk with Lana, I can take a shot too. -Blue's a good color on you. -Really? Welcome. I'm delighted you decided to come. -Your house is very-- -Large? To put it mildly. The word "restraint" doesn't exist in my father's vocabulary. I'm sorry, are we early? I think we should go. -Wait, just because no one else came.... -That's if anyone else was even invited. -I don't think Lex would-- -Actually, I would. I did. But only because I knew you wouldn't have come otherwise. I know your farm's in trouble, Mr. Kent. Small town. So you thought you would take advantage of my family's problem. No. I thought I could help. Well, then, I guess we're here to listen. I've never actually sat in a limo before tonight. I did once. Nell got one to take us to the ballet. But it wasn't as nice as this. Beats another night of defensive reading. You've done it since we were kids. Whenever the world gets disappointing... ...you retreat into a book. There are worse things. No, you're right. It's just easier than dealing with my own life, you know what I mean? I do the same thing with astronomy. I look at different worlds and wonder if my life would be better there. You always seem to understand what I'm trying to say. -How come you know so much? -Magic. You don't believe in magic? I'll show you. Pick a card. All right. Three of hearts. Full of surprises. This is weird, huh? I felt like I had to explain tonight to Nell. I spent the better part of the day convincing people this was not a date. How about Whitney? -I didn't tell him. -You feeling guilty about that? He's hanging out with his friends, and I'm hanging out with mine. Exactly. And in Smallville tonight, police are seeking 17-year-old Sean Kelvin... ...after the mysterious death of fellow Smallville High student Jenna Barham... -<i>...whose body was found this afternoon.</i> -Oh, my God. -<i>Kelvin was last seen....</i> -Stop the car! Sean? Hello, is that you? Okay, this is interesting. -Clark, what's wrong? -It's complicated. Hang out here for a while. I want you to be safe. -Safe from what? -I promise I'll explain. -Will you wait for me? -Sure. I just want you to know that this is the best non-date that I've ever had. Sean? What's going on? I agreed to a cappuccino. If you think I'm skinny-dipping with you, try again, buddy. I'm sorry, Chloe. I don't have a choice. -What happened to you? -I can't stay warm. -Well, why don't you just sit by a fire? -Because I only get a quick fix. Body heat lasts longer. -No! -I promise it won't hurt, Chloe. Clark! -Clark, help! -Are you okay? My foot's stuck. You okay? Go! Run! -Did I thank you for that rescue yet? -I heard about Jenna... ...and I didn't want you to be next. Well, I finally find a guy I like, and he turns out to be homicidal. You deserved a lot better than Sean even before he tried to kill you. -That's sweet. I think. -Any idea what happened to him? Only thing I can find is a medical condition where there's damage... ...to the thermosensitive cells in the brain. The person literally can't stay warm. It's like a permanent case of hypothermia. -Sean's getting heat where he can take it. -Preferably from high-school girls. But, I mean, you saw the pool. You take heat out of water, you get ice. He's like-- He's like a battery that can't hold its charge. -We should call for help. -I'll take care of that. We need to get you home. Come on. You have to believe me when I say that almost getting my heat sucked... ...was not a passive-aggressive attempt to ruin your date. Lana. -Let's sit right here. -Okay. Thanks. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Shouldn't you be fifth-row center right about now? -Hey, Pete. -Where's Clark? I don't know. He saw that news report about Jenna and suddenly had to run. I heard that too. I always thought that Sean was a good guy. I guess we don't know people as well as we think. You've been friends with Clark for a long time. -Is he always so...? -Clark-like? Sometimes he's totally there and you think you know everything... -...and then there's this part that's.... -Mysterious. Yeah, that's it. Clark Kent, international man of mystery. Whatever it was seemed important. I can't believe there's anything more important to him than you. Lana, what are you doing here? Just reading. Pretty dressed up to be digging into a book. I'll catch up with you later. Pete, why don't you take your date for a spin in the limo. -She's not a date. She's just my friend. -Either way, I won't be needing it. Thanks. What were you doing in a limo? Just hanging out with a friend. Could you take me home? This can't be happening. Sean. Guess the generator works. Power must have blown. -Where were we? -You were explaining how you could... -...single-handedly save the family farm. -Jonathan. It's okay, Mrs. Kent, I understand your husband's skepticism. Your farm's drowning in debt, we both know it. I'm trying to offer you a hand, but you keep slapping it away. I learned a long time ago from a man much smarter than myself... -...that you need to solve your own problems. -Your father lived in different times. And he had his share of help. Seems government subsidies carried him through a number of lean years. -Where did you get these? -It's public record. I'm making a business offer. I had to do my due diligence. Why are you so interested in our family, Lex? Your son brought me back from the dead, Mr. Kent. When he reached in and pulled me out, he gave me a new life. Your father put his family's future over his own pride. Are you willing to do that? I know this is probably one of those times I should just let things go... ...but I'd kind of like to know what's going on. You went out with your friends, I went out with Clark. He invited me to a concert. So you two were just hanging out. -Right. -Was this a test to see what I'd do? -Why didn't you just tell me? -I knew you'd overreact. You go on a date with another guy, and I'm overreacting. It wasn't a date. Clark's a friend, that's it. -Whitney, look out! -Sean! Hold on! -Lana, are you okay? -My ankle hurts. I think I twisted it. -Where did Sean go? -I don't know. But I've gotta get you somewhere safe. Hold on. Come on. -You all right? -Yeah. Come on. Those lights are over at the Luthor house, just down the road. Come on. So you would give us the latest farming equipment and technology. All in exchange for our independence. My influence will be minimal but existing, yes. It's a partnership. -We could get a loan. -Or you can allow me... ...to help you get to the point where you never need someone like me again. -I'll admit, it looks generous. -It is. Which begs the question, what does Lex Luthor get out of all of this? I believe there's profit to be made. I'm not exactly in the charity business. Like father like son. Take some time to think about it. I'm sure you'll see the benefits outweigh your other options. To the future. -Lana. -She's okay. Where's Clark? Thanks for the warm-up, Clark. This kid sounds dangerous. I've got the gate down and the alarm on. You're staying here until they find Sean. Sorry about your date. No. I'm still getting the answering machine at home. -Remind me I don't have to worry. -He's Clark, Martha. -Here you go. -Thanks. -I'll go check the front gate. -It should be secure. -I'll check the generator. Where is it? -On the side of the house, but I can get it. Hello. -Are you Sean? -Yes, ma'am. -What do you want? -Who, me? I just wanna get warm. -Get away from her, Sean. -Clark. Go in the house, Mom. -Go now. -That's your mom? -She's hot. -Sean, you have to get to a hospital. What are they gonna do? Put me under an electric blanket? I need heat, Clark. Contact. That's the only thing that's gonna work for me. -Every person's another fix. -You're not getting into that house. Who's gonna stop me? You? I don't know what it is about you, Clark, but I haven't felt this good in two days. And when I'm done with you, there's your mom... -...your dad and Lana. -I'll never let you hurt them. Good morning. -I heard you took out a bank loan today. -Did you? After our conversation the other night, I was frankly surprised. Do you despise me that much? Believe it or not, Lex... ...some things actually have nothing to do with you. I decided to bet on my family. You're betting with Clark's future. -I'm just trying to insure it. -Yeah, so am I. With the bank? They'll kill you with interest while waiting for you to fail. At least with the bank, I know where I stand. I know you don't believe me, but I genuinely want to help you. When you change your mind, my offer still stands. You okay? Yeah. The memorial service is tomorrow. I was thinking how that could have been me. All because some guy expressed a modicum of interest in me. I thought I was stronger than that. Everybody's searching for their soul mate. It's not a sign of weakness. I can't believe both your dates went straight to hell, and I ended up with the limo. -How was that? -It was sweet. I've already hooked up with another date. -I'm swearing off men. -They're not all bad. Maybe you should just swear off heat-sucking horn dogs. Yeah, the next time a guy asks me out, I'm doing an in-depth background check. Come on, Pete. Clark will catch up with us later. Lana. -Hey, how's your ankle? -It's better, thanks. You never came back the other night. I did, but you were gone. I'm sorry. I wanted things to work out differently. Don't worry about it. I was thinking maybe we could try again sometime. How about Saturday? Whitney's taking me to the city. He's got the whole day planned. I think our non-date freaked him out. -What'd you tell him? -The truth. That we're just friends. I have to go. Lana. Why do you go out with him? Whitney, I mean. Because whenever I need him, he's there. Guess he makes me feel safe.
