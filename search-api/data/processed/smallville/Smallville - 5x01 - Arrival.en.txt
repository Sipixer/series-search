could not fall into the hands of a human. The three must become one. In approximately three hours, a meteor shower is predicted to hit Smallville. And I want you to have this. I somehow know that it's meant for you. Your curiosity always has a way of landing you in precarious positions. Where is it? This is about you getting your hands on that stone. I don't have the stone. Who did this? You know more than you're telling me, Chloe. Now, who took the element? You're talking like we're never gonna see each other again. I love you. I love you too. And now, the season premiere of Smallville. Kal-EI, you have traveled far. One journey has ended. A new journey is about to begin. Welcome home, my son. Please don't hurt me. Lie down on the ground. Open fire! Open fire! Where's the girl? She's irrelevant. We must find Kal-EI. Hush, Shelby. - Oh, my God. - Martha? Martha? Sweetheart? Martha? Mr. Kent. Are you okay? Mrs. Kent? Clark? Clark wasn't in here. He's all right. Martha? Mrs. Kent. Martha? Here! She's here. Sweetheart. I'm gonna get you out of here. It's okay. Easy, easy. - She's barely breathing. - She... She's gonna be fine. Okay. We're gonna get you out of here. Can you help me get her out of here? Come on. Come on. Chloe? Chloe? Where'd you go, chloe? Where'd you go, chloe? Everything's under control here, officers. I'm sure you're needed elsewhere. He has the key. Who are you? - Are you Kal-EI? - Who wants to know? It's not him. Kal-El would not bleed. Clark? Clark! I thought Krypton was destroyed. It was. But here in your Fortress of Solitude... ... the geography of our planet has been replicated for your training. I know there's a lot I can learn from you... ...but I have to get home where I'm needed. The meteor shower is only the precursor. A dark force from Krypton has been awakened, Kal-EI... ... and its sights are set on Earth. What do you want me to do? You must do as I tell you and study with diligence... ... for that is the only way to save this planet. Clark. Clark, I know you can hear me. Help. Clark, please help me. Chloe. Kal-EI, you must continue in your education. You cannot stop. She's my friend. She needs help. Your destiny is far greater than saving one human life. No, I won't let her die. Each time you let human-learned emotions guide you... ... you put the fate of the entire planet at risk. - <i>That is your weakness, Kal-EI.</i> - Please, I'm begging you. Very well. Under one condition: You must return to me before the yellow sun has set. I'll be back. I promise. Do not fail me, Kal-EI... ... or the consequences will be grave. You have my word. Hey. I think it's time you switch into super-Clark mode now. Super Clark? I know you run faster than a speeding bullet, Clark. Take me along for the ride. Go, Clark. - Lana, what happened? - They're still out there. - They'll kill us if they find us. - It's okay. You're safe now. Lana, you need to get off that leg. I'll call a doctor. You don't understand. We're not safe. No one's safe. - Don't touch me! - Lana, you're in shock. It's over. The meteor shower stopped. It's over. There's a man and a <i>woman...</i> ...they're right behind us. - They came out of... - Out of what? What did they come out of? A spaceship. - Where? - Landers Field. After what you've been <i>through...</i> ...it's normal for your mind to play tricks on you. Trust me. No, Lex, you trust me. I know what I saw. - We have to get as far away as possible. - Lana. Thank you. I wonder who's more freaked out right now. Me, knowing that I'm in a <i>hospital...</i> ...where they get their medicine via dogsled... ...or you, finally finding out I know your secret? - How long have you known? - I guess I've always had my suspicions. The quick exits, the miraculous recoveries, the lame excuses. But I think when I saw you catch a car... ...like it was a beach ball... ...that kind of confirmed everything. Why didn't you say anything? I figured if you wanted to tell me you were of the superpowered persuasion... ...you would when you were ready. On your terms, not on mine. You're a good friend, chloe. Obviously not good enough. There were so many times I wanted to tell you. Clark, I don't blame you. Loose lips sink ships, and God knows I've sunk my share of flotillas. What about Lana? Does she know? No. Well, I want you to know that I will never be the iceberg to your <i>Titanic.</i> And your secret will never, ever leave my lips. No matter what. I appreciate that. There are still a few blind spots, though. Like, how did we get beamed from the Kiwatche cave to the North Pole? And what was really going on in that 40-story igloo? Chloe, there's a lot of things about me that even I don't understand. The meteor rocks... ...they didn't make me who I am. So you're saying you were born this way? I wasn't born anywhere near Smallville. In fact, I wasn't born anywhere near this galaxy. Okay. Okay, so that would then make you, like, an... Yeah. But you... You look so... Human? I'm still the same person. Clark, I... I think you're so amazing. You save people's lives and take zero credit for it. To me, you're more than just a hero. You're a superhero. - Chloe... - I'm serious, clark. If more humans were like you, the world would be a better place. In what scientists are describing as an incredibly rare astronomical event... ... Smallville, Kansas was hit by the second meteor shower in 16 years... ... killing 23 people and injuring scores of others. They didn't get out. My parents didn't get out. Smallville needs you more than I do, Clark. Go. Go! Mr. Luthor? Mr. Luthor. Are you okay? The Disciples of Zod... ...they must be stopped. You're talking about the people from the ship. Their home is their only poison. Their home... ...is their only poison. Where are they? - He's dropping EP. - <i>Team to ICU, please.</i> - <i>Team to ICU.</i> - Got it. Oh, Martha Kent, if you were trying to scare me, you did one heck of a job. For a minute there I thought I lost you. I guess I found my way back. Has Clark come home? Sweetheart, please, you need to use all of your energy to get better... ...not to worry about Clark. Our son can handle anything that's thrown his way. Mrs. Kent. I have to say, you look a whole lot better without a china cabinet on your back. Hi, Lois. It's good to see you. - Lois was quite a hero out there. - You guys put a roof over my head. Least I could do is help when it came crashing down. - Where is Kal-EI? - Who are you? You know where he is. I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about. Okay. Everyone needs to calm down and count to 10, okay? So put the nice man down. Look, super freak, you wanna find your Kal-El buddy... ...you better start working on your communication skills. I know where Kal-El is. He's hiding out at the Luthor mansion. I can take you to him. Lana... Mom? Dad? Clark. - Thank God you're okay. - Where's my mom and dad? At the hospital. Your mom has a concussion and a broken leg... ...but she's gonna be okay. She's out of danger now. - What about Lana? - Lana's safe. It's chloe I'm worried about. - Why? - She was down in the cave with me... ...when the meteors hit. I was knocked out, and when I came to, she was gone. She must have escaped while you were unconscious. Or someone helped her out. What, you think I did? - Lex, how could l...? - Clark, before I passed out... ...there was a light brighter than anything I've ever seen. And I could have sworn I saw you standing right in its epicenter. I was nowhere near those caves. If you weren't with your parents when the meteors hit, where have you been? They insisted I get a head start. I got a ride on one of the military vans. Why do I get this feeling you're being less than honest with me? - I have no idea. - I'm beginning to get the <i>impression...</i> ...that lying is a habit of yours. - I don't have to listen to this. - Then be straight with me for once. If you're my <i>friend...</i> ...just tell me the truth. Were you in the cave when the meteors hit? No. Look, I understand that the police have their hands full... ...but Mr. And Mrs. Universe... - ...they're killing people. - Lois. Clark. You're okay. Yeah. You? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Have you seen my parents? - They're gonna be fine. - Where are they? Actually, we have another problem. Kind of a big problem, really. A happy, loving couple came through here... ...with superhuman powers and a really bad attitude. It got pretty ugly. What'd they want? They were looking for some guy named Kal-EI. You ever hear of him? Where'd they go? Kal-EI's in there. It's a trap. Get the door. Seal it. Lying is their way. Not for long. I heard you're looking for me. I'm Kal-EI. At last. Who are you? The last survivors of Krypton. - What do you want? - We want you to join us, Kal-EI. - And help us make this land our utopia. - I saw what you did at the hospital. - It's not utopia, it's murder. - The few must be sacrificed... ...for the sake of the many. Then sacrifice me. Because I'm not gonna let you kill anyone else. If that is your decision, so be it, Kal-EI. We cannot destroy you, Kal-EI. But we can lock you in a place where you will never be able to stop us. It is done. Clark. Are you okay? - Where are they? - They're gone. Do you know who they were? We need to get you to a hospital. Oh, my God. Our home. It's just wood and plaster, Martha. Fact is, our family's still standing. We might be a little bruised, but I think we're stronger for it. You're right. A house can always be rebuilt. It doesn't hurt to have a one-man construction team as a son. - Hi. - Hi. Don't worry. Things are gonna get back to normal soon. Actually, things will be a lot more normal around here than you think. My abilities are gone. - How? - Jor-El took them. But I'm not sure it's such a bad thing. All I've ever wanted was to be normal. And now, finally... ...I am. I don't think that this adjustment is gonna be quite as easy as you do, Clark. But that's why I'm lucky to have parents like you. Every time I woke up and had a new ability... ...you were there to help me adjust. And this time's no different. It is different. You can get hurt now. You're vulnerable. Isn't that what it means to be human? No, I can't imagine Jor-El giving up on you that easily. I took care of the danger he warned me about. If losing my abilities is the consequence, then I think he's done with me. Look, it's all in the past now. I'm ready to take a step to the future. Start by rebuilding this house one board at a time. Clark? Now, how could Clark possibly be here? We're in the middle of the Yukon. I don't know. I must have been dreaming, I guess. What's going on, Lex? I came to take you home. Clark, really, you shouldn't have. - Actually, I didn't. - Too sweet for words. How'd you get that frog in your throat? That's what happens when you get a neck massage from Barbie the Barbarian. Doctor says I shouldn't talk too much. Oh, gee, that's too bad. Don't get your hopes up, Smallville. It's not permanent. I gotta catch a plane in two hours for Geneva, and if I'm <i>late...</i> ...the general will court-martial me. - I did wanna say thank you. You were there for my parents. It means a lot. I'm sure it does. But not enough to give me this deluxe iris arrangement... ...from Main Street Florist. She's down the hall, room 258. Hope irises are still on your favorite-flowers list. Some things stay number one forever. Thank you. Lana, before the meteor shower, you came by the barn. You said some things. And three words sort of stood out. Clark, the sky was literally about to fall down on us. I never knew if I'd ever see you again. Right. We were in the middle of a crisis. Sometimes people say things they don't mean. Clark... ...I meant every word. The question is... ...did you? No more secrets. No more lies. Clark, I wanna ask you something. Do you believe in life on other planets? Actually, I do. I saw something in that crater. It was a spaceship, Clark. It was unbelievable. Subtitles by
