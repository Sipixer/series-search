May I ask why? -Is there a problem? -No. No, of course not. It's just that the Luthors have been banking here for 12 years. -It's quite a shock. -I'd like it all in cash. We'll do our best. -Can I get your signature? -Certainly. Mr. Luthor... ...may I see your driver's license, please? Why? This signature doesn't match our records. I just need to verify your ID. I'm standing right here in front of you. What more do you need? I'm sorry. It's bank policy. I need the money now. Fill the bag! Lex, what's going on? Get out of my way! Tina, where did you get this? Promised I'd solve all of our problems. Please tell me you didn't rob the bank yesterday. I didn't. Lex Luthor did. Stop it. Stop it, Tina. You promised that you wouldn't do that anymore. -I did it for us. -Somebody could have gotten hurt! Mom, I'm fine. Now we can afford to have the perfect life. -Tina, nobody's life is perfect. -Lana's is. Stealing isn't the way to solve our problems. I'm taking it back. I'll say I found it in a dumpster. No, Mom, come on! We deserve to be happy! Come on! Mom! 911 emergency. Hello, is anyone there? Hello. Hello, is anyone there? Sorry. It's nothing. This is incredible. Why would Lex Luthor need to rob a bank? I've seen some pretty strange things in my day, but this definitely takes the cake. Well, almost. He got away with $ 100,000. I know Lex. It wasn't him. Clark, I know that he's a friend of yours, but you saw him with your own eyes. I don't know what I saw. There must be some kind of reasonable explanation for this, I hope. Me too. I'd hate to think I have an evil twin. Lex, we didn't hear you pull up. May I come in? I promise I'm not packing heat. Lex, how come you're not in jail? Because I was hosting a reception for 200 fertilizer distributors in Metropolis... -...at the time of the robbery. -The police have any leads? None. That's why I wanted to talk to you. Your name was on the witness list. -Did you actually see this person? -Yeah, he looked just like you. Except his fingerprints and signature didn't match mine. Are you sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you? What's gonna happen now? Hopefully, the money will turn up. In the meantime, the tabloids will have a field day. I'm sure certain people's opinions of me will be cemented in stone. I gotta get to work. I'm sorry you got thrown through that window. -I promise, I'm not a criminal mastermind. -I know. A criminal mastermind would have worn a mask. Come on. Move it. That's the stuff. Come on, you can do it. Hustle. Get on up there. Get on up there. You can do it. That's the stuff. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Hustle, hustle, hustle. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Keep your eyes in your head, man. Kent! Are we boring you? I'm sorry. My head hurts. You need to get some blood pumping. You and Ross are next. Come on down, boys. Come on. Put a little muscle into it. Ross beats you, it's 10 laps. Come on, Clark. Let's go. Move it, move it. Looks like someone's doing laps. Clark, man, what's wrong? Clark, man, what's wrong? Clark! Kent, are you all right? Kent, what happened up there? So when you have these flashes, you can see through anything? People, objects? Sometimes I see through things. Other times, it's like an x-ray. There's no warning? This just happens? Well, I get a headache, and then it hits me. The first time, I thought I was hallucinating. Then it happened again. Clark, I'm sure there's some way to control this. You guys, I can see through things. How do you control that? You gotta practice, Clark. Your eyes have muscles just like your legs. Your mom is right, son. All you have to do is you have to figure out a way... ...to condition them so that you don't get these random flashes. That sounds great. How am I gonna do that? Lana, you have a visitor. Hey, Lana. Tina, I didn't see you at school today. Is everything okay? Yeah. My mom's not feeling well. But she's better, so.... So you quit cheerleading and Nell banishes you to the garage. She's got clutter issues. I'm trying to help resolve them. -Has she forgiven you for quitting the squad? -Not yet. Well, at least now you have some more time for your unpopular friends. Tina, you're not unpopular. What happened to the girl who didn't care what people thought about her? She went to high school. At least your mom doesn't try to run your life. You know, you're lucky that Nell cares about you. If something were to happen to my mom... ...nobody would take me in. I'd probably be shipped off to a foster home or something. -Thanks for that burst of cheer. -Well, what do you want me to say? You have the perfect life. You want it? You can have it. I'd settle for the outfit. Wouldn't it be cool if we were sisters? If anything happened to my mom, do you think that Nell would adopt me? Tina, nothing's gonna happen to your mom. Did it happen again? -Let's go home. -No, I'm okay. Didn't you need to go to the antique store? Hello? Mrs. Kent-- I mean, Martha. How are you? -Good. How's business? -Couldn't be better. I'm doing so many estate sales in Metropolis, I'm thinking of selling the place. That would be a shame. I thought you loved this store. Not really. I never wanted this life. It just kind of happened. Is Tina around? I thought I saw her come in. She's at Lana's. They're inseparable these days. -Really? I could have sworn that-- -You must be seeing things. I need some air. I'm gonna go for a walk. -I came by to pick up the lamp. -Lamp? The one you were restoring for Jonathan? Oh, yes. Silly me. It's in the back. It's not quite ready, it's-- I found this under the chest. I'm such an airhead. A client paid me in cash. I've been looking for this all day. That's a lot of money. You should be careful. Thanks. Why don't you stop by next week, it'll be ready then. Mrs. Kent, you forgot your purse. Looks like we're both airheads today. Bye. Clark! Mom, are you all right? Clark! Police found the truck. Abandoned out by the Stewart farm. -Did anybody else see the driver? -No. I could have sworn it was you, Clark. I guess I'm not the only one with a vision problem. I don't understand. How did they get your keys? I have no idea. I only went into the antique-- What is it, Mom? Nothing. It's just that Rose Greer was acting very strange. I found $5000 in cash under a dresser. It had a Smallville Savings and Loan band on it. She said a customer paid her, but-- -You think it's from the robbery? -It crossed my mind. Wait. Rose took your keys, turned into Clark, and then tried to run you down? -You're right, it's crazy. -I don't think so. What? I saw a flash of Tina Greer's skeleton. It was weird and green. It didn't look human. You know, like the ones you see in anatomy books? That's probably because Tina was born with a soft-bone disease. They had her on all these experimental drugs. Doctors didn't believe she'd see first grade. She did get better, right around her 3rd birthday. Right after the meteor shower, wasn't it? Yeah. -Clark, what do you think Tina's doing? -I don't know. I saw the same weird skeleton flash just after the robbery...I think. I just wish I could control this. What if you try focusing it, you know, like a telescope? You could start with something small. Try to tell me what I have in my hand right now. It's your pocketknife. You could see through my hand. No, you always carry your knife in that pocket. Sweetie, what's wrong? You lied to me about my mother. -May I help you? -Roger Nixon, Metropolis Inquisitor.</i> Get off my car. It's a hell of a picture, Lex. It really boosted our sales. I've read comic books with less fiction than your rag. Well, how about this? Is this fiction? It's your juvenile record. Fascinating reading. Must have taken a truck of your dad's money to keep those people quiet. Those records are sealed. I'm a resourceful guy. I saw that picture yesterday, and it got me to thinking of a follow-up. "Lex Luthor's Wild Youth in Metropolis." Does the name Club Zero ring a bell? -You print one word about that, I'll sue. -Lawsuits take years. The genie will be out of the bottle, and all the people will know... ...that the new and improved Lex Luthor is nothing but a facade. You know what I think, Rog? If you wanted to print that, it would already be in the paper. -I think you're looking for a payoff. -It's a business proposition. $ 100,000 and these records will disappear forever. I'd question your integrity, but you're a journalist. Did your father really think he could hide you here forever? You've got 24 hours, and this hits the front page. Lana, I didn't lie to you. I told you your mother would have been proud of you, and she would have. She loved you. You told me a fairy tale about a woman who led the perfect life. Bu that life was a lie. You said she loved cheerleading. She hated it, but was afraid to quit. She didn't want to stay in Smallville. She wanted to see the world. Should I have told you your mother was unhappy? I would have liked the truth. I told you what I thought you could handle. Your mother was like any other teenager. She had her ups and her downs. I feel like I spent my entire life trying to measure up to a Laura Lang who didn't exist. You're reading the diary of a 17-year-old girl. It's a snapshot. It's one time in her life. It's like I wrote this myself. The truth is, your mother was the brightest, most beautiful girl in her class. Do you know she was picked to give the graduation speech? I guess the diary ended before that happened. You should have heard the speech she gave that day. What did she say? Everything that had been bubbling up inside her for 18 years. She said she felt suffocated in Smallville. -Do you have a copy? -No. But I'll never forget the first line. "I never made a difference here... ...but maybe my children can." Hello, Clark. Is everything okay? You guys ever notice anything strange about Tina Greer? Nothing that would require the intense concentration you're exerting to look at her. The only thing weird about Tina is the amount of time she spends idolizing Lana. She's practically her clone. Come on. Let's go. Lana! -I swear, that girl's got you LoJacked. -How do you like the sweater? It's great. I've got one just like it. I know. I got it at the same store. I've been going on a shopping spree. Look, I even found this emerald necklace in the antique store. Why am I not surprised? See you at lunch. Hey, are you okay? I stopped by your house earlier and Nell said you weren't in the best mood, so.... -I'm fine. Don't worry about it. -Good, because I need a favor. My mom's moving to Metropolis full-time, but she doesn't wanna pull me out of school. So I was thinking I can move in with you and Nell. For how long? I don't know. A couple months. I mean, my mom would pay you guys. Trust me, money is not a problem. Just name your price. I could even get a horse. We could go riding together. I mean, wouldn't that be cool? Yeah. Just give me some time to think about it. -Are you sure your mom's okay with this? -Of course. She knows that we're best friends. It was her idea. Just let me run it by Nell first. She's kind of particular-- Nell loves me. Look, I don't understand. I thought that you'd be happy. People even say that we look alike. We could be sisters. I'm just not sure it's such a good idea. Okay, I see. So it was all a lie? You were pretending to like me, then when I come to you... ...in my hour of need, you blow me off? -Tina, calm down. -You should have said yes, Lana. It would have been perfect. What's your glitch, huh? Why do you keep staring at me? I don't know. Sorry. -What are you doing home so early? -Having more vision problems? I controlled it. Once. Sort of. I concentrated, and it worked. -Great! -What'd you concentrate on? -Tina Greer's locker. -What did you see? The money from the bank robbery. I was just locking up, deputies. How can I help you? We're looking for your daughter. She hasn't come home yet. What's the problem? The stolen money was recovered in her school locker this afternoon. You're kidding. My Tina? How could she be involved in this? That's what we'd like to ask her. Would you bring her to the station when she gets home? Certainly. We'll cooperate in any way we can. By the way, who told you the money was in her locker? Some kid with an anonymous tip. Clark, what are you doing? I'm just trying to figure out how much change I have inside. You could always take it out and count it. Where's the fun in that? Did you hear about Tina? They found the money from the robbery in her locker. Really? She actually cornered me today and asked if she could come live with me and Nell. Just what you need, a bank-robbing roommate. I told her it wasn't such a good idea. I've got enough problems with Nell without adding more to the mix. I always thought you and your aunt were really close. She wants me to be something I'm not. It's like having a dual identity. There's the person that everybody sees... ...and the person that you wanna be. I know the feeling. That's why I came here. I think you're the only person who sees me for who I truly am. I want to thank you for that. -What about Whitney? -Forget Whitney. I've had my eye on you, just like you've had your eye on me. I don't know how you found out about that money... ...but you should have stayed out of my life, Clark. Well, there's no sign of Tina or Lana or.... Are you positive you saw her turn back into Tina? I think the meteor shower did something to her bones. -So she can change appearance at will? -Yeah, and it gives her strength. -What should we tell the police? -Nothing. Tina can turn into whoever she wants... ...and I'm the only one who can tell the difference. Pete, you throw that rubber spider again and I'm going for my staple gun. Mind if I come in? The girl who writes for the pom-pom parade is, no surprise, out with mono. This week's editorial? My semiannual "Where are our priorities?" rant. For what it's worth, I really like what you've done with the paper this year. Well, that puts you in the majority of one. I'm sorry about the pom-pom crack. Once I hit take-no-prisoners mode, it's hard to shut it off. Actually, I admire it. You know who you are, and you go for it. Well, I appreciate the compliment. However, I know you haven't come down to this hole to give me a pep talk. The Torch prints the graduation speech every year, right?</i> Having transcribed last year's snore-fest, that's an unfortunate yes. -What year? -1977. That's P.C. -P.C.? -Pre-computer. When disco ruled the earth. Anything before then is gonna be H.C. -Hard copy. -You catch on fast. Let's see. '77, here we go. "Saturday Night Fever" was their prom theme. Styx won group of the century.... Wow. Someone got in the administration's collective face. "Due to the controversial nature of this year's graduation address... ...the editors have elected not to run the text in this issue of the Torch."</i> Meaning, ironically, it's probably the only one worth reading. Maybe I could track something down for you. Do you know who gave this speech? My mother. Can I fix you a drink? I'd just as soon get my money and get out. Of course. I assume I don't have to count it? I've even supplied the bag. You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you? You'd think with all the money my father spent, he could make things disappear. Maybe he's not as smart as he thinks. The original. Have a nice life. If you walk out that door, I will make you disappear. What are you going to do? You gonna have me killed? No, you'll be very much alive. But there won't be any evidence of your existence. What are you talking about? Driver's license, passport, social security number, bank account, will all be erased. With one call, I can ensure that there will be no record that you actually walked this earth. You're bluffing. Call your bank. See if your account still exists. That is, if your cell phone hasn't already been disconnected. What did you do? Don't worry, Roger. I'm gonna give you a new identity. One that's a little less upstanding. Maybe a murderer. Maybe a drug dealer. Either way, you lose your job, your house and your family. I'll give the money back. Then we'll be even. No, we won't. Because I also know your brother works for Juvenile Court. What'd you tell him? Steal the records and you can make some quick cash? -He could do time for that. -Leave him out of this. I didn't get him involved, Roger. You did. You came into my life thinking you could shake me down... ...because I was some spoiled, rich brat who needed his daddy's protection. Trust me, when I make things disappear, they stay buried. What do you want from me? Your help. My father's obsessed with the Daily Planet.</i> But I know the Inquisitor's read by the people. They're the ones I'm interested in.</i> I will feed you stories. You will print them. Any negative stories about me, you will kill. You will be at my disposal, 24/7. Follow me. -What happened to your car? -I drove it off a bridge at 60 miles an hour. How are you still alive? That's the mystery I need your help solving. Clark, what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? Sorry, it's nothing. I wasn't sure it was you. -This is a bad time. -No. I was out jogging, didn't wanna go home, kind of ended up here. You and Nell are still fighting. How'd you know? Just perceptive, I guess. Found my mother's diary. Discovered that a lot of the things that I've been feeling, she felt too. That's great. Isn't it? It's great and it's frustrating and it's scary. Like she could see right through me. Do you ever feel like that? More than you know. When I was reading her words, it was like she was talking to me. And then she was gone. Well, you're lucky. You're lucky you got at least that. Have you ever tried to find your parents? Your biological parents, I mean? Not really. I figure they're a million years away from my life now. If you could ask them a question, what would you ask? What happened? Why'd they let me go? How do I make sense of all the strangeness in my life? I guess neither of us will ever get a straight answer. I hope you find what you're looking for. I thought you were working on a project. I finished early. I thought I'd spend some time with the best boyfriend in the world. I'd love to, but I've got that trig test tomorrow. Right. I forgot. That's okay. We've got the rest of our lives. What's gotten into you? It's the new me. You like? I definitely could get used to it. Do you need a ride home? I'm covered. Can I borrow your jacket? It's a little cold. Yeah, sure. I'll see you tomorrow. So Tina Greer can bend her bones like a contortionist and become anyone she wants? I saw it with my own eyes. I'm sorry. This is usually Chloe's territory. I cover girls, football and general guy stuff. She does the tales of the unexplained. Why not give her a call? I did. She said she's busy with something else. That's like getting turned down by The National Enquirer.</i> Why are we friends? Because even when I think you're whacked, I show up ready to rumble. Great, it's closed. Clark, man, haven't you ever watched Cops?</i> The last place Tina will hide out is in her mom's store. Earth to Clark. -Is everything okay? -We need to get in here. -Why? -Just-- It's a hunch. Hey, Clark, what are we looking for? -Who's that? -It's Tina's mom. Damn. How'd you know she was in there? -Because I can see right through the door. -Very funny, Sherlock. -How do you think she died? -Broken neck. I'm guessing. My call, Tina's already on a bus to Metropolis. I don't think so. Why's she writing Lana's signature? You said Tina was obsessed with her. -She's gonna take it to the next level. -She wants to kill Lana? Worse. She wants to become Lana. Found your journal, Mom. The one you kept in high school? Suddenly all these conversations don't seem so one-sided. Tried to find your graduation speech, but they didn't print it. Every time I get closer to you, something pulls me away. Lana. -Whitney, what are you doing here? -Your aunt said you went riding. I just followed the path. Just talking to my parents. They're dead, Lana. You have this great life, and you can't even see it. You have no right to be unhappy. They're not coming back, Lana. Deal with it. What are you saying? I'm saying you don't deserve your life. I do. What are you doing here? I was gonna ask you the same thing. -Where's Lana? -I don't know. Nell said she came out here, but I can't find her. What's the matter, Clark? Not feeling well? -Tina, where's Lana? -Tina doesn't exist anymore! I know what it's like to live with a secret. I know what happened to your mother. That was a lifetime ago. And don't worry about Lana. You'll be joining her very soon. I thought I killed you once. I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice. Where's Lana? Who are you? Where is she? She's dead. Lana! Hey, I heard what happened. Did you come by to see if I was okay? As concerned as I always am about your personal well-being... ...I'm not here to see you. I did some digging. How did you find this? If I told you, I'd have to kill you... ...and it looks like you've had enough trauma for one night. -Chloe, thank you. -No problem. -How's Tina? -She won't be able to hurt anyone else. I don't understand why a girl would do all that. I do. You go through life with a gift you have to keep a secret. When you see everyone around you being normal, you get jealous. You just wanna be somebody else. You really like her, don't you? Mom, if you could see anything, what would you do? Learn to close my eyes. As principal of Smallville High, I would like to introduce...</i> ...the valedictorian of the class of 1977, Miss Laura Potter.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, graduating seniors, good evening.</i> Those familiar words open every graduation address at Smallville High...</i> ...and I use them deliberately, because the rest of my speech will not be so reassuring.</i> I never made a difference here, but maybe my children can.</i> When I first came to Smallville High, I was full of hope.</i> I thought the world was gonna be....
