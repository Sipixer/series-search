I felt as if something was calling me home. Everything we've been trough with Jor-El... I just wanted to close that chapter in my life. There is a darkness in me that I can't always control. Well, you've certainly seen me at my worst. And at your best. Three relics... hidden around the world... by scientifically advanced ancient cultures... Water and this one means fire... and the one up there that air. Put them together... Where is it? God help me. By now you'd know that Lana... is nothing more than my mothers pawn. Martha, Clark still feels responsible... for my heart problems. If you'd found out something... Something someone didn't want you... to know about them... Would you tell them? What did I do? You trusted me. I can't let you walk out, not again... That's why this time it'll be different. This time? You are an amazing young man, Clark, you make life and death decisions every day. Trust your gut! Greed will drive others to hunt the Stones... and will drive the world to famine... war and the earth's ultimate destruction. Where is the stone? I gave it to Lana. She is the chosen one and we all know that. Clark's more connected to this than any of us. It's Clark, he's... A man can't deny his true nature. It's time to fulfill my destiny. I am the villain of the story. And now Season Finale of Smallville. I have to applaud you, Lana. I raised my son... to have a willpower... that couldn't be broken by anything. Except his love for you, apparently. What do you want from me? The stone. That one Lionel gave you. Lionel? He never gave me the... I'm gonna find it whether you help or not. Clark! It's okay, it's just a bad dream. You scared the daylights out of us yelling like that. What? You kept yelling "It's coming!" over and over. 4x22 Commencement She was coming at me, it happened so quickly. I don't even remember stabbing her. Lana, I want you to take a deep breath and try to relax. Lex, a woman is dead because of me. I killed her. No, no! You had no choice. You did what anyone would do if their life was at stake. I have to tell Jason. She was his mother. I'll deal with Jason. Lex, there's a body in my apartment. I have to go the police. I have to tell them what happened. Lana, I'm not sure that's such a wise idea. Genevieve Teague was a powerful woman, married to an extremely powerful lawyer. Even though it's clearly self defense... Edward Teague is gonna make sure... the jury sees otherwise. What's gonna happen to me? I'm gonna go to prison. No. I'll hire one of the best defense attorneys... in the country. And once he arrives from New York, we'll go to the authorities. Ok. Thank you. You have to trust me. Until the lawyer arrives, I want you to stay here and talk to no one. My purse. Where's my purse? Don't worry. It's still there. I'd never take it from you. Mr. Luthor. We have a situation. It's gonna be okay. I can't help but feel this is some kind of warning. Clark, it was nothing but a bad dream. You used to have nightmares all the time... when you were little, remember? This time is different. It felt so real. And if it is a warning I need to do something. Yeah, what you need to do... is you need to get some shuteye.. so that you're not half asleep tomorrow... when they hand you that diploma. Your dad's right, Don't let a nightmare spoil your high school graduation. Nightmare? So that's what all this commotion is about? Lois. You know, if it makes you feel any better... I have'em all the time. I had this one last week... really scary! This, uh,... guy wearing a red cape. Oh, that sounds horrible, Lois. Yeah! There's something I wanted to tell all you guys, I just didn't know when to, so I guess 2 A.M. in the morning... is good as time as any. What is it, Lois? Oh, The general recruited me... on a recon mission to track down my sister, the grifter, in Europe. So, we are headed for Heidelberg tomorrow. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Clark, I know how devastated you must be... but if you could just... keep your tears to a minimum, I'd appreciate it. I'll try. Thanks. Mr. and Mrs. Kent, I just wanted to say thanks for everything. You guys are... like the mom and dad I've always wanted to have. Lois, we want you to know that... you are welcome back here any time. Actually... We'll all miss you, Lois. I'll miss you all, too. Him... not so much. I'd thought I do Miss Lang a favor and... tidy up the place a bit. She left a quite a mess, quite a mess. What are you looking for, dad? The good housekeeping seal of approval? You know, for a woman without a heart... Genevieve Teague certainly did have a lot of blood. You didn't come here to do a postmortem... on Genevieve Teague. What is it you want? I'd like to offer a trade. Lana Lang's freedom... in exchange for the, hmm, artifact she has in her possession. Dad, don't you think your search... for these three ancient stones... is starting to border on the fanatical? Let me remind you, Lex, it was you who looted the ruins of Egypt... to get your hands on one of those stones. Trust me, Lana Lang has nothing to do with this. Oh, so chivalrous of you. You are the gallant hero trying... to protect the damsel in distress. I'm warning you. Leave her alone! But all your life you've had a, uh, a tendency to let the damsel... lead you straight into the mouth of the dragon. Your feelings for Miss Lang, don't let them cripple your common sense, son. I expect to see that stone by noon tomorrow. It would be a shame if, um, Genevieve's corpse... were delivered to the sheriff... with Lana Lang's DNA as postage. Sir, you better take a look at the right ascension. How long has there been activity? There was not anything there 10 seconds ago. It just came out of nowhere. My God, it's headed straight for Earth! I realize hand-eye coordination... isn't one of your best qualities. Here, let me help you with that. Lois, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do without you. Ah, come on, Clark, your future is laid out right in front of you. You're gonna go to community college, major in agriculture, probably minor in law enforcement. And then you and Lana gonna have... a nice little church wedding. Excuse me? It's written in the stars and you know it. It's only a matter of time... before you join the bowling league... and take over the family farm, and then, well, you and Lana can bring little Clark Jr. into the world. I think you're hallucinating. No. Hallucinating would be imagining... Clark Kent going off to the... big city to make his mark in the world. I'm just being realistic. Lois, what are your big plans after Europe, you're gonna go back to school? Maybe actually stay a little while? I have a feeling that if I'm gonna get an education, it's gonna be in the real world. And I took this career test in some magazine. It said that my perfect job would be, uh, radio disc jockey. That makes sense, you talk enough, there won't be any dead air. You mock me now Smallville, but you just wait and see. Journalism, do you ever thought about that? You wrote some half decent articles... in your short lived career at the Torch. Naw, kill me first. Even if I could spell, the last thing I'd wanna do... is spent my time in a newsroom. With my luck I'd probably end up across the desk... from the most bumbling reporter on the masthead. You know what? You actually look handsome for a change. I'll take that as a compliment. Look, I know we've had our disagreements in the past. And I will be the first to admit... that I've made own little hobby... to bust your chops. Gotten used to it. Besides, I know I haven't been the most gracious host. Look, I just want you to know, Clark, that when I'm sitting in the audience today... at your graduation... and you stand up on that stage... in front of all those people... I wanna be looking up at you and thinking one thing. What's that? Please, god, don't let him trip! See you. Garon Cooper. Caroline Creese. Cody Davis. Erica Feldman. Lauren Feldman. Did you see Lana yet? Still no sign. I'm starting to get worried. Lana's never so much as had a tardy day. She's not gonna miss her high school graduation. She'll be here. Michael Hall. Holy Harold. Tanya Hart. Kate Horton. Michael Hoover. Hannah Jacobs. Michelle Jewel. Oh, there's Clark. Clark Kent. Lana Lang. Have you seen her? Lana Lang. Attention! Stay calm! By order of the Federal Emergency Dekret: All non-essential personnel should evacuate... the area within a 50 miles radius. In approximately 3 hours, a meteor shower is predicted in Smallville. Oh, My God. Not again. Please stay calm. There's no need to panic. Please seal your home and carry only necessary items. Hey, Clark. can you believe it? Twice in 16 years, I mean, this is just crazy! Smallville's gotta have some sort... of extraterrestrial bulls eye! That's pretty weird, eh? There's gotta be some kind of connection in the cosmos. I mean this is not just a coincidence. Yeah, I'm sure there is some sort of explanation. Well, there's just something in Smallville... that is screaming for celestial attention. I mean, lightening not strike twice in the same place... without some kind of lightning rod, right? I just wonder what that is. I-I'm not sure, but we don't much time, we need to find Lana. You're right, and if anyone can find her... with moments to spare, it's you, Clark. Why did you say that? I don't know, because you have a way... of getting things done in half the time... a normal person gets anything done. And I'm not normal? No, of course you are normal, Clark. You're as normal as they come. Now, let's hurry and to find Lana. Looks, I'm sure she's already out of town. They've evacuated half of the county. They probably saw her running in late... and told her to leave town. That's exactly you two need to do, right now. Thanks for the tip. Now listen to me, Smallville, If there's one thing that the General has taught me... is that you cannot panic... in times of crisis. Do you hear me? Okay, whatever happens, you have to stay calm. You cannot panic. Because if you lose your cool... Lois! What? You're panicking. Fine. Clark, where the hell have you been? We gotta pack up. I've been looking for Lana everywhere. I can't find her. Sweetheart, she's probably already been evacuated. I want you to go up to your room and pack... everything that's necessary. Your mom and I will take care of everything down here. No, I gotta do something first. Don't think for a second this is your fault. I came to Smallville in a meteor shower. Now it's happening again and it's all because of me. Clark, there is absolutely nothing you... could have done to prevent this. We don't know that. There's gotta be something I can do. Clark, you don't have time. I don't have a choice. Lex, what are you doing here? I wanted to offer to you and your parents... a safe passage out of here in a LuthorCorp jet. The roads will be pretty ugly soon. Thanks, but I think we'll be okay. Clark, why take the risk? The first meteor shower caused me... irrevocable damage. Trust me, you don't want to be near here when the next one hits. Thanks, Lex, but I think my dad's... gonna wanna pack up the truck... with as much as we can take. I understand. Some things simply can't be replaced. Clark, my scientists have identified... what seems to be an inner chamber... inside the cave wall. Really? I was wondering if your research into the cave... might have turned up anything similar. No. Lex, why are you so interested... in the caves when there's... a natural disaster headed our way? Clark, if anything in this town is irreplaceable... it's those caves. They've been around for thousands of years... and they can very well be destroyed in the next... Well, let's hope they're not. I really need to get to help my parents. Good luck, Lex. Thanks, Clark, but I don't believe in luck. It's our wits and our fortitude to keep us safe. And I'm sure you have more than enough of both. Stay safe. You're my father. Talk to me. Tell me what you've done! "It was you who brought this upon yourself, Kal-El. " What did I do? "I sent you here to unite the 3 elements. " The stones? They have nothing to do with me! "But they do, Kal-El. For the knowledge... of the universe is meant for you only. " "Yet you chose to deny your heritage. " "Today, you will witness the consequences. " Then you send the meteor shower? "I have done nothing, Kal-El. "Human blood has stained one of the elements... and awakened a great danger... from the darkness of the space. " What can I do to stop it? "There is nothing you can do... to prevent what is already in motion. " "But the meteor shower is just beginning, Kal-El. " "I warned you that the elements could not fall" "into the hands of a human. The three must become one. " "It is the only way to save Earth from total annihilation. " I don't know where they are! I don't have time to find them! "If you don't unite them at once, you, my son," "will be seared by a fire from the sky" "even you can't survive. The future of mankind" "rests in your hands, Kal-El. " Please.. help me! I can't do this alone! I can't believe I almost forgot this! That's great, sweetheart, I almost have the truck all loaded up. Great. Shelby, load up. Clark, great. Would you help me secure the truck? You have to go without me. What? Do I have to remind you, Clark, that the last time we had a meteor shower, was full of kryptonite. If the same happens today it could kill you. You have to come with us. I spoke to Jor-El. He told me I have to find the other two stones right now. And unite them with the one in the cave. No. You are my son. You're not gonna go on some kind of suicide mission. Clark, you might be stronger than steel, but you're not invincible. I know, dad. But I'm the only one who can do this. All right. But I want you to listen to me right now. All the years that your mother and I... spent raising you from that... wide-eyed tattler running around on this farm... to the man who is standing in front of me right now... was for this moment. You do this, son. You make us proud. Those meteors can kill him, Jonathan. I know that, sweetheart. But we have faith in our son, then we can't let that faith waver now. Lana, I thought you already evacuated. Are you okay? I'm scared. Lana, I know this meteor shower... must bring up some painful memories for you... but this time is different. We have warning and we'll be safe. No, I'm not so sure. Clark, I don't know what's going to happen to me. I want you to have this. Where did you get this? In China. Whatever it is, whatever it means, I... I somehow know that it's meant for you. Is this blood? Remembers all those times that I asked you... for an explanation, but you said you couldn't me one. That I had to trust you? Well, this time I need you to trust me. Lana, my parents are about to leave right now. Go with them. You'll be safe. I can't. You have to. Clark, I need you to know... that whatever happens, I will never forget you. Lana, you're talking like we never gonna see... each other again. I love you. I love you, too. Good-bye. Chloe, even though you won't hear from me for a while, I want you to know that I'm okay. I thought we'd agreed you wouldn't talk to anyone. I have to let my friends know that I'm all right. Lana, I understand you not want anyone to worry, but you have to trust me. Now, I assume the stone is still safe. As safe as can be. Well, let's keep it this way. I'll put it in my vault. Why? A chopper is being fueled to evacuate you to Metropolis, where you'll stay at a hotel until your lawyer arrives. It's probably best not to travel with the murder weapon. I understand that, Lex, but I'd rather hold on to it. Lana, that object is what prosecutors fondly refer to... as the smoking gun. Now, I'll do anything I can to protect you... including supporting whatever... story of self-defense you want to run with. It's not a story, Lex. I would never murder somebody. Of course not. Lana, I trust you. Now you have to trust me with that stone. Sorry, Lex, but I can't do that. Jason? Jason! Shelby, no. I'm having what you could call a rough day. Why don't you just calm down, son? Where is Clark? He's not here. Look, why don't you put down the shotgun, and we'll talk about it? Tell me where he is! Why would Lana be at the Lex's mansion... when she's suppose to evacuate? I don't know, but it could swear... that was Lex's voice in the background. She sounds like she's in trouble, Lois. I can't abandon her, I mean, the mansion is just around that bend. Unless you have a jet pack in your purse... we're not going anywhere. Emergency vehicles only. Turn the car around immediately. Well, our friend could be trapped inside. We just gonna go grab her and then come right back. I'm sorry, mam. Nobody gets trough. We're way too close to turn away. Hey, soldier! Is this a road block or... a lemonade stand you got here? Wait a second, I recognize you. You're the... Daughter of General Lane. You might have heard of him. He talks really loud, smokes a stogy. Hey! Hey, this barricade... it should be perpendicular to the road. Those channelizers should be further apart... and, unless I need glasses, there should be reflectors on those cones. Yes, mam, I understand, but I can't let you trough. You're a cub scout out here soldier. Where's your den mother? Baking brownies? What happened to your survival instincts, dad? Fire and brimstone are about to rain down... from the sky and you're sipping a cocktail... like it's Sunday at the country club. I am aware of the imminent danger, Lex, but I'm not about to leave... without knowing that my son is all right... Come on, who's kidding who? You're not about to leave without the element. I hate to disappoint you, but I haven't even seen Lana Lang. She's probably on the run... halfway to Costa Rica by now. Oh, a face like Lana Lang's isn't easy to hide. It's just a matter of time before... she catches the attention of some customs official. All right. Agree to leave her alone, and I'll give you something you desperately need. I am a blessed man, Lex, I need very little in life. I wonder, what good is a key if you don't know where the lock is? Wise observation, why do you think any of this applies to me? You have one of the elements, dad. That much is clear. What you don't have is the knowledge of where it belongs. I can help you, take you there right now. I wish I'd were true, Lex, but I don't have the stone. Mr. Luthor, what happened? Get J.D and take my father upstairs. Mr. Luthor we're evacuating... Do it! Can you hear me, dad? Before you leave this earth, I want you to know... You did create the son you always wanted. Come on, hurry up! Jason, why don't you let Martha go? She doesn't know anything about any of this. Oh, a mother always knows her sons deep, dark secrets. Now, where does he keeps the stones? Why would Clark know anything... about ancient stones? All right. Let's see, when I ran into your son in Shanghai, I decided to do a little homework on my own. And the more I dogged the more Clark Kent's name... just got popping up. Sit down! Was it coincidence... that the symbols were burned into your field? I don't know what you're talking. Jason! What about Clark's connection with Bridgette Crosby? I don't know. I don't know. She had one of the artifacts! I suppose that was just a coincidence, too. None of that makes any difference now. You know, when my mother came to Smallville... she thought the Luthors would lead her to the stones... But she was wrong. It was a farm boy. The one who has no record of ever been born. He's more connected to those stones than any of us. There is a meteor shower about to tear this town apart! You need to get to your mother, get her to safety! Don't you think I know that? I can't find her anywhere! But I'll tell you one thing. When I do find my mother, I finally be able to give her the one thing... she's been searching for all these years. Now tell me where the stones are! I'll meet you in Metropolis. What? You're not coming? I have a pressing matter to take care of. Now, Lana, for your own safety: I need that stone. Look, we all have a need to cling on to things, but eventually... you have to loosen your grip. It's too dangerous to you. I don't have it! Lies don't become you. It's the truth, Lex. I don't have it. Trust me it's safe, I promise! Where is it? That was never about my safety, was it? This is about you getting your hands on that stone! Lana... your safety is more important than any of this. You mean a lot more to me than you know. We can't wait any longer, Mr. Luthor. We got to go! Lana? Lana? Oh my God, Clark. Lex, I was looking for Lana. She's already left. What happened? I don't know, I just walked in. You know more than you're telling me, Chloe. Who did this? Lex, honestly, I just came to find Lana. Your curiosity seems to always have a way... of landing you in precarious conditions. Only this time you are on a very narrow ledge... with only one-way back! Now, who took the element? Lex, I swear it, I don't know what you're talking about. But I think we need to get out of Smallville... before the meteor shower hits. We'll find that stone, Chloe, even if that means dodging a few meteors in the process. You're coming with me. I don't... Let's go! Lex, I don't know what you're talking about. I swear to God, if you don't start talking I'm gonna blow her brains out. Sweetheart, it's no good. Go ahead, tell him what he wants to know. Tell him where the stones are. Tell me what I want to know. Go upstairs to Clark's room. Oh my God. You're not my daddy. Come here, come here. Daddy! Go! Go! Thank you. Thank you! Why do I get the feeling we're not in this cave for cover? You know as well as do. It's the epicenter. Of what? Come on, Chloe! You're the town purvey of all things unexplained! You know damn well about this cave and the stones. Lex, what's wrong with you? If you didn't break into my library, you know who did? Who are you trying to protect? No one. Is it Clark? Clark? Of course not. What does Clark have to do with any of this? You tell me. You know Clark a lot longer than I have. In fact, you might know him better than anyone. You are right, Lex, I do. And the Clark Kent I know... would be the last person to go super thief... on your library for some stupid piece of rock. What is that? Lex, be careful. It might be dangerous. To be continued...
