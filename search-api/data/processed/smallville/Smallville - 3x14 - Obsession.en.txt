Now, you're all here to learn something about business. The most important element in anything to do with economic theory... ...is the individual. Yes... ...you. Traditional rules, supply and demand, they're secondary... ...but to rise above those rules, to know when to break them... ...requires absolute personal commitment. I consider it a prerequisite for success. And I consider it despicable, immoral and possibly illegal. I'm sorry. Do you have a question? No? Anybody else? No? All right, then, I'll hand you back over to Mr. Simms. All right, group, follow me. -lt was a pleasure meeting you. -Thank you. Miss Sullivan, Mr. Kent. Well, it's nice to see you both looking to the future. Want to make a break for the fire escape? I'd crawl down all 39 stories if this field trip didn't count toward our final grade. Welcome to the Lionel Luthor eXhibit. Next floor: victims, sycophants and hatchet men. How about I split up this jaded little fan club? Mr. Kent, take the neXt car. Elevators. Too much demand, not enough supply. Oh, my God. What did you just do? Please, don't tell anyone about this. Hello! Hello! Is anybody in there? This is LuthorCorp security. Remain calm. If anybody's in there, we're working to get you out! Hang on! What did you just do? You didn't want to get caught, and I wanted to help, so.... Clark, now you know my secret too. You can't tell anybody. -Please. -Are you two all right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're okay. The elevator crashed just as we got out of the doors. -Sounded like the cable broke. -How? I don't know, Chloe. -Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you. Alicia, hold on! I didn't get a chance to thank you yesterday. Oh, it was my pleasure. It was actually kind of a relief to be able to share my ability with someone. Is that what it takes to be friends with you? I guess I deserved that. I'm not really as stuck-up as everyone thinks. What, you think I don't know what people say about me? It doesn't bother you, huh? I'm always so afraid that if I get too close to people... ...they'll find out about me, realize that I'm a freak. I just figure it's better to be alone, even if people think I'm a snob. You don't mind if I ask.... Have you always been able to...? No. It was the meteor shower. One minute I was swinging on the swing set, next I'm in the middle of a corn field. Do you know how it happened? Sort of. I mean, once I was old enough to realize I was different... ...I did some research and-- Thank you. I don't know. There's a complicated explanation about quantum physics. -You'd probably be bored. -No. Try me. Basically, the meteor shower affected my body... ...and allowed me to teleport myself. And anything you touch. And anything I touch I want to take with me. Yes. What about you? Was it meteor eXposure too? Everything's pretty much connected to the meteor shower. Right? Right. I just can't believe you're like me. I mean, not eXactly like me, but just... ...Iike me. You know? Yeah. I do. Bye. Adam? Lana. What are you doing? -Adam, what is this? -It's private. Give it back to me. No. "January 1 1 th. Lana evasive about her relationship with Clark. January 1 7th. Clark is at the scene of another accident." You've been spying on me, and you've been spying on Clark. Look who's talking. No, you threatened me, and now I find out you've been keeping tabs on me? I want you to leave. Guess you haven't checked tenant laws. It's not that easy to evict someone. I'm not going anywhere. Alicia. Hey. I've been looking all over for you. Yeah, you figured teleporting girl, physics lab. It makes sense. That's a pretty good deduction. But I should warn you, Clark, I'm not always that easy to pin down. So I've seen. But since I've been this lucky... ...I was just wondering if you'd like... ...to get together, you know, for the econ test. Are you asking me out on a date? A date? No. Not that I wouldn't, but.... Clark... ...would you like to go out on a date with me? Did you just win the lotto? What? No, it's just-- I haven't seen you smile like that in a long time. Look, l-- I don't want to spoil your mood... ...but I wanted to tell you something about Adam. What is it? He's been keeping a journal about me. And you. And I don't know if it's because he's jealous or he's obsessed with us... ...or if.... If it's more about you. -Well, I'll go talk to him. -Clark, no, I'm gonna have him evicted. I don't think he'll bother either of us anymore. I just... ...wanted to give you a heads up. See you at 7? Hey, Lana. We're in the same econ class. According to the Greeks... ...Orion the Hunter is greater in strength and stature than any other mortal. I thought I was the only one who knew astronomy. I'm a science geek. You don't look like one. Thanks. So I spent the whole movie wondering what else you can do... ...other than punch through steel. What do you mean? Come on, Clark. I know you managed to fry that security camera. I just.... I can't figure out eXactly how. With my eyes. They give off heat. That's incredible. Have you ever shown Lana what you can do? No. It's actually one of our issues. I didn't feel I could be completely honest with her. Like you are with me? So how about you? Any boyfriends or...? There was this boy, and I really liked him... ...but then he found out what I can do, and he totally freaked. What he thought... ...doesn't matter. Looks like someone stayed up. I hope they didn't worry. Yeah, my parents are a little... ...overprotective. Really? Yeah, they don't really understand everything about my abilities. For a while, they tried to keep me from doing it. How? I don't really want to talk about it. Okay. What about your parents? My parents are great. They worry about me, that someone might find out, but they don't try to change me. Well, maybe that's why you're so special. Clark... ...I just want you to know... ...that I had a really good time tonight. Me too. Yeah. Okay. I guess.... -I'll see you later. -Okay. Okay. Alicia. Sorry. I didn't want to scare you. I just... -...wanted to surprise you. -What are you doing here? When you dropped me off, I could tell that you didn't want the night to end... ...and neither did l, so.... Alicia, l.... I know you wanted to kiss me, Clark. -Alicia.... -Just kiss me. Hey, what'd you do, fall out of--? Dad. I don't know, Martha, it's what we've always discussed. We have rules... ...boundaries, limitations. Clark knows that. I don't understand-- Jonathan. She's gone. What did she do, Clark, climb out the window? Actually, she teleported out. You're gonna have to run that by me one more time. Alicia was infected by the meteor shower. She can transport herself wherever she wants. Including boys' bedrooms. Look, Alicia saved me. We were trapped in the LuthorCorp elevator, and the cable broke... ...and I had to stop it. So Alicia saw you use your powers? Yes. How much does she know about you, Clark? She knows about the strength... ...and the heat vision. I suppose the next thing you'll tell us is she knows you get sick around meteor rocks. No, I didn't tell her that. She didn't have to help me. She was willing to expose her own secret to protect mine... ...and I think that's why I feel such a connection to her. Look, you guys don't get this. We're a lot alike. You really like this girl, don't you, honey? Maybe I do. I think I found someone I could actually have a relationship with. Clark, I know we've had our differences lately. -But I can't believe you didn't tell me. -Tell you what? That your dad caught you and Alicia in your bedroom, that's what. The only people who knew about that were me, my parents and Alicia. Well, I guess she's not as secretive as you are. Anyway, man, that girl is on fire. Congratulations. Later, stud. Yeah. Good morning, gorgeous. Alicia. Look, we need to talk. What's wrong? Well, last night in my room, and these pictures.... Don't you like them? No, I do. It's just.... I just think we're moving a little too fast. You said you had a great time last night. You kissed me. No.... I did, and I did. I just think that maybe we need to set some boundaries... ...you know, maybe some limitations. We're special, Clark. People like us don't have boundaries and limitations. I'll see you later, sweetie. Yeah. I'll be thinking about you. You go on one date with this girl... ...and already she's sneaking into your bedroom... ...putting sexy pictures of herself in your locker... ...practically asking her parents to book the wedding chapel. What's your secret, Clark? This isn't funny, LeX. We barely know each other. She's already acting like we're soul mates. Look, in my experience, a person doesn't develop this kind of fixation... ...unless she's been led to think the relationship is more than just casual. You're saying I led her on. I'm saying I've been there. She's smart, she's pretty, and you want her to like you... ...so you tell her things she wants to hear. I'm curious. What exactly did you do to make her feel this way? You're making my point for me. So, what do I do now? You must be Clark. Come in, come in. Alicia's not here right now. Honey. Look who's here. It's Clark. Clark. She's-- She's told us so much about you... ...and, well, we're just thrilled that's she's dating such a nice young man. Actually, that's why I'm here. I think she has the wrong idea about us. No, I'm pretty sure that you're mistaken. -She said you're her boyfriend. -That's the thing. I'm-- No, if she says you're dating... ...well, just go along with it. Alicia's a special girl. I know about Alicia. Her ability.... She said you tried to stop her from using it. How? We kept her in a special room. But she begged us to let her out. She promised she wouldn't abuse her power. Now we never know where she is or what she'll do. Please, Clark, just try to go along with her. If you see Alicia, please tell her I'm looking for her. Clark. There was another boy that Alicia liked a lot. It didn't end well. Be careful. Alicia. You shouldn't have said that, Daddy. I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I didn't know where else to turn. It's all right, Lana. I trust your instincts. Look, if you're nervous about Adam, I'm sure it's with good reason. Is there anything concrete you can tell me? No, not really. Just the journal that I told you about and his attitude. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I checked the laws... ...and it can take up to six months to get him out... ...and I'm not willing to wait that long. Believe me, there are definitely ways of getting rid of someone... ...a lot faster than that. -Hey. -Alicia. What's going on? I got your message. My parents said you wanted to see me. So here I am. Well, that wasn't an invitation to redecorate or to go through my stuff. I thought you'd like what I did to the loft. It's-- It's more us now. What's this all about? Clark, it's time to move on. I know you used to go out with Lana, but now you're with me. There's no us. Of course there is. We're special. We're made for each other. You didn't tell Lana your secret. You told me. You and I are meant to be together. Hello. Yes. It's my father. He's at the hospital. He fell down the stairs. Miss Baker... ...may I have a word? What is it? Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your father? I thought it was an accident. There was a suspicious-looking blunt trauma... ...to the back of Mr. Baker's head. It's possible there was an assailant. Possible? The basement was locked from the inside. I'm sorry. It's fine. Alicia, listen to me. I need to know. Did you have anything to do with this? How could you think that? Who else could escape from a locked basement? I did it for us. He was trying to keep us apart. You need to talk to the sheriff. No. Clark. Hi. I stopped by to see you, and your mom asked me to stay for dinner. What are you doing here? I'm just getting to know your family. You need to turn yourself in. You're my boyfriend. You're supposed to be protecting me. Like I protected you. As long as you do that, your secret's safe. -And so are the people you care about. -ls that a threat? Tell your mom I'm sorry I couldn't stay. I'm really sorry she went all Glenn Close on you. I should've told you about Alicia's ability before, but she asked me to keep it secret. Yeah, and I respect you for keeping her confidence... ...but once she went psycho, all bets are off. So how do you look for someone who can disappear in the blink of an eye? Well... ...we know that Alicia has at least one weakness. You. She may have one more. Chloe, I have an idea. I'm gonna need your help. Mrs. Baker? I'm Chloe Sullivan. I need to speak with Alicia, please. -It's urgent. -What's wrong? It's her boyfriend, Clark. He's in trouble. What do you mean? What is it? Sheriff Adams suspects he may have had something to do with your father's accident. -Alicia-- -Mother. Why would the sheriff suspect Clark? She has this theory that Clark was angry with your father... ...for not allowing you guys to be together. Is he under arrest? No, he's in hiding. He asked me to find you and tell you he needs help. I don't understand why... ...but he said you were his only chance. Where is he now? Clark? Clark? Alicia? Clark, are you okay? They're after me. The sheriff thinks I tried to kill your father. I know. -You have to tell them the truth. -No, I can't do that. Alicia.... -We'll disappear. -What? We'll go somewhere where no one will find us. Yeah. I guess that's the only way. Come on. Quick, someone's coming. Come on. Lead paint? Are you trying to trap me... ...Iike my parents did, in that little room? Alicia, what you did to your father was wrong. You're just trying to get me out of the way so you can be with Lana. Alicia, you need help. Don't you understand? I'm the one that's right for you. No, I'm sorry. The police are already on their way. Just because I can't teleport out of this room... ...doesn't mean that I can't walk out. I overheard you talking to your parents. I hoped that I wouldn't have to use it, but you broke the rules first. Please. Alicia, don't do this. Come here. Once Lana's out of the way... ...you'll realize we were meant to be together. We can still be great together, Clark. We're soul mates, and nothing can stop that. What is it about you, Lana? EXcuse me? What is it that Clark Kent is so in love with? I mean, what have you got that I haven't got? I have no idea what you're talking about. I think you do. Tell me, Lana. What's your secret? You're not prettier than I am. And you're definitely not smarter. And you certainly don't have my abilities. Alicia, there is nothing going on between me and Clark. Oh, yes, there is... ...because Clark is still in love with you. But now it's my turn. He told me the truth about himself. The things that he wouldn't tell you. And now you'll never know. Alicia! Lana. Lana. Clark. Why, Clark? Why? -Hey. -Hi. -Can I come in? -Yeah, come on in. I just wanted to thank you. You know, I think I should apologize. -lf I never got involved with Alicia-- -Alicia said that you.... You told her the truth about yourself. Stuff you never told me. What did she mean by that? You know, Alicia said a lot of crazy things. She also said that you were still in love with me. But that was crazy too, right? Right. Lana, hi. Would you like to stay for dinner? Thanks, Mrs. Kent, but.... But I can't. -Well, bye. -Bye. Clark, honey, someday, you'll find the person who's right for you. For a while, I thought that person was Lana, but I could never be honest with her. And then I thought it was Alicia because she was like me-- Sweetheart, there's nobody like you. You're.... Maybe that means I'll always be alone. Hello? Adam? Lana. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. They told me you were up here. Lex, thank you. I feel like this huge burden's been lifted. What do you mean? Well, Adam's gone. I really appreciate your help. Lana, as much as I'd like to take credit for getting him out of your life... ...I can't. My security people haven't been able to track him down. Well, if you didn't get rid of him, then where is he? Adam. Hello? Why did I send you to Smallville? To become the best friend of Lana Lang. To find out everything she knew about Clark Kent. Wasn't that it? Instead, you have alienated her completely. Mr. Luthor, his medication is ready. That won't be necessary, Dr. Teng. -He needs the serum, or he'll die. -I'm sorry. I've already made my decision. This patient is no longer a participant in our research program. Help me. Please. Help me. No! No. No! Help me! Help me! --------------------------------------------- -**- English Subtitles by jondon -**- Smallville Taiwan Fans Site
