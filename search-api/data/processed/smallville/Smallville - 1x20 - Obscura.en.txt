Something to keep your mind off of... It's okay, you can say it, I'm not gonna break. Sorry, I've just been kind of out of it lately. I'm here if you need to talk. There's one thing I wanted to ask you. Would you be my date to the spring formal? Of course. You didn't have to ask. I guess I'm not taking anything for granted anymore. This is Watts and Vertigo, we have a gas fire just off Route Twelve, mile marker 18. Whitney, look! - Hey! - Hey! - Lana, get out of here. Run! - Whitney, don't! Don't! Look at the pipe! Everybody, clear on out! Lana, get out of here! Go, run! - Lana! - Get down! Lana? Lana! Hey, I just heard, is she all right? Yeah. They gave her something to help her rest. How you holding up? Kind of hoped I'd seen my last hospital room in a while. Hey. Hey! - I thought you'd be halfway to Metropolis. - It's just an internship, I can reschedule. You've been waiting for that interview for weeks. I know, I just feel weird taking off right now. Lana's gonna be okay. It's just a mild concussion. I'm crashing in my cousin's dorm. Call me if anything goes wrong with the Torch. We can survive one day without you. You gonna wish me luck? You don't need it. - All right. Bye. - Bye. Can I buy you a coffee? Yeah. Chloe! Obscura Okay, well, I'll let you know. Bye. - Who was that, the plumber? - No, your school. Don't worry. You're not in trouble. They're looking for chaperones for the spring formal. - Oh, what'd you say? - I said you hadn't even mentioned it. I don't think the whole tux-and-limo thing is for me. - Besides, it's customary to have a date. - It's customary to ask someone. Martha, stay out of it. Son, can you get that trap out of there for me? Uh, sure, Dad. Thank you. So, are you planning on asking Chloe or not? She just can't help herself. Don't use the sink until I get back. - I'm not sure. - Well, you said you had feelings for her. It's not about Chloe. You can't keep putting your life on hold because of Lana. But if she sees me with someone else, it's like I'm saying the door's closed. The door is closed, Clark. You need to admit that to yourself. Hi, Lex, come on in. Sorry to barge in. I came by to see you and Mr. Kent. Oh, I'll go get him. - In a hurry? - Yeah. I'm taking over at the Torch while Chloe's out of town. Catch up with you later. - Hi, Lex. - Hey. What can I do for you? The paperwork on the chemical spill finally came through. I never thought I'd see the day. Since the dumping wasn't done by an actual LuthorCorp employee... ...it did require jumping through some corporate hoops. The accident was unfortunate. I know your... ...loss can't be fixed entirely with money, but... ...I hope this helps. Well, I... ...appreciate the gesture, but... Hope we're not getting special treatment because of your friendship with Clark. I assure you, Mr. Kent, that has nothing to do with this. - This is very generous, Lex. - Actually, it isn't. It reflects the exact value of the herd and grazing land you lost. I wouldn't insult you by putting you in my debt. All I want is to leave the doubt between us in the past. Hey. How you feeling? Better. Now it only hurts when I walk, sit, or breathe. Surprised to see you. Usually a hospital visit comes with a "get out of jail" card. Actually, I was looking for Chloe. Not here. She's in Metropolis until tonight. - You covering? - Well, if you can call it that. The printer's jammed, the scanner's broken... ...and the spring formal schedule is late. Chloe leaves for a day and the Torch goes down in flames. Safe to say we won't lose you to the entrancing world of journalism. So have you talked to Chloe? I left a message on her cell phone. She's busy convincing the Planet they were insane ever to publish without her. What's up? I had this intense dream about Chloe I just can't shake. It was totally surreal, but I dreamed she was attacked outside of the hospital. I know. It sounds crazy. It's got you freaked. It's just, it felt like I was right there. She was walking to her car and getting her keys from her red bag with the butterflies. What is it? She was carrying that red bag when she left the hospital. Do you want me to call her dad to see if she's all right? You know, I'm sure it's just the concussion. Don't want to scare him because I was on painkillers. Yeah, it was probably a nightmare. I'll see you later. Lex? Since I didn't call you, and I haven't heard of any three-headed sheep in Smallville... ...what brings the Inquisitor here? - We need to talk. I seriously doubt that. Seems you've given out gifts to the competition. Now, we had an arrangement. You give me stories, I give you information. Now, what did Carrie Castle do for you that I couldn't? She gave me a pretty mean shiatsu massage. Well, mock all you want, Lex. It just means I've had to take the initiative, develop my own leads. There's a story here in Smallville, and I am going to make my name on it. I thought my position was clear. I don't want you near the Kents. They're off-limits, they're under my protection. And what about the meteors? - Are they under your protection? - Do you have something? I found a man who had a very interesting view of the meteor shower. Claims he saw something fall out of the sky. We all did. Yeah, well, not like this. If you're feeling so abused, why are you bringing this to me? Getting the full story takes money and access, and unlike some... ...I always hold up my end of the deal. Get ready to thank me. Hey, hey, Clark. Take it easy, would you? - Thing's been in our family a long time. - Stupid thing won't start! Clark. - What's going on, son? - I'm worried. I'm sure Chloe's going to call and you'll realize you've been worried about nothing. Yeah. I'm glad we'll finally be rid of this. We spend more time fixing it than riding it. Well, I'm not sure that I'm quite ready to retire the old girl yet. Well, with Lex's check we can get a new one. Actually, I haven't decided to deposit that check. Dad, Lex is trying to do the right thing. I know he is, Clark. I know he didn't... ...try to buy me off. He's just trying to repay for damages. You're right, I've got no real... ...reason to doubt him, it's just, something in my gut tells me I should. Lex isn't perfect, Dad, I know that. But slamming the door in his face over and over... ...only helps turn him into exactly what you think he already is. When did you get to be so wise? Ask my dad. I'll sleep on it. Hey, Clark. - Talked to Chloe yet? - No... ...but the Planet better not have turned her down. Just thought she would have called by now. She probably already got the internship and is out partying with her cousin. So, did I mention... ...I'm taking Erica Fox to the formal? - Several times, yes. The hottest girl in our class. Just want to make sure that was clear. - It is. - So, want to know my secret? You do. I asked her. You ought to try it. Getting up off your butt. It's the wave of the future. I've gotta go reserve my limo for the spring formal. To which, incidentally, I'm taking Erica Fox! I hadn't heard. Any word on our intrepid reporter? I called her dad. He was stuck in a seminar. - I'm sure she'll be okay. - Yeah, me too. You can buy tickets to the formal here. - That's a cool idea. - You ask anyone yet? I've got my eye on someone. Well, you'd better hurry up. No one likes to look for a dress last minute. Not even Chloe. What makes you think I'm asking Chloe? Lana. - It happened again. - You saw something. I saw Chloe. Somebody's got her. You have to believe me, Clark. Come on, Chloe, come on. You've been through worse than this. Come on, Chloe. Okay, maybe you're lying. Home sweet home. Hey, guys. I called the sheriff's office because I wanted them to hear this too. Any luck reaching Chloe, Mr. Sullivan? No, I haven't heard from her. I'm starting to get concerned. I called her cousin, but I get the machine. You said you had proof Chloe might've been abducted? Well, I sort of had a vision. A vision. She saw Chloe being kidnapped. Maybe you should have called the Psychic Friends Network instead then. What makes you think it was real? I saw Chloe bound and blindfolded in a dark room. Well, too bad you didn't see something a little more useful, like an address... ...where we might find her. - Excuse me. - Ms. Lang... ...you went through a rough ordeal yesterday. Are you sure you're feeling okay? You mean, do I think I'm hallucinating? I felt like I was there, like I was seeing through the kidnapper's eyes. - We'll take this seriously, and look into it. - Thanks. Mr. Sullivan? What is it? They found Chloe's car. It's been abandoned in the woods. So far, I'm unimpressed. Reserve judgment for five minutes. - Starting now. - Mr. Cole, this is... Lex Luthor. I know who he is. He's very interested in your story. 12 years ago, Eddie had more clients than he could handle. Spent eight hours a day dusting fields all over Smallville. And then? FAA pulled my license. And why would they do that? Decided I wasn't fit in the head to fly anymore. Because I couldn't keep my dumb mouth shut. What were your rates for crop dusting, Mr. Cole? 600 a day. I'd very much like to hear your story. I was up in my prop, dusting the Bakers' field. Fifty acres of sweet corn. When it happened. The meteors? It was like lightning, all around. Pretty sure I was going to die right there. Then one... ...just missed my tail by about 10 feet. I saw it go straight down, and then swerve just before it hit. Doesn't sound like a meteor. I know aircraft better than most. The way that thing moved, it had to be a ship. You saw a ship crash? Well, it's not just that I saw a ship crash. Couple hours later, went to look for it. It was gone. Maybe it burned. Or maybe it was taken. Nobody believes me. Gave Mr. Nixon a map of the crash site. I've seen it. So you believe me? It's a good story. Thanks for your time, Mr. Cole. Hey! Thought you'd be pleased. I brought the story you've been waiting for. You brought me a desperate man and a tall tale. It's about what I expected from you. Sorry, Rog, time's up. Any word on Chloe? My dad and I went out with Mr. Sullivan and the police. We searched the woods but we didn't find anything. They've organized a search party, tomorrow morning. How you doing? Spent the afternoon at the sheriff's station telling them what I saw. Kept looking at me like I was crazy. I don't think you're crazy. How are you holding up? I keep wishing Chloe would just walk up those steps. I never appreciated how much she meant to me until now. - The thought of never seeing her again... - Clark. You can't think that way. You know, I remember the first time I met her. It was eighth grade. She'd just transferred from Metropolis and I was assigned to show her around. She wanted to know where she could buy a copy of the Planet... ...so she could keep in touch with civilization. When she found out I lived on a farm, she insisted I invite her over to experience it. I think she thought I was Amish. When I brought her up here... ...she just kissed me, right out of the blue. Why'd she do that? She said, "I know you've been thinking about that... ...so I figured we'd get it out of the way and be friends." It was my first kiss. It's nice it was with someone you still care about. We're going to see her again, Clark. Lana? - I just saw her again. - Chloe? Where? - Buried. She's still alive. - Did you see where she was? I'm not sure, but there was a windmill. A big one. She must be out in Chandler's Field. I'll get help! Chloe? Chloe! - Chloe, it's okay! It's okay. - Clark! Clark. I knew it was you, it's always you. Thanks, I appreciate that. I gotta go. Some real people just came in. - Who was that? - The Daily Planet. Thought you missed your appointment for the internship. I did. They were calling about an interview. Are you gonna do it? No. I've wanted my name in the Daily Planet, but not like this. Besides, I figured the Torch could use an exclusive, which... ...I will write as soon as I get out of here. Chloe, do you remember anything? I remember... ...tripping on some metal rails... ...and I remember... ...hundreds of teddy bears hanging from the ceiling. Anyway, that's where I was kept until l... I'm sorry, you guys. Flashback. I can still hear the dirt falling on the coffin. Sorry. If you hadn't found me, I don't know where I'd be. Don't thank me, thank Lana. Yeah, I gotta hand it to you... ...you sure picked a perfect time to take a walk on the weird side. You should get some rest. Clark. Would you mind sticking around for a while? Whoever did this is still out there. Of course not. I'll stay here as long as you need. Thanks. Okay, well, I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye, Lana. - Okay. - Bye. Glad you could join me. - How late were you at the hospital? - All night. I snuck in after visiting hours. I'm sure Chloe appreciated that. I'm worried that the person who did this is out there. Clark, you got her back safe and sound. That's what's important. Without Lana I wouldn't have. Hey, she hasn't had any more visions, has she? No. I think they're connected to the gas pipe explosion. That's when they started. - I'm gonna check that out. - No, son, let the police do it. It's their job. - Wish I knew who she was seeing through. - What you need to focus on right now... ...is getting this truckload of feed over to the Millers. So you've had a night to sleep on it, what are you going to do with Lex's check? I might be stubborn, but I'm not blind. Yeah, I had a talk with your mom. As soon as we deliver the feed... ...I'm taking it to the savings and loan. - Keep them moving. - All right. What's up, Lex? Considering buying this land for a project, but I wanted to test the soil first. Standard operating procedure. Since when does that procedure include metal detectors and HAZMAT suits? To be honest, there may have been a major meteor strike on the site. There's no proof the meteors were harmful, but... It never hurts to dot your I's and cross your T's, right? LuthorCorp's environmental record has taken some serious hits in recent weeks. Better safe than sorry. Is there a problem? Dad? The problem is, Lex, that... ...what's good for LuthorCorp isn't always what's good for this town. Mr. Luthor. Looks like you've got business to attend to. I've decided I can't accept your money. Mr. Kent, I don't understand. I wouldn't expect you would. - Lex, l... - It's okay, Clark. I'll talk to you later. Dad. Dad! Lex didn't deserve that. People test the land all the time. I know that, Clark. But this field is where your ship crashed down. If Lex's scientists find anything out here, they could trace it back to you. Keep swinging the detector through until we get a reading. Come on. Lex, you gotta see this. You understand what this could mean. More than you know. I want you to handle all the tests personally, then report directly to me. - How you feeling? - Better. At least the nightmares seem to have stopped. I'm glad you came by. Went home early. Started going through some of my dad's things. - Sure you're ready for that? - It's okay. It actually brought back some nice memories. And I found this. These were your father's? Yeah. I knew he served in Vietnam, but he never talked about it. Know what they're for? Yeah. They keep a registry on the Internet. Silver star's for exceptional valour. He rescued three men in his unit during a firefight. He was wounded, but he wouldn't leave his men behind. Sounds like your dad. Wonder why he never told you. Maybe he just did. You know... ...you win a couple football games and people start calling you a hero. It feels good, but... ...maybe he's trying to tell me throwing a ball isn't the only thing important in life. Glad to see I'm not the only one who's curious in Smallville. Hey, Lex. What are you doing here? I feel like I owe your father an apology, but I'm not exactly sure why. It's not you. It's everything. Money problems, the farm. He didn't understand what you were doing in that field. I thought I made myself clear. You did. You don't believe me either. I know you get obsessed about things, like the car accident. I find it hard to believe you'd waste time supervising a land survey... ...if that's what it was. My life changed when the meteors hit, I need to know why. You can't let it go? This isn't some empty emotional quest. It's about finding the truth. The truth. I found a man. He said something besides the meteors came down that day. Like what? A ship. And you believe him. I listened. Chances are he's another crackpot, but I'd be remiss if I didn't check it out. And when the next story crops up, you'll check that one too. When are you going to put your past behind you? You look at the stars, Clark. Some of them have been extinguished for thousands of years... ...but their light is only reaching us now. Past is always influencing the present. I can't change that. All I can do is try to understand it. Chloe, why aren't you at home sleeping? If I fall asleep, I'll have nightmares, so I figure the best thing is keep busy. God knows you left a mess for me to clean up. Well, I'm glad you're here. Hey, Whitney. You sure you're in the right place? Clark called, said he needed my help. I figured out how Lana got her visions. The explosion. You think the blast caused them? More than that. It connected her with someone. Clark Kent leaps tall theories in a single bound. How did you arrive at this one? Apparently there were meteor rocks at the explosion... ...and I found this article. The De Kretser Syndrome? It's like a post-traumatic stress disorder. There were cases reported during the London blitz. People in shelters would find themselves psychically linked after a bomb hit nearby. I'm sold. According to this, it's in times of stress, anger, or excitement that triggers visions. Who was around Lana after the explosion? Myself and two deputies. Watts and Vertigo. They were with your dad when we told them about Lana's vision. He probably called them himself. They're in a bowling league together. Whitney, which one got to her first? It's tough to say, it all happened so fast. One of these cops kidnapped Chloe? Who would suspect a cop? We have to warn Lana. If one is the kidnapper, he knows Lana's seeing through his eyes. - Great, I'll drive. - That's okay. We'll take my car. Miss Lang. I know it's late, but I just wanted to ask you a few more questions. Surprised you found the time. I know I deserve that. Do you want a cup of coffee? Sure. Okay. - Where is Lana? - I don't know, she was here. The guy must have grabbed her. I'm gonna check the back. - Deputy, where's your partner tonight? - Gary? He's working a second job at the carnival. He's a security guard. You saw stuffed animals and train tracks. The carnival's closed this time of year. It's perfect to hide someone. Hello? Hello? Help! Somebody please help me! No one can hear you. - How did you see through my eyes? - I don't know. Deputy Watts. Why are you doing this? I never wanted to hurt Chloe. I didn't even want money. I wanted to rescue her. You kidnapped Chloe so you could take credit for finding her? I could have been good! The best cop this town's ever seen! This case would've made my career! But it doesn't matter now. I can still be the hero. What are you going to do? Solve your murder. No, please, please don't do this. Lana. - Lana, you all right? - Clark, it's Watts, Deputy Watts. Okay, stay here. It's over, Watts. What the hell are you? Lana! Gary, drop the gun! Your mom told me you'd be out here. I haven't seen that smile in a week. What's up? Well, I've got good news. The Daily Planet called, and I got an internship. - That's great! - Yeah! - You didn't even interview. - I know. Well... ...they read my article in the Ledger on the cop, and I guess my work spoke for itself. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So I guess you'll spend the summer in Metropolis. Yeah. - Will you come visit me? - Yeah, of course! I would never pass up an opportunity to see you in your natural habitat. Well, I just wanted you to be the first to know, so I'll see you. Bye. Chloe. I was... Do you have plans for the spring formal? Not at the moment. I was hoping... I was hoping you'd go with me. As my date. I would love to, Clark. Now I'm gonna go before my good karma runs out. Chloe... ...I'm sorry I didn't ask you sooner. It's okay. It was worth the wait. Lex, where's that crop-duster of yours? I wanted to talk to him. - He seems to have disappeared. - Maybe your visit scared him. Something or someone did. - What do you have for me? - Preliminary results... ...of the fragment we recovered. So, what is it? Well, all I can tell you... ...is what it is not. I don't like riddles, doctor. Then this object will make you profoundly unhappy. To be honest, Lex... ...there is nothing... ...like this alloy... ...on this Earth. Subtitles by SDI Media Group
