Isabelle? They've taken the book, and with it our powers. What would you have me do? - Anything, we're running out of time! - Time is the one thing we do have. If we fall this night, I promise you... We will rise again to finish our quest. Magistrate Wilkins... Come to enjoy your handywork? Give me the 3 stones of power, countess. You may yet escape the pyre's flames. My book. There's a page marked. What means this? It means that the stones of power shall be mine. And once I possess them, you shall tremble at my feet. And never again persecute my kind. [Latin] Demon. Join your confederates. Please. Have mercy. No, please... Have Mercy! Madeline Evans. Brianna Withridge. Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux. You have been found guilty of committing the darkest art... Witchcraft. For this affront against God, I hereby condemn you to burn in the fires of hell. Of which you so eagerly seek communion. You think this ends with a lick of flame? I sleep but a while... And when the time is appointed, my heir will awaken me... And I will have vengeance! So, you found it on 'E-bay'? Yeah, this old guy in Nice was auctioning it off. I had to max-out my entire credit card to get it... But I couldn't resist, it was like it was calling to me. The spell-book of Countess Isabelle Marguerite Thoreaux. Those look like the same symbols in the cave. Yeah. Maybe it will help explain what happened in Paris when I touched Isabelle's tomb. And the tattoo, and the missing 12 hours... So, how's your Latin? About as good as my Italian, which... I don't speak. Oh, I'll get it. - Oh my God... - What? This is the symbol from Isabelle's tomb. That's kind of spooky. You O.K.? Never been better. Hey Lois, what are you doing here, why aren't you in school? We're having a surprise party for Chloe's 18th birthday in your barn, remember? No, I remember telling you you couldn't have it here. Too late now! Everyone's already been invited, and you really don't want it getting back to Chloe that you rained on her shindig, That would hurt her feelings. - What? - Then I'd have to hurt you. - Listen, Lois, I don't wanna. - Would you give me a hand with these, I have to get the wheels back to my dad before he realizes they're missing. Lois, we can't do this tonight, the guy from Princeton's coming to meet me. - Besides, my parents are out of town. - Relax, 'Smallville. ' It's just going to be a couple of people, standing around singing 'Happy Birthday. ' It's not going to be Sodom and Gomorrah. Mr. Ivy League won't even know we're here. Trust me. Hair of 2 virgins. Ha, we've been a good little girl, haven't we? Hello? Oh, you are home. I've been calling, but no one answered. Well, I've been kind of preoccupied. Science project. From what century? It's a whole retro thing. Trying to recreate some stuff they did in the 1600s. Oh. I really think you two are going to like it. Damn. I left my phone in your car. Do you mind? Oh no, no worries. This smell of science is making me crave and aromatic latte anyway, so I'll just meet you downstairs with your cell phone. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks! What's the matter with you? You were supposed to take Chloe shopping, so that I could finish everything with the party? Right. Must have slipped my mind. Wow. Get some traction. 'Little Miss Reporter' there? She can smell a ruse a mile away. I'm going to need some serious help to keep her from ferretting out whatever it is we're planning tonight. Ow! - Oh no, no, that's no good. - Well yeah, not since you pulled it out! - It was grey. - I don't have grey hair. I'm just going to use your bathroom for a second. 7. Hair of 2 virgins 8. Oil of Mushroom Maybe you need a woman's touch. Hey. Lana. Hello Clark. It's a big box. It's a gift for Chloe. Lois and I got it for her. I'm sure that she'll love it. Especially if it's from you. Look, I'm glad you're here. I wanted to talk to you about what happened with Jason. Oh don't worry about it. It's water... under a very tall bridge. Are you feeling O.K.? You seem a little... different. Maybe it's the company. Jason's my friend. Well, he doesn't think so... - Hey! What you doing? I wanted a lock of your hair for a scrapbook I'm making for Chloe's birthday. Well all you had to do was ask! Well where's the fun in that? What happened to these? They were broken already. Here, is that enough? It's perfect. Thanks, handsome. You play beautifully. Thanks, but I'm afraid I'm a little rusty. Well I hate to interrupt, but... I wanted to ask you for a favor. Have I ever been able to refuse Lana Lang? What do you need? Oh, a good bottle of wine for Chloe's birthday. The last time I checked, she wasn't turning 21 yet. I know, but I thought it'd be nice to raise a glass with her and Lois to celebrate. I promise I won't tell anyone where I got it from. It'll be our little secret. Well, I think I might have a light Riesling that won't do too much damage. Actually I was looking for more a vintage Merlot from the South of France. Something from the vineyard in the Londoc or possibly the Doldogne, that should do in a pinch. Well, your tastes have certainly matured from a summer in Paris. Just give me a second. 1902, from the Salgier vineyards in Londoc. It should make quite the birthday present. What is this? Just a little something I picked up in St. Petersburg. It's an illuminated manuscript, depicting the ancient... You're lying... What? You know its true nature, but the map was not meant for you. Lana, how did you know there's a map hidden under the page? Because... - [Latin] - Lana, what did you do? You seek the stones, don't you? Well, we can't have that. I think that you're right, Alexander, you do need more practice. Keep playing... 'Infinitas'. [Latin] O.K. What are we doing in the woods? Chloe's right behind me, and the moonlight nature hike, it's making her a little suspicious. I thought it'd be nice to get together with my girls before the party. What party? Way to ruin the surprise. Oh you mean the party that you've been planning for the last month? You knew about that? 'Hello!' Investigative Reporter, nothing gets past me! Except... why we're playing 'Wood Nymph' when there's a party waiting for me with my name on it. Then we'd better hurry. A toast. In honor of this special night. Alright. This is getting better. No matter how much time passes... old friends are never forgotten. I'll drink to that. Cheers. Madeline? Brianna? Welcome to the 21st century. How did we come to be here? The last spell I cast before Wilkins condemned me to the Pyre. My blood entwined with a symbol in the book which called to my heir. And when she touched it, I gained possession of her body. And brought you back. I'm gorgeous! Look at these! Yes, they're very nice. Ah, the woods of France. I'd know them anywhere. We're in Kansas, Madeline. - Where? - The Americas. I am unsure as to why I was resurrected here, it was not my intention, but... The book! Do you have it? It is ours once again. And with it our magics... Now we may continue our quest for the stones... Is that the same quest that got us burned at the stake? That was not pleasant. A small toll to travel the road of ultimate power. You have your hosts' memories, use them to navigate this world... And help us to seize the power! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHLOE Hey, Jason, do you know where the girls are, they were supposed to be here 1 hour ago. No I'm sorry. - Look, Jason. - Clark, I'm only here because Lana wants me to be here. Because I'm her boyfriend. Whether you like it or not. We don't have time for this. Time is the only thing we do have. Isn't that what you said before the angry mob set us on fire? You're really not going to let that go, are you? The guy from Princeton's going to be here any minute, why are you so late? I took the scenic route. Love the view. Have you been drinking? So, I don't want to be rude but I think I'm just going to tell Chloe Happy Birthday and take off. - You're a big boy. You can do what you want. - You're the one who wanted me here. - Well, things change. Why are you acting like this? And why are you dressed like that? Because it makes me feel sexy. Weren't you leaving? - The food is so good in this century! - And the men actually bathe. And the bodies are so hard! But we have definitely had better celebrations. This is appalling. We could change that. Well it has been 400 years. Perhaps a little fun before we continue our quest. [Latin] Clark? Where's Clark Kent? Clark! Clark! Mr. Jacobs. Princeton University? Hey, come on in, join the party! Woooo! Hey, mom! How was Metropolis? Really. I'm glad you're having a great time. What? Oh yeah, the guy from Princeton. I met him last night. I, uh... Don't worry... I think I made an impression. Lex. Can I talk to you for a second? I've got a big problem. I was supposed to meet this alumni from Princeton last night, but then... Lois wanted to throw a party for Chloe in the barn, the party kind of got out of hand, then the guy from Princeton showed up, and I think I blew it. Look, I hate to ask you, but do you have any connections at Princeton? Lex? Lex, what are you doing? Stop! - Stop it! - I can't! - Lex, what happened? - Lana... You really shouldn't play with that. You might hurt yourself. I heard you and the girls were the life of the party last night. One last fling before I finish what I started a long time ago. You don't want to get in my way. Who are you? [French] - Isabelle? - In the new flesh. What did you do with Lana? She's in here somewhere. Could you let her out? Now why on Earth would I ever do that? You know all this started when Lana found this book. So I'm guessing if anything happens to this book... You have no idea what you're dealing with, Little Man... [Latin] So now you begin to understand... You're not but an insect in my path... One to be crushed on the journey toward greater things. Lana, no! Jason! Are you O.K.? THE BARN... MIDNIGHT You're early. Not planning something devious, are you Clark? What did you do to Lex and Jason? Nothing, compared to what we're going to do to you... [Latin] I don't know what's going on, but this needs to stop, before it gets out of hand. So, you're more than just fast. That will make this a whole lot more exciting. [Latin] I don't want to hurt anyone. Your magics are impressive. Magic? But so are mine. [Latin] We have travelled through the ages to complete our quest. I wouldn't doubt this now - We will not be undone my a farm boy with a few tricks. He's not what he seems, Isabelle. - I can feel his power. - Then perhaps we should rid him of it. Chloe, you've got to help. - I know you're in there. - Clark? Listen to me, you've got to help me. [Latin] It is done. His powers are gone. He awakens. What have you done to me? We made sure you're no longer a threat... Sorcerer. I'm not a sorcerer. You're not? Are you sure? No. He's something else. Something special. I could sense it when your magics were ripped from your body. I can taste it on you. The 3 stones of power... You know of them, don't you? I've never heard of them. You've done more than hear them... You've touched them. We can feel it. There's more. You know where one of them is hidden. Tell us where it is, Clark. Please tell us. I don't know what you're talking about. Let me cut it out of him... No! There are easier ways to get what we want. This body I inhabit... You have desires for it, don't you? Well it desires you too, Clark. Very... very much. [Latin] THE... CAVE... Thank you, Clark. You've been very helpful. [Latin] Clark? You alright? What happened? Did Lana do this to you? Take it easy... Where is she, I need to find her. She's with Lois. And Chloe, but they're different they're not themselves it's like their bodies have been taken over. They have. In fact this is going to sound kind of 'out there'... let's get you up... Lana has been researching a 17th century witch. She tracked down her spell-book, and when she touched her hand to the page... Wait a second, Lana's been possessed by the spirit of an evil witch? Yes. Isabelle got into Lana by using the book. So we've got to find her and destroy the book. Any idea where they went? I'm not sure. Why don't you check the school? I'll go to the Talon. Alright. Clark. Call my Cell if you find them, don't... Don't try anything alone. Just be careful, O.K.? Begins to make sense... Why I was ressurrected here, in this time, 1000 leagues from my home. It was destiny. Can you feel it? Calling to us. The 1st stone of power lies behind this wall. And with it, our magic shall increase ten-fold. And when we possess all the stones, we shall walk on Earth as Gods among men. Reach out, and seize what was meant to be! [Latin] [Latin] All of our suffering, all of our pain and persecution... It ends tonight. - And our future begins. - Take it Isabelle, lead us to glory! The 1st stone. How I've dreamed of this moment. And at last, it has arrived... Not quite. You shouldn't have come, Clark. Silly boy. We owe you a debt for revealing this chamber to us. We were going to let you live. I'm sorry Lana, but I can't let you do this. Bear witness, Clark Kent... to the dawn of a new age! - His powers are restored. - How? I'm not from around here. It doesn't matter. We took them from you once before. Do you really believe that this time will be any different? I'm counting on it. No! Why are we lying in the dirt? And what the hell are we wearing? Are you O.K.? Clark, what happened? Let's just say that, you haven't been yourself lately. - Look who's finally awake. - Mom! - When did you guys get home? - This morning. Your dad is out there doing your chores. - Sorry. I guess I overslept. Hey dad. Hey Clark. Son, is there maybe a little something you'd like to tell your mother and me? Where did that come from? From out in the barn. In the hay. - Clark! - It was magic. - I'm sure it was. - No, I mean... it really was! Look I should not have thrown this party without talking to you guys, I know that. But, it's the way things spun out of control. It was Lana, well it wasn't Lana exactly... She was possessed by a witch, who then cast a spell on us, and... That's how that happened. Son, I realize that after all, this is Smallville, but witches and spells... and... Magic? Dad, magic exists... I saw it. And worse, it can hurt me. You leave quite a path of destruction. Lex! I was going to come see you. Pre-emptive strike. Just in case there was any 'Evil Dead' action still brewing. Apparently, I have been exorcised. I didn't do anything to you, did I? Nothing permanent, but... you did display some intriguing abilities. I don't remember anything. I don't think I really want to. I'm just glad you're alright. Thanks to Clark. I don't remember what he did, but... Isabelle's back to being history. I guess we all owe Clark our gratitude. Yeah. You know, I really don't understand him. He can be so selfless, risking his life for his friends and... then he turns around, and gets Jason fired. Because what, he jealous? Lana. Clark didn't get Jason fired. I did. You what? Look, no matter how mature you may think you are, the fact is you're still in high school, and... I wasn't going to sit idle while someone in a position of authority coerced you into a relationship. What are you doing Lex? I'm trying to protect you. Do you really think that's what I need? Lana, I know you're upset. But I only had your best interests at heart. My interests are none of your concern, Lex. I'm old enough to decide who I want in my life. And who I don't. At least those aren't mine. Hey... Lana. I wanted to thank you. Once again, you managed to come to my rescue. Well it's good to have the old Lana back. Isabelle was... Aggressively sexy. Oh great. Possessed by an evil slut. Look, I found out the Lex was the one that got Jason fired. I should have known that you would never do anything like that. Look, I wasn't thrilled when I heard about you and Jason. But I realize that the way I acted when we were together didn't make you happy. I always resented you for keeping secrets from me. And I don't want to do the same thing to you. Clark, there's a reason that I came back to Smallville. When I was in Paris, I touched Isabelle's tomb, and there was this flash of light, and the next thing I remember is waking up in my apartment. And I had this. I've seen this before. On the cave wall. I should have told you this months ago, but I was too scared. Clark, you know those caves better than anyone else... Do you know what this symbol means? No. I'm sorry. Subtitles by Topaz420 (topaz420@hotmail. com) for Argenteam (www. argenteam. net) Subtitles checked and syncronized by Little Miss
