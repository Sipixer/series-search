Clark, pick up the pace, somewhere between brisk walk and super-speed. The star witness testifies in 15 minutes. Not that I mind being your boy Friday... ...but I don't understand why you need an escort. I don't. I just thought a nice little courthouse field trip... ...might reignite the journalism spark. - Well, I hate to break it to you... ...but my ace reporter days ended when I left <i>the Torch.</i> All right, then consider it a much needed get off the farm pass. Clark, this has been the year from hell. That was before you broke up with Lana. There are only so many days you can hole yourself up... ...before I pull an intervention. - Wait, I am not holed up. It's just, ever since I found <i>out...</i> ...that Lionel knows my secret, I've been waiting for a bomb to go off. Don't duck and cover yet. I mean, for all we know... ...he may never even light the fuse. This is Lionel Luthor we're talking about. You okay? You... You saved my life. - I don't know how to thank you. - I did what anybody else would have. I'm sorry, I have to go. Thank you again, really. Hey. Now, you couldn't do that on the farm. Thanks to you, that guy's got a lease on life. Nice work. Careful. Holding room checks out. - Witness has arrived safe and secure. - <i>Copy that.</i> There's only one way into this room. We're guarding it. Get your stuff on. Can I help you with that? All right, we're calling security. Man down. Man down, secure the area. - Man down, secure the area. - He's not breathing. Call an ambulance. Give it up. Die samurai, die. Anyone want a piece of this? Take that. Lois. Too late, sucka! Yojimbo, you are mine. Lois. Aw, come on, Smallville, you killed me. - Where did all this come from? - Good question. I think there's a card somewhere. Looks like Christmas came early this year, in Hi-Def surround sound, no less. The delivery guys were unloading it. - You win a raffle or something? - Not that I know of. There you go. "clark." - And I'll just get to work. - Who's it from? I don't need a signature. This is from Lionel Luthor. Clark, I wouldn't jump to conclusions. I warned him to stay out of our lives. - This is his way to buy himself back in. - I really don't think Lionel would do <i>this...</i> ...but I'll go call and find out. Clark, do you remember that trial... ...that was cancelled due to circumstances? The star witness was murdered in the basement of the courthouse. The basement? Are there any leads? Nothing. And now the prosecution has no case. Looks like this story has gone from legal to lethal. I guess this is a bad time to ask for a favor. You kidding? The times you've saved my <i>butt...</i> ...you can pull a coin from the favor bank any time. What's up? Someone sent me a 50-inch plasma with all the bells... ...forgot to sign the gift card. Clark, that's not a problem. That's winning the trifecta. - When's movie night? - Never. - I sent it all back. - No, you didn't. Yes, I did. I'm not gonna accept a gift like that... ...when I don't know who it's from. I called Metro Plasma. They won't give me any information. - Can you call them, get in their records? - Sure. It sounds like a move straight from Lionel Luthor. That's the thing that I thought. My mom called. He had nothing to do with it. It looks like your secret Santa remains anonymous. He paid in cash. If not Lionel, what about Luthor Jr? Lex? Why would he send me a home theater system? Maybe he's feeling guilty. Guilty about what? I don't know. I mean he hasn't exactly been the best friend lately. So he also has been known to try and win you over with expensive toys. He did say he wanted to try to find some common ground. I'm gonna go talk to him. What's the deal, senator? Do you not like kids? Because a no-vote on Senator Kent's bill is <i>like...</i> ...ripping the textbooks out of their sticky fingers. Thank you, senator. Bye, now. Yes. Official warning: I'm a third-degree black belt. That means I can't be liable for any funeral costs. Go easy on me. I'm a friend of clark's. Are you his girlfriend? Not in this lifetime. I'm Lois. Lois Lane. Pleasure to meet you, Lois. - I'm Graham. - Hey. So where's the plasma? So you're the one who sent over all the high-tech booty. You know, I was gonna keep it. Mr. <i>L-can't-take-candy-from-strangers...</i> ...took every thing back this morning. - That's odd. - That's clark Kent. Can I ask why you're playing Daddy Warbucks with the guy? Because in my world, friends don't give friends $20,000 toys. In my world they do. - Is Clark around? - No, not at the moment. Of course, he never stays gone for too long, so... If you wanna hang out, you're more than welcome. I think I will. I see you stepped up your security. I had to make a pretty good case before they'd let me in. You're not an easy person to say no to. I couldn't wait any longer. I've been sitting by the phone. What'd you find out in D. C? A lot of plausible deniability. From the Pentagon to the White House... ...no one can verify the existence of Milton Fine. He works in a branch of the government. Maybe it's more covert than we think. If he even works there at all. Those classified documents he gave you, you think they're a forgery? No, I had them authenticated, but that doesn't mean anything. We have no idea who this guy really is. No. No. Don't worry. I'll find out. You know, I was only gone for a week... ...but I actually got a little homesick. What's so special about Smallville? Oh, I don't know. Cows. Cornfields. Wide open spaces. I missed you too. You have no idea. Hey. Riddle me this: How does an assassin... ...get in a completely sealed room unseen. You knew, didn't you? No, that's why it's a riddle. I asked you how Lana was doing... ...and you avoided the subject like the plague. You knew about her and Lex. I'm sorry, clark. But I didn't think it was my place to get involved. You're supposed to be my friend. - I am your friend. - You are? - Then why didn't you say anything? - I'm Lana's friend too. And she asked me to keep it a secret. I thought you of all people would respect that. You know how dangerous Lex is. Any friend of <i>Lana's...</i> ...would never let her get involved. - I wasn't jumping for joy. But Lana's a big girl. Where are you going? Clark, where are you going? Lana has no idea what she's getting herself into. Let me remind you that you broke up. That means Lana can date whoever she wants without your permission. I know. But I still care about her. And I don't wanna just stand by and watch her get hurt. Look, I hate to be the one to say this, but you don't have a choice. Let me guess... ...bad breakup? I've had a few of those. You're the guy from the courthouse. You're a tough man to please. What's the problem, you don't watch Tv? - Wait, you sent that? - You saved my life. If it wasn't for you, I'd be in a morgue with tire tracks across my forehead. It's the least I can do. How did you find me? I never told you my name. That press pass around your neck did. The fact that I'm familiar with the area led me straight here. - Oh, you're from Smallville. - Drove through last year on business. Clark, if the big screen's not your thing, what is? Help me out here. There must be something I can do for you. Your thank you is fine. I appreciate the gesture. You don't need to repay me. This isn't about you, clark. It's about me. I don't ever like to be in debt. And the fact is... ...I owe you my life. Let me buy you dinner. - I'm staying in Metropolis. I'll take you. - Thanks, but really, I'm okay. You're hanging out in a barn <i>alone...</i> ...in the middle of nowhere. That doesn't seem too okay to me. Hey, come on, over here. Looks like the chicken finally flew the coop. Getting worried about you, man. We were going to dinner. What's going on with the party? Made a killing the other day... ...and it's all thanks to clark Kent. - You thirsty? How about a Mojito? - No, thanks, I'm good. - What exactly do you do? - I'm a headhunter. I travel the world tracking people down, you know, for jobs. I'd like you to meet my date. Hey, good for you. Lois. - Smallville. - We met out at your house. I couldn't disappear without seeing her again. Lois, can I talk to you for a second? - How about later? - It's fine. I'll be right back. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Lois. Look, Clark, I happen to actually like this guy. So do me one favor and pretend not to know me. - Lois... - No. Hey, pal, you gotta check out the view from the balcony. You know, I'm not crazy about heights. Trust me. It's worth it. Oh, good, I can make it. It's gotten pretty big right now. Beautiful night, huh? Yeah, it is. I'm Gia. Hi, Gia. - I'm clark. - I know. Guy like you... You must have a girlfriend, huh? Me? I... ...don't. Do you wanna take a tour? I hear the view from the bedroom is even better than the balcony. What's wrong? I don't even know you. That's okay. Graham warned me you might be shy. Graham? He wants you to have a good time. I'm sorry, I think there's a misunderstanding. I should go. Whoa, whoa, what happened? Where are you going? Look, if you wanna do me a favor, consider us even. I gotta go. Look, Clark, I apologize. I thought Gia was just what the doctor ordered. But I was wrong. You're a lot deeper than I gave you credit for. You must have really loved your ex. What's the problem? Let's get you two back together. - It's a little late for that. - It's never too late. It is when she's already with someone else. That might make it difficult but not impossible. - Who's the lucky bastard? - Someone I used to call my friend. That's not crossing the line. That's just plain wrong. Yeah, well, if you knew Lex Luthor you wouldn't be surprised. That billionaire might be with her now. But don't lose faith, clark. If it's meant to be, things have a way of working themselves out. - Well, I hope you're right. - I know I am. I'm always right. Rest assured, Fine, we're close. Viruses are being genetically spliced as we speak. Lex! Help! Help, please! Call an ambulance. Hurry. Lex... ...it's gonna be okay. Chloe called me. She told me what happened. How's he doing? Luckily, his trachea didn't collapse. And the doctor sedated him for the pain. - Where's Lionel? - Lionel's on his way from Singapore. You're a good friend for staying here with him like this. Someone should be with him when he wakes up. Yeah... ...of course. Do they know who did this? I gave them a full description. You were there when it happened? I was returning some books and I walked in on the attack. What does the guy look like? Dark hair, dark eyes. About six feet tall. Was wearing a black trench coat. Clark, he seemed to vanish into thin air. Quite a sweet tooth you got there. My dentist would agree. - I thought you were heading out. - I was. But I couldn't get a certain someone out of my mind... ...someone with a beautiful smile and apparently a lot of cavities. Look, if you think I'm blushing, I'm just a little sunburned. Well, if you're not too busy applying the aloe vera... ...you wanna go see Coldplay with me? Tonight? Wow, they're playing in Metropolis? Actually, Chicago. I chartered a jet. We'll have dinner on it. You like Italian? Graham, if you wanna go out, you don't have to play the jet-setter card. It's not a card. It's a reality. I work for large corporations that take care of me. I should think about getting a job... ...in the whole corporate headhunting business. - Sounds like a load of fun. - It is. But it can get a little cutthroat. So, what do you say? Look, I love jetting off to Coldplay concerts like the next girl, but really... ...I'm just as happy going down to Jo's for some Foggybottom burgers. Then I'll tell you what. We'll have Foggybottom burgers on the plane. Pick you up at 6? I'll be wearing my glass slippers. Afraid the party's over. Clark, you know Lois well. Is she a candy or flowers kind of girl? You tried to kill Lex. Me? Why would I do that? You have some sick idea you'd be doing me a favor. Well... ...you do have to admit... ...if Lex was out of the picture and Lana was as free as a bird... I'm taking you to the police. I guess I'm not the only one who's got a little secret. If your meteor-challenged friend tried to kill Lex to repay a favor... ...it's not the first time he's murdered someone. In fact, he might even be the Chameleon. Who's the chameleon? Hitman for hire. Number eight on the FBI's Top <i>40...</i> ...and climbing the charts. He's also the prime suspect for the courthouse murder. Which was after I saved Graham. His trademark is getting to his victims... ...in highly secure locations. He leaves no prints... ...no images on surveillance cameras, and no clues. Meteor power would explain it. He said he'd been in Smallville. Well, unfortunately, there's no record of camouflage power on the Wall of Weird. And the name Graham Garrett didn't get any hits. This guy's totally off the grid. If I hadn't saved him, that witness would be alive... ...and Lex wouldn't be in the hospital. - I gotta stop him. - Well, it's easier said than done. When you're a wanted man, invisibility really comes in handy. Every law enforcement agency has been after him for the last year. I'm no typical law enforcement agency. Clark, don't get too cocky. Not only does this guy know your power, he could very well know your weakness. How would he know about the meteor rocks? Clark, he's the ultimate fly on the wall. And he's buzzing over to the Talon later on tonight... ...for his date with Lois. I gotta call and warn her. Hello? What are you doing here? Lois, I've been calling, knocking on the door. - How long have you been in there? - About an hour and a half. - What? - Hey. You weren't in my bathroom, were you? I just walked in the apartment. That's weird. I could've sworn someone was in there. - Graham. - You're blaming Graham? It's pathetic. - Lf you see him, stay away. - Why do you feel the need... ...to lob a grenade at every guy I date? Quiet. He's here. Amazing what you can learn as a fly on the wall. These meteors that fell from the sky the day I drove through town... ...they might hurt you... ...but they gave me the greatest life I could ever ask for. You were in Smallville the day of the shower? Luckiest day of my life. Think using your power to be a hero's a rush? Nothing beats using them to kill. I saved your life. You should have taken the plasma. Now that my identity's in jeopardy, I have no choice. I have to get rid of you, Lex and Lana. - No. - They saw who I was, Clark. In my work, you don't leave loose ends. You'll never get away with it. I always do. Hey. You're not supposed to talk. I'm not supposed to do a lot of things. Did they catch the guy? No, not yet. But they're going to. Lex, I don't understand who would want to do this. Pick a number. There are a lot of people who want to see me breathe my last breath. But I'm not going to make it easy for them. I have too much to live for. Thanks for being here. As you can see, there's not exactly a... crowd of well wishers... ...knocking down the door to be at my bedside. Actually, I wasn't your only visitor. Clark stopped by earlier. Really? Yeah. It's too bad it takes a near-death experience... ...to bring old friends together. Did you tell him about us? I don't owe clark anything, Lex. Especially the truth. I know you're angry at him. - But he deserves a modicum of respect. - This isn't about anger. I'll tell him when I'm ready, on my own terms. Lana, don't let him find <i>out...</i> ...from someone else first. Lois! Hey. Where's clark? No clue. He just busted in here, warned me about Graham... ...and took off. - Any idea where? I wasn't exactly paying attention. To be honest, I am starting to get a little tired... ...of him thinking I need his approval just to go on a simple date. Can you tell me why he's obsessed with my love life? Lois... ...Graham's a killer. A professional hitman. - Of course he is. - We need to find Clark. Clark! Clark! Waitress said he ran out back. He can't be far. You'd be surprised. Hey, Smallville! Clark? - Clark? - Clark? - Smallville! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Jesus. Oh, my... Clark! Clark! Damn it. Come on, Clark. - Hey, are you okay? - Wake up. Clark, wake up. He's going after Lex and Lana. Is everything okay? Yeah. I just thought you were somebody else. It's just <i>me...</i> ...bringing you a little comfort. I thought you'd prefer these to the uncomfortable hospital garb. They're perfect. - Lex? - Lana... - What's happening? ...get behind me. Lana, run. Run! Go! You saved my life. - Good morning, senator. - Hi. Good news. - You have Senator Wickman's vote. - That's great, Lois. So how are you? Clark told me what happened. Me? I'm fine. Getting swept off my feet by a notorious hitman... ...is just my way of living la vida loca. There's no way you could have known the truth about him. Maybe. But it does confirm a very disturbing trend in my life. And as much as I'd like to deny <i>it...</i> ...I seem to be a magnet for guys on <i>America 's Most Wanted.</i> Oh, I don't believe that. Trust me, you don't wanna see the rap sheets. Why can't I meet a decent guy from a decent family... ...who happens not to be a psychopath? Oh, Lois. You know... ...when I was your age... ...I wasn't dating Prince Charmings either. - Really? - Yeah. I used to attract the dark, mysterious type too. Until I met Jonathan. See, what worries me is that... ...when my Jonathan finally does come around... ...I'll be looking the other way and I'll miss him completely. Well, you have to keep a closer watch. You know, I think we go through these bad relationships for a reason. Well, if there's a good reason for all the pain and aggravation, I'm dying to know. Maybe you have to get through all the wrong men... ...so you can recognize the right one. Congratulations on your first front-page byline. Yeah, and you deserve all the credit. Or the blame. If saving strangers gets people killed, it's not the business I wanna be in. Do you have a choice? I'm nowhere near <i>super...</i> ...but if I see someone drowning, I'll throw a rope. And what if that person's a killer, Chloe? What if the world would actually be better off? That's still... That's not your choice to make. I mean, ask a doctor, or a firefighter... ...or anyone in the hero business. You save first and you ask questions later. Yeah. I guess you're right. It's just not always that easy. Especially when the person you're saving is Lex Luthor. I should never have questioned your friendship. You were angry. And I understand. It's not a walk in the park to see the one you love in the arms of someone else. Of all the people in the world, why Lex? Just like you can't pick and choose the people you save... ...you can't control who your ex-girlfriend dates. That's the way it is. You have no idea how hard it was to see them like that. It's like I couldn't breathe. I'm sorry you had to find out that way. I know how much it must have hurt. But you know, Lana's moved on. Maybe it's time you started doing the same thing. I thought you loved that telescope. I did. Doesn't work anymore. Lex got out of the hospital today. Well, that's great. He's a lucky guy. Clark, when you and I were together... ...nothing bothered me more than when you were less than honest with me. And I don't wanna be like that. That's a good choice. At the hospital... ...when I told you I was at the mansion to return books... ...I was lying. Lex and I have actually been spending a lot of time together. You know, I kind of noticed. Clark, it's more than that. We're seeing each other. And I thought that it would be best if you heard it from me first. Lana, I know you don't wanna hear <i>this...</i> ...especially from me. - You can't trust Lex. - And I could trust you? I just don't wanna see you get hurt. I know you think you're being some kind of a hero, Clark... ...but the truth is... ...I don't need you to protect me. Lana. Clark... ...it's over. You made that decision. Subtitles by
