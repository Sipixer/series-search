No, the money wasn't the problem. I had to ditch my roommate. You don't know my roommate. Here, $2000, the rest of my savings. No worries, Lana, we're just about fixed for your fix. This is not a drug trip. Relax, Lance, just a little syringe-speak humor. I wasn't implying that it's a hallucination. Damn straight. This little cocktail is my lock on a Nobel Prize. And a big fat deal with the pharmaceutical company. I wanna stay down longer this time. - Two minutes. - Forget it. - It's too dangerous. - Come on, Lance. It's only 20 seconds longer than last time, and I almost found them. What could it hurt? I've been down almost as long. You know you can bring her back. Mom. Dad. Oh, my God. I never thought I'd see you again. - I've missed you so much. - Oh, we've missed you too, honey. I've just been so confused, I didn't know where to turn. - We know how hard it's been. - I loved him so much. - I thought I could handle it. - We're here for you, Lana. No! No! No... - I got her. - Lana, chill, you're good. Back among the living. You were gone too long. We almost didn't get you back. Wait. It wasn't long enough. I have to go back. Clark? We've got a problem. Fast, but oddly formal. Usually when I say it's <i>urgent...</i> ...you rip in here without the least regard for my privacy. - I didn't wanna disturb you. - Don't worry, Lana's not here. Actually, she didn't come home at all last night. It's not another guy. She's been hanging out with these med students... ...and they keep really wicked hours. But you know, Clark, it will happen. Eventually she will find someone else. Yeah, she deserves to be happy. What's our crisis? Mass destruction and death in Central America. And the possibility that your former professor, Milton Fine, is involved. - No, he's dead. - I know we thought we saw him die. But the only thing we're really sure <i>of...</i> ...is that he disappeared, and so did that ship. - Where'd you get this? - A source tipped me off. - Catch you later, Lana. - Yeah. I'll call you later. - Sorry. - You guys are friends. It was bound to happen sometime, right? I didn't think you'd be back. So should I even bother asking what you were up to last night? Just hanging out, Chloe, it was no big deal. Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like all nighters agree with you. - You okay? - I'm okay. Because you don't look okay. Lana, I know that clark's breakup's been really difficult, but... chloe, it's not like someone died. All right? People break up every day. It's not a big deal. I'll get over it. In short, this minor tax increase... ...can make a major difference in our public schools. Senator, how do you feel about clayton's <i>allegations...</i> ...that your proposal will drain money from constituents... ...failing to help schools? I'd be more than happy to respond to the congressman's <i>concerns...</i> ...should Congressman Clayton care to ask me in person. - Thank you very much for coming. - Well, thank you, senator. Nice strategy, senator. When attacked, don't hesitate, come out fighting. I meant what I said. A public debate is what I'm hoping for. I'd hate to have to go through this every time. You won't. It'll get easier once you've made it clear you're a player. I've... I brought you something. Something that just might give you a bit of an edge. We're both going to that dinner tomorrow night... ...at the governor's mansion. A copy of my research. Everything there is to know about our dinner companions. Believe it or not, Lionel, I've done my homework. I know each person's position and what their voting record is. What I don't know is why you're doing this. I am not trying to manipulate your vote, Martha. Look at it. - Congressman Clayton plays polo? - His passion. - His daughter's a gymnast. - Olympic standard. Look, it may be a political function, but in my experience... ...the last thing anyone wants to do over dinner is talk shop. Just... It's another way to connect with your colleagues. Why don't we go together tomorrow night? I'll help you navigate the rough waters. Thank you. But, Lionel, I hope you're not expecting something on a personal level. The two of us will never be anything more than friends. I understand. Excuse me. Have you seen this man? Can I see that? Between the two is the labrum, or articular cartilage. Divide the deltoid and its attachments, then you'll cut through the humerus. Okay, you need to come through the bone two inches below the joint. - Lance. - What are you doing here? I have to do it again soon. You keep your voice down. You could get us expelled. - Get out of here. - No, wait. I have to go back there again. I have to see my parents. All right, but it's gonna cost you. - Five grand this time. - No problem. Don't move. Lana? My God, Lana, l... I had no idea it was you. I could have killed you. If you needed money, all you had to do was ask. I know. Lex, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna have to lie to you. - Just tell me what's wrong. - There's nothing wrong with me. You didn't wanna lie to me, but you broke into my house... ...and tried to steal from me. You're acting like a junkie trying to find her next fix. There's this guy at school. - He's created these chemicals. - So it is drugs. No. It's not what you think. They kill you, and then they bring you back. Lex, I died. I died and I came back. I'm telling the truth. I went to the other side... ...and I saw my parents. It was beautiful. No one understands the loss of a parent more than I do. And for you, growing up without a mother or father... ...I can even understand taking whatever chance you did to see them again. But you have to look at yourself. Look at what you've become. This isn't what your parents would have wanted for you. Lex, I'm sorry. I just... I wanted to see them so badly. I'm just so alone. I think maybe it's <i>time...</i> ...we both stop trying to hold on to the people we've <i>lost...</i> ...and start turning to the ones we still have in our lives. Yeah, I think you're right. - You're freezing. - Oh, no, I'm okay. No, I'm gonna get you a blanket. - Senor Fine? - Senor Fine. Hello? Lex? No. No, I don't know where she is, but I can find out. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. We need to talk. Lana warned us her roommate was nosy. You look worse than Lana. So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady on me? Bring me some chicken soup? No. I'm here because I'm worried about my friend. Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her. She's really vulnerable and depressed. The last thing she needs is to flunk out of school because she's out partying. - And you think it's your business? - I know it's my business. If you don't tell me what you guys are taking all night... ...I'll make it the university's business too. Chill. Lana hasn't been <i>partying...</i> ...and she isn't moping around, mourning her high-school sweetheart. Well, she isn't exactly acting like herself. The two of you look like poster children for the Betty Ford Clinic. Look, I told you to let it go. Now I'm done talking with you. No. What is she taking? Drugs? You're so small-minded. No wonder Lana came to us. Came to you for what? That's between Lana and her loved ones. Alley, what is it? What's happening? Near-death experience. It's a compound, meteor rock. Oh, my God. I need an ambulance, please. It's an emergency. At Poss House, room 1170. Please, I don't wanna die. Oh, God. Lance? - What are you doing? - Getting rid of the evidence. Evidence? Alley, she's dead. What? What happened to her? I warned her there's only so many times you could die before you stay that way. Did your serum kill her? My serum didn't do anything. She did it to herself. Well, I'm willing to take my chances. I need you to send me back. Are you out of your mind? The police could be here any minute. I gotta get out of here. - Then we better hurry. - What the hell is this? Those are the keys to a very expensive Porsche, parked outside. Figured they'd cover the cost for one more trip to the other side. - You stole a Porsche? - No. I borrowed it from a friend. And he wants it back. Lex. Cool thing about expensive cars, they all come with GPS tracking. Lex, I can explain. Lex? Lex Luthor? Dumb bitch. I never should have let you in on this. - Lance, please wait. - I'm out of here. You're not going till the authorities get... Lana! Say goodbye, jackass. I'm gone. Mom? I used to practice this for hours when you were young. Before Julian was born. You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse. Such a good little boy. Never could get that part right. I was injected with a hypodermic full of some kind of chemical. - I must have gone into shock and... - Now you're dead. This is just a delusion. Like last time? What was it then that brought you to me? Oh, yes. You were shot after meeting with the man you hired... ...to destroy Jonathan Kent's <i>reputation...</i> ...so you could become senator. How'd that turn out, by the way? If you're my dead mother, wouldn't you know? It was a rhetorical question, Alexander. Of course I know. You ignored everything I showed you. The life you could've had, if only you had made a different choice. And what choice is that? You think the path you've chosen isn't going to hurt? It will. More than you can ever imagine. You're not the only one that's going to suffer. Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren by an emptiness that can never be filled. Unless I keep you here. Stay with me, Alexander. Don't let the blood wash away what's left of your soul. What are you talking about? What blood? Of all the people you're going to murder. No! My God, this stuff's got a kick. - What happened? - I was looking for Lana... ...and I found your body. I figured, if the green stuff killed you, the other one would bring you back. What? You were already dead. I figured I'd take a chance. - We have to help Lana. - Lana was here? Where is she, Lex? Chloe, I got your message. What happened? - Lex died. - What? Don't worry, I brought him back to life. He said Lana's about to take a cruise down the river Styx if we don't find her. - Chloe, what's happening? - You want the short story? Lana and her friends have been taking trips to the great beyond. They're using a meteor-rock cocktail to prolong their near-death experience. But if we don't find her in <i>time...</i> ...she may never come back from her next little jaunt. So they kill themselves and come back to life? - Yeah. - Why would Lana do something like that? Because she's hurting, clark. I mean, she won't talk to you or to me. Maybe she seeks comfort from the people who care about her most. The two people she knows love her unconditionally. - Her parents. - Yes. How are we gonna find her? Well, thanks to Homeland Security... ...being on a college campus is akin to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet. A student ID can be tracked anywhere, anytime. All we have to do is find out where she's been using it and hope she's still alive. Figured I'd find a junkie where needles are. Let me help. Tell Alley I said hi. Lana, are you okay? Clark, please help me. I need them. I need them. Lana. Please. Clark! Clark! Do you know how much trouble you caused me? You freshmen... We need to help him. Or choice B. I take care of both of you. Clark. Clark. Dad. Hello, son. I can't believe it's you. You don't belong here, clark. You have to go back. Dad, you don't know how hard it's been. All I've done is hurt everyone that's close to me. That's not true, son. You died because of me. When Jor-El brought me back to life and restored my powers... ...he told me there'd be a price: The life of someone I love. I'm sorry, Dad. - I'm so sorry. - Clark... ...believe me, you have nothing to be sorry about. I lived a... A full, wonderful life. I had everything that a husband or a... A father... ...could ever possibly dream of. I am so very proud... ...that I died protecting you. Protecting me from what? Lionel Luthor, Clark. He knows your secret. He knows everything. You can't stay here, son. You've gotta keep your mother safe. You've gotta keep the whole world safe. - No, Dad. - Clark... Not without you. Dad, I need you. I cannot do this without you. Yes, you can. This is your destiny, son. You are going to touch the lives of so many people. Not just as a man, but as a... As a symbol. You're a symbol of peace. You're a symbol of justice. And now it's time for you to go. Clark. - No, not yet! - I'll always be with you, son. - <i>Clark!</i> - Always. Clark, please. Clark! Clark. Mom?! - Mom! - Clark. Just the man I was looking for. What do you think? You look amazing. Well, if I can avoid dumping soup in my lap in front of the governor... No, you'll do great. What's wrong? Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about. He's early. I'm sorry. Well, don't you look dashing. Next to you, I'm a man in rags. You should always wear that color, Martha. Doesn't she look beautiful, clark? We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie. - Your carriage awaits, senator. - Good night, Clark. Good night, Clark. So apparently, actually dying neutralized the kryptonite in your system. - That's good to know. - Yeah. Although, it's nothing I ever plan to try again. Wise decision. Did you find out about your professor? Has Milton Fine been resurrected? Fine was definitely in Honduras with the black ship. I just don't know how. Well, I'll reach out to my source and see if they know anything else. Don't worry, you won the first fight. My money's on you in the rematch. Fine's not the only thing we need to worry about. When I was injected with the serum and died, I saw my father. Oh, my God. Clark. Yeah, he told me that there's someone else who knows my secret. Lionel Luthor. Well, you can't be sure. What you saw... ...it could have been a hallucination. You know, a manifestation of your desires and fears. Chloe, I could feel my father. It was real. I know it in my heart. Well, the source that led me to Fine was Lionel. - What? Why didn't you tell me? - He made me promise to keep quiet... ...under the umbrella of a reporter-source confidentiality. He knew exactly how to play me. He may be playing all of us. It's beautiful. It's my favorite. - Lex... - Is this gonna be another apology? Well, they don't make a card for "Sorry I got you killed." You weren't yourself. I know what that's like. Trust me. I'm glad you're all right. That I didn't end up like Alley. I have to admit... ...crossing over was a very enlightening experience. What did you see? My mother. What'd she say? She said that... She's very proud of the man I'm becoming. She should be. Clark, hi. How you doing? Well, to be honest, I've felt a lot better. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna hurt anyone. Except yourself. No, that's... I didn't want that, either. Well, then, why were you doing it? It wasn't because of us, clark. It was... Well, it was a lot of things. I've felt alone for a very long <i>time...</i> ...even when I was around other people. Even when I was with you. I guess I just wanted to feel their arms again. Feel their warmth. Did you? Almost. But it'll have to do. Because I won't let myself be that dependent again. No matter what I'm searching for. I hope so. Lana? All I want is for you to be happy. I will be. Subtitles by
