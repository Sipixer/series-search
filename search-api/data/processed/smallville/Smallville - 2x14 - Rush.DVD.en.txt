Why didn't you tell me it was here? I didn't know. I just downloaded the directions. Clark's gonna go crazy. What is his obsession with these caves? I don't know. I think Kyla really got to him. - I better give him call, give him a heads-up. - These caves survived hundreds of years. I don't think a little Moby's gonna hurt them. Okay? Let's go. Come on! Excuse me. Hey, excuse me. Can you please step off the walls. The paintings. Pete, I really don't think they care about the cave paintings. Yeah, but, Chloe, these pictographs are sacred. I'm sorry, do you guys know that the clay doesn't wash out of your clothes? Just gotta hit them where it hurts. Travis, what are you doing? Taking my shot. I always thought you were hot. I think you're kind of wasted. No, I'm just high on life. Chloe, did I just see you making out with your chem-lab partner? - Travis! - Hey, get down from there! Hey, get down from there! This is hopeless. I'm invincible! Pete! What are you doing? You nuts? - Just out taking a little spin. - Without your helmet, like a wild man. You could have hurt someone, most likely yourself. Yeah, that's a rush. Chloe told me what happened. Sorry I wasn't there to back you up. Hey, you're never more alive than the moment before you die. At least Travis had that. - Hey, you feeling okay? - I feel great. If you want to talk about what happened, I'm here for you. Clark, all you ever do is talk. For a guy who can't get hurt, you never take any risk. That's not true. What about with Lana? Now that Fordman's toast... ...when are you gonna take your shot with her? Come on, Pete, Whitney was your friend. Besides, it's not that easy. Why? Because you can't share your secret? - You shared it with me, and we're still cool. - That's different. You're just afraid she'll shut you down. You only go around once. Forget about the past. Focus on the future. Hey. Hey. Did you hear about Travis? Yeah, pretty sad, huh? Yeah. The police think he might have been on something... ...which is the only explanation. I mean, we always assume that we have all the time in the world, but we never know. The school counselor told me I need to look forward, embrace living, carpe diem. At first I thought it sounded corny, but the more I think about it, she's right. You know, I just don't want to be a spectator in my own life. Yeah, me neither. We should go on a date, together. In the near future. Are you serious? I was. - But if you don't want to go... - When? You mean you'll go? Yeah. I assume that was the answer you were looking for. - Yeah. I just didn't think it'd be that easy. - Well, all you had to do was ask. - Well, how about tomorrow? - Sounds like fun. - Right, it's a date. - Okay. Don't bother. I've got a maintenance crew coming. - Lex, I didn't see you there. - I was just checking for damage. Looks like it was quite a bash. Pete tried to break it up. Oh, I'm sure it was a noble effort... ...but not many teenagers are interested in 500-year-old cave paintings. - What's your interest, Clark? - What do you mean? When I fired the security guard, I asked him who else he let in these caves. He told me you were down here almost every day. Now, you wouldn't be keeping secrets from me, would you, Clark? Kyla gave her life for these caves. I'm doing a term paper on the drawings. "Deciphering the Mysteries of Hieroglyphics... ...by Dr. Fredrick Walden." Sounds like a real page-turner. Lex, why'd you start the preservation project? It's not like there's big business in caves. I like a good mystery. This one promises to be fascinating. Wouldn't you agree? I better get going. I told the new security men nobody comes down here without my permission. Nobody except for Clark Kent, of course. - Hey, I didn't hear you leave this morning. - Oh, I had to be here first thing. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were avoiding me. Don't take it personally. It's just how I cope. I don't want to be one of those annoying people that says: "I'm here if you need to talk," but I am. I appreciate it. Listen, if you don't feel like talking... ...I thought we could go to Metropolis tomorrow and do some serious shopping. My dad said that he would join in on the conspiracy and get us out of school early. Thanks, and I'd love to. But, you know, I already have plans with Clark. - What kind of plans? - Well... ...he asked me out on a date. I thought you were giving up on the mating dance. Yeah, yeah, me too. But you still said yes. - Look, if this is gonna be too weird for you... - No. My feelings for Clark are so ancient... ...they're... They're fossilized. Seriously, you should go for it. Are you sure? Lana, does it really matter how I feel? If I was in your position, I'd do the exact same thing. Don't let me be your excuse. Okay. I'm glad we cleared the air. Me too. - I'll see you tonight. - Okay. - Loans are expensive. - He might get a scholarship. - That would be great, especially with... - What's all this? We've got our finances under control. We're trying to get a head start on college. If you ever graduate from high school. What do you mean? Principal Reynolds called this morning. It seems you've been chronically late. He asked me if we had some emergency here at the farm we needed your help with. I've just been spending more time in the caves. Listen, son, we know how much they mean to you... ...but until you get on track, I don't want you down there. - No, Dad... - Don't argue with me. Once things get straightened out, we can talk... ...but until then I want your butt in this house every day after school. - Give me until tomorrow. - No. It's really important. What is it? I've got a date... ...with Lana. A study date? An actual date. Jonathan, you have to let him go. Please. Come on. Promise me you'll get your homework and chores done... ...before you set one foot outside of that door? Absolutely. - Okay. - Thanks, Mom. When you see Pete, tell him to stop cutting doughnuts in the field. He's scaring the cattle. I appreciate you coming on short notice, Professor Walden. Yeah, normally I wouldn't. It's not often that I'm offered my weekly rate for a 10-minute consultation. As I told your associate, I'm not able to take on any new endeavors at this time. Then when can you start? - Next year. - I was thinking more like tomorrow. I leave for Chile on Tuesday. I'm sure you can postpone your trip. It's out of the question. If you want the foremost authority in a field, Mr. Luthor, you learn... ...to wait. - In my experience... ...when you want the best, you simply pay them what they're worth. Rich men with delusions of grandeur... ...rarely sway me with a checkbook. Does this sway you? That is quite unique, I can tell you that. Doesn't appear to be Native North American or even Mayan, for that matter. These are amazing. Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete today? I think he skipped school. I asked him to help me with the memorial issue, but he totally blew me off. Why? He's just acting strange. I think Travis' death really got to him. Well, Pete did try and save him, but he just couldn't get there in time. - Maybe, you know, he feels guilty. - Definitely isn't acting that way. Different people deal with grief in different ways. Any big plans for the weekend? Do you know if they found drugs in Travis' system? The autopsy report was inconclusive. They found a small puncture wound on his neck... ...and his adrenal gland was unusually enlarged. Adrenaline gives you a rush. Maybe that's why he jumped. Yeah, but he wasn't the only one. Two others at the rave, one from Grandville, the other from Smallville... ...turned up dead. One took a swan dive into an empty pool... ...and the other wrapped his Corolla around a tree. Same puncture wound... ...same enlarged adrenal gland and same extreme behavior. Yeah, it's like they all had a death wish. - What do the police think? - Somebody sticking them... ...with a new designer drug. You think they got Pete? I don't know, but I know I need to get him to a doctor. See you later. Yo, Clark! What's up? Pete, get down from there. Pete, I have to get you to the hospital. Something happened to you at the rave. Sure, man, I'll be right there. No! You all right? You okay? Oh, yeah! That was amazing! Let's do it again. - I'm getting you to a doctor. - No! I feel great! - You're coming with me. - No, I'm not. And if you take one more step, I'm gonna tell all these people your secret! I dare you. He's an alien! He's an alien! I'm not lying! He's an alien! I'm telling the truth! Look out, my best friend's an alien! Whatever happened to Pete started in this cave. Have you gotten him to a doctor, or is he as needle-phobic as you? I haven't been able to find him. My dad called the Rosses. They haven't seen him. So, what exactly are we looking for? I don't know. A certain reporter friend of mine always said to explore all options. In that case, I'll look over here. Okay. I'll check out the other chamber. Hey! This cave is off-limits. Why don't you find somewhere else to make out? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. As for your snide remark... ...people haven't made out in this cave since the 20th century. Now, back off. Hey, you're Fredrick Walden, the linguist. - You wrote that book. - I've written many books. - Did Lex Luthor hire you? - Thanks to you, Clark. I'm counting on Professor Walden to translate these pictographs. - It'll help the preservation effort. - Rule one, no guided tours. They're friends of mine. I didn't realize you'd accepted my offer. I have, but we do things on my terms. I don't allow anybody except for staff. With all due respect, professor, I found the caves. I don't care if you discovered the Shroud of Turin. If you're unhappy with my method, I can take the first flight to Chile. - I'm sorry. - Lex, you can't do this. He's one of the most renowned linguists in the world. If that's the way he works... ...we have to respect that. Hey! You get down from there. Come on, Chloe, let's go. What are you smiling at? I want those photographs. - Take your own. - I'm serious, young lady. You're the cunning linguist. Why don't you translate this: Kiss my ass. Why did your dad call my parents? - Pete, calm down. - "Pete, calm down." I thought you were my friend. Pete, I think you're sick. For a guy who likes privacy, you sure stick your nose in other people's business. - You x-raying me? - There's something in you. You need to come to the medical center with me. Try and touch me, you freak. You're coming with me! You think because you have those powers, you always get your way. News flash, I know your weakness. Feels good, doesn't it? Pete... ...how could you do this? Back off, if you know what's good for you. Pete, come back! I'm serious! Come near me again, and I'll start selling tickets to your storm cellar. Run the new pigment sample with the base-line chromatography. Yes, doctor. - I came as soon as I got your message. - You need to see it with your own eyes. We think it's some kind of parasite. Found a nest of them behind one of the glyphs. It gets better. - You know what it says? - Not yet. My people are working on it right now. But I think it's meant as some kind of warning against intruders. - Are they poisonous? - I wasn't gonna take any chances. We destroyed the nest with liquid nitrogen. I wonder if the Kawatche tribe put them here to protect the drawings. Somebody did. Do you have any live specimens left? I want them sent to Cadmus Labs in Metropolis. Hey, Chloe, I need the... Don't worry, Clark. We're done. Can I get your number? Why? The thrill is gone. - Who was that? - I don't know. I met him in the hall. Thought he was cute. Asked him if he wanted to do some investigative reporting. Chloe, what's going on? Are you okay? Oh, Clark, don't tell me you're jealous. Thought you only had eyes for Lana. Oh, I heard about your date... ...but, of course, it's not like you have the guts to tell me. Is that what this is about? Don't flatter yourself, Clark. I just wanted to explore my options, take a risk. So, what can I do for you? Remember you said there was this weird hole in the back of Travis' neck? I was wondering if it could be from... ...some kind of parasite. What orifice did you pull that one from? - That's kind of harsh, isn't it? - Come on, Clark. It's not like you hit the mute button on your skepticism when I take a logic leap. It's just a hunch. Travis' adrenal gland was abnormal. Maybe the parasite was feeding off his adrenaline, making him want more. Don't you think they would have found the parasite during the autopsy? Not if it burrowed out of that hole after he died. All right, so, what do you need me for? I can't get within 50 feet of Pete. I figured you could talk to him. Chloe, I'm sorry you're angry with me about this date. I thought we knew where we stood. But the only thing I can think about is Pete. Sure, Clark. I'll do it for you. Just get him to your house. I'll see you there. It's a date. Hey, you're early. Wasn't expecting you for another hour. Not that I mind. I'm really excited about our date. So was I. Why are you speaking in the past tense? Lana, I can't go out with you tonight. If it wasn't a life-and-death situation, I wouldn't break this date for anything. What's going on? It's Pete. Something happened to him. If I don't get him to the hospital, he could die. - Is there anything I can do to help? - Chloe and I have it covered. Okay. I've done this to you in the past, and I wanted you to have a reason this time. It's not a problem. We've waited this long, what's another day? Hey, lovebirds, look who I found. Chloe, we were supposed to meet at your house. - Pete, how are you feeling? - Awesome. I've never felt better in my life. It sounded like you were on your deathbed. And you believed him? Haven't you learned by now? That's just Clark being Clark. I guess not. Pete, I need to get you help. Whoa, Clark, I know you're worried about me. You're my boy. You always have been, but I figured it out. In your world, green means stop. And red, red means go. We're gonna have some fun now. - Where are your parents? - Looking for you. - So, what's the plan? - I don't know. I was thinking maybe we go down to Saunder's Gorge and jump the quarry. - Lf we miss, Clark can catch us. - Let's do it. Yeah, right. I'm serious. Can we tell her? I'm surprised she hasn't figured it out. Figured out what? Hey, Pete, you do the honors? With pleasure. It gets better. Clark, it's a little dark in here. - How did you...? - Do that? What are you? Let's just say I'm not from around here. - You knew about this? - He's my brother... ...from another planet. You should see the look on your face right now. Oh, my God. This is so cool. Can you fly? Whoa, wait a minute. I may be an alien, but I'm not a cartoon. So if I fall... ...would you catch me? Go for it. My own personal superhero. I always knew there was something special about you, Clark Kent. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. You are. - Does he know? - No. I tell people who don't go around stabbing me in the back and lying to me. Clark, can I have a word with you? - Alone? - I'm busy. Don't even worry about it, Clark. It's cool. We'll meet you in the car. You know, I always wondered... ...for a boy who has all the money in the world... ...you'd think he could afford a good toupee. What's going on, Clark? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were on something. We're just having a good time, not that it's any of your business. Ever heard of a phone? You come barging in like you own the place. It's really... I came here to tell you, Clark, I talked to Walden. - He won't budge. - Or you don't want me in the cave? Don't lie to me. You're Lex Luthor. You pay a guy, he does what you tell him. Isn't that the way it works? - Clark... - I'm gonna go in those caves when I please. I dare you to stop me. Is this really about a term paper? You'd love to know, wouldn't you? I'm gonna go. So are you. I like to see you standing up for yourself, Clark, I really do. Be careful not to cross the line. Is that a threat? - Just giving you friendly advice. - Let me give you some back. If you know what's good for you, stay the hell away from me. - Come on, Pete, go faster. - I'm driving, I'm driving. Hey, Clark, what other superpowers you got? Why don't you come back here and find out. Hey, hey, hey, this isn't a pimp-mobile. - Dang, Chloe, never knew you had all that. - Just keep your eyes on the road, Pete. Guys, get a room. Where's the fun in that, Pete? I want you to make a quick pit stop before we go to the gorge. - Where? - The Talon. Oh, man. Excuse me. Hello! I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - We're not going anywhere. - Yeah, why don't you go get your manager. So, what do you wanna do next? - How about we play a game of strip poker? - We don't have any cards. Sure we do. Full house. Royal flush. Chloe, we can't do this. What...? What happened? Why the sudden Jekyll and Hyde? Don't tell me you're thinking about Lana. This has nothing to do with Lana. You don't have any real feelings for me, do you? Every time we hang out, it's just to get answers. Chloe, why don't you research this or why don't you look up that? I'm nothing more to you than your own personal search engine, and I'm sick of it. I want you, Clark. - Chloe, you have the parasite. - Well, I love the way I feel. So maybe this is exactly what I need... ...to spend more time actually living life and less time reporting it. Lana, this is not what it looks like. Yeah, it is, Lana. It's exactly what it looks like. Oh, and guess what, Clark told me everything. And I mean everything. Lana, I can explain. Chloe, you don't understand. You're not yourself. You need a doctor. What's all this doctor talk again? What happened to my little red rock? Pete, how could you do that to me? Relax, you needed it. Now, let's go jump the gorge. You guys can suck face later. No, Pete, I'm taking you to an emergency room. I don't care what you tell people about... How'd you do that? Clark's Achilles' heel. He may be a boy scout, but I'm always prepared. Let's go. Lana. - Where's Chloe and Pete? - I don't know. And to be honest, I really don't care. - Look at that drop. - It'll be like flying. - Who needs Clark? - Yeah, screw Clark! - We've got ignition! - What are we waiting for? Blastoff! - That was awesome! - One more time, Clark! - Oh, my God. - Joy ride's over. Hey. Hey. How you feeling? Finally made the Wall of Weird. Congratulations. I heard about that thing they extracted from me. Did they get a picture I could see? You don't need to see it. It's gross? - Pretty bad. - How's Pete? Pete's okay. He'll be fine. Good. So, what do you remember about what happened? Well, let's see, we were... We were in the cave talking to that obnoxious professor... ...and then... ...I was coming out of surgery. Everything else is just blank. Why? Did I miss anything exciting? No... ...nothing exciting. I'm glad you're okay. Me too. I'll just come back later. It's okay, Lana. I was just leaving. - I'll catch up with you later, okay? - Promise? Yeah. Lana, I'm sorry. I didn't come here to see you, Clark. I came here to see my roommate. She's been ill. - Hi. - Hey. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Not that I really remember everything that happened... ...but I have a feeling I should be apologizing. Oh, let's just say, you weren't yourself. So I guess your date with Clark was kind of a bust. Did I screw it up? Trust me, Clark screwed it up all by himself. What'd he do this time? Well... ...I caught him making out with another girl. - Really? - Yeah. Who was the girl? I didn't recognize her. Clark, are you sure that Chloe doesn't remember anything? I can't believe Pete slipped you a red meteor rock. It wasn't entirely his fault. Son, that's exactly the point. He knew exactly what to do to control you, and that's what scares us. It scares me too, Mr. Kent. Pete, hi. You're out. Yeah, back to normal, whatever that is. Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened. I don't even remember what I did. Clark filled me in. I just want to say that if you guys never want to speak to me again... ...I'll understand. - Pete... ...we knew the risks when Clark told you his secret. Our concern was always that it was an unfair burden on you. And as much as we'd like to take it off your shoulders, we can't. Besides... ...everybody stumbles. The important thing is you're safe, you're alive... ...and you're still a member of this family. Whether you like it or not. Thank you. Professor. I just got off the phone with Cadmus Labs. The dissection is done, I take it. The creature's physiology is completely unique. Its DNA is unlike anything on this Earth. Are you suggesting that these parasites are somehow alien in origin? I'm hoping the symbols on the walls might answer that question. - Then I'd better get to work. - Before I allow you to continue... ...I'm afraid you're gonna have to make a few concessions. - We've already negotiated my fee. - This isn't about money. You're gonna give Clark Kent unfettered access to the cave. Just what exactly is your fascination with this boy? My instincts tell me Clark knows a lot more about that cave than he's letting on. What's this? My pathetic attempt at an apology. I plead temporary insanity. It doesn't take a genius to see that you and Chloe still have feelings for each other. Lana, Chloe and I are just friends. Obviously closer friends than we are. Lana, that's not true. Clark, you can't lie to me about something I saw with my own eyes. For once, just be honest with yourself. I know why Chloe was kissing you. But why were you kissing her back? I have to lock up. Subtitle by:
