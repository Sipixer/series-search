is in Clun. It's not far and he'll be here soon. But the good news is I, me, Lucky George, I'm here with you in Locksley. Now, I will give you good hard cash for any jewelry, trinkets, anything of value, I will turn to pennies. Those pennies will pay the taxman and that will keep you out of the Sheriff's jail. So help me to help you. Be lucky, come to Lucky George. We should have gone round, I hate these woods. This, my friends, is an ambush. Come to exchange some valuables for cash? Lucky George loves a deal. A deal with the Sheriff? Oh, now why would you say that? I'm sorry, George, your luck's run out. I'm closing down your business. With my sword at your throat? I don't think so! - Call your men off. - No, I don't think so. You're surrounded. Ah, keep your hands up! If that's what you want... Oi, come here! Now, look, lads. Only joking. Let's see if he's lucky enough to make his own way home. Take everything. We are putting this parasite out of business. Synched and adapted by ScarHand EPISODE 7 "BROTHER IN ARMS" Oi, stop! Megan, what are you doing? We're giving these a good horse whipping. Why? Said they were thatchers. Said they'd fix the hole on the roof, then they stole this. Me mother gave it to me on my wedding day. It's the only thing of value I own. Lucky George offered me thruppence but I'd never sell. You touch us and you'll be in big trouble! We are Robin Hood's men! - Maybe if you try wearing a dress? - I will if you will. Robin Hood could swing out of these trees any time and bash your brains out. - Or are you afraid of looking too pretty. - I know that voice. Oh, surely Robin Hood couldn't take on all of us? Robin Hood wouldn't be scared of you. You're girls compared to him and his men. - Tom? - Allan! - You know him? - He's my brother. Thank heavens you're here. My purse? My sword? My horse? I can explain. My nose ! What kind of thing is that to do to your brother! Is this broken? I say whip him to within an inch of his life. If you touch me again Robin Hood will string you up from the tallest oak in Sherwood forest! This is Robin Hood, you idiot! We beg your forgiveness, Robin of Locksley. We are humble thatchers. Times are hard, we had to thieve or else face starvation. My friends here, I have to look after them. Don't believe a word. Please! Have a heart. Help us out here. We'll work for you. We could join your band of worthy outlaws. - What do you two have to say? - They can't speak, Lord. They've had their tongues cut out. Why? For praising your work. They were overheard. Let them go. You have your necklace. We are not the Sheriff, we do not horse-whip thieves. - Are you really thatchers? - Course. The finest in all England. You shall have a new roof! Free of charge. By the way, I found some lost property in the forest. Anyone lost any valuables recently? Take what is yours. Courtesy of Lucky George. If I'd known I would've sold this necklace this morning. I think we could be useful to you. See, did you notice? If I can steal something from under the nose of the great Robin Hood, think what I can achieve of mere mortals, eh? Allan? He's an excellent pickpocket. He's got a big mouth, I know, but his heart is in the right place. And he's your brother. If you had a brother who'd done something wrong, you'd give him a chance, wouldn't you? Thank you, Robin. You will not regret it. You will earn these tags. You are on probation. Why are you still standing there? This woman's roof. - Get to it. - Go on! I'll keep an eye on him. My necklace is now yours, Eleri. - <i>These two wanted to see you, sir.</i> - I'm late as it is. What do you want? We seek your blessing and permission to marry, my lord. And what are you prepared to pay for my blessing and permission? Come closer. Just you. Nice. This? My mother gave it to us as a token on our engagement. It's the only thing of value I have in my family. That'll do nicely. Turn around. It's an outrage! An innocent man robbed... ...whilst going about his legitimate business! - I need more guards. - Out of the question. You shall have them. About half a dozen should do. Oh, I need a new carriage an' all. Of course. See to it, Gisborne. The man's worth his weight in gold. Hm? He makes a profit, we get our taxes. It's good. A public-private-partnership. What happened, Gisborne? Robin Hood must have known George's whereabouts. Only once, once, he risked the forest and immediately he's robbed. Coincidence? Clue: no. Hood knows more about our business than we do. The question is... how? - I don't know. - Well, I do. We have a spy amongst us. And do you know what we have to do to catch a spy? - No. - I do. I set a trap. Or rather, you set a trap. That's it. That's the lot. Where 's Lucky George's money? Where 's the coins? We searched his pockets. Nothing. - How can he trade if he has no money? - Maybe he spent it all? That's unlikely. Thing is... I woke up and we'd both been robbed. And rather than wake you I went off to catch the thieves myself. I chased them for days... Couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it. - Runs in the family, then. - Don't make us gang up on you. - Is he disrespecting our family? - You rob each other in your family! My flask. Where 's my flask? I put it there, where is it? Sorry! Old habits... The old gang back together. How did they lose their tongues? No lies. For spitting at some guards. It'll be different this time. I won't let you down again. I promise. - Do you like it? - Yes, I do but... It's simple silver. You have no need of gold or gaudy jewels. But really. I cannot accept it. Why not? Have I insulted you? You do not like it. It's too plain, too simple. Take it off. No, l-I like it. I will treasure it. - It is a gift of friendship. - And I am very grateful. You wanted to see me, sir? Cancel the guard for the consignment from Rotherham. - No guards? - No guards. Guards attract attention. Why would we want to attract attention... - to a chest full of silver traveling through Sherwood Forest? Yes, sir. And tell no one. No one. - Not even the guards themselves. - Yes, sir. Good morning, Nettlestone! Look at that! 'Ey, you know me. Come to Lucky, Lucky George. I know you... I thought we had put him out of business! Look at this. - Where does he get his money from? - They sell everything. Why? Word 's got round. Robin will return their goods, just like he did before. I tell you what. I will give you, for that... I wish you no harm. But I will relieve you of your valuables. Sorry. I thought you were a rich noblewoman... ...looking to donate your fancy jewels to a good cause. You knew it was me. You shouldn't be riding alone through the forest. There are some very unsavory characters about. Outlaws, you know. - What's this? - Don't touch. It's very pretty. Have I seen it before? - No. It was a gift. - From whom? Does it matter? I should be going. I don't know. Does it? No. - Gisborne. - What? - Just a guess. Am I right? - As it happens. - Interesting. - Why interesting? I have seen it before. Around the neck of a young girl from Locksley. It was given to her by her mother. - Yes, and? - And here it is around your neck. Gisborne stole it from the girl? I can't imagine she gave it to him willingly. But it's not like you stole it from the poor girl yourself. And you obviously like it. And it is certainly a special and thoughtful gift from a man that clearly means a lot to you. - Take it back to the girl. - Gladly. - What will you say to Gisborne? - Ask her not to wear it in public. He will never know. Keep the necklace. - I can find her another. - It was a gift from her mother. Take it. I can handle Gisborne. It's time we got to work, boys. Let's hit the road. - Why did you go to Gisborne? - He is our master now. And what about this? He took it as his fee for our wedding. How did you... Doesn't matter. You still want to marry? - Well, then let me marry you. - Does that count? Of course it does. And I am much cheaper than Gisborne. Here, you should be getting back. Thank you, Robin. - Lucky George? - Nettlestone. More guards. And a new carriage. - So, he is engaged with the Sheriff. - The villagers are all giving him their stuff. Cheap, because they think you'll give everything back. First thing in the morning we find him and take his toys away. - For good. - Robin. I've lost my brother. It's a big forest. - They must have gone east. - He didn't tell me where he was off to though. I've got a bad feeling about this. Fetch the horses. East is towards Knighton. Knighton House Nice house means rich pickings. Come on. Round the back. ...and the daughter of this house. Get away from here! Stop! What is going on? Thank goodness you're here. This is Robin Hood, you're in big trouble! What are you doing? I am so sorry. These men were robbing my house! Yes. We're robbing his house! That's what we do! We were trying to show the top man what we can do! These people are our friends! Now you tell me! - I thought they were... - You don't think! You can't think! - Are you hurt? - Only my pride. These are your men? Not for much longer. I promise. Apologize! Apologize for the disturbance. Now! Do as you're told. - Sorry. - Louder. - Sorry! - I knew nothing about this. They will be punished, you have my word. - Robin, I'm so sorry... - Just take them away! There 's a consignment of silver coming down the Great North Road. I was on my way to intercept it. - You? - Yes, me. It is unguarded so as not to attract attention. A simple cart. And how do you know this? Another present from Gisborne? Look, I need to stay with my father. If you want it you must hurry. Thank you. Much, the North Road. Sorry about that. We arrived as quickly as we could! A decoy. What's the Sheriff up to now? Well, it looks like we've all had a wasted journey. Well done, Gisborne. Hood wanted silver. Instead he got this. So... ...who did you tell? My sergeant. Anyone else? No. You're sure? Only my sergeant. It must be him. Make him suffer. Oh, I will. You know I agreed you should make up with your brother? - Yeah? - I've changed my mind. He was trying to impress you. And he didn't realize who he was robbing. It's a big house. He doesn't think. Anyway, you don't have to trust them, just me. - I should have kept an eye on him. - Yes. You should have. Look, when have I ever asked you for anything? All right, apart from saving my life. He has made a lot of mistakes. I know, I tried to help him. Look, I was like him once. Out of control. But I've changed... Because of you. Because of being here. - If you could give him a second chance... - He's had a second chance. But if he was with us. With decent men. He could change. If I take control, properly... ...you won't have to worry about him. Please? One more chance? He stole from you. And you still defend him. He's my brother. - One more chance. - Thank you. Last chance. Do you understand? All right. Get up! Get up! - They've gone. - And they've taken everything. - Clothes, money, horses. - Everything. I will kill him. I'm gonna kill him. Bury him, dig him up and kill him again! In the name of Robin Hood, hand over the money and we won't harm you. Don't even think about it. There are six guards relieving themselves in the forest behind you. - Do you expect me to believe that? - Turn around, see for yourself. Do I look like I was born yesterday? They're to hang. They have lied to us, stolen from us. - They're nothing but trouble. - Let them hang. I agree. You do? My brother had more chances than he deserved. Does he deserve to die? Do we? If we go to Nottingham we'll end up joining him on the scaffold. They took some of our tags. The Sheriff's crowing. Thinks he's got Robin Hood's men. Now it's like he's daring us to rescue them. My brother was never part of this gang, was he? We trusted them and they let us down. That's it. We'd be fools to walk into a trap for them. Does anyone disagree with me? - What do you want? - To talk. - So talk. Ah! You can talk from there. - What? - Nothing. - You were looking at me. - That's just the way my eyes were pointing. I'm sorry about yesterday. How's your father? - I hear your men are going to hang. - They're not my men. They were your men last night. The Sheriff is hanging them in my name, hoping I'll turn up to rescue them. But my men think it's a trap. Has your good friend Guy of Gisborne said anything to you? I think he was a little preoccupied. But I will go to the castle to see what I can find out. If I do not rescue them, people will think I cannot protect my men. Do I risk us all to save them? You are a good man, Robin. Nothing will change that. That won't help you make your decision. - It might. - It won't. - Marian. - Sir Guy. So you did not like it after all? - The necklace. - No, I do. It's at home. You didn't think to wear it? It is very precious to me. I would not want to lose it. Come away. This is not for your ears. What is it? Do you know the worst crime a man can commit? Murder? Betrayal. My sergeant swore loyalty to me and then he stabbed me in the back. - He hasn't admitted it yet but he will. - Admit what? We set a trap to flush out a spy. An unguarded cart. Someone told Robin Hood. But what if it wasn't him? - My sergeant was the only one that knew. He was the only one I told. - Please, Sir Guy, do not do this. You understand loyalty? The importance of loyalty? - Yes, I do. But... - So... He must pay for his crime. - Yes, but did Marian say it was a trap? - She didn't know. Well, then we cannot go. We cannot risk our own lives for three worthless rascals. We're going to Nottingham. I'll see you there. Master, surely... - Why are we... - For family. For Allan's brother. We do not let the Sheriff hang our family, no matter how unreliable they may be. Robin... - God bless you, my friend. - Don't mention it, my friend. Bring the girl. - Oh, the bride. - Yes, my lord? Lower your collar. - Where did you get this? - My mother gave it to me. And I took it from you. How did you get it back? Robin Hood gave it to me. Let's have a look. I'll give you a ha'penny for it. Keep it. It means nothing to me. Lucky Lucky George! - I've been betrayed. - Again? Hm! Making a habit of it, aren't you? Not again. I was wrong. My sergeant died an innocent man. Well, I'm sure he was guilty of something. It was Marian. I have the proof. Marian? Am I surprised? Clue: no. It's always the girl. I told you. Women. Lepers. Aww, you're really hurt, hmm? Can you feel the hot metal of the knife twisting in your back, hm? All the time she was smiling at you, but really she was laughing at you, betraying you, despising you, humiliating you. And what do you want to do to her now? Go. And enjoy it. In there. Yeah. That's the lot that tried to rob me. Have pity on us. - Get off me! This was clean on! Robin will save us. He'll be here! Oh, no, he won't! What are you doing? I must speak to Robin. Why? What's happened? Lord Gisborne took the necklace from me and made me tell him... Kiss me. Sorry. Much! Tell me what happened. We have a problem. We have many problems, most of them guard -shaped. Come on. Remember the necklace? Lucky George has got it. And Gisborne knows you gave it to Eleri. - What? How? - She was scared out of her wits. We rescue Tom and then we warn Marian. Now, get the uniforms, come on. All those eager faces. You're all expecting Robin Hood to turn up, aren't you? Hm? Do a few tricks with his bow and arrow? Well, this is no time for schoolboy tricks. This is justice. We have laws. Robin Hood has no respect for the law. Robin Hood flouts the law. He would have us all be criminals. Murdering and stealing. And yet still, you wait here expecting him to come and save one of his own. Yes, of course you do. Which is why... I have brought the hanging forward by one hour. Look up there! You're too late, Robin Hood! Your men are already dead! Ooh, I wish you could have seen the look on their faces just before they realized that you weren't coming to rescue them. Oh, it was very moving. First there was... disappointment... tinged with confusion, soon to be replaced by anger, and then tears, just before they realized that it was the final, fatal drop. It was very moving, very touching. Yes! I wish you could have seen that, Hood! Well, thank you very much. Oh, will one of you tell Robin Hood if you do see him? Thank you. Eager, smiling faces. Good. All in a day's work. Ha! Ha! Sheriff coming through! Robin. Marian? You have come for the belongings of the hanged man. Tom A Dale. You are his cousin. Bring them here quickly! Gisborne knows you gave me the necklace. He knows you betrayed him. You are in grave danger. No... I will get it back for you. He'll be leaving for Knighton Hall now. - My father. - Wait for me. I can't leave him. Marian, you cannot go home now. It is too dangerous. He is weak already, he cannot defend himself if... Marian, look at me. Look at me. Give me time. I will get you the necklace. Will, go and find Allan and Djaq. We need to find Lucky George. He has to be here. What do you want? Maybe some salt? Where 's Marian? Good question. If you've hurt her... f you've done anything to her... You'll what? - Speak of the devil. - Sir Guy. We were not expecting you. I know. Sorry. I just popped in for a little chat. - Where have you been? - At the hanging. Can we get you something to drink? I don't think so. - Show me your necklace. - What necklace? If I may say, Sir Guy... Show me your necklace. Robin is looking for you. - I'm sorry. - Give us a moment. I had a brother. A twin. He was killed in your Crusades. I became him. His name was Djaq. He still lives here, inside me. Like your brother lives inside you. That's what I worry about. Don't you want to take a look? Look at what? A sack of rags. It's not much to show for a life. - You would have me prove my innocence? - Show me the necklace. - Have I committed a crime? - Show me the necklace. I will not. This is the end of our friendship. How can I be friends with someone who demands... ...I prove my innocence without stating my crime? You betrayed me to Robin Hood. You gave him the necklace. You told him of my plan. And now you will pay the price. - You have no proof. - And you have no necklace. - It is upstairs. - No, it's not. - It is in my bedchamber. I will fetch it for you. - Don't waste my time. Please. Let me prove myself to you. Driver! Why are we stopping? What is it this time? The necklace Gisborne gave you. - What, er, silver? Celtic design? - Yes. Never seen it. One chance. Give us the necklace or we kill you and search your goods ourselves. This is no game. Erm, er, look, just leave me the money and I'll give you the necklace. Give us the necklace first. Er, right. Um... It's gone. No, no, no, I swear. I had it but it's gone! - Master, if we don't have... - I know! What do we do? - I found Allan and Djaq. They found... - Something you might be interested in. I have to get this to Marian. You are lucky. Take everything. And this time I mean everything. Trying to make it look like a robbery? Oh, my! Robin Hood's broken in and stolen the necklace! - I thought we were friends. - So did I. The only reason you paid me any attention was to feed information to my enemy. - That's not true. - Why persist with lies? You're dead anyway. Do you still not have the courage to tell me the truth? The truth? The truth is, this country is being choked to death. The truth is, honest people are being forced to lie and cheat and steal. And if you really want the truth, then you should know that I... What? I have something to show you. It's not possible. Feel it. It is real. And you owe me an apology. I'm sorry. I was wrong. Marian, I told the Sheriff that you betrayed us. Tell him you were mistaken. He's expecting news of your arrest. Show him the necklace. No necklace will persuade the Sheriff. How could he trust you after this? I cannot protect you. You must. It is proof. You have already defied the Sheriff once. Suspicion will cling to you and your father. You must prove your loyalty beyond all doubt. Marry me. It's the only way. As Lady Gisborne I could protect you. What do you say? You leave me no time to think. A moment ago you'd have me hanged and now you want to marry me? - Is it so difficult to prove your loyalty? - I am loyal but... But what? - I know you were once betrothed to Robin Hood. - I was a girl then. Would you still hesitate if he were asking the question? I would never marry him. I despise Robin Hood. Really? So what about me? Will you... marry... me? Yes. I will marry you. I will marry you the day King Richard returns to England. Shall we go downstairs and tell my father the good news? Yes. I have an apology to make. Sorry! I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. A gift. From Lucky George. Thank you. For everything.
