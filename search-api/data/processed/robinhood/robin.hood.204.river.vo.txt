- We are the poor! - Let them take what they need, Lukey. Dad? - Dad! - It's me! Will, you know these people? I'd like you to meet my father Dan Scarlett and my little brother Lukey. - I'm not little! - My big little brother, Lukey. - So what brings you back to Nottingham? - We've come to take Will - back to Scarborough with us. - What? How about asking me if I want to come? We're your family. Your Auntie Annie and us. - I've got a family here too, Dad. - We were sure you'd come and find us. - Didn't you miss us? - Yes. But... I'm with Robin now. "I'm with Robin now"?! Son, you've got your whole life ahead of you. What's that? It's a letter. Yeah, to who? It's to the King. - What about? - The Sheriff and the Black Knights. - Who's delivering it? - An old friend. Roger of Stoke. Roger. - Where are you meeting him? - How many questions have you got Allan? All right! I'm just curious. I'm meeting him in Nottingham after the money drop. - This craftsmanship is good. - See? I've got a life here. What that says to me, is you could earn a decent living in Scarborough. Dad, I'm an outlaw. I stand up for what I believe in. - What? And I don't? - It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. Tell me. - You let the Sheriff cut off your hand! - That was to save me and you! - I didn't mean that. - Yes, you did. Robin, can you tell my father I'm a grown man now. I make my own decisions. A real man listens to advice, Will. Thanks, Robin. But Will does have a life here. And you should see it before you take him away from it. Come to Nottingham tomorrow - Let me show you what we do. Look it's him. Jess, it is the Nightwatchman. Let's see, what does he bring? God bless you, Nightwatchman. And that night, the Angel of the Lord went back and forth... Ah! The Nightwatchman. So how was your evening's... generosity? Very satisfying. They all took the bait, like rats. Good. Shouldn't you be... measuring or whatever it is that you do? - Scientific analysis. - Right. I am waiting to be accidentally caught in the quarantine. Yes... The ermm... Off you go. Please! Please Jailer, let me see my father! - Can't be done. I've told you. - Marian! - I am well. - I will speak to the Sheriff. - Do not worry. - Speak away, my dear. Sheriff... this punishment hurts my father, not me. Oh, I don't know. I think it hurts you both. It is efficient. It'll make you think before you undermine my authority again. Which, trust me, is in your best interests. Please! Please! Sheriff. There must be something I can do. Guy!? It's no good making those big eyes at him, he doesn't want you any more. Tell you what, you read this announcement for me, and we'll see if we can get daddy some dinner. You mean you haven't fed him!? Sheriff? - Right, time to spread a bit of... - Happiness? Happiness! Yes, that's right. Time to spread a bit of happiness. Bless you... See, these people need us. We need you too. You're family. Help me, somebody please, help me! Robin... Robin, help! It's Jess. She's got something! I think it's the pestilence! Will, get Djaq. There's no swellings. How long has she been like this? Just since this morning. Toot toot... - People of Nottingham. - Louder. - People of Nottingham! - Good. On behalf of the Sheriff... I make the following announcement. The pestilence has come to Nottingham. My God, Jess. That's what it is. No, it's not. Do not be afraid. It is confined to the houses in Pitt Street. There will be a quarantine placed around the street. No-one is to pass through without permission. No-one is to pass food or medicine... What? There's young ones suffering. They can't be cut off with nothing. To do so... risk is spreading the infection, and will be punished by death. What are we going to do? She's going to die! No, she isn't. That's not what she's got. Sarah. Take Jess home. Djaq and I will come soon. Be careful. We will not be cowed by this infection. Business will continue as normal. - <i>Report to the castle for duty...</i> - What's Marian's game? - She's just doing as she's told. - ... at the usual hour. Now, you may hear cries for help. Please for mercy. Medicine. Help me! Help me! Help me! A word of advice. Go forth... in peace... - Robin! We've got to stop him! - <i>Iove...</i> - He condemns a whole street to death. - <i>... and serve your Sheriff.</i> Sheriff! This is not right! Dan! Dan! What? I've just had a look at young lass and it's not the pestilence. Get that man shut up. I've seen the pestilence before, in Scarborough. These people must have food and water, and medicines. I said SHUT UP! I've shut up for you once before, Sheriff. It's cost me my wife, my hand and the respect of my son. So I'm not shutting up any more. Now why are you saying this is the pestilence... Well, done! Hysteria. Panic. In times of crisis, not very helpful. It will not be tolerated! Will, you can't go up there! - I'm going to kill him. - You heard the Sheriff. Set up those barricades! - There's too many of them, Will. - It'd be suicide. - I don't care! - Will! - We need to go to Pitt Street. - Pitt Street, why? There are people there. Our people. And they need us. - Djaq? - Of course. Robin! The pestilence. I'm not sure either, to be honest. I think Dan was right. There is no pestilence. That's why the Sheriff killed him. - You think?! - No, no! Help We haven't got time for this. They're setting the barricades up right now. Help! Please help us. Hey listen! I tell you what, I'll do the letter for whatshisname... Roger of Stoke. Good thinking. Here, go on. The rest of you, I can't ask you to risk your life. But if you do come with me, then do it for Dan. Now come on. Will, Pitt Street, the back way. Now! Put your backs into it! Let me through. I do not live here. I was just only walking this way. I'm from Leicester. Sheriff's orders. This has got nothing to do with me! Don't do this! - Don't do this! My Jess needs help! - Sarah! Robin. Oh, no, you can't be here. - You'll never get out. - I said I'd come and find you. - Take us to your daughter. - Come on. Let's see what we can do. She needs water, lots of water. Are there many other people affected? Half the houses on the street. Right. I want beds. Clean linens. All... All in one place. Go. And all the herbs and medicines from every house brought here to Djaq. Hey, hey. Luke... - Luke. Your dad wouldn't want this. - How do you know what he'd want? - We should kill the Sheriff... - We can't just kill the Sheriff. Prince John would send an army to destroy Nottingham. - It would create hell. - Robin, I want to take him home. To Scarborough. Our Auntie Annie. - If you need us here... - No. No, take him. And when you return, we'll honour your father. Thank you. Where's Sarah? Don't you know? She lives in Pitt Street. Is she affected? Little Jess. Right. We must get them medicine. And I need your clothes. I'm sorry, Will. Me too, Robin. Really sorry. We need to take food as well. No need, Miss. They're all fed. The Nightwatchman visited last night, at Pitt Street. Don't come in. - Marian? - You can't come in. I cannot talk to you through the door. Well, then you can't talk to me at all. I just wanted to apologise... for what happened today... the way the Sheriff treated you. Am I to perform like a monkey, whilst my father starves in the dungeon? No... I will see to it that your father is properly fed. Really? And what do you want in return? Nothing. You have my word. Then thank you. Marian, please... Let me in. - The Nightwatchman went to Pitt Street? - Yes. Hello? It's Robin Hood. Do you have any medicines or herbs you could give me? Robin, please go away. We have the pestilence here, save yourself. - What are you doing? - I'm helping the sick. Leave them alone! I mean... You could die. That's a risk I take every day. No, you're right, forgive me. Let me help. - What's your name? - Joseph. I'm here by mistake. You're from Leicester, I heard. Did you see the way those men treated me? Godless. Welcome to Nottingham. Robin? These men are with me. Can you help them? - These people are burning up! - You know, perhaps it would be a kindness just not to interfere, not prolong their pain. This is a medicine chest! Every medicine known to man. And some unknown. - Oh, don't do that! - Why not? I'm a man, you're a woman. - I fall in love very easily. - Don't worry, I don't. Let me get down first, make sure it's safe. I know what to look for, better than you do. Why do you always treat me like I'm a baby? I loved you, Luke. See? Your turn. - Will? - Run away, Luke. Run back to Scarborough. This place is about to turn into hell. Will? Will! Will! - She'll not die, will she? - Not if I can help it. And you are from the fourth house on the street? And your husband ate a large pie last night, nothing since? That's right. - Good. - Good? She is hotter. Look at the cheeks, the lips. - Are you trained in medicine? - Me? No. I'm just... just hoping this poor child recovers. Don't go! Stand, or you're dead. - A shame. - A shame? It's an outrage. That's another life wasted. - You suspect foul play? - Joseph... Joseph, this is Nottingham. There is no other kind of play! Will, you scared me! What are you doing here, do you have a message from Robin? Will. Will? So... You're all from different families and you haven't eaten together... We've all eaten the pies though. Our Jess ate ours. - How much did she have? - What pies? The Nightwatchman's. He brought them all last night. Every house in the street. Soup. I'll make everybody some soup. They're all dropping like flies, my Lord. The poison's lethal! Can't let it fall into the wrong hands, eh? I'm thinking of getting a food taster, Gisborne... with all this tasteless poison around. - What do you think? - Good idea. Maybe I'll eat half an hour after you do. What have you got for me? What's the matter? A conscience? How much for this? It depends what this is. This is a letter to King Richard from Robin. Telling him all about you and the Sheriff and the Black Knights. Game will be ugly, Gisborne. Give me that. I can't. I told Robin I'd give it to Roger of Stoke, - who's coming to take it to the King. - So what's your proposal? I'll give it to him, then I'm clean. You can arrest him after I've gone, somewhere out of town. I don't know anything about it. Good, you're learning, Allan. Hey. Stop! I have seen you! No, you haven't. You should come and eat. Keep our strength up. - All right. - Thanks, Joseph. Robin! - Marian. What are you doing here? - Someone's impersonating me. I know. - I think he's given out poisoned pies. - What? - In my name?! - It's the Sheriff's doing. - But why? - No idea. He wants to damage the Nightwatchman's reputation? Then he'd blame him. And he hasn't. I need to see if Jess is all right. Smells good. Are you a cook? - No, I'm a man of science. - What sort of science? The science of elimination. - What's that? - Finding ways to get rid of dirt. Have you noticed, there's dirt everywhere? We have to get rid of it. And there are people who will make the necessary difficult decisions. Who don't need to be popular. You need to talk to the Sheriff. He doesn't need to be popular. With the right tool, we can clean this country, create a new England. You should definitely talk to the Sheriff. Food! Food. I'll take over. You organised this? We had hospitals in the Holy Land. I thought it'd be the last time I'd see them. How did you know there wasn't some infectious disease? I didn't. That's brave. How did you know? I didn't. Robin? Are you eating? - In a moment. The others can start. - No! I need you! I mean... you should eat. I'll be there in a moment. Robin! Robin! I know that man. I have seen him before in the castle! He's advising the Sheriff. And the Lord said, "Take, eat," "do this in memory of me". You make it sound like the Last Supper! - Robin! - This is the last supper... - for you, Joseph. - You poison people, then keep a record of their suffering! What? That is revolting! My poison has no taste... no colour, no odour. It's a beautiful thing. What's the cure for the poison? There are people out there dying! Children! It's made from an extract of the amanita mushroom. The Angel of Death. The Devil's Cap. There is no cure! - <i>Stop him!</i> - Open the gate! Stop him! It's me! Let me through, it's me! Stop him! - They knew him! - He tricked us. - Clever. - Clever? He nearly poisoned us. What about these people? Belladonna. Bella what? Belladonna. - For mushroom poisoning. - Belladonna is deadly nightshade. - It is a poison. - It works. - Woodsman's remedy. - A poison to fight a poison. Djaq? Djaq? It's Jess, I think she's going. - What's that? - It's a hunch. - But it could kill her. - Whose hunch? Mine. Here. Trust me. Let me do this. She's going anyway. Just try it, just try it. Jess! No... No. Jess! It's working! It's working! I think it is! It is working. Amazing! - How did you know that? - I know some things. We have to stop Joseph before he poisons anybody else. He'll have gone into the castle. We must find a way to get in after him. - How did Will get in? - Will? He's in the castle. Didn't you know? Oh, no... - What's going on? - He's going to kill the Sheriff. Doesn't he know Prince John would destroy Nottingham? - He knows, but... - The man the Sheriff killed... was Will's father. Roger? Where's Robin? He couldn't make it. But he gave me this for you. - God Save The King. - Yeah. And the rest of us. Success with the pitiful of Pitt Street? Oh, yes. Even those who hardly touched the food are in agony. And those who ate the full dose have begun to die, as I predicted. Very good. Well done, thank you, goodbye. Pardon? You can go now, back to wherever it was that you came from. You'll be paid, don't worry. But the application of my invention... To rid the country of the weak and the dirty, the parasites. My dear boy, those are the ones who do exactly what I tell them to. We need those. No. Your poison will be used on the King's army when they land on the south coast. But that's not what we agreed. Yes, yes, I know. And life is usually so much fairer. Come to Daddy! Nobody passes. Master Joseph asked us to bring the body to the castle. - What for? - He didn't say. What, d'you want to take it? Enter! I will not let you use my poison! Well, I'm surprised to hear you say that. A clue... Luckily, I managed to commandeer your meticulous records. - You used me. - Yes, I used you. Don't fuss about it. I like you. If I didn't, well I could make you drink from your own cup, so to speak. So, chin chin. Ermmm... You, you... boy, don't I know you? You knew my dad, Dan. He's dead now. Oh, really? Well, here's to your dearly departed dead dad Dan. Come along, Joey boy, drink up. And then get lost - otherwise I might change my mind. To dead Dan! Raise the gate! Body for Master Joseph! - What's happening? - Will's in here. - And he wants to kill the Sheriff. - And the Sheriff has hired a poisoner. - Did you see Roger of Stoke? - Yeah. I gave him your letter. Good. Good work. John, Allan, you go down that way. What do we do if he doesn't come quietly? - You make him. - What if he won't? Whatever it takes, Much. Whatever it takes? - Whatever it takes. - We kill one of our own? Well, let's hope we have a choice. Help... - Will. - Robin... Help... We were poisoned... Well, according to your friend here, there is no cure. So, you're going to die. No! I cannot die! I am too young. I haven't finished yet. Dan Scarlett hadn't finished either when you killed him this morning. Him! Dead Dan!? The father? I'm going to die because of a complete nonentity? And life is usually so much fairer. - Why, Sheriff? - Operation Shah Mat. The King's Army. You should approve. We win without any bloodshed! Well, you're not winning now, are you? If, by the slightest chance... I happened to have a cure would you give up Shah Mat? No. No! And there is no cure! SHUT UP! Yes. Yes! Yes, Robin. Yes, yes! - Don't die before I get back. - No... Will! Tell me you haven't done anything stupid. - Stupid? - To the Sheriff. I haven't touched him. It's not pestilence, it's a poison. And we have a cure! It's Little John's idea! - That's good. - You're not happy? The sick are getting better! What are you doing? My dad isn't getting better! Don't do this... Where's Djaq? We split up. - Will has poisoned the Sheriff. - What? And Djaq's got the remedy. Will! I know what you've done. I've done the right thing, that's what I've done. Justice in a bottle. - Djaq has the remedy. - I know. She told me. Where is she, Will? - What have you done with her? - I've stood up to the Sheriff. That's what we all should have done a long time ago. - Even if all of Nottingham dies? - That's not my fault. - No, Master no! - Robin! - Robin! - You want to watch people die, - you can start with me. - Robin! I can't let the Sheriff live. - Yes, you can! - My dad. He did it for me. He stood up to the Sheriff to prove himself to me! Then prove yourself to him. Show that we are stronger men than the Sheriff. Will! - Will, come on! - Robin, why did you have to do this? To prove my point. Will Scarlett still believes in the right thing. Will, please... Will, do this. I'll take you to her. Go, go to the Sheriff's quarters, go. I'll see you there. Who's that? What are you doing? Come on! Nothing like the taste of your own medicine, is there? And you... have an announcement to make. People of Nottingham! There is no pestilence. This was poison. An experiment for which I'm... - truly, truly sorry. - Shah Mat... I can't, I'm too weak. - Robin! - Djaq, the remedy. Quick. Will, this is your call. Prove to me Will Scarlett believes in doing the right thing. - You didn't drink the poison, did you? - No. But I think my point still stands so... Yes, yes, it does. This is to the memory of my good father, Dan Scarlett and the people of Nottingham. He can't be dead. This is getting weird now. I want him to live and I don't want him to live. Come on! Just joshing. Finish the speech. Oh, I don't think so. I've had the remedy. Guards! Guards! Go, go! Robin Hood! Kill him! Then he looked and saw the angel of death standing between heaven and earth. Joseph, there's a cure. I can give you the antidote. I was going to be remembered for a thousand years. The creator of the perfect poison. - There cannot be an antidote. - There is an antidote. - And any woodsman would know it. - No... Good. Give me your hand. Get him! Stop him! - It's good to have you back, Lukey. - Are you ready for this? What's he doing up there? I thought you said Will was gonna build something to remind you of your father. He is. - Wait for the light. - The light? It is light. Any second... Now. Dan... That is... Beautiful. He was a good man. Yep. He was. - He's been tipped off. - By who? - Henry of Lewes. - Why did you let the messenger through? - I think I have a spy in my gang. - Bring her medicines. The Sheriff wants your services. If she lays one finger on my patient... I can't let him live to speak his treason. The Sheriff knows she helped.
