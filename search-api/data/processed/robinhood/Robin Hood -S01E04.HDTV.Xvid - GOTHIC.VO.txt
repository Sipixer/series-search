"PARENT HOOD" - Good idea, Roy! - Do we like it? I bet we do ! Fantastic. Roy ! - Yeah, very funny. - Very funny ! See, do you mind here, I gotta keep the nag, right ? A nag? This is a destrier warhorse of the finest pedigree. Of course my friend ! You deserve it ! Much? Much, do not be so easily wounded. - Oh, you have it then if you're gonna cry about it. - I am not crying ! What is it? I mean... I know what it is but... It's a boy. We rode straight past it, we could've trampled it. Where is its mother ? This baby is cold. The mother is long gone. Can you stop him crying? Yeah, yeah. What? That's how you shut'em up. Come on, leave him, let's go. You can't just leave a baby. Whatcha gonna do with it? We're outlaws, not wet nurses. How did you do that? You ask me... He's lucky to be alive. There're hoofprints everywhere. No noise, no movement. What is it? Look at these hoofprints. They're marked. Gisborne is not the fool he looks like. He'll track us. That's clever. You've gotta admit. You didn't think of that, did you? I'm not being funny, shouldn't we be moving on? He could be gone already. He could be here already. Master, what do we do? What can we do? We do not believe in harming man or beast. What? Vermin, on the other hand... Do you mind...? ... I'm trying to get the baby to sleep.... Catch ! Robin ! Roy ! They got Roy. The horses were marked. They tracked us. It's a baby. John, I'm so sorry. We're going to Nottingham. Good news from the village Clun, no new outbreaks for a fortnight. The pestilence, whatever it was, is gone. Then we can lift the quarantaine. Feed the survivors. Well the people of Clun, they are a grubby people... The great unwashed... Low on taxes, high on moaning. Quarantaine remains... They must be fed, they will die. Marianne... Oh.... sweet... My dear, you have to understand. These are incapable people. They do not look after themselves. we must not... we can not.... ... nanny them.... But how can they look after themselves if we would not allow them to leave their village? I agree... This is a conundrum. Another conundrum is this... Whom do I tax... ... to pay for the food... ...for the hopeless Clun? Mmh? Do I rob from Peter to pay for Paul? Simpler to keep the quarantaine in place and then... ... after one or two weeks, we say the village has been... ... cleansed. I may house my garrison there You cannot let healthy people die, it is barbaric ! - If it became known that we have delib... - ... Interesting... mmh? This fire in your belly... Is this reason talking? Or... Is it frustration? Frustration of being... how old now.... and... ... still a maiden... Excuse me. I have other business. My name is Royston White. I fight for Robin Hood. And King Richard... My name is Royston White... I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard. It would be wise, would it not, to break his jaw after he has talked? Rather than before. Who is he? His associates... ...raided my stables. Unfortunately for them, I had my horses shod with an identifying mark which enabled me to track them down. Talk. My name is Royston White. I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard. I'll say no more. Oh, you've said enough. You must have had a very difficult day. What? Let our friend rest. What's happenin' here? He'll not talk, I can assure you. Unless he's beaten. First, find out if he's got any relatives in Nottingham. Bring him back quickly. Did... did he cry? - What's your name? - Annie. Why did you smile at him, Annie? He has another side. The side he cannot show. You're wrong. Be careful. I have position, I would be his wife. He tell you that, did he? I'm the mother of his child. Well, you look what he did to me? Don't let him anywhere near your child. Shut up. He's a good man. He found a good home for my baby, the abbey of Kirklees That is not cheap. It will cost money. Whatcha wanna do with it? We're outlaws, not wet nurses. Central Courtyard, portcullis, all heavily manned. The East wall, where the builders are working. Teemin'. - How about the South wall? - Too high. Look, even if we do get in, I've heard the new door to the dungeon' two foot thick? I heard about the door too. But I also heard that Robert of York put it in. And...? Well, Robert of York can't make a hinge to save his life. The locked side would be strong as an ox, but the hinge side would be weak. Especially with the weight of two feet timber. - What's your baby called? - None of your business. Seth. A few weeks old, got a velvet shawl? Yes... how....? Did you meet him on the way to the abbey? Sort of... The sheriff wants to see you. Why is the point of us all dying? "For every man there is a purpose which he sets up in his life". Let yours be the doing of all good deeds That's us, lads. Is that the Bible...? It's the Koran. What's that? It's the Turk Bible. He read it in the Holy Land. Why? I wanted to know what it was that we were fighting. "Royston White." "I fight for King and Country." Mmh? Blahdiblahdiblah. Now look, I'll be blunt... I've a favor to ask. I would be very grateful if you would... ... use this on our mutual friend, Robin Hood. I'd sooner kill mey own mother. Yes... what an amazing coincidence... See, when people says things like "I'd sooner kill mey own mother"... ...then they don't usually have the statement tested. Mother...? Royston ! I thought you were dead ! I thought you were dead. I was gonna come back. I was gonna come back when things were better. I never got back to you. What's this? I like this, this is good. Mmh? Mmh? The... the horns of dilemma... Kill Robin or kill mother... So which is it to be? I won't do it. No, hum... You... you do not understand what dilemma means. It means you have to do one... or the other. You have to... decide. And if you don't, well let's just say... I'll decide for you. Mmh? So... Should we say... Sunrise, tomorrow. Mmh? I don't know about you but I work best to a deadline. Of course, when people say "deadline"... It don't usually mean that somebody would be dead on the end of it? So... You've made an heroic escape, I think. Haven't you? And my men were then determined to catch you. Oh look, and don't forget your little badge of honor. Go on and run. - What will you do with the baby? - Well, we can't leave him. He can't come with either. What are you gonna do? Give him a little dagger? A little bow and quiver? Oh look! There's Roy ! Roy ! It is good to have you back, sir! Good to be back. Good. Yeah good yeah. - Roy. - John. - Hey, how did you escape? - Oh, you know... hum... well... I showed the sheriff some of mey moves. Reckon he was impressed. He reckoned he were gonna ask me to join his side. I... I said... "No thanks mate..." I don't do red wine from Burgundy. I'm an October Ale man, mate. So, how many did you take down? Oh, hum... a few, a few... hum, yeah, quite a few... - Hum... - What? Hundreds..? Two... Well, no, not that many, come on, people... "Moves"... What does that mean? Stop... stop, he's gonna kill us ! What? Who? Him! What? The horse! It's the same trick ! It tracked us. He sent them right to us. We're done for. Much... Well, it was possible. We've got to admit that. Robin. I need to... tell you... hum... - Something happened at the castle. - Go on. I... I've... ... something that... What is it? I know the baby's name. - Okay... - It's Seth. He's called Seth ! I met... I met the father in the castle dungeon, just for stealing bread. It looks like... the mother... The thought of raising a child on her own, she must've panicked and brought the baby out to woods. This sheriff, he.... He's destroying lives. The mother lives now in Knighton and you and I... We should take him home and give him someone to keep the child. We're moving on? No. Meet us on sunset at the Long Stone. - But where are you going? - Knighton...? Taking the baby home. Roy knows where he lives. - Well, should I come? - Hum, no. Well, more than two, we attract attention. Ah... good. I'll stay here, sort things out. I thought we'd have rabbit... you know... for supper. Lady Marianne... - Good day. - What can I do for you? - I need five minutes in the village. - Ah, that I cannot do. - Please. - I cannot. - Please! - No! Step aside, I have business in the village. There is a quarantaine. Shouldn't you know that? Pestilence. The pestilence is long gone. You know that. And if you don't, you're a fool. Sheriff's orders. I cannot let you in. I am the daughter of the old sheriff and I'm ordering you to step aside. The people in here are starving. If the sheriff knew your game, he'd have your guts for garters, I'm right, aren't I? The pestilence is gone. These people need food. Nice pie. And how about a kiss to come along? What do you say my Lady? Everybody still, if you please ! Having a little trouble? Nothing I cannot resolve myself, thank you. Sword. The village has been starved. The disease is gone but the sheriff has not lifted the quarantaine. He wants the village for accommodation. Roy, tie them. And what was your plan? Sweet talk with the guards? Bad idea. Oh, and you have a better one? Look! It's bread ! Quick, everyone ! Run, run! Come on! Quickly! Quickly! - Bless you Robin Hood. - Bless you. Bless you Robin Hood ! That is a waste of arrows. No... You could simply throw the food. We could. But where would be the fun in that? Robin ! Get out ! We get out of here. Robin... let me help you. No. Feeding the poor if foolish but understandable. Helping me is a hanging offence. Give me the baby. - This is no sport for a woman. - More than it is for a child? Is he yours? Robin. Split up. - But... - No buts ! Where did you get that dagger? Announce yourself next time. I could've killed you. Did we lose them? I don't know. I said "split up". You disobeyed me. I'm glad you did. It'll soon be dark. I missioned to reunite mother and child. We should wait a day. What do you think? It cannot wait. What do you mean? - Robin, I'm sorry... - Robin? Don't just stand there. Do you know me? - Lady Marianne. - No. You have not seen me. Understand? As you wish. Can you help me? This needle is thick and blunt. - Are you prepared? - Mmh, it's the way you say it... You need to take off your shirt. Saracen attack on the King. Caught us unawares. To this day I do not know how... Is that why you returned? The stitching became infected. I took a fever. And when I awoke, the King had gone South. And left orders for me to return to fully recover. So you return and take instantly to the woods? It must be cleaned or you will take another fever. So... You never told me... When I was in the Holy Land, you must have had suitors? I must have. It is surprising that you're not married. It is. And yet, when one considers that marriage requires a man... Perhaps not. A word of advice... your charms, such as they are... ...ceased working on me at least five years ago. - A challenge? - A statement. - Did that hurt? - Yes ! Good. Just tying off. Kiss it better. Done. You're spying? Up to no good... Sorry... I heard crying. This is the milk. And cheese for the mother. This is not our child. Master. Master ! Stay here. The horse... Can you take the baby? - Me? - His mother lives in Knighton. What? because I'm a woman? Because I have to go. My men are here. The call of the wild. Marianne... Why is it everything you say to me sounds like a criticism ? I do not know. I suppose these are the lives we've chosen. - Always different directions. - And yours is the better direction? I work within the system, it is the only way. Not at night. You dress up as... Who is it? The Night Watchman? I do not taunt the sheriff. - I do not publicly flout his decisions. - Well, okay. So... Today, at Clun...? That was different. It was an emergency. And you were wonderful. You were bold and... I wish there were more emergencies. - Is it all a big joke to you? - Is it all so serious to you? Well, forgive me for being careful. But so far nobody has had their tongue cut out because of me. Take your baby. A storm's coming from the East. The forest is no place to have a bairn. He stays here tonight. Thank you. No, no, no... We can't. Why? Well, we gotta get the baby back to his mother. Do it tomorrow. Yes, exactly. Now get inside, all of ya. I want you gone before dawn. Rumours abound. The pestilence... - ...is over. - It is over. Oh my dear... that... ...was between you and me, and the Council of Nobles. You see, now we've a problem. Either I say, you were wrong, you made a mistake, - And leave the quarantaine in place... - I was not wrong. Or... Or I say... You're right... Lift the quarantaine... Let the layabouts live... And then look for somewhere else to house my garrison. Then say I was right. See, there's always a catch. In politics... There's always a deal... If... I would've said that you were right... Then I would lose face. Well, that can't happen. We must have authority. So... I have to punish you. For your outspokenness. Punish me? I do not listen to suggestions that you are consorting with Robin Hood. That would be unforgivable. What punishment? Oh, don't worry, nothing personal... just politics. It would have to hurt hough... What punishment ?! Marianne. Common flame... Sweet. We cannot have challenges... ... to our authority. The law... ... applies to everybody. Even the privileged. Wasted beauty... Humiliation... sometimes so much better than execution. - Roy! What are you doing? - Sorry ! Master !! - Get away you.... crazy... !! - What are you doing !? We came to rescue you ! Everybody here would willing to risk his life for you ! ... kill you ! I'm gonna kill you ! And more... A rescued man owes his life to his rescuers! He'd give his life like that for the men who saved him ! - What is going on ? - This one tried to kill Robin! What ? You were like my son !! My son ! Where is my son ! Give me my son... ! John! John! Kill me. I will kill you ! John! ... kill you... John! Leave it! John! That's enough ! Listen to me! Listen to me! That's enough. Enough. I need to think. Stop. Now. What've I ever done to you to make you want to kill me? My mother... they've got my mother. And they'll kill her. Unless you kill me first. And she'll hang at dawn. I hate the sheriff. And the story about the child's mother... That was a lie too? Gisborne is the father. Gisborne ? The mother is a kitchen girl. She thinks that Gisborne is going to take the child to Kirklees abbey to be raised there. I hate Gisborne too. But that doesn't mean that this one can go around killing my master. What? We have two mothers to rescue before sunrise. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE Annie? Yeah. I think this belongs to you. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mary? Mary? - Mary? - Mother? Mary? Mary? "Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary"... Where is she? What did you do with her? Gisborne, what do you think? Does that look like the first light of day? I kept my side of the bargain... You... can keep yours. So... bring them...to see... "Mary, Mary". Swing. Mother ! No hood, I think. You'll rot in Hell for this ! Really? Just for this? Mary, Mary... Poise contrary, time to see her swing. Murderers ! - I will kill you ! - Annie ! Do not... move !! You left him in the woods ! You said he would be safe ! You left him to die ! Our son... our baby !! Gisborne? Robin ! Robin ! To the horses !! Come on then ! Locksley ! Why so much haste my friend? Sorry for ruining your day, but if you leave, he gets it. This is, our old friend, the "dilemma" calling. Master, you cannot give yourself up every five minutes ! Robin, no ! Robin, yes... Let him go. Or we all die here today. Oh, come along Robin. We both of us know we had this conversation many times. And we also know you are not the killing kind. But me... Run ! For my mother ! For the baby ! No, Roy ! My name is Royston White, I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard ! He does this for you. Come. Move. I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard ! Come on. Him... ... I liked. Your hair... It wasn't easy to wash. - Thank you my Lady. - Lady Glasson is a good mistress. You will be well looked after. And Seth too. And you too... Thank you. For me... - Especially for... - Go, you'll have a long journey. One thing... We, hum... Here, open it later. Thank you. I am going... ...this way. I'm going... Always different directions... I have to say... I'm not gonna miss that baby.
