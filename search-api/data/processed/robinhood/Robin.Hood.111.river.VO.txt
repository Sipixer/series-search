You've had a week to find it, now pay up. If he has no money, take goods to the value. If he has nothing of value, take him. This is the King's annual duty to finance his crusade against the heathen. You can't pay, you go to prison. Sheriff's decree - no exceptions, no tolerance. Next cottage. Gisborne's men. Now we know why Luke couldn't make the weapons drop. If the King knew what was being done in his name... Alice. John, come here a moment. Act normal, we don't know anything. Ah, the cooper. He owes three shillings. Take what you want, I have no money left to give you. Goods to the value. Move! And you. We could hardly pay the tithe rent as it was, and now another tax. It's stupid to go on like this, Alice. I'm fond of you and the boy. As man and wife, we could cover the taxes. No, get away from there. - Come here, you rat. - Leave us alone. - John! - Leave us alone, get off! Here. Here, sir, our tools. They must be worth a few coins, take them. - Leave us alone! - My lord, weapons. - Well, well, well. - Stop it! Saracen design. - Get off! - Now... Where does a Locksley cooper learn this type of work? There 's only one Englishman I know that uses a bow like this. Collaborate with outlaws and you will be punished like an outlaw. - Take him away. - No! - Papa! - No, John! No! Sir! P lease, I beg you, don't hurt the boy. My apprentice, he's innocent. The runt. Oh, we must make an example of him. - Take the boy too. - Leave him alone! Take your hands off my son! John, John. There are too many. He's innocent! - John! - He's my son! And we will help him, but not this way. John! - Little John! - Mother! Help us! Mother ! Mother, help! Little John! Synched and adapted by ScarHand for the SubWood Team John, stop. We need the others. - The coach is too well guarded. - No! I will not let you do this. It is too reckless. - They have my son! - I value your life too highly. Him, I value more. Clear the path! Move that branch out of the way. Get that log cleared. Go on. Put your backs into it. Come on, then! Come on! Hang on. Hang on. Get the cab to Nottingham! John... NOTTINGHAM TOWN Halt! You may pass. NOTTINGHAM TOWN - Out of the way, scum. - All right! Taxes! Taxes! Last day for the King's levy. Come on now. Taxes? - Taxes. - We're here to collect taxes. You three, you paid your ale tax? - You what? Ale taxes? - Take them away. What are you doing? I haven't done anything. - Gambling, now? - You must be kidding. Bet you haven't got a license, eh? - You lose! Take him away. - Ah! We can't help everyone. We got to find my mate's wife and we have deliveries to make. - Spare some coins, sir? - Ah, there she is. Her husband died two nights ago. The Sheriff's men beat him up. It's a gift from Robin Hood. She looks like a vagrant to me, and her brat. Where did you steal this from, then, eh? Take her away. Go, quickly. - Thank you, thank you. - Will! - Guards! - Come back here! - Get them! - Make way for the prisoners. - Go! - Little John? I've had one of these pointed in my face before. Very pretty. What does this have to do with the King's annual duty? We found this whilst collecting in Locksley. The man who made it has been supplying Robin Hood. And you have him here, in the dungeons? Ah. Well, now you interest me. Our troops could benefit from this bowmaker' s skill, we must learn from him. Learn? We should execute him. Do I detect a note of sourness in your tone, Gisborne, hm? Disillusioned with life as Lord of Locksley Manor, hm? Peasants don't like you very much? Wish Robin Hood would come back? Oh, what a shame. If a peasant defies us, we must punish him. Hard. We must make an example of him in front of the rest. We must make a event of it. An event? Why not? I'll invite all the leaders of the local community, attendance compulsory. We should be very creative in our use of punishments. The scourge - I love a good lashing. Mutilation, of course torture. But right here, right here in the great hall. Ah... A Festival of Pain. We need to use our heads. This is not just about John. Luke the cooper was trying to help us, and the boy. We have a responsibility to them too. - I did not know John had a family. - Neither did he till recently. As soon the Sheriff realizes he's one of us, he'll be hanged. That's the thing. The Sheriff won't necessarily know. - What? These... - Without these, he's just another outlaw. He has never been just another outlaw. You think the Sheriff cares if he wears one of these or not? He's right. They'll hang him anyway. Which is why we need a really good plan. Most unfortunate. A craftsman like you wasting your skills on outlaws. I've always admired artisans. Make me Saracen war bows like Robin Hood's and all this will stop. I might even allow you a little more time to pay your taxes. Such talent... All going to waste. Continue. If he doesn't speak, well... start with the boy. Please, why won't you let me through? - He's just a little boy. - No. If I could just speak to the Sheriff. I just want to see my son. Why won't you let me through? I just need to see him. It seems the Sheriff is determined to arrest half of Nottingham. Just reminding them of their obligations to the Sheriff and the King, and of their loyalty to their betters. Well, if their obligations are higher and higher taxes, is it any wonder they need reminding of their loyalty? They have nothing to give and yet they are being punished. Ah, Marian. I thought I heard your voice. Charming as ever, even in dissent. Who is the one who took out the squad of soldiers single-handed? - This one, sir. - Mm. Ugly brute. And yet, I feel I have seen him somewhere before. Do you think he looks like one of Robin Hood's men? Outlaws all look the same to me. No necklace, sir. Obviously just a common brute. Certainly looks wild enough, though. Not so tough now are we, eh, wild man? Certainly beat some civilization into you. Roll on tomorrow's entertainments. - Entertainments? - Festival of Pain! And throw that brute into the dungeons, soften him up. And you know where you can stick your pipe, too! Come here, you toe rag! - You know where to meet with the horses? - Round the back of the Trip To Jerusalem Inn. When we rescue them, we'll need to leave here fast, so don't be late. How about this? Your mother wouldn't recognize you. Come on, let's get on with it. Will, consider yourself under arrest. You cannot seriously countenance such cruelty. - Marian... - It is not punishment, it is barbaric. Delicious, is it not, hm? There is an air of poetry about, the poetry of pain. Oh, our peasant's advocate seems rather upset with me, Gisborne. Drip, drip, drip... I can hear her heart bleed from here. Fear humbles even the most rebellious spirit, my dear. Robin Hood himself will come to fear me one day, in time. Don't doubt it. My lord, do not forget the wagon with the King's duty leaves for London tomorrow. That is your responsibility, Gisborne. Just make sure it's secure. Take the whole garrison if needs be. I would hate to be in your shoes if all this fell into outlaws' hands. Especially after all the trouble we went to collecting it. Is the castle guard sufficient for your entertainments? No, take all you need. I presume you are going to accompany the cart, personally. I will take the wagon as far as the crossroads, from there two garrisons from Mansfield will be escorting it as far as London. Lah-di-dah-di-dah. Only a fool would attack against such odds. When we get out of here, I'll make you a bow of your own. I'll teach how to use it. We'll hunt together. Just you and me. Forgive the child, friend. He's frightened, that's all. It's him. That's the man that attacked the guards on the road from Locksley. You tried to rescue us? What do our tools mean to you? Are you Robin Hood? - No. - Then... why? Little John, leave the poor man alone. It's all right. You and me... we met before. I don't remember, sorry. Get along there, go on. Get along there. - That hurt. - Don't overdo it, Allan. Hold it there. We've got another one for t'dungeon here. All right? Go on, then. Come on, then. Get along there. What? Hey, calm down. Where do you think you're going? - There 's a prisoner for t'dungeons. - You're too late. It's full. Put him over there with that lot. - This one seems familiar. - He's a known troublemaker. Chain him up with the others. Yeah, they'll all get what's coming to them, tomorrow. Now how do we get in? Boo! My lady. The prisoners. I heard there were families down there, children. Do they have enough food and water? This is not some soft inn for their pleasure, my lady. That is no reason to ill-treat them. Actually, I thought I might be able to see the wild man. I'm rather intrigued. No, can't let you in. Sorry. I want every entrance covered. Marian? Guy. I was just looking for my portmanteau. I don't know whether they... took it from the horse already or... I will have it bought to your room. I'm glad you decided to stay. I didn't like to think of you all alone at Knighton Hall, with your father away. May I pass? Oi, you! Got a job for you. Not you... Shirker. Have the Lady Marian's portmanteau taken from her horse in the stables and follow me with it to her chamber. - Yes, my lord. - Quickly! Oi! Are those the sacks of grain from Locksley? - Yeah. - Well, move them into the stores, then. Now! Can you get that? Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh! Come in. Marian, your things. Over there. Careful, you clumsy oaf! Marian? I'm quite well. Could you put them over there by the bed? Wait. Is there something else I can do for you? Nothing, thank you. Marian, um... - For some time now... - I thought I would rest before dinner. Hear me out, please. Is there something the matter? No, I'm a little out of sorts, that is all. Since we came to our understanding, you have been constantly in my thoughts. Without you, I no longer feel... quite whole. Please, Sir Guy. I would rather not talk about this now. Don't send me away. We should be spending more time together, so that we can understand each other better. I want to know you. - I am sorry, I cannot. - Marian... Be with me. Please, Guy, not now. Perhaps you will at least think over what I have said. Please don't send me away. We should be spending more time together. I thought they would kill him. But still he will not tell them what they wanted. Brave man. Him, I like. Did you know my mother? I don't remember you. Unless... Mother said I dreamt it. There was a man once. He came to our house. - He was from the forest. - That was real. That was me. What's your name? I did know your mother once. My father, he was big. A giant. Bigger than you even. Though... I never knew him. John. We will get out of here. I promise you. You're mad to be here at all. Extra guards have been laid on. The place is full of prisoners. You know about the Sheriff's plans for tomorrow? - The punishments? - Yes. - And I intend to stop it. - With what? You are few against many. We few have proved quite effective in the past. We will rescue them, all of them. I have a plan. Well, half a plan, I think. How? I never give up... on anyone. You may discover it is too late for some. I mean, the way the prisoners have been treated, most of them are beyond help. The bowmaker of Locksley has already been tortured. Guy wanted a special example made of him. He is the first to be punished. Yet he plays the gallant gentleman and he does so want to know you. And you should be glad. It is because I know him, I am able to tell you the revenue wagon leaves tomorrow for London, - with the King's annual duty. - And? The Sheriff thinks you will try to save your friend, the bowmaker, whilst the wagon leaves unchallenged. Right. I have a plan. Well, where are they? He said don't be late. I mean, what if he can't rescue Little John? What if the Sheriff's hanged him already? I mean, we've been late once before. Just shut up, OK? Shut up. Sorry. I have money. It's only a few coins but if you let me through... Go home, woman. Please, I want... I want my son. Now, I'd like to sit on the right-hand side of Marian, so I can see what a bleeding heart looks like. Of course, my lord. Whatever you wish. - My son! - Oi! You can't go in there. You have imprisoned him. - Get that woman out of here. - He was arrested in Locksley this morning. - He's just a boy. - What's she saying? This is the business of the bowmaker and his boy. The outlaw collaborators. Oh. And this is the mother of the child? Oh, come, have some compassion. Gisborne. Surely she should be allowed to see her son. Such insistent maternal concern. Well, it should stir pity. Such a pretty face. It should inspire our respect, but this one, however, conceals deceit, disloyalty. So, take her away, have her put in the cell with her son and the cooper. One bad apple in a family, and we punish the whole barrel. Mother! I knew you'd come. What's going on? What's happening? I'm staying with you now. Luke. - I don't understand. - What have they done to you? John has been looking after me. Is he badly hurt? We'll get him out of here. - That's what my friend said. - Your friend? It wasn't a dream. The man from the forest. The one that came to our house. Come on. What's the matter? You're alive. Thank you, Marian. So, you're going to leave me locked up here all night? - Yes. - You're meant to say no. We're here to free you, stuff like that. Don't worry, there's a good reason for it. Now, take this lock pick. A friend of mine told me where to find it. Tomorrow morning, during this Festival of Pain, you will help John and these other prisoners escape. - Do you think these men are with us? - They've got nothing else to lose. I'll get word to Much and Djaq. I'll come back tonight. Right, scum. You are not to speak to him again. Who is he, Alice? No one. A dead man. But he's here now, with us. - First and last time. - Alice, please... Do not speak to me. You gave up that right long ago. This man... Is he who I think he is? Burns have given you a fever. John, stay away from there. I'm sorry. I can't be your friend any more. - I know. - I said stay away from him. - Alice, it's not the boy's fault. - He is not your friend. He is not anybody, you understand? - Aren't we in enough trouble? - He's in the same situation. - We all need each other now. - Mother... Alice... Alice, perhaps the boy should know. John... This man... What is it? John... I am your father. Stop worrying. I'm not worried. I'm not worried at all, I'm just... All will be fine. What do you think you're doing? Er, nothing. Just, er... my horse. It's lame and, er... I just wanted to rest him here. All right, it's me. Don't do that! - Where have you been? - Where is Little John? There 's been a change of plan. - Change of plan? - I found the distraction we needed. - We're still rescuing Little John? - Of course we are. And Luke the bowmaker, and the boy, and... Alice Little... and all the other prisoners. Oh, and the tax money. Not a big change, then... You let me believe you were dead. I was outlawed. If I'd stayed... You might have seen your son born, and provided for your family. Where were you those winters your baby son was sick with hunger? Or the first summer he had to work alongside me in the field so we could buy a loaf of bread. Where were you when the Sheriff's guard did that to his leg? When you were younger, before they told me your father was dead, I used to tell you he would come home to us one day, because I wanted to believe it myself. And then, every time you heard a horse pass through the village, you'd run out to see who it was, just in case. Sheriff's mounted guard... would not stop for a peasant boy standing in the road. Listen, you would have been outlawed too. It was better just to... to die. We could have started again somewhere else. A new name. I would have followed you anywhere, John. Not that it matters. We're all outlaws here, and tomorrow we shall suffer for it. Why do we want the sacks of grain? So Gisborne can take them to London. No, Robin. Stores are down near the kitchens, this way. First things first. We secure the revenue money. Come on. ...while you rob and murder, and do what you do. Alice, leave him. I have never killed, except to defend myself. I robbed to survive, but now, l-I rob to help others. What? Like Robin Hood? Yes, I am one of Robin Hood's men. But you don't wear a tag. Luke told me that all of Robin's men wear tags. Ah, I lost them. And you expect us to believe you? It is the truth, Alice. One lie was enough, John. Perhaps it's better for us all if you just stay dead. In fact, I wish you were dead, then we won't hear your lies. The back parry originates in Fiorentina. You've got to master that one first, Niall. We've come to relieve you lot. - You're early. - Hey, cheer up, lads. - Get the night off. - What are you on about? Oh-ho! Look what I found. Come on, let's get to work. Grab these. Lovely money. Good morning everybody and welcome to my Festival of Pain. I want to talk to you about community taxes. Taxes are a fact. The cost of living in a free country. Now, if you do not pay your taxes then you sacrifice that freedom and must be punished accordingly. I am sick and tired of your sob stories. Can't pay, too old, too sick. Is this going to help our beloved King in Acre, hm? A clue. No! Those who understand this... they will survive. For those who defy me, well... the chair of delight. John, get behind me. Stay behind me. You're still my friend. Forgive me. Get it loaded up? Aye, it's all there, sir. Ready to roll. These prisoners do not pay their way. They help those that seek to undermine my authority, therefore, they must all be punished. Now... Do you think that they're the only ones to suffer, do you? No, no, no. No, because they do not pay their dues. We, the good citizens, well, we have to pay more. Hm? And how on earth are we supposed to support our king's glorious crusade? Thank you. If they were to pay their taxes, then we in the community would pay less. So, you see what I'm actually trying to do... is lower taxes. Well, I'm feeling strangely moral. I'm feeling quite unwell, I think I might... Yes, probably the peasants, the stench. Here, sniff this if it gets too much. So, let's bring the prisoners out and start with a little burning, hm? Now, you people seem to think that Robin Hood and his men, they're worthy of your support and your encouragement. - Well, let's see. - Luke, the cooper of Locksley. Outlaw collaborator... No! I do forgive you. Alice of Locksley and her son, John. Outlaw sympathizers. Please, they had nothing to do with this. It is my doing. Oh, gallantry. You see, Marian? It's not dead. Well, not yet. Such a gallant intervention, hm? I wonder... I wonder how I could reward that, hm? Oh, I wonder. Shall we have him crawl in the coals first, hm? So gallant in the heat of the moment. Oh, so gallant. Shall the bowmaker go first or the apprentice? Decisions, decisions. Get along there. Why are they closing the gates? Stop! Give me your knife. Robin Hood! We've been tricked. Open the gates! See, bowmaker of Locksley, cross me and your family suffer. - No, no! - So, who's first? I know. The boy? Oh, brave. Burn him! Burn him! No! - Stop him. - Take him! He'll never get out of that! Take him down! - Take him. - You are a dead man! Stop him, you fools! Charity starts at home, Vaizey! Not in my home! Kill him! - Stop it! - Follow your orders! I am in command! Get off my money! John! John! Duck! Alice, go! Might have known he was one of yours, Hood. You torture children! You said you were no murderer. Not of men. This is a devil. - Good answer! - For your son's sake. Mummy! Mummy! Ah, you just couldn't... Go now. Oh, not again! Quick, Mother! Come on! Will someone get this gate open? In the name of the King! Back to the castle, now! Get me out of this, Gisborne! Get off my money! Get off my... Thank you for everything you've done, and for these. I'm sorry this meant leaving behind your home. Well, I have gained something more precious. It's a shame Little John can't go with them. He knows it's too late for that. We'd best get started. - We've got a long way to go. - Yeah. Luke is a good man, John. We can make a life together. You deserve that. Alice... You take care of yourself, and our son. I will always remember. I... I thought you might like this back. There's only one, where is the other? I shall never forget! My father is a comrade of Robin Hood ! Goodbye, my son. Him... I am proud to know. You... I'm stuck with.
