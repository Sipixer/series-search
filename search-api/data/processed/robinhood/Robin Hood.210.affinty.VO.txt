The Pact! The Pact! The Pact! The Pact! Noooooo! Morning, my Lord. Sorry to disturb you. Who are you? - Where's the Sheriff? - I was about to ask the same question. - Get out! - Uh-uh-uh. You hurt me, hurt Prince John. I'm his special envoy. - Well, I've never seen you before. - That's because I arrive at dawn, every other Thursday, share a glass of wine with the Sheriff, he stamps his seal here, I take it to Prince John and the Prince knows that all is well in the provinces. But today... all is not well, is it? No Sheriff, no stamp... and of course, you have no idea what's happened to him. - No. - Well, then I suggest you find out. You know the deal. Anything happens to the Sheriff, Prince John sends an army to raze Nottingham to the ground. We don't know if anything has happened to him. But he's not here! That's all I need to know. The troops will be here by sunset. I've already sent the signal. Nottingham is about to be flattened. Moochie Sub Wood Team I've been watching you. - You've been sleepwalking. - What? - Nice silk. - I am the Sheriff of Nottingham. I do not sleepwalk and YOU will take me to Nottingham. Maybe we should start again. What a pretty mouth you've got. And so... to Nottingham. Allan? Where are ya? Organise the guard. The Sheriff's missing. Search every inch of the castle. - Find him. - Missing? Find him! I want the sun and I want it now! Well, you can't always get what you want, can ya? - This stable lass saw him go at night. - Go? Where? Go on. He went out on his horse. He was... mumbling. - Mumbling? - Just tell him what you told me. He said, "Open the gate." And what did you do? I opened the gate. He was in his nightclothes, sir. Comb the whole town, then get out to all the villages. Just find him! Well, I see our kitchen is taking good care of you. Good food is wasted on me. But I can smell a rat. What have you done to him? Sir Jasper, nothing has been done with the Sheriff. In fact, he was seen riding out of the castle last night alive and well. - We have a witness. - Don't want a witness. I want the Sheriff. Now, what's for pudding? Your patch? Don't be so ridiculous! This is the King's forest. We're working this patch, now clear off! You've never done a day's work in your life! Find your own sucker, cos Robin Hood's ours! Robin Hood? Robin Hood comes here? Like you don't know it's a drop point. Now go on! - Sling your hook! - Very well, a drop point. Off I shall sling. Oh, this is good. This is very good. Right. He's not been seen in Locksley, Nettlestone or Clun. There's reports of troop movements, heading this way on the North Road. Noooo! - I heard about the Sheriff. Any news? - Nothing. What do you think? If he hadn't left on his own accord, I would think this was Hood's work. No, no, no. Hood knows the arrangement between the Sheriff and Prince John. He wouldn't let Nottingham be destroyed. On this occasion I don't think Hood is the problem, - but he might be the solution. - How? Robin knows Nottingham and the forest better than any man alive. - If the Sheriff's out there... - He's not going to help us. - Well, have you asked him? - We do not deal with outlaws. This could be our only hope. If I could get a message to him, if I could bring him here to the... To the castle... You could bring Hood here to the castle? I think so. He will not want Nottingham razed to the ground. Same as you. Very well. Do it. A good morning's work, lads. Well done. What have you got there, John? It lays golden eggs. And tomorrow, there's a consignment of magic beans coming in. John, - I think we need to have a little... - Oh, give me strength! This is the booty, here! This is for the kitchen. Oh, could have done with some magic beans! Well, I'm glad to see someone's laughing. I'm on my own! Honest! What do you want? Marian said to show you this and you'll know I'm telling the truth. All right? She needs your help. Just for today, you've got safe passage into the castle. You don't expect us to believe that? - Why? - They've lost the Sheriff. If we don't find him today an army is coming to destroy Nottingham. We're leaving. Now. We drop everything on the say-so of a traitor to go and help our enemy? John, I gave Marian this ring. She wouldn't lie to me. Come on. Put it down! Wait there. Open the gates! This is weird, I don't like it. Can't you just sneak in anyway? After this, we go back, we help the poor? Yes, John. There are people waiting, we have four drop-offs today. They're relying on us. All right. Take these, Much. Well! You're a bigger man than I thought, Gisborne. Asking your enemy for help in a time of crisis. It's your crisis as well, Hood. You know what Prince John will do if anything happens to the Sheriff. - Have you searched the castle? - Of course we did. He was seen leaving last night, on horseback... in his nightclothes. Shock troops will be here by sundown. Nottingham and everything in it will be destroyed. If anyone can find him, it's you. You have people everywhere. Go on then. Ask. - What? - Ask me for my help. - Robin... - Him. We're wasting our time. - Will you help us find the Sheriff? - Of course I will. Why else do you think I came? Shoes... My kingdom for some shoes... Whoo, a change of clothes. My man! My, er, my dear fellow... You, er, you do realise that those clothes are worth at least? Yeah, sure, and I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham. - So? - We have to find him. You and I will track him. Take one, take one. Will, I want you to wait in the town, search every street, ask around. Djaq, John... - John?! - Every day, more beggars. - John, you need to focus. - Are we making any difference to them? Robin, you can't just throw money at them! Today we're trying to save everybody's life! The Sheriff may be in the forest. I want you and Djaq to go there, check all the regular drop points. Somebody may have seen something. Will? I don't know how today is going to end. But whatever happens, you need to look after Marian. - Of course... - Will, I'm relying on you, she has to live, even if no-one else does. You do know Hood robs from the rich... - We told you to clear off! - To give to the poor? - What do you think we're doing here? - Living off scraps, my dear. Think about it. He robs from the rich. He must have a huge stash somewhere. And what does he give you? A handful of scraps? Tut-tut-tut... Don't talk rubbish. If you upped your game, then you could get inside Hood's secret camp and... who knows what you might find there? Now, with a little tuition from me... Hey, we rob fools for a living. Oh, so do I. So do I... How does, um, Robin Hood's secret treasure interest you? Yeah? And your cut's the lion's share? No, no, no... I don't want any of it. You can have it all, have it all. I'm only interested in a teeny weeny bit of paper that belongs to me. - Who are you? - I am the... man with the plan. So, shall we begin the lesson? Search the houses, one each. They're looking everywhere. They're even dredging the ponds. He's just nowhere. - Keep searching. - Right. Ah, it's good, this. You and me, back on a mission. I mean, no offence against the others, but... it's like the good old days, back in the Holy Land... Look, these shoes. They were definitely made by the Sheriff's smithy, weren't they? - That's him. - Come on. Master, you know that ring, the one Marian gave you...? - Is it a new code? - No... I gave it to her when we were in the tree. What, you giving jewellery? That must've surprised her. She probably thought you were going to propose. Yeah, I did. And she said yes. Well, this is when you're supposed to say "congratula..." Congratulations! - She said yes? - She did. That's incredible. Only if we live to enjoy it. Come on... He went this way, come on. It's not enough just to be poor... - and dirty. - I can do old. - Works every time with the nuns. - Yes, not bad, but you see, come here, you really need something that makes you stand out, - really stand out from the poor crowd. - We could be sick as well. - Better, better... - We can do foaming at the mouth. Oh, and deathly pallor. Oh, yes, the poor distraught mother desperately trying to protect her dying brood. Excellent, excellent! Eat the lot. But you see, not just old and weak. But... Ah! He's blind, he's blind and all! Thank you very much, you're too kind, but what we need is a clincher. Now, what would make Robin Hood's bleeding heart really gush? For a big enough haul, I could always chop one of the kid's arms off. I like your thinking, very good, but, erm, no. I've a better idea. - It's not enough. - That's all there is. - Not enough for all the villagers. - Families with young children first. No, we need more food. No. We need to find the Sheriff. - I don't care about the Sheriff. - All right, then you don't care about Nottingham. - That's not what I meant. - John. If the Sheriff isn't found, Nottingham will be destroyed. Everyone, everyone else is out looking for the Sheriff. Yes. And that's what we should be doing too. I can't let people starve. - And I won't go against Robin's orders. - Why? Because he's right. And he's our leader. Leaders can be wrong. Sir Jasper... I think that we can come to some sort of understanding. I know that you're only acting in the Sheriff's best interests and so are we. You're not doing a very good job of it. The truth is that we just don't know where he is. And we need more time. Look, rules are rules. If I make an exception, the next thing, every other ambitious young captain is murdering his sheriff thinking he can get away with it. - I've not murdered him, I assure you. - Well... I could make you a very rich man. Look, if Nottingham or Derby or any other town under Prince John's protection gets razed to the ground, it has to be rebuilt. And it so happens that the Royal Charter for Reconstruction has been licensed to my cousin. Did you think I was going to be a glorified messenger all my life? - You really are going to do this? - Oh, yes, come sunset, no Sheriff, no Nottingham. It always amazes me how much dust an army kicks up. But then it's a very big army. - Three more drops. - Yes, one here and two more before the river. Someone must have seen the Sheriff by now. Oh, my baby! - Dear God... - Oh, my baby! Oh, my baby! No-one... No-one should be reduced to this. By the looks of them, that is not the last grave they'll dig. Not if I can help it. Oh, my baby! Do not be alarmed, no-one will hurt you. - We're with Robin Hood. - Oh, God bless ya. - God bless ya. - Why didn't he take me instead of my only grandchild...? We must stay here and help them. - John, we have a mission. - THEY are our mission. - Robin has asked us... - Robin is not here! We are. These people need our help. - Jasper will not be swayed. - There's still time. - There's time for you to get away. - No. You did not run when I was being held hostage. I'm not leaving you in trouble. Well, then... we must prepare to defend ourselves. Search all of the villages, just find him. Go. Ask around. I don't think we're going to get out of this, Will. But if we do, do you...? Do you reckon I could come back to the lads? You're too late, Allan. Miles too late. - I've made a few mistakes, but... - Mistakes?! You deliberately betrayed us! Strictly speaking, that's true. - Yeah. - Yeah. But it's not that simple, Will, all right? I never told Gisborne where the camp is. I saved your life, didn't I? Well? I know a lot of about how this place works now. That's gonna help Robin, right? Come on. What do you reckon? The old team, back together? You're with Gisborne now. There's no coming back from there. I'm getting used to it, life as an heroic outlaw. The King will come back, you and Marian will be married living in some grand old mansion. - And I'll just... - Well, well well. Look at these marks. They carry on this way, come on. - I mean, it's all going to end. - Tell it to the sun, Much! Look, it's racing across the sky and if we don't find the Sheriff before sundown, everything will end. Me, you, Marian, everything! There'll be nothing left but scorched earth. Oh! It's so cold. So cold. I've got some medicines back at camp. No. - We take them with us. - The camp is secret. Look at them! Do you really think it's a good idea to leave them out here? Truthfully? The old man won't know. The rest we blindfold. - Can I just have a word? - I assume you're talking to me. Sorry, Sir Jasper, if you've got a moment. Go on. Between you and me, Guy is not very good at talking himself up. I want you know to know we're doing everything we can, - even if he's not showing it. - Good. There's not a long of men would do what Guy's doing right now. You should keep him in mind for other things. He could be very useful - in another county. - What? Him and YOU? Well, yeah, I suppose so. It's interesting, isn't it, when people realise that they're going to die, suddenly all this new-found loyalty creeps out of the woodwork? - I want to live. - Allan... You'd better find the Sheriff then. I thought I gave you a job to do. You did. I'm on it. Your boy really wants to save you. This isn't about me, but about the people of Nottingham. Correct. And much as I dislike you, you need not fear the onslaught. As a Black Knight, you and your family may pass freely through the town. - I have no family. - Good. Keeps things simple. But I do have friends. - Family. Not friends. - One person in particular. - Oh, a particular Lady Marian? - Yes. We were once engaged and I have reason to hope that, in time... Wait, wait, wait. "Reason to hope"? Doesn't really wash. - In time, she will be family. - In time? - Yes. In time she will be my wife. - Not if she's dead. - Marian comes with me. - Yes. If you've married her by then. I can't marry her between now and sunset, can I?! Why not? She's hardly going to say no, is she? Sir Jasper, Sir Jasper? The time for talking is over. I have to brief my troops. - At least let us evacuate the town! - No. Spare the women and children, please... An example has to be set. As Prince John always says, the best examples are written in blood. How many? They're surrounding the whole town. It's going to take a lot to do that. Get all of our guards into siege positions. What guards? They're out looking for the Sheriff. Get every able-bodied man into the armoury. Do you trust this lot with weapons? We're fighting for our lives now. All of us. - Hang on... - Just do it! Right. Here we are. Try to get some rest. We'll bring food and medicine. The promised land. - Help me... - I'm coming. - Help me. - This way, I'm here now. - Help me... - Just straight on. Straight on. - A little bit of cheese... - We'll give you a little wash first. - Where's Marian? - Will. Looks like we're brothers in arms again after all. Not exactly what I had in mind. Will! Any word from Robin? But I know he will die before he stops looking. - Today that's not good enough, Will. - Marian... one person who can't die is you. - There's no way out. - I promised Robin you'd be safe. Where is he going? You know, I was thinking, I might stay here when you and Marian are, you know... Much. Look. I think we're going in on him. These are fresh footprints. Or I could be a lone outlaw. The Sherwood Avenger... Much, come here. Yes! Only one man in Nottingham has nightclothes like that! I don't believe it. Where did you get those clothes? I traded them, fair and square. For some good rags. You traded rags for silk pyjamas? - I don't think so. - Yes, it's true. A little man. Ugly. Said my rags would help him find important papers in the forest. Papers? It's the Pact! - The Pact? - The camp, come on! Marian... - Has he changed his mind? - No. But could negotiate a concession. Nottingham cannot be spared, but he will spare me and my family. You're abandoning us? I've no intention of abandoning you, Marian. You could become my family and we could leave together if... you marry me. Is it such a difficult choice? - Between death and being my wife? - It's not that simple. How can I abandon them? Marry me... and live. It has to be before sunset. That's when I leave. Come on. I'm slowing you down. - Don't worry about me. - Hey, Much. I like worrying about you. Now come on, come on! I won't be long. We have numbers, so don't bunch up. And make sure you use the little brats. Heroes aren't allowed to kill kids. - There's no other way. - There has to be! There's a ring of steel around Nottingham. Even if we got beyond the walls, we'd be cut down. Then we will have to fight as best we can. Marian, you can't save these... You can't save these people. Much as I hate Gisborne, you have to marry him. - No! - Wherever you go, wherever... you go, Robin will move heaven and earth, he will find you. Just stay alive. Robin! This doesn't make any sense! There's no way the Sheriff will find our camp. - He knows, Much. Somehow he knows. - What if you're wrong?! I mean, look at the sun! We're nearly out of time! We should go to Nottingham, rescue Marian, Will, and whoever else we can. No, Much! The Sheriff is heading for the camp. And finding him is the only way we can save anyone! Actually, we won't be staying for lunch. I know you. I helped you! Yeah, thanks for that. Where's the loot? Stop! Get your hands off my children! Right. You tie up the oaf, I'll go find the stash. Er, WE'LL... find the stash. Boys, tie up the big man. Yes, well, he does give to the poor. There! It's here somewhere. Yes! - Come to mamma! - Don't slobber over it, woman! Don't! You stupid old man! In one day, I've been a rich man, a poor man, a beggar man, and now a thief! Traitors! Yes, and so young! Hood! Please! Please! Don't shoot! Think of the children. Out of my kitchen! You really need to work on your parenting skills. And you, - you shouldn't be out so late. - Back up! You can't touch me, Hood. Not unless you want your beloved, stinking, - poor whingeing paupers to burn! - Nobody's burning anything. You have to get me back to Nottingham by sunset! And there's nothing you can do about it. Confused, he will be. Marian, we're out of time. What's your decision? Well, I'm not going to walk out on these people. - So you're going to stay? - Yes. Woman! Your wilfulness will kill you. Oh, it's getting cold. Shall we light a fire? Get those gates open! And the woman, Marian, is she leaving with you? She will not abandon Nottingham. Imbecile. And without her... my world may as well turn to ash. Marian! You came back! If I'm going to die, I'm going to die by your side. Swords! They're coming! They're coming! Marry me now, and make it the last thing we do. Let's steal that from them, at least. Gisborne! Gisborne?! Gisborne?! - You're alive! - Don't you just stand there! Give me that damned seal! One day! I'm away for one day, and look at it! LOOK AT IT! - Are you still here?! - No, my lord. You heard him, stand down! My lord, what happened? Where did you go? I just thought I'd see how you'd cope without me for a day. Hood found you. And? He could still be here, we could still get him. No. No, I don't need him any more. Single-handedly... I single-handedly managed to infiltrate Hood's secret camp and retrieved the Pact... The Pact! The Pact?! The Pact! No... The Pact! The Pact! Get him, get after him. Well, that's the paperwork done. It's my fault we nearly lost that thing. If the Sheriff finds this camp again, I will never forgive myself. I've been a fool, Robin. I'm sorry I disobeyed your orders. You're a good man, John... who cares about his fellow man. Never, ever apologise for that. Robin, you don't really think the Sheriff was sleepwalking, do you? Nothing that man does would surprise me. No, I'm sorry. No, no-one can ride a horse in their sleep. I knew a man once who got up, milked all his goats and then went right back to bed, all in his sleep. - What?! - It's true! His wife saw it. - Didn't she wake him up? - Are you mad? She went out and bought six more goats! - Robin! - Legrand! Message from the King. - It's a map. - What's it mean? - Treasure? - I want it. Let's find out who you really are. The King knows your skill with the bow. - Your Majesty. - Ah! Marian.
