Transcript: SimonP y evarin Synchro by: Marga y CarpeDiem wWw. Asia-Team. Tv Will, Djaq, I need numbers. Oh, I'm gonna die! Not because of them, but because of shame! - Much! Nobody is going to die! - Why didn't I have it in the forest? In the forest, not in a village where we can be betrayed and surrounded! Nettlestone is getting nothing this winter. Much! Shut up! - Do you have a plan? - No. - Half a plan? - I don't have half a plan! - How many, Djaq? - 30, 40? 40?! We're dead! Wait. There's more on that side. 100! They're coming! Barricade the door. No, wait! I've got this. Hood! Hood! Hood! I'm sorry, Robin. This was meant for your birthday. Much, Will, open the door. - What's that? - A pig! Black powder, Djaq? I told you I never wanted to see that again. - I disobeyed you. - Good. - Have you got any more? - None. There's more where that came from, Ellingham. We've got enough black powder to destroy a whole army! You're bluffing! Get a message to the Sheriff. Now, that should buy us some time. We need to think. There are five of us and a hundred of them. Once, a few determined Spartans held a pass against a vast Persian army. - Really? - Strategy. - And they lived? - No. But they did well. Oh. I hate that story, too. Come in. Today is the 14th October. - Robin Hood's birthday. - It is. It is? Marian... apart from your escapades as the Nightwatchman, is there anything else that you'd like to tell me? No. Good. Well, I came to tell you that I'm going away. - Away? Where? - I cannot say. But when I return, things will be different. Better for me. Better for us. Guy, what's going on? Marian, I will not be here to supervise you. I must be assured that the Nightwatchman is finished. - Yes, but... Where are you going? - Marian, do I have your word? You have my word. Are we going to kill them? Yes! - Are we going to like it? - Yes! - Are we going to kill them? - Yes! Are we going to like it? - Yes! - Are we going to kill them? Yes! - Are we going to like it? - Horrible... Don't take any notice. All they're trying to do is mess with our heads. It shows they're playing for time. See if there's any water in those barrels and fill those buckets. - Why? - In case they try to burn us out! - Are we going to like it? - Course. - Are we going to kill them? - Yes! We're going to love it. Keep an eye on that bag, yeah? - Your boy is ready? - Looks like it. - He knows where we're going? - I told him Portsmouth. That's it. - Good. - My Lord, the mercenaries, are you sure we shouldn't bring them? With any luck, by now they'll be celebrating Hood's birthday. No, we'll do this alone, quietly. Have they told you why? We going to Portsmouth, that's alll know, Marian. All right? - You didn't get that from me. - You know what this means? - No. - The King. They must be expecting the King to land in Portsmouth. - It could be anything. - That's not good enough Allan. Now, what if it is the King? You know what they'll do to him when he arrives. It's not my call, is it? I'm the whipping boy around here. The packing boy. Look, if you go along with treason, then you are committing treason. Rubbish. If you go along with farting, doesn't mean you've farted yourself, does it? What's happened to you? I've learned which side my bread's buttered on. Robin! Robin! Where are you? I need to stop the Sheriff. Come along, you blithering oaf! We haven't got all day! Gently! Move! Tanning cream. Bottles of... Ah! News from Nettlestone? Nice? Nasty? Both? Small problem. Exploding fire? What do you mean, exploding fire? Black powder. Yes, I know what it is! We want permission to burn down the barn. They'll be toast. Are you deaf? I told you. I want Robin Hood's pretty little face, on his pretty little head, attached to his pretty little body on a pretty big spike outside my castle! Then what do we do? He's got food in there for a week. I don't care what you do! I don't care how long it takes! Bring me Hood's body on a spike! Right. John, Will, Djaq. Everyone, get ready to run. What are you doing? I'm the one who go us in this situation, I'll get us out of it. I'll go out the front, I'll pretend to negotiate, I'll distract them, you make good your escape. If I die... - remember me fondly. - Much... - Stop! - What are you doing? Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm unarmed. I'm here to surrender and negotiate... Thank you! Horrible people. Revolting. Allan. I can't find Robin. I wouldn't worry about it. This trip, it'sjust me, Giz and the Sheriff. No soldiers, no mercenaries. I don't think it's the King, Marian. Yes, welll do. And I'm going to stop it. - How? - I don't know. I'll kill the Sheriff if I have to. What? Have you forgotten what happens if the Sheriff dies? No. Prince john's armies will raze Nottingham to the ground. So, leave it. Yes, if the King is in the south, that's where Prince john's men will be. Nottingham will be safe. That's a lot of assumptions there. And if I prevent the Sheriff from killing the King, then that's the King back on the throne. That's the end of Prince john. The end of the Black Knights and the end of their threats. So... You want to save England single-handedly? No, but I can't find Robin! Gisborne and the Sheriff are ready to leave. There's no time. Will you help me? - Sorry, you're out of your depth. - No, I'm sorry. You underestimate me. Allan! My Lords, wonderful news... My Lords... Glorious news. We, the Black Knights, stand on the verge of greatness. We did not wait for Mohammed to come to the mountain. No. We took the mountain to Mohammed! We did not wait for the King to land... Mistake, missy. Big mistake. We've got time, Hood. - All the time in the world. - Us too! Would you like some more roast hog while you're waiting? I don't understand. What kind of soldiers are these? They're not doing anything. Mercenaries. They fight for money, not passion. That is why. They do not want to fight and die. So, what, you think they're just going to wait? Yep. Looks like it. And we can't escape from here. They're just going to wait until we come out. And then kill us. Not even a conversation. You missed all the fun, Gisborne. Your leper friend tried to kill me. - Did you know about this? - I didn't know anything. Why would he know anything about this? She knocked him out and took his sword. - What? - Well, I wasn't expecting it, was I? It wouldn't have happened. Yeah, she's good. I'm better though. 'She's good, but I'm better. ' That means you knew she was capable of this. - You knew, too, didn't you? - My Lord, please, I can explain. Well, you better had explain because she just made an attempt on my life! I recently discovered that Marian was the Nightwatchman. What? And you didn't tell me! I believed Marian's days as the Nightwatchman were over. - I believed I had dealt with it. - By tricking me! By faking her escape?! Who was it who ran away? Look, I was just following orders, all right? - I gave the order. - Why? I thought Marian's instincts were misguided and did not merit hanging. Oh, how very noble of you, dear boy. I can't help thinking that maybe you wanted something in return. A display of gratitude? Oh, the Nightwatchman! - I'm impressed! - Get off me! Guards! Pack a trunk for Lady Marian. - She's coming with us. - To the Holy Land? Oh, yes. Oh, look, look, the look. So eloquent. 'Oh, Guy, what's going to happen?' Well, we just don't know, do we, missy? Listen, Guy, the Holy Land? Is this what I think it is? Are we killing the King? You're part of the inner sanctum now, Allan. You should be honoured. No, no. I am. I am. It's just... the Holy Land? This is the ultimate mission. It carries with it the ultimate prize. Absolute power. - Yeah, for you and the Sheriff. - And you. Allan, your loyalty will be rewarded in land and title. - I'll see to that. - Really? - Really. - What you mean... Like a lordship or something? Now what? This is driving me mad! Why don't they just come in here and kill us? Cos there's no incentive, Much. Every hour that goes by, we become more fearful, more tired, more likely to take foolish action. Foolish action was bringing us here in the first place. I've said I'm sorry. That's not good enough. Oh, you've never made a mistake I'm not saying anything! - What? - I'm not saying anything. You brought the Sheriff to our camp! - You showed him where we lived. - I was trying to feed the poor! That's what we used to do! What's this all about? - Feeding your fat face! - Fat face! Look who's talking! Shut up, the pair of you! This is exactly what they want us to do. Fighting amongst ourselves and save them the trouble. Don't give them the satisfaction! - In fact, I think we need to relax. - Relax?! I don't know why I didn't think of this before. It's my birthday. Let's celebrate. Let's eat. I haven't got a fat face. - Fat face. - Badger beard! Are you seriously going to the Holy Land? Yes, yes. I've never been before, have you? They say the weather's wonderful. Guy's been before, haven't you, Gizzy? You've been before? Then it's true? You tried to kill the King. What? Do you feel betrayed? Are you going to try to kill the King again? YES. You could say that it's Robin Hood's fault. You see, Robin did warn the King to be on his guard when he lands. So, first plan, mercenaries in the port, dead in the water. The new plan, instead of waiting for him, we pay him a little visit. Mohammed not coming to the mountain. Indeed. Shall I use that? Quite good. Are you listening, Robin Hood? Be careful. We thought you might like some apple with your pork! Enjoy your meal! And just to let you know, we won't be troubling you tonight. Or tomorrow. - We're going to starve you out of there! - You better come back next Tuesday then. We've got enough food and water to last a week here! A week? Is that all you can last? What a shame! The Sheriff's paying us by the day! Ah. You're a funny man! Do us a favour. Next time, bring some mustard as well, will ya? - We don't have water for a week. - I know that. - What are we going to do? - Do you think they're bluffing? It doesn't matter. Either way we're beaten. Well, one thing's for certain, we can'tjust sit here and eat pork! Lads... I've got a proposal. - If they don't come to us, we go to them. - When? - First light. - There's too many. - We'll die. - It's suicide. - A good day to die. - Will you just shut up? Why does he say that? I don't even know what it means! We'll almost certainly die. - But at least we'll die fighting. - Yeah, I'm in. - Me too. - Yes. - And me. - Good, good. Then tonight is a Kalilah and Dimnah night. What? You don't have Kalilah and Dimnah? Surprisingly not. Kalilah and Dimnah night, you remember for your whole life. You must speak only the truth. You must ask all your questions. Share all your dreams. Confess all your secrets. - It's just talking. - Yes! But it's real talking. And if you're too boring, someone shouts Kalilah and you lose your turn. You start. - Oh, no. - Just talk. You like talking. - I knowl do, but... not like this. - Fine, then I'll start. - How many beds are you after? - Three. - And you, with the horses? - No, no. This one. You'd better not sleep tonight. Robin Hood will find out what you're doing and he will come and he will stop you. It's Robin Hood's birthday today, did you know that? He's having a party in Nettlestone village. And somebody has invited one hundred of my fiercest mercenaries. And they've got him surrounded. So... So, Robin Hood is no more. Well, sleep tight. Don't let the horse flies bite. Allan! Allan! - You can't go through with this. - Yes, I can. You heard them, Marian. Robin's finished. Not if we get away. We'll go back to Nottingham. We have to help him. - Allan! - Coming. So, I admire you. All of you. You are a good man. Brave, generous, kind, decent men and I love you. All of you. And I am proud to be amongst you- Is this just everyone saying they love each other? Wait... And you're filthy. And you really stink and you have no souls. - We live in the forest. - I have to be honest! I have to be honest. And if I am being honest... I have to say... that I do not love all of you in the same way. It's me, isn't it? You love everyone, but you don't love me. Brilliant. There is one... I do love. More than the others. The way a bird would... fly two thousand miles, through storms, just to be with the one he loves! That is the love I feel. And I am a fool! Because it is only now, when we are about to die... that I have the courage to admit it, even to myself. I'm sorry. - I should have said earlier. - Will! I knew it. You, Will Scarlett, are strong and true. And you fight for what you believe in. And that's why I love you. And I love you. I love the way you say what you mean. - I love your silly voice. - Silly voice? That's it. I take it back all of it. I hate you. And I love the way you fight like a man. Ferocious! And the way you will always, always be a woman. Kalimnah! Boring! - Kalilah! - Whatever. Can I trust you? Yeah, of course. - Tell me. - Tell you what? Robin Hood and Marian. What about them? They're still... aren't they? Even if they were, he's finished now, right? That is not an answer, Allan. I need to know. What's this, kissing in the moonlight? Shall I go out and come in again? What do you think? - Go to bed. - Yeah. John? No. - John, come on. - Who do you love? You. All of you. Even him. I love you all. All right? And Alice. I shouldn't have let her go. And my boy. Little Little john. I should have... made them stay. - John, you didn't have a choice. - Let me speak. Leaving Alice, running to the forest... was wrong. Wrong. That's why I'm a huge, ugly, stupid, useless COWARD! - John! - That's why I'm always saying it, Much. Today is a good day to die. Because for me it is. I deserve to die. I left the people that loved me. The two people that should have depended on me. My own child! - What was I thinking?! - John? I'll not let you talk like this. I'm going now. - I won't wait till tomorrow. - John. Let's move this cart. I need to die! I want to die! Let me die! - Let me die! - John! Let me die! I want to die! Is this normal with this Kalimnah thing? Cos it's weird. Robin, sorry. Look, I'm not doing this. - Fine. - Good... Because I don't hate myself and I'm not in love with anyone else so... - Fine. - Fine. There's nothing to say, then. What? What? You're smiling. I'm smiling because usually it's a struggle to shut you up. You think I talk too much? Well, I know that's what you think. Much talks too much. And eats too much, worries too much. That's easy for you to say because if I don't do it, then who does? It's all right for you. You can breeze through life and be everyone's hero! and not worry about things like the fire or food or a hole in your cape or your birthday. Because good old, dependable old Much will take care of that. Well, I'll tell you something, you take me for granted. - You're sniggering. - Much! I'm just saying... And you shouldn't! And I'm angry! And just because I love you, it doesn't mean I can't hate you, too. And I hate you, because in the Holy Land there was two of us and we were a team and the things we went through, the horrors we saw, we went through them together. And when we came home we were like brothers, brothers in arms. And where is that now, eh? It's gone. That's where! We never talk. We just don't. You made me a free man and we're meant to be equals. We're not equals. The only thing that's changed around here is you treat me like a servant, you don't treat me like your friend. That's not true. Is it true? Kalilah. Well, they're not coming tonight, that's for sure. We'll make a plan for the morning. Allan! - Thank you. - I can't get the key. Go. Go quickly. What about you, though? You've crossed the Sheriff now. I'll be fine. Go. Save Robin. Go. Who's there? I heard voices. We stay tight up until this point. And then we divide. Is everybody clear? Show me. I go here. Will and I... here. And then you switch positions and you cover from the back. And after that? Much, I don't think there's going to be an after that. Yeah, I know. First light. Nearly dawn. This is it. This is really it. Forget what I said. I don't want you to die remembering me that way. I'll remember you as my loyal friend. Right, let's get the weapons ready. As soon as there is light to see by, we go. No. - No! - John, we agreed this. You have not spoken, Robin. It's your turn. We have a few moments left on this earth. Let me have my thoughts to myself. I'll share them with you in the next life. Robin, if there is a heaven, yours is different from mine. If there isn't a heaven? - It's almost light. - Robin. You know my thoughts. They are for the poor. They are for you. And they're for Marian. The woman I love. - The woman I recently gave a ring to... - You're engaged? The woman who makes me believe that, by a twist of fate, we might just be able to see this through. And Much, I have betrayed your friendship. But I think you know why. You see I can't face the terrors we saw, I can't. Because I'm not as strong as you. I have to put them out of my mind because if I don't, then I wouldn't be able to lead. I mean, Iwouldn't even be able to... What? - It doesn't matter. - Be able to shoot? Shoot? Of course, he can shoot. No. john's right. In the Holy Land, the men we saw, in bits... screaming. Every time I raise my bow, I see them. I hear them. And I know now, whether it was right or wrong, what we did in the Holy Land, it makes no difference. So, I have to try not to kill. I have to avoid killing. I mean, God gave me a gift with bow. I can kill with my eyes closed, I mean, I can kill a man from a thousand yards. And I have to try everything in my power not to. And that's why I wasn't there for you in your hour of need, my friend. Because I have to let those memories go. I just have to be free. Why didn't you say? It doesn't matter now. In a few moments, we'll be free for ever. Well... here's to freedom. Here's to the poor. Here's to the good people we leave behind. - We are Robin Hood. - We are Robin Hood. Thank you, my friends. I should have let you look after me, Guy. I should have let you. I'm your boy. I'm nothing without you. Right from the very beginning, I should have let you look after me. Guy, don't be too disappointed. - What? - Your boy, Allan. He doesn't love you any more. He's run away, he's lost his nerve. - I'll find him. - No, no, no... Let him go. We don't need him. It's better this way. just us. What do you think, john? A good day? Yes. A good day. Morning. Allan A Dale, Gisborne's man. - Looking for Ellingham? - That's me. Sheriff sent me on an errand. He wants me to take the outlaws to him at the castle. No. Sheriff says they have to stay in there till they rot. Or till they come out to be shot. - Yeah? He's changed his mind. - Why? It turns out they might have some information he needs. I think it's probably... you know, Black Knight stuff. You'll be paid in full, obviously. - God speed till we meet again. - See you in heaven, my friends. Excuse me, gents. Coming through. Thank you. Right, let's move out! Move out! Be ready. One... Two... - Allan! - What? - Allan A. Dale! - What?! Open up! I'm here on behalf of the Sheriff. - Let him in. - Kill him! Calm down. Oh, thank God. What do you want? - What do you want? - Listen! We haven't got time to talk now, all right? I've spun them a yarn. We've got to get out of here before they... We?! We?! I'm with you. Trust me. I've been an idiot. I'm sorry. ********* The Sheriff and Gisborne are going to the Holy Land. - The Holy Land? - They're on a boat from Portsmouth. They're going to kill the King. Right, we need to get out of here. Now. Sea air, Gisborne. Sea air. Well, come along. Give Gizzy a little kiss. No? On ward, driver, let's go and kill a king, shall we? It's all right, it's all right. They're coming quietly. The show's over. One thing. I got to get this rabble back to the castle somehow. Sure. The Sheriff wants to talk tothe outlaws in the castle? - Yeah. - Strange that, because a little birdie told me that the Sheriff left the castle yesterday. - You're joking! Did he? - Nice try. Get them! You've got no chance. You're going to die. We are going to die, but not today! Good to have you back. She's with me. - Good to have you back. - Good to be back. I told you you were going to die. And we said not today! Come on, lads! Get them. Get them. What are you waiting for? They're getting away. - To the camp? - No time. There's something I haven't told you. - What? - The Sheriff has got Marian. - What? - She wanted to save the King, so she tried to kill the Sheriff and got caught. Allan's right. We haven't time. We go to the coast. Now! I'm coming, my love. I'm coming. Sheriff? Nasir. My dear boy. Karim. Very good. Oh, very good. What is our plan? You are going to visit King Richard. - You are Saladin's new messenger. - Saladin's royal seal. - Where did you get this? - Saladin's old messenger. - But there is also a password. - It was difficult getting that. Like pulling teeth. It was... - Pulling teeth! - When we get in... I kill him? No, no, no. You won't get to within a thousand yards ofthe King's tent. - I want you to lure him out. - How? By telling him what he wants to hear. Peace. Nothing can stop us now. Right, lads, work to do. Save Marian, save the King, save England. - Food. You should eat. - Guy, listen to me. Now that Robin is dead, you are the King's last chance. If you save him from this plot he will reward you with position and wealth. You'll have everything you wanted. Saving him from this plot? How would that work? Kill the Sheriff. The King will reward you. And... And I will reward you. How? If you save the King... I will willingly give you my hand. He is a Black Knight. I would trust him with my life. Ah, here he is now. Ah, how's our leper friend? Whingeing as usual. What if the King's moved on? What if he isn't in Acre? Then we'll find Djaq's uncle's friend. Bassam. - I'll check upstairs. Ok? - All right. What does Bassam do? The pigeon handler. - Remember Lardner? - The bird the Sheriff got with his buzzard? - That's what you think. - We switched the pigeons. You're joking?! Nice one! So, you got the message to the King in the end? Yeah, well, no thanks to you. Oh, look, I've told you a thousand times. I'm sorry boys, all right? - I'm back now. I'm one of the lads, let's- - Hands up who hasn't betrayed the group. Oh, this one again, how clever... - Just leave it, Much, eh? - Sorry. - We just want to find the King. - And Marian. - And Marian. - Robin. I want to show you something. See those two guards there? Saracen soldiers. That means this town is back in the hands of my people. The town is under curfew and it will be dangerous. The bad news is your King will not be here. Right. We find your friend Bassam. Can I ask you something? Being back here, in the Holy Land... Do you feel funny? Cos I feel funny. To be the enemy again. If these people knew we were English... We have to find Marian. If we don't get Marian back- - We will find Marian... - Robin! Get a grip, Marian. Robin's dead. Saracens! Three more this way! - Bassam's house? - This way! These are Bassam's birds. It's as beautiful as I remember it. - Safiya? - Bassam! You're still alive! - So are you! - Me? I'm always alive. My body might fall to bits, but I'll still have to tend to these birds. - But you love them. - I love you. When I was a little girl, I loved these birds. I thought that when I grew up, I would live here and train them. The closest I'd ever get to flight. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually. - Bismillah. - Bismillah. He speaks our language. Well, you speak mine. It seems only fair. - I need to find our King. - Why should I help you? Because his life is in danger. You want to save him so that he can continue waging war against our people? No. I want to take him home and make peace. So he can save his own people from some very unpleasant men. Robin is a man of peace. Trust him. Please. His camp is to the north. I will show you in the morning. Thank you. Yes, of course. He can be trusted.</i> If he says they are there, then they are there.</i> Robin Hood? Not possible. Here in Acre, with his men. Looking for the King. - Not a problem. - How so? They're still looking for him, so they haven't found him yet. We're going to add a little something extra to Saladin's message to the King. We're going to get King Richard to kill Robin Hood. I am the envoy of his Royal Highness Prince Saladin, rightful ruler of these lands. Master of the Ayyubid dynasty. Yeah? And I'm the King of England. Thank you, Carter. Keep still. Take him to the King's tent. Quartermaster, tell him three dozen breast plates by sundown. - Where is your King? - I rule from the front line. That's why your Prince will never defeat me. I admire Aristotle. I prefer Plato. You have the password. Speak. My Prince has considered your calls for peace. He promises nothing, but he is prepared to talk. My Prince agrees to meet you, man to man, alone in the desert. Where? Outside Emius. The town ruined by your Crusaders. - When? - Today. Noon. Your Majesty... Is this wise? My Prince knew it, you do not want peace. Wait! I'll be there. My Prince offers you a gift. As a sign of his goodwill. - What gift? - The gift of life. Leave us. There are men in your country who would want to kill you. Tell him thank you, but I know about the Black Knights. - They know you know. - I will deal with them when I return. That is why they have recruited your most loyal servant to come here. Who? He is a man that you would trust with your life and he travels with a Saracen woman. He will offer to protect you and then, when your guard is down... he will slit your throat. - This meeting. I'll come with you. - No! Your Majesty, to meet Saladin alone, unprotected... Sometimes, peace requires more bravery than war. Have you thought about what I said? You are a decent man, Guy. You're not a killer. Turn against the Sheriff. This is your chance. Your last chance to be a good man. Good chat with Marian? Anything you want to tell me? No. She wants me to kill you. And are you going to? No. What was her suggestion? Oh, I would kill you, she would vouch for me. The King would reward me. I would still win power and I would also win- Marian. But you chose me. My Lord, I demonstrated my loyalty. Now I'd like your blessing. - For what? - I will still have Marian. When we return to England, I will take her by force. Dear boy, I'll sing at your wedding. There. Your King's camp. Shukran, Bassam. Does he understand flight, the pale one? Who? Yes, I think he does. You have my blessing. My name is Robin of Locksley and these are my friends, the King's loyal subjects. More than that. My master and I served in his Private Guard. We have urgent business with the King. - Saving his life, actually. - John, look, the King's tent. Ut Prosim! - Our motto. Latin. - What does it mean? That was us. Good days. Well, not good. Death and destruction and all that, but you know. - Ut prosim, lads. - Robin! Carter! I thought you'd given up fighting? I'm still fighting, but for peace. Looks like we're finally making progress. Robin of Locksley. - Your Majesty. - Up. I should bow before you, friend. Come. Robin. Your Majesty, I bring grave news. - You received my messages, Itrust? - I did. You'll know the Sheriff of Nottingham and the Black Knights are plotting against you. They are planning to take over England. That's what you said. I believe you. But now the Sheriff is coming here. To find you and kill you. Really? - You have to let me to protect you. - I must allow you to protect me? Yes. - Oh, Robin. Of all people, you? - Your Majesty? Of all who have served me, you were the one I loved most. I cherished that. When I sent you home, I was sending a piece of me and you would represent me. In a small way, I think I have. - Robin, stop it. I know the truth. - What truth? Your Majesty, you are in danger. Why? Have I not done right by you? Yes, you have... and I've come here to save you! Still you deny it? You have come here to murder your King! Your Majesty, no. I can vouch for Robin. - When I was in England... - Quiet! You are a renowned marksman with the bow, are you not? I am. Then you could have killed my enemies a thousand times over. You would travel to the Holy Land instead of aiming an arrow in Nottingham? Your Majesty, we couldn't just shoot the Sheriff, we can... - ******** - ********* Assemble the men. Execute them. - Happiness? - Happiness. He'll attend the meeting? And watch out, watch out, there's a Hood about? Come to Daddy! So Karim, dear boy, you know what to do? What if King Richard knows what Prince Saladin looks like? Well, no matter. You're not stopping for a chat, are you? Gisborne. Something I need to do... Go with. Mercy, Your Majesty! Ut prosim! Your Majesty. These people are innocent. If you must take a life, take mine, spare them. At last. That's the Robin I remember. - Considering others. - He is still the Robin you remember. He saved your life! Don't you remember that? I cannot grant your wish. You must all be punished. But you once saved my life and no, I've not forgotten that. So, I'll not take yours. I'll let the desert decide! The desert? What does that mean? Decide what? This is the same as execution. Yes. But if God wills it, there is always a chance. I'll not remember you this way, Robin. I'll remember you as the hero who once saved my life. And I'll remember you as the King who spent too long at war. It has clouded your judgment. You've forgotten your people back home. You're right. It is time to stop this fighting. I am meeting Saladin. Today. I will make peace with him. And then I will go home to England. Good. At least my friends and I will have achieved something. Goodbye. Good chicken. I owe you a debt of gratitude, young lady. Thanks to you, I know that Guy is loyal. Because if you can't turn him with your pretty little head, then nobody can. Your heart must be the coldest place on earth. Are you a little disappointed that he told me about your offer? I'm surprised it took you so long, to be quite honest with you. I was really getting rather bored. - Now I've served my purpose. - You tried to kill me! Did you think I'm going to let that pass? Robin Hood did not die in Nottingham. Did you know this? Huh? Well, then. just as a treat, you can die together. This is good. - How long? - In this heat... without water... I'm sorry, my love. I should have made you stay with Bassam. I would never leave you, Will Scarlett. If we can just get through the nightfall, then, you know... - Then what? Then... - It'll be cooler. - Cooler. It'll be freezing! I know, but it won't be hot. This heat... Much, we do not have till nightfall. You know I love you all. john, Djaq, Will. Even you, Allan. Robin. Master. When I was sewing the King, I was sewing you. When I think of England, I think of you. Marian? Marian. I see something. I can really see something... coming! - He's right. - Help! - Help us... - Help! Help! They've seen us. - God is smiling on us! - Or Allah! Whichever God it is, I love him! It's the Sheriff. There is no God. You see, that's the trouble with foreign travel. You run into all the same people you see at home! Your leper friend. I understand you've met my colleague, james? We meet again. You let the Black Knights buy you? The pennies of the poor put to good use! james. You're revolting. Get off me! Ah, a revolt is when the people rise up against their leader. Now, I'm not revolting, I am couping. Plotting a sudden and decisive change of leader. What about murder? Ah, well, if the King will wander out into the desert alone, unarmed, ready to meet his enemy... The King wants peace. You're killing a man who's trying to make peace. Yes, and life is usually so much fairer. Let Marian go. She's got nothing to do with this. She has everything to do with this. All along, we thought we had a spy in your camp! But you had one in ours. You see, there will always be people who work for me, because I fight for justice. But this... This one is a special one. You were still hoping, weren't you? That after all this you would end up as man and wife back home in sunny Sherwood? So... now you have your bride. I'd love to stay, but I don't tan well. Do excuse us, we have a King to kill. Come along, james. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, too. - We fought and we lost. - But at least we will have died trying. I want to die in England. - In Sherwood. - Come on, john. Today is a good day to die. You're always saying it. Today is NOT a good day to die! I want to die in the arms of my wife... with my son, john, by my side... John, you're dying for England, even if you're not there. Not being funny, it's the King of England who put us here in the first place. The Sheriff's spun him a story! The moment we arrived here we were marked men. It's not the King's fault. Say the words, then, handsome. What words? I, Robin, take you, Marian. Now? Now is a good time, I think. We are in the company of the best witnesses England has to offer. I, Robin... take you, Marian, to be my lawful wedded wife. To have and to hold, for better or for worse... for richer, or for poorer... In sickness... In sickness or in health... to love and to cherish... 'till death do us part. I, Marian, take you, Robin of Locksley, master of the bow, champion of the poor and lord of my heart, to be my lawful wedded husband. I promise to love and to cherish you... for better or for worse, from this day forward, as long as we both shall live. Much, don't cry! He's not crying. He's laughing on the wrong side of his face. Carter! I thought you'd left us. Sorry. Out here, you can lose your head. - I thought I didn't like you. - I know. - I do now! - I knew we'd find you... We have horses. We have weapons. Then we have the King to rescue. Come on! - We are Robin Hood! - What? - We'll explain it later. - No! Everybody say it. We are Robin Hood. Say it! - We are Robin Hood! - We are Robin Hood! The desert decided. Where have you been? You nearly missed the show. - Delhi belly. - Where's Marian? She's, er... tied up. This is good, this is very good. - I am not really Saladin! - I am not really King Richard! - It's Robin Hood! - You should be dead. Many times over, my friend, many times. Now do you believe us? I betrayed your loyalty. How can I repay you? Actually... I know this is not the time, Your Majesty, but there is a little place in Nottingham called Bonchurch... Much! Sorry, forget about it. He needs us. Marian! - Robin. Forgive me. - I already have. Let's finish this now. After them! It's not too late, we can still get the King. You two, over there. Gisborne with me. This is a trap. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Where's the King? - Went after the Sheriff. We need to get him out of here now! Keep them pinned down. I'll go round the back. Quickly. You must get out of here. Leave them to me. This is not right. Split up. Come on. Long live the King! No. Bye-bye, Blondie. We meet again! Guy! Stop! - It's over, Guy! - Get out of the way. All this time, I've been fighting for England. You think I'm going to let you kill England? - Marian, get out of the way! - You'll have to kill me first. No, we're going to get out of this. I'm going to do this thing. And then I will have power beyond measure. And we will be together. I would rather die than be with you, Guy of Gisborne. I'm going to marry Robin Hood. I love Robin Hood. I love Robin Hood. Marian! No! Gisborne! It's not over, Hood! I will have England! The King? Where's the King? He's all right. Marian, he's all right. You saved him. How's it looking down there? Am I beyond even Djaq's amazing talent? Hang on. We'll think of something. Well, can you at least get this out of me. It hurts... Marian. Marian, we can't take it out just yet. Why? Why? Will I die when it comes out? Then we haven't got much time, my darling. We have for ever, my love. I hope we have for ever in heaven because we didn't have enough time on earth. Not nearly enough time. - We were busy. - We were fighters and I am proud. - You keep fighting for me, Robin. - I can't fight without you. I'd love to argue with you, but we haven't got the time. You promise me, you keep fighting. I will. Now, where were we? What? The last time we were dying, we were getting married. Can we carry on, please? I can't remember. That's the last time I marry you, if you can't remember! Robin. I, Robin, take you, Marian, to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish, 'till death do us part. I, Marian, take you, Robin, beautiful, beautiful lord of Locksley, to be my wedded husband. I promise to love you and to cherish you, on earth and especially in heaven... for now and forever. Till death do us part. Kiss me. No. Give me the ring first. Make an honest woman of me, Robin. You may kiss the bride. - I love you, my husband. - I love you, my wife. That's better. Marian? Marian? You take care. Robin. Will and I are... You're staying. Ma salama, Robin. - Come here. Look after her. - Thank you. Robin. You've saved my life. Now go home and grieve your loss. Now, Your Majesty, for every man there is a purpose which he sets up in his life. Let yours be the doing of all good deeds. The Koran. Then do those deeds in my name. You are my representatives in England. You are King Richard. - And you? - Us? We are Robin Hood! Yes. - We are Robin Hood! - We are Robin Hood! Come on, lads.
