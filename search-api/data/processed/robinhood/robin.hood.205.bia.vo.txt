- Allan... You knew I'd kill him. You Just didn't want to admit it to yourself. - You're low. - Yeah. And YOU are here for more money. So what do you want to tell me? You've got a messenger. Henry of Lewes, arriving tomorrow, right? - How do you know that? - He's coming to tell you where and when the King plans to land when he returns to England. But there's going to be an ambush tomorrow on the North Road. If you want Henry to make it to Nottingham, you better change his route. - Hey, hey, hey! What do you call this? - Noon tomorrow. Gold. IF Henry arrives. He's not coming. - He's been tipped off. - By who? Don't worry, he's probably just late. Horse needs shoeing or he's stopped for a kip or something. He's here to betray the King! He's hardly going to stop for a nap! - Could Marian have got the time wrong? - That's a good point actually. No, cos Marian's trying to listen at keyholes and stuff, right? She could be making all kinds of mistakes. She could be making a BIG mistake. Go back to the camp and stay there. - Robin... - What? That's an order. Robin... - My Lord. - What do you think? Hastings? Portsmouth? Which south coast port will King Richard make his final, fateful landing at? We'll know soon enough. Henry's here. - As I promised. - Well done, Gisborne. Well done. Ah, Henry... Henry of Lewes. Welcome to my... Get me my physician! Get the Sheriff's physician immediately. - Why did you let the messenger through? - Has he talked? No, not yet. He was taken ill. Robin, I took a risk to find out his route and you still let him through? - You can't go back into the castle. - What? Go to the forest. Now. I'll Join you when I've silenced Henry. The forest? Don't be ridiculous! You told me he'd travel by the North Road. - Yes. - And he didn't. Marian, I think I have a spy in my gang. 00:03:53,700 --> 00:56,800 Sub Wood Team Moochie & Kiry What are you going to do? I'll silence Henry. And then I'll find the traitor in my own camp and silence him. None of your men have been in the castle. I would have seen them. Then somebody's going out to meet them. - I'll keep watch. - No, you'll keep out of it. - No! - Marian, this is none of your business. The King's being betrayed right now because of your spy. - It IS my business. - But what if the spy has told them - about you and the night-watchman? - Then I'm dead anyway. What are you doing, Blight? He's worse. - He's calmer. - Calmer? - You're calming him to death. - Medicine is a Journey, my lord. Not a destination. Treatments take as long as... Do you seriously think I've got time for your journey, Blight? A clue! Gisborne. You find me a quack who knows what he's doing. A quack? Sheriff, I am a man of learning. I give you science... Science? You have given me silence. I want this man to talk. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? I know you're angry. You're angry because Henry of Lewes got past us, but you can't Just run off. Much, you disobeyed my instructions. I said wait at the camp. Gisborne has outwitted us. So what? His luck will run out. It has to. Otherwise we'll be asking where he's getting his information from. What? You think he's getting information? From one of us? No. Master, surely some mistake. A traitor? Who? That's why you've sent us back to camp. Because you suspect. - You suspect me? - Much, I have to suspect everyone. That's me. You suspect me. Much, go back to the camp! What do I have to do to prove my loyalty to you? What? Tell me. What? I'd chop off my own arms! Well, one arm, because once I've chopped that off I wouldn't be able to chop off the other. If you're true to me, I ask Just one thing. - You name it. - Go back to the camp. Come, come, come. There you go. This baby's Just like his mother. Doesn't know up from down. - Again? Oh, again. - Don't you bother yourself. - I'll turn him the right way up. - How do you know it's a boy? Because I know. - But it hurts. - Hurts? You don't know pain. Try giving birth to him feet-first. Then you'll know what pain is. Bring her medicines, everything. - Sheriff wants your services. - Get off me! My daughter! Your daughter can wait. Mother! - Mother! - You hairy pig-witted fox turd! I'll pluck your eyeballs from your bony skull and squelch them into cess pits! - Mother! - Rosa! Speak... Speak, speak, speak. - Get off me! - Keep still, woman! Oh, you slimy little snot-head! Matilda... Blight! Ha! It's the gravedigger's best friend. The maggot's mate! Couldn't you find a civil-tongued wise woman? Apparently she's the one the civil-tongued wiser men go to. Hello, baldy! Do you know who I am? I'm the Sheriff. And I have a job for you. If you were on fire, I would not damp you with my wet underwrappings. Cure this man or you die. Anyone that you love and even some that you have a passing liking for. I can't stay here! My daughter's expecting a baby. Your daughter can expect a corpse for a mother if you do not do as you are told! Well, I won't stay if she lays one finger on my patient! If I treat him, can I go? Do you think I want you cluttering up my castle? When he speaks, fetch me. Immediately. We'll get rid of these things, for starters. Sir, there's a sign at the Trip Inn. Marian. Where's your guard? I don't know. I must have lost him. - Watch Lady Marian. - Is that really necessary? I don't know. Is it? Do you think I'm a threat? No. I was wondering if I could have a day away from the castle and the guards and accompany you. - I'm on business. - Sounds interesting. Marian, it's private. - Sounds doubly interesting. - Marian. - No. - Very well. But at least let me have a day unchaperoned. - You're up to something? - Yes! I'm charming you so that I can have an hour or two without a goon on my back! But you stay in the castle. Did somebody order leeches? Haven't I seen enough bloodsuckers for one day? Mostly in charge! Lovely specimens. Hungry. Let's take a look. Robin of Locksley. Mmm, what's that beard? It's neither grown nor shaven. Make up your mind. Hey, Matilda! - Has this man talked? - No. You can't treat him. Good. Get me out of this dung heap. My Rosa has a baby on the way. A boy I'd wager, by the trouble he's caused. Twice turned himself upside down. You were worse, I seem to remember. This will relax her while I turn him. Come on, let's go. - I have business here first. - She needs me now. - Do you know anything about this man? - Yes, he was stung by a bee. Look. What, this unwell? From a bee sting? Well, it can happen. It nearly killed him. That and the leeches. - But he's all right now. - Wait! His name is Henry of Lewes. Now he's come to tell the Sheriff where the King plans to land when he returns to England. - So you should turn away. - Stop! Has a dung beetle tunnelled through your ear and eaten your soul? I'll be quick. A bee failed to kill him, a quack failed to kill him, I'll be damned if a boy I delivered sneaks in - and finishes off one of my patients. - Matilda! I can't let him live to speak his treason. So it's not his life you're afraid of then, it's his tongue. So? Shall we just cut out his tongue then? Oh, men! Always think in a straight line. - I've got a better idea. - Can you silence him? Long enough for you to think of something better than killing him, yes. I can muddle his brain for a day or two. Confuse and baffle him. Now... Oh, sorry! - Well? - Hasn't been in yet. Must be held up. When he finally arrives, give him this for delivering Henry. Tell him it's silver not gold, because the goods were damaged. Thank you. He's waking. - Matilda, quickly. - Where am I? - What is it? - Here. It's mead. Right, Job done, let's go. I have to know that it's worked. Do you want the sun and the stars as well? He mustn't talk! If we spare his life then we sacrifice the King's. Look lively, you pair of oafs! Is he awake? Henry! Mead! Horrible! Henry? My dear, Henry! Castle. Yes, yes, this is Nottingham Castle. I've come from the Holy Land. - Yes. - I'll speak only to the Sheriff. Yes, yes. I am the Sheriff. The Sheriff of Nottingham. - The King... - Yes, which port will he arrive at? When the King returns from the Holy Land... Yes, yes, yes, where will he land? - What's the King's plan? - He will land... I feel strange. I feel... Yes, never mind how you feel, Henry. What's the King's plan? The plan King's. Planking. Port. - Yes, yes, which port? - Pork. I have come from the holy pork. - Which port? - Pork. Holy pork. - There's someone there! - Guards! Get this to Rosa. Get out of here, you rancid-faced outlaw! Don't stand on him, you idiots! Get him up, get him on the bed! Gently, gently, gently. Which port? Which port? Robin! Henry? He's silenced, but only temporarily. You're right, you have a spy. - How do you know? - I followed Gisborne to the Trip Inn. Whoever he was meeting didn't come. A serving maid knew him and he left money with her. I heard them mention Henry but I couldn't hear other names. That's payment for Henry's arrival. Who is it, Marian? Who would betray me? There's Gisborne. Marian! - Guy. - You've been following me. - Me? - Don't deny it. - No, I... - I saw you by the stall earlier. Now here. Coincidence? - I was only... - I don't think so. - You disobeyed me. - Guy, please. Let me explain. You don't understand. Punish me but do not punish my father. Punish you? Why would I punish you? What have you been doing? Forgive me, you're right. I disobeyed you. I Just wanted to spend time with you. - Really? - Yes. Well, I'm honoured, Marian, but I told you I was on business. Well, it won't happen again. Shall we...? What's your problem? Eh? - Did you speak to Robin then, or what? - Why do you want to know? We want to know what's going on. What's the plan? Did the messenger get through to the castle? - Is Robin going to kill him? - Like to know his plans, do you? What's the Sheriff and Gisborne's plan? - What? - I mean, is there even a Henry? - Or is it a trap? - What? - What's going on? - How much do they pay you? Pay who? There's a spy! In the camp. One of you is a spy and Robin knows. So you're done for. What? - How does he know? - It's obvious! Gisborne's always five or six steps ahead of us. - Are you calling me a traitor? Well... Traitor? - What you looking at me for? - Well, you're the one who tried to persuade me to steal from Robin. - We thought the King was coming... - That's right! - We thought about it. - We decided against it. - I said no! - Allan. Stop it, now! Yes. If anyone's going to kill the traitor, - it's going to be me. - What makes you so high and mighty? He doesn't trust you either. Or why has he sent you back here? - Ah! - Stop it the pair of you. Off him, stop it! Robin. Master! - What is going on? - We're taking her to the camp. What, our camp? - This is Rosa. Matilda's daughter. - So much for it being a secret. So much for a lot of things being secret. Djaq, the baby's the wrong way round. Do you know how to turn it? - Let's get you to a bed, shall we? - You don't, do you? Get on with it! Your majesty. He's not the King! Mother! His brain! Bled to dried pig skin by his leeches. She's poisoned him! Rubbish. I haven't given him anything. I hate to tell tales, but I've asked around, and rumour has it that she delivered the baby Robin into this world. Pig. Canker. Blight by name, blight by nature. Help, help! There's someone there. Oh, nice try. - You poisoned him, didn't you? - No. I Just gave him something to help him sleep. Well, you can give him something to wake him up, can't you? No. There are wrong answers and there are right answers. That was a wrong answer. We need to know who the traitor is. I'm sorry. It's not the sort of secret I can keep. - Let's just deal with Rosa first. - Tell us, Robin! Robin, there'll be people like Rosa who need our help, but if we're not a gang, - if you suspect us... - All right, it's true. One of you is betraying us. You're meeting Gisborne and you're selling our secrets. - Not me. - It's not me either. - It's not me. Not me. Not me. - Stop this now. If the guilty man or woman confesses, right here, I'll listen. Tell me what Gisborne said, what he offered. Step forward now. You have one chance. I will not be treated with equal suspicion! Well, whoever you are... you've made your choice. And I will find you out. John... - Help me turn the baby. - No. I have worked in the battlefield. All men. - I have never treated this before. - Neither have I. May I? - Oh! - What? It's the head! Hello, little one. Hello. The wrong way round. You need to turn, baby. - It moved. - That's it! That's right! How did you do that? Thank you. Thank you. My lords, Matilda here somehow managed to bring a patient of hers back from the dead. Certified by my good self - dead. So, what do we have here? Do we have a healer? What's happening? Or do we have something else? A necromancer? A devil worshipper? A witch? - She's not a witch! - So, perhaps a ducking in Locksley Pond would calm all our nerves. Guy, you know she's not a witch! Marian, say nothing. These allegations spread by association. The ducking stool's a death sentence. You know that. There's nothing you can do for her. Did I leave you to die when you were being drowned? Guy. Guy! You could avoid this, Matilda. Tell us the antidote. Boiled Sheriff's brains with parsley. To Locksley! Djaq? Later. Are you all right? There's a spy in the camp, how can anything be all right? Well, he probably knows he's made a mistake now. He had his chance to confess. Maybe he's stuck. People get stuck, you know? Your brother said he was stuck. He refused to change and he hanged for it. - He was an idiot. - No. He was a good man underneath it. And you saw that. And I believe Robin would see it too. If the spy confessed... and begged forgiveness and changed his ways... I believe you're a good man, Allan A Dale. Robin! Robin! - Robin! - Matilda! The Sheriff knows she helped you. She's refusing to tell them how to wake Henry and they're ducking her. - When? - Now, at Locksley Pond. Call your men, I have to go before I'm missed. Robin! The baby's coming. - Baby? - It's Matilda's grandchild. Robin. Hurry, hurry! Matilda needs us. Djaq, you stay with Rosa. Everybody else with me. Now. - What's happened? - The Sheriff's happened. John, can you stay? Has he said anything sensible yet? - Lords, ladies, peasants. - Presents. Pheasants? Have a look at this noble man. He returned from the dead, possessed! The witch shall be ducked. If she dies, it proves the devil has abandoned her, and she shall be buried on consecrated ground. Constipated ground. If she lives, showing the devil still to be in her... she shall be burnt alive! Hard to know which one to hope for. Rosa! My Rosa! Down she goes. Deep breath. Oh, lovely grapes, Gisborne. You weasel-faced whore's son! Who, Robin? No, Robin's not here! And three, two, one! Deep breath, deep breath. There's something... - What's happening? - It's fine. Your husband, is he away? - The wars. - He'd be so proud of you. What's your wife's name? Alice. So you've done this before, with Alice? - No. - Why is it so hard? No, I was an outlaw in the forest. Alice was alone. Push now. # Pom, pom, pom. # I curse you! May snakes crawl up your nose holes and feed on your tiny brain! Down, down! Breathe slowly. It's going to be difficult to take him. Henry. Can't we just kill him? No, draw attention to Robin, won't we? Put him in danger. We bide our time, wait until they're distracted. Unless one of you two's informed Gisborne. - Keep your accusations to yourself! - You keep pumping! Let's lift up the carcass. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... and a half, one... and a half, and bring up! What the devil is that, Blight? I suspect they may be her underwrappings, my Lord. Shut up! Shut up! Arrest, arrest! Gisborne! Henry's gone, Gisborne! Henry's gone. Guards, find him! Rosa, where's my Rosa? Rosa? Mother? Where's the little lad? - Tell me the lad's all right. - No lad. No lad? She's a girl ! Good lungs, she has. Not a moment's peace! Well, let's see if her damp grandmother can't set her off again. Hey, my little... What's her name? Alice. I'm going to call her Alice. Alice. Still in the land of fairies. What are you going to do with him? - I'll banish him. - We should kill him. A traitor to the King doesn't deserve to live. Oi, Much. Look! Much, meet Alice! - Put him down, Henry! - They say you don't kill any more. - For the King, I kill. - The King's finished. The Sheriff, Prince John and the Black Knights, they'll win. Robin... Not today, they won't. Can I trust you, Will? Of course. - I need your help. - Anything. Marian saw a serving maid speaking to Gisborne. At the Trip. She'll know who our spy is. I can go to the Trip, find the maid and make her tell me who the traitor is. - You go back to the camp at sundown. - Where am I going? This is gonna hurt. What's he doing? - Robin! - Master! Sundown, remember? I knew it was him. I knew it was him. - Will? - No! I knew it! Robin... Will's the spy. - This subject's closed. - Will, Robin, I do not believe! - I need to speak with you. - Not now. - Believe me Robin, I need... - No you don't, Djaq! Trust me! Will's gone. And that's the end of it. I have to go to the castle. I think he had a go-between. - At the castle? - Yes, at the Trip. Marian saw a serving girl receiving money from Gisborne. I have to meet Marian to find out exactly what Gisborne knows... - We'll come. - No, no. I'm safer on my own. Meanwhile, you lot have to scatter, until I find out whether Gisborne knows about the camp. I'll go to the Trip at sundown. Come back here after that. I'll tell you what I know. What are we going to do? You heard him. We scatter. You're late. I was going to keep your money back. Silver. Not gold. You're going to tell Gisborne to keep this money. I'm not doing this any more, right? I've changed. It's a bit late for a conscience, isn't it? Yeah. Very late. Robin... You're early. Leave us. - Stay there. - Get out! I need to talk... to my spy. What was that with Will? - You banished Will. - It was an act! Only she knew who was guilty. And I knew the spy would want to come here before me to cover his tracks. For all I knew, it could have been Will standing there. But it's not, is it? It's you. Robin, it was over. You ask her. - I made a decision. - Then what's this? I was giving it back! So you betray me. You betray yourself, you betray your King. For what? For a few silver coins? What have you told Gisborne, Allan? Nothing really. - Does he know about the camp? - No! Does he know about Marian? No! - More lies? - No! This was the last time, I promise. And I was wrong. But he captured me, Robin. He tortured me, I had no choice. Everything is a choice! Everything we do. That's easy for you to say though, isn't it? You get the glory, you get the girl. Everyone loves you. Then when the King comes back, you'll have land, property, a wife. Everything. What will I have? You're always in the sun, Robin. And I'm always in the shade. Is that meant to be an excuse? Give me another chance, please. I wouldn't let Gisborne hurt any of us. I've never told him anything like that. Harmless lies? Innocent betrayals? They don't exist, Allan. Robin, I've changed. How can I get you to believe that? You can't. And the funny thing is... - you might be telling the truth. - I am! How am I supposed to believe you any more? Robin, I swear to you on my life! Don't kill me. Please. You're lucky I've left you with a life to swear upon. Never, never let me set eyes on you again. Are we safe? Will! - Will? - It's all right. It's all right. It wasn't him. What? It was a trap. I lied to you, I'm sorry. I had to lure the spy. It was Allan. Is he alive? - Where? - He's gone. Allan, why? For money, John. Why else? I believe he could have changed. - You knew it was him? - I didn't know. I guessed. I knew it was him. I knew it was Allan. Will, you forgive me? - It worked. - And the rest of you? Travellers on the North Road. Right. Are you with me? Yeah? Well then, let's go. - What are we celebrating? - The signing of an important document. This is a Traitor's Charter. The Sheriff is making the Black Knights sign their allegiance. If you love peace, do not sign. - It'll cost you Sussex. - I have lost Sussex! I am Sir Guy's man. - Traitor!
