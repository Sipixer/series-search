It was a footwear ||feeding frenzy. |||| (shrieking and shouting) || I saw it f||st! || (screams)|| You just made the list, bitch! So many questions.|| Firstly, w||t do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots? || You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress? || Well, that's the po||t: it's to hide that||act || that I h||en't shaved my legs. || I've begun a strict no-shave policy |||| ||for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I mu|| behave. || FYI: It doesn't matter, baby. Guys just want to get ||on the green. They don|'t mind going through the rough. || Shh-clackey! (phone ringing) Stinson. All right, the beers are here. || BARNEY:||Yeah, we're not go to make it. Oh, come on! We agreed... || Did Marshall take his pants off? Yeah, pants are off.

I was super-wasted. |||||| These are not all for me. || No, I was going to call you, but I was so embarrassed. || You were embarrassed? I was like, "I really like this guy, "and now I'm ||imbing out his window, || ||and I forgot my underwear..." || God, I thought they felt kind of tight. I'm ki||ing. I don't wear underwear.|| || Ladies' underwear. |||| Often. Ah! Again, I'm ||dding. || I'm so glad I ran into you. I know. Do you want to...? Trudy?! || No way! || ||Oh, my God!

Respect. ||So, we're hitting it off and then her f||end shows up and they're kind of compet||ive.|| I think the new girl's kind of into me. So you now have two on the line? And I don't know which one to go for. Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove. New girl? Wh|| new girl? Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections, and I think... Oh, you don'||kn|| what you'|| talking about. Give it to me. ||Are they friends? Yeah. Uh, no-- I-I d||'t know. ||They're old sorority sisters. ||Are they Betas?

Okay, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD, Barney. || (gasping) || What are you doing?! || I cannot allow Ted to do this. |||| Wh-what? Why? Because the belt is my birthright! ||You cannot claim it before I do. || That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luth|| || while Superman watches ||impotently from the bedroom. But, B||ney, you|'ve done||||way dirtier |||||||| You're disgusting. I've never ridden the tricycle. ||||||I was on the verge last year. || I was so close.

Ye|| it is! Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. ||||Where's my coat? || Why would you do that to yourself? Because you get up in your head, man. Yo||start thinking, "I can't do this. It's two women." || That's two of everything, four of some things. The ||gistics alon||are enough to cripple even a pro like me. Se|| if a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have? || The best chance in the world. |||||||||||| ||Fear took the belt from me. |||||||| Fear rode th||tricycle that night, my friends. |||||| ||But fear will not get a second turn. || It won't?
