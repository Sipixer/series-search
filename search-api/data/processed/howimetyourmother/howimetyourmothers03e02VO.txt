"let this letter be a small beacon, "a tiny firefly to help light your way "through the years ahead. "my love for you persists "higher than the himalayas. deeper than a scottish loch."

(sighs) and that's all i remember until the hospital. that guy. yeah. that guy. look at how easy he has it. you and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. but that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. and why? he's better looking than us. no. because he's from out of town. mmm. with and accent and an innocent smile, you don't even have to try. yeah. plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. god, i wish we were tourists. yeah. actually... you know where i've been meaning to visit? (camera shutter clicking) okay, okay, we're from a small town in the south of france. our plane leaves sunday morning. (with southern accent): uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. hate to bother you. we seem to be a little bit lost. would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on? actually, it's on its own island. oh! oh, it's right... ah. thank you very... uh, my name is, uh, ignatius peabody nobel. from east westerton, missouri. and this is my friend, ted. hi, um, i'm colleen. hi, colleen. this is lindsay. hi, lindsay. so, hey, you-you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. what do you say... ah, never mind. no... no, what is it? well... it's just we're leaving sunday morning. it sure would be nice to have some real new yorkers show us around. yeah. well, we're busy tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? after lunch? well, hotdog! should we... you want to just meet here in front of mac... maclaren's pub? it's kind of a lame bar, but sure. really? it doesn't seem that lame to me. it's pretty lame. i think it's cool. we'll see you tomorrow. barney: all right. i'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would ng out at. okay, all right. so, gael, huh? mmm. still going strong? yeah, it's great. amazing, fantastic, awesome. ooh, that's one too many. what's going on? well, now that i'm home, i'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that i loved on vacation. here, taste. experience your food. oh. so good. here, taste. experience your food. ooh, sofa, ooh, sofa. sofa, sofa, oh. (grunts) ooh. we're alone now. i must have you. (laughs) (moans) ooh. i must have you. laptop, laptop, laptop! (sighs) and you know what else? i'm still finding sand everywhere. i mean, we haven't been to the beach since argentina. where is all coming from? well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip. but i don't want to. i was so happy down there. no, you know what? i'm done complaining. i'm evolving. just gonna go with the flow. wow. gael, you're peeing while i'm in the shower. okay. okay, old robin would have been like, dude, ocupado.</i> but now, you know what, i'm cool with it. pee it up. in fact, when you're done, why don't you come in here and join me? don't mind if i do, love. (screams) gael, there's some weird du... hello. hey! good news! i made some new traveling friends today, and they'll be staying with us, how do you say... indefinitely! all: g'day! bp ooh, here. will you sign this thank you note? wow. both sides. you wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box. wow, that's... it's a really nice blender. well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it. i can't. i married you. that's how we go the blender. what's wrong? nothing. nothing's wrong. what could be wrong? except that when you die i'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were "cancel vogue." how can you open my letter? that was not a letter. it was barely even a text message. next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme. marshall, wait. this was our first fight as a married couple. oh, baby. oh... oh. kids, there are a thousand amazing places you can find</i> only in new york city. instead of any of those, colleen and lindsay took us here.</i> colleen: this is our favorite restaurant</i> in the city. yes, i'm sure this is the best of their 57 "spudtacular" east coast locations. i'm going to run to the restroom. i'm gonna go, too. (growls) (ted groans, barney laughs) this is the easiest date ever. you know what i'm gonna try next? a knock, knock joke. easiest? somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time. ted, ted, ted. dude, i am looking at you. what? right. stay with me. we are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. ay-o. all right, ignatius, one more hour. nice. nice. hey, nice. hey... hey, our friends invited us to a party. you guys want to come along? knock, knock. who's there? yes, we do. (all laughing) (cheering on television) quick announcement. i am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. a couple rules-- not even rules. let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. guideline for harmonious living number one-- the kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. g.f.h.l. number two-- marijuana is illegal in the united states, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a tv newscaster. "this just in: look at my hand, how weird is my hand?" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. and number three, i... (all cheering) and number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. i have to take a nap. i'm still pretty baked. (gasps) everything's so bright, even at night. no wonder the city never sleeps. (barney and women laughing) hey, if we're going north, why did we cross over the fdr? we should have taken the hudson. (scoffing): now he knows all the streets. someone's been watching too many steinfeld reruns.</i> (women laughing) (laughs sarcastically) where are we even going anyway? 148th and brook avenue. a hundred-- in the south bronx at this time of night? we're going to get killed. ted, i think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. we're in very capable hands. (siren wails) there were three of them, at least two guns-- they took all oumoney. well, i only had traveler's checks. hey, babe. i've been thinking about our fight. yes? i'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet. wow, you really want to open this up again. oh, i forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until i'm dead. you know that this is important to me. why won't you just write the letter? because i can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter. really? yes, really. plus, i know as soon as i write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again. lily, i won't, i promise. okay. i'll write you a letter for my death folder. do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too? i tell you what. how about i make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff? you're the best. and maybe a couple polaroids? come on, let's get out of here. this night's a disaster. what?! this night couldn't have gone any better. we just survived a mugging. you know what that means. "thank god we're alive" sex. "thank god we're alive" sex. it's even better than "i can't believe you just proposed to me" sex, which i've only had, like, four or five times. ted, please, we are so close. all right, i'm in. i've never worked this hard for anything in my life. whew! wow, i think we all need to go back to our place and recover. yeah. i just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. you know? mm-hmm. me, too. so where do you live? what, west village? close. west orange. west orange, new jersey? yeah. you guys live in new jersey, not new york? theodore. yep. new jersey? teddy. yeah, but don't worry, it's pretty much new york. ted: oh. no. oh, no. oh, no. new jersey is not "pretty much new york." you are not "pretty much new yorkers." and how would you know? because i live here. that's right, i live here. yes, we're full of crap. yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. but you know what's even worse than that? saying you're a new yorker when you're not. because this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. so why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to "pretty much new york"? because i will do a lot to get laid, but i am not going to new jersey! (huffs) (in accent): you're not from missouri? well, i will be a monkey's unc... ew. right. can we get a ride? hey, um, sir, can we get a ride, too? newark, born and raised. (drumming) (sighs) can you please keep it down? (sighs) what happened to you, man? you said you wouldn't change, but look at you. no more tan, no more beaded braids, no more lush, untamed forest of leg and armpit hair. you're back at work. what gives? well, i have to have a job. "i have to have a job." god, that's so american. i'm canadian. you know that. what about the important things like making your own jewelry and lying on the beach and thinking about peace? god, don't you care about thinking about peace? wow. i just realized something. that you've lost your way. no, that you really suck. you're boring and me and you're getting sand everywhere. seriously, where is all the sand coming from? you're not the real me. all you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up. don't you remember argentina? don't you want to go back? what are you doing? shh... let this happen. (robin gasps, drumming) all right, everyone out. i said everyone out! (frustrated growl) (drumming stops, panicked shouting) all right, we're leaving, we're leaving, okay. michael moore was so right about americans. i'm canadian! robin, you okay? no, i'm not. listen, gael, i need to talk to you about something. after they broke up, robin went back to being robin.</i> (sighs) welcome home, scherbatsky. oh, good to be back. although it's weird. vacation robin popped into my dream again last night. listening. this time we went all the way. tell you one thing. ->1 wñw? okay, i'm done.. but i really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. can you swear to me you won't open it? totally. what does it say? marshall, i'm serious. okay. i promise i won't, i won't open that until you're dead. (quietly): okay. and through 22 wonderful years of marriage,</i> marshall kept his promise until november 1 of last year when, sadly...</i> "busted! i knew you'd read this. you suck, marshall, you totally suck." that's it? i suck? lily. yes, you suck. you said you wouldn't read it and you did. well, you didn't keep your promise either. i don't see any dirty pictures in here. oh, fine, i'll take the dirty pictures. i don't want 'em now. what is that supposed to mean? what?! nothing. nothing. you're beautiful. i would love
