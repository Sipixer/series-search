poker world championship ring. Let's meet your host, the most powerful man on the Las Vegas strip,</i> the owner of the Nouveau Royale hotel and casino,</i> How are you? Let's meet the players. First up is the lovely Poppy Wells. Poppy brings a sizeable chip stack and quite a view</i> to the final table. And here comes the Russian playboy. I appreciate your help, Mr. Tostevin. I get paid for my services, kid. No thanks required. Get a good night's sleep. The hard work starts tomorrow, OK? In his sixth final table appearance, It is my honor to introduce to you, from Springfield, Massachusetts,</i> poker legend. After a nail-biter showdown with Ricky Nguyen to make it to this final table,</i> Here comes the rock star of the south American poker scene.</i> And last, but definitely not least, the lone amateur to make it to the final table,</i> the golden boy from Evergreen park, Illinois.</i> Where's that, you ask? No one knows.</i> This kid came out of nowhere to sweep through the early rounds</i> in a merge as chip leader. It's been 3 months since he conquered over 6,000 players to make it to this,</i> the final table of the 2009 poker world championship.</i> Ladies and gentlemen. Where is the guy? Missing. And you lot are the prime suspects in his disappearance. I'll be damned. - Never thought I'd live to see it. - See what? The day they let Cal Lightman back in Vegas. Arcadya global team Truthworteam 2x09 - Fold Equity If you don't cooperate fully with Dr. Lightman, you won't be at the final table when we go live in 32 hours. You got it? They're all yours. Professional liars. That's a treat. I think I'll start with Jake first, actually. I'd like to see his room, meet the missis. There is a time pressure here, and if anyone from the final table is involved, folks'll say the championship is rigged. I could lose all to another casino. - Worst case, I lose my gaming license. - We can't have that, can we? Here's the deal. You find Jake, get him to the final table, There's a half a million bonus in it for you. Why is he so important to you? I just told you. So what's the history with these two? Ellis had Lightman banned from Vegas. The entire city? Cal won a lot of money from some very important customers. His scientific abilities weren't considered sporting. You ban somebody from an entire city, that's personal. Well, there may have been a situation with Ellis' girlfriend at the time. Vegas doesn't bring out the best in Cal. Keep an eye on him while we're here and don't let him gamble, OK? Why? So he won't win? He wins at poker, but it's no fun for him. - What's his game? - Roulette. Unpredictable, purely driven by chance, and the worst odds in the casino. God, I miss this. Think I'll put a bet on... I did not bring you here to indulge your bad habits, and you will be stopped if you try to leave. - You don't want your mates to find out? - It's Vegas. They already know. But it's better for us if you keep a low profile. That's my cue. I'll see you suckers later. No. Where are you going? A free private plane ride to Vegas. My mama ain't raised no fool. And as far as I can tell, there's no crime here, so... I brought you here to work. Yeah, I'll work when there's something for me to do. But until then, right now I'm feeling lucky, OK? I'm not done with you yet. Say it: "But I'm done with you." Say it loud. But I'm done with you. Good. Now, take this. Put it all on double zero on the roulette. - All of it? - Yeah. The whole thing? Don't let Foster find out? All right? - Do you believe that guy? - Let's go, Lightman. Your husband is a star. Jake would never just leave us. He loves us. Please find him. I think you should call the police. If you say that's necessary, but I think you're qualified to find him yourself. This one told you not to, right? Macey didn't think it was necessary once I hired you. Here's the thing. He doesn't want the police involved because you're husband's a commodity, One he's put a lot of effort into packaging. He wants him back at the final table, but without the bad publicity. He said the police wouldn't take me seriously. People wander off in Vegas all the time, he said. Well, that bit's true... too. I just wanted us all to be clear on our motives here. There's a young man missing. Let's focus on that and not on Ellis or anything from the past. One job in Vegas isn't going to turn me back into an inveterate gambler. Of course not. But you have to understand the pull that this town has on you. - Things change. - But people don't. You're smothering. There's no smothering in Vegas. Tell me about the last time you saw your husband. Two nights ago. He'd been running practice hands for hours, and I was going to bed, and he said he had to run to the lobby and meet one of the other players. That's it. You're right. I don't think your husband would leave on his own. He loves us so much, me and the baby. Also, he loves this. You are some of the best liars in the world, right? You have to be, otherwise you wouldn't be here. I've got to tell you up front, it's not gonna be a fair fight. You can dodge all you like, but come down to it, I'm gonna win. Just ask Mason what it's like to tangle with me. It used to be a lot more fun in the old days, Cal. In my experience, a young guy like this, about to win a couple of million bucks, either finding himself in God or losing himself in a woman. - Search the bunny ranch. - The old-timer's got a point there. I'll be right back. Here. - You are a winner, my friend. - Nice work. - It was double zero? - Nah, I wasn't feeling that. I put it on 14, my mother's birthday. I told you to put it all on double zero. So you'd rather lose with your number than win with mine? - Something like that. - That makes no sense. Go back, do it again. Go on, buzz off. Let's start with you. What did you do? The kid's no threat. Why would I do anything to him? An empty chair at the table earns you an extra 500 grand, plus a better shot to win. Everyone here wins or loses millions every day. No big deal. - Vas thinks he's unbeatable. - I am. How many investors do you have? I don't need money from other people to back me. That's why I'm the best. Yeah, even after 5 vodka tonics? What does it say about you lot that an Illinois farm boy can come out here with no experience, no investors, no craft, and slaughter you? So I'm leaving work early, maybe get a pedicure on the way home. - It's good we're not in Vegas. - I can catch up on my reading. I have a date tonight. A third date. Come on. Sorry, Doug. With a girl? A human girl? You're so... Not funny. - Foster's sent us a video to score. - One file shouldn't take too long. I hope your date's patient. You feeling a little guilty there, Poppy? Am I feeling guilty? Or sad? They're quite similar, aren't they? Jake is my friend. Shouldn't I be feeling sad that he's missing? - What happened to him? - Do you miss Vegas? No, I lied. Yeah, just a little bit. - Don't tell anyone, right? - You can trust me. Tell me the truth. Can't you see the truth? You can't, can you? You can't read me and you like that. You like my poker face, Dr. Lightman? The truth. Jake's had 3 months to imagine playing at this table and everything it means. His life is gonna change. He just wanted to talk to somebody, somebody's who's gonna tell him it's all gonna be OK. He trusted you. So I met him at a little place down the strip, made him feel better for half an hour, and left. How many times in the last 3 months did you manipulate his confidence in the guise of being his friend? I wouldn't manipulate him. Excellent. That's righteous indignation. It's also total nonsense. I think you worked him. I think you'd do everything you could to convince him that winning was more of a curse than a blessing to get an advantage at the final table. I mean... It's brilliant, as far as strategies go. Maybe I shouldn't have told you. You had to. You needed me to trust you, so you shared a half-truth. A call just came in to the production phone. Go ahead, Bob. Play it back. We have Jake Hartman. We will return him for $2 million. This is a very small amount of money compared to what the casino earns.</i> We'd advise that you not tell the police.</i> We will call back in 3 hours. Mrs. Hartman, kidnapping makes this a federal case, and I've got the Las Vegas FBI field office running at full speed. Why would anyone take my husband? Most likely it's someone who knows that Mr. Ellis is willing to pay to have Jake at the final table. Mr. Ellis is going to pay? 2 million dollars? The money is being bagged as we speak. And I'll be analyzing the ransom call. We're gonna find who did this. We're gonna do everything to get your husband back. Where's Dr. Lightman? Why $2 million? I mean, Ellis is willing to pay it, but $2 million? Is that rage? But you're upset that Ellis is willing to drop 2 million to get the kid back? Is that it? How long is this gonna take? Me and my boys, we have a club opening to get to. All this guy cares about is cash and parties. - No respect for the game. - That's not true. I also care about fame. And girls. And, of course, vodka. Go lose some money. Go on, buzz off. Hello, beautiful lady. It'll never happen. She's too good for you. The way she walks, she's too good for anyone. That's not nice, poppy. Nice isn't fun. Look at that! That's what we call a macro-expression. She may as well stick her tongue down his throat. No, she wants something from him. Well, maybe she's just attracted to him. You are such an innocent. Tell me, this girl that you're dating, Where do you take her? Tonight, Luigi's. Last week, Meridiana, the week before that... No, you're doing this all wrong. How don't you know this? OK, I know a lot... About dating. You think you are getting lucky tonight, don't you? Well, you are not. 100 $ says she's dating you for the 5-star food. OK. If we're gonna bet, I want your office for one week. Well, in that case, I want your ant farm. It's a bet. I'm letting Amadeo go. No, don't do that. The ransom call is loaded with syntactical anomalies. I'd expect more use of idiom for 1 thing and it seems almost edited. I think the person we're looking for first language isn't English. I'm getting nothing from him. What are you getting - from her, other than lust? - Excuse me? She's still a suspect. She's the female equivalent of roulette. And you like the view. It's a very nice view. You're smothering again. Amadeo, wake up, wake up. You can go. Are you seriously keeping me here? Yes. You should consider that a compliment, mason. - Adios, amigos. - Adios. I'm happy to stay near Ms. Foster. Yeah, I'll bet you are. The kidnappers just called with the ransom drop. All right, let's go. That's our guy coming out with the ransom money. All right, the bag is in place. Let me get a ready from everybody. - <i>Ready.</i> - <i>Ready.</i> Ready. Listen up. The kidnappers will know notice there's surveillance cameras covering this whole area. They'll have a strategy. Keep your eyes open. Stay focused. Before I forget... You're a big winner. Congratulations. - Double zero, right? - Yeah, double zero. What number did you bet on? 23. Hey it's M. Jordan and L. James' number. What do you want me to do? I told you double zero. Listen, do you not get that I'm Mr. Lucky? Do you want to lose? You do not walk up to a roulette table and just bet it on double zero. You gotta feel it out. Nonsense. Well, this stack of money in my hand says otherwise. Hold up. What are Amadeo's boys doing here? Yelling a taxi? Oh, listen up. I did some digging. The day before Jake disappeared, Amadeo switched rooms. His new room is right next to Jake's. Amadeo's not involved in this. It looks like you just got played, doc. These have gotta be the dumbest kidnappers. Move in, move in. Get out of the cab! Freeze! FBI! Put your hands on the roof. Turn around! Put your hands on the roof! Amadeo Valdez! Open up! Open up! Put your hands up! Put your hands where I can see them! - Put your damn hands up. - What is this? You know what the hell this is. Cuff him! Why are you doing this? What? He's meticulous. Footage of the other players. He's been studying them. Fixing onto us to pick up the ransom? You're not too swift. - Who's in the next room? - Jake. I told you that already. Not that one. That one. You know what my favorite poker phrase is? I don't know. All in? Open limp? The nuts? On tilt. It's so expressive. - You want a pull. It's Amadeo's. - I don't drink. Yeah, you do. Only an amateur lets frustration Interfere with his game theory. You think? Here. Have a drink. I insist. That's right. It's water. Oldest trick in the book. But Amadeo sold you, didn't he? - He's a liar. - Yeah He's a fantastic liar, actually. When you thought he's partying next door he's wearing noise-reduction headphones, mapping out a strategy for every possible hand. Amadeo knows every play at that final table inside and out. But you're the one he considers a threat. Guess I'm flattered. Fake drinking, constant talk of partying. Changing his room to torture you with hideous music. It's all calculated to drive you nuts. He wanted your tilt at the final table. But you tilted ahead of schedule, didn't you? So has Lightman broken down the old man yet? No, but he will. Maybe I can be the hero of the day, then. This... Was taken earlier this afternoon. Watch Mason's hands. Now you see the cell phone, now you don't. And now you do again. Ta-da. We've got it all on video. You palmed Amadeo's cell phone & texted his boys to pick up the ransom bag. I'm not making it to the final table, am I? No. Afraid not. Come on, it was a prank. I messed with Amadeo, he messed with me. You faked a kidnapping to give yourself a leg up to win $8.5 million. That's not a prank. That's a crime. It wasn't about the money, though, was it? You didn't think that Amadeo deserved to sit at the final table with you. He's a punk. He doesn't take the game seriously. Well, that's what I thought, anyway. He played this old gambler but good, didn't he? Who did you get to make the ransom calls? Some drunken tourist. Gave him 1000 $. People will do anything for the almighty dollar in this town. I got a question for you. It's a yes-or-no question. Did you have anything to do with Jake's disappearance? No. 40 years ago that boy was me. Hell, even I'm rooting for him. Let's go, Mason. Come on. Not to be smothering, But are you OK? - Why wouldn't I be? - You've known Mason a long time. No, I knew him a long time ago. That's a completely different thing. I mean, he took a gamble and he lost. His choice. Speaking of gambles... She's roulette. Stay away. - You enjoying the show? - Very much. Why this Ellis is having you followed because he doesn't want you fleecing his big customers? You really that good at harpooning whales? I used to be. We should play sometime. My guess is we already are. If your friend Foster as suspicious as you? More so. - She doesn't like me. - Not at all. She fears women like you bring out the worst in me. Promise? What is it? I'm not quite sure. Fancy a field trip? Is your bodyguard still out there? How you doing? You all right? Do you still keep your ladies down at the bar at the Nouveau Royale? You do? How many you got? I'll take 3. Yeah. You send them up to, The 28th floor. There's a guy there. He's in a gray suit and he's a meathead. And just tell him that, He's getting married tomorrow. Yeah. How long? Yeah, 15 minutes. 15 minutes, yeah. That's good. All right. Yeah, we'll talk. All right, put it on my account. What are we gonna do for 15 minutes? You only take me to the best places. The note with this address on it, do you think it came from Jake? I don't know. Do you? Can we ever just have a normal conversation? Oh, God. What is that smell? Oh, my god. You got the note early this morning? In your room? And then you got some prostitutes To cause a distraction so you could sneak out of the hotel? Kind of ingenious, don't you think? Why can't you take it easy? We're in Vegas. I just think it's a bad idea to antagonize Ellis. Among other bad ideas. I was happy to help. She was. - Dr. Foster, thank you for the call. - Sure. How was it with the ladies? Was it good? Is it Jake? Abe. It's Abe Tostevin. He was the best poker coache in the country. - So what happened? - He died. Abe had a knack for pissing people off. A few years ago Vegas became untenable. He worked with most of the greats until he nosedived. The question is, what's the connection between Jake and Abe? Maybe he was coaching Jake. Abe wouldn't show his face near the championship. Well, in addition to Jake Hartman being a missing person, he's now also a murder suspect. You cared about him. He gave me the only advice I ever needed. T - O - T - T. Tatas on the table. Won me a lot of pots. OK, now, look at the contraction of the orbicularis oculi pars lateralis. With the smile, there, That's classic action unit 6. She's so into me. But, looking for someone better to talk to. That's bad. All right. Come here. I'll show you something that'll blow your mind. The lip lick. The universal signal For "I want you." Case closed. I win. I'm gonna let you in on one of the true rules of womanhood. Cool. If a guy's boring you, like you want to stick a fork in your eye boring, A good lip lick can rattle him enough to change the conversation topic. I was going on about the herd mentality In the Kenyan elk population. I'm not getting your office for a week Nope. Ingrid's not dating me, she is dating my restaurant choices. Yep. Treat them well. Abe Tostevin is dead. I thought that this was about Jake. Yeah, it is. How'd you feel about Abe being back in town? I felt nothing. I didn't know. I met him once in Monte-Carlo. You mean drunk? - You ever see Abe and Jake together? - No. But I saw Abe 2 days ago. We had lunch together. you could have told me that earlier. - You didn't ask before. - Anything else? Your partner makes me light in the head. Well, I have to begin my pregame ritual, so... Why don't you come and have blueberry pancakes with me? You're not going anywhere. Sit down. That's a bit naughty, isn't it? Hitting on Foster here while your girlfriend's sitting right there. You two are sleeping together, are you? Occasionally, but it doesn't mean anything. She sleeps with everyone. This gets better and better. This is not a sideshow. Move on. Oh, I get it. I get it. You guys... You are the best liars in the world. Congratulations. Terrific. I'm bowled over. Someone tell me something. Vas and I, we have a 10 grand prop bet On whether he can get your partner into bed. Which is now off. Arrest Poppy. - For what? - Murder. You're joking. He's joking. Can I talk to you? She's a murderer. Arrest her. You sure this isn't one of your double zero bets? Reynolds. All right, come on, stand up. Put your hands behind your back. You're under arrest for the murder of Abe Tostevin. you probably want to call a lawyer. Of course, you wont be able to make bail till Monday. After the final table. Cal, I know you're mad at me, but don't do this. Mad? What, should I be mad? I know I'd be mad. Are you gonna stop this? You started it. You're gonna have to stop it. Fine. Fine. Jake wanted Macey to know he was OK, But he didn't think it was safe to call her, so he called my cell. Truth at last. When? An hour before we got together. So I stopped a guy in the casino, told him to take that note to the front desk. To be delivered in the morning when you planned to be with me, above suspicion I was gonna tell you all about it after the championship was over. How thoughtful. Why is Jake hiding? What's he so afraid of? No idea. You seemed genuinely surprised When you saw Abe's body. Jake just said he saw something awful. That's it. I didn't know it was Abe. If Jake called from wherehe's holed up, a trace will lead us right to him. You let Jake's wife carry on thinking he was, what, dead or worse. You really are a hawk with a bunny rabbit The golden boy missing from the final table That's worth at least an extra $400,000. I studied the numbers and made my decision. Same as always. Jake? It's me, baby. Let me in. What are you doing? It's all right now. All right? I just wanted it to be over. Which part, the fame or the fortune? As soon as I made the final table, my life changed. knowing you were about to win $1.5 million, that really sucks. I didn't know who to trust. Everyone's different. Is that you talking or is that Poppy? I just want our old life back. - I don't even know this Abe guy. - But you knew where to find his body. I stumbled across it. Also you stumbled across the trunk of his car? You know we found the murderer, right? You did? No, I lied. When I lie, sometimes I do this. You... When you lie, You do this. I think Poppy got close enough to you to figure that out. The others, I don't know, maybe. That little move, the right cards in your hand, You could make, what? 8 and a half million? That's why Abe was here. To coach you, help you win. I don't care what you think you know. I'm not risking my family's safety. And I don't know anybody named Abe. Stay tuned for more of the poker world championship... All right, cut. Excuse me. Do it again. If you wanted me in handcuffs, You could have just asked. We found Jake. He was hiding out. He saw Abe's murder. He just got scared. So, who did it? What do you care? It's nothing to you, right? It turns out Jake doesn't know who did it. He just freaked out. He... His wife wants him to play the final table. But I don't think he'll budge. I'd say too bad, but... Poppy, you're up. Stay tuned for more of the poker world championship. - What if she doesn't take the bait? - She will. Maybe there's time for ben To run to the casino while we wait. So, the betting you two have been doing, You up or down? You think I didn't know? Gillian, your {gotta learn to embrace this town. It was just a couple of bets for old times' sake. Vas. It was you, wasn't it? - What are you talking about? - We had a deal. You and me, first and second place At the final table. The deal stands. Not if you killed Abe. I told you he didn't know about us. The bastard could read you like a book.</i> Why do you think he asked you to lunch? Old times' sake?</i> He cared about me. He was coaching another player. He wanted information.</i> - Are you really that stupid? - Are you?</i> You just kill a man because you think maybe he knows something?</i> Yeah. Going to cost me $15 million. You really did it? You killed him? Not me. One of my investors from Moscow.</i> I'm calling the police. We're good. She's in trouble. Hold it right there, Vas! Stop! You hold it right there! Have you had enough? Stay still. So how did you know she'd go there? It was in her own best interest. Some people don't change. So you knew she had information. And you still slept with her? That's not why I slept with her. You all right? We're live in 2 hours. Perfection, people. Oi! Ellis. I want double. My bonus for bringing Jake to the final table, double it. He says he's not showing up. Oh, he'll show up. Abe was killed by the Russian and his mafia investors. Why? 'cause he was coaching Jake. You already knew that, didn't you? That's why you brought him back to town. I paid for his ticket out. Yeah. Yeah. And you paid for mine, too. Yet here I am, 'cause you need me. Well, I didn't need Abe. You didn't want him to coach Jake, Just give him edge? I don't get involved on that level. Because the integrity of the championship Is paramount. Yes, it is. Oh. Right. Golden boy from evergreen park, Illinois, wins the tournament. Next year, every hayseed in America is going to be plopping down 20 grand to enter. I didn't bring Abe back to Vegas. See, you hired me as a lie expert, And then you lied to me. Double it. Medium triple latte. Thanks. How long you been watching that? Not long. I lied. - She likes you. - Nice try. But I saw the lip lick. Thetrue rule of womanhood. Loker, there's no such thing as true rule of womanhood. I made it up. You were doing that really super-annoying Smug guy thing. I was pissed. And I wanted the ant farm. I am smug? Well, how do I know you're telling the truth now? Not only is she laughing, She's looking right into your eyes. She's being polite. This isn't being polite. Her pupils were dilated. Well, she did... Touch my knee At one point. So you think I should... Call her and... Definitely. Crazy things happen in the desert, And we've seen our fair share, With our final table already cut down from 5 players to just 3. Let's get started and introduce them to you.</i> It's not easy being leader, And that's true of our current chip leader,</i> The lone amateur at this final table.</i> The golden boy from evergreen park, Illinois.</i> Where's that, you ask?

Lovely. I thought I should embrace the Vegas. Ladies and gentlemen, Jake Hartman! I'm not letting you spend your last night here, Looking like that, watching other people play poker.
