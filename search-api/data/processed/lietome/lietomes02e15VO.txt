Miss Mornie gave me a green ticket. I got to go to the prize box. Prize box? That's fantastic, Sophie. You know what I think? Daddy would like to hear about this. It's Hardy. I'm approaching the third floor. What unit was that disturbance call? Unknown. Somewhere on floor 3. Roger that. I'll find it. Jimmy, I was supposed to be punched out about 40 minutes ago. Sorry, bro. You caught the call.</i> What the hell you... Hey, this is Nick. You know what to do after the beep.</i> It's me. Guessing you're not going to make it home for dinner again. Sophie really needs her father. When you get home, we need to talk about this because something has to change. 12.50 a share. It's the best I can do. If I'm going to pull the trigger, it has to be at the right price, Don. Something tells me you can do a lot better. I can't do better. I guess we're done here. You walk out of here now, Don, and the deal's off. Are you sure there's no more money on the table? Fine. $13. Not a penny more. My absolute limit. Great. We have a deal. You drive a hard bargain. And you have a private jet. Seems fair. Not bad. I pay you 10 grand, and you make me 15 million. Teach me. The science, I mean. You got 8 years? I want to shadow you, watch what you do. How you do it. I'm a quick study. - I'll pay you 30 grand for the week. - 50. - Get Loker down there with a camera. - 40. A cop's been shot. I'm on retainer with the city. 45. Take it or leave it. Why's the FBI on this? There was a shooting on a federal housing project. There he is. Captain James, D.C. police. Dr. Cal Lightman. Given our present situation, - Lightman's the man. - What's the situation? One of the bullets rendered officer Nick Hardy a quadriplegic. He can't speak, can't move, and we can't get a clear response to any of our questions. So you want me to help identify the shooters. 911 got a call from the Eastmont projects. Tenants heard shots, and they saw two kids running from the building in bloody shirts. They were caught a few blocks away, but no shirts and no murder weapon. But residue on one of their hands shows that he recently fired a gun. But without it, we can't prove it was the gun. The surgeon says that Hardy doesn't even have much time... Maybe a few days, but more than likely, a few hours. Why are you so worried now? That's one of my men. You're concerned you don't have the whole story yet. The kids that we picked up, they're just runners for a small-time dealer. They never carried weapons, and they have no history of violent crime. And then, one day, they just shoot a cop. I think someone told them to gun up. But the question for you is, can you read a man who can barely move his eyes? La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> pr√©sente: Episode 215: <i>Teacher and Pupils</i> Mrs. Hardy? Cal Lightman. You Sophie? How you doing? These are my colleagues. They told me you'd come. Mrs. Hardy, maybe I can take you both to get something to drink in the cafeteria. I love you. We'll be right back. He liked that. Look at the muscles around the eyes. They contracted a bit. It made him happier. While you're at it, Clara, try and get ahold of Foster. Come on. Nick, I'm here to help find out who did this to you. I know you can't answer questions the way you normally would, but you just think it, and I'll try to do the rest, okay? I want to state for the record that this show-up is beyond unorthodox. Shut up, counselor. You getting something? All right, Nick. Are you 90 years old? Are you 30 years old? There. Right there. His pupils. Can you bring those two over? And lean them right in. I know you're tired, but I need you to concentrate, all right? Were these two boys there when you were shot? It's a positive affirmation. That's a "yes" to you, counselor. One at a time. Did this one shoot you? Nothing? And the other? In he comes now. Did this one shoot you? There it is. They were both there when he was shot, but this one, he pulled the trigger. What's your next trick, reading tea leaves? This is all total garbage. I'm giving my clients back to social services - and back to county. - No. We know you were working with someone. If you fess up now, we can protect you from that person. Look at that... honest fear, it is. Dont say anything. There are no questions. Right against self-incrimination. They also have a right to self-preservation. They cooperate, maybe we can cut a deal, because we are going to find who you were working for. - We were doing a job for... - You don't have to say anything. We were slanging drugs for Tevon, and this cop creeped up on us. In our neighborhood, someone comes up behind you, you don't ask questions. You shoot. Went down before we even knew he was the police. He's lying. Clara, how do I know he's lying? For 45 grand, why don't you tell me? Here we go. Went down before we even knew he was the police.</i> There. Duping-delight. Some people can't help the tiniest hint of a smile when they think they've gotten away with a lie. - Who's Tevon? - Their language is all past tense. It's like they're unconsciously cutting ties from this person. He's the dealer. He runs the projects. Real scumbag. May have been running drugs for him, but that's not who they were working for - when they bumped into Hardy. - Sure? Sure as the lie on his face. Whoever they were working for scares them enough - they would rather serve up Tevon. - Or maybe there's a rival dealer trying to recruit some of Tevon's runners. - We should go talk to him. - That's not who they were working for. Why do you want see him? - The first rule of policeman... - Stop for coffee? Follow every lead. We need to talk. Maybe alone. I'll just go get a snack while you two talk about Clara. Good grief. Sit down. What about Clara? Our accountant says we can't make payroll next week. - Terrific. Start the layoffs, then. - The situation is serious. Keeping your daughter is not going to keep me from yelling - until I get through to you. - All right, calm down. What about Clara... Formally, Mrs. Bailout? Maybe she's more valuable than just a one-day ridealong. Let me get this straight. You're asking me to ask Clara for a loan? She could know people... with money who could use our services... She's our client. I don't ask clients for loans. - I don't mix business with pleasure. - Pleasure? If you want to discuss some kind of business deal, I'm open to it. That's much appreciated, but, your money's no good here. This would probably be a bad time to ask for the $300 I need for the dance. Since when does it cost $300 to dance? I need a new dress, shoes... Hair, manicure. Clearly outnumbered here. There. - Thank you. - I want receipts. I just keep coming to you with this problem, you keep ignoring it. Find a loan, then. I know some money men. I could help you with this. Ready? You don't think you're coming along, do you? - Absolutely. - No, she's my colleague. Wherever I go, she goes. Fine, but she's signing a waiver. I tell you what, why don't you go with Foster and sign the necessary papers? While you're at it, you can give her the names of those money men. - Glad to help. - To the right. Let's go before she comes back now. Tevon moves around the projects every few months. Makes it harder for the UCS to keep a bead on him. Our intel says he's on the fourth floor. But we don't know which apartment. We're the cops. Who wants to be strip-searched? There's your apartment. It's the first one down on the left. - How do you know? - If you put a drop of water in front of ants, they'll avoid it they think it's dangerous. The kids did the same. They steered clear of that apartment. - Probably for the same reason. - All right. You're a civilian. You stay in the stairwell. Can I have a badge and a gun? Can you deputize me? Yeah, nice try. Listen, you get in any trouble, you call us. All right. Thank you very much. I walked this beat 20 years. Pretty tough, all right? - Yeah? - Police. Tevon in? - No. Tevon ain't here. - I guess we just have to wait for him. - Yo, man, drop it! - Drop the gun. We're cops. Man, I got shot by a guy saying they was cops before. I ain't going for it then, I ain't going for it now. So y'all drop the gun, or I'm pulling the trigger. Son, you are playing this all wrong. What's wrong is y'all creepin' round my door trying to cap me, man. Captain James, this is officer Lightman. We got SWAT outside.</i> The sniper has the subject in sight through the south window.</i> Good. I hope they shoot your ass in the back of the head. Shut up, bitch! Officer James, please respond. Do we greenlight the sniper?</i> Let me tell you something. Those snipers are going to put a bullet in your brain unless you drop that gun right now. You have 3 seconds. Put the gun down. Put it down. 1... - 2... - All right, yo. Ain't knew y'all was really cops, man. Thought y'all was here to mess with my business. All right. Cool. Put it down. Easy, man. Cool. Hey, man. Look. All this is just one big honest mistake. I know it was. So was this. - Come on, man. - Take a walk, honey. Hey, man! Man, this ain't justice. - What this is about? - Who's your deputy now, then? Yo, man, those kids are straight-up liars. All I told them to do was run product, and by product, I mean chewing gum. He's telling the truth, except for the gum part. See, man? Listen to him. What do you know about the cop that got shot? I know Jack, man. Matter of fact, where my lawyer at? Where's your stash? 'Cause far as I can tell, you've got drugs hidden... - 3 feet from where I'm standing. - Listen up, little English muffin. You ain't about to get in my head, man. You better get your ass a warrant. Where am I going to get a warrant, you wanker? I'm not a cop. All right, then. How about... I start over here? You think? Hey, man. Come on, man! That ain't necessary. Come on, man. - What about in here? - All right, man. Cool. I'll tell you what you want to know. Tell you all I know. Look, I heard a lot of loud shouting and some gunfire going on directly below me. Then I seen those two punks digging out of the back lot. Go on, ask your boy over there. He'll tell you I'm telling the truth. He's got a point. You heard shouting from below you? Listen, Hardy was answering a domestic disturbance call. Arguing was coming from the third floor. But he was shot before he got to the right apartment. But did anyone talk to those tenants during the follow-up investigation? There were some apartments where no one was home. Maybe whoever was arguing downstairs saw someone with the shooters, but they got too scared to talk, so they bolted. It's like I always say, follow every lead. Right, Tevon? Whatever, man. I'm really uncomfortable with this. Knock, say it's you, and he opens the door voluntarily. We don't have 3 hours to wait for a warrant. You ditched me, which is not good for business or pleasure. It gave me minor pleasure. Sure. Lightman, are you there? - How you doing? - Good. - What's your name? - Olivia. What? Who's Olivia? Is that your doll? Can I have a look? Take a seat. It's all right. I won't bite you. What the hell is going on? I'm on the phone with a very mean lady who wants me to hear her secret. I don't want to hear her secret. I want to hear yours. You got a secret Olivia. Such professional behavior. I can't imagine why your company is drowning in red ink. Mr. Jenkins isn't home. He's dead. - When did he die? - Last night. I saw them taking him away in a bag. Who took him? The corner men. It said it on their backs. Hey, sweetheart. Do you mean the coroners took him away? Did they have "coroner" written in yellow on the back of their jackets? And they had a belt... like yours. What do you mean, a belt with a gun? Like the police? How many cops work these projects? - About a dozen. - I want pictures. - I've got the district book in my car - Good, I'll grab it on the way out. You're takin' a hell of a leap that cops were moving this body. How's a little girl supposed to know if what she saw in the middle of the night were coroners, criminals, or cops? Coroners don't have guns, and criminals don't carry their weapons in holsters. Right, Olivia? See? Where is he? - Where's Lightman? - He left before us. I thought here. That was the morgue. No 70-year-old white males in the past 24 hours. No signs of foul play at Jenkins' apartment. It's like the old man just vanished. And none of this means it was cops taking a body out of the building. That's what we're trying to find out. Follow every lead, remember? There isn't a single witness who was at that scene to corroborate your theory. Actually, there was a witness. And I think I know why Lightman isn't here. All right, Nick. These are pictures of the cops that work those projects. Let's see if any of them were there when you were laying on the floor. That's officer Hollander. That's confirmation. Well done, mate. And another. Your pupils are on fire. You're on a roll. And again. You've been holding on long enough just to tell me this, haven't you? Do you want me to help you say good-bye to your family? Right, then. Hi. Your husband wants you to know something. Wants to tell you something. I'm going to translate, if that's okay. When Janine was with you earlier, you were happy. You showed happiness. Is that 'cause you love her? Yeah, that's a yes. I see remorse. Am I reading that right? We'd been fighting. He was working long hours, and... I wanted him home. Where he'd be safe. Do you care about any of that anymore? No. He loves you very much, you and Sophie. He always will. You can't fake that look. What's he saying now? Nothing. He's gone. I'm sorry. What? How did you read remorse on him? I didn't. I read it on her. All of these men are in the same unit. They cover the Eastmont projects, but why would my men sneak a body out in the middle of the night and leave one of their own to die? I know. It doesn't seem sporting, does it? Now, weneed a lot more information before we confront these officers. We got a 70 year old white male matching our description - that just turned up. - You see? The coroner misplaced the body. It happens. I knew my guys were clean. But we didn't find it in the morgue. We found it in a dumpster 3 blocks from the projects in a body bag like that little girl said badly beaten and stabbed to death. All right. Let's see how you handle the morgue. Yeah, that's Mr. Jenkins, all right. OK, I ided a guy. Now I got to go back to running a building. What are you so ashamed of? Nothing. You see my face? What's my expression say to you? Does it say anger? Does it say impatience? I'm just creeped out by dead bodies, that's all. - Really? - Yeah. All right, come here. All right. Look at this guy. Go on, look. See, you are telling the truth when you say that you're creeped out, but why no shame for this one? What's your problem with Jenkins over there? Nothing. You asked me to come identify Mr. Jenkins... You see, that's a lie. That's a lie right there. Come here. Identify him again. Identify him again. It's Mr. Jenkins. You see? Right there, that's deceit. Why lying about this man's name? I don't have to be here. - You don't have no authority... - Let me explain something to you. Your building are registered as section 8 housing. That's a federal program. So trust me, I have the authority. Why don't you take a wild guess on what this is. That's the tenant list. The unit Jenkins lived in... was registered with the federal government as a Mr. Kashdan. There's hundreds of tenants covering 3 buildings. I can't keep track of them. - That's a lie. - How about we try this again? - What do you know about Jenkins' death? - I don't know anything. That building is filled with junkies and gangbangers. - The place is dangerous. - OK. That's lie number 2. One more of those, and I'm going to let Reynolds and James out there - flip a coin over who locks you up. - I'll take heads. I converted the building to section 8 housing. I provide an apartment, the feds pay me 90% of the rent. But you know what you really get is a building full of crackheads and ex-cons. Things just got out of hand. You know, I'm smelling fear here. Oh, yeah. Of this one. And this one. And these other two. - How does he know that? - Eyelids. Uppers are severely raised, lowers are tensed. Why are you so afraid of these cops? Look, a few years ago, they tell me they're gonna round up all the skells in the building, force them out, whether they want to go or not. I would replace the crackheads and the hookers</i> with people who wouldn't completely ruin the place. But you'd leave the original tenants on the federal register so that the government would continue to pay their rents. So you would get 2 rents per unit. But I didn't get any of the money. The cops kept it all. I got 10% on the amount. But the cops took the rest of it. 6 figures a year. And you told no one about this? Who am I supposed to go to when the problem are the police? Did you kill Jenkins? That's true. Jenkins threatened to rat if we didn't cut him in. He was a big mouth, crazy old man. I tried to tell him not to make waves. His testimony alone isn't going to be enough. His name is the only name on those rent documents. Nothing leads us to the cops. Well, let me have a crack at the shooters, then. These kids, they know the cops can get them anywhere, even in prison. That's why they panicked, shot officer Hardy and tried to serve Tevon up. Nothing scares a con like a dirty cop. If Hardy hadn't stumbled on those kids... It's what cops call mutt-luck. You all right there, Captain? Because I'm sensing a little guilt. You'd feel guilty, too if you assigned a man with a wife and daughter to the beat that got him killed. Listen, we'll take over the investigation from here. I appreciate everything you guys have done. Thank you very much. - Now? - Yeah, go on. Look at you. You look beautiful, Em. Thank you. I can't believe you made me get dressed here. Well, you know, for 300 bucks, at least I should get a picture, right? There. You know, there was a time when me and your mum couldn't get you into a dress. I used to eat nothing but yellow foods, too, but things change. I wish they didn't have to. So, what's going on with you tonight? I'm working late. I've got a client. Oh, with Clara. What? No. It's business. No. That's... a lie. I can see that thing your eyes are doing. - What? - They did it again. Do me a favor. You've have better luck reading a Chinese phone book. Here we go. All right, now. You see this? No less than 6 inches between you and dick. - Dad? - What? Come on. It's Richard. Oh, in that case, 12 inches. - You got a coat? - Yeah, this is a coat. - That's not a coat. - Yes. - It's a shrug. - You look great. I've spent a fortune and not looked half as good. Thank you. - Have fun with your client. - You have fun, too. The equity fund manager's waiting. We're going to be late. Good luck. You can fill me in over dinner. So to speak. Or not. Focus. Hmm? Right. John and George, right? Talking about their new secretary. And John says, "I took her out last night, "and we went at it all night. Yeah, she's better than my wife." So the next day, George comes in. He says, "I took her out last night. "We went at it all night. I think you're right. I think she is better than your wife." Right. Well, you're the boss, 'cause everyone else, they waited just a millisecond before they laughed. You, you laughed, but you found it offensive. Being the family man that you are. You, you got turned on by it. And you... well, you'd heard it before, but you laughed anyway. Your laugh was fake. So. That's what we do, gentlemen. We read people. If you're lying or cheating, your face will let us know before anything you're saying ever does. Well, I look forward to working with you. Well, you sure know how to show a girl a good time. Well, it's been a while, has it? You know, everyone needs a reminder now and then. So, what's this really all about, Clara? - I don't follow. - That's 'cause you've been too busy trying to lead, haven't you? Mmm. I paid good money for that privilege. Doing you a favor. 45 grand? That's chump change for someone like you, isn't it? If you were interested in what I do, you'd have made a play for me by now. Well, no. I mean, not play for me. A play for firm. Over your dead body. What's your game, Cal? Hello, Em. What? Now, say that again. All right. You say nothing until I get there. You understand? - Nothing. - What's wrong? You take the car. The bastards arrested my daughter for drugs. - Cal Lightman. Where's my daughter? - Mr. Lightman, let's talk in here. Where's my daughter, officer? I can understand your concern, also being a dad. These kids today, huh? Yeah. So, where is she? Take a breath. It's OK. She's coming. Seriously, take a breath, pal. Well, see, I just want her back. - You're going to let her go. - You seem like a smart guy, doting dad. We all make mistakes. Correct? There a reason not to let her go? Oh, no. Can't think of one. All right. Well, thank you. Don't mention it. That's it, then? You tell me if that's it. I think we understand each other. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here she is now. Dad! I didn't do anything. I swear. I know that, love. I absolutely, sweetie. Count yourself lucky, Emily. Most kids around here don't get bail when they're caught with enough cocaine for an "intent to distribute." Come on. Let's go. Come on. I want to officially notify you that this is now an FBI investigation. Wait a minute. I came down here because you told me you were looking for</i> a new focus in the investigation. The new focus is the relationship between you and your boy Hollander.</i> I told you I'd take care of Hollander and his men.</i> He crossed a line. That was my daughter. - And I'm sorry. - That better be genuine concern for my Emily, 'cause my blood is well up, my judgment is way out of whack, so keep talking. - Those men were out of line. - The other night, you lied about the reasons for your guilt. You are to blame for Hardy's death, but not because you sent him off to the projects, but because you're up to your eyes in this with Hollander and his thugs. Or should I say your thugs? - And that wasn't a bloody question. - This is more complicated. Why? Whose side are you on, James? 'Cause on the one hand, you grieve for Hardy's death, right? But somehow, you're involved with the men responsible for it. So... He was a good man. Why don't you save the B.S. For his widow and answer the question? You guys think that I'm running a crew of dirty cops? I don't think it. I see it. - Why are you protecting them? - I'm not protecting them. No, you're protecting yourself. I'm coming at you, James, with everything I've got, and you know that? Not just because of my daughter, but because of Hardy's wife and kid. You do remember them? A lot of people in those projects are good people, just trying to live their lives. Which is hard enough without dealers and pimps and scumbags. Well, I smell police vigilantism. The people in that building called it safety. You don't have to see what we see, day after day, year after year. 4 years ago, I pulled a baby out of a dumpster for the last time. That's when I had Hollander and his crew set an example of a couple of the problem tenants, so the rest of the trash would know that they were not tolerated in my projects. - Your projects? - My projects! Somebody's got to own them. If we just did things by the book, which doesn't exist, anyway, nothing would get done. I swear on my mother's grave, I didn't know Hollander was running a rent scam, and I didn't know anything about any killings. So, you really believed that you were doing good there. I know I was. You can't be that naive. Naive? No. Arrogant. Arrogant enough to believe that my men would never let me down. Yeah, well, they did. So you're going to help us end this, if it's the last thing you do. You're going to go pick up Hollander and bring him back here. We'll grab the other turd. Officer Tressler, FBI. You're under arrest. You can't just arrest an officer of the law 'cause you feel like it. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Now you know how my daughter felt. There he is. I'm glad you could come. What's the matter? Did I strike a nerve? What, don't you like being yanked out of your life to be here with me? You got nothing on me. This is bull. - How's your daughter doin'? - She's doing fine. Grades have dropped a bit. The boys have already started talking. We've just got a couple of quick questions for you. You have no right to keep us here. Get me a lawyer. People who show genuine guilt and remorse are more - likely to confess. - You read that on which one? Tressler. At the police station, Lightman read that he wasn't comfortable with what his partners did to Emily. If a member of a group feels that the group has strayed from its moral code, that member's discomfort manifests itself in physical distancing from the group, micro-expressions of disagreement. And Lightman said that this guy was showing all of those at the precinct. He's doing it right now. He's on the opposite side of him. How you doing? You know what? He's the worst kind of cop,</i> - <i>don't you think?</i> - <i>He's a good cop.</i> His voice trailed off. He doesn't believe that. I'm sorry. Could you say that again?</i> It's mind games. It's all mind games. You can go. We don't need you anymore. We've got him. Seriously, off you go.</i> What, you scared, are you? You scared to leave without your boyfriend here? - I think I want a lawyer. - He used the word "think." He's equivocating. He wants to unburden himself. I think I know what Captain James was doing,</i> or thought he was doing, in those projects. He was taking out trash, right? Look at you. That's pride, that is. He's puffed up like a peacock. - Lawyer. - That's fair enough. You can have a lawyer. I'm not asking you to say anything. Not verbally, anyway. His face has already told me you killed Hardy. That's a lie. I did not! No, I'm sorry. I mean had him killed. Had him killed. Had him killed. That's it. Right.</i> Those kids... It was an accident. - Now we're getting somewhere. - OK. We're through here. Let's go. - Here we go. - You know, you left Hardy, a father and a husband, to bleed out alone. He's gonna do you next, you know that? Shut up. That's enough. Make me. Go on. Make me. No. I want you to... make me. - Then you went after my daughter. - No. No? Well, his Adam's apple says yes. You know, look at it. It's like a cork in a storm. And you see that look? That's very common on people with intent to commit murder. 16, my daughter. She's 16. Some man you are. Don't look at him. He can't help you. I didn't want to. - <i>You didn't want to what?</i> - <i>What, threaten my family?</i> No, but you did, though. You went along with it.</i> - 'Cause you're scared of him. - I'm not. - Coffee break? - Yes. Wait. I only knew about the two boys killing Jenkins. Excuse me? We saw Hardy lying there, bleeding out. But Jenkins was already dead. - His apartment door was wide open. - That's enough. We closed it, and we moved the body later. You killed Jenkins to shut him up about your rent scam. That's it. I just wanted to make a few extra bucks, and then, this Jenkins guy starts causing trouble. Shut up. You're smarter than this. Come on. And next thing I know, Hollander tells me that he's dead, and we have to move the body. Prison's too good for you, mate. But I suppose it will have to do. I've made a couple of calls. I've let them know you're coming. I said 45 grand, by the way. Consider it a discount for ditching me. So, Captain James will cut a deal, but the rest of 'em are looking at a life sentence. Well, if I was on James' jury, I'd be inclined to give him a second chance. Here. - Would you like some more good news? - Yeah? - You got the loan? - 7 figures. It'll keep us afloat for at least a year, long enough to get us - back on our feet. - Congratulations. Well done, Foster. Thanks to Clara for getting us in touch with the equity firm. I'm excited we're going to be working together. - Excuse me? - Come again? Well, as the majority investor of that equity firm, I can't wait to turn this place into the cash-cow it should be. Sky's the limit. I'll leave you two to celebrate. I'll call you tomorrow to talk over some details. - Your place or mine? - Well, your place is mine, now. That's the best you can do? So, you've been hanging around with me for, you know, a few days now. That makes you an expert, does it? I told you, I'm a quick study. I believe in business and pleasure. Proud of you. - For what? - Admit it. You were holding out for more than just a handshake. You're enjoying this, aren't you?
