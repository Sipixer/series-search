It's a bloody zoo out there. Out. Get it up. Keep the change. Let's go. It's not like there aren't any decent schools around here. But... no, my little genius, she's got her heart set on Berkeley, which is 3,000 bloody miles away. This is her mother's doing. Her fingerprints all over it. And now Emily's late, right? I can't even find my picture ID. So, what's the matter? Remember Henry Andrews? Pentagon, 2003. He just called. He wants to tell you the truth about the whole Jimmy Doyle business, face to face. That was 7 years ago. He wants to come clean now? He was 10 minutes away when he called. I got to be at the airport in about 10 minutes. What was that? Come on, Loker. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Someone, please! Somebody help! I need a little help here! There was a man in that car and he's in... He's dead. He... It was... He's in shock. To the break room. Come on this way. All circuits are busy now. Will you please try your call a... Metro authorities have closed off... ... until further notice. The police department, along with the fire department,</i> will be controlled... This just came for you. The man said it was urgent. Drink it. What man? What did he... when did he come? Just before... He said no matter what happened next, - you need to open this. - What did he look like? He was wearing a hat, sunglasses. It was really quick. I was going to lunch. - If I hadn't had to stay for this... - I know. Here's Emily's number. I want you to call her. You get her on the phone, you come and find me. All right, darling? ... to and from each... According to reports, the car was traveling South</i> on seventh near Harvard Square when the bomb detonated,</i> killing the driver instantly, whose identity is unknown at this point.</i> The cause of the explosion is as yet unknown...</i> What is that? ... several government counterterrorist agencies...</i> What's important for me right now is to talk to Emily, so make him comfortable and give him some tea. No, you know something about this bomb or at least you think you do. I know that look! It's got to be gridlock out there. Emily's probably stuck in it. Say it. Go on. You can say it. Doyle is back, he killed Andrews, I'm next. La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente : Épisode 212 : <i>Sweet Sixteen</i> This came just moments before that bomb went off, right? "Lightman, psych evaluation, "March 20, 2003, session one." Ring any bells? UCM stadium, tunnel 6, 1 P.M. Or Doyle gets the other 5 tapes. Someone's blackmailing you? Is that what it is? - It's nice to meet you. - How do you do? Apparently, my job here depends on my meeting with you. So, did they tell you all about me, then? Why they sent me, so you could officially diagnose me as broken in the head? No longer reliable. Not to be taken seriously. I'm here to help you, Dr, not judge you or rubber stamp anyone's attempts to discredit you or your science. Which, by the way, happens to be of great interest to me. Is this session being recorded? This office is for therapy and counseling only. I would not tolerate anyone recording what is said in here. Who would send you this? Did you know it was being taped, and if so, who was doing the recording? You can't just sit in here and talk about me. It was the Pentagon. Of course it occurred to me it could have been bugged. Do I know by who? You know me better than that, Cal. Did Anna reach Emily yet? No, no. She's still trying. I can't just walk away. You can't just walk away from me when anyone with half a brain knows that you both know something about that bomb, which, by the way, came this close to killing me. Mr. Andrews, the confirmed victim, a british born U.S. Citizen and fossil fuel entrepreneur.</i> Here's what we're learning about him.</i> - <i>He was a bachelor.</i> - You know him. Right now we're being told that we're going to take you live</i> to the director of national intelligence</i> at FBI headquarters. We do not yet know who is responsible,</i> - <i>but multiple agencies...</i> - That's a lie. Okay, Lightman, we know you knew the victim. What else do you know? That man was killed by Jimmy Doyle, one of the most dangerous bastards I've ever come across. Doyle. Irish? Belfast. You okay, Foster? Everything's fine. The man that was killed by that bomb was not a foss fuel entrepreneur. He was british liaison for counterterrorism at the Pentagon. And 7 years ago he was my boss. Okay, who is he to you, Foster? Did you work at the Pentagon, too... Oh, my God, - You did. - Dad? Where you been? I was worried sick. I was stuck out in the mess with everyone else. What's going on? That's what we all want to know. Look, you know, I'm sorry about what you just went through, but right now I need a moment with my daughter. After that, I'll figure out how I'm gonna use you guys on this. That's how it works, so end of conversation. That was a conversation? Okay. All right. How are you doing? I'm sorry about Berkeley. We'll do that another weekend. We'll do it soon, I promise. But right now, I need you to do me a favor. Do you have a friend that you can stay with for a day or two? Can it be a boy? "Can it be a boy?" I had no idea our sessions were being recorded back then. Since we're so close, that means you, scientifically speaking, of course, are my blind spot, which you well know. - You don't believe me. - Did I say that? Emotionally, you want to believe me. Scientifically, you can't be sure. Please, don't go after those tapes. It's not worth it. Don't go to that stadium. What's not worth it? You have no idea who's behind this or what this is really about. Do you know who's behind this? Drop it, Cal. I'm not doing this. All right. Look, no one knows I'm doing this, understand? No one. Doyle? Dr. Lightman. 7 years ago, you were involved in the murder of my wife and daughter. Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Do you have a family now, Dr. Lightman? You already know the answer to that question, don't you? How old is she? Your daughter, Emily. - You leave my daughter alone. - How old is she? 16. I didn't plant that bomb in Andrews' car. Now you got my attention. Sure, tracked him down, I put the fear of God in him. But he swore he didn't know who killed my girls. After I was done with him, I tailed him to a corner store. He bought this. A throwaway phone. Made 2 calls, then tossed it. That's my office. - Yeah. - And the other number I don't know. It's untraceable. Well, if you didn't kill Andrews, Whoever did, they made it look like your work. You got 24 hours to find the killer of my wife and daughter Or you're a dead man. Yeah, I need to show you something. Can I show you something? Go on. Here. Someone's trying to use my fear of you to blackmail me. But... Now that we've met, it's kind of a moot point, don't you think? These tapes, what's on them? It's me talking about... My role in the death of your wife and daughter. Now, I'm gonna find whoever made these tapes and they're gonna tell me who killed your family. I'll do that for your wife and daughter. I won't for that. For now. Dr. Lightman gave me his phone for track down Emily for him. You okay? Is there anything I can do? No. Thanks. So you're the in-house shrink? I'm a psychologist. Oh, yeah. Psi ops. Let's see, dirty tricks brigade, eh? - Speaking of dirty tricks... - No, you see, That wasn't supposed to happen. Now that it has happened, how do you feel? Is this a plant? I mean, is this supposed to soften me up? Yes. That's exactly what it is. Well, it's working. 3 days ago, when I was undercover In a bar in Boston, four IRA men from Belfast were there to talk about a peace agreement with their american money who were feeling a pinch from the war on terror. And my read on one of these IRA men, Jimmy Doyle, was... That he was about to ruin the peace. And someone in this building took that as license to kill him. Only the morons messed it up. They killed his wife and daughter instead. How do you think I feel? The paper says... they caught the two men who robbed and killed Mary and Bernadette Doyle. But darling, that's a cover-up. That's two junkies with records framed and flushed down the toilet as we speak. Come on, you're an intelligent woman. You feel responsible. Ashamed. Guilty. My daughter is the same age as that little dead girl. That's empathy is healthy, but it doesn't make you guilty. So where is this Doyle now? He got away. - Are you sure he's a terrorist? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, even more so now we've murdered his family. Porn? You are human. You seem to be making a speedy recovery. What are you really working on? Personal stuff. It's my personal laptop. Personal stuff. In the middle of all this? That's what I call compartmentalization. - They teach you that at the Pentagon? - Can I help you with something, Eli? Actually, you can... Gillian. - You hacked into... you can't do that! - In my sleep. Here's what I know. In 2003, you were at the Pentagon when Henry Andrews, the man whose blood I just cleaned off my face, Ordered you to evaluate a member of his team, Dr. Cal Lightman, who was acting irrationally and I quote, "in danger of causing serious harm to ongoing counterterrorist operations." It could have been worse. It could have been porn. Lightman didn't believe the robbery-homicide story.</i> You mean the Pentagon's cover-up story. Those men were found guilty of the murders of Mary and Bernadette Doyle by their peers in a court of law. You know what I hear in that official, very un-Foster-like speech pattern? Fear and doubt. Lightman wanted to go public with what he believed was the real story. He wanted to blow the whistle on a botched Pentagon ordered hit? To prevent him from doing that, or at least to discredit his mental state if he tried, his boss sent him to see me. His boss... Henry Andrews... The man who was killed in that car bomb. Did Lightman ever blow the whistle? His life was in serious danger. See, that doesn't sound like Lightman. A lot of what Lightman does these days is because of what... He didn't do back then. Odd. So I was almost killed by a terrorist who is after Lightman. Jimmy Doyle killed Andrews. You could be next, Dr. Lightman. I don't talk to people whose faces I can't see. - You want the tapes back or not? - How do I know you've even got them? What do I have to do for the rest of them? Find Doyle. Flush him out. We'll take care of the rest. Like you did the last time. Who are you? What? The disk. I'll save you the trouble if you like. Somewhere on there, I called you a terrorist. Terrorist scum I think it was. At least I never killed innocent women and children. All fanatics wash their hands of the innocent's blood in the cause's name. Right? Do me a favor. You're no innocent. No by any stretch of the imagination. I told you to go to Torres' place. I will when she gets off work. If it's safe enough here for everyone else, it's safe enough for me. - That's a fair point. - What happened to your face? I fell, officer! - Where's Foster? - Quit changing the subject. - Where were you? - I was working. And yes, on this bomb. I can't tell you about it, you know that. So do me a favor, could you find Foster for me, please? Hi. You must be Emily. Hello. This is Mr. Doyle. I'll explain later. Will you find Foster for me? Let's talk about your family. Why? Your wife Zoe and your daughter Emily. Off limits. It must be quite a strain... juggling family with the type of work you do. No, it's not. Not if your family comes first, it's not. And not to mention the dangerous set of circumstances you clearly believe yourself to be in right now. I get it. It's loud and clear. That's all I need to hear. Now, you tell them I'll go quietly. - Just leave my family alone. - Dr. Lightman, that's not what I meant. You're calling me paranoid? I was referring to Doyle still being out there somewhere. You're trying to tell me something else, right? Only you can't. Why is that? There it is again. Thank you very much. What's this? This... is Jimmy Doyle. I know who it is. He's not a threat to us. Unless I fail to do right by him. Do right by him? Who did that to your face? When we first met at the Pentagon, who did you report to? Andrews. You know that. - Who else? - No one else. - Who did Andrews report to? - He never told me. This is really important. I can see that. But I still don't have an answer for you. Are you gonna tell me what that man is doing here? This is our one chance to right a huge wrong that we both played a part in. You are not to blame for the murders of that man's family, Cal. I'm not talking about the murders. Actually, I'm talking about the cover-up afterwards. I mean, me, that's one thing, but you... You're way better than that. Which is something that's been bothering me for a long time. Now, you know, whatever it is that you're hiding from me, I forgive you. I have never hidden anything from you, Cal. Let it go. Why don't you ask Doyle about Andrews? 'Cause I've always valued your opinion. Jimmy Doyle, Gillian Foster. What are you making him do? I just need to find my wife and daughter's killer. To avenge them. Are you prepared to hunt and kill another man? I don't believe that. Even if he does have a gun to your head. You know, 7 years ago, I helped murder... this man's wife and child. And now I would like to know exactly who it was that I helped. - Why now? - Why now what? - Kill Andrews? - I didn't kill Andrews. I just talked to the man. Then why wait 7 years to come back and do any of this? When Mary and bernadette were murdered, I died that day, too. I went from grief to drink, drugs, you name it. Member of a terrorist organization. God knows how many lives you're ruined, so, please. Bloody hell! How did you track Andrews down? I got his name from the lawyer who represented the two junkies. He framed for the murder of my girls. Who is he? Where is he? Almonds. It smells like a bakery. Howard Moss! Bomb! Almonds. C-4 smells like almonds. Cal, you okay? I could listen to that all day. I thought we were done. - Who's threatening my family? - Dr. Lightman... Now, you see, I can see it in your eyes, all over your face. It's as clear as day. I'd just like to know who it is and what it is I'm dealing with here. I asked you about your family like any therapist would ask any patient. Maybe you have difficulty looking for a lie because there isn't one. I thought your lot called patients clients these days. Listen, you don't have to talk about your family with me. But you should find someone. You know, my wife... She doesn't know about any of this. Would you like to talk to her about it if you could? No, I don't mean about my work in general, I mean about this Doyle mess. So do I. I would not like to tell her about it. It would hurt her too much. Why did you choose to work in counterterrorism? It is a choice. The power of terrorists, it lies in the fear of the innocent. I want to... take that power away, you know? Why? I got a daughter. You know that in the war against terror, there's often collateral damage. As awful as that sounds. I'm sorry. What are you saying? Some collateral damage can be avoided. You talking about my Emily? We would be irresponsible... not to talk about Emily. Bloody hell. That's all we need. Get... No, I'm good. I'm good. I can help myself up. Sod off, you! Go on. All right, look, you... you're gonna be all over the bloody Internet in a minute, so take that. Lay low, and don't answer that unless her name comes up. You two are quite the pair, aren't you? Are you still here? You all right? Good morning. Yesterday, at 3:47 PM, a bomb composed of high-grade C-4 made in the style and MO of what we strongly suspect, according to our friends from British Intelligence, to be the work of a terrorist named James, aka Jimmy, Doyle. That's a patent lie for a starter. Excuse me? Dr. Lightman. - Who the hell are you? - Dr. Cal Lightman, deception expert. He knows who I am. You know who I am, don't you? Why would you lie about that? Because you say excuse me? I mean, really, if we excused you for the lies you tell, where would it end, then? There. That's the man Lightman saw that we didn't. The one man there who knew who's responsible for that car bomb. This press conference is over. It's enough. What are you hiding, Mr. Prosser? I want the room cleared, now. Dr. Lightman just asked you a question on national television. I want to give you the opportunity to answer him now, quickly, before I go back on national TV to defend you and to discredit him. - Do you have more information? - I'm not taking any questions. All right, Lightman. This is a courtesy to your resume and your FBI status, both of which are now on the line. You have a question for him? - Make it quick. - Right. Doyle is not a terrorist threat. He's a wanted terrorist from a known terrorist organization. He did'nt kill Andrews. We have evidence that links him to the car bomb and the apartment bomb. I have scientific proof that says he has nothing to do with either bomb. Scientific proof. I spoke to the man. Which means that your evidence was cooked. - There's a shocker. - You know where Doyle is? - Because if you know where he is... - Mr. Prosser, how was St. Patrick's day, 2003, for you? Excuse me? You know, the day that Doyle's wife and 9-year-old daughter were shot dead in Boston. Were you working at the Pentagon? - Put that one in the yes column. - Yes, I was at the Pentagon then. What happened to your former colleague Henry Andrews yesterday? He was tragically killed, murdered, by a terrorist car bomb. He, who was on his way to tell me what happened that day in Boston, but was killed by somebody who couldn't afford the truth to get out. How's that? Those are very serious allegations, Lightman. Wild allegations. Based in science. Right, then. 7 minutes by FBI chopper to my lab, where we can do this properly and away from the press. I can even arrange a couple of FBI agents as escort if you want. I don't think that'll be necessary, will it, Richard? I've got nothing to hide. There's nothing to this. It's child's play for a man like you, I know.</i> Right. Where's the rest of these? Your office? Home? Safe deposit box? Home it is. 2003, the Pentagon. What was your job? That's classified. But Henry Andrews... he reported to you, correct? That's also classified. All right, how about this? Today, your job is... Assistant deputy director over the department of national intelligence. Correct? That's correct. Do you like your job? I need your words, Mr. Prosser, for the machine. It's not as smart as I am. Though I say so myself. I'm proud of the work I do. But you'd like the director's job even more, wouldn't you?</i> Is that right? Blimey. There. That was almost a moment of total honesty there. - You all right? You need to lie down? - Excuse me. Mr. Prosser. Jimmy Doyle... He says he's at your home with Mrs. Prosser. I'd take that call if I were you, Mr. Prosser. If you love Mrs. Prosser, that is. Take it, anyway. I do not negotiate with terrorists. That's one way of getting rid of the wife. How dare you. I love my wife. We need to send a team to my house. - Doyle's not at Prosser's house. - Where is he? Don't know. Polygraph's a decoy, too. Lightman needs Prosser to focus on beating that so he can't mask the truth with his body language. Your wife's not so keen to talk to you either, Mr. Prosser,</i> now she knows what you're done, who you really are. You two are in this together. You're aiding and abetting a wanted terrorist. - Wanted for what? - The murder of Henry Andrews. Now, listen. You see this? This was delivered to my office less than a minute before Andrews blew past my window. You see this? This was given to me a short time later, by one of your goons at a stadium. You taped my sessions with Dr. Lightman without my knowledge. Why? You authorized the assassination of Jimmy Doyle back in 2003, based on my intelligence. That's anger, and it's directed at Lightman. Prosser based his kill order on Lightman's science. When your people killed Doyle's family, you knew he'd be back one day. You planned to use these to blackmail me to draw Doyle into your crosshairs. And so, the lawyer, he tips you off. Doyle is back in town, he's going after Andrews. So before Andrews could lead Doyle back to you... No more Andrews. Made to look like Doyle's work, and again boom, no more lawyer. Another loose end taken care of. You can't prove anything. I'm not trying to. I'm not trying to prove anything. Not in a court of law. Right? Anyway, I'm not that naive. No, I just... I wanted the truth, for myself. Now I've got it, you can go. Have a nice life. What about Doyle? You there? He's gone again. That's all right. He'll be back, sooner or later. Yeah, you should give us a call when he shows up. I want protection. In return for what? And immunity. I never knew this situation in Boston was going to become such a mess. When I found out that Doyle was back, I told Finch that he needed to clean up his own trash. Finch. Is that a code or a real name? Code. I don't know his real name. But I never told him to kill Andrews and the lawyer or Doyle. I never used those words. I never said that. Call Finch. You better hurry or you'll miss him. That's all of them. Send my best to Dr. Foster... Gillian. Where is he? Parkview Hotel. Room 344. Let's have a look at your face, shall we. You. The one cabdriver I have never forgotten. Weapon. Slowly, finger and thumb. Finch? Finch? It's like a small bird. I was just following orders. Look at her. My Bernadette... would have turned 16 today. Wait... I didn't mean for... You grabbed the gun when I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He is, you know. He is sorry. I can't tell how genuine it is, so... It's up to you, Doyle, really. What? I am sorry, too. How did you know the weapon wasn't loaded? I didn't. Why wasn't it? Love of revenge... killed my girls. And so Prosser gets immunity. Does he, hell. Why didn't you talk about what happened to my girls that day? I have girls of my own, mate. I'll never get over my hatred for you people. I was the one that told him. I said that... the only way to fight terrorism was to fight like a terrorist, and I meant that. So while I read Doyle as a threat, I knew they'd kill him. I wanted them to kill him. Do you think you can forgive yourself? So were you ever gonna tell me? He came to me... in the middle of the night, before our first session. Not to my office, to my house. My house. I'd never seen him before and I never saw him again. He told me to do what I had to do to keep you quiet, or Doyle wouldn't be the only man to lose his wife and daughter. If I told you that it would have been proof positive of a cover-up, and you would have never let go. So... I couldn't let you do that. To you, your family. You'd never have gotten to blow the whistle. He would have cut you down... before you put it to your lips. So, all that talk... about you being a bad liar,
