Honey, I got water boiling. Dinner can wait. Want to help me out of this? You get it hard on an old man, don't you? I do, don't I? How did I get so lucky? You didn't. I'm using you for sex. I love you, Clara. I love you more. I'll be back in an hour. Where are you off to? Strawberries. Champagne. Don't you leave this bed. My God, Leo. What am I going to do? Did you kill your husband?! No. I loved my husband. If you're acquitted, you'll be a billionaire. - How does that make me feel? - My client has no comment. What's it like sleeping alone now? By the way, how was the sex? Get her inside. What station are you from? Your credentials? A public street in a free country. I don't need credentials. You're no journalist. Someone told you to ask those questions. I'm doing my job. I think I can guess who for. What are you getting off Mrs. Musso? More sadness than guilt really. The evidence is rock solid. There's a partial print on a syringe containing cyanide. No sign of forced entry in her apartment. She is the primary beneficiary of the will. You got all that going for you, Crosby. What do you need me for? Never underestimate the value of an expert witness. Doc, you wanna do this? How was the sex? Hello, Zoe. It's been a long time. What do you need? A reference? I haven't had any trouble getting offers so far. You sent one of your minions to ask vicious and personal questions to my client just so you could read her reactions on TV. I can't hear you. No, can you say that again. Hear me now? - Clear as a bell. - Counselor. I'd like to speak with my ex-husband in private, if that's all right. Absolutely. I'd like an answer by the end of the business day, if you don't mind. Otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder firm, I don't really want to do that. Fair enough. Let me guess. He wants you to be his expert witness? Your client is hiding something. Probably of a sexual nature, granted that is wishful thinking on my part. She's bringing that hand up to her face. She's got a secret. I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal. And you know it. Nice charm, that is. You think she didn't kill her husband? - Yes, I do. - What makes you so sure? All the evidence is circumstantial. And as for motive, there is none. My client didn't want for anything. It was a loving and faithful marriage. An alibi? - How much is she paying you? - Exactly what I'm worth. Drinks are on you then. Still... no alibi. The trauma of finding her husband dead caused Clara to lose her memory for the 40 minutes between the last time she saw him alive and when she discovered his body. Look at it. I mean, really. She is pushing those tears out, she is. She's faking it. We both know that this "science" of yours has a serious margin for error. It won't cut it in a court of law. What will? Tears for a dead husband that left her $1.2 billion? I know why you're doing this. You're not going to get under my skin. Or my skirt. That's a lie, that is. I mean the skin part. Is this funny to you? The most important case of my career? I haven't even taken the bloody job yet, Zoe. Unlike you, I don't need to have studied amazonian pigmies for 6 years - to know that that's a lie. - You want me to do this. You don't know why you do. But you do. Did I say "serious margin for error"? I was being generous. Or couldn't you tell. It's going to be a shame to disappoint you in the courtroom. La <i><font color="#ff0000">Lie</font> <font color="#ffffff">to</font><font color="#ff0000"> team</font></i> présente : Épisode 213 : <i>The Whole Truth</i> How can anyone think Clara killed her husband?</i> I've been friends for 10 years. There's no way she could have done this.</i> Gotta love how everyone comes out of the woodwork on cases like this. They've gotta get their 15 minutes somehow. By turning this woman's life into a circus. Yeah. We're all part of that circus now. Prosecution. Foster, you're prepping witnesses. You two, you get jury watch. Read the jurors for the whole trial? Track 'em individually, see what makes them tick. But look at them as a group. I wanna know which way they're leaning. The leaders, the followers. Well go on. You're not just doing this to push Zoe's buttons. There's something else going on. This is about justice, Foster. There's something else. Zoe-related. Justice for a murder victim. By avoiding my question, you just answered it. I just hope for all our sakes, you know what you're doing. Join the club. Six of the jurors look convinced Clara is guilty just from the opening arguments. You could see approval on their faces every time the prosecutor talked. Maybe. But these two are for the defense. And they've already emerged as leaders. Jurors 6, 7 and 11 were looking at them, gaging their reaction. Which way you two leaning? Maybe he wasn't dying fast enough for her. The guy was 30 years older than she is. So? So... It can affect the power dynamic. Imbalance of power in a relationship can lead to victimization. That struck a nerve. That's interesting. Studies show that the most successful marriages are the ones where husbands are at least 5 years older than their wives. So, being with an older man broadens your horizons, does it? I'm sure Clara learned a lot from Victor. I'm sure she did, about denture cream. You're not listening, again. What Torres is saying is that she needs to be stimulated, challenged. By experience. So, who was this old fart then? I was talking about Clara. You weren't. You connected with a memory, which I proceeded to belittle. Sorry about that. You cannot sing the praises of older men and then not give up details. Watch me. All right. - You couldn't take me one-on-one? - Been there, done that. I promise to play nice today. Last time you said that you left claw marks. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? - That's not possible. - Excuse me. No one can tell the whole truth, your honor. It's subjective. It's filtered through our own experiences. - That's the real truth. - How about promising to be honest to the best of your ability? - Now, you're talking. - Please, be seated. - Thank you, your honor. - Dr., your resume speaks for itself. You're Oxford educated. You're a doctorate in psychology. And you're a consultant for the FBI. As you well know, the key question in this trial is: "Where was Clara Musso the night her husband was murdered?" The defense wants us to believe that the trauma of finding her husband dead has left Mrs. Musso unable to recall the 40 minutes between leaving him and discovering his corpse. Dr. Lightman, in your expert opinion, does this claim of memory loss pass the sniff test? Could you elaborate? It's been proven that some trauma... warfare... child abuse... can cause memory loss. - An experience with such cases? - Yeah. Plenty. I've worked with soldiers, rape victims. Memory loss is caused by degradation or abuse. Shock of a dead spouse, that'd be a first. How about a shock of committing murder? Killers have been known to experience amnesia. Forensic psychologists Call it red out. How common is it to lie, claiming memory loss? 9 out of 10 people claiming memory loss are lying. Why do they do that? It's easier to say: "I can't remember". Than tell the truth. I have nothing further. Your witness, counselor. Permission to treat Dr. Lightman as a hostile witness? - Granted. - Dr. Lightman! I'm sorry. Won't happen again, your honor. Thank you. Dr. Lightman was born hostile. He also happens to be my ex-husband. Guilty as charged. But, you know, it was my loss. Because truly she is an angel. The prosecution has touted your credentials. Are we to understand that you possess the gift of being able to distinguish between truth and lies? No. No. 20 years of research is not a gift, is it? You and I know, it's a bit of a curse, really. Indeed it was. In fact, do you recall being jeered off the stage while keynoting the Harvard global psychology conference in 2005? Yeah. I do. Yeah! Yeah, and it's bonkers. Right? Because I could have sworn that they were cheering. They called it pop psychology. Voodoo science. I think it's because they're scared of me. 4 years ago when we were still married, you accused my boss of sleeping with me. - The gloves are off now! - Objection your honor! - That's immaterial. - Dr. Lightman, last warning. Overruled. Didn't it come out eventually that my boss... A man... was in fact... gay? Yeah. Yeah, it did. Yeah. I was way off the mark on that one. But I mean, I was jealous. I was young, I was head over heels in love. By day I'm a scientist. But by night, I'm fallible. I'm only human. I'm not questioning your humanity. And certainly not your fallibility. - That's a relief. - You are here because of your expertise in psychology and lying. I'm challenging that. Your flagrant manipulation of the jury notwithstanding. OK. But when you say that your client is innocent, you don't believe that. Again, you misjudge my thoughts because I know my client is innocent. Why don't you want to hear the science then? Your testimony is limited to scientific context not specific opinions on who's lying. You want to hear the whole truth? That woman over there, - Your client, the black widow... - Control yourself! When she says she doesn't know... Dr. Lightman. Control yourself. She's lying, and that's a fact. Control yourself or I will have the judge control you! Her? Do me a favor, look at her. She's having a tough time controlling herself. Marshall, please remove this witness before I hold him in contempt. look at her. Bulging eyes, the guilt all over her face. - I think it's the booze. - Get him out of here! Hello, darling. What? I hope that was part of a careful plan in there. Careful's for lawyers and accountants! I think it's very interesting of her when I called her a black widow, - She got a little pout. - Her feelings were hurt. - Surprising? - Shocking! I'm heading back to the office to prep more witnesses. You coming? No, I gotta see a man about a dog. I'll catch up with you. OK. Behave. You're right. You need a lawyer? No, I'm only joking. - What judge you got? - Denton. Why? Denton, he's a complete softy. He's a pushover. He's a bleeding heart liberal, vegetarian. The most you're looking at there is a slap on the wrist. No. No. I didn't do anything. It was that guy. He mugged my wife. Really? I'm sorry about that. It's just luck of the draw. Keep your chin up. That was my wife! That was my wife!</i> Come on! Let me go! Shouldn't my lawyer be here if you talk to me? - Three's a crowd, love. - Excuse me? Don't get me wrong. She's a terrific lawyer. She's really top-notch. And I mean that. Seems there's a lot of chemistry there between you and your ex-wife. There's a lot of chemistry in chernobyl. You know what's interesting. We both have something in common. - Oh yeah. - We both married up. You really miss him, do you? Victor? You're the expert. When I say I loved my husband, what do you see? Well, you can love a man and kill him. Or have him killed. Look me in the eye and tell me you believe I killed my husband. Tell me about those 40 minutes you can't remember. Find whoever murdered Victor and I'll tell you whatever you want. I see. You got someone in mind then. Victor gave me more than I ever wanted. We were partners in everything. All the charities. I converted to catholicism so I could share that with him too. Why would I end that? What the hell is going on?! - I'm tampering with your client. - Is he always this relentless? To the point of self-destruction. Officer! You wanted your father's money, didn't you?! You were desperate and you wanted his money, so you framed your stepmother. The hell I did! That's crazy! See, that's wrong. The worst thing you can do is match your questioner's intensity. Instead give a firm, deliberate answer. Here, watch. The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.</i> You lie! It's not true. The president clenches his jaw, slight hints of anger, then he modulates his voice and folds his hands. OK? Now, Mr. O'Sullivan, - did you murder Victor Musso? - Certainly not. Good. Simple. Direct. Truthful. See, I know how to handle myself under pressure, Dr. Foster. I was Vic's right hand for 25 years. Riding his coattails for 25 years. I was CFO for a "fortune 500" company. One last tip. Women require more eye contact than men to feel a connection. So, I want you both to focus your attention on the female jurors. Got it? Anything to put that gold-digger away. Where was that loyalty when your father was alive? She came onto me, OK?! Since it was my client you illegally tampered with, judge Quinn has given me the authority to keep you in here or release you. Oh yeah? You bought her a drink or 3 then? Give me one good reason I should let you out of here. One good reason? - Just one. - Well... How about you need me? You know, a room like this in our house could have saved our marriage. Goodbye, Cal. Your client's innocent, by the way. I found out while I was tampering with her. Think I'll take a nap. Don't pretend you don't need my help! - Why do you do it? - Do what? Keep forcing us together like this. Paging Dr. Kinsey. Do you want to switch to my side? What? And stop all this fun we're having here? You must be joking. The fact of the matter is, your client's innocent and the jury are about to convict her. - No, they're not. - Yeah, they are. Please. - Fair enough. You're the boss. - Stop it. A little role playing never hurt anyone. I should let you rot in here. Can't argue with you there, darling. Marshall, here's the authorization for what I'm sure will be a huge mistake. Clara didn't care about me or my father. She just wanted his money.</i> Let's pretend the jury's watching. OK? Now, tell them exactly how Clara seduced you. It was a week after she had interviewed my dad about the clinics he built in Africa. She was at our ranch. I didn't know that they had already become involved. She wanted a tour. I was showing her the wine cellar. And that's when it happened. All right. That was good eye contact and posture, Damien. But remember, fold your hands to avoid fidgeting. Got it. How many times did you have sex? Maybe 6 or 7. The maybe undercuts your credibility with the jurors. Especially with these 2. All right. Give them a specific number. Seven. But when she found out that I didn't have money and that it was all in a trust until I was 40, she dumped me. The next thing I know, she's engaged to my father, and he is changing his will. Where was the last place you and Clara had sex? I don't know. They all kind of run together. Let's get some caffeine. It always helps me focus. So, tell me what happened in the wine cellar. I was showing her my dad's collection, and she asked to see my belt buckle. And you took it off or did she? She did. Help yourself. All right, you just watch the images. And we'll monitor your reactions on the outside. Give me the finger. That's charming isn't it? Are you this hands-on with all your clients? I'm not afraid to get a little dirty when necessary. So you say you didn't kill your husband. I believe you're innocent. I can't say this feels like a vote of confidence. Well, you still don't remember what happened that night, So, a few faces from the case might jog your memory. Have fun. How is this supposed to help jog her memory? It's not. It's nonsense. But since she's lying to us about those 40 minutes, we're coming at it from another angle. Flag that one. Contempt when she looks at Damien. Your stepson says you're sleeping together the same time you're bedding daddy... that can bring contempt. In my country, a new member of the royal family. Flag that one. Push in on her hand. Who's that woman she's reacting to? That's Tanya Wilson. It's a close friend of Clara's. She comes to court every day to support her. That hand closing like that... is anger. What happened in the 40 minutes you left Victor? - <i>What I don't remember.</i> - <i>That's bullocks, Clara.</i> - Who killed your husband? - You know I don't. That's enough. Too right it is. You're lying. I can't help you. Uncooperative witness... That's common. Uncooperative client... That's rare. Crosby hired us as experts. Can't you just tell her you're sure she didn't do it? It's a matter of pride for Crosby at this point. You know, what passes for truth in a courtroom isn't necessarily the whole truth. I love you too. Out. Clara was trying to hide her anger toward Tanya. I need some background. Right. And we saw Clara's contempt for Damien. What does she say about her affair with him? She's adamant it never happened. Damien came onto her. She said no. It's he said, she said. When I was prepping him, I asked them about their last sexual encounter, he just stood there holding a pot of coffee. He couldn't fill his cup while giving the details. Manual tasks are harder to integrate when you're faking a story. Yeah, but I believed him the first time around. What if his story is an obsessive fantasy? If he played it out in his head enough, he could have said it happened without showing any signs of deception. So, Clara rejects Damien for his father, - who's shadow he lives in. - It could have driven him to murder. We need to get Damien back in here. Now, that's dangerous. You think I need more prep work before I testify? There are a few more techniques Dr. Lightman wants to go over. Anything for my father. You slut. That's pure science. How was it? All right, come on. Damien, you lied! You were never involved with Clara were you? - She seduced me! - You're pathetic, Damien. - You're pathetic! - How could you do this? We wanted to see how angry it made you to see her with somebody else. You think I killed my father? You've been lying. She is a gold-digger! - How can you say that? - It was your plan! - I loved your father! - No, you used him! Let's go! Come on. Let it go. Fair enough. I expected a little bit more than a slap from the world's most notorious murder suspect. Yeah. I guess I've been respectable for too long. I think I can help you with that. Doc, Damien Musso called my office this morning. He said you all but accused him of murder. Clara didn't kill her husband, right? I see. You switched sides. How can I compete with legs, cleavage & associates. You can't. You must be cleavage. Legs here is twice the lawyer you're ever gonna be. You know that affair Damien said he had with Clara? He was lying. Call him to the stand. It's perjury. - We had a contract, doc. - I render my services as an expert. We prepped your witnesses for you. We read your jury. Job done. It's going to be a long time before you get any business from my office. I'm devastated. Really? - I'll see you in there, counselor. - You bet! - That's interesting. - What? He's not worried at all about Damien. He doesn't give a toss about me coming over to the other side. If anything, he's more confident than usual. He's up to something. Why did you hire a private investigator to look into Clara's past? I'd been friends with Victor since we were 10 years old in catechism at St. Bernard's. When I realized Victor was getting serious about Clara, I wanted to make sure her intentions were sincere... As a friend first and as a business partner. And did the investigator find anything criminal? She reinvented herself though. New name. New hair color. New resume. Breaking with the past isn't always easy. To your knowledge, was Victor happy in his marriage? Yes. But he didn't have all the facts. Reviewing the estate yesterday, I discovered something... Objection. Any information he has about the estate should have been brought forth in deposition. Are you certain that you made the discovery yesterday? - Yes. I'm certain. - No, he's lying, your honor. He's been sitting on it. So has the DA. That's absurd. Your honor, I move to clear the whole gallery. Muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau, or I will. Proceed with your finding. When I looked at Victor's sub-accounts, I discovered monthly withdrawals of roughly $90,000, Spread across the last year and a half. Clara was stealing from him. He's not lying. Motion for recess, your honor. I need time to research these claims. You can recall the witness when prosecution rests, Ms. Landau. - You're leaving? - That jury's 12 to nothing to convict. You're screwed. If Clara stole money from her husband, why did we switch sides? Lightman screwed up? Foster always says, the closer you are to someone emotionally, the harder it is to get a true read. - Yeah, but Clara is a stranger. - Zoe isn't. Anything she touches, Lightman is going to bring baggage to it. Speaking of baggage, you want to unload some of your own, like that memory that Lightman saw? What? What kind of age difference are we talking about here? 10 years? We're not discussing this. Did you violate state laws? Decency laws? It was a totally legal and healthy relationship. That's exciting. Come on. Give me something. What are you hiding? At least give me his name. Denise Watson. Tanya Wilson, as I live and breathe. Clara's best mate. Why's she so angry with you then? - I didn't know that she was. - Really? - How long have you two been friends? - Don't have to talk. That's true. That's true. But I'll see to that while you explain to a jury why you got so scared when Leo testified that Clara was stealing from her husband. I was scared for Clara as a friend. Were you two in it together? Were your robbing the old man blind? As I was going through a tough time. Clara was helping me out. See, there's that fear again. I think you're hiding something. I think you're here just to make sure she keeps her mouth shut. Ridiculous. I smell blackmail. Of a sexual variety. What is it? Is it you and Clara? You and Victor? Wait. Three's a crowd, right? You and Victor... and Clara. What you got on him? You got photos? You got video? - You got dirty knickers? - I had nothing to do with his death. My money's on video. I think you got a sex tape. About... 90 grand a month's worth. Clara met him through me. Her life was supposed to be mine. It's not like they were going to miss it. Thanks for that. Now, if you want to stay out of jail, I'm gonna need that sex tape. It was Vic's 60th birthday, and I wanted to do something he'd never forget. In every other way he was conservative. But this was a fantasy of his. So, Tanya and I got together. We were friends at that point or so I thought. So, those 40 minutes that you claim you can't remember... All right... That's when you nipped out to pay off Tanya. Yeah? It was meant to stop. But when I got there, she said that the payments... - were going to keep going. - You couldn't tell your husband? Or your lawyer? It would have confirmed what people had been saying. And his reputation meant the world to him. You're willing to go to jail to preserve that reputation? True love. I know. It's absolute insanity. I'm innocent, Zoe. And I thought maybe you could somehow make the jury see that. Speaking of the jury, we've been reading them, and they're 12 to nothing to convict. It's one thing to say you're innocent. But you gotta show them who's guilty. - We know we can rule out Damien. - Who else has access to your house? The only other person with a key was Leo. - He just smeared you in court. - I was stealing. He stands to benefit financially if you're convicted. He's the executor of the estate. There is no way. Vic and Leo were more than business partners. - They were like brothers. - So was Brutus and Caesar. Put me back on the stand again. What? Just ask, Loker. So, you sleep with women too? You just went to a whole new level of blunt. Well, it has serious ramifications. My competition may have just doubled. I was curious, OK? Denise was funny and interesting. And I liked her smile. - I didn't make a life choice. - Right. So, just to confirm. Not bisexual then. It was experimenting, Loker. And you know, why can girls do it and guys can't? Where's the fantasy in that? Anyways, who really cares what people do in their bedrooms. Everyone. So... This... experiment. What were your findings? Scientifically speaking. You hold yourself out as an arbiter of people's honesty, yet time and again you've reversed yourself Yeah, well, scientists, see, they admit their mistakes. Ex-wives, that's an entirely different story. The fact is your science is completely unreliable. You're a glorified fortuneteller. A hack. All right, let's see if the jury agrees, shall we? The foreman, he's high as a kite, and he has been all along. That one, she's getting off on Clara's misery, she is. And those 2, they're having an affair. They're doing the dirty back at the hotel. Both of them married to different people. And that one has got a serious - foot fetish. - Dr. Lightman, - for God's sake! - Well, no. My point is I can read anyone here. Right. Not just the defendant or the judge. If you're hiding something, I'll know it. And yet you never turn that scrutiny on yourself. Why is that? That would terrify you, wouldn't it? To be striped bare the way you strip the people around you. I'm not a killer, counselor. But neither is Clara Musso. - Move to strike, your honor. - Sustained. The real killer has been hiding in plain sight all along. He's in this very courtroom as we speak. Objection! Speculation! Dr. Lightman, this court has indulged you more than enough. Step down now, please. Please. Please step down before I have you arrested. If you're gonna arrest somebody, You should arrest Leo O'Sullivan. He killed his best friend. - Quiet everyone! - You bastard! I didn't murder Vic. I'd never! That's the truth, see. You didn't murder him. But you did kill him, didn't you? What does that mean. Leo killed Victor but he didn't murder him? When he said he didn't murder Victor, there was no sign of deception, right? But when I asked him if he killed his friend, he flashed regret. - Look, if I recall Leo to the stand... - We crack the case. He's right on the edge. He just needs one more shove. - Spit it out then. - Well, since you asked. When is killing your friend a good thing? Please be seated. I thought I kicked your ex-husband out of my courtroom, counselor? Dr. Lightman is essential for my client's defense, your honor. He's just here to observe. He won't be a nuisance to the court. Well, if he is, he will be the guest of the county for the next 30 days. Are we clear, Dr. Lightman? - As a bell, your honor. - Proceed. Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind you that you are still under oath. I'd like to apologize for the previous outburst. It's clear to everyone \in this court how close you were to Victor Musso. You were his best friend, his lifelong confidant. And you, would do anything to protect him. And his reputation. That's true. I'd like to show the witness some photos, if I may. - Objection! - No. You can't. There were no pictures submitted during discovery. Easy love, jury's watching. - Sidebar, your honor? - Please. You can't let them see those pictures. Everything Vic work for would be ruined. If you try and stop this, I'll do those 30 days with bells on, after I finish blurting it out to the jury. These could do irreparable harm to the reputation of the deceased. I don't know how this is germane to the case. It speaks to the accusation that Clara was stealing from her husband. I don't want to besmirch a good man if I don't have to. But I do reserve the right to present these in open court. I take your point, counselor. - Please. - Thank you. You want to see Clara Musso locked up for murder. She betrayed a man who loved her. She was sleeping with his son for God sakes. Thanks to Dr. Lightman, that's been exposed as a lie. - She was stealing from him. - Which you knew about. - And yet you never said a word. - He was completely under her spell. - I was protecting him. - Well, I submit to you that Clara was doing the same. Protecting him. And the money you say my client was stealing from him Was in fact being put to a good and noble cause. Am I being clear enough here, Mr. O'Sullivan? Perfectly, counselor. You also knew she didn't kill her husband. But you thought she deserved to go to prison anyway, didn't you? After all, you had built a company and a reputation side-by-side with Victor for 25 years. And overnight, your best friend became a different person. - Clara had displaced you. - No! When it mattered, Vic called me. There we go. Watch this. - Hold on to your seat, love. - Like when it came to his health? That's fear. But without shame. He's proud of what he did. You didn't murder him, Leo. He asked you to end his life, didn't he? Objection! Overruled. How was Mr. Musso's health just prior to his death? You're under oath. He was... - Secretly very sick. - That's why he wanted you to help him end his life, to assist his suicide. That right? - Objection, your honor! - The court is very interested in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer. He had a degenerative brain disease. Doctors gave him a month or two. You bought the cyanide and the syringe. He called you to his home. And you gave him that injection, didn't you? - Your honor! - Take your seat. Victor was devout. I mean, to him suicide was a mortal sin. I couldn't say no to my friend. Which is why you never told him that Clara was stealing. Because he was dying. Why break his heart on top of everything else? Do you have proof it wasn't a murder? - He left a video explaining. - Now that right there. That is shame. I think his widow has a right to see that. But I didn't imagine that I'd meet a woman who would understand me so completely. Our marriage was a gift, Clara. Happiest 10 years of my life. I wouldn't let anything tarnish that. Zoe says that Leo is pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and manslaughter. And they're working out a deal. That's good then. Thank you for everything. I should have trusted you sooner. I could say the same thing. I've got a meeting waiting. She's a beautiful woman. She's my Leo. What about Zoe? To say you stopped loving someone you once loved more than anything else in the world, I mean that would be a lie. But you move on. Don't you? You have to move on. She's my daughter's mum. Sometimes sparring partner. Any other women populating your life? None you need to worry about. I'm taking over Victor's businesses and charities. People are going to come after me. They think I'm weak. I need someone I can trust. You got my number. So, to speak. My point is, right, that the reason that we won was 'cause the whole truth came out. Which no, cause it doesn't normally happen in a courtroom. Why'd you take this case? I thought it'd be a bit of fun. That's not it. Not really. It's your first time out there. It's a big national case. You were protecting me? That's so sweet. And paternalistic and patronizing. Yeah. You got a point there. No, but look. If you get a guilty woman off, you're a punch line. If you convict an innocent man, you're a joke. You've worked far too hard to get where you are. You deserve a bit of respect. Not infamy. Still waiting for you to get what you deserve. Well, I'm 2 steps ahead of the hangman. Emily's sleeping at a friend's.
