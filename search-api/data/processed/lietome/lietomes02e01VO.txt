your posture, the words you choose. Because of Dr. Lightman's scientific discoveries, we know that these signs are the same... Laying it on a bit thick, isn't she? It's called selling books, dad. Shut up and bask. Give him 5 minutes and 20 questions, and he'll know whether you went off to Argentina to cheat on your wife, lied about a well-timed stock sale, or... murdered a one-night stand. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the world's foremost deception expert and one of America's preeminent scientists, author of <i>Lies We Tell</i>, Dr. Cal Lightman. She's right when she says I'll know if you're lying, but what I wanna know is why. That's still your secret. Any questions? Dr. Lightman. Thanks for coming. How come no one ever looks me in the eye at these things? Cool tattoo. - Who do I make it out to? - Trisha, please. You're the world's biggest expert on lying? When he's not being a dad or a big-time author. So you'll know I'm telling the truth. The police don't believe me. No one does. I... I just really need someone to believe me. I saw a murder. I didn't "see it" see it, but I saw it In a vision, a psychic vision, but I know it really happened. Am I telling the truth? Yes, you are. - Where are we going? - Surprise. Divorce present. Wasn't planning to toast the demise of my marriage, but thanks. - How you feeling? - Horrible, depressed, like a loser. - You're happy. - I'm not happy. I'm devastated. Trisha Howell, she's a Georgetown law student, and she claims she had a psychic vision... of a murder. I understand the scientist in you sees every day as an opportunity to discover something new and wonderful about the brain, but come on... - You don't believe in psychics. - As of now, I'm Switzerland. Plus our plate is too full for this. We have a potential Supreme Court nominee to vet. I do believe there's a scientific explanation for what she saw. Trisha Howell, this is Gillian Foster. Why don't you tell Foster here about your vision. I started writing it down, but... I saw a man... Tall, short black hair, blue eyes. He's in a hotel, room 202, he's freaking out. There's blood... all over. Whose blood was it? Did you see a victim? Just... an ashtray smashing down, and then he's running, and... The hotel sign has some kind of a devil on it. It's by that druggie park over off of L street. Can you excuse us for just one moment? That's a smooth exit line. It's very professional. This is a matter for the police or a magic 8-ball. These are the options: 1... Trisha's ill; 2: she actually is a psychic; 3: she witnessed the murder and no one believes her. In any of these cases, she needs our help, right? Agt. Reynolds is waiting with J. Simon. Potential supreme court nominee. Right. Here he is. Judge Simon, this is Dr. Cal Lightman. Glad you could clear your schedule on such short notice. I couldn't, actually. This is Ria Torres. She's gonna determine whether or not you're a lying son of a bitch. Just one... The president specifically asked for you. You do know I can tell when you're lying. How 'bout this? Vetting this guy is the F.B.I.'s responsibility, and you have a contractual obligation to give F.B.I. cases top priority. Lightman group has that obligation, not Lightman proper. Torres is a natural. She's gonna do fine. Fine's not gonna cut it. If this guy's got some deep, dark sec... - He does. We all do. - Let me be clear. My ass is on the line. - I was just gonna call you. - I saved you the trouble. Hi, Ben. Testy ex-wife trumps testy F.B.I. agent. Excuse us. We're not done. - Always nice to see you, Zoe. - Nice to see you, Ben. Emily says you've been good weird. She's concerned. I quit the Department of Justice. I'm moving to Chicago to head up my own practice. What does Emily have to say about this? Doesn't know yet and since she'll wonder why I'm not going in to work, I figured we should probably tell her before then, say, today. Chicago's a nice town. Not close, though. You're always the one who said if I had any guts, I'd start my own law firm. But, Chicago? You remember Dave Gruber from law school? The handsy, flirty guy. You're gonna work for this guy? I'm not gonna be working for him. I'm gonna be running a new branch of his law firm. Still not your firm, though. I knew you'd try to make me change my mind, and I'm not going to. It's done, so just be happy for me. - I am happy for you. - Good. It'd just be quite an adjustment for Emily. It'll take time. She's an amazing kid. You wanna take Emily to Chicago. I've already made a schedule where you can have her for the holidays, and you're free to come to Chicago any time you want. We can make this work. I'm not saying it's not selfish, but the right thing for me also happens to be the right thing for Emily. Don't do that. You know I hate it when you do that. Thanks for waiting, J. Simon. I came here fully prepared to be vetted by an expert. How old are you? 24. Let's get started. Where's the girl? There was a girl in there claiming Psychic abilities. Where is she? Where's the girl? Do we have funds for a study on herd behavior? - The girl, where is she? - She left. And you let her? I run a research lab, not a prison. She wanted to leave, she left. Where are you going? None of my business. Check. Power of nonverbal communication. Awesome. Love it. You got a room? You lookin' for company? Not in this economy. I'll settle for the porn package. That does appear to be blood. We need to find the girl. I assume you wanna bring her downtown. The girl with the psychic visions? Why don't we just have her Give us tomorrow's lottery numbers, and we can all retire early? Nice to meet you. This is what you dragged me down here for. Every hotel room this side of town is gonna be ripe with blood and various other human discharges. No body, no crime. I'm gettin' back to the judge. I suggest you do the same. That's it for your most prominent cases. Let's move on to your family. Celia, your wife, tell me about her. What would you like to know? I guess the big one is: have you ever cheated on her? I can't imagine any senator on the judiciary committee asking me that. That's not... I just... I have to ask you. The answer's no. So you've never been interested in another woman in that time? Never. Really? You never cheated? He said no. Did you ever cheat on your taxes? And I've been paying them longer than you've been breathing air. My age really bothers you. In my experience, anybody under the age of 35 normally doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground. So, yes, The fact that you're standing between me and a position on the Supreme Court of the United States of America does not thrill me. Found this under the bed. Who are you? What do you want? Don't you know me? I know you. You and me, we're old friends, babe. Tell me your name. Why should I? It's Jessie. I'm Cal Lightman. We met earlier today. Only, then you were someone else. I'll be anybody you want me to be. I wanna spend some time with you. Not like that. I want you to meet some friends of mine. Gonna cost you extra. I'll expect it to worth. The camera, the strange white room. She's afraid. And we're about to get funky. This is from 4 hours ago... Right before she ran out of here. Shoulders back. Chest out. Totally different posture. Totally different girl. Hello, hair. Trisha walked into that room, and Jessie walked out. For funsies, I had... Hooker Jessie write down her coffee order, and I compared that to law student Trisha's account of her so-called vision. Night and day. These 2 documents indicate 2 fundamentally different personalities. Trisha's got it, this multiple personality disorder. - The holy grail of psychiatry. - This... is your divorce present. It's dissociative identity disorder, and it's more plausible than a psychic phenomenon, just barely. Of course, if it is D.I.D., there's empirical evidence of explicit memory transfer in such cases. She could have perceived that as a vision. - So her alter witnessed a murder. - Or committed a murder. This girl didn't hurt anyone. If she had, her other personalities would never have let her come to me. Jessie probably isn't the only alter. Right. You know I can see you all out there staring at me. What the hell? Just giving you some privacy. Met some freaks in my time, but this place is perv central. You might have a point there. Guess if you're payin' for it. Why'd you sneak into that hotel room? Why did you? Were you trying to cover up a crime? Lip curl, forced eye contact. You're lying. I'm not some lab rat. Did you kill somebody? Heart rate, blood pressure, all steady. It's not sure, but she's believable. I'm gonna go see how Jessie feels about hypnosis. Bring your wallet. You presided over 16 cases before your 35th birthday, starting with Cahill v. Wilson. Then Abandandou v. Temple. Ohio v. George. All right, Ohio v. George. Why do you have that reaction to that case? What reaction? A drifter named Bryce George raped 56-year-old Margaret Lane. Where's agent Reynolds? Busy. You gave him life in prison for a first offense? You think I should have given him a lesser sentence? Agent Reynolds doesn't know we've started up again, right? Did you have a personal relationship with Margaret Lane? I may be 24, but I have a talent for spotting lies. Move on, Ms. Torres. You really shouldn't speak that way to the person standing between you and the supreme court. Just listen to my voice and float. As you listen to my voice, keep breathing, getting heavier with each exhale, again, allowing yourself to fall into a deep... Deep... ... sleep. In their conscious lives, the alters aren't aware of each other. Hopefully hypnosis will allow Foster to tap into their shared unconscious. - Torres is in over her head. - You know, I could... I could jump in on that. I'm just saying I have seniority, and if the wrong guy gets put on the supreme court, I mean, that could really affect the whole future of the... ... country. Yeah, I'm fine here. Now that you're fully relaxed, you can open your eyes. Is it OK if I ask you a few questions? Sure. Can you tell me about Trisha? - Her. - You don't like her? She thinks she's so perfect. Anyway, Gavin likes me way better. Who's Gavin? My best friend. Why don't you tell me about him? I don't want to. Well, maybe Trisha can tell me about him. Can I speak to her? Hi, Dr. Foster. What... What am I doing here? I met Jessie today. You two don't get along. She's very crass. Jessie was telling me about Gavin. She would. She thinks he adores her. Trisha, did anything bad happen to you? Anything when you were younger? The bad things happen to R.J. That's a new name. - Can I talk to her? - You mean him. R.J. doesn't talk to people. R.J.'s strong. Nobody can hurt him. He protects the rest of us. I don't wanna think about this anymore. You're doing great. No problem. OK, close your eyes. On my count, you're gonna wake up feeling refreshed. You'll be totally yourself. Trois... Deux... Un... Trisha, you're... You're safe. Trisha, you're safe. Trisha. - Trisha, you're safe. - I'm not Trisha. I'm Sophie. I'm sophie. I'm sophie. I'm sophie. I'm sophie. I'm Dr. Cal Lightman. This is Dr. Gillian Foster. Try to relax, please. - I don't wanna be in a hospital. - It's not a hospital. It may look kind of weird, but this is where I work. You came to me. Which one of me? You know about the other personalities? You know about Trisha and... ... Jessie and... and R.J.? They stole my life. Sophie, are you the core personality? I'm the real person, the doctors say. What did they do? They did something bad? We believe one of your personalities witnessed a murder. Trisha came to me because she thought I could help. God. Why? She tried the police, but they didn't believe her. The work I do here is determining the truth, and I do believe her. I think we can help you. You can't help me. Nobody can help me. There's a murderer out there who may know who you are. We need to prove a crime happened to get the police involved. Can you tell me who Gavin is? I don't know. You're safe here. You can trust us. I promise. Gavin's my brother. I don't... ... see him, ever. Jessie does. Starting with Cahill v. Wilson, Then Abandandou v. Temple, Ohio v. George. Look. Right there. 5C. That's fear. If you say so. He doesn't want me anywhere near that case. OK, watch this. Ohio v. George was a rape case. Nicole Lane was the victim's daughter. And now he will never hurt another woman. Judge Simon did the right thing. He's a noble man, and I'll always be grateful. Her pupils dilate when she talks about him. That's arousal. And her voice gets all gooey. Well, you expect me to tell the president not to nominate this guy because 20 years ago, some woman's voice got all gooey. Have you even talked to her? She died. Ovarian cancer 2 years ago. But watch this. It's the same face. I am telling you, he had an affair with Nicole Lane during that trial. Or maybe you just don't like the guy. - Excuse me? - Come on. I'm no face reader, - but even I can see it. - He's a liar. A liar who had an affair with someone involved in a case he was deciding. He doesn't deserve to be on the supreme court. Maybe. Maybe not, but, see, the problem is the second that this got personal, you lost the right to make that decision. Hi. How you doing? Gavin Howell? - I'm... - Jessie? Oh, my god. What happened to your sister? Well, whatever it was, you blame yourself, don't you? The two of us spent summers at our grandparents' farm in upstate New York. For me, it was heaven. Not for Sophie? I didn't know till I was 10, and she was 13. I walked into the barn, and my grandfather... ... did things to her. It was evil. When did you first start seeing a change in her, - that she was different? - Jessie showed up the next summer, selling herself to local kids. Trisha came later. They visit you. Jessie does. She crashes in my shed when she's had a rough night, but I... Not lately. I haven't seen her in months. I really stay here? Scared the hell out of me first time you showed up. Does anything feel familiar, Sophie? I got that bike for my seventh birthday. I smell that bad, Gavin? You're holding your breath, which could mean you're tense or upset... Or it could mean you're hiding something. Exhale marks the spot. I'm sorry. I really can't protect you, can I? Kyle Arnow. Did I kill him? - Hi. - Yes? Sorry about the intrusion. I was just driving by, and I saw your car. - It's a beautiful car. - Thank you. - I don't suppose it's for sale. - It's my husband's. A man is in love with your car. Good taste. I had the interior completely restored about 6 years ago. That's a nice job. I found... This. And... I thought you were dead. - Where'd you get that? - It's clue in a murder investigation. Murder? What are you talking about? - So you didn't do it, then. - You have to go away. - Does your wife know you like hookers? - No, because I don't. Because the only thing I didn't find in your wallet was a condom. Why don't we ask your wife. How your wallet ended up covered in blood at a murder scene, shall we? Two working girls robbed me at some hotel downtown. I fought back, and I ran, but that's not my blood, so how about you just mind your own damn business? What? Your husband likes unprotected sex with hookers, so it might be a good time to get yourself tested for... You know. Everything, really. Nice car, Kyle. Let's say Sophie didn't kill anybody. Or Jessie or Trisha. But there's another personality out there, a male personality, R.J. - But we don't even know if he exists. - I think he does. I think he's the protector, the one who emerges when there are violent situations. What if he perceived Sophie to be in trouble? Who knows what could have happened? But it doesn't make him a killer, does it? He could have witnessed the murder. Things get ugly. - Jessie gets scared. - And transitions into R.J., the protector, meaning... It was R.J. that Trisha saw in her vision. R.J. running down a street. R.J. washing off the blood. We talk to R.J., we'll get to the truth. Sometimes I wake up, and I'm walking across the Georgetown quad with a backpack full of books I've never seen, or I'm in a changing room trying on an outfit I've never picked out, or the worst one, I'm... I'm stumbling out of some guy's car. I just wanna be me. Well, you'll get there, love. Maybe... One day, one of 'em will take over for good, and I'll just be gone. Hey, so mom said you wanted to talk to m... Bad timing. Hi. I'm sorry. Unlike my dad, I'm not normally totally insensitive. That's OK. You hungry? Let's get a snack. - Is she OK? - Yeah. No, not really. Well, did she really witness a murder? That's nothing for you to think about. All right? I wanna talk to you about something else. Just please tell me you and mom aren't, like, getting back together or something. Ah, no, no. Something's come up for your mum. Not now! Remember when I said, "no body, no crime"? I just got off the phone with my detective friend. There's a body, a prostitute by the name of Amber O'Malley. She's been known to work out of the Devil May Care hotel. That changes things. The cops, they wanna talk to your girl, I mean like right now. They're on their way up. All right? - You should get home. - OK. Bye. - And we'll talk about this later. - OK. - You driving? - Yeah. - Let's go. - What's up? Cops found a body. They wanna talk to you. Where's Foster? Bathroom. Why? I need to talk to RJ. Dr. Lightman, what's going on? Now, before I do this, I want you to know that I'm sorry. What's happening? What's going on? Take your clothes off. What? Take your clothes off, you dirty, filthy whore. Take your clothes off. No, no, no! I can smell your stink from here. You're vile. I'm not! Help me! - No one's gonna help you. - Cal! Open the door! Cal! What's goin' on? Get the master key. - Cal! - Lightman! I should do them all a favor. I should kill you right now. - Please. No, please. - Open this door! Fight back! Fight back, you son of a bitch. Fight back. Cal, what are you doing? Open this door. Open the damn door! What the hell? Enough! Get off. Come on. Have you lost your mind? Tell me what happened in that hotel room. Tell me what happened in that hotel room! I'm trying to protect you, just the same as you are! This is over! I'm takin' her in. Who killed the other prostitute? Tell me. Who killed Amber? Who killed the other prostitute. Say something! Say something! He can't. He can't. - Alters are one-dimensional. - Let's go for a ride. - Watch him. - R.J. is the protector. He never needed to talk. He never needed to talk. Reynolds! Reynolds! What? Give me one minute with her. Just give me one minute. I promise I'll weigh in on the judge. I promise. I know you wanna help Sophie. You've been trying to help her all along, haven't you? Now, you showed Trisha. She thought she was having visions, but... You were showing her what happened, weren't you? Now, Trisha's seen pieces. If you wanna help Sophie, Trisha needs to see all of it. You understand? Now, I know you can't tell me, But you can show her... Can't you? Dr. Lightman. Trisha? I just had another vision. I know who killed the girl. Judge. Thanks for staying so late. Right. Tell the truth, whole truth, nothing but the truth, we'll have you out of here in a jiffy. If not, we'll squash your nomination like a little bug. You got it? Got it. Good. Nicole Lane. Why'd you have sex with her? I told her and I'll tell you I didn't. Would you say you were in love with her? Nicole came to the courtroom every day. I was young, and I shouldn't have, but I... spoke with her a couple of times in the hallway, always briefly. But there were feelings... Inappropriate feelings. Then she asked to see me in my chambers one day. We kissed... Just once. Do you think your feelings for her affected your judgment in the case? Did that kiss affect the sentence? My behavior was improper and unethical, and I deeply regret it, but it did not affect the sentence. Right. I think we're done here. I think it best that I withdraw my name. Why? You were young. Your feelings got in the way, you made a mistake, But you've lived a good life since then. Let's hope the president agrees with you. Judge Simon, let me walk you out. You write this up, But you choose your words carefully. Why'd you put me on this case? You knew I wasn't ready. Well, far as I can tell, you nailed it. Look, what do you wanna be when you grow up? I am grown-up. Terrific. Who are you? I'm... I'm a... You're on your way to becoming one of the world's leading experts in deception. But up here, you're still a baggage screener at the airport. Till you change that, you'll always think you're not ready. When I was 14, my boyfriend robbed a convenience store. I was in the car. I knew he was gonna do it, didn't know he'd have a gun. Nobody got hurt, but somebody could have. So for me, baggage screener was a big step up. Well, keep steppin', then. Hey, baby. Where you been? You miss me? No. Figured you'd be in jail by now. Figured you'd be in jail by now. I don't follow. We both know I was there for your little tantrum the other night. We both know I was there for your little tantrum the other night. That's crazy talk. Why didn't you just send her in as the hooker? The hooker doesn't know the story. Sophie does, and the hookers are liar. Sophie remembers what happened? Not exactly. R.J. used their shared consciousness to show Trisha. Trisha told Lightman. Lightman told Sophie. Now it's important for Sophie to get her power back. I'm not sure she's pulling it off. She's definitely not Jessie. What do you want? The same thing we all want, darlin', money. Money in my pocket, you give me that, I'll give you the wallet, you want so bad. What wallet? The one with Amber's blood all over it, - your fingerprints, too. - Your fingerprints. It proves you killed her. I didn't kill that bitch. Yeah, you did. You were angry we robbed that John. You came, you swag that ashtray at her head. You would've done the same thing to me if I hadn't gotten out of there. She's gonna transition. He hasn't admitted to anything. No good. If she slips into Jessie or R.J, we're done. She's gonna have no idea - what's going on. - Sophie, you're doin' fine. Hang in there. Hang in there. Sophie, you hear me? Sophie, are you there?! Sophie, hang in there. Sophie, he won't hurt you till he knows where that wallet is. Back off, Trent. You'd better give me that wallet. 5 grand, it's yours. I don't have 5 grand. Too bad, then. I told you and Amber to stop rolling johns in here. It was driving away customers. I wouldn't have done her if you had behaved right. We're good. Let's go. Run! Get out of there! Freeze! You did it. You did it. You're OK. You did good. You did good. You did it. You are all right. Cal, I'm sorry it's happening like this. I really am. It's for your share of the Lightman Group. I'm buying you out. Don't do this. You got it in the divorce. It's your money. You earned it. Look, 15 different ways I come up with today. Money just shows up opportunity comes your way. Just one small con. - You'd've been none the wiser. - I'd have seen through that. You'd have suspected, but you wouldn't have known. But this is my daughter. Last couple of days, I've been teacher, boss, a colleague, pal, bastard. Just suits you put on, take off. What? So dad is your favorite suit? No, that's the only one that's not a suit. You can't afford this, and I have made a commitment. Everything you wanna do in Chicago, you can right here, except it'll be your own firm. If you take what's yours. I'm not saying its not selfish. It is. But it's the right thing for me. Also happens to be the right thing for you and Emily. In other news, it looks as though the president</i> has made a decision for a supreme court nomination.</i> - The president this morning... - Good morning. Announcing his pick for the opening on the supreme court.</i> Judge William Simon, a moderate from Ohio,</i> was considered a long shot last week.</i> I hope he made the right choice. He began his career as a attorney... I got a call from the bank first thing. They thought I'd know that the Lightman group's loan has been approved and the ownership shares have been transferred. I know. I bought our way out. Did you consider telling me, your partner, about this before you did it? Zoe was gonna take Emily, so I had to... Jeopardize the financial future of this company? That's a bit dramatic, isn't it? You know, I... I lied earlier when I said I was devastated about the divorce. I'm not. You know, for the first time in 5 years, when I get dressed in the morning, I don't automatically reach for black or brown or navy blue. I'm wearing pink today, Cal, pink, because I like pink. It makes me happy, which is something that I have not been for a very long time. I'm divorced, and I'm free, and I'm happy, and if you do something to screw that up... I won't. I promise I won't. Push comes to shove, I can always go to Vegas, make the money back, Don't even joke about that.
