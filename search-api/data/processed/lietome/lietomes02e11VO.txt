Someone's got to set your students straight about my work. Just pointing out the flaws. And you're doing a fine job. Have you always been like this? No, we're far more civil now. I'd like to have seen Lightman at Oxford. Back when he was a real student of psychology. Are you sure you want me sabotaging your students? But I don't have another lecture ready, so you're on. - Fine. - <i>People have to know.</i> Whether or not their president's a crook.</i> I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got. I love this guy. You see how he's looking down and he's nodding? He's contradicting his own statement. He hesitates before saying he's earned everything he's got. And notice the crossed arms. He's defensive. Which means he's full of it. He's not nodding his head. He's looking down at his notes. Being defensive doesn't mean you're lying. One of these things by itself may not be conclusive, when you put them together, they add up to deception. Or you're looking for things to prove deception so you find them. If Lincoln were showing in the same behaviors, what would you say? I'd say he was Nixon in a Lincoln mask. All right, let's do a practical demonstration and then you guys can see for yourself. Any volunteer? How about you? Mister... Martin. Martin Walker. Right. So, I've got 10 pictures. Pick one, lie about what you're seeing or tell the truth, Dr. Lightman will read you. What about stakes? I read your book, Dr. Lightman. Without stakes, it's hard to spot a lie. There's no fear of being caught. 100 bucks says I can read you like a book. All right. A pretty girl. College age, I'd say. Ponytail. Blonde. Big eyes. And pale, pink blouse. You like the ladies, Martin? Yeah. What's not to like? You're talking out your ass, 'cause whatever you're seeing there you don't like it. What do you say now, Dr. Lightman? Double or quits. Guy tied to a chair. He's soaking wet. Being zapped with electric cables, like you'd use to jump start a car. Total rubbish. That's it for today's class. Our thanks to Dr. Lightman. Always entertaining and fascinating. We'll have to do this again. A bad day for Lightman way. Where are you going? Did you put him up to this? How? Your technique is foolproof, right? Here's the problem. Martin Walker's a psychopath, probably a killer. Just thought you should know. La <i>Lie To Team</i> presents: Episode 211: <i>Beat The Devil</i> In a healthy kid, you would expect to get arousal and revulsion. What we got in Martin was revulsion and arousal. Revulsion can appear to be arousal. Markers are similar. It says so right in your book. Those pictures aren't proof of anything, Dr. Lightman. We saw the same indicators in Ted Bundy. Bundy? He was a good-looking fella, killed about 60 women, give or take. Dr. Lightman is prone to the dramatic. Aren't we all? Please! Martin exposed your science to be flawed. Therefore he has to be punished? Dr. Foster, do you concur with your colleague? I didn't see what he saw, but reading facial cues isn't my specialty. It is mine, and I suggest you bring him in for psych evaluation. Without something more substantial, I can't justify that kind of action. All right. If the university isn't looking into at least one missing persons case, I'll eat my shoes. I think I'm on to something here. A sophomore girl went missing a month ago. The police have no evidence of foul play. It's an open case, and they don't have any leads. Except the one I'm giving you. I'll ask the police to talk to him, but quietly. In other words, you'll do sod all. Just say it. I haven't got a clue what you're on about. Fine. I'll say it for you. You're mad I didn't back you up. But Cal, I didn't see what you saw. Beating you twice doesn't make him a psychopath. Once. He only beat me once. Second time, I let him win because I wanted to see how much he got off on the humiliating me. All right, a lot of people out there might enjoy doing that, but they all know me. He doesn't. So yeah, I'm going to need his medical files and any psychological profile that might exist. You know that those are confidential. No time for ethics. Cal, you're crossing that line. Helen's crossed it. One should not shag one's students, especially not the psychopathic ones. I never said I saw aliens. I saw an unidentified flying object. Now, what is so loony about that? School board is gonna say there's a lot loony about it. I'm not crazy, Miss Torres. Frankly, corroborating your story is gonna be a little difficult. What did it look like? The overall Gestalt of the thing was... like a hockey puck or a jelly doughnut. Were you drinking or taking any medication? I was as dry as the Sahara. Would you describe what you saw as extraterrestrial? When the Greeks saw lightning in the sky, they attributed it to Zeus. And when the Aborigines witnessed Halley's Comet, they thought it was a mighty shaman. That's the trap that always ensnares us... the need to explain. This UFO claim seems like it's part of a pattern. Last year, you took the biology class to the county morgue. Then there was a 3am comet gazing workshop you held on the roof of the gentleman's lounge. It was a strip club, but it had the best view. We're not here to assess his lesson planning. When I saw the UFO, I called the local news. I called the airport. I called Maddox Air Force Base. I got stonewalled. Then somehow word got out that I'm proselytizing about little green men in the classroom, which I'm not. Conspiracy theory to your close encounter? - Can you give us a sec? - Sure. I'm seeing how he reacts to an attack. Lightman 101. Is he showing any markers of deception? You really want to take this case? What, is the guy an eccentric? Yes. Of course. Big time. And so am I. Have you seen this shirt? But I think he's being railroaded. Could he have really been the only person to have seen something so... Extraordinary? Listen, I stood in front of the mirror, I've asked myself "is this the face of a crackpot?" Well, maybe it is. But this crackpot is one hell of a science teacher. I love my job and I don't want to lose it. We're gonna do everything we can. I thought you were only here to humor me. What do you want from me? Old habits die hard. I'm writing down all the places that we followed him to and writing down every thing that he does in each spot. You better make a note. He's trolling for a victim. So's every guy in this spot. He's 25, single. He's out the door with that girl in 10 minutes. Any takers? I'll give you a ride home in my car. *** is good. You should alert the local police about this one. And tell 'em what? There's a guy going on a hot date? Here we go. - He made us. - It's about bloody time and all. You having fun playing Detective? This is Ben Reynolds of the FBI. Is he gonna give me a parking ticket? We can't have you hurting that girl, now can we, Martin? She's safe enough. Now she is, yeah. Hello, Martin. You knew I was coming. That's what predators do. They check out their territory. You killed that missing girl, didn't you? Of course not. I'm harmless. Now I know I'm right. I must admit, you had me going there, just for a minute. The police talked to me today about the missing girl, but you knew that. What about that girl tonight? And what were you gonna do to her? I was just gonna give her a ride home, like a good Samaritan. Thanks to you, she had to walk. I hope she made it okay. So are you just gonna follow me the rest of my life? I won't have to. You'll mess up. You know what my dissertation was on? How patience is adaptive. Hunters are at the top of the food chain, and they all take their time. Patience... I find is overrated. I noticed. You like to push... to make things happen. That's when people trip up. Most people. You're gonna lose this game. - It's not a game, Martin. - Sure, it is. You love it just as much as I do. I see it. You're leaking joy. I tell you what, you beat me, and I'll even give you back your 200 bucks. Good chess players think five moves ahead. Great chess players think one move ahead, but it's always the right move. All right, I want these everywhere. Hallways, coffee shop, bookstore... Any empty space, all right? Very subtle. Plan to stick around for the lawsuit? No. It's just where I want the man. In a courtroom. Really, Cal. When did you become such a Fascist? Pentagon, 2003, among other places. It shows. We both know this is not about Martin. This is about us. "Us" was 23 years ago. I think I'm over it. Interesting how you remember the exact number of years. Bloody fascinating, isn't it? You cannot quantify behavior, Cal, which is what you're trying to introduce to people. I provide a tool. All right, people misuse that tool, it's not my fault. Look at Martin, all right? He is a loony. If I'm right, you could be putting these women in danger. And if you're wrong... I'll recycle. One thing about Cal is he's insufferable. Sometimes. Has he always been like this? Only more so. A word? He is not someone for the long haul. - We're not a... - Just keep your distance, or you could find yourself a very lonely woman. One time he brought in these kittens and said we should dissect them. And this girl Lisa completely freaked and called the cops. But he was just teaching us to question authority. Did Mr. Hickson ever say anything about aliens? He said he saw something and asked us what it could have been. And flying saucer made it on the list? Right underneath the magic brownies? You didn't think that was funny, Andre? 'Cause that thing you did where you just looked down and away, that's regret. Ease up on the Jedi mind tricks, okay, everyone? You don't know me. Maybe you are the person who told people that Mr. Hickson saw aliens. I didn't say nothin' and I ain't on trial. What's with the shame? Did you see the same thing Hickson saw? I didn't see anything. Look. You can either sack up right now, or you can spend the rest of your life wondering if what you saw was real and if you could have saved Mr. Hickson's job. It was real. You like Mr. Hickson, so you photoshopped it. Look, he didn't forge it. That's exactly what I saw. Is the video real, yes or no? If this is what you saw, it must have been picked up on radar. And not, then there's gotta be an explanation. Like the air force don't be lyin'. We need to draw 'em out. We need get something we can read. How are you gonna do that? Film at 11:00. Martin should be home any minute now. It is so wonderful you're considering him for the... What do you call it? Lightman scholarship. It's our department's most prestigious award. Every winner has to have a biographical profile. Right? So... Should we start with early childhood? Martin was a very happy child, loved sports. Any head injuries? Trauma, like that? What we mean is, did he have to overcome any difficulties as a child? Not really. The people are here from the Lightman scholarship. No, mom. They're lying to you. I don't... What? He has a grudge, mom. He wants to destroy me. Look at this. They're saying I hurt a girl. This is outrageous. - I want you out of my house. - Don't you want to know if it's true? Mrs. Walker, a girl is missing. You can't believe Martin would ever hurt anyone. She's not so sure. Me? I'd bet your house on it. We should be moseying along, unless there's anything else you want to tell us. I've nothing to say to you. I'm so sorry, Martin. I really didn't know who they were. It's okay, mom. I know it's not your fault. It's okay, mom. They're going. You saw her when I said he was guilty. She crumbled. She was taken by surprise, Cal. Surprise, my ass. She's scared to death of him. She knows he's guilty, too. Maybe you are seeing what you want to see. You buying his act, are you? I think you and Helen have a lot of unresolved issues. I think you two were a couple when you were her student, and I don't think you like your replacement. You know, you're starting to sound a lot like Helen. I mean that in the nicest possible way. When I'm sure you're right about Martin, I will back you 100%. Here. Maybe this'll help convince you. It was just laying about. - He has a sister? - Apparently, yeah. There's no picture of her in the house, though, not that I could see anyway. What is this? That is video of little Martin and presumably an older sister. And where did you get it from? Borrowed it. Is that the background? Yes, and I didn't have to break any laws to get it. Here. Obviously, Martin had a sister. Her name is Marcy. She's 2 years older than him. - What happened to her? - She drowned in pool when she was 7. Police report says that Martin witnessed the whole thing. Excuse me. Reynolds. Well, Mrs. Walker lied about Martin's happy childhood. You seeing a pattern then? Cal, he was 5. 2 1/2 times the terrible 2s. What was the name of that hospital again? All right, my man. That was my buddy. I asked him to keep his ear to the ground about - any missing women. - There's another one? No, but a sophomore at Chesapeake University was attacked 2 days ago. Luckily, she was able to get away. He thought there might be a connection, so he decided to call me. Have the police shown her the poster? No. She had a mental breakdown and she isn't talking. What exactly is happening? Thank you. I don't want to be on camera. What are you... Damn it! I gotta go. Man. I am such a klutz. Geez. I left my opposable thumbs at home. Let me buy you another one. No, it's OK. No, really, it's not. Here. Another one of what I just spilled and a... raspberry tart. You OK with raspberry? Yes, sure. A lot of action, huh? No. Usually just dull stuff. Old ladies smuggling perfume. Maybe dull is good. Whatever you're doing now is stressing you out. Yeah, it's ironic. I'm usually the one to read people, but you're right. - I am stressed. - Then you need to relax. I'm going to a concert tomorrow night. Mostly Vivaldi. You want to come? It doesn't have to be like a date or anything. You could meet me there. No, yeah. I'd really like to go. Let me give you my number. Did I mention I know your boss? What? See, he thinks I'm some kind of psycho killer. I get women alone, attack them. What do you want? To make a point. And what point would that be? If Lightman was right about me, you'd already be dead. So, to be clear, the Lightman group is putting its hard-won reputation on the line for a UFO sighting? Now that we have a second eyewitness and physical evidence, we think that it's time that we got some answers from our government. Aren't you worried this could become a national security issue? If the Air Force is telling me the truth and they didn't pick up an object this size, then we've already got a huge problem. Mr. Hickson is telling the truth. When you know that, why not bet the ranch? I'm gonna show you a picture, OK? Is this the man who attacked you? Valerie? That's a yes. The police interviewed Martin. You want look at this case file? They probably would let him go with an apology. Yeah, you got that right. Dummies. I thought you was off chasing UFOs? Yeah, the office told me where you were. That's him. This guy. He... this guy, he just bought me a cup of coffee he was gonna take me to a concert, but I was... How did you realize that that was him? He said he knew Lightman. Said that if he was really the killer, I'd be dead. - Is that the girl he attacked? - Yeah. You OK? Yeah, she'll be fine. Now you're here, make yourself useful. Go in there and bond with Valerie over being alive. I understand, Valerie. What happened to you, it almost happened to me, too. Look at me, Valerie. This guy bumped into me at a pastry shop. By the time we got outside, he felt like a friend. And that's what he does. He appeals to who we are, like he sees us when nobody else does. Look, I know this is painful, but you're alive, Valerie. The next girl might not be. He... drowned me... over and over. All that.... water. I died... 3 times. Bastard waterboarded her. I'm so sorry. And... When I would come to, his mouth would be on mine. And then he would do it again and again. I begged him to just let me die... But he wouldn't. Maybe he did. Can you bring him in now? Hell, yeah. Valerie identified you as her attacker.</i> I'm sorry for her. I really am. But if the police believed her, wouldn't I be under arrest?</i> - <i>You stalked her.</i> - Did Cal coach the girl, get her to name Martin? I know how manipulative he can be. She was barely responsive. Well, if you see her file, she spent half her life on antidepressants. Here's how it happened. Valerie came on to me.</i> you should know that we're getting a warrant to search your car. If we find any evidence that she was in it... you will. I gave her a lift home one night from the library. Yeah, but see, the thing is, she never made it home. You tried to drown her 3 times. Then you dragged her into the woods and tried to bury her. That never happened. She's obviously troubled. Anyone can see that. That's why you picked her. She's troubled. She's vulnerable. You prey on the weak, right, Martin? All I was doing was showing the girl some kindness. No. She's the perfect victim. You like to traumatize her, you break her, she begs to die, and she's just your type. That's not true. I like strong women. Like Helen, you mean? She's a strong woman. Tell me, how does that work, with you two?</i> Do you play the woman in that whole scenario, do you? Who's the pitcher, who's the catcher? Are you just following orders? You do what she says, is that it? Right? I wouldn't worry, though. I'm sorry. Did you think what was going on between you two was real? Did you? Well, take it from me, it's not. I've been there. No, she's had dozens. - She gets bored, she moves on. - Like hell! I think we're done here, aren't we, Martin? If you say so. Martin's gone. You seen enough? He never admitted to anything. What, did you expect him to? Must be frightening, falling for a monster. Okay, so you know. I figured that's why you had a problem with him, the fact that he and I were... well... And now you know better. Well, you should. Right, come with me. - Where are we going? - Scene of the crime. He tortures... and kills young girls. Every girl he tortures or kills is on your conscience, Mrs. Walker. I only let you in here because Helen has been a friend to Martin. Nonsense. You feel guilty because you got a killer for a son. How come there's no pictures of your daughter anywhere? Did he kill her? Did he push her in the pool? You can't face the truth, can you? So you pretend she doesn't exist, she never existed. I mean, that's the game here. Right? Please. I put my trust in Martin, my faith. I do care about him. Now I need to know. That's one hell of a Rogue's gallery. World's greatest con men. - Yeah, more like psychos. - Yeah. To live with themselves, to deny their humanity, it's... quite a trick. You know, if you can pull off something like that, it's not really hard to fool the rest of us. Your friend Loker told me. Yeah. I should have seen it. Ah, kiddo. You probably got him right. Me too, for that matter. - What do you mean? - Well, I am a crackpot. It's not all I am, but it's the truth from time to time. And in a small enough moment, even a cold-blooded killer can be sincere, seem charming even. Now, how he got that way, I don't think that a mystery anybody can solve. It must be hard being somewhere 30 years and trying to make sense of all this. What's hard is they confuse growing old with growing stale. Mr. Hickson. I'm Colonel Gorman. You were looking for answers. I've got some for you. Is there some place we can talk privately without big brother? Ever heard the term "shattered bone"? It's Air Force code for a B-1 bomber that's hijacked or missing with a nuke on board. This is what your client witnessed 2 weeks ago. That's Captain Eric Eeubauer, decorated veteran. Cracked, and broke radio contact. We shot him down 500 miles off the Carolina coast. This was not a standard-issue aircraft but this does seem like a standard issue lie. It might not have looked like it on the ground, but there's a flash drive with cockpit video in the file. So what do you want us to do? To go along with some sort of coverup? I wouldn't call it that. What happened was a tragedy for the pilot's family and an embarrassment for our base. Are you nervous, Colonel? This is a sensitive case. I told my CO that given your relationship with the FBI we could trust you. I wish the feeling were reciprocal. The best lies are covered with half-truths. I have no doubt, that you had a pilot who cracked, who was shot down... Everything in that file happened as described. You have no idea what was in the sky that night, do you? That's the best answer you're going to get out of us, Mr. Loker. If your client's smart, he'll accept it. Smart? Or spineless. The Air Force is never going to admit to a violation of US air space, not by a Russian MIG or by a UFO, you and I know that. But we also know that what Mr. Hickson saw was not a B-1. So what there was a way for the Air Force to cover its ass and also save a teacher's job? Look, Martin, it's over. Let's not make a thing out of this. - Lightman's behind this, isn't he? - No. - He isn't. - I don't believe you. You've been different since that day in class. He may have started me thinking about us, what we're doing, but that's all. You said you loved me. Yes, and I know I shouldn't have. I'm sorry. - That wasn't fair. - That I was important to you. Your work is important to me. We can still be friends, work together. We still have that. Let go of me! Hello. Dezekis. Dean Warren? Yes, Dean Warren, one minute. Okay, Helen. Look, I understand. Big age difference. I'm sorry. Well done, luv. All the right notes. What now? With any luck, he'll come after you with a vengeance. Oh, God. Don't worry, Professor Dezekis. We have eyes on you.</i> - Cal? - <i>Helen.</i> You sound off. - Nice read. Very perceptive. - I can be from time to time. Can we talk later? Yeah, it's a date. I told you, Lightman. I'm always 5 moves ahead. Welcome back, Lightman. You ready to die... Again? You know if you kill me, right... They'll do you for murder. I mean, right now you could probably plea bargain it down to kidnapping or forced labor or something. You know what you need? A gun, but you don't have one. I've got you thinking, don't I? I mean, it's funny. Because a minute ago, you were in full control. Now look at you. You know, after I get done here, I'm gonna take care of Helen. And I'm gonna bury you side by side. Be romantic. There's a girl buried around here? - How many? - This is boring. Keep digging. Oh, sorry. I'm stalling. You do know I've got a GPS tracker on the van. Have some dignity, for God's sakes. Don't humiliate yourself. You do the bloody digging. Go on. You do it. That means you'll die really soon. The shrink's gonna have a field day with you. You know that? I mean, what is it with you animals? Did you push your sister in the pool? No. She fell. You didn't help her, did you? You just watched her drown. Yes. Why? I wanted her bike. Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop the gun! Drop it!</i> It's like you said. They only have me on unlawful detainment at worst. She's buried somewhere here. She's probably... - before the road. - There aren't any bodies. When they rolled up, you looked, towards the trees. That's where your secret is? - Sweep the area! - Right? You owe me 200 bucks! You bastard! In vino veritas? That's the only truth I'm gonna get apparently. I just perpetrated a lie on an entire school. I thought the F88 was a good compromise. It could have been what he saw. Yeah... but it wasn't. You saved a man's career. That's no small feat. What do you think that is? I don't think that's a mystery anyone can solve. So they dug up 4 bodies. I didn't see it, Cal. I mean, not at first anyway. - I could have saved you some grief. - That's okay. Take it out of your wages. You thought I was obsessing on Helen, right? It's not beyond the realm of possibility. You loved her, didn't you? We had our moments. It's not like she's Helen of Troy or anything. Fancy a quick bite? Thanks. I've got work. - Another time then. - Yeah. Another time.
