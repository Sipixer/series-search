- I'm Joan. - Hi. - Are you irish or... - No, I'm english. That's so neat. - What do you do? - I'm a furrier. Is that like, fur coats? Fur coats, wraps, stoles, hats, Mainly fur coats, though. How about you? I have to meet my friend. Well, maybe we can catch up later. Lose a bet? Basically. My friend over there dragged me along. If we were in a hotel room and you could order one thing from room service, would it be chocolate cake, strawberries or warm honey? I beg your pardon? I got to take this. - What's going on? - What's your ETA? I don't know. You can't hurry love. Can I get a lager? I hope that's your first drink. DC Police are looking for a guy named E. Matheson. He's been on the run for 2 days since his wife was found beaten to death. They want us interviewing friends and family to determine if anybody's helping him. And I've already gotten Loker and Torres in the field. - Chardonnay, please. - I don't care if he inspected it before he shipped it the painting's scratched, all right? - What? - Tell him... You tell France he's paying for the restoration. Otherwise, it comes back his way. Collector? Dealer. I'm a curator. - Really? - Really. I don't know. I guess the upside to having been through a marriage before is that I not only know what I'm looking for, but I know what I don't want. - I just want to be happy. - Yeah, I know what you mean. Like for me, right... This one thing is very important to me. It may seem old-fashioned to you, but that's fidelity. For some reason, I need to be up front about that. That's not old-fashioned. It's important to me, too. When I was married, I never cheated. I was tempted and certainly accused of it, But I never strayed... Never. So, what are your hobbies? What do you like to do on the weekends? I run a company that shrink-wraps poodles for international travel. I have to... go feed my meter. I'll be right back. Could you hold that thought? - I'll save your seat. - Thanks. In answer to your question from earlier... It's warm honey, right? You should call me sometime. The place is clear. You want us to stay? No, I'm good. Go ahead and check out the next name on the list. I'll be behind you. I'm Ria Torres. I'm with the Lightman Group. - The cop told me. - Any idea where your brother is? Running, apparently. It'll be easier for Eric if he turns himself in. I get that. His wife Connie was my best friend. I just can't believe she's dead. But... I don't know. Are we done? Why do I get the impression that you're hiding something to me? There's a lot I'm not telling you. Like how I can't sleep, how tell my kids that their uncle might have murdered his wife. Do you want me to go on? I don't know where Eric is. Do you know something that could help us with this case? I want you to leave. Now. You a cop? But they were here, right? They were here, weren't they? Yeah, yeah, they were here. Look, you don't need to hurt me. I can help you. I can help you. Drive. Drive! Don't look at me. Drive. - How did it go? - Put me out of my misery. Hi. Right. Your ex never cheated on you. There it is. You're sure? I spoke to her at one of those... Singles what? Singles mixers, and not a hint of shame or guilt when the subject came up. Her virtue is intact. So... Let me remind you, there's millions in alimony at stake. I'm well aware of the terms of your prenup. I'm telling you, conclusively, your wife never violated the fidelity clause, or however you put it. Maybe if I increase your fee, you can run another one of your tests. Let me just stop you right there. The truth's the truth. - Send me the bill. - I will. I definitely will. Boy, that was fun. What's next? Peeking through keyholes or what? You leveraged this company to buy your ex-wife out of this? Because she was gonna move Emily to Chicago. But now, we are cash poor, and taking cases like this helps us stay afloat. - I don't care. - What? I'll go back to working out of my home before I take another case like that. - I don't care. - The bills, the books, the payroll. Fine. It's all yours. Everything, it's all yours. You can take it. Will you calm down? What's the matter with you? I didn't kill my wife. And you are gonna prove it. - You think I'm playing around? - Absolutely not. Cops start showing up, I start killing people. Do you understand me? - We understand you completely. - You stick with me. She... She just makes the tea around here. Let her go. I'm the guy. See the sign? The Lightman Group. See that? The Lightman Group. Cal Lightman. That's me. I'm the guy. I'm the one you want. Just let her go. - I can help you. - No. I need to see the front door. I have surveillance cameras up here, up here, all down the corridors. You can watch them from my office who is on higher ground. Everybody in here! Everybody in this room! Come on! Move! I'm gonna do a head count in half an hour. If anybody leaves or calls the cops, he dies. No police. No police. I'm serious! No police. It's on you now, buddy. Understand. We're gonna stay calm. You know, get Cal out of this. I want you to go call Loker and Reynolds and get them down here, but don't tell them what's going on. Go. Just be careful. Do your thing. So front and back entrance in the lobby. - I said no phone calls. - No police calls. She's not stupid. You need to start being clear here. If I see any cops... You are familiar with what we do? She filled me in on the way over. You know that we're not law enforcement. You're... some scientist who knows how to tell who's telling the truth, right? That's right. I got a question for you. If you know who killed your wife and it wasn't you, why aren't you at the nearest police station banging on the door, demanding they take action? That's something a guy like you would do. I've had my run-ins with the cops, and they've never believed me yet. And when I walked in that door and I saw my Connie dead on the floor... You got a knack for telling who's lying? I got a knack for knowing when I'm screwed. And in that moment, I knew this would land on me. Fair enough. But no more shooting, threatening those people out there, Or you won't get my help, and we'll both lose. You more than me. I already lost everything I cared about. But you heard what I said, right? Do you believe me when I say I didn't kill my wife? And you believe I'll kill you if you try to run a game on me? Am I being clear now? Tell me. Who killed your wife? - Are you crazy? - Just until we know what's going on. This is a hostage situation! - Lightman's giving us eyes in the room. - How did he get in here with a gun? He has got the situation under control. Do you know what misprison means? It's failure to report a felony crime. I'm not gonna risk the lives of people out there and get fired in the process because Lightman thinks that he's got a handle on this! Could you come in here for a minute, please?</i> Sure. We've gotta figure out who killed this guy's wife. Matheson did. Innocent people do not run! If we don't do exactly what this guy says, he will kill Cal. Can you please just help us out, Ben? I'll hold off calling it in for a little while. But only under one condition. Come on, come on. How's everyone behaving? Perfectly. Good. That's the address of Tom McHenry. He runs an advertising firm. Eric's wife used to work for him as a bookkeeper. - Now, Eric's claiming that... - I know. I know. Now, Eric knows... that McHenry was making unwanted moves on his wife. And he considers him to be the only suspect in her death. So, I'll need you to track him down and, interview him... and tape it and bring it back to me. - What if he doesn't... - Just find a way. - Reynolds is here. - Who's he? He's a... Federal agent. He works with us. Same rules apply to him as everybody else. He's agreed to not call the police, but only if everyone in the conference room is allowed to leave. You bring him in here. I'll tell him what's allowed. - It's nonnegotiable. - You bring him in here! What do you want to do? Play king of the castle, or find out who is the killer? Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Everybody out. Let's go. Don't say anything. Don't call anybody. Don't do anything. Just go home and relax. We got the situation under control. Come on. What are you doing? Let's go. Follow everybody out. - You don't want me to call the cops? - I don't. - But I think we should call... - Listen. Don't do anything. Not yet. I want everything on Matheson. Monitor all the hallway surveillance. Anything happens, call me and Reynolds. What? No, I'm not going anywhere. I can't leave. It would help to have a badge to convince this guy to talk to me. I'll fake it. - Leave your tie. - What? Come on. Good. Badge, too? No, no badge. I screwed up. Tom McHenry. All right, you two, out. Come on. Get out. - You gonna tell me what this is about? - This is my colleague Gillian Foster. - We're here about Eric Matheson. - Did you find him yet? - We did. - Good. I hope he gets the death penalty. He's saying you killed Connie. Did you? I'm not even gonna dignify that with a comment. You're gonna need to, pal. You know what? This is further evidence that Eric is a first-grade psycho. Twice now, you've done what we call a false inference dodge, M. McHenry. You have yet to answer the question. This is why he's crazy. This is why I had to let Connie go. He was convinced I was trying to have an affair with her. He was convinced that I was filling her mind with what a loser he was, as if she needed further proof. Then you won't mind if we put you on tape. Why not? I thought you're innocent. OK, fine. Roll it. Who's that? That's my daughter. You mind if I call her? Yes, I do. Take a seat. You married? Not anymore. Which one you banging? Uptown chick or the salsa queen that drove me here? Neither, actually. Right. That's one thing I got over guys like you. My woman loved me. We had something real. Guys like you... Empty. You try and fill yourself up with nice suits and stupid art and show-off books and by nailing your employees in the copy room. You got a job? Not currently. - What that have to do with anything? - I'm sensing a little inner turmoil over the fact that your wife was the sole provider. No, we were rock solid. We didn't care who made the money. That's something you'd never understand. Don't... don't look at me like that. - Like what? - Like you're better than me. I told you that I would know if you were telling the truth, But I also know if you're hiding something from me. I'm not hiding anything. You're projecting a... little guilt. That's either from self-loathing or from something else. I'm just trying to figure out why that's making you do this. They got half an hour to get that tape here. Yes, sir. They haven't yet. Everyone from the Lightman group is out in the field right now Interviewing Matheson's friends and family. Yes, sir. That's really great, sir. OK. All right. Bye. I'm screwed. Good, Foster and Loker are back. You gotta stop this. You did nothing wrong. I should've locked the car. Why didn't I lock the car? You gotta quit beating yourself up about it. Stay focused. We need your help on this. - All right. - Hey. We just ran Matheson's sheet. Police responded 3 times to their apartment for domestic disturbance. The wife never filed charges. I'm telling you, this guy's the killer. He seemed believable when he said he's innocent. - <i>Seemed</i>? That's not good enough. - I'm taking this in to Lightman. Wait. Set it up in the lab. Tell him that's where he gotta watch it. - Why? - Because I can get a better visual. Again, I don't want to rattle this guy any more than we have to. Gillian, what's your priority? Running errands for this lunatic or making sure that Cal lives through the day? - Where is it? - It's just across the hall. Easy, all right. Take it easy. He's Reynolds, the guy I told you about. He works here. - Open it. - Just calm down. Stay back. Lock it. Lock the doors. Where are we watching this? If you let go of my neck, I'll show you, right? All right, and I... I want to see the front entrance and the back entrance and the lobby. Pull that up. There you go. Good. - <i>What's your name?</i> - There he is. - <i>I'm Tom McHenry.</i> - Smug son of a bitch! How did you know Connie Matheson? She worked for me. Did you ever socialize with her? Couple of times after work for drinks...</i> That's it. Strictly platonic. Is he lying yet? Could you shut up? - Cal just activated the audio. - My man. All he's gotta do is bluff, just tell him that this guy is lying, and he'll testify to it. That's all he's gotta do. Tell me why someone would accuse you of killing Connie Matheson.</i> No sane person would. Only her husband Eric would do that. I didn't kill Connie. He's lying, right? I see no typical signs of deception. Can't be sure, but... I don't think he killed your wife. He's putting one over on you! I'm good enough to know you didn't do it, all right? - Neither did he. - No way. No way! Why didn't he just bluff? This guy is too close to Lightman. If I can get some distance between 'em, I can end this thing with one shot. Go on! When's the last time you saw Connie? 3 weeks ago. She came into my office, asked for a loan to pay off a debt that was weighing on her.</i> That was the last straw. I told her she needed to find employment elsewhere.</i> He's lying. No, he's not. - What debt? - I don't know. I don't know! You break into my office... You terrorize my staff, you threaten to kill me. Congratulations, you got my attention. Now, tell me what the hell's going on. Sit down. Let me think. Who did your wife borrow the money from? No one. That's a lie. No one! I did. Chump change... 10 grand. - Who did you borrow it from? - A buddy... Who wouldn't do anything to Connie. How much have you paid back? That's the guy! And you're playing games with me? - How much have you paid back? - None. It's a fresh loan. There's plenty of time. I think I got you wrong. I think your wife... approached you. She confronted you with the debt. And the argument got out of hand, and then you killed her. You say that again. I dare you to say that again. - Answer the question, right? - No. I didn't kill my wife. I'm telling you, he's gonna blow. What's your buddy's name? I'm not gonna let you throw up the smoke screen, right? You don't know what you're doing. You got 3 options. You pull the trigger, You walk out and take your lumps with the cops, or you can tell me your buddy's name! All right?! Are you gonna tell me your friend's name? Danny Pavelka. All right. Danny Pavelka. - There he is. - OK, thanks. We're here to talk to you about the money you loaned E. Matheson. What's that got to do with him killing Connie? He didn't. Who did, then? This may come as a surprise to you, that's why we're standing ahead. You just wasted a trip. I just got back in town this morning from Atlantic City, and I got the motel bills to prove it. - How late was he on the loan? - First of all, I didn't loan him jack. - I facilitated a loan. - Who carried the note? That's my business. You want more? - Get a court order. - Danny, We just ran your sheet on the way over here. And it clearly states in your parole agreement that you have to check in with your P. O. once a week. You missed one 2 weeks ago. - He said he's gonna let that one slide. - Oh, really? See, I'm a little bit more of a stickler, so... You're gonna tell me everything I want to know, right now! Foster and Reynolds spoke with Pavelka. Connie found out about the debt. She went to Pavelka, told him that... Eric and she weren't gonna be able to pay the debt. I'm standing right here. She begged Pavelka to forgive the debt. He told her it wasn't up to him, so she has to talk to the guy who gave Pavelka the money for you... Eric. His name's Mike Zancanelli. Foster and Reynolds are on their way over to talk to him right now. You know who this is? I've never heard of him. Did he say how Connie found out about the loan? I don't know. He did tell Foster that he wasn't surprised she came, 'cause she was always having to clean up your messes, apparently. That will do, Torres. Why the guilt, Eric? That guy right there. It looks like him. The one in the black hat? There's no way he's gonna say squat in front of his boys. Then we'll have to take him back to the Lightman group to talk to him. What? How? Look... This isn't even about saving my job anymore. Most likely, that's gone. I've accepted that. But if go in there and drag this guy out in front of 15 people, This whole under-the-radar thing is done. Come on, Gillian, we gave it a shot. It's time to call this thing in. What? There's one thing Matheson said today that I believe is absolutely true. If he sees the cops... He will pull the trigger. He will! We're out of options, so... - All right. - What are you doing? - No, you're not going in there. - I'll be back in a couple of minutes. - Be ready. - Oh, God! I'm going to jail. What do you think? You don't wanna know what I think. Could I use your phone? Please? - Sure, there you go, darling. - Thank you. Damn it! Thank you. - Hi. - Hey. Do any of you guys know how to fix a flat? Did you know your wife reached out to Pavelka about the money? You didn't think you're in trouble not having paid it off? Your wife's death... and the money that you owed are in no way connected in your mind. That's right. Your wife was beaten to death. Your apartment was ransacked. Who do you know that's that angry and wants something of yours? That describes a lot of people I know, man. That's your guilt, isn't it? For contaminating her? You didn't want to drag her into your world. You considered her a pure soul, and you tried to keep it that way. And now she's dead. There's no way you can tell all that just by looking at my face. Just the guilt part. Where does the rest come from? That's how I feel sometimes about women I know. Did he mean that? You brought this on her somehow, Eric. That's one thing you're gonna have to live with, but murder charge isn't. All right? And what had you hoped to gain by coming in here? To be proven innocent? I'll testify to it. To find out who really killed her? I'm helping you. There's no further need for that gun. You just put it down, you just walk away. This never happened. I wish I knew if I could believe you. You can. You're gonna have to trust me. I will tell the police that you were innocent. Just put the gun down. Walk away. What the hell is this? What the hell is this! I told you no cops! I can't believe I trusted your lying ass. What are we gonna do? She's good. She'll take care of it. I thought you said she just makes the tea. May I help you? We got a call from one of your employees saying there might be a disturbance here Not here. He was very insistent. He said someone might be armed. I think I would know if someone had a weapon here at work. Why don't we take a look just to be safe. - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. So, what was the person's name? Who called this in? Raymond moncrief. I am so sorry, officer. We fired ray today, For misuse of company funds. He had to be escorted from the building. This is him looking for his payback. I guess it's just like him. Is that right? Excuse me. Just let go of me. I'll take care of... I'll do this. I'll do this. Can you open this? What's the problem? Moncrief's hassling us again Crank called the cops about someone with a weapon. You did tell him that's my problem? We were just taking a look around, sir. "Were." That's good. That's past tense. Perfect, 'cause I'm tryingto run a business here. - Sure. - Thanks, man. Thank you. Sorry for the interruption. - Have a nice day. - No problem. False alarm. It's just a matter of time till they come back. Then leave before they do. My colleagues are out there. They're talking to this zancanelli character. They'll get to the bottom of it. Just put the gun down and walk away. Right in here. Who's this? Who's this? Is that zancanelli? That can't be. So... Connie matheson. How do you know her? I loaned some money to a friend. That friend gave it to connie's husband. Tell me about that conversation, between you and connie. It was about the loan. Connie was under the impression that I gave the money directly to her husband, While charging him an exorbitant interest rate. And i didn't. That would be usury, which is illegal. And have you ever visited the apartment, that connie shared with her husband? Never been to eric's wife's apartment. He just changed nouns from connie to eric's wife. He answered no too quickly, and his voice was a different pitch. A little higher. Doesn't make sense killing Connie over 10 grand. Do we even need to know the real answer? Why can't we go in there with something we cook up? All we're trying to do is get him to put the gun down and walk out. - We still have time, ben. - To do what? There's no one else to talk to. The sister Matheson's sister. She said she was connie's best friend, and definitely hiding something earlier. Connie came to me a couple of weeks ago, and she wanted to borrow a digital recorder. I figured she could just go buy one, so, I assumed she wanted me to ask what she needed it for. She told me she had a fling with this guy, one-time thing, and he wanted more, so she was gonna tape their phone conversations. - To get him to back off. - That's what I figured. - This guy is married? - Yeah. She say anything after borrowed the recorder? She said it worked, but she was gonna keep the file just in case. Her only fear was that eric might find it. And when she was killed, I thought maybe he had. All right. Let me get this straight. Connie came to you about the loan You know, how she couldn't pay. You told her something could be... Worked out you know, a trade. Right? So, she had sex with you. But you wanted more. She recorded a phone conversation she had with you trying to get out of it, and then you went over to connie's apartment looking for that recording. It's like i told the black dude. I've never been to her place before. You turned the place upside down, and you found that digital recorder. You're in fantasyland, lady. You know that? She was gonna show it to your wife, And you lost your temper. No apartment, no recording, No dice. Is he lying? Damn straight. Connie tried to seduce this guy? - She'd never do that. - No, you're right. You're right. And she didn't. But he sexually blackmailed her To pay off your debts. We did everything that you asked. Let him go. Please. Lock it. Lock her out. I'm sorry about that. I mean it. Let's get the cops in now. I'll tell them you didn't do it. Zancanelli is who they brought in. We both know it. And I want 5 minutes alone with him. I can't let that happen. It's either him or you. I mean it. After all the - headaches you put connie through - Shut up! After all the headaches you put her through, After all the hard work she spent Trying to make you feel like a man, There is one way you can honor her. And I bet you'll tell me what it is! Live your life! Live your life. If you take your revenge out on this guy, You will be the fool that she spent her entire adult life Trying to convince other people that you were! I have no life without her. You ready? I want zancanelli! I know you're watching! I'll do it! He's gone from contempt to extreme anger. - He's working his way up to shoot. - We gotta give him what he wants. Just march zancanelli in there so this guy can shoot him. Welcome to the one thing that I won't do today. I've got an idea. Look. You're really gonna make this mistake? It's either him or you. Then, it should be me? Open the door. 5 minutes with zancanelli, that's it. Don't do this. You're just gonna talk to him? He's lying, you can tell he's lying. Give me your word. You're not gonna hurt him. You have my word. I swear. He's gonna kill him. He's gonna kill him. - I'll bring him in. - He's gonna kill him. She values your life more than you do. Join the club. Bring him in! And you... you get the hell outside! I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to make sure that this stays a conversation. I want your hands up. Hands up! And you you scared yet? Like connie was? I want to see that look in your eye. Get out of the way. Get away from him! Your wife wanted me to tell you something before she died. You got 5 seconds to tell me what she said. Tell me! I'll call this in. I'll do the talking. So, what do you do? All right. I'm gonna give you an honest answer. I'm already intrigued. I try to help people "try" being the operative word. I know that must sound foolish Or pretentious or both, But there it is. So, describe your ideal woman. I could describe her till the cows come home, But the real question is whether or not i'm her ideal man. You never know till you try. Why don't we give it a shot? With some room service... serve warm honey. I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry. Zancanelli confessed to connie's murder, so... I heard. I'm sorry I ran out like that. No, everybody's dealing with it, in their own way. I'm just... I'm just glad you're all right. How's your head? Fine. I was thinking about that whole, Accounts thing, that whole billing thing, We'd be working out of a shoe box if it wasn't for you. So... It's all yours. And I'll respect that. No, you're right. I mean, cheating spouse cases We're better than that. Whatever you decide. All right, then. I was just pop by really just to see how you were doing. Are you I'm OK. Good. Where's Emily? She's at her mum's. I haven't told them about all of this yet. Can I sleep in your spare bedroom tonight,
