joint, had some drinks, whatnot. It was nice. - This that polish girl? - No, she's Czech. Her family's Czech. She's nice. We connect, you know, emotionally. - And otherwise, too. - Otherwise. - I remember otherwise. - Yeah? How long you been divorced? - Six years? - Seven years. Best years of my life. It's a red backpack. That's him. police department! Hold it! Metro police! Open the door now! I'm going around back! - Hold it! - Hold it right there! Stop! Come here. - did you hear it? - Roof. Go. Come out! And put your hands where we can see them! Hold it! I'm gonna go check on him. You call it in. - Call it in, all right? - Yeah. Okay. Thanks for dinner, cal. Oh, uh, sure. - Thank you. - Thanks. Don't wait up. I'll be at work till midnight. See ya. - You got a work night? - Yeah. Deputy director's in Jakarta. Um, it's 9:30 in the morning there. All our clocks run on his time. Oh, that sucks. Still looking for your glasses? Yeah, I can't believe they weren't in the restaurant. I thought I brought them with me. - See you.Must be at home. - See U. Take care. Bye. Hey, Alec. Uh, waiter gave me those. Oh, thanks. Hello. This is, uh, Christine tackett. Uh, cal Lightman. I work with Alec's wife. You're state department? No, no, just a friend. Well, it's nice to meet you. - You, too. - Thanks. Might want to invest in a spare pair. those cops are criminals! They shot that boy in cold blood! They need to be charged! - Are we gonna let these police kill our young men? - No! - Are we gonna let these cops kill our young men? - No! No! No! No! No! No! No! I didn't realize we had a night shift. This is about the kid who got shot? Dr. Lightman. I'm Corey strong. I'm from the mayor's office. He's sorry that he couldn't come down here. Off the sidewalk. Hell with that! We ain't going nowhere! Let's move inside. No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Eric Kuransky. Adam Duke. They're detectives in the eighth district. - Decorated detectives. - Thank you, captain hoopes. Anyway, they were chasing a drug dealer up on the roof when they found this kid named Andre Ricks. Now Andre's in the hospital with two gunshot wounds and a broken back. Now, Duke and Kuransky say Andre was pointing a gun at them. Yeah, because he did. You were there? No, but I trust my men. That's nice. Andre's father says these two are lying, and that his son never even owned a gun. Right, and of course we should trust the kid's father. Maybe we should. Was a gun found at the scene? Yeah, in the alley a few feet from where Andre fell. And it wasn't planted there; it was the kid's gun. You got your head up your ass. Excuse me? You've got your head up your ass. Great. Mayor brings in a guy to investigate, and he's already on your side. No, he's got his head up his ass, too. 'Cause only three people know what happened on that roof: The ones who were there.So excuse us. We're gonna talk to someone useful. I've been on the job, uh, four years. Made detective a year ago march. Yeah? I never fired my gun at a person before. First time for everything. How you feeling? You look pretty calm. I guess it's not real yet. Eight years on a homicide squad in St. Louis. Four years in narcotics before that. This was a good shoot. You ask what you got to, but I'm telling you, there's nothing wrong here. Eric went out the door first. I was... sorry, no. That's not right. I went out first. Eric followed me. Did you identify yourselves? Absolutely, no question. When did you first see the gun? Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out. How far away from Ricks were you? Maybe ten feet. So how far? 14, 15 feet away. Sure about that, right? I know where I was. I'm sure you do. How far is it from your bathroom to your bedroom? 20 feet. Hear that pause? He had to think to measure a distance that he walks every day. Yet, when I asked him about how far he was from Andre Ricks, no pause. He prepared his answer. Look at this. - Did you plant the gun on Andre Ricks? - Excuse me? Did I plant the gun? No. No, I did not. Look, he said he didn't do it. What's the problem? Soft voice. It drops away when you lack confidence in what you're saying. He's lying. These cops are not lying. Oh, you're half right. I don't understand. You just said they were. I said this cop's lying. This one isn't. As far as we could tell, Adam Duke didn't lie once. But they're telling the same story. So how can one be lying and one be telling the truth? I can't tell you that yet, but what I can tell you is whatever happened up on that roof is not what you guys think. Get those interviews uploaded. Fine. Night. stay with him. What time is it? Mm, a little past 3:00. I'm sorry I had to take off earlier. Lightman doesn't believe in office hours. It's okay. Hope you don't mind I stayed. No. Glad you did. I need a shower. You know, I could, uh, make sure you don't slip or fall in there. Yeah, somebody called. They, uh, left a message. I didn't pick up. Can you play the machine? Uh, hey, it's me. - Loker? - Couldn't sleep. I thought you might be awake. okay, sorry. - What's that about? - See you at work. He's a little freaked out. He did something bad at work. And then he lied to our boss about it. - And now I am his therapist. - Wait. So he did something that could get him fired and told you all about it? He was scared. He made you a part of his mess? He just needed to talk to somebody. I mean, isn't that what friends do? Confide in each other? You know what a real friend does when he's got a secret? He keeps his mouth shut. So do you have secrets you're not telling me? Lots. Because I... am a very good friend. I was really hoping there would be some clarity by this morning we're still trying to figure out what these men are telling us. Kuransky looks like he's lying. But he's also highly emotional. I've seen fear, anxiety, some paranoia. Which means...? He could be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. You want to tell me how? Because he didn't fire his gun. It can be brought on by repeated exposure to violent events. If he's been a cop for over ten years, I mean, he's seen a lot. Okay, so if he's got PTSD, does that mean he's not lying? Nope. We need to establish a baseline. I want to see what these guys look like when they're not stressed. I want to see their service records, and I want video of them interviewing suspects. I don't have time for a psychological study. What I needed was an answer. Thanks for your help. I heard there was another anti-police demonstration in the eighth ward. - How many arrested? - Eighteen. - How many ended up in hospital? - Four. All right. You give us what we want, we'll get you the truth. It's the only way to stop more people getting hurt, right? Fine. Look, there's a simple answer. Duke is telling the truth. Kid pulled a gun on him. Kuransky's lying to back up his partner. No. That doesn't explain why Kuransky is so agitated. There's something else going on with him. Hey, it's time for that staff meeting. - That's yours. - No, actually, it's yours. Wait. Since when do we have staff meetings? Uh, let's not spend too much time on this. We're being sued. Some of you worked on the Joseph Hollin case. He was the banker whose daughter ran a ponzi scheme with his investors' money. They're suing everybody that was involved in the failed attempt to recover his assets, and that includes us. So, our lawyer is going to want to talk to you individually. The damages could run into hundreds of millions, which I don't happen to have, so do your best to answer the questions as truthfully as possible. All right? Come here. Come here. You know how to lie to the lawyer, right? What do you mean? Don't answer too quickly. Short response time, that's a dead giveaway. And, uh, remember something that you got wrong. Correct yourself. Don't look him in the eye too much. Include irrelevant details. And if you feel nervous, take a couple of these. Muscle relaxants? Lawyer should be pretty easy to beat, but u never know if Lightman's going to look at the tape. I-I-I cannot believe you are asking me to cover for you, loker. You're the one who blew the Hollin case. You lied about it. You're the reason we're being sued. It's not just about me. If what I did gets out, Lightman is in serious trouble. The investors will bankrupt him, and they'll turn this place into a day spa. So I shouldn't lie to save your ass. I should lie to save the company. Sarcasm aside, yes. You haven't been lying long enough for you to be any good at it. Mr. Ricks. What was Andre doing on the roof? He goes up there to smoke cigarettes. I don't allow it in the house, so he goes outside. Sometimes he ends up on that roof. He likes it up there because you can see the river. You're his brother, right? Antwon. How you doing, Antwon? - Something you want to tell us? - No. Well, the idea that Andre just pointed a gun at somebody, it's ridiculous. I mean, that boy never held a gun in his life. I think Antwon would disagree with you there. Wouldn't you, eh? What are you talking about? You got something you're trying not to tell us? If you know something, say it. He had a gun. He was getting jumped by the conlin terrace crew. He got scared. So he got a gun to protect himself. Just because Andre had a gun doesn't mean he pointed it at Kuransky and Duke. Yeah, well, we can't dismiss the possibility. We need to talk to Andre. Well, is there any chance of that happening soon? No. He's unconscious. Uh, how's it going with the detectives? I've been looking over months of suspect interviews. Kuransky is lying everywhere. Places he's been, cases he's worked. Also, his anxiety when he talked about the shooting... that wasn't from PTSD. Okay. There's definitely something going on with this guy. I just don't know what it is. All right, well, keep digging. I'll be back as soon as possible, all right? Dr. Lightman. Special agent Owen finnegan with the FBI. We need to talk. Please get in the car. - Why? - I'll explain shortly. Please get in the car. Am I under arrest? No, but I am authorized to compel you should you not choose to accompany us voluntarily. Please get in the car, sir. Dr. Lightman, you were given access to top secret material when you were consulting with CIA. So I'm going to trust you with some information that you shouldn't have. Sit down. You know special agent Kuransky? Ah, you see, I knew there was something wrong with you. Kuransky is one of several special agents undercover in the metro police department. Why? We believe a small group of terrorists have infiltrated law enforcement in dc. There's a network of sleepers, individuals linked to al qaeda inside the police force, who are helping to plan a strike. Adam Duke is a member of this network. His real name is adamat duka. He's Albanian by birth. And as you may know, al qaeda is believed to funnel money through groups in Macedonia and Albania. He says he changed his name to break with his family, but that's not true. He's still in contact with relatives back home. We estimate three to five sleepers like Duke are inside the police force. That's why he hasn't been arrested yet. We want Duke to identify the others. I've been partnered with Duke for 16 months. I am inside his head. I will get those names. - What's your source? - We can't tell you that. - What's the target? - We can't tell you that. But we do believe it will happen soon, very soon if we don't intervene. That's why you got to back off the Ricks case. Everyone in the department knows you're looking at me and Duke. If the other sleepers think you're on to who Duke really is, they will kill him. Then we have nothing. If Andre Ricks recovers--if-- he could go to jail for a crime he may not have committed. And you're telling me to back off because of a terror threat that you won't even describe. - It's a bit of a joke, really. - No, it's not. This is real. These people want to inflict major casualties on this city. And if that happens because you got in the way, that's gonna be on your head. Right, I've got a question for you. Did Andre Ricks have a gun in his hand when Adam Duke shot him? I told you that already. Ye that shoot was good. You see, there's the problem. You're still lying. I'll see myself out. You know, the fact that Kuransky is undercover could explain why he appears to be lying about the shooting. How? Well, sometimes undercover cops can develop symptoms of dissociation. I mean, pretending to be somebody else can make them anxious and paranoid. And it could look like they're lying even if they're telling the truth. Yeah, maybe he's just a bad liar. I think we should keep digging. I don't think we should be pushing it on this one. - What, are you FBI now? - No.If they're trying to stop a terrorist cell, then, yeah, I want to be careful about getting in the way. "National security" is just their favorite bogeyman. This whole sleeper cell thing smells fake to me. Not every threat is a lie. You know, a plane flew into the pentagon. My husband was there. I remember that day, cal. And I would do almost anything to prevent that from happening again. Well, I'll tell that to Andre Ricks. I'm sure he'll feel the same way. - That is not fair. - Not fair to him. You can't take the government at their word. Unless they're right. And if an attack is really being planned, then everybody's at risk. it's Torres. A gas station in anacostia got robbed last year. This image was released by metro police from the security camera. Recognize the face? Andre robbed a store? Yeah, I guess he had a gun and knew how to use it. - Get that cleaned up. - Yeah. Hey, a paralegal's looking for you. - I think the lawyer wants to talk to you. - Now? Yeah, I guess so. I will just be a minute. Oh, I'm wexler, by the way. Martin wexler. Do you need to swear me in before we start? No, no. - This, uh, this isn't a formal deposition. - Okay. Uh, will there be one later? Not necessarily. Depends on what you say. Do you have a problem with that? No, no. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. Listen... ria. I'm just here for the facts. You give me the truth, we're good. If you don't, we're not. It's really that simple. Do you understand? There's no problem. You cleaning this up? Yeah, already doing it. All right, then blow it up. And again. - That's the kid the cops shot. - Yep. Yes, it is. It's an interesting case. Let me know if there's anything else I can do. You can talk less. What do you see? nothing. Exactly. No contempt, no fear, not even pleasure. That's a face at rest. Doesn't look like the face of someone robbing a store, is it? Cops photoshopped Andre's face on someone else's body? They're framing him? Nah, it's not the cops this time. That's done with some very good equipment. That looks like the FBI to me. Cal! Good god. Could your posture get any worse? You're a walking question mark. How's tRicks at the CIA? Less amusing since you stopped coming by. I miss your special gift for pissing people off. So... what's so important we had to meet right away? The FBI said there's terrorists inside the dc police department. Is that true? Why would you want to ask about that? 'Cause I think they're trying to frame a kid to shut down an investigation. Is this the kid that got shot by the two cops? Yeah. Who's trying to frame him? Special agent by the name of finnegan. Falsified some evidence. I know finnegan. He's the straightest arrow in the quiver. If somebody's doctoring evidence, it isn't him. What do you know about these sleepers? Cal, you need to steer clear of this one. You know better than to tell me that. Why you so scared, Fletcher? I read the intel. Threat is real. This isn't hussein and his disappearing weapons of mass destruction. This is a network financed by people who want to hit us hard. Half of Langley's stocking up on duct tape and plastic sheeting. What's the target? Theory is they're going after government buildings. State department, supreme court, who knows? Maybe the CIA. So the FBI is telling the truth? Sleepers inside the police department? I don't know. But what I do know is you should stay out of it. Whatever's gonna happen to this kid is nothing compared to what could happen to this city. People could get hurt, cal. A lot of people. Just to be clear, you didn't like the fact that your boss was making a deal with Joseph Hollin. Well, I thought it was the wrong thing to do. But that's not my call to make. That's Dr. Foster'S. Right, right. And when exactly did you find out that the deal had been blown up? Tuesday M... uh, no, sorry. Wednesday morning. I saw it online just before I came to work. That was the first you heard of it? - That's right. - Yeah. Okay. Did you blow up the deal? No. Did you go to the sec against Dr. Foster's wishes? No, I didn't. You're a logical person. You already admitted you didn't want it to happen. Yeah, and the reason that you know that is because I just told you. Pretty stupid of me to do that if I blew it up, isn't it? Okay. Good. That's all I need. - That's it? - Yes. Thank you very much for your time. All right, thank you. - The income projections you asked for. - Oh, yeah. And you got a call from Corey strong in the mayor's office. Said he couldn't reach you on your cell. That happens all the time. - Stay in touch. - I will. Thanks. Who's that? Just an acquaintance. - Oh, yeah. - Where have you been? talking to a friend about a terrorist threat. He says it's real. Oh, this could get complicated. I just got a call from the hospital. Andre Ricks is conscious, and he's willing to talk. All right. still can't feel anything below my waist. Doctors keep telling me to wiggle my toes. Any luck? - Not yet. - Okay. Look, I've got to ask you a couple of questions, all right, Andre? - Yeah. - Okay. You owned a gun, right? - Yeah. - Where is it? I threw it away. It was stupid to get it. When you went up on the roof, did you have a gun on you? No. Told you, it's gone. All I had up there was my phone and my cigarettes. Do you remember what happened when you were shot? Not really. I remember people shouting from far away. Then I woke up here. Did you see the lip pout when I asked if he had a gun on the roof? He seemed genuinely hurt by the idea. Now, you wouldn't see that if he was lying, right? He could've denied owning the gun altogether. He didn't. Nah, he's telling the truth. I don't think he was armed when Duke shot him. We need to call the mayor. This kid could do 10, 20 years. Yeah, but if we do say something, what happens to the FBI investigation? That's not our concern. You want me to lie to the mayor? Yeah, but we ha veto consider it, cal. Van pulls up in front of a building, and there's an explosion. I mean, your contact said the threat is real. Look, there's always gonna be another bad guy. There's always gonna be another kid they're gonna want to sacrifice. Ricks was unarmed. He's the victim here. Call the mayor. Hey, uh, loker. You know where ria is? She might be downstairs getting a latte. Well, I got tickets to the wizards game, but I got to go to work. - Can you give them to her? - Yeah, sure. - She deserves something nice. - What you mean? Oh, nothing. Just, she's good people. Solid. She did it, didn't she? She covered for you with that lawyer. Um, I have no idea what you're talking about. I told her not to cover for your ass. But I guess she didn't listen. That's a bit harsh. Can I talk to you for a second? You don't get it, do you? If this thing gets out, you are both gonna get fired. Now, you're Mr. Ivy league, and you're gonna be okay, but ria, she's going back to the airport. She's gonna be scanning luggage and taking it from passengers with bad attitude all day long. She has so much more to lose than you that it's not even funny. But doesn't matter to you, right? 'Cause you think she's good people. So Eric went out the door first. I was... sorry, no. That's not right. I went out first. Eric followed me. Turn on the TV. Hey, I don't see any signs of deception in Duke. If he's a spy, I mean, how's he hiding it? Turn on the TV. What we are saying is this is a cover-up, pure and simple. Why won't the authorities let Kuransky and Duke face their accusers? No, that's not right. No, I spoke to the mayor. Why isn't Duke in custody? The FBI's holding him. They won't turn him over to the dc police. National security. Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out. And how far away from Ricks were maybe ten feet. What? They're not gonna get anything out of Duke. Why? You said Kuransky was suffering from dissociation because of being undercover, right? Yeah, yeah. Being undercover is hard to take. Right. Was it a problem for Duke? No, not at all. Well, if he's a terrorist, he's been undercover longer than Kuransky. So his symptoms should be worse. Maybe they got it wrong. You know, maybe he's not a terrorist. I mean, that would explain why he didn't show any signs of deception. He wouldn't have been lying. I've looked at over a dozen interrogations, and there's no sign of deception in Duke. Here it is. This is the oneI've been looking for. It's Duke questioning a neo-nazi. I say this country is a whore bitch-- de-christianized, mongrelized, obamanized. The streets are sewers filled with human trash. The cities reek with moral decay... look at Duke. See that contempt smile? He's offended. Yeah, if he were a terrorist obsessed with attacking America, he wouldn't hate this guy. He'd agree with him. Maybe he's not a sleeper. The FBI's have been investigating Duke for over a year. How could they get it so wrong? Haven't you done enough? You already destroyed an undercover operation we spent years putting in place. It put the wrong man in custody. Why? Because Duke doesn't have a personality disorder? Because he looked irritated when some skinhead yelled at him? Give me a break. You've been interrogating Duke. What have you gotten? You've been on him for hours. You got nothing, right? You're starting to worry, starting to think you might have screwed up. Can see it in your face. You can't afford to make a mistake here. Damn it. How did we get it wrong about Duke? Well, you may have had some help. A photoshopped picture of Andre Ricks was given to the police. I don't know anything about that. I believe you. Then you got a bigger problem here than Duke. One of your people has gone rogue. Sorry about the wait. What am I doing here? Finnegan just said, "show up. "What is this? - Yeah, I wanted to talk. - About what? Sit down. About spies. See, there's two kinds of spies, right? There's the spies that gather good information, and then there's the spies that spread bad information. Yeah. I think you're one of the latter. What are you saying? Well, you said that Adam Duke was a terrorist. In fact, the whole case against him is based on what you've said. - He is a terrorist. - No, he's not. Which means that you are either incredibly stupid, or you're giving bad information to the FBI's. You accusing me of working for the other side? You saying I'm al qaeda? I got a picture of Osama in my wallet? - I didn't say it. - What the hell are you saying, then? See, that's good. You're pretty good. I mean, I'm not seeing any fear. I'm only seeing anger. I mean, that photograph, though, that you sent to the police of Andre... that was crude. That showed desperation. If you think I've been bought off, you check my bank account. I got nothing. That's true. But you did have something. Didn't you? You used to have something. You had... a daughter. Specialist Jacqueline Kuransky. To hell with this. I'm not doing this. Hey, not until your boss tells you to. Sit down. "On October 14, 2005,specialist Jacqueline Kuransky was killed by enemy fire while on patrol in Tikrit..." well, that's not true. Is it? She was killed by friendly fire. We have the file. But not that they'd admit it. I mean... what's their line? "Under investigation"? Now you're getting angrier. That's good. I can understand that. I mean, if somebody did this to my kid, I'd want to tear their head off. - She deserves the truth. - Yes, she does. She died wearing their uniform. - She deserves the truth. - Yes, she does. You want to get back at people you think killed your daughter. I understand that. That is basic. They lied. They lied about everything. They lied about how long she would be there. What she would do, what kind of armor her truck would have... they even lied about how she died. All they did was tell lies. Well... I can lie, too. There you go. Kuransky gave us four more sleepers. - Were they police? - No. - They were EMTs. Paramedics. - Why them? It was planned as a double attack: An initial explosion produce casualties; then the ambulances would arrive, driven by sleepers, and stuffed with more explosives we would have waved those ambulances right in without thinking twice. Because Kuransky had us convinced that the terrorists were police. He told the FBI that I was a terrorist? What does this have to do with the shooting? Well, Kuransky's story depended on you being on the police force. And when you shot Andre Ricks, he knew you could get arrested, so he had to make the shooting looked justified. That shoot was good. No, it wasn't. When Kuransky got to the street, he saw Andre wasn't armed. So he put a gun on him. He had a gun on the roof. I was there. I saw it. No, what you saw was this. His cell phone. You saw a gun because you believed he had on but it wasn't there. Put your hands where we can see them. Hold it! Listen to me, detective. Before you say anything, you talk to a lawyer. How is the kid? Doctors say there's no lasting damage to his spinal cord, so he should recover. Tell him, uh... tell him I'm sorry. My office. Before you say anything, it was me. I-I blew up the deal. I went to the FCC. I lied to foster about it. I still think it was the right thing to do. But no one else was involved. It was just me. - I knew that. - You did? Yeah. Yeah, I've known that all along. Why didn't you say anything? 'Cause I decided to run a test. What kind of test? The lawsuit. That was a test? You lied to everyone in the office so you could treat me like a lab rat? No. No, I was testing Torres. Why? 'Cause I could tell she knew what you'd done. I mean, there's no surprise there, but, you know, we have a lot of secrets here. So, I wanted to see if she could keep one under pressure. Are you going to fire her for not turning me in? No, I'd have fired her if she had. Loyalty's crucial here. But, you, on the other hand... what you did is inexcusable. And involving her is selfish, disrespectful, and it's plain stupid. I'll empty my office. No, you can stay. You can stay, but from now, you'll be paid what you're worth, which is nothing. You're an unpaid intern. It's that or you can leave. - So, what's he going to do? - I don't know. Didn't hang around to find out. - Loker isn't the only one who lied. - Oh, yeah? That woman who came in yesterday? That's Alec's sponsor. He had a problem with cocaine before we were married. But he's been in recovery since, yeah... a couple of months ago, he started using again. And he's just trying to stay clean. How's he doing? Some days are good, some... not so good. Well, if there's anythingI can do... you didn't just happen to find Alec's glasses the other night, did you? You thought he was having an affair. I was afraid you were going to get hurt. You were protecting me? Something like that, yeah. You know... the line we talked about? You know, the line we have to draw because we see things people are hiding? Things they don't want us to know? I think we should respect the line. I think it's best for both of us. Good night, cal.
