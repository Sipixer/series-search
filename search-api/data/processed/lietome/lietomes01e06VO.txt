Suspicions continue to swirl around samantha's parents, brian and lorraine burch, amid accusations that they killed their daughter and claimed she was abducted. Just yesterday the burches raised the reward for information about their daughter's where abouts to $100,000. And there are also reports they've hired so-called deception expertdr. Cal lightman. Girl goes missing,supermodel's in rehab, obama gets anew puppy, and you guys make freedom ofthe press the first amendment. I don't think this is what ourfounding fathers had in mind. Watch this, daddy. - you adopted her five years ago? - Yeah. We waited so long for a child. She made us a family. Do either of you have children? Yeah, I do. How anybody thinks that... we could hurt her,I, I don't understand. You said there wasnew information? A car ran a red light two days ago. The police gave usthat photograph. It's from one ofthose traffic cameras. Do you see there? That is samantha's sweater. Uh, lorraine made that. Someone has her. That's why we raised the reward. We re-mortgaged the house. We've been gettinghundreds of calls from all over saying they've gotinformation about sammy, but the police saythat's going to take weeks to talk to everybodyand... she may not havethat kind of time. So we thoughtthat you could tell which of the tipsterswe should believe. I mean, you could do that faster thanthe police, right? I need to ask you a question. Did you kill your daughter? - Did you? Did you kill her? - How can you evenask us that? - Yeah, I know, you brought me here to help you. - Are you serious? So answer the question. Did you kill your daughter? - I'm not gonna answer that. - No, listen. - Did you kill samantha? - We didn't bring you hereso that... did you killyour daughter? Did you kill her? No. No, no, no. No. No, no. All right,I think we can help you. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Lie to Me Season01 Episode06 Do No Harm</font> You gonna be okay? Sure. 'Cause I can do this one on my own. No, not a chance. I know what you're thinking, and it's not going to be a problem; I'm fine. Dr. Lightman, can we ask you a question? Anything from the burches? Um, off the record? Yeah, off the record. Put the camera down. It's my understanding that, uh, samantha burch was seen with an unidentified male leaving a restaurant called the happy dragon. Right now the police are searching chinatown. All right, thank you. Let's go. Well, the burches could use some privacy, and the happy dragon could definitely use the business. Diane kretschmer, editor- in-chief at ashmont press. Dr. Foster explained what this was about? It's about her, right? Farida mugisha. That's right. What do you know about her? Well, she's a, uh, peace activist from northern uganda. She was kidnapped by rebels when she was in her teens, kept in the bush, and escaped. I read her book. It's awesome. - You published it, right? - Yeah, and it's about to be huge. This is just the kickoff party for the tour. Oprah's chosen her for the book club. But there's a problem? Last week we got a report that farida took part in massacres carried out by the rebels that held her. Took part how? Carried a gun, pulled the trigger. Her memoir doesn't mention that. If the reports are accurate, it's a disaster. It means the whole book's a lie. We're about to ship half a million copies. Now, is there any way that you can find out if there's any truth to these accusations? We'll have to talk to her about what happened and see how she reacts. And you'll be discreet? Farida absolutely cannot know that you're investigating her. That won't be a problem. Gillian foster. Don hughes, youth investigation division at metro. Detective. Mr. Hughes is here to welcome us to the burch case. "Welcome" isn't the word I'd use. Well, we won't get in your way, detective. Too late. You work for the burches, right? As far as I'm concerned,they're still suspects. At puts youright in my way. - Well, they didn't killtheir daughter. - Really? Any other tips? We wantto find samantha as much as you do. When a kid's beenabducted this long, odds are she's dead. You going to help me findthis girl's corpse? How do you knowshe was abducted? And what aboutthe traffic cam photo? Lorraine burch knit that sweaterfor santha off of a pattern that soldup and down the east coast. Could have been anyone. Maybe she just ran away. There's noevidence of abuse or neglect in the home,no alcoholism or drug use. Those are the usual predictorsof a runaway, but samantha was adopted. It's possible she hadattachment issues-- difficulty forming arelationship with the burches. That could have made herrun away. Uh, excuse me,the tipsters are here. you want to stickaround for this? This is going to take you forever to listento all these people. Fortunately, I don't have to. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me, excuse me. Uh, thanks for coming,ladies and gentlemen. Now, I know you've been told that the burch familyhave put forward a $100,000 reward. Okay, that rewardhas now been withdrawn. what the hellis he doing? It took us monthsto raise that money. They're all leaving. Some are leaving. Dr. Lightmanjust eliminated the financial incentiveto lie. Now, the police have arrestededward stentz in connection with samantha burch'sdisappearance. Anyone who can give me anyinformation on edward stentz, could you please raiseyour hands? You can all leave. Who's edward stentz? He doesn't exist. The people who saidthey knew something about him are overclaimers... lying to getattention. The rest of you, if you could just follow me... I didn't know sam that well. We were in guys and dolls, but... she was the lead, I was justin the chorus, so... it's okay. Deirdre, you'renot in any trouble. Okay, well,there was this older boy-- walter grinwis. Heas always hanging around. He wouldn'tleave her alone. How old is walter? An eighth-grader, maybe. When she told me about thiswalter, I called the tip line. We called the police when we heardabout samantha. The officer askedwalter some questions, he thanked us for the call,that was it. It's awful. Seems justlike yesterday walter was taking the buswith her. You do that a lot,do you, walter? Take the busith sam? I guess. You were friends? Don't have manyfriends, do you, eh? I don't care. People are stupid. Not sam, though, eh? Where's that picturewe have of you with samantha? Is it in your bedroom? something's in yourbedroom, isn't it, walter? Let's go andhave a look. Hold on. What do think you're doing? Are you afraid your son is hiding something? No, of course not. Hey, walter. You kn how toplay hot or cold yeah? Okay, am I hot? This is dumb. So I'm cold, right? Okay. How about now? Nope, still cold. Am I getting warmer, walter? Yeah. Yeah, I am. That's enough. You need a warrant before youcan look through his things. No, I don'T. I'm not withthe police. I want you out ofmy house right now. Nice backpack, walter. Where is she? I don't care how you found this. It's got to be bagged,taken to the lab, and analyzed. Can we just have aquick look in it? Yeah, let's contaminatethe evidence. That'll help. Detective, we need to see walter'srelationship with the bag. If he killedsamantha, it's a trophy. Its contentswill provoke arousal. If this kid hadanything to do with samantha's disappearance,we can tell you right here, right now. - That's interesting. - What? He's not showing anynegative emotion. In fact, I think he's as surprised at thecontents of the backpack as we are. You've never looked in there,have you, walter, eh? Why is that? It's not mine. You were respectingsamantha's privacy. Walter, did shebring this to you? Ask you to keep it incase she needed it? We're not mad at samantha. We just need to find her. I said I'd keep it. She askeme not to tell anyone. She trusted me. That's a runaway kit. Kids put them togethersometimes when they're thinking about leaving home. When d shegive it to you? A couple of monthsbefore she went missing. I think she wanted to getaway from her mom and dad. - Why? - I don't know. She didn't talktoo much about it. Bet she talked to her shrink. "Christina knowlton." Samantha saw meevery other week. She had issues stemmingfrom her adoption. I told the policeeverything I could. What was the sourceof the issues? The dynamics werepretty complicated. Well, she may have run away. Did she talkwith you about that? Not directly, no. Indirectly? I'm sorry, but I couldn't say. Samantha'sin danger. Her parents are desperate. There must be somethingthat you can tell us. I have a colleague who was treating a womanin an abusive marriage. My colleague reportedit to the police, they arrested the husband, he got out on bail, d went home and shothis wife in the head. I'm sure youcan appreciate how I have to be careful what informationleaves my office. You saying samantha was abused? I didn't say that. Yeah, you did. Um, club soda. Cranberryspritzer, please. You'd get your ass kicked ifyou ordered that where I'm from. I got my ass kickedwhere I'm from. there she is. - Farida mugisha,woman of the hour. - Hello. Eli loker. I loved your book. - You have an incredible story. - Thank you. I mean, everything you've done... changing the world through peaceful resistance. I mean, you're like gandhi. Except you don't look likea malnourished old man. you're too kind. You never turned to violence. I guess a lot ofthe victims did? We have to forgive them. Many had no choice. I was lucky. Lucky how? I was never forced toparticipate in the massacres. That's really lucky, isn't it? I'm thankful every day. I don't think I'd havethe strength to live with something like that. Well, I should getback to our hosts, but I'm speaking atseaver hall this evening. I hope you'll come. Oh, I look forward to it. Bring yourook. I'll sign if you'd like. I would like. No shame when she talkedabout the violence. It's hard to believeshe killed anybody. - Did you see anything? - No. We should go hear her speak. Yeah, she wantedto sign my book. - I think we had a connection. - Oh, yeah. 'Cause ugandan womencan't resist a guy with a girly drink. Samantha did not run away. Whatever you mayhave been told. It's something we haveto consider, mrs. Burch. sorry, sorry. Oh, I gotta take this. Yeah, um, it's my daughter. Just a sec. Hello? Absolutely not. 'Cause I said so. No, I said absolutely not. We.. don'tbe such a bitch! Shut up! Stop it! How'd we do? - Sympathy, then horror. - Oh, good. Yeah, thanks, love. No, it was finE. It was good, very good. Well, dependswhen I finish. All right, yeah, I love you. I love you, too. Yeah. Okay, bye. So, what the hell was that? Well, I'm not anabusive parent. And it doesn't looklike you are either. You think this is some kind of game? - You think we abused our daughter? - Brian. I'm sorry, mr. Burch, butwe had trule it out. This is how you peopletreat your clients? I mean, this is a good family. This is a happy family! Samantha and I are very close. You know what, I thinkyou're telling the truth. I do. But you, on the other hand, there's somethingyou're not saying. No, she's saying everything. It's all right, mrs. Burch. You n tell us. You never saw what she was like when she was alonewith me, brian. A few weeks beforesamantha disappeared she threw one of her tantrums. And I tried to hold her. I tried, but she was so strong. And she... she pushed me away. I don't know... I don't know how this happened. Go on. She fell into the stove and her shirt touchedone of the burners. And it caught on fire and it burned her back. It was an accident. Samantha felt guiltyabout it and I was... I was so ashamed. So, we didn'ttell you, and I went to the hospital alone. it was an accident. I'm so sorry, brian. I'm so sorry, brian. But it wasn'T... it wasn't my fault. It's not my faultthat she's gone. It's not my fault. It's okay. It's okay. Sometimes adopted kidshave trouble connecting. Thousands of mothersgo through it. It's nothing tobe ashamed of. Okay? Given what happened at home,you have to consider the possibilitythat samantha ran away. Unless noneof it happened and they're pullingthe wool over our eyes. You know how many abusiveparents I've seen fake tears? - Ah, they'renot faking it. - We'll see. Still, if she wasburned that badly, she needed more treatment. I'll have my people checkthe hospitals and clinics. Thank you. You know, you were very goodback there, with mrs. Burch. Very nurturing. Maybe you should get a puppy. I could talkto obama's people. Alec has allergies. Poodles. No fur. They have hair. That's not what it's about. I watched as they murdered almost every memberof the village. The rest of us theydragged into the bush, where I was madea rebel officer's wife. The horrors I saware beyond compare. Rape. Torture. Massacres carried outby child soldiers. Northern uganda has beenstuck in this nightmare... no deception leakage. She wasn't involvedin the massacres. She seems pretty anxious. Well, it's not unusual. She's speaking in frontof a big group of people. Thank you all so much for coming out to supportpeace in northern uganda. thank you for coming. I hope my speech wasn'ttoo long and boring. Oh, no, no, no,we're fans. Yeah, you looked a littlenervous up there. You'd think I'd be usedto public speaking by now but I'll admit,my heart still races. Oh, I-I brought mycopy of your book. You promised to sign it. Of course. This is for both of you? Oh, no, no, no,we're not together. No, we came together. But it is not a date. Well, it was niceto meet you both. What? We heard ms. Mugisha speaktwice about the massacres. When she deniedbeing involved there was no increase inwhat we call manipulators and no visiblemicroexpressions. And what's that in english? She said she didn't kill anyone, and shewas telling the truth. Great. That's it, then. - I think we might want to take another look at her. - Why? There's something about her. Something'S... something's not right. Do you have any evidenceto support that? No, but if webrought her back in-- I don't have time for this.I came in for your report. What is it? There's no evidencethat she's lying. That's what I needed to hear. Thanks very much. guess mugishagets to meet oprah. What's it say? "Eli, thank you for listening. I hope to see you again." And, uh... that's her phone number. Thanks for calling us,detective. Where'd you getthis prize, then? Canvassingthe hospitals. He was working as a nurse at the free clinicin mount pleasant. Seemed a little off, so we ran him. Turns out, he was workingunder a false name. Guy's a registered pedophile. - Whoopsie. - Why bring us in? We haven't been able toget anything out of him. You guys havedone okay so far. - He's got something for us. - Let's hope. No, I'm telling you. He's trying not togive himself away. This guy knows something. *****IvesI haven't seen the girl. Yeah, I know. I don't believe you. - Well, I'm telling the truth. - No, you're not;you're lying. - No. - No, you are. You're lying, yeah. - I never touched her, all right? - Now, that's the truth. I don't thinkyou're even attracted to her, are you? But you have seen her. Right? If I say I saw her, they'll say that I hurt her. Even you think I hurt her. No, that'snot true. I don't thinkyou hurt her. I don'T. Now, you're sweating. And you're frail. Desperately tryingto control yourself. What are you on? I take medcoprogesterone. That's for chemicalcastration, right? You're doing thatto yourself? I don't wantto hurt any more kids. Good for you. That's nice. So, where did you see her, then? At the clinic. She has a full thickness burn. And she comes in every other wednesday so I can treat it. Keep taking the pills, kevin. I got it. Dinner was wonderful--thank you. Well, if you thinkdinner was good, wait for the tour. What are thesepictures? Well, uh, the facesare speaking. What are they saying? They're tellingthe truth about what each personis feeling. That's what we do here. We... we read faces and body language,and we try to spot lies. Look. Agony. Contempt. Disgust. They look the same on everybody? Yeah, they're universal. I don't believe it. Well, I peed sittingdown till I was ten. See? Your eyes widened: Surprise. An americanpolitician, a french president and you. It's the same expressionusing the same muscles. That's remarkable. What? I was... just imagining a thousand thingsI want to do with you. Let's go for a ride. Not her. It's been two hours. You think we cantrust that pervert? Yeah, in my experience, self-castrating pedophilesgenerally tell the truth. - Got another one. - That's her. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah, lookat her eyes. Samantha burch? I'm a police officer. I'm hereto help you. She's goingto run. She's going to run. There she goes. - No!No, let me go, let me go! - We're not goingto hurt you. It's okay. - Where is she? - She's in with childprotective services. Follow me. Oh, my god. She's here. Samantha. Let me see her. oh, my baby. My little girl. It's really you. It's really you. Oh, samantha, thank god you're all right--samantha. My name is jessica, and I have to get homebefore my curfew. Sammy... sweetheart... don't you recognize us? My name is jessica, and I have to get homebefore my curfew. Now, samantha swallowedwhen she saw her parents. And she swallowed again when she said her namewas jessica. Swallowing is a signof strong emotion. So, she recognizedher parents, she lied about her name,and she knew she was lying. She's too clean and well fedto be a runaway. Could she havestockholm syndrome? It seems more likebattered person syndrome. No bruises, no cuts. No signs of sexual abuse. Yeah, butwith kids, just the threat of abuse is sometimes enoughto control them. We need her to name her abductor, right? So, we have to break their bond. You any goodwith kids, detective? Elements of content-based analysis. These arefoster's books. Yeah, I borrowed a few. Been doing some research. Okay... into what? Uh, mugisha. I've been tryingto figure out what felt wrong about her. - What do you mean? - Just... listen. The rebels agreed to a cease-fire a week before my birthday. But without the support of the international community, talks broke down by christmas. "A week beforemy birthday," "talks broke down by christmas"? Yeah, those detailsare contextual embedding. - Means she's telling the truth. - Yeah, but later,there's a change. I watched as they murdered almost every member of the village. The rest of us they dragged into the bush, where I was made a rebel officer's wife. No more contextual embedding. - She's lying. - The horrors I saw were beyond compare... that's, uh, not bad for a rookie,but it's wrong. That's not a conversation. It's a speech. It's written, it's memorized. You don't know whatyou're talking about. All right, maybeyou should just read up a little more. She got nervouswhen you told her what we do here--she touched her face. - That's a manipulator. - Oh, now you'rean expert on manipulators... because six weeks ago, you didn't even knowwhat that was. Okay, you just don't seewhat's going on here, because you've gota thing for her. That's not true. I saw that she didn't mention detailsabout the atrocities. Did you ever stop to think that maybe she doesn't wantto remember? I'm bringing this to foster. You do whateverthe hell you want. Samantha. I know that you knowyour name is samantha. I know that you're scared. What is he saying to her? He's telling herthat you love her, but I really think that sheshould hear that from you. I've tried. She doesn't hear me. I know it seemsthat way. You reach out to her, and then she rejects you, and you can'thelp but recoil. You don't know what it's like. You're not a mother. No, but I was. My husband and iadopted a baby girl last year. We brought her homefrom delaware, and we bathed her androcked her to sleep and built a nursery. In delaware, the birth motherhas 60 days to change her mind. We made it to day 57. And I didn't getto keep my baby, but... yours is right there. You know, you need totalk to her. What was your daughter's name? Sophie. I tried so hard. Look, samanthaneeds to know that you love her,no matter what she does. I think youshould tell her. Then maybe she'll tell uswho took her. It's the onlyway she'll start seeing you as her mother. hey, samantha. I'm here. I'm right here. You can say you'renot my daughter. You can say you're not my sammy. You can tryto push me away, but I'm you're mother,and I'll always find you. I'm your mother. I love you,and I'm not going anywhere. Mom. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. it's okay. I was worried about heather. Who's heather? She's the other girl. What other girl? The other girl who was taken. Who's heather? Do you knowher last name? I can't tell you. You afraid? What are you afraid of? Samantha... no one is goingto take you again. We got you now, darling. I could go outside... Or heather could. But never at the same time. Go out where? We always had to be back by noon. Where? Ba where? She's still there. We'll get her outof there safe, honey. Just tell us where she is. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. You bring all your dates here? Just the ugandanpeace activists. Actually, I don'T... I don't go outon many dates. Why not? People lie to you withpolite conversation. Then, when they finallyshow themselves to you, you realize you've spent allthat time with a stranger. I promise not to makeany polite conversation. What is it? Uh, torres, the woman I was withat your speech... she thinks you're lying about... well, it's hard to exp... you touched your ear. Does that mean I'm lying? Are you? What part of your story isn't true? Is any of it true? Who would make upsuch a terrible story? Do you know how many peopleare taken in my country? Do you have any ideawhat that does to a person? You were nevertaken, were you? They're children. Children who have seenunspeakable things. Made to dounspeakable things. But it's a lie. It never happened to you. It happened. It's happening. But nobody listeneduntil there was a face. My face. My story. Every lie has consequencesthat you can't see coming. Someone needed to speak. I was educatedin the west. When I talk, peoplelike you hear me. My country is being torn apart by violence and shame and I would do anythingto stop the killing. What are you going to do, eli? This other girl-- heather-- might be heather mahome. Disappearedabout three months ago. Foster kid, recently placed. There were some similarities in their cases, but whensamantha disappeared... the press jumped in, and nobodywas interested in heather. Happens every day. All right, it's past noon. We have to find heather now. I need to talkto samantha again. Samantha... I'm going to play 20questions, all right? I can't sayanything. That's all right,I'm going to do the talking. All right, we knowthe person who took you uh, is an animal, so we'll countthat as question one. Two. Is it someone you know? Someone you know. Three. Is it a teacher? Not a teacher. Four. Is it someone connectedto your family? Someone who worksfor your family? Six. Is she your psychiatrist? dr. Knowlton? Police. Open the door. They're gone. still searchingthe house. Found samantha's sweater. Also a bunch of picturesof this girl. - What, another girl she took? - Nope. - That's dr. Knowlton'sdaughter. - What? Jessica. August 2006. Apparently, she died two yearsago-- some kind of accident. - They're replacements. - What do you mean? Samantha and heather are stand-insfor the daughter that knowlton lost. They don't look anything alike. It doesn't matter. It's about heremotional connection to the girls. Knowlton's using them to relive the life she hadwith her daughter. You think she took heather somewhere she usedto go with jessica? It could be more specific than that. Think you can find out wherejessica died? everybody hold. - Is she okay? - I can't tell. I'm not taking any chances. I'll get a negotiator out here. No, let us talk to her. She's got a gun. You looking to get shot? Well, how long isit going to take to get a negotiatorout here? ****** She's sleeping. Did you drug her? This is one of our favorite spots. Jessica loves to swim. Jessica's dead, dr. Knowlton. I told her not to dive here. But she wouldn'tlisten. I know you don't wantto hurt her. For years I've been dealingwith troubled kids. Every day I see the parentsscrewing them up. I understand. No, you... you took them for their own good. No, you could do a better jobraising them. That's right. I'm a good mother. They loved living with me--they would come back every time I let them out. I'm a good mother! I haven't talked to foster yet. Well, I did. She called the publisher. They're probably pullingfarida's book off the shelf right now. I'sorry. She could've writtena different book. She didn't have to say those things happened to her. No, she's right. Nobody would havepaid attention. And the funny thing is she went out with me even after she found outwhat I do for a living. I think on some levelshe wanted to get caught. Or maybe she just liked you. Well, I don't really care. Hey, loker. You just lied. Yeah. I just needed a minutebefore I went home. Sure. Sophie's 13 months. You know, she's probablywalking now. Yeah, emily startedaround that age, I think. She's probably changing so fast. Every now and then I see alittle girl on the street, and I, uh, I think it's her. And I have to... fight so hard not to run up and hug some, you know,stranger's little girl. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's just, uh, alec doesn't want to talkabout it. Um, he says he can't, you know. So we don'T.
