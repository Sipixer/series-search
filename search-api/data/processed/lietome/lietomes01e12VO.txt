Are you okay? Yeah. I, uh... No. Not really. I... I just lost a patient. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm- I'm studying to be a nurse. I was just gonna go grab some coffee, Uh, clear my head. Somebody help me! Help me, please! Somebody help me! It seems that a Copycat of serial rapist Andrew Jenkins is on the loose. Andrew Jenkins has been serving consecutive life Sentences at Utley State Penitentiary for more than a decade. Now, Jenkins abducted, blinded and then raped 12 women in the '90s. In the past three months, Six more women have been abducted, blinded and raped. So what does Andrew Jenkins know about these new crimes? When will this Copycat be caught? And what is being done to stop him? What's up, bitch? Does anybody want to tell me why Mr. Genius is ignoring the guy he's here to talk to? I mean, what is he waiting for? Andrew Jenkins is a highly skilled Pathological liar. If we come at him head on, we'll get nothing. If Jenkins has Intel on the Copycat, It'd be good to get it before another woman gets abducted. Lightman wants Jenkins to make the first move, And he will. And what if he gets made? He won't. Agent Reynolds, if you didn't think we could do the job, Why did the FBI bring us on the case? Look, I've interviewed Jenkins five times And I got zero on the Copycat. So let me put it this way. I don't believe in Holistic Medicine, But if the Chemo's not working, I'll give Acupuncture a shot. Hey, man, you need a hand? I think Acupuncture's about to pay off. Hello? If you change your mind, just give me a yell. Name's Andrew Jenkins. Progress. Patience is not one of your virtues, Is it, Agent Reynolds? No. Is that Jenkins' Fan Mail? Ten years of sickos and freaks worshipping him. All right, take it all back to the office. Odds are good the Copycat's in there somewhere. Good Luck. Heard about you on TV. You're that-- You got that Copycat, right? Swelling chest, chin up, smile. That's pride. I don't get it, myself. I mean, you're just another pervert who can't close. Is that who I am? What happens, you just, you get... you get queasy when it comes time to finish, is that it? What are you in for? I got an Ex-wife, Who sometimes doesn't let me see my kids. And a Cop took her side. And a Jury said that I killed him. This, um, this Cop... Does he jerk awake every morning with your name on his lips? Is your face the last thing he sees every night before he falls asleep? When he meets someone new, hears the horror in their voice, Who does your Cop think of? Oh, wait. That's-that's right. He's not thinking of anyone. Take your point. Thought you might. What's on your mind? Nothing. Oh, come on. Ask. I don't get it. I mean, I don't, I-I, I don't get it. Why'd you have to blind them? I mean, it seems a bit excessive, you know? Oh, come on, that's an easy one. No eyes, they can't identify me after. How'd you get caught, then? Busted tail light. I had a girl in the trunk. Almost talked my way out of it, Even with her screaming back there. You-you're that good, are you? Yeah. But you aren't. Excuse me? Different costume, same game. Now you've lost me. Who are you? 'Cause you're not a Cop killer. That's what I keep telling my Lawyer. No. You're a fraud. Who sent you in here? Special Agent Reynolds? Ah, damn it! Alert the guards in the laundry. We got a situation. Lightman's supposed to be reading Jenkins. It looks like it's the other way around to me. I-I've never seen anyone read Lightman who hasn't had Deception Training. I-I don't know what happened. Well, it was worth a shot. Cal Lightman. How do you do? And you want to know what I know about my friend, the Copycat. Yeah, something like that, yeah. How come nobody's tried to bribe me? What would it take? All good. - It's very Civil - Right. What would it take? You know what I like? Chocodiles. I'd like a box a week. All right, it's a deal. Yeah, I'm gonna need that in writing. You made a deal with a Pathological lying serial rapist for Chocodiles? Who's the Copycat? Well, You get an A for effort. And effort should be rewarded. 3748 Woodlawn Road. Good Luck. What happened? Jenkins played you, that's what happened. And while you were signing a contract for snack cakes, Camille Halpern was being abducted from this house. So Jenkins didn't lead us to the rapist. He led us to another victim. Lie To Me 01x12 - Blinded All right, this is single mom Camille Halpern. If form holds, The Copycat will toy with her the first 24 hours, And then he'll blind her and rape her. And we're already down three hours. What's he do before he blinds them? He ties them up, gags them and forces them to watch videos of his previous victims. So right now, Camille is watching what he's gonna do to her. Yeah, if we don't get to her first. Well, Cube's ready. Nobody talks to Jenkins but me. We clear? I pulled strings all over D.C. to get this bastard in here. So I sure hope that this plan is a lot more successful than your last one. At least we know Jenkins is connected to the Copycat. That's more than you found out the last three months. Now, I told you where to find him. You just got there late. Agent Ben. Thanks for the Hall Pass. Hi, Foster. Follow me. Oh, somebody doesn't like me talking to his lady. I got to call the Deputy Director with the great news. That's the guy that out-Lightman'd Lightman? So now what? You make the Puppet dance? What? I called Natalie Wright, the woman attacked two weeks ago. She's a wreck, But she's the only Copycat victim willing to talk to me. I thought I might be able to get some detail that could help us with our new victim. So I'll be on my cell. If you need me. Cal... No, 'cause normally, you add "if you need me." You're pissed, right? Because you think I blew it at the prison, right? I'm not blaming you. Well, you're angry. Because Jenkins is loving this. I mean, this is the best day he's had in over a Decade. He's out of jail, he's getting all this attention. We are fulfilling his every fantasy. By "we," you mean me. Is that it? So you're a big deal, huh? Fancy Offices, bevy of fine ladies. Real step up from Cell Block two. Do you know who the Copycat is? No. What's your mom's name? Gina. No, it's Margaret. Where were you born? Georgia. No, Nebraska. Where'd you go to school? Didn't. So you don't count flunking out of, uh, Southern Iowa State after one semester then? What the hell is he doing? I'm concentrating. Hey! I could be following up on ten different leads right now. So you're gonna explain Why this isn't Jenkins taking one more useless Polygraph test. Wow. Okay, where should I even start? I'm monitoring Heart Rate, Skin Temperature, Perspiration, Vocal Stress, Blood Pressure-- Which doesn't even begin to cover what Lightman is seeing in there, and what the cameras are... All right, all right, enough. Who's the Copycat? Don't know. Would you tell me if you did? Sure. We're pals. Hey, how's it going? Jenkins is lying about everything. He won't let us establish a baseline of what he looks like when he's telling the truth. Hey, looks like I found somebody suspicious in the Fan Mail. Every week this guy sends disgustingly graphic drawings of Jenkins' Crimes. Let me see that. Well, it's one sick puppy, but that's not our guy. And how can you know that? I can know that because he's fantasizing about past actions. You want to look for somebody who's making plans for the future. Let me see that. How is it I'm the unpaid intern and you're the highly paid Professional? Hey, you're the one Lightman's got sitting in the front row. So... I'll just put this in the "No" pile. Who's the Copycat? Who's the girl? You're a distraction. I had to ask Loker a question, And you've got me reading all this Fan Mail. And what, so you're above that now, is that it? No, no, it's just that you squaring off with a Master liar is kind of once-in-a-lifetime. Oh, and you think you'll learn something? A woman gets raped, she gets blinded, but at least you've been afforded an education, is that it? Or maybe you just don't want me to see that you're struggling. Oh, that's an interesting theory. But incorrect. And that Fan Mail you're so disdainful of-- Well, the guy we're looking for is in there somewhere. And that's a fact, that's not a theory, So go find him. Mm. "Or maybe you just don't want me to see that you're struggling." She's very perceptive, You're little... protege. Who's the Copycat? We can do this all day. I'm not gonna make your little machines beep. There's no one who can stay with you? I don't want anyone to see me. W-Well, what about your parents? My mom is gone. My dad was here for a few days, But it... just made things worse. My friends do what they can. I'm s... I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry. I want to help you. I know he has another woman, but I... I can't remember. He said his dog was missing, and I helped him, And then... It's just gone. And when I try to remember, all I can think is... No one will ever love me. I'm... I'm 23 years old, And my life is over. My life is over. OK so... This is the girl he's got right now. Any idea where he's keeping her? No. I'll take that as a yes, then. Uh, DC? Maryland? Virginia? The home for bad boys was in Maryland. You probably know that. You know, you'd think I'd have all kinds of Horror stories, But it was actually nice. Had a dog. Some of the guys from Gen Pop get to Train seeing-eye dogs. I signed up for it once, didn't get picked. Why do you think that is? You see, that was weird. That was, 'cause that was the truth. Why the sudden honesty? Am I boring you? Is that it? It's too easy? Lightman-- it's an interesting name. I've been called a... Light Bringer myself. You see, there you go again, that was the truth. Might be getting somewhere. Here's something else that's true. I'm never... gonna tell you who the Copycat is. Okay. Okay. Hey, Torres. Do any of, uh, Jenkins' Fans refer to him as "Light Bringer"? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, one guy. Um, it stood out to me, 'cause I went to Catholic school. Light Bringer's another name for the Devil. It's here in the "No" pile. What am I missing? Pathological liars like pushing boundaries. Jenkins has been in that box all night-- he's bored. He's flirting with the truth. By telling you the Copycat's pet name for him? Yeah the person who calls him Light Bringer is very important for him somehow He's important enough that When the truth starts coming out, It's the first person he thinks of. Here, got it. Milo Dodds. Thank you. You've been writing to Jenkins for years. In fact, You've written more letters than anyone. We counted. Is that illegal? What do you know about the Copycat? It's on the news. That's an evasion. He's hiding something. Oh, yeah, and what are you hiding, Milo, hm? Is it a woman? Is it Camille Halpern? The mother of a two-year-old little boy? I'm not hiding anything. That's a masking smile. That's bad, that is. So, tell me this. What's your favorite part? Is it the sizzle of the acid as you pour it into her eyes? Or is it the blood Dripping down her cheek? Blood, you like that? Blood flowing? Blood? I didn't do anything. Where is she? I don't know. You sick Son of a... Where is she? Where?! Where?! I don't know! Whoa! Whoa! No! In the room, in the room, in the room, in the room. What room? I didn't take her-- I just cut out the article. I'm a Collector. Work with me, Milo. - Come on, work with me! - I didn't do it. He's not the guy, let him go. Hey! Hey! Three He's not the guy! Aah! Two... Let him go! Look. Look, look, look. One... Look, look. What the hell? He's a Hemo-Phobe. He... He's afraid of blood. And how would you know that? When you started talking about blood, he got woozy. He... He got short of breath. He's not the guy. He couldn't even give the girl a paper cut. So another dead end. Well... No, not exactly. Well, Milo Dodds didn't work out. Is he gonna bring him here and go through his sicko Memorabilia. Hopefully, we'll find some new suspects. Well, Jenkins is amazing. You know, in-in kind of an Evil way. I mean, he's, like, Dark Lightman. Ooh, rewind. There. Look at how he's folding the laundry. Jenkins comes up, and he slows down. He's concentrating too hard, it's a dead giveaway. He did screw up. Couple of months ago, you wouldn't have noticed that. But now that you apparently know everything you think. It's more important to prove that I screwed up than find a missing woman, is that it? No, I wasn't trying... We-we were just trying to establish A baseline for Jenkins. Yeah, well, forget it. Can you go back? Run it back? Push in on the Guard. All right. Zoom in. And let it play. ...What I know about my friend, the Copycat. You see the Nostril flare? Quick intake of breath. When he thought Jenkins was gonna open up about the Copycat He panicked. Like he was afraid of getting caught. The Guard's the Copycat. Could he have gotten to Camille before you? Hey, where's the Guard? Where's, uh, Calvo? Oh, his shift ended a while ago. They're here. It's been 11 years since her attack, And she's doing well now. Okay. I can do this. Okay, I just want you two to talk. You know, maybe she can help you remember something. But don't push yourself. Okay? Okay. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming. Come on in. Sure. Natalie. Careful. Uh, I want you to meet Michelle Russell and her husband Paul. Hi. Hi, Natalie. You know, we can do this all day. You know, it's over for you, Calvo, You understand that, right? So just tell me where Camille is, and I'll get The D.A. to cut you a break. It'll make me sick, But I'll do it, for you. It's a one-time offer, Calvo. One time! Hey. He's not your guy. He's not your guy. What the hell are you doing? He is the guy! No, no. He-He showed shame. Psychopaths never show shame. Calvo called in sick four times in the last year. And each time, the day after one of the Copycat's victims was released. And that's not a coincidence. No, no. I think it's very important. But he's not your guy. It has to be him! Look, every time he takes another woman, And every time a kid loses the mother they once had and gets back a... An empty shell, I think to myself, "This is the last one. No more." And every time, I've been wrong, but I know I'm right about this. Okay. Okay. Who did you lose? Who? Did you lose your mum or... What? Did you... You lost someone? Hey. Hey. Don't use that stuff with me, okay? He is the guy! Good news is, I think he can lead us to the rapist. But you got to stop yelling at him. Okay? I appreciate you both making the time. Natalie needed to know that her life isn't over. Oh, it helps Michelle, too. Talking to other victims. Testifying at Jenkins' Parole hearing. It's her way of fighting back. She went to the Parole hearing? That must have been tough. Oh, she handled it better than I did. I took a shot at the guy. Oh, excuse me. Sure. Where is she? She's right here, to the right. Okay. Um, she said there were no sounds where she was kept. Nothing at all from the outside. Like she was kept underground? I'll let Agent Reynolds know that. Okay, well, we're going to keep talking. I'll try to get more. Thank you. Tony, let me explain something to you, okay? Dr. Lightman is the best friend you have in the World right now. He says that you're not the Copycat. He says that you may be a victim, too. Now, sit down. Okay, now, Jenkins made you deliver letters to the Copycat. Am I right? How? Ok. The Copycat's victims. Did he bribe you? Did he threaten you? So, he threatened you. A shiv in the side? Not now, Torres. He threaten your family? I got two little girls, man. You think you can match him, but you can't. I was there. I saw him with you. He's better than you. Well, if he was better than me, I wouldn't have been able to find you, would I? And I can protect your family. Whatever it takes. All right, look, Calvo. This is the girl he's got now. You helped him take her. Now, help us save her. He gave me the letter. He said if I didn't deliver it, He'd come after my little girls. So, you just did what he asked? First, it was once in a while. I would take the letter and put it underneath The heavy trash can at Grant Park. But I never see no one pick them up. This is Reynolds. I need a Surveillance Team. Hurry up! And then, suddenly... Jenkins' Crime spree began all over again. Those were my little girls, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, If you come through for us with this, I'll put you and your whole family in protective custody by the end of the day. He gave me another letter today, man. He gave you a letter today? While you were here? No, it couldn't be. We were watching him every second. There's no cameras in your bathroom, man. That was hours ago. I'm sorry. Yeah, get a Unit over to Grant Park right now. And if anybody even goes near a trash can, you grab them. You understand me? Hey, Jenkins? Jenkins. We got Calvo now. We know about the letter. So, we are going to find your little friend. Good reading, that letter. Might have mentioned a friend of yours. Thank you. Meeting Michelle, It really helped. I'm glad. You did some amazing work today, Natalie. I'll visit you tomorrow, okay? Can I give you a hug? Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you, Gillian. Good night. Hey! No... I d... I didn't see him. Okay... He went that way. I just... Ooh, you look good in black and blue. Yeah, well, we're quite a pair. Reynolds had a Team scour the area, But he was gone Jenkins was instructing him. He was passing notes through one of the Guards. I told you I was going to Natalie's house right outside the door to the Cube. He must have heard us. I'm sorry, love. He wouldn't have gone this far unless you were under his skin. Not worth it. You get hit, and it's okay? I get hit, and suddenly, it's time to throw in the towel? You got to spend some time with one of these victims. Then you tell me it's not worth it. It's Torres. Hey. Hey. How's Foster? Is she okay? Well, yeah. She's okay. Thank God. So, I got an idea. I want to bring in Michelle, One of the victims that Foster's been working with. Get her to talk to Jenkins. Absolutely not. Look, Jenkins gets off on the pain of his victims. Maybe a face to face will get him excited, Get him to give up something. Oh, what? So you think that you can get more out of him than I can? You're pretty confident, aren't you? Camille's got less than 11 hours before this guy makes her feel sorry she's alive. It's worth a shot. He'll demolish you. Forget it. Lightman just hung up on me. He wouldn't even listen. But I'm right. Hey, whatever you're thinking about doing, don't. I need your help. Yeah, I kind of figured that. Andrew Jenkins. I'm Ria Torres. Lightman's little Protege. Has he given up on the game already? He had another appointment. But somebody else wanted to stop by. Remember me? Number 12. Pink scrubs. Does your boss know you arranged this little reunion? Yeah, he left it in a note I found underneath the trash can. Who is the Copycat? You would have made a great nurse. What's your mother's name? What is this? What's happening in there? It's Torres' idea. She thought Jenkins might crack if he was confronted with one of his victims. And no, Lightman doesn't know about it. Is it working? His Skin temperature is rising. He's definitely aroused. And that was totally not the right thing to say. I should be on the other side of this glass. She shouldn't be alone. Who is the Copycat? I don't know. Where did you spend your twelfth birthday? You could have at least come up with some different questions. Keep going, Michelle. Who is the Copycat? Dr. Lightman. Get out. Get out. Ria, what's going on? Daddy's home. Get out. Now. All right. Michelle, I'm Cal Lightman. I think what you're doing is very brave, But I'm going to take over from here. All right. I told you not to... We've only got six hours. What did I say? What did I say?! What did I say?! I told you! I told you not to do this! She wanted to face him. This has got nothing-- nothing-- to do with what she wants! Do you hear me?! Now, get back to work! Get back to work! Spicy, that one. Now, the attack on my Colleague was, uh, stupid. Now, you played your hand. Failed, by the way. If at first you don't succeed, Try, try again. You know, he's still learning, that one. But you're not just mad at me, are you? Mmm. You're mad at her. She showed you up. No! No, no, no, no, no. Whoa, no, no. We're good. All good. All good. The Copycat isn't copying anymore. They found Camille Halpern. She's dead. The attack on Foster-- Was predictable. I should have seen that coming. Can't always be one step ahead. Yeah, but I'm a man of Science. Shouldn't have lost it like that. You were trying to show off for your little Protege. Show you were still Number One. But you got carried away, and... Now she's walking all over you. And I suppose your Protege wouldn't act out like that, right? He's comparing me to the Copycat. Short leash. That's the key. When I first met Torres, She was screening carry-ons at the Airport for 12 bucks an hour. Now barely four months later, she's breaking up with me. Maybe she likes me better. No, I'm not talking about romance here. This is the third phase of the Mentor-Protege Relationship-Separation. Phase one-- Initiation, Establishing shared interests. Like falling in love. Phase two's even better. Mutual growth, high productivity. Could go on for years. And then one day, The Protege surpasses the Mentor. He closed. Jenkins' heart rate is through the roof. He's not a happy Camper. Murder's all over the news. He's even got a nickname. He's the "Capital Killer." He's more famous than you are now, so... I should tell you, Lightman asked me to get those photos made when we first discovered that Camille was missing. So Camille's not dead? We don't know yet. Lightman knew from the beginning it was all a setup. He planned the whole thing, all of it. Even letting Jenkins see through him at the prison. Yeah, he set up a False Power Dynamic-- Build Jenkins' Confidence, Lower his Defenses. Lightman played me, too. He pushed me to disobey him, 'Cause he knew it would trigger Jenkins. The long Con. One of Lightman's favorite moves. You knew? No idea. He is scary good. Seems like I'm not the only one going through a Breakup. Too bad. June would have been four years. The fruit and flowers Anniversary. He just gave us a time frame for the Initiation. Well, thank you. For what? For what?! The truth. Hey Fanboy I need to know if something big happened in Jenkins' life, in June, four years ago. Um, his Parole hearing. I was there. I taped the whole thing. Okay, I'm here at Andrew Jenkins' first Parole hearing. In just moments, Jenkins himself Is going to walk into the room. This is just weird. I had to spend the day with him. There's got to be something on this tape. There's Michelle and her husband. Can you imagine having to sit there and look at the guy that did that to your wife? That's Milo's Fan Club. It has to be one of them. Well, they might be working together as a Team. Nice. Go back. Stop it there. And on the husband. And freeze it. All right, Torres, what do you see? Uh, something weird about his anger towards Jenkins. Yeah, onset's too fast. What does that mean? Real anger starts more slowly and then builds. Fake anger has a more jagged onset. Comes in stages. And after the fake anger, Adulation. Oh, my God. Husband's a Fan. Do you know where Paul is? He, um, he checks on his empty listings every night. He's a Real Estate Agent. Can we, uh, can we have his addresses? What's going on? Paul Russell is not your husband's real name. It's Leo Carter. He changed it six years ago before you met. I-I don't understand. We found letters he wrote to Andrew Jenkins in prison. He wanted to tell him how much he hated him. How he hurt me. No. They were-- they were Fan letters. From before you two even met. That's not possible. Michelle, we really... No. He sought you out to be close to Jenkins, And to be close to what Jenkins did to you. So, um, so all those nights where he told me That I should talk about-about what happened, That it would help me, you're saying that he would... He was enjoying it? Michelle, you can help us find Camille. In time. The listings are in the drawer next to the desk. All right. All right... Well, there's over 20 houses here. Have you got enough men to get to all of them? We only have to find the one. Now Foster said underground, right? That means the place would have a basement And an attached garage so that he could drive right in. Houses shouldn't be too close together. And he'd prefer a young, busy neighborhood. The more going on, the less people notice. 63 Meadow Lane. McLean, Virginia. Let's go. It's all right. You're safe now. Stop! Freeze! Go home. You used me. You made it easy. How did you know how to get to Jenkins? In Prison, the first time I asked him About the Copycat, he showed pride. Also there was just the faintest hint of Anger. So I knew he resented his Protege. Right. The kind of thing only you would notice. Yeah, well, I'm trying to teach you. You let me think that Camille was dead. Yeah, yeah, I did. Couldn't afford anyone knowing that any part of this Was a Con-- Jenkins would have read it. Reynolds knew. Only about the photograph. Are you jealous? Really? How long till we break up for real? Eons. You've got loads to learn. Hey. This is my Assistant's notion of Whimsy. Very cute. Yeah? Look, I just wanted to say thank you. Hell of a job. There's no Universal signal for gratitude. Surprises some people. Well, it's a good thing I can use my words. Your Boss wants to put me on a retainer. Well, even the Government has a good idea once in a while I'll make FBI cases my number one priority. In exchange, they pay me handsomely And give me full access to Federal Resources. Well, good luck with that. Including you. Excuse me? They want me to have a man with a gun around full time. To protect the valuables, huh? Guess I can't blame them. I mean, you guys are a bunch of Scientist nerds Running around poking your nose in people's faces-- Calling them Liars. But I am not a Bodyguard. I don't have anything like you in my toolbox. And you're something that I clearly need. Without you, we wouldn't have found Camille Halpern in time. Plus, Foster could have been killed today. I said yes. Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but I'm saying no. No, you're not flattered. You're angry. But the decision's been made Above your pay grade, so... Hey, hey. Look, if this happens,
