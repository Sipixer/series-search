- Stay here! - No! Stay here. Son of a... What the hell, man? What's wrong with...? Open the door. Open the door! Wake up! Come on, man, open the door! Wake up! Open the door! Get him out of the car! It's gonna go! .: Team UnderCovers :. NCIS Los Angeles 1x20 - Fame - You know what young say they want to be when they grow up? Probably not a Navy SEAL. Not a teacher, not an astronaut or anything that requires effort. All kids want to be is famous. And girls just want to have fun. 15 minutes of fame is nothing new. Morning, guys. Morning, Nate. - Good workout? - Yes, maxed out the delts... feeling that. And my glutes... keeping my glutes in shape. A guy carves a ten-foot-tall human out of stone and buries it, then he discovers a petrified giant. The media has a frenzy, people come from all over. A story of instant celebrity from... drum roll... 1868. There's a sucker born every minute. Actually, Barnum never even said the famous quotation Barnum made a second stone giant. Then the guy who owned the first one said people who saw Barnum's giant were suckers. Yeah, so we celebrate Barnum for a quote he never said about a phony replica of a crackpot hoax. Well, well. Callen. Doc. Sorry. Little sore in - the delts. - But the glutes are good. - You heard that? - I did. - Sam. - That desk is taken, Deeks. You can't sit there. Excuse me. Mr. Hanna, I asked Detective Deeks to sit there. I did so politely. Detective Deeks has been appointed our LAPD liaison, filling a chair that, though taken, has been vacant for some time. Welcome aboard, Deeks. Thanks. So you're sort of a temp. Temp. Yeah, I like that. See, with cops, having a negative nickname's a good thing. No time to waste. We have a case. Deeks? Really? Really. LAPD liaison. That's the best they could do? And... - it's the best they can do. - Sorry. Forgiven. What do you got? Lieutenant Brian Roth sailed a car off Mulholland early this morning with two bullets in him. Eyewitness says he was still alive when he went over. But... he's not anymore. - The car wasn't his. - Whose was it? Belongs to Aubrey Darva. The Aubrey Darva? Aubrey's vying for the socialite tiara. Trying to out-Paris Paris Hilton and out-Kim the Kardashians. Photo on the right taken just last night. Posted on ZMZ. Famous for being famous. Welcome to Los Angeles. The point is, she wouldn't be hanging out with a sailor. More likely, this guy stole her car. - Was it reported stolen? - No. Not yet. Roth was at the top of his class at Annapolis with a flawless service record. - I wouldn't call him a nobody. - To her, he's a nobody. Not my opinion. Let's get up there and tell the LAPD we're interested. Good thing we have a liaison. Good thing. Okay, Eric, as soon as you find out, let me know. Time to do your liaison thing. Yeah, about that liaise thing. What's the wait? The car's coming up. - He doesn't want to. - Doesn't want to what? - Liaise. - Is that even a word? Yes. A liaison liaises. Well, maybe you can demonstrate. Thanks. - What was that about? - I don't know. I feel like a mom dropping off her kid, first day of school. Guys, how's it going? Beat it. Appreciate the help. Doesn't look like a very warm reception. We done? They told me... you don't need to know what they told me. Is it our crime scene? Conversation never got that far. Leave it to me. Undercover cops. I've pissed off more than my fair share of shields. - Why'd they choose you as our liaison? - Hetty's request. Thank you. Our case, our crime scene. You're okay, too, Deeks, if you're with us. Let's go, Temp. Two gunshots... shoulder, ribs. This guy would've bled out even without the crash. There's blood on the door handle. Means he got shot before he got in the car. Need to find that crime scene. There's a door-stamp for Balm. That's the hottest club in Hollywood. So Roth was there. Something happens that puts him in Aubrey's car and gets him shot. Balm isn't just socialite central for the Aubrey Darvas of the world. A lot of bad guys hanging out there, too. A nightclub called Balm. Need to see their security footage. - <i>I'm on it.</i> - Nothing here. Guys? Shoes... clutch... cell phone. - Things a girl does not leave behind. - And here... pink fabric. Remember that photo taken last night and posted on ZMZ? Aubrey Darva. She wore a pink dress. Find her. Nice. So, Aubrey's stepdad is Ben Darva. Immigrated a penniless kid, won a full ride to Harvard, made billions in real estate, and married a socialite from Pasadena. Aubrey is her kid, not his. Mother died a year ago. - You vacation with these people? - No, I just I remember things. - Hi. We're looking for Aubrey Darva. - Her father's by the pool. Must be nice to have your morning latte next to your pool. Mr. Darva, I'm Detective Deeks, LAPD. This is Special Agent Kensi Blye. You're having surveillance cameras? Yeah, because of all the break-ins. In the neighborhood over the last year. No one is safe. I'm assuming that's why you're here? No. We're here because of your stepdaughter, Aubrey. - Aubrey? - Did she come home last night? Yes. She always comes home. It's part of our deal. Could you check on her, please? Sure. This way. Part of your deal? Yeah. Aubrey had a problem with drugs after her mother died. But I trust her. She's bouncing back. We have... certain rules. It was her idea. Are you gonna tell me what this is all about? Her car was found at the bottom of a cliff this morning. So someone stole her car. That's what we're here to find out. Aubrey, there are people here to see you. We have a deal. I don't understand. What is this? What haven't you told me? I'm sorry, Mr. Darva, but the driver of the car had been in a shooting. Oh, my God. BOLO's out on Aubrey Darva? Eric's checking a number she called every day for the last 6 months. Perfect. Thanks. Got something... Police report on the break-ins in the neighborhood. I have ten. All high-end houses, all unsolved. Nine of those addresses are in Aubrey's phone. She knows the victims. You think she's mixed-up with a break-in crew? Supplying them with targets? She would know their habits, schedules, maybe even their security systems. How does this tie in to Midshipman Roth? Maybe Roth stumbles onto the ring tries to be a hero. Or he's part of the ring, and infighting gets he and Aubrey popped. - Except Aubrey doesn't need money. - That's not quite true. She's been in drug rehab, and her stepfather's tied her sizable allowance to her recovery. Maybe she's relapsing, needs cash to buy drugs. - You pulled her file? - Sure, but I knew that already. What? I enjoy my juicy celebrity gossip as much as the next guy. It's hard to believe a guy like Roth would be tied up in a break-in crew. If he was, his shipmates would know. Nice door stamp. I'm here because I went to a club? You're here because your buddy didn't come home. Brian didn't come home? Maybe he's still with that girl. Sorry. He's dead? I don't believe it. Roth was a guy who was gonna live forever. Lieutenant Perfect. What did you do yesterday? We threw Brian a birthday bash. His birthday's not till June. L.A. beats a port call in Yemen for fun, okay? We deploy in two weeks. Roth's a card nut, so... we spent the afternoon playing poker. Then we go to Balm, and Brian hooks up with this hot babe. I mean fantasy island hot. - And he leaves with her. - That piss you off? You kidding me? I wanted to hear his stories. I mean, ten months at sea, you want to hear tales like that and know they're real. I can't believe he's gone. You see fantasy island in here? That's her. Is she famous? Trying to be. And she's missing. - What do you know about that? - Nothing. She and Roth left the club about 11:30. - And Hadley and I headed back to base. - Right away? See, that's funny. Because if that was true, you'd have made it to Point Mugu by 1:00 a.m. But you didn't check in until 4:00. We went for a swim in Santa Monica. That Ferris wheel has great lights. Were they still on? You kind of walked into that. Your buddy's dead, his girl's missing and this hole in your timeline does not look good. So, did you follow them from the club? - Have you ever robbed a house? - No. What's that have to do? Where's Aubrey Darva? - I told you, I don't know. - Where'd you go after Balm? Hadley's scared like something went down and Tyre told him to keep quiet. Tyre is Roth's shipmate, not his friend. Never used his first name. Thanks, Eric. The phone Aubrey calls every day belongs to her rehab sponsor. I'll give him a call. These aren't our shooters? I doubt it. They both seem genuinely surprised Roth's dead. There's nothing that doesn't belong here. No stolen watches, no jewelry. No thick wad of cash. You don't go to Annapolis to blow it all by falling in with some break-in crew. What are these guys hiding? Maybe they know more about what happened to Aubrey. The longer she's missing, less likely we find her alive. What do you have? This is the audio from the SOS system in Aubrey's Mercedes. Picked up Roth saying something over and over. His voice is super weak, but here's what I got. Something, something, "king". Definitely "king". You don't waste your dying words. He's saying who shot him. It sounds like "club". It's a "Club King". "Club" could be "Balm". "King" could be a person. Or it could be a kingpin. There's lots of those at Balm. And Roth left with Aubrey. Maybe she was somebody else's girl. Making jealousy a possible motive for shooting him. Let me see the security footage from Balm. There is none. - They won't hand it over? - None to hand over. No cameras. That's why it's so popular with the rich and infamous. Nobody's watching. And forget about interviewing witnesses, even if something happened, - everybody's looking the other way. - The clock's ticking for the girl. If she's still alive. Then we're going clubbing. If some kingpin at the club had Roth shot, it supports Nate's theory his bunkmates didn't do it. They haven't told us where they went. We'll have to stay on them. What do you say, Sam? You want a swanky night in a hot club, or sweating Navy guys in a cold room? This is a fantastic plan, but you don't just waltz into Balm, okay? I get in on a connection I've developed, maybe Kensi gets in 'cause she's hot. Don't make it weird. But you... - only one way in. - Money. A lot of it. I'll arrange that, be ready to pay. - How much? - Guys drop 30 grand a night. Why don't you go ask Hetty for that? I'll go do that. I'll go. I'll go ask her. What can I do for you, Mr. Deeks? I've been sent to ask for funds to get into a nightclub undercover in an attempt to identify Roth and possibly Aubrey Darva's killer. That's uncharacteristically formal speech. You must be asking for a lot of money. Listen, here's the deal, okay? The only way I get us all in is if I sell Callen as a big spender. He needs to flash one of those credit cards with a no-questions-asked kind of limit. How about this? $50,000 limit. However, if more than $5,000 is charged to this card, I will come for you with my letter opener. Is that clear, Mr. Deeks? Got it. Wait. What? You want me to sign this? 'Cause it's... it's Cal... It's Callen's card. And you're the guarantor. Your credit card. $50,000 limit. Backstopped in the name of Ivan Kolvak. Wardrobe. - There's a trick somewhere. - It's got to be a trick. No trick. Just asked nicely. Deeks talked you into handing over a card with a $50,000 limit? Really? Do you remember Rio? That vicuña suit you wore. It cost ten grand. The cops hate Deeks. In Miami, you nearly scuttled a Feretti yacht of an Omani Prince. He's a lousy liaison, and yet I get the sense he isn't temporary. The repairs ale cost more than the limit on that credit card. I'm not complaining that you gave him the money. How could you, Mr. Callen? I gave you the card. You don't want him as a liaison. You want him as an agent. If they play Lady Gaga tonight dance one for me, would you? Ivan Kolvak and party. Back of the line. Sorry. We were told that we were on the list. Not on the list. - Back of the line. - No, it's okay, Jesse. They're with me. You should have said something. - All right, brother. - Thanks, man. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Tim, baby! - There she is. - So, this is your friend... - Ivan Kolvak. Dad runs the Russian oil business, you know. Well, Ivan, I am Sapphire. Anything you need, you ask me. I have you at the best table in the house with a lot of lovely ladies that are excited - to meet you. - That's great. You'd like to open a tab? God, I love this job. I can see why. She looks like a high-class madam. Except for sex is optional. It's the scene. What can I say? She called you Tim. Been here before? - Undercover. - Hers? God, you're like a bull instead of a tiger. You charge on in there. Thank you, darling Ladies. I don't believe it. My twelve o'clock... Aubrey Darva Alive. And well enough to party. Our victim just became our suspect. This place is a who's who. Of who's bad. Aubrey was speaking to that scrawny guy over there. Mr. Blood Diamond himself. And now she's talking to A.J. Madjan, the mad Armenian. Guy like that will kill over an insult. Or a girl like Aubrey. Any one of them could have passed as a club king to Roth. The question is, what does Aubrey know? Time to find out. - I'm gonna call you Fern, okay? - Don't you dare call me Fern. Fern, baby girl. It's been a long time. - I'm not interested. - Come on. Trust me. I got E, shabu, all the coke you can sink your pretty little face in. I said no! I don't believe the jerks in this place. Sorry. I don't mean you. It's just... Haven't been here since I... You know, good job saying no. He was a friend. Used to be. You don't really need to know all this stuff. It's okay. You have to dump friends who don't get it and make new ones who do. I haven't made a friend sober since... since I was pretty young. I'm Fern. Aubrey. I thought I recognized you. "L.A. story" I guess. You go for coffee, and there's Zoe Saldana. Can you tell I'm from Iowa? No. No, no. I get it. I saw Jeremy Piven today. I don't know why, but that man just... He does it for me. Where? When? At the spa. A friend took me for my six months. Six months clean. You'll make it, Fern. Hang in there. Fern... that was your doing? Yep. Kensi is going to kill you. I tell you what, that Aubrey doesn't look like she killed anybody last night. So either she doesn't know about Roth or her car, or she is ice-cold. Sapphire said this stuff is a thousand dollars a bottle. Right. Hetty cut a side deal with you, didn't she? That's how you got the card. Yeah. So, what's your limit, 15? Ten? Come on, five? I'm supposed to look like I can spend 50, and you're on the hook after five? She threatened me with a letter opener. I guess some people got to learn the hard way. Why? What are you... - We'll take two more bottles. - Okay. No, she's... Okay, see you. Listen, no, no. We're good. We're done. He was... That was a joke. He's funny. What do you have, Sam? Hadley and Tyre... they're not our guys. Spent most of their money and time with ladies on their laps. Then the club's head geisha sent the girls to another table. I'm looking at the head geisha now. Where'd they go after? A house of ill repute. - A cheap one. - Callen, interrupting here.</i> - <i>I got something.</i> - What is it, Eric? Aubrey isn't the only common factor in the break-ins</i>. The more recent victims had credit card charges at Balm.</i> Any activity on my card here? Yeah, they looked at your credit limit. That's a great way to figure out if someone's worth robbing. Find out just how close they looked, Eric. Roger that. Sometimes I just get so over being famous. Do you ever date normal guys? You know, I met this guy last night. A Navy Officer. - He didn't even know who I was. - He liked you for who you are. Crazy? - Can I talk to you? - No, Chaz! I told you that I am not talking. What's your problem? It's not your damn business. Guys? <i>Problem... someone's grabbed Aubrey.</i> Stay with her, Kens. And don't break cover. You think just because you're in rehab you can walk? - You're in way too deep! - If I had known for a second what... - Leave her alone. - Or what? - Smile for the cops. - Take care of her. Stay down on the ground! Put your hands behind your head. Now! Damn it! Callen? Had to break cover. I've lost Aubrey.</i> I got her, Kens. Deeks, south stairwell. Stay back. Drop the gun. Let her go. No way, man. I'll pop her! I got it, Callen. I'm walking out of here. Now! Need you to move now, Deeks. You okay? - You're not from Iowa, are you? - No. And my name's not Fern. Chaz... used to be my dealer. But... the blond guy, he...? He's a cop. You were very convincing. He said you were in too deep. Too deep into what, Aubrey? Had to do with... People getting robbed, didn't it? People you know? Aubrey, if your rehab is for real, I'm sorry we had to use it to get to you. It's one of the hardest parts of my job... but this is serious. They asked me if I knew people. If I did, I'd tell them about their houses and schedules... et cetera. So you were helping them rob your friends in exchange for drugs? Chaz said that he sold the info to paparazzi. I should have known better, but... I wanted the drugs. And one morning, I'm on the bathroom floor throwing up, and I hear on the radio that the Austins had been robbed, and I... I put it together. I'd hit rock bottom. I got in the car and checked into rehab, and I have not used... or told those guys a thing since. All I'm saying is that Aubrey was between the suspect and Callen. - He should've let me take the shot. - Yeah? And your bullet goes through him into her. Okay, but he only had, like, an inch of the guy's head showing. Which he hit, now, didn't he, Temp? Club used my credit card to get personal information. Address, whether or not I made payments on alarm systems, whole bunch of stuff. It's actually a pretty sophisticated search. Okay, so Aubrey goes sober, stops providing intel. So they start skimming info off the credit cards. Who ran the card? That'd be your girlfriend, Sapphire. Not my girlfriend. It's actually Tim's girlfriend, and sort of. So are we arresting her, or should I do my "liaiser" thing? We're solving Roth's murder, Deeks. And that's definitely not a word. So, you left the club with Brian Roth. Then what? Drove to my house, and we had sex. He lifted you out of the car, your dress got caught on the car door. Yeah. How did you know about that? What happened next? We... fell asleep. He got up, I thought to go to the bathroom, but... he was gone when my friend woke me up at 8:00 and took me to the spa. - I never even looked for the car. - Did he leave a note? No. I was bummed. I actually hoped that he would be there. Can you take me home now? Aubrey puts Brian Roth at the Darva mansion until about 1:00 a.m. - Then he drives off the cliff at 2:15. - With two bullets in him. So he took a car, drove somewhere and got shot. How far could he have gone, Eric? Pretty far. No traffic that time of night. Okay, so where did he go? What the hell is he mixed-up in that got him shot? Gambling debts? His buddies said he played poker. They did. I got to check something. Aubrey, do you have two cell phones? No. Must be Brian's. Battery's dead. He didn't say anything to you? Say he'd be right back, could he borrow your car? He just snuck out, leaving his phone, and took your Mercedes? Wait, he did say something. He asked me if he could raid the fridge. - The fridge? - It's in the main house. Fresh paint. Still tacky. Okay. So, if your blood is under that paint, it means you were standing here. You got shot. Then what? Roth didn't say, "Club King", he said, "King of Clubs". - He got shot over a poker hand? - It's not a game, it's the deck. A special deck issued to all the sailors and soldiers who went to Iraq. Iraq war fugitive cards. Always my lucky deck. Eric, King of Clubs, captured or killed or still at large? Hassan Al-Jahiri. One of Saddam's top Generals. - Still at large. - He was there yesterday at the house. Roth must have seen him and recognized him. And got shot for it. In the car, he wasn't just telling us who shot him... He was trying to warn us, like a good soldier should. Hey, it says here that Jahiri's been advising terrorists via the Internet. He's providing military tactics for dozens of attacks over the last few years from London to Malaysia. This is one dangerous dude. Okay. Shooter stands here. Let me see if he left me any casings. Lost an earring. Ben Darva's Persian. An Iraqi General's a strange house guest. Come on, Kensi, pick up. My boyfriend jokes, and he says that I shouldn't go out with two earrings because I always lose one of them, right? Sorry. That's him. Hey, Ivan. Hey, Kensi, you've got company? Yeah, yeah, that's right. Listen, Roth was shot at the house. Oh, my God, I totally think so, too. By Hassan Al-Jahiri, a former Iraqi General. I'm gonna send you his photo and information now. Oh, my God, that is hilarious. He is so right in my face. Jahiri's in the room. Kensi, Sit tight. I love you. Notice how I didn't tell him anything about losing an earring? - Do you have anything diet? - Fridge. Nope. No diet. Eric, bring up Kensi's phone. They're looking right at her. Tell me she hasn't been made, Sam. No. He's telling them to burn everything with blood on it. Why hasn't she been made? You were there yesterday. He must not have seen her, just me. Let's go. Eric, brief Hetty. Wait, shouldn't we send in SWAT? We're 15 minutes out, SWAT takes at least 20. Besides, we go in hot, it lowers her survival chances. We got to get through that door without a battering ram. Who are you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Fern. Nice to meet you. You still in the kitchen, Kensi? - Oh, hi, uncle Steve. - Hey. Well, is it... Fern or Kensi? It's Fern Kensi. Aubrey's my sponsor. Oh, oh, I wasn't supposed to say. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. No, no, it's okay. He knows about rehab. Well... I lost another earring. Pleasure to meet you. Bye. Both Darva and Jahiri went to Harvard. - They were roommates. - Look at this, look at this. From 1982. Iran and Iraq are at war with each other, Darva was attacked by some Iraqi students, and... Jahiri saved his life. And now Darva's returning the favor by giving him shelter. - What was that about? - Uncle Steve? He's my dad's cousin or something. He lives in the main house. You think that he shot Brian? Can you get off the property without being seen? Then go, and walk fast. - Yeah, but why? - Aubrey, just go. Are you kidding? Oh, give me a break. Guys, why is Kensi going back into the lion's den? - Because it's her job. - She got Aubrey to safety, now she's got to keep eyes on Jahiri. He's a high-level target. Oh, agent Blye. Have you found my daughter? Agent Blye? Agent Blye? Aubrey's been missing, Hassan. Aubrey is in her room. And this woman... is a liability. We've lost her. Where's Callen? Closing fast. What's this about? You can't do this. It's too late. You know he's going to kill me. Just like he killed the man who died in Aubrey's car. You've given him a safe place, and in return, he's been running a terrorist operation. No, Jahiri saved my life. I won't let them hurt you. - Good luck with that. - Hassan, please! Little league bombing in Guam... his plan. A list of his military exploits is on my phone... go check. Pretty big body count. I owed you, Hassan. But this? I'm gonna call the police. Ben. Thank you for the hospitality. Deeks, around back. Get off me! Get off me! I need to talk to your boss. Callen! Turn over! Oh, come on. What? You got some sort of superman double back flip where you can dodge bullets? I mean, you can't tell me I shouldn't have taken that shot. No. I'm glad you did. May I? Sure, Tim... just don't touch the doll. So, Sapphire spilled her guts. The break-in ring involved our dealer friends, couple of ex-con B&E guys, and Sapphire's club girls that she would use to keep the target "busy" at Balm while the crew would break in and Rob their house. That's pretty good PR for the PD on that bust. Even got a compliment from my boss. That makes you feel all gooey inside? Like a warm chocolate chip cookie. You one of those guys who needs external validation and coddling? Only from you, Sam. You want to coddle me? How's your stepdad? Uh, well, he just got out of surgery. He is still under from the anesthesia, - but they think he's going to be okay. - Good. You guys are close? Not really. I kind of got dumped on him after my mom died. What about your real dad? My mom said that she would tell me one day. You know, when I first met your stepfather... he worried about you like... like a real dad. I've spent a lot of time looking for my real dad... But... Ben's sort of... been that all along. Hasn't he? Bet you the first thing that he wants to see when he wakes up is you. Just so he knows you're okay. I haven't seen the bill, but if it's over five grand... Go easy on him. Why? The cops hate Deeks. He's a lousy liaison. That's not what you wanted him for. You do your homework, don't you? In choosing agents. Deeks didn't end up in this building because we needed some LAPD liaison. You've been watching him for a while. There is value in being patient. So, how long did you watch me before I joined NCIS? When did G. Callen become a blip on your radar? Was it Kiev? Houston? Bogota. Come on, don't tell me it was, uh, Jersey City? Peking. You mean, Beijing? Tea, Mr. Callen. It was Jersey City, wasn't it? Gulls are coming in. That means there's gonna be wicked swell on the bay by the morning. - You're a surfer, huh? - Yeah. Well, surf early. I'm sure Hetty told you we start at 9:30. Though... after your liaising today, I'm not sure why we'd have you back. Yeah, I'm not coming in tomorrow. LAPD op I been trying to set up for months... All the pieces finally came together about an hour ago. Going undercover tonight. For how long? I don't know, cover's pretty deep. Don't worry, Fern. I'll be back.
