Officer vehicle northbound on 101. Dark blue Tahoe 6A18 is code three. Requesting back up. DMV tag is 5 Zebra N for nora, 197. Two suspects in vehicle fleeing traffic stop.</i> 6827 responding, code three. Secondary. We're 6818.</i> Vehicle now heading west on Mulholland.</i> Pull up right behind him. Out of the car! Out of the car! Driver, show me your hands! Out of the car! - Your hands, get them up! - Show me your hands! Passenger, get out of the car. Put 'em up! Get 'em up! Passenger, get down on the... weapon! Get him, Pablo! All right, let's step in. Secure the vehicle! Secured! Stay with me, G. Don't do this to me. Come on! Come on, buddy. Here you go. Fat free? So... What is it this time, G? - Cold showers, bed bugs, fenghui? - Too noisy. Last place was too quiet. The place before that was too hot. No, no, no. That place was too cold. The place before that was too hot. You sure you're ready to come back? What, are you my mother or something? You could use one. Yeah. I got you. Thank you. - It's a new office, huh? - Yep. - What's it like? - Noisy. Three months and the neighbors still don't know we're here. Hiding in plainsight. What was it before we got it? Old water plant administration building. Condemned after the northridge quake. - Condemned? - Only on the outside, G. Coming through! Just put it on my desk. Voil√†. Got to go see you know who. Hetty, I gave you the receipts. If every agent came back from an undercover assignment with expenses unaccounted for, Mr. Hanna, I'd be either out of a job or out of pocket. I don't intend to be either. - What are we down to? - 15, 20 bucks? $61. And a nickel. You're a fantastic operations manager, Hetty. All right. I got you. $20. Yeah. $40. $60. Okay? Thank you. - I'll spot you the nickel. - Thank you. I'm good for it. Mr. Callen. You're not due back for a month. I missed your sunny smile, Hetty. We need to update your biometrics. New photos for drivers licenses, passports, general backstopping... Not to speak of documents, credit cards and so forth, and, um... Wardrobe. Problems with the neighbors? Something like that. Well, don't even think about unrolling... that disgusting thing in here. - I think she's mellowed. - I think I'm in love. Who's that? It's a new guy started this week. Green. - That's his name? - Nope. Heads up! Director's coming online. Hey, Callen. Eric. Well, it's about time. - Kensi. - Hello. My favorite agent. Oh, I thought you'd callously abandoned us to join the FBI. Uh, once was enough. You still making the weekend drive up to Pendleton? Of course. Home away from home. Well, that's what you get for growing up a marine brat. - Get a note from your doctor? - You're my doctor, Nate. Yeah, I just get to play around inside your head, though. How's the rest of you? Aches? Pains? Insomnia? Yeah, all of them. - Before I was shot. - Hi. Dominic. Callen. Nice to meet you, Dom. Agent Callen. I didn't think you were due back from sick leave till next month.</i> I guess you didn't get the email. I guess you haven't sent it yet. Your case is still active, Callen. - We will find them. - Yes, sir. We will. Here's the reason I'm calling. It's commander Frank Mcguire. Works the office of naval intelligence.</i> Or did, until two hours ago. He was kidnapped and subsequently killed in a shootout with lapd.</i> Routine traffic stop, his kidnappers sped off, lapd went after them.</i> - Mcguire got caught in the crossfire. - What do we know about the kidnappers? Mexican nationals. That's what's got us worried.</i> In less than 12 hours, there's going to be a coordinated military operation</i> on both sides of the mexican border against the drug cartels.</i> Operation Dakota. Mcguire had detailed knowledge of this plan.</i> We need to find out if it's been compromised.</i> Files' on its way, Eric. Keep me in the loop. Footage, Eric. Eric, slide it back. Hold it. Dom? What do you see? The second guy's been hit and he's trying to get back in the SUV. Okay. Why? Cover? Zoom and enhance, Eric. Passenger side window just exploded. Yeah, but that's not a surprise. Lots of incoming from the lapd. Tighter, Eric. Advance three frames. The window's blowing into the car, not out. Kidnapper fired the shot. Mcguire wasn't killed in the crossfire. He was executed. Okay, so you're a bad guy. You're surrounded by LAPD. You've seen the movies. You're going to shoot your way out. Only your buddy takes one in the chest and he's dead before he hits the ground. - I think I've seen that movie. - Now the cops are blamming away. Six cops, squeezinglks. That's a lead storm that's coming right at you. Definitely ain't no movie. - What do you do? - Al Pacino was in it. Might have been DeNiro. You pee your pants. You drop your weapon, you kiss the pavement. Okay? At least that's what I'd do. Instead, I go back to the car, execute the hostage, and die doing it. Now, why would you sacrifice yourself to kill your hostage? So he couldn't reveal what you were up to? Mcguire lives at 1041, apartment one. What are we? - If anyone asks? - We're city inspectors. No. Nobody talks to city inspectors. You're a realtor. I'm your client. You're showing me an apartment. - Do I look like a realtor? - Okay, I'm the realtor. You're the guy looking for the apartment. Okay? - Can we go? - Would I live in place like this? I mean, I don't even know if I could afford a place like this. Well, that's why i'm showing you. To see if, you know, you would want to live in a place like this. Does it have a jacuzzi? If it has, I'm going to drown you in it. Hi. This is Frank McGuire. Sorry I can't take your call right now.</i> Leave a message and I'll get right back with you.</i> Clear. Clear. Message bank deleted. Looks like someone didn't want us to hear Mcguire's messages. Eric? I need you to check a call. I'll run a check on Mcguire's phone log, see what we turn up. Mcguire graduated top 1% from the naval academy. Look at this. Stellar career. Specialized in satellite image analysis and spent time in the San Nicolas navy base. - Where is that? - 75 miles off the coast of L.A. It was discovered by spanish explorer Sebastian Vizcaino. He actually charted the entire california coast. And his ship was called the San Diego, which is where the bay gets its name, of course. I think it was back in... 1602? - I read a lot. - Reading's good. Found this on the coffee table. Like it mattered. "Emma fleet week san diego." Mcguire wasn't married. His birthday was two month ago. How long do you leave birthday cards on display? I don't know. I never got one. You've never gotten a single birthday card? Nope. What? It's not a big deal. I'm definitely getting you a birthday card this year. Great. You make sure you put some money in it. How about I put a personality in it? "Happy birthday to my favorite uncle. Love, Emma." Mystery solved. Mystery solved. No signs of struggle. Dead bolts on all the windows and doors. Must have snatched him off the street. Laptop's encrypted. It's a job for Eric. For a career navy guy, commander Mcguire wasn't very squared away. Unless he had something else on his mind. No jacuzzi. - Deal breaker? - Afraid so. There goes my commission. Gardner included in the lease? It is. Very safe. This navy guy... I looked at his apartment, and... He was kidnapped, murdered. Did you know him? Oh, every day he waves. I saw him this morning. He's dead? And already his apartment's available. Unbelievable. You might have been the last person to see him alive. No, he was with his friends. What if they were the ones that kidnapped him? No, no, they were his friends. They've been here before. I see their car... - The blue tahoe. - Blue tahoe? When? Every day this week. - Did you get the plates? - No, he was clean. Turns out it wasn't Mcguire's first trip in the tahoe. He knew them. They picked him up every morning this week, dropped him off three hours later. Sound like a kidnapping to you, Sam? It looks like a kidnapping, but it's not. - So why the hood and the nylon ties? - They don't want him to see where they're taking him, so they tie his hands so he's not tempted to lifthe hood and peek. It's common practice in the middle east. I've used the technique a few times myself. Now, Mcguire used to get to the office around 8:30 give or take five or ten minutes. But, as you can see, he was late every day this week. The gardener said they picked him up at 7:30. And three hours later they drop him back at home and then he goes to work. A lot you can do in three hours. Especially if you have top-secret security clearance. How much time do we have? Operation Dakota against the drug cartels kicks off in seven hours and 33 minutes. What about the call to Mcguire's apartment to erase his voice mail? I'm on it. - Finances? - Nothing out of the ordinary. - Travel? - Nothing in his name, or any of his nouns' credit cards. - Family, relatives? - Parents are deceased. He's got one sister... Helen Mcguire. Lives in west hollywood. Divorced, one kid. A girl... Emma. Photo at the apartment. Her favorite uncle. All right, enough with the look already. I'll go. And I will take our trained expert operational psychologist for backup. I love field work. Do I get to carry a gun? I don't think we're expecting a lot of trouble from a grieving family. Can I still carry a gun? Wear one of ose ankle holsters? - Maybe that would make me walk funny. - You already walk funny, Nate. Where are we with friends or lovers? There's one stand out... a guy. - Friend or lover? - I don't know. Not really the question that had jumped out at me. Informed guess. He's a six-foot, three 200 pound special forces. Paratrooper, guys. I'm leaning towards a friend. Good call, Dom. Got a hit on that phone number. Detail's coming up. Same phone number used to call in and erase Mcguire's voice mail, also called him 15 times in the last four days. Somebody's trying to cover their tracks. Distance themselves from the investigation. Who is he? Who made those calls? That's him. The special forces paratrooper guy. He runs a private security firm. Bobby J. Jenlow & Associates. What do the associates do? Anything Bobby J. Jenlow tells them to. No plates. Small world. Are you listening to me, Eddie? No, no! You listen to me. It's called standing up, okay? It's called standing up for your brothers. That's all I'm ask... Just do it... For me, Eddie. Just do it. You run pretty good. - Nice hand brake turn. - You gonna badge me? Make a difference if we do? Saw you going in. I didn't know who you were. So you cleared the phones remotely. Private conversations. - Every one. - Close? Since we were kids. It's got to hurt knowing one of your close buddies is betraying his country. - He was kidnapped. He was no traitor. You guys don't know anything. We know he wasn't kidnapped. We know he's been working with them for the better part of a week. We know he was shot to shut him up. - What do you know, Bobby? - Nothing. You're special ops. It's funny how we all know just by looking. Me, I was a seal. Planning a little hunting party, Bobby? We're done. Jenlow compromised the operation against the cartels. Putting together a team to go after them. Retribution. - How long do we have? - Not long. I sent everyone home. All my friends. I wanted to be alone. When did you last see your brother? Thank you. The weekend. Frank, took... Took Emma to the farmer's market. He was always taking her someplace. The beach, the movies. After we divorced, Emma's father, moved overseas. So Frank became the man in her life. Did you speak to your brother at all on the phone this week? No. Did he mention he was worried about something? Nothing. Everything was normal. And then... - Will you excuse me? - Sure. You know, you can tell a lot about people from their fridge? And not just what's on the inside. Outside tells a story, too. - She's grieving. - Yes, she is. Which is normal considering the circumstances. - Absolutely. - So what? Tell me. She's on edge. Answering way too quickly. Particularly to direct questions requiring a simple yes or no. And mostly she's saying no. Kensi... Everything that woman just told us was a lie. Mr. Callen. A moment? You want some backup? Your hand. Eye. Car. Blue'07 impala. Modified the engine, upgraded the brakes, transmission, suspension. Fitted with 19-inch wheels. And latest smart technology. Three-G network with two four megapixel cameras, updated microphone, 32 giga flash drive, wi-fi, bluetooth, mini-usb slot and of course... GPS! And it's encrypted. And so please don't forget your pin this time. Let's go. Now wardrobe for your undercover work. I know you grew up in the well-meaning but cold embrace of the welfare state, Mr. Callen. But just because you're an orphan, doesn't mean you have to dress like... Oliver Twist. Now, we need something modern, individual... That speaks to the man within. That's not for you to admire. It's for you to try on. Here. And here. And... here. - This or this? - Those. A fitted boot jean, medium weight, distressed denim. I think... we need something more relaxed, Mr. Callen. Something amuses you? Oh, it's just that in three years, you've never called me G. Well, it's not a name. It's a letter. Now if you were to tell me what the "g" stands for... No one ever told me. Tell me that's good news, Eric. That's good news. And that is commander Mcguire's laptop. - You got in? - I got in. Me and about a hundred- thousand other zombie computers. I hacked into an illegal botnet system and redirected the computing power into cracking the encryption. Couple of minutes, and we'll get to peek inside all of Mcguire's dirty little secrets. All right, guys, Nate thinks Mcguire's sister's lying to us that she knew what her brother was doing. But I think there's something else. It's like the kind of raw emotion that you see in someone when the nightmare's still unfolding. Like it was still happening to her. Same time every morning, they pick him up, cover his face and take him somewhere. So why would someone betray their country? Ideology... greed. Love. Oh, my god, it's her. - Mcguire's sister? - No, his niece. Eric, buddiesbook entry for Emma Mcguire, west hollywood! Coming in five. She said she wanted to be alone. Callen, her daughter wasn't even with her. All right, here we go. Emma's been sending messages to her friends every single day. - And then come this week... - No messages. Nothing. She hasn't logged on for four days. So, whatever they've been getting Mcguire to do, this is how they've been forcing him to do it. This is why she's still living it. It's still happening. They have her daughter. Coming in three... two... one. Bingo. We just opened four encrypted emails sent to Mcguire's laptop over the last four days. Sequential time code is within an hour of the download. They were dialing direct from one of our own defense satellites. Mcguire downlinks the satellite images to the main computer, and then secretly e-mails them to his own laptop. Recording everything they were making him steal. There's the San Diego bay. Army bases, border crossing. Border security. - Eric, get me vance. - Got it. How did the drug cartels find out Mcguire even had those access? It was a joint military operation, so the leak probably came from south of the border. Cartel sets up a satellite uplink, kidnaps his niece Emma, who's still missing. Knowing that he'll do anything they ask and not tell anyone. - He did tell someone. Bobby Jenlow. He's gonna try to rescue her. Probably gave Mcguire a GPS locator. - Gotta find Jenlow, Eric. - I'm already on it. Director's online. - What do you got? - Operation Dakota's been compromised. Mexican drug cartel forced Mcguire to access one of our satellites. Forced? Kidnapped his niece. She's still missing. It's too late to stop dakota Gotta find out which cartel. We'll hit them first.</i> And you have... less than four hours.</i> Callen... The girl is a priority. Jenlow's cell phone is on. And I got him. - Hollywood hills. - Kensi, Mcguire's sister. - You know. - We put the pieces together. - I'm sorry, Helen. - Come in. I wanted to tell you, but Bobby wouldn't let me. He's going up there to bring her back. - When? - Now. Sam, it's me. I'm with Helen Mcguire. - Bobby Jenlow's on his way in. - Copy that. First turn off viewpoint road. Got it. All right, we're ten minutes out. Transmitting. - Stand by... - Picture's up. He's gonna get another ticket. Have they contacted you? - No. - OK, if they do, I want you to keep talking to them so that we can trace the call, okay? They were at the market. One minute Emma was standing right next to him, Frank turned around and she was just... gone. - How do they contact him? - Cell phone, couple of minutes after she disappeared. They told him what they wanted him to do. He agreed. Have they let you speak to her? No. Bobby gave Franck a GPS transmitter. Frank put it in the cartel's house. He gave up his life for my daughter. Turn's up ahead, Sam. - You feeling lucky? - After last time? Not particularly. Here we go. That's not Jenlow. Look out! Callen. It's okay, Bobby. Emma. Get Emma. Eric, ambulance. Sam and I are fine. She's not here. Find her. Please just... just find her. Any ID on our two amigos? All cashed up, no ID. The car had a GPS system tracking system. - Previous destinations. - There's two with repeat journeys. This one and one in Malibu. Hey, Eric. Give me everything you got on 1727 pacific coast <i>highway, Malibu.</i> Okay. House is owned by <i>PPZ Investments.</i> It's a trust, which in turn is owned by a guy named... Manny Cortez. "Mad" Manny Cortez It doesn't describe him as "mad" in the SEC filing, but if you say so. We found our cartel. Who's Manny Cortez? Just a mass-murdering drug lord with a classic oedipus complex. Last bit's an educated guess. I'd have to talk to him to be certain. Manny and his father ran one of the largest drug cartels in Mexico. And now it's just him. - What happed his father? - According to legend, Manny cut off his toes with a pair of bolt cutters. Then his fingers. Then some other... Bits. Cool. Helen, I'm sorry. Emma wasn't at the house. Bobby? He's on his way to the ER. Gunshot wound, but I think he's going gonna be okay. Hello? It's Luis. Any news? It's my ex. Emma's dad. Hello, Luis. There's no news. - Emma's still... - Helen, what about Emma? Please, you just need to tell me what's happening.</i> Luis, I... Excuse me. Could you? - Mr. Perez? - Who is this? Special agent Kensi Blye, NCIS. Oh, geez. I just have to reassure you that we are doing everything we can to get your little girl back. Helen didn't tell me until this morning.</i> I'm booked on the next flight out of london.</i> You promise me you'll do everything to find her.</i> Everything, you hear me? - Yes, sir, I hear you. - Thank you. Emma adores her father. He only just gets back to town couple of times a year. We were planning on having thanksgiving together. What do you think it'd take to storm that place? - A week's planning and a small army. - Could be too late, G. Nate, the girl... you think she's still alive? The moment Mcguire was killed, she became a liability. Now, psychologically... the fact that she's a child makes the decision harder, but... Eventually, self-interest usually wins through. If she's still alive, she's running out of time. We need a plan. Okay, we could send in a tactical team. We'd need an hour to get them together. We don't have an hour. Utility company, city engineer... food delivery. No, if Manny Cortez is really there, the only way he's gonna invite us in is if he thinks there's money in it. "Trade... ei id quod cupit." - What was that, greek? - Latin. "Give them what they want." Very good, Dominic. Though your declinaision needs a little work. The pronoun is... masculine singular... "Give him what he wants." So, what does this toe-cutter... want? Satellite access, 24/7. - Did you make the call, nate? - Yeah. He's expecting you. - Yeah? What do you want? - Want to do business. What sort of business? Satellite business. Game time. Okay, man. I'm good. No problem. - Who are you? - Frank Hanley. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer needs a bodyguard? Oh, the big guy. Big guy's actually my client. Works in the defense department. Civilian analyst. Actually, he just worked with a former business partner of yours. Naval Commander... Named Mcguire? - Never heard of him. - Really? Well, maybe you've heard of his niece? Her name is Emma. Mcguire shared some information with my client. In less than three hours, operation dakota begins. In less than one hour, my client can have you back online real-time, satellite imagery, the mexican border. 24/7. And how can your client do this? It's a simple phone call. Pictures are coming up. Guys, that's not Manny Cortez. Then who is it? I don't believe you. Daddy. Daddy! Hey! Is that who I think it is? Kensi. The father's behind this. Emma's with him. Nate, he called here. He knows... Luis knows we're NCIS. Operation's compromised. He knows. We have to do something. When can I call mommy? Tomorrow, I promise. Now, daddy's busy. Why don't you go have your swim and I'll join you soon, okay? Give me a kiss. Bye-bye. We all live a lie. Some are bigger lie than others. I spoke to one of your colleagues on the phone. A distraught father. She was NCIS. I assume you are, too? How long you been working for Manny Cortez? Seven, eight years. A double life. You were Mcguire's brother-in-law. He never thought I was good enough for his sister. Yeah, he was right. You set him up to believe that his niece was kidnapped. She was. But by her father. And she's not going back. Yeah, he's right here. It's Mcguire. He's not really dead. - Thanks, dom. - You're welcome. Kensi... Give her the phone. Hello. It's for you. - Hello. - Baby! Oh, baby... Hi, mommy. When can I come home? I want to come home. You can come home right now. - I miss you. - I miss you, too. Sweetheart, I love you so much. I love you too, mom. Expense accounts. You're six months behind. I would have thought that seeing as you had so much time off for recuperation, you would have caught up on your paperwork. Tell me you're kidding me. Well, I could... but it would be a lie. No, rush. Tomorrow will be fine. Night. Night, Dom, Kensi, Nate. Sofa's free at my place. Noisy. - Good night, G. - Good night.
