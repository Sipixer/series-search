But this is my gig. This is where I play. My name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk. Honey, I'm sorry. And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her a throne and a crown? And, like, a gold stick with a ball on top? Terry is a jerk! That's why we always say, "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.

Doctor, can I see you for just a moment? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. Did you tell him about my squirt gun idea?

Okay, the mole came off. What are we gonna do? We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. - Flip for the baby? - You got a better idea? All right, call it in the air. Heads. Heads, it is.

I thought you might be cold. Thank you. Look at you! You did pretty well. $8.27. But not really, because I put in the first two. Just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better. Do you? You know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me. I don't know, when I sang "Su-su-suicide"... ...I got, like, $ 1.75. But then "Smelly Cat"? I got 25 cents and a condom. So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat". Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat". I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh! But it's not even that, you know? I used to do my songs because it made me happy. Now it's just all about the money, you know? Well, people missed you in there. In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat". Really? From who? Well, me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency. - Here you go. - Thanks a lot. Hey, Christine! I got it! I want to thank you for being there for me. And I'm sorry I almost broke your hand. That's okay. I'm sorry I poisoned you. Remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand? Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? What about the time I hit you in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin? Remember when I stuck that broom in your spokes... ...and you hit your head on the curb? But I remember people telling me about it. I hope Ben has a little sister. And I hope she can kick his ass. I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid. How about the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken? That was you? They were infected. He wouldn't have made it. My little nephew. Come here, little one! There's my little baby, Ben! Hey, he's not crying! Hey, he's not crying! There's still pie! I'm here. I'm here. How's my little boy? You want Daddy to change your diaper? I know, I know. Did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today? He rode the bus today. Big boy riding the bus... Hey, I have a question. How come it says, "Property of Human Services"? You are gonna love this. Can you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here. Stay back! I've got kiwi! Run, Joey, run! {y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat {y:i}What are they feeding you? No, no. I'm sorry, it's: {y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat {y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat Better! Much better. Good. Don't feel bad, because it's a hard song. - You want to try it again? - From the top? There is no "top", all right? That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat". Why don't you just follow me. {y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat {y:i}What are they feeding you?
