The plane could leave early! In London, there could be a line at customs! Come on! Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica. Passport, check. Camera, check. Traveler's checks, check. -Who are you saying "check" to? -Myself. For remembering to pack a thing. You do a good thing, you get a "check. " Mom does it. I never realized it was weird. My mom used to put her head in the oven. Actually, only the one time. But it's pretty weird. Are you ready yet? -Got the tickets? -Right here. Check! It's all London, baby! Here we go. Got your passport? Third drawer of my dresser. You don't want to lose that! There it is! The One With Ross' Wedding - Part I Subtitles and Rip by .:staz:. (staz@post. cz) The vacuum's in my closet on the left side. Garbage bags are next to the refrigerator. Rachel's gonna be here. Can't I just ask her? Yeah, okay. Give that a try! -Let's do it. -Cheerio! London, baby! That's not gonna get annoying. London, baby! You know what? I was wrong. We're all here. Let's get going! I want to go over and hug you... ... and wish you luck, but I can't get up. -I'll come hug you. -Great, can you bring me the paper? -Have a great wedding. -Thanks. Chandler, I want to hug you too! You might as well bring my book from your apartment. -So we're off. -Have fun! -I can't believe you won't be there. -I know. Come. Why don't you come? To London. Please? It would mean so much to me. I gotta work. I'm sorry. Why can't you take a couple of days off? Because I can't. I told you. This is my wedding. Now we are late. Let's go, let's go! Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back. Here you go, Phoebe! Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la! You! Let's go! Bye, Pheebs! London, baby! Oh, God! Do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything. Chandler, do something! -Do something! -I am. I'm ignoring you. I'll be the on-camera guy. All right. First stop... ... Westminster Abbey. What is that? That's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. We want to go-- I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map. If you see a little version of me in there, kill it! I got it. Here we go! We're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we? Man, you made me lose it! That was all before 10:00. The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken Kiev, not Tarragon. Then the florist said there are no tulips. And the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome-- Emily, honey. Okay? Well, up yours too! -No! That's "time out. " -Sorry. Sweetie, relax. Everything will be great, okay? Come on, come on. Chicken Kiev? Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute? Salmon would be more elegant than chicken. And you wouldn't worry about the salmonella. I can't wait to see where you're getting married. It's beautiful. Her parents got married here. I can't believe they're tearing it down. It's really the most lovely building. It's over-- Oh, my God! It's nice. Oh, my God! What are we going to do? Everything's gonna be all right. How's it gonna be all right? I see that. I talked to a guy, and I found out what happened. They tore it down early. All right! Westminster Abbey. Hands down, best abbey I ever seen. What do you think of the Abbey? It's great! They're thinking of changing the name. -To what? -To "Put the Camera Away" ! Man, you are Westminster Crabby. -Don't get up. What do you need? -Nothing. Come on. I'm here to take care of you. Okay, I have a wedgie. That is all you. What do you want for lunch? I don't know. I guess we have to eat. Yeah, I do. What's the matter? I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross. I wish I didn't lie about work. He seemed so mad at me. Don't be so hard on yourself. If I was still in love with some-- Still in love with? I'm not in love with Ross. Good! Yeah, me neither. I'm not at the wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend... ... and that would be uncomfortable. Not because I'm in love with him. I like Ross as much as anyone. Clearly, I have feelings for him, but they don't mean love. I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross? Yeah! I have continuing feelings of love. But that doesn't mean I'm still in love with him. I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him. Oh, my God! Why didn't you tell me? -We thought you knew! -We? We all know. We talk about it all the time. You all know? Does Ross know? No! Ross doesn't know anything. And you didn't tell me! We thought you knew. It's so obvious! It would be like telling Monica: "Hey, you like things clean. " What are you in the market for? Scarves, souvenir post cards.... Check this out! That's the stuff! What do you think? I won't need that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore. Well, I like it. Here you go. You're not really buying that. Haven't you embarrassed me enough? Oh, I embarrass you? How can I answer when I'm pretending I don't know you? He's just jealous. All Londoners wear them. Really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one? They're all tourists. If you insist on wearing that in public... ... you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself. If you make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat. -Good choice. -Thanks. That's it! I'm out of here. I won't be embarrassed anymore. I spoke to your dad, and you know what? He thinks we can find a new hall. -We don't have to. -You found a place? No, but Monica and I were talking... ... and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down... ... she suggested we put the wedding off for a bit. She said what? If I won't be happy with somewhere we'd find in a day... ... we should postpone it. Postpone it. Do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends... ... that people took time out of their lives... ... to fly thousands of miles to be here? This isn't right. I realize that people are gonna be disappointed. But I'm sure they'll come back. I can't ask people to do that. Would you? Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice. Anywhere half-decent will have been booked. Don't you understand? This is our wedding! Postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married. -You're saying it's now or never? -I'm saying it's now. -Or? -There's no "or" in mine! What is wrong with these pants? It's not the pants. It's you who's backwards. If you don't understand how important this is to me... ... perhaps we shouldn't marry at all! Emily, no! Wait, stop! Emily, please-- Did shopping help you feel any better? Manhattan doesn't have enough stores. I can help you get over him. You can? I need you to bring me photos of Ross... ... and a small piece of chocolate... ... and a glass of tepid water. Is this where you throw stuff... ... in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree? Only if you have the hiccups too. The chocolate and water are for me. I didn't feel like getting up. I'll show you a picture of Ross. And you remember all the bad things about him. -Focus on his flaws. -I can do that. I did that while we were going out. Before we start, I want to say, for the record, I love Ross. He's such a great guy. Close your eyes. Imagine that you're with Ross. Imagine that you're kissing him. You're running your hands all over his body. You run your hands through his hair but-- Gross! It's some kind of grease. I don't know. His hair never bothered me that much. It was more crunchy than it was greasy. This will be harder than I thought. Let's try some aversion therapy. Look at the picture. How do you feel now? Well, I like you less. Sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said you were embarrassing me. That wasn't cool. If it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day. Me too. -Yeah? -No! I had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Tell my friend you like my hat. -What's your friend's name? -Chandler. Hi, Chandler. That's-- That's Fergie, baby! Joey says you don 't like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing. When did you--? How? I was trying to get to Buckingham Palace. So I'm in my map and-- I understand you had a talk with Emily. Yes, I did. And you are welcome. Am l? Was it your idea to postpone the wedding? -I'm going to the bathroom. -Wait up! Since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle: What do you do when the bride says she doesn't want the wedding at all? She said that? Why? I don't know. I said it was stupid to put off the wedding... ... and she, like, flipped out. Oh, my God! You're even dumber than I am. Excuse me? How long have you been planning this wedding? I don't know. A month? Emily's probably been planning it since she was 5. Ever since the first time she hung a pillowcase from her head. That's what we did. We dreamed about the perfect wedding. In the perfect place. With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake. With the little people on top. But the most important part... ... is that we had the perfect guy... ... who understood just how important all that stuff was. I had no idea. That pillowcase thing, I thought you were doing The Flying Nun. Sometimes we were. Come on. Help me figure out what to do. Pretty intense, huh? I hope Ross didn't think we left because we were uncomfortable here. I hope he did. Pheebs, it's Joey. Hey, Joey! I saw someone that looks just like you on the subway. I was going to say hi, then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you. That just cost me 4 bucks. I called to see how the chick and the duck are doing. They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe. Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful. So do you miss me? Kind of, but I've been having too much fun. You're not homesick yet? I don't think so. Well, the seven of us miss you. -Who's seven? -Me, Rachel... ... the birds, the babies. The babies miss me? Pizza guy's here! You ordered pizza without me? But we were thinking about you. We ordered the Joey Special. Two pizzas? -Gotta go! Talk to you later. -Wait! Where did you get it from? And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Your troubles are all the same You want to be Where everybody knows your name Why have you brought me here? You'll see. This wedding won't happen. Ross. But imagine a lot more lights... ... and fewer bricks... ... and flowers and candles. And the musicians can go over here. The chairs can face this way and-- You go. But if you don't love this, we'll do it any other place or time. Really, it's fine. Whatever you want. It's perfect. And, I don't know, if it rains-- Then we'll get wet. I don't even have a date. Do you remember where the duck food is? In the guys' apartment, under the sink. Why? Because I'm going to London. What? What do you mean? I have to tell Ross I love him. Take care and don't have the babies till I get back. You can't go. Ross loves Emily. I know, but I have to tell him how I feel. He deserves all the information to make an informed decision. You're going because you hope he'll say: "I love you too. Forget the British chippy. " You think he will? No, because he's in love with the British chippy! You're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding. It's too late! You missed your chance. I'm sorry. This must be hard. But it's over. No, it's not over until someone says, "I do. "
