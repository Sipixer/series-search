Okay, well tonight's the big night. - Yeah! - Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her? It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose. - Ohh¡¦ - That sounds perfect! Yeah. You're gonna mess it up let me do it. I'm not gonna mess it up. If she says no, can I have the ring? She's not gonna say no. If! - Hey! - Hey! Hi Monica. Give me it! It's gone. Phoebe! Hey! Hi Monica. We're practically kissing. - Hey! - Hey! Hey Rach!

Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. What's the big deal? I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going. Where are you going? How about you guys? Open bar? I think so. I can do that for the kids. Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.

Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids. I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp? to be a counselor! Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going? Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that! Do you really see this as a long- term thing? I don't know. Y'know, you are 12 years older than her. Wait a minute, does- does everyone feel this way? Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry. Uh- uh? Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you! That's not what she said last night. See? Now, he could date her. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves? It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck! Yeah, yeah you have the ring?

No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair? Uh, wh- why? No! It's nice! Nice to see you Rachel. Oh, hi! So glad you brought someone. Someone? I brought people. - Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department. - Oh, hi. And I also brought my friend Joey¡¦ Oh!! Shrimp toast! Well, y'know I- I don't know where he is. Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel. Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris. Ohh, nice choice. Yeah. Good luck. Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars. Shut the door! Shut the door!! What's- what's going on? The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us. Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building! No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it! Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same¡¦ Who drank all the Kamikazes? Nobody! We put them in here! You want some? No! Okay! Okay!

It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2, 300. Ugh! So close! - Hey you guys! Look! - Hey! I got me some drinks! What are you doing? Open bar! And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22- foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20, 000! I won! That was my guess! What? What? What? I guessed 20, 000! Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy! What? I don't have 20, 000! Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!! Joey! Sit down! Forget her! You enjoy this!! What are you doing? One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here. Are you okay? Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything? are you? Are you perrr- perfect? Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually? I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket? Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you sure you're okay? Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you. Ohh that's sweet! Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with¡¦ Oh my God! I know, but just let me say it. Oh my God, Richard. What? I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard! Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard! - Monica! Chandler! - Hey- hey, hey! I don't know why I did that! Hey, it's good to see you! You too, you let uh, your hair grow long. Yeah? Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back. Well, my nose got lonely. And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable. Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date. Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again. Chandler, wh- why don't we sit down? Yeah, I'll sit down. It's good to see you. You're table's ready sir. Oh. Good to see you guys. Yes. Or if you prefer, this table is available. That might be fun. &nbsp What were you thinking? I didn't know it was an auction! Wh? I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat! Why would a charity give away a free boat? I don't know! - Charity? - Ugh! Well, just buy the damn boat! Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink? I'm just helping the kids! How is you drinking helping the kids? Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. Mr. Tribbiani. Oh hi! Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. Just out of curiosity, how- how much is that boat worth? I think it was valued at 19, 000 Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money. Joey! Joey, good one! That's good. Very good! So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now. Hey! You¡¦can't¡¦leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right? That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me! Well, what am I gonna do Rach? I don't have that kind of money! I know. Okay, okay, okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference. - Okay. - Okay. Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine! Not great. And so, we're hiding in the bathroom. And- and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in. So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor. Oh my God! I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. &nbsp It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed." Ohh. What? &nbsp Oh my God, you guys!! Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! Who? Richard! A- ohh! Ohh. I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. Oh Ross, sometimes grown- ups have commitments they just can't get out of! Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby- sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do. Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff. Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm- I'm 12 years older than she is. If the school finds out you're fired. Hmm. She's leaving for three months. For camp! Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's- she's sweet and pretty and¡¦ Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is,"Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you? No! No! I¡¦didn't do that. It's just¡¦ Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her. Okay well I think¡¦that's your answer. I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part. Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year! Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one. Oh great! - Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. - Oh, okay. Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip? It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? That was me. Oh, en chante. Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? That's me. Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18, 000. You- you have to pay that! It's not just a guess. Okay. Okay. I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me. Are you kidding me? She's gonna this boat! Y- Yeah! What- what is your wife's name? It's Pam. Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this,"The Pam." Aw- awww! I don't think she'd like that. Okay, uh- uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont." I don't think so dear. Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h? arms! You- you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can? ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy. What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!! No way! It's mine!! What? What? All that stuff you just said? I want that! But Joey you don't have $20, 000! Who cares? I- I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!! Oh my God, you're back! Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! Why do you want to see my hand? - I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash. - Yeah. Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out. Okay. What did you guys just do? What happened? Richard was there so I couldn't do it! What? Noooo¡¦ I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and- and surprise her, but now you've ruined it! We didn't ruin it! Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands? Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor¡¦ - Glove salesman! - Good one! Yeah. This is terrible. What am I going to do? Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track. That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that- that you're scared of commitment! I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice. Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes! That guy's still doing that? Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!! No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!! Wow! I have never had such a healthy break- up! She was such a grown- up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake? Ross! Wait! Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about¡¦ You suck!! What? Okay, break- up's still on! Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married? Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before. - Hi guys! - Hey! - Hey! What are you up too? Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. Yeah, Big Brother. Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet. Yeah, well¡¦ Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? Why? To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world! Eh¡¦ Okay well that's good to know. The Mr. Bowmont's here!!! Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in? Sure, I love this part! Come on in. Hi! Richard! Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef. Ohh¡¦ Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up? Well, it was great seeing you the other night. Oh, good to see you too.
