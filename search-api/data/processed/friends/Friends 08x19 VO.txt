Who knows what l'd say now? lf only there was something in your head to control what you say. Come on, you'll keep it in check this time. The publicity would be good for you.

The One With Joey's lnterview -Thanks for taking the time for this. -Not at all. Happy to do it. You think we're being obvious? No. We're just four people with neck problems, who talk like this. lt's great that we met here. When people hear the magazine's paying, they want a big, fancy restaurant. Actually, l didn't know the magazine was paying. Wouldn't have mattered. l do this for the fans, not the free food. -Can l get you anything? -Coffee. And l'll have all the muffins. -Hey. -We're not talking. Oh, finally. According to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work. Anything that you're particularly proud of? All you want is a dingle What you envy's a shwang A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with, or simply let hang This ever happen? You want a glass of milk... ...but these darn cartons are so hard to open! Boy, you said it, Mike. -There's gotta be a better way! -There is, Kevin! This is the first time he's ever used this. It's easy. -This works in any milk carton. -It is easy. Now I can have milk every day. So this is it, Victor? Yeah, l guess it is.

There l am. There are so many things, it's hard to pick just one. l'm getting coffee. Want anything? -A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea. -Double latte. -A bagel with only-- -l was just being polite. How about when you're not working? What do you do in your spare time? Look at this clown. He thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way, jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway? That is the Coast Guard. What are they doing out here? The coast is way over there! This is unbelievable. Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes. Dude, are you trying to kill me? Well, l see you've had a very productive day. -lsn't the cowboy hat a little much? -Come on, it's fun! All right. lsn't this a woman's hat? Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea.

Free porn! We have free porn here! ln my spare time, l read to the blind. And l'm also a mento for kids. -A mento? -You know, a mento. A role model. -A mento? -Right. -Like the candy? -As a matter of fact, l do. Our readers always want to know how soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have a fitness regime? We stars usually just try to eat right and get lots of exercise. You know we've thrown this without dropping it for an hour? Are you serious? l realized it a half-hour ago, but l didn't want to jinx it. -Wow, we are pretty good at this. -Yeah. Hey, we totally forgot about lunch. That's the first time l've ever missed a meal. My pants are a little loose. What's wrong with you? l got this blinding pain in my stomach when l was lifting weights. And then l passed out. l haven't been able to stand up since. But l don't think it's serious. Sounds like a hernia. Go to the doctor. No way! lf l go to the doctor, it's for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why'd l have to start working out again? Damn you, fifteens! -What is it? -A trifle. lt has layers. A layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam. Then custard, which l made from scratch. Raspberries, more ladyfingers, beef saut√©ed with peas and onions. Then a little bit more custard. lt tastes like feet. l like it. -Are you kidding? -What's not to like? Custard, good. Jam, good. Meat, good! Well, you don't look good, Joe. Well, the fridge broke, so l had to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes. Hey, what was in that brown jar? -That's still in there? -Not anymore. This piece doesn't have floor on it. -Stick to your side. -Hey, come on, now. All right, what are we having? l don't believe in these crazy diets. Just everything in moderation. Your muffins. l'll take those to go. For the kids. l know what l wanted to ask. They killed you off years ago. What happened there? l said some stuff in an interview l shouldn't have said. -But that is not gonna happen today. -Understood. -So, what'd you say back then? -l said that l-- -Hey, Joey! -How you doing?
