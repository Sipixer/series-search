Ross is getting married. Phoebe's making people. -Everybody's doing stuff. -We just sit here. If I died, people would know I was here... ... only by the ass print on this chair! We have to do something. Something huge! We could climb Mt. Everest. Not something stupid. Something huge! I saw an ad for this video. People climb that thing every day. We could totally do that! Why not? I mean, it's just climbing. It's just steep! We're going! It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest. What's up? -We're gonna climb Mt. Everest. -Yeah, baby! I looked into that. Yeah, but it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die. And you would die. We could get that Everest video. We could do that without risking our lives at all. While we're at the video store, we could rent Die Hard! I just remembered. That Everest thing is only available through mail order. So you'll stay here and hang out with me? But one of these days... ... we'll get off our butts and rent Die Hard again! The One with the lnvitation Subtitles and Rip by .:staz:. (staz@post. cz) So does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not? Oh, God! Nobody likes him. He's so cheap. He'd never fly to London in a million years. Invite him! Did I do these neat enough? Yeah, they're fine. We'll say that Ben addressed them. You invited Rachel then? Sure, why not? Really? I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there. Do you think we shouldn't invite her? You know I absolutely adore Rachel. It's just that I thought it might be awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. -More tea? -Sure. Earl Grey? Fine, invite whoever you want. I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again. And I just want a million dollars! Oh God, Monica. Thank God! This is Rachel. Another Lincoln High survivor. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey. -Do you remember Ross? -Sure. Back in high school... ... I had a major crush on you. I knew. You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother. I did. Listen, do you think-- Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor. Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime? Maybe. Okay, maybe I will. See, I see... ... big passion in your future. -Really? -I do. Ross, you're so great. It's never gonna happen. I have a question. Actually, it's not so much a question. It's more of a general wondering... ... ment. Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.... That's right. Look! What? Top of the world looking Down on creation And the only explanation I can find Listen, missy! lf you want this cart, you'll have to take me with it! -Did you see that? -You were incredible! A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen. I could not have done this without you. More clothes in the dryer? I'm fine. You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me. I was doing great with Julie before I found out. I was doing great too. It's not easy for me to see you with Julie. I don't need this right now. It's too late. I'm with somebody else. This ship has sailed! All right, fine! Go ahead and do that. I don't need your stupid ship! This is the first time I'm doing something I care about. I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. If you don't get that-- I get that, but I'm tired of your answering machine. I don't know what to do. Neither do l! Is this about Mark? Oh, my God! Okay, it's not. I can't keep having this same fight over and over again. You're making this too hard! I am? What do you want me to do? I don't know. Look, maybe we should just take a break. You're right. Let's cool off. Let's get some frozen yogurt or something. A break from us. -Why are we rushing? -The girlfriend I told you about. She wants to get back together with me. I found it! That's so great for you guys! -Good luck with your girlfriend. -Thank you. -You got my message? -You are right on time. Can I be your girlfriend again? You can very much. I want you to leave. Get out! I want to talk about this. All right, how was she? Was she good? Don't answer! You wanted to talk about it. How was she? She was.... -She was not good, not good. -Nothing compared to you. She was different. Good different? Nobody likes change. Just stop! The way you owned up to everything. It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know? I mean, my mom never thought this would work out. She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater. " I just wish we hadn't lost those four months. But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective. We were on a break! You seem to really like her. What do I do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing. No commitment. That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends... ... asking to hear stories about you... ... Iooking through Monica's photo albums. You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks. You think? You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport. And you're sitting here in a hallway... ... with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. You're right. This is so amazing! My brother's getting married and in London! It's so romantic. Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper. You're at the wedding. You have to cry. Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation. Isn't this adorable? Ross let Ben address mine. Did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding? Don't worry, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him. I'm so jealous you're all going. I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester. I didn't, either. I knew that. So I didn't know that. But you should see your faces. What's up? Just hanging out. What's this? Ross' wedding invitation? Maybe that's the one we should have hidden. No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that. I'm happy for him. I am. I really-- I'll work on it. I'm sorry. You're going to come, though, aren't you? I don't know. This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"? Because I already bought my ticket. You know what would be real weird? lf you weren't there. -Just say you'll think about it. -I'll think about it. Who's this from? That's Ross' . Oh, my God! He remembered. Remembered what? It was months ago. We were walking by this antique store. I saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had... ... when I was a little girl. I can't believe he remembered! This must've cost a fortune. I can't believe he did this. Remember when he fell in love with Carol... ... and got her that expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? Oh, my God! Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving. Oh, my God! -We were in school together. -We haven't seen each other since. I land in China. Guess who's in charge of the dig? Julie! Isn't that great? Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? That is so sweet! No, you hang up. No, you-- One, two, three. You didn't hang up! She didn't hang up either. No, you hang up. You! Ross, hi. It's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that everything's fine. And I'm really happy for you... ... and your cat. Obviously, I am over you. I am over you. And that, my friend, is what they call closure. I got a message from you. Oh, my God! Hang up the phone! Give me the phone! You're over me? Oh, God. You're over me? When were you... ... under me? Basically... ... Iately, I've.... I've sort of had feelings for you. I need to lie down. He broke up with Julie! Go hug her, for God's sakes! Really? It's always been you, Rach. Oh, God. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight. That's okay. You're worth the wait. And I don't just mean tonight. Oh, God! Honey. That's okay. No, you just rolled over the juice box. Did you say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place? I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to? You ended it! Because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you. You still love me? What does this mean? Do you want to get back together? Maybe. I don't know. I just, I feel.... I can't believe I even thought of getting back together. We're so over! Fine by me! And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common. It doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal. I knew it! Rachel's coming up. Doesn 't she look pretty? Oh, my God! This is us getting ready for the prom. We don't have to watch this. Yeah, we do! Come on! -Get a shot of Monica. -How do you zoom out? There she is! Shut up! The camera adds 10 pounds. So how many cameras are actually on you? Dad, turn it off! It is off. Right, Ross? Looking good, Mr. Kotter! I can 't go to my prom without a date. It's too late. If you're not going, then I don 't want to go either. I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom. We've seen enough. Let's turn it off. -I want to see! -Fine, I'm not going to watch. Come on, kid. Let's go. Are you handsome! Let's show them! -Okay, Dad. -Rachel, ready or not. Here comes your knight in shining-- Oh, dear! How do I turn this off? I can't believe you did that. See? He's her lobster! You're really not going? It's just going to be too hard. You know, I mean... ... it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? It's just for the best. You know? It is. Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe. She's going to be pretty big by then. She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes. Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor. You don't have a car. And your license expired. There's so much to do, and I have so little time! Check this out. There's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums. "It's almost as good as being there. " It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear. You could, but just the one time. We could get videos of the sights... ... get a vCR in our hotel room and never have to go outside! If we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard. I bet the British version is good! Hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! In London, there could be a line at customs! Come on! London might have gotten started... ... because we needed to take advantage of the show's popularity... ... and go do the show on an exotic location... ... and have a good time. There's so many people here from all over the world. Lately, the show's been about us getting excited to go to London. And then we realized in real life, we're doing that same thing. Passport, check. Camera, check. Traveler's checks, check! Are you ready yet? -Got the tickets? -Right here. Check! Yeah! London, baby! It's all London, baby! Here we go. Ross is getting married... ... to this young woman named Emily. And I set them up by accident. Why don't we? Why don't we what? Get married. I've started to... ... fall for this character, Emily, played by Helen Baxendale. And we decided to go all the way, I guess, and get married. Ross has asked me to marry him. I say yes. And so we arrange a big wedding in London. Things go a bit wrong. We're not paying for your wine cellar. You have to meet me in the middle. My foot's gonna meet the middle of your ass! You want a piece of me? ls that what you're saying? That's it! Parents! Parents! Back away! This is our wedding day! From now on, everyone gets along. And if I hear one more word... ... no grandchildren! That's right! Sorry, old boy. I could kill you with my thumb, you know. We knew the show was popular in England... ... and so it seemed like a natural fit. I knew how big the show was over here. It was exciting to be welcomed. Everywhere, walking down the street... ... bunches of kids watching. So we've been signing autographs. They're just big fans of the show, I guess. I watch it all the time because my children love it. They absolutely love it. Tell my friend you like my hat. -What's your friend's name? -Chandler. Hi, Chandler! We wanted it to still feel like Friends... ... and so we shot a lot of it in front of an audience. And it seemed like a really exciting opportunity... ... to shoot an American sitcom in front of a British audience. -Do something! -I am. I'm ignoring you. I'll be the on-camera guy. All right. First stop... ... Westminster Abbey. What is that? That's London, baby! We were really afraid, going over, that either they'd be... ... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh.... They were great! -Big laughers! -They waited in line for hours! -We traveled 329 miles. -She's lying. It's more like 200. The show's doing so well over here that it just seems like... ... they're real, real receptive. It's really wonderful and flattering and overwhelming, truthfully. We didn't have a single bad audience. Also, there was a greater sense of "event. " I think it energized everybody: the actors, the writers.... We're just excited to be here. Like, look back there. Look how cool that is! We missed Lisa. That was probably the only drawback I can think of. I first thought, "How exciting! I wonder if I'm going?" It's awful that Lisa's not here. We feel like we have a limb missing. Let's try some aversion therapy. Look at the picture. It's strange when one person's not there. We miss her. It's weird for all of us to be here without her. She's in the episode, on the phone and things like that. Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey. Hey, Joey! I just saw someone that looks just like you, on the subway. I was going to say hi, then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you. That just cost me four bucks. Part of me wishes I could go. But I'm very happy to not get on a plane for a lot of hours.... Sorry. I'm not a good traveler. The Waltham residence. Is this Emily's parents' house? This is the housekeeper. And by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself... ... and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please... ... if it's not too much trouble, please. Might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please? It was also interesting because we had shot about a third of it here. And a bit of it on the streets in London. All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best abbey I ever seen. What do you think of the Abbey? I think it's great! They're thinking of changing the name. -To what? -To "Put the camera away" ! Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. " It was a really gratifying experience. Pretty much everything we'd hoped to get out of it, we got. When you can go on location even in Los Angeles that's exciting... ... much less have your whole crew... ...come out to "jolly old England. " It's really, really exciting. Just the idea of bringing our entire "family" over here... ... is, like, wild. Yeah! London, baby! It's amazing to me how many people are excited about the show. I knew how big the show was over here. It plays a lot on television. I saw it three times in one week. They're very popular at home, but I didn 't know they would be here. It's got a massive following in Britain... ... particularly among my generation. It's quite sarcastic. That's why it's popular. We have great English character actors who are working with us. And an opportunity to interact with the English crew. We're about to be Ross' in-laws. We're the Brits that you love to hate. We worked with Sarah Ferguson this morning. She was great and funny. I was excited to be here today. It's the first time I've ever done this and I enjoyed it. I am a great fan. I think they are all marvelous. Most British people tried to hate them for being beautiful and funny. I got a phone call: "Small part, a few lines. Do you want it? Next to Jennifer Aniston. " And I went, "Oh, wait a minute.... Oh, okay then. " It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits up the butt" episode, really. You're gonna see a lot of comedy, a lot of romance... ... and a lot of surprises. And you get to see England.
