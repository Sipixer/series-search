- When I'm not around you, I miss you. - You do? That was <i>Save the Last Dance?</i> That dance number at the end was so inspiring. Me and you, we got unfinished business. - Where's Kaitlin? - You're in love. Just be careful of that girl. I love you. And I think you love me too. About Johnny? - I'm with you. - That's not the whole story, is it? - Just come down, Johnny, please? - Just be careful. Johnny! Well, you know what they say, no news is good news. I'm not sure that's true about severe head injuries. - We should've stayed at the hospital. - Nothing we could do there. The doctors told us to go home, sleep, eat. Yeah, except I can't sleep, and I'm definitely not hungry. - Hungry? - Come on. Everyone needs to eat. Johnny's gonna need you when he wakes up. - lf he wakes up. - Marissa. - You were there. - Yeah, I was. You guys, he's probably gonna be fine. Trey was unconscious for, like, months, and he was fine. And he was shot. We waited around like this once before... ...after a certain OD in TJ. I'm gonna go check on Kaitlin in the pool house. - How you doing, Ryan? - She's right. I mean, the way the doctors were talking, you could tell. - They didn't wanna get our hopes up. - Well, doctors are idiots. - You tell that to your dad? - It's their job to be negative. It's called managing expectations. That's why it's our job to be positive. - Johnny's mom. - You think you ought to...? - I don't know. - Do you want me to? No, no. It's all right. Mrs. Harper. Hey, it's Ryan. What happened? Hey. - Thanks for coming by. - No, I'm glad you called. - Where's Gwen? - I finally got her to lie down. She started talking about the funeral and just lost it. - Well, what does she wanna do? - Who knows. She said no priest, no body, nothing depressing. It's a funeral. Isn't it supposed to be depressing? Well, I mean, we could do something during the day. You know, maybe by the water. No one allowed to wear black. Or shoes. Sounds like what he'd wanna do. - I gotta take this to Mrs. H. - Hey, I'll do it. Thanks. It doesn't seem real, man. Listen, man, you can't blame yourself. You tried. - Yeah, and I failed. - Well, don't beat yourself up. Ryan Atwood versus himself is a very ugly cage match. I'm gonna shower, try and get some sleep. So I guess you won't worry about Johnny coming between you and Marissa. Because... Sudoku? Fun to say, fun to do. Too soon? Okay. Too soon. It just feels wrong. The kids are going through this awful thing... ...and we're planning a Valentine's Day dance. All the more reason for them to focus on something good. I mean, it's not like we can cancel this dance now if we wanted to. Although, the thought had crossed my mind. - He hasn't asked you? - Who? Dr. Neil Roberts? Why, no, he hasn't. - Think he has plans with someone else? - No. - That I'm not valentine material? - Julie. That I'm just a fun hang, not worthy of chocolates and nice underwear? Sandy's no fan of Valentine's Day either. We should just concentrate on hosting a great event... ...and worry about our love lives when it's over. Or I could invent a fake reason to go to his house and fish for information. Julie, the last time you went on a stealth mission... ...you toppled a dessert tray. Yeah, but it got his attention. - There you go. - Thank you. Hi. Are you a friend of Johnny's? - I'm his cousin, Sadie. - Hi. I'm glad you're here. My mom thought it would be a good idea if I came... ...and stayed with my aunt for a while. How's she doing? Not so good, you know, but finally sleeping. You look like you could use a few hours. Oh, I'm okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. I should probably go. I just got a lot of stuff to do. - Hey, are you Marissa? - Yeah. Well, I wish it was under better circumstances... ...but it's nice to finally meet you. You too. - Justin. What are you doing here? - Winter break is almost over. I thought you might want a ride back to school. - Should've saved your gas money. - It's a hybrid. Gets pretty good mileage, so gas isn't an issue. Last time you came to town you wanted me arrested. That was my brother. And I was thinking... I was hoping that we could talk. About our relationship. Our relationship? - Today's not a good day. - Is there another day that'll be better? - I want you to leave, right now. - Kaitlin, are you okay? I'll see you then. Thanks. - Hey, boss. - Hey. - You wanted to see me? - Got off the phone with Dr. Griffin. The board has vetted the Brea proposal. They're ready to put a hole in the ground. But I'm gonna to meet with him one more time. Do you think you could call Maya? I mean, with a few caveats. - Name them. - Don't lie. Don't lead her on. That's not a problem. The reason I went out with her is, actually, I really like her. Oh, boy likes girl. Girl has access to influential father boy's boss needs to close a deal. Has all the makings of a great romance. I'm glad you like her. Well, I'll give her a call. Let you know. - Hey, Marissa. - Hi. Marissa. - How are you holding up? - I'm okay. I was wondering... ...there's all these forms from the hospital and, well... ...Johnny's mom can't really deal right now. It doesn't need a lawyer... You know, I actually know just the guy for the job. - I practically majored in paperwork. - Are you sure you don't mind? When it comes to mind-numbing bureaucratic busywork, Matt is an ace. - And here I thought you never noticed. - All right, well, I should get home. You know, shower. I've been in these clothes since you don't wanna know. - I think you're doing great, kiddo. - Thanks. - Oh, hey. - Hey, what are you doing? Nothing. Well, if it's nothing, then you won't mind me looking, right? - That's not porn. - It's a list of my yakuza DVDs... ...sorted alphabetically by title and also by director. Making my inventories is one of those things... ...like masturbating or flossing my teeth... ...where even though you know I do it, I'd rather you not witness it. Cohen, I found something in your drawer. - You're not mad? - Oh, no. I'm mad. I'm livid. Not about the pot, because, I mean, whatever, it's pot, right? And while Marissa and I were hotboxing Luke's car... ...you were at home making a manger for Captain Oats out of Lincoln Logs. You were a late bloomer, I get that. But, Cohen, you lied to me for, like, the gazillionth time. - About something important. - Summer, I don't know what I can do... ...except say I'm not gonna lie again and then not lie. - You just have to trust me. - Yeah, well, I don't. So you better think of something else. - What happened to the Crock-Pot? - It broke. - Hi. Hey. - Hi. - Let me give you guys some privacy. - It's all right. - You don't have to leave. - I've tried talking to her. Well, give her some time. How you doing? You know... Hi, Mrs. Harper. Sorry, hi. Yeah, I guess. Sure. - Hi. - Hey. - Thanks for meeting me. - Sure. No problem. - So you visiting? - Yeah. From Ashland, Oregon. - You taking some time off school, or...? - No, actually, I just graduated. I started my own little jewelry-making business. So I've just been traveling, trying to get stores to carry my stuff. You know, I really need to be with my boyfriend right now. - Your boyfriend? - Yeah. Ryan. He was with me, with Johnny, when it happened. Oh, yeah, my aunt mentioned that there was another kid there, I just thought... This is really awkward. I thought that Johnny was your boyfriend. Why would you think that? Because last week he called me, and he asked me... ...if I would make something for you for Valentine's Day. Here, I brought it with me. That there is your birth stone, and that's his. And in the middle there's an angel. - An angel? - Yeah. He was afraid you'd think it was cheesy... ...but he said that's what you were to him. Johnny and I were pretty close growing up. A couple of years ago, I spent a summer in Newport... ...and I have to say, it was the best summer of my life. Johnny had this pair of Power Ranger pajamas... ...he absolutely refused to take off. I mean, he would literally wake up in the morning... ...put his clothes on top of his pajamas... ...and go about his day wearing his two layers of clothing. Ryan, there's Kaitlin. - I should probably... - No, it's all right. Let me. - Hey, what are you doing up here alone? - Well, what am I supposed to do? Just go down there and introduce myself? "Hey, I'm Kaitlin, the girl who killed him." You didn't make him climb that rock, didn't make him fall. That's right. That was you. You know what? I'm not gonna do this with you. - Everybody's upset. Come on. - No, you know what, Ryan? You can't fix this. So just save the speeches for my sister, all right? All right, here you go. This is your fourth-quarter bonus, by the way. And next time, I pick the sport. Hey, did you ever get in touch with Maya? Yeah. But I kind of wish I didn't. When I didn't call her back, she took that as a sign of my lack of interest. She's a smart girl, and now she's an angry one too. It's not a typo. I need 10,000 cinnamon hearts. And please don't make them stale. Thanks. Hey, honey, are the kids home? No. They're going to The Bait Shop for the wake. - Hey, Matt, how's it going? - Woman troubles. - Oh, well, maybe I can play cupid. - That's a great idea. Really, Sandy? And what is it that you say about Valentine's Day? That it's vacuous, a commercially-driven, hollow shell of a holiday? Sometimes we need a vacuous, commercially-driven diversion. - This would be one of those times. - What's her name? - I'll have a ticket delivered. - Maya Griffin. Whose father's the head of the physician's board? - I don't know. - lf anybody can do it, you can. She doesn't need my help getting a date. It won't work. You know what, Kirsten, don't worry about it. I'm sure that we can come up with something else. I'll get Maya to the party if you try and embrace the holiday. No whining, no snarky comments. Candies, candles, lingerie. Nice lingerie. Nothing red, see-through, or remotely edible. Not even a little see-through? Death and Valentine's Day, there's an unbeatable combination. This is the first one where Marissa and I are actually together. - Should be all-time. - Pressure's on for me to deliver. - Summer found my stash. - You don't have any visible bruises. - She go for the kidneys? - I wish. You and Atwood make V-Day plans? Actually, we haven't even talked about it. Really? It's the first Valentine's Day you guys aren't fighting or kissing another girl. - It could be special. - This is special. All I'm saying is, Valentine's Day might be cancelled this year. Hey, Sadie. - What do you want? - I just wanna see how you're doing. - I mean it, okay? - When's the last time you meant anything? - Is there a problem here? - Hey, man. - This is a private party. - It's okay, he was just leaving. Yeah. - So you know him? - Used to. Sadie, right? I liked what you said at the beach today. Thanks. Speaking at funerals is something of a specialty. - Not that it's anything to brag about. - No one close to me has ever... - Ever died. - Really? Feels like everyone close to me has. I mean, not everyone. But my dad, cancer when I was 14. My dog, Rocky, like a month after that. - My best friend, last summer. - I'm sorry. - For your cousin too. - I see that. It's a funeral. People say sorry before they say hello. But you really are, so thank you. - Ryan, there you are. - Hey. - Hey, Marissa. - Hi. So Seth and Summer were looking for you at the car. - You ready to go? - Yeah, sure. So maybe we'll see you again before you leave. Sure. Yes, well, I think I might have left it somewhere around here... ...at Kaitlin's birthday party. I haven't seen a cake knife anywhere... ...not that I'd know what a cake knife looks like. Are you really gonna be baking? Don't you have your party tomorrow night? Frankly, Neil... ...I'm surprised you remembered about my little dance. Or Valentine's Day. So are you working this weekend? On call? You're such a busy man. No, I thought I'd stay in and catch up on some reading. Because you're behind on work? New techniques must be developed every day. Gotta keep up. Well, I thought I would get into The Da Vinci Code. - Have you read it? - I'm waiting for the movie. Well, I don't see that knife anywhere. I suppose I should be going. Well, it's always good to see you, Julie. - I'll see you out. - It's okay. I know the way. Hey! Happy Valentine's Day. I figured you could use something to hug. Or at least, if you throw him, he won't break. - Trouble at home? - Shockingly, no. It's a boy. I mean, not like that. He... He died. And I was with him. And sort of helped it happen. - What do you mean? - We went to the beach. Drinking, a bonfire. I thought it'd be fun. But he was really messed up. And by the time I called for help, it was too late. He slipped. Fell on some rocks. - Then it was an accident. - Yeah, but accidents don't just happen. People let them happen. I understand why it probably feels that way... ...but if he were here, he'd be the first to take responsibility. And he'd thank you for trying to help him. You're like an adult. My parents are therapists. They're annoying but pretty smart. Well, thank you. So I will see you back in Santa Barbara? - Yeah. - Okay. Bye. - Dude, I can totally see you. - Dude. Right. Hey, how was the...? How was the memorial? Can we talk about something else? Why are you reading Victoria's Secret? You know what, speaking of underwear, I think I have sand in mine. Excuse me. Well, no, your mother gave it to me, with items marked and sizes circled. That mean you're embracing Valentine's Day? Thought you weren't a fan. I made a deal with your mother... ...and I'm holding up my end of the bargain. It's just, like, what's even the point almost, you know? I'm gonna have to borrow that later. Thanks. We'll see. - So, what do you wanna do? - I'm doing it. No, I mean tomorrow. For Valentine's Day. - Can we talk about tomorrow tomorrow? - Not if you wanna do something. I don't wanna do anything. You mean you don't wanna do anything specific... ...or you don't wanna do anything at all? You've never liked Valentine's Day before. Okay, so don't suddenly act like it's your favorite holiday. I'm not. - This is just really hard for me, okay? - Well, it's hard for me too. - I can't explain it. - I was there, Marissa. What is it you think I don't understand? I'm gonna go. Come in. So your girlfriend decided to cancel Valentine's Day? Small town. Very good cell service. Yesterday it seemed like we were having a good day. - At a funeral? - Not a good day... ...but, you know, we were good. Then she just freaked out. Sudden death can do odd things to people. Remember my mom at Grandpa's wake? - That was Kirsten's dad. - Johnny was Marissa's friend. - Her good friend. - Too good. Well, the guy's dead, Ryan. I think you can cut Marissa at least a weekend's worth of slack. She told me she didn't wanna see me today. Ignore her. She was out of her mind with exhaustion and grief. - Seemed lucid to me. - Trust me. No girl wants to be alone on Valentine's Day. - And you know this because...? - Because inside my manly exterior... ...there beats the heart of a 14-year-old girl. Hi. Sandy gave me your address. Thought you'd want these as soon as possible. Thanks. I'm sure Johnny's mom will appreciate it. Yeah. So are we gonna see you and Ryan tonight at the party? Oh, I don't think so. We got in a fight. I got in a fight. It was my fault. Well, I'm sure that Ryan will accept your heartfelt apology. I was more gonna give him a cooling-off period. Well, hey, if you need anything else paperwork-related... ...or just to talk, let me know. - Thanks. - Happy Valentine's Day. - You too. Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message. Well, as I mentioned on the phone... ...my friend Julie and I have a dating service, and... Thank you. - we're having a party tonight. As I mentioned, I don't need a service to get a date. Oh, I know. It's us who needs you. It would mean a lot to have someone like you... ...young and active in Newport's business and social life... ...to be a part of the event. Of course, if you have plans with someone special... You mean someone like Matt Ramsey? I know who your husband is, Kirsten... ...and I seriously doubt this last-minute invitation is a coincidence. Maya, I'm sorry. So just how badly does Matt wanna go out with me? - You're not upset? - I was... ...when I first realized why you were calling. But I've liked Matt since college. And as much as I won't admit it to him... ...I was disappointed he didn't ask me out after dinner. Well, he regrets his decision. Fine. I'll go. I see you picked up a little something for your lady, and I for mine. Your lady's my mother, and I don't wanna talk about it. Women's underwear has gotten very complicated. Thongs, bikinis, briefs. Who knew women's panties were such a minefield? Don't say "panties." - So you and Summer good? - We will be. What'd you do this time? A certain circumstance was not fully disclosed... ...and my omission was discovered. - You got caught in a lie. - In a nutshell. But why's she making a big deal? Not like it's the first time. Well, maybe she thinks of you as a man, not a kid. Kids lie all the time. A man's only as good as his word. Summer deserves a good man. Summer has a good man. - She does? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me? - Just show her. Well, I gotta pick up a few more things for your mother. I promised her the best Valentine's Day ever. - Hey, let me give you a hand. - No, I got it, thanks. It's you. What are you doing here? What do you want? Thought I'd stop by, pay my respects. I didn't get a chance to say anything to Mrs. Harper. She wanted to thank you for trying to help him. - She's inside if you wanna go in. - Let me help. I got it, it's cool. - Not cool. Thank you. - You're welcome. I guess it's kind of an automatic reaction. You're carrying groceries or moving something, so someone offers to help. And, sure, it's nice to share the heavy lifting... ...when you're carrying a futon up three flights of stairs. Is it really worth enduring the awkward conversation? And they're doing you a favor, so you have to be all nice. So being nice, that's an effort for you? Kind of, when I'm carrying a futon up three flights of stairs. - What're these for? - Packing up Johnny's room. So my aunt won't have to. - All done? - All done. I might have to rethink my position on not accepting help from strangers. - Okay. Upstairs. - Yeah. This isn't awkward. This isn't awkward at all. For you. Too bad you're already dressed. I was hoping you'd wear this. It's the black with beige, or the beige with black? Find out. - This is a fantasy I'm not aware of. - I didn't buy that. I didn't buy that. I can explain. - Think this can be fixed with lingerie? - No. Not even if it's very sexy and it says so right here on the tag. The point is, I made a mistake, I will fix it. Cohen, our problem cannot be fixed with underwear. Even age-appropriate underwear with the right cup size. How can I prove I'm not gonna do something I say I'm not gonna? Well, the pressure was on. And you needed to come with a revolutionary idea and rock my world! - I think Valentine's Day is off. - Fine. I got you a card. Deal with it, Ramon. Death Cab for Cutie's playing, and Jake asked me to go. They're playing Death Cab on <i>The Valley?</i> - Never listening to them again. - I know. You look nice. Mom forcing you to go out? Well, I sharpened my bamboo sticks. Turns out no force was necessary. I'm just glad to get out of this trailer. You know, Marissa, honey, it's not too late to change your mind. Fresh air? All the baked clams you can eat? Yeah, that sounds tempting, but I think I just need to be alone. Okay. Hey, I wasn't expecting you. - Hi. - Hi. I was hoping I could convince you to join me at the party. - Maybe we'll see both of you. - Yeah. - Good night. - All right, good night. Got you something. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. Well, put it on, get dressed. Or not. Or not. Fine, forget it. Just hang here. I know you're only trying to be nice. But I really need some time. That's fine. I get that. But is it more than that? I mean... ...when's the last time we actually hung out together, alone? What, you mean without Johnny? You're glad he's gone, aren't you? No, I'm not even gonna answer that. So did Summer give you back the bag? The conversation kind of went in a different direction after that. - Hey. No Marissa? - Yeah. No Summer either? She's over there with her date. Valentine's Day, it's too much pressure. There's Matt. Has his date shown up? Cool. Another dude. I gotta do something. You gonna try to act like this is a strange coincidence? Not anymore. - Can I buy you a drink? - I don't know, can you? Still got that fake ID? Happy Valentine's Day, sir. I was wondering if I could maybe borrow your daughter for a moment. I'm right here. What do you want? I wrote you something. - A cocktail napkin? - It's a confession. Read it. "To whom it may concern: My name is Seth Cohen, and I have problem with flying." It says "lying." Pen shook. "I have lied about many things over the years. The most recent and troubling lies include but are not limited to the following:" There's a complete list on the back of the napkin. All my sins. Very detailed. - Cohen, I know all of this. - I know. But if I ever screw up again, you give that to my parents. That's pretty smart. You may have just rocked my world. A half-court shot at the buzzer. Is that a sports metaphor? I don't follow. I'm wearing the thong. Yeah, that's my mom's. - What are you doing? - Getting wasted. You and me, Marissa. We're the only people who understand what we're going through. You might be right about that. This emotional connection might be a really good platform... ...for a more physical one. I'm not gonna make out with you, Chili. It's not Chili anymore. I'm going back to Dennis. Johnny never liked that nickname. Care for some oysters, ma'am? Oh, no. I don't do oysters. If I'm gonna swallow something disgusting... ...there better be something in it for me. - Hey, Mom. - Oh, hey, baby. How are you? I was thinking about leaving. Oh, then I'll see you back at the house. No, I mean leaving Newport. Going back to school. Tonight. Justin, he offered to give me a ride. Hello. Julie Cooper-Nichol, Kaitlin's mother. Very nice to meet you. You have a lovely daughter. I'll drive under the speed limit, make sure she buckles her seatbelt. Stop for coffee several times. Thank you, Justin. I appreciate that. Well, I'll see you at parents' weekend. Promise me you're definitely coming back. I promise. You'll be seeing a lot more of me. Kaitlin, I'm so sorry if this trip wasn't everything you hoped for. I'm a Cooper, Mom. I'll survive. Okay, bye. - Hey. - Hello there. - You look radiant tonight. - Thank you. Hoping we could talk. - You don't have to explain. - No, I think I do. All this back and forth, coming together, pulling away again... ...I think it's happening for a reason. We don't belong together. We both have very complex lives... ...which will make this very complicated. Right. I mean, who's looking to make life any more complicated? Did you say "will"? I'm sorry it's taken me this long to ask you this... ...but I lost my nerve and I wasn't trusting my instincts. But, Julie... ...would you be my Valentine? All alone tonight? That's to be expected under the circumstances. Marissa and I have been fighting a lot. Mainly about whether Johnny was just a friend. - Or if it was more than that. - She says it wasn't. I don't think she's lying to me... ...but she might be lying to herself. And now that he's gone, I don't know how we move forward. - Or if. - Well, the night's not over. Maybe there's a pit stop you can make on the way home. Yeah, actually, there is. How's Ryan? Oh, he has a lot on his mind, as usual. Matt and Maya seem to be getting along. - Think they're talking about business? - Yeah. I think right now he's saying how our design offers more space... ...for emergency care and outpatient services. I think she's more concerned about wheelchair access in the lobby. Oh, she's a good soul. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. Don't cry or anything. Look, I know this wasn't the best vacation you've ever had... ...but I really am sorry for everything. Don't be. Just figure it all out. - Figure what out? - What you really felt for Johnny. What does it matter now? Keep telling yourself whatever you want, but it does matter. I'm really glad you came back. I kind of sort of maybe might believe you. - Hi. - Hi. I was wondering if I could give you a hand? No, no, I got it. Thank you. - Okay, I'll just... - I mean, really? Yeah, yeah. Figured you could use the help. I can make the conversation more awkward. Well, in that case, please. Hey, Kait, I think there's something in your eye. It couldn't be. Is that a tear? Shut up. You know, as weird as it may sound... ...I think I'm actually gonna miss this place. What are you thinking? If I could've done or said anything... ...that would've saved him. Well, I think it's a hard thing to accept... ...that life's completely out of our control. But you were there for him. End of the day, that's all we can really do for each other. Just be there. And I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. Go away. - I just wanna talk. - There's nothing to say. You wouldn't have come if you didn't wanna see me. Got nothing to do with you. Leave before I scream for the cops. We both know you're not gonna do that. What the hell is he doing here? Everything okay? It is now.
