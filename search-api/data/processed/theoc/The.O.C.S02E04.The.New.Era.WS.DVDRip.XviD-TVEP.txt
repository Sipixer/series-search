-Guilty. Guess who no longer works for Partridge, Savage, and Kahn. -You quit? -Or got fired. -Ryan Atwood. -Lindsay Gardner. I owe you an apology. -I'm sorry. -Me too. We agreed we wouldn't tell anyone. Because you could get fired. You know what? I quit. As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be the new CEO... ...of the Newport Group. -Maybe I can't be just friends with you. -Maybe this is it for us. -So you won't help me? -I got a physics quiz. I'm busy. -Ryan. Please, man. -What? This is a crisis. Zach and Summer. They're full-on dating now. I need a girlfriend. Pronto. -You'd start dating to show up Summer. -There's other reasons. I can't think of them right now. Hold on a second. Let's break bread. Let's discuss broads. My graphing calculator is in your room. -You know what else is in my room? -What? What is in your room? My yearbook. Full of new ideas for fresh-faced loved ones. We can make... -...a list of 20 finalists by homeroom. -Bad idea. -Keep my leftovers. -I'm not dating. That's my plan. Yes, you absolutely are. I'm not entering this new era alone. It is a new era. Getting the ax was the best thing that could happen. Now the only person I answer to is me. And my father. All I'm saying is that he's your only client, isn't he? Yeah. And you work for his wife. What was your father thinking? You can ask him. You'll be hanging with him all day. If I can win this case, get my practice off the ground.... You can spend your entire career defending my father's rich clients. You're not bringing me down, honey. No. You heard Seth. It's a new era. Sure is. And guess what. I think I found a new girlfriend. -ln the kitchen? -ln the new era, Seth finds... -...girlfriends in the yearbook. -Tina Wu. Part of the a cappella group. Co-president of the improv team... ...Shenanigans. She's musical. She's witty. Hopefully she's free for lunch. -Dude. "Shenanigans"? -I know. You sure you're ready to start dating? After all you went through with Summer? Better he should mope? Don't listen. If it was up to her, I'd still be at Partridge, Savage, and Kahn... -...bitching about high-priced lawsuits. -Totally. Should I go for the Wu... ...or keep talking about Summer? -Here's to the new era. -Amen. All right, so the Tina Wu thing didn't happen. Just move on. You know, a simple no from the Wu would have been sufficient. I think the added laughter was just unnecessary. -Hey. -Hey, Seth. -What about her? -Tiffany Rosenberg? No, we have a history. Third grade. Class field trip to SeaWorld. I tried to sort of talk to the dolphins. She overheard. There was taunting. It was really bad. The bus ride home was the low point. I'll point out a girl. You tell me if you'd date her. -I'll tell you whether she would date me. -Yeah, exactly. Them. Right there. -Yeah. And no. -No? -No. Yeah. -Yeah? Are you shopping for girlfriends in the quad? -Yeah. -No. Classy and not remotely demeaning. Lindsay, Seth. Seth, Lindsay. -Hey. -So how does this work? Is there a ranking system, or is each girl judged on her individual merits? And by merits, I mean her rack and/or ass. -It's a simple yes/no survey. -Yes/no survey. I see. Well, in that case: No. And no. I'll see you in class. -I can't believe I finally met her. -Lindsay? Lindsay Cohen. It's got a nice ring to it. -Will you hook that up for me? -No. Why not? Unless, hey, do you like her? No, no, no. No, just... -...she's argumentative, bossy, difficult. -Yeah, that's my type. -Believe me, hold out for something else. -No. I need that one. I need you make that happen for me. Can you? -Can you hook me up? Hook me up. -I can hook it up. That's what I like to hear. Thank you. This is a new era, Summer. For the first time in my life I have, like, no boy drama. That is not possible. You are a magnet for boy drama. I'm serious. Ryan and l? Just friends. And DJ? What, with the deltoids and the trapezoids? He wants nothing to do with me. -Well, did you apologize? -I have no idea where he is. After he quit working for my parents, he went totally MlA. He can't be that hard to find. Doesn't he work for the Hendersons? -See? T otally addicted to boy drama. -Like you don't have issues. Actually, my love life is trauma-free. Lunch went well with Zach and your dad? Amazing. None of that manic Cohen chatter. Or that incomprehensible Cohen mumbling. If Cohen is the virus, Zach is the cure. He is the anti-Cohen. -Speak of the devil. -Cohen? -Zach. -Right. Great. Better. -Hey. -Hi. -That's a firm hug. -Sorry, Duckie. Duckie? We have nicknames. -We do? -Yes. Duckie? That's.... That's cute. So, Duckie, Marissa is bumming out because she doesn't have anyone... -...in her life as perfect as you. -Thanks, Sum. I know lots of eligible bachelors. -You want me to set you up? -No. That's okay. Really. I'm fine. You know, this is the start of a new era for us, Sandman. Working together on the same side of the law. Overcoming our differences. Battling the odds. Bringing a tear to my eye. Now let's talk about what we know... -...at this point in the game. -You hungry? They do a delicious frittata here. -You a frittata man? -I'm fine. Now, you've been funneling money every month to a trust. The person who runs this trust is an associate of the city councilman's office. The same city councilman that issues building permits... ...to people who build lots of buildings. -People like you. -I do build lots of buildings. I've done well for myself. Started off with nothing. And still I strive for more. Never satisfied. -What do they call that? -Greed. Now, as you can see, on the face of it... ...this looks like bribery. What about a round of drinks? What do you say? -Manhattans? -It's 1 0 a.m. Now, focus. -Why did you set up the trust? -Charity, tax benefits. What about the woman who runs the trust? Renee Wheeler. I don't know her. You're very grumpy today. I think it's because you're hungry. Frittata coming right up. The DA wants you to spend your twilight years in a 5-by-9 cell. -All you can think about are frittatas. -No one is going to jail. This thing won't even make it to court. -Phyllis. -Phyllis? Yeah, my old secretary. She retired three years ago. -She set up the trust. -You couldn't tell me this on the phone? Then I wouldn't get to see you. Let's get you that frittata. Excuse me. -You're lurking. -Right. Sorry. Look, for all I know, you have a boyfriend, so there's no point... -...in me even asking you this-- -I don't. -I don't have a boyfriend. -You don't? -Yeah. Don't rub it in. -Right. Well, I was wondering if you... ...would maybe wanna.... Maybe, and feel free to say no. Go out on a date. Okay. Sure. -Yeah? -Yeah. Great. So you'll go out with Seth? -What? -You'll go on a date with Seth? Yes. Seth. You want me to go out with Seth. And I said yes, so.... -Yes. -Great. Great. -Great. You sure? -I am positive. Tomorrow night. -The sooner the better, right? -Right. Thanks. Look who has a new ficus. I have a ton of work to do. If you could-- I figure now that I'm in charge, I can introduce more life into this place. Yeah, a ficus here, an orchid there. -Next thing you know we are-- -A rain forest. Thanks for the plant. But right now this company is one failed deal away from total ruin. Which means I have to ficus-- Focus. Ficus, focus. Honey, you are all over the place. But no need to worry. The boss is here. Let me lighten your load. What are you reading? Budget projections for next year. It's very dense. -Which you think I am. Dense. -No. Julie.... No. Look. The key to good leadership is delegation, so why not delegate... -...this stuff to me so you're free to-- -Continue being stupid? Julie. All I'm saying is that we have an extremely... -...important presentation tomorrow. -Y es. Clearly, I have a lot of reading up to do so I can be ready for the presentation. You know, running this company is about more than just plant life. Even you should know that. Hey. I saw your truck, and I thought I'd stop by and say hi. -How are you? -Busy. Right. You can't be busy all weekend. The Killers are playing tomorrow. They're good. So, what, are we friends now? Judging by this conversation, probably not. But I'd really like to try... ...and be something. -How's your boyfriend feel about that? -He's not my boyfriend. I guess that explains what you're doing here talking to me. When you and l.... I didn't know Ryan was coming back. -Glad I could help kill time till he did. -You know that's not what it was. Bait Shop. Tomorrow night. I'll be there if you decide to stop by. -Hi. -Hey. I think all this manual labor is affecting my vibe. Do I seem tougher to you? You don't want me to answer that. Hey, so guess what. You have a date tomorrow. -I do? With who? -Lindsay. The future Mrs. Seth Cohen. No. Man, I said I wanted to marry her... ...not date her. I didn't think she'd say yes. This changes everything. -Well, I'm not getting you out of it. -Well, I'm not going. -Unless you go with me. I will do that. -You want me to go with you on a date? -As your chaperon? -We'll double. I'll set you up. -With all the single women you know? -Seth. Clogged toilet in the men's room. -Sweet. -Hey. Hi. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -She wouldn't go out with me. -You kidding? Her tattoo, your wristband. That's a wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story. You are the Sid to her Nancy, the Kurt to her Courtney. -50 Cent to her Mrs. Cent. -No. I'm done dating. I told you that. Kids don't date anymore. They hang out in groups and peel off to hook up. -You've never done that. -I know. But I read about it in New York Times Magazine. My guess is that Alex loves the group hang. "Group hang "? That's the lamest thing I've ever heard. -But later we peel off-- -And do what? Go to Chuck E. Cheese? Mini golf? I swear, mentally, you are 7 years old. -That was last year. Now I'm 8 3/4. -It's my night off. Why would I want... -...to spend it here with you? -I'll tell you. Look at me. I'm a youth in need. Okay? Somebody stomped on my sand castle. And my ball rolled out in the middle of the street. -My kite is caught in a tree-- -I get it. And you know what else? My friend Ryan, he's really cool. He's anti-establishment. He enjoys sunset walks on the beach... -...punching people, and not smiling. -And that's how you see me? Yeah, only with less smiling. -You're out of your mind. -Maybe I am, Alex. Maybe... ...I'm so far out of my mind that I'm in yours. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "l can't wait to go." That's what you think. Maybe? Is it? -ls that what you're thinking? -I'll go just to get-- Stop freaking out. It's okay. I will hook you up. It's fine. Look, you're smiling. -I like it. It'll be really fun. -Get out. Tomorrow night at 8. It's gonna be awesome. So while I can appreciate your apprehension, let me assure you... ...that the dip in company earnings is only a temporary one. Good morning. So sorry I'm late. I'm glad you didn't wait for me. Julie Cooper-Nichol, CEO of the Newport Group. Hello. Julie, I was just going over our investment pitch... ...for Mr. Herbert's new mall development. Feel free to jump in... -...if you think I've missed anything. -Don't be so modest. I'll jump in now. -Are there any questions I can answer? -This isn't the q & a-- Well, I do have a couple questions, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol. Our primary concern is... ...how will Caleb Nichol's potential indictment affect our development? It won't. Because we won't let it, will we, Mr. Herbert? What I think Julie meant, Mr. Herbert... ...is that the success of the Newport Group is not contingent... ...on the ideas and opinions of any one person. I think Mr. Herbert and I can take it from here. Will you get me... ...a copy of this document? I need it on my desk tout de suite. Julie... ...that's the lunch menu. Go. Shoo. Thank you all for your time. Excuse me. What's your next question? How do you explain the company's failure to hedge its portfolio... ...against the rise of long-term interest rates? Yes. So Alex said yes to the date, huh? It's not a date. It's a group hang with an eye towards peeling off with-- Summer. -I don't know if I'd be cool with that yet. -On your left. -Don't mention the date. -Right, no, sure. Take the high road. -Cohen. Hey, Ryan. -Summer. I have a date. Wow. I hope you and Captain Oats have fun. -Actually, it's with a girl. -Hey, guys. -Hey. -Coop, you just missed a milestone here. Cohen has a date with a real live human girl. Well, that's great. -I guess. When? -Tonight. So you know, don't wait up. Don't worry. Zach and I will sleep just fine, thanks. Good. Because I'll sleep just fine tonight too, with.... I'd have loved to remember her name there. -High road, huh? -Not my proudest moment. So if Seth is abandoning you for his big date tonight... ...then what are you gonna do? Because if you wanted to do something.... Yeah, well, l.... You have a date tonight too. No, it's not a date. It's more of a group hang. -How are things with you and DJ? -They're not. But I should probably get to-- But have fun tonight on your date. Or "hang. " -Hey. -Hey. What are you doing here? Guess who brought you a lobster roll from the Crab Shack. My hero. My favorite sandwich, a surprise pop-in.... Yes. It's work. Don't tell me. You screwed up. Power went straight to your head. -You rocked the boat too hard. -You can stop. I have found it challenging. Truth is, being CEO is a bitch. -You'd think you'd be a natural. -I tried to Google myself today... ...and crashed the entire computer network. Our most important investor... ...ran out on his meeting with me, and I don't blame him. Wow. I've never heard you admit to having faults before. This is fun. I was hoping for a confidence boost. -I suppose I don't have that coming. -Sure you do. Listen. You may not have Kirsten's experience, or, let's face it, any experience. -Get to the boost. -But you are savvy. That goes a long way in this business. If I had your instincts... -...I never would have lost a dime. -So you think this is fixable? If there's one thing that you're good at, it's getting money from rich old men. You've just got to do it the Julie Cooper way. You know I don't mean sleep with them, right? You know what? I think you've just given me the confidence to execute plan B. And you have given me a delightful snack. I love this new era. We should have gotten divorced years ago. Thank you, Jimmy. Hey, there she is. Awesome. Hey, why don't you go talk to her for an hour or five... -...and just tee me up. -She's your date. Details. I'm gonna go find Alex. -Hey. -What are you doing here? Chaperoning? I have a date too. So we're, what, doubling? Is this one of those group hangs I've read about? I'm not sure what this is. Look, right there. That's a good-looking human being. -He is cute. -I told you. But here's the thing, though. Is he cuter than me? Should I not have him sit at the same table as my date? You're cute too. Really? But cuter than Ryan? I mean, I just don't want him overwhelming me. I don't think that's possible. You think I'm cute. -When you're not talking. -Hey. Ryan, Alex. Alex, Ryan. Lindsay, Seth. Seth, Lindsay. How could I forget? Well, this should be great. Really great. And not at all awkward. Yes, Your Honor. Yes. -Sandy, what are you doing? -I've got Judge Hatchett on the TiVo. Have you ever seen her? She does not take crap from anybody. What's going on? -What do you mean? -You're in pajamas. You have orange Cheeto dust all over you. What has happened to my husband? Your father's case is as good as lost. He's been giving me the complete runaround. T oday he sent me to go meet with his former assistant Phyllis. -Phyllis died last year. -Exactly. Literally, dead ends. That's the best lead he's given me yet. Julie seems to be on the same seek-and-destroy mission as my dad. As long as she's running the company... -...I might as well-- -Give up. Why don't we give up? Give up with me, honey. We could let the gruesome twosome destroy our careers... ...or we could sit here and enjoy obscene amounts of Dr. Phil... -...and destroy them ourselves. -Sandy. If my dad is acting all weird, he's hiding something. I know. Which means it's your job to figure out what that is. I'm not your favorite person right now, but I can make it up to you. -This can't be good. -Let's have a party. Sure. Julie, can we talk about this tomorrow? Sure, we can. Unfortunately, the caterers are here right now. Come on in, guys. This way. -What's going on? -You know, here's the thing. I knew if I asked in advance, you'd probably say no. So I called Mr. Herbert and several other clients and invited them to a party. -At our house? -T onight? Yeah, Caleb thought it was a great idea. He went to the club to meet someone for work. -Meet who? -Who knows? Well, so much to do, so little time. So The Killers.... Awesome, huh? Stellar observation. And one you've made, like, eight times now. All right. So do you like live music? Not really. You? It's my passion. -Dude, I'm dying here. -My guess is the secret conference... -...isn't helping. -The good news is we hit rock bottom. Although I've redefined rock bottom several times tonight. I think we just hit a new low. There was no way I was gonna let you stay home tonight. I know. I wish I didn't have to third-wheel on your date. Duckie and I don't mind, do we? Yeah, how much longer will this Duckie thing go on for? Do you want a new nickname? How about--? Cohen. I think it's a little soon to joke about that. Summer. Oh, my God. Hey. -How are you? -Hey, Cohen. -Ryan. -Marissa. This is Lindsay. This is Alex. -This is Lindsay. -Yeah, okay. -Well this.... This is just.... -This is awesome. It's awesome. Maybe we should-- -Watch the band. -All right. -Yeah. -See you. See you. So I'm guessing we just met some ex-girlfriends. Ryan and Marissa, that's an epic tale right there. But Summer and I are just as fascinating. She was my shorty... ...Iast year, but then she got served. Not that that's... ...particularly interesting. Jimmy, thank God you're here. Julie invited me. She knows I can't turn down free booze. Neither can she. Look at her. The giggling and touching.... Oh, God, she just grazed an ass. The not-so-subtle ass graze. Yeah, I've been a victim of it myself. Don't worry about it. She's schmoozing the crowd at a cocktail party. This is our star clientele. Do you know how many years... ...of wooing and cajoling it took to have a meeting with them? This is the woman who came from Riverside to become head Newpsie. Then landed Newport's biggest tycoon and took over his company. She knows what she's doing. Ten bucks says Cohen is bending that poor girl's ear about Superman... ...or Batman or Something Man in a unitard she doesn't give a crap about. You know what? I should stop him. For her sake. That sounds like it's coming from a really generous place. Or we could put off the Cohen obsession and watch the band. -I am not obsessing. -The seething. The staring. The analyzing of his outfit. That's not obsessing? What? That shirt totally accentuates his bird arms. I think this is the part where I go to the bathroom. I admit that our breakup, to an outside observer, could seem sad. But, I don't know, for me, I feel like it's given me this great gift, this new era. And this whole new situation, like, her, Zach, you and l, it works. -Drinking alone. That's not a good sign. -What are you doing here? I tried to talk to Phyllis earlier, but I left my Ouija board at home. No more games, Cal. Who was that woman I saw leave this place? You trailed me here? -Spied on me? -No, actually, I got lucky. -I showed up just as she was leaving. -She was.... She's a.... -An old friend. -Come on. You built a fortune on lies. You can do better than that. My guess, that was Renee Wheeler. I told you. I don't know her. Then that was somebody driving her car. I called her license plate number in to a friend of mine at the police station. Well played, Magnum, P.I. Stay away from her. I'll only ask you this once, Cal. Are you having an affair? We're in much deeper water than that, believe me. -lf I were you, I'd leave it alone. -What if I don't? Well, we could lose everything. So before you go probing around into my affairs... ...think long and hard. Is it worth it to you? All right, let's hear it for The Killers. It's like four too. Her over there. Me over here. Me over her over here. So the four of us hanging out over each other, but hanging out together. I mean apart, but in the same place, but in different places mentally. -Something's wrong with you. -No, that's the best part. I'm totally fine not talking to her. I have nothing to say to her. Except, what I would say if I said something to her... ...and I don't care at all if I do, is that I'm fine not talking to her. -Maybe I should tell her that. -Well, you'd better hurry... ...because they're leaving. I'll be right back. Hey, you came. Well, my friends got tickets, and they had an extra. Right. I'll see you around. Maybe you should tell her. -Tell who what? -Lindsay. That you like her. I'm not offended. It's okay. It's a group hang... ...and, listen, no offense here, but I'm not really feeling the spark. Wow. An honest conversation with a girl. This is new for me. I'm gone. Thanks. I was not talking about Cohen the entire night. It sure felt like it. Well, what, you wanna go somewhere else? Maybe you should go home and log on to some kind of Cohen chat room. -I've had enough. -Summer. Hey. Where you going? -Look, it's Seth. -We're going home. -Can I talk to you? Zach, I'm sorry. -Okay, I'm gonna go jump off the pier. Zach, wait. I just want to tell you I don't want to talk. I'm fine with this. You and him. Me and her. Zach sure is a fast walker. Just stop trailing us, all right? -I'm not trailing-- -Zach, will you wait, please? -I just-- -Just beat it. Duckie. Please. Please. -lf you promise to stop calling me Duckie. -I can't make any promises. -Where you going? Can I give you a lift? -I couldn't ask any more from you. Nor thank you enough for one of the worst evenings of my life. I know. Seth's not ready to date yet. It was a bad idea. It was a colossally bad idea. Epically bad. The invasion of lraq... -...Iooks pretty good in comparison. -Okay. You're right. -Let me talk to you for a second. -No, Ryan. You can't. I've listened to enough talk for one night, okay? See you at school. Come here. You'll never believe this. Stephen's daughter has a pony too. -She boards at the same stable as China. -What a coincidence. How cute is that little riding park? At Christmas they string lights in the trees. Y es. My daughter and her Shetland spend all their Saturdays there. Stephen, about the meeting, I wanted to apologize-- You know, Kirsten is the one who renovated the stable and the park. Then sold it back to the original owners at twice the cost. Preservation and profit. That's your motto, right, Kirsten? Well, that's every developer's dream. Funny. Mine's Jude Law on a zebra-skin rug. Your drink's looking empty. Can I get you another? -Only if you two join me. -Be careful, Stephen. Kirsten here's got a bit of a hollow leg. -What are you drinking? -Champagne. Make it two. -Done. -Thank you. See? I'm not totally useless. -I never said-- -Apology accepted. I'm going to get... ...Mr. Herbert's contract from my purse. Make sure he gets another whiskey sour. -Hey. -Hey. -How was your night? -Not good. You? Worse. You didn't like Alex? And you and Lindsay? Not even close. What are you gonna do now? -Actually, I was gonna go and.... -Go for it. -Yeah? -Yes. What are you gonna do? -I was gonna maybe-- -Good idea. -All right. See you. -All right. See you. Great show. I hope you guys come back soon. So to recap... ...I got discoed by two girls in one night. And, unfortunately, that's just not the first time that's happened. -Actually, I'm not surprised. -Thank you. Keep twisting the knife. -I'm not in enough pain. -You're hurting? Not Summer or Lindsay? Yeah, well, at least everybody's miserable, right? Anyways, sorry about the whole... ...group hang or whatever that was. Good night. -Hard to believe those girls running out. -Don't make me try and feel better. What with you being so bratty and immature. -Good. You weren't. -And even... ...sometimes... ...a little... ...charming. Especially when you're not talking about Summer. -I know. I just-- -And knowing is half the battle... ...so perhaps there's a little hope for you yet. You want to get ice cream or something? -lce cream as a nightcap. -Yeah. -You really are 8. -And three-quarters. Let's go. I'll buy, but no more than two scoops. All right. -Keeping watch? -What are you doing here? I was headed to your house. I thought I'd surprise you. So this means...? I'm not sure exactly, except... ...I guess I better prepare myself for some drama, huh? You have no idea. Hi. Need a lift? No, thanks. The bus will be here soon. Okay. Did you not understand the part about me taking the bus? -All right. Hold on. -Don't. It's my fault. I knew it was gonna be a disaster with Seth. -Then why'd you say yes? -I thought you were asking me out. -I didn't mean to say that out loud. -What? I thought that I was saying yes to you. -Where's that stupid bus? -You did? Because l.... I mean, you think I'm an idiot. Yeah, well, I guess that's the twist, because it turns out I'm the idiot. No, no, you're not. I.... When I asked you out that day for Seth l.... Well, l.... Keep talking, Ryan. I wanted it to be me. I did. I just didn't think in a million years you'd say yes. Then I've been right all along. You are an idiot. An idiot you'd go out with sometime? It's possible. -Party's over. -Finally. I literally had to push Stephen Herbert out the door. Deal's back on? He re-signed his contracts. Hopefully, he'll remember that in the morning. Julie Cooper. Definitely understands the weakness of man. You were gone for a while. Well, I was driving around. Thinking how I find myself again... ...in a very familiar triangle. -What triangle is that? -You. Me. Your dad. -He's guilty, isn't he? -He's guilty of something. -Something he thinks we shouldn't know. -Well, you've never been one... -...to shy away from the truth. -I can start now.
