- Two weeks. - Wow. They're really doing it. I know it should be simple. Your boyfriend hits you... ...you leave him. Right? - It's never simple. You're probably a fan of the classics. Superman? No? Batman? You probably really need Ryan right now. Me being here, I'm getting in the way. - It's more than twice what we put into it. - Caught me at a good time. - He's up to something. - I don't care. $2.5 million. You and me, we're gonna be fine. Ryan. Ryan, hey. Hey, man, are you asleep? Ryan. Ryan. Are you asleep? Yeah, I can't sleep either. I know what you're gonna say. You know, she hasn't technically dumped me yet... ...but it's only a matter of time, right? So, what do I do? Do I force a confrontation or do I just continue... ...to be whiny and passive-aggressive until she realizes what a catch I am? Ryan? - Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. You asleep? - Yeah. Sorry. I'm gonna let you go back to sleep, okay? As bad as things are for me, they're worse for you. What? I'm at least in my own bed not sleeping. You're on my floor not sleeping. - Because you won't stop talking. - But also because your ex-girlfriend... ...is sleeping in your room, to the dismay of your girlfriend. - Marissa's fine with it. - I'm sure she is. The same way you'd be fine with it if Oliver was sleeping on her couch. It's cool. What, you want me to kick Theresa out? No. But aren't you just the least bit curious as to when she's leaving? No, I'm not. I'm not worried about it. - Okay. - Okay. Good. Night. Go back to bed. Or the floor. - I should talk to Theresa. - Let me come with you. - Theresa? - Housekeeping. - Hello? - Maybe she's still at work. - Her bag's here. - Yeah. Apparently, she's been shopping. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys come in. Let me know if you ever need anything. My mom's got lots of toiletries. Thanks, but I'm probably not gonna be here that much longer. You're not? No, I can't impose on Seth's parents forever. - Sure you can. I intend to. - Thanks... ...but I really need to figure things out. I have some family I can call, so... So see you tomorrow? No. I picked up a morning shift at the bakery, so... Oh, all right. So maybe after school? - Sure. But aren't you and Marissa...? - Yeah. No, I mean we'll both see you. We'll all see you, because my girlfriend's currently dating her father, which to me... - Seth. - We'll talk about this tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. All right, good night. Night. So, what's it gonna be, Cal? The Hyatt Newporter? The pool at the Four Seasons Hotel where everybody gets married? Or the beautiful glass cathedral overlooking the ocean... ...at the Wayfarer's Chapel? I have to get to work. Whatever you like, Juju. Sorry about breakfast, Kiki. Dad, the only reason we're having this breakfast is so we can do some work. You have been so busy with the wedding, I haven't even seen you. Every time I've asked him to help me with the wedding, he says he's with you. Really? So, CayCay, what have you been doing all this time? Don't you have someplace to be? As a matter of fact, I'm meeting Jimmy for breakfast. I bet even that sounds pretty good to you right now. The Wayfarer Chapel it is. Well, are you sure? I mean, these photos don't really do it justice. You know what? I should take you up there this weekend, you'll love it. I wish I could. I'm out of town. What? Since when? You can't go. We're getting married next week. Just one night. Business. Business where? - Nevada. - Nevada. As in Las Vegas, Nevada? - Actually... - You're going out of town for one night... ...to Vegas on business? What business? There is no business. You're going to Vegas because you're having a bachelor party. - Some of the investors and I are... - Hiring strippers... ...drinking too much and gambling all night the weekend before our wedding? It sounds like a bachelor party to me. I have to admit, I feel a little hurt that I wasn't invited. - Yeah, me too. - Not that I have any affection for you. You know that. But I do love the Vegas. - I didn't know you love the Vegas, Dad. - I love the Vegas. I love the Vegas. Ryan, how do you feel about the Vegas? Never been to the Vegas. Mom was all about the Reno. Dad, we should go. You love Vegas. Ryan and I have never been. He can use his mutant card-counting abilities to pay for the trip. - Sounds like fun for the whole family. - What about Theresa? Well, I can take care of Theresa. You guys should go. Do I have any say in this? No. Enjoy your bachelor party. Hey. Ready for breakfast? Almost. My realtor is on her way. I just have to give her the contract. Contract for what? Well, with any luck... ...my new house. Jimmy, it's right on the beach. It's perfect. I want to give Marissa a home she can be proud of. You know? What are you gonna do with your half of Caleb's money? I'm taking some of it to Vegas this weekend. The boys and I are crashing his bachelor party. You want to come? Are you kidding? The man bailed us out, took Julie off my hands. I'll buy him his first lap dance. Hell, I'll give him one myself. Can you grab that? I just gotta get the contract. Hi. Gail van Deepen. You must be Sandy. - Yeah. - Congratulations on selling the restaurant. You must have made a fortune. I heard Robert Campbell is gonna turn that area into an outdoor mall. Robert Campbell? We sold the restaurant to Caleb Nichol. Then I guess Caleb is gonna make a fortune. Well, another fortune, right? But you and Jimmy must have made good money. What are you gonna do next? I wanna kill him. Then I'd probably go to jail, but it would be better... ...than having to move in with him and my mom, right? That way, I won't have to tell my dad I'm moving out. You still haven't told him? What am I supposed to say, that Caleb's blackmailing me? My dad'll kill him and I'll have to move in with my mom. So, what are you gonna tell him? I don't know, but I guess I have to do it by this weekend, huh? Your dad might be going to Vegas this weekend. How do you know? Because I might be going to Vegas this weekend. For what? - Caleb's bachelor party. - What? With, like, strippers and prostitutes and showgirls? I don't know, I hope so. What? No. I'm not gonna go. I can't leave Theresa here by herself. Theresa? What about me? You know what I mean. You got Summer and your sister. Theresa, she's got nobody. Well, she's got me. I mean, I am your girlfriend, right? So, I mean, any friend of yours is a friend of mine. Right? - You are my girlfriend. - Glad to hear it. - Now, about those strippers... - What strippers? I don't know of any stri... I don't want Chippendales. I want strippers. Full-on, full-frontal male strippers. Preferably at a place that serves bottomless margaritas. Or I could invite the girls over and I could throw you... ...a lovely, catered bachelorette cocktail party. - With strippers. - Without strippers. Julie, we are smart, sophisticated women. We don't need strange, naked men dancing in front of us to be entertained. I'm not as smart as you. Plus, the boys are getting strippers. The boys are not getting strippers. Kirsten, it's Las Vegas. You get strippers as a side with your entr Áe. They're getting strippers. Why else would Sandy go to Vegas with Caleb? Strippers, huh? Get all the Newpsies into limos, drive to L. A... ...have dinner on Sunset, then head south to Mantopia. - Or the Stud Farm. - You've done research. Todd in Accounting, who also told me about this place called The Petting Zoo. It's not exactly legal, but... Julie, I am not going to a place called The Petting Zoo. You don't know where the pets have been. We'll be too drunk to care. - No strippers. - Just one stripper? Please? Just one little stripper who never hurt anyone... ...who's just trying to make his way in the world? Naked. One little stripper. Yes! You're the best. But no Chippendales. And not little. A bachelor party? Where really anything could happen. Good to know. Yeah. Just kind of a courtesy thing, really. Seeing as how, last time I checked, we're still boyfriend and girlfriend. Even though you've been ignoring me in the halls and don't return any of my calls. I didn't mean for that to rhyme. - Look, Cohen... - I just want you to tell me... ...that you're not gonna let what your dad thinks of me break us up. - He's my dad. - So what? Summer, I don't care about your dad. Okay? I care about you a lot. And if that's not good enough for you... Obviously, that's not good enough for you, so I'll go to Vegas. Wait. - Hi. - Hey. How was work? How you feeling? Good. I'm actually going back. I picked up another shift tonight. Marissa and I were kind of hoping we could all hang out. Yeah, I can't. I have to make money if I'm gonna go to Atlanta. - Atlanta? - Yeah, my cousin Kim lives in Atlanta. She said I can go stay with her as long as I pay my own way. I mean, she doesn't have a pool house or anything... ...but that way, maybe I can get a second chance too. How much you need? I can't take your money. - I don't even... Two thousand dollars? - I'll ask the Cohens. No, you won't. Listen to me. This is not your problem, okay? Go. Win. Make money. That's what I'm gonna do. Two thousand dollars, huh? Well, I've got about... I'd say I've got about a thousand in savings bonds, bar mitzvah bucks. I could throw in a couple hundred. I can't ask you guys to do that. You didn't ask. We volunteered. Thanks, but it's still not enough. You could make it enough. Take that money to Vegas and triple it at blackjack. It's been a while since I've done the card-counting thing. Listen, I'm gonna start you off slow. If you suck, I'm just gonna cut you off. - How do we get in the casinos? - I think we'd use our fake IDs. - You have fake IDs? - C.D. Sebulski, it's good to meet you. - Have you met Marty Nayfis? - Oh, God. Okay, look, you guys go to Vegas. I'll take care of Theresa. If you win, great. If not, well, then Theresa never has to know. - What do you have to lose? - Just $ 1000 in bar mitzvah bonds. But other than that, nothing. You in? Marty, are you in? I'm in. - I love the Vegas. - Reno was never like this. What is this place? This is the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. According to Seth, it's ground zero... ...for aging hipsters like yourself. I thought we were going to Caesar's. Caesar's didn't have a permanent Springsteen exhibit. Although they do have Celine Dion. Yet another reason we're here. - Mock if you must, but she can sing. - You're gonna regret saying that... ...on your birthday. - Yeah, really. Welcome to Hard Rock. My name is Amy. Which one of you is Mr. Cohen? Hi, Amy, we spoke on the phone. It's good to see you. Yes, good to see you. We have the penthouse all ready for you. If you will follow me. - Penthouse? - Yeah. - So whose card did you put that on? - Oh, please, the old man's. Oh, I love you, son. I love you. I love you too, Dad. Just not as much as I love Vegas. The casino, restaurants, pool and spa are all on this level. And if you'll follow me, I'll show you our bowling alley. God, there's a bowling alley? Yes, sir. It's in your room. Did you see that? I just almost bowled a strike. In our hotel room, man. I'm never going home. It's like a million-dollar frat house. I know. It's fantastic. Well, I'm gonna explore the casino. May I give you gentlemen a tour? No, I'll find my way. Thanks. - We're good. Thanks, Amy. - Thanks. Actually, you know what? We'll take that tour. Sure. I just need to see some ID. It's just a formality. We have a lot of kids under 21 using fake IDs... ...to get onto the casino floor. We'd hate to have to throw them out of the hotel. You know what? I don't think we're gonna need that tour. - But thank you for stopping by. - Absolutely. Really sweet. What are we gonna do? I don't wanna get thrown out. I love the hotel. - Me too. - I wanna marry the hotel... ...and have gambling-addicted, alcoholic kids. - We'll find another casino. - What, a youth casino? Seth, it's Vegas. You wanna find some action in this town, all you gotta do is ask. Winner. Pay the line. Yeah. Where are we doing this? No, I'm at the Hard Rock, of all places. Fine. I'm on my cell. - So where's the party? - There is no party, just a quiet dinner. Hey, have you figured out what you're gonna do with the restaurant? Not yet. You figured out what you're gonna do with that money... ...that I paid you for it? I'm putting all mine on the hard ways. Jimmy's gonna buy a house for himself and Marissa. Really? Last time I talked to Marissa, she was planning on moving in with us. - <i>ever gonna stop being mad at me, Ada?</i> I'm sorry, but does it strike anyone else as tragic that the boys are in Las Vegas... ...doing God knows what, while we sit here watching <i>The Valley</i> marathon? Hey, it's Summ's favorite show, okay? Right, Summ? - Are you crying? - No. It's a sad episode. - She broke up with Seth. - Coop. - What? Why? - Her dad doesn't approve. - Coop. - Please. You think my dad approves of Jimmy Cooper? The man's a felon. No offense. Yeah, I know. Anyway, my mom still doesn't approve of Ryan. It's like a rule. Your parents almost have to disapprove. Otherwise, the sex isn't good. - Was that an over-share? - Yeah. He kind of is my dad. Yeah, I'll get the door. - Hey. - Hey. Can I talk to you? Alone? - Let's move. - Yeah. - You want me to get you a stripper? - Not me. Julie. And I only ask because... ...you were a stripper. - Can I ask you something? - How did you get yourself into this? - I wish I knew. Does she have a picture of you wearing culottes? You don't even like Julie. Marissa's still here. And that's not entirely true. You let her walk all over you. You're upset because she's marrying Dad. Yeah, for his money. Same reason that she married Jimmy. Well, she's not your biggest fan either. So why am I getting her a stripper? Because if you don't... ...she's gonna make me take her to a place called The Petting Zoo... ...which, according to Todd in Accounting, they pet. You know what? I'll do it. If Julie Cooper wants a stripper... ...I know just the man for the job. Thank you. We live in an age of miracles. Look at them frolic. Look how much fun that is. Bowling alleys in the penthouse. You know what I'm saying? Hotel rooms? Beaches in the middle of the desert. There's so many bikini-clad women, I haven't thought about Summer since... Since you left a message on her machine? Sure, but that was 20 minutes ago. I'm feeling liberated now. Confident. Like I could walk up to any one of these women and just... ...converse. Know what I'm saying? Great, go for it. The thing is, I don't want to be rude to you. - I can take care of myself. - Yeah. But I can't. I can't just go up to a strange girl and say... Excuse me. Would you mind if I kissed you? Are you talking to me? Sorry. The Hard Rock's kind of exclusive. You can't use the beach unless you're with a guest, so I'm Jenn. - Seth. - And you are an excellent kisser. Can I buy you guys a drink? Say thanks. Yeah, I think we're out, so that... Could you hold on one second? It's Summer. - Hey. - Cohen. - Listen, I've been thinking. - Yeah. Hey, I have to kiss you again. - What? - What? Cohen? What is going on over there? You're an amazing kisser. Hold that thought, please. Hey, Summer. - Hello? - He's kissing another girl. Yes. Right in front of me on the phone. I can't believe this. I have been crying actual tears over that ass, and he's kissing randoms. Okay, you know what? We're gonna have a girls' night out. Theresa's coming over. We can do whatever you want. Really? Because all I want to do right now is go to Las Vegas and kick Cohen's ass. - She's gonna kick my ass. - Yeah. - Was that your girlfriend? - "Was" being the operative word there. I'm so sorry. I should go. I shouldn't even be here. I should go. I have a paper to write, anyway. - Yeah, we should probably go too, so... - Where are you guys headed? - Can I give you a lift? - You have a car here? I live here. I go to UNLV. English major. With a weakness for fake beaches. What about you guys? - Just visiting. - Yeah. - We're looking for a blackjack game. - It's sort of business. I don't know about blackjack... ...but a couple of guys from my class are doing this poker thing. It's a kind of intense, though. Wanna go? - Sure. - Sure. - Hey. - How'd it go with Caleb? He stonewalled me. I got nothing. Maybe he's just out here for his bachelor party. Yeah, right. A bachelor party... ...where Robert Campbell just happened to stop by... ...and pay him half a billion dollars for the coastline. So he's profiting from our loss. He's Caleb Nichol. That's what he does. He paid us a huge amount of money for that restaurant. - He's the reason I could bid on a house. - You may want to retract that bid... ...because according to Caleb, Marissa's moving in with him. Summer had to go home, but she wants us to call if we go out. I don't feel like going out much, if that's okay. Yeah. No, of course it's okay. We'll just order in. You want, like, Indian? Chinese? Sushi? No, not sushi. I can't do raw fish. Okay. Well, what about something else to drink? I think we have, like, juice, soda... Beer? No, I can't. I mean, I shouldn't. Thanks. You can't drink, you can't have sushi. What, are you pregnant? Oh, my God. Are you pregnant? - We're just playing Texas Hold'em, right? - Yep. Last time I was here, it was, like, a 250 buy-in. As in $250? Why, you play? Yeah, just for fun. Well, it was fun, until last time I lost that 250. These guys, they don't play for fun. - You do know how to play poker, right? - Yeah. I haven't played in a while, but... - How about I go buy us a drink. - Okay. - Look, we don't have to do this. - Yeah, well, what about Theresa? - Theresa's not your responsibility. - Not yours either, yet here we are. So listen... ...I love the Vegas. It's time to see if the Vegas loves me. Howdy. I haven't told anyone. Not my mom. Not Eddie. Especially not Ryan. You're the only one who knows, so... I'm not gonna tell anyone. I promise. - Do you not want to talk about this? - I've been going crazy keeping it to myself. Okay. So do you know what you want to do? I don't even have the money to get to Atlanta... ...so I have no idea how I would pay for an... I mean, even if I had the baby... ...I work in a bakery. You know, what am I supposed to do? - Well, maybe if you talked to Eddie... - No, I can't. He'll try to convince me to marry him and have the baby. - Or else he'll say it isn't his. - Who else's could it be? All in. Twenty-five hundred. Pocket aces. Hey, how you doing there, buddy? We got your bar mitzvah money, Theresa's money. Now we gotta go. No. What about the Ryan-and-Seth- going-to-Europe money, my man? - Get back in there. We can get Vespas. - Vespas? Yeah, it's Europe. Harleys. I don't know. The point is, why quit when you're ahead? If we don't, Angry Trucker Hat over there is gonna hurt me. Maybe he's not angry at you. He's angry because he found out people don't wear trucker hats anymore. Come on. I'm doing so good with Jenn, I think. Invite her back to the hotel room. It is kind of sweaty in here. I'd like to do that. But how am I gonna do that? Hey. So, Seth and I were wondering... ...if... - lf you would come to our hotel room... ...and go bowling, which is not as weird as it sounds. Are you guys staying in the penthouse? My girlfriends and I have always wanted to rent that for a night, but it's so expensive. Yeah, well, you should call them. You should bring them over. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Call them. Okay. Thanks. Now, isn't this better than some seedy Hollywood club? When's the stripper getting here? Don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise. - Surprise. - I'll get it. Maybe I better go with you. You know... ...in case it's a UPS man and I have to sign for the package. Or maybe it's a plumber and he needs to tighten my pipes. Or, you know what, what if it's...? Hailey. - What are you doing here? - Kirsten invited me, since you forgot. My memory's fine. - Crab cakes. - I can't stay. I saw a fire truck out front and wanted to make sure everything was okay. Fire truck? Is it hot in here? Or is it just me? Hailey, I said one stripper. - Hello? - Hey. Thank God it's you. There are four male strippers dressed as firemen dancing in our living room. Theme stripping, you gotta love that. Oh, wait. Now they're not dressed as anything at all. Try to keep them off the furniture. So how's everything going in Vegas? Let me ask you something. Do you find it odd that after your father... ...bought into the restaurant, as powerful as he is... ...we were still denied our liquor license? Yeah, but the guy that was on the liquor board was an ex-client of Jimmy's. So your dad doesn't know anyone on the liquor board? He knows everyone. But why would he do something like that? He was a partner in the restaurant. So he could buy us out cheap, turn around and sell it to Robert Campbell... ...for 10 times as much. Sandy, he wouldn't do that. Honey, when are you gonna realize there is nothing your dad wouldn't do? - Well, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna talk to your father. - Hey, Ryan. - Yeah. I'm proud of you, man. Not as proud as if we were on Vespas, but... - Right. - Jenn, we're gonna do strip bowling. I'm not a very good bowler, so you'll probably see my tush. Go ahead. I'm gonna catch up. All right? - Yeah. Hurry up. - Okay. Hey, I still haven't heard from you. Just want to make sure you're okay. Ryan's here. He'd like to say hi... ...so give us a call back, okay? Love you, kiddo. Been calling all day. She hasn't picked up. Everything okay? Listen. Do you know anything about Marissa moving in with Caleb and Julie? Yeah. - She finally told you? - No, she didn't. Caleb told Sandy. Is there something I should know? What? Nothing. I just don't know why he'd do that. They had a deal. Deal? What kind of deal? Move. Hi. The name is Cohen. C-O-H-E-N. I think that's how you spell it. You can pretty much see the entire strip from here. Yeah. You can see it from here too. It's very impressive. Wait till you see what happens next. I would, actually. I would like that very much, to see what happens next. The thing is, I'm kind of in love with my girlfriend, and that makes it weird. - Ex-girlfriend. Right? - That's a good point. Cohen! - Summer? - I tried to stop her. Get away from him, whore. She's not a whore, okay? She goes to UNLV. Oh, you know, I'm sorry. Skank! Hello? Did somebody order more skanks? Come on in, you guys. Ryan, Seth, this is Valerie, Shannon and Grace. Aren't you gonna introduce me? What are you doing here, Lucas? This many girls, I'm gonna need payment before the party. Wait, no. Payment? Are you...? - You're a prostitute. - I knew it! So four girls till midnight, plus, you had Jenn all afternoon. No, man, I think I've been had all afternoon. Either way, it's 250 an hour, which brings us to a grand total... ...of $5000. So, what will it be, gentlemen? Cash, check or charge? I hate the Vegas. My entire life, I've never even seen a prostitute... ...now I have four of them taking advantage of me in my hotel room. And not in a nice way. - Way to go, whore-boy. - Thanks. All right. Summer, how much money you got? I'm not giving you money. I'm not the one that was worked on. I wasn't worked on. Okay? I was entrapped. This is your fault. You broke up with me. - So you hire a call girl? - What, your dad wouldn't approve? - This has nothing to do with my dad. - Right. It doesn't. Okay. So maybe I overreacted a little. - Yeah, a little. - Lf you didn't try so hard with him... I only did that because I knew it was important to you. You swear nothing else happened with the ho? I swear. One kiss. - Maybe four. - I hope you enjoyed them... ...because if anything like this happens again, I'll kill you. You won't have to. If we don't get 5000 soon, her pimp will. Between my money and Theresa's money, it's only 3000. Three thousand five hundred. Thanks... ...but that still leaves us 1500 short. You guys did buy us till midnight. That's more than enough time for another game of no-limit Hold'em. That's a card game, not hooker talk. Well, that was some performance. Believe me... ...that was nothing. - What are you doing after the party? - Getting married. Yeah, but not tonight. Right? Let me get my purse. - Thanks for the party. - You're leaving? I'm exhausted, and the boys are getting back from Vegas early, so... Please tell me your sister's not hitting on that poor stripper. Oh, they're old friends. In fact, Hailey set this whole thing up. She did? Really? Excuse me. So, what was the plan, Hailey? Get your stripper friend to proposition me, tell Daddy about it, the wedding's off? Please, I know you'd never sleep with Jeff. He doesn't make enough money. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, you married Jimmy for his money, and now my dad. You see, Jeffrey here might be a stripper, but, honey, you're a whore. - You're going down, bitch. - Who are you calling "bitch," bitch? Oh, my God. Hailey! Stop it! Ladies! I never liked you, even when you were a little twerp! Come on! Hey, how are you? I'm meeting someone here. Caleb! There you are. I'm so glad you guys didn't start eating without me. Mr. Campbell, how are you? Sandy Cohen. Caleb's son-in-law. Former partner. - How is the food here? - Filet's excellent. - Really? - Would you care to join us? - Actually, we should just... - Don't mind if I do. So I understand that you're interested in Caleb's Balboa coastline property. I can see why. It is the perfect location. You mind? I'm parched. As a matter of fact, some partners and I recently tried to open a restaurant there. Not unlike this one, except we had two kinds of meat loaf and dirty martinis. The problem was, we could not get a liquor license... ...and for the longest time, we couldn't figure out why. - Sandy, this is not the time. - You gonna eat that? Turns out, one of our partners went behind our backs... ...to a friend on the city council and got them to deny us the liquor license. So he bought us out, and now he's peddling... ...that piece of property at a much higher price to someone else. - Robert, I have to ask you to excuse us. - The problem is, the joke's on him. Not only is he guilty of collusion and fraud, but he and his property... ...are going to be tied up in civil litigation for months. Years, if I have anything to say about it. The bottom line: That coastline property, it's absolutely worthless. What do you think of that? - I have to ask you to leave. - Hands off! You wanna go? - We'll go. Come on. I'll take you... - Sandy, don't. Let me. You think you can manipulate me?! Hold my daughter hostage?! Easy, easy. What are you doing? You beat me to the punch. We'll see you back in Newport, Dad. Come on. Go, go. Five hundred. You got nothing. I'm out. - I need you to lend me some money. - What? No. No way. You just lost, like, $3000. There's no way I'm lending you money. Then I guess you don't get paid. Look, this is not a game, okay? You and your friends could get seriously hurt. Yeah, whose fault is that? I was just doing my job. You guys were staying in the penthouse. I thought you had money. I don't understand. This afternoon you were doing so good. Now you suck. So I guess Angry Trucker Hat's feeling pretty confident right now. Wouldn't you say? You lost on purpose? I won a lot of money this afternoon. Now I need yours. Deal me in. I can't believe he gave you his angry trucker hat. He didn't give it to me, I won it. That's not really winning then. Be nice, Cohen. He paid off your pimps and your ho's. Yeah. I did lose your bar mitzvah money, though. Sorry. I lost my bar mitzvah money, okay? And I also lost Theresa's money... ...which is the only reason you came. - No, it's not the only reason. - You don't think the trip's a total waste? - No, no. We won some, we lost some. We're walking out of Vegas pretty much even. I'd say some of us are walking out ahead. I think if it were up to you, we wouldn't be walking out of here at all. - Now we have a good Vegas story. - I don't think you wanna tell people... ...that you lost your bar mitzvah money on prostitutes. Yeah, well, you know what they say, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. - I thought that was Tijuana. - I think that hat should stay in Vegas. Sorry. Definitely love the Vegas. How was Vegas? Definitely a spectacle. How were the strippers? - Surprisingly tame, actually. - That's good. Considering what happened next. - Do I want to know? - Depends. - What is it? - On how you feel about drunken catfights. Julie and Hailey? Wow. Even Vegas can't compete with that. So how did it go with my dad? Well, you'll be relieved to know I did not punch him in the mouth. That is a relief. Jimmy did. I don't think we'll be invited back to the Hard Rock. But you know what? I'm not really looking forward to getting back to Vegas. - I thought you loved the Vegas. - I do. I do love the Vegas. Because afterwards, it is so nice to come home. - Hi. - You told my dad? Your dad found out. He asked me. I had to tell him the truth. Oh, so you'll tell my dad the truth, but you won't tell me? What are you talking about? You know what, maybe you should just ask Theresa. Just tell me what's going on, okay? Theresa's pregnant.
