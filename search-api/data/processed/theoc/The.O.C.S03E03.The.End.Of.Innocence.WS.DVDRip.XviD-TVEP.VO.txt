Julie and I live happily ever after. - Will you marry me, Julie? - Sandy, I'm not coming home. I'm going to Lake Arrowhead with a friend. What am I gonna do when you're gone? I can't do this without you. Nothing I hate more then perky blonds who wanna take over the world. - Taylor Townsend? - Jack Hess, nice to meet you. - I'm getting kicked out? - No. - But Marissa is. - I want you out of here. - Get your hands off her. - Another word, you're out of school. - Don't touch her. - Ryan! Either of you ever set foot near this school... ...I call the police. This is so wrong. Like, epically tragic. End-of-the-world, locusts-and-horned-beasts bummer. It's fine. It's really not that bad. Yeah. I mean, Ryan and I don't go to Harbor anymore, but it'll be fine. - Not for me. - Yeah, without Ryan... ...it'll be like freshman year for Cohen. Slammed into lockers, shoes peed in. - Ridiculed as "Death Breath Seth." - Didn't you call him that? It was supposed to be the best year. - Not cheering us up. - You need cheering up? I'm the one who's gonna get his ass cheeks taped together. You guys should be psyched. No mean dean, no Taylor Townsend. - Urine-free footwear. - Freedom to do what you want. - Except what I want is to go to school. - Well, at least you guys have each other. If you stick together, everything will be okay. - Deal? - Deal. Hi, Mom. Okay. She wants me home right away to discuss my future. All right, we'll hook up later then? Hello? Yeah, all right. I'll be right there. - Sandy. - So...? - Have a good day? - Yeah, thanks, man, you too. Sorry. You guys, both of you have a good day together. You believe all that stuff? That you'll be ridiculed at school? Definitely. Ryan and Marissa sticking together and everything being okay? Well, if they can stick together? I don't know, they've survived a lot. I don't know that they can survive this. I need you to hold me. - Hold me. - All right. Come on. Look, I've never done this before. No, no, I am in charge. Look, it's not my usual job. So let me know when the crew shows up. Hey. Trying to keep the Newport Group afloat while Kirsten's gone? That and everything else. And I haven't exactly been making life easier for you, I know. It's not me I'm worried about, kid. It's you. Why don't you sit down. I understand everything you've been through... ...what with your brother, and Marissa and now school. You have to move past all that. - I am. I want to. - I don't think you do. Those kids at Harbor, Ryan, are no better than you. But they're working towards their future. You're sitting here. Well, I don't wanna be. - I just... - Couldn't help slugging the dean. - He had his hands on Marissa. - Which is wrong. You gotta stop thinking about Marissa Cooper and start thinking about yourself. I think you should stop seeing her for a while. Oh, come on, Sandy. Let's not overreact, here. I'm not saying break up, I'm saying take some time apart. Until you get out of this hole you've dug for yourself. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey. I have good news. I wanted to tell you in person. I need some good news. I have been on the phone all morning with Kaitlin's boarding school. They've agreed to take you. Boarding school? The more elite the institution, the more accepting they are of criminals. - Not that you're technically... - No way. I'm not going. But, honey, you get a fresh start where nobody knows you. Nobody but your sister, and I've agreed to up her allowance to keep her quiet. - I don't care who knows. - Well, you should. You've need to get back on track. Did you think you'd spend the year with Ryan, ruining your life? No, I thought I was gonna spend it with you and Dad... ...getting our family back together. Oh, honey. Okay, I won't force you to go to boarding school... ...but you have to promise me one thing. - What? - You have to stay away from Ryan. Mom, this is not his fault. Marissa, I gave you your independence, and look where you ended up: Barely escaping jail, kicked out of school. You need to listen to me. Let me and your father handle this. Look, I told you, I'll handle it. You'll get your money. Everything's under control. - Jimmy. - Hey, Sandy. So these past couple weeks have been pretty crazy. No one's been thinking straight. I know I haven't. And I just wanted to say on behalf of my whole family, I'm sorry. - I appreciate that. - Thanks. Come on in. You know, this is kind of awkward... ...because it's not the only reason why I came over. Julie and I have been living in limbo for the past couple months. It's not that we need the money... You wanna know when the lawyers are gonna read Caleb's will. If you don't mind making a phone call. Is there anything l...? I need to know? Oh, well, no. No. I mean... No, are you kidding? No, it's fantastic. I just want to give my fianc√©e a little peace of mind, that's all. Anything for the soon-to-be Mrs. Cooper-Nichol-Cooper. You know, isn't it a little immature of seniors to be giving wedgies? They were sophomores. Large, bitter sophomores. - Oh, honey. - Oh, God, don't look. - What? - I just said, "don't look." Hey, glad I found you two. What do you think about helping with <i>South Pacific?</i> I'm all for that. Oh, you meant us helping. Considering I know for a fact... ...you two were responsible for Marissa Cooper crashing the carnival... ...the least you can do is offer to be stagehands for the Drama Club. No way. Okay, I will join the synchronized swim team... ...do rhythmic gymnastics, shot put, collect stamps... ...march for women's rights, free animals from the laboratories. I'll even read comics with Cohen and his social maladjusts. But Drama Club? No. See, Taylor Townsend is the president, and... Suddenly, this all makes sense. We'd be stagehands, and Taylor would be... The director, that's correct. And the writer. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote <i>South Pacific.</i> Well, I changed some lyrics, cut a character. It was just such a good musical, it made me wish it were better. That sounds awesome. It does, yeah. But you know what? I think we're really busy. Booked up. I'm getting tired just thinking about it. Well, it is purely voluntary, of course. But unless you wanna join Ryan and Marissa in the streets... ...I'd think about showing a little Harbor school spirit. - Wow, hello. - Let's get married. Okay, the part where you propose and I say yes already happened. No, no, like right now. I mean, not right now. But as soon as possible, like Saturday. - What can we pull together in a week? - Come on. Two hundred strangers, a DJ playing Kool and The Gang, who needs it? Just the family, close friends. And we could do it here. Tasteful, understated. Maybe a breakfast thing. Mimosas, a chef making custom omelets. I like it. Yeah, I'll call Reverend Donahue. And then the honeymoon, we stock up the boat... ...sail off right after the ceremony. Two weeks in Hawaii. That'll get our heads straight. And then we can, you know, come back to reality. Oh, Jimmy, what are we gonna do? Marissa begged me not to go to boarding school. I've called every school within a 50-mile radius. Let me tell you, they all read the paper. I wish there were a way to keep the family together... ...and give Marissa the clean slate she deserves. Things won't seem so bad when we're anchored in Hanalei Bay. James... ...what is your opinion on the educational system in Kauai? Kirsten said she'll be right out. We weren't expecting you. Is everything okay? Yeah. Fine, thanks. Okay, well, I'll let you have some privacy. Thank you. Honey, what are you doing here? Not that it isn't great to see you. Oh, it's official business, I'm afraid. They're reading Caleb's will on Friday. What's wrong? It's just I've worked so hard to put my dad behind me and... - Do I have to decide? Can I think about it? - Of course. Yeah. Whatever you need to get better. I gotta tell you, though... ...at Suriak you seemed a lot more positive. Reality is a little more complicated than they tell you at Suriak. Says who? Charlotte? I've seen her on the verge of relapse, Sandy. She has stories about how you think you've hit bottom... ...and then you find a new low to sink to. - It sounds like she's trying to scare you. - She's just being honest. Sandy. All right, but let me know what you wanna do about the will. Okay. You should probably go... ...because if my mom finds you here, she'll kill you. Not if Sandy kills me first. - Marissa? - Hide. Hide. What, Mom? We don't have locked doors in this house. Sorry, I didn't know it was. So, what's up? Your father and I have decided to move the wedding to Saturday. - Great. - Then we were thinking of Hawaii. Always a classic choice. We thought we'd take you and your sister. Okay, I'm happy to work on my tan. And then we thought we'd sort of stay there. - What do you mean? - A fresh start for the whole family. Put Newport and all of our history behind us. A new life. What? No. Okay, Mom, we can't. I can't. You can, and you will. After the wedding on Saturday, the Coopers are moving to Kauai. Okay, how about this: You and Marissa run away together. Last time I tried to run away... We were ambushed by the cops. Got it. I guess you're not up for the model-home idea? I thought we might start with something that didn't involve me getting arrested. Is it my fault that our half-baked, adolescent schemes... ...go hopelessly awry, and my dad has to bail us out? Usually, yeah. - Okay, new shape. - Thank you. The Coopers are moving to Hawaii. You move also. Get a job as a scuba instructor and/or work on a macadamia nut farm. - I love macadamia nuts. - What if Marissa moved in here? - I think the nut farm has a better shot. - Why not? Marissa should be in Newport for her senior year, wherever we end up. We got room. Kirsten and Sandy are the Coopers' friends. Julie Cooper's not your biggest fan. - Where's Sandy? - My mom's office. Ryan, he's never going to go for that, man. He doesn't even want you seeing Marissa. Fine, you're gonna need ammo. Thank you. You can't leave. I won't let you. I know. Oh, no, I really mean that I won't let you. I'll restrain you if I have to. You may be tall, but I am wiry, and I have Ryan on my side. Except Ryan's part of the reason they want me to leave. - You got out of going to boarding school. - Well, because I really didn't want to go. So, what are you saying? You really want to go to Hawaii? No. No, it's just the best we can do if our family wants to stay together. Hey, it's just, for the first time, like, ever, my parents are actually happy. They've been given a second chance... ...and as crazy as it might sound, I think I wanna be a part of that. What's gotten into you, Jimmy? You've been tense for weeks. You're acting like a new man. I just feel like we're finally moving forward, you know? The will's being read tomorrow, we're getting married. Speaking of which, I told the caterer I'd meet him like five minutes ago. We're tabling a motion: turkey sausage or pork? - Why not both? - Why not? Hi. Hey, there. - That the missus? - Soon to be. Looks like this story's gonna have a happy ending. Didn't believe me on the phone? You've been saying the same thing this whole time. Why believe you now? Because now it's true. You're gonna have your money tomorrow night. Every... Every dime. That's all I wanted to hear. You're a good guy, Jimmy. I'm rooting for you. But I gotta tell you this as clear as I can. This is it. See you tomorrow night. Brought you something. A plan about how you're gonna keep your grades up... ...graduate on time, and get into college? It's a bagel. Toasted, cream cheese. I'm sorry about yesterday. I assume you're here for more than breakfast. I don't know if you heard, but the Coopers are moving to Hawaii. The Coopers? I was thinking, maybe Marissa could stay here, live with us. - You got a lot of nerve to bring that up. - Look, I get it. I don't want to be here, ask you this... ...but I care about this girl. And I can't just stand by and watch... ...as she's dragged off to some island by her paranoid mom. You and I are here because somebody gave us a break. Well, now Marissa needs one. Well... I think having Kirsten gone is making me all sentimental. Or maybe my brain is fried from doing all these real estate deals. Your plan poses a myriad of obstacles. Anything you could do, thank you. - Hey. - Hey. I was just thinking about you. - About seeing you. On Friday. - So you're gonna come? Well, I'm not exactly looking forward to it. The will part, I mean. But I think it's important for me to be there. And I think I can handle it. Then I'll see you tomorrow. Is there any chance you might... You might wanna stay after that? Let's see how it goes. - Bye, honey. - <i>I'll see you soon.</i> So you're going to the reading of the will? Sorry. Overheard. I think it's the right thing to do. Right for you or your husband? Sandy supports whatever I decide. He offered to go in my place. Maybe it's your father you're trying to please? It's a little late for that. I'm not going for him. I'm going for me. I feel great. Okay. Just, please, promise me you'll sleep on it. Okay, left. No, not stage left, my left. Okay, this way, towards me. More. Less. A little more. A little less. - And a little less, and a little less... - Okay, that is good. I was just about to say that. Oh, I love the Tonkinese beach hut. It's so romantic. Good job Summer, Seth. - Seth? - I think I nailed my shirt to the wall. He's a little disabled when it comes to handling tools. Summer, it's "specially abled." You know, it is so great that you guys have each other. - Thanks. - Yes, thank you. Because everyone knows that Marissa was the popular one. And, Seth, no judgment... ...but it's not like you got any cooler over the last two years. Everyone just acted that way because they were afraid of Ryan. Even as a senior, you're pretty much the biggest geek in Newport. Oh, no. All right, listen, skank. Just because you're saying really mean things in a really nice voice... ...doesn't mean we don't realize you're some stupid skank. Seth, Summer. We couldn't possibly be having a problem. Oh, no. No, Dean Hess. There's... There's no problem. Everything's just super. This is your idea of school spirit? One more incident and there will be consequences. - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - I think I'm still in shock. I can't believe this is happening. What would you say if I told you you didn't have to? I'd say, "What are you talking about?" I talked to Sandy, and I asked him if you could stay here with us. It took him a bit to get there, but he said he'd be able to help us. What's wrong? It means the world to me that you would do that. But? But my parents are together now... ...and we have a chance to be a real family. - Okay. - So... I'm sorry. I don't know, Marissa sounds pretty upset. Yeah, and now I don't know what to do. Nothing you can do except be there for her... ...and wrap your head around the long-distance thing. I'll hook you up with webcam action. Start your own blog. Keep her updated daily on the innermost workings of Ryan Atwood. And until then, it seems like all I do... ...is make her feel worse than she already does. - Do something special before she leaves. - Yeah. Something to remember you by... ...when she's surrounded by hot dudes and Ionely sailors. Not that that's gonna happen. I'm gonna see your mom in a few hours. Anything to pass along? Could you ask her if she's ever coming home? If we push hard and it doesn't work, we'll have ourselves to blame. Maybe if we don't, we'll never see her. The situation's a little too complicated for snide comments. Maybe I took that a beat too far. Come on. Give me a ride to school. I'll help you think of something for Marissa. - Well, you look nice. - Oh, thanks. I decided to go after all. Well, why don't I drive you? I can wait in the car, and then we can stop in Palm Springs for lunch. I ordered a car. I think I just need to go alone. You're right. Have a great time. And it's just a bunch of bureaucratic stuff. Who gets what property, bank accounts. It really won't affect me. From what you've told me about your dad... ...I'd bet he's planned a surprise for you. I just hope it's a good one. Who came up with that plan, Cohen? I did. Why? Does it suck? No, I think it's freaking romantic. - You're in? - I also think it's dangerous. - So you're not in. - No, I'm in. I'm just saying there's heavy security, spies in our midst. I'm not gonna tell you what would happen if we were... Caught doing what? Talking while we should be painting. Shut up. Your incessant chatter keeps messing me up. Yeah, that seagull kind of looks like it's got fins. - That's because it's a dolphin. - Make it a seagull. All right, black-ops maneuvers commence at 2100 hours. Synchronize your watch. - This was my plan. - Fine. What do you want to do? That 2100 thing sounded pretty cool. Then we're gonna synchronize our watches. We have to get watches. - Hey, Sandy. - Hey. Jimmy, Julie, you remember my wife. - Hi. - Kiki! - Hey. - My gosh. - I didn't know we were gonna see you. - Good to see you. - Great to see you. - Good to see you. - You look fantastic. - Thank you. Maybe I should check myself into rehab. Sorry I'm late. - Let's get started, shall we? - Great. Caleb Nichol was a very generous man who loved his family very much. Sandy gave a very nice eulogy at the funeral... ...so let's just skip the niceties, okay? Caleb's wish was to split his fortune equally... ...between his daughters and his wife. - Wow, that's... That's very generous. - I'm getting the same as Kirsten? - As I said, that was Caleb's intention. - And that's all that matters, right? What is it, Mr. Frenkel? After careful scrutiny of his account, it's clear that Caleb Nichol was broke. Broke? What's broke? Well, Caleb had a series of high-interest loans... ...two mortgages on the house, back taxes. What about the business? Why do you think he was borrowing so much money? He asked me to give this to you. - What is it? - A personal letter. He sent it to me the day he died. Honey? Excuse me. Where are you going? What about me? I mean, where's my letter? Are you saying I don't get anything? I don't believe this. Jimmy, do something. Jimmy? - What are you doing? - I should have never come. - Charlotte told me this would happen. - What? - What's happened? - This letter, Sandy. What do you think this is? Well, I don't know. Let's open it together, we'll find out. He wrote this after our fight, after I told him he was gonna die alone. I told him every problem our family had was because of him. That my drinking was because of him. Could you imagine what he wrote me back? I can't be here right now. Wait a minute. Wait, honey. Wait, wait, come on. Kirsten, don't. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. - I didn't think I'd see you today. - Why would you think that? Because it's kind of depressing around here. And I thought you might be mad at me. I'm not. If anyone understands trying to keep a family together... It's just I don't want you to feel like I'm leaving. I mean, I am leaving, but I'm not leaving you. What's important right now... ...is that you and I have the best 24 hours of our lives together. - Really? - Yeah. So come on. We're gonna maybe head down by the pier, meet Seth and Summer. Chili cheese fries, those black-and-white milkshakes Summer likes? Sure. The diner sounds great. You know, Jimmy, when I think about it, I sort of talked myself into loving Caleb. Not for the money, for the security that money brings. But I never felt safe with him... ...the way I do with you. It's not like we're gonna be poor, right? I mean, you have your business in Hawaii... ...and we'll be sailing into town on a 100-foot yacht. Aloha. You know, darn, l... I totally forgot this... - What? - It's this last minute stuff about the... The boat. Well, okay, then I'll see you at home? You know, actually, honey... ...it's bad luck to spend the night before the wedding with the bride... ...so I'll meet you here tomorrow, okay? Okay. I had no idea you were so traditional. - All right, then. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. - Hello? - Charlotte, hi, it's Sandy Cohen. - Sandy, hi. - Hey, is... Is Kirsten there? No, I expected her hours ago. Is everything okay? Well, l... I don't think so. She's not answering her cell, and if she's not with you... ...I don't know where she is. Any ideas? She didn't want to go today, Sandy. She told me how scared she was. She was afraid that the stress would cause her to relapse... ...but she didn't want to let you down. If you hear anything, would you let me know? - <i>Sure.</i> - Thank you. Well, that was just delicious. Who's tired? What is it, like, midnight? It's like 8:30. That's past my bedtime. We should get going. - See you later. - Wait, but I haven't finished my food yet. - You guys are up to something. - What? No, not at all, but we're out of here. See you at the wedding. Ryan, I'll cover for you, man. So there's a little something. Follow me. - I'm peeking. - No, you're not. - Yes, I can. I can see. - No, no. Come on, where are we? This is silly. - Did you do all this? - I had some help, but, yeah. You like it? Yeah, I like it. You wanna know how much? - Hey, Don. - Hey, Jimmy. - You're early. - You got my money? Well, to be honest, I ran into some unexpected complications... ...and I don't. I don't have your money. Don, come on, what are we, gangsters or something? I mean, no, we're rational human beings. - We're two guys talking to each other. - I'm not saying anything. Jimmy, I'm done talking. Get in the car. The car, huh? Well, I mean, all right. Yeah, I'll go for a ride. Jimmy, I'm sorry. Wait, stop. I'm sorry, but I can't do this. I have to go. What? You weren't even gonna try and stop me? - You are so not funny. - I'm kind of funny. You sure you want do to this? Because we've done a lot... ...but not this. Yeah? You know, it's gonna make it that much harder for you to leave. I know. Hello? What's wrong? Dad? Oh, my God. Hey, kiddo. What happened? I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble, Marissa. I tried to fix it. I couldn't fix it. I gotta go, and I can't take you with me. - Dad... - Look, I've been a terrible father. Marissa, l... Dad, look, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in... ...but if you have to go, then go. But if you leave, then I don't want you to come back. It's too hard to keep saying goodbye like this. Hey, watch... Watch the ribs, there. Sorry. Is there anything I can do? Yeah, you can... You can give this to your mom. I don't know if it makes any difference... ...but I really love her. Come on, let's go find your mom. Kirsten, thank God. Ms. Morgan? - Sorry to bother you. - What is it? I don't know how to put this... ...but the family that owns this place has had a change in plans. They're returning sooner than expected. Tomorrow, actually. We have a deal. It's mine for two more weeks. Well, that would be the case if your check had cleared. But since it didn't... ...how about I charge you for the two weeks... ...and you just start packing? All right, let me get you some cash. So you think you'll head back east? Actually, I thought I'd spend time at the beach. I'm home. Oh, thank God you're all right. I'm so sorry I scared you. I think I even scared myself. - Where were you? - In a sleazy motel with a bottle of vodka. But I didn't drink. Oh, Sandy, I'm sick of hiding from my life. I want to live it again. If things get messy, we'll clean them up together. Can't do this without you. I'm right here. It's an apology. Oh, my dad. Of course he'd have to be dead to say nice things. Oh, there you are, honey. Marissa, what's wrong? Where's your father? No. No. Oh, my gosh, what am I gonna do? What are we gonna do? We'll be okay. We'll figure it out together. Like we always do. Well, Summer, I'd say our first foray into musical theater was a big success. Oh, honey, if I were you, I wouldn't say "foray," like, ever. - Oh, but we did good. - Yeah. I'm gonna go get the tiki torches out of the car. Okay. I'm gonna stay here... ...and move things around till you get back, like this. - Seth Cohen, don't move. - Dean? - I never took you for a thief, Cohen. - I didn't steal anything. I borrowed it for a very good reason. My father loves musicals, okay. And you should actually think about opening up your auditions to parents... ...because his rendition of "Some Enchanted Evening," it's a treat. Wow, thief and a liar. Yeah, okay, fine, I borrowed a theatrical set... ...which I brought back unharmed and I plan to reassemble immediately, okay? - Talk about a victimless crime. - It's the principle of the thing, Cohen. Trespassing, removing school property without permission. I'm the Dean of Discipline. I'm here to set examples. Then go ahead and expel me. Rate you're going, the school's gonna be empty. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of a reunion with Ryan and Marissa. - I'm gonna keep you here, with me. - That's creepy. One month detention. Unless, maybe, you wanna give up your partner? Because I know you didn't do this all by yourself. Do you see anyone else here? I mean, I think it's pretty clear I acted alone. Then let's make it two months. Sorry about your dad. Yeah, well... ...it's like he just can't make it here anymore. I'm not mad, I just... I guess I'm just a little scared. What happens now? We stick together, things will be okay. Deal? Deal. Although it sucks I got two weeks' detention... You said you got two months. That does suck. But I did the first brave thing my whole life. I could have sold Summer out, but I didn't. It's like you're becoming a man. - Hey. - Hey, Dad, what's up? - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. Are you really home? Yeah, and I'm not going anywhere ever again. - I missed you. - I missed you too. - Hey, anyone hungry? - I'm starving, I'm starving. - I could eat. - I could eat too. All right, let's go eat. - Come on. Come on. Come with me. - Toilet paper? Come on. So your grandpa's broke. Ryan and Marissa don't go to school anymore. Jimmy Cooper just sailed out of town. I got two months of detention. That's the great thing about this place.
