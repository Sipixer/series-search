You, me, Summer, working on a comic book together. It's probably not the best idea. Little brother. Good to see you, man. -Trey's gonna be staying with us. -Just until I can find my own place. You're Ry's girlfriend. -Well, no. Well, not anymore. -Yeah, we're just friends. Friends. What are you making? Mom's hangover special? What do you mean, a pack of smokes and a fresh cocktail? Nope. Just something I picked up in prison. Oh, yeah, the old scallion and chiv omelet. I've seen Lock Up. Stallone's finest work since Over the Top. Stallone, huh? No, I'm more a Van Damme fan. Are you kidding me? Seagal, man. Yeah. A divided house cannot eat. Now, we all got to get together behind a single action hero. Steve McQueen. Steve Ma-who? My own son doesn't know Steve McQueen. People like Great Escape. I gotta go with Bullitt. He cooks breakfast and a McQueen fan. I knew I liked you. -How was surfing? -Unbelievable. -You surf? -He surfs, he sings. He technically fights crime. He could be our action hero. -Just say the word. -Think you could give me... -...a surf lesson? -Better you than me. -He's been trying to get me out there. -I have tried, I have tried. I have failed, I have failed. Julie Cooper. This can't be good. Julie is Marissa's mom. Oh, so Ryan's mother-in-law. What? What, Ryan and Marissa? What? -It's on. -Really? I am always the last to know. -There's nothing to know. -Oh, really? That's not what it looked like the other night. You coming to Marissa's rescue and all. He's chivalrous, not unlike a young Steve McQueen. People say chivalry's dead. I don't believe it. -There's nothing going on with us. -Nothing? -Really? -Ryan.... -We're taking it slow. -Yeah! -Taking it slow! -All right. Good thing she's no longer your neighbor. It's hard to take it slow with her next door. So Caleb and Julie are off on their trip. What are we gonna do without them? Well, for starters, housekeeper got deported... ...and so there's no one to stay in the house with Marissa. So I told Julie that Marissa could stay here for the week. That'll keep things at a snail's pace. I can't believe you're moving in with the Cohens. It's just for the week. Besides, this way I can keep an eye on your boyfriend. And yours. -What? I'm not dating Seth. -Coop, you know who I mean. No, I don't. I don't have a boyfriend. Right. Yeah, you and Ryan staying under the same tent drove Alex out of town. Can't imagine what will happen with you under the same roof. -Nothing will happen. -Yeah, nothing will happen in this. What? It's cute. If you think it's cute wearing something that screams, "Take me now. " Look, it's the middle of spring. It's too hot to wear flannel p.j.'s. What's gonna be too hot is you wearing this and Ryan seeing you wearing this. He's not gonna see me wearing it. But just in case.... No, I know. Don't worry, I'll handle it. I'll find a replacement. Okay, thanks. Bye. Hey, honey. What are you doing? Heading into the office. Start working on the low-income housing initiative. -So you're free then? -No. What's up? O.C. charity yard sale I was supposed to chair... -...but I'm working. -The O.C. has a charity yard sale? The donors keep half the money, so not just charity. -Yards around here are gated. -It's in a ballroom of a country club. A charity event where donors keep half the profits... ...and a yard sale with no yard. That's how they do it in the O.C. Sandy... ...I was just wondering if you could do me a tiny little favor. No. No way. Sandy, it's an honorary chair, a figurehead position. You'd be the master of ceremonies, like an auctioneer. And you know what an MC has. An unfair advantage. You know the opponent's weakness. That's right, a microphone. On a stage. With an audience. A captive audience. And a few show tunes perhaps? No. You just have to go by the club today and say hello. Just a figurehead? With a mike. Hey, men, I'm chairing the O.C. pseudo-charity, non-yard sale. -That's fantastic. -Good luck with that. I need your help. What are you doing? Well, I never thought I'd be so happy to say this, but Ryan and I have school. T omorrow you're mine. What are you doing today? -Looking for a job. -I got one for you. Me, you... ...and the Newpsies. What's a Newpsie? They're like vultures, except they paint their talons. Actually, they have somebody else paint them. -Here comes a flock right now. -Sandy Cohen. Right on time. We just stopped by to say hello and test the mike. -And you brought a friend? -Y es, indeed. Trey, meet Newport's finest. Trey came along in case we needed a little help. But I see you don't. My goodness, you guys are pros. -We're gonna get out of your hair. -Actually, it's great that you're here. The moving company we hired got a flat tire. And now we have no one to do the heavy lifting. Heavy lifting. I guess l-- I could do that. Oh, thank God. Follow me. I'll be back to pick you up in a couple hours. I'm glad he could help out. Sandy, the job of the chair is to choose table linens, flatware, centerpieces. All right, okay. I'll help Trey with the lifting. We need you, Sandy. You're the honorary chair. It's not just a figurehead position. It's not? Let me just paint a picture of what could maybe happen. It's late at night, and you're thirsty. So is she. So you meet up at the fridge. "Hey. " "Hey. " "Yoo-hoo? " "Maybe just you. Let's kiss on the mouth. " "Okay. Oh, let's French hard. " What are you doing? Hey, I gotta get going to class. I'm gonna be late. Was Seth talking about me and how awkward it's gonna be when I move in? What, you're moving in? I had no idea. Really? My mom said she called Kirsten and ran it by you guys. -No. But you're moving in? That's great. -lt won't be awkward, right? Is this awkward? -No, not at all. -Great. See you at home. Don't blame me for your sexual tension. -Hey, Cohen. -Hey. -You know what's coming out on DVD? -I sure do. Elektra. There's a reason I didn't see that crap in the theater. Come on. Since the whole comic book debacle, I promised Summer I'd dial it down. I'm in the same boat. My mom is making me donate 1 0 of these for the charity yard sale. -You're a martyr. That sucks. -Anyway, I'll see you around. Zach, I've got an idea. Why don't I donate five of mine, spare you five of yours. -You'd do that? -Yeah. We should be putting comic books behind us. -It's for charity. -We'll split the profits. -Absolutely. -Good stuff. Easy with that. That's worth thousands of dollars. Then why wouldn't they want it? It seems like a perfectly good stool. It's an antique ottoman, and it's hideous. Now, onto the bas-relief. What's this? David Pastor's father-in-law's brother ran the prop house at Warner Bros. It's from some Tom Cruise movie. This is the crystal egg from Risky Business? Well, it's not the F-1 4 from Top Gun. That is so cool. This thing must be worth a fortune. Let's see, it's appraised at 1 0,000. That's a fortune. I guess. Come, Trey. Come. Welcome to casa de Cohen. We're almost at capacity, but there's always room for one more. Well, thanks for letting me stay here. Well, I couldn't let you stay at the mansion all by yourself. So where do you want me? Good question. What are you doing with these things? Making a grand sacrifice for charity, Ryan. It's all in a day's work. When does Marissa get here? I don't know. You want another dead arm? No, thank you. I'm gonna go see if Trey's back. I wonder how it went. I didn't hear about any Newpsie knifings, so.... -You wanna go at a living room rematch? -Yeah, yeah. Let's make it a three-way. What? That came out weird. I'll meet you downstairs. Hi. -You're not Trey. -Kirsten moved him. -I'm gonna go find him then. -Okay. Right. Sorry. You know, if anyone should know about knocking... ...before entering the pool house that'd be me. Nothing you haven't seen before, right? Right. That didn't take long. Come on. Trey's inside wearing a shirt. -Hey. -Hey. -Couldn't sleep. -Me either. -Hungry? -Sure. Nice p.j.'s. Aren't you hot? I get cold. Right. How's the pool house? Weird. You know, the only time... ...I've ever slept in that bed I was with you. You guys are up early. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. -No, it's cool. -No, it's fine. I just gotta get a jump on the day. Apartment hunting. You know, I know a place that's available. -Yeah? -lt was my friend Alex's. You wanna check it out, man? No, no, I can't. I gotta help Sandy with the yard sale. Don't mess with those Newpsies. But, hey, I did my time yesterday. Well, I'm free. I could go with you. -There you go. -Thanks. Trey, just so you know, it's cool. You don't have to find a place. I love you like a brother, brother. But we're too old to be sleeping in the same room. Yeah. Besides, I think I'm getting in the way. All right, buddy. It's catch-up time. Since the pool house has been occupied, there hasn't been privacy, so this'll do. Have there been any midnight run-ins... ...involving, say, Yoo-hoo and underthing-ies? -There's nothing going on, Seth. -Okay, you be that way. All right, ottoman, work with me. You're sexy. Get nasty. Work with me, you ottoman. You little-- That's it. You're a cougar. You're a panther, and you're in the woods. -Seth! -What, what? Good save. Thing's probably worth a million dollars. Ten thousand. -lt says it's from Risky Business. -Really? Hey, dude, turn it the other way. It's got a crack in it. All right. Hello. Ladies, hey, I hate to say "l told you so"... ...but these centerpieces and those tablecloths, they clash. T aryn, I told you. Get those linens with the hemstitch. I know, Sandy. I know. I'm sorry, but you have no one else to blame but yourself. Who are you, and what did you do with my husband? Well, if it isn't our proud sponsor. -I brought the banner, and Carter. -Carter. Sandy, I had no idea you were so multifaceted. Joan, tell me you didn't order... ...those napkin rings. This is not a Mob wedding. Gosh, I thought they were kind of fun. -No. -Who wants to help me hang the banner? Ask Taryn. She's screwing up the tablecloths. Get her off the tablecloths. Okay. -Thirsty? -Yes. So you and Kirsten have been spending a lot of time working together. Long hours, late nights. Sandy, you have a great wife. I'm sorry to keep her from you. From everything she says, we should be friends. Well, here's to being friends. You, me and Kirsten. So this chick just split? Moved back to her parents, yeah. And didn't get her damage deposit back, either. So we got a decision? I got a tenant in 6A whose pipes burst. I gotta get down there before they drown. -I'll take it. -Great. I'll need first and last month's rent, plus security. That's $3000. I-- Hey, you know, what if we make you a better offer? I mean, you know those busted pipes? Trey here is quite handy. Him with a sledgehammer? Amazing. I think she means hammer, but-- But yeah. What if I became your guy? If anything breaks down, I'll fix it. I'll call you tonight with an answer. Just leave your number. Cohen, I hear you're the guy to see about the inventory. Help me. I gotta take pictures of all this crap. -Y eah. -Okay, thanks. All right, hold it up. -More. More. More. You're naughty. -Just take the picture. You're an animal in the woods. Excuse me. Are you Seth? Hey. Carter Buckley. I'm working with-- -Yeah, it's my mom. How are you? -Your mom. On Newport Living. She said you were quite the comics fan. Oh, was. Was. Zach and I here are actually moving on. Yeah, we're auctioning off our comics. Your mom said you had your own comic. We did. We almost sold it to WildStorm, save for a meltdown during the pitch. Yeah, but we're putting that behind us now. That must be hard to walk away from, your own comic. You weren't at the meeting. Cohen hasn't picked up a pencil since that fateful Valentine's Day. Well, I've actually been sort of.... You went on without me? How many issues do you have? I probably have enough for 1 2 or 1 3 stories. The perfect amount for a graphic novel. I always wanted to write the great American graphic novel. But we cannot. Yes, we can. Come on, Cohen, this is awesome. It's not even up to me. You know who it's up to? -Who's it up to? -lt starts with an S. Hello, Summer, my dearest. Okay. What do you want, Cohen? Thought you were working at the yard sale. Can't a guy just show his lady a little bit of love? Okay, I was at the yard sale. And Zach and I got to talking. Zach was there? I'm glad to hear you two are putting the past behind you. Well, about the past.... So Zach and I got to talking... ...and we're sort of chatting about our passions and our dreams. That make you think of me? That is so sweet. No, actually. Really? Because the only other passions you have besides me are Captain Oats... ...whiny music and, well, I know it can't be comic books... ...because if you bring up you and Zach and Atomic County... ...I'll kill you both while you sleep. I hope you approve of the tablecloth that I have selected for dinner. I really don't care about tablecloths, honey. I just enjoy watching those Newpsies squirm. Have I mentioned how much I like Carter? A few times, yes. After Jimmy left, I thought I'd said goodbye to my last friend. But Carter... ...I think he's a keeper. Really? Well, that's great. We're talking about hanging out next week, get some drinks. Well, I know he likes drinks. You are looking at a proud new renter. -What? Wow, congrats, man. -Thanks. -I'll get it. -Oh, thank you. We are playing.... Cohen residence. Oh, hi. Yeah, hang on. Hey, Trey, it's for you. It's the landlord. Grab it right there. -Hello. -Hey. So bad news. Your background didn 't check out. I just can 't risk making you the manager. But you seem like a good guy, so I'll hold the place for 24 hours. I'll come up with the money. Thanks. You bet. -Everything all right? -Yeah. He just wanted to know when I'm moving in. -You sure you can cover the money? -It's handled. I'll just do some work around the place until I can pay him back. I told you, I'm getting it together. -I'm proud of you, man. -Well, thank Marissa. It was her idea. Where you been? Don't worry about me, Mommy. I was over at the new place. The landlord wanted me to tape down some drywall, do a little plastering. -At 6 in morning? -Plaster's gotta dry... ...before you paint, bro. Okay. Come in. -Hey. -Hi. I was making breakfast, and I made too much. I thought you might be hungry. -No, thanks. -Yeah? Hey, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me out... ...with the apartment. But you're probably busy, so I'll come back later. Look, I overheard your call. I know he didn't take the offer. So when are you gonna tell Ryan? I'm not. You know, he really wants to believe in you. -And why shouldn't he? -Because you lied to him. It's not a lie. I've got friends. I'm gonna come up with the money. I can help you. You've done enough. And I don't need anyone else here worrying about me. I've got it. All right. But you should know, if you do anything stupid... ...it's really gonna hurt Ryan. -So, what have you got? -Our new hobby. -Baseball cards. -They're really cool. They come with gum, and they're worth all different amounts. But each month, they go up and down in value like the stock market. -They come with gum. -You talked to Summer. I dipped a toe in the comic book pool. It was icy, Zach. It was subzero. So that's it? All that work, you'll never show anyone else because of a girl? She threatened to kill us both, while we sleep. Give me one of those pieces of gum. Who's Curt Schilling anyway? I don't know. Dude, I like his uniform, though. Can I have this one? Thanks. My mom already left for the pseudo-charity, non-yard sale. Actually, I came to see you guys. My old assistant is the VP of development... ...at a graphic-novel company. I arranged a meeting. No. I'm sorry. Now, let's go. Zach, you're driving. Thanks so much, though. -Seth, do you realize what he's saying? -Yes. He's offering to kill my relationship. He's offering us a second chance. -I promised. -Dude, technically... ...you're not doing anything wrong. You said you only floated the comic book by her, not a graphic novel. They have nicer paper. So technically.... -Coop! -I'm in the basement. Well, no torture chamber down here. Lost that bet. So, what are we looking for anyway? It's for the auction. I need-- I need money for Trey's security deposit. Interesting stuff, huh? Is that pure silver? Yeah. See that mark right there? That leopard's head with a "W.E. "... ...wow, it means made in London by William Eaton circa 1 876, I think. It could be worth a couple grand. All that Antique Roadshow really paid off. Come here. Come here. I've become quite the expert. -I put one on every week. -I don't need your help. Yeah, you do. You're gonna hang yourself with this thing. There, let's see. All right. You know, these formal things... ...they seem like they're gonna be pretty boring... ...but usually something crazy happens, keeps it exciting. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. All right, there you go. I am impressed. Nice. Ready to rip off some Newpsies? -Kirsten. -Hello, Joan. -We never see you anymore. -I've been really busy with work. -Well, you look great. -Thank you. -Hey. -Marissa, where did you get that? I found this in the basement with this junk... ...my mom's getting rid of. I better get in there. -You look beautiful. -Thank you. When you think about it, our own graphic novel? That's like 1 0 times cooler than the comic book ever was. -You guys bringing back the comic book? -No. -Absolutely not. -Goodness gracious, no. It's a graphic novel. It's totally different. Oh, okay. So there's no Kid Chino or no Cosmo Girl? No you two working together, ruining our friendships? -I guess it isn't that different. -Look, I promise it won't be like before. -And we already kind of said yes. -Yeah, but just to a meeting. Okay. Any trouble... ...no more graphic novel, no more comics, no more me. -Pinky swear. -Okay. Last-minute addition? Oh, yeah. Thanks. I'll just take it in the back and tag it. Thanks again for helping out my brother. I appreciate it. Seems like things are going pretty good, right? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go see if they need help inside. I'll see you in there. Trey. I'll see you in a bit. What's up? This glass egg from Risky Business. It's probably the most valuable thing here, and now it's gone. -Trey didn't--? -Yeah. Yeah, I think he did. Why would Trey steal anything though? I mean, everything's going great, right? No. No, he lied. He didn't clear the background check on the apartment. -Why didn't you tell me? -Because I told her not to. -So you stole it? -I didn't steal it. Don't lie to me, Trey. What does it matter? These people think this stuff is junk. How could you do this, man? After everything the Cohens have done? Everything Marissa's done? Can't you think of anyone but yourself? I was thinking about you. That's why I wanted to get the money, to get out of the way. You're gonna be, because you're going back to jail. Wait. Stop. We can still get it back. I've got the money. Please. You've done enough. I'll go. Good afternoon, Newport Beach. And welcome to the O.C. pseudo-charity, non-yard sale. Yes, exactly, you get it. I'm Sandy Cohen. I'll be your host and auctioneer for this grand event brought to you... ...by Newport Living and the fabulous team... ...of Carter Buckley and the lovely and alluring Kirsten Cohen. Let's give it up for them! -What will you do? -Find the egg before anyone notices. All right. Last year we raised over $1 00,000. But only $50,000 went to charity. -Summer, come on. -What? The auction. Without further ado, let's get the auction started. What are we doing? -Stalling until Ryan's back with the egg. -What egg? Our first item-- -Hey. -Hi. -Can I help you? -Well, we're your assistants. Every honorary chair gets assistants. To assist. Let's welcome our lovely assistants, ladies and gentlemen. -Hey, where you going? -I'll tell you later. -Marissa gets to be part of the plan. -I just gotta do something. Okay. You're gonna need a wingman. Marissa and my dad are busy. -Come on, I never get to go. -Yeah, there's a reason. If I go with you, no one will suspect anything. We all know if you were doing anything dangerous I wouldn't get to go. I'm the perfect cover. -No comments about me and Marissa? -You and who? I didn't know you'd throw it. Next time. I just need a little bit of a heads-up. If you're wingman you'll have to catch the keys. Okay, folks, here's a beautiful Erté-esque statue. Y es, indeed, very fetching. What do we start the bidding at? Seventy-five dollars? I guess it's very "esque. " More "esque" than Erté. Sold to the lovely young ladies. The ram's head is going for $300. Do we hear $300? Three hundred over here. $400 over here. Five hundred fifty dollars over here! Going once, going twice. Sold for $550. Imagine what the whole beast would cost. Do I hear $2000 for the tea set? $2000. Do I hear 2500? Twenty-five hundred dollars. Wow, okay. Three thousand dollars? Three thousand. Thirty-five hundred? $3500. Do I hear $4000? Come on, folks, reach into those deep pockets. -Five thousand. -Five thousand dollars? Five thousand. Do I hear $5500? Fifty-five hundred dollars? Anyone? Fifty-five hundred dollars. All right, going once. Going twice. Sold! For $5000 to my lovely bride who, apparently, is just crazy for tea. This is it. Must be in the back. You stay here. What are you gonna do? -I don't know. -Okay, I've got a plan. The kind that made me all-camp Capture the Flag. And it is extremely stealth. This next one is a very exciting one. Folks, who here is a T om Cruise fan? -Do something. -What? Why? Trey stole it. Ryan went to get it. -What do you want me to do about it? -Ladies... ...please bring, straight out of 1 983-- My shoes! Yeah! Which are vintage. Your shoes? -How about we auction these off? -What are you doing? Everything's been auctioned off. -Do we hear $30? -Other than, you know.... I know, and it's up next. So think of something else to auction... ...or Summer's gonna be selling herself. Thirty dollars! Thirty dollars, anyone? Sixty. -Sixty dollars. -Foot fetish much? Sold! -Hello. Pleased to meet you. -Who the hell are you? Well, I'm Pippins McGee, and I'm from the Film Preservation Society. And what we are doing is we're putting on a T om Cruise retrospective. Now, I understand that you are in possession... ...of the crystal egg from Risky Business? Hi. How are you? What we' re doing is we' re collecting Mr. Cruise's props... ...from his most memorable films and putting them on display. We've got the rum bottle from Cocktail. We've got the ceramic mask from Vanilla Sky. We've got the little kid from Jerry Maguire. He's in the car. Are you interested in meeting him? -Yeah, cool, man. Get lost. -Wait. How does he know about the egg? How does he know about the egg? How do you know? How do l? -How do you? How do l? -How do you know? -How do I know about the egg? -Yes. Mr. Cruise had it outfitted... ...with a transmitro pneumonic transmitter device-tronic. It's sort of a homing device. Must be a Scientology thing. Mr. Cruise does it to his favorite props. -Let's kill this guy, man. -Hey! Hey. What the hell is going on? -Seth, go deep! -This never worked in P.E. All right. This is unexpected, but in a good way. We have a new addition to the auction. They clean. They mow the lawn. They look good in suits. We're talking about two of Newport's most strapping young men... ...Zach and Trey. -Where do we begin the bidding? -Eight hundred. -Ryan, I caught it. -That's great. Run! And now, the item you've all been waiting for... ...since there is no thing and no one left to be auctioned. That's right, folks, finally, the crystal egg from Risky Business. Ladies. -Ladies. -Yeah. So you've all heard of a silent auction. For this item, we thought it might be fun to do a blind auction. Since you can't actually see the egg, we thought we would describe it to you. So it's egg-shaped. And it's made of crystal. And, well, Tom Cruise touched it, so that's hot. That's hot. Let's start the bidding at $5000. $1 0,000. Going once. Come on, we're talking about a major piece of motion picture history here. $1 0,000 going twice! Reach into those deep pockets of yours. Come on, folks! $1 0,000 going three times. Going. Going. Yes! Going and sold to the beautiful young lady right here at the front. Gentlemen, please present the egg to the very proud owner. Ladies and gentlemen, that's it for today's auction. The bar is open! Looks like the lronist and Kid Chino... ...with a little help from Cosmo Girl and Little Miss Vixen, saved the day. It's like an issue of Atomic County. Nope, just life with Trey. Thank you for your help. I don't know what you were up to... ...but I'm betting it had something to do with Trey. He sings, he surfs, and he reads minds. And it's still not enough to get you to talk to me. The next time something comes up, come to me. So I earned $400 auctioning myself off. I figure that's a start, right? I got you the money you need. I sold something from our basement. I said I'd help you. I just wish you'd heard me. I screwed up. I know. I just... -...wanted to do it on my own. -You don't have to do it on your own. Yeah, I do. Because there's no way Ryan's ever gonna forgive me. And I don't blame him. I'll talk to him. Thank you. And I'm gonna pay you back. If you told me you wanted that tea set, I would have just given to you. Well, my mom would've been proud to have her tea set auctioned for charity. It's okay. I thought it was lost. My dad's not a big fan of tea. What are you gonna say to him? Nothing. In the morning, he's gone. I don't care where he goes. Well, he's going to Alex's old apartment. I got him the money. Legally. Thanks. You cold? Yep, always. I do wear flannel pajamas. Thanks. Sorry. Hang on. It's my mom. Well, is everything okay? Okay. All right. Bye. I guess my mom came home early. She wants to pick me up in half an hour.
