- Don't move. - I didn't steal anything. One month detention. Unless you wanna give up your partner? They're reading Caleb's will on Friday. From what you've said about your dad, I'd bet he's planned a surprise for you. - Caleb Nichol was broke. - Broke? Ryan and I don't go to Harbor anymore, but it'll be fine. At least you have each other. If you stick together, everything will be okay. - Deal? - Deal. Newport Union. Orange County's answer to public education. - The parking lot looks spacious. - Yeah. And well-lit. You know, at night, with the lights. Plus you're on a hill. Probably get a good breeze. That's important. Good breeze can make the difference. Shut up about the breeze. You're not helping. You think the lights in the parking lot are making her feel better? - Guys, it's gonna be fine. - Are you sure this is what you want? I don't really have a choice. Even if I hadn't got kicked out of Harbor, my Mom can't afford private school. Well, I told you, you can always homeschool with me. I know, but I really think this is gonna be fine. Honestly, it's nice to be somewhere... ...where everybody doesn't know every detail about your life. - You don't have to be always stared at. - I could see that. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - All right, I'll pick you up this afternoon. Looks like she's in the wrong place. - Where did she come from? - Probably one of these rich girls. Check out Newport Barbie. And that was the last they ever saw of her. Here you are, my little Social-Chair maven. Thank you. Don't put it there. That's the catering order for Saturday. And that's my calculations for the streamers. You can put it there on the contract for the DJ. I'm sure Dr. Bootyopolis wouldn't mind a little coffee. You know, I always thought that Social Chair was a ceremonial position... ...like Rose Bowl queen or president. How did Marissa do it all? Cohen. Took a tour of the boys' locker room last night. I'm surprised the entire track team doesn't have trench foot. So I'll see you there at 3. Okay. You sure this is detention? It's got more of... ...a work-release feel. Like I said, you give up the person who helped you steal the tiki hut... ...and this can go easier. On both of you. Sorry. It was just me. Three o'clock. We'll start with the toilets. - You've got to let me tell him. - No way. He's upset still because Ryan humiliated him at the carnival. This is my call. You plan the dance, you leave the toilets to me. - I was hoping that'd sound more heroic. - I got it. It's okay. Hey, there you are. I just got off the phone with your tutor. She's got a great résumé. Tutored Stallone's kids. This is awkward timing, but what do you think about me going to Newport Union? Newport Union. With Marissa. Private tutor's really expensive. - I have been to public school. - Ryan, Ryan... She's going through a tough time. Caleb left them nothing. Her dad took off. - Neither is your responsibility. - Fine, why do I need a reason? You need to focus on getting your life back on track. You need to start thinking about college and about SATs. All right? - All right. - That's it, kid. - Hey. - Hey. A little morning gardening? Oh, I thought I'd put in an herb garden. Dr. Woodruff says we should confront our fears. Mine is my cooking. - So is mine. - We'll confront my cooking together. If that doesn't work, I'll buy dinner. I'm gonna take a shower. You know, you don't look so clean yourself. - You think? - No. I ju... I just showered. Did I tell you how glad I am you're back? Yeah. And I like hearing it. - Julie Cooper-Nichol? - Yes. May I help you? This house and its contents are being seized for repayment of debt. You have 48 hours to vacate the premises. I'm sorry. - You did not just walk into me. - Sorry, I wasn't looking. Was I supposed to just see you coming and step aside, princess? No, it's my first day and I don't know my way around yet. Fine, I'll let you go. - Tell me you think you're better than me. - What? Tell me you think you're better than me and I'll let you go. - I don't. - So now you're lying to me? So you think I'm stupid too? Hey, Heather. You welcoming a new student? I can take over if you want. Whatever. Thanks. I don't know why she's got it in for me. My guess is the bag... ...and the shoes. And the Chanel necklace probably isn't helping either, but it's just a guess. Anyways, welcome to Newport Union. - I'm Casey. - Marissa Cooper. You're the first nice person I've actually met. And I'm not even that nice. Hey, Beth, that's supposed to be an octagon. Eight sides. Not three. You need something? Hi. I thought I'd see if you needed any help with the dance. No. Okay, Summer, look. I know I can be a pain. A pain? Taylor, you staged a power play at the Kickoff Carnival. You tattled to the dean and got Ryan kicked out. - I don't have any friends. - Well, gee, there's a shocker. I know. And it's my fault. l... I don't trust people and so I try to control them... ...which then drives them away... ...ergo, no friends. - I'm working on it with my therapist. - Don't quit. But I decided that this year was gonna be different. I thought if I was Social Chair then people would like me... ...but I screwed that up as usual. Okay, is this where I feel sorry for you? Okay, look. I'm sure people write prose poems in your yearbook... ...about what an incredible friend you are. You know what I get? "Have a nice summer." But it's my senior year. And I wanted more. I want someone to write, "I'm glad I finally got to know you." Go show Beth what an octagon is. Oh, God, she is a pinhead, isn't she? Yeah, see, that's the kind of thing I've gotta keep in check. Either you're the worst thief ever or it's your first day. I can't remember which locker is mine. Well, it probably isn't that one, because that's mine. - Right. Sorry. - It's all right. The vice principal has the assignments. I'll walk you over there. I got a lot of experience being sent to the vice principal's office. Thanks, but my boyfriend's gonna show up. - Well, you can throw your books in here. - Thanks. - I'm Marissa. - Nice to meet you, I'm... Johnny. - Hey. - Hey, Johnny. What's up? - You guys. - Sorry. I'm okay. This is Casey, my girlfriend. Oh, yeah, actually, we've met. So I see you survived your first day. I think I hurt something. And that's Dennis. Childress. Everyone calls me Chili. No one calls him Chili. Not if you keep telling people that. I'm trying to get a nickname, handle, hook. You wanna come with us? We're gonna get something to eat. - Marissa's waiting for her boyfriend. - Boyfriend? That's gonna be a problem for me, because I love you. - I fall fast and hard. - On a skateboard. Hey, what if we just gave you a ride home? Yeah, wouldn't you rather come tomorrow knowing a few people? Even if one of them is Chili? Hey, the nickname's sticking. Come on, what do you say? Yeah, okay, let me just make a call. - Hey. - It's me. I was gonna see if you'd left. Some people asked me to get food and I should try and make friends. But if you've already left, then... - Ryan? - Go ahead. I was just getting in the car. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Just call me later, okay? - Okay. Bye. All right. Good morning. You have a second? Yeah. Sure, what's up? How would you like to stay with Summer for a few days? Sure. Any reason? Oh, it's such a mess. I told Caleb's lawyer we were thinking about moving. He thought that meant we had a place, so he put this house on the market. - We're getting kicked out, aren't we? - Of course not, it's just... Mom, Caleb was broke. It makes sense we'd have to sell everything. You don't have to protect me. Then would it be okay if you stayed until we got back on our feet? We will get back on our feet, and we'll wear very expensive shoes when we do. - I trust you. - You do? I know we've had our differences... ...but if there's one thing I'll say it's, you're a survivor. So if you say we'll make it, I believe you. Honey, thank you. Sure. Besides, you must've saved a lot of money over the years, right? Of course. - Hello. - Hi. - Kirsten Cohen? - Yeah. - These are for you. - Thank you. Thanks for letting me stay with you on such late notice. You know, I always wanted a sister. Cohen got Ryan as a brother, it makes sense that I get you. Oh, God, Ryan. I'm supposed to be having breakfast with him. I totally forgot. - Hey. - I am a terrible girlfriend. - No. - Hey. This is my top. I knew you had it. - Are you with Summer? - Yeah. - My mom and I are getting kicked out. - What? We found out this morning, which is why I had to pack and move into Summer's. I just totally forgot about breakfast. It's fine. With everything you're going through, don't worry about me. Just... I don't know, I'll pick you up this afternoon. Okay. Thanks. What else of mine do you have in here? - Hello. - Kirsten, it's Charlotte. Oh, hey, Charlotte. How are you? I'm sitting here staring at the lake and wishing my friend was here to share it. - The flowers were beautiful, thank you. - <i>Oh, I'm glad you like them.</i> I'm gonna be in the area, I was hoping we could meet. Lunch or coffee? Oh, lunch sounds great. Great. How about the Newport Bay Yacht Club? Sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow. Let's say 1:00? Perfect. Bye. Finally. She better come through with that money. Trust me, she will. - And she loved her flowers. - Right. I really don't have time to tutor you right now at the moment, but... - Summer. - Wait, just a second. I was up all night going over the dance budget. I don't know how the school expects us to... - Come here. - What are you doing? Okay, if I tell you this, you did not hear it from me, okay? I mean, this has to be secret. I'm talking Deep Throat before he went public to cash in on the fat book deal. What are you talking about? I was walking by the teacher's lounge, and I heard Dean Hess telling Dr. Kim... ...that he knew Seth hadn't stolen the tiki hut alone. Which, by the way, I forgive him for. - Taylor. - Okay. But if Seth didn't tell him by the end of the day who the other person was... ...he was gonna suspend him. - Oh, my God. Are you serious? - What's the matter? Oh, hey. Taylor was just telling me... ...that Dr. Bootyopolis was found on a pedophile website. We've got to replace him. Taylor, you know, good job. Yeah, no problem. I'll see you later. - Okay. - Okay. I still can't believe you're letting her help. You know, she's not so bad. A pedophile website? What was she doing on it? Just give me a few minutes. The quiche is almost ready. The quiche? For lunch? I could get used to this. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I put this off as long as possible... ...but we really have to make a decision about the Newport Group. Okay. What's the situation? I've done my best to stay on top of things... ...but Caleb's financial troubles have left a huge hole in the company. Pretty soon all that will be left is the name. How long before we default on our loans? Six weeks. It's not too late to rescue it, if that's what you want. We could sell off some assets, restructure the debt. - Option two? - Sell everything and walk away. I'm behind you either way. And just so you know, this family is fine financially. So don't make this decision thinking that we need your income. We don't. It's time to let it go. I'll handle everything. Come in. Dean Hess? Hi. Look, I... I helped Seth steal that tiki hut. Or borrow it. Whatever. - I had a feeling you helped out. - Helped out? Please, I did all of the work. Old noodle-arms, he couldn't even lift a palm-tree leaf without... Anyway, that's the truth. You know, Summer, with this on your record... ...I can't very well allow you to remain as Social Chair. Wait, look, please, I really have grown to love that job. Wait a second, who would replace me? Taylor? Well, Taylor is pretty qualified for the position. I'll let her know you suggested her. I'm such an idiot. You were never gonna suspend Seth, were you? You're late for class, Summer. - Sandy. - Julie. Have a seat. What can I do for you? Oh, it's such a small thing, really, just... What exactly are the rules about loans to company officers? In this case, former officers? You want a loan from the Newport Group. I could pay it back within a year, tops. Two, outside. Well, first off, you can't take personal loans from a company. People go to jail for that. Secondly, in a few weeks, there isn't gonna be a Newport Group anymore. - What? - Kirsten's not coming back to work... ...so we're gonna liquidate the company. It's... It's... It's all really ending. Hey, forgive me for asking... ...but where do you stand? Kirsten and I could lend you... No, no. The loan was just for convenience, to put a down payment on a house. I found this really great place on the beach. I'll just sell some stock, you know. I have too much anyway. You get back to your liquidating. Please, tell Kirsten I'll stop by soon, I promise. Sure. - Summer. - No. So you know, you and your friend, the dean, may have won this round... ...but the war is not over. Well, unless you have an exit strategy, don't even get out of the boat. I am a human quagmire. What's a quagmire? Hello? Anyone? Quagmire? - and she said just meet her here. I don't know if I... You thinking of going? - I don't know. Does it have a theme? - Theme? Yeah, like "Winter Wonderland" or "Under the Sea." I think the theme is... ...school gym, bag of pretzels and Chili spikes the punch. - Pretty much the same theme every year. - I don't think I'll be going then. Not because it doesn't have a theme. No, look, I know I made it sound like not much fun... ...because it isn't, but you should go, really. Dennis and Casey and I are going. We'll all not have fun together. Excuse me. Hey, I just wanted to apologize about yesterday. - l... I was acting like a jerk. - Don't worry about it. So then you're not gonna shoot me? Isn't that why you got kicked out of that private school? Because you shot someone? Marissa. Don't listen to her. Why? She's right. That's why I'm here, and now everyone's gonna know. Yeah, well, everyone already kind of knew. I just thought if I came here, then maybe I'd get a second chance. Look, I saw the news. I know you did what you had to do. They said you saved someone's life that night. Not a lot of people would do that. Come on, let's go find Casey. - What's going on? - Ryan. Hey. What's wrong? What did you do to her? Nothing. I'm fine. - This is my... - Boyfriend, I'm guessing. Okay. I'll see you guys later. - Johnny. - It's cool. He was just trying to be nice. - Hey. - Hey. Dead or Alive's playing at the Lido. You, me, yakuza bloodbath. We're there. Yeah, I can't. Miss Reed really loaded me up with a lot of work, so... Not buying it. Looks like we got an emotional thing going on. All right. Come on, buddy, get ready. A little old-fashioned Seth-Ryan time. All right, fine. So yesterday I went to pick up Marissa at school... Marissa. Didn't see that one coming. - Continue. - Thanks. - and I thought I saw this guy... I misjudged the situation. And I overreacted... ...and I might have maybe embarrassed her. I embarrassed her. Now you're tearing yourself apart... ...wondering if you've damaged her standing at school... ...but also your relationship. - More or less. - Well, that is a pickle. - That's it? No advice? - What advice? Call her. Apologize. It's not rocket science. Man, you homeschool kids are pathetic. - Why aren't you going to the dance? - Gee, I don't know. Because I went from being the girl no one knows to the girl who shot someone. You said the surfer guy was cool about it. - Yeah, he was. But... - But nothing. - Call and tell him that you're gonna go. - Well, what about Ryan? He looked like he wanted to kill Johnny. - And it's not like I'd go without him. - You have to. Harsh, I know. But you're at a new school, and there is a dance. It's like Social Survival 101. - It's Ryan. - Okay, time to go Mystic. I need to even out. - Hey. - Hey. How you doing? Good. Good. Listen, about yesterday... It was my fault. You know, I was just upset. Your reaction was normal. Okay. So you wanna go to the movies later tonight? I could beat up the usher, get us some free Milk Duds. Actually, I was thinking of doing my homework. It's the first week and I wanna make a good impression. Sure. But I'll probably need a break, so we'll talk later, okay? Yeah. Yeah, sounds good. - Hey, you. - Oh, hey. - It's great to see you. - Oh, you too. - You look amazing. - Oh, thank you. So do you. - It was all that time at my dad's. - Such a wonderful place. How lucky were we? I mean, to be able to go someplace so peaceful. It's a shame everyone can't stay there. Well, what if there was a place, like the lake house... ...where women could go between rehab and the real world. That would be amazing. That's what investor friends of mine thought. I've pitched the idea to people. I started looking at properties. I'm thinking Sedona. And then I realized, "Kirsten has to be a part of this." - You mean invest? - It would just be a couple million to start. I'll assume most of the risk and you'd get it all back within the first few years. Well, I'm flattered, but I don't have that kind of money. Oh, please, don't be so modest. I wish I was. When my father died, he left nothing. Really? I... I'd just assumed... I mean, after the reading of the will, everything was great. Everything is. Things with Sandy and my kids have never been better. Well, that is so wonderful that you've got your priorities in place. So, what about the Newport Group as a silent partner? I'm selling it. It's riddled with debt and unpaid loans and I just figured... Better to rid yourself of every last vestige of your dad. - Well, I don't know if I'd put it that way. - It's classic, Kirsten. You're hoping that by closing up shop, your issues with your dad will disappear. - It's not like that. - I've been there. It's so great that you're trying to put the past behind you. It's just not that easy. I'm sorry, I don't want you to be disappointed... ...when the issues remain even after the company's sold. Well, anyway, invest or not, you are welcome anytime. Sedona's beautiful. So, what's good here? Oh, no, not you again. Hey! Please don't make this more difficult than it has to be. More difficult? Who are they? Wha...? What are they doing? If you haven't done so, I suggest you pack your personal belongings. The deputy is here to see you don't interfere with the movers. Oh, my God. Sum, your door. Summer? - Surprise. - Hey, what are you guys doing here? - We're taking you to the school dance. - Oh, thanks, but I'm not going. - You could be my date, Marissa. - Way to bait the hook, Dennis. It's a school dance, you gotta go. If you don't show, people might talk. You'd hate for that to happen. Besides, since we're not leaving without you, you'd be ruining our night too. - Yo. - Hey. - Stocking the larder? - Mom's making lamb ragout, it's French. Now, where you headed...? Where are you headed? A dance. There's a beach theme. I'm gonna drop in on Marissa, see if she needs a break, maybe grab a bite. - Well, you're welcome to join us. - You two have fun. Enjoy. I got everything on the list, including Chunky Monkey, but that's mostly for me. All right, it's all for me. Thanks, sweetie. Is everything okay? If you're not up to cooking, we can order in. - It's a lot safer. - No, no, it's just... I'm doing the right thing, closing down the Newport Group. - I'm not hiding, right? - Hiding? No. You're putting the past behind you. What is it? Nothing. We forgot the oregano. I'll be right back. - You never mentioned oregano. - I forgot. I'll be back soon. All right, here we go. - Check you out, girl. - It's about time. - I thought Marissa was studying. - So did I. See, that's the problem with the surprise pop-in. Ryan, hey. - He looks kind of mad. - Yeah, I think that's his look. I'm gonna go get Summer before things get awkward. - I thought you were studying tonight. - I was. - He your lab partner? - There's this dance in Newport Union. - I was gonna tell you, I just didn't... - Is this about yesterday? No, I swear. Hey, I wish I didn't have to go to this. Being there every day alone... I mean, I really need these friends, Ryan. You're right. You should go. She's coming. All right. - You okay? - Fine. Have fun. Hey, man, I'm sorry about all the confusion. A heads up would've been great, woman. - Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of her. - Sure. See you. Time to add a little flavor to the punch. Get this party started. Now it's officially a school dance. Hey, you know what? Will you just excuse me. - Marissa, wait. - What am I supposed to do? They're all staring at me. That is exactly when you get in there... ...throw down a little cardboard, make it happen. - Cut a little rug. That's what I'd do. - Yeah, but I'm not you. Yeah, you got that to be thankful for. A little hurtful, but a good point. Look, public-school kids... All kids, really. - they're like dogs. They smell fear. And they like Frisbees. You just gotta go back and act like they're not looking at you. - Come on, what do you say? - Come on. Come on. If it'll make you feel better, I'll show you some moves. I'm just worried about Ryan. I feel like... ...he's feeling left out... - Yeah. Well, do you like it? I know it's not like Marissa's dances, but... Summer, it's incredible. - Yeah? - It's like you've brought the ocean to us. - You're my little human tsunami. - Thanks. Hi, everybody. Everyone, hi. I'm Taylor Townsend, your Social Chair... ...and I would like to thank you all for coming. - Relax. She's not taking credit for it. - Thank you. So this dance has been my baby now for quite a while. Okay, she's taking credit for it. I am going to kill her. But there is one person without whose help... ...none of this could ever have happened: - See, she's gonna... - Dean Hess. - Thank you. - I am going to kill the both of them. - Wait. - So everyone have fun... ...because this really is the end of summer. You kind of set yourself up for that one. I knew it. I knew this plan was crap. Spending 30 grand to go to rehab to find a mark? It made sense. Every woman there was vulnerable and rich. Except the one you picked. What are we supposed to do now? Listen, this woman is the princess of Orange County, okay? I will find a way to use her. Okay? I am not gonna let Kirsten Cohen get away. I didn't know you kept oregano stashed in here. - Hey. - Hey. - Recognize this? - Sure. It's the Groth building on Ocean. Built in 1922. It was gonna be torn down... ...and I convinced my father to restore it. It was my first project. All those years... ...he was on the other side of that wall, and no matter how hard I worked... ...I was never gonna reach him. Honey, we can keep the company. No. I just needed to say goodbye. - I guess it's too late for dinner. - How do you feel about a picnic? - Hey, man. - Hey, man. I just wanted to see how you're doing. I'm great. How's the dance? Good. I sent Summer for a cool-down lap around the building. Listen, I just wanted to make sure... ...you're not taking this Marissa thing too seriously. Seth, it's fine. I get it. Yeah. Okay. I just wanna make sure you don't think she's pulling away or, you know... ... you're gonna look back on tonight and say: "That's when I started losing her, I should have done something. " I'm here to tell you it's not gonna happen. I'm talking, like, zero chance. Right. Okay. Well, I just... I wanted to make sure you knew that. Yeah, look, I gotta go. Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later. Can I get the check? Ryan. Hey. - Seth, what are you doing here? - I'm here to stop you. If that means getting between you and the gym... ...I'm only gonna ask that you spare my face. It's okay. You're not gonna rush in? I'd just ruin it. You're doing the right thing, man. You're not gonna lose her. Can you give me a ride? My left leg's really tired. This is Seth. It's 2005, you know how these things work. Co-hizzle? Where are you? You said you'd only be gone like 10 minutes. Oh, my God. Get off me. No, I'm not about to go there... This is different, my lord. - <i>It begins here...</i> - <i>Different in what way?</i> I've just brought treasure back to Egypt that was stolen... ... from a tomb like this three nights after the crypt was sealed. Are they all like these? Summer, hey. Sorry, Ryan, he need... Seth, shut up. There's something important I have to tell you. Summer. Enjoying the dance? - What's so important? - Nothing. Just dance with me. What? What? Hey. Hey. I just wanted to tell you how important it was for me to go to the school dance. - I know. - But... ...I spent the whole time wishing you were there. My life just doesn't work without you. And it always goes so smooth when we're together. Thanks. - So I'll make you a deal. - Yeah? Whatever song comes on the radio next will be our song, okay? Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I like it. - This is definitely us. - No.
