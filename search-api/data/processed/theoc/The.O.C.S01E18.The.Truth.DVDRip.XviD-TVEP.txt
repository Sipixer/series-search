That you stole from her locker? If she finds out, you guys are done. - The interior design job, I want it. - We've found our girl. Am I dating the female me? Like me, but as a girl? People can be really unpredictable. I can't believe you stole it. How can you say he's not in love with you? I can't do this anymore. You and Marissa aren't supposed to be together. - I am not gonna let this happen. - Who's gonna believe you? Stay away from her! You're not having breakfast? Not really hungry. Dr. Kim just called to let us know that you've been suspended, indefinitely. Until the disciplinary committee... ...can figure out whether or not they want to expel you. I know you want me to say I'm sorry, but I'm not. Oliver admitted it. Right to my face. He told me he wanted me gone so he could get to Marissa. Then why would he drop the assault charges against you? - He did that? - Yeah. I mean, it seems to me that if he had it in for you... ...if he wanted you gone, you'd be back in juvie already. I mean, you know that, right? Come on, help me out here, would you? Tell me what's going on. Oliver's dangerous. This is what I know: You attacked him. Period. You're on probation. You knew the slightest infraction would result in you being taken from us. And you did it anyway. For the life of me, I can't understand why. Talk to me. Come on, Ryan, talk to me. What's the point? You won't believe me. It's not about what I believe. I wish it was. It's about what you did. The next time you feel like raising your fist... ...you had better open your mouth and talk. I'm here for that. What am I supposed to do? I can't ground you. I'm not gonna chain you to the wall. You want to go after that Oliver kid? Go ahead. The door's open. But if you want to stay, if you want to be part of this family... ...you're not gonna go anywhere or do anything... ...you're not gonna see anyone, unless Kirsten and I say it's okay. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. So Ryan just, like, punched him for no reason? That's what Ryan does. He punches people. He doesn't talk to them, and he doesn't listen. He had to have a reason, though. I mean, yeah, Ryan's violent, but he's not stupid. He just... I don't know. He thinks Oliver's in love with me or something. Well, isn't he? - A little? - We're just friends. Okay! I mean, Oliver's, like, the only guy in my life who isn't jealous... ...and scary and breathing down my neck all the time. And he actually tells me what he's thinking. Unlike some people. So are you and Ryan...? We broke up. Whoa, Coop. So that means that we're both single now. Which... ...rocks! Right? No more Ryan. No more Seth Cohen. We're totally free. Liberated. In fact, how about I treat us both to a little Burke Williams today after school? A little facial, a little massage... I can't. I promised Oliver I'd help him study after school. Oh. Well, how about this weekend? My dad's taking Kaitlin to my grandma's... ...and I have to spend the weekend at my mom's. Apparently, she's got this mother-daughter marathon planned. - Well, then when are we gonna hang out? - Soon. Hey, you coming? Well, even if Ryan gets expelled, he's still gonna live with you guys, right? - Your parents aren't gonna kick him out. - No. I don't think so. Well, is he okay? He's not the one who got punched in the face. I'm talking about in the larger sense, Seth. I guess. I don't really know. - Haven't you talked to him? - No. What am I supposed to say? I don't know. "Are you okay?" "Is there anything I can do?" That's the thing. There's nothing I can do. I begged him to stay away from Oliver, and he didn't listen to me. Look, you don't know Ryan that well, okay? You don't understand. I'm trying. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - How is everybody? - Good. - Good. - Good. Good. Okay, this is really... - Weird? - Yeah. - Just because you and Ryan aren't... - Doesn't mean we can't... - Exactly. - Right. - So is he okay? - What up? What up? So, what are we doing this weekend? Ski trip? Mammoth? Six to 8 inches of fresh powder tomorrow. Oliver, your lip. I was hoping it had already made the transition from scary to sexy. Not yet, huh? - Walk you to Western civ? - Sure. - Bye, you guys. - Bye. - Wow. Oliver seems almost... - Happy? Yeah, well, why shouldn't he? He has Marissa all to himself now. What? I think I made a mistake. - By leaving Ryan home alone? - By bringing him home in the first place. Sandy, he's a good kid. He's not perfect. But we'll work it out. We always do. Everything's gonna be okay. Who'd have ever thought you'd be telling me that? - Kirsten Cohen? - Yes. - You shouldn't be here. - I'm sorry? We have a work order from Julie Cooper. Excuse me, sir. There must be a mistake. What are you doing here? You were going to lunch. - We ordered in. Deli? - Oh, hi, Sandy. No, thank you. Julie, what is going on? Well, as the Newport Group's new design director... ...I've decided to give the office a much-needed facelift. Wait till you see your furniture, Kiki. It's very fresh. Very Danish. - Very "hello." - I'm sure it is... ...but you can't just initiate a redesign. - You need approvals. - Caleb said it was okay. Oh, if Caleb said it was okay... My coffee table! Kiki, what's going on? Some man in a jumpsuit... ...just made off with my massage chair. I want my chair. I want my desk. I want my office back. By the time we get back from lunch, you'll have it and love it. You want to join us to celebrate my new position? Oh, I'm not gonna touch that one. - No, we're okay. - Okay. I have work to do. Don't worry, honey. You said it yourself. Everything's gonna be fine. Come on. You have to go. We both could use the weekend away. It'll be my treat. I can't. Besides, I'm the one who should be treating you. You wouldn't have gotten hurt if it weren't for me. Hey, that was Ryan, not you. What did we learn in therapy? Say it with me now. "We are responsible for our own actions." Hey, what's up? Luke, help me convince Marissa to come to Mammoth with us. - Who's going to Mammoth? - Not me. My dad's out of town, so I'm gonna be at my mom's. Which means she'll be next to Ryan, which is not good for her right now. - Well, isn't that kind of up to Marissa? - Look, it's not a big deal. It's fine. Okay, so let me at least get you and your mom a suite at the hotel. That way I'll be there, and you won't even have to think about Ryan. Look, this is probably her now, already checking up on me. - It's Ryan, isn't it? - You're not gonna get it? - She's not talking to Ryan. - Is she talking to me? - Or are you doing her talking now? - Luke, don't. - Marissa... - I should probably just go. Stay. You two enjoy your lunch. I am so sorry. I guess I can just get a little overprotective sometimes. - But I would never presume to... - I know. It's okay. Really. Why don't I just go get us some dessert. You have one new message. Hey, I was hoping maybe we could talk, face to face, if you want. So I'll meet you in the library after school, and I hope... I'll see you there. To save the message, press two. To erase the message, press three. Message deleted. So, what's the plan? Comic books first? Or frozen yogurt? You think it's cool if we do the comics run tomorrow? I thought it'd be better if I went home to check on Ryan. Yeah, that's a good idea. Do you want some company? - Hey. Where are you guys going? - Well, we were talking about... ...maybe going to the comic-book store... - Really? Can I come? To the comic-book store? Yeah. I like comics. Sort of. You do? Believe it or not, Betty and Veronica had a huge influence on me. You know what, I do believe that. I believe it too. Besides, Marissa has Oliver now... ...and I have a whole afternoon to kill. So, great. - You'll spend it with us. - Yeah. Except, don't you have to go check on Ryan? Well, I... Excuse me. Hey. What are you doing here? - I'm supposed to meet Marissa. - Okay, but here? In broad daylight? - In front of God, Dr. Kim and everyone? - She's not taking my calls. This is the only place I knew I could see her. Does Marissa know about this? You'd think you, of all people, would believe me. Ryan, Marissa's a big girl. You can't tell her who she can and can't hang out with. Oliver's not stable. He's dangerous. One girl got a restraining order against him. Natalie? Either she lives in Niagara Falls or doesn't exist. - I'm sure he's not making up girlfriends. - Seth, he's crazy. Okay. Okay. Fine. He's crazy. But this <i>Mission: Impossible</i> act you're pulling... ...it's not the way to make your case. - I have to go. She's not coming. She asked me to tell you not to call her anymore and not to try and see her. If you do, she'll get a restraining order against you. - Really? What's that like? - It's not my fault she won't see you. I mean, you spied on her. You stole from her. - You beat up one of her best friends. - I'd do it again too. Right now. I could've pressed charges, but I didn't. I'm trying to help you. But if you keep this up, no one's gonna be able to save you. Give it up, buddy. It's over. Hey, Oliver. It hasn't even begun. I need my office back by the end of the day, Brian. If Julie Cooper asks you to do anything else, you nod your head and do nothing. Thanks. - Have you seen the coffee? - Very funny. - In the meantime, I have no place to work. - Yeah, I have no place to eat. Her first day, and Julie has displaced half the staff from their offices... ...and personally alienated the other half. She's driving everyone crazy. Including me. Please talk to her, before I starve to death. You can't talk to Julie Cooper. She's Julie Cooper. Talk to your dad. He's the reason she's there. I know, but then he'll think it's personal or that I'm jealous. I can't talk to my father. You don't mind if I work out of the house, do you? - Sorry, I thought if there was coffee... - Oh, Ryan, come on in. There's coffee and cereal and... ...a model home. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. He didn't leave the pool house all day yesterday. - Maybe we're being too hard on him. - We gotta hang tough. - It's for his own good. - Then why do I feel so bad? Kirsten. You're not dressed. - Julie. - We could carpool from now on. We're next door. Have you read the latest EPA figures? What we're doing to the environment? Sandy, I can see you hiding. Not hiding, Julie. Just making myself presentable. - Don't go to any trouble for me. - Don't worry. Kirsten, you're still not dressed. Yes, well, I was planning on working from the house today, since my office is still... Honey, weren't you supposed to meet with Caleb... ...to talk about the thing? - It can wait. - So can Julie. Grab a shower. - I can get Julie some coffee. - I'll help myself. - Is it flavored? - No. Go ahead. Go. Aren't you late for school? - I got suspended. - Oh, what a surprise. Who'd you beat up this time? Dr. Kim? I guess you and Marissa haven't talked in a while. Well, as a matter of fact, she'll be spending the weekend with me. She will? I guess you and Marissa haven't talked in a while. Look, I know you and I haven't always agreed when it comes to Marissa... ...but I'm asking you, please, keep her away from this kid Oliver. He's not well. Really? The boy who lives in the pool house is warning me... ...about the boy who lives in the penthouse? He's got this thing that he does. He locks into a girl, thinks she'll make everything okay. And when she can't, he loses it. I am not getting involved in the throes of teenage romance. He cut his wrists last year because of a girl. When his girlfriend Natalie broke up with him... ...he got busted for trying to buy cocaine. It's true. You can ask Marissa. - Julie, you ready? - Yeah. Stay out of trouble, Ryan. - What did your mom say about Mammoth? - I didn't ask her yet. I'm sorry. I just... I try not to talk to my mom as much as possible. Look, if you don't want to hang out with me this weekend, that's fine. - What? - It's okay if you don't. Just tell me. Because after what happened with me and Natalie... I do want to hang out with you. Believe me, there's nothing I'd rather do than just blow everything off... ...school, therapy, my mom, and hang out with you. - But I've got so... - You mean it? Seriously? Then let's do it. Let's blow it off. All right. We can drive to L.A. We can have lunch at the Ivy, do the Getty, swing by the Troubadour. It sounds perfect, except my mom would kill me. I'm supposed to have dinner with her tonight. What if I get you back by dinner? - Come on. You know you want to. - Stop it. - What about therapy? - Oh, you don't need therapy. From what you told me, your mom's the one who needs therapy, right? Promise I'll be back before dinner? - Where are they going? - I don't know. - But I don't trust that dude. - Stop it. You sound like Ryan. - You've met Natalie, right? - Oliver's ex, Natalie? No. You? No. Ryan thinks he made her up. Oliver said she went to Pacific, right? I've got friends there. I can just ask. - You don't think that's a little crazy? - Dude, have you met Oliver? - Dad, do you have a minute? - Exactly one. It's about Julie. Close the door. She's driving me crazy. - Excuse me? - Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the woman. But not every living minute of the day. She's there every time I turn around. At home, in the office. I wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't in here now. Dad, you're the one who hired her. I gave her something to do, so she'd stop calling me. Well, it worked. Now she doesn't have to call you. She's always here. Which is why I want you to talk to her. I know she's your friend... ...but in the interest of the business, not to mention your father's sanity... ...this has to end. What are you talking about? The job? - You want me to break up with her? - I knew you'd understand. Hey. So Summer and Anna are both here. Summer is about to read her first comic. I knew you wouldn't want to miss that. Let me know how it goes. Okay. Well, I can see you're busy. Why don't you invite over Oliver? - Natalie, if you can find her. - Yeah. Maybe I'll do that. - Hey, guys. What are you doing? - Hey. Believe it or not, Summer has shown a latent interest in comic bookery. - I don't believe it. - Believe it. - Where's Ryan? - I invited him to join us... ...but he's staying in the Fortress of Solitude. - <i>Superman</i> reference. - I knew that. So I'm gonna start you off with some basics: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Very important. Watchman and The Sandman. Enjoy. - Seth? - Yeah. Don't you want to start on something less grim and gritty? - Like what? - Like the <i>Archie</i>s? Anna. The <i>Archie</i>s? Hey, I'm with Anna. Life's gritty enough. Comic books are for fun. Life's gritty enough? We live in Newport Beach. - Hey, Mr. Cohen? - Yes? Did you read comic books when you were a kid? - Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, not like Seth. - I know. You have no idea how rare it is to find another comic-book person. Especially one who loves Death Cab and sailing. - I thought I was the only one. - I thought Seth was the only one. Death Cab is a band, yes? Guys? Seth! - Can you help me with the groceries? - Yeah, yeah. In a minute. So I guess you and Mrs. Cohen have a lot in common, huh? Oh, yeah, sure. We both love... ...Seth. So I guess we don't have a lot in common. Well, then what do you think is the key to a successful relationship? The sooner we get the bags, the sooner we eat. Coming. Well, I think as far as Cohen men are concerned, the key... ...is patience. - Patience? Hey, Dad. Is it cool if Summer stays for dinner? - I'm gonna get the groceries. - All right. Thanks. - Come on, man. What are you doing? - What are you doing? These are crazy people. Luke! What are you doing here? Besides relieving me of grocery duty. I hadn't seen Ryan in a while, so I thought I'd stop by and say hey. Is that okay? I can't stay. I have to go have dinner with my dad. - But there's something you should know. - What? I saw Marissa leave school today with Oliver. They skipped the whole day. And I tried her on her cell, but... - You don't know where they went? - No. And I'm sure she's probably fine, right? But there's something about that kid. So I went over to Pacific after school. I know guys on the water-polo team there. I figured I'd ask what they knew. What was he like when he went to Pacific? Did they even know him? Did they know Natalie? Well, it turns out... ...there is no Natalie. At least not at Pacific High. - Are you sure it's okay that I'm staying? - Oh, absolutely. We have more than enough for everybody. I don't know where we're gonna put it all. Eventually, in my belly. - You go ahead and start without me. - Okay. I'll go get Ryan. What are you doing at my house? You have to leave. I mean it. - I have to tell you something. - You went to my mom. She called the school. She called the hotel looking for Oliver's parents. - Let me talk to you. - Why do you hate him? What did he ever do to you? There is no Natalie. You're becoming pathetic. Ask him. Ask him to show you his yearbook. She's not there. She's not real. He made her up. Marissa, inside. You're in big trouble. - Ryan, go home. - No. You know what, Ryan? You stay. I'm going. Marissa. Marissa, get back here! Get back here! - Hey. - Hi. Do you mind if I stay here tonight? I thought you might want some breakfast. Thanks. I shouldn't have gone over there last night. - Do you want to talk about it? - Not really. Ryan... ...I promise I will do everything I can to help you. But I can't help you if you don't talk to me. You don't tell me what's going on. Ryan, I thought you might like some... Coffee. - Great minds. - Luke's here to see you. Thanks, you guys. Hey, man. So how did it go last night? What'd she say? She didn't believe me. - Then her mom started in, and she ran. - To Oliver's? I don't know. - So let's go find out. - And then what? - She wants to be with him. - You're just gonna give up? What else can I do? She won't listen to a word I have to say. Well, she's gonna listen to me. See you. So if we leave for L.A. After our massages... ...we can check into my parents' suite around 2. Wait. Your parents have their own suite in L.A. Too? They have private suites in all their hotels. - London, Paris... - Oh, I wish we could go to Paris. We can. It's only 15 hours away. Yeah. As long as we're back by Monday, right? Look, if you don't want to go, just say so. - We don't have to. - No, I do. I just can't. Why not? You've been saying you wanted to get away from your mom... ...and from Ryan. This way it'll just be you and me. In Paris. Hey, don't answer that. It's probably your mom. It's Luke. - Hey. - Marissa... - Where are you? - I'm at the hotel. - Why is he calling? - <i>You gotta listen to me.</i> There is no Natalie Bishop. - <i>Ryan was right.</i> - Luke, don't you start. I'm trying to help you, Marissa. You want to help? Go to my mom's and tell her I'm fine. - Marissa... - Luke, please. I'll be there soon. He's just dropping off some clothes. If you don't want to stay... No, I do. I do. I just can't fly to Paris right now. I'm sorry. Well, it's cold right now anyway. We'll go in the spring. - Unbelievable. - Oh, don't look. It's not finished. I wanted you to be surprised on Monday. I am. Julie, it's gorgeous. Did you do all this today? I was supposed to have Marissa this weekend. That didn't happen. I haven't heard from your father. So then I thought, why not work, right? Take my mind off things. Have you heard from your father? Have you talked to him today? No, no, not today, but... But what? Is he all right? Did something happen? No, he's fine. - It's just... - What? He doesn't like confrontation. Julie, you want to sit down? Why? What's going on? No. Is...? Is he breaking up with me? Or are you doing it for him? Kiki, I saw your car. Hello, darling. - I tried to call you earlier, but... - Don't bother, Cal. Kirsten's already done your dirty work for you. Because obviously you're not man enough to do it yourself. - I'm sorry. - You should be. God. I deserve so much better from you. From both of you. Enjoy your office. I quit. Hello, ladies. Seth. - Dad, don't call me a lady. - Hey, Mr. Cohen. Hey, Sandy. So the comic-book education continues? Batman: The Animated Series. Yes. "Girls' Night Out," in which Batgirl and Supergirl team up... ...to combat the forces of evil and delight Seth Cohen. Is Supergirl wearing Doc Martens? Yes. Yes, she is, Summer. And a midriff-baring T-shirt and a miniskirt. It's excellent. - No wonder you like comics, Super-Perv. - That's right. Dad, we were all gonna have lunch. Is there...? - Can I see you? Now. - Okay. What? What'd I do? You hurt that poor girl's feelings out there. - Who, Dad, Summer? Please... - No. No, Anna. - I didn't say a word to Anna. - Exactly. How do you think that makes her feel, you flirting with another girl? Dad, I was not flirting. - Seth. - Dad. Summer and I are friends. - That's not what it looked like. - I'm not talking about this. Of course not. No one's talking to me about anything lately. - Lf you want to flirt... - Why are we talking about this? Because I'm your father and I'm responsible for you. And if I see something's going on with you, we are gonna talk about it. Do you think that this is about me... ...or could this be about Ryan? No. It's about you. Okay. But just in case it's a little bit about Ryan... ...I think he'll come to you when he's ready. - Hey, Mrs. Cooper. - Hey. You all right? Hard day. Come on in. I'll get Marissa's things for you. Well, I have to say, I'm very impressed that you and Marissa are still friends. - Yeah, I'm impressed she forgave me. - Maybe one day she'll forgive me too. For what? Well, I haven't exactly been the best mom, have I? Or the best wife, or the best girlfriend, for that matter. You and Mr. Nichol? Yeah. It's over. Which means that... ...in the past six months... ...I've lost my husband, my daughter... ...my boyfriend and my job. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be telling you all this. No, no, it's okay. The past few months have been rough on everybody. Yeah. Yeah, they have. Thank you for listening. I haven't had anyone to talk to in so long. Well, you can talk to me. I don't know what good it'll do, but... Hey. You should go. Marissa's waiting. Hi, I'm Marissa Cooper. I'm staying in the penthouse with Oliver Trask. I was wondering if someone dropped off a bag for me. Sorry. One moment. Thank you for calling. This is Natalie. Can you hold, please? - Let me check for you, Miss Cooper. - Natalie? - Do you know Oliver Trask? - Yeah, since he was just a little guy. I used to babysit him. You don't want to know how old I am. Your last name isn't Bishop, is it? Yes, why do you ask? - Hey. - Hey. I was just calling your cell. Where'd you go? I got out of the shower, and you were gone. I just went downstairs to see if they had my bag, but they didn't. You didn't have to do that. They'll bring it up. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just... It's just, the weirdest thing happened. You know the concierge at the front desk? Her name's Natalie. Natalie Bishop. The same as your ex-girlfriend, right? - It's just, how weird is that? - I know what you're thinking, but... - There is no ex-girlfriend, is there? - Marissa, I can explain. - I have to go. - No, no. Please. Okay. I'm so sorry. I always do this. Why do I always do this? - Oliver, stop it. - Damn it! - Oliver, stop. - Okay. All right? It's okay. I'm not going anywhere. So why don't you just go get changed, and then we can go? - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Okay. - Yeah. Come on. Pick up. - Hello? - Ryan, it's me. - What's going on? Where are you? - At the hotel. I can't talk right now. It's Oliver, he's... You were right. And now he won't let me leave. Hang up! Hang up the phone. Please? Give me the phone. - <i>What are you doing?</i> - What's going on? Please, give me the phone. Bye, Ryan. It's too bad that Summer couldn't stay. We have so much food. - Never fear, Mom. Anna's here. - You noticed. - Hey, Seth, why don't you go get Ryan. - Okay. - Hey, will you come with me? - Yeah. Sure, maybe then we can be alone for, like, 10 seconds. Hey. I'm sorry about the Summer thing. You know how excited I get turning people on to comics. I know how excited you get turning Summer on, yeah. Okay. That's not fair. - I thought we were all friends. - No. She's your friend. I am your girlfriend. There's a difference. Or there should be. Hey! Food's here. - Where you going? - I think Marissa's in trouble. - Give me the keys. - I have to go, okay? Give me the keys! - You said I could come to you for help. - Give me the keys! I'll drive. I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry. I heard you on the phone, and I didn't know what to do. That's okay. So why don't you just put the gun down. - We can talk about it. - No, you'll leave. - Oliver. I have to go some time. - What? To him? To him, right? - What about me? - You and I are friends. - We will always be friends. - Friends?! Friends, Marissa?! I'm in love with you! How could you not know that? I've always been. You're the one who gets me. The only one who gets me. You're the only thing in my life that I love. Then why would you want to hurt me? I don't. I never would. This isn't for you. It's for me. Because if you leave, I'll have nothing else to live for. So you have to promise me you will not leave. There's no answer. They're not picking up. Excuse me. My name's Sandy Cohen. We got an emergency call... ...from the penthouse 20 minutes ago, and now no one's answering. Is there any chance you could let us in? I'm sorry. Without permission, we're really not able to. Please, we have a friend up there in trouble. If you could just... Wait. Wait. You're Natalie? Natalie Bishop? Are you a friend of Oliver's? Oliver, you there? It's Natalie. - Oliver, I'm coming in. - No, no. That's okay. I'm fine. I just got out of the shower. Oliver, please. I guess he's fine. Well, thanks for checking. We'll go. No, no. Marissa? Marissa! All right. Let's go. Ryan, he's got a gun! - Let's go. - Why did you do that? - Why? - I'm sorry. Please just put the gun away and let them in. - Sir, don't move! - Put the gun down. Or what? You're gonna shoot me? - Let me save you the trouble. - Come on, son. - You don't want to do that. - Put the gun down. Now. - I'm sorry. - Oliver, put the gun down, man. Why, man? I'm doing you a favor. Why would you want to do that? You hate me. That's right, you do this, you won't hurt me. You'll hurt Marissa, the one person that cares about you. And I know you don't want to do that. Oliver, put the gun down, man. You don't know anything about me, man. I know what it's like to be abandoned by your parents... ...your friends... ...to have no one in your life who believes in you. But you put the gun down, you get a second chance. That's it. Just put it down. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Marissa's okay. Her mom's got her. And the police are taking Oliver to the hospital. I'm gonna clean up the pool house before they get here. I should give Summer a call. What? Why? - To let her know Marissa's okay. - She doesn't know Marissa's not okay. - Don't you think she'd want to know? - You know what? - Call her. I'm leaving. - Anna, wait. Just wait. This huge thing just happened. And the first thing you do is decide to call Summer? Come on, Seth. Look... ...I think you're a great guy. But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend like I'm your girlfriend when I'm not. At least not anymore. I'll see you in school. Hi. I was wondering where my copy of <i>Kavalier and Klay</i> went. You gave it to me. You said I couldn't be your friend until I read it. And have you? I've been a little distracted. Well, it's a good story, Ryan. It's the tale of two young men who couldn't be more different... ...but they learn to overcome their differences. They team up and essentially... ...become brothers, not unlike you and me. Except that I blew it. - It's okay. - No, it's not. Ever since the day you got here, you have totally had my back. And I promise you, from now on, I will never fail you again. I'm so sorry. Do you want to tell me about your night? Or, since I already heard about it, could we skip to my breakup with Anna? Really? Anna broke up with you? Why would you just assume Anna broke up with me? - Seth, come on. - What does that mean? What, she didn't break up with you?
