I'm in charge of residential development. - Ryan and I aren't here together. - We're done. Go after her, tell her how you feel. It's easy. Do you want to do something tonight? I'm taking you with me. You can start over. You can start a new life. Or I see you and the girls in about eight to 10 years. Who's the bitch? Call an ambulance, somebody! You're gonna be okay. Are we worried your dad won't love us if we don't feed him enough? All right. Starting now, no more digs at my dad. Honey, that wasn't a dig. Seth? No. When you called him a heartless bastard, that was a dig. You sold me out. See, they're like puppets and I'm the puppet master. World domination to follow. Maybe you guys can make peace this weekend. Okay. Oh, no, wait. We can't. - Why? - I'm still Jewish. Just getting it out of my system, I promise. - I wonder what his new girlfriend's like. - I am sure she is very well-paid. I am on fire. Look at you, you're wired. Seeing your parents should make you feel guilt, not terror. Don't forget, I'm also her boss. Dad. Speak of the devil, and the devil, he doth appear. <i>Shalom</i>, Sandy. - How long have you been here? - Not long. The Learjet got here quick. I used my key to get in. So, Caleb, where's your new girlfriend? She's taking a swim. Where's my grandson? So your grandpa, he basically owns Newport, right? Yes. And, like you, he comes from humble beginnings. You'll probably hit it off. I burned down one of his homes. But it was an accident. He owns a million of them. It's not even on his radar. Hey, seriously, do not worry about it. Okay, look. He lets Mom run the company, he's got a brand-new girlfriend, he's very mellow. - Seth. - Hey. Hey. How you doing? You're still not a football player. Yes. No. But thank you. Grandpa, meet my friend Ryan. This is the kid that burned down my house. Come on. So you gotta see my pictures from Spain. And you've got to promise me to go to Barcelona while you're still young. You wanna take those and put them around by the grill? Hey. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Gabrielle. I'm with Caleb. Oh, my God, that could be my grandma. Is it twisted to find my potential grandma really hot? Not when she looks like that. - Gabrielle. - Yeah? We're gonna sit, drink some wine, catch up. Okay. Do you want me to...? Hang out in the sun. Get some color. Try to stay out of trouble. Can I join you guys? - Yeah. No... - Yeah, come on... It's warm. So, what's up? - We were... We were talking about the... - You were... He was telling me about the thing. So this birthday party for Caleb, it's, like, a who's who of Newport? Should be wild, huh? - I'm being sarcastic. - We don't get a lot of that around here. So who are you guys bringing? - I would say no one, really. - Yeah. The same. You're kidding, right? There are no girls you wanna bring? Two young, hot guys like yourselves? - Are you still being sarcastic? - No. - Her name is Summer. - And? Did you invite her yet? - It's not that simple, I mean... - She can't say yes if you don't ask her. That is very wise, Gabby. - What about you? - Did you ask Marissa? I haven't talked to her. I don't think she'll want to. And why not? Her family's kind of falling apart... ...she's got this boyfriend she may be back with. It's a long story. - They've been going out since fifth grade. - Fifth grade? Okay, she needs to change it up. She's known that guy since he was eating paste. I think he still does. Hey, babe. You decent? Hey. What are you doing here? I just came from the doctor's, got my stitches out. Thought we could hit the beach. Don't you think it's too soon? You should probably go home and rest. No, no. That's all I've been doing. Luke, you got shot. Yeah, I know. I know how lucky I am to have a second chance. That's why I don't wanna waste any more time. What do you mean? I've been an idiot. I never should have broken up with you in the first place. And now, with everything that's going on with your dad... The thing is, you were there for me when I was in the hospital. And now I wanna be here for you. It's all just been so crazy. I just wish we could be together, like it was. I... I don't know. You don't have to. I mean, we can take it slow. Tell you what. Let's just hang out here today. We'll sit by the pool or watch a movie or something. Whatever you want. Okay. Gabrielle, she seems... She's 24. I'm sorry? Oh, she seems so mature for her age. These birthday festivities, we're keeping them small, right? - It depends what you mean by "small." - Just the family, the four of us. Gabrielle. Right. The four of us. Gabrielle, Ryan and 150 of your closest friends. Cal, she's been working overtime on this. The menus, the invitations. On top of all her other work. - Is it too much? - No. Work is great. - The new development's back on track. - After your boy nearly burned it down. We've had setbacks, but the insurance more than covered the damages. I hear you've commissioned an architect I've never approved to do the redesign. Yes, but I would never build without consulting you. Honey, you don't need my approval. After all, you adopted the boy without consulting me. I would have called you about Ryan, but there wasn't enough time. I'm pushing you too hard. Things are slipping through the cracks. Which is why I've decided to scale back your responsibilities. - You're demoting me? - I wanna get more involved. Give you a chance to spend a bit more time with your new family, your new son. Now, then. Tell me all about Jimmy Cooper. Son of a bitch lost $4 million? I took Kaitlin by the stables to say goodbye to China. Guess she won't be needing these anymore. You know, I think China was her best friend. - China's a horse. - Maybe to you. Hey, you know... - I don't feel good about this. - Well, you shouldn't. What do you...? What do you want from me? I think I want a divorce. I'm sorry, honey. I just don't see any other way. - Hey. - I was on my way to work. - We hadn't talked in a while. - I was gonna call you. No, it's cool. So Kirsten's dad's in town, they're having this... Hey. - Hi. - Hey, how you doing, man? Fine. Yeah, I never got a chance to thank you for taking me to the hospital... ...and giving Marissa a call. Yeah, no problem. Do you have some aspirin? My arm's killing me from the stitches. - Yeah, check in my parents' bathroom. - All right, thanks. Hey, take it easy, guy. So, what's going on? I was gonna see if you wanted to... I was gonna see how you were doing. You seem to be doing good... ...so I'm gonna get to work. Later. Hey. Hi. Seth and Caleb are sailing. I've never seen two people more excited about boats. Seth said you worked here, and I could use a cocktail. - I can't serve you. - Right. You're not legal. - How about a cranberry juice? - That I can do. From the flight. I hate flying. - You? - I've never been on a plane. My first time, I was 15. My mother sent me to Japan all by myself to do some modeling. She figured it was easier than her having to get a job. - I can relate. - I've heard. So how'd the modeling thing turn out? Well, when you're a teenager and you're living in a house with a bunch of girls... ...with no parents, things can get a little insane. By the time I got clean, I was 22, retirement age. You must think it's weird, me with an older guy. I live in a pool house. So how did it work out with your girl? - Paste-eater? - They have a past. Excuse me? More water. Oh, Kirsten, come on, honey. You could not have done more or done better. I just don't understand. I've worked so hard for him. I've killed myself for him. Well, the man is a bottomless pit of need. You think you can fill it? You can't. You're amazing. If he can't appreciate you, screw him. Quit. Quit. You've never supported me working for him. You've never liked him. You're right. Not since our wedding day, when you walked yourself down the aisle. He was in Singapore. There was a monsoon. Baby, we changed the date three times for his schedule. He makes the world revolve around him, including you. Sandy, he's my dad. He's ruining your life. Quit. I can't. So you're living in a pool house. And then? So, what's next for you? What's next for you? Learjet to London, Paris in the fall? Perhaps. I'll be right back. - Hi. - Hey. Got a minute? What's up? - I wanted to talk to you before, but... - Luke was there. Right. He wants to get back together. - What did you tell him? - I told him I needed to think about it. I don't know what I should do. I don't know either. I know. I just... Look, if you came here for me to help you choose... - Of course not... - Good. Why don't you just let me know when you've made up your mind. Okay? Okay. If he'd just said something. I mean, I just wanted him to say anything. Well, you can't expect him to choose, Coop. He comes from a place where they have knife fights, drag racing... ...and sex on the hood of a car. - That's from <i>Fast and the Furious</i>. - That movie was based on a true story. - No, it wasn't. Whatevs. All I'm saying is you have to do the choosing, not him or Luke. It's fate. It's destiny. Look, we both like burritos. You wanna eat somewhere else? Who's winning right now, me or my hair? I'm gonna get us some salsa. Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen. Could you give me a hand... ...over here? Okay. I... I know you gotta figure some stuff out. I get that. But in the meantime, there's this party at... Well, it's for Seth's grandfather. I know. I'm going. Luke asked me this morning. Cool. Well, I'll see you and Luke tomorrow, then. Yeah. See you. Two salsa verdes. Aggressive. Pico de gallo, that's a classic. Holy jalape Ío. Somebody came to play. Are there any napkins? No. - Lick it. - What? I just got my nails done. It'll ruin the polish. - You lick it. - I don't like picante. It's for Marissa. - Thanks. - It's good. Now, aren't you gonna invite me to your grandpa's party? I'm sorry, Summer, could you please repeat that? Your grandpa's having this awesome party. It's at your house. And I thought we were friends. Wait a second. Do you want me to ask you because you wanna go with me... ...or just because you wanna go? Fair enough. I'll see you at 8. - Hey. - Hey. How was court? I was distracted all day. I was thinking, if you quit, know what we could do? - I'm not quitting. - Hear me out. We could buy back our old house in Berkeley. You loved that house. Seth loved that house. That house had bad plumbing and termites. It was a fixer-upper we never got to fix up. I know. We moved here because your mom got sick. We never planned to stay. If you quit, we could do anything we want. We could go anywhere. No, we can't. Why not? Seth has been planning his exodus from this place since he was 6. Ryan wouldn't care. You could get that little gallery in Sausalito you've always dreamed of. Or the Mission. You could put your art history degree to use. I haven't thought about that gallery in years. So... ...think about it. Think about it. Is this too slutty to wear to an old guy's birthday party? I don't want the dude to have a coronary. I can't believe you're actually going with Seth. Aloha? Caleb Nichol is, like, the Donald Trump of the West. Do you know how many hot, rich... ...twenty-something banker-brokers are gonna be there? A lot. And now I have someone to introduce me to them. - Isn't that a little mean to Seth? - To who? Kidding. That was delicious, Kirsten. Well, thank you. I order from them all the time. Less time at work, more time for cooking. Because there's no place Kirsten feels more comfortable than in the kitchen. - What? Mom can't even make cereal. - Thanks, Seth. - I love you, Mom. - I love you too. You have a quick wit, Seth. Amazing you're not better at skirt-chasing. Well, if by "skirts" you mean girls, in your outdated cowboy-speak... ...I have a little news for you. Turns out somebody has a date to your party. And it's not a big deal or anything, but if you must know, Summer asked me. - Summer. Summer's hot. - You did not just say that. - Say what? - Just go, please. You go. What about you, Ryan? Nope. Going by myself. Caleb seems to be in good spirits. He just finished a second bottle of merlot. - Now would be a good time to talk to him. - I'm not ready for that conversation. What conversation? - Got any grappa? - Yeah. - Are you adopting another kid? - It's nothing. - Actually, it's something. - I've never known my daughter... ...to need someone to speak for her. - Maybe you've never gotten to know her. If you did, you'd know she's the best thing that ever happened to your company. You'd support her, not demote her so she wants to quit. - Is that true? You wanna quit? - No... - Kirsten. - We were talking... About selling this house and moving back to Berkeley, like we'd always planned. You're not serious. You're still smoking the weed, aren't you? - Dad... - Dad, you smoke weed? - Out, now. Private conversation. - Ryan, guess who's a stoner. Honey, don't be afraid of him. You keep your mouth shut. No one here cares what you think. Don't talk to me like that in my own house. Whose house is this? Who built it? Who paid for it? - Dad. - This is between you and me, Kiki. You're gonna do what you want anyway. - Should we maybe go? - Adopting juvenile delinquents. - Maybe let's just... - Yeah, let's. You're making a big deal of this. It was nothing. Doesn't sound like nothing. In fact, thanks, Sandy, for letting me know how she feels. She would never tell me that. She never tells me anything. If you wanna quit, that's fine. I'll expect your resignation tomorrow. Now, then. The grappa. So, Gabrielle, I heard Grandpa's taking you on the helicopter tour tomorrow. Yeah. He wants to show me his Orange County empire. - This game sucks. - Let me see it. Ryan, you've been playing the pirate game? That's a little bit minty. - What else do you have? - I'll go get you "Pro Skater 3." It's good. Hey. We gotta go searching for my dad's bong later, all right? So... ...does he always yell like that? - Pretty much. He's the boss, and every relationship is a business relationship to him. Even yours? He'll only ever really love one woman. And she passed away years ago. For now, he's just looking to stay entertained... ...keep from being bored. But aren't we all? I am so bored. - Do you think...? - Don't think. Gabrielle. We're leaving. Now. Back to the office. - How's Gabrielle? - I don't know. Oh, really? Okay, Ryan, let me present exhibit A to you. She opted to forgo sailing to go to the Crab Shack? So? Not everyone likes sailing. Okay. Let's take it to exhibit B here. Intense, some would even say smoldering, eye contact at the table. She was mad-dogging you. And finally, the clincher... ...last night in the pool house, she chose to sit on your bed... ...even though there was an empty chair. Come on, boys, out of the pool. Caterers are here. Time to get ready. I would like some answers. Yeah, okay, we hooked up. - What? - Isn't that what you were asking? I noticed some heavy flirting, yes... You hooked up with my grandma? - Actually, that's kind of hot. How was it? - No one can know about this. I agree completely. How was it? It was good. Weird, but good. - What about Marissa? - What about her? '73 Dom. Yes, that's his favorite. Thank you. Is there cilantro in that? Great, he hates it. I can't believe you still went through with this. I had no choice, even though you tried to sabotage the entire weekend. Honey, I'm sorry I jumped the gun last night. Ready? - Hello. - Hi. - Dad, you made it. - How you doing? - Disappointed? - No. - Sandy. - Hey, happy birthday, Caleb. - Can I get you a drink? - Absolutely. - Dad, happy birthday. - Thanks. - Look, about the other night... - Just forget about it. Just make sure that you let me know when you plan to give notice... ...so that I can hire your replacement. - Caleb. Quite a party. You look... You clean up good. Are you trying to get caught? Find me later. I wish Dad had come. Why, so you could break up another brawl? Hi, how are you? Hey, Summer. You look... Yeah. Hey, Marissa. Hi, Luke. Cohen, how you doing? It's good to see you. - It is? - So this is your place. It's beautiful. - Thank you. - Mariss, something to drink? Sure. Okay, he got shot in the arm, not the head. Come on. Don't you wanna show me off? I'm in private equity and portfolio management. Really? Private equity and portfolio management. Sounds fascinating. It's a great party. Everybody seems to be having a good time. Almost everybody. Look. Look, I... I wish I could tell you I'm sorry, but I'm not. - Okay, worst apology ever. - You know I'm no good at those. Look, the important thing is, it's out there. You spoke your mind. No. You spoke my mind. I thought we had an understanding. I thought this was what we both wanted. It is. It was. You're backing down. He's been doing this to you for years. My dad isn't the reason we stayed here. We are. We chose this. If you're telling me that all this time you've been unhappy... ...that this isn't what you want... ...then this is a much bigger conversation. I've got Pilates. - How's that going? - It's great. It's Jimmy. Excuse me. I told you not to come. What the hell are you doing here? I've got a plan, okay? Just take it easy. A chance to go back to the way it was. - You built a time machine? - Caleb employs thousands of people. None are more qualified than me. How big a leap can it be from investing in stocks to investing in real estate? - You are not asking him for a job. - Why not? This whole community thinks you're a criminal, Jimmy. Caleb Nichol owns the community. He'll feel the same. The guy's loved me since I was a kid. He taught me how to sail. When I was a junior in high school, he tried to convince me to propose to Kirsten. Please. Don't even think of talking to him. Look, I'm sorry. But if there's a chance that I can save this family... ...I'm gonna take it. This party rocks. - I cannot believe David Manperl's here. - Who? Senior vice president of the wealth-management division at McKenna. You know, the venture capitalist firm. He manages wealth as a job. I've been reading <i>Forbes</i>. I see. So you chose Luke, huh? Chino didn't stand a chance. I told you Luke was the one. No, you didn't. Well, I meant to. You guys are all over each other. - Did you...? Did it happen? - No. Well, his willpower is amazing. - The fact that you two haven't had sex... - Summer! Coop, what more do you want? He's beautiful, sweet, totally crazy about you. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Well, you better figure it out, because he's not gonna be able to wait forever. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Somebody's hiding. No, I'm just... Bored. Me too. I've heard. - She's just a girl. - I know. - So why are you hiding from her? - I'm not. I don't believe you. - Still bored? - Not so much. Sorry. I... I thought... Sorry. I've just been surfing... Hey, babe, I was looking... - Let's go. - Yeah, okay. We could go to my place. My parents went to Palm Springs. Yeah, sure. Great. Pharmaceuticals. Isn't that the largest-growing industry in North America? Remember the old days, Jimmy? Where's the time gone? Great to see you again, as always. Hey. Congratulations. Looks like you got yourself a job. Oh, yeah. Caleb couldn't have been nicer... ...when he said there was no way he could hire me. - Well, hate to say I told you so. - No, you don't. Where are you going? To finish what you started. - Happy birthday, Cal. - Julie. Thank you. I'll call you next week. - How are you? - Well, I'm sure you've heard. - Kirsten's brought you up to speed. - I'm really sorry. About everything. I really liked your husband. Soon to be ex-husband. Can't expect me to stay with him, not after he's lied to me, left us with nothing. - Nothing? - Yeah. I suppose I'll have to get a job now, doing God knows what. It's not like I have any marketable skills. Well, I'm sure that's not true. You know, if there's anything that I can do for you or the girls... You're very, very sweet. And very busy. I just wanted to say happy birthday. I'm never too busy for you. We'll have dinner, figure something out. I'd like that. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing? I need you to introduce me... - Okay. You know what, Summer? No. - What? This whole night, all you've done is use me to meet rich older guys. That's not true. Okay. Maybe a little. Do you have any idea how pathetic it is to listen to you talk about mergers... ...while some guy just stares at your boobs? - Which guy was staring at my boobs? - Who cares? The point is, if that guy doesn't know you, he doesn't care about who you really are. He has no idea that every day of third grade you shared your lunch... ...with a skinny squirrel whose nuts were stolen by a fat squirrel. I hated that mean squirrel. None of those guys were there when you read your poem aloud in class... ...and your hand was shaking because you were nervous. Poem? What poem? "I Wish I Was a Mermaid." You remember that? That was, like, sixth grade. I wish I was a mermaid And... Was friends with all the fish A shiny tail and seashells, that's... What I would wish Oh, I gotta go. There's that investment banker from Woodward and McDonnough. It's okay. I'll introduce myself. The greatest party ever. - She has no intention of quitting. - Doesn't sound that way to me. Well, I wish she would, so we could get the hell away from you. - Lf you're looking for a fight... - Save it. We both know you're punishing her because she's doing so well without you. You're afraid she won't need your help to run the company or her family. And I got news for you. She's better than you at both. If you don't wanna lose her, let her keep doing what she's been doing. You'll stay rich, she'll be happy, and I'll figure out a way to make it work. I need a corkscrew. Have a nice time. Great party, Kiki. Your mom would have loved it. Birthdays, holidays. She always loved a good party. She did. I miss her. I know. Me too. Your sister, do you ever hear from her? I wanted to invite her, but I couldn't reach her. The number I have is no longer in service. - And then there were two. - You could look at it like that. You're all I got, Kiki. And then I'm running you so ragged you haven't got time to talk to me. That's not true, and you know it. I love working for you. I just want you to be proud of me. Taking in a stray kid. That's the sort of thing your mom would've done. Yeah, except she would have done it just to piss you off. Don't be late Monday. - Hi. - Hi. So I guess she likes you. I guess she did. You look so sad. I... I'd give anything to be that miserable. Because if I remember correctly, that's what it feels like to be in love. I love you so much. Do you...? I mean, are you...? Okay. Yeah, you're sure? Yeah. I want to. Should I grab a...? Yeah. - Do you want me to walk you in? - No. Thanks.
