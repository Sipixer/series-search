- I want you to leave Ryan alone. - You really think I'm gonna hurt him. I chickened out. Which is kind of my go-to move these days. But I'm rescheduling the interview. - Oh, that's Maya Griffin. - Whose father's the head of the board? I'm totally cool about turning your apartment into the Playboy Grotto. - I'm Jess. - Trey. I've always had this fantasy about two brothers. I want you out of Newport. - We could take off together. - And where would we go? Vegas. - Marissa and I are broken up. - Glad you finally made your decision. Your Brown interview is in 11 hours. Don't you think you should prep for it? No. I've got a new approach. It's called "don't think about it." I guess that's better than your last approach. - Hey, what's all that? - Little halftime buffet. Pretzels, Ding Dongs, gelled gefilte fish. Tried to mix it up. That's always appreciated. - Ryan, you ready for a rematch? - Do we have to? I thought I called winners. No offense, I just don't think you should step into the ring with me. Before Ryan and I came, PlayStation was pretty much his best friend. - Come on. One game, Seth. - That's my controller. - Ryan, will you get drinks with me? - Yes. - Okay, you ready? - That's my lucky controller. So, Atwood, seems like you're really moving on. Yeah. Trying to. Well, I promise, no weirdness from me. Coop's my best friend, but I've also accepted the fact that you and Marissa... Not really meant to be. Which is why it's good that you've found the opposite of Marissa. You really think Sadie is Marissa's opposite? And game over. Whoa, dude, you got killed already? I am humbled, man. I am humbled and mortified. It's okay. I can't take all the credit. I found a cheat code on the Internet. - Ryan, this one's a keeper, man. - Anti-Coop. Who knew my new PlayStation idol would be your new girlf... Your new... - All right, like... Friend. Girl friend. - Friend. - Nice save. - I think "friend" is the word. - I'm gonna get that. Thanks. - Nice dodge. "Friend" was what I was looking for. Ryan. - Jess. - Oh, good. You recognized me. Even with the new look. Yeah. Kind of came with the new life. Listen, I brought you something. It's a belated birthday present. From your brother. - You keep in touch with him? - Yeah. I lived with him out in Vegas for a while. Just got back a few months ago. Here. Thanks. Don't you wanna know how he's doing? Hey. Ryan, if you wanna talk, you know where I live. - Who was that? - Nobody. Let's just go back inside. Come on, you're up next. - Hey. - Hey. You know, I know Trey's not made of money or anything... ...but he could have sprung for a shirt. - It's an inside thing. Long story. - I like long stories. Too bad. I don't feel like telling this one. Breakfast is ready in the kitchen. I haven't seen one of those in years. Do you remember when your dad and I used to buy these for you? Couldn't get you to play with them. Where did you find this anyway? Trey. - A friend of his dropped it off. - Remember Jess? Girl who took too much X and floated face-down in a pool? Yeah, she moved to Vegas with Trey and they lived together. - Well, how is he? Is he okay? - I don't know. Figured he's out of my life. Why get back into it? Well, breakfast is ready. - What are you doing? - Thought you'd be at school. So you were gonna lurk around while I wasn't home? Came to drop something off. I thought you were gonna sell this. This watch was really expensive. No, I decided to hang onto it. And now you're giving it back? Well, there's a surprise twist. Thanks. Anything else? Look, I just wanna be alone right now. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah, you look busy. I'm gonna be at the beach tonight. Maybe I'll see you. Don't count on it. No, you're the man, sir. Okay, I'll see you soon. - So? - Turns out the guy is a huge anime fan. We got into the whole <i>Akira</i> vs. <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> debate. Both came down on <i>Ghost in the Shell.</i> I have no idea what you're saying, but I'm so happy for you. I'm gonna go call my parents. Tell them to start packing. Congratulations, baby. Oh, holy Kodak moment. I guess Seth just aced his Brown interview. That's fantastic. We're so gonna party tonight. I'll make a flan. Oh, well, you know what, Taylor? Seth and I were thinking about hanging out alone. My dad's out of town, we have the house to ourselves... Say no more. What, Taylor? - What's wrong with your eye? - It's a knowing wink, Summer. You and Seth, the house all to yourselves... ...who knows what could happen? Me. There'll be leftover Thai and the <i>Blade</i> trilogy. Oh, I didn't realize that you and Seth had lost the magic. Surprised you didn't come sooner. You must be panicking. Okay, I didn't come to you, and why would I panic? Well, it looks like you two are going to college together. Don't you worry that Seth's eye will wander? All the nubile young coeds, you, the familiar old shoe. I'll have you know, Taylor, that I'm five levels hotter than him. Summer, the libido does not listen to logic. At this age, men are driven by a reptilian force. Spread the seed. Spread the seed. - Spread the s... - Taylor. If Seth and I go to college together, we'll be fine. And I'll have you know, we have a very healthy sex life. Then super. You have fun tonight. - But, Summer, if you need to girl talk... - Bye, Taylor. Hey. Glad you're home. Yeah, I just walked in. I didn't know you were stopping by. I needed a break from dry-walling. You're still into toy cars? I'll choose to find that cute instead of creepy. It's just something someone gave me. This wouldn't have anything to do with that Hooters waitress... ...that showed up at your doorstep yesterday? Jess is just a friend of my brother's. I'd tell you the whole story, but... But you'd just rather not? That's cool. But just know that if you do decide to tell me, I will listen. And without judgment. Or you can keep it all to yourself. Both are fine with me. Okay. I'm gonna get going. Dr. Henry Griffin. What a surprise. - I hope you don't mind. - Please. We're building a hospital. When all's said and done, we'll be like family. - Hang on a sec. Let me get Matt in here. - I'd rather that you didn't. The board called an impromptu meeting yesterday. It seems there's been some complaints about your associate. Complaints? Rumors. Parties at his house. Booze, gambling, God knows what else. Board's not sure they wanna do business with him. I'll talk to him. Make sure he cleans up his act. This is not about a slap on the wrist. We want him off the project. Matt worked his ass off on this deal. I couldn't take him off it. Then I'm afraid we can't go forward with the hospital. - You gotta be kidding me. - Take a few days. Mull it over. Remember, this hospital could change everything for you. Do you really wanna give it all up for one 26-year-old hotshot? - Hey, man. - Hey. What's going on tonight, big plans with Sadie? Maybe. I don't know, I haven't really decided yet. Yeah? What's plan B? Jess? I just need to know if Trey's okay. Nothing you hear is gonna make it easier that he's not a part of your life. Listen, as we speak, your new sometimes kind of girlfriend... ...is probably sitting, cradling a hunk of plaster, waiting for you to make a move. So you can either dwell on the past and go see Jess... ...or live for the now and give Sadie a call. So you called? - Marissa. Hey. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Just in the neighborhood? - Yeah, I was driving by. Okay, no, I wasn't. The truth is, Summer's with Seth. I'm all alone and I'm going out of my mind. Tomorrow I'm gonna go up to L.A., but if you want... ...feel free to make this your crash pad. - That would be great. - All right. Make yourself at home. All right. Two down, one to go. You really wanna watch the entire <i>Blade</i> trilogy? Can't leave the disk unwatched. It'll feel bad. I thought tonight was about celebrating your interview. It is. Hence the trilogy. You know... ...we could forget the movie, go upstairs. You smell so good. - You like the smell of salami? - Cohen! What? I had a salami sub. I feel like it's lingering. - You know what? Just forget it. - Forget what? I was trying to create a mood. I know. I know that now. I was just thrown off a little bit by your approach. Nuzzling your ear and complimenting you? I wasn't reinventing the wheel. Normally, you throw me down and do your thing. But I can adjust. - Not interested. - Summer. You smell good too. - Press play before I break your face. - Fine. Hey, it's Sadie. Leave a message. Hey. So I know you're painting, but it's Friday night. I'm making you take a break. I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay? Bye. Hey, Ryan. I was just about to take a swim. Come on in. Look, I can't stay long. But you couldn't resist getting the lowdown on your brother? Guy has a way of sucking you in. I know. Drink? Just tell me, is he okay? Well, he misses you. Trey's not the type to cry into his pillow every night, but I can tell. You know him that well, huh? Let's just say he's of a certain mold. Angry, damaged, reckless. That's the kind of guy I go for. My boyfriend now, Jim, same deal. We all have our types, don't we? Tell you what, why don't you stay a while. Look, Jess, we were never friends. Got it. You can go if you want. Do you know Trey's dealing? Blackjack. Off the strip. So he's staying out of trouble? Trying to. - Don't move. I'll get some clothes. - Jess. Just stay a little while. I have a lot more to tell you about Trey. - Music too loud? - No, it's just the grunting... ...and excessive banging that I'm concerned about. Sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Girl problems? Safe bet usually, but no. Actually, this is more complicated. Is it that girl Jess again? Yeah. And my brother. Just trying to prevent another casualty of Trey. So you're trying to save this girl? Is that something I do? Look, we love Marissa. She's family. And she means a lot to us. But she's been through so much. You got pulled into that. Yeah, well, some of that was my fault. You're right. I can't argue with you. You should never argue with a woman who's here to discuss women. Have we mentioned that we love Sadie? She's smart and she's grounded. And I am trying, trying not to screw it up. Because a girl isn't tied to train tracks doesn't mean she should be ignored. I know, I know, it's just Jess is trying to put Trey behind her, start a new life. Great. As long as she doesn't get in the way of yours. - Marissa. - Sandy. Look, I know it's weird I slept here... ...but I didn't feel like being in the trailer by myself. If you need somewhere to go, you can come to our house. I know. You guys are like family. - It's just that these days... - Things are difficult with you and Ryan. But you don't belong here. Okay, I was just leaving anyway. If you're looking for Matt, he went to L.A. for a meeting. Well, I'll track him down. - And you go home. - Okay. All right. - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Hi, I'm picking up an order for Roberts. - Sure. Just a second. Thanks. - Guess who? - Oh, God. Hi! - Looks like someone got the short straw. - No, I ordered pancakes. No, you drew the short straw. After sex when everyone's hungry but nobody wants to get the takeout... ...short straw picks up the food. Yes. That is exactly what you're seeing happening here. Total short-straw scenario. With the hunger and all the sex we had last night. Yes. So was last night, like, totally kinky, or was it more about tender lovemaking? You know, smooth jazz, a burning fire, a zebra-skin rug... We had a very nice time. - My God. You didn't have sex, did you? - Are my pancakes ready yet? Your lips aren't chapped, there's no love bites. - Your voice isn't hoarse from screaming. - Pancakes? - Thank you. Goodbye, Taylor. - Summer. Summer, wait, I can help you! - Hey. - Hey. Grab a brush. We're in the home stretch. So I thought maybe I was gonna see you last night. - Got tied up. Sorry. - What, do you work for the CIA? Doesn't matter. I got distracted for a few days, but I'm fine now. In fact, I'm all yours. Okay. Fine. You're forgiven. But in exchange for your silence, I demand a dinner. Okay. Tomorrow night? Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Hey, it's Summer. Leave a message. So nothing happened. - Still, Matt should know better. - But he doesn't. You have to remember that he's not that much older than the boys. He just needs some advice from the great Sandy Cohen. Oh, sometimes you overestimate me. Not possible. - Get a room. - Hey, count your blessings. Kids with affectionate parents grow up to be better adjusted sexually as adults. I know. I meant, get a room. My room. And do it in front of me. - This Sadie? - No, it's Jess. Jess? Whoa, slow down, slow down, I can't... What do you mean? No, no, no, stay put, stay put. I'll be right there. Hey. I thought you weren't gonna let this happen again. After this I'm done. If I need help, I'll call, okay? - Thanks for coming. - I needed to talk about Seth anyway. So have you talked to him today? No, I think we're too embarrassed to face each other. Or he's treading water till he gets to Brown... ...and finds a big pair of pale New England boobs to replace me. Babe, you just had an off night. It'll be okay. - This ever happen with you and Ryan? - Actually, no. I mean, we had our problems. That just wasn't one of them. What about the end, when you drifted apart? Kind of the opposite. I guess... ...the more emotionally unavailable you are... ...the more you end up wanting each other. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Hey, you think we should get out of here? - Sold. - Okay. - Did you see him? - Not yet. - How many times has he come? - Started hours ago. He's calling too. - And when did you end it? - Earlier today. I guess I was inspired by our talk last night. So I called him, told him I didn't wanna see him anymore, and now here I am. Down a boyfriend, up a stalker. - Is that him in the Mustang? - Yup. - He's coming in. - Yeah. Just go in the back. - She doesn't wanna see you. - Who are you, her bodyguard? No. But I'll kick your ass if you take one step further. He's gone? I don't think he'll be back. - Are you gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. I promise. You sure? Ryan, I know you don't believe me, but I really am trying to change. You don't have to stay. Morning. Hey. Scrambled or fried? I made both. Neither. I should get going. But coffee would be nice. Ryan, don't look all awkward, like it's the morning after. It's not like anything happened last night. Stay. Eat. Let me get rid of this. Hello? Trey. Hi. Of course I do. I'd have to think about it. Look, I gotta go. I'm sitting here with your brother. Sure. Hang on. Do you wanna talk to him? Now's not a good time. I'll call you later. He wants me to come back. - What happened to trying to change? - I am trying. It's just that it's Trey. It's hard. - Especially all by myself. - Your parents, where are they? Well, my dad's in Tokyo on business, and my mom's at the spa... ...a.k.a., in bed with her tennis instructor. So as you can see, I don't have much to distract me. Unless you wanna give it a try. Look, I can't stay here and babysit you. What about your girlfriends at USC? I could call, see if they wanna come down. Call them, invite them down, just take a breath. Ryan, I'll try, but what if I freak out? You won't. Matt, call me back. We got a lot to discuss. - Everything okay? - Oh, it's just business. Hey, I heard you aced your Brown interview. Looks like the stars are aligning for you. And Summer. - Could be another four years together. - Yeah. Hey, let me ask you a question. When you were at college with Mom, did it ever... ...get sort of stale with the monogamy and the constant being-together? - Your mother was a firecracker. - Okay. My buddies used to say, " If you see rocking, don't come knocking." - So sorry I asked. - Good morning, honey. - Hi, honey. - Have either of you seen Ryan? I checked the pool house and it looks like he didn't sleep there. - Good morning, everyone. - Sadie. Hello. Bagels. Hope you don't mind me crashing breakfast. Not at all. Let me get you coffee. Hey, is Ryan around? Actually... You've really gotta learn to lie better. We'll just let you two... You really are a terrible liar, my dear. You could have jumped in. So let me guess... ...Ryan got some 911 call from Jess and it required him spending the night. - That has not been confirmed. - Don't have to protect him. It's fine, honestly. I'm not jealous. I'm just not really sure that Ryan and I are right for each other. Because? Because he just seems to have a lot of really intense issues. Yeah, well, intense issues seem to follow Ryan around. Well, I don't know if I'm up for that now. Well, listen, I think Ryan really likes you. And I think if you hang in there, you two will eventually settle in... ...to a super laid-back, boring-ass relationship. But cut him some slack, he just got out of a two-year drama-fest with Marissa... ...and the one time that he tried to date someone normal... ...she turned out to be my dead grandfather's illegitimate daughter. - So you know how that goes. - Right. Yeah, of course. Of course I know how that goes. Can you do me a favor and not tell Ryan that we talked? You know how to keep a secret? Nobody's home. Don't worry, it's just me. - Hi. - So listen, I hate to pop in like this... ...but I'm meeting Ashley and Madison later to brainstorm for a prom theme. - Do you wanna come? - You probably don't need me for that. Summer, are you kidding me? It's the end of the year. We are all fried. Come on, please? Fine. Here you go. Do you print out a flyer for everything? You'll thank me when you make your 2006 scrapbook. There was the party with Bill Merriam, the few dates I went on with Maya. Nothing the board could oust me for. - What about Marissa? - What about Marissa? I went to your house yesterday to talk, and she answered the door in pajamas. - She needed a friend. - Well, then be a friend. But for God's sake, do not be throwing pajama parties with 17-year-old girls. - Nothing happened. - That doesn't matter. The board is watching you, waiting for you to screw up... ...and you're screwing up. - This is a witch hunt. If they wanna take me down, they will. Unless you stop them. I mean, so please... ...call Griffin. Tell him you're gonna keep me on the project. School on a Sunday is, like, beyond creepy. Summer, you're right on time. Where's Ashley and Madison? - Summer? - Cohen. You know, you said the A.V. club was meeting. I brought <i>History of Violence.</i> This is a total ambush. Look, you two are like my family. If I sense there's trouble with my Sethummer... ...I am gonna do what I can to help. - We're not in any trouble. That we've acknowledged to each other. That is exactly why I brought you here today. Communication. Intimacy. These are two skills that you two could improve upon. Now, I am not a licensed sex therapist, but my father was. Before he ran away, he used to conduct sessions with couples in our basement. - That's creepy. - Okay... ...we're going to start off with touching. I want you to place your hands anywhere on each other's bodies... ...excluding breasts and genitals. - I have to go. - Cohen. - Put your hands on me now. - Come on, it'll be fun. Summer? Good. Okay, now, I want you to concentrate on your eye contact. Get lost in each other's gaze. I'm getting lost. I'm getting lost. As you gaze into each other's eyes, do you feel stirrings? Deep in your loins? - No, I don't really feel anything. - Yeah, I got nothing. Not even the faintest spark? A tiny flicker? What does that say about us? Well, I also do breakup counseling. - And for you? - I'll have the same. - Great. Thanks. - Thank you. So I'm sorry that I didn't take you anyplace nicer for our first date. Are you kidding? This place is the culinary destination of Newport. - Wait till you try the pancakes. - Next time. - Next time? - That's the plan. Yeah. All right. Excuse me. Jess? - Is this Ryan Atwood? - Who's this? Kim, I'm Jess' friend. - We really need you to come over here. - What's going on? Word got out about Jess' tonight, and now half of USC is here. And Jim is on his way over here, and on a rampage. - Grab Jess and get out of there. - <i>She's locked in the pool house.</i> She's drunk and crying and she says the only person she'll talk to is you. Wel... Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. Is everything okay? Not really. Okay. You know, if you have to go, Ryan, go. It's fine. Really, I get it. You do? No. I don't. But I get that something's pulling you under and you can't let it go. So whatever it is, please, just go deal with it and find me when you're done. I'm right here. I wasn't looking for you. But I'm here now. Whatever this game is you're playing... ...stop. - You don't want me to go away. - What makes you say that? - You're Ionely. Right, well, thanks for the analysis. I feel much better. No, look. If you need a break from everything going on in there... ...I can help. I think I'm doing just fine on my own. - You must be Ryan. - I am. I'm so glad you're here. She's in there. Still won't come out. Jess? Jess, it's me, open up. - You came. - Yeah. What is it? - What are you so upset about, huh? - I thought I could have friends over... ...and then I started missing you. Let's go out. They're worried about you. No, no, no. I don't wanna be with my friends. - I wanna be here with you. - That's not a good idea. Are you kidding? This is the first good idea I've had. Jim, Trey, none of those guys knew how to take care of me. You know how to take care of me, Ryan. It's all right. It's okay. - Jess. Jess. Jess. - Hey! - Moving on already? That what this is? - Settle it with me. - You wanna talk outside? - Yeah. Lock the door. - You seeing her? - She's a friend of my brother's. - Not that guy Trey? - Well... What? You gotta take your brother's leftovers? Listen to me, you gotta stay away from this girl. - She's trying to start over, you let her. - None of your business. You're right. That's why I'm leaving. - Ryan! Ryan, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Look, Jess, if you're smart you'll stay away from him. - And my brother. - Of course I will. - After the way you fought for me. - You gotta stop dating guys like him. And I gotta stop dating girls like you. Take care of yourself. - Hello. - Taylor, I really don't wanna talk... ...about my sex problems with Summer. Okay, okay. So the intimacy exercises were a miserable failure. But I don't think you should lose hope. - Do you have some sort of secret cure? - As a matter of fact, I do. It's called raunchy sex. Now, now, you don't see me as a sexual being, Seth. I get that. But without revealing too much, if sex were a martial art, I'd be a black belt. Weirdly, I'm not surprised. Now, I would like to talk to you about a little something called the <i>Kama Sutra.</i> How do you know all this? Dean Hess hid a treasure trove of secrets underneath his pink shirts. Okay. Position one. Okay, I really don't wanna picture you doing that with the Nazi dean. Seth, do you want your sparks back with Summer? - Yes. - Then listen and learn. Okay, this is the yoni and this is the lingam. Matt may not have shown the best of judgment, but it's nothing I'd fire him for. And the " sacrificing one life to save the many" argument? Yeah, I don't get it. The board loves you, Henry. One phone call from you, nobody has to sacrifice anyone. - What makes you think I would do that? - Business. Our plan is the best one, you know that. Makes me wonder about the board, though... ...that they'd scrap a lucrative project over this. It makes no sense from a business perspective. But maybe it's personal. This is about Maya, isn't it? She cried for days over him. I'm sorry, Henry. But you didn't have to lie to me. I'm just a father looking after his daughter. Reason and logic don't stand a chance. I understand that. All different kinds of loyalty, Sandy. I chose mine. Now you choose yours. What's it gonna be? Hospital or Matt? - Hey, Coop. - You okay, Sum? Yeah, just Cohen called. He's coming over, he wants to talk. Doesn't bode well. Well, maybe he's coming to patch things up. Or maybe he's coming over to break up with me. Anyway, it means that I can 't hang out tonight, okay? Oh, hey, I totally understand. - Just call me later. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - How did it go? - Fine. Fine. Matt called a couple of times. Sounded nervous. - Matt? - Yeah. I'll let you talk to him. I'm gonna go lock up the house. - Oh, hey. I didn't know you were here. - Yeah. - Didn't you have a date with Sadie? - Almost. - But then... - That girl Jess again? Yeah, I finally learned my lesson, but it might be too late. It's never too late. You just have to talk to her. Hey. Am I interrupting? Princess Sparkle's here for emotional support. Helping to cushion for the fall. Put her in her drawer, she shouldn't see what's about to happen. - That bad? - Now, for the next 20 minutes... ...or 24 hours if I turn out to be Sting, you have to keep an open mind. - What are you talking about? - lf you'll be so kind as to disrobe... ...we will begin with the wheelbarrow position. Oh, my God. As it turns out, I have recently been schooled in the art of tantric sex. - Where? Some pervy Internet chat room? - No, no, no, it was very tasteful. - Taylor came over... - What? Taylor, like, came over to your house and gave you one-on-one sex education? - Is that a no to the wheelbarrow? - I'll wheelbarrow you. Hi. My brother and I used to play with these. Especially when my mom was drinking... ...we'd go in the back bedroom and play cars... ...and pretend we didn't hear. He always used to tell me that he'd save up and buy us a Camaro one day. We'd blow town, never come back. Wasn't gonna happen, so one day he tried to steal one. I was there. Somehow that landed me here and him in Vegas. We don't talk anymore. And you didn't tell me because? I guess I'm not used to unloading on people. Too busy being loaded on, I guess. I don't know. But I wanted to start over with you. You know, I have many talents. One of them is listening. You just gotta let me do it. Deal. That's not to say we should just be talking. - Whoa. - Yeah, whoa. It's a good thing I put Princess Sparkle away for that. To think it was that amazing, and we didn't even get to the wheelbarrow. You know, we should make a pact. If we go away to college together... ...we should, like, fight, like, every day. I'm pretty sure I can make that happen.
