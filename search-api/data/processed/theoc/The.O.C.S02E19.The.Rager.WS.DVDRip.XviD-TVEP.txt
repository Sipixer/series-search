-You son of a bitch. That's your cue to hand me the briefcase. If I've never had sex before... ... why do I feel so horny? My old assistant is the VP... ...at a graphic-novel company. I arranged a meeting. You and Kirsten have been spending a lot of time working together. Long hours, late nights. Sandy, you have a great wife. Why would Trey steal anything though? I mean, everything's going great. I screwed up. There's no way Ryan's ever gonna forgive me. -I don't blame him. -I'll talk to him. In the morning, he's gone. I don't care where he goes. --explains that his job is considered plum duty in the CHP, even though.... -Good morning. -Morning, Mr. Cohen. So today's the big day, huh? Moving into your new apartment. -You got all your stuff? -Yeah. There's not much to get. -Sure you don't need anything? -No, thanks. You guys have done more than enough. You're Ryan's brother. We're happy to help. Still, there's not many people who'd take in an ex-con. -He's lucky to have you. -You're part of this family now. So if anything comes up... -...we're here. -Thanks. Grab yourself some breakfast. I'll drop you by your place on my way to work. I'm not really hungry. But I will take you up on the ride. Did you tell Ryan you're leaving? No. But it's okay. Yeah, I don't know what happened with you guys. In fact, I don't wanna know. It doesn't matter who was wrong. But someone has to be the first to reach out. There he is. I tell you, the timing in this household is a thing of beauty. I'm gonna leave you two to say your goodbyes. Trey, I'll be in the car. -Sandy's taking me to the apartment. -You got everything? You know, it's weird being able to fit your whole life into one bag. Look, Ryan, I know it hasn't been easy, man... ...but I want you to know I appreciate everything... -...you and the Cohens have done. -Funny way of showing it. Look, I'm sorry, Ryan. Okay? I screwed up. And you and Seth and Marissa, you guys saved my ass. I know that. Will you please just accept my apology? Don't keep Sandy waiting. -Hey, guys. -Hey. What's up? So, Ryan, doesn't Trey move into the apartment today? Yeah. He left this morning. Don't you think maybe we should go by, give him a housewarming gift? -He doesn't need anything. -You sure? He doesn't exactly seem overburdened with possessions. Unless that bag of his is like Mary Poppins'. -I wish I never made that reference. -Look, he's got his own place. He's out of our lives. Let him go. You know, you think maybe it's time to forgive him... ...for the whole yard-sale thing? -lt wasn't a thing. He stole. -Because he wanted to be near you. I appreciate what you guys are doing. But he's my brother. Just leave him alone. -Come in. Good morning. -Kirsten, congratulations. As of this morning, you are a bona fide magazine publisher. I know. The first issue's on the stands. -I was referring to our first libel suit. -What? Nick Morton. Newport Beach politico. Doesn't like the profile we ran. Thinks it makes him look sleazy. -You wrote that profile. -I know. I made him look sleazy. -Well, what are we supposed to do? -I thought I'd talk to Sandy. Yeah. You guys are friends now, so great. Julie's on her way over. I have to explain why she's not on the cover anymore. Hey, she's been to Europe, you know. Maybe she's become this unmaterialistic, humble, sweet person. -We're talking about Julie. -What about her? Julie. You're-- We were just saying how glad we are you're back. -Well, thank you, Kirsten. Carter. -Julie. -So how was ltaly? -Cal is still in Rome. A business thingy. But scandal or no scandal, I had to be back for our first issue. Julie, there's something that I need to tell you. After the whole.... Porno debacle. You can say it. There were letters. Lots of letters. And then the advertisers started threatening to cancel. So we had to take you off the cover. I' m sorry. -You did the right thing. -I did? Absolutely. Don't give it another thought. God, it's really good to see you. Both of you. I really missed you. I'm just saying that maybe I should do the talking this time. Zach, do not worry, okay? I promise you, this won't be another WildStorm. Look, I am calm, I am well rested. Reed's already read the pages, and he freaking loves them. He's driving from L.A. just to meet us. What do we know about this guy? What's he like? He was Carter's assistant before going to Bad Science. We've only e-mailed. I can't believe we're gonna have our own graphic novel. I know. I can't believe it's 2005. We were supposed to have personal jetpacks. -Who dropped the ball? -What are you talking about? -Hey. -Oh, hey. Summer. We were just-- We were-- Talking about your comic. Don't lie, okay? Graphic novel. It's just a little different. Right, well, I'm gonna head to class. And have a good one. I'm sorry, okay? I know I promised it wouldn't be weird... ...but I'm telling you this, from here on out... ...full disclosure. Okay? I'll tell you everything Zach and I do. I'm gonna let you know the ins and outs of whatever. -No. -What? I think you and Zach working together is a bad idea, but I can't stop it. -Come on. -No, so here's the deal: Whatever happens, I don't wanna know anything about it. Which means, as far as I'm concerned, your little comic doesn't exist. Graphic novel. A surfboard coffee table. I am in the O.C. Carter. It's good to see you. Yep, a little carpentry project while I'm between cases. I came at the right time. You ever do any libel work? One day on the stand, you already got a libel suit. Not bad. -Who is it? -Nick Morton. -Oh, that sleazebag. -He doesn't like to be called one in print. I'd be happy to help out. Libel cases are notoriously hard to prove. All your quotes are verbatim? Word for word. I'll give you the interview tapes. -Great. Should be a breeze. -You know, I used to surf. Grew up in Long lsland. Montauk Point. I'm heading out tomorrow. Come with me. I don't know. It's been such a long time. -I don't have a board. -I'll lend you one. And if Kirsten asks why I'm not at work? You can tell her we'll be talking about the case. Hey. -Marissa. -I brought you a little something. I figured this place could use some sprucing. That's a lava lamp. That's-- That's great. Ryan wanted to come, but he had this thing after school. Come in. I still haven't bought chairs and tables and stuff, but.... -Nice beanbag. -Yeah. It's kind of a stupid first thing to buy. It's an early birthday present to myself. -When's your birthday? -Saturday. Big 21. Though after being in prison, being able to buy beer feels a little anticlimactic. Do you want something to drink? I've got one glass, but I can wash it. No, no, that's okay. I should get going. But I'll see you later. Sure. Thanks again. He said he'd have all our stuff with him. Seth. Oh, my God. He's a she. That's terrible. Listen, Zach, I love girls, and I love comics. The two do not mix, okay? It'll be like, "Let's make their outfits cuter. " We're here. Let's give her the benefit of the doubt. You must be my two wunderkinds. Reed Carlson, Bad Science Comics. It's a pleasure. I'm Zach. This is Seth. I've been looking forward to this. That's great. Let's just get right to the project. Okay. I think that you have tapped into something real and compelling. I think the characters are vivid and engaging. Especially the lronist. -Really? -Yeah. He's smart, funny, hip. He is unlike anyone else in comics. Well, can I first just say how great it is to finally see a woman... -...involved in comics. -Thank you. We were actually thinking of expanding the lronist's role. Who came up with this business plan? -I did. -It's amazing. -Really? -I was a marketing minor in college. But the fact that you put this together and you're 1 7, I'm in awe. You're like a Doogie Howser meets Gordon Gekko, but with dimples. Well, I'm glad you liked it. That's my boss. Just a sec. Oh, hey, genius boy. Zach, right? Could you order me an iced tea? God, how great is it she liked my business plan? Yeah, it's really very-- It's very cool. -Hey. What's up? -Can I come in? Yeah. What's going on? You hungry? Want something to drink? -I'm fine. -Yeah? -I just came by to ask you something. -Oh, okay. Sure. Okay. Don't get mad. But I was thinking it might be nice to throw Trey a birthday party. -What? -We could do it at my house. By the pool. -You forgot. Saturday's his birthday. -No, l-- Yeah. Yeah, I did. You went over to see him, didn't you? -Ryan. -After I asked you not to. I brought him a lava lamp. It was no big deal. Why are you doing all this? Going over to see him, throwing him a birthday party. -He's your brother. -Exactly! He's my brother. And if everyone had just let me handle it... ...then none of this would have happened. So I'm asking you again, stop pushing it. I'm sorry. I thought-- I'm sorry. Ryan. Wake up. Ryan, wake up. No, get your own. Wake up, man. It's a beautiful day. The sun's shining. The birds are, you know.... Did I mention to you last night about meeting Reed? Beautiful, loves comics, will make you famous. Yes. Here's the thing. I'm a little worried about Zach. -Zach. -Yeah. You should've seen him. It was, "Reed" this, "Reed" that. It was kind of disgusting. And you're sure it's Zach who has the crush? I love Summer, okay? Reed is a colleague. I just don't want her to like Zach more than me. This is actually our first conversation... -...in here since Marissa left. -Let's not talk about her. What? Come on, we did me. Let's go around the horn. We got in a fight. She wanted to throw a birthday party for Trey. It's Trey's birthday? -Seth. -No, hang on. I'm just thinking... ...how, you know, sometimes it takes an event... ...Iike a birthday or a wake, to bring a family together. Think about this. Trey is blowing out his candles on his birthday. His only wish is that his brother forgives him. It's a pretty nice moment. -Good morning. -Hey. It feels so good to be home. How much do I wish you could have come to visit in ltaly. It was.... -lt was magical. -lf it was great, why'd you leave early? -Everything okay with Caleb? -Of course. I told you... ...I needed to come home for the magazine. And I missed you. Yeah. Do you have an address? I should have known. Honey, I have to go. But let's have dinner tonight, just the two of us. Okay? You're out of practice. Everybody hits themselves with their boards. -Three times in one wave? -Well, that was impressive. Still, surfing the O.C., it's a world away from Long lsland. -Hey, Sandy. -Erin. How you doing? You going out? I don't have to make rounds for a while, so I figured I'd get in the water. -Hi. -Erin, Carter Buckley. He runs Newport Living, my wife's company's magazine. Y eah. That came to the office yesterday. I read the profile on Nick Morton. -Way to skewer him. -Carter wrote that. And now we're being sued. Erin's an orthopedist in town and an excellent surfer. Carter's just getting back into it. Yeah, today I mastered hitting myself in the face. Well, any time Sandy's busy and you need a surf buddy, give me a call. -Y eah, thank you. I might do that. -All right. See you guys. Yeah, it's world away from Long lsland, I'll tell you. And he got mad because you wanted to throw a party for his brother? Oh, it's not just the party. It's been building. I mean, Trey coming here has been really hard for him. Well, you tried. If he doesn't want a relationship with his brother, that's his problem. I'd hate for him to realize two years from now... ...how important his brother is and to have lost him. My God, you are the most supportive non-girlfriend in history. If something important was happening in Seth's life, you'd be there for him. Right. Of course. And then when she started talking about how lron Man's armor, his old armor... ...is actually better than his Ultimate armor.... -Dude, it-- -l.... What about when she threw down on the whole Cyclops-versus-Storm debate? I never thought talking about comic books could be so sexy. A beautiful girl who loves comics. I didn't even know they existed. It's like finding a unicorn, Zach. It's like finding a really hot unicorn. It's just too bad you have a girlfriend. Otherwise-- I was thinking you could ask her out, but now you're working together. So there's that whole professional-ethics thing. Y eah, I was wondering, how did Summer take the fact that Reed's a woman? She's not bothered by a late night's work? Summer doesn't wanna know anything about the entire enterprise. So I couldn't tell her even if I wanted to. -Hey, guys. -Hey. -What's going on? -Nothing. Actually, we were just talking about Reed. -Who's Reed? -Seth will tell you. See you later. Who's Reed? You don't wanna know. A comic book rep. No, I do. -You do? -Yeah. Look, I've changed my mind. I know this comic book is important to you... ...so it's important to me. I wanna know everything. -Everything? -Yeah. Jules. How the hell did you find me? Well, it was easy, Lance. I just looked for the cheapest, scummiest motel... ...near a liquor store, and voilà. May I come in? I guess so. Listen, Jules, I don't know what you're thinking, but-- -What the hell is that? -It's a gun, genius. You use it to shoot people you wanna kill. All right, here's what happened. What happened. What happened is... ...that you humiliated me in front of my friends and family. I've been kicked out of every organization I belong to. My own magazine has taken me off the cover. And at home... ...I have a teenage daughter who sooner or later will find out that her mother... ...was a pornographer. -Let's just be reasonable here, Jules. -I am being reasonable. In one night, you destroyed a life... ...I spent almost 20 years building. -So I'm here to kill you. -Jules, wait! There's no bullets. No. Unfortunately. But for just a second... ...I wanted you to feel like your life was being taken away. Hey. I'm headed out to pick up some Thai. You wanna come? Can't. Studying history. Well, you know what's on the way to the Thai place? The apartment of a certain ex-con I know. That's quite a sell. You're just not gonna see him? People who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. I've learned. Yeah, but your great victory's gonna be what... ...not seeing your brother anymore? Congratulations. Look, I'm not even talking about, like, having him move in... ...or helping him find a job or anything. I mean, literally mean, "Happy birthday. " Four syllables. -Four syllables. That's it. -Yeah. Or six. "Hey, Trey, happy birthday. " Hey. -You just get home? -Yeah. I sent Seth out for Thai. Oh, perfect. Did Carter tell you about surfing this morning? You know, he's a little rusty, but he's definitely got some skills. Did you two manage to discuss the case at all during your bonding session? Well, you know, a little. Coming out of the water, we ran into Erin Lee, that young orthopedist. I think there are definitely some sparks between her and Carter. So I was thinking we should have them over for dinner. You know, set them up. -Wait, you're serious. -Yeah. Carter's new in town. He doesn't know that many people. -Fine, sure. -Great. I'll make the calls. All right, just in and out. "Happy 21 st," then we're at the Thai place. -This is a mistake. He'll never change. -Dude, you gotta trust people more. -There he is. -All right, great. Let's go. No, wait, wait. Would you relax? He's probably just going to buy cigarettes. Or getting into that suspicious-looking Camaro... ...with a guy who looks like Lou Reed. All right. Hope you like cold Thai. It's his 21 st birthday. I'm sure he's just going out for a drink. Stop it. Pull over. They're probably just picking up a friend. In a dark alley. Who he owes some money to. All right. All right. Oh, my God, you have to be kidding me. What's up, man? -What is your problem?! -You are unbelievable. I saw you last night. What'd you buy? Coke? Speed? Get rid of it right now. -Oh, God, man. -I am an idiot for ever believing in you. Here. Why don't you call my parole officer... ...because it was his car I got into last night. -What? -Yeah. Guy in the alley? A buddy from prison who got out a few months ago and disappeared. I asked my PO to find him because I was worried. -You gave him money. -He asked me for 5 bucks. The guy's living in a trash can. I was trying to convince him to go to a shelter. That's it, Ry. And you know, it's funny. Because when I saw you, I thought to myself: "My brother's come over to take me out to breakfast for my birthday. " You know, maybe I'm the idiot, for believing. -Hey. -Hey. Hope I'm not.... Can l...? So I'm sorry about the other day. I was out of line. He's your brother. I should've just respected that. You didn't do anything wrong. I was taking out my frustration with him on you. So does that mean you'll give him another chance? Well, if he's willing to give me one. Last night, Seth and l kind of followed him. We hadn't meant to at first. But we did. We thought we saw him trying to buy drugs. So this morning-- -You went and accused him. -Pretty much. And no drugs? He was helping out a homeless guy. I don't know what to do. Well, as it happens, you've come to the right place. Seth, these new pages are great. Yeah. They're, you know, sketches, mostly, but thank you. I owe Carter big. You and Zach are a find. Yeah. Yeah, we're a good team. I mean, I come up with the stories, I write the dialogue, I draw the pages... ...and Zach handles the late-night coffee runs. Seriously, if you need a bone-dry cappuccino, Zach's-- He's your go-to guy. So.... Where is Zach? I thought he was coming. Is it Saturday? He's probably getting a haircut. You wouldn't know it, but he spends a lot of time grooming. Let me ask you, did you get, like, a slight gay vibe from him at all? -What? -Excuse me. Hey, what's up, girl--? Girl--? Girlfriend? Hey. Cohen, I need your help. I'm actually in a meeting right now with-- With Reed. Okay. When you're done with him, meet me at Marissa's. I love these Little Miss Vixen sketches. -Who was that? -The waitress. I'm gonna call you back in a little bit. Okay. Bye. -That's my mom. -You call you mom "girlfriend"? -Mrs. Cooper-Nichol? -Yeah. -Hey. -Marissa. What are you doing here? -Come on. I'm taking you out. -What? I'm taking you out. It's your birthday. No arguments. Okay. Okay. All right. Let me get my keys. Afraid someone's gonna steal your beanbag? Yeah, actually. Come on. I can't believe I forgot my wallet. It'll just take a second. So where are we going to dinner? Well, actually... ...I was thinking maybe we could eat in. -Surprise. -Surprise. Surprise. Well, happy birthday, dude. Yes, happy birthday. Happy birthday. Sorry, bro. All right, we have hot dogs and hamburgers and kielbasas for you. Cohen learned how to use the grill. It's a major life achievement. That's right. I grilled some corn, some veggies. Found something in Marissa's fridge, I just grilled it. Sounds great. Marissa, I have to go out for a bit. Can I trust you while I'm gone? Yes, Mom. It's only us and maybe girls from the Charity League. Well, I don't wanna come home and find I'm living in Delta House. -ls that Ryan's brother? -Yeah. Okay. Well, since he's 21, I guess it would be okay if he had a beer. But just one. See? I can be a cool mom too. Bye, honey. We should drive down to Swamis. It's crowded, but it's got a killer right. -Count me in. Hey, Kirsten. -Hey, Carter. You look nice. Oh, thanks. Sandy told me to spiff it up a bit. Yeah, I didn't want him to embarrass us. That must be Erin. I-- I hope this isn't strange or.... No. It's not. It's fun. You know, because this wasn't my-- I didn't-- -Carter, you remember Erin. -Yes, I do. -Hi. Hi. -Hi. -My wife, Kirsten. -Nice to meet you. -You too. -I told Carter... ...we should go to Swamis. What do you think? Sure. I'd love to. Come on outside. The best thing about this place are the sunsets. Lead the way. You all go. I'll bring the wine. Yeah, come on out to the patio. Watch your step. We got about a minute and a half till the sunset is just magic. -Thanks for coming. -Just tell me what I'm doing here. "lf you want the rest, meet me. " What do you expect to get? -My life is already ruined. -Look, I don't want anything. Here. It's-- It's the rest of the tapes. Look, just yesterday I got offered $8500 for them, but I said no. You want points for turning down 8 grand... -...after fleecing Caleb for 500,000? -I didn't get a penny out of Caleb. -What are you talking about? -Yeah. After he got the master tape, he had me beaten up. And threatened a lot worse. But I guess he didn't tell you that. No. I thought he would just pay up. You know, to protect his wife and all. But I guess a guy like Caleb Nichol doesn't mind taking chances. Yeah, when it's my reputation he's gambling. Jules, I never meant to hurt you, honestly. But after he did that.... Well, you know what I'm like when I think I'm being cheated. -Yeah, I remember. -lf I had the money, I'd give it to you. Every cent. But I don't. I got nothing. Not even the 8500. Got enough to buy me a drink? So how many people would you say you invited? -Four. -Me too. I don't even know four other people. Looks like word spread. Yeah. -Hey, check out Zach and that hottie. -Hey. That's.... -She's a very attractive woman. -She looks a little older. -Like maybe she's in college. -Yeah. Maybe he'll bring her out. I see somebody doing magic by the pool. Let's check that out. Magic tricks. Definitely somebody you invited. -You won't get in trouble for this, right? -No. It's not like I'm throwing a rager. -Hello. -ls there a party here? -Yeah. -This is it! -I think the word has spread. -Yeah. Chug! Chug! Chug! Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt your drinking. I'm looking for Zach. He plays water polo too. Are you talking to me, geek? I think the kicking the comic-book guy's ass, we're probably past it. Wow, your hand goes all the way around. Kind of hard to breathe. Stop it, man. Stop it. I got a game tomorrow. Yeah? Then I suggest you go home and get some sleep. -You okay? -Thanks, dude. It's déjà vu. O.C. party, attacked by a water-polo guy... ...saved by an Atwood. Hello. That was amazing. Do you, like, know aikido or something? Okay, I'll just go. -I'm Jess. -Hi. Trey. Nice tat. Thanks. It's a buddha smoking a joint. -That's very artistic. -I'd show you the rest... ...but my boyfriend's probably watching. -We can go somewhere else. -Sure. -Zach. -Seth. Hey, dude. You wanna explain yourself maybe? -What are you talking about? -Reed. Remember the professional-ethics conversation? Oh, yeah, like not letting me know there was a meeting? -You were like, "l have things to do. " -Why are you telling her I'm gay? I said "gay vibe. " I distinctly remember saying "gay vibe. " The two are different. Okay, then how about me getting you cappuccinos? Bone-dry? -What does that even mean? -God, what is she, a court reporter? Excuse me. Sorry. Look, okay? I don't really wanna get into this right now, okay? You look for your date, and I'll look for mine. Fine. Finally, somewhere private. -You don't go to Harbor, do you? -No. I just moved here. -From where? -Prison. Did you kill someone? No. I stole a car. So, what's a car thief doing at a Newport rager? Well, actually... ...this is my birthday party. Well, convict... ...time to open your present. Oh, my gosh, no. But what was the name of that other guy? -Dwight. -Oh, no! Oh, Dwight. No, he had that birthmark. No, I'm talking about the one who always said-- Oh, what was it? -"Bottom line. " -Oh, my God. Everything was "bottom line. " "Vegas, bottom line: -You're gonna get screwed. " -"Screwed. " -Or he'd say, "Bottom line, I'm--" -What? -Oh, my God. -What? -Do you remember this concert? -You threw your shirt at the band. -No, no. That was the Ratt concert. -Oh, you went through a lot of shirts. This is actually pretty fun. But-- Hold on. Don't go yet. One more drink. For Whitesnake. -For Whitesnake. -Yes. Bring it on. -Sorry. -Oh, no, come in. There are already a couple people in the shower anyway. Wonderful. -Aren't you here with Zach? -Yeah. I mean, just as friends. -He's a great guy, isn't he? -Oh, my God. So sweet. And cute. Can't believe he doesn't have a girlfriend. Well, some girls at our school can be idiots. I know this sounds crazy, but have you ever heard of Little Miss Vixen? Yeah. How do you know about Little Miss Vixen? Do you know Seth? Y eah, l' m working with him on his comic book. I'm Reed. You ass! He's a she! -Hey. What are you doing? -Reed's a girl. Okay, l-- I never said-- Don't you dare. Don't even pretend you didn't lie. -I knew you would get the wrong idea. -Oh, right, this is my fault. I wouldn't wanna know that my boyfriend met... ...some gorgeous 23-year-old who loves comics... ...and thinks he's the next Brian Bendis, whatever that means. She said that? She thinks I'm the next Bendis? -Oh, my God. -Hey. Summer, I'm sorry. I should have told you. Zach! Zach, hey, are you leaving? -Yeah. -Can I get a ride? Yeah. -Summer, please. -Cohen, just shut up. Because even when you're not lying, you're lying. -Poison rocked. -They did, they did. Oh, baby, I think it's time to get you home. Oh, yeah. Home, great. Home, yeah. Caleb's gonna divorce me. -Jules. -No, you know... ...he said he didn't judge me about the whole.... You know. But all during this trip he didn't even look at me. I mean.... And when he did, I could see it in his eyes. He was disgusted. That's not true. That's why I came home early. I couldn't take it anymore. So yeah, he'll divorce me. I'll have no money... ...no career, no friends, nothing... ...for me and my girls. What if something was to happen to Caleb? What do you mean? Nineteen years ago, when you left me for that guy, Cooper... ...my life just felt like it stopped, you know? But seeing you again... ...I feel like I'm finally waking up. Feels good. -Lance. -No. What's happening to you is my fault. So if getting rid of Caleb means you and your daughters... ...will be taken care of... ...I'll do it. Looking good, pal. Hey, there you are. And you're drinking water. -Someone's gotta be responsible. -Yeah. Hey. Okay, that's it. I don't even wanna deal with this. Excuse me. This is my room. You want in? Get out. Dude. Your mom would understand, don't you think? -lf she came home right now? -Oh, definitely. I mean, she did say Trey could have a beer. All right, listen, thank you for everything you've done for Trey. If it wasn't for you, he and l.... You've been amazing. I know what it's like to have someone believe in you when no one else does. Oh, my God. -Who is it? -I don't know. -ls she breathing? -I don't know. Get her out. Get her out. I remember that article you wrote... -...about the cheated stockholders. -I got sued for that one too. But you were right. Now look at Tyco and Enron. -You were years ahead of everyone else. -Still got sued. You ever think about holding back, playing it safe? You know, at the risk of sounding pompous... ...if you're not gonna tell the truth, what's the point? Just a minute. Excuse me. Yeah? Kirsten, dinner was.... Dinner was great. Thank you. I'm glad you both could make it. -I'll be right there. -What is it? The kids threw a party for Trey. It got out of hand. Some girl took drugs. She passed out in the pool. -Are Seth and Ryan okay? -They're okay... ...but I gotta get over there. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. Oh, I should move my car. Thank you. -I'll call you. -Okay. Well.... Here, let me help you. I'm so sorry things had to end this way. I know. I had a great time. Carter seems really wonderful. He is. Just be careful. What do you mean? His divorce was really hard on him. He's divorced. And not over her yet, right? Well, I think he is. It's just that the wounds are still raw. But he's a great guy. I just thought you should know. No, l.... I appreciate it. Thank you. -ls she gonna be okay? -Stand back. Hey, what's going on? Where you been? I.... -What, you know her? -Seth. Ryan. Everybody okay? -What about the girl? -Don't know. -Do you live here, sir? -No. My name is Sandy Cohen. I'm responsible for these four. -Who lives here? -I do. -Where's your parents? -Mom's out. She's not answering her cell. Turn around. I'm gonna have to take you in. Officer, what are you doing? We found a bag of ecstasy. I'm betting somebody gave it to that girl. Till I find out who supplied the drugs, I'm arresting the owner of the house. I gave them to her. I brought the drugs. Trey. I'm sorry. Keep your mouth shut. I'll meet you in jail. Officer, I'm his lawyer. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you.
