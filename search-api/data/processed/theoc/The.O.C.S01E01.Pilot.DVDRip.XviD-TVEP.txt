- Quit being a little bitch! Get in! Yeah! Let's go! Get in! Come on, let's go, Ryan! You know, you should see your face, man! No! No! Let me see those hands! Let's go! Hands up! Get them up! On the dash, where I can see them. Let's go. Ryan. Sandy Cohen. The court's appointed me your public defender. You could do worse. You okay? They treating you all right? Where's my brother? Trey is over 18. Trey stole a car. Trey had a gun in his pants, an ounce of pot in his jacket, a couple of priors. I'm guessing right now Trey is looking at three to five years. But Trey's not my concern. This is your first time in lockup. I'm assuming you don't plan on coming back. Your grades are not great. Suspended twice for fighting, truancy three times. Your test scores. Ninety-eighth percentile on your SAT I's. Ryan, 98th percentile. If you start going to class... Are you thinking about college? Have you given any thought at all to your future? Dude, I'm on your side. Help me out here, give... Modern medicine is advancing to the point where the average life span will be 100. But I read this article which said Social Security is supposed to run out by 2025... ...which means people are gonna have to stay in their jobs until they're 80. So I don't want to commit to anything too soon. Look, I can plea this down to a misdemeanor. Petty fine, probation. But stealing a car because your big brother told you to... ...it's stupid and it's weak. Those are two things you can't afford to be anymore. - Two more things. - Want to change that? Then get over the fact that life dealt you a bad hand. I get it. We're cut from the same deck, Ryan. I grew up with no money, my father was gone, my mother worked all the time. I was pissed off, I was stupid. Look at you now. Smart kid like you, you gotta have a plan, some kind of a dream. Yeah. Right. Let me tell you something, okay? Where I'm from, having a dream doesn't make you smart. Knowing it won't come true? That does. My office will contact you to remind you of your hearing date. I'll remember. Unbelievable. What kind of family I got, huh? What the hell did I do to deserve this family? You want to tell me that? Mrs. Atwood? I'm Sandy Cohen. I'm Ryan's attorney. You should have let him rot in there. Just like his dad's doing, and just like his brother's gonna. Let's go, Ryan. Now, Ryan! I'm gonna give you my card and my home number. You know, if you need somebody, if things get to be too much... ...call me. - Let's go! - All right. I can't do this anymore, Ryan. I can't. - I'm sorry, Mom. - I want you out of my house. - I want you out. - But, Mom, where am I gonna go? - You heard your mother, man. Get out. - This isn't your house, man. - Oh, you a tough guy now? - A.J., don't. Ryan, just get out. You should worry about your own kids instead of freeloading off my mom. Hey. Can I crash with you tonight? Yeah, all right. Fine. I need a place to crash tonight. I already tried it. I already tried it! I told you. You could do worse. This is a nice car. I didn't know your kind of lawyer made money. No, we don't. My wife does. Good evening, Mr. Cohen. You know, why don't you wait here for a minute. I'll be back. It's no fun if the key's in the car. - <i>T- shirt and bumper stickers</i> from the radio station. You brought him home? - This is not a stray puppy, Sandy. - I know that, Kirsten. It was only a matter of time before you started bringing home felons. - Ryan's not a felon. - Did you not meet him in jail? Yes, technically. But it wasn't for a felony. It was, but it won't be when I'm done. You're endangering our home. Did you even think of Seth? It's only for the weekend. Till Child Services opens on Monday. What if this is all a scam? What if he's using you to case the house? He's not a criminal mastermind. He's a kid who has no one, and nowhere to go. - When did you become so cynical? - When did you become so self-righteous? I've always been self-righteous. - You used to find it charming. - He sleeps in the pool house. - Where you going? - To put my jewelry in the vault. Where do you think I'm going? The boy's gonna need fresh sheets... ...and towels and a toothbrush. - Who are you? - Whoever you want me to be. Okay. Hey, can I bum a cigarette? So, what are you doing here? Seriously. Seriously? I stole a car. Crashed it. Actually, my brother did. Since he had a gun and drugs on him, he's in jail. I got out, then my mom threw me out. She was pissed off and drunk. So Mr. Cohen took me in. You're their cousin from Boston, right? Right. - Hi, Marissa. - Hey, Mr. Cohen. I was just meeting your nephew. My favorite nephew, Ryan. All the way from Seattle. - Seattle. - Dad lives there. Mom lives in Boston. So we're all really excited about your fashion show fundraiser tomorrow. Really? You are? No. Come on, let's go. Hey, you should come by, check it out. If you don't have other plans. - See you. - Good night. Who's that kid? Let's go inside. There's no smoking in this house. So this is where you'll be staying. And this is the queen of the manor herself, my wife, Kirsten. Hello, Ryan. Welcome to our home. If you need anything, Rosie here can help you. Thank you. Thanks very much. We'll see you in the morning. Make yourself comfortable. Hey. Hey. Do you wanna play? Looks like someone's trying to be a hero, but he got a little cocky. What happened to your head, dude? Where did it go? I'm sorry. Did someone die? Hey, want to play "Grand Theft Auto"? It's pretty cool. You can steal cars and... Not that that's cool. - Or uncool, I don't know... - I see you two have met. Seth, what are you doing inside on this beautiful day? - Why don't you show Ryan around? - Because it's so great around here. There's so much to do, Dad. I don't know, what do you want to do? What do you guys do around here? I have this plan. I don't know what you'll think. But next July the trade winds shift west, and I want to sail to Tahiti. I could do it in 44 days, maybe even 42. Wow, that... - That sounds really cool, man. - Yeah. You just hit the high seas... ...and catch fish off the side of the boat, grill them right there. Just total quiet. Solitude. - You won't get Ionely? - Well, I'll have Summer with me. You're gonna take this to Tahiti? No. It's the girl the boat's named after. She must be pretty stoked. Yeah. She has no idea. I've never talked to her before. Hey, fellas. I thought we'd head over to the fashion show at 7. Yeah. Have fun. - Come on. It's a whole new school year. - It's also the same kids, Dad. Why do they need a fashion show? Every day is a fashion show for them. Ryan has to go. Marissa invited him. Marissa invited you? I've lived next door to Marissa since, like, forever. Her dad almost got married to my mom. And she's never even invited me to a birthday. That is not true. They did not almost get married. Maybe Summer would be there. That's interesting. She is Marissa's best friend. - Seven? - Seven. - Hello again. - My dad's not here. - When can we expect him? - I don't know. Well, when you see your father... ...please remind him again how much we'd like to talk. Let me leave you another one of my cards. Have a good day. Hey. Thanks, kiddo. I just didn't have time to deal with those guys right now. Who are they? Suits. Bureaucrats. The Man. But, I mean, everything's okay, right? Yeah. It's just a... Just a thing with a client. Nothing for you to worry about, okay? Wow, look at that. It fits you beautifully. Where's your tie? I'm not gonna wear one. Open collar, it's a good look. I didn't know how to tie a tie till I was 25. Come on, give me your tie. Button your top button. All right. Collar up. The skinny side has got to be shorter than the fat side. How much shorter, it changes tie to tie. Sometimes it's just a mystery. All right. So you got to hang out with Seth. How was that? Was that...? Was that all right? He's an interesting kid if you get to know him. He's cool. Cool, huh? All right. There we go. Turn around. Look at you. Beats a jumpsuit. Oh, Mom, do you like my nails? I love them, Kaitlin. Do you like my hair this straight, or is it too Avril Lavigne? No, it looks good, Mom. Marissa, you look... Oh, honey, I thought you were gonna wear your hair down. Pulled back like that, it's harsh on your angles. Okay. Let's go. It's gonna be so amazing tonight. Are you gonna wear the Donna Karan, Mariss? It's very forgiving. You look beautiful, kiddo. Mushroom-leek crescent? Crab-and-brie filo? Welcome to the dark side. So you must be the cousin from Boston. I don't know how you do it. I could just never live there. I hate the cold. Do you like Seattle? I mean, all that rain. Isn't it depressing? Did I hear you were from Canada? Yes, you did. - Hi. Can I get a 7 and 7? - Sure. Thanks. Thank you. I want my husband to be right about you. - What's up? Lock it up, Nordlund. - Lock it up, Luke. Hey, Luke. What's up? - Hey. - Hey. Suck it, queer. My vacation was great too. Thank you for asking about it. Summer's right over there. Don't look. You can look, but don't look like you're looking. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, guys. Who is that? The cousin? The pool boy? I don't know. Well, I'm gonna find out. Is that Summer? I'm gonna... I'm gonna sit. Way to salt his game, Mr. Cohen. Hello, Chester. Are these seats taken? Okay. So are you looking forward to your next sailing lesson? You're making strides. Okay. I'm glad we had this little chance to catch up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much for coming. Every year we do this to raise money for the battered women's shelter. It's such a good cause, you guys. We couldn't do any of it without your support... ...and the support of Fashion Island and all their great stores. All right, enjoy the show. She's got Tahiti written all over her. Has anybody seen my Betsey Johnson dress? All right. Oh, no. Much too much makeup. Let's go. What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? She was supposed to wear Vera Wang. She would if she had the chest to hold it up. It's called puberty. It'll happen. Okay, girls, chop-chop, showtime. Marissa, you're next. Look what I stole! Look what I stole! - All right! Here. - Thanks. She's so beautiful, you guys. You spent more on that dress than I make in a year. That's why we trust him with our money. I expect to die a very rich man. You're bound to be half-right. You okay, Jimmy? Yeah. It's just... It's a little stuffy in here. Honey, I'm gonna get some fresh air, okay? Marissa wanted to wear these Prada Mary Janes... ...but I told her she had to wear the stiletto Manolos. Hey, where are you going? My friend Holly... Well, her parents are letting us use their beach house... ...as a gift because of all our hard work for charity. If you need a ride... ...or anything... ...I'm Summer. - Hey, you ready to go? - Yeah. We should go to that party at that girl Holly's place. - No, that's not really for us. - Summer invited me. Really? She did? Us. She... She asked for you, actually. Really? She did? Come on! That makes absolutely no sense, but, yes, we should go. We're gonna go with them. Thanks, guys. If it sucks, we can always bail. Welcome to the dark side. Oh, hey, cocaine. That's awesome. - Is that a new purse? - Yeah. - So cute. - Does your dad ever say no? Hey. Look who I brought. He's cute. I'm gonna play him hot and cold. You wanna pee? I've gotta pee. Isn't it, like, so beautiful? The sand and the water. Yeah. Hey, you want to go check it out? But what about Marissa? Oh, no worries. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey. Hey, Dustin. Dustin, look who's here. - Are you really okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Because you can always... - I've just been working really hard. So who was that kid that you brought tonight? You have a cousin from Boston? One of Sandy's clients. He brought him home for the weekend. Jimmy? Honey, did you get my fro-yo? No. I forgot. All right, I'll go back. Pistachio. Thanks, sweetie. Hi, Kirsten. Fro-yo. Did you ever think this would be our lives? - Is Marissa back yet? - Well, she usually stays out pretty late. Well, Seth never goes out. Don't worry. I'm sure they're not doing anything we didn't do. That's comforting. I'm sorry. I should really learn to knock... ...in case there's a threesome going on in the bathroom. Fresh keg! Everybody get naked! Hey. - Hey. - So, what do you think of Newport? I think I can get in less trouble where I'm from. Hey, Coop, it's your turn to deal. You have no idea. I fixed the keg. Fine, more for me. Look who I found. I'm wasted. - So, what's your name anyway? - Ryan. Ryan. - What are you doing? - Excuse me. What are you doing? I named my boat after her. What? Who are you? It's not what you think. She's drunk. Come on. - Seth, Seth. - Don't touch me! You know what, why don't you just go back to Chino? I'm sure there's a really nice car in the parking lot that you could steal. Chino? - Go home, geek. - Who invited you, suck-ass? You guys really wouldn't hurt me, because that would be so clich Ád. - I guess you're fans of the clich Á. - Shut up. Hey, put him down! Put him down. Hey, Ryan. What's up? Put him down. Hey, what's up, dude? You got a problem? You tell me. Welcome to the O.C., bitch. This is how it's done in Orange County. Well... ...I don't know what to say... ...except that you totally had my back out there. You were, like, out of <i>Fight Club</i> or something. I don't know. You know what I think? Ryan, I think that if you were to teach me some moves... ...I think that we could totally take them next time. A little bit of that, you know what I mean? And a little bit of that, that. What do you think about that? Yeah. Oh, also, that wasn't exactly the way that I first planned to talk to Summer... ...but I'm now on her radar. Do you think I should tell her about Tahiti? Do you? - Not yet. - That's what I thought. That's what I was thinking. I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. What a little night we had there. I'm not gonna forget it. Ryan, I'm not gonna forget that one. - I can't believe her! - She's so retarded sometimes. Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this? He's so worthless. Coop! Where are your keys? How are we gonna find her keys? I can't find her keys. We can't wake her parents. Her dad will go ballistic. I know. Bye, Coop. Call us. Hey. Get your keys. Thank God. - What happened to your face? - I got into a fight. - With who? Why? - I don't really know. I don't remember. I was really drunk. I think I still am a little bit. Let's go. House. Now. You should have seen the waves coming in. Six foot, and it was going off. - Seth got into a fight. - He did? This is what happens when you let our son hang out with criminals. At least he has someone to hang out with. Don't salt his game, honey. - What the hell does that mean? - It... I don't know. I just know I'd rather have Seth hanging out with Ryan... ...than some trust-fund kid... ...who only cares about getting a new Beemer every year. There's a whole world outside this Newport Beach bubble. You don't seem to mind living in this bubble. I know there's something else out there. Remember when we were 22? What'd you say? That you'd never be like your parents, you'd never have their life. I was 22. I stank of patchouli and lived in the back of a mail truck. And you were fun. And rebellious and... You married me. I can't. I'm sorry. I don't want this kid in my house anymore. Where's he supposed to go? He has a family, Sandy. It's not up to you to decide whether or not they're good enough. Look, Ryan, I don't mean to play bad cop. It's nothing personal. Is that bacon? I usually make breakfast at my house. My mom's not much of a cook, so... - I'm sorry. You seem like a really nice kid. - It's okay. I get it. You have a really nice family. Hey, man. - Hey. - Hi. So I gotta jet. You're leaving? So... So, what's up? I gotta go back, try to figure some stuff out back home. Okay, well... Cool. Not cool, but, you know what I think I mean. Come here. I'll come down to Chino. I'll visit you, and you can show me your world... ...or, you know, "'hood" or... All right. Wait a second. Just wait one second. Maybe there's someplace you'll want to go. It's pretty good for ideas. Okay. So thanks... ...for everything. I'm gonna make sure
