concerning Griffin and you. They're gonna call for a criminal investigation. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I am not gonna use my alcoholism... ...as blackmail to save our marriage. - Are you smoking pot? - You want some? It helps take the edge off, and I could tell you could use it. Seth's napkin confession, detailing all his lies and deceptions. He told me that if he screwed up, I could show this to his parents. I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter. Oh, my God, the letter. Did you think you were gonna just dress up your bad boy... ...so your friends can see how cool you are? The Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom. The money is gone. I had the money in my purse. I had $5000 in my purse. We get some help over here? - He get hit with a baseball bat? - No, no. - How long has he been unconscious? - I got here as soon as I could. Do you know them? The guys who did this. You know who they are? I got jumped. Didn't see them. Look, I'm okay. Glad you're alive, but we still gotta check you out. Police will question you too. Yeah, okay. Meet me at my place tomorrow. This ain't over. - Where's your friend? - He's not my friend. Kaitlin? - <i>Hey, sis.</i> - Hey. You just calling to say hi? Totally. So how's your life? How's Ryan, what did you do last night, give me the deets. Well, Ryan and I broke up and my prom date got with another girl. Oh, really? That's great. I'm actually calling to ask you a favor. Your friend Megan needs another abortion? I wish. But actually, my school sent Mom a letter... ...and I need you to get it for me. And by "get" do you mean keep it from her? Look, I'm totally all over this situation. I just need a little bit more time. - Oh, Kaitlin. - Look, Marissa, I'm begging you. If you have one sisterly bone in your body, you'll do this for me. Please. I'll see if it's there. But you have to promise to tell me why. - Oh, thank you. I love you. - Okay. I love you... ...too. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing? Nothing much. How about you? Just got off the phone with the guy. The work guy. How did that go? Oh, not well. It's kind of hard for a 28-year-old to understand prom. I get that. But you... You don't regret going, do you? No, not at all. I had fun. And after you left, things got interesting in the limo... ... with Taylor, and the dates, and... I don't know what the Korean word for threesome is... ...but I'm pretty sure it was used. - Ryan? - Yup? That thing that you had to take care of last night... It's taken care of. Okay. Do you wanna hang out today? I have to do something. I'm not sure for how long. Well, how about later? For dinner? - I could bring over takeout. - That sounds good. - Okay. - Yeah, okay. Hey, man. Today's a good day for me, Ryan. I finally told the truth about not getting into Brown... ...and things are great. Life is so much better when you're honest. You just mean what you say, you say what you mean. I feel like you. Now that you're on a roll, you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten too? I don't think so. I'm gonna wait a little bit on that. It'll go down easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand. - What if they find out? - They won't. Things are finally good with Summer. Can't this family have one weekend without crisis? Hey, Sum. How are you? I wish I could pluck out my eyeballs... ...and rinse them in a tall glass of ice water. Yeah, that's a hangover. You were pretty wasted last night. I was, wasn't I? I don't even remember getting home. I woke up this morning and my ears were ringing... ...and then I realized it was your phone. Kaitlin was calling me because there's a letter from school she wants me to grab. - Something... - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The letter. What? How do you know what it is? No, no. Cohen's confession. I left it in an envelope on Sandy's desk. Oh, so call Seth. Tell him to grab it. I can't. Things are finally normal between us. Once he realizes what I did... I gotta go! Oh, my God. Nausea tsunami. Well, it's a little unexpected. But l... This hospital project has been... It's been complicated. Well, I'm glad to hear it. I look forward to tomorrow night. Thank you. Well... You're not gonna believe this. I am <i>Riviera</i> magazine's "Man of The Year." Try not to faint. Sorry. It's just, given everything that's happened... They're calling the hospital phase one of Orange County's "renaissance." It could be a model for responsible development for the entire country. Responsible development? Sandy, the only thing it's responsible for... ...is a lot of sleepless nights and Matt Ramsey's black eye. My father was "Man of the Year." The irony's not lost on me. Believe me. But this could mean that maybe the dark days are over. That something good is coming from all this. I'd like to think so. - But I honestly doubt it. - I wasn't expecting a blessing. But until we have proof to the contrary, let's try to be optimistic. - Hey. - Why don't you say good morning... ...to Newport's Man of the Year. It was only a matter of time before this town recognized my contribution. Have to be a man first. Congratulations. Thank you. Party tomorrow night. Everybody's gotta dress up... ...and represent. Just think, I couldn't get you to wear a tie at cotillion. College letters, senior prom. This family's on a streak. Let's try to enjoy it. - I gotta go. - Me too. You excited? It'll be good for your father's career. Oh, my God, Mr. C. You totally scared me. Sometimes I scare myself, Summer. Seth's in the kitchen. - I'll just go right in. - All right. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Looking for stamps. - Are you mailing a letter? Not without stamps. Let's go make out upstairs. Hey. Is everything okay? You sounded weird on the phone. Can you give that to Taylor? What, her after-party money? It was stolen at the prom. Kevin? I can't believe he stole that. - I should go over there and kick his... - No, no. We got the money, so forget it. And I don't really wanna talk about it... ...but if you could just give it to Taylor... ...that would be good. - Yeah. You can count on me. I need to focus on other stuff. I was gonna take a road trip this weekend. So maybe I should just go home and pack. Can I buy you breakfast? Sure. Where was your dad going this morning? You're thinking about my dad? He had his briefcase with him. Does he keep important papers in there? You're turning me on. I'm sorry. Cohen, there's something I need to tell you. - You're using me to get to my father? - It's serious. So is this. We just got back together. The window for a make-up is closing... ...unless you wanna break up again. - Definitely not. Okay. So, what did you have to tell me? I wanna be on top this time. But you're always on top. Of course we'll be there. Hey, it's something to celebrate. Okay. Bye, Kiks. - Hey. Good news? - Yes. Sandy Cohen has just been named Newport's Man of the Year. There's a party tomorrow night at the yacht club. Well, that ought to be interesting. - What do you mean? - Well, Sandy's being investigated. They're filing charges against Henry Griffin, and Sandy's working with him. I mean, Sandy's obviously very involved with the hospital... ...but I can't imagine him doing anything unethical. I mean, he can be self-righteous, pompous and annoying... ...but Sandy is very moral. Well, we'll find out. I'm sitting down with the district attorney tomorrow. - So we have to warn Sandy. - I already did. Then why doesn't Kirsten know? How you doing? Seven stitches, couple of broken ribs... I'll live. I'm glad. I didn't mean to... Well, not that bad, anyway. It's not like I didn't ask for it. So the money's returned, you got your stitches, and we're good, right? Not quite. I need some help. I'm supposed to pick something up. - No, no, no. - Just be my lookout. - Drive, wait in the car... - Whatever you're into, drugs... - It's none of your business. - I don't want it to be. Right. Because you got the good life now? Graduation, college... You know, all that changes when you're charged with assault. Tell the cops about me, I'll tell them about the money. Money. What money? - I don't see any money. - Nobody's gonna believe you. I don't care if they do. Because I got nothing to lose... ...and you got everything. That's why you're a little bitch. And that's why you're helping me out tomorrow night. No, I can't tomorrow night. Sandy's Man of the Year. It's a big party. Then I guess they'll be cuffing you in your suit. Look, Daddy, you can't do this to yourself every time you get the ratings. It's my dad. You know <i>The Valley?</i> It's his show. What do you expect when you've got the same love triangle for three years? - Who are you? - Oh, Marissa. Kaitlin's sister. Hey, bitch, your sister's here. Nice to meet you. I'm Hadley. Dad, I thought I told you to stay off the message boards. - Marissa, what are you doing here? - Waiting for you to explain this. Thanks for coming by, Kiks. I didn't wanna talk to you about this on the phone. No, of course. No problem. What's going on? Sit down. It's Sandy. He's being investigated by the DA. - Let me guess, the hospital. - Yeah. Neil is meeting with the DA. It seems serious. I'm so sorry, Kirsten. - I just thought you should know. - No, of course. With Sandy being Man of the Year, it'll be in all the papers. Speaking as someone who's managed more than her share of scandal... ...you need to contain this ASAP. Julie, I appreciate the heads up. Sandy's gonna take this really hard. Sandy knows. Neil told him at dinner last night. So your mom has the baby? The nanny. Growing up, stealing our brothers' empties to buy Sour Patch Kids... ...you didn't imagine me to have a nanny? - You've come a long way, is all. - So have you. Graduating on Monday, and Berkeley in the fall. So last night, after you left me with Taylor... Just don't, okay? Only one thing could've done that to your hand. Another guy's face. That kid stole the money... ...and you went to fight him. Go ahead. Answer it. Hey. No. No, no, I cannot right now, okay? Look, give me a couple hours at least. Should've told him you'd be there. Theresa, look, there's things that I can't tell the Cohens... ...or Seth because they wouldn't understand. But you? - My life has totally changed. - So has mine. No, there are guys that don't get into fights. Not ever, not any. Oh, like the guy at work? Look, I have a child to think about now. Okay? I cannot be with someone like my brother, or yours. - I'm not like him. - Maybe on your good days you're not. But right now, my life isn't built for the bad ones. I will always love you, Ryan. Keep safe. You walked into the kitchen and asked me to be optimistic. They can't have much of a case, not against Griffin and not against me. I'm hoping it'll go away. Maybe the Man of the Year thing will help. Well, it's not. Neil Roberts is meeting with the district attorney tomorrow. Well, I'll talk to Greg Hodes. He'll tell me what's going on. Honey, I promise you I'll do everything in my power... ...not to let this land on the family. It already has. His name is Trevor Knightley. He's the captain of the lacrosse team. Yeah, those girls are like his groupies. Lacrosstitutes. He's a total perv, and really into Adderall. So, what's he got against you? Or should I even ask? He gave me a personal invitation to a lipstick party, and I declined. Obvie. Lipstick parties are for pervs and skanks. So heinous. Lipstick parties and Adderall. I'm sensing a generation gap. Next he was telling the headmistress... ...he saw me taking the crest above her office. Well, it sounds like it's his word against yours. Oh, obvie. But he totally hides his evilness. Straight A's, varsity athlete. And Kaitlin's, well... - Not exactly the perfect student. - You don't say. Look, Marissa, this is my third strike, and I don't feel like getting kicked out. I know it may not be as bad as shooting somebody... ...but I'm pretty sure Mom would freak out. And I really don't feel like getting locked up during summer. Obvie. I get so horny in the summertime. Honey, you're always horny. - Shut up! - You shut up! Okay. Both of you shut up. - What's the deal with this crest? - I'm pretty sure it's in his room. But there's no way that he or his army of probably gay... ...and totally-in-Iove-with-him homeboys would let me in there. Well, I'm not usually one to come up with the plan... ...but do you have one of those skirts? - Hi. - Hey. This is Ryan. He's helping me. I'll leave the door unlocked when I finish work. It'll be inside. Thank you. - Good luck, man. - All right, man. That's the address. Need it for the pickup. - This is my neighborhood. - That's why you're driving. Mom, I'm gonna go get something to eat with Summer. Are you decent? If I come in, am I inviting years of therapy? Sorry. Mom? There you are. You... Oh, sorry. Cohen, is your mom sick or something? Yeah, she is. I'm gonna have to stay and take care of her. Oh. Okay, well, then why don't I just go pick us up food... ...and bring it back. Your mom need anything? Just peace and quiet. We're gonna have to rain-check dinner. - Oh. Cohen, you're acting really weird. - I feel weird. Maybe whatever my mom has is contagious... ...and I'd hate for you to catch it and feel weird too. You know? Okay. - Hi. Are you Trevor? - Yeah. I'm Marissa, the new foreign exchange student. - I just got here from London. - I love London. Well, I was hoping you could give me a tour, starting with your dorm room. Sounds good. But I did my junior year abroad at Oxford. I don't buy that phony English accent. - Fine. I'm a stripper for your birthday. - My birthday's not for six months. Do you wanna see me take my clothes off or not? Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Oh, you mean right now. Yeah. Well, you know, it's just kind of... Well, can it wait until after... ...because I'm on my way to a meeting with my group. Yeah, how's that going? Well, you know what they say. One day at a time. That's why you have meetings. Greg Hodes, my favorite DA. Now this is a cozy spot. Lighting's more flattering than an interrogation room. No one's being interrogated. Dr. Roberts and I are just gonna talk. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. The courtroom misses Sandy Cohen. Not as much as he misses the courtroom. Believe me. We've known each other a long time, Hodes. What am I dealing with here? The case against Griffin's not strong. Everyone's got stories, but not hard evidence. - And where do I fit in the picture? - You're in bed with him on that hospital. Until I have proof otherwise, his improprieties are yours too. Well, what if you had receipts, e-mails, an eyewitness? That would help a lot. For my cooperation, can you let the Newport Group finish the hospital? Griffin goes down, so does the hospital. No way around that. So I could keep my mouth shut and hope you lose... Or you could help bury that crook, say goodbye to the hospital. Dr. Roberts. Thanks for your time. I'm gonna leave you two to your discussion. - Good to see you, Neil. - Sandy. That's the house. Now we just gotta wait for him to leave. - You said we were picking something up. - Yeah, well. He doesn't exactly know it. - Ryan, is that you? - Hey. Just came from my tennis lesson and I thought, "Is that the Cohens' car?" - It is. - Well... ...save me a dance at Sandy's party. - Will do. And bring your friend. He's hot. Neighbor? Yeah. Told you this was a good plan. You said my dorm room. Don't want people to walk in, do you? - So take off your pants. - I thought you were gonna strip for me. Haven't you ever been to Vegas? Boxers, or I'll give those guys their money back. Now, that would be a waste. - They do this in Vegas too? - They do everything in Vegas. Okay. Now I just have to go change. But you're wearing a costume. Hey. Come back here. What do you think you're doing? - Did you get them? All right. - Yeah. Let's go. - Hey. - Hi, Mr. Cohen. - Is Seth around? - No. I don't think so. Is it okay if I just wait here for him? Sure, make yourself at home. Do you mind if I wait here with you? I'm working, but suit yourself. So how's Mrs. Cohen? She feeling any better? I didn't know she was sick. Must have been, like, a 24-hour thing. So, what's this? That is a card for Seth. Congratulating him on having a dad who is Man of the Year. Even though it's addressed to Kirsten and me. Okay, that is actually a really big mistake and I would do anything to take it back. "The most recent and troubling lies... ...include..." - Oh, Summer. - Seth gave it to me... ...on Valentine's Day when we got in a fight. He said if he ever screwed up again I should give it to you. - Only he didn't screw up again. I did. - This is serious. I did it out of spite. He told me he wasn't going to Brown. - And then I saw him there with Anna. - He said he wasn't going to Brown? Yeah, because he didn't get in, but that was before RISD. What do you mean, he didn't get in? I thought he only lied about that to me. The only thing worse than relapsing... ...is that my husband doesn't know. He's involved in this business deal, and... ...it's gotten very ugly, and... Well, he might even be arrested. And I'm not blaming anyone. I'm the only one with the power to drink or not drink. I just really need the man I married right now. I wanna talk to you. Good, I wanna talk to you. I love you. And I'm worried about you. - Right back at you. - You smoked pot in our home. You rather I do it somewhere else, like my college dorm? That would require you getting into college. Think it's a great idea, me going to college when Mom's drinking again? What are you talking about? If you paid attention to anything other than that hospital... ...you'd notice Mom's been passing out before dinner. Don't talk to your father like that. That would require you to act like my father. That's our guy. All right, go ahead. I'll be waiting. Come on, you're my cover. Besides, I can't go out with my face like this. What? You're just taking a little walk out in your neighborhood. All right, I'll just be a minute. You just wait right there. - All right, let's go. Where is it? - You're looking at it. The car? You gotta be kidding. - A hundred-and-twenty G's is no joke. - No way. I'm not doing that. Too late. Let's go. Let's go, let's go! - Supposed to be keys, I can't find them. - There's a patrol car up the street. I got this. Hurry up, man. They're coming, let's go. - Almost. - What are you doing? Shut up. - Let's go! Come on! - Get in. Don't be a little bitch. Better get that to the headmistress's office before someone sees it. Oh, yeah. We will. And thanks again. It was pretty cool. Way Kaitlin talked about you... ...I thought you'd be wasted and have all these problems. Right. Well, I'm glad you guys aren't gonna get in trouble. - I actually kind of had fun. - Wow. I suspected as much, but it's actually kind of nice to hear you say it out loud. I think we're having a moment. Oh, my God, my phone just totally stepped on your moment. I'll take it outside. Hey, bitch. You never called me back, what's up? Yeah, I liked hanging out too. It sucks that you're gonna go to college next year. We'll see about that. Oh, well, whatever you decide, I will miss you. - And I mean it this time. - Me too. I'm sorry I'm late. - I'll hurry. - Hey, have a seat. So... ...have you been drinking again? No explanation, no judgment. I just wanna know. - Oh, I wish you'd talked to me. - I tried. That night you called? - I wish I had known. - Then you would have come? The only thing that would get you to talk to me... ...was the threat of a relapse? - I hope you know that's not true. - I don't know that. Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. For everything. Especially the relapse. And more importantly, for keeping it secret. I'm sorry too. I know you know about my drinking. And I assume you know about Brown. Sorry to rat you out to Dad. It was a heat-of-the-moment thing. I'm glad you did. I know things have been difficult. But we're still a family. Yeah, a great family. Mom's drinking, Dad's about to go to jail. - Give the Atwoods a run for their money. - I haven't given up. Neither has your father. I'm not gonna apologize to that guy. I don't even wanna be in the same room. I'm asking you to. Attend his Man of the Year party? That's a hypocritical way to start the Cohen family clean slate. Will you do it for me? Fine. But I want my own table... ...and my applause for his speech will be so tepid. Thank you. Will you stop by the Newport Group? There's a concept drawing your father needs for his presentation. I'd ask Ryan but he said he'd be late. - I believe your father's gonna fix this. - That makes one of us. - Ryan. - Hey. - Where are you? - I'm driving back from Montecito. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Can you...? Can you meet me at your place? Yeah, sure. There's a key under the mat by the pool. Just let yourself in and wait in my room. - <i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i> - Thanks. - Hey, Ryan...? - It's okay, it's okay. Thanks. Neil, why aren't you ready for the party? - We should be leaving. - I'm not going, darling. I spent the afternoon with the DA. Griffin's about to be arrested and Sandy's future is far from certain. The more reason to be there for him and Kirsten. It's a conflict of interest. I might have to testify against the man. I'm sorry. But I'm sure they'll understand. Well, I don't. The Cohens are like family, Neil. They're about to become the black sheep. Well, I don't know about you, but I support the people I care about. I don't judge them. I'll call a cab. - Hello. - Hey. You have an ETA? Your father's about to take the stage. - I'll be right there. - <i>Did you find the drawing okay?</i> Okay, I'll see you soon. - I'm so happy for you. - He deserves it. You're sweet to say that. Thank you. Excuse me, can I borrow my husband a moment? Excuse me. Isn't that Greg Hodes? Oh, maybe he's here to arrest me. Wouldn't be the first time somebody left a Newport party in handcuffs. I'm gonna go practice my speech anyway. - Hey. What's going on? - I was with you tonight. If anyone asks, can you say that? - Ryan... - Just yes or no. - Will you do it? - Yeah, of course. - You changed your mind? - No, you changed it. You're a very passionate woman. And surprisingly principled. I'd like to think so. If you feel so strongly about family, how could I not wanna be part of yours? Good evening, everyone. And thank you so much for coming out tonight. And thanks to <i>Riviera</i> magazine for bestowing upon me this... ...this wonderful honor... ...that l... I cannot accept. I used to think I was better. I came from outside the bubble. Thought I was fit to judge it. When it came time to run the Newport Group... ...I wasn't worried at all about losing my way. But I learned that despite the wide streets and the sunny views... ...you take one wrong turn in this town, and you can end up totally lost. Thank you, Seth. Thank you, Kirsten. This drawing is as close to fully realized as Newport Mercy will ever be. Because I'm gonna be cooperating... ...with the District Attorney's investigation of Dr. Griffin... ...and the hospital he and I were going to build. - I'm sorry, Cohen. - No, it's okay. It's for the best. I'm truly flattered to be held in such high esteem by this community. But I'm gonna step aside... ...because I'm gonna pursue an honor that is closer to my heart. Father and husband of the year. Thank you. - That was quite a speech. - And you ought to have quite a case. I'll be in touch. You were wonderful. Thanks. I thought it was wordy, in the middle, but I think the end was nice. Yeah? Maybe I'm too late. They're here for me. Well, it's a good thing you were with me all night then, right? You're not asking him any questions without me. - Who are you, his lawyer? - I'm his father. - What happened? - There was a fire at the Newport Group.
