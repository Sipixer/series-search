-You' re leaving. Good luck with your new job, Carter. So long, Kirsten. -No one's ever been this nice to me. -You're Ryan's brother. No, it is more than that. Get off of me. Kirsten, did the paper come today? I can't find it. Yeah, I put it on the couch in the living room. Hey. Do you think I look at all like Tony Blair? -You have nicer hair. -Thank you. Good hair. Leader of Great Britain. I would call that a wash. -What you drinking? -Oh, tomato juice. Lots of antioxidants. So, what do you think of this? -Palm Springs. -Palm Springs? This weekend. You, me and the desert. Oh, Sandy, I know we talked about a weekend, but right now-- -You asked my opinion. -Yeah. -Morning. -But I wanted you to agree with me. -Morning. -Morning. -What's up? -Well... ...today's the first day back from spring break... ...and I was planning on telling Summer... ...about that little misunderstanding in Miami. You licked whipped cream off a girl's stomach... -...and ate a cherry out of her mouth. -Why would you tell her? Because I have a conscience. And it'll be on national television, so she'll find out. Look, I know the idea of telling her is scary... ...but believe me, when you start hiding things... -...that's when the trouble starts. -All right, let's go. We're late. Come on. Well, there goes the weekend. Unless we drive up Sunday morning, and I take Monday off. You're right. We need this. Well, I'll make the plans. -Hello? -Marissa, don't hang up, okay? -Look, I told you to stop calling me. -Let me exp-- I guess she didn't want to chat. What happened? Stable boy get fresh with the princess? Don't you have school? -I was hoping we could.... -I'll pass. You know, it's not many girls that would spend the night with a guy... ...and not only not mind him calling another girl the next morning... ...but still be up for round two. Sure you're not taking me for granted? Look, we both know what this is. Well, we know I'm not Marissa. I leave my marks on your back. Hey, Summer. Hey, Cohen. Okay... ...the easiest way for me to do this is just gonna be to say it... ...but before I do, I want you to know how totally, you know, awful-- -I know. -What? Miami, whipped cream girl. We do have cable. So you saw me? I saw you. Okay, so look. I know you're angry, and that's... -Not really. -...perfectly-- You're not? You know, I really thought things were gonna be different this time. But you haven't changed at all. You've found new and even more public ways of disappointing me. Zach and I kissed. -What? -Yeah. We were having dinner, and you came on TV in that stupid-- Okay, you know what? Fine. That's okay. You know, you'd seen me, and you kissed. Just a quick, cousinly-- What else happened? Nothing much. So, what does this mean? I don't know. It shouldn't be this hard. There you are. Just in time for your surprise. I'm late for work. You'll want to make time for this. Bon app√©tit. -What is that? -Eggs Benedict. My specialty. Well, my new specialty. It's my first time. I already ate breakfast. Well, consider this a midmorning snack. I was going to give it to you at 7, but it took a little longer than I expected. You spent hours making eggs Benedict for a man with a heart condition. Doesn't that seem a little insane to you? I am trying to make an effort here, Cal. If nothing else, I expect you to acknowledge that. I do. A wasted effort. -I have to go. -Why do I even try? I ask myself the same question. Hey. Sorry. You okay? Y eah. No, I guess I'm just not used to the hallway kiss yet. Oh, sure, of course. So tell me, how was Miami? It was a lot like Orange County. How about you? Anything crazy happen while I was gone? No. No, it was pretty much just business as usual. So we still have our date. How's your weekend? What, you got something? No, just my mom wanted to go shopping, but this weekend's great. Okay, great. So.... Well, let's do something special. Something you wanna do? No, nothing special. I mean, nothing in particular. It'll be special. So let's just talk about it later, okay? Yeah. Come in. -Oh, hey, Clare. What is it? -The men were cleaning Carter's office. They found this, saying it should be given to you. Oh, thank you. You can put it there. Hey, Summer, wait. -Hey, Zach. -I need to.... Here. -Did you talk to Seth? -Yeah. I told him everything. Okay, so, what does that mean about us? Zach, I can't do this right now. I need to know if what happened was just, like, a revenge thing... ...or if it was something more. Honestly, in the moment, mostly revenge. But also, I guess, something more. Well, well, well. If it isn't my old friend, the big fat traitor. -Hey, Seth. -Cohen. Relax, Summer, I won't make a scene. -How can you look in the mirror? -I need to tell you something. -You know what? Save your apology. -It's not an apology. -I'm quitting the comic. -What? -What? -It's caused too many problems. -It's not worth it. -The launch party is Saturday. Yeah, Zach, you can't. It means too much to you. Not as much as you do. I have to go. Oh, I see what you're doing. Let me tell you something. It's not gonna work, okay? She will see it for the cheap ploy that it is, eventually. Look, Seth, I've always liked you. But if I have to sacrifice our friendship to be with Summer, I'll do it. Amazing. This whole time I thought you were a nice guy. Wake up. I'm a water polo player. We're never nice guys. Looks like I won't have to add you to Atomic County. You're already there. The Demon Water Polo Player, the lronist's nemesis. It's gonna take more than quips and pop-culture-laden bromides... ...to win Little Miss Vixen. -So it's war. -It's war. -My locker's this way. -So is mine. Fine, stay on that side of the hall. What are you doing? Summer. Hey, I was-- I was waiting for you. Look, my car's completely out of gas, so would you give me a ride? Sure. Come on. The thing is, I left a book inside. Could you pick me up around back? Yeah. Whatever. Oh, Sandy, l-- I thought you'd gone. No, my first meeting's not till 1 0. I hope you don't mind, l-- I finished the tomato juice. But there's coffee. You know, I'm just gonna go. I'm a little late. Hey, I made a reservation at Korakia in Palm Springs. It's supposed to be, you know, really romantic. Oh, yeah, I checked my schedule. I don't think I can take Monday. Come on. It's just one day. I know, I'm sorry. Maybe in a couple of weeks. -But we'll talk about it tonight, okay? -All right. Hey. What? I don't get a kiss? Of course. Oh, is that new? Yeah. I got it at Featherbrook. I picked it up at the gift shop. Well, it suits you. Have a good day. -Hey. -Hey, Zach. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Well, let's just go over the details of the launch. Yeah, listen, Reed, I only came here today to let you know... ...I have to pull out of the comic. -Excuse me? -Personal reasons... ...which I'm sure Seth can fill you in on at a later date. But I wanted to tell you face to face. I'm sorry. Okay, I know you're young, and it's a comic book... ...and it's fun, fun, fun, but to us, this is a business. And you signed a contract. So unless you want a lawsuit for the next four years... ...I suggest you stay, you order a sandwich... ...and let's go over the details of the launch. You did this. Did you threaten to pull out too if she didn't force me back in? Zach, I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm glad you're back in, if that's what's going on. What's it gonna be, gorgeous? Am I calling my lawyers, or are you gonna order a crab sandwich? Crab sandwich. So, what's today's heart attack special, Julie? Deep-fried ribs? Steak tartare? That Super Size guy ought to spend some time with you. This came for you at the house. Listen, Cal... -...we need to talk to a counselor. -Excuse me? A counselor. A professional. Someone who can penetrate that fortress of solitude you've erected. Of all your ideas, that has got to be the worst. Well, then I'm out. You're not interested in my cooking. You're certainly not interested in my body. You said you wanted to try and make this marriage work. You may have a point. I have been letting you do all the work. I'm just not a counselor sort of guy. Sitting on a couch, talking about my needs. How about a date? T omorrow night, The Arches. I will try. We can make this work. Sandy? Hello? Your call has been forwarded to a voice messaging center. Please leave a message at the tone. Hi, Carter, it's-- It's me. I wanted to thank you for the necklace. It's beautiful, and.... I' m sorry. I shouldn't have called. Please don't call back. -Hey. -Hey. Jess. Marissa's pool? -Floater girl? -Oh, yeah. You're Ryan. Trey and I have been hanging out. You and Trey. Just what he needs, more trouble. You think I'm trouble? You might be even cuter than your brother. -Listen, I gotta.... -Oh, right, Marissa's waiting. Can't keep Marissa waiting. Think I could borrow a pen? -Thanks, Ryan. You're a sport. -Yeah. -Marissa. -What are you doing here? Look, just let me explain, okay? There's nothing I want to hear. -Just wait. -Let go of me. Marissa! Hi. Hey. -Hey, man. -Hey, Ry. -How you doing? -What are you doing? Just came to thank Marissa for the Bait Shop gig. It's really good. -What'd you do to your head? -Nothing. I just banged it on a cabinet. -What's up? You guys wanna grab a bite? -No. I have to get home. You know, my mom needs help. Yeah, I should probably get back to work. But I wanna hear about Miami. Definitely. -Hey. Everything all right? -Yeah. -Yeah, just my mom's usual insanity. -Gotcha. So tomorrow night is Seth's comic book thing. I figured we hit that then maybe grab dinner? -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah? -I mean, if you want. -No. Yeah, sure. And I promise, I'll be in a better mood by then. Let me get you another drink. -Honey, I'm home. -Before Tony comes, I-- Hey, I thought we'd go out tonight. I made a reservation at that fancy steak joint. You know, the one with the really heavy silverware. What do you say? Honey. Honey? Mark, I know you think it's silly... ...but when you get to know Tony, you 'll understand why. Darling, I understand now, but that doesn 't stop me from loving you. It's not as simple as that. Let's get you to bed. Come on. One, two.... Tony's changed. He 's a completely different person to the one I used to tell you about. Really? When did all this happen? That night I came to say goodbye. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. It's a beautiful morning. Come on. Look what I brought you. Oh, Sandy. Black coffee, bacon, those waffles you like so much... ...whipped butter, two fried eggs, fruit and OJ. I call it the Whaler. How can I resist? Thank you. You were out cold when I got home last night. Yeah, well, I was exhausted. Long week. Seemed like it was more than exhaustion. What do you mean? I'm worried about how much you're drinking. I-- I'm fine. I was exhausted. -I had a couple of drinks. So what? -I'm not just talking about last night. Have you been watching me? We do live together. Should I be concerned? I'm fine. Look, maybe I've been drinking more than usual... ...but, I'll-- I'll-- I'll cut down. Okay? So it's not something at work? Taking on too much? Is it that Carter left? -What? -He left very suddenly... ...so I figured maybe you had to do some of his work too. I'm fine. And I'd appreciate it if you'd trust me. I have to shower. -I'll put this in the microwave. -Don't bother. I'm not hungry. Is that the best you've got? Yeah, you like that? Now here's a little something your master Y oda never taught you. You just threw your light saber at me and killed me. I didn't know you could throw it. New game, who knew? Well, too bad Marissa's not here. The ladies can't resist a young Jedi. -Yeah, I don't know about that. -Why, you guys in a fight? I don't know. Ever since I got back from Miami... ...she's been acting nervous around me. Well, you could talk to Summer, except you cannot... ...because she's off-limits until phase two of Zach Attack is complete. But Trey was around last week, right? -Maybe he knows something. -Did you say phase two? Y eah, see, Zach being in the comic book does me no good unless Summer knows. And it ain't like he's gonna tell her. Hello. Hey, excellent. Is Guy Smiley still with her? Okay, stay-- No, no, Leon, you can't leave. I don't care if you got swim lessons. I'll be there in a minute. Please tell me you're not using the comic book club to spy on Summer and Zach. -Hey, Leon, they still in there? -They just paid. Is Zach really trying to destroy the comic book club? -What? Oh, yeah. Y eah, totally. -Seth, I need to get something to eat. -My blood sugar's all low-- -Okay. I'll be back. Stay there. Summer, Zach. Hey, what a surprise. Cohen. What are you doing here? Just filling up the tank. You know, got a big day. Got the launch party tonight. Hey, Reed wanted me to tell you we should get there a half-hour early tonight. Something about a Wizard magazine interview. Hey, Dementia Boy, Zach quit your stupid comic book, remember? Oh, did you not tell her yet? Did I put my foot in it again? -What's he talking about? -I was gonna tell you. I'm just gonna go. I'm sorry. Yo. Yo. Hey, man. Got you working, huh? Oh, yeah. Real slave-drivers. -What's up? -Nothing. Listen... ...I gotta ask you something. Marissa's been acting weird. She didn't happen to say anything when you guys were hanging out, did she? -Nope. I don't think so. -You sure? -You didn't notice anything? -I got a lot of work. No offense, but I don't want them to think I'm slacking. -Yeah, yeah. -But hey, man... -...we'll talk later, right? -Yeah. Well, well, if it isn't baby brother. -I just came by to see Trey. -Me too. But I could be talked out of it. Whatever's going on between you two... -...he needs to get his life back together. -Come on, it's not like we're serious. I mean, how could we be? He's completely obsessed with-- -Well, with someone else. -Fine. I'm not getting involved. Well, the fact is, Ryan... ...I've always had this fantasy about two brothers. I think that's gonna stay a fantasy. I get it. I used to think it was strange too. But apparently, I'm not the only one into the brother thing. I have a problem. Come on in and join the party. Okay, I have been shopping all afternoon, and-- What are you doing? I'm just erasing every vestige of Seth and Zach from my life. As far as I'm concerned, Reed can have them. What's up? Okay, I have this really important date with Ryan later... ...and I need it to be perfect. But I can't figure out what to wear. Please, you could dress as Grimace and stop traffic. Man, I look good in this picture. Okay, what do you think? Well, let me see. -What is that? -What? What? That. Coop. What were you doing, playing rugby? Yeah, well, I just slipped. -And fell on your collarbone? -Wait, so who's Reed? Oh, she's that busty comic book tart that turned Seth into an egomaniac... ...by agreeing to publish his graphic novel... ...and then threatened to sue Zach if he pulled out of the comic. Oh, my God. This is so her fault. -What? -Don't you see? Before she came, there was no scheming, no fighting... ...the comic book was deader than dead. Wait. Where are you going? Nobody messes with my men but me. Oh, it is ass-kicking time, Coop. Wear the black. He won't know what hit him. Julie. What are you doing here? I need to talk. Come to the kitchen. You want a drink? Isn't it a little bit early? What do you want to talk about? Well, your father. -It's not too early. -Good point. Okay. Here's the thing. Has he said anything to you about us? My dad doesn't exactly tell me about his romantic life. Yeah, I figured. It's just that I really, really want this marriage to work, Kiki. I mean, he says he does, but I don't know if he means it. I mean, he's-- Oh, my gosh. -What? -How much vodka did you put in this? A normal amount. -A little less. -Okay. -ls everything all right? Where's Sandy? -Out. -Did something happen? You two fight? -No. Yes. Oh, God, I don't know. Seems like we've been fighting since September. Kirsten... ...now, I know that I'm probably the last person you want to bare your soul to... ...but it's better than getting smashed in the middle of the day. -What happened? -What happened? The boys left for the summer, Sandy and I stopped communicating... ...Rebecca Bloom came along and made things worse. And then Carter. Well, he was cute. Something happened between me and Sandy. This wall came between us. And Carter just made me feel less alone... ...Iike Sandy used to. And now he's gone. Make sure Kid Chino's not blocking Cosmo Girl. All right. I have a question. Where's your cutout? Or have they not made Super Bitch yet? Is this about Seth and Zach? You and your comic have turned those two idiots into complete idiots. Graphic novel. And I'm trying to run a business. You have played one against the other. Manipulating Seth, threatening Zach so you'd end up with all the power. -Sorry you feel that way. -Well, you're gonna be. I'm going to tell them if either of them has anything to do with you... ...I'm never speaking to them again. Seth and Zach have talent. They could have careers in comics. But you're the Nico of the group. I'm sorry. I don't get references before 1 990. It's your picture people are gonna ask for. It's your face on the magazine covers. What do you want? A career in fashion? Movies? This is the perfect launching pad. Do you think I'll be able to control them once you have the limelight? It'll be your show. You're manipulating me. But I think I like what you're saying. I have some outfits I want to show you. Tell me about Super Bitch. -Think she could support her own comic? -No. Not so much. -Hey. -Hey. I was gonna pick you up. Oh, that's okay. I wanted to surprise you. Is this okay for a comic book launch? It'll do. So listen... ...you've been.... Is everything okay? Why don't you tell me? -No one's ever been this nice to me. -Yeah, because your Ryan 's brother. It's more than that. One night. No one needs to know. Get off of me. Nobody needs to know. Hey, hey. What's wrong? I' m sorry. I can't do this. I thought I could. It's been too long. T oo much has happened. -Okay. All right. Let's talk-- -I'm sorry. Where've you been? I was dropping your car off, you know, at the shop. It was making a weird noise. -I got you a rental. -Thanks. -We need to talk. -Why? Does the car need a lot of work? About us. Well... ...in that case, I'm gonna get some more water. Did something happen between you and Carter? -Don't do it like this. -Just tell me. -ls that what you really think? -ls it so crazy? You have a close relationship when we're going through a hard time. -When he leaves, you go on a bender. -Nothing happened. The same way nothing happened between you and Rebecca. -Why are you bringing that up again? -Again? Sandy, what do you think this is? What do you think Carter was about? -I want you to tell me. -You left me. Did you have an affair with him? You don't get it, do you? No. And then the Demonic Water Polo Player throws his plasma ball... ...at Kid Chino and the lronist... ...shouting, "Welcome to Atomic County, bitch. " Then the next panel here, Kid Chino catches it. Catches it-- -Thank you, Seth. That was wonderful. -I wasn't finished. You read for an hour and described every panel. You're finished. Right? That's right. Seth Cohen. -That's my water. -I'm thirsty. Yeah, because you went on about 45 minutes too long. Why don't you get a haircut, okay? We're sick of the Shaun Cassidy thing. Guys. As I was saying, on behalf of Bad Science... ...we'd like to thank you for coming to the launch. We have one final surprise. After getting your copy signed... ...you will get a photo with a member of Atomic County. I give you Little Miss Vixen. -Nice whip. -Yeah. -Mrs. Nichol, you look beautiful tonight. -Thank you. Is Mr. Nichol with you? No, he got held up at the office, so he asked me to meet him here. Typical. -Julie Cooper-Nichol? -Yes? This is for you. Please sign to show you've received them. -What is it? -I wouldn't know, ma'am. You're divorcing me? -Julie. -You son of a bitch. You have fun watching me trying to save this marriage while you met lawyers? -Did you enjoy it? -Don't be ridiculous. Okay. Fine. You want out, you got it. But let me tell you something. I am going to make you pay. Prenup or no prenup, I'll bleed you dry. You won't have a-- You'll have to explain these first. You had me followed? You have been monitored to one degree or another since before we were married. The affair you had with your former husband. The tryst last year with that high schooler, Luke. Oh, my God. I mean, your daughter's boyfriend. What will people think? Ex-boyfriend. Despite all of this, I was willing to give us a chance. Until that. -But nothing happened. This was just-- -Oh, stop it, Julie. I don't have the stomach for it anymore. I've gotten a hotel room. You have a week to find somewhere else to live. Then I want you and your daughter gone. Now get out of my office. Oh, by the way... ...you're fired. Thank you. Cohen, what are you doing? -Please, I need to talk to you. -Can't you see I'm working? Listen, I'm sorry about what happened in Miami, okay? I promise you, it will never happen again. Okay, you'll never go on TV and eat whipped cream off a naked girl again? -That's reassuring. -Look, Summer, I'm an ass, okay? I know that. And I know I don't deserve another shot. But I love you. And I think you love me too. Please. -I knew it. -Zach, not now, okay? -You were about to say something? -Don't listen to him. -I'm not gonna tell you again, buddy. -Or what? -Or you'll see. -Come on, you guys, don't. I'm sorry, I just-- Guys, guys, guys, stop. -You're pinching me. -You're biting me! -Watch my eye. -Stop-- -Stop pulling my hair. -You guys, stop it! Summer. Summer, I'm sorry. Hey, you all right? Is it bleeding? Can I see it? Everybody, the reading is over. Thank you for coming. -Let me explain. -Explain this. Stop it! God, what is wrong with you two? Seriously, what is wrong with you? Summer, look, you're just gonna have to choose, okay? -Once and for all. -He's right. -You have to choose. -Fine. You know what? I choose neither. -Hey-- -I don't want to hear it. Just clean it up. Now. Marissa, hey, it's me again. Listen, call me back, please. Tell me what's going on. Hey. -Everything okay? -Yeah, just-- Marissa and I got in a fight about-- I don't even know what. Must be the night. I've been trying to find Kirsten. -I thought she might've come home. -I haven't seen her. I'm gonna go back. If she comes back-- -Yeah, yeah, actually, I was gonna-- -Oh, right, of course, go see Marissa. Hey, you sure it's okay neither of us are going to Seth's comic book launch? If I find Kirsten, I'll get over there before it's over. -Yeah. Good luck. -Right back at you. -How did you get in here? -The back door was open. -Look. I just want to talk. -Get out. Look, I'm sorry, Marissa. Okay, I was out of my mind. And that's an excuse? Look, I didn't plan it, okay? It just happened. I don't want to hear it. Look, I just-- I just want things to go back like they were. -I never meant to hurt you. -Me? Me? What about Ryan? I mean, he's your brother. He loves you. -He would do anything for you. -Look, I said-- I said I'm sorry. And so what? You know, you don't even deserve him as a brother. You don't want to accept my apology, that's fine. But I want you to promise me you will not say anything to him. Get out. Get out before I call the police. You wouldn't. Try me. Hey, where are you? -I'm sorry. -Oh, honey, it was my fault. You were trying to tell me something, and I wasn't listening. Tell me where you are and I'll pick you up. I'm coming home. I thought I was losing you. That's never gonna happen. -I love you.
