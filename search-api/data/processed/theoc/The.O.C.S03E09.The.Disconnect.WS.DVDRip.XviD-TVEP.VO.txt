- I don't need your charity. - Then why are you living in a trailer? I don't wanna go to Berkeley. I wanna go to Brown. What if he goes to college and meets a bunch of really smart girls... ...and realizes that that's who he's supposed to be with? - What are you doing? - Let me explain. You called people in on a Sunday to fire them. He likes you. And sooner or later you're gonna have to deal with it. Maybe you just don't understand what she's going through. - You two talk. I'm done. - Ryan. I feel responsible. I'm gonna get the operation... ...and get back on my board. You guys, seriously, thank you. - Sure, we're happy to help. - Not a problem. I'm along for the ride, but you're welcome. You didn't have to do this. Come on, yeah, we did. I mean, Chili's out of town, your mom's at work. We weren't gonna let you take the bus. Taking a bus never seems to end well here. - It's this one, up on the right. - The one with the white trim? No, it's the one next to it. - The infinity pool's in the back. - Don't worry about it. - You should see where Ryan grew up. - We're moving soon. After I go pro, a year on the circuit, save money... ...buy my mom a house in the Flower Streets. - Seems a little optimistic now, but... - No. - Well, thanks again. - Yeah. - See you. - Here, let me help you. No, I'm... I'm fine. Y'all are gonna be late for school. - Don't forget. - Oh, thanks. Later. Yeah. Okay, definitely not fine. - I can't watch this. - I have a free period right now. - Yeah, stay. Help him get settled. - You think? I'll see you tonight. We'll catch up, get something to eat. No, no, it's fine. Don't speak. The kid has no one. And I trust Marissa. So I was thinking our new business... ...could provide something that's missing in Newport. - But we've got everything. - Not a great bookstore. Latest fiction, authors giving readings. Interesting, but I was thinking that our business... ...could provide something that Newport actually wants. - Okay, Julie. What's your idea? - Okay. I was reading in <i>Stuff</i> magazine, you can get a girl to clean your house... They're called housekeepers, and Newport is definitely on to that trend. Not housekeepers. Nude maids. Who wants to see their maids nude? - Not maids, Kirsten. They're strippers. - Who wants a stripper doing their laundry? As long as she knows how to iron the way I like: Wrinkle-free, and not too starchy. Sandy gets it. A few weeks at the Newport Group... ...he's thinking like a businessman. You've gotta give the people what they want. I'm trying to give people without a lot of money a place to live. Matt set up a big meeting with potential investors. Sandy, I don't think I'm in favor of low-income housing. Julie, you live in a trailer park. And I am highly motivated to change my circumstances. If you make being poor too comfortable, what's the incentive to get rich? Believe me, if anyone should know... Wow, on that uplifting note... ...I'll leave you two to hash out the finer points of the free-market economy. Look, why don't we do something that we know Newport needs... ...and we're already good at. - I'm blanking. - Party planning. I'll cater. Charity events, private dinners... We know all the vendors, all the sites, already have a huge client base. I'm in. Marissa called? We just dropped her off. Why would she call? She's busy. - Hey... - Hey, can't talk. I have to go see Dr. Kim. - You in trouble? - No, I have to change my college file. I got my SAT score. Summer, we got our SAT scores back months ago. Oh, well, I took mine late, remember? There was a <i>Valley</i> marathon the first time. - How'd you do? - Ryan, come on. You never ask a lady her age, weight or SAT score. I got a 2300. What, that bad? - That good. - As good as you, Cohen? - Better. - By just the tiniest bit. You know, I read a study once that said that if 1500 third-graders took the SAT... ...one would get a perfect score by probability alone. Yeah. Well, I'm not a third-grader, Cohen. I'm not saying you are, but how else do you explain it? I don't know. How is that even possible? She did save Chrismukkah. Okay, so you've got your blanket... ...pillows. What else? The remote... ...magazines... - Just call me if you need anything, okay? - Don't wait by the phone. - Since you've thought of everything. - Maybe I should stop by after school. - Give you your homework. - Oh, I'll get it later. Is everything okay? If I didn't know better... ...I'd think you were trying to get rid of me. - Whatever you could do would help. - Ma, hey. Please, call me right away if anything changes. Thanks again. - Baby, how you feeling? - Ma, this is... - The famous Marissa Cooper. - Hi. Come here, sweetie. Oh, Johnny talks about you so much... ...I feel like I know you already. You didn't tell me she was gorgeous. - Ma, you're embarrassing her. - Sorry. Thank you for bringing him home. I tried to get someone to cover for me, but no one wants the night shift. Marissa has class. You're gonna make her late. Well, just wait, I've got some good news. I got you an appointment. With the best sports-medicine doctor in all of Orange County. A real fancy orthopedic surgeon. Works with the Angels and the Ducks. - Thanks, Ma. - One hitch. Being that he's in demand, there's a wait list. And the wait's gonna be a little while. - What, like a week? - Seemed kind of more like months. But the team will be gone. I'll miss the tour. I know, honey. But there's always next year. Maybe there's a way to get moved up. No, no, I tried. But, you know, they give these favors to friends... ...and donors to the hospital. Babe. I'm sorry, l... I did the best I could. - Hi. - Hey. You are not gonna believe this. So it turns out that I am totally smart. Yeah, you are, in your own way. Not in my own way. In your way too. - I have a lot of what they call "aptitude." - Really? Dr. Kim told me that every few years she has a student... ...that turns out to be academically gifted but didn't apply herself. You know, just focusing more on boys and shopping and celebrity gossip? If I study for my finals... ...I could get my grades up enough to go to Brown with you. Wouldn't that be awesome? Yeah, sure. But, you know, do you even...? Do you wanna go to Brown? Well, now I do. Dr. Kim said that you can make your own major. And the school colors are seal brown. How cute are seals? Look, they're having this thing tomorrow for prospective students. And I thought we could go together. Okay, yeah. That sounds like a date. Okay. What are you reading? It's just <i>Fear and Trembling.</i> It's Kierkegaard. He's the godfather of Existentialism. Sort of invented the concept of angst. Well, now that I'm smart, I'm sure I'll enjoy it. All right, I'll do the welcome, explain our philosophy, present the model. - I'll follow up with the numbers. - What about Thai for dinner? Sounds great. Happy days are here again. You two are so perfect together, it's almost painful to be around. We've been working on it for about 25 years. You're bound to get it right eventually. What about you? There's a girlfriend in Chicago. Yeah, yeah. She's a great girl. I look forward to meeting her. Here's a couple of guys who know a thing or two about romance. - Seth, Ryan, meet Matt Ramsey. - Hey. - Matt, meet my boys. - Hey there. Matt and I are working on our housing development. Oh, that's my cue to help Mom with dinner. - This is it, huh? - Yeah. It's an early version, but pretty much. You guys probably don't want my two cents, but... What? No, no, no, go ahead. You put a wall up here, it turns this space into a courtyard. Add some benches, a playground. - Good idea. - It was just a thought. - You're a senior? Applying to college? - Yeah. What would look better than an internship with a prestigious development company? - lf it's cool with the boss. - We could use the help. - You got any plans? - Yeah, with my girlfriend. Cancel them. Well, this is the doctor's home page. And it says here he works out of Hoag Hospital. My mom's done a bunch of charities for them... ...and Summer's dad even works there, so this is kind of perfect. Marissa, I appreciate everything... ...but you can't do this. Why? Because I might one day decide to become a surfer... ...get hit by a bus, need surgery... ...then realize I used my one good favor with the best doctor in town? Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen. I just don't want you to think this is your problem. Too late. Hang on, Summer's picking me up. Sorry. - Hey. - Hey, you ready to go? Oh, hang on. Oh, it's Ryan. We're supposed to have dinner tonight. I should... - Hey. - Hi. - You have to help me. - Well, I thought Marissa was helping you. She is. She's driving me, feeding me, bringing me my homework. She's trying to get me in... ...with some doctor. - That's okay. She's a good friend, I don't see the problem. She's too nice, spending too much time with me. Well, she tends to be a little clingy. - No, it's not that I don't like it. - We'll get together later. It's that I do. - A lot. - I called this, like, so long ago. This... This is a major problem. Not for anybody but me, okay? Just don't tell anyone. - All right, bye. - Promise? - Yeah. - Hey. What'd I miss? Thanks for dropping me, Sum. Hey, you think maybe you could pick me up too? Oh, maybe you should ask Ryan. I think he's gotta go to the Newport Group. Oh, I guess I could swing by Union. Oh, can you pick me up at Johnny's? Because I'm gonna drop off his homework and hopefully I'll know about the doctor. Hey, you think maybe you could ask your dad to put in a good word? Yeah, I guess. Are you sure... ...I don't know, that that's the best idea? You being all involved in Johnny's life? You guys are getting really close. Yeah, well, he doesn't really have anyone else. I mean, his mom's sweet, but it just seems... ...like everything's kind of hard for her. - I'm just trying to help. - Okay. I'll talk to my dad. The sooner Johnny gets on his feet, you don't have to be his nursemaid. I kind of like being his nursemaid. You know, maybe I should be a nurse. - That is a good one. - <i>So was Marissa cool...</i> ...with you canceling last night? - Didn't have a problem. - Do you have a problem with it? - Why would I...? I cancelled. If you cancelled on me, I'd have a problem. If I cancelled on you and you didn't have a problem with it, then I might. Sounds like you already got a problem. And not with me. - Who would my problem be with? - I think it's great that Summer's a genius. Listen, Dr. Kim said she had some untapped potential. No one went around using the G-word. - Don't do this, man. - Do what? - Compete with Summer. - Why? Because... Do you think Summer would win? So I figured out what our start-up costs will be. Do you wanna share an appetizer? Crab cakes? Sounds good. We can charge food and liquor on a per-event basis. But dishes and linen we have to figure out whether it's worth buying our own. You know what I'm craving? Sweet-corn ravioli. Do you think that'll be heavy with the crab cakes? What I think is that you don't find this business interesting. Oh, I'm sorry. Kiki, I've just been eating a lot of ramen lately. Julie, if this business works, you'll never have to boil your dinner again. I had a supplier list. I left it in the car. - I'll be right back. - I'll decide on my order while you're gone. Or read some spreadsheets. Right here. So I see you're suddenly without a lunch date. - Wanna join me at the bar for a drink? - No, my friend will be back shortly. Well, maybe I can buy you both drinks. Well, she's an alcoholic, and we're having a business lunch. We're partners. In a business. Really? What kind of business? Well... - Hey, Julie. - Kirsten. Oh, this is Jeff Granzow. This is my business partner, Kirsten Cohen. Nice to meet you. We were in the middle of something, if you'll excuse us. Actually, I invited Jeff to join us for lunch. He just hired us to do a dinner party at his house this weekend. For $5000. Oh, well, have a seat. Do you like crab cakes? Hey, Ashley, Madison. - Summer, hey. - Didn't expect to see you here... ...at a Brown event. No offense. - Oh, none taken. You know, maybe we should just leave. Why? Well, you know... You don't think I belong here. No, it's not that. You know, you don't have to do this for me. Oh, this isn't about you. It isn't? Because this has been my dream for years... ...and, I mean, all of a sudden, it's yours too? Well, maybe I never had a dream. You know, maybe for once in my life... ...I actually wanna do something with my life. Like something important. Be the first woman in space... ...or win one of those noble prizes. Women have been going to space since the '60s. And it's not noble prizes, it's Nobel. Marie Curie won in 1903 for discovering radium. - I think you've made your point. - Hey, don't leave. Oh, I'm not leaving. Look, you may know more about history and science and stuff... ...but I know a thing or two about working a room. Hey, Madison. Wait up. You all right? Yeah. I just got a lot on my mind. I promised it wouldn't interfere with my work. This job means a lot to you, huh? Kind of means everything. I relocated to do this with Sandy. And my girlfriend... Well, my ex now, I guess. I took her down to Cabo last weekend and invited her to join me here... ...as my wife. It turns out she doesn't like warm weather. Or me. - Have you told Sandy this? - It's not his problem. Sandy's a good guy. And he's taking a big chance on me. - I don't wanna let him down. - Tell me about it. Guys, I hate to do this to you, but my plate's full. Whatever it is, put it right out of your mind. It's already done. There's legislation in the works that would change the zoning. I need you to work out both scenarios: One if it passes, one if it doesn't. That means twice the work. - Maybe you could reschedule the meeting? - I would if I could. These guys are coming tomorrow, and then heading down to San Diego... ...to look at another development. Fourteen hours, laptop, coffee. Ryan and I are good to go. That's the spirit. Thanks. We gonna have time to get ready? If not, we should tell him. Come on. We'll take a little field trip. You guys, next year is gonna be so much fun. Maybe we should drive together, like, have a road trip? - Shotgun. - Excuse me. If I could have your attention. I wanna thank you for coming. Great group. - So true. - But, unfortunately... ...on average, Brown admits one student a year from Harbor. And it's stiff competition. I wish I could admit you all. But enjoy the event. And good luck. Thank you. - Hey, can I talk to you? - I need to talk to the Brown guy. Hey, hi. I was wondering, in your opinion, what makes a student stand out? - Yes, besides good grades. - And high SAT scores. Well, all our applicants are leaders at their schools. What it really takes is a hook. Fascinating. Okay, okay. And could you clarify with an example? Say the cellist in our quartet was graduating and you played the cello... Next week? That is great news. I can't believe it. It's really not that big a deal. Summer's dad is a surgeon at the hospital, and they knew each other. I'm glad it worked out, though. This calls for some kind of celebration. Marissa, you're staying for dinner. Ma, I'm sure she has plans. Oh, I do, actually, with Ryan. - That's her boyfriend. - Well, invite him too. We'Il... We'll order in. We'll play board games or watch movies. - That's him. - Probably wondering where you are. No, he knows. Hey. So do you wanna come over to Johnny's and get takeout and DVDs? - We're gonna celebrate. - Yeah. Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Probably start without me, though. Be there as soon as I can. - What's up? - Hey. - It's cool. He's with me. - Sure thing, boss. Hey, what are you doing, man? - I thought we were on a coffee run. - Well, I never said that. I do some of my best thinking here. I can see why. Loud music, topless women. - No distractions at all. - Sometimes a good distraction... ...is the best way to recharge. All right? - Here's my muse, Lily. - Hey, Matt. How's my favorite customer doing? I'm in need of some serious one-on-one time. Should I ready the champagne room for you? - Hey, come on, man. - I got this, all right? I'm gonna have a time-out, then we'll go pull an all nighter. I got plans. I can't... First dance is on me. I'll be right back. Hi, I'm Sipowicz. Hi, Sipowicz. I didn't know Julie was taking this seriously. Well, you gotta hand it to her. She's a born entrepreneur. Hey, I'm starving, and that actually smells good. Well, it's not for you. Pizza's coming. Is that a pirate costume? - Summer and I are in a war. - A pirate war? It turns out Brown takes only one student from Harbor. - We both wanna be it, so I need a hook. - Oh, you mean like a Captain Hook. I'll get that. Maybe it's dinner. Summer going to Brown? - I mean, no offense... - She did save Chrismukkah. Is Ryan eating with us? He's working with Matt tonight. He's a good influence on Ryan. He's young, he didn't come from much, he's making something of himself. He's a good role model. - You don't have to do this. - Bought and paid for. Oh, that's my cell. Ringing in my pocket. I definitely feel something vibrating. - Yeah, if you could just... - No, let me. It's Ryan. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. I was just wondering where you are, so... It's getting kind of late. So call me. I'll scrimp and I'll save and I'll work my fingers to the bone. Oh, there's just one thing. - What about...? - Children? Oh, yes. I don 't know what to do when they cry. Do you, dear? Drown them like puppies. As you see, the nursery's far away from the rest of the house. And if you have children, you'll find that this is a wonderful arrangement. They can carry on, and you'll never even notice. - Sunken nursery. - In fact, if you lock them in... ... you'll never have to see them again. - Much less talk to them. - Talk to them? Heavens. - Nobody talks to children. - No, they just tell them... Where have you been? - Summer... - I have been worried sick for hours. Since my alarm went off 20 minutes ago and I noticed you weren't here. Sorry, I fell asleep. Oh, at Ryan's? At Johnny's. - At Johnny's? - We were watching a movie. What's that? - A tuba. - Which you have why? Because I do. In fifth grade, when I said I was going to beauty-pageant camp... ...I was going to band camp and learning to play the tuba. Quit changing the subject. I cannot believe you slept there. - Does Ryan know? - Know what? How bad that movie was last night. Where were you? Yeah. Where were you? None of my business. - I was with Matt. We were working. - Wow, so late? Yeah, big presentation today. So movie no good, huh? Yeah, well, it kind of put me to sleep. - How's Johnny? - Better, I think. Good, good. You get home okay? Yeah. Yeah, his mom drove me. - I just wanted to say hi. - Yeah, don't let me keep you. Okay. The investors are in the conference room, I need your part of the presentation. Call me when you get this. Matt's missing in action. Any idea where he could be? He was pulling an all nighter. Maybe he slept in. - Right through the alarm. Sorry, Sandy. - Ready? As I'll ever be. Let me put my tie on, clear my head. - Five minutes? - You got four. And you might wanna run a comb through your hair. - Thanks for not busting me. - Gonna make me wish I did? I know these guys. I got it under control. - Summer? - Oh, hey, Ash. - You're not in the band. - No, technically not. I thought I could play, blow minds, get asked to join. What do you...? I'm a big fan of physical comedy, and I'm extremely limber. Plus, Johnny Depp has been a huge inspiration in my life. I just think he's taken the pirate thing to a whole new level. - And the Brown Bear is retiring next year. - I told you. We already have a mascot. Oh, my God. - And what's with the peg leg? - What? It's really creeping me out. Cohen! Cohen, what are you doing? - Summer, what are you doing? - I asked first. You don't need to answer that, because it's obvious. Yeah, I'm not the one wearing a tuba. That's really big talk from a guy wearing hoop earrings. At least I play the tuba. What? I do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to practice. - Did you just whack me? - Did you just jab me with your peg leg? - It was a tap, you little whacker. - It was a jab, jabber. Why do you have to be better than me at everything? See? That's just it, Summer. I'm not better than you at everything. There was one thing that I was better at. The commercial space at street level can provide jobs... ...places to eat, a daycare center... - It sounds good. But we've heard there are regulations in the works which... ...could complicate things. - So have we. Matt's worked out both sets of numbers. Matt. Thanks, Sandy. So if the legislation does not pass... ...the profit model will look like this. - And if it does? Then we would have to decrease the amount of commercial space... ...which would decrease the revenue. - By how much, do you think? - I would say a significant amount. Matt, we do business in dollars. How many are we talking about here? - I'm... - Well... ...we haven't worked out those numbers right now. We didn't drive all the way down here for a hypothetical conversation. Of course. We'll have those numbers to you by this afternoon. Right, Matt? Thank you, Mr. Cohen... ...for your impressive presentation. I think we've heard all we need to today. Well, thanks for your time. I can't believe this. I'm sorry. I... Anything you'd care to tell me? Coming. Johnny? In here! Oh, my God. Oh, God. All right, come on. - Here. - I think I twisted it again. Okay. Come on, now. Where are your painkillers? - Hello. Good evening. - Good evening. Oh, Jeff, what a beautiful... ...beautiful place. - Thank you. Would you and your guests want dinner in the dining room, or...? Oh, the terrace would be nice. Let me ask my guest. Dining room or terrace? Excuse me? I haven't invited anyone. I was hoping, Julie, that you might join me for dinner. Mr. Granzow, if this is a joke, it's not funny. I spent two days cooking, and Julie bought out the flower mart. One dinner, please. I'll pay what I promised. I just want the chance to get to know you better. Julie, we're leaving. Julie? You did all this for a date with me? Fine, but you're serving yourselves. - Hungry? - Nope. What the hell happened? - I'm so sorry... - You weren't prepared for the meeting... ...I could overlook. That you were here, you brought Ryan... ...really tries my patience. - But I'd hear you out. - Thanks. - That means a lot. - But you lied to my face. You disrespected me, and the company I'm trying to build. - The one that you wanted to build. - It won't happen again. You're right, it won't. I want you out of the office tomorrow. You're fired. - Come on... - Not another word out of you. Don't think you don't have anything to be sorry about. Hey, Johnny, do you know where there's a towel? I don't want this ice to melt all over you. Try under the sink. You know, Marissa... ...you're really making this hard. - Making what hard? We're friends. Yeah, we are friends. How many of those painkillers did you take? I have to tell you something. - I can't say it. - Say what? Don't say anything back, okay? I don't want anything. I just want you to know the truth. The truth about what? I really like you. Okay, I really like you too. No. I mean... ...I "like you" like you. I think I'm in love with you. So, Ryan, you're a working man now. How's the job going? Model homes, calculators, dudes in suits. I bet that's some pretty exciting stuff. You'd be surprised, and so would Marissa. - What's she up to? - I don't know. I'll ask her when I see her, which will be tonight. - What's with the questions? - I'm trying to exhaust your issues... ...so we can get to mine. Have we covered everything? My biggest fear, stated plainly: What if Summer's being smart changes our whole dynamic? - Why would it? - Because my intelligence... ...was the one quality she admired in me. It made me almost a man in her eyes. Come on, man, that's not true. You got plenty of other positive qualities. You're... You're... You're funny when you wanna be. Have you noticed how Summer's gotten funnier lately? - I think she's funnier than me. - You're an expert in comic books... ...and yakuza films. - Girls don't like that. - You know how to work a grill. I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. I thought I would come up with more... ...but the point is, Summer doesn't wanna be you... ...she wants to be with you. Right? You want that too. So... - Apologize, I know. - Yeah. - Where you going? - I gotta go to Sandy's office. I have some apologizing to do myself. Give me a ride? Why don't we have cars? Don't answer it. Johnny's gonna think I'm mad at him. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. Look, he was in pain. He took a bunch of pills. And he probably doesn't even remember. It's not a big deal. Yeah, well, a Vicodin love confession is still a love confession. I'm sure he didn't mean it. I'm sure he did. Why? Because he told me... ...the night that I picked you up from his place. Why didn't you say anything? He made me promise not to. He said he wasn't gonna do anything, so he didn't want you to know. And now I know. What am I gonna do? Pretend you don't. Maybe you should just stay away from him for a while. I gotta call Ryan. Are you gonna tell him? These guys won't return my calls. I can't get even a response... ...much less schedule another meeting. - Look, I am sorry. - Matt said he had it and I believed him. - Well, so did I. It makes no sense for him to blow this off. - He's the one who set up the meeting. - His girlfriend dumped him. - Oh, because he went to the strip club? - Because he took the job. - It hit him pretty hard. - You're breaking my heart. He didn't want anyone to know. Especially his boss. Sorry for the drop-by. Wow, Matt must be some tipper. Matt and I are friends. From college. Yes, I went to college. I'm dancing to pay for law school. But I don't dance for Matt. Mostly, we talk. - About what? - Matt's been under a lot of pressure... ...and not just work stuff. I think he just kind of crashed and burned. - He couldn't have chosen a worse time. - I know. Maybe none of this makes any difference, but Matt is a good guy. And this job means the world to him. What if I told you I was the one that put Matt in touch with those investors... ...and that I could get you another meeting? - Is one your professor? - No, a customer. Dad, Gloria, I'm heading over to Seth's. - Hi, Seth. - Hey. I just came over to apologize. Me too. Well, no. I'm... I'm listening. Okay. Look, I'm sorry I've been such an ass, okay? It's just, you're so superior to me in so many ways. You know, you're better-Iooking, you're more popular... ...you're stronger. And not just emotionally. Cohen... ...I'll always look up to you. And not just because you're taller than me. I am taller than you. You know, that guy from Brown... ...he didn't say that they couldn't take more than one from Harbor. - Hey, well, this might be the year. - That's right. Don't try and make me feel worse than I already do. It's impossible. You knew you didn't do the work. You knew you'd get caught. You knew how I'd react. - You must've wanted to get fired. - Right. Since I'd have absolutely nothing else going for me. The next time you have a problem, say something. If you need help... ...ask for it. I'll remember that. Be here at 8 a.m. on Monday. We'll give it another try. - You'd do that? - Yeah. This is your last chance, don't screw it up... ...or you owe me bigtime. Oh, hey, Julie. - How was your date? - Oh, it was awful. We didn't click, we had nothing to talk about... ...and his tongue was like sandpaper. Sorry to hear that. Sorry. I should never have stayed. It was so unprofessional of me, and you made all that food for nothing. Well, it wasn't for nothing. We got paid. In a way, our first venture was... ...a success. - Yeah, I guess so. How weird is it that a guy would spend that much... ...just to have dinner with a woman? Julie, I have an idea for a new business. Oh, my God! High-class call-girl operation. I love it! No, a high-end dating service. That could work too. Hey, Johnny. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, you're on your way out. I won't be long, I... You must think I'm a stalker just showing up like this. - All my calls went to voice mail, so l... - Johnny, look. You don't have to explain yourself. We can just act like it didn't happen. Those pills will really mess with your head. Believe me, I should know. Look, Marissa... I didn't mean to say those things. But I did mean them. - I just don't want things to get weird. - I think things already are a little weird. - Well, we can still be friends, right? - Of course. I just...
