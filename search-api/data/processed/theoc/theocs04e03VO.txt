He hasn't spoken to us in days. Well, us he can ignore. When Ryan doesn't speak to Seth, that's when I start to worry. It's like he's turning into an island. Yeah, right in the path of Hurricane Julie. Ever since we got back from Mexico, things haven't been the same. Tell me about it. I've been banned from your house. Your parents have been mad at me before. It's never been this bad. We're excluding her from Thanksgiving. Well, when you send our kids on a murder mission, you get knocked off the guest list. House rules. Hey, Summer, just calling to say happy Thanksgiving. Well, I use the term "happy" loosely. It's actually shaping up to be kind of an awkward Thanksgiving, filled with silent pauses and lack of eye contact. Ryan has taken the nonverbal thing to a whole new level. There have been times, say, after he's told me not to tell someone something, and I did, or when I came up with a stupid plan and we got caught, and/or had to be saved Thing is, Ryan and I have never been in a fight before, but I got a feeling things will blow over today. 'Cause... they have to. It's Thanksgiving. It's Thanksgiving. You just watch. This family's going to come together for the holidays. That's what we Cohens do. Hey. Coffee? Sure. Should be ready any second. Oh, I hate to miss this spirited discussion, but I got to take this. Hello. Uh-huh. Where are you? Okay, enough of this. No more tip-toeing, no more silences. It is Thanksgiving and this family is going to get over what happened and move on with their lives. I don't know if it's that easy. No one said it was going to be easy, but this family is going to work together and make Thanksgiving dinner. You two, grocery store, together. I've got to pick up Summer. You can go before. List, here. And when you get back, we're gonna cook this bird together. Including you-- no surfing, no golf. You got it. I do have to go to the office. Sandy. But I'll only be gone a few hours, and when I'm back I'm all yours. Great. Now you can all change and wash up, but you report for duty in one hour. Ryan, are you going to be okay? 'Cause if you can't put your anger about Volchok aside, even for today, then there's no point to any of this. No, I'm not angry, I... I just wish he was dead, that's all. It's me. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Capture:QQ sync:FRM@¹Ûº£ÎÀ</font> Thanks for coming. To be honest with you, I didn't know where else to go. Hitched a ride into town. Slept on the beach last night. I'm not your friend. I'm your lawyer, and I'll help you get through this, but the less you talk, the better, all right? I brought you a bagel. A bagel? I asked for an egg-white omelet and some cantaloupe. Taylor, I said you could hide out in my room for a couple days. I did not say there will be room service. Seth, one day when I'm no longer sleeping under your bed, you're going to miss me. And when will that be? 'Cause you kind of made it sound like this was a temporary thing. I know, I know. You think it would healthier for me to confront my fear and face my mom. More like Summer's coming home, and I was hoping we could get it on up here. You understand. Right, of course. You guys need alone time together. I mean, like you said, your relationship is just hanging by a thread. I didn't say that. Really? You didn't? Oh. I must have dreamt it. You know, since I've been on the run, my dreams have been so vivid. Like last night, I dreamed that Gerard Depardieu and I were teammates on <i>The Amazing Race.</i> Wait, back up. Is this about your trip to Brown last week? Did something happen with Summer? No, of course not. No, she's still the same old Summer. She may not smell like the same old Summer, but inside she's... she's still the same girl. I wouldn't know. I feel like we've barely spoken in weeks. Seth, you guys are gonna be fine. Just think, she's on her way here right now. I don't think I'm coming. Listen, I've been looking forward to seeing you. I just got back from Seattle and I've got a lot to tell you. Well, tell me now. No, I want you hear. It's Thanksgiving. Exactly. Millions of turkey. being senselessly slaughtered so us Americans can get even fatter? I like turkey. I know you do. I just, I don't think I can support this holiday, you know? I think I'm just gonna sit this one out. Okay, you want to tell me what's really going on? Uh, I don't know. I'm just not up for it. Is that a dog? Hold on a second. Kaitlin, what is, what is that thing doing in my house? Well, nothing now. Although a few minutes ago she kind of took a tinkle in your den. I want you to get that thing out of here. I want you to take it back wherever you got it. Dude, I found her at the pier, and I'm not taking her back. She totally fits in my purse. Dude, does your mother know that you have this thing? Well, yesterday she almost sucked her up in a vacuum. I guess, to her, the dog is invisible, like me. Oh, by the way, I think your Roberto's are cashed. You're sorry? This was a $700 pair of shoes. Oh, I forgot to ask you. How'd your conference go? Thought so. Sorry about that, sweetheart. It's all right. Dad, it sounds like you're in the loony bin. Sometimes I think I am. You need me there, don't you? Desperately. All right, see you in six hours. I love you. You, too. Bye. Crap! I know it's Thanksgiving, but you're a private investigator. Julie. Can't you find a guy and eat turkey at the same time? Call me back in five, will you? Hi. Sorry. Do you want a waffle? Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. I've been trying to talk to you ever since I got back from my trip. Why don't we spend the morning together? We can go for a walk on the beach. Maybe without our cell phones. No, Neil, I'm sorry. I have to cook. You have to cook? I thought we were going to the Cohens' for dinner. Well, we're not. Kirsten's turkey is always dry and Sandy, with his long boring speeches about the importance of family, I'd just as soon eat in. There's nothing in there. Then I should go to the market. Can I have my cell phone, please? Thank you. We're gonna have to talk eventually. Yeah, yeah, after the holidays, of course. So, what's next? Parsley. Wow, this trip to the grocery store has been a real success. I'm sure silent cart pushing is exactly what my mom envisioned when she sent us here. Well, what do you expect? For me to get over everything just because we're buying parsley? It's more than a garnish, Ryan, it's a good omen. Speaking of omens. Julie. Ryan. Hello, Julie. I wanted to thank you for that travel tip. Ensanada turned out to be the perfect vacation spot for the Cohens. We may get a time-share. Save it, Seth. I already got the lecture from your dad. Ryan, would you care to join me in the samples? I'll get the sweet potatoes. We've got two types of Gouda. This is the Beemster, and this is the Old Amsterdam. It's delicious. So the P.I. swears he'll have a location for Volchok by Monday. What'll we do until then? Just, uh, wait, I guess. I'll call you in the morning, I'll make a plan. Until then, act normal. Thank you. Hey, Sandy, I was just wondering when you were going to be home to help me with... Oh, my God. Taylor, I thought you were in France. In fact, what am I doing here when <i>Gai Paris</i> beckons? Au revoir. Hold on. When a kid is stealing stuffing in my kitchen, that's usually a sign that something's wrong. I would talk to you, Mrs. Cohen, but this is simply too private. I'll make you a plate of food. Living room? Ryan, listen, the important thing is Sandy can't suspect us. He needs to feel like we've moved on, that we've let go. Yeah, that's going to be kind of hard. He knows I haven't given up on Volchok. Kind of got into it this morning. Then you need to go smooth things over. Smile, apologize, lie, whatever it takes. Ryan, you want to get this son of a bitch just as badly as I do. That's a really hard thing to do with Sandy Cohen watching your every move. Yeah. I'll stop by his office on my way back. Oh, Ryan, one more thing. Do you happen to know how to cook a turkey? Never mind. You got married? His name was Henri Michel, and I met him outside the Place des Voges. He wooed me for a few whirlwind weeks, and the next thing I knew, I was in his family's chapel in Burgundy, tipsy off a 1953 Chateau Margaux and vowing to love him till death do us part. I can't believe this is happening. Taylor, you're usually so responsible. Well, needless to say it was <i>une erreur.</i> Now he won't agree to an annulment. He's a stubborn man. Sexy and well-endowed. But stubborn. So I came home... and I'm just too afraid to tell my mom now. I've known your mom for a long time. She might be tough, but she's your mom. Which means she loves you no matter what. That's so sweet... and totally wrong. Don't you think you're underestimating her? No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I just had the best idea. You could tell her. Now that we're like sisters, I'm sure you'd be happy to. No, that's your job. Mon Dieu! Je suis tres désolée, mais j'ai peur. Okay... I will talk to her, but I am not doing your dirty work. I am just going to put her in the right frame of mind. Great, that's great. She's in charge of the Turkey Trot-- the prix fixe meal over at the Yacht Club. She'll be there all afternoon. No, no, I can't do it today. I have a thousand things to do, Taylor. Mon Dieu. Mon coeur est cass?.. Okay, fine, I will talk to her today, but you're going to have to help me cook. Oh, Kirsten, I will be the best sous chef ever. You just watch. Hey. Hi. Hey. Uh, here, I sprung for roses. the cheapskate in me wanted to get you carnations, but it's a special occasion. This? Yeah, you're here, and not just for a whirlwind comic book intervention, but for an actual visit. Well, it's only for three nights. It's longer than you think. Uh-huh. Thanks, Greg. So, I'm going to go see the D.A., enter your guilty plea, and hopefully we can settle on a charge and a sentence by tonight. So I'll still be doing time? For what you did? Yeah, I'd say so. That Seth kid said, um... he said that you would help me. I am helping you. Helping turn you over to the authorities so you can get the punishment you deserve. You made a lot of mistakes. But you turned yourself in, and that was the right thing to do. After a while, being in Mexico and running all the time, it all started to feel like prison anyway. That's guilt for you. Follows you around. But you're here now. So we'll find a hotel room for you While I work things out with Otis. I really appreciate this. Well, listen, the sooner you're off the street, the sooner Ryan can start his life again. Yeah, I just want it all to be over. Oh, me, too. You have no idea. Excuse me, do you know where Sandy Cohen's office is? Yeah, it's inside to the left. But you just missed him. Oh, I did? Yeah, he just left with a client. Poor guy's working on Thanksgiving. No, no, no, no, no, Kirsten. Here, let me. You want to just lightly kiss the bird. Like so. I see. Oh, hi, Ryan. Did you know Taylor was back in town? Hello, Ryan. I know, you must be confused as to why I'm here, but in time... Do you know where Sandy is? He called a while ago. He said he had some errands to run. Did he say where he was going? No. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's fine. I'll be back later. I was hoping that you'd help with dinner. Okay, but only for a little while. My dad needs me back in crazy town. I just want you to witness the magic of a Cohen family Thanksgiving. Even if only for a few moments. All right. Hey, Ryan, look who showed up. Hi. Hey, Atwood. See, there's magic everywhere. Gourds, it needs gourds. Hi, guys. Hi, Summer. Oh, it's good to see you. You, too. Welcome home. Oh, did you bathe in a creek? Taylor, what are you doing out? Oh, um, I came clean to your mom, and now I'm helping her through Thanksgiving. Taylor... now that Seth and Summer are here, why don't they take over and we'll go talk to your mother. You're taking on Veronica Townsend? It's a death wish. Why don't you just baste the turkey. But just very lightly with the little brush thing and not the baster. Okay. All right. Okay. Gosh, I haven't been in this house in so long. Well, the house misses you-- so do I. In fact, upstairs has been asking for you. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. Well, I got to get back to my dad's house. Give me five minutes. Promise? Keep me honest. Ten. How's dinner coming? Fantastic. You wouldn't happen to know how to cook a turkey, would you? You've never cooked a turkey? Well, Jimmy always did it. And after we broke up, then we ended up at the Cohens'. Right. And the reason we're not going there is...? Get that, will you? Hey, Ryan. Hey. Is Julie home? She is, but I'd rather you didn't bother her right now. I just need a minute of her time. Yeah, I've been saying the same thing for six months. Maybe you can talk to her after the holiday. I... don't think you really understand what's going on here. No, you're right, I don't. I don't understand all the phone calls. I don't understand why we're not having dinner with your family tonight. All I do know is that I was once very excited about my life with this woman, and it all seems to be disappearing right now. I get it. I'm sorry. Tell your family I say happy Thanksgiving. I said burgundy candles, not orange. Now, you go get them, or I'll send a 911 page to my guy at the INS. Okay, off you go. Are you sure you don't want to come with me? No, no, no. My stomach's kind of doing that flip-floppy thing it does every time I see her. Kirsten Cohen, what a surprise. Have you been doing Pilates? You look thin. And I love your hair. Thanks, Veronica. Actually, I just came by to help. Oh, well, you can help me with the candles. So, this is your first holiday without Taylor. That must be hard for you. It is. You know, I tell my clients that I'm a mother first and a sports agent second. Uh, could you make those a little bit more parallel, like...? No, just... Maybe I should just do it. I feel the same way about being a mom. You have to love your children no matter what they do. Even if they disappoint you. Of course, and you would know. You know, with the shooting and the car accident, and Seth burning down a Newport group, and... Actually, I was talking about you and Taylor. Right. And I love Taylor unconditionally. You know, a wise woman once said, if you love till it hurts, there can be no more hurt, but only more love. You know who said that? The mother. Mother Teresa. Oh, my God, Taylor? What are you doing here? Mom, I need to talk to you. I'm gonna leave you two alone. You'll be fine. We only have a few minutes together. You sure you have to do yoga? I've been on a plane all day. I'm trying to reverse the blood flow. Fresh oxygen to the brain gives you clarity and peace of mind. I still can't believe you had no reaction to my tattoo. I had a reaction-- I told you to get that thing removed. Yeah, I'll get it removed. Did it hurt? Whatever. I was with my Marine buds. I barely felt a thing. I bet you cried. Like a baby. Glad you're home. Me, too. What's wrong? I just, I get upset when I think about... all of the food that the average American consumes during Thanksgiving, when so many people go without. Huh? We need to do something. We got to go. Got to go somewhere. Go? Go where? The soup kitchen-- we're gonna feed the homeless. Do we have to? We're already feeding Ryan, and he was homeless once. Hey, you can go or you can stay. Summer! How you doing? Better than the 2.8 billion people living below the poverty level. Are you okay with that statistic, Mr. Cohen? I don't think so. That's why I have to go. Who knew, out of all you kids, she'd turn out to be the young Sandy Cohen? Had to rub off on someone. We'll be back soon. Hey, honey. You know, I thought we were gonna be having dinner as a family, and here I am, being driven crazy by Taylor Townsend. I got news. Volchok came to see me today. Volchok Volchok? He turned himself in. I put him in a hotel while Otis finishes his paperwork. I figure we'll tell Ryan after the holiday. After he's already in jail. So he can't get at him. Well, yeah, the thought did cross my mind. So don't bother asking me where he is, 'cause I'm not gonna tell you. Look, you stop me from going after him-- that I get. But to defend him? I'm not defending him, Ryan. I'm negotiating the terms of his surrender. And he's gonna get every bit of what he deserves. Ryan, Sandy and I would only do what's best for you. Want to do what's in my best interest? Always. Leave me alone. Ryan. ??? Hey. Friends of Volchok, right? Used to be. No one's seen Volchok in months. Don't know where he is. Well, he's back in town. I need to find out where he's staying. I don't know. He called anyone, it was probably Heather. You got her number? Haven't talked to her. Might not be in town. I'm gonna need that number. Hey. Just for the record, that night... I don't want to talk about it. Look, the first stoplight, I jumped out, and I tried to find help, and when I got back to the car, Volchok was gone. Just needed you to know that. And I just need to find the guy. Look, I told you on the phone, I don't know where he is. He must've called you, told you he was coming back. He thinks that I'm gone, too. And I was. I'm only home to see my mom for Thanksgiving. I really shouldn't even be talking to you. I'm not gonna call the cops on you. You know, I spoke to him a few months after the accident, and... he sounded pretty messed up. Good. Thanks for meeting me. Look... maybe you should try to put it behind you. Just let him go. Good advice. Hello. Any luck. No. I've been to the bait shop, the diner. Can't find him anywhere. Oh, it just feels strange to be cooking with all this going on. Maybe we should call dinner off. No, keep it going. I got another idea where he might be. Well, call me as soon as you... Uh, I-I got to go. What happened? She called me irresponsible and stupid. And then she said that I would never be truly thin, because I have a naturally large thorax. Oh, Taylor, that's awful. And the worst part is-- oh, my God. These are like cardboard. You're gonna want to add some cream. You know, the worst part is, she said I'm no longer welcome in her house. I am <i>le vagabond.</i> You can stay here. Forever? Well, no. For-for one night. But we'll find somewhere for you to stay. Thank you, Kiki. And I am so sorry that after all you've done for me, I abandoned ship during the crucial hour before Thanksgiving. Now, let's see how you're doing with those pies. Did you smash the pecans finely, like I told you to? I skipped the pecan pie. You skipped the pecan...? Well, one pumpkin will be fine. There's only five of us. You may want to rethink that. We invited over some friends. Love the Cohen open-door policy. These aren't your friends. We were trying to help out at the soup kitchen, and apparently they said they had enough volunteers, like such a thing exists. Uh, just follow me to the family room. I really need to use your toilet. Oh, it's the first one on the left. Take these matches. I'm next. All right. You're next. Sorry. They can't stay. Well, I can't tell them to go. Summer will have a nervous breakdown. She's hanging by a thread. You know, I used to volunteer at the Y, teaching personal hygiene. So I could just run through the basics with them. Unfortunately, it means that I wouldn't be able to help you in here. Really, that sounds great. Okay. They stay, you keep them in one place, you keep them occupied. Okay. Who here has not seen... Battlestar Galactica, season one? I missed the season finale. ???  That's okay. Don't worry, Kiki, I got your back. digest the whole thing, though. Who here is a space... Julie. I thought you weren't speaking to me. I'm not calling to make peace. I'm looking for Ryan. Ryan? You told me to stay away from him, remember? Oh, come on. He called you as soon as he found out I had Volchok in custody. Volchok is in custody? So you really didn't know, huh? No, no, I didn't. Yeah He turned himself in this morning. I already spoke to the D.A. It should be a done deal by tonight. So it-it's really over. I sure as hell hope so. Julie? Julie? Mom, are you okay? I don't know. Well, do you want to lay down or something? Do I want to lay in the dark with nothing but my thoughts to distract me? No, Kaitlin, that is not what I want to do. Okay. Never mind. I'll just go find my dog. She's having a meltdown. Good luck. Julie, you look pale. Are you all right? I'm fine. I have a turkey to cook, potatoes to mash, and that's all I have to think about. Just... just think about the task at hand. Will you get out of here? You're in the way. I have to baste a turkey. Nobody registered hereby that name. Close, but he's not here. So I'll keep looking. Ah, why don't you come with me? Yeah? So you can take me home, give me one of your lectures? Oh, we're beyond all that. All right, so what are you doing here? Why don't you find out? Come on. There aren't enough chairs. Darryl needs a chair. Summer, can we talk... Hey. I'm just gonna make a seating area out of cushions on the floor. Summer, we need to talk. I can't talk, I have to mash these potatoes. Hand me the cream. No. No more distraction tactics. You and I both know what's going on here. Now these are ruined. I'm going back to the store. You wouldn't happen to have any baking soda, would you? Kaitlin, get that dog out of my house right now, or, so help me God, I will have it put to sleep. God, you would, wouldn't you? Kaitlin, where are you going? To the Cohens'. They don't hate the whole family, Mom, just you. Fine! Don't come crying to me when Kirsten's turkey tastes like rubber. Julie. Julie! Where are my keys? Julie, listen to me. Listen to me! I love you, but you are acting insane. I'm not insane, okay? What's insane is how I used to be, when all I would do is hang out with my best friend, and go tanning with her and go shopping and braid her hair and talk to her on the phone... Summer, stop. Let's be honest for a sec-- that's what this is all about. Marissa-- it's all about her. You got to stop running away and let yourself grieve. My keys. Stop running away from me. I'm not running away, I just didn't realize how late it was. My dad's probably totally freaking out. I'm sorry I said it. Just please don't go. You're the one who walked away, Neil. You had the affair, remember? Nothing happened with Gloria and me. I told you, I needed somebody to talk to. Well, you can talk to her all you want now. When I get back, I want you out of this house. It's my house. We'll see about that. Bye, Neil. Bye. He's in there. Otis said he needs some time to file the charges, so I put him up here. Room 102. If this is some kind of dare, I'm gonna take it. I trust you. Been waiting a long time for this, I bet. So what are you waiting for? You just drove away! You just left her there! Do it! Kill me! I just want it to be over, okay?! I don't care anymore! I just want it to be over. I just want it to be over. They're still in there? Yeah. Maybe we should go in. No, give ??? You didn't try to help. You didn't even stop. I got scared. I freaked, I, um... And she died. On the side of the road. I think about that night every day. That's all I think about. I wish I could take it back. I don't want to hear about how bad you feel. Tell me why you did it. Does it matter? It matters to me. I don't know. Okay. I mean... I was coming after you. You got the girl. I didn't, and that was hard for me to handle. I just... I wanted you to pull over. And it all just... It got out of control. So what? It was all an accident? Mm-hmm. A mistake? I know that doesn't change anything. So if you want to finish this... I'm not going to fight back. I'm not doing you any favors. You have to live with what you did. It's over. I'm proud of you. I'm sorry. You hungry? Starving. Well, let's go. Hold it, you got this? We'll take him in. Call you after I'm done. All right, thanks. Hey. Hey Where's my dad? Gone. Kaitlin? Gone. We can't go on like this anymore, can we? No. I just got her voicemail again. I'm going to go over there. I don't think ??? In fact, I am turning your ringer off. Don't. My girlfriend's freaking out. That's exactly what she should be doing. Seth, she needs to face what happened on her own before you can help her with it. Hey, you guys your mom says to get ready for dinner. Okay. You want to cut the bird? I'm hungry. Um... Darl, we're going to wait for the rest of the family. We're here. Oh, finally. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Glad you're home. Honey, who, uh, who are these gentlemen at the table? It's a long story, Dad. Could you pass the gravy? Yeah, sure, buddy. Hey. Didn't I defend you a couple of years ago for a B&E? Yeah. Now I remember. I called you crazy eyebrow man. Well, I'll take that as a compliment. An old client of mine, how do you like that? Yeah, it's pretty wild, Dad. You want to hear wild? I am ninety percent sure that's my dog. Okay, there is no way that this is your dog. This is little Julie. Uh-uh. That's Savage. Baby. I been looking everywhere for you. Come here. Oh. Okay, this cannot be happening. The Lord giveth and he taketh away. Job 1:21. Oh, but I'm no longer religious. But as a child, I went to Bible school and then all those quotes just kind of, grr, stuck with me ???with meIt ???is so awesome. Isn't it though? Hey, it's me. I'm heading back to Providence. Look, everything you said was true, and I need to deal with it, but I need to do it on my own. I'm sorry I am such a mess. It's just... I miss my friend. But I'll call you as soon as I get my head screwed on, okay. I love you. I left a message. I know I didn't like Seth when I first met him, but I got to admit he's grown on me. I think you two are going to be fine. Thanks for seeing me off. Of course. It's so crazy. To think the next time you come home, I might not be living here. Dad, are you going to take that job in Seattle? Well, the offer came at the perfect time. When the hospital is famous for being wonderfully quirky, it's called Seattle Grace. Is the stepmonster going with you? No, she'll visit. But we'll take it slow, I promise. I'm really sorry that you and Julie broke up. Yeah, it's not the Thanksgiving that I had in mind. It's too bad because I think that you and I could both use it. You know, I could take a later flight. Really? Yeah, it's not too late to have Thanksgiving. What'd you have in mind? I love Chili's. You and me both, Dad. Are we expecting somebody? I invited a few of my cousins over. I hope that's cool. That's cool. I'll... I'll handle it. Hi. Julie, whatever it is, it'll have to wait. We're having Thanksgiving. I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. I don't think I've ever heard you say that before. I don't think I ever meant it. Well, come on in. Sandy, why don't you pull out a chair. No, um... Go ahead. Tell me about her. What? Anything; just... tell me about her. I remember the first time I saw her. She was, uh... She was wearing this white top thing, and I think she had jeans on. She was standing at the bottom of the driveway. And I thought... Well, I thought she was really hot. Really hot. And she gave me this smile. It was a beautiful smile. It's a nice smile. And I don't know, we started talking, maybe smoked
