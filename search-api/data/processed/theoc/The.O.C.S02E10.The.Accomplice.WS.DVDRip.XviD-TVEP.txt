My ex is in town, but we never really broke up. Did you meet the ex? -I know you did. -All right. Y es, I did. -And who is he? -He's a she. -Jody went to sleep. -Cool. -So, what do I do? -What do you wanna do? What I wanna do is drive over to her apartment now and ask her flat out: "Alex, are we in a relationship... -...or not? " -Good. You should do it. -He's not doing it. -It's been almost a week, okay? I still don't know where Alex stands. Is she back together with her lesbian ex? If so, are they open to some sort of ménage à three-way... -...as in the film Summer Lovers? -I didn't even think of that. Yeah, well, I did. Quite a bit. If you have to wonder, it probably won't happen. Which part? The threesome or the relationship? So you never had a moment's doubt about you and Lindsay? -Not really. -Denial. Is there pollen or something? All right, there may have been a moment. Or two. -So, what'd you do? -He showed up on Lindsay's doorstep... ...and he said he's not going anywhere until she gave him a shot. That's what you should do. You should go to Alex, but instead of asking her... ...what she wants, tell her what you want. Is that how it works with you and Summer? Or you should just focus on the good stuff in your life. Like school. Or comics. -Yeah, I got nothing. -At least I've got my friends. Yeah. Well, if it isn't the Three Amigos. Hi. I'm so hungry. The step-monster keeps raiding my Zone breakfasts. -Hey. You didn't order yet, did you? -Hey. No, you're just in time. Thanks. Hey, come on. We can squeeze you in. -It's okay. I'm gonna see you later. -Oh, no, no, no. Where are you going? To get what I want. "Husband seeking to satisfy wife's curiosity. Enjoys tall--" Careful. Here's one, honey. It's a guesthouse. Close to the beach. It's got parking, fridge and hookups. Why look for a guesthouse instead of an office? A guesthouse can be a great office. Plus, this one has hookups. This high-rise office complex has panoramic ocean and country-club views. Sounds like Partridge, Savage and Kahn. Where is it? Next to Partridge, Savage and Kahn. Your old clients can find you. I'm not taking any of my corporate clients with me. I'm returning to public-interest stuff. That stuff made me want to be a lawyer. You can still be a public-interest lawyer in a private-sector office. This guesthouse is 850 a month. Yours is? -I can get a deal through work. -No, thanks. Well, I gotta go meet my realtor. -Maybe I should go with you. -No, no. I'll be fine. It's the same lady who got Jimmy his bachelor pad. Right. I'm going with you. Marissa. What are you doing in here? I'm sorry. I heard the music. -You're not at school. -Yeah, you're not at work. Yeah, I know. I'm running late. I'm down to my last clean shirt. We're out of coffee. When your mom is away, my life falls apart. Yeah, you should have gone too. You seem like you need a vacation. She's not on vacation. She's doing research for a magazine. In Europe, researching for a magazine about Orange County? Do you need a ride to school? I'm not going. I'm not feeling so well. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell you what. I'll call my physician, have him drop in on you after lunch. That's okay. I figured I should just stay home and rest... ...in case, you know, it's West Nile or something. All right. I'll be in my office all day if you need me. I'll call in and check up on you. I may not pick up, you know. I'll just be sleeping. -Hello? -So, what are we doing today? -I'm sleeping. -No, you're not. We're going to breakfast, and then we're going shopping. Don't you have school? Yeah, but my mom's in Europe, and my stepdad's completely clueless. Aren't you sick of me yet? We've hung out every day this week. No. Why? Are you sick of me? No, no, of course not. It's just... ...Jody's still here. -I thought she was going back to L.A. -Yeah, yeah, she was, she was... ...but we got into this huge fight, and then.... And then you spent the rest of the night making up? Who's knocking on my door at 9 in the morning? Yeah, right. Saved by the bell. Are you calling me from outside my door? Because that would be... ...creepy. -Good to see you too, Alex. -Seth. -Seth? -Can I call you back? -Doesn't anyone go to school anymore? -Listen, I'm sorry to wake you. I-- -Do I hear water running? -Yes. Jody's taking a shower. Jody. Jody's still here. That's great. That's fantastic. At least you're not taking a shower together. -Look-- -I just need to know where I stand. Seth, I told you. I just-- I don't do relationships. Yeah, well, you did Jody. So to speak. Yes, and look how well that turned out. What is that supposed to mean? -Jody. -Seth. Sorry. I would have introduced you guys, but I didn't want you to meet. I'm going back to bed. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You maybe wanna grab breakfast? We could go down to the.... --which you see in the center of the diagram here and multi-angle here. Okay? All right, see you next time. So are Kirsten and Sandy gonna care that Seth skipped first period? They won't be excited, but they're easygoing. Really? Kirsten is? Sandy is. Kirsten's more.... -Like her dad. -ln some ways, I guess. Am l? I mean, he's my dad too, so.... Is this a trick question? No. It's just I don't know him, and you do, so.... Why? Is he a monster? Well, he's not the greatest person in the world. To me anyway. He thinks I'm after the Cohens' money. Yeah, I know. But other than that, he's great. You should call him. And say what? "Hi. It's your illegitimate daughter. Wanna have lunch? " -You could have Kirsten ask him for you. -Yeah, she has. Couple times. So he'll call, right? I mean-- I mean, he's got to, sooner or later. Yeah, right, sooner or later. At the moment, this is the only beach-adjacent property... ...we have in your price range, Mr. Cohen. As you can see, it's a bit of a fixer-upper. That's one way to put it. Who are you kidding, Gail? This place is a first-class dump. And I like it. Sandy, no, you don't. You just want to have an office near the beach... -...so you can surf between clients. -I hadn't thought of that. Sandy, this is a surf shack, not a law office. That's exactly why I like it. Hello? Max? Unbelievable. How are you? It's my professor from law school. Now's a great time. I'm just moving into my new office. I'll be right back. -Sandy. You're moving in? -I'll take it. So, what are you doing in town? Really? Everything okay? I understand. We can talk about it when you get here. What's up with Cohen? I guess it didn't go well with Alex. -She broke up with him? -I don't know. Maybe. Well, why don't you go find out. And then report back to me. So how'd it go? The good news is, she told Jody to get the hell out too, so.... I'm sorry, man. -Thanks. It's all right. -Now you can get back... -...to your life, right? -I don't have a life, remember? Then you should get one. Do something for you. -Go sailing. -All right. -Continue to doodle. -Okay. -This is what you should be doing. -What? Drawing the women who wronged me as whip-wielding warrior princesses? -Yeah, in your own comic. -Yeah, okay. -Dude, you're awesome. -I appreciate it. Hey, Cohen, I got you a double latte because you looked sad. -Thanks. -Cohen's gonna do his own comic. -He is? -No, I don't-- Well, I don't know. What are you talking about? Do you not wanna do it? -No, I do, sort of. -Then let's bounce some ideas around. -Study hall, right now. Let's go. -All right. -Thanks for the coffee, Summer. -Yeah, thank you very much. You're welcome. So you and Seth are...? Friends. I hope. Someday. -And you and Jody are...? -Over. Finished. For good. Really? How does she feel about that? She hates me now, but, I mean, we mean too much to each other to let.... That bitch. She stole my necklace. -Which one? -We bought each other these matching... ...heart-shaped necklaces, like, a year ago, and mine's gone. I can't believe her. -How do you know she took it? -Because she was using the fact... ...that I still wear mine as a sign that I'm not over her, which I am. I just.... I loved it. Well, so let's go get it. You wanna go to L.A.? Now? -I can't. I have work. -We'll go tomorrow. -How? You have school. -No. I have a mom who's spa-hopping... ...and a stepdad who doesn't care about anyone but himself. Come on. You can't let her steal your heart. At the tone, leave a message for Julie, Caleb or Marissa. We 'll get back to you as soon as we can. -Kirsten's not here. -l' m actually here to see you. -lf you have a second. -I don't. It's about Lindsay. Shut the door. -What about her? -She's been asking questions about you. Who you are, what you're like. I told her. She still wants to get to know you. She sent you to tell me this? She has no idea I'm here. I just thought maybe I should-- Continue to position yourself between me and members of my family. If I wanted a relationship with Lindsay, I would have one. -Funny. That's what she said. -Smart girl. You have no idea. You should, though. How's your relationship with your father, Ryan? Is he still in jail? And you would be, too, if it weren't for Sandy. So I guess Lindsay and I are both better off. Thank you so much for your time. I was under the impression that you'd become a successful lawyer. Oh, my God. How are you, Max? It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since you were my favorite student. It is so good to see you. Well, come on in to my-- My new office. So, what have you been up to? Well, l-- Let's see, l-- I left Berkeley. I moved to Princeton. -I am retired now. -Congratulations. So, what brings you here? Sandy, I need your help. I have to find Rebecca. Why now? After all this time? Well, Sandy, I've.... I've had a couple of strokes. The doctors told me... ...that I should get my affairs in order as soon as possible. I just wanna be able to see my daughter once again before.... I understand. Well, you know, I haven't heard a thing since she ran away to Canada... ...22 years ago. -You haven't heard from her? -No, no, no. She and l... ...weren't exactly on speaking terms, even before the accident. I just thought that if she'd get in touch with anybody, Sandy, it'd be you. You were the love of her life. That was a long time ago. -We were kids. -No, she loved you, Sandy. Now, will you help me find her? I'll see what I can do. Thank you, Sandy. You know, I hate to stir up things when you have a wife and a family and-- No, my wife will understand. Will she? -You're going to prison? -Just for the day. I have to drive to Lompoc to see a prisoner there. -Who? -An activist I knew... ...back in my Berkeley days, Joe Zukoski. I'll be back before dinner. -What do you have to talk to him about? -Well, you know, a missing person. -Doing a favor for a friend. -Your old law school professor. -Yeah. -Who's missing? -Rebecca. -As in Rebecca Bloom? -Love of your life? -She is not the love of my life. -Sandy, you were engaged to be married. -We were engaged to be engaged. Until she burned down a nuclear lab site. We don't know if she did that for sure. -Sandy, she fled the country. -Well, I know, but her dad is dying... ...and he asked me to find her for him. He was my mentor in law school. I wouldn't be a lawyer if it weren't for him. -I can't say no. -What will you do when you find her? If I find her, I'll try convincing her... ...to turn herself in and, you know, let the case go to trial. Well, seems someone's feeling better today. -Not really. -Sorry to hear that. I called several times to check up... -...on you yesterday. -I must have been asleep. Then I came home, and you weren't here. -I was worried. -Gotta go. -Where? -Out. To the doctor. -Marissa, come back here. -Or what? You're not my dad. You know what? If you want to parent someone... ...why don't you go over to Lindsay's house and ruin her life. That's right, you already have. Don't wait up. So, what's it about? Heroes and, you know, villains. -Good and evil. -Sure. Darkness, and then you have light. -You guys have no idea, do you? -Not so much. But you have to admit, it's pretty exciting. Our very own comic book. -Hey. It could be autobiographical. -Yeah, it could. Yeah, the life of, like, a young Jewish boy growing up in Orange County. -I like it very much already. -A young Jewish boy with powers. Sure. A kid with a secret. -ln a town full of secrets. -Fistfights, fashion shows. -Basically, life in Orange County. -But with powers. I like it a lot, and-- -What have you done to my boyfriend? -Look, it was his idea in the first place. -We just had a major breakthrough. -Y eah, we did. You realize how lame you just sounded? Now, now, Summer, if you're not nice, somebody's not gonna be in the comic. Yeah. Shaking in my boots, Cohen. Sweetie. I will see you out front after school. Actually, we're working after school. But I would love to, you know, hang out with you a little bit later. Perhaps dinner and a movie? Well, I guess. Just not a comic-book movie. -Comic-book movies suck anyways. -True. -Dude, you didn't like X2? Really? -I've seen better. What have you done to him? I swear to God, Cohen... ...if Brainstorming Boy doesn't turn back into my boyfriend-- -Brainstorming Boy. Brainstorming Lad. -Brainstorm. Let's work with this. Brainstorming Kid. Brainstorming young ward with a secret identity, which is... ...at night he's Brainstorming Man, and what that is, is he's a genius. The contracts have been vetted twice, so I just need you to sign. Dad? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. You take good care of me. Better than I deserve. -What's that mean? -I haven't been the best father. Pretty much, no. -Are you still in touch with Lindsay? -Y eah. Are you? -No. She doesn't ever bother calling me. -Dad, she's in high school. If you wanna hear from Lindsay, you have to call her. You were right. Caleb Nichol is not a good guy. Why, what happened? Did he call you? No, but I A9-dot-com'd him last night... ...and, according to the OC Weekly, he's everything that's wrong... ...with Western civilization all wrapped up in one guy... ...so even if he did call me.... Oh, my God. He's calling me. It says the Newport Group. -Why is he calling me? -No, it's not. It's probably Kirsten. Right. Sorry. -Hey, Kirsten. -Lindsay. Caleb Nichol. I was thinking it's time you and I sat down. What was that about? It was Caleb. He wants to have dinner tonight. -You're kidding. -Will you come with me? -I don't think that's a good idea. -Please. I'm not gonna go without you. -He won't be happy about this. -Do you care about his happiness? -I care about yours. -Well, then I will see you tonight. So, what does the butterfly mean? It means I was drunk. No way. I was drunk. I had just been emancipated from my parents. The words "Mom" and "Dad" with an X through them was too expensive. You got emancipated? -I thought only child stars did that. -Yep. Me, Hilary Duff, Lil' Bow Wow. Wait, so how did you do it? I petitioned the court. I had my parents sign the form, which they were happy... ...to do when they found out about me and Jody, and that was it. I was free. Well, I wish I could do that. -Piss your parents off bad enough. -Believe me, I've tried. Well, then I guess they really love you. Do you ever miss yours? Sometimes. But my friends are my family, you know? I know. Let's open up A. Sandy Cohen. Couldn't believe it when they told me. How are you, Joe? Well, not as good as you. You look good. Successful. What happened? You sell out? No, actually. I did 1 5 years in the public defender's office. Good for you. Maybe you can work me up an appeal and get me out of here. How? You confessed. To an act of civil disobedience, not manslaughter. You set the place on fire, and a man died. It was an accident. The custodian wasn't supposed to be there. You know that. Like any of that matters now. What do you want, Sandy? I'm looking for Rebecca. Sandy Cohen has come to me looking for Rebecca. Let it go. This isn't about you and me. When it comes to Rebecca, it's always been about you and me. Well, not anymore. Okay. -Then what's this about? -Her father. He's sick. He's looking for her. I'll tell you what. He can look as far and wide as he wants to. He's never gonna find her. -So you're not gonna help me. -I can't help you, Sandy. Rebecca... ...she's dead. She's dead? I'm so sorry. I can't believe this. I can't believe it either. -Are you calling Max? -No, an old friend of mine. A guy in the group. He's a lawyer now in Vancouver. Hello, yes. -Directory assistance for Vancouver. -Why? What will you find out? Y es, please, I'd like the number for Mark Denham, D-E-N-H-A-M. Thank you. If she was sick, there'd be insurance forms or hospital records or something. And, God forbid, if she were dead, there'd be a death certificate. So you don't think she's dead. I can't believe that if she were dying, she wouldn't try to contact her dad. Or you. We'll just get what we came for, then get out of here. You all right? You seem nervous. No, I'm not. I just-- Don't let her intimidate you, okay? And let me do all the talking. And don't mention anything about the necklace. -I thought you were over her. -I am. I am. I just-- Don't let her talk me into staying the night. You can't. You have to take me home. Right. Good one. Remember that. I had a feeling it might-- What is she doing here? We came to get Alex's stuff. And we're not staying. If you say so. -Hey. -Hey. Bryan Gatwood, a.k.a. Kid Chino, the strong but silent youth... ...from the wrong side of the tracks, who, when provoked... ...unleashes his fists of fury. Maybe we should change his superhero name to Overdressed Lad. Lindsay asked me to be a buffer between her and Caleb. I thought we'd work tonight. Grandpa hates you. -I said that. She thinks I'm overreacting. -Hey, man. At least you're on his radar. He once asked my mom if I was mildly retarded. -Wait till he finds out about your powers. -What powers? Turns out I don't make a very convincing superhero. Well, you do have powers. -Hey, can I see these? -Yeah, sure. -What are these? -They're just sketches I did in Portland. -The summer without Summer. -Has Zach seen these? -No, I'll show him tonight. -No, you won't show Zach. -They're drawings. -Of a girl you were obsessed with. First of all, "obsessed," it's a pretty strong word. Maybe you're right. Therefore, I won't show him. -They're really good, though. -Thanks. Hey. Don't let Grandpa scare you, all right? Remember, you're Bryan Gatwood, fists of fury. -Sure you don't want a beer? -We have to drive back. T onight. Okay, so far I have found two T -shirts, a bra and my Phat jeans. -What else do you have of mine? -Nothing, I swear. -So you won't mind if I kept looking. -You can look all night if you want. I won't be long. Breakups, huh? Get ready. You're next. -No, I'm not her-- -I'm sure you're not. My motorcycle boots. -Those are mine. -How can you say these are yours? -Because I bought them. -Okay, see, that is your problem. Okay. Here we go. -I'm gonna go to the bathroom. -Tell me what my problem is. -I can't wait to hear. -I don't know where to begin. You know what? Keep my boots. Keep my records. It's fine. -It's not fine. -What are you talking about? You can't just come here, take all your stuff. Actually, I can. What do you want from me? I want you to stay. I want to talk about what's going on here. Why don't you take Alex's jeep home. I'll bring her back later. I can't. -Why? -You think I'd leave my girlfriend alone... -...with you overnight? -I thought she wasn't your girlfriend. Yeah, well, think again. Let's go. Okay, that was awesome. Really? You think she bought it? She thought we were sleeping together... -...when you met at the club last week. -She did? -I defended your honor. -I appreciate that. Are you kidding? I owe you so much now. I got my Phat jeans, I got my CDs... ...and who cares if I didn't get-- My heart. -How did you...? -I'm sneaky like that. And now you have both. No. This one's yours. -How's it look? -Good. -I guess we gotta get you home, huh? -No. I have a better idea. -What do you think? -I think you're the missing link... ...between Jack Kirby and, I don't know, Eric Wight. -Hey, thanks, man. -Zach. I'm pulling the plug. You were supposed to get me an hour ago. I know. I'm sorry. Seth and I were working-- I don't want hear it. What are you guys, like, Kavalier and Gay? -That's funny. -I know. I'm sorry. Listen, Seth, I'll call you. We're leaving. Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa. No, we're not. Is that supposed to be Marissa? Cohen, did you do these? Is that Ryan? Captain Oats. Is that you? Well.... Where am l? Not finished yet. Just wanted to get the attitude right. There's a lot of attitude. -We made good progress today. -It's definitely keeping my mind off girls. Keep talking comics, I don't think girls will be an issue ever again. She's so supportive. That's why I like her. Shoot. I left my purse upstairs. I'll be right back. -We're gonna miss the movie. -Whose fault is that? Sorry, Captain Oats. Hope you don't pull up lame. Come on, Sum. We're gonna be late. What are you doing up there? Thank you. So, thank you... ...so much for calling this afternoon and suggesting dinner. -lt was-- -Long overdue. I meant to call you after the holidays, but work has been all-consuming. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean... ...I can imagine. So, what about you, Lindsay? How is school? -What are you studying? -Hey, sorry I'm late. Traffic. That's okay. We just got menus. My apologies. If I'd have known we'd be three, I'd have asked for another one. Sorry. It's my fault. I should've said something earlier. I should have assumed Ryan would want... -...to make himself part of this. -He didn't. I asked him to come. -Look, I can leave if you want. -Yes, Ryan. You scammed your way into one of my daughter's lives. Why stop? -This isn't about me. -lsn't it? You set this up. -You came to my office and to dinner. -You went to his office? I was trying to help. He said you wanted a relationship. If that were true, he wouldn't be here. So, what do the two of you really want? Money? -What? -A new car? An lvy League education? Have your accomplice here... ...drop by my office with a list of demands. That should cover it. Good night. Hey, Mark. Sandy Cohen again. I know this is my fifth message today, but I'm still up. So if you get this, please call back. Thanks. -You gonna stay up all night? -Well, I'm not tired, that's for sure. No word from your lawyer friend? No. No. And no confirmation she's dead. What if she's not? What if your suspicions are right? One way or another, she's gone. What will it take for you to let her go? -What are you talking about? -Rebecca Bloom. The smart, political, Jewish woman... ...that you were supposed to marry before you ended up with me. You're still in love with her. -That is not true. -Then come to bed. Hello? Mark. Hey. I'm sorry to be harassing you, but, you know, time is of the.... Okay. Well, thanks for calling back. All right, take care. She's dead. -What are you gonna do? -I gotta call the professor... ...but l-- I can't tell him this on the phone. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Maybe I need to let go of her too. I'm gonna go. I won't be long. Princess Sparkle, you are not going to believe this. -I'm sorry. -Why are you sorry? I made you come to dinner. I know how much you hate him. -I don't hate him. -Yeah. Well, he hates you. So for you to have gone to his office... -...for me was-- -A mistake. I really didn't want anything from him. I just wanted to ask him some questions, you know? Stupid stuff. Maybe I don't need a dad. You know... ...I've gone all this time without one. I turned out okay. Right? -Maybe I could talk to him. -No. -Or ask Kirsten to talk to him. -No. You've done enough. More than enough, and.... You said it yourself. He's not a good guy. Yeah, but he's your dad. -Are you sure I can't--? -I'm sure. But thanks. Let me just change my shirt, then we can go. -Your shirt is fine. I'm telling you. -Then why is it sticking to me? -Am I bleeding? -Let me see. Wow. No, you're not bleeding. See for yourself. Oh, my god. That is so hot. Oh, my God. What have you done? Nothing. Get out of here, Caleb. This is my house. My home. Fine. You know what, then? We'll leave. -You're not going anywhere. -Oh, really? Are you gonna stop me? Yeah, that's what I thought. Come on, Alex. Nice house. Come in. Hey. What are you doing here? I-- I came to return something that I stole. Oh, you found it. Great. Okay, here's the thing. I know it's totally creepy. Okay? I know that. It was a very long summer. I'm sorry. I will destroy all of them right now. -I just need to find my X-Acto knife. -No, Cohen. Don't. -I think they're really good. -Yeah? Yeah. I mean, well... ...the boobs are a little big, but.... Well, I mean, aren't they? -We can redo the boobs. -And, you know... ...I'm not so sure about the mask either. -Now, that's what I'm talking about. -Yeah? So then you don't mind? No. Well, not as long as I have boob approval. Okay. Do you mind if I have one of these? Yeah, sure. You can actually have them all if you want. -Yeah? -Although, maybe it's not a good idea... ...to tell Zach about them all. -Or any of them. -I was thinking the same thing. Just because it may upset the partnership. -Yeah, and it could be bad for business. -Exactly. Okay. I'll let you get back to work... ...because I expect my own action figure by Chrismukkah. -Wow. Okay. Well, I'll see what I can do. -Okay. -Thanks, Cohen. -Yeah. Hey, professor. Well, any chance you could meet me tonight? Yeah. How about my office? I'll see you then. Hey, how was dinner? I wouldn't know. Caleb took off before we could order. -Because you punched him in the face? -No. But you wanted to. I could tell you wanted to. That's good. Hey, listen, he deserved it, I'm sure. I love the guy, but come on. -He's Lex Luthor. -It's my fault. I keep trying to help. -I keep making everything worse. -Well, Ryan, that's what heroes do. Okay, what else are you gonna do with fists of fury? Homework? The dishes? -How'd it go with Zach? -Great, until Summer came over... ...and stole my sketchbook. -What? What'd she do? -I thought she'd get a restraining order... ...but it turns out she'll just get her own action figure. -So she liked it? -Yeah. Summer and I may be stepping forward in our relationship. Knowing us, Lindsay and l will take a step back. -Hey, so between the two of us.... -We're right back where we started. Well, at least we haven't lost any ground. Except you won me. Here we go. Well, l.... I see you've got your hands full. I'm sorry to call you here so late. No, no, no. Actually, Sanford, I was gonna call you. I have something to show you.
