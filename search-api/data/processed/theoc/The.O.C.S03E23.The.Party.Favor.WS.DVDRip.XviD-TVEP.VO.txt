- Could be, if I was ready for it. I'm not looking after her anymore. Treat her right. I saw Theresa at the airport. She had a baby with her. - Say hi, Daniel. - Hi, Daniel. - He's not yours. Eddie's the father. - You wanna grab a bite? - You can tell me about him? - Yeah, I'd like that. To Sandy Cohen, who has told me countless times... ...how important this hospital is to him. They say when you grow up, you marry your father. I thought I'd escaped that. All my sins. Very detailed. If I ever screw up again, give that to my parents. - Cohen? - Anna? So you are going to Brown. - You just didn't wanna come with me. - You're probably confused right now. No. Everything you've done up until now finally makes sense. - Rhode Island School of Design? - You'll be in the same state. Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna? It's senior prom. It's mythic. Yeah, well, it's ties and dresses and photos with parents. - Sounds like any other dance. - It's not. It's the romantic capstone... ...to your entire adolescence. If Summer and I don't go together... ...it's over. - Well, ask her. She's still not talking to me. You told her nothing's going on between you and Anna? I try, but every time we get close, she blows her rape whistle. - Rape. - Well, you know, I'm not going. So if you wanna hang out, rent a movie... Ryan, I love you, but if I have to spend my senior prom playing... ...video games with you, I'll kill myself. Besides, I left Summer a message... ...telling her I'll meet her. - She'll show? I kind of pretended I was a Brown admissions guy. - It's prom, anything goes. Hi. - What will it be? - Chicken. - I'll have beef. Why aren't you gonna ask someone? What about Tina Wu? She's been looking really hot lately. - What about Theresa? - Yeah, I don't think so. - You've been spending time with her. - I have. She's coming to the house. The baby thing's resolved, the pressure's off. - It's perfect. Do it. - She still has a baby. - She can't just, you know... - They have things called babysitters. I'm just saying, it's senior prom, she's your childhood sweetheart. You have to respect the romantic symmetry. I'll think about it. I appreciate you not bringing up... ...Marissa and I going as friends. - Well, I get it, it's in the past. Plus, I assume she'll be going with the surf-Nazi... ...unless he's selling crack to blind kids... ...or fondling some girl at the end of the pier. Maybe that's his cousin. His really dirty cousin. - Hi. Leave. - Okay, Summer... - No, I'm meeting someone. You, leave. - The Brown guy? How did you know that? I'm sorry, it's the only way I could get you to meet me. You are sick, you know that? Deranged. - No. No. - Yes. Yes. No, our kiss was on Halloween. It was my sixth birthday. My mom let me have dancing. - You didn't know how, so you hid. - You tracked me down and kissed me. - How did I ever block that out? - I don't know. This is crazy, do you wanna go to prom with me? What? Okay. Wait, that's not why I'm here. So you're gonna think I'm really lame... ...but would you maybe wanna go to prom with me? You're serious? Give me two minutes. I ordered pancakes for you, chocolate chip. - Fine, two minutes, but that is it. - Okay. Somebody wrote "prom" on my pancakes. That is so weird. - Weird. - Oh, my God. Yeah, it's tomorrow night. So it's kind of late notice, but... Or not. You know what, it's a bad idea. No, Ryan, it's just that there's this guy that I work with. And we're not really dating, or anything... ...but we've become close. - No, I understand. - I should probably get ready for school. - Okay. So, what, you just hate prom? Pretty much. Why? Did you have a bad prom experience? I've heard there's support groups for things like that. You could recover. I haven't spoken to you in four days. You think pancakes will make me forget... ...you and Anna went behind my back? - We did not... - Or that I saw you guys at the airport... ...in your long, tearful goodbye. - You know... - What? Did I ever tell you how much my mom loves babysitting? l... I never actually made it to prom. I... I didn't get that close to graduation. Well, all the more reason to go now... ...because you'll have me there to protect you. Okay? All right. Not only will I not go to prom with you... ...but if you and I were on an island, I'd take the nourishment... ...that your meager frame has to offer, then I'd feed your bones to the sharks. - So did she like the pancake? - Yeah, she loved it. Then she said if we were stranded on an island... ...she'd feed my bones to the sharks. I think it's hopeless. - Wait, she doesn't really think that we... - She saw us hugging in the airport. Oh, my God, this is all my fault. - No, it's not your fault. - Yes, it is. If I hadn't been there, then you would have made up... ...and you would be going to prom right now. - You have to tell her the truth. - I tried, but... No, not about us. You have to tell her that you lied about getting into Brown. - I don't think I can do that. - But you have to. You've no choice. You've done everything else. I know, but last time I lied... ...I had to write this confession, everything I'd done wrong. - My whole drug phase and... - You had a drug phase? I smoked a couple of joints. I promised I'd never lie again. - I don't think she's gonna forgive me. - She wants to feed your bones to sharks. - You have nothing to lose. - <i>Listen, Anna, I appreciate your help...</i> ... but, I don 't know, it's over. I give up. Anyways... ... I'm gonna talk to you later. Man. You off? I should be home in time for dinner. Hey, isn't this prom weekend? Weren't you talking about having everybody over for pictures? We did. Ryan doesn't have a date. Seth and Summer seem to be in some fight. That's too bad. It's senior prom. It's a milestone. Maybe we should try and convince them to go. Okay. When are we gonna talk about us? In public again, or were you thinking about... ...something more private this time? - I'm sorry I attacked you. - But at least I got you to listen. - I'm sorry I made it so difficult for you. - So, what do we do? - We should give the boys the weekend. They're gonna be gone in a few months. And then you and I can figure out how best to proceed. - I'm gonna go. - Sandy, there's something else. At the end of that dinner, I... - I just wish I'd apologized then. - Oh, that's okay. We'll be fine. - Oh, Summer. - Hey, Taylor. Summer, wait. I have a big surprise for you. But first, here are yours and Marissa's prom tickets. I need 50 bucks each for the after-party. I rented The Bait Shop. It is gonna be such a rager. - You know what, I don't think I'll go. - You were queen last year. - You have to go. - Well, the queen is dead. I see. Well, perhaps you would like to hear who your date is. - What are you talking about? - I got you a date. Quiet. Now, you know how I'm going with Seung Ho? The guy from the Korean barbecue? We totally found each other at the sweatshirt party. He's got this wonderfully hairless body. It's like hooking up with a seal. - I have to go. - So it turns out... ...his cousin, Young Nam, is visiting from Seoul. His English is a little <i>gju grae.</i> But Seung Ho says he's huge on the K-Pop scene. - What the hell is K-Pop? - Korean pop. K-Pop. Anyway, his band's called Big Korea, and he's a model too. They based a couple of anime characters on him. I'm not gonna go to prom with some Asian pop singer... ...that barely speaks English. - Summer. Cohen deceived you. It is your duty as a woman... ...to make him pathetic and small by going to prom... ...with the hottest guy you can find. That's a good point. - Are you sure he's hot? - At his last concert... ...a gang of crazed schoolgirls torched a cop car. Big Korea. Hey. How you doing? Hey. Good. - Are those prom tickets? - Yeah. I asked someone. Theresa, actually. Well, that's great. - Yeah. - So the baby... Really cute, but not mine. What about you? Are you going? I can't remember whether you and Volchok are together... Yeah, on both counts. - Yeah? - He wasn't exactly enthusiastic... ...but he said yes. - Well, that's great. - Yeah. - I should be getting to class. - Right. Congratulations on the Theresa thing. - See you. - See you. - <i>Hey, it's Summer, leave a message.</i> - Summer, hey. I just wanna apologize for what happened... ...in the girls' bathroom today. I didn't mean to follow you in... ...or spook Mrs. Rushfield. I was just trying to explain that the idea of a romance... ...between me and Anna is so insane that it... - Hello, Seth. - I gotta go. Yeah, yeah. All right, all right, all right. - Well, well, look who's here. - I wanna talk to you. - I'm not in the mood to talk. Try later. - You can listen. - I saw you on the pier last night. - Last night, last night... - I don't remember that far back. - You remember the girl you were with? Long hair, tattoos, not much like Marissa. You know, you are something else. But tell me this, why would I cheat on Marissa? I mean, that girl is hot, right? In every way. But then you already knew that, didn't you? You wanna see how far you can push me? Keep at it. I already fell for that Lethal Weapon psycho bit once. - It's not happening again. - Hey, Kevin, I think there's... ...like, a snake in the shower... - What are you doing here? - Yeah, Ryan. What are you doing here? Kirsten called. She's having people over for photos tomorrow... ...and I just thought I'd invite you. - Oh, that's really sweet. - Yeah, so sweet. So sweet. - Okay, ignore him. We'll be there. Yeah. Hello. - Hey. - Hi. Anna. Seth said you were in town. Hey, how are you? I'm good. And you look much more grownup. - Don't we all. You staying with parents? - My aunt and uncle. Last year, my parents switched houses. We're a quirky family. - Are you going to prom? - Yeah. Actually, I'm going with Theresa. There she is. Look, a true friend, Ryan. - Two thousand miles she flies. - In a middle seat. All to make sure Summer and I go together. - Tell me, would you do so much? - Let's not test it. Guilt can be a powerful motivator. I'd tell you it's not your fault, except I wanna hear this plan. - In phase one... - Hear that, Ryan? Phase one. That suggests multiple phases. In phase one, I am going to go over to Summer's right now... ...and tell her that there is nothing going on between us. Okay, out of curiosity... ...what do you got for phase two? - In the off chance that phase one fails... ...phase two, you take me to prom. I brought a dress. Yeah, I better get going. I'll call you. - See you later. Bye. - Bye-bye. I don't know, I kind of like it. - I'm going to kill Taylor. - Why? - Come on, he's cute. - How can you tell? He's in a space suit. So do you think Kevin will like this? Yeah, if it rips off easy. This was supposed to make Seth jealous. - What's that? - Just Seth's napkin confession... ...detailing all his lies and deceptions, including his pathetic stoner phase. I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten to know their son better. What? You can't do that. I can. We had a deal. He told me that if he screwed up... ...I could show this to his parents. Yeah, but what would be the point? - Revenge. - Don't you think that maybe... ...he's telling the truth about him and Anna? I mean, do you really think that they would do that to you? Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - Oh, my God. - No. Hi, Anna. - It's good to see you again. - You too. I'm gonna go try this on. What...? I need you. - What are you doing here? - Summer, I wanted to talk to you. You have to believe me, there's nothing going on... ...between me and Seth. - You are still my Blanche, you know. - Nice try. - I saw you guys hugging at the airport. - That was not what you think it was. - We were celebrating. - Celebrating what? The future. If I flew 2000 miles, I'd come up with a better story. - It's the truth. Seth... - My date's gonna be here soon. He's kind of a rock star. You may have heard of him, Big Korea. Well, I'm not surprised. Thanks for coming by. Summer... Look, Summer, I'm sorry that you don't believe me... ...but if you're going with someone, would you mind if I went with Seth? Why would I mind? - Okay, then, see you there. - See you. So how exactly does this plan go again? Summer sees me with Anna at the dance... ...and confronted with the reality of a world without Seth Cohen... ...she comes to her senses. - Because a world without you... Is a world without sun, Ryan. It's a world without warmth. I don't get it either, but we should trust Anna on this one. She has more knowledge of the female psyche than we could hope for. That's so true. Aren't you guys ready yet? People are gonna be here. - What is it? What's wrong? - No, you look... I'm getting ready still. - Hello. Welcome. - These are my parents. How are you? Oh, nice to see you. - Come on in. - Good to see you again. You look beautiful. Good to see you. Thank you. Hey, check it out. That's Summer's date. - Looks like the guy in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i> - Here are the Yangs, Elena and Tom. Hey. How are you? Hey. Oh, my God, you look beautiful. You too. It's good to see you. Glad you could make it. Ryan, I'm so glad that you and Seth found dates. - Thank you. - I'm gonna need 50 bucks... ...from each of you for the after-party. - I'll take care of that. Here. - Thank you, Mr. Cohen. - You're welcome. Attention, everybody. The limos are waiting, so, ladies, put your purses and wraps... ...and things on the bar so we can all go out to the pool and take pictures. All right? - Yeah, yeah. - Where's the bathroom? Down the hall. Okay, you guys, we all need one with all of the kids. Get together. Hey, has anyone seen Kevin? I think he's still in the bathroom. All right, I'll get him. The parents wanna take a photo of everyone. We're waiting on you. Fine. Look. What now? - You gonna tell me I can't drink? - I don't have a problem with drinking. But if you screw this up for Marissa... ...I'm gonna kick your ass. - Okay. - Oh, my God, you know what this is? - What? This is the cave from <i>Goonies.</i> I've died and gone to heaven. Taylor, this is amazing. Yeah, this is way better than any dance I ever designed. Marissa, that means so much to me. You know, I've been saying that, but no one listens. Wow, you and I at prom together. Who would've thought? I know. I guess sometimes things just work out. Laughing boy. Hi. Where's that flask you're always whipping out? - You wanna spike the punch? - Read my mind. - All right. Come on over here. - That's so unlike you. Big Korea. Hi. Hi. Come on. Go. I'll put my purse down, then we can hit the dance floor. - Great. - Okay. - Are you sure about this? - Yes, Seth, you just have to trust me. Come on, let's go take a picture with Captain Hook. - All right. - Come on. - Oh, hi, Lisa. - Hi. - So glad you made it back for prom. - Thanks, Taylor. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Or almost anything. - I thought you did great on <i>Idol.</i> - Thanks. Do you know where Simon gets those skin-tight V-necks? I totally wanna get one for Seung Ho. Have I thanked you yet for coming? - About 40 times. - Is something wrong? You're little friend walked off with my flask. Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll bring it back. All right, well, I'm gonna go smoke some cush. Wanna come? You know, I actually want to enjoy prom. But come find me when you get back then. Did I hear something about smoking certain substances? Because I know someplace private. Lead the way. Maybe I'm being sentimental... ...but watching the kids head off to prom... ...I can't help but think, "Where did the time go?" I remember the first day Summer went to kindergarten. She changed her outfit three times... ...and she came home crying because another girl was wearing the same top. - The other girl was Marissa. - Of course. Wasn't it kindergarten that Seth would only answer to Boba Fett? Gosh, Boba Fett. That was fourth grade. No, it was fifth grade. Oh, gosh, I just can't believe... ...I was only a year older than Marissa is now when I married Jimmy. It's amazing the surprises life brings you. - Some good, I hope. - Very good. I'd like to propose a toast to the two of you. We haven't thrown you an engagement party, but we couldn't be more pleased. - Thank you. - Cheers. Wouldn't you know. I'm sorry. I have to take this. It's a colleague. I'll be right back. - Such a busy man. - Yes. Well, I just hope Neil and I are as happy as you and Sandy. No, actually, I'm having dinner at his home right now. What's up? Well, can I tell him? Right. Okay. All right, I feel good about that. - How about a dance? Let's dance. - Thank you. - I'm just gonna go talk to her. - No, Seth, you can't. Well, look at her. She looks miserable. - Let alone, kind of plastered. - Well, that's the point. At least, the miserable part. - I don't think I can do this. - Seth, the plan is working. It was easy for her to doubt you when you're all begging to get back together. But now that she might have really lost you... ...she's thinking, "Maybe I should've really believed him." Really? Because it looks like she's describing... ...how she'd use my body for food, then feed my bones to the sharks. Excuse me, can I have your attention, please? Hi. I would like to welcome you all to the Pirate's Ball. Thank you. Okay, now, before I announce your pirate king and queen... ...I would just like to take this moment to say... ...that it's been an honor to be your social chair this year. Just open the envelopes! Well, excuse me, if I have slaved away all year... ...just so you could have a good time. - Boring! Fine. Oh, just so you know... ...I thought it was only fair to take myself out of the running. So no calling for a recount. Okay, your 2006 queen is... Oh, my God! Two years in a row, Summer Roberts! Oh, my God. Go, Sum! Oh, my God. I didn't think you're boring. I love you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Oh, God. You guys, thank you so much. You guys... What's going on? - Tiara. - Oh, tiara. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, so thank you so much, because being your queen is just... - Is it a million degrees in here? It's hot. - You know what... ...perhaps we should find out who your king is. Screw that! You know what? Actually, let me introduce you to my date. Hold this. He's right here. This is my date. He's the number one pop star in Korea. Anyways, I promised him that if I won... ...that I would give him a big, fat kiss! - That's not part of the plan. - She's just fighting it. This is good. How do you like that, Cohen? Man overboard! Man overboard! Oh, my God! Are you okay? What idiot made that stage so short? - Summer, are you okay? - Back off! You know, just... Everyone, leave me alone. Okay? She needs a moist washcloth, or maybe, like, a towelette. - Cohen. - What? What? Is there a no-towelette clause in your plan? Because right now I'm thinking phase two sucks. Does anyone have a towelette? Anyone have a towelette? Hey, is she all right? Yeah. Maybe it's time to go to the after party. - That's a good idea. - Hey, I couldn't find Kevin. - He just disappeared. - Okay, I'll find him. Hey, where's my crown? - All right, I'd better... - Who stole my crown? Who is it? This is the guy. I told him I was coming here tonight, and... I should probably take this. - I'm sorry. It's gotten a little crazy. - Yeah, a little crazy. Little bit. But there's no place that I would rather be. And that's what I'm gonna tell him. I'll see you in a minute. Ryan? Hey! What are you doing? So Seung Ho and his cousin got Summer in the limo. Have you found Kevin? - No. Let's look inside. - He might have come out here to smoke. - Nope. I checked. - You checked? Why are you being weird? Are you sure he's not out here? Oh, my God. - Get out of here. - What? - Get out of here. - Jerk. Is that it? Can I go now? - Why? - What did you expect, huh? Did you think you were gonna just dress up your bad boy... ...take him to your party so your friends can see how cool you are? - You know it's not like that. - Oh, please. You just wanted to turn me into a little bitch boy like him. You're nothing like him. Clearly, I was wrong about you. Finally, you're learning. Honestly, Kirsten, I'm so glad you guys are doing better. You really scared me last week. I even scared myself. Julie... ...last week at dinner I had a drink. - What? Oh, my God. - Now, it was the first in 11 months. It was only one glass. I've been going to AA meetings every day. But it happened. - Have you talked to Sandy about this? - No, I tried... ...even before, when I could feel it coming, but... Kirsten, you have to tell him. That the stress of our marriage triggered my drinking? Yes. That's exactly what you say. I am not gonna use my alcoholism as blackmail to save our marriage. If he can't value it for what it is, then what is the point? Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know. The way things are between Sandy and I right now... ...I just feel like one push could send us over the edge. Yeah! Hello! Trashcans exist for a reason! - All right, let's get some more beer. - Yeah. Yeah! - This party's awesome! - Excuse me. I have a security deposit on this place. I'd like it back. Hey. So the guy at the door's gonna let me know if Volchok tries to get in. - How you doing? - I'm okay. - I think I'm just gonna go home. - Marissa, this is your prom. Yeah, it was prom before my boyfriend hooked up with another girl. Okay, I'm gonna go get a drink. Summer, it's us. How you feeling? Go away. Let me die alone. I think it's time for phase three. There's a phase three? Why didn't you mention that? There's always been a phase three. The other two were just to make you realize that you don't have a choice. You have to tell her the truth, about everything. What is she talking about? I bet you think it's really smart, because she's the smart girl. I'm gonna go. I fly back tomorrow, but I'll see you both in Providence. Summer, feel better, and remember, Seth loves you. Anna, thank you. Bye. You know what? I don't think she's that smart. I think that she is dumb. She got a dumb name and dumb hair. Listen, I don't expect you to respond or even remember this... ...bur the truth is I actually didn't get into Brown. What?! Way too fast. I knew you weren't gonna go if I didn't, and I didn't want you to do that. I didn't want you to miss the opportunity, so I broke up with you. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Then I realized I couldn't be without you. I flew there to try to talk my way in. Okay, now that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But it's very romantic. Did it work? No, it didn't. But Anna got me an interview at RISD. They read my comic book. They really like it, so... So that's why you were hugging her at the airport? Oh, my God. Listen, I know I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter... - Oh, my God, the letter. - What? Cohen, I have a confession. Wow, that's impressive. - I love you. - I love you too. We can kiss later. All right. You want me to hold your crown, Sum? - No! - All right. Hey, rigatoni. Nice. What's going on? Listen, that call I got was a friend of mine on the hospital board... ...and there are rumors floating around... ...about certain improprieties concerning Griffin and you. Monday morning, the board is gonna suspend Griffin. They're gonna call for a criminal investigation into the both of you. Neil, it's getting late. I think we should be going. Right. Kirsten, thanks for a lovely evening. My pleasure. We'll walk you out. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Well, she's not here. She must have gone home. I think she'll be okay. You know, you probably don't see it, but she's changed. She's gotten stronger. - So have you. - Yeah? Think so? The Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom. I know part of you still wants to, but you didn't. That's what matters. - So you like the new me? - Well... ...you're still not much of a dancer. - What? You're right, I'm not. You know, nothing between us could ever be casual. - There's too much history. - Yeah, I know. I don't think anything should happen tonight. - Absolutely not. Absolutely. - Okay, good. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. - Taylor, what happened? - The money is gone. I had $5000 in my purse, it's gone. I brought it down at prom. Someone must have taken it. We should call the police. Know what, don't bother. I know where it is. What do you mean you know? I'm gonna hyperventilate. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it will be. What do you want? You decide how this is gonna go. Prom, huh? Hell of a night. You probably think I'm an idiot, huh? Screw things up with Marissa... ...steal money when everyone will know I took it. I don't think about you. But, yes, you're an idiot. Or maybe it wasn't gonna work out with Marissa. And at least now... ...you and I can settle this. - I'm not here to fight you. - Sure you are. Otherwise you'd have called the police. Come on. You know you're dying to. Just give in. All right, all right. All right. I get it. It's about the money. But tell me this, a week from now, if I wanted to... ...I could have her on her back, on that mattress.
