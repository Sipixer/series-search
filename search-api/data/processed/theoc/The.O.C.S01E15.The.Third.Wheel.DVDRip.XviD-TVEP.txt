- Did she say why she was here? - She's out of money. - You can't keep living like this. So I can grow up to be like you? - He's really not my type. - What's your type? Seth Cohen? I didn't want you to be alone on New Year's. - I'm having a party. - We're not going. I'm not drinking. Doesn't mean you can't. - Clean and sober, 11 months. - Your girlfriend's at a party, alone? - Not alone, with a guy named Oliver. - You broke up. We're just not spending New Year's together. I think it's just us tonight. - She's eating us out of house and home. - It's just a bagel. No. No, no, it's never just a bagel. As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years... ...I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house. - She's got nowhere else to go. - Because her friends want to kick her ass. - Sorry about the language. - Why? I'd like to kick her ass. - Kirsten. - Coming. There's no more coffee. Will you make some? - The French roast, not the harvest blend. - No, no, no. I'll talk to her. So I'll have to survive on English muffins. Marissa? Marissa? Hello. She's gotta be here somewhere. - Hilarious. - Yeah. Okay. Listen to me. Hailey is always in the living room. Marissa's always here. I'm lost. What happened to Seth-Ryan time? That was quality time. - Okay. I know I've been a little bit... - Whipped? I'm not whipped. - I'm free to talk now. What's up? - Squeezing me in before school? Nice. But actually, I'll take it. Okay, here's the thing: Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level. I need advice. - You're gonna have sex? - No. That's a good idea, though. We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating. As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all... ...I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings. We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to... - You guys ready to go? - Yeah. We were just talking. Really? About what? Guy stuff. Hunting and shaving and shoes. Actually, the cleats for the sports. Okay, well, come on. Hey, later, can we finish this chat? Put in a little Seth-Ryan time? Yes. Absolutely, just gotta check with... Oh, you forgot your balls. - You and me. Tonight. - Come on. - Are we one of those couples? - Who lose all their friends? And can't do anything without each other? I don't think so. You think so? - That'd be good, a night apart. - Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you. I'm sick of me too. - I gotta go. - Yeah. And I got the... - Walk me? - I'll walk you. - Don't make me. - Don't make you what? - Hurt you. - Watch this. Stop it. - What's up? - Hey. What is up? - I was talking to her. - That's cool. - Do you have plans this weekend? - Nothing. What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything. We're both not. That's what we're both doing. We're doing nothing. But doing that by ourselves. Thank you, Cohen. You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook... ...because we're studying monkeys. Ouch. I hate liars, and now I'm one of them. I thought you were gonna talk to her. I am gonna talk to her. I don't know how. - I'll tell her then. - No. I have to do it. Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting. We're gonna figure out the whole thing. - That makes me feel better. - Then we'll be free to do this. - Seth. I have to study. - And this. I started my own business right out of college. And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á. - Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid? - Yeah. Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job. - Now you're an entrepreneur. - I don't even have references. Sure you do, your clients... ...whose money you stole. Right. - Is that Jimmy Cooper? - Hey, Hailey! You look fantastic. How you doing? She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects. - And I say that with love. - Sounds like we got a lot in common. - So did you guys have the talk? - Yes. We almost did. We were having fun. And all we've done is fight for so long. It was nice to just hang out and be sisters. - I'll find out if she has a plan. - You know what her plan is. She'll stay here and mooch off us... ...until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad. Then she'll take off again for a few years. - She said she wasn't gonna do that. - She's gonna mooch off us forever? - She's not mooching. - Oh, really? Then how'd she get all those new clothes? From the salary she doesn't make? From the trust fund she drained? - I bought you bagels. - That fixes everything? - Yes, it does. - Sesame. That's a start. I'm gonna hide them. So yeah. Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's. I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father. Fantastic. We've done well for ourselves. Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you... ...and you were watching Silver Spoons... ...that we'd both turn out to be so...? - Complicated. - And it was <i>Golden Girls</i>. - That's right. You loved <i>Golden Girls</i>. It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women. Blanche was 70? She aged really well. I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life. Same. Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion. No. But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash... ...and a border guard in Budapest. No. It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again. I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife. It feels like we never have any time alone anymore. That's not true. We have moments. I want more moments. - God, they're so whipped. - I gotta go pick up Marissa. - Sandy, thank you. - Anytime. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yes. Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up. - Hang out, like "out"? - I bet you have a lot to catch up on. - Tomorrow night? - Tomorrow night. Hey, man. How's it going? Got a flat tire. You ran over a nail? Somebody slashed it. Want some help? Thanks. I got a spare in the back. Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire? I'm sure he'd like to bend over. - New Year's resolution. Punch people less. - I had the same one. You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass? Definitely. Hey, why don't we just get out of here. The tire can wait. Yeah, that sounds good. Go. Go, go, go. Break that tackle. Go. Yeah! Who plays PlayStation for the sports games? Listen to me. You said Seth-Ryan time. This isn't Seth-Ryan time. This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what? Guess what. - There's no such thing. - Maybe Luke will have some good advice. What does that guy know about juggling women? Come on. Okay, quite a bit. But he wasn't good at it. He's having a bad day. I'm having a bad day, okay? I'm having a bad week. Some kids at school slashed his tires. Damn it. What do you think he wants on his pizza? Hey, Cohen. Check out the replay on this tackle. I broke this bitch in half. Luke has a gay dad. Luke has a gay dad. Can't wait to see it, buddy. - Hello? - <i>Hey.</i> I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food. I know you wanted to spend tonight apart... ...but he asked if you would come by. - You're at Oliver's? - Summer had plans. I saw Oliver at therapy. He said if I wanted... - <i>That's so good.</i> - <i>It's Moroccan.</i> - What's Moroccan? - The food. Just come. Okay? See you soon. How do you guys feel about Moroccan? I think I really hurt that guy. - Hey, where's the silverware? - Moroccan you eat with your hands. No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much. - How good is the couscous? - Amazing. - It's pretty good. - No, that's the kefta. Couscous is the other thing. I can't believe you live in a penthouse. This place is "ridonculous." It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel. Like Eloise. Yeah, well, I guess. But with my parents traveling so much... ...it can get a little Ionely. - Lf you ever need any company... - Thanks. They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris. I love Paris. I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes. I like Paris. I love baguettes. Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits. - Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan? - No, not yet. - I hear the Louvre's cool. - Do not go near it. Totally overrated. The <i>Mona Lisa</i>'s the size of a postage stamp. Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso... But you know where my family's been spending most of their time? Switzerland. - Snowboarding the Alps is unreal. - You boarded the Alps? The closest I've ever come is Whistler. We have a place in Big Bear. We should go one weekend. - Could you teach Ryan to board? - Lf you can get him on a chair lift. First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there. - I really like this song. - You know, they're playing tomorrow. - Yeah, but it's all sold out. - Do you wanna go? Yeah, but it's all sold out. I'll call their manager tomorrow. They're amazing live. - You know Rooney? - That would be awesome. I've never heard of them, but I got nothing. I'll go. Ryan? - Come on, we'll all get to hang out. - It'll be fun. - Cool. - All right, then it's settled. We're going. - Groovy. - Hey, nice. This is gonna be great. So now you're eating with silverware? Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre. No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame. Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second? Okay? Summer. The way I figure it, I have many options. Like the truth. That's a good one. Hey, no argument there, buddy... ...but I'm talking about my messenger of truth. My delivery system of honesty. The way I tell her. - Now, listen. I could call her. That's one. - Okay. It is okay, but just okay. It lacks any real spark or imagination. But it's effective. Your voice on one end, hers on the other. - "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you. - But the phone is a blunt instrument, no? What about text messaging? I could Blackberry her. That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century. - Kind of cold. - Mittens required, yes. A carrier pigeon. How cool would that be? Think about it. A little message in his cute little talons. Summer's a pigeon fan. - You're a coward. - Am I? Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others? Coward, definitely. Fine, I'll tell her Monday. Actually, I think Tuesday. I might give it till Friday. That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate... - You could do it today. - No. Today will soon be tonight. And tonight will be Rooney. And Rooney will be awesome. Rooney. I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year. - Big whoop. We're seeing them tonight. - I thought it was sold out. It happens they are. But I also happen to be dialed in. I got the hookups. Or at least Oliver does. And I'm gonna ride his coattails. Oliver? As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's? - Morning, Hailey. - It's not like that. He's got a girlfriend. Wait. If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours? - Couldn't tell you, but thanks. - The guy seems cool, right? I don't know. We don't seem to have a lot in common. - Besides your girlfriend. - Keep twisting the knife. Feels good. Whatever. He got us backstage passes. Good enough for me. Backstage? So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars? Mind if I finish cornflakes? Hey, at least she asked. It's a start. Well, at least she's leaving the house. It's a start. - We'll have the place to ourselves. - Yes. We can eat bagels. - And I can wear my robe. - Or not. I can have the remote back. She's crammed that TiVo full of every <i>E! True Hollywood</i> special. - I think she's looking for tips. - That's nice. I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo. And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind. Are we okay with the kids going to that concert? - Yeah. - What if Rooney is, like... ...death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks? Honey, that went out in the late '90s. I saw it on a special on E! I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey. So? - Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so... - That's why we're doing a run-through. - So you'll have heard it all before tonight. - Right. - So we're going tonight? - No. It's your first concert. We have free tickets, backstage passes. You're right, we should skip it. - That's not what I'm saying. - What are you saying? - Have you met Natalie? - No, but I hear she's great. - And Oliver is...? I mean... - Is someone jealous? This song is good. Turn it up. Really, really loud. Oliver will be with Natalie. Rooney is a really good band. - And tonight we're gonna have fun. - I know. - There won't be dancing, right? - I'll dance. You can watch. Works for me. - I think that's enough. - What? There was almost a knee bend. You were about to find the beat. - And? - Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah? You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor. That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement. - I'm just trying to spare casualties. - So anyone gonna be doing drugs? I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert. Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs? No. Nobody named Seth Cohen. I promise. Gotta stay sharp. It's my first date with Anna. It is? So you and Summer finally had the talk? Oh, yes, almost several times. - Seth. - Father. The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything. See, I don't really believe that. I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great. The best advice I can give you is this. It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film <i>Hard to Kill.</i> "The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself." Great. So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me. Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone... ...if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship... ...you are old enough to be a man. Well, she's not gonna be there tonight... ...so I'll tell her Monday. - Good. Now, get going. Your mother and I want some time alone. There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight. Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her. - I don't see him. - Maybe he's inside. - Excuse me, are you on the list? - Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask. - Who's Oliver Trask? - You don't have his name? No, I don't have his name. I've never heard it. That's why I'm asking. - Thanks, you've been very helpful. - I'll call him and see where he is. - A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen? - Yeah. Good job, Luke. That should help make us a lot of friends. - Damn it. - What? Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon. If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song. They only have one album. Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs. Oh, no. But, hey. I mean, come on. If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight. - Right? - What are we gonna do? I hope you guys aren't waiting for me. - Summer. - Cohen. - Hey, Anna. - Summer. - Who are you talking to? - It just goes straight to voice mail. Dude, look at that freak. Hey, I drove alone. Will you ride with me? You want to give up so early? Maybe I can grease a few palms. Hey. - There you are. - What's up, man? - Hi. - I thought you were a no-show. - What happened? I said back door. - No, you didn't. - Load in here, guys. - The band's here. - It's all happening. - What up, guys? Robert, how's it going? Good to see you. Looking forward to the show. - Thank you. - I guess we're on time. - Which one's Rooney? - They're all Rooney. - Hey, man, this is my posse. - This is crazy. - Hey. So where's Natalie? - Yeah, we had another fight. This whole long-distance thing's tough. Looks like I'm dateless tonight. Hey, no! No way. We'll be your date, right? Yeah, right. - So should we fire up the hot tub? - Interesting. Open a bottle of wine. Oh, I like it. First, TiVo. I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs. - Hot pizza? - Hailey. Hey, guys. You're just in time. Doctor. Doctor. - James. - What's up? I just thought that you were going out tonight. We were. But then I found out there's a <i>Golden Girls</i> marathon on Lifetime. And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games. We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days. - Why don't you guys join us? - Great. That would be great. Oh, I love this episode. This is the one where Rose adopts the pig. She adopted the pig? - Do you play? - A little. - Here, man. - All access? Sweet. - Hey, it's cool? - It's cool. - Hey, check it out. - Seriously? Yeah. Awesome. I just got a few songs that I wrote. Okay, I'm just gonna... Seth, you have to tell her tonight. - No, I don't. - Hey. - Here you go. - Thank you. - So, Luke, he's... - Yeah, we don't let him out much. Yeah. But you guys are cool, having fun? - Everything's awesome. - Glad to hear it. Yeah. Everything is not awesome. If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her... ...she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney. That will cheer her up. There's never gonna be a good time to tell her. Tonight's not a bad night. There's a lot of guys here. Cute guys, older guys. A lot of musicians. Girls like musicians. Maybe you're right. Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care? I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy. - Right. - Are you checking out dudes again? No. But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there? A lot of musicians. In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself. Why don't you and Seth talk. You know, about anything. - Cohen, you and Anna...? - Me and Anna what? What? Will you guys stand with me at the concert? Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so... Okay, that would be nice. Yeah. Hey, man. I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago. No. Okay, no excuses. I don't care who you send. Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick. All right. I can't see. I'm stuck behind a row of giants. Come with me. Okay, lead the way. Sorry. Hey. Did you tell her? What did she say? Did she leave? No. Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends. - Seth said you were thirsty. - Yeah. You are thirsty, aren't you? - <i>You suck.</i> - <i>I'm sorry.</i> - I gotta pee. You gotta pee? - I'll come with you. I'm telling her. You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs? And we flushed all that beer down the toilet. - A lot of good that did. - I know. Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles. - I thought you were sleeping. - Face it, sister. Everything I know, I learned from you. You were a bad influence back in the day. How do you think I learned to piss off Dad? - The student becomes the master. - And the master becomes Dad's slave. Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage. Hey, Connect Four! Congratulations. Next Saturday, Yahtzee. No, wait. Stay. Battleship? Uno? You know, Sandy's right. It's late. And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning. Just what Orange County needs. Another show home. Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky... The one on the bluff, that's a great house. If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one. - Oh, nice. Hailey, nice. - I was kidding. - I'm laughing on the inside. - I'm not. You're living in our home. You're insulting my wife. You're driving my whole family crazy. - Is this true? - Yeah. And we all know what you're doing here. She didn't mean anything. It's just sisters. No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick. It's a routine. And it's tired. You know who's tired? Me. So why don't we stop. No, stop protecting her. You're not even nice to Kirsten. She's the only reason we put up with you. Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay? - Sorry? - It's not your fault, Jimmy. No, I meant the board game. - You like <i>The Golden Girls</i>? - Yes. There's a marathon on. I can't get the song out of my head. I love <i>The Golden Girls.</i> It's not Rose's fault. She just is that way. You're Rose? I'm Blanche. It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but... How good was the episode when there was a blackout? How about when Rose adopts the pig? Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby. It's so funny. Jimmy, wait. Sorry about that in there. My little tantrum. Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister. It always has been. You gotta go, like, right now? Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person. And so I have to... Yeah. No, Marissa's at a concert. Yep, nothing but time. Didn't tonight feel like the good old days? No. It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days. - Right. That too. - Yeah. Look, the good old days. They're exactly that. Would you really want to be back in high school? - Yeah. - Yeah. I would too. - And you think I'm pathetic? - Yes, I do. It's sad, really. I always had a crush on you. You know that? No. You were 8 when I went away to college. So I wasn't... You're Kirsten's sister. So I've heard all my life. Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation... ...even more complicated, right? The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us. Unless that's what you're hoping for. Look, your sister is amazing... ...and Sandy is such a great guy. I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you. I know that I am. I'm gonna go. Okay. - Hi. I'm gonna... - Hey, this is great, right? Perfect. Come here a second. - What are we doing? - This is better. Wait. But we're missing the concert. We can't ditch Oliver. - Oliver's fine. He's friends with the band. - And with us. I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends. You've known him two weeks. How good a friend can he be? Look. He's in recovery, trying to stay clean. We can talk about stuff. He tells me things. What he's going through. - Unlike me, right? - I didn't say that. I know you didn't want to come here tonight... ...so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave... Right. Later. Hey, Luke. - You know who sings this song? - Rooney. - Rooney! - We should keep it that way. Yeah, Rooney! What the hell, man?! Get off me! - Hey, get off him! - I'm a cop. - What? There's gotta be some mistake. - Yeah. His. He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me. Ryan, go back inside. Don't tell anybody. Excuse me, barkeep, sir. - Hey. - What can I get you? How did you do that? The usual. - Mountain Dew. - How many? Unfortunately, three. So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple. When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna. Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother. Good, because I need your keys and phone. - Yeah, you okay? - I'm fine. It's Oliver. - What? What's going on? - Tell you later? All right. You'll miss a hell of a show, though. Rooney's not bad, either. - Is Jimmy gone? - Yeah. Is she all right? I knocked. She didn't answer. Maybe she's giving us the house back. Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning. And frankly... ...I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else. You can't keep her here forever. It's no good for her and it's no good for us. Hello? Hey, what's wrong? Where are you? I'll be right there. Ryan's at the police station. Thank you, Newport Beach. Good night, everybody. - Seth. - Hey. - Where have you been? - At the bar. How was it? It was amazing. They played the whole album. Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer? Did you tell her? Tell me what? So you're a couple? - No. - Yes. We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are. - So you chose Anna? - No. Kind of, yeah. She came over on New Year's Eve. You were with me on New Year's Eve. Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember? And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did. I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway. You know how it goes. Okay, well, congrats. You're not mad? Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way. Well, Anna, I have to say... ...that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche. I know. I'm sorry. Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so... So can we still all hang out? Will you be cool with that? We'd both really like that if we could hang out. Sure. You guys, we can totally hang out. I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now? So they're gonna let him go. - Really? How'd you do that? - I'm just that good. - I used to play poker with these guys. - Thanks for doing this. - You didn't have to, really. - Is this kid a friend of yours? He's a friend of Marissa's. They met in therapy. He said he's been clean a while, but... They busted him trying to buy coke. Then he said his parents are away for a month. Can you believe that? A parent leaves a kid like that on his own. Yeah, imagine that. - I'll never understand it. - I hope not. - I'm glad you called me. - Me too. I'm gonna finish up your paperwork. You sit tight. I'll be right back. So thanks. Seth's dad seems cool. He is. So why'd you do this for me? I mean, you don't even like me, man. I don't really know you. Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either. - So, what happened? - I don't know. Natalie didn't show. And then I saw you and Marissa. Your friends. Then it hit me. I have no one. My parents are gone. My friends, if you can even call them that... ...they all disappeared when I got clean. Now I... There's Marissa. Seth likes your taste in music. And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point. And what about you? I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail. No, that was Sandy. Marissa. You gonna tell her? No. You are. Hey. Yeah, it's Oliver. Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey! - I can't have half? - There are other bagels. - Not salt bagels. - You ate them all. And several sesame. I haven't been the best guest, I know. - And what you said tonight... - Hey, Connect Four was happening. It gets my blood up. Well, you were right. So, what's the plan? Hit Caleb up for more cash. And then what? - Europe this time? Iceland? Boca? - I don't know. You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?" - Because you don't want it. - How do you know? I don't even know what I want. You could stay here. I mean, not here exactly... ...but, you know, get a home. - A job. Settle down. - No. See, that's the thing. All I know is what I don't want. Well, that's not entirely true. And the rest... ...you'll figure out. Good night. Good night. - Hey. - Hey. No, wait, don't get up. Thanks. He's not a bad guy, Oliver. He's... This may come as a shock to you... ...but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver. Oh, hey, wow, kissing. Sorry about that. We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together... ...so do that. - Ryan, what happened to you? - Luke, please, you're shouting. - Someone stood too close to the speaker. - Dude, that concert did not suck at all. - We PlayStationing it, or what? - Yeah. Any time you want to join us. Let's go before he wakes up your parents. Think we can teach him to fetch? I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy. - Well, we could stay here. - Yeah, but maybe we should... Race you? Cohen, you've played this game before? See the way I ripped that guy's spine out? Sitting right here, buddy. I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys? - Yeah. - Damn it.
