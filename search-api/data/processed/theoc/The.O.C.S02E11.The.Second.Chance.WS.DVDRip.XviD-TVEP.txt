-Rebecca Bloom? Love of your life? -Will you come? -Lindsay asked me to be the buffer. -Grandpa hates you. -What is it that the two of you want? -Money? -What? -Cohen's gonna do his own comic. -They're good. -Yeah? -The boobs are a little big. Aren't they? Summer and I may be taking a step forward. Aren't you sick of me? We've hung out every day this week. -You're still in love with her. -She's dead. Rebecca. -You're up early. -I'm studying for this test. That's great. I was actually on my way out to talk. -Studying. -Fine. We can talk here. The issue feels a little more pool house-y. -ls this about Alex? -No, no. She's merely kitchen-table fodder at this point, no longer up to pool-house snuff. -So it's Summer and Zach. -Yes. Which I realize is... ...more of an evening subject best served over a game of PlayStation. -I'll allow it. -Great. Thanks a lot. So the three of us are moving forward with this comic book. -Right. So? -Summer and I are getting involved... ...professionally. You know how these things go. Late nights at the office.... -You don't have an office. -Sure. But with the added stress of work and deadlines, things can get sexy. -You're writing a comic book. Not sexy. -You think I'm reaching. I think you're moving on with Alex and Summer. For the first time, you're not facing any women issues. So I'm complaining that I have nothing to complain about? This is what I'm saying. Okay, great. Then I will await the next great romance to wreak havoc on my heart and mind. I can hardly wait. -Hi. -Well, you're up early. -Are you sneaking in after curfew? -Busted. -Am I grounded? -Perhaps if I let you off... ...you'll remember this act of kindness and afford me the same leniency... ...should I miss my own curfew. -Keep dreaming. -lt was worth a shot. You're home. -I was worried about you. -I'm okay. I was just beat. How did Professor Bloom take the news about Rebecca? -How do you think he took it? -I can only imagine. His only daughter, and now she's gone. He didn't even get to see her. -Hello. -Hey, Sandy. Rebecca. -Yeah. -Listen, I'm at the pier. -Want me to grab you some coffee? -No, no. Nine is fine. I'll see you then. Okay. It's gonna be a little hectic for a while. Well, you should try and get some sleep. You look exhausted. -You're up and about early. -Test. Not ready. -Don't miss those days. -Oh, thanks. -How's school? Life? -Yeah, pretty good. The usual. -You and Lindsay? -We're good. You know, we're good. There was definite hesitation. No, no. I'm just studying. Ryan, whatever you did, it can be undone. Candies, flowers, work miracles. Actually, it's not something I did. Thanks for your confidence. It's.... -It's your dad. -The one man impervious to miracles. -What happened? -Well, Lindsay reached out to him. Or I did for her. There was a meal. Or there was supposed to be a meal. -We went to a restaurant. -Poor girl. What did he say? He didn't actually take out his checkbook. He thought she wanted money? He must've got her confused with my other sister. -Or his wife. -I'm not the biggest fan of your dad. But I mean, Luke Skywalker was happy to have a dad... ...even if he was Darth Vader. You're right. She needs a dad. I'll handle this. There's gonna be another meal. Here. And actual food will be eaten. And I'll make sure that he behaves. Did we really drink that much last night? We drank that much here. Who knew Harbor chicks could throw down. Yeah, well, I'm not like the other girls. Then it's time I show you the meth lab in the basement. I thought you'd never ask. So I guess you have to go to school. Say hi to Seth for me. I kind of miss his little chicken arms. What's he been up to? He hasn't bugged me for a while. I don't know. But I was kind of thinking of skipping school. How much is there to learn about the Aztecs anyway? -Nothing, really. -That's exactly what I was thinking. So, what do you wanna do? -Well, you ready for that surf lesson? -Y es. Awesome. Let me just jump in the shower, if that's okay. Wait. Do you have a shirt I can borrow? This one kind of smells like cigarettes. So who would've thought Sandy Cohen would be living in Newport Beach... -...surrounded by all these surfers. -It's been 22 years. You say that like it's a long time. -So you have two kids, huh? -Yeah. Who'd you end up marrying? Wait, let me guess. Left-wing radical from Long lsland. Reformed. Yep. That's it. Not even close. Rich. Conservative. Presbyterian. She grew up right, well, here basically. Blond. Blue eyes. Cute little nose. Like a button. You're full of surprises. How'd she take the news about my return? Well, I haven't told her yet. I don't want her to be considered an accomplice. -What with my harboring a fugitive. -Yeah, that I am. So, what about you? Are you married? You got those five kids you always wanted to have? Not even close. I haven't met anybody since you. It's hard to meet people when you can't let anybody know who you really are... ...and you can't stay in one place too long. -I see how that might salt your game. -"Salt my game"? Is that how they talk in Orange County? Stick around, you'll be saying "rad" in no time. Yeah, except I'm not staying. I figured l'd... ...hang out in my lovely accommodations at the fleabag inn... ...for another 48 hours. Spend this time with my dad. Then disappear. -You're leaving? -How can I stay? As you said yourself, I'm a fugitive. The feds are looking for me. I don't wanna get you in any trouble. Does your dad know you're leaving so soon? I was hoping you'd help me out with that. Hey there. -So, what do you want for dinner? -Why? Are you inviting me over? -Kirsten is. -Great. -So who's it gonna be with? -You know. Me, you, Kirsten, Caleb. Caleb. -Caleb. -Why? One horrible dining experience wasn't enough? Kirsten just feels bad about what happened at our dinner. -You told her. -She wants to help. Well, I don't want her help. I don't want your help. And I definitely don't wanna dine with Caleb. All right, look, Luke Skywalker was happy to find his dad, right? Even if he turned out to be Darth Vader. Ryan, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader fought each other with lightsabers... ...until one of them died. Vader cut off Skywalker's hand. -When you put it that way.... -Look, just don't worry about my family. Or our family, whatever they are. -Just let it be, okay? -All right. Kirsten. What a pleasure to see you in my office. You know, that Y ogalates or Cardio Barre... ...whatever it is you've been up to, is working wonders on you. And that top, it's so fetching. Fetching? Are you done? Done complimenting my beautiful daughter on how beautiful she is? Dad. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to have dinner with me, Lindsay and Ryan. I need you to not be the world's biggest ass. -What are you talking about? -You accused her of wanting money. Not that you've viewed that as a flaw before. Well, she turned up with that lnland street thug. Dad, listen up. Ryan, the assumed street thug, has been living with us for a year and a half now. He is a brother to Seth, and a son to me and Sandy. I still question his motives. I'm just protective of my family. This girl wants to know her father. She wants to get to know you. Now, tonight you are gonna show up for dinner. You're gonna be a real dad to this girl or you're gonna lose two daughters. Got it? Dad, I can't stay. I'm already endangering you and Sandy. Oh, I see. So I'm gonna lose you all over again. -We really don't have a choice. -Of course we do. -The choice we always had. -I'm not turning myself in. Know how long it would be before I got to court? We'd have no time. All I want is to see you clear your name, to get your life back. That'll be hard, considering what happened. Except it didn't happen, Sandy. Tell him, Rebecca. -Tell me what? -Okay. That night, I never showed. I got scared. Zukowski had to go it alone. I knew it. -Why'd you run? -I panicked. I knew if I got caught I'd have to testify against my friends. You could defend her. You could clear her. We can't ask him to put himself at risk. -He has a family now. -No, wait, wait. Before you left, we were his family. Sandy, please, I am begging you. Give my daughter her life back. -Hey. -Hey. Is that Marissa? Yeah, or as I like to call her, Cosmo Girl. With a passion for fashion and a magic flask. Alcoholism as a superpower. Well, that is an interesting take. You must think Marissa is hot. You won't draw me short and stumpy, will you? -To punish me for not liking you. -This is kind of my concern. -You and me and the artistic process. -What about it? Well, you and I have a history. I'm a little concerned... ...that it's gonna compromise my vision. Are you writing me out? I'll compromise your vision. Don't forget my rage blackouts. -I haven't. it's part of your powers. -Really? -It's very Hulk-like. -I'm not gonna turn green, am l? This is your way to make me rip off all my clothes. That there, that's our history affecting the work. Are you forgetting about our third partner, Zach? Superhero nickname, The Boyfriend. Has the power to make me forget you. I'm just saying: High stress. Late nights. Close quarters. I hope it doesn't, but, I don't know, it could get weird. -You think? -Well.... -Hey, guys! I got great news. -Hey. My dad has an intern whose uncle works at Wildstorm. -Really? -What's Wildstorm? Unbelievable comic-book company. I pitched them the shape of the idea. -Zach, we don't really have-- -They love the world of Orange County. They think it could be hot. If they like the artwork, they might wanna set up a meeting. -All right. -So get ready, man. Late nights. High stress. Close quarters. -Oh, and, Cohen. You gotta nail Summer. -What? -Excuse me? -I pitched Little Ms. Vixen... ...with her bag full of killer credit cards. They loved her. -They did? They love me. -Yeah. Okay. We gotta lock down her likeness. Start drawing her right away. -Okay. -Like, tonight. So I'll be posing for Cohen tonight? -That's fine. -This is gonna be great. -Great. -So great. -Hey. -Hey. We're not having a party, are we? One never knows. No, it's just dinner. With my dad. Don't worry. You're not invited. Well, good. I should probably get back to the office anyway. Okay. -Are you working with Max? -Yeah. -What's there left to do? -Everything. What if I told you he wants me to clear Rebecca, prove she was innocent? I would think that would be wonderful. -You would? -The man's daughter died. If you can't bring his daughter back, at least you can clear her name. I knew you'd understand. Why aren't you dressed? Is Lindsay here? -Lindsay isn't coming. -Why? -Because Caleb's coming. -I know. That was the idea. -Get her. -I'm in the middle enough. Didn't you use Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader thing? -She poked a hole in that analogy. -My father is on his way. If Lindsay doesn't show up, we'll be having dinner with him alone. That's a good point. I just don't think there's anything I can say. Maybe you're right. Forks on the left. Soup spoons on the right. -What's this? -Oh, it's something Seth drew. It's a demon water-polo player, I guess. He left it here. Maybe in 1 0 years I'll sell it on eBay or something. -So, what's the deal with you guys? -We never really left the ground. We taxied down the runway but never achieved liftoff. Y eah, I just got out of one of those. Y eah, they're good for getting over someone, I guess. Or getting you ready for someone. Hey, can I crash at your place again? Anything to avoid hanging out with my stepdad. Works for me. But.... -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. What are you doing with me? Picking up a pint of Cherry Garcia and renting some DVDs? I mean, sleeping over, hanging out all the time, borrowing my clothes. Things that never happened with Seth, and I was dating him. Well, Seth's not really your size. No. But he was, however briefly, my boyfriend. Maybe you're right. I should probably sleep at home anyway. -I'm out of fresh clothes as it is. -Okay. Oh, and I'll wash this shirt, get it back to you. No. Don't worry about it. I'm almost done practicing, Mom. Not your mom. Your sister. -I didn't know you played the oboe. -Oh, not well. I just started practicing again. -Well, it sounds great. What was that? -lt was Brahms, an orchestral piece. -You know who likes Brahms? -Yeah, I am not going to dinner. Even if Caleb is a huge fan of the oboe. Look, no one has been more thoroughly crushed by our dad than me. -Hey, now there's a club I wanna join. -He's got a lot of issues. He's not the easiest guy in the world to get along with. But once you figure him out, he's really a good guy. -Really? -I don't know. I've never been able to figure him out. But maybe we can try... ...together. Well, it's not much. But the couch is pretty comfy. We got air conditioning. Well, we don't, but we have windows. -Carpeting. Very lush. -It's private. -The price, you can't beat it. -It's great. It's perfect. It'll be fine for the next 48 hours. It might take me a little longer than that to figure out how to take on your case. You are? You will? Thank you. I mean.... Thanks. I know I said I didn't want your help... -...but I kind of did. -I kind of knew that. So.... -Have you told your wife yet? -No. -Sandy? -She can't know anything yet. Not until we get this sorted out. I don't like it... ...but it's the best thing for her. Okay, that's your decision. My dad's gonna be thrilled. -We should celebrate. -Yeah, I'll go rent out Chuck E. Cheese. I know we can't go out, but we could order in Mexican. Grab a bottle of tequila. -Still like Patron? -Yeah. Yeah? Smoke a little weed? Cool. Yeah, while I'm harboring a fugitive, I'll go and score some pot off the street. Never leave home without it. Happen to have a bong handy? Not these days, no. My son, Seth, is.... He's quite the detective. If my memory serves... ...Sandy Cohen could turn just about anything into a pipe. Soda can. Apple. Do we get to listen to the Allman Brothers? Depends if you've got an apple. Let's just stick to the tequila. -Hello. -Come in. All right. Hey. Nice to see you dress up for the occasion. Oh, yes. -Ready? -Yeah, just a second. All right. Oh, my God. What? It's my costume. I told you I had wardrobe approval. If it was up to you, I'd wear shredded purple jeans and pasties. -No, this is better. This is much better. -Okay, come on. Let's be professional. Less drooling, more drawing. And don't give me any junk in the trunk either. It's just the gifts God gave you. You think you could maybe turn, like, 40 degrees? But keep your face tilted towards the light. -And then hold your arms akimbo. -A-what-bo? Here. Just like this. Okay, look. Chest out a little bit. This way. And kind of turn your face out this way a little bit. -Wait. There's just one.... -What...? Hold on. Okay. Are your greasy paws done manhandling me? Yeah. You look good. -Did you just draw that? Like, now? -You just stepped out of the light. You know, I wish I could draw. But every time I try to draw a person... ...it's just one big head with legs coming out of its chin. Yeah. Look how you're holding that pencil. You're choking it. I am not. This pencil can breathe. The guy with no neck can't. -Loosen up a little bit. All right. -Okay. -Just take it nice and easy. -Yeah. Picasso said: "First, you have to be able to draw a straight line. " Right. I think I've got all the angles I need. I can do the rest from memory. Yeah, good. Because my costume's starting to ride me. Excellent. I'll come back for Princess Sparkle later. Okay. Okay. This is the best meal you ever cooked, Kiki. It's fondue, Dad. Cheese pot. Not so difficult. Did you know that Lindsay plays the oboe? Not well. Do you now? -Do you play any Brahms? -I try. Did you know that Dad has box seats at the Hollywood Bowl? -Have you ever been? -No. I heard it's amazing. -The tickets are yours. -Great. Ryan, what do you think? A little Esa-Pekka, a little Y o-Y o Ma? I don't think Ryan would be interested. Dad. I'm just saying. A boy like Ryan would get bored with a show like that. -Because they don't have music in Chino. -It's fine. Just let him insult me. I didn't mean to insult you. I just had no idea you were a classical-music fan. What's your favorite Brahms concerto? -Ryan, I'm so sorry. -No, it's fine. I'm just gonna go. This was supposed to be about Lindsay and Caleb making up for lost time. -What are you insinuating? -You guys have a lot to catch up on. I'd hate to see you waste all your time insulting me. -Ryan, stay. -Y es, Ryan. Stay. As long as you like. Living in this house, eating our food. Dating our children. Butting in to our affairs. -You are so out of line. -What? I've forgiven him for burning down my model home... ...teaching my grandson to steal cars... ...and for starting a brawl at my Man of the Y ear party. Everyone seems to have forgotten he impregnated a girl. Something you might know about. Except I didn't pay her off to stay quiet. -What did you say to me? -I'm just telling you the truth. You can hide from Lindsay, make this about me-- -I've had enough. -I'm just getting started. Let me tell you, if you've come here for a fight-- Ryan, don't. Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, my God! Call 91 1! Dad! -That's the last time I try cooking. -I'm starving. There's gotta be a vending machine to raid around here. -I'd love some coffee. -Let me get that. Hey, Lindsay, you wanna come? I'll stay here. I'm here. I'm sorry. Not that I haven't wished it on him, but how's he doing? Haven't heard yet. I was worried about you. -Oh, l-- I was working late. -Have you been drinking? -Kirsten Cohen? -Yes. I'm Dr. Lasser. I was with your father all night. -Let me say he's gonna be okay. -Oh, thank God. He did, however, suffer a mild heart attack. We'll run some tests, keep him a day or two. Nothing to worry about. -Can we see him? -Well, visits are restricted to family. -I'm his daughter. -Then right this way. -Are you coming? -ln a second. I was thinking, you around my dad right now-- Not the best for his blood pressure. -Probably not. -I understand. I got plenty of work to do, but I'll stay if you want me to. -I have Lindsay, Ryan and Seth. -Right. Oh, my God. You almost kissed him? -Shouldn't you be at the hospital? -Whatever. It's just Caleb. Ryan said he'll be fine. Besides, he's like a cockroach, you know? He'll outlive us all. -Again. You almost kissed Cohen? -lt was not an almost kiss. -lt was a nose graze. Totally different. -Not totally. Sometimes you can just have, like, a moment with someone. You know, when you're doing something totally random... ...and it's just, like, charged or something. -Who have you been nose-grazing with? -What? No one. I just mean.... -Do you know what I mean? -Even if you're dating a hot guy... ...that likes you, you can still get flustered by a bobble-headed geek... -...in size 27 jeans. -Yeah. What is that? -I don't know. -What are you supposed to do? I think it depends on who the person is. If it's Cohen, well, I think you need to use... ...all your weapons in your designer handbag to defend yourself. If it's a normal person, you go for it. What if it's someone whose nose you never thought you'd graze? Do you mean like Princess Sparkle? You are young, you are single and you have a cute nose. So why not put it out there? Are you comfortable? Do you need anything from home? -Slippers? Robe? -No, no. I'm fine. Thanks. Actually, I've never been better. Are you on morphine? I owe you both a huge apology. It's a shame it took a coronary to realize how terrible I've been. -I've been terrible. -It's okay. It's not okay. But now that I've got a second chance, well.... I'd like a second chance. Can we start over? Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't even think I liked you... ...until I thought I lost you. Does that mean you forgive me? Okay. Y eah. -Am I going to jail? -Not necessarily. But clearing your name is probably impossible. It's not gonna be easy. I'd like to explore some kind of amnesty... ...a plea bargain to keep you out of jail so you can be with your dad. Yeah. That's what's important here. -What can we do? -I need a statement of fact. Your story. Then we can track down any witnesses who can corroborate the truth. But first... ...I gotta call my wife. Excuse me. Hey, baby, it's me. Oh, I was hoping you'd be there. I guess we'll catch up back at the ranch for dinner. Call me if you need anything. I love you. Maybe you should be with your family, your wife, given everything.... Oh, it's okay. I don't think she really wants me there. Her father and I don't exactly get along so well. -You sure? -Yeah. The sooner we get started.... The sooner I'm out of your life, and you have yours back. Oh, it's not like that. Yeah, it is. Go home to your wife. We'll work on this in the morning. Hey. -These are probably pretty cold by now. -Thanks. I was gonna go and give them to you guys, but I didn't wanna interrupt. -Where's Seth? -He went home. -To shower, do some work. -Why didn't you go? Well, I just figured I'd stay here. Least I could do. Ryan, nobody blames you for this. Really. -Hey. What's going on? -Hey. I just came by to give you this. It might be worth a lot of money someday. -Nice house. -Thanks. It's good for weekends and, you know, vacations. So you seeing anyone? Multiple people, perhaps? Female? Life partner? -Seth. -That's a legitimate question. Don't make me hurt you in your nice house. Well, you know what, you hurt me enough already, so.... Come on. I didn't hurt you. It was never that kind of thing. Well, I remember you scratching my cornea really bad. And bending my arm in ways it's not supposed to bend. You know what I mean. We were each other's in-between people, you know. You helped me get over Jody, and I helped you get over... ...Summer. It's kind of cool, actually. We helped get each other ready for what's next. Well, good luck with that. Good luck with Summer. Look at this. Well, I figured you could use a home-cooked meal. It's grilled salmon in a raspberry coulis reduction. -My favorite. -I know. My hero. -You shaved. -Well, I clean up nice. So you've been working hard. It's good you got the new office. -How do you like it? -Well.... It's rough around the edges. It's just my style. If you'll be spending a lot of time there, spruce it up. I like it un-spruced. Well, while you are whipping up a culinary miracle... ...I'm gonna go and pick up some things for my dad. -I love you. -I love you. -Hey. -Hey. -Cohen. -Summer. You.... -So I've been-- -Yeah, I've been thinking. -Sorry. Go. -No, no. -You go first. -Yes, okay. I'll go. I'm not happy... ...with the shadings on my sketches. I'm glad to hear that. Because I've made modifications to my costume. -And Princess Sparkle now has a cape. -Nice touch. Fantastic. I always say, every four-legged sidekick, they need a cape. -Y es. -I always say that. Yeah. Good. -Do you need to draw me again? -No. That's not necessary. That is not necessary. I've got your image. -It's just seared in my memory. -Good. I think. I look forward to seeing what you come up with. Here's the thing. I just think that the best way for us to maintain a professional relationship-- -ls to spend very little time together? -Yes, exactly. -Good. -It's perfect. -Who's ready for a road trip? -What? I talked to the guy at Wildstorm. He loved your drawings. I set up a meeting. We're going to San Diego. Just the three of us. -Great. -That's great. -This is my fault. -No. It's no one's fault. I think Caleb has changed. He really wants... ...a relationship with me. That's great. -Yeah, it is. -Yeah. It's just.... -I think that's gonna be pretty hard.... -lf I'm around. Yeah, I know. Look, I know that he's gonna like you. I mean, how could he not? I just think that it's gonna take some time. -And he needs me now. -Yeah, we'll take some time off. -It's not like we haven't done it before. -First Kirsten, now my dad. You don't want a relationship with Julie Cooper, do you? -I don't think we'd see each other. -Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Look.... I know what it's like... ...not having a dad. -I get it. -Thanks. Bye. -Hello? -Hey, it's me. -I'm just making sure you're okay. -Yeah. I was just getting ready to sack out on the couch. All right. I'll see you in the morning, and we'll figure this out. With you leading the charge, I have no doubt. -Good night. -Good night. Thank you. -Hello? -Oh, hey, sweetie. It's Mom. -Hey. How's Grandpa? -He's okay. I just saw him. Is your dad around? Hang on. Let me check. Dad? -I have no idea where he is right now. -Okay. Well, I'm gonna drop a few things off at his office. It needs some sprucing up. -Did you say "sprucing"? -Yes, I did indeed. All right. If he and I cross paths, is there anything you want me to tell him? No, I want it to be a surprise. Just let him know that I'll be home in a few minutes. All right, I can do that. Bye-bye. Yeah? -Hey. -Hey. -We could use help setting the table. -All right. -Who called? -Oh, it was Mom. -Oh, yeah? What'd she say?
