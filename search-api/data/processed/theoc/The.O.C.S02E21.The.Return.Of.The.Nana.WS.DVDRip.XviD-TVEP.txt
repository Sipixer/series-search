A little too much lndian spirit, huh? Well, drive back in the morning. I need to go home. The nana's not nice. I love her, but she's not. I hate this state! I hate the sunshine! I hate the ocean! I hate Schwarzenegger! I don't believe it, Ryan. Bright Eyes has two albums in the top 1 0. -You okay with that? -Yeah. I just feel like the rest of the world's finally caught up to me. -It's a little bit scary. -Yeah, it's a lot scary. Tell me I'm still special. -Hello? -Setheleh. Nanaleh. How you feeling? Well, if you were all that interested, you would've called me. And would it kill you to cash that birthday check I sent you? -I'm finished sending you things. -Okay. I' m sorry. I forgot. -Make my life very difficult. -No, l' m sure that $20 outstanding... -... has the bank just going crazy. -Smart ass. Where's your father? -I don't know-- -Who is it, Seth? Actually, my mom came in if you wanna talk to her. -It's the nana. -No. What do you want me--? Hello. My dad just showed up. Awkward family moment avoided for everyone but me. -Love you. -You could've fooled me. It's the nana. -Ma. Hey. How are you? -He gets so much louder... -...when he talks to her. -They're a family of screamers. -How's the grandma feeling? -The nana, Ryan. "Grandma" evokes homemade cookies and knitting. -Someone who's actually nice to you. -The nana? Definitely not nice to us. -But she's doing great. -Which confirms my suspicion... ...that she is, in fact, immortal. What, so soon? Oh, my God, Ma. Let me call you back. -What happened? -ls everything all right? The nana... ...headed for the altar. -She's getting married? -Pack your bags. We're going to Miami. All right. Shuffleboard, mahjong... ...dinner at 4. This is gonna be the best spring break ever. Hey, man. I know you think you're excited about Miami... ...but I cannot wait for you to meet the guys at Nana's condo. We got Abe, we got Stu, we got Stanley. Although I think Stanley may have passed on. He had a prostate thing. I hope not. -I can't go. -What? Why not? Everything with me and Marissa. -ls awesome. -Fine, okay. But there's Trey. Who's also doing awesome. Ryan, face it, you got no excuses. Everything's great. You deserve a vacation. We, actually, deserve a vacation, Ryan. And it would mean a lot to my dad. -Yeah. He is kind of worked up. -He's gonna need company. -Well, he's got you. -I can't, man. My schedule's all booked up. I got pinochle with the ladies on Saturday. Bridge Sunday with the fellas. Gotta see if I can get on that bingo cruise. That'll be awesome. -What about you and Summer? -I'm gonna go apologize... ...extremely sincerely... ...and then I'm gonna get out of town before I do anything else wrong. What do you say? Miami. Miami. Miami? Miami. Miami. Miami. Miami. -Miami. -Miami. Honey, do you have my American Advantage number? I'm on AA.com and I'm trying to use my miles to upgrade. You know me, l-- I hate sitting in the middle. It's in my purse. But what's the rush? It's not like she's getting married tomorrow. Well, I know. It's just.... I love my mother. -But who else would? -That's terrible. You wouldn't say the same about your dad? -You make a good point. -She was so happy on the phone... ...I just wanna make sure everything works out of her. Great. You know, especially after the year she's had. You are a good son. Oh, yeah? How about husband? Definitely top five. Miami, huh? Well, have a hell of a time then. -Thanks. You'll be all right? -Don't worry, Mom. I'll be fine. Yo, Ry, look, I gotta jump. I-- Probably the landlord complaining about something. Yeah. Well, have fun. See you. Definitely not the landlord. Hey, you. So... ...I just wanted to come by to say thanks again. For not selling me out. Have you met Don Julio? Yeah. Me and the Don go way back. -Thanks for the gift. -Oh, that's not the gift. I figure a guy's been in prison for 1 8 months... ...probably got pretty lonely. You have no idea. Hey, Summer. Busy? -What do you want, Cohen? -To talk. Yeah? -Hold my bag. -Anything for my million-dollar baby. -So look, I just came to apologize. -Why? Because I was humiliated in front of all your oh-so-hip, super dorked out... ...indie-music-loving comic-book geeks, who looked at me... ...Iike I was some dimwit Orange County ho? Yeah. But that was never my intention, okay? I really only wanted you there to be a part of everything with me. There's no point in you apologizing. You can no longer make me upset. -You're just immune to my charms? -Working on it. But you know what I could use? A timeout. Okay. Well, you know.... Good. Actually, that's good timing because... ...I'm headed to Miami to see the nana, so.... Well, perfect. Go to Miami, get wasted... ...and wind up on Music Video Nation's Spring Break special. It's not like that. The only thing I'll be drinking is Metamucil. Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna believe that. Look, just go. Go sow your oats. Get all of your Cohen-y, Cohen-ish Cohen-isms out of your system. And when I get back? We'll see. Hi. Hey. So just imagine... ...a whole weekend of nothing but this. If you could hold that thought till next weekend. Why? You going somewhere? Yeah, actually. Miami. South Beach for a little spring-break action? -Meet come college girls? -Not quite. Going with Seth and Sandy to see the nana. -That's really sweet. That'll be fun. -Yeah. No, it will be. It's just, I don't know, I kind of feel weird leaving Trey here by himself. I can hang out with him. Yeah, really? Because I was kind of gonna help him find a job. -I got it covered. -Thanks, I owe you. Yes, you do. You do owe me. A whole weekend of nothing but this. That I can do. All right, you got all the numbers? My cell phone, Fontainebleau... -...the nana? -I got the numbers. And you remember how to set the alarm to "no delay. " -lf the alarm goes off, the code is...? -"Greased lightning. " -Yes. Do you need any cash? -I have plenty of money. -I gassed up your car. -Which I so appreciate. -Are you gonna be fine? -I'll be fine. I love you. -The question is, are you gonna be okay? -Oh, yeah. Fellas, you got everything? I got my cardigan, my orthopedic shoes and my humidifier. Now take me to my people. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye-bye. Is Carter in the office? In the immortal words of Will Smith: "Welcome to Miami. " There's too many young, tan, healthy people here. I don't like it. Well, let's check in anyway. -Who wants some dinner? -Yeah. It's 4 p.m. in Orange County. They put us on the early-bird circuit. -Hey. -Hey. I have the weekend to myself. I thought we could roll up our sleeves, really dig in... ...and maybe even get a few issues ahead. Well, I'd hold on to that thought if I were you. Turns out Newport Living, which l thought was the last nail in the coffin... ...that is my career, is actually the thing that saved it. You got another job offer. Well, Carter, that's great. Thanks. Yeah, so l-- I fly out on Monday. Fly out where? New York. That's where the job is, and they're relocating me. -You're leaving. -I am. But my publisher is lining up someone to replace me. You know, someone who is smarter and better at this than I am. So... ...I hope you don't think I'm jumping ship. Because you are. It's really great. I was thinking we could have a farewell dinner. -You know what? We should. -Great. I'll make a reservation at Arches. Or you could come by the house tomorrow. I'll cook. Man. I thought Newport was nice. -This is something, huh? -Yeah. If you're a fan of the vibrant nightlife. Why can't we go see the nana tonight? You know the nana and her schedule. -Friday night's mahjong. -What? -Yeah. -Since when is Friday night mahjong? -That totally throws off my schedule. -Breathe it in, boys. We got a weekend away with nothing to worry about. Oh, hey. Sorry. Marissa. What's up? Ryan took off for Miami, huh? Y eah. So I just wanted you to know that while he's gone, I'm here. Cool. You know, you don't have to if you don't want. No, I want to. And, you know, I thought maybe tomorrow we could go job-hunting. That sounds great. I thought with Ryan gone I was gonna be alone in Newport. No, not on my watch. So I'll see you tomorrow. -Can't wait. -Okay. You and Marissa Cooper? Yeah, right. -It's not like that. -lt sure isn't. Not in this lifetime. Or in this town. Your move. -You're playing with him? -Yeah. -I thought you were playing with me. -With him. No, l-- I just moved. -Now we're talking. -I'm with him. -All right, so I'll watch. -Abe, Stu, Stanley. -Hey, look who's here. -How are you? -Terrible. -Worse, worse. How's your nervous stomach? -You still got shpilkes? -Why don't you have a seat. -You need my heating pad? -Back's a little sore. Back's a little sore. All right. Now I'm officially terrified. He doesn't have this many friends at school. So they do fly airplanes from Orange County to Miami. I wouldn't know. I see so little of you. Ma. -You look better than ever. -Yeah? I'm getting married. -You remember Ryan. -Of course. Who would forget with those arms? You know, if I weren't engaged.... There's my grandson. -Hello, bubeleh. -Hello, Nana. I want you to tell me everything that's gone on for you this whole last year. I can barely remember what I had for dinner last night. Please. -Welcome to the club. -Me too. You know. -You wanna talk? -Sure I do. You keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't die of old age, huh? Is this Metamucil malted? -Kirsten couldn't make it? -Well, she wanted to. So how are things with you two? To be honest, they've been better. You two will work it out. Since when did you become such a romantic? Falling in love will do that to you. Speaking of which, I have photos from the place... ...where we're holding the ceremony in June. So you should book your tickets now. Whoa, June. What's the rush? -You pregnant? -Yeah, yeah. Very funny. Listen, you go through a year like I did, you don't wanna waste any time. Besides, I wanna move before the summer storms hit. -You're moving? -Yeah. Bobby is 1 2 years my junior. This place skews a little old for him. We're gonna move to the condo you bought me in Sarasota. -lt was meant to be lived in. -Bobby flipped when he saw it. Beachfront, unbeatable location. Why wouldn't he? I know what you're thinking, Sanford. And cynicism is a Cohen family trait. -Yeah, well, I learned from the master. -Yeah, well.... Nonetheless, he's a good guy. And he can move his practice anywhere. Everybody always needs a good chiropractor. Not another word. -I can't wait to meet him. -Very good. -Eat your lunch. -Yes, Ma. Summer. Hey, Summer. Oh, God. Zach, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I was in a rage blackout. My therapist said boxing might help me through it. I came to see if you were okay after the other night. I'm in gym clothes, and my hair is in French braids. So I'm terrible. Cohen and I are on a timeout. He went to Miami to party it up like he always does this time of year... -...when we're on a timeout. -Are you too full of rage to hang out? -Maybe come over for dinner? -No offense, but hanging... -...with your family sounds bad. -Oh, no, I totally understand. They're in Aspen for an economics conference. Come on. I'll cook. Italian. Francesca gave me a great recipe. Choke. Sit down. Sorry, figure of speech. Victory lap. My people. -You cleaned his clock. -Not that he'll pay up. Cheap bastard. Hey, Seth, what do you say? -You ready to roll? I'm really hungry. -Hey, I'm famished too. It doesn't seem like there's anybody left to beat... ...so why don't we go into the dining hall. We're gonna have lunch. My treat. -I can't beat that. That's great. -Can I get in on the action? Mary Sue. Nice to meet you. This is my grandma, Mary Ellen. Hello. Actually, we were gonna go eat. -Right? -Yeah. Well, you like food? One round? Sure. Sure. This will just take a second. Okay. Rack them, sir. -Hey, how'd it go? -My dream's come true. -I'm cleaning toilets. -You got it? -I start tomorrow. -Oh, that's great. So we.... We gotta celebrate tonight, okay? -I will make margaritas. -I'll bring the guacamole. It sounds like a party. But I gotta stay here, fill out some paperwork... ...so I'll see you tonight. -Okay. -And hey, thanks. -I feel like my life's coming together. -Hey, I'm happy to help. So I'll see you later. I do believe we have a new shuffleboard champion. -I can't believe she beat me. -I can. -Can we eat now? -No. I won't go down like that. These people look up to me. I'm like a god to them. You wanna lose again? I wanna play again. Only this time, why don't we make it interesting? A little wager. You wanna do money? You wanna do food? You want me to streak naked through the bingo hall? Actually... -...I do need a partner. -Partner? -What kind of partner? -Well... ...besides being down here to visit my grandma, I entered into a dance contest. -A dance contest? -For Music Video Nation. For their big Spring Break special. And the winner gets $5000, which would really help with my college loans. That sounds very reasonable, Mary Sue. Only move she's getting out of me is a victory dance. What up, what up, what up? Yeah. My name's Swerve. The host of MVN's Sp-- Sp-- Spring Break. Coming at you live from South Beach. Hi, I'm Pixie, one of the star's of Sherman Oaks: The Real Valley. All right. I hope you' re all crunked up... ... because this next performance's gonna be off the chain... ...and totally bananas-oh-bananas-oh-bananas. Bring them out from my dogs from the dirty South: T.I.! Who knew, man? I've never played anyone under 85 before. -Right. -The registration tent is over there. -We need to sign in. -Okay. So... ...what kind of dancing are we talking? A little jazz step, a little soft-shoe? -Actually, it's not quite a dance contest. -lt isn't? No. -She's got whipped cream, Seth. -I know. Maybe she's baking a cake. I'm gonna cover myself in whipped cream, and you're gonna lick it off... ...and eat a cherry out of my mouth before any of the other contestants. Did she say "cherry"? If we win, it would mean so much to my grandma. Not having to worry about my college loans. With all the money she spends on medication. Yeah. It's her grandma. What does she have? Yeah, well, just hope Summer hasn't paid her cable bill. -Ryan. -Hello? Hey, what's going on? It's actually kind of a long story. Can you do me a favor? If you see Summer, could you please keep her away from the television? Well, actually, I was going over to Trey's to celebrate. -He got a job. -Really? That's awesome. They disqualified me from the wet T-shirt contest. But don't they look real? Wait. That wasn't the nana, was it? Oh, my God. I'm gonna puke. Actually, I'm... ...kind of wishing I was home now. Yeah, I'm kind of wishing that too. -Stay out of trouble, okay? -All right. Back at you. -It's like an Olive Garden around here. -Buongiorno, Summer. So, what is gnocchi? I don't know. I'm making gnocchi. You've never had gnocchi before. No, I've never heard of it until five seconds ago. How do you say it? Gnocchi. Gnocchi. Listen, I'm gonna be a while, so I'm gonna turn on the TV here. MVN's Spring Break special. I took the ltalian thing a little too far there, didn't l? You had me at buongiorno. Thanks for having me over. And don't worry, I won't talk about Cohen. Oh, Cohen or no Cohen, I'm just here for the gnocchi. -I really want you to like him, Sandy. -Oh, me too, Ma. -Me too. -There he is. -Hey. Sandy Cohen. Pleasure. -Bobby Mills. Heard a lot about you. Hey, sweetie. It's unbelievable. You look way too young to have a son this old. -Hey, no offense. -Why would I be offended? I have to tinkle, so.... You two have a lot to talk about. Mainly me. She's a great lady, huh? Your mom. What a pistol. I always thought of her as more of an AK-47. I gotta tell you, since she's met you, she has mellowed. My mother in love. -I never thought I'd see the day. -She came into my clinic... ...I cracked her back, and the rest is history. That is so romantic. I'm just so happy she's met a nice guy, you know. An honest guy. -Well, thank you, Sandy. -Oh, thank you. Listen, there are a lot of guys, they see an older woman not in perfect health... ...with a million-dollar condo in her name.... We've all seen 60 Minutes, haven't we? Well, I'm more a Dateline guy. I like that Stone Phillips. Who doesn't? You know, I was a public defender for many years... ...and my tendency is to be suspicious. It's a problem for me, Bobby. You know, I've got trust issues. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. But I got a ways to go. -You can trust me, Sandy. -Well, that's what I figured. You know, I tell my cop friends, my buddies at the FBl. They say, "Sandy, let me run a background check on this guy. " You know what I say? I said, "No. " Sophie Cohen is still pretty sharp. If she trusts you... ...I trust you. Great news. They have fresh crab. Oh, it can't be better than Joe's. Bobby, you like Joe's stone crab? Yeah. I love them. I figured you've been out of the loop. You need to catch up on your movies. Margaritas and movies. Sure. What do you got? The best movie of, like, all time. The Notebook. I'm kind of more of a shoot-'em-up type guy, where people, like, die. Well, James Garner doesn't fair so well. Great. If it's your favorite movie... ...I'm in. A toast to you. -Thank you. -Oh, to me? I like that toast. Hey. I'm a little early. It's okay. I-- I just finished. You made all this? It's amazing what I can do when I'm off work. Who knew? Would you like some wine? Hi. I've been doing, like, a little bit of thinking... ...and I'm not so sure I'm the guy for this job. -You're backing out on me? -No, no. It's not that. It's just, you know... ...there's whipped cream, and I'm a little lactose intolerant, so.... If you back out on me, I have no chance to win. And Grandma Mary Ellen won't pay her medical bills. And I'll have to drop out of college. Well, I'm a fan of Medicaid and education... ...so okay. -Thank you. Thank you so much. -Sure. -It's almost time to get ready. -Okay. What do we do? Hey, man. Can I get a bottle of water, please? How you doing? -I'm all right. You? -Bad. -I can't find my girlfriend. -Oh, yeah? -Lost her in the crowd? -I lost her last night. Told me she was coming to Florida to see her grandma. But her best friend told me she entered some contest down here. Immodestly revealing her body for money. Yeah, well, spring break. -That does happen. -Doesn't happen where we're from. -Where's that? -Bob Jones University. They find out what she's doing here, she'll be expelled. Which won't matter when she's burning in hell. -Yeah, that's rough. -The worst part is... ...I think she's cheating on me with whoever her partner in sin is. That's why I brought my boys with me. -Oh, yeah? Your frat brothers? -Bible-study buddies. We get a hold of who's corrupting her, it's gonna be Judgment Day for him. And Mary Sue. Did you say Mary Sue? This is scandalous. I've never finished a full bottle of wine before dinner. Is it a bad sign when you drink so much that you can't open a new bottle? Yeah, I think it means we should stop drinking. Who are we kidding? Here. There. We definitely need to eat. Well, it looks like the Fontainebleau and I seem to be aging nicely. But the Fontainebleau has had a lot of work done. This au naturel thing is why I'm beating them off with a stick. Speaking of which, where is Bobby? He should've been here by now. Didn't he say he was gonna be stopping off at his office? -How far is that from here? -Not all that far. I hope nothing's wrong. Look at Ma with a cell phone. -I'm very hip. -I guess so. -I just can't read the buttons. -Let me see. Hello? Bobby, where are you? We're waiting for you. What? A malpractice suit? Sweetheart, that's terrible. Come over here so we can talk about it. The airport? Where are you going? Well, how long before you think this thing blows over? I see. Okay. Goodbye. Bobby won't be joining us. Just like that, huh? What did you say to him? Oh, man. Okay, you are way too good at this... ...because I've lost, like, 1 0 times in a row. Yeah, well, I was All-Chino in drinking. Yeah, I thought I was All-Newport... ...but clearly you're in a league of your own because... ...I'm.... Maybe we should watch that movie. Coming soon to DVD and VHS: When Vivian Michaels landed her dream job... ...she thought she was the luckiest person in the world. Hey, how you doing, Viv? Nice haircut. You know, maybe we should get some air first because... ... I don't wanna fall asleep during the movie. It's-- It's really good. -Y eah. Sure. -Okay. Let's do it. Okay, yeah. I definitely need some air. Hey, you know what? I will be right there. -I just need to grab my jacket. -Okay. This next contest is dirty, y'all. It's off the chain. It's bananas-oh-bananas-oh-bananas! -Come on! -Who likes whipped cream? Now let's see which of these four guys is truly whipped. Give it up, you all. Bring them out. Come on, who has the whipped cream? Yeah. Paint that body! Paint that body! There she is. It's time to bring fire and brimstone down on her and that skinny little sinner. Come on. Winner gets 5 large. Hot chick sundaes. Go! Come on, y'all. Lick some cream. Yeah! Oh, my God. I love gnocchi. It's like an ltalian dumpling. What a concept. -Do you want more? I made tons. -Yeah. Thanks. This is the event where you eat whipped cream off a girl. That is so disgusting. What girl would agree to that? And what guy... ...would be pathetic enough to humiliate himself on national television? Lick some cream. I hope this is enough sauce. I made a whole bunch, so.... I guess you liked the gnocchi. Somebody done won! Yeah! Hey, Swerve. Ryan, we won. -Yeah, now we gotta go. -What? -That looks like my boyfriend. -Your what? Whoa, contestants only. -Who are those guys? -They're in the same bible-study class. -Think they'll turn the other cheek? -Prepare to meet your maker! Looks like not. Hey. I'm sorry, Ma. I was looking out for you. I know. I guess part of me knew. I guess that's why I wanted you to come down here. I just wanted to believe... ...I wasn't gonna be spending... -...the rest of my life alone. -I could extend my trip. -Spend some more time down here. -Please, sweetheart. You have someone you love back home. You should be with her. But it would be very nice if you visited your old mother a little more often. All right. I think that was the best meal I have ever had. Well, I'm glad you liked it. -I'll tell the chef. -Well, I thought I was telling the chef. -Okay. Confession. -Yeah? I had the meal catered. I am the world's worst cook. -Yeah. -Well, okay. But so you went to all this trouble. Why blow your cover now? Oh, maybe it's the wine. But I think it's because I can't lie to you. I know the feeling. So while we're being honest with each other... ...you know this incredible job I was just offered? I almost didn't take it. Because I didn't wanna leave. That's nice. Because in the beginning you hated Newport. Well, it wasn't Newport I didn't wanna leave. Good luck with your new job, Carter. So long, Kirsten. -How you feeling? -Better, thanks. Yeah, how could you not? What a night. I mean, look at this place. Yeah. It's pretty great. It's amazing. I've got a job. A great place. Great friends. Come on, come on, come on. Howl with me. Come on. -Dude, that was terrible. -What? I'm not one for the howling. Oh, no? No, you just need to be woken up. Hey, you know, when I'm with you, I feel like I can do anything. And I've never felt that way before. -That's sweet. -You know... ...we're not so different, you and me. Hey, you know, I think maybe it's time we go. Wait, wait, wait. Where you going? -Trey, what are you--? -Come on, come on. I've seen the way you look at me. -No one's ever been this nice to me. -Yeah, because you're Ryan's brother. No, it is more than that, and you know it. And I get it. You don't want to hurt him. -But he doesn't have to know. -Trey, no. No way, okay. Never. What? What? Wait, wait. I'm not good enough? -No, look, I don't mean it like that. -Come on, what? Ryan gets all the good life, huh, right? Get off of me! Come on, come on, one night. No one needs to know. Get off of me! Please, no! No! No! Dude, look what you've done! So I guess those guys really do believe in an eye for an eye. -Hungry? -I'll pass. It's too bad we can't tell anyone what happened. No one would believe us anyway. Yeah, it's probably best I don't tell Summer. Yeah. Hey, you know what, man? I'm gonna call Marissa. Check in.
