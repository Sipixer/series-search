with my girlfriend, I can stay home. Everybody who knows me for more than five minutes hates my guts. - I'm so stupid! - Take it easy. So in theory, Julie Cooper could become your stepmother. Don't even say it. I can start over, have a new life. I never really wanted to be a financial planner. Or a thief. I think Jimmy and I might've gone into business together. - You are drunk. - You guys are like brother and sister. You guys could be related. - What's wrong? - I just took a whole bunch of pills. - We're leaving. See you soon. - What if he didn't try to kill himself? - What? - He wouldn't go to the hospital. I can't leave him alone tonight. Just go home, and I'll see you in the morning. You did accuse the guy of faking a suicide attempt. - No, I didn't. I just didn't believe him. - Oh, okay. Hard to believe such blind compassion upset Marissa. You should work for UNICEF. I don't trust him. Something about Oliver is off. Yeah. He tried to kill himself. Or he faked it, man. Either way, it's pretty off. Every day it seems Marissa and I are fighting about this guy. - I don't even know why. - Ryan, I'm no girl... Although I did spend several summers at Camp Takaho being called such. - Maybe your jealousy's getting in the way. - Yeah, except I'm not jealous. Jealous? Why would I be jealous? Because Oliver is insanely wealthy and well-traveled. He's a Dapper Don. - And I'm not. - But on the other hand... ...he's also clinically depressed and chemically dependent. So you know... ...it all comes out in the wash, really. You want my advice? Just embrace the friend, man. - You should make peace with this guy. - Maybe you're right. Or, I don't know, you could enjoy the arguing with Marissa. Sparks flying. Her yin to your yang. Could be nice for your relationship. I'd imagine. - Why, you and Anna don't fight? - We're all yang, Ryan. What would we fight about? We like the same things, have the same interests. - It's ridiculous. - That sounds terrible. - We're sharing the same brain. - Not me and Marissa. Let me ask you something. Am I dating the female me? Like me, but as a girl? I don't know. That's disgusting. True. - I gotta go. - Catch you later, Marissa. - Go what? - Gotta go embrace the friend. Hi. Hey. - How are you? - I'm okay. - How's Oliver? - You really want to know? Yeah. Yeah, I do. He feels bad. He doesn't understand why he took a bunch of pills... ...and you and I got in a fight over it. By the way, I don't get it, either. Right. I know. And I know I've been a little weird about everything. But he's your friend. So he's my friend. I know. I'm not saying I might not get weird about it again... ...but I wanna try. You wanna hang out with him, you want me to, it's okay. It's better than okay. It's... It's great. - Great? - Yeah, well... "Great" is probably pushing it a little. - But definitely good. - Thanks. Ryan. Marissa. I want you to meet our new transfer student. He says you're all friends. Hey. So I was thinking... ...maybe after school we could go play a little bit of Jenga. Yeah? No. Or we could go get some comics. We haven't done that in a while. Okay. We could go to South Coast Plaza and quietly mock people. Or why don't we try and do something different? Like... Check it out. I got some ideas. - Muscle-car racing. - What? Or we could learn Israeli self-defense. They call it <i>Krav Maga</i>. - Seth. Come on. - <i>Krav Maga</i>. - What? - Why don't we go to the IMAX theatre... ...and see the movie on migrating birds? - IMAX, Anna? We're cooler than that. I think we're past that. Why don't we take Luke's Sea-Doo out for a spin? I'm looking to branch out into different water sports. - Okay. I'll support that. - Good. If not, we can argue about it. No, I think it's good. It's important that we change things up. - We don't want to get boring. - Good. I think it's important... ...for us to not always do the same stuff or dress the same, or whatever. - Damn it. - Wow. You take Israeli self-defense. I'll take muscle cars. - Got yourself a little deal there. - Partner. - Hey. - Hey. Oliver, what's up, man? - You visiting Harbor? - Actually, Oliver goes here now. Never too late for a new start. What a surprise. - You didn't tell anyone? - I didn't think you meant it. Of course. I have more friends here than I did at my last school. Anyways, I'm gonna go wash up. It's tuna-melt Monday. - And we love tuna melts. - Yes, we do. I was looking forward, though... ...to sampling some of the other items on the menu. - Good. That's good. That's great. - Bye-bye. I was gonna take Oliver to the bookstore, since we both have free periods now. Marissa and I have, like, the exact same schedule. - What are the odds? - Crazy. Have fun. Okay. Come on. Later on. There it is, man. Tuna melts, Ryan. What am I gonna have to give up next? Oliver goes here. I was trying to talk about myself, but I did notice. - You don't find that completely...? - Embrace the friend, okay? - I'm sure there's a good explanation. - Seth. Come on. I gotta go. And my 12:00? Right. The 16-year-old with his third DUI. What do I have at 6? The travel agent who falsely advertised... ...the Bahamian beach house. What a day. All right. Thanks, Cory. Bye. Four years at Berkeley Law, 15 as a public defender... ...so I could become Judge Judy. - I like her. She's tough, but fair. I watch a lot of daytime TV. What's going on? - Tomorrow, we're going to lunch. - You couldn't have told me on the phone? At the Lighthouse. Yeah, except for the Lighthouse is closed. - Forever. - Well, I got them to open it up again. So we could take a look, make sure we wanna buy it. - Are you serious? - I sure am. You can thank me later. We were five martinis deep, we were joking. There was singing involved. I remember. You alienated several waitresses. - Well, that one liked me. - You were drunk. That's my point. We cannot open a restaurant. - That's crazy. - Why? Why is that so crazy? We don't know anything about running one. You managed the Lighthouse for two years. Two summers. And I was stoned and drunk, in college. It was the '80s. You might wanna keep that from the investors. - Restaurants fail. - Not all of them. - I don't have the capital. - I'm working on that. - Look, it's not a good time for me. - That's exactly my point. If you don't find something soon, the next stop for you is Phoenix. The way I look at it, you got nothing to lose. And we both have everything to gain. So, come on. Am I gonna see you tomorrow? - I'm sorry. I can't do lunch today. - But what about tomorrow? It's a little hectic right now. The Fred Segal sale is happening. I was thinking maybe Nobu. A road trip. That's even less likely than lunch. - Movie? - No. Coffee? Julie, I really appreciate your desire to be such good friends... ...but the thing about good friends is that when they want something... ...they just ask. The interior design job. I know it's available. I want it. I thought you wanted me to water your plants or babysit Kaitlin. Because you don't take me seriously as a working woman, as a designer. You're not really experienced, qualified. Before I had Marissa, I did lots of design work. You had Marissa when you were 18. I know your usual home designer fell out at the last minute. I know you have no one. Caleb. Pillow talk. - He thought the idea was inspired. - Well, it's thinking outside the box. He told me he's staying out of it, though. That it's up to you. Look. One house, one shot. If I screw up, you can fire me yourself. It's a win-win. Hi. - What's so funny? - Danny. He's, like, the funniest guy ever. Yeah? Hey, man. I'm Seth. Good to meet you. Your yellowtail is not as fresh as mine. Dare to taste my albacore? He's, like, straight out of a Bruce Lee movie. Hey, who took the jelly out of your doughnut? Somebody call <i>CSI</i>, we got ourselves a cold one here. - <i>CSI</i>! - Hey, tag that toe. All right, well, somebody call <i>ER</i>. I think Luke's gonna bust a gut. - I don't get it. - Hey. Looks like we both got tuna. Mine's just raw and missing cheese. Time for class. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Hey, don't fall in. Hey. Is this seat available? - Sure. Yeah. - Wow. - I'm so behind already. - I know the feeling. Does junior year ever get easier? I thought you were a senior. Not a good one. And Harbor, being as competitive as it is... ...not all my credits transferred. - But you still wanted to come here? - Wasn't up to me. My parents insisted. Put the paperwork in a while ago. Why transfer at all, a little over a semester from graduating? It just wasn't working for me at Pacific. Because? Because there was an incident. What kind of incident? Look, I've made some mistakes in my life. I don't think that's a surprise. Or a secret. But if you could just give me a chance, Ryan. Just let me in, like I know people let you in. I could finally start over. That's really all I want. - Hey, guys. - Hi. Hey. I thought maybe we could go to Oliver's after school. - Order in some room service. - Yeah. You wanna come? - I was gonna help him with his French. - French? - Didn't you live in Paris a couple years? - A year. When I was 13. And you need Marissa to help you? Well, sweet-talking my way into a club... ...isn't the same as conjugating the infinitive. Right. You guys go ahead. I told Seth I'd meet him back home. - You sure you don't wanna come? - Yeah. I trust you. You should. - I don't trust him. - Trust who? Summer's new boyfriend or whatever. - Something sort of seems off about him. - Off how? I don't know. He's just not funny. You know what I'm talking about. He's big. But big isn't necessarily funny. It's cheap. He said there was an incident. - Big funny guy did? - No. Oliver. Can we forget Oliver for five seconds and talk about me? It's the reason he left Pacific. What if he's violent? New guy shows up. Violent. Angry. Prone to punching people. That'd be weird. He needs help with his French? He lived in France. We should call the cops. Oliver lost his grasp on the subjunctive. Fajitas are served. Nothing adds up. And if I try to say anything to Marissa... - Maybe there's somebody I can talk to. - Yeah. Or you could break into the file room and steal his bio. Or you can be a grownup... ...forget about it and move on. Okay? Like I am. To the fajitas. Hey, can I help you? I forgot a book in my locker. All right. It's open. Make it quick. Hey, what are you doing? I don't think I need to explain what a serious offense this is. We understand, and believe me when I tell you, Ryan will be punished. I'm afraid it won't end there. This matter will be presented to the disciplinary committee. Suspension, even expulsion, are not out of the question. The school must do what it deems appropriate. But understand that this is very uncharacteristic of Ryan. Indeed. Mr. Atwood and Harbor seem like a remarkably good fit. Which leads me to wonder, why would you do this? I just... I don't trust this kid. Oliver. He seems suspicious. - Suddenly he's going here now. - I assure you... ...Oliver went through the same screening process as any student. He has a history of instability. I was concerned. - For Marissa. - Has he made any threats to her? Anything to warrant your suspicions? No, but he's been spending a lot of time with her. And there's this letter in his file... - A confidential letter. - Says they found him... ...in the men's bathroom at Pacific, having cut his wrists... ...over a girl. She filed a restraining order. That's why he left. - Is this true? - Two years ago. Since then he's been institutionalized. And everyone involved in Mr. Trask's rehabilitation... ...believed his best chance was a change in his environment. And the school was receptive to him despite his history? Harbor is known to make exceptions for students with troubled backgrounds... ...but who show extraordinary promise. - I'm sorry. - We are too. We will see you at 3 p.m. For detention... ...which you will attend every day until the committee reaches its verdict. Thank you, Dr. Kim. Thank you. - Seth. Hey. - Hey. - I have a surprise for you. - Really? Two tickets to see Bright Eyes. We've never seen them before. I thought it'd be different. - Bright Eyes, really? - Yes. - Summer, you got... Right there. - Where? - Hey. - Hey, you guys. - Hey, Summer. Hi, Danny. - Hey. Oh, Seth. You got a little nasty there. - Okay. - No, seriously. You got a tuna stain or something. - Well, I'll be sure and get it washed. - Seth, seriously. All kidding aside... ...you've got something there, and I think you're gonna wanna clean it up. - Seth, you do have something there. - What? - You got me. - God, isn't he, like, the funniest guy ever? - Yes. - Hey. You wanna come over later? I TiVo-ed Leno. Sure. God. Who watches Leno? That explains everything. - Explains what? - Why that Danny guy is so not funny. - He's funny. - No, he's not funny, okay? - He's big. Big is not funny. - Whatever. - Seth. Friday night. Bright Eyes? - Anyone can be big. That's my point. Right? Being obvious, there's no accomplishment in that. - What? - You're jealous. Of Danny's comedy? No, sweetie, I'm not. No, of Danny. If you weren't, you'd be happy for Summer. You'd embrace the friend. I love this place. All it needs is a little nip and a tuck. But are we the right doctors for the job? Hands of a surgeon. Come on, Coop. Get excited. Get involved. We'll blow this wall out, make it all one room. Big leather booths. Keep it dark, but not too dark. You know, just like it was for Bogie and Bacall. - You're serious about this, aren't you? - Yeah. What do you got? - They used to have great live music here. - I like it. Cabaret? - Actually, jazz. - Jazz works. That's good. - How about a raw bar? - Okay. - As long as it feels timeless. - It will. Gary Cooper was a big oyster man. And a big drinker. Okay, so no frou-frou drinks. No umbrellas. No fruit wedges. Nothing Gary wouldn't approve of. - Only one kind of martini. - Thank you. And only the finest Scotch. Now, we're gonna have to have meat loaf on the menu. My mother makes the greatest meat loaf. - I can get the recipe. - No, my mother makes... ...the greatest meat loaf, and I have the recipe. There can be two meat loafs on the menu. We'll make restaurant history. Hello, Lighthouse. Your ship has come in. Now, you know where you're going for the slate, yes? Brenda Antin has the seagrass mats, and Betsie von Toff is going to do the flowers. Hydrangeas only, people. Okay. We have 72 hours to make this open house. I want a full progress report and POs today. Let's get it done. Go. Hey. Sorry about your office, Kiki. I needed a base camp... ...for Operation Model Home. - Okay, Julie. I think maybe a little bit you've lost your mind. This is a disaster. Kirsten, if you stopped open-heart surgery halfway through... ...it would look like murder. You have 72 hours. I gave you a list of the usual vendors. See, there's that word, "usual." What I'm doing is special. It's inspired. - You're never gonna get done in time. - Good attitude. Thanks for putting that out in the universe. All you need is a few accent rugs, a couch, maybe a potted plant. - We're selling a space. - Well, I'm selling a lifestyle. Kirsten, the Newport Group should be an aspirational brand. "Aspirational"? Is that even a word? I know it seems ambitious. And it'll be expensive, but sometimes... ...you gotta spend money to make money. Hey, are you hungry? I'm starved. Why'd you do it? If they vote to expel you, there's nothing we can do. You will have taken this opportunity and tanked it. And why? - Are you jealous of this Oliver kid? - No. No, I'm not jealous. Look, you guys may not believe me. No one may believe me. The first time I met the kid, he was in jail. He has a medical history. You're right. Okay. He's trouble. Now you're the one who might be expelled. - Lf only you had come to us. - I wanted to deal with it myself. - Well done. - Do you know how hard we...? - You worked to get into that school? - You can't help Marissa. - You can't even help yourself. - Okay. I screwed up, yet again. So now what? You gonna kick me out? You think you can mess up so bad we'll just give up on you? You can't. You are part of this family now, and you're gonna feel the full weight of that. You're gonna wish we threw you out. Hey, man. I couldn't help but overhear. Actually, I was eavesdropping. They're pretty pissed, huh? - Yeah, well, I deserved it. - Yeah? Well, good. So this is over then, though? I mean, lesson learned and all that? Today I saw Oliver give Marissa a letter... ...which she put in her locker. And seeing Oliver do this inspired you to write a letter of your own? So this is Oliver's letter. That Marissa asked you to mail? - I took it from her locker. - Dude, what is wrong with you? - You haven't read it? - No, not yet. Not ever. You can't read it. You have to put it back. What if he's after her? He's a sick kid. Oliver has not done anything to Marissa except be her friend. Okay, stop it. You're in enough trouble already. And honestly, you're starting to freak me out a little bit. Just... Will you promise me that you will put it back? Will you promise me that you will put it back? - Put it back. - I will. Put it back. Come in. Hey, man. Okay, I know everything you said last night, but I need to talk to you. - You read it? - It's worse than I imagined. - No, please don't. - He says he can't live without her... I don't wanna hear it. That letter's like <i>The Ring</i>. Anyone who reads it is gonna die. Plus, it's a federal offense. - Okay. I'm being serious. - So am I. Okay? That is Marissa's letter that you stole from her locker and read? - Lf she finds out, you guys are done. - Okay. - I get that. Oliver... - Oliver might be crazy. You might be right. But right now, you're giving him a run for his money. Hey, Seth. Is Ryan in there? Yeah. Hey. Hey. What are you guys doing? Ryan was waxing my back. Could you give us a sec? Sure. I just wanted to know if after school today... ...you wanted to take that cooking lesson with Oliver? I can't. I'm helping Kirsten move furniture in the new model home. Julie? It's a disaster. What was all that about open-heart surgery? I lost the patient. - What happened? - It's what didn't happen. No slate. No bubbling fountains. No seagrass. Hydrangeas are out of season. We have 48 hours until the open house, and we have nothing. - We can fix this. - No, we can't. Way to put that into the universe. I'll call my vendors. It may not be anything special. It may not be "aspirational." God, I don't give a rat's ass. If Caleb sees that house empty... He won't. But you gotta be ready to work. Get your hands dirty. Manicure's not till Friday. Can I have an orange-peel smoothie with a splash of pineapple, please? I'll have the same. Except with some strawberry and banana. Mr. Palmer totally looks like a pterodactyl. God, he does impersonations? Hey, why you all up in my Kool-Aid not even knowing the flavor? - Hey, Summer. - What? - You know who wants a smoothie? - Who? - Mr. Chuckle! - No! Oh, my God. Danny. Hey, what are you doing after school? You wanna maybe come over and hang out at my house? I've TiVo-ed some Leno. Seann William Scott's on. Oh, Leno. Sean William Scott. Nice. Double the comedy. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it. Hey, man. I thought you were in court. No, it's a settlement. I almost never go to court anymore. So order up some martinis and meat loaf. We got ourselves a restaurant. Well, I thought you'd be a little more excited. - What'd you do? - I put a down payment on it. Tomorrow we go sign the title. I haven't had a chance to come up with my share of the money. No, I covered it. We can work out a get-even scheme once we're afloat. - So, what? I work for you? - Jimmy, come on. You were one click away from manning the mechanical bull... ...at the new cowboy bar. I wanna pull my own weight. You've already done enough for me as it is. I'm not doing it just for you. This could mean freedom for both of us. You could stay at a job you like... ...and it'd give me a break from all my rich clients and the office politics. - We could work for ourselves. - I don't know, Sandy. - I think I need more time to... - How much more time do you need? It's too fast. It's too soon. Okay. Great. Great. I got an idea. Let's wait till we're dead. I gotta go settle. That is so cool that you know Marissa's combo. Shows a lot of trust. - Yeah, for emergencies. - Oh, yeah? What's the emergency? Ran out of erasers? No more ink left in your pen? No, it's a book I forgot. Just kidding around, man. Last class of the day is so tough to get through. - Feel you on that one. - What's up? Hey, Marissa and I were talking about a camping trip. Santa Monica mountains? Bring the whole gang? - Sure. Yeah. - Sounds awesome, man. All right. I'll let her know that you are in. Long bathroom break. I should go. See you. I do not like that kid at all. Yeah? Don't you think that...? He's here for Marissa. Hell, yeah. You gotta let that guy know, "back off." I'll do it for you, if you want. - I'll keep that in mind. - Just give me the word... ...and I will drop the Great Gatsby. Did your mama teach you how to play this game? You didn't think I'd pack the heat, did you? Think you can just get me here, huh? Home court advantage. Guess what. Who's got the secret codes? Danny does. Guess what, buddy. You are <i>Punk'd</i>. There's a camera there, camera there and a camera right there. - Who's your daddy? - Hey, kid. Settlement happened sooner than I thought. - Good. This is my friend Danny. - Hey. How are you? I'm Sandy. Why don't you take a shower? - Pardon me? - Just kidding. I like you dirty. Sandy. Dirty. Sandy. Dirty. - That kid is not funny. - Thank you. I know. - He makes Ryan look funny. - He makes Marissa look funny. Gentiles. I love your mother more than words, but not funny. Get yourself some funnier friends. - There you are. - Thanks, man. - Sure. - I'm so parched. Oh, dude. Have you seen my impression of Mr. Parker? Yes. Pterodactyl. Seen it. It's good. - Hey, listen, man. Can I ask you a favor? - Sure. Whenever you're around Summer, could you...? This is weird, but could you try and be a little less funny? Man, all I ever hear from her is how funny Seth Cohen is. How he's the funniest guy she's ever met. I mean, I like her so much, and I'm just... I'm killing myself to hang in there. She said that about me, that she thinks I'm the funniest guy ever? Yes. You and some dude named Captain Oats. Who the hell is Captain Oats? Well, chin up, Danny. Because you know what? I think you're funny. I just think, and if you don't mind me saying so... ...that you could go a little bigger with your comedy. I think you're small... ...a little under the radar. - Yeah? - Yeah, big's hilarious. - Big. - Yeah. - All right, man. Thanks. - I'll give that a shot. - Give it a shot. I'll give it a shot! Thanks for making time for me after school. - I know how busy you are. - Of course. What's going on? Why don't you have a seat. So I know this is a little outside my job description as dean. I felt I had a responsibility to have an honest conversation with you. - What is it? - I need to talk to you about... ...one of our transfer students, with whom I know you have a relationship. - And who I worry might not be so stable. - I appreciate it, Dr. Kim. But I'm well aware of Oliver's issues. It's not Oliver I want to talk about. Detention's over, gentlemen. See you tomorrow. I thought you were helping Kirsten. - I got detention. - I see that. What for? I failed this chemistry quiz, slacking off on some homework. That's a lie. - What are you talking about? - I heard what happened, your break-in. - I did it to protect you. - What? What are you talking about? I don't trust him. He has a history of girls he's obsessed with. He's not obsessed with me. You know, ever since he showed up, you never trusted him. And okay, that's who you are... ...but you have to trust me. - The kid has serious issues. - Who doesn't? - He's in love with you. We're just friends. Yeah. Then what's this? Where did you get this? You stole it from my locker? I've been looking everywhere for this. So you know what this is? What this says? I can't believe you. I can't believe you stole it. You read it. How can you say he's not in love with you? Because he didn't write it to me. He wrote it to Natalie. He wants to get back together with her. And he just wanted me to read it first. - Look, I'm sorry. - I can't do this anymore. Because now... ...I don't trust you. - Morning. - Morning. You okay? Well, I'm supposed to sign the title on the Lighthouse today. I can't believe you're buying a restaurant. Funny. That's what Jimmy said just before he backed out. He did? I know the whole idea seems crazy, but I thought that was part of the appeal. - Well, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna have to buy a little time... ...and not lose the place. Well, you can always hire Julie as a partner. I think she'll be available. I have to show my father the model home this morning... ...and we had no time to pull it together. - I believe he will be underwhelmed. - The Coopers keep things unpredictable. No. I predicted that Julie would be fired. Top of the morning to you, son. - You talk to Ryan last night? - No, he just came home and went to bed. Hey. Do you want something to eat? You missed dinner, you must be hungry. - I'm okay. Thanks. - What time's Marissa picking you up? - I was gonna maybe go early with Anna. - Marissa's not picking me up. He hasn't called yet. - I know. - Is it bad that he hasn't called yet? It doesn't mean anything. Here you go, Mr. Nichol. - Hello. - Hi, Cal. Hey, Dad. I just got back from the new development. Look, it was short notice and Julie did the best she could, considering. You're preaching to the converted. I loved it. The d Ácor was simple, classic. The way I like it. It allows the architecture and views to sell themselves. - You're happy? - You're happy? Pleased as punch. How Julie here hit one out of the park on her first swing. What can I say? It's my true passion. Well, now your passion's your job. Kiki, stop looking for a new decorator. We've found our girl. - We have? - We have? The fact that you two are such close friends makes the decision easier. Be fun. You two working together, side by side. Have you lost your mind, Kiki? That thing is unsightly. Well, who could have predicted this? - Hey, Summer. - Hey, Cohen. How are you? - Okay. - Yeah? It's just Danny. I mean, he was, like, really funny, right? - Yeah. - And now, all of a sudden, he's gotten... ...big. Hey, Seth. Check it out! Get off me! - Now, that's funny. - Yeah. Well, that's the end of him. I guess I really will end up bitter and alone. Hey. I'm sorry. And I thought he was a good one. But I guess people can be really unpredictable. You know? - Hey. - Hey. - Nice scarf. - You too. - So it's <i>croque-monsieur</i> Thursday. - Yes, it is. - I was thinking fish sticks. - I was gonna have peanut butter and jelly. That's great. Well, I'm gonna just go wash up. - We'll go eat? - Okay. All right. Bye. - Well, I'm gonna go. - Yeah, well. I have to go ice Big Funny Guy, so... Well, if you're ever feeling, you know... ...too bitter and Ionely, I TiVo-ed some <i>Daily Show</i>s. I know Jon Stewart's no Leno. Thanks. My dad died and left me this place. I never thought I'd have to sell it. It was such a magical spot, when I was a kid. Don't sell it. Just give me more time to find a partner. Sandy, I got two other offers on the table. I can't wait any longer. I understand. I'm not too late, am I? Who's this? My partner. I found him. That conversation we just had about not wanting to buy the place? Forget it. Look, you know, this could fail. I mean, you know... ...I could fail again. I pretty much only have a legacy of failure. I could be responsible for ruining this place, ruining our friendship. Jimmy. Just sign it. Okay. I heard what happened between you and Marissa. Yeah. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - No, it's not. I was wrong about you. Well, I mean, did you think I came here because of Marissa? What, because I'm in love with her? Yeah. No. I... It was crazy. Here's the deal, Ryan. And it's nothing personal. But Marissa and I, we just connect. She understands me, gets me. I don't know if there's only one person on the planet... ...you're supposed to be with... ...but when she and I are together, sure feels that way. I'm sorry, but you and Marissa? Come on, man. - You're from different worlds. - You stay away from her. You can't fight fate, man. I didn't even have to lift a finger, and look what happened to you guys. Because you're not supposed to be together. I'm not saying you didn't serve your purpose. If it wasn't for you, she would've never gone to therapy. - She never would've met me. - I am not gonna let this happen. At this point, who's gonna believe you? Walk away... ...you have a chance to make something of yourself. Don't blow it over some chick you're not gonna care about in 10 years. Okay? I really am sorry. Hey! Hey! Back off!
