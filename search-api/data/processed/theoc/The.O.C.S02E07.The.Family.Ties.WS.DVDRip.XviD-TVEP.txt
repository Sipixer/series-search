I get nervous, and I start talking, and then nothing can shut me up. Except that. I have missed you all day. Does this count as--? As adultery? -You're not becoming friends, are you? -Would that be so terrible? -Really? You don't go to school? -I got kicked out of Corona... ...Mater Dei and even Newport Union. Sixteen years ago, I made an error in judgment. One that almost ruined my marriage. You're my father. -Hey, man, what's going on? -Studying. Will you punch someone, please, for old times' sake? All right, fine. Logarithms are the new uppercut, I got it. Now I see it. -See what? -I've been looking at old photos... ...of my mom for resemblances to Lindsay. Look at that. You trying to make this more awkward for me? What? It's not like you dating Lindsay is incest. You're not even related. You're not. You wouldn't get arrested. You won't have chromosomally challenged children. Kirsten's like my mom. Lindsay is... -...clearly her sister. -lt is kind of weird. The fact your mom doesn't know I'm dating her sister. It's a lot weird. I think they did a storyline like this on The Valley. Great. Tell me how it ends. You just have to ask yourself the question: Is she your girlfriend, or is she your aunt? -Ah, yes, the age-old question. -That's right. It's a story as old as time... ...really. Boy meets girl, boy likes girl... ...boy finds out girl is surrogate mother's illegitimate half-sister. I'm guessing it's too soon to joke, Seth, even for a Cohen. I just don't know what to do, you know, what to say. Have you talked to Lindsay? I wanted to give her space over the break, let her figure it out. That's all you can do. If she comes back and decides... -...she wants to be part of this family-- -We're done dating. Unless you want to move to the South. -Kirsten doesn't know, right? -She thinks we're friends. Good, because I think it's best if the missus doesn't find out. Well, that's something that every wife wants to hear. Doesn't find out what? How much I love you. -Sandy. -Yes? You don't have to lie to me. I know that Renee's testimony is today... -...and my father's going free. -Yeah. -Sharp as a tack. -Can't get by her. -Laser beam. -But I don't have to forgive him... ...not after what he did to Lindsay. That poor girl. I've been thinking, we should do something for her. This girl grew up not knowing... ...who she is or where she's from, and we're her family. -lf she wants us. -She wants us. -I mean, you guys. -Well, you too, Ryan. You're as much a part of this family as any of us. I mean, if she's my sister... ...she's your aunt. -Thanks for clearing that one up, honey. -She's so young, she's like your sister. A sister, I always wanted one of those. Ryan, how about you? -Don't worry about it. It's no biggie. -What are you talking about? When Seth met your dad, it almost ended the relationship. DJ meeting your dad can't be worse than when he met your mom. I suppose this time he will be wearing clothes. I don't know, DJ without his clothes on, pretty undeniable. Look, it'll be fine. Your dad's totally chill. He won't judge. It's just he's the only sane person in my family... ...the only one who comes even close to getting me. And I really want him to like DJ. Hey, Seth. What's up, man? -What's going on? -Did you get my Christmas card? I did. I appreciate the apology. So we're friends again, then? We're real men, okay? Red-blooded meat eaters. Occasionally, from time to time... -...we'll brawl. It's our nature. -So we can talk about confidential stuff? -It's cool? -After all the trouble I caused... ...I'm happy to have a chance to help, so come on. Okay. While I was in Cabo with my family... ...I ran into an old girlfriend... ...and we were at Squid Roe, late... ...and we kind of kissed. All right, well, first question: this old flame... -...do you still have feelings for her? -Well, I really like her kids. She's a little older than me. She was my math tutor when I was 1 4. Holy '80s teen-comedy plot. She's in the middle of a divorce. She had a lot of tequila. -Chingy was playing-- -Ooh, Chingy and tequila. -Seduction has no two finer allies. -lt was a quick kiss. And then l, like, ran out of there, but I feel really guilty. Well, man, if it was anybody else... ...I would say keep it to yourself. You will lead a much happier life. -No, I can't do that, man. -I know. You have a conscience... ...whatever. So you got to be honest with Summer, then. Tell her you feel terrible. Tell her that all it did... ...was make you realize how much you like her. Definitely do not mention... ...the ex having kids and divorces. You should be fine. -You think so? -Yeah, you'll be good. -You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? -Zach. Even if I wanted to, the code, it dictates I cannot. -Hey. -Hey. -How was your vacation? -How have you been? -I wanted to call you. -No, I'm glad you didn't. I mean, I wanted to talk to you, but l haven't really been in a frame of mind... -...to talk to anyone about anything. -Even your mom? Not until I've completed several hundred hours of intense psychotherapy... ...which was a very thoughtful gift from her. If you need some more time-- If you don't want to hang out right now... -...or ever-- -I do. We just need to find our own personal Switzerland... ...someplace neutral. And we can't hang out at my house... ...because my mom's there, and we can't hang out at your house-- -Because your sister's there? -She's not my.... I mean, I guess, technically, she is-- So I can be clear on what everybody is to everybody, you and the Cohens...? -Friends. They're my friends. -And me and you? More than friends. -More than friends. -And definitely not related. I don't want this to be like kissing your sister. The thought never crossed my mind. I got to tell you, Sanford. You're one hell of a lawyer. The charges have been dropped. The secrets of our situation have been sealed by the courts. You did it. I'm a free man. -And a smug one too. -Excuse me for wringing a little joy... ...out of the one bit of good news I had for some time. Well, never mind the fact that the news came at the expense of your family. Didn't you notice Kirsten's absence at the hearing this morning? I know I got work to do on my relationship with my daughter. Which daughter are we talking about? I'm not saying it'll be easy with Kirsten... ...but once I get back to work, I can lighten her load. -Whoa. Wait. Back to work? -Now that the scandal's gone... ...there's no reason to stay distant from the Newport Group. Except that the woman running the company hates you. Which woman we talking about? Well, I hope he 's not expecting a party in his honor. Yeah, I'll see you back at the office. Bye, Kirsten. He's free. He's free. Might have to spike these drinks. Don't know if they' re strong enough. He won't serve any jail time. -That's it. It's just.... -Over? What are we talking about here, Jimmy? Caleb? Or us? Definitely not strong enough. Well, I should get back to the office. Back to my life. But what if it wasn't my life? What if I could just walk away from it? Well, that would depend on what you're walking to. Maybe we just needed this time apart... ...to appreciate each other, what we had. But what if we can't ever have it again? I'm willing to find out if you are. Hi. I hope you don't mind me showing up like this. I was wondering if I could give you a ride home. Thanks, but I have a car. And there's a better than 50-50 chance... -...it'll start. -I know there's no right way to do this. -FTD doesn't make a-- -"Happy surprise sister" bouquet? I know you're not on the market for any new relatives, but how about a friend? We could go grab a friendly cup of coffee. Yeah, a friendly cup of coffee would be cool. You have nothing to be nervous about. It's gonna be great. What's he into? Does he like sports? He really likes ESPN Classics. Is that your mom? Alex, it's Seth. Come on, I came over to welcome you back. You've really changed over break. Wow. Who are you? Just a guy. I probably have the wrong apartment. Sorry. Seth? -Hey. -What are you doing here? I came over to say hi, see how your vacation was. I didn't realize I needed... -...to bring my own tourniquet. -Sorry. I didn't expect you to be here. Especially so early in the morning. It's 3:30 in the afternoon. Family vacations really take it out of you, huh? Y eah, I bailed on family early. I just came back to catch up with old friends. Wait, so you've been back for a while, and you didn't, I don't know, call me? I've been catching up with old friends. Who? The large, shirtless guy that answered the door? He asked, not remotely jealous. You know, I am so hung over right now. -I just think-- -Are you? Have you eaten anything? You want me to maybe put some coffee on or fix you a sandwich? Fix me a sandwich? Hey, Alex, we're gonna go grab some smokes and some more beers. -We'll be right back. -Okay. Okay, I'm trying to do the math here, and I have a few questions. I'll answer all of your questions tonight at the Modest Mouse concert, okay? It's just, my head is killing me, and.... So it was nice to see you. Really nice of you to stop by. Really nice. Nice? She kept saying the word nice. You know what that means, don't you? -She thinks you're nice. -Y eah, exactly, nice. As in lacking any edge and/or danger. Yeah, well, you did offer to fix her a sandwich. I know. It's like the more edgy and dangerous she became... ...the more I became like a Jewish grandmother. Not your grandmother. Keep shucking. I want dinner ready by the time your mother gets home. Maybe I don't feel like shucking these. Okay, maybe you should go and shuck them yourself, old man. That's good. You had me shaking in my boots. God, I'm so screwed. Bruce Banner gets mad, he turns into the Hulk. I get mad I turn into, like, a 75-year-old yenta named Sylvia. Hey, look at all this. You guys making dinner? We wanted to surprise you. I have a little surprise myself. Look who's joining us. We were having coffee... ...and we were talking, and then we did a little shopping. A lot of shopping. And next thing you know, it was dinner time. -I hope you don't mind me crashing. -No, no, not at all. No, I think dinner with all of us will be really nice. Don't you, Ryan? Nice, yeah. -Hey, kiddo. -Hey. Why did you and DJ cancel on me today? -I was looking forward to meeting him. -lt just wasn't a good time. I had a lot of homework, and he was really tired. You were busy making out with Mom. What? Marissa, that-- That-- What? Dad, I saw you. Okay. Look, I know how it must have looked. Yeah, it looked a lot like it used to when you would kiss Mom. But that was before she married someone else. -I wanted to talk to you about it-- -How could you get back with her? I mean, don't you remember how she ruined your life and mine? -Things are different now. -Oh, really? So you're not back to lying, cheating and sneaking around again. I thought you were past that. I thought you were gonna take this new money... -...and start over. -Please, let me explain. What's there to talk about? We already know how it ends. We already lived through this once. You know, for once, I wish you would just grow up and be like a real dad. What are you doing? Hey, I needed to borrow a wife-beater for tonight. -I thought you had several, so.... -Why are you wearing it? Well, Alex, she called me "nice," Ryan. So, what I'm trying to do is cultivate more of a bad-boy image. I don't think that'll get the job done. You're right. I need to borrow your wrist cuff. Hey, also, remember that choker you used to wear. No. Just.... -No. -All right. You're extra brood-ish. What's up, man? Is the Lindsay thing still bothering you? Not at all. I mean, we had a really nice family dinner. I know, I thought so. Which is part of the problem. Right, got it. There shouldn't be a problem. I mean, if Lindsay wants to hang out... ...with the sister she never knew she had, I can't get in the way. -Or make it all about me, right? -No. That's something I would do. Which is perfect, because you're becoming more like me... ...which paves the way for me to become the brooding bad boy. You realize we're both screwed. Dude, I'm wearing a wife-beater. Hey. Hello. -What's that? -What's what? Oh, this? Just my good friend, John. -John. -Yeah, he's a good friend of mine. -What's John? -No, I said-- I said Jim. No, I meant-- What I meant to say was "Jack. " They're all my friends. Yeah, that ought to take the edge off, right there. -You guys seem real friendly. -Super friendly. So if you need me... ...I'll be drinking by the speaker, because I don't care about tinnitus. I've got terrible news, really. -I've fallen in love with my ex-wife. -You were married before Julie? -You're in love with Julie? -I don't believe that. Unfortunately, I do. Jimmy, after everything she did to you before? I know, that's what Marissa said. Marissa knows? She caught us. And the things she said.... Well... ...they're all true. Look, here's the deal. I can't be here and be with Julie. But right now... ...I can't be here and not be with Julie. What are you saying? When Hailey left, I felt adrift. So I made some calls to see what was out there... ...and I came across this company that charters yachts for sale... ...in Maui. -You're leaving? -Yeah. I need to get away from here before I do any more damage to myself... ...or to my kids. Or to Julie. I love Newport, but it's-- It's no good for me right now. In the last year, I've nearly been arrested and bankrupt... ...for stealing from my clients. I got punched out at my daughter's cotillion. I lost my house, my family. I tried to kiss you... ...which I still feel terrible about. I spent the summer drunk on a boat with your 25-year-old sister. And now I'm getting back together with the woman... ...who started this in the first place. I just can't stay here any longer. I just can't do it. -So when would you go? -Well, they faxed over a contract... ...a couple weeks ago. All I have to do is sign it, and it's mine. A couple of days, and I'm history. You're giving me the pinky? I'm not really into public displays of affection. All right, let's go. Outside. We gotta talk. -So too bad Coop couldn't make it. -Zach, only I can call her "Coop. " -It's kind of weird when you say it. -Got it. -Too bad Marissa couldn't make it. -I'd freak out too if my mom and dad... ...were getting back together and kept this huge secret from me. Yeah, so we haven't had a chance to talk about our winter breaks yet. -I know. -Hey, Modest Mouse! Hey, volume, Cohen. It's not Metallica. No, it's not Metallica, it's Modest Mouse! You're, like, so sweaty. And you're-- Come here. Wait. Your breath smells like Marissa. -You are so drunk. -You guys are hanging out. That's cool. I guess she was cool with it, right? -Cool with what? -The tutor. -Thanks, Seth. -You're welcome. Welcome. Is the stage revolving or...? No, it's us. -They're really good. What's the matter? -You. You're the matter. I mean, you've been weird all night. You've been weird pretty much since I came for dinner... -...which was weird for me too. -Well, what happened to Switzerland? I don't know, Kirsten wanted to hang out. And then.... She's really cool. She is. If you want to hang out with her, you should. But if the Cohens are really my family... ...then you are my family. Which means kissing me is like kissing your sister. -Or step-aunt. -Ryan! You have to take Seth home right now. He is wasted and leaving a path... -...of destruction in his wake. -I cannot believe you. And I cannot believe that you told Cohen. See? And he puked all over the merchandise table... ...which I now have to go and mop up. I know who lives here. It's the Cohen residence in the heazy. Okay, we got to be really stealth here. I was All Camp Capture the Flag, Camp T akajo. -I invented the stealth. -Fine, you did. -I did. -You're yelling. You need to be quiet. I haven't been so wasted since your first night in Newport... ...when we beat up those kids. With a little bit, a little bit of that. And a little bit of that. A little bit of that and that-- What's going on? You guys okay? Seth? We're being stealth. Look, everything you said yesterday... ...you were right. I'm making the same mistakes all over again with your mom. -So you're gonna end it? -Yeah. -Yeah, I am. -That's great, Dad. But it's-- It's more complicated than that. I.... I need to get some perspective... ...on the world, or something. You're right. I need to learn how to be a real dad. So I'm... ...Ieaving. -What? -Yeah, I'm moving to Maui. That's your idea of being a real dad... ...abandoning me and moving to Hawaii. It's not forever. It's only for six months, maybe. You can come visit any time you want. Well, good luck with that. I mean, I hear Maui's beautiful. You know, there's gonna be a goodbye party tonight at the Cohens'. Are you okay? Totally. You were the last thing keeping me sane. When you leave, it should be interesting to see how things go. But I'll see you tonight. Hello. I just came by to tell you I'm dying and thank you for your friendship. Slowly, slowly. And also to apologize for whatever happened last night. You don't have to apologize to me. Did you talk to Zach? No. Why? You kind of destroyed his relationship with Summer. I violated the code of man. Talked to Alex? -She won't answer my calls. -Might have something to do... -...with all the vomit. -All the vomit? How much vomit? Like the little girl in Sixth Sense or the fat guy in Monty Python? Well, you wanted to be a bad boy. You did bad. Yeah, but not in a good way. I've got to talk to Alex... ...show her I can be a good bad boy, not a bad bad boy. Good luck with that. Aspirin? Thank you. You have lobster rolls, right? He loves lobster rolls. -lf it isn't my son, the wino. -You guys found out? -You weren't exactly stealth. -Damn. Lost a step since Takajo. Your dad's been waiting for you to leave the room so he can send you back to it. That's great. I know I should be used to this at this point, but why are we having a party? It's Jimmy Cooper's going-away party. Great. Then I'll run an errand real fast, then come straight home. -You're not going anywhere. -Dad, I'm grounded, I get it. I deserve it. Okay? Even though this headache is far worse than any punishment. -No. -I need to go see a girl very fast. -Then I will come straight home. -The girl who thinks you're too nice? The one you tried to impress by drinking a fifth of Jack? I think his name is John, but yes. And it went horribly, so I need to talk to her really fast. -And I need to, you know, sort of-- -Go upstairs and get dressed. You know what, maybe if I'm grounded, I shouldn't go to this party. I'm gonna go get dressed. Stairs. Hi. I got you something. It's the novelization of The Valley, season one. I have the hardcover, signed by Grady Bridges. -I should go. -That's why I'm here. -I wanted to give you a ride. -I'll go alone. -You're going by yourself. -Han Solo. But if I change my mind, I'll have Cohen get drunk and let you know. -Bye. -Summer, come on. Hooking up with your tutor, Zach? Not even that cool in the '80s. I mean, she could have at least been a hooker and helped you get into Princeton. Hey, Julie. Kik-- Kirsten. Sad day, saying goodbye to Jimmy Cooper. I remember when he was a boy. Taking him out on the boat, inviting him over... ...for dinner. -Hey. -Hey. -What's up? -See you in a few. I'm gonna slip out... ...try to fix things with Alex. -What about your parents? -They're scary. Which is why I need you to cover for me. Okay? Just throw up a smokescreen. Give them some famous Ryan Atwood double talk. -I barely talk. -Good point. The less said, the better. I don't think this is a good idea, man. You call yourself a bad boy. Jimbo. I'm sorry it's not a better turnout for you. Well, considering I defrauded most of my closest friends, it's not bad. I'm gonna miss you, Jimmy. Well, thanks, Sandy. -How'd she take the news? -I haven't talked to her yet. Good luck with that. Hey, Julie. You just gonna send me a postcard? I wouldn't have known... ...you were leaving if Kirsten hadn't invited me to your going-away party. Of course I was gonna tell you. Can we talk about this... ...someplace a little more private, please? Hi. Look who stopped by. -Hey, Ryan. -Hey, Lindsay. I'm gonna go grab some champagne. You two have fun. -Thanks. -All right. -Now we're waving at each other? -I thought you agreed... -...Kirsten can't find out about us, right? -Right, then it might be weird. Ryan, have you seen--? Lindsay. Hello. Hi. Excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt. I'll find Julie myself. Good to see you. Bye, Dad. Yeah, this isn't gonna be weird at all. Do you really think that this is going somewhere? I don't know. I was under the impression that this meant something. It did. It does. But did you really think it was gonna last? You really think that I would leave you again? Well... ...history isn't exactly working in your favor on that one. Plus, you deserve to be happy with Caleb. Yeah, that's a storybook romance... ...with our illegitimate children and our tapped phone lines. At least it's real. Jules. You gotta go so soon? I think it's probably best I go before anyone knows why I'm going. -I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- -It's fine. We're just saying our goodbyes. See you, James. So long, Jules. -Hi. -Hey, people I know. -Yeah. Where's Zach? -He couldn't make it. -Where's Cohen? -He's hurting from last night. Well, I'd like to hurt him for last night. Kind of a boring party. Not for long. I'm fine. Well, if it isn't the wicked witch of the West Coast. Are you drunk? -Let me guess, tequila? -She was like this when I picked her up. -You don't have to defend yourself to her. -But you do, young lady. Let's go, DJ, before she tries to sleep with you next. -What did you say? -You heard me, you whore! Hey, guys, not here. No, let's do it here, okay? Let's tell everyone why you're leaving, Dad. Why don't you tell everyone why you're leaving? -Please, Marissa, just-- -Hello, everybody. -Let's go, Marissa, you're drunk. -Get off of me! Guys, come on. See what you're leaving me with. See how screwed up she is. Of course I'm screwed up. I'm the daughter of a thief and a slut. You know what, I just-- I just hate you both so much. You wanted a good old-fashioned O.C. party. I just hope she's okay and she calls. As bad as I thought she'd take it, that was worse. It's gonna be hard for her. For all of us. I was hoping that, while I'm gone... ...you'd go over to the house and check up on her. -My father lives in that house, Jimmy. -I know. That's why I want you to go there. I need to know that someone is watching over her. For my oldest friend, anything. I can't believe this. If we had gotten married, I'd be moving to Hawaii. No. If I had married you, there's no way I would have left. I just want to get the hell out of here. Where did they park my car? Irvine? Excuse me, Mr. Nichol. There's a problem with your car. You scratched my Aston Martin? Your car's been stolen. Wow. Whose car is that? This? It's mine, Alex. I stole it. -You stole a car? -Yep. I do that sometimes, Alex. I do it for kicks. Are you trying to impress me? -What? -You know, with getting drunk... ...and stealing cars, and.... It's just.... Seth... ...I've been with a lot of bad boys. And you... ...are not one of them. Right. I'm just gonna make a bundt cake and put on some tea. -See you later. -No. Seth, you're a good guy. And that's why I like you. Really? Good, because I don't think this bad-boy thing's working out for me. -Me neither. -ls this your vehicle, sir? Happy, high vibrations attract happy, high vibrational.... What are you still doing here? Your stepmom blocked my car in. I tried to wake her up, but is she, like... -...alive? -Y eah, just heavily medicated. -How was the party? -Don't know. Maybe I should hire you a tutor, and she can catch you up on everything. Look, I've had a lot of time to sit here... ...vibrating at a very high frequency, and think. And I realize this is a really important moment for us. This is our first fight that wasn't about Cohen. I mean, he helped, but this fight, it's ours. I guess that's true. I'm really sorry. It didn't mean anything. -Believe me. -It's not about what happened. It's just that you didn't tell me, you told Cohen. -From now on, I'll tell you everything. -Why? Planning on screwing up again? Only one way to find out. -We finally have a moment alone. -Yeah. Maybe a chance to talk about everything. You know what, I don't want to. We keep hypothesizing how kissing me might be like kissing your sister. And... ...I think we should just find out. So you want me to kiss you as an experiment? Yeah. And if it truly is weird... ...well, then, that's our answer. Okay. -No pressure. -Right. Hey, guys, I was wondering if you've seen Seth. No. We were just looking for him ourselves. Okay, thanks. That was close. Maybe we should just keep this to ourselves for now. At least till we find out if we're breaking any laws. Hey, Dad. How was the party? I think somebody called the cops. Hey. What are you doing here? I called him. Thanks, DJ, I appreciate it. You mind if I join you? I never thought I'd leave this place. I guess... ...Iife doesn't always turn out the way you think it will, huh? I'll take that as pensive no. I'm sorry, Marissa. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry... ...I let you down. I'm sorry that l... ...I couldn't... ...give you the life... ...that you deserve. Although I nearly went to jail trying. You've got to give a guy credit for that. Sweetheart. Don't go. Please, don't go. Don't leave me. I gotta go. I gotta-- I gotta get a life. I know. I know. It stinks, but.... But listen, anytime you wanna come live with me... ...you just let me know, okay? And I will send a boat or a plane, whatever, okay? It's getting.... It's getting kind of cold. I think we should head back, huh? Want to get out of here? Wait. Could we just...? Could we just sit here for a while? Sure, kiddo. Put this on. You must be freezing. I'll sit with you all night. Hey. -Hi. -You okay? Yeah, I was just seeing my dad off. He left this morning. I'm sorry. -I brought bagels. -That's the secret password... ...into the Cohen house. Come on in. -Hi, sweetie. -Hey. -Hey. -Hey. Marissa brought bagels. Thank God. These ones are stale. -Yeah, I almost chipped a tooth. -Gather around, Marissa. I am going to teach you how to schmeer. He's an artist with cream cheese. -Well, thank you, honey. Slicer. -Slicer. -Cream cheese. -Cream cheese. You gonna be okay? Of course. We got bagels. Ah, yes, bagels.
