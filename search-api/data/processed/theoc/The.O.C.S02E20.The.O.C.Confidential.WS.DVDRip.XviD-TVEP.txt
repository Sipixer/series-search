How did Summer take the fact that Reed's a woman? I couldn't tell her even if I wanted to. I'm working with him on his comic book. Getting rid of Caleb, I'll do it. -I said I'd help you. -I'll pay you back. Some girl took drugs. She passed out in the pool. I gave them to her. I brought the drugs. -Hungry? -No. Me, neither. Dude, you cannot blame yourself, all right? All you did was give Trey a chance, and you believed in him. And it's like, look, whatever he did at Marissa's party, that's all on him. The thing is, I don't think he did. I mean, Trey's a lot of things, but I just don't think he's a drug dealer. So when cops asked, "Who's responsible for the girl floating in the pool? "... ...he was like, what, "I'm an ex-con on parole. I know, I'll say me. " I think when the cops went to put the cuffs on Marissa... ...he did that to stop them. -What makes you say that? -I was about to do the same thing. Yeah. Sure. The compulsive need to rescue Marissa Cooper. -lt must be in the Atwood DNA. -lt would explain a lot. The good news is, if he really didn't do it, then my dad will get him off. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I thought you'd be mad at me. Why would I be mad? I mean... -...you didn't do it, right? -No, man. No way. It's just when I saw them about to take Marissa, I had to do something. If gallantry and/or stupidity were defenses to felony-dealing charges... ...you'd be a free man. Hey, why don't you go get settled in the pool house. Wait, you're staying with us again? I am in Sandy's custody. It's the only way he could get the judge not to lock me up. -You couldn't get him off? -Well, you know the old expression: "No good deed goes unpunished. " Trey's facing hard time. I'm gonna go make some calls. -I gotta do something. -Okay. But the buddy-cop thing, I mean, that's just a metaphor. We're not actually supposed to solve crimes. He's my brother, I gotta help him. If that means finding the person that's responsible.... Going undercover in a high school sting operation? That would be very 21 Jump Street of you. -Whatever it takes. -Yeah. Okay. I get to be Richard Grieco. -How'd it go with Trey? -Well, he 's out of jail for the time being. By court order, he'll be at the Cohen halfway house until next week's hearing. -That is, as long as it's okay with you. -l' m guessing that he's there already. -Back in the pool house. -Is he okay? Well, all things considered. Well, I guess I'll tell Carter that we can't go to Santa Barbara then. Gee, I totally forgot about that. The winetasting weekend at Featherbrook. -You go. I'll stay with Trey. -No, no. That's no big deal. I mean, Carter can handle the vineyard story by himself. I don't think he's going by himself. He told me he was thinking of asking Erin. -Erin? Really. -Yeah, yeah. When I mentioned that you were bringing me along for the weekend... ...he thought it'd be fun to go as a foursome. Well, then, all the more reason for me to stay home with you. I certainly wouldn't wanna be a third wheel. Do you want a coffee? Honey, are you there? Yeah. I'll see you at home. Hurry up, sweetie. You're gonna be late for school. -That's it? -Well, yeah. It's almost 8:00. I don't get it. You trust me to have a few people for a birthday party, it turns into a rager... ...someone nearly drowns, and I don't even get punished? Well, you know, it's not your fault. These things can happen. Plus, if I punished you, I'd have to tell Caleb about it, wouldn't it? -Oh, so he's finally coming home. -Yes. Tonight. And I'm planning a special welcome-home celebration for him. Don't worry, it's a party for two. -Gross. -Personal sacrifices I make... ...to keep a roof over our heads are nobody's business but my own. Okay, really gross. All I'm asking is that we not mention any lesbian dalliances or bodies in the pool. I should stay with Summer tonight. That way you won't worry about me... ...slipping up with Caleb. And you can make all the personal sacrifices you want. Hi. -Where's Cohen? -Wouldn't know. -I'm avoiding him. -Because of the Reed thing? He deliberately led me to believe that she was a he. She, who happens to be cute and obsessed with his precious comic book. -Graphic novel. -Whatever. -He's a subdolous egomaniac. -Subdolous? It's from my word-of-the-day calendar. It means sneaky and underhanded, not to be trusted. Your ears must've been burning. Too bad they're not on fire. Just wait a second. This is for you. I keep the rest in a vase at my house. Every morning, I take one out, and I bring it to school... ...just hoping that I run into you, so I can apologize. That's actually kind of sweet. And to sweeten the mea culpa even a little bit further... ...guess who got you a ticket to Death Cab tonight? Hey, didn't you check your e-mail? Reed read your first draft of Atomic County. -And? -She loved it. -Okay. -Well, good. That means that this graphic-book thing's finally over? Not exactly. She has notes. -You said she loved it. -She does. Note-giving is just the publisher's way of showing creative investment in a project. She wanted to do it earlier, but we had school... ...so we're doing it later at her place. No. There's.... There's Death Cab. And I have, you know, Summer and Death Cab. -So.... -Seth, you can't blow this off. She's been working around our schedule already. Well.... Okay, can we meet up after, I guess? -I hear they play long sets. -Whatever, Mr. Subdolous. -Mr. Subdolous? -New villain. You should pitch it to Reed tonight. See you, buddy. Trey should've let me get arrested. It'd be a lot easier for Sandy to help me. Yeah, well, thinking before speaking, not exactly Trey's strong suit. So, what can we do? We can find out who brought the drugs to your party. You got any ideas? -Kyle Thompson. -That guy? I've never seen him before. Yeah, well, he's a senior and a water polo player. So you guys don't exactly run in the same circles. -Everyone says he's the guy to go to. -Looks like "Floater Girl" knows him. Who, Jess Sathers? I didn't know she was at my party until she nearly drowned in the pool. -So you know her? -Used to. Could you talk to her, find out if Kyle's the one who hooked her up? Yeah, I can try. -Hey, Jess. -Hey. -ls everything okay? -Y eah. Just.... I invited Erin up to the winetasting in Santa Barbara this weekend. After a week of not hearing from her, she leaves a message saying... ...she doesn't think it's a good idea to start seeing each other. -Did she say why? -No. Nothing. -I'm sorry. -Well, me too. I thought we hit it off at your dinner party. I even rented a '65 Mustang for the drive up there. You and Sandy wanna carpool? You'll have to cover the piece without me. -You're kidding. What happened? -Family emergency. Ryan's brother needs Sandy's help, so he'll be working all weekend. What about you? You can't peel away for an afternoon? Did I mention the vintage convertible? It's red. -I wish I could. -I'm sorry. I just hate drinking alone. Well, I hate drinking wine alone. Me too. Well, I will make sure to pick up a bottle of Featherbrook's finest. And I owe you guys a supper, so maybe we'll do that next week. Terrific. Have a great weekend. You too. Jess, hey. I just wanted to say how totally sorry I am for what happened at my party. -That was your house? -Yeah. -You okay? -Yeah. You know, just another war story. -Yeah, I got a few of those. -Right. I heard about your little incident in TJ last year. Not my finest moment. My parents were all over me after that. In fact, I don't really know anyone anymore, and.... Well, I was kind of wondering if maybe you could hook me up. A chance to party with the legendary Marissa Cooper? -You going to Death Cab tonight? -Yeah, totally. Look for me. I might know someone. How'd it go? I think it's on. I think you're right. Pick any restaurant you want. Sort of a welcome-home dinner. They're all Thai menus. We didn't do a lot of Thai food growing up. Somewhere in our heritage, a Cohen bagged himself some Asian action. -Seth. -You can't go wrong with pad Thai. In fact, actually, save some for me. I gotta go. -Where you going? -An inconvenient note session... ...in Silverlake. Ryan, delay Death Cab as long as you can. Also, give one of those flowers to Summer for me please. -What? -You guys going out tonight? Yeah. But if you wanna hang out when I get back-- I'm the one under house arrest. You don't gotta babysit me. -Hey, gang. -Hi. -Did you talk to the prosecutor? -Not yet. But I found out who it's gonna be, guy named Tom MacGinty. -You know him? -I know of him. He's a big lrish conservative. A real letter-of-the-law type. He's got about eight kids, six are daughters. Maybe that's a good thing. If he's a family man, maybe he's sympathetic. -Risk a drug dealer near his daughters? -I'm not a dealer. Oh, I know that. But he doesn't. -So you're saying I'm screwed. -No. What I'm saying is we're gonna have to start on your defense tonight. Thanks for making the drive. -I'm sure traffic out of Newport's a bitch. -No, the drive was no problem. We're just looking forward to hearing your thoughts. -Yeah. As quickly as possible, please. -Let's get started then. Okay. Overall, we're concerned about the universality of Atomic County. We' re a little worried kids in the heartland... -...they' re not gonna get this world. -Okay. Sure, sure. Except I know that, for me... ...Atomic's location was always sort of the backbone of the comic strip. I mean, that's why I thought you guys were interested in the first place. -We'll take a look at it. -Okay. Okay, okay. Also, we're wondering about Cosmo Girl. Her magic flask? Could she get her power from, like, a sports drink instead? Because Legal's worried about lawsuits from the parents of teen alcoholics. Oh, the lronist. Oh, boy, a little cerebral. Is he being ironic? Oh, I gotta take this. Y eah, go. -Who is that guy? -Oh, Damon's a marketing genius. We recruited him out of Fantagraphics. He's gonna make you very, very famous. As what, the worst comic book author ever? He is really good at what he does. And the party tomorrow night is his idea. -What party? -A party. That is awesome of you. He thought it would be good to introduce you to everyone. Get you with directors, musicians, animators for off-shoot projects. -Okay, that's great, but we're kind of-- -So there. Thank you. Bring your girlfriend. Everyone's dying to meet Little Miss Vixen. -Right. Little Miss Vixen's a character-- -I'll be right back. Yeah. Summer's gonna kill me. I say we walk right now. No. We've come too far to blow this. Even if those were good ideas, which they're not... ...that re-write would take me a year. I can't do that. -Summer and I would be over by then. -That's why you bring her to the party. Make her a part of the process. Include her in this. -You really think that's a good idea? -Definitely. Will you tell me again about Marissa's party? Who'd you talk to? Besides Ryan's friends? I don't know, a couple girls. The girl in the pool? Maybe. Well, the police report has an eyewitness claiming that she saw you and Jess... ...enter a room and close the door. Okay. Look, Jess and l, we hit it off a little. You know, talked and stuff, but.... Truth is, I thought we were gonna go back to my place and hook up. Next thing I know, the cops have arrived and she was face down in a pool. Did you see Jess take any drugs? No. But it was-- It was clear she was on them. -Where'd she get them? -There was this one guy... ...I heard he was passing out pills. -You think you might recognize him? -I don't know. You know, he looked like every other kid in this town. Tall, tan, and a face you just wanna... -...flatten. -Do any of these names ring a bell? Maybe she mentioned somebody or said something about somebody? No. No. Look, I just wanted to help Marissa out. Okay? Nobody's ever thrown me a birthday party. I wasn't gonna let her go to jail for it. I can't believe Seth is missing his favorite band. It's one thing blowing me off, but blowing off Death Cab? This comic book has totally broken him. -You seen Jess yet? -Jess? Jess Sathers? Why you looking for that coke whore? What? She is. Marissa Cooper, are you doing coke? What? No. -No, we're-- -We're helping Trey. Helping him what, score? -Stay out of prison. I'm gonna do a lap. -lf you see her, let me know. Or Kyle. Or Seth. Julie? I'm up here. Would you come down here, please? Why don't you come up here? Welcome home, sailor. -What's all this? -What does it look like? It looks like one of your movies. That's not funny. Not supposed to be. I spent the last few weeks trying to get past... ...the incident. Turns out I can't. I've missed you. After all this time, I was hoping maybe you missed me too? Cancel whatever spa treatment you booked tomorrow. -We need to have a serious discussion. -About what? I have a meeting with my lawyers in the morning. We'll talk after that. Lawyers? What exactly are you saying? I'll let my attorney talk for me. I mean, where other than the Bait Shop are tickets always plentiful... ...and the band never too loud to talk over? Cohen is missing it. Hello? Here comes your girl. -Oh, no, I'm blanking. Say something. -What? Oh, my God, Jess! Hi. Remember me? Summer Roberts. We had tap and jazz together in fourth grade. Shuffle-ball-change. -Right. -Don't mind my friend. She's really, really stoned. Totally. Very, very high. Isn't this place, like, so visual? -So do you wanna go sit down? -Can't. Looking for a friend. The kind who could hook me up? Actually, he lost his stash last weekend. But he's taking orders for tomorrow night. You want in? -Definitely. -Water Polo's throwing a party. We can meet up there. Here's the address. Cash only. No problem. How about you? Oh, no. Strictly ganja. Yeah, what's from the earth is of the greatest worth. -I'm gonna kill you. -I hope you know what you're doing. How is he? Oh, he's scared. He's frustrated. It turns out Trey knew the girl in the pool. Police have an eyewitness to confirm it. -That's not good. -None of it is. I gotta keep this from a trial, but there's no way that prosecutor will cut a deal. That's because he only knows Trey on paper. Oh, honey... ...you're a genius. -I am? -Yeah, a genius. What are you working on? Notes for the winetasting article. Something to keep Carter focused after his seventh pinot... ...since he will be attending unchaperoned. What happened with Erin? It didn't work out. That's too bad. I thought those two were a match. Honey, this is gorgeous. You should go up there with Carter. I should be here. Well, there's nothing you can do for Trey. He knows you're behind him. I guess if we leave early enough, we could be back in time for dinner. I'll make the dinner, you bring the wine. Man, it's packed in here tonight. Oh, hey. Don't I know you? From that house party last weekend? -I don't think so. -Kyle, right? Man, that party was out of control. I heard some chick almost OD'd in the pool. -ls that right? -Yeah. Good night, O.C.! I cannot believe I missed Death Cab. Just kill me. Shoot me in the face. Speaking of which, is Summer around? I need your help. I have a little quagmire to un-quag. What? Oh, is that the guy? Is that--? Hey, are you on a bust right now? Holy-- Dude, what can I do? -Just give me a job-- -Stay out of it. I wanna help. Really sorry about that. Well, they're not that way, that's the ocean, so.... There he is. So what do we say? You say nothing. You stay right here. Big Mac. -T om MacGinty. -Sandy Cohen. Sandy Cohen? Why do I know that name? I've been trying to get in touch the last several days through the DA's office. I represent Trey Atwood. -What is this, an ambush? -No. No, no, no. -Just hoping we can put together a deal. -The kid was caught dealing on parole. -You know something I don't? -Yeah. You got the wrong guy. We got his confession. We got witnesses placing him with the girl who OD'd... ...and ecstasy matching her tox screen recovered at the scene. -Check it for fingerprints. -Trey. I never touched it, so my fingerprints won't be on it. You're right. No one's are. And who'd know that, except the guy who wiped the bag clean. Not another word, Trey. Two years probation. Plus 1 00 hours of community service. That kid is looking at least a year for the parole violation alone. None of those other kids even have a traffic ticket. So unless you've got another suspect for me, there's not gonna be a deal. Except for my hair issues, great call on the convertible. Well, that's the way the California coast was meant to be seen. And your hair looks great. Liar. For your punishment, I control the radio on the way home. No. No one who has won on American Idol ever sings in my car. Consider yourself lucky. If it was Sandy, you'd listen to torch songs, show tunes. Preferable. Members of the press, honored guests... ...I'd like to welcome you to my family's winery. Unfortunately, my grandfather, Chief Featherbrook, is in poor health... ...and will be unable to join us this afternoon. That's a shame. I was hoping to get a glimpse of the old guy. I think he's a marketing gimmick, like the Jolly Green Giant. Hey, maybe we can turn this article into an exposé. --mountain range running east to west, rather than north to south. My grandfather's convinced it's what gives the grape its unique flavor. Hail to the chief. I can't believe your big apology dinner has turned... ...into a make-me-even-madder party in Silver-Hell. You know, if a cab ride home didn't cost $300, I would so be out of here. Listen, I understand that you're here on false pretenses. I was sort of hoping once we got here you would try and make the best of it. -Hey, guys. Come in. -Hey. Everyone, the man of the hour has arrived. Allow me to introduce to you the architect... ...and illustrator of Atomic County, Seth Cohen. -His creative partner, Zach. -Nice to meet you. And, of course, Little Miss Vixen, herself. -Dude. -Hey. Joe Sacco's in the kitchen right now. He wants to meet you. Of The Fixer? No. I don't know, what do you say to somebody like that? The guy's a legend. And he's a big fan of yours, and he's about to leave, so.... Just go. -You wanna go get a drink? -Yes. I lost track of time. You guys ready for dinner? Actually, we need to talk to you. -Sure. -Wait, wait. No matter what happens... ...I just wanna thank you for the work you've done. Nobody's ever gone out on a limb like this for me. Time and time again. I'll never forget it. You're talking like we're already defeated. Look, I'll admit there's a lot of work to be done, but it ain't over till it's over. All due respect, I was there too. I know I'm going down. Oh, look... ...I know things look bad. But now is not the time to give up. No, we're not. We.... We know who the dealer is. -Who? -A guy at school. -Well, we're gonna need proof. -I think we can get it. Tonight. Can we talk? I just need a drink. I got whiskey. Make yourself at home. So Caleb's been behind closed doors all day with his lawyers. As of tonight, it's over for me. Me and my girls are out on the street with nothing. -No prenup? -A porn scandal more than nullifies it. Caleb's old. His health is not good. I know a guy that can get some pills. I can switch his medicine while you're out of town. No one will suspect. Then you can live the life you deserve. And never worry about anybody taking that away from you ever again. You're serious, aren't you? As a heart attack. What are you doing? I'm writing you a check. You don't gotta pay me to kill your husband. It's not for that. It's to get you out of town. I'm not a murderer, neither are you. I never should have come. Well, good luck, babe. Goodbye, Lance. You know... ...they should implement the bucket concept in fast-food chains. All the flavor, none of the calories. You're sick. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. We look forward to your reviews. How many wines have we tasted? According to my notes... ...I stopped taking notes. Well, should we fire ourselves for drinking on the job? Drinking was the job. And I did my job really well, because I'm hammered. You can't be, you have to drive. I'm not driving. Are you kidding? With the cliffs and the oceans and the winding roads? No way. You drive. Oh, no, no. I can't drive. I have had as much to drink as you have, and I'm half the size-- -Oh, I'm sorry. -Point well taken. Yeah. Excuse me. Yes, it's okay. It'll be all right. Could you possibly find a driver for us tonight? We failed to make proper use of the silver bucket. -Are you staying locally? -No. Orange County, actually. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Y eah. But I could offer you a guest suite if you'd like to stay here tonight. What do you think? Should we expense it? I guess we don't have a choice. -Whose list are you on? -Jess'. Marissa Cooper. -You on Jess' list too? -No. Then you can't come in. Sorry, dog. Meet me around the side of the house. This really is the dark side. Any sign of Kyle? No. But he probably shouldn't see you here. Come on. Hey, Marissa! -Oh, my God, you came. -Hey, Jess. -You look so beautiful tonight. -Thanks. You're in a good mood. -Candy flipping. -Candy flipping? Yeah, ecstasy and mushrooms. Good for the body and the mind. -Sounds perfect. -Come with me, girly-girl. Where have you been? We had plans to talk. I'm here now. Let's talk. Are you sure you don't want to shower or something? You may not believe this... ...but I put everything I had into this marriage. I wanted it to work just as much as you did. Oh, I doubt that. No one hates to fail more than I do. But here we are. Just say it Caleb. You want a divorce. These real tears? No one's more surprised than me. All right, then... -...I'll give it one more chance. -What? Standing here, I realize I still have feelings for you. I owe it to both of us to explore that. I don't know what to say. "Thank you," I suppose. Put on something nice. I'll take you to dinner. -It's ruined. I'm sorry. -Oh, that's okay. Should we drink to its demise? Defeats the purpose of sobering up, doesn't it? Yeah. But there's a minibar. I should call Sandy. Yeah. And I should take a shower. I smell like a fermented grape. I have a confession. I was gonna take off tonight. Get out of town, never look back. Well, legal problems of this nature have a way of resurfacing. The only way to deal with them is head on. -Yeah, that's what Ryan said. -He's a smart kid. -Yeah. You all right? -I'm sorry I didn't call earlier. -I couldn't get a signal. -That's okay. You guys on the road? Neither of us are actually in the right shape to drive just yet, so.... A little too much lndian spirit, huh? Well, drive back in the morning. -Are you sure? -Y eah. I mean, it's not worth dying over. I don't want either of you behind the wheel if you've been drinking. I love you. You know, I gotta tell you something. I don't know many men who'd let their wife spend the night with another guy... ...no less suggest it. How many men you know been married for 20 years? -I'm sorry to disturb you. -Oh, you're not. It's fine. I was able to locate a car if you still needed one. That's.... -Can I call you? -Certainly. The number's on the back... -...if you'd like to call directly. -Thank you. You know, I just think that the cross-promotional opportunities... ...for Atomic County are endless. We're talking fast food tie-ins, action figures, NASCAR. -NASCAR? -Kids are into body sprays these days. A different scent for each character. It's never too early to start developing multi-media franchises. Right. What do you mean? Atomic County online. Video games. -My own video game? -This time next year... ...why not Atomic County TV show? -That's not so bad. -Seth. -I need to talk. -One second. Do you think--? Are you talking about animation or live action? Why not a hybrid? -Why not a hybrid? -Seth. -One second. -You did not just give me the finger. -I didn't give you "the" finger. -Look... -...Seth, I want to go home now. -Why? Are you not having fun? No, I'm not. These people are annoying. They think they are so smart and cool with their messy hair... ...and their dirty clothes that they bought that way. They play their retro board games, and they drink wine for fun. I'd like to make a toast. T o Seth and his subversive vision, and those that inspire it... -...the Little Miss Vixens of the world. -God save us all. -Here, here. -It's fun. It's fun. It's a good time. Cheers. I don't see why you're so mad. You didn't make any effort. They asked you to join the conver-- Hey, Zach, can I have a ride home? -Yeah, sure. -Thank you. Zach, what are you doing? Goodbye, Cohen. -Seth, we need you. -Summer-- Come on in, we're playing board games. -I smell a tie-in. -No, stop. Right? You follow me? -Let's go, everybody. -What are we playing? We're going to the boardroom. Nothing like five-star water pressure. -You okay? -Yeah, I just-- It's a little-- It's the wine. There's a "hers" bathrobe and some fuzzy slippers in the closet. You wanna take a shower? Carter... ...they found a car for us. Well, that's a good thing, right? I need to go home. Yeah. Okay. I'll go get dressed. What's happening? They're outside, talking. Open your hand. One at a time. And drink tons of water. Oh, and stay away from the GHB on this. Trust me. It's 80, right? Kyle thinks you're cute. He only wants 60 and an introduction. Come on. Ryan? Reinforcements are on their way. You be careful. -What did he say? -We're on. Hey, look. I just wanted to thank you for hooking me up. -But I kind of have a boyfriend, so.... -I kind of don't care. Back off, man, she's with me. You need to get out of here, bitch. This is a private party. Hope you enjoyed it. It's probably gonna be your last. -Go back inside. -You're a narc? Don't move. Stay where you are. -This the kid you saw last week? -Yeah, it's him. -You all right? -Getting used to it. -You're under arrest for possession.... -Whose is that? That's not mine. He planted it on me! That kid's a liar! You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided. I'll file a motion to dismiss charges on Monday. -Thanks for doing this, T om. -Thanks for ambushing me. You ready to go home? It's past my bedtime. Actually, I was kind of hoping to spend the night at my place tonight. We can drop you off. Mr. Cohen. All right. -Thanks, little brother. -No, Marissa's the one... -...who deserves the credit for this. -Let's just call it even. So.... Been a while since.... -Since we were-- -Alone? -Yeah. Without, you know, something-- -Or someone. -Guess we can do whatever we want. -Well, what do you wanna do? Wait, wait. We've waited a really long time for this. -Do you wanna stop? -No, I just.... I think we can do better than the front seat of Sandy's car. I know a guy who has a pool house all to himself. You think he'd let us borrow it? Oh, yeah. What are you doing here? -I think you have some idea. -Yeah, breaking and entering. How do you know I'm not working for the cops? I asked around. -You really are just out of jail. -And I'm not looking to go back. So you took the fall for Marissa Cooper and then did what you had to do. The only thing I can't figure out is why you didn't turn me in. Well, the cops are only looking for one suspect. And I figured you had a rough enough week as it was. And besides... ...I like talking to you. Yeah? Well, I like talking to you too. And now with Kyle out of the picture,
