with my sister? I don't have feelings for Johnny. - Last one in! - Kaitlin! - I could go for a drink. - You read my mind. Actually, I was hoping you might have dinner with me sometime. Neil, I would love to. You disrespected me, and the company I'm trying to build. That guy from Brown, he didn't say they couldn't take more than one student. - Well, this might be the year. - That's right. Hey, baby, have you seen my lucky tie? I got it dry-cleaned. - You're an angel. - Big day? Well, I gotta sign some papers, make a few calls, build a hospital. Building a hospital, wow. Well, Caleb deserves most of the credit. I just inherited the project. - So who's paying for it? - Newport Laguna Medical Center board. They commissioned a proposal from us and from a firm in Brea. Today we're both presenting. - And they're gonna pick you. - Well, now that I got my lucky tie. - Hey. - Hello. Hi. Are you okay? You seemed a little distracted last night. Yeah. No, I'm fine. I don't think that convinced anyone. I was leaving school yesterday... ...and Mrs. Rushfield said some Brown rep called and wants to interview me Sunday. That's great. Why didn't you say anything? I don't know. I guess it just needed to sink in. Did Summer get her interview? I forgot to ask, actually. I was just kind of spinning. You want me to help you out? Maybe ask you a few questions? Yeah. Matt's waiting for me right now, but when I get back, let's talk. - We'll practice whatever you need. - Yeah. - Gotta go. - Oh, I better go too. Julie and I have a meeting with a client. - I am so proud of you. - Thanks. Sure you're all right, man? Yeah, it's just kind of weird. There I am, and I'm all ready to go... ...and I got my watch set to East Coast time... ...then I get this interview and it kind of hit me. - Like, I'm leaving Newport. - So you're having second thoughts. Dude, I planned my first escape on an Etch A Sketch. This is my dream. It's just... I don't know, now it's real. Why don't you talk to Summer. I'm sure she's freaking out too. No, I'm fine. Seriously, this is just my process. Fair enough. You're pouring coffee in your cereal. Newport, I hardly knew you. - Cohen! I got one. - Hey, Summer. An interview with the Brown guy. Rushfield told me. You got one too. Oh, yeah, that's great. Great? Mrs. Rushfield said they only interview people they're serious about. This totally increases our chances of getting in together. - Show some excitement. - No, it's amazing, it's just... - Are you feeling any anxiety about this? - About what? Leaving Newport, your friends and family, and going somewhere new in September? - Yeah, honestly, I was. - Really? Because... - Then I talked to Colonel Flint. - Who? My boot-camp instructor. He's a former Delta. He says you can either ride change or change rides you. Also, there's no room in the trenches of life for whiny little babies. - Wanna see my war face? - It's not necessary. I gotta go. But it's not September. Freshman orientation starts August 25th. - Bye. - Bye. Situated as it is, the hospital will provide ready access... ...to Newport's affluent and less affluent neighborhoods, the whole community. More detailed budgets and schedules are in your folders. Along with copies of the permits we've pulled. We know you have another proposal to hear. You should know we're ready to start any time. Just give us the green light. Well, you two have done a great job. - I only wish Caleb could've been here. - Thanks, Bill. This project was close to his heart. He did have one, as it turns out. We'll contact you when we've made our decision. Now we wait. What? I took a look at Brea Group's plan this morning. I didn't wanna tell you because I didn't wanna spook you. - So? - It's good. - Better than ours? - They're both excellent. But the Brea Group... ...has been wining and dining Bill Merriam and the board for months. - I mean, dinner, concerts, cruises. - We offered bagels when they came. I'm worried that we've handicapped ourselves. I said I wouldn't do business by plying people with meals and gifts. And I respect that. I do. But what it could all come down to is who Bill Merriam likes more. Well, hopefully he'll appreciate the fact that we appealed to his intelligence... ...and not to his taste for pinot. Here's a picture with Kaitlin. But what's wrong with this horse? That's China. She has alopecia. She looks like a giant Chihuahua. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. Kaitlin turns 15 this weekend, and I'm putting together an album. Oh, that's nice of you. She hasn't been home for one since she was 12, so I've got a few to make up for. As long as it comes with diamond earrings, I'm sure Kaitlin will be happy. My parents went overboard on Kaitlin's birthdays when she was little. It always made Summer a little jealous. I need a coffee. Anyone else? - What is it? - It's just, looking at these old photos... I mean, is this really the same girl who stole money from a fraternity... ...and then lied about paying for an abortion? I feel like I don't even know her anymore. Families can be like that. People change on you. This is your chance to know the new Kaitlin. I guess. I mean, otherwise, she goes back to school... ...and I have to go to college, and that's it. Cirque du Soleil? Yeah, what's wrong with that? Most people I know just had a clown at their birthday party. My mom went all out. We had presents, games, a petting zoo. And honestly, the best part was always the afterparty. My whole family together. We'd stay up late and eat cake and watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i> Sing along. Oh, you mean like: - <i>"I am 16 going on 17"?</i> - Yeah. Except, however old I was turning, we'd always put in the ages. I guess as long as we still do that, the rest doesn't really matter. So have you told Marissa that we're hanging out? No. You're not gonna tell her, are you? Not much chance of that. Now that she's at Harbor... I haven't talked to her since your mom's party. You mean since we had our midnight swim? You mean since you had your swim and I got you a towel. Most guys would have taken advantage of me. Yeah, I guess I'm old-fashioned. That's what I like about you. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna get me for my birthday. Julie. I am so sorry to keep you waiting. A procedure ran long. Oh, no, no, it's fine, Neil. It's just... I have to pick up Marissa from school in a few minutes. Oh, no. Well, let's enjoy the time that we have. I'm just happy we're finally meeting. After you postponed twice, I thought maybe you'd changed your mind. No, I just kept thinking about the fact that our daughters are best friends... ...I'm a recent widow, you're just out of a marriage. So, what finally tipped the scale? I felt something. Me too. - I'm so sorry. I really have to go. - Oh, no, no. I got this. How about dinner Sunday night? I know this terrible burger joint. Even the owner avoids it. We'll be totally alone. Sunday then. Hey. - I came to see how you're doing. - Hey, Dad. It's amazing to think that you'll be leaving in a few months. Yeah, and I'm freaking out. For years, I've been talking about how much I wanna get out of here... ...and then as soon as it's time, I'm all like, "No. No, I'm not ready." No, what you're feeling is totally natural. I felt it. Leaving the Bronx for California... I was terrified about fitting in. I spent a month practicing how to say "dude." You still say it kind of... Look, you're about to begin this great adventure... ...and you have no idea what's gonna happen. I just don't feel like it's the beginning. I feel like things are coming to an end. I'm sorry. It's the hospital board. Bill. How you doing? I'm gonna go take a walk. Good idea. Clear your head. I'll talk to you when you get back. I'm sorry. So are we building a hospital? Hey, Kaitlin. Anyone home? Me and Mom got takeout. Hey, sweetie. Did Marissa tell you? We got Thai takeout. We're doing dinner Ã  la Cohen. - That sounds great. I love Thai. - Oh, you know what? I got a menu from an Armenian place. You can order from there Sunday night. I have a business dinner. It's totally annoying. - Sunday? - Mom? We've got plans Sunday. What are you talking about? We don't have plans. We do. We were gonna order in food, watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i> The Sound of Music? Why would...? Oh, my God, baby. I totally forgot. Sunday's your birthday. But if it's business, you can totally reschedule, right? - I can totally reschedule. - You know what, why bother? - Kaitlin. - No, seriously. I hardly even remembered, myself. I'm gonna go meet a friend because I'm not even hungry. Kaitlin, wait. Oh, Sandy, you wanna tell the boys that dinner's almost ready? Sure, but Seth's taking a walk. He'll be back soon. - What's wrong? - Oh, Bill Merriam called. They're going with the group in Brea. Oh, I'm sorry. - I just really wanted this project. - Is it too late for a new approach? No, we took our shot. I don't want a contract if we have to get it by plying some guy with Kobe beef. If that's what you think would convince him, I think you're selling yourself short. - What do you mean? - I just know that when you wooed me... ...there was no caviar and champagne and you did all right. I should take Bill Merriam out for pizza and bad wine in the back of a mail truck. I mean, show him who you are beyond schedules and budgets. And who knows? Maybe he loves pizza. Hey. Kaitlin? What are you doing here? Are you...? - Are you smoking pot? - Yeah, why? You a cop? No, but l... You know, I mean... Relax. Nobody here's gonna bust me. - You want some? - No, I'm okay. I'm good, thanks. You sure? It helps take the edge off, and I could tell you could use it. Yeah, well, I was saving the whole drug thing for college. Plus, my dad smoked pot at Berkeley, so it's pretty much ruined for me. - Where'd you get that? - School. This girl grows it in her closet. - What made you decide to...? - My mom forgot my birthday. Yeah. That whole time that I was gone, I kept telling myself that: "You're paranoid. They're not gonna forget about you." Wrong. Well, you know what? I'm sure your mom feels really bad. But that's not the point. Can you imagine growing up with Marissa Cooper as your older sister? My birthday was the one day I could count on being noticed. Not anymore. Kaitlin. - Please don't say anything. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. We just bumped into each other. Two ships passing. Come on, please, can we go home now? Mom feels terrible. Fine. Well, I'll see you. Offer stands. You know where to find me. Kaitlin, your phone. Johnny? Oh, Marissa, hey. Hey. Were... Are you calling Kaitlin? No, I was calling you... ...but your phone didn't ring, so I figured I'd give hers a try. What are you doing? Hey, it's Johnny. It's for me. What's up? It seemed like we hadn't talked for a while. I know. What are you doing tonight? Because we were all gonna go out. Oh, thanks, but I'm gonna be with a friend. Hey, listen, my mom needs me. Let me call you later? Okay. Bye. So anytime a guy calls, it's for you? What are you talking about? I mean, it was for me. Forget it. Kaitlin, I know you're upset about last night, but... - And I'm bored talking about it. - Okay, well... ...we're going out tonight to the Bait Shop if you wanna come. I can't. I'm meeting friends. I'm gonna go take a shower. Hello? So how do you feel about going to the Bait Shop tonight? - Julie. What a surprise. Come in. - Hi, Neil. Is Summer here? No, I think she's at Seth's. Okay, well, is there any chance... ...that we could have dinner tonight instead of tomorrow night? Unfortunately, I'm working. You're not gonna cancel on me, are you? Tomorrow's Kaitlin's birthday. I can't believe it slipped my mind. I'd like to give her a small party. I guess it'd have to be small. I live in a trailer. I hope you understand. - Why don't you have it here. - What? There's plenty of room. Girls can use the pool. And I get to see you. What do you say? - I say... - Wonderful. Here's a key. You can let yourself in, do all the prep you need. I've got a couple of minutes. Why don't I give you a tour. Come on. All right, Summer, this one's for you. Ready? - Yeah, I'm listening. - Okay. Who's been the greatest influence in your intellectual development? Miuccia Prada. You probably wanna say somebody more like Einstein or... - So you want me to lie? - No, I just... I don't think that Prada is the answer that they're looking for. Well, this interview could determine the rest of our lives, right? If I say something I don't believe in, I could end up with the wrong life. How awful would that be? She has a point. - I have to go get a mani-pedi. - Summer. Cohen, if you wanna memorize answers you think they wanna hear, that's fine. But I believe in being myself. By the way, Miuccia Prada combined styles from time periods... ...in ways people never even imagined possible. Her clothes teach you to change your perspective. I think she'll be fine. - Where do you see yourself in 10 years? - Where do I see myself in 10 years? That's a good question. Okay. More than anything, you know what I would like? I would like the happiness that I have right now. Although, I guess, what are the chances of that? You go through life, and you'll only be able to look back... ...and pinpoint like two or three times where you were genuinely happy... ...and in those moments you wouldn't have appreciated it. Who does, right? So where do I see myself in 10 years? I guess, what I would like is... I'd like to be right here, you know? Right now, in this moment. And not because I'm afraid of uncertainty, because I'm not. It's just, you know, I was taught that when you have something good... ...what you're supposed to do is you hang on to it, you know? You hang on to it with both hands. If somebody tries to take that from you, what you should do... ...is you should make sure that they pry it from your cold, dead fingers. Yeah. - Let's take a break. - Oh, God. I'll get you some water. Hey, I told you to stop coming in on Saturdays. Look who's talking. Listen, give Bill Merriam a call... ...and tell him we'd like to take him out tomorrow. This is a good idea. I know they haven't given Brea the word. So, what should I do? Set up a tee time? Reservation at The Arches? - You ever eaten at El Pavo Loco? - No. - That a new restaurant? - It's a burrito stand. We'll take him on a tour... ...of neighborhoods around the hospital. - You're kidding. The Brea Group's hospital is smack in an exclusive area. Ours would serve more people. - I wanna bring that home. - Sandy... I know it's not how the rest of the world does business. Okay. I'll tell Bill Merriam that he'll have a day he'll never forget. - Cheers. - Cheers. How's it going with Kaitlin? Well, I mean, she was pretty upset. I invited her out... Kaitlin? Oh, my God, Marissa. I totally forgot you were gonna be here. Okay, well, what are you two doing? We're just hanging out. So don't freak out or anything. Yeah, we probably should've mentioned it. So you two are just hanging out? Well, yeah. He took me home from the party, remember? Then we had a chance to talk. Went for a swim. - Actually... - I asked you to drive my sister home... ...and you went for a midnight swim? - No, look, I just got her a towel. Who were you really calling this morning, me or her? I knew she was gonna freak out like this. I'm not freaking out. I just don't like being lied to. Whatever. Can you take me home? I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. You all right? Yeah, I just... I don't see why they couldn't tell me the truth. Come on. Watching Marissa get jealous? Admit it felt good. She wasn't jealous. She was so jealous. Seeing us together. - Kaitlin, I'm not sure about this. - But I thought you liked me. I do, but... Okay, look, even if you weren't Marissa's sister... ...I'm 17, you're 14. - Fifteen tomorrow. - Still. Fine. I get it. No, look... ...I wanna keep hanging out. But as friends, okay? It will make Marissa mad. I can live with that. - Hey. - Oh, my God. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I know it seems weird... ...me loitering in the shadows. It's okay. I had a feeling you'd come around. - Hey. Top of the morning. - Hey. So today's the day, huh? Yeah. Interview's not till this afternoon. Well, your mother's making pancakes. Come on down. I already ate. Plus, I just wanna go over some of this stuff. At a certain point, cramming becomes counterproductive. Do something to relax. I was thinking that myself. You're gonna do great. Happy birthday. Look, Kaitlin, I know you think I overreacted or whatever... ...but Johnny's just a lot older than you. I don't wanna see you get hurt. Oh, please. Like that's really why you got mad. What's that supposed to mean? Hey. Look at that. My two little girls. Or should I say, two young women? Happy birthday, sweetie. Oh, gross, Mom. You're all sweaty. I know, I'm sorry. I was running. After years of doing Cardio Barre and yogalates, I forgot how good this feels. - I got three honks. - That's great, Mom. Okay, so tonight, not only have I planned an amazing dinner... ...but Dr. Roberts said that we could have it at his house. Dr. Roberts offered you his house? Yeah, well, I ran into him yesterday... ...and I mentioned it was Kaitlin's birthday, and voilÃ . He couldn't take no for an answer. He's so generous. Whoever gets him is a very lucky woman. You know, I don't want a birthday dinner. What are you talking about? He said we could watch... ...The Sound of Music on his plasma. - Maybe next year. Oh, honey, I am so sorry that I forgot your birthday. Ever since Caleb's death, things have been a little crazy. But we really need this as a family. Please? - Only if I can invite a friend. - No. Isn't it better if it's just family and the Roberts? Well, it's Kaitlin's birthday. She can have whoever she wants. Maybe we should invite your friends from the equestrian club. Sure. Sounds great. - Bye. - Okay. Bye, honey. Marissa, I'm gonna need you to help me set up. Please? I need to make this up to Kaitlin. - Fine. - Okay, thanks. Oh, sorry about the sweat. I am 16 going on 17... Knock, knock. Hey. You and Marissa. It's like the perfect couple. You know, people used to say that about her and Luke. - Life's weird, huh? - Yeah. - What's up? - I need your advice. My mom's throwing a party for me tonight. Of course you're invited. But do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny? No, why would she mind? Well, she seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night. But they're just friends... ...so why would it matter if we hang out, if they're just friends? Kaitlin, what are you trying to do? Just make everybody happy. I told you. Because it seems like you're mad at Marissa... ...and you're looking for a way to hurt her. What are you talking about? Marissa's my sister, and I love her. Then why don't you talk to her instead of trying to stir something up? You know, I'm sorry that you feel that way. But Johnny's my friend, and I want him at my party. It's just... That look on her face when she saw us... But I don't have to tell you about that, do I? See you tonight. Thank you so much for your help, Kiki. God knows I have my talents. Cooking is not one of them. It was nice of Neil to lend you his house. - Yes, he is a gentleman. - Is he? Kirsten, please. We've hardly had a real date. We haven't even kissed. But he offered his house for Kaitlin's birthday. - I'd say that's a good sign. - It is a beautiful house. I think he could change the marble in the entrance hall, and the furniture... Julie, since you haven't kissed yet, you might wanna hold off on redecorating. Oh, yeah, just making conversation. - Should I take this out? - Yeah, please. Great. Thank you. Here you go. Newport's finest churro. Thanks, Sandy. I don't remember the last time I walked this much. Well, the hospital would service a wide variety of neighborhoods. - I wanted you to get a sense of that. - Mission accomplished. I told you how the free clinic might operate? Twice. But if you don't mind, I think I need a little break from the hospital. All right. We're losing him. - Let's do it your way. - Yeah, you sure? The truth is, the tour worked more on me than it did on him. I'm not gonna rob this community of something it needs just... Just so I can sleep easier. So come on. Bill. It's dinnertime. Where would you like to go? Marissa, you should come in. The water's great. Yeah, I'd love to, but I'm helping set up for your party. And I'm so grateful. Marissa, Kaitlin, look who's here. - Hi, Dr. Roberts. - Hey, Marissa. Kaitlin, don't you think you should say thank you for Dr. Roberts' hospitality? Thank you for letting me use your house for my party. You are so welcome. Johnny! You came. My little girl is growing up. Yeah, and she wants everyone to see it too. - Mom, this is Johnny. - Of course. This is Dr. Roberts. This is his house. - Hey, Johnny. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, Marissa. - Hi. Oh, look, I got you all wet. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go see if Kirsten needs help. - Seth? Hey, man. - Yes? Yes. Jeez, man, I'm co... - Something's blocking the door. - Okay. Just calm down. "I gotta get in right now." I'm coming. I got... Do something real f... Yeah, that's perfect. - What's that? - Okay. God. Listen, hey, man, I'm sorry. There's a laundry buildup right there. Jeez. It's almost 3:30. Isn't your interview at 4? What are you talking about? Hey, how did that happen? - Well, are you ready? - Am I ready? Do me a favor. Go ahead and feel that. - Feel that puppy right there. - No, I don't wanna feel... You don't wanna touch another man. I get it, I get it. You find my slender swimmer's body intimidating. - Something smells. - It doesn't. No, it doesn't, but they say the first sign... ...of a brain tumor is phantom smells, so you should lie down. Hey, hey. You solved it. You figured it out. That's... You're a mystery-solver. You're like Encyclopedia Brown. Remember? When Encyclopedia Brown, he went on down to Texas... ...to solve the mystery of the great shootout. Hey, how about this for a change? How about in a cage match... ...Encyclopedia Brown versus The Great Brain. To the death. Are you high? Am I high? No. No. Come on, man. I love when you go for the comedy. But I would not quit your day job beating up people. I wouldn't. I don't know how that got there. - Hello? - Hey, Summer. - Are you at the interview yet? - Yeah, I'm about to go in. Can you stretch yours out a bit? Seth's gonna be late. Sure. What happened? I need to bring him down to earth. We'll be there soon, okay? Okay. Bye. Seth? Hey, man. Got some coffee. I want you to drink it, okay? Dude, I am not stoned anymore. Okay. Then why are you in my shower? - How did that happen? - Just drink the coffee. Dude, all right, I'm fine. The guy's gonna think I'm Rupert the Monkey Boy. How long you been doing this, man? It's pot. Aren't you overreacting a little bit? You were doing it alone, in secret. It's different. This is the first time, I swear. And this is really just stress about leaving? Two years ago, this miracle happened to me, okay? You showed up and Summer started talking to me, and my life changed. I'd be leaving that for someplace new... ...and it'd be really easy for things to go back to the way they were. It wasn't a miracle. You got up on that coffee cart and told her you loved her. You've changed. You're gonna be fine wherever you go. Now, tell me you weren't stupid enough to buy the pot down at the pier. Half those guys are narcs. No, it was nothing like that. Don't get her in trouble with Marissa, but, actually, I got it from Kaitlin. Thank God. Do you realize I've been in there for an hour and a half? - What took you so long? - He needed to calm down. Why don't you head on in and meet us at Summer's when you're done. - Yeah. - Okay. No pressure. But if you mess it up, our future together is ruined. - Hey. - People I know. Hi. After Kirsten left, I had no one to talk to. This is a good turnout, though. Yeah, well, my mom invited Kaitlin's old riding club. Probably shouldn't have bothered. Summer. - Excuse me. Okay, guys? - Yeah. - Sweetheart, how'd your interview go? - It went great. Everything all right? Yeah, well, remember when I said I wanted to get to know Kaitlin? Be careful what you wish for. In that case, there's something I should tell you about her and Seth. What are we doing here? I told you. Looking for my presents. Your presents are all downstairs. Not all of them. - Kaitlin, look, I told you... - That you're 17 and that I'm 14. But I'm not 14 anymore, remember? - But someone could come in, we should... - You wanna lock the door? - What are you planning on doing to me? - Very funny. Or is it you're afraid Marissa will come in? She sees you with her little sister, and then you really don't have a chance. - What are you talking about? - Look, you said that you liked me. Now we're only two years apart. So unless there's something else... - I'm not interested in Marissa, all right? - Then prove it. One birthday kiss. You know, I think we better get back to the party. You can't stop me. I've let this go far enough as it is. I know you need to talk to her, but it's your sister and her birthday party. Hey, I'm back. From my interview for Brown, which I went to. Okay. You told her, didn't you? Okay, first of all, don't blame Kaitlin. Fat chance of that. - Where have you been? - Oh, Johnny gave me my present. So you're in charge of everything? Well, I wouldn't go that far. So it looks like Lily and Bill are hitting it off. Yeah, I balked at taking him out to dinner... ...but I'm totally cool about turning your apartment into the Playboy Grotto. - Bill. Here you go. - Thanks, Sandy. Dry martini for you, Lily. - Gotta tell you, glad I didn't go home. - So am I. This may not seem fair, but I'm gonna talk to you more about the hospital. Sandy, that won't be necessary. Excuse me, please. - I'm in. - You're in? Honestly, I didn't see the difference between the proposals. You're trying to take care of me. The least I can do is take care of you. I mean, that's business, right? Caleb would've been proud. A martini. And Scotch for the young lady. - So, what did he say? - We got the hospital. - Really? - Really. Sandy, that's amazing. So where do we go to have fun around here? Where are you going? Leaving. Would you tell Mom? You're leaving your own birthday party? I need to talk to my sister. - Listen, Marissa... - I don't feel like hearing it right now. - What's wrong with you? - Here we go. Kaitlin, you gave Seth pot. You stole money from a fraternity. - I don't know who you are anymore. - Spare me the concerned-sister bit. We both know this is about Johnny. - You don't know. - Anyone can tell you like him. You don't think Ryan can? - I love Ryan. - Yeah, you love Ryan. You guys are soul mates. Blah, blah, blah. It doesn't mean you don't like Johnny. - I don't. - Really? Well, then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs. Yeah. You may not know me, but I do know you. - Hi, there you are. You all right? - No. It's Kaitlin. Hey, Marissa, honey, where's Kaitlin? It's time for the cake. - She's gone. - What? What do you mean? She's not gone. She wouldn't just leave her own party. Yeah, well, we got into a fight. You got in a fight at her birthday party? What about? I don't wanna go into it, okay? How could you do this to your little sister? Do you know what she's been through, being away for so long? This was a very important birthday for her, for us. Look, Mom, no offense, but I don't think a party's really gonna fix this family. Excuse me? You know, I should just go, okay? I'm sorry. Bye, Dr. Roberts. - I'll take you home. - No. I wanna walk. I need the fresh air. - I don't know what to say, Neil. - It's fine, Julie. It's fine. - You know, I just wonder... - Oh, no. No, I think you were right to be cautious. We both have very complex lives... ...and maybe we should consider all the implications before going further. Sorry, it's my nurse. They said they'd beep me if I was needed. - I hate to leave you like this. - Oh, no, it's fine. I'll just give these kids some cake and send them home and... You're right about the other thing. I agree. So we'll talk. And you can leave the key on the dish when you leave, all right? Come in. Hey, Cohen. I'm looking to see if Brown has a course in Human Sexuality. Because, no offense, you are so taking that. Summer. Oh, my God, I'm such an airhead. How did it go? Please tell me it went okay. Please? It went great. - We totally bonded. - Oh, that is amazing. This means we're gonna be together next year. - Come here, let's pick out our schedule. - Okay. - Where's the rest of it? - Oh, I threw away the boring courses. You know, like, history, English, health, science. That was probably a good idea. Oh, hey. When did you get home? Just a few minutes ago. I thought you might be sleeping. No, I waited up. How did it go? Well, we made our case... ...and we got it. Sandy, that's wonderful. And you did it your way. Yeah. - When are you coming to bed? - Soon. Bill Merriam's coming by tomorrow. I should prep a little.
