- We wanna throw a charity event. - Sounds like a wonderful cause. You were gonna scam me into throwing a fake charity. Well, what if you help me? So do you mind if I join you for some pizza? - Taylor, it's Summer! Open up! - I can't hear you. Been dodging this business for 20 years. Hang onto the company. I'll help you. This is Volchok. Johnny? Stay away from him. Look, I'm sorry, that movie sucked. - <i>Master of the Flying Guillotine?</i> - Yes. It's a classic of the genre. It's the Madame Bovary of martial-art cinema. The flying guillotine, was that the spiky hat thing he threw? - I'm sorry, but that was kind of weak. - Et tu, Ryan? It didn't make sense. Why was he going after the one-armed boxer? Poor guy. Revenge. A tale as old as time. - Maybe the girls should pick next time. - Yes. Do I have to remind you about the <i>Bring It On</i> phase? Now that is an awesome movie. I'm sexy, I'm cute I'm popular to boot I said I'm bitching, great hair The boys all love to stare - I'm wanted, I'm hot, l... - Summer. Man, what'd I say? Ten-to-one our boys are hanging out at that candy-ass diner on the pier. That's what I love about you rich kids. - So predictable. - What do you want? I gotta spell it out for you? I want a rematch. Somewhere private. Just me kicking your ass. I'm not looking for trouble. You should've thought of that before jumping me the other night. You didn't start it by hooking up with someone's girlfriend? Good point. Or that's unnecessary continuity. Either, or. Look, guys, this is so stupid. - I got nothing against you. - That's too bad. Because me and you, we got unfinished business. See you, guys. Hey, baby. I need your opinion. Which of these screams "real-estate mogul with a heart of gold"? The blue. And " sensitive, streetsmart man of talent and mystery." - The blue. - All right, blue it is. Sandy, you're gonna do great. The Newport Group's lucky to have you. I just wanna make a good impression on my first day. Hey, how's that charity thing coming? Oh, it's coming. I've just never thrown together something so quickly. I hope Julie and Charlotte aren't out getting Mystics while you do the work. Don't worry, they're working. Busy with the foundation. Oh, good question. - Booze or no booze? - Oh, tough call. A fundraiser for poor women with substance-abuse problems. I know, it'll be weird if people drink. Then again, people are more generous... ...when they've had a couple of shots under their belt. - Booze. - Booze. - Morning. - Oh, hey, boys. On Sunday, I would love some help with the party. Sunday. Sunday. Yeah, it's gonna be tough. - Yeah, no problem. - Thanks, Ryan. Well, I should get going. I have to meet Charlotte and Julie at the club. Hey, what is so incredibly pressing on a Sunday? It's the Sabbath, Dad. It's the day of rest. I don't make the rules. Talk to the big guy. I thought the Sabbath was Saturday. Listen to me, this is the first public thing your mother's done since rehab. So we are gonna do everything in our power to make it a success. Understood? Mom, listen, Sunday, I'm gonna be there, okay? Provided I don't get struck by lightning. Thanks, Seth. That means a lot. Such generosity. Oh, there goes the back. I'll be all right. I can probably lift stuff. I just feel responsible. If I hadn't introduced Ryan to Johnny... ...then he never would've gotten in a fight with that jerk. If you're gonna blame someone, why not Casey... ...for hooking up with the surf nazi? - I know, I still can't believe she did that. - Yeah, she had her reasons. - Summer. - I'm sorry. Have you asked him yet? Right, I'll just say, " Hey, Johnny, Casey thinks you're in love with me." Then best-case scenario: he says no... ...and our relationship is totally weird, if not ruined. But what if he is? Then our friendship is totally weird, if not ruined. He hasn't done anything to make me think that. So excuse me for not believing his psycho girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. Yeah, he's single now, remember? I'll see you later. Dude, all I'm saying is you just got back into Harbor, okay. You do not wanna go back to the wasteland of homeschooling. I told you, I'm not gonna fight him. Yeah, I hear you, and I wanna believe you, but I also know Kid Chino. Sometimes, when his back's up against the wall, his fists of fury... Kid Chino is retired. He hung up the hoodie. So just relax, all right? Seth. - Hey, Taylor. How's it going? - Oh, it's going great. I cannot tell you how many people have come up and told me... ...how awesome they thought Lock-In was. You know, every single one mentions Capture the Flag. Did you know he was all-Camp Takahoe? - He might have mentioned it. - Told you it'd be fun. It was, it was. And it was all because of you too. He took the lead in everything. I mean with the trust falls... ...and the s'more making and share time. Your story about Captain Oats. Oh, yeah, we had to tell a story about our best friend growing up. It was so insensitive of those guys to laugh too. Because your story wasn't nearly as lame as Derek Simonds befriending the deaf kid. But, Seth, I wanted to ask you... ...what do you think about planning the Christmas dance together? - The Christmas dance, you and me? - We made such a good team. Oh, wow, yeah. Well, that... You should talk to Summer. Your girlfriend? - Summer? - She did a fantastic job with the last one. And I just think that you guys would... There she is right over there. - So you can talk to her about it yourself. - Okay, forget it. I gotta go. Oh, boy. You're in trouble. - What? - You're in trouble. That? I mean, I was nice to her. So that's what that's about. - Keep telling yourself that. Yeah, sure. - Right. Hey. What were you doing talking to her? Forget she didn't let me into the Lock-In? I bruised my hand pounding on that door. - She probably didn't know it was you. - She knew. She didn't wanna let me in. Wonder why. - I don't know. - What's that supposed to mean? We should take out half these tables to have more flow. We should also talk to them about music. Last event they had us on a Kenny G loop. Can I just tell you how excited I am? This is gonna be so wonderful. I'm so glad you suggested it. Oh, there's the manager. I'm gonna find out what time we can be here on Sunday and set up. - So where are we? - Hundred and thirty RSVPs... ...at five thousand a head. That's over $600,000. Three hundred thousand apiece. Tell me again I have to do this. Julie, you have two daughters, no husband and no money. You're about to get $300,000. Oh, yeah. I'm totally doing this. He says we can be here at 8. - Ryan, hi. - Hi. - Going this way? - Yeah. - So you're, like, Seth's best friend, right? - Don't tell Captain Oats. That's funny. I didn't know that you were funny. So Seth and Summer seem happy. I mean, I know they had that trouble last year, but they seem stable. Wouldn't you say that they're stable? Of course, though, look at Brad and Jen. Everybody thought that they were stable, but nobody knew how unhappy Brad was. Just waiting for Angelina to rescue him... - They're stable. - How stable? One to ten. - Excuse me? - On a scale of one to ten. - Right. - How stable are they? Six? Six-point-five? - Ten. - Ten. Sucks for Angelina. Then again, things happen, don't they? I bet Brad and Jen used to be a ten. Oh, bye. I wanted to welcome you all on our first day. - Matt, have you met everyone? - Not yet. Matt Ramsey. I wanted to go over what's changed. The Newport Group will still develop residential and commercial properties. With this alteration... ...one quarter of all our new housing projects will be low-income. We are not just catering to the mansion crowd anymore. - Though we do need their money. - The other thing that's changed is us. Matt will be a vice president and director of development. Which will leave me as president and CEO. Despite the fact that I've watched my lovely wife do this job... ...for the past 15 years, I'm new at this, and I'm gonna need your help. Stop milling around, and get back to work. - Thank you, everybody. - Thank you. - Nice speech. - That's nothing. Catch me with a microphone in my hand. You should try to meet everyone. - They'd appreciate it. - Oh, yeah. Hi, Matt Ramsey. Good to meet you. You're fired. Your meeting with the accountant didn't go so well. The word "unsustainable" was used a lot. - We have to lose nine people. - Nine? - That's a little extreme. - You have to look at numbers. For now, we sit tight. We're here one day. The first order of business is not going to be firing half the staff. All right. You're the boss. I have a meeting about the zoning on Crestmont. Let me know what you come up with. I'm only telling you so you can be on the lookout, okay. This guy's crazy. Gotcha. I'll be on AMBER Alert. Oh, and don't tell Johnny. He might do something stupid. Say no more. It'll be our little secret. And if sharing that secret brings us closer together... ...creates a bond, we'll roll with that too. - Just don't tell Johnny, okay? - Tell me what? - Johnny. - Hey. How are you? - Good. Tell me what? - No offense, man. This is kind of just between me and Marissa. It's Volchok, isn't it? - What'd he do? - Nothing. Chili. Man, you guys are tearing me apart here. Look, he tried to get Ryan to fight him. But nothing happened, so... Hold these. Johnny, wait. - Johnny. - Look, this isn't Ryan's fight. What are you gonna do? Knock on his door and say, "Fight me instead"? I'm not gonna let your boyfriend take the heat for me. I'm not letting either of you guys fight. - Marissa, that's... - What is it with you two? - I'm so sick of this. - Ryan has nothing to do with this. You know what? It's fine. Just do whatever you want. Hey. Okay. I won't fight him. Seriously? Fighting a guy is one thing. When it comes to upsetting a lady, I'm a total coward. You win. Look, we better get to class. I'm serious. Do you have any idea what Summer will do if she finds out? - I can imagine. - I have to tell Taylor it's not gonna happen. Even if I didn't love Summer... ...her and I, we're totally incompatible. Seeing as how she's crazy and I'm not. Well, I thought you said she wasn't that bad. - Taylor Townsend? - Yeah. In fourth grade, she campaigned against making the school handicap-accessible. She said it was reverse Darwinism. Besides... Who? Who wants Dean Hess's seconds? Oh, look, there's a picnic on our car. It's you guys. Finally. - Seth, get security. - Well, maybe we'll go get them together. Security? We're just talking. I mean, nothing's gonna ha... - It's all right, that's just a little soap... - I'm not gonna fight you. Did you hear that? Rich boy doesn't wanna get his hands dirty. Is your butler around? Maybe he'll fight me. I got it. We're all strangers, okay? So let's take a step back for a second. I'm Seth. I like comic books. You obviously like flaming heart tattoos. I think you do got it in you. In fact, I think you're just itching to throw down. I just gotta find the key. Oh, look what I found. You know what I just realized though? She doesn't have a name. I'm gonna call her: "Little Bitch." Just keep walking. This ain't over. - Hi. - Hey. Were we having breakfast this morning? So, Summer told me what happened yesterday with Volchok. Yes. Seth kept a secret a whole 12 hours. Must be a record. Yeah, you know, I just, I didn't wanna worry you. Well, I'm proud of you for not fighting. I know it must've been hard. You have no idea. That guy's a total jackass. What are you doing? What are all these tools for? You wanna see? Come on. Just don't overreact. - A punching bag? - Sandy had one, said I could use it. - So you could train to fight him? - No. I'm not gonna fight him. I didn't yesterday. Then what's it for? Therapy. Okay. I just don't want anyone fighting. Johnny wanted to go after Volchok again. But I talked him out of it. - How's he doing? - You mean about Casey? Well, she really hurt him. Seth's going to the Bait Shop tonight. Why don't you invite Johnny. - It'll take his mind off things. - Sure. - Now, what about breakfast? - Definitely. - I'll meet you inside. I gotta clean up. - Okay. You can 't deliver at four. By the time the guests arrive, there'll be pudding, and I can't have pudding. Six will be fine. - Thank you. - Ah, sweet charity. I am hereby calling the next three hours "Kirsten time." I am going to the gym, I am getting my nails done... ...and everything else can wait. - Good for you. - You left early this morning. Yeah. You know, nothing like a little dawn patrol to clear your head. Is everything okay? I was so busy yesterday... ...I forgot to ask how your first day went. Oh, it's good, it's good. It's, you know, just a lot. You can always come to me with questions. Thanks. You go have your "Kirsten time." Come in. Hi, Seth. Taylor, hey. What are you doing here? Oh, your mom let me in. She seems really, really nice. Wow, your room is really cute. - Look, can we talk? - Before you say anything... - I like you. - Oh, boy. I know. It totally surprised me too. Because I don't usually go for the R. Crumb type. But the heart has its own logic. Yeah, well, I'm with Summer though, so... - I heard you were breaking up. - What? Who said that? I made it up. But what did you feel when you heard it? - Relief? - No. Listen, Taylor, even if I was single... ...I'm not sure that you and I would make a great match, I mean... Is that a <i>Yakuza Prep</i> poster? Yeah. It's just this Japanese film about these prep... Yeah, yeah. It's like my favorite movie of all time. I think Kenji Yamamoto was a genius. Really? Seen his <i>Samurai Assassination</i> series? Battles at the Edge of Hell? I own the collection. - Oh, my God. Do you like comic books? - Comics are geek-whacking material. But, look, Seth. I mean, it is obvious that we are soul mates. All you have to do is break up with Summer. Right. Well, I'm not gonna be able to do that, so... I see. Excuse me. - Hello? - Hey. What time do we have to be there tonight? We should be at the Bait Shop by like 8. I'll see you later, Seth. Who was that? That sounded like a girl. Did it? Yeah. Well, sure, because I'm listening to the radio... ...and <i>This American Life</i> is on, and so it was a girl talking. Oh, is that that show by those hipster know-it-alls... ...who talk about how fascinating ordinary people are? God. Yeah, yeah. - Hello? - So did you get the tickets? Yep. San Juan, Puerto Rico, where your ill-gotten dollar goes farther. How's your roomie? Oh, she still thinks she's getting half the money and a free condo. - You almost feel bad for her. - <i>Yeah, almost.</i> I'll see you tomorrow night. - I just don't think we should sign. - What's the problem? Oh, they want us to sign a liability agreement. But then you'd be responsible. - I'm happy to do it. - What could happen? Exactly. There, it's done. I'm gonna give this to the manager. It's if somebody stubs a toe. It doesn't mean anything. I know. I'm just nervous. As soon as I skip town, everybody's gonna blame me. You're gonna be fine. What about Kirsten? Well, she is gonna be very hurt. And she's gonna need her best friend. Right. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. I spent the morning with our accountant going over the numbers, and you're right. For this company to be as strong as possible, we have to lose nine people. - For once, I wish I was wrong. - I'm still not doing it. I came up with a plan. We restructure our loans, eliminate the perks, cut my salary by 30 percent. - We let four people go. It'll get us by. - But this... This leaves us no margin. - lf one deal goes down... - Then we go down. But as long as I'm running this company, that's how we're gonna do it. Hey, it was not a pity invite, okay? Tell him. Yeah, no, we thought you might like to see the band. So you weren't worried I'd be home alone all weekend thinking about Casey? - No, no. - That's crazy. Seriously, what are you doing tomorrow? My mom's having a fundraiser. Yeah, if you want... Seth and I could use your help setting up. Yeah, well, if they're counting on Seth, they definitely need your help. You guys are so not subtle. But I appreciate it. Thanks. Hey, okay, buddy... Come on. I used to work here. Hello, Seth. Taylor. Hey. - Is Summer here? - Okay, look. I love Summer. I always have. Now, while you and I may share an appreciation... ...for ultra-violent Asian cinema... ...there's no way... - What's going on? Tell me you just heard what I was saying. Hi, Summer. You look really cute. I know. But more importantly, why are you always talking to my boyfriend? She likes <i>Yakuza...</i> Never mind. Well, maybe I should just get going. I almost forgot. Here. Thanks for letting me borrow him. It really means a lot to me that you trust me. Bye. - You let her borrow Captain Oats? - I didn't let her borrow anything. - She must've taken it from my room. - When was she in your room? Wait, that was her? When I was on the phone... Something happened at the Lock-In. - You're such a jerk. - Summer... Summer? You leaving already, bro? Yo, Harper, what's up? - How's your girlfriend doing? - No. Whoa, hey, he's not worth it. Just get out of the way, man. Or what? You're not gonna fight me, I know that. But she might shoot you. She has before. - Yeah. - Is that true, bro? You let your girlfriend do your fighting for you? No, hold up, girl. - Don't you touch her. - So that's what gets you going. You. Out. - Hey. - Hey. Kirsten's already over at the yacht club. Once you and Mr. Sabbath have breakfast... ...we should head over and start setting up. Great. Can I talk to you about something? Anytime. There's this guy, and he's gotten it in his head that he's gonna fight me. Does this have anything to do with the fact my car is now... ...the "Little Bitch"? - Maybe. I was gonna fix that. - Forget about it. - That there's enough to go to the cops. - Yeah. - Do you want me to talk to him? - No. No offense... ...but I don't see this guy getting scared. You know you can't get into another fight. I know. I've been trying to walk away. You're using your brain instead of your fists. Good. - How's that helping me with this guy? - Well, you gotta keep walking away. Because whatever's making him angry, it isn't you. Hang on just a minute. Hey, Matt. It's a little early on a Sunday morning. Today? No, you don't do anything till I get there. All right. You and Seth are gonna have to go to the club without me. I'll catch up later. I'll have my phone if you need me. I can't believe you dragged me out of bed for this. This is the worst idea ever. There's no other way. But seriously, you don't know Volchok. Last year, some guy snaked his wave... ...so he went up on the pier and dropped a kitchen sink on him. Where do you even get a kitchen sink? Yeah, well, if you're so concerned, why don't you stay in the car. I'm just saying maybe we could bring some muscle. Besides the muscle that I already provide. Hey, look who's here. Now, don't shoot. - Hey, dork. - Hey. Look, I want you to leave Ryan alone. Oh, so it's bribes now? Well, I got a watch. Kmart, 15.99. Well, this is Cartier, and I got it for my 16th birthday. It's worth, like, four grand. Damn. You must really think I'm gonna hurt him. Do we have a deal? - Sure. I'll leave your little boy alone. - All right. If I see you around again, I'm gonna tell the cops you stole that. You do that. Don't put them in direct sunlight. The water heats up and then the flowers, they wilt. Do you think there's too much red? - Hey, Kirsten. - Oh, hey. - What's up? - Just giving final instructions. I know I'm going a little crazy, but I just want everything to be perfect. - It will be, won't it? - Yeah, of course. It'll be fantastic. Thanks, Julie. I am so glad we're doing this together. Me too. - What are you doing? - Let me explain. Forget going behind my back. You called people in on a Sunday to fire them. That's what business school teaches you? Don't lose time during the week? I thought it'd be better now than Monday... ...when they have to pack up in front of their coworkers. - I didn't go behind your back. - Really? As much as I appreciate the phone call... ...that you're about to fire four employees... ...I don't recall ever agreeing to this. - We agreed we had to let them go. I just thought that if I did it myself, I would spare you the pain. That's all. For the record, I don't let people do my dirty work for me. - Where are they? - They're in your office. - Sandy. - Oh, it's all right, Matt. Now go home. It's Sunday. Listen to me. Nothing happened at the Lock-In. Yet you still felt the need to lie about her being in your room? Because I knew how you'd react. Not that it's your fault. I'm saying it's my fault. It's definitely my fault. - You know what is my fault? - What? That. Listen, man, I'm really sorry about the whole Volchok thing. It's not your fault. Guys like Volchok are looking for any excuse. Sounds like you've been in this situation before. Feels like every week. Look... If anything goes down, I'm there. Thanks, but I'm hoping it doesn't come to that. Sometimes you don't have a choice. Julie, you're not dressed. We need to leave in a few minutes. I don't think I can do this. You're worried about Kirsten getting hurt. Kirsten, Marissa. Even if they blame you. I see. Well, what if they blame you? - What? - What if I call the police and tell them... ...how we created a fake charity to defraud your friends? - Charlotte, they'd arrest you. - Yeah, they'd have to find me first. I somehow think you'd be a little easier to track down. Could you do jail, Julie? And if you did... ...which one of your former friends would help you when you get out? Now get dressed... ...or we'll be late for the party. - Do you think Taylor's pretty? - Summer. Well, I mean, I know she's not prettier than me. - But objectively speaking. - Objectively speaking, Seth loves you. You've got nothing to worry about. Go put these on a table. He told me to give you this. He changed his mind. He wants cash. - But he can sell that. - Tell him yourself. He's in the parking lot. - We had a deal. - Pawn shop ain't open. I need cash now. - I owe a guy some money. - Well, I don't have $4000. Lucky for you, all I need is a couple hundred. Come on, you got an ATM card, don't you? Screw it. Is your boyfriend inside? Okay. Fine, I'll go. Let's do it. - The party's really wonderful, Julie. - Yes... I'm so glad that you both could come. You should watch those Ahi rolls, Chuck... ...or we'll be treating you for substance abuse. Oh, excuse me. Nice to see you. Well, you don't miss a beat. Oh, well, you know, just like riding a bike. Julie, I really wanna thank you. For what? Making me do this. I wasn't sure that I was ready. But having your support... I just wish my dad could see us. He'd be so proud. I thought you said you'd have friends here tonight. - They're just not here yet. - I don't want another evening... ...of you sitting alone in the corner reading <i>The Economist.</i> - It's embarrassing. - They're gonna be here. Well, excuse me if I don't hold my breath. Taylor, sorry I'm late. I was... Hi, Seth Cohen. Veronica Townsend. Nice to meet you. Taylor, is this the young man you bought the present for? - Mom. - Well, give it to him. She must have re-wrapped it four times before we left the house. Oh, my God. Okay. Fine. Oh, wow. You know, I mean... That's, you know... Yakuza Demon? How did you get this? I thought they only released it in Japan. My cousin works for Christie's in Tokyo, and he sends me DVDs. I don't know. - I just thought you would like it. - It's amazing. Well, I'll just let you two be alone. Taylor, this is, like, so... - Taylor! - Go away, Seth. - I don't need you feeling sorry for me. - I don't. Oh, God. Well, why not? You heard her. She's horrible. She's always saying the same things: "Why don't people like you, Taylor? Why aren't you popular? Why don't you have friends?" She doesn't know what she's talking about. Yeah, but that's just it. She does. I live in this dream world where I think that Summer is my friend... ...and I think that you like me. And the truth is that I don't have anybody. Oh, my God. Even the Grinch had that stupid little dog. - You think Summer's your friend? - Yes, I know. I'm crazy. You know what, I like you. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - You pity me. It's different. - No, I really do. I think you're funny. - Stop teasing me. - I'm not. Listen to me. I'm serious. You got great taste in movies. I think you're smart, you're interesting. - Really? - Yeah. If you just relaxed a little bit, I think other people would see that. You know, they'd see that you're one of a kind. Yeah. But I've actually gotta head back in right now. So... - Seth, l... - No, no. Just because... ...I think Summer may be looking for me. You know, if she was to come out here and see us talking: - So we're gonna talk at school. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, good. - Okay. But I feel really good about this. It's happening. - What's up, man? - Hey. This party's unbelievable. It feels like I'm in a movie. I know the feeling. Have you seen Marissa? No. No, but I just got here. - Why, what's up? - Nothing. I just saw her a little while ago, but... Guess who? Hey, where are you? Well, right now, I'm with your girlfriend. Are you there, Little Bitch? - Yeah, I'm here. - She's fine. But she does miss you. So why don't you come get her. We're underneath the pier. What's up? - Volchok's got her. - We should call the cops. Yeah. You call them. I'm gonna finish this. Hey. Kirsten. I've raised over $300,000 in pledges. Oh, that's great. I think Julie's doing even better. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit a million. Where is she? I haven't seen her in a while. - I don't know. - Excuse me. Excuse me, may I have your attention over here, please. I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol. It's so great to see all your faces. And I just want to thank you so much for coming here. With your assistance, we are going to be able... ...to help a great many women in need. Thank you. However, as you write your checks... ...I would ask that you make them out... ...to the National Foundation for Substance Abuse. As it so happens... ...your generosity has somewhat overwhelmed our small organization. With the National Foundation's network, your money will go a lot further. And still be tax-deductible. So thank you very much. - Did you know about this? - No, I... - I'll go talk to her. - Okay. Julie. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Oh, could you not hear me? I always hold the mic too far away. I wasn't kidding about the police. Get back over there. Tell everyone it was a mistake. - Call them. - What? Call the police. I thought so. Oh, what? You think you're back in society now... ...so you don't need the money? Wake up, Julie. These people are never gonna accept you. - You don't have any friends here. - Wrong. I have Kirsten, and I won't do this to her. Now, I think it's time you left, don't you? This town's only really big enough for one manipulative bitch. Take care, sweetie. Where have you been? I'm not talking to you but you're not allowed out of my sight. - I was in the parking lot. - The parking lot? Why were you in the par...? - Yakuza? Were you with Taylor? - She's having an emotional crisis. - She's about to have a physical one. - Summer, she thinks you're her friend. What? She is crazy. I hate her. I know, you along with everyone else. This whole thing started... ...because that day I was at the Lock-In, I saw how awful her mother is. So you know, I was nice to her. Okay. So that's the problem? You were too nice? She's not used to it, and I think she's overreacting a little bit. She's just really Ionely. - She doesn't make it easy to be nice to. - I know. - Just don't ever lie to me again, okay? - I won't, I swear. How bad do you want to watch that movie? So bad it may actually kill me. Come on. Dude, this is a bad idea. Last year, Volchok almost killed this guy. - I know what I'm doing. - Would you mind telling me what that is? - I'm gonna try and use my head for once. - With Volchok? Just trust me. And whatever happens, go with it. All right. If that doesn't work? Grab Marissa and run. Here comes your boy. - Whoa, slow down, bro. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - We said she could go... ...but she wanted to stay. Check it out, you brought Harper. Want some when I'm through with him? - Let's do it now. - No. This is mine. - Ryan! - Whoa, bro, come on now. Let's not get crazy, man. You don't wanna do this... - Oh, you giving me advice now? Come on. Don't look at them, look at me. Come on! - Ryan. - Stay out of it! Come on, you scared, huh? Dude, you don't know what you're doing. I been fighting guys like you for years. Wanna bash my face in because your life sucks? Fine! Yeah? But if you wanna fight, you're gonna have to kill me. So, what's it gonna be? - Come on! - All right! All right. Let's go, man. The guy's crazy. - Hey. - Hey. Have a seat. So the event was a success. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So you wanna tell me what's going on? - What do you mean? - Don't shut me out, Sandy. I fired four people today. I'm not sure I'm the guy for this job at all. I'm glad you're upset. - Good pep talk. - It means you care. Do you think my father gave a second thought to someone he fired? Exactly. He was successful. And his ego almost destroyed the company. If I had to choose between you and my father to run things... ...I would choose you every time. Thank you, baby. I'm not fragile. You don't have to protect me. - I forget, you are your father's daughter. - No. I'm your wife. Good answer. That was intense. - You really wanted to hit him, huh? - Oh, no. No, I'm fine. Well, I didn't hit him. I think that's the most important thing. Yeah, it is. I'm sorry I doubted you. You had plenty of evidence to back you up. Yeah, but you've changed. You're like a totally different Ryan Atwood. - Was the old one so bad? - No. No. Just... ...darker. It scared me sometimes. Yeah. Me too. I should head home. I've got school in the morning. You're gonna have to pull Summer away from that <i>Yakuza</i> movie. Somehow, I think I'll manage. Hey, I'm proud of you.
