It's about more than the hospital. - I can't just quit. - I'm an alcoholic. Soon Marissa's gonna wake up and realize she is so much better than you. You think she's gonna come back to you? Our kids got into college. It's a big day. Oh, my God. Oh, God, how did I not get in? I'm not sure that Brown is the right choice for me. We applied to Brown so that we could be together. I need to get Summer back and get into Brown. - We need a plan? - It's gonna be a long night, Ryan. You taking all that? You only own, like, a wife-beater and two hoodies. Sorry. I don't know what people wear to Prospective Students Weekend. - I brought everything. - I packed light. I wanna be free and easy for pre-frosh weekend. - Even though you're not a pre-freshman. - It's called pre-frosh, Ryan. And if I'm gonna go there, I need you to get the lingo. Don't give me that look. You were way into this when we came up with it. That's because we only had the beginning. So you're gonna fly to Brown... Then I will somehow get them to admit me. Yeah. I don't have the details yet, but Brown's a spiritual place. I'll just... I'll go, I'll get a vibe. Maybe I'll bump into the ghost of old man Brown. - Or whoever they named the school after. - Summer's gonna be there. I don't know that for sure. Every student is going to be at a college. She's gonna be there. It's not like we'll run into each other. We're going to a land of Jewish kids. - I'll blend right in. - Yeah? - And your flight? - Booked a ticket through Chattanooga. Totally inconvenient. No way she'll be on it. I don't wanna see you get deeper into this, okay? You're going to Berkeley with your ex. - You ready to go? College calls. - Yeah. - I think we're set. - Just think... ...the next time we send you off... ...it'll be real. - Only be a few hours away. What about you, going all the way to the East Coast. If I wasn't so proud of you, I'd be angry at you... - All right, we got planes to catch. - Okay, let's go. Where's Sandy? He had an early meeting. He said to say goodbye. That's weird. Man lives for the airport sendoff. Well, I guess it was an important meeting. Flight 825 to Phoenix is now boarding. All right, well my gate's this way. Call when you get there. Yeah? All right, bring it in. - Save the hug. - Yeah, okay. - See you Sunday. - Okay. Phoenix is now boarding. And what about you? Are you okay? I'm a little nervous, actually. Ryan, Berkeley's gonna be a breeze. You conquered Newport. This town isn't known for its hospitality. But I had you, and I had Seth, and Sandy... Hey. You did this. - You earned your future. - Yeah. - Enjoy it. - All right. Thanks. Have a wonderful time. And call when you get there. Okay. I will. Passenger Scott Menville, please come to the club lounge on the mezzanine level. Hey. - Hey, Theresa. - Hi. Here you go. I'll take that. Scott Menville, meet your party at the club lounge. He's cute. - Can I borrow that sparkly scarf? - Sure. What am I thinking? Kids at Brown don't wear sparkly scarves. On my way to the airport I'll stop and get some kind of angry-Iooking piercing. Sum, you should just dress like yourself. This is all wrong. - What, the scarf? - No. This. All of this. Me going without Cohen. You going to Berkeley without Ryan. I'm going to Berkeley with Ryan. I'm just not going "with" him. Yeah, which is even weirder. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. This way, we're forced to focus on the future. And we can start doing that this weekend. Big talk coming from the girl who chucked her acceptance in the garbage. Yeah, well, I was going through something. Is that code for having an affair with an almost-homeless surfer? And does your past tense imply it's over? - Whatever I was doing with Volchok... - I don't need details... Well, I'm not doing it anymore. After today, I probably will never see him again. - What do you mean today? - He texted me to say... ...I left some stuff at his place. I told him I'd stop and pick it up before I left. No. You won't. Saying your goodbye with his dirty mattress in sight? - That is breakup sex waiting to happen. - Have you no faith in me at all? Forty-eight hours ago, Coop, you were Newport's Courtney Love. Baby steps. Fine. I'll just tell him to meet me at the diner. You know what, you should take this with you to Brown. They're gonna love you, just so long as long as you be yourself. Talk about clich√©d advice. I can say things like that now that I'm smart. Here you go, my love. - Thank you. - Hey. You don't want a ride to the airport now? Oh, no, we got it. But we could use your muscle... ...to help get our bags in the trunk. - Muscle. Guess I still got it. Marissa, you know it's not too late for me to go with you. I won't embarrass you. I could pretend to be your entourage. - Or your Scientology guide. - Mom, you don't have to worry, okay? Kids go crazy at college. You saw <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i> Yeah. I lived it. Not the topless part. But don't worry, I've got all that partying out of my system. I do want something different from this. Well, the Cooper women do have nine lives. - I'm just glad you're on to your next one. - Summer's waiting. - Bye, Marissa. - Bye. I'll see you guys in a few days. - Bye, Mom. - Have fun. Did a priest just break in here and perform an exorcism? I don't know, but she's definitely out of the woods. Well... It's just you and me this weekend. What should we do? I could call the Montage. Can't. I've got that dinner tomorrow night. - Retirement party for the head of surgery. - Oh, right. Well, then. Thank God for Netflix. Are you ever gonna come to one of these? Why? So the women can gossip about me after I leave? Now, why would anyone wanna gossip about you? I don't get it. You throw parties for the dating service. I have Kirsten, then. She's my wingwoman. So invite Kirsten and Sandy. He can network with the doctors, and she can "wingwoman." It would mean a lot to me. Then I'm there. - Ryan Atwood. Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry. - Wes Seifert. Your buddy. - Nice to meet you. - You need a hand? - No, I'm good. We've seen better days. I'll show you the dorm. - Okay. - You don't mind an inflatable mattress... - No, sounds good. - I saw your profile. You're from Newport. - Did you go to Harbor? - Yeah, you know it? Yeah, a few guys in my Poli-Sci Club went there. Play water polo? No, no. You know what, actually I'm not really from Newport. I mean, I am, but up until the last two years I was... I was living in Chino. I guess I figured I needed to get that out of the way. - I think you'll be okay. - What do you mean? I got one roommate from Bangladesh. The other one's from Partridge, Kansas. Population 300. So there's no mold here. It's pretty easy to fit in. Guess I'm not really used to that. Hey. Summer's waiting, and I've got a plane to catch. So do you have my stuff? - No. - What? Why? Tell me why you all of a sudden up and bailed. I really never thought of you as the possessive type. I just wanna know what happened. It's what you already know. You and me, we have nothing in common. Right. You got money and I don't. - Same old story. - No, it's not like that. You really wanna know? When I was little, my sister and I used to always watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i> Yes, I must have missed that one. Okay, well, there's this girl in it, Liesl. I always used to think I was gonna grow up to be just like her. I'd have the really cute boyfriend... ...that looked like her boyfriend. And our lives would be just like the scene where they're... They're standing in the gazebo and singing to each other. Then I grew up, and... ...I found myself doing coke and sleeping with a guy... ...who I'd never had one real conversation with. I know it sounds cheesy. But I'm just not ready to give up on <i>The Sound of Music</i> thing. Not yet. Well, good luck with that. I'll be sure to drop off your stuff. It's not gonna be a problem. I promise you. Look. Hey, hey, hey, let me get back to you, all right? I was just about to get some lunch. Wanna go out? - I only have a minute. - I'm sorry about the other night. - I tried to call. - It's something else. When I was at the airport this morning, I saw Ryan's ex-girlfriend Theresa. - How's she doing? - She had a baby with her. A boy. Looked about 2. - Think it might be Ryan's. - It's possible. - You spoke to her. - No. For all you know, he could be her cousin or nephew. I saw how she was with him, the way she picked him up. She's a mother. Yeah, well, she told Ryan she lost the baby. What are you saying, she lied? I just think we should tell him what I saw. We've always been honest with him. He trusts us. Oh, honey, let's keep it to ourselves. You know, at least until he gets back. - <i>Hey, Seth.</i> - Hey, man, how's Berkeley? It's... It's cold, and wet, and pretty cool. I can't believe I'm actually on a college campus. Ryan, I'm touching ivy right now. - What? - Real ivy. It grows on the buildings here. These pictures in the brochure? They are not photoshopped. - <i>You're in the middle of the quad now?</i> - Yeah, dead center. Pretty stealth. Can't imagine anyone seeing you. I know, I know. It's a Summer hot zone. I just had to come visit campus for a few minutes. - Yeah, and it's perfect? - Man, it's better than perfect. - Seth Cohen has come home to roost. - Cohen? - Who's that? - I don't know. I'm too afraid to turn around. Anna? - So... - Yeah. Newport versus Pittsburgh. Who would win in a smackdown? For me, Pittsburgh. Come on, you miss Newport. The sun and the surf, the surgery. They've not perfected chin implants in Pittsburgh. - But I am optimistic. - Mocking Newport with Anna Stern. - That is one of my favorite pastimes. - Mine too. But I did get a small taste when <i>Atomic County</i> came out. - Hey, you saw my comic. - I was so proud of you. - Thanks. - I do have a few notes on Punky Spitfire. - Okay. - And that Mobisode was hilarious. What the hell is a Mobisode? You don't know? I thought it was yours. Yeah, it was, but I traded it to a guy named Zach Stevens... ...in exchange for Summer. How romantic. - How are you guys? - Great. - Great. Great. - Great. - Tell her I say hi. - I will. But I wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea... ...about us bumping into each other. - I know, it does kind of seem like fate. - Yeah, not exactly. - Ouch. - Well, what I mean is... ...and the only other person who knows this is Ryan. - I am not officially admitted here. - You didn't get in? Shut up. No, I didn't. That's why I'm out here. - I'm trying to get in. - How do you plan on that? I haven't quite nailed that down yet. But now that I've run into you... ...who, if I remember correctly, is not only sage, but wise... And you want me to come up with some scheme... ...to, what, smuggle you into college? - Yes. Please? Listen, it's fate. You said it yourself. All right. There's a "Meet the Faculty" reception tonight. I assume Dr. Overbee will be there. - That's the admissions dude. - Try talking to him. - I will say what? - You flew all the way out here... ...because you wanna go here so badly. You should come up with that speech. What are you doing tomorrow night? No plans? Good. You're going to Neil's dinner with doctors. Sandy can recruit for the hospital. You and I can sit in a corner and gossip. A fun time will be had. Actually, I'm busy. Kiki... All you ever do is sit in this house and drink tea. I mean, what's the real reason? Sandy and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. What happened? It's complicated. Suffice it to say, I'm not a huge fan of this hospital project. Well, are you a huge fan of me? Because, you know, I'm saying, if you need a reason to go... ...you're looking at one. - You don't need me to do this. Yeah, Kirsten, I do. You know, ever since Caleb died... ...the way I've been able to navigate these Newpsie waters... ...is with you by my side. Please, Kirsten... ...I want Dr. Roberts' doctor friends to like me. - Fine. But I'm only doing this for you. - Thank you. I owe you one. Or, you know, maybe it's more than one. But who's counting. Okay. See you tomorrow. - So your dad's in jail? - Yeah, yeah. I got a dad, one brother, and two uncles locked up. You win. Miguel's the first to go to college too. Really? You ever feel out of place here? All the time. Look, as long as I keep my grades up... ...I figured I belong as much as anyone. And one day Wes here is gonna get my brother out of jail. - Supreme Court Justice. - It's just a pipe dream. - I mean, I'll be happy if I pass the bar. - That's amazing. Oh, speaking of amazing... And she's headed this way. - Hi. - Hey. - You two know each other? - We were in the same class. Yeah, at Harbor. This is Miguel. - Hi. - And Wes, my freshman buddy. Speaking of buddies, where's yours? Oh, mine's vegan, and she's boycotting this. Because of the turkey on your plate. What can you do, right? So you're... You're all alone, huh? Yeah, but, I'm fine. No worries. - See you guys around. - All right. - Okay, there's definitely a story there. - Oh, yeah. And it's not, "we went to Harbor." Yeah, we dated. On and off for two and a half years. - That'll do it. - Yeah. She seems nice. And Ionely. If you wanna go over and talk to her... Hey, hey. She's your ex, I'm your buddy. Not a good mix. Honestly, I'm gonna be in college with her. So I gotta get used to it. Really. Go for it. - You sure you don't mind? - No. Well... So let me tell you about rush week. Okay. Look, there he is. Dr. Overbee, head of admissions. - What? - No, no, I'm just looking around. - Why are you acting like a fugitive? - No, no. Staying under radar. Never know who's at these things. Well, focus. Have you thought about what you're gonna say to him? I'm probably just gonna riff. You know, we're both dudes... ...even though he's got a bow tie and probably nine Ph. D's... ...underneath, I'm sure... ...we're the same. - Could you maybe think... ...of some talking points? Okay, he's by himself. This is my moment. - Dr. Overbee. Hi. - Hi. The fact is, the U.S. has been performing its own jihads for decades. Instead of Allah, the killing is done in the name of oil. Totally. You guys? What is a jihad? Exactly. Way to reframe the question, Summer. - Now, what was your name again? - Seth Cohen. You may remember me from my application essay on Superman? - Lonely guy, Superman. - I don't recall it at the moment... ...but if you're here, I trust it was exceptional. About that, do you have a minute? Do you wanna take a walk, stretch your legs? I'm sorry. This is a faculty reception. I have to be here. - I should make the rounds. - Dr. Overbee, please... ...we really need to talk. If you can't do it now, name the time. All I need is five minutes. I suppose I could see you here, tomorrow around 5? Great. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Cohen? Oh, hey. What's going on? What the hell are you doing here? Providence in spring. Can't beat it. So you are going to Brown. You just didn't want to come with me. How'd it go? Anna. Summer. You're probably really confused right about now. No. Not at all. All of this, everything you've done up until now finally makes sense. So you and Ryan dated for how long? Couple of years. But we've both been with other people since then. It's not exactly normal yet, but we're working on it. So where is Ryan, anyway? Tour of the Architecture Building. Never set foot in there, so I couldn't show him. - Oh, yeah, where do you hang out? - Poli-Sci Building. Sexy, right? It's my major. I'm hoping it gets me into law school. My dad was a Poli-Sci major. You know, you kind of remind me of him, a little bit. The good parts, at least. If that's a compliment, I'll take it. It is. - One second. - Hey, Ryan. - Hi. - Hi. - I didn't know you were gonna be here. - I hope it's not weird that I am. I don't really know the rules between us. Well, me either. So I know the whole friendship thing didn't really work out in Newport but... That was Newport. Everything feels different here. I'm willing to try. Well, I don't know. If I was in your circle of friends, I might let it slip that you used to do musicals. I have enough dirt on you to last the next four years. So bring it on. That might be true. Do you wanna come sit with me and Wes? I wanna hear about your architecture tour. - Really? - Yeah. Seth, it's okay. Sorry. I should've told you I was on a Summer mission. Yeah, well, I should've known it. But I can't be mad at you when you're this pathetic. - Thank you. - Now stop wallowing... ...and let's figure out how we're getting you out of this. - I thought you didn't wanna help me. - It's the pathetic thing. It works on me. Okay, look, here's a list of tomorrow's pre-frosh activities. Try and figure out which one Summer might go to. I don't know. She's never been a joiner. Maybe the walking tour. She likes cardio. Good. You can go. You can talk to her. We gotta figure out what you're gonna say to Dr. Overbee. I don't know. If he didn't like my essay, I'm out. Seth, you flew all this way to win her back. Now you have five minutes with Dr. Overbee to make it happen. We're gonna write the speech. What have I done the last two years without you? Honestly? I don't know. Hey. I got your message about the hospital dinner. - Tomorrow. Can you make it? - Absolutely. Maybe I can get some of these doctors excited about the new hospital. Hey. Ryan, how are my old stomping grounds? I'm happy to hear that. Hey, listen, you know what? I got a call that I gotta take here. It's work. I'm gonna hand you to Kirsten, all right? Have fun. Here you go. Hello. - How are those permits coming? - Hey, how's it going? Hey, Kirsten, it's... It's actually kind of amazing. - Fine. I'm good. Fine. - You don't sound fine. Don't be silly. Tell me more about college. Kirsten, what's going on? It can wait till you get home. Okay. So there is something. It's really... It's not... It's not important. Then you won't mind telling me. What is it? I don't want you to overreact, because that's probably what I'm doing. I saw Theresa at the airport. She had a baby with her. It looked like her son. - And you think...? - I don't know what I think. There she is. Now, remember, you're just gonna tell her the truth. - Right. - Yes. Okay. All of it. Summer, can I talk to you? - Just leave me alone, Cohen. - Everyone. Hello. My name is Jack. I'm a sophomore here at Brown. I'll be leading this walking tour. So long as everyone's got their nametags, we can get started. I wanna explain to you about everything. You in the striped shirt. Do you have a nametag? Yeah. Yeah I do. I'm all set. Kumar? Your name is Kumar? Yes. Kumar Zimmerman. I'm half Indian, I am half Jewish. I am a Hin-Jew. Well, good. Good then. Right. Come, everyone. Right this way. Now, to our left, we've got the Main Dining Hall. The Sharpe Refectory... ...known as the Ratty. - I've been acting like a freak. I know that. Does this tour offer an audio option, like when you get headsets at the museum? No. - We've got the Main Building. - You can't just ignore me forever. Oh, yes, I can. Don't you remember middle school? I was good at ignoring you. Getting back into shape. Look, I promise you, I did not know Anna was gonna be... Kumar? Kumar, you wanna keep it down? Yeah. Sorry. You're wondering about the Kumar thing. Again, if you let me explain... ...I promise you, it will all make sense. - Oh, no. It already makes sense. I don't need any explanation. You broke up with me so you can be free to date smart women. - You got quite the head start. - Summer, that is so not it. Look, you already ruined senior year for me. There's nothing I can do about that. I'm not gonna let you ruin college. Now, will you please just leave me alone? Please. - Hi. I couldn't stay. - Ryan. I'm sorry. - I shouldn't have told you. - No, no, I'm glad you did. It's funny, in a way I was kind of expecting it. I mean, for once things were uncomplicated. How long could that last, right? - Well, maybe it's not... - Yeah, yeah. Whatever's going on with Theresa, we'll get to the bottom of it. I did some research on the Internet, and I found her address. Oh, great. Thanks. I'm gonna put this in the pool house. Ryan, no matter what happens, we're behind you. Dr. Overbee, you made it. Yes, well, as I said, I've only got five minutes. Sure, sure. Okay. You're a busy guy. And I have a tendency to ramble... ...which is why I've prepared this statement. Dr. Overbee, the following is a list of reasons... ...why I should have gotten into Brown. Wait a minute. You didn't get in? No, I didn't. But only because I'm sure... ...there was some clerical error... ...or human error, maybe the computer froze. Mr. Cohen, I was under the impression you were an admitted student. - That's why I came to meet you. - I know. Please listen... ...and if you still don't wanna let me in, at least I'll know I tried. Okay. You have one minute. Then I'm gonna have to sort of condense this... ...maybe make it more of a bullet-point thing. Grades, 3.8. SATs, 2250. That's not perfect, but I would say it's respectable. I was president of the Comic Club, a member of the Chess Team. - I was extremely low profile. - Thirty seconds. Oh, okay. Here's a part about how I belong on the East Coast. And it's a little joke about the weather to keep it light. It's funny. And I guess that's about it. That was compelling. But you misled me, and you wasted my time. So now I trust you will show yourself off campus. Dr. Overbee, I have to get in here. Okay? And it's not just because I love it. Although I do, I truly... I do. It's because of a girl. Her name's Summer Roberts, and she's going here. If I don't get in, I'm gonna lose her and the rest of my life is gonna be ruined. - So this is a about a girl? - Yes. It's about the girl. - Do you get it? - I do. But we make commitments when we send out those letters. And for better, for worse, we stick to them. - Please? - I wish I could help... ...but you're gonna have to do this yourself. Good luck. Ryan, I thought you weren't getting home till tomorrow. Kirsten didn't tell you? - No, no. She didn't. - I kind of figured... ...I needed to get home and deal. - Right, of course. - In case it turns out... - We'll cross that bridge... ...if and when we come to it. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. - All right. - You told him. - I didn't think he'd come home. Oh, you know Ryan better than that. It just happened. You weren't there. You had to take a business call. Oh, so you told Ryan about Theresa to punish me. I told him. He asked. He has a right to know. Theresa hasn't demanded anything of him. Why should we? Being a father is important. Being a family is important. There was a time you'd be making this argument. - What's that mean? - You know what I'm talking about. I know that we have to talk about this more, and I can't right now. - I gotta go to the office before dinner. - It'll have to wait. Fine. - Oh, hey. Here, let me help you. - Hey. Thank you. Thanks. Staying dry? Yeah. - Yeah. - Thanks. So we're having some people... ...back to our place later, if you wanna come by. Oh, well, I was supposed to go to a freshman barbecue. But considering the rain, I could be persuaded otherwise. Good. You'll come over then. - Hey, where's Ryan? - Left this morning. - He went home? - Yeah, some family emergency. Didn't seem like he wanted to talk. So I didn't push it. Well, I should call him. Or shouldn't I? I don't know, should I give him space? It's not easy being friends with your ex, is it? Look, you know Ryan better than I do, but... ...seems like whatever was happening, it was private. He'll tell you if he wants. I guess so. - Well, this thing's getting heavy. - Is that a hint? Yeah, thanks. - Here, I'll switch you. - Okay. Hi, I'm looking for Theresa. Is she home? I'm sorry. Miss Diaz won't be home until later. Can I help you? I'm Ryan Atwood. I'm an old friend. Say hi, Daniel. Hi, Daniel. This is Theresa's kid, huh? Yeah, she's a terrific mom. I'll be sure to tell her that you stopped by. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. Having a good time? Yeah, it seems like everyone is. Yeah, wait till tomorrow. Come Sunday, all these people... ...will be fighting for study carrels in the library. - That's gotta be tough. - Not everyone can handle it. I couldn't, anyway. You? Please. You're like the model freshman. You should have seen me last year. The truth is, this is my second stab at freshman year. Last go-around didn't go so well. Why? What happened? Let's see, 1.5 GPA... ...too much partying... ...went home after a few months. Realized I had to figure out what I wanted from college. I never would have guessed. Well, not all pre-freshman are as gung ho as you. You bought that? What? That was an act? Well, it wouldn't have been two years ago. I was the girl on Yearbook, Charity League, Social Chair. Whatever my mom told me to do. I got straight A's. Sometimes a B in math, but my dad was a whiz, so he'd help me. And then on the weekends, I rode my little sister's pony for fun. I even won some blue ribbons. And then what happened? Well, my dad lost all his money... ...the pony lost all its hair, and my mom kind of lost her mind. Also, I got kicked out of school... ...and my friend died. I guess everything happened. And then, at some point... ...I just stopped being the girl who belonged at college. Or anywhere, for that matter. Everyone belongs somewhere. Maybe not everyone. Maybe some people just get lost. I won't know anything till I talk to Theresa. - I'm just gonna wait. - Yeah, well, not to worry. I'm on the next flight. I'm waiting on my cab. Seth, you don't have to come home on my account. There are a lot of reasons, trust me. See you when I get home. - Get in. - Hey. Hey. - You're giving me a ride to the airport? - Eventually. My plane leaves in an hour, so... Well, that is just enough time to make a quick stop at RISD. You mean the Rhode Island School of Design? You're gonna apply, and this is your application. - Where did you get this? - l... I had my mom FedEx it. Just in case the Ironist failed... ...and Dr. Overbee didn't go for the quick quips and pop-culture-laden bromides. And I have an in there. - My cousin. - Anna. If you get in... ...you'll be in the same state. And the good news is, it is a very small state. I know, but it's one of the best art schools in the country. And as much as I love the face-to-face college rejection... ...I should just cut my losses on this. - Cohen? - Yeah? - Confidence. Remember? - Right. - Good. All right, we're going to RISD. - Kiki, you made it. - Hey, here's the man of the hour. - Good to see you, Neil. - You too, Sandy. - Hey, Julie. - Kirsten, you look lovely. Would you excuse us? Some doctors wanna meet this fella. That'd be great. Excuse me. What's wrong? Long story. And now you have to watch him work the crowd all night. - And it's because of me. - Julie, it's okay. - I wouldn't have bailed on you. - Then let me return the favor. Come on, let's go hide out by the crab dip. Maybe we could flirt with one of the bartenders. - Hi. - Hey. I just wanted to see if you were okay. Yeah. You bailed early too, huh? Yeah. Yeah, come in. - So Berkeley didn't live up to the hype? - Well, it's not really Berkeley's fault. - I was asking a lot. - To take you from every problem... ...you've ever had here? Something like that. So you don't have to tell me. It's Theresa. She did have a baby. - Oh, my God. - I haven't talked to her yet. So I'm not sure... ...if I'm the father or not. - What makes you think... ...you're the father and not Eddie? Because when I was at Berkeley, l... I just felt like I was living somebody else's life. And then I heard the news. And I was, like... back to being me. But when you were at Berkeley, it felt right, didn't it? I could see it on your face. Yeah. Yeah, it did. Well, then you'll get back there. No matter what happens with Theresa. Hello, everyone. As the new guy in these circles, I thank Neil and Julie... ...for inviting us here tonight. I welcome you all... ...to lend your talent and expertise to the new hospital. Because I am gonna need all the help I can get. As you know, behind every successful man is a very surprised woman. I'd like you to meet the former head of the Newport Group... ...and the brains behind the organization, my lovely wife, Kirsten Cohen. Kirsten, how do you think your husband is doing running the Newport Group? I guess she's still surprised. I'd like to propose a toast. To Sandy Cohen... ...who has told me countless times over the last year... ...how important this hospital is to him. Ouch. You know, they say that when you grow up, you marry your father. I thought I'd escaped that. Chardonnay? Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna? I know. Is your brain exploding? A little. - How did he explain himself? - He didn't. Well, he tried to. But you know how I get, Coop. The rage makes it hard to talk, or listen. Don't assume anything until you hear what he has to say. You don 't know for sure they're dating. So how was Berkeley, was it amazing? Yeah, I mean, it could be... ...if I was ready for it. I just don't know that I am. Well, I believe in you, Coop. I'll see you in eight short hours, okay? Okay. Bye. I am beyond happy for you right now. I'm like Christmas-morning- won-the-Iottery-level happy for you. The RISD guy only said he was impressed. He said "very impressed." And in these scenarios, "verys" are important. - Well, if I get in, it's all because of you. - No. It's your comic book. And your plane's about to leave. Well, thank you. Really. - All right. - Okay. See you soon. Call me. Will do. Ryan. Hi. I don't know how you found me. - Look, I just need to know. - He's not yours, Ryan. Eddie's the father. We got a paternity test and everything. I'm sorry that I wasn't honest with you... ...but I saw how your life opened up when you met the Cohens, and l... - Is Eddie helping you out? - Are you kidding? That bum. I would have, you know, for what it's worth. - I know. - Even if it hadn't been mine. I know, that's why I didn't tell you. But believe it or not, I'm doing okay on my own. - Yeah, seems like it. Saw the apartment. - Yeah. Yeah, I got a job at this hotel, and then I got promoted. And I got promoted again and again. And suddenly I have myself a career. And a kid. Daniel. - Yeah. - How is he? How much time do you have? I don't know. You wanna grab a bite? You can tell me about him. Yeah, I'd like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It's good to see you again, Ryan.
