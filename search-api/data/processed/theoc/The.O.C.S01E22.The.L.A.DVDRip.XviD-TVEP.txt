Previously on The Valley: I don 't feel like I fit here in Tarzana. You owe it to yourself. Get out. Get free. - Why do I need to leave? You're here. - Exactly. - Luke. - Luke came by to defrag my hard drive. - You look so hot. - Now, forgive me... ...this can't possibly be happening, right? I'm crazy. I have this whole life to figure out. And so does Ryan. Take care of him. I'll see you. So then did you take your watch off during the deed, or what exactly? Wanna wait in the car? I can pick this up myself. No, I got more questions. I don't understand... ...did you take it off before foreplay? - That would seem presumptuous... - No, seriously... I like to leave the watch on. I like to leave it on to know how I'm doing... ...if I'm beating my old time. It's sort of a sex marathon, not a sex sprint. Excuse me. Hi. I called earlier about the watch that was left here. Room 204, right? Yeah. Such a nice girl was staying in there. Beautiful too. Your girlfriend? - Okay. That's a little awkward. - No, she's not. But thank you. A girl like that? - You'd be a lucky guy if you could... - Thank you for your time. Or his time. The timepiece. Thanks a lot. One day, we'll look back on that and we'll laugh. We'll laugh, laugh some more, have a good laugh. Not at my timepiece joke, but at the situation. I'm fine. Theresa's back with Eddie... ...where she should be. Right? - Yes. Absolutely. This is a good time for Ryan Atwood. This is "Clean-Slate Ryan." Finally, you have no women to protect from violent, goateed factory workers... ...or pill-popping manic-depressives. - You're right. - I really do have a clean slate. - You do. Dude, since day one of you getting here... ...it's been nothing but lady drama with you. Marissa, Theresa, Luke, Oliver, Eddie. - I'm exhausted just thinking about it. - I am kind of tired. Should be. But you know what? You're gonna get a break. You deserve it. Think I'm gonna declare this month... ...Angst-Free Ryan Month. - Think it'll last all month? Angst-Free Ryan Week. With an option for an additional week, if you like it. - Okay. Thanks, bud. - Right on. Hey. What's Luke doing here? - Tell him about your watch? - No. Why would I? It didn't even last the night. I can't believe they were at a motel. It's just... It's so cheap. It's so tawdry. Yeah. That's the real moral of the story here. You know we're gonna have to see Luke at school today, right? How could he do it? I mean, I get how he could do it, it's Mrs. Cooper, but... What about her? It's her daughter's ex-boyfriend. - Lf Marissa found out... - No. She cannot find out. - She doesn't handle bad news well. - It's gotta end... ...before she finds out. - I agree. Maybe you should take the reins on this one. I would, but I feel like it's more your speed. Sandy, Jimmy's here. Hot, hot, hot. Hey. - How are you, Jimmy? - We're screwed. Oh, good. Nothing like a little optimism in the morning. I'm serious. Opening day is around the corner. We've got no contractor, no designer. - When did you last look at the books? - I don't. That's your job. Well, we've basically blown through our entire budget. You're really not so good at managing the money, are you? No. I'm really not. - How did that happen? - Construction, labor, permits. Oh, wow. A letter from Hailey. She's an aerobics instructor at Club Med in Turks and Caicos. Turks and Caicos? Wow. - Unbelievable. - That is unbelievable. Hailey got a job. So I'm gonna spend the weekend interviewing designers. Not that we can afford any of them. Julie's gonna take Marissa so I can work. I better get to work so I can make some more money that you and I can lose. So you want a designer on the cheap? How cheap? Like, free? Free is cheap. Julie. No. No way. - She's good. - Yeah. At manipulating others. And backstabbing, pot-stirring... ...generally creating an atmosphere of hate and distrust. Did a nice job on the Newport Group offices. They were elegant and tasteful. It was shocking, really. This restaurant is supposed to be my oasis, my happy place. A place to rebuild after Julie. Not a... She's not doing to The Lighthouse what she did to my marriage. Free is cheap, Jimmy. I mean, what choice do we have? You asked me, Coop, and I think it's best. You need some time off. Ever since I've known you, you've had a boyfriend. You're right. You need to be independent. How else are you gonna find a new guy? You can't be with someone until you can be by yourself. - I can be by myself. - And by "yourself"... ...I mean still hanging out with me. - Okay, good. Thank God. What's going on over here? - Can I have a hug? - Grady had a late night. I don't know. I guess they're filming something. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Coop! - What? What? Grady Bridges. - Who's Grady Bridges? - Jake Needleman, <i>The Valley</i>. - He is so cute. - Really? You think? Yeah. Not in your traditional way, but he's hilarious. He's so funny. I hear he, like, improvises all of his scenes. Let's go say hi. Be cool, okay? Hey, Grady, we're your biggest fans. The Valley is my favorite show. - Thank you. Cool. I'm glad you like it. - I love it. Obsessed. Addicted. - So, what are you guys doing here? - We are on what they call "location"... ...which means we're shooting a scene... My character starts dating this girl from Newport. - No, you'll ruin it! - Okay. Okay. - Are you as obsessed as she is? - Actually, I've never seen your show... - Coop! - What? - See, now that's funny. - Oh, that was funny. That was funny. Funny girl. Maybe they're not having sex. Maybe they just spoon and watch <i>Charlie Rose.</i> You're right. That's probably it. Oh, my God, you guys. We have the craziest news ever. I mean, nothing you could tell us could top this. We met Grady Bridges. Star of <i>The Valley</i>, the best show ever. Okay. Anyway, he invited us to his birthday party tomorrow night. The star of a hit TV show invited you to his cool Hollywood birthday party? - That is awesome. - There's no need for jealousy. - I'd never date an actor. - Really? Yes. - I got us a couple of plus-ones. - Great. I have to show everybody the pictures of me and Grady. Thank God I had my camera phone. They're the autograph of the 21 st century. Summer, I'd like to see these photos. Why don't we share. - So how's Theresa? - She's good. She's back with Eddie. - Have you talked to her since she left? - Yeah, we have... ...but we're taking some time apart. - Best thing, I guess. - Yeah. - Oh, we should go. - Yeah. Good light. Exposed brick, it's a bit '80s, but these trends are cyclical. South-facing windows. These floors could be sanded. And the beams are rather oppressive. Some white enamel could lighten it right up. - I'll do it. - Now, you know we can't pay you. Well, everybody has to start somewhere. And the value it'll add to my portfolio alone will be worth it. It'll be my calling card. And we should get started right away. You will have to pay for the floors, the linens, the silverware. Unless you want patrons eating with their hands, like Jimmy does. Happy place. Happy place. Happy place. How much, Julie? What do you think, Kirsten? Low six? What? We don't have that money. Are you skimming off the top? No, sweetie. That was you. My oasis is being violated. My happy place is very unhappy right now. Now calm down, Jimbo. Just breathe. - I could pitch in. - No. No. Please. I appreciate it, I do. But don't. I mean, separation of church and state. This is my thing. So, what are you saying? That this is your happy place? - No. - Caleb could help. No. This is my happy place. It's my oasis from the rich and insufferable. It'd be a good investment for him. And the best thing for you two. No. It would be the worst. It would... No. - Kirsten, please back me up. - He could be a silent partner. A silent assassin. He would ruin everything. He'd want goulash on the menu. I don't think we have a choice. We can't raise that kind of cash. - Hey, man. What's up? - Nothing. So did you have sex with Julie Cooper today? - What...? What...? - I saw you at the motel. What are you thinking, man? Marissa's mom? I know. I know what that must have looked like... ...or seemed like, but it's not like that. - We've got a connection. - Yeah, not anymore, you don't. - Lf Marissa finds out... - She won't. Just like she didn't find out about you in Tijuana? It's a small town. People find out, then they talk. It's only a matter of time. I've never felt this way about a girl, a woman, before. Yeah, I don't care. Tomorrow, Marissa's going to L.A. You, you're going to Julie's. It's gonna end. Got it? It's gonna end. Hey, man. What are you doing? Watching <i>The Valley</i>. I picked it up on DVD. - Yeah? I talked to Luke. - Would you just give me... ...till the end of the episode, please? - Is that Grady? - Yeah. - He's kind of like you. - What, handsome and charming? Geeky and sarcastic. Oh, God. He is like me. He is like me, except with his own TV show. - I was kidding. He's just a character... - No, no. He improvises all his lines. That's totally him. And he's totally me. Except on a prime-time soap. And, Ryan... ...if you could have the real me or the TV me... ...which would you take? You'd take the TV me. We're not going to L.A. I'm gonna lose Summer to the real-life TV me. No. We're going to L.A. We're taking the girls. Luke's breaking up with Julie while we're gone. - You took care of it? - Yeah. That's good. I told you you'd be back to "Angst-Free Ryan" in no time. I'll get it. Hey. - Can we talk? - Sure. - So I'm not going to L.A. - What? Why? You know how you said sometimes time apart is the best thing? Well, I think time apart might be the best thing... ...for us. - You do? Since you showed up, it's been pretty intense. Good and bad, but intense. And I don't know, maybe we just need to be away from each other. Independent... ...for a little while. You wanna start this independent thing today? We both have clean slates. This is a good time for us to be by ourselves. So you go to L.A., and I'm gonna spend some time with my mom. See you. So that was it? That's your big plan you had to sleep on? - Lf I don't go, Marissa will. - Fine. Except you're going. - Will your parents let us go? - I'll handle it. - You're gonna lie? - No, that was the old me. I've evolved. I'm a man of honor. So I need you to talk to them. It's your specialty. Seems like a lot of things are my specialty. Yeah, well, great leadership's all about delegation. - So now I'm your employee? - No. We're partners. - What do you do? - I'm working on the business plan, okay? And that's gonna be awesome. I just need you to convince my parents, convince Marissa... ...and I'm gonna supervise. God, it's so easy. I should go into business for myself. We crane up through the bushes. That's perfect. I'm sorry, Ryan, is it just me, or do my parents get better-Iooking every day? - Here we go. - What? - What do you want, Seth? - Can't a child just admire the beauty... ...of his parents in the morning light? You don't look a day over perfection. - Also, there's a party in Hollywood. - No. - Why? - I don't have to tell you why. - I'm just telling you no. - See what you're doing here? - I do. - I'm trying to tell you the truth... ...and establish trust here. I could've lied. I could've easily said I was going to Comicon or an IMAX movie. - All these devices at my fingertips. - I knew you never went to that movie. - Tag. You're tagged in. - Yeah. Okay. It's a birthday party. We'll be home by midnight. No drinking, drugs or fighting. - See? - Now that we've covered the obvious... - Whose birthday? - Grady Bridges. - Oh, the guy from <i>The Valley</i>? - Yes. - I love him. He's so cute. - Yeah, and, you guys... ...he can get any girl in the world he wants. Right now he wants Summer. Okay? I have to go. Please. I have to go. You call when you get there, and you're home by 11:30. Don't spend an extra minute in L.A. The town will steal your soul. It's about to steal my girlfriend. I'm the only thing... ...standing between Summer and a development deal. Thank you. Can you get me an autograph? Your cell phone takes pictures, right? - Now you have to convince Marissa. - Gonna make me do that too? We're business partners. We serve different functions. I'm the brains, you're the brawn. I'm in the ivory tower... ...you're down there on the streets, making it happen. - Hey. - Call you back. So when I said we needed to spend some time apart... ...I meant more than a couple hours. - I know. - What's that? - Luke's puka shells. I just found them. Blast from the past, huh? Okay. Here's the thing. Not going to L.A. Because I'm not going, that's not independent. To be really independent, we both need to go to L.A. Independently. - But together at the same time. - You sound like Seth. I know, it rubs off. Look, I gotta go. - Seth, unsupervised in a big city... - Okay. No, I get that. Okay. And I don't want you to miss out because of me. And, you know, we haven't had fun in a long time. - This is gonna be fun. - Usually you don't think anything's fun. - It's always me talking you into going. - People change. And we're gonna be living in the same town, right? You know, going to the same school. And we're friends, yes? So, you know, we're gonna have to do things independently. - But together. - You're right. So you really want me to go? It's not about what I want. It's about what you need. Okay. Maybe, a little. - All right. Let me just go get ready. - All right. Cool. - So you need me, Sanford? - Here we go. - Dad. - Look, you did me a favor. - It's my turn to do one for you. - Don't do me any favors. Let's hear him out. Okay? - Your chef. What's he done? - Nothing, really. TV dinners mostly. He's terrible. - Look, I know when I'm not wanted. - And yet you're always at our house. Marco was a sous chef at Aubergine. He's fantastic. - Aubergine, that's a good spot. - He could prepare... ...some meals for you tonight. - Good thinking. I can't, I'm busy. I'm having dinner with the board of the philharmonic. Doesn't that include the editor in chief of <i>Riviera Magazine</i>... ...the owner of the <i>Daily Pilot</i>, owner of the Mighty Ducks? Yeah, well, some of them used to be Jimmy's clients, before... - Point being there, Julie? - They're the tastemakers... ...of Newport Beach. Why don't you have Marco cook for them. You can't buy free publicity like that. If you have a restaurant, you gotta cook for a lot of people. "If you have a restaurant, you gotta cook for a lot of people." - That's our mission statement. - We need the money, the press. - I know. - Good idea, Jules. We just gutted the place. There's dust all over. There's no furniture. We can do it at our house. The kids are on their way to L.A. It's perfect. Oh, my God. We haven't moved in... It's been forever now. How do people live like this? How do you do it? I don't know. Times like these I wish we had a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I always wish we had one. It's a flying car. You know, my mom's never home anymore. She's always sending Kaitlin to my grandma's. Know what it sounds like to me, as a child of divorce? - Think she's having an affair? - When my mom started blowing me off... Oh, it's a flying car! No, my bad. Actually, that's a plane. - She's probably just working a lot. - She's a professional woman. - Yeah, busy. - Getting busy. - Who you think's gonna be there tonight? - I hope Orlando Bloom. - Legolas is so hot. - Right on. I'm hoping for a little... ...Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, maybe Kate Bosworth myself... What? It's okay for you to pine over Legolas? Yeah, he's an Elf. He saved Middle-earth. That is a huge part of European history. Don't worry about it. Tonight's gonna be fun. Luke better get it done. Well, see you soonishly. What about that date, Juju? Let's just see how tonight goes, Caleb. I want you focused. Bye. - Hey. We need to talk. - Luke. - What if Caleb saw you? - Yeah, what are you doing with him? Shouldn't he be washing his dentures? Are you guys back together? - Don't start. - You were just using me... ...until Grandpa came back? Okay. But I don't have a lot of time. - Okay, but we'll talk after? - Yeah, yeah, come on. - Who let that heavy-set girl in? - That was a guy. Hey, girls, what's up? - I'm glad you made it. - Hey. I wanna introduce you to some people. - Wait. - How does that guy play high-school? Hollywood, man. I thought it was a clich Á, young Hollywood doing coke with strippers. I didn't even think they ate bread anymore. Can I borrow your phone? Boys, I want you to meet some people. This is Summer, Marissa and some guy. - Are they on the show? - No. This is Team Grady, right? This is my agent, this is my manager, this is my lawyer, this is my publicist. And then this is my producing partner. - You have a producing partner? - We control several properties, man. - Just got the rights to <i>The Golden Girls</i>. - Oh, my God. No way! Yeah. We're gonna make it into a movie, but we're gonna make the Golden Girls... ...you know, young and hot. - Oh. Luke, it's me. I wanted to make sure you took care of it. Take care of it. - Hey. - Hey. - So do you want to meet the cast? - Not really. You? Yeah. Not really. - Excuse me. - Well... - Oh, my God. What is with you? - What? - Relax. All you L.A. Chicks are so lame. - We're not from L.A. We're from Orange County. Orange County? - She said, "Ew." - Glad we're not the ones fighting. Yeah, glad we're not one of those couples. Or any kind of couple. - Right. It's definitely better. - Yep. Hey there. Having fun yet? - Hailey? - Ryan? - What are you...? - What are you...? Hailey, keep it moving. Couples pay extra. Gotta go. - Is that...? - Kirsten's sister, Hailey. - Does Kirsten know she's here? - I doubt it. This is Kirsten's worst nightmare. All she does is worry about her. I'm late. I thought we were only gonna do it once. - Can we talk now? Because I really... - Can't, gotta go be with the adults. I'll talk to you later. Newport used to be a glamorous town. An escape for Hollywood stars like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum. The Lighthouse could be our chance to bring those people back. Wait, Cal. I don't think even The Lighthouse can bring back the Duke. What I mean is, we think The Lighthouse is step one... ...in the renaissance of Newport for destination dining... ...a magnet for glitz and glamour... ...and, well, cash. Look, Jimmy and I view The Lighthouse as a chance... ...to restore the restaurant to its former glory. It's just something from Newport, for Newport. We think it can be a bit of both. An icon of the past. - A beacon for the future. - A bridge from the past to the present. From Newport to the rest of the world. - Hello, everybody. - Hey, Julie. So sorry I'm late. I hope I didn't miss anything. - Hey. - You are glowing. Well, I'm just so excited. You have one new message. Luke, it's me. I'm just calling to make sure you took care of it. Take care of it. Hey. Are you happy, Coop? These the kind of people we want? Because we're gonna be stuck with them. I know, Sandy. It's not what we wanted exactly. It's exactly not what we wanted at all. Look, we need the money. Without Caleb, we've got nothing. Maybe nothing is better. That's an easy position to take if you have another job. This is all I have. - Hello? - Sandy, hey, it's me. - Ryan? Is everything okay? - Not really. - We found Hailey. - What do you mean, you found Hailey? - Hailey? - Well, she got a job... ...as a stripper. - There are strippers at this party? - Strippers? I never should've agreed to this. - What do you want us to do? - <i>There's nothing you can do.</i> - Hailey is not your responsibility. - Where are they? Is she okay? - What club are you at? - It's Luna Chicks. Luna Chicks? Well, that's just great. - What are you gonna do? - I will deal with Hailey tomorrow. Meanwhile, I want you guys home. Pronto. All right. - What's going on? - They found Hailey. - Working as a stripper at this party. - Is she okay? No, of course not, no. She's Hailey. Should we do something? You know what? We should not let Hailey ruin another evening. We got enough to contend with, and if Kirsten finds out about this... - I don't know... - We'll deal with it tomorrow. - Everything is going so well. - Everyone seems really excited. What the hell is that smell? - What are we cooking here? - Meat loaf. It's my mother's specialty. I have the most important people in the county in there... ...the most sophisticated palates in Newport... ...and you offer them Nana Cohen's meat loaf? - Dad. It's their menu. - The menu of lunatics. This is a disaster. I'll have to call Catherine Zeta-Jones' people. I was trying to get her for the opening. How quickly can you get to the Crab Shack and pick up some fresh tuna? Whoa. No, Marco. This is our restaurant. You don't have a restaurant without me and you don't have me with meat loaf. Well, then, maybe we're better off. A man's life comes down to a few decisive moments... ...and maybe this meat loaf is one of them. This restaurant was supposed to be fun. If you wanna go and ruin everything that this restaurant is about... ...then go ahead. Fine. I don't want any part of it. Good night. Good luck. That's why the man is bankrupt. Do what you like. Sink the ship. But make it quick. I'm starving. Hey, Marco, there's a lot riding on this meat loaf. - Julie, is that a...? - Curling-iron burn. Yeah. I'm gonna go check on Cal. - This place is too crowded. - Soon as we find Seth and Summer... ...we're out of here. - And Hailey. - I don't know. It's none of my business. - Yeah, it is. It's your family. We need to find her and get out of here. All right, you wait here. If you see Seth, don't let him move. - And I'll just go try to find her. - Not without me. Come on. Cheers, cheers. To me, in all my glory... ...and a second season. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. How's it going? - I'm so exhausted. - Yeah? I've been up all night working on my thesis. "Magical Realism in American Literature." Familiar with the works of Thomas Pynchon? - I've only read <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>. - <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> is his masterpiece. - Don't tell anyone I'm in grad school. - Okay. So I've got a new episode that hasn't aired yet. You wanna see it? - No way. You have a new episode? - Yeah, on tape. Yeah? Yeah. Hold on, I just have to... Oh, yeah, no. I'm not armed or anything. - Yeah, that's a... - Camera phone. It's the autograph of the 21 st century. Yeah. That's what they say. That's what they say. Let's go. Call me sometime. I will. There you are. - I thought you'd flown the coop as well. - Just trying to get a little peace and quiet. Wax philosophical about why your partner up and quit. He hasn't quit. He went after Hailey. What are you talking about? Hailey's in Club Med. Oh, she's in a club, but in Hollywood, working as a stripper. Ryan just called. They found her. Anyway, that's where my partner went. And that's why he's my partner. This is so cool. You're here, and here. It's awesome. - <i>I'm out of here. "La-tro."</i> - Oh, my God. I bet that was improvised. - Listen, I'm really glad that you came... - No, wait. I wanna watch. Why? I'm not in this scene. It's just so good. I wish I was from the Valley. - Hey, where's Summer? - I don't know, off with Grady somewhere. I talk about Pynchon for two seconds, suddenly she's gone. - I got something else for you. - Dude. You have a clean slate now, so if I was you... ...I'd procure a little private dance time with... - Oh, my God. That's Hailey. - Yeah. That's what l... Hey, hey, what the hell are you doing? I thought you were an aerobics instructor in the Caribbean or something. I figured the truth wouldn't go over so well. My mom will freak when she finds out. Don't tell her. Not that she'd care. She would if she knew what you're doing. What's wrong with it? I make good money, I'm on my own. You look terrible. You work here? Let me just grab my girlfriend, and we'll go figure it out. What, tired today? Didn't do enough coke? Hey, take it easy, man. - Get back to work. - Don't tell her what to do. - Excuse me? You got a problem? - Yeah, yeah. - I do. - No, he doesn't. I'm sorry. We're gonna grab my girlfriend and grab my aunt... ...more gently than you, and we'll leave. - You're leaving now. Get them out of my club. Out, out, out. Bye. Nice meeting you. I don't wanna see them in my club again. - Are we gonna just leave Hailey here? - I don't think we have a choice. - We can't leave without her. - I can't get ahold of Summer. I think we should split up. Let's scale a wall. Find a fire escape. Climb through a window. The usual. I was all-camp "Capture the Flag," Camp Tuckahoe. I'm very stealth. That's kind of dewy. I'm gonna go around. - We're going to the VIP entrance. - We're not VIP. This is Hollywood. Meet me in a minute. I have an idea. This meat loaf is fantastic. This is what we had planned. Back to basics. Comfort food. What's old is new again. I couldn't have said that better myself. - Even though I already did. - So glad that you like it. - I'm going to get more wine. Anyone? - Oh, terrific. Juju. Bring the wine, dear. This one's empty. I'm gonna get another. What the hell are you doing here? - We need to talk. - Wait outside my house. Go hide in the bushes or something. Go! Go! Back to work. I told you, VIPs only. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I love you so much! You are my favorite character. - Do you watch <i>The Valley</i>? - No, I have a job. It's only, like, the best show ever. You are actually a little shorter than I imagined, but still, so hot. - Thanks. - You here for the party? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Wait, can I come with you? Seriously, it would mean so much to me. It really is my favorite show. Take advantage, kid. You're only a teen idol once. - Thanks, buddy. - Thanks too. I can't believe we're watching dailies. But, seriously, which take did you like better? Because I kind of like the acting in that one, you know. But the lighting wasn't as good as the one before. Okay, I don't know. Could we go back to the party? This is boring. Well, how about some music? That'll liven it up. Little party in here. Party in my Caddy. - What's this? - This is my band. - It's our first CD. - No kidding. I like you. I don't know why, but you just... You've got... You just got something, you know? I'm a big fan of yours. - Oh, my God. What are you doing? - What...? - Cohen. - Summer. - Hi. - Hi. I heard really awful music... ...and I knew it could only be self-indulgent actors with instruments. - What are you doing? - Leaving. - Grady, there you are. - April, hi. Oh, my God. You're on the show. - You're the best thing on the show. - What are you doing with her? - I... - Wait. You two are dating? Oh, God. Don't you think that's a bad idea? What if things don't work out and you guys break up? - Isn't that bad for the show? - Guess we're about to find out. Whoa... April! Hey, lock up the car for me, please. April, wait. Hey. I'm sorry. Let's go home. Someplace with real people. Think we'll find that at home? We live in Newport Beach. Let's just get out of L.A. I love her, and she loves me. Is that a new episode? - Oh, Grady's probably ad-libbing. - I already saw it. - What are you guys doing? - Come with us. Your whole "save the stripper" campaign is sweet, but I'm fine. - Oh, you're fine? - Yeah. Get out of here quick, before he sees you. No, not without you. Look, we came... - What you doing in my club? - Get your hand off me. Gonna have a problem now. Out. You too, Hailey. Goodbye. Goodbye, Hailey. What are you gonna do now, big shot? What are you gonna do now? What are you gonna do, hit a kid? Dad? - What are you, the dad? - What are you? The guy who's my age and still thinks he's 25? You keep your kids out of my club. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Look, Sandy got held up, so... - That's okay. Thank you. Why don't you guys head back. I'm gonna give Hailey a lift. Okay, we'll just go find Seth and Summer. All right. Drive safe. I wish you would've called first. I would've washed my hair. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just was supposed to get a job managing this other bar... ...and it fell through... ...and I needed money... - It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. So you wanna come home? Yeah. And could we have parked any further away? Hey. We get to look forward to a little Saturday-night rush hour. You know, I think we did pretty good in there, man. I told you we make a good team. I'm the brains, you're the brawn. How come you're the brains? I talked us back into the club. I'm sorry. I'm the brains. - You can be the beauty. - Okay, thanks. You're the beauty, he's the brawn, I'm the brains. Great. And what am I, Cohen? - The boobs? The bitch? - Okay. - I'll take "the boobs." - Hey, so will I. I've never seen so much meat loaf in my life. It was a beautiful sight. Hey. Where were you? It went great. I have a surprise. Oh, my God. Yeah. I just picked her up from the airport. - Fresh from Turks and Caicos. - I hear that's the best Club Med there is. I can't wait to hear the details. Thanks, Jimmy. For bringing her back. - Why don't I draw you a bath. - Yeah. Well, we should wrap this up. - Do some business. - And there is my cue. You boys discuss the money. Call me when you want to discuss linens. Okay, fellas, I'm in. - And we'll do it your way. - It's the only way we could do it. You guys were right. At the end of the day... ...it's good food, good people coming together. - Tonight was a good start. - Apparently. Thanks. - Luke, what is so important that...? - We can't do this anymore. Excuse me? You're breaking up with me? It's just... It's not a good idea. And it never could've worked. You're right. Well, okay. Right. Okay. Hi, Cal. It's me. When you're ready for that date, let me know. Can't believe they're watching The Valley after all that. Hey, Summer says it's addictive. So is it okay if I hang out in here? Not watching TV? Yeah, sure. So did you have fun tonight? Watching you get kicked out of a club? Twice? - Yeah, actually, I kind of did. - You were pretty good with the bouncer. - Impressed? - I kind of was. - See, I think I should be the brains. - No. Seth's the brains. - Well, you're clearly not the beauty. - And now someone's the bitch. - Oh, really? Okay. - Yeah. Hey, hey. - Come on, fight back. - All right. - I win. - Yeah. Yeah, you win. I'll be right back. - Hey, Mrs. Cohen. Is Ryan around? - Yeah. He's in the pool house. - Luke. - It's over. - I'm done having sex with Julie Cooper. - Okay. Marissa. - You... - Okay. Wait, wait. Just stop. Marissa. - So that's why you took me to L.A.?
