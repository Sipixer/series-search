-I've had enough. -I'm just getting started. -You almost kissed Cohen? -lt was not a kiss. It was a nose graze. I talked to Wildstorm. I set up a meeting. We're going to San Diego. Sandy, I've had a couple strokes. -Rebecca Bloom. You still love her. -She's dead. -How'd she take my return? -I haven't told her. I don't want her to be an accomplice. Sandy? Is that you? Rebecca? Ryan, I had no idea you felt this way. Don't look at me. There were here when I came in. Hey, you do realize Valentine's Day is tomorrow, right? We're starting a little earlier this year. Your mother deserves a long holiday... ...what with your grandfather in the hospital. And you burning the midnight oil as much as you have. Give me a hand. The rest are in the car. You got more flowers? There's such a thing as overkill. Man, your parents are pretty hardcore about Valentine's Day. I just hope I survive this hateful holiday. -Still broken up over the Alex breakup? -No. That's emotional child's play compared to what we're dealing with now, Ryan. Summer's back. -What? -Yes. And I don't want it be. Believe me. -But the universe has other plans for us. -The universe is involved now. Why would I have to go to San Diego with her... ...on the one-year anniversary of our sexual tête-à-tête... -...or pas de deux, if you will? -As long as it's not a ménage à trois. Since you'll be going to San Diego with Zach, her boyfriend. -Yeah, and my friend. -Yeah. I don't wanna go to San Diego. I don't wanna go near Summer. -No, but the universe. -Yeah, exactly. It shouldn't be a problem for you. You and Summer have been friends for a while now, right? Yes. And I'd be a little more confident about my chances of cheating fate... ...and not cheating if Summer and I hadn't made out. -You guys made out? -No. But our noses grazed. And it was, like, the most sexually charged nose graze... ...in the history of nose grazes. It's essentially nose humping, is what it is. -So, what am I gonna do? -I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna go to San Diego with your friend and her boyfriend. And you're gonna keep it in your trousers. Nothing can happen. -Got it? -Yeah. I have no heart. -I hate Valentine's Day. -That's why you're my son. What about you? Anything for Lindsay? We're taking a break. She's getting to know her dad. So for Valentine's Day you're getting her Grandpa? -Yeah. And that's bad, right? -Dad, step in here. Help a brother out. This guy's got mad Valentine's skills, bitch. Word, son. I hope I've learned something after 20 years with your dear mother. -Right. It's her favorite holiday. -Yeah. Which means she's probably gearing up for the cupid routine right now. Here's my valentine. Looks like I'm not the only one at odds with the universe. I think I know what this is about. And I can explain. You lied to me, Sandy. -I didn't lie. -You told me Rebecca was dead. -When I told you that, I thought she was. -I went to your office. She was there. -You saw her. -And then I came home... ...you and I had dinner, and nothing. You didn't say a word. She's accused of a very serious crime. Anything I would tell you about her could make you an accessory. Don't try to get off on a technicality. This is about our marriage. -You and I come first. -I did what I thought I had to do. -She's innocent. And she's my client. -She's not just your client. You were in love with her. Don't pretend this isn't complicated. You're damn right it's complicated. Look. There's nothing going on between us. Oh, please, let's not fight. Tomorrow's Valentine's Day. Happy day before Valentine's Day. Okay. You said that we should take a break. In relationship speak, they call this "mixed signals. " I know. But it didn't occur to me that Valentine's Day was coming up. You didn't wanna be alone on Valentine's Day. -You're such a girl. -So, what do you think? Can we take some time off from taking time off? -Sure. If you do something for me. -Yeah. Name it. Anything. Apologize to Caleb. -Except that. -I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm gonna spend time there while he's recuperating. If you two are at each other's throats, it will be uncomfortable for everyone. So if I apologize, I get to take you out for Valentine's Day? Me and Cal. Happy to do it. Zach? Hey, Cohen. You're early. Yeah. I just wanted to stop by and check in before Zach got here... -...and sort of touch base. -Something you wanna talk about? Something you wanna talk about? What? -You came here. -Yeah, I know. I know. I just wanted to make sure... ...that you're dressing warmly. And you are. Great. You know, there is something I wanna ask you. -Yeah? -Yeah. Are these too bling for our meeting? -I don't wanna come off trashy. -No. I think they're fine. Listen, Summer. I know that the three of us sometimes... ...working together can get pretty weird. And so I just have to say that if it ever maybe gets to be too much for you-- Hey, broken record, I'm fine. I just want us to kick ass on our pitch. I really care about this comic book. What? Is that so hard to believe? -You guys ready to hit the road? -Hey. Did you MapQuest the meeting? -Yep. I got directions. Got snacks. -I was gonna pack snacks. -The motor's running. -Shotgun. -All right. -Come on. Move it, Cohen. San Diego's not driving to us. For God's sake, the door's 1 0 feet away. Must I be humiliated in this chair? Oh, Dad, just humor us. You can lose the chair when you get home. That reminds me. I brought you a little care package. That's very thoughtful of you. Mad Libs. Those were my favorite when I was a kid. Well. I hope you'll be around long enough to teach me how to play. Julie's still gallivanting around in Europe. Which means I've got that big old house all to myself. Well, what about Marissa? Marissa can't be bothered. She's busy running around with that tattooed new friend of hers. Well, if you're looking for company... ...I know that Ryan wanted to stop by for a visit. -I think I've seen enough of him. -Lindsay, why don't you go find... -...the chauffeur and see if he'll pull up. -Sure. You and Lindsay seem to be making strides. I regret coming into her life so late. You know how you can make it up to her? -Make things right with Ryan. -What is it with my girls and that kid? -Dad -Fine. Fine. Lindsay. Can three people play Mad Libs? Sure. Why? Well, I thought it might be quite nice to invite Ryan over for a round. I understand he's handy with an adverb. Yeah. I'll call him right now. Are the Olsens making records now? -I don't know. You don't like it? -No. If she doesn't like your music she'll drive you off the road. Cohen, that was so your fault. He drove us into a ditch on our way to Tijuana. -You did the TJ thing? -We pit-stopped on the way to TJ also. God, we had to spend this night in this sleazy-ass hellhole. -Seriously, it was like hepatitis central. -Okay, it wasn't that bad. Hello, Cohen. The bed was, like, covered with all these tiny little curly hairs. Oh, really? Well, I seem to remember you begging me for a spot on that bed. So who won? Who got the bed? -I think we worked it out. I don't know. -I don't really remember. Thank you. I'm home. Anyone here? Hello? I'm home. -How's the ticker? -Ticking. Thankfully. I wasn't expecting you today. I cancelled my trip to Nice so I could come home and keep you company. But I see you're already doing fine in that department. -Hi, Julie. -Lindsay. Hello. Lindsay's making us some lunch. -Tuna sandwiches. -Want one? I'll pass. Thanks. But it's nice to see you two have grown so close since I've been gone. Well, Juju, Lindsay and l are in the midst of some Mad Libs. -I'm sure you wanna go freshen up. -Fine. I can take a hint. Well, make yourself at home. Caleb's casa es su casa. Okay. Plural noun. Marissa? -Honey, it's 1 :00 in the afternoon. -Oh, get out, Mom. I'm sleeping. You and your stepfather are quite the Welcome Wagon. -Do you want something? -Just to say hello to my daughter. And to give you this. It's a Chanel clutch. Every girl I saw in Paris was carrying one of these. Thanks. You can leave it on the dresser. Marissa. You know... ...when I was in Europe I did some real soul-searching. -I hope you didn't hurt yourself. -I'm trying to talk to you. -I know that you've been angry with me. -What gives you that idea? And you have your reasons. I think it's time to put those memories behind us. It's time we became friends again. Let's go to dinner. The two of us. Thanks, Mom. But I'm not that lame. -What if I took away your BlackBerry? -Okay. And your cell phone. -You can't take away my cell phone. -Oh, I think I just did. You gonna throw the bedroom furniture in the pool now? That's great. You want to become friends, so you're blackmailing me. That's a great plan, Mom. I'll see you at dinner. -Not bad. -Well, it beats living in my office. Your office was fine. It was the running into Kirsten part that was rough. She must be furious. Some poor roses took the brunt of it this morning. I know I've complicated your life lately. And to thank you, I got you a little Valentine's gift. When I saw it, I couldn't resist. Gandhi. Every time I see this... ...I think of you snoring right next to me in that theater. -I couldn't help it. It's a long movie. -lt was our first date. -lt was a lousy first-date movie. -You're right. Okay. I know that look. -You wanna talk. -Oh, here's the thing. I don't think I'm the best lawyer for you. I'm not well-schooled in amnesty cases-- -And it might strain your marriage. -That too. -Okay. -I know you wanna put this behind you. -I want it over too. -But you and l, spending day after day... ...poring over my case, our meetings stretching into the wee hours.... There are days I think Kirsten and me are bulletproof. I don't wanna test that theory. I should have seen this coming. One thing I know about you, Sandy Cohen. -You always do the right thing. -I'll get you a list of the best lawyers. You're gonna get through this. I wish I was getting through this with you. Well. Be careful what you wish for. Hey there. -How's your father doing? -He's okay. -And you? -About the same. The credit card company called to verify... ...that you're staying at the lnn at Playa del Rey. It's for Rebecca. So she doesn't have to stay at my office. I know you're being put in the middle of this. But if you wanna take her case, I'm not gonna stand in your way. -I'm not gonna be her lawyer. -Not because of me. It is because of you. I know not to mess with you on Valentine's Day. -Sandy-- -You didn't force me to do anything. Maybe this is selfish of me. -But I have to say, I'm happy. -Good. There's one thing you could do for me. Find a restaurant that still has a reservation open for tomorrow night. I don't want takeout on Valentine's Day. What are you in the mood for? Something with a view of the ocean, and an overpriced prix fixe menu. -Sounds like The Arches. -Perfect. I'll call them right now. Hey, this is the last of these. So should we make more copies? You don't have to hang around all day to help me. Please. Any excuse to avoid my house. My mom's been home for, like, three hours, and already I'm going insane. My mom used to drive me crazy too. One day I decided I wasn't gonna let it bother me anymore. -You make it sound so easy. -Every time my mom channels Satan... ...I take a deep breath, count to three, give her a smile and say something like: "lnteresting idea, Mom. I'll give it some thought. " -And that really works? -Women like that thrive on confrontation. But if you refuse to engage, there's nothing they can do... -...which makes them go more crazy. -That's a fun way to spend an evening. But anyone who can make my mom even crazier gets a free dinner. -So, what do you say? -Okay. But not tomorrow night. I don't do Valentine's Day first dates. -I think it's a jinx. -Okay. But next week. When we don't have Hallmark breathing down our necks... -...we'll go on a date. Cool? -Cool. Okay. So let's go over this again. I'll do the introduction. -Seth, you do the character arcs-- -Zach. You just need to relax a little bit, man. I promise, you have this. You know, my teeth are all plaquey. I'm gonna go do a last-minute floss. God. She is so OCD, man. Backpacking with her is gonna be a nightmare. -You guys are going backpacking? -Yeah. My sister's getting married in Tuscany. Summer's gonna be my date. -Tuscany? Like ltaly? -Yeah. My family's renting a villa. We're staying for the wedding, then we're off on our own. Backpack through Cinque Terre, maybe a weekend in Venice. Wow, that doesn't sound romantic at all. Hey. Are you guys here to pitch to Mr. Bernstein? -Yes. -He can't see you until tomorrow. -He got delayed coming from Japan. -What? They'll get you rooms in town, and I'll reschedule you for first thing tomorrow. -Wildstorm. -Another night to work on the pitch. Yeah. So just Cinque Terre and Venice? Or maybe Florence too, or something? -You are dreading this, aren't you? -Pretty much. -I'm sorry. Can you blame me? -Look, it's like the dentist. Think of how much better you'll feel when it's over. Go on. I'll wait here. -Hey, Mr. Nichol. I came by to say hello. -Call me Caleb. -So you play pool. -No, my first time. Okay, I came by to apologize. I'm sorry if I had anything to do with your heart attack. Thank you, Ryan. I realize it wasn't easy for you to string so many words together. -Excuse me? -I'm noting how rarely I hear you talk. -I don't have much to say to you. -How about thank you? For the fine education, the roof over your head. -Everything else I've done. -Like insulting me? -Treating me like a criminal? -You are a criminal. My do-gooder son-in-law dragged you out of jail... ...and installed you in his pool house. Remember? You know, Mr. Nichol, I don't know why I try to talk to you. It's just a waste of time. -So? How did it go? -There's always next Valentine's Day. One bed, huh? Looks like Zach and l are getting cozy tonight. -We got adjoining rooms. You're in here. -We do? -Really? -Yeah. Oh, well, okay. Just one second, though. If I'm in here, now that means that.... Then what? You guys would be in here? Yeah. Is that okay? Well, sure. Yeah. I mean, well, it makes sense. Yeah, that's fine. That's great. It's actually perfect. So then.... Well, I take it you two will be in here-- In there, actually. Together. And I will be just on the other side of this soundproof wall. -Hey. You okay? -Yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm just having an allergic reaction to the universe. So. Okay. Here you go. I got you coffee. Oh, thanks, Sandy, but I've given up on that stuff. -I never thought I'd see the day. -Oh, yeah. You used to average a pot an hour, as I recall. Yeah. That's probably why I never slept. That and you keeping me up all hours... -...with your right-wing conspiracies. -Who else was gonna listen to me? See, I assumed that you were prepping me for father-in-law duty... ...and then everything changed. -I feel like I'm jumping ship here, Max. -No, no. You're not. I mean, your conscience, Sanford, well, it's always worked in overdrive. Leaving you and Rebecca just when we found her. The rest will work itself out. -lf you're off coffee, what do you drink? -Green tea. Supposedly it's a detoxifier. And, who knows, maybe if I started it earlier... ...I would've held up better. I'll get you some. There's a café down the pier. I'll be back in a sec. Okay, thanks, Sandy. You know, we should turn in early. We've got the pitch at the crack of dawn. Why don't we watch another movie? I think Van Helsing is on pay-per-view. I like monsters. Don't know about you. -I'm pretty tired. -Me too. Why don't we go to the gift shop and get some cards... ...because then we could play gin or I could do some sleight of hand. Cohen. Go to bed. Yes, okay. But listen, I'm gonna be in here if you guys need me. For anything. Okay. Okay. Maybe we should invent a secret knock just in case, for whatever. Good night, Cohen. That's the knock we'll use. Hey, Max. They didn't have any green tea, but I got you some jasmine. You drink jasmine? Hey, Max? No way there's three shots of espresso in that. You look kind of spent, Seth. -Did you sleep at all? -Yep. Got a solid 1 5 minutes. They say that's all you need. What about you? Didn't sleep too well, huh? -I slept fine, actually. -Hi, guys. Larry Bernstein. Come on in. Okay. All right. He's ready. Showtime. Come on. Well, guys. I read the treatment. And I think it's interesting. Good. Great to hear it. And on behalf of all of us-- The three of us, sitting three across in your office. Thank you. -And we like your jacket. -You're welcome. And thank you. But putting pretty people by the beach isn't enough for me. Even with powers. -Talk about characters. -Great. What can I tell you? We got Kid Chino, with his fists of fury. He's from the wrong side of the tracks. Think Karate Kid, take away the karate. Let that marinate. Then we've got Cosmo Girl. She's got a passion for fashion and a magic flask. What I wanna do right now is take you to the hot center of our comic, okay? The core relationship of what I think we're doing here. What I'm talking about here is passion. But real passion. Not the kind of passion you buy for $1.99 at the store. -What does that even mean? -I have no idea. -So you're saying there's a love story? -Y eah. -No. -Oh, no, no. No, definitely not. Maybe you can't see it. Maybe you can't. But let me tell you something. I promise you. It's there. Among the demon water-polo players from the toxic Pacific... ...that attack Atomic County. It's a love story for our time. For all time. -Between who? -Yeah, Cohen. Between who? Why between the lronist and Little Ms. Vixen. What? The lronist and Little Ms. Vixen? The lronist. Whose quick quips and pop-culture-laden bromides... ...can fell even the most insidious of villains. And Little Ms. Vixen. So cute and sweet in her black leather. Her Amex card can decapitate a demon up to 1 00 yards away. Especially when she senses her true love, the lronist, is in danger. -Well, this is an interesting approach. -Yes, but not one we've discussed. -No, there is no love story. -Y eah, not yet there isn't, okay? Stop. Here's the thing. The thing is this. If the lronist and Little Ms. Vixen could put their differences aside... ...for just one issue and stop their bickering and stop their bantering... ...even though the readers might find it adorable... ...I feel like they would realize how much more evil they could vanquish together. No, Cohen. They can't. Look, we're really sorry, sir. This is not the comic that we wanted to pitch to you. Y es. Well, it has some promise. But you three are clearly not ready... -...to forge a partnership. -Clearly. So get back to me. After high school. The coroner said he guessed it was a stroke. He didn't suffer. -I can be grateful for that. -I'm so sorry. -Yeah, I know. -And Rebecca? Well, she's doing her best. And I'm sorry I didn't call till late. -And stayed out till this morning. -I understand. -I still wanna go out tonight. -Sandy, it's just Valentine's Day. -We can celebrate another time. -I think we need this, you know? I'm not used to things being so... ...Iike they are right now, you know? I don't like it. Me neither. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go take a power nap. And when I wake up... ...I wanna see you dolled up in your Valentine's finest. Hey. Well, I thought we agreed we weren't doing the Valentine's thing. I know. Just give me one more chance with him. It'll only take a few hours. Oh, great. You're back. Can I talk to you for a second? In your study. Look, I'd say we need to talk, but clearly that doesn't work for us. Well, what do you wanna do, take a swing at me? I'm the only person in town you haven't punched. I'll make you a bet. We play pool. If you win, I stay out of your way. I win, you accept me as Lindsay's boyfriend. What is this, The Color of Money? -It's absurd. -You got a better idea? -Fine. Best of seven. -Rack them. Thank you. Well, what would you like to talk about? Clothes? School? Cut to the chase. Tell me what this is about. It's not about anything. I'm happy to be here with you. With your father gone and Kaitlin in boarding school... ...we're what's left of the family. It makes sense to lean on each other. You act like you're all alone. I mean, you have Caleb. You know, I think you're old enough that I can be honest with you about this. I worry about Caleb and me. That we might not make it. Come on, Mom. If you two can't make it, no one can. The point is, whatever happens between Caleb and me, I'll survive. What I could never handle is losing you. Well, thanks. I almost believe you. Oh, honey. You and me, we need to play our cards right. -What do you mean, our cards? -Spending our time with Caleb wisely. I've launched the magazine. It's a good start. But I'd like to control more of the company just in case. If we can play happy family a few more months... -...I can figure out my next move. -Oh, my God, Mom. You're unbelievable. What? Do you want your inheritance going to Lindsay? Because that is where this is headed... ...unless you put in some serious face time with your stepfather. That's an interesting idea, Mom. I'll think about it. Now, why don't you tell me about your trip? Okay, Cohen. You wanna explain that meltdown before? Look... ...if there's something you wanna say to me, now's your chance. You know, I just think I'm gonna lay off the caffeine forever. -Fine. Don't say I didn't ask. -You ready to hit the road? Yeah, you know, actually, I think I'm just gonna take the bus. -The bus? -Fine with me. You know, actually, if we're not gonna take Cohen home, we could stay here. We have the room, and it's Valentine's Day. Yeah, and since you guys are going to ltaly... ...you should start getting used to the hotel life. Okay. Headed to the bus depot. Happy Valentine's Day. -Hello? -Oh, I expected to get your voicemail. -I thought you'd be with your wife. -We got a late reservation. -We're just on our way out. -Oh, I won't keep you. I.... I just.... I didn't wanna disappear without saying goodbye. -What are you talking about? -I'm leaving. Don't try to talk me out of it. Let's be realistic. -My chances of getting off are slim. -Well, isn't it worth trying? Not if I don't have my father. -So when are you leaving? -Tonight. I guess there's no chance of you swinging over here... -...to say goodbye in person. -Oh, I don't think so. -Let me get back to you. -Okay. -Rebecca? -Yeah. She's.... She's leaving tonight. Going back to God knows where. -She wants to say goodbye. -Yeah. Well, if you wanna go, I'm not gonna try and stop you. I'll be right back. I think we've actually salvaged Valentine's Day. Even though Cohen did his best to destroy it. I don't think he's ever gonna get over you. I've kind of accepted it. Look, Zach, those are his issues, not mine. Good. Because all I really care about is that you and I are okay. Look at us. We're in a hotel room by ourselves on Valentine's Day. -I think we're okay. -Good. I mean, we weren't even supposed to be here. It's just like fate handed us this dream date. So... ...why don't we just make the most of it? Summer, before we do anything, I need to tell you something. Who is it? It doesn't matter. Hey, it's Summer. Obviously. You should know that, since you called me. I guess I can 't get to the phone... ... or I am screening because you creep me out. Leave a message. Your shot. -You don' t seem worried. -Should I be? -You' re about to lose. -I don't think so. You' re a hothead, Ryan. Pool takes a steady hand. Well, I've got a steady hand. Then why are you always in trouble? Setting fires, impregnating teenage girls. I know what you're trying to do. It's not gonna work. Come on, Ryan. It's all very chivalrous. Challenging me to a duel for Lindsay's affections. But you know, ultimately, she's gonna side with me. -I'm her father. -Who abandoned her for 1 6 years. That's all in the past. I don't think Lindsay sees it that way. Corner. Well, this may be the way you settle things where you come from. A game of pool, maybe a bar stool over someone's head. But in real life, it takes more than that. Hey. Sorry. We're done. God, I was starting to worry about you guys. -Well, enjoy your date. It's on me. -Thanks. So, what do you wanna do? Maybe go to Balboa lsland? -Milk shakes and bumper cars? -Why don't you stay here tonight? -Are you sure? It's Valentine's Day. -Yeah, well, tomorrow night. -Okay. -Have fun. Rent a movie or something. I hear The Color of Money is pretty good. Good evening, The Arches. Can I help you? Hi, it's Kirsten Cohen. I'd like to cancel a reservation. And what time was your reservation? So you bailed on your wife on Valentine's Day. That doesn't seem like a Sandy Cohen move. It isn't. I wanted to say goodbye to you. But now I gotta go. I think we've already missed dinner. So stay here. I've been without you for 20 years. And still... ...I'm gonna miss you. All over again. Sandy... ...I wish it had never happened. I wish I could take it all back. That night, I wish I'd never run. Me too. I gotta go. But you should stay. Hey. Sorry I called you away from your hot date. I'm just sorry to hear your Valentine's Day went so terrible. Terrible? No, no. Try catastrophic. I blew the comic book... ...and I just completely humiliated myself in front of Summer. After the way I acted, I don't think I'd get back together with me. Probably for the best. -I mean, with Zach and all. -You know, the truth is he deserves her. And, clearly, he's got the universe on his side, so.... Hey. I didn't know you were coming by. Neither did l. I guess I'm just sort of here. -Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think I'm okay. I just had a terrible dinner with my mom. -Did my technique work? -Guess so. But also it was knowing I could come here and see you. Not that I wanna put any pressure on you or anything. It's just, that's how I feel. And I had to say it. -Are you in the mood for the beach? -Now? -Yeah. It's almost time. -Time for what? For the tide to change. It's a ritual I have... ...for whenever something really major is about to change in my life. I thought you said no dating on Valentine's Day. Screw it. Come on. I'm a huge fan of spontaneous first dates. I am too. No, look, I'm not saying it's not bad. Hanging out with my grandpa ranks very low on the Valentine's scale. I just, you know, I think mine's worse. I win. You're right. Yours is worse. Look at all these people. These normal, non-traumatized people. In relationships. In love. You think we'll ever have that?
