No. So when does the plane land in Providence? Half an hour?Well, okay, but I need to talk to her now. Do you think you could maybe connect me to the pilot? I'm... (softly):Damn it. JULIE:It took the investigator six months to find Volchok. Ryan, this may be the only chance we get. He's not going to get away. I'll call you later. www.1000fr.com present Capture:FRM@ID Sync:FRM@Uranus Ryan, hey, you're up bright and early. I'm late. Really? Late where? It's 6:00 in the morning. You got a paper route or something? The gym. Oh. Could you drop me off at the store? There's a new Supergirl maquette coming in and I want to be there before Philip and Leon get their greasy paws on it. Yeah, the gym's the other way, I'm sorry. I heard you on the phone. You were spying on me? I wasn't spying on you. I was calling Summer to find out why she left. What are you doing? It's none of your business. Listen, if you know where Volchok is, let's just call the police. No, I'm not calling the police. I can't let you go. It's not really your choice. So what? Then, you're just going to find Volchok and either kill him or get yourself killed? That's insane. This conversation is over. What are you... what are you doing? I'm coming with you. It's not like you're leaving me any choice. I'm going to tell the cops. I just need to see him first. No offense, but, like, nobody believes that. If I tell Sandy or the cops, they'll make me stay away. I need to be there when they arrest him. The only way for me to do that is if I'm there first. Okay, take me with you. No. I won't get in the way. You know how stealth I can be. Why not? If that's really all you're going to do. Okay. You have to do everything I say. All right, you're the boss. So where we going? Mexico. Perfect, I need Chiclets. (piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody) California, here we come Right back where we started from California... California... here we come.. They call this a place of higher learning. I'll tell you what I'm learning. I'm learning to think for myself. I'm learning that what they call their property... No, it's our world. Summer! Hey! Hey. It's so good to see you. Where have you been? Oh, um, I had to go home. It was kind of an emergency, but everything's okay now. It was just hard being there. What an amazing spirit you have. I'll bet you, in a past life, you were an eagle, soaring through mountain passes. Do you ever have dreams of flying? No, not really. What's going on? Oh, right, the present, yes. 19:00 hours last night, the board of trustees-- talk about an oxymoron-- voted to cut down this majestic tree. What? They can't do that. Exactly. I mean, this tree was, was an acorn in the primordial miasma of America. It saw the rise of this country, Summer, and in my opinion, its fall. Now they want to cut it down so some hung over sophomore can get to Poli-Sci ten seconds faster. So what's the plan? The plan is to open people's minds. The plan is to reject their dollar-driven notions of progress. Che, what's the actual plan? Oh, yeah, uh, the actual plan. We've got a petition and a 24-hour tree-sit set to go, so if that doesn't work, revolution. Okay, well, why don't we just start with the tree-sit? I am so glad you're back. So is Mother Earth. Mm. She loves you very much. I love her. Good. Okay. Summer's with us! Huh? Huh? MACHINE VOICE:You have no new messages. WOMAN:Oh, uh, Seth left you a message last night, but I accidentally erased it. Hey. Taylor? What are you doing in my bed? Do you want to get in? We could snuggle. No. Um, what are you doing here and why are you listening to my messages, Taylor? I don't suppose you have an espresso maker. What are you wearing? What? I always sleep in this. Okay, just put this on... immediately. Okay, now,will you tell me what's going on? First, you're in Newport when you're supposed to be in France. Then, your mom shows up and you run away and-- How did you get here before me? Do you have a secret twin? Because that would explain so much. Okay, okay, sit down. I'm going to explain everything to you. So, um... Something... happened in France. Just something... huge. And, uh, I came back to tell my mom about it, and then, I just got really scared and, uh, I was completely lost, Summer.?? But then I realized that you... were the one person who would understand. Summer, I... Oh, my God. When was the last time you shaved your legs? It's like a forest, and-- (gasps): Oh, my God, your toenails. Okay, yeah, I don't do that stuff anymore. Obviously. You've got hobbit feet. CHE:Summer? Enrique just saw two guys with chainsaws. This thing is going down right now. Okay, um,... Taylor, I'm sorry; my dining card is on the desk. We will talk about this later, I promise, okay? Okay. WOMAN:Six absentees, 13 tardies? Mr. Street said she fell asleep twice in Latin. Well, you can't blame her for that. I'm getting no reception. How many bars do you have? She has a whole slew of missed assignments, and during bio lab, Mr. Castle got the strong sense Kaitlin was flirting with him. Is he the really short one? I'm, I'm sure she just thought he was a student. Mrs. Cooper,you're in the office of the dean of discipline. This doesn't happen because of misunderstandings. Right, well, Dean Torres, Kaitlin tests in the top three percent of her class. She's a natural leader. Surely, this is just... All the more reason she shouldn't waste her potential. Tell me, how are things at home? Good. Things are good. I don't know what to say. Yes, things have been difficult, but we're doing our best. Neil works a lot. He actually just left this morning for a conference in Seattle. But he and Kaitlin are good friends and, and things are good. And you and Kaitlin? Talk about school, her life? I'm sorry, look, Kaitlin is 15 years old. If I don't find voodoo dolls of myself in her bedroom, I'm happy. Harbor's running a clothing drive for the refugees in Darfur. That's a great idea; I'll make sure she's there. Julie... On a different note, do you know if cell phones work in Mexico? I'd like you and Kaitlin to do the clothing drive together. Excuse me? Huh. That's exactly what I said. And there was nothing else? Nothing. Angry? Nudfo? Chocolate love? Nude fo... Nudfo? Is that a word? Not that I know of. When did you find this? Just now, when I went to see if the boys had anything to give to the clothing drive. You tried calling them? No answer. You know what I think this is? A coded message? Nothing. It's probably the name of a band. Seth wrote it ona piece of paper and put it in his pocket. Relax, sweetheart. Hello Dad, it's me. Did you get my note? I had to write it in code in case Ryan found it. Right, the note. Yeah, he says he's not going to do anything to Volchok. Wait, wait, what? I thought you got the note. No, no, no. I got the "Angry Nudfo Chocolate Love" note. I didn't get the one about Ryan following Volchok. What? It's an anagram. Oh, yeah? Well, since when is there a G in Ryan? I was in a rush; I had to add a few letters so it made sense. Well, you certainly succeeded'cause this thing is about as clear as mud. "Ryan found Volchok." Of course. Where are you? Okay, don't freak out. Please say Newport. We're in Mexico. He didn't say Newport, did he? We're at a gas station outside Ensenada, but Ryan promises he just wants to see Volchok. I want you guys back here right now. No offense, Dad, but that may be a tad unrealistic. Let me talk to Ryan. Yeah, I got to go; I'll call you later. Seth! Hey, I was just leaving Summer a message. You ready to, uh, *ndale? What did you tell Sandy? Uh... Ah. Did you tell him about Volchok? Yeah, I did, and honestly, I'm glad because you're starting to freak me out. I know you want to kill him. Yeah, I do... but I'm not going to, all right? You either trust me on that or you don't. All right, I trust you. All right, let's go to Ensenada and find him. But I can't keep watching you to make sure you're not calling your dad. It's going to be kind of hard now. Ow, you cut me. So stop moving. You guys are gayer than your dad. It's for water polo, coach's orders. That doesn't make it any less gay. Yeah, well, our brother slept with your mom. Yeah. Nice try. Big gay dad trumps slutty mom. No, it doesn't. Yeah, ask anybody. Gay dad always trumps slutty mom. Dude, come on,it's burning. It's all right. Hey, did you talk to your mom about, uh, Dr. Roberts and his ex-wife? No. He's at a conference in Seattle, and I'm sure totally alone. Here you are. You are so... What are they doing? Their dad's gay. BOTH:Hey, Miss Cooper. I just thought you'd like to know that I just got called in to Dean Torres' office, and because of you, I have to work the clothing drive. No way. That's too funny. I'm glad you think so. I'll see you there at 6:00. What?! 6:00 o'clock. No arguments. Stop hitting on Mr. Castle. You're giving away Ryan's leather jacket? He's not going to be happy. Well, he told me I could. Wait a minute, this one's mine. I love wearing this jacket. That's the problem. They didn't call. I just... I feel so... Honey, Seth is going to call back, and then we'll get some real information, and then we can do something. I'm going to take this over to Harbor. Will you call me if anything... Of course. Do you want your jacket back? No... but thanks. Can I give you a hand? No... but thanks. SETH:Oh. So this is what 15 bucks buys you in Ensenada. Well, it's only for a couple hours. (sighs):And we're here because? Well, I only know the bar he works at. But he only works nights, and, uh, I don't want him seeing us walking around during the day. Fair enough. I'm going to use the restroom. I did not want to go numero dos in the gas station. It's all yours. Wow, the decorator clearly spent all her time in here. Whoa, man, you got to come see this spider. It's uh... Ryan, could you bring a magazine or a chair, Ryan? Ryan? Oh. Hey, this ain't the bathroom, man. You need something? Does a guy named Volchok work here? Used to. Fired his ass. Yeah? You know where I can find him? Yeah, man, let me check my Rolodex. Hell, no. Anybody else know? Hey, this guy's looking for Volchok. You know where he's at? The guy's gone. Maybe you should be, too. That's like a hint, bro. Oh, hi. I'm Taylor. I'm one of Summer's friends from Newport. Amber, Summer's roommate. Oh, we must have missed each other last night. Yeah, I didn't make it home. Got ya. College. Very cool. So, uh, Summer's really gotten into this whole green planet thing, huh? Still, you'd think she would have at least one picture of her friends, right? I mean, look at your nice collage. Who are all those guys? That's my boyfriend. He goes to Penn. The others are just guys. Guys like...? Oh. You think I'm a slut, don't you? No. No, of course not. Sure you do. It's not your fault, it's society. A guy can sleep with as many girls as he wants. A girl does it, she's a slut. There's three guys in that picture. AMBER:Oh, relax. I put this up for my social taboo class to see how people would respond. I didn't sleep with them all. Well, that's a relief. Most are just oral sex. Well, that's a very nice collage. And it only highlights how impersonal Summer's side of the room is. She doesn't even have a single picture of her boyfriend. Summer has a boyfriend? You mean Che? Who's Che? Well, excuse me. I-I was... I was, um... USMC! ALL:USMC! Excuse me, I don't want to... I don't want to bother you. I was just wondering... What? Stop stuttering. Okay, uh, a friend of mine's in trouble, and I can't leave without him, so I... Did you hear what he said? Uh, you know what? You guys are busy, so... Never leave a man behind! ALL:Never leave a man behind! Never! Man. I love you, man. Yeah. We love you. I love this guy! We're doing shots! ALL:Shots!Time! I got to find my buddy, so why don't you guys do shots? First we do shots. Then we find your friend. I mean, we're brothers, right? Oh, well, that's a little fast, but... And then we get tattoos! ALL:Tattoos! Great. This is great. This is... Aah! KAITLIN:Mom, I mean it. I really have to go study. Please, honey. At least come up with an excuse I believe. This is nice. So why don't you try it on? Because it's not a sample sale, Kaitlin, it's for the refugees. The very lucky refugees. Tell me about it. KIRSTEN:Oh, hi, Julie. I didn't know you were doing this. Hey, Kirsten. Well, you know, got to stay involved. But look at you. I mean, your kids don't even go here anymore. Right. Something wrong? The boys went to Mexico without asking us. I'm sure they're fine, but... Wait. Seth went, too? Why...? I mean, he just doesn't seem like Mr. Donkey show. Not that they're at a donkey show, or-or even know what-what a donkey show... Have you seen how great some of these clothes are? Excuse me. What's a donkey show? That's a question for your mother. Hello? He wasn't there. What? He got fired. Nobody knows where he is. But he was supposed to be there. He has to be there. Uh, I'll keep looking.I'll call you if I find anything. I hope everything's okay. Maybe it was just Dr. Roberts. He could have some bad news or something. Move it, hippies. CHE:And in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, they don't even have a gross national product. They measure gross national happiness. Isn't that just beautiful? Taylor, hey. Uh, you can have my bed tonight, 'cause I'm going to spend the night out here. Uh-huh. I need to talk to you. Wait. Taylor, hold. Can't your secret wait? This isn't about that, Summer. What is going on with you and that Che character? That Che character? What are you talking about? I have eyes, Summer, and ears, and I don't like what I'm hearing, or what I'm seeing. Okay, maybe that makes sense in French, but not so much in English. Have you called Seth back? (scoffs):You haven't, have you? Summer, uh, my chains are coming loose. I'll call him later, okay? I'm busy. You need to talk to him now. Look, they're going to cut down this tree, Taylor! Well, then we'll have a fire. Talk to him. Unless you're afraid that Johnny Appleseed might overhear. Hello? Seth? It's some Mexican guy. Happy? What? Seth? ?? ?? ALL (chanting):USMC! USMC! USMC! USMC! You drink now, pansy! Oh, this is good. Double Bob. You're staying with us, pal. You ain't going anywhere. Mmm. One more shot. One more shot. You're about to do that shot, or there's going to be about six marines kicking your ass. MEN (chanting):USMC! USMC! Wait. Maybe just one more shot. SANDY:We're doing the right thing in trusting them. I know. They're adults. We couldn't have stopped them if we tried. I know. I'm going to Mexico. I'm going with you. Uh, excuse me. What do you want? Nothing, actually. 18 tequilas is my limit. I'm looking for my friend Ryan. Uh, he's-he's about... He's about... He's in there somewhere, and he's... and he's looking for a guy named Volchok. He kind of killed his girlfriend. Leave. I've got a tattoo, pal. A tattoo! Now! Okay. Hey. Your friend was here earlier. You know where he went? Because that guy in there was, like, very unhelpful. Is that true? That Volchok killed a girl? Yes. I know where he is. So now what? Ryan's not answering his phone, and we keep getting that Mexican guy every time you call Seth. Well, at least we know our phones work here. So they can reach us. I say we just start pounding the pavement, or the-the dirt,as the case may be. Were we crazy coming here? Driving all night into a foreign country where neither of us speak the language and where we only have a vague notion of-of where they are? Yeah, that's a little crazy. How much longer do we keep doing this? Rescuing them every time they're in trouble. Oh, I don't know. But for now, I think that's our job. I want you to know that I took two semesters of Spanish. Well, then you can be our tour guide. Hi. Hi. Um, do you, uh... I'm so thirsty. Did you see my friend come in last night by any chance? I'm in the room without windows. Well, how many rooms do you have without windows? I see. Um, could I place a call to America, please? (speaking Spanish):Lo se, Miguel, pero alomejor Maria solo esta pasando por una etapa. Si. Uh, me-me tengo que ir. Who are you talking to? Oh, Miguel. The guy with Seth's phone. He is having problems with his girlfriend. Taylor... Where you going? Back to Newport. I realized that my problems are not going to be solved here. Because the truth is, you need help far more than I do. Hmm. God, have you ever tried sleeping outside? There is so much grass and you can't turn off the stars. Look, you want to be the next Julia Butterfly Hill, I support that. But to push away Seth for some guy who read Siddhartha and did a couple of outward bound courses. Are you talking about Che? Che is just my friend and that is all. This is not a love triangle. I don't do love triangles anymore. Fine, but you're using him and all of this save the Earth stuff to hide from Seth. I'm not hiding from Seth. Really? Well, how often do you call him? Once a week? Once a month? Summer, just talk to me. Or better yet, talk to Seth. Write him a letter. But you have to tell him what you're going through. He'll understand. I think you spent too much time in France, because here in America, we hide our feelings. And since when did saving the Earth become such a bad thing? I never said that. No, but you came here with this big secret, but you've spent the whole time telling me what's wrong with my life! And you're the one that's avoiding, avoider! Be that way. But you're going to lose Seth. And then you'll wish you listened to me. And I was going to tell you how I went to France, got married, and now I have to get a divorce from my French husband, and you would have found the story très intéressant. Au revoir, Summer. Hey, where did this stupid espresso machine come from anyway? It's a gift! Hey. I couldn't find your toothbrush. Uh, just don't leave. So did you kill him? I mean, that was the plan, right? The real plan. Not the lie you told me when you said trust me, man? You-you don't understand. The guy killed Marissa, you loved her. What don't I understand? No one made you come. You think I want to be here? Summer came back for the first time in months, left without saying good-bye. I could be losing her right now. All right, go home. That is not the point. I didn't find him. Good, great, then let's both go home together. And I'm not leaving until I find him. So then, what are you going to do, you going to stay here forever? You going to live in Ensenada? You going to open a piñataria? Huh? You going to open a burrito stand? (sighs):You know what, fine, if I tell you where he is, you promise not to kill him? What? I went to the bar last night-- I guess one you'd already been to-- and apparently the waitress and Volchok had had a thing... Where is he? Do you promise not to do anything? I'm gonna ask you one more time-- where is he? Drop the watermelon, dirtbag! I will shoot you! What are you watching? TV's Dumbest Cops. Are people in America really this fat? You haven't moved in 18 hours. Is everything okay? Fine. The world is an amoral toilet bowl, and one day we'll all be flushed. Okay, wow. That was a really uplifting message for your daughter. It's better you know now. Okay. I'm just gonna go to the clothing drive. Why? Because, believe it or not, I actually want a life. Right now that means school and a stupid clothing drive. So I suck it up. You know, some of us are still alive. I need to talk to you. Now, this is a surprise. You alone? Yeah. How'd you find me? The girl you... worked with, the waitress at the bar. Right. Yeah, her boyfriend wants to kill me. Well, he's gonna have to get in line-- Ryan's in Ensenada. You didn't tell him where I was? I thought about it, but in the end I gave him the wrong address. Why you looking out for me? I'm not. I just don't want Ryan to ruin his life by murdering you. I'm touched. So, you just taking off? Isn't that why you're here? Warn me to get out of town? He's gonna find you again. Maybe. So, what, then... you keep running, he keeps chasing you, best-case scenario, you do that for the rest of your lives? Till I get tired of running, yeah. You should turn yourself in. (chuckles):There's an idea. My dad's a lawyer-- he could help you get a good deal. It'd still be prison. He could make sure you're in a safe place. You know, this reunion has been great, it really has. But... I got to go. You can't keep running from this. Let's see if your boy can find me again. I'm not talking about Ryan. You should let my dad help you. You didn't mean to kill her. I know. But she's dead. That's all that matters. Seth set me up, didn't he? He called; he was worried. Come on, let's go home. Why? So we can pretend like everything's the way it used to be? We all miss her. It's never gonna be the way that it used to be. But we are still a family. You don't understand. He's here. SETH:No. He's gone. Taylor? Don't worry, Summer, I'm leaving. I was just postponing the trauma of going though security. Look, I'm... I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, I am, too. Oh, I don't want to fight with you. Even if you are all gross and smelly. And you can show up on my doorstep anytime. And how you live your life is your business. No, you were right. You are in love with Che? No. No, about the Seth thing. I have been pulling away. It's just... Summer, I understand. But Seth will, too. Just try. So when you said that, uh, you got married, did that mean that, um... Yeah, um, I am now Madame Taylor Townsend DeMemorol. Oh, my God. But how? I keep asking myself the same question. I-I met him, and the next thing I knew, we were in his family's chapel in Burgundy saying... I remember telling Ethan Hawke at the rehearsal dinner... Ethan Hawke was at your rehearsal dinner? Oh, yes. Henri Michel translated one of his novels into French as a joke, of course, but don't tell Ethan that. Um, I got to go. But Taylor, you got married. It was Paris. It seemed like the thing to do. Okay, promise me you'll write to Seth? Okay, see you at Thanksgiving. Bye. Oh, by the way, your roommate is a big slut. Yeah, I know. Okay. Will you guys hurry up? Check out these awesome leather jackets we found. Your dad would be extremely proud. Now can we go? JULIE:Kaitlin? Mom. What are you doing here? Well, uh, what you said earlier struck a nerve. Life might be difficult, but it's our job to make the best of it. You inspired me. So, what are you doing? How can I help? Um, well, the school promised a local shelter some clothes, so we're just bringing them over But I think we have it handled. Yeah, we got it. Thanks, Miss Cooper. Oh, okay. Julie, I'm glad you're here. Can I talk to you for a second? Mm-hmm. Okay. I don't know how to say this, but this afternoon Amy Bennett found two tops she donated at a used clothing boutique. Amy Bennett buys used clothing? Julie, someone has been stealing clothes from the drive and selling them. But who would do...? Oh, no. Oh, crap. SUMMER: "Dear, Seth, I know you think I've changed, and I'm avoiding you..." "Dear, Seth..." "Dear, Seth, the reason I've been so distant is that..." "The truth is..."00:35:21.3: "The truth is..." Seth, I still love you. I really, really still love you. I just can't... (sighs):Oh, I just can't. Thanks for driving. I didn't get much sleep last night. Yeah, no problem. You did the right thing, Seth. You mean, betraying my best friend by ratting him out to my parents? You might have saved his life today. And sooner or later, he's going to realize that. You okay? You hungry? This was my worst nightmare, when you first came to live with us, that Seth would follow you somewhere and get hurt. I know, I shouldn't have taken him, I'm sorry. What I was going to say, all that's changed is now I have two children to worry about. Summer, hey, I am so... Glad to see me? I know. Um, I made wheat grass soup so we can stay out there all night if have to. Where you going? We have a tree to save. Whoa, Summer, slow down. But there's no time. There's no time for anything. We have to save this tree. But we did. The dean just came by. They're not going to cut the tree down. We won. I can't believe this. Oh, I get your point. What if they go back on their word? I told them we'd be watching. Like a hawk over the Serengeti, we'll be watching, so I think our friend is safe for now. So, that's it? Well, I mean, can't we just go out there anyway? Oh, I get it. Why are we only with our tree friends in times of danger? We should be with them in times of joy, too. Exactly. That's exactly what I mean. Yeah. I could learn a lot from you, Summer Roberts. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, I know. It... Some marines were helping me look for Ryan. It was a bonding thing. (laughing):Wow. It's-It's-It's... You know, the artwork is really good. What's this... What's this say beneath? Uh, Senorita Vixen. One of the marines got one, too. He thought it was pretty cool. (laughs):You know, it does have a certain... Gay vibe. Were you going to say gay vibe? Exactly. Let's see what Summer has to say. You know, the one thing I keep thinking about... ...is how Ryan could have found Volchok in the first place. Oh, please, just leave me out of it. It would have taken a private investigator, which means money. And any way I cut it, it leads back to just one person. JULIE: There'll be no more hanging out with Brad and Eric. You're to come straight home after school. Do you have any idea how lucky you arethat Dean Torres didn't expel you? Mom, this whole thing is just a crock anyway. And how is that? Do you really think that Sudanese refugees have an overwhelming need for Paul Frank tops and last season Manolo Blahniks? So, what, you think you can steal them? Look, I did research on the Web. They have mountains of donate clothing in warehouses in New Jersey. They have all they've ever needed. You just made that up. Maybe. But it sounded true, didn't it? Kaitlin... ...I can't do this. I can't... I can't keep this family together and have you running around like Miss Clockwork Orange. I... I can't. Honey, please. I need your help. Mom, do you really think that Dr. Roberts is at that conference by himself? No, of course not. Look, maybe I can make you some ice cream... if you want. That would be nice. Just hold on. Hello? Yes, of course. I'll be right there. Honey, I have to step out for a minute. Take a rain check, okay? Okay. Sandy, what is it? You said it was important. I thought you might want to know that Ryan and Seth are back home, that Volchok's disappeared. What are you talking about? Stop it. You told Ryan where to find Volchok. Even for you, this is a new low. Okay, you know what? You're crazy. I'm just going to say good night. You sent Ryan down there to commit a murder. I could have you arrested. But then you'd get Ryan arrested, and you're not going to do that, are you? If anything had happened to him or to Seth... Okay, it's late, and I'm not in the mood for threats. Sit down. After everything our families have been through, you would put our kids in danger? At least you still have all your kids. Hey. How was your drive? Quiet. Yours? We got stopped at the border. I think they had a picture of dad from his long-hair days. Did he say anything about me? Maybe a rant about Judas? Of course not. You okay? Yeah. It's just been a long couple of days.
