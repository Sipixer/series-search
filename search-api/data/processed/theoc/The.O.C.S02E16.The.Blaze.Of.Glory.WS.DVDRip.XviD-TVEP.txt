T ell me how much it's worth. I'll write you a check for $50,000 right now. I was thinking more like $500,000. -Hi, Carter. -Pleasure to meet you. -Ever been married? -I am married. You're not wearing a ring. Where's your ring? I guess I'm not the only one she lies to. I know my daughter. Marissa's only been in love once. And he looked a whole lot different in a wife-beater. -Do you miss him? -Every day. It's hard to believe, but spring is here. Yeah. This year's just flying by. Yeah. And, you know, I gotta say, this year, not as good as last. -You think? -I do. I mean, look, we all tried some new things and that was fun. Yard guys, illegitimate daughters, less fighting, more live music. Well, maybe you remember last year as better because it was all new. You think I've sentimentalized the past out of proportion? Yeah. Come on. We can't keep living in last year. Sure we can. And check this out, man. Things are going back to the way they were. I'm back with Summer, you're single again. I know where this is going. Yeah, it's going to the Harbor School Pep Rally Bonfire. Come on. You could rally a little pep, couldn't you? -Especially if you invited along.... -Don't say it. It would be so last year though. Nothing's going on with me and Marissa. So there's just no feelings there whatsoever? -You couldn't care less? -It's not about that. Besides, she's clearly already taken. Bye. I don't know. I don't see any chemistry. Maybe we should ask them to kiss, real slow-like. -Hey. -Hey. I couldn't help but notice the bonfire banner. Don't talk to me about it. It's been so stressful. I can't even find someone to design the bonfire. -You guys coming? -Don't know. A pep rally. Yeah, a bonfire pep rally. You bet we are. Okay, cool. Well, I'm gonna be late. You're going the way of lockers and classrooms. Why don't you walk her? That would be a nice gesture. -Okay. Thanks. -No problem. -Live in the now, Seth. -I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't do that. Bye. -Hi. -Hey. Oh, no, don't even think about it, Cohen. We've lived through enough of their suffering. Yeah. And it was awesome. Do not meddle with them. They're, like, combustible. Yeah, Summer, and what better place for said combustion... ...than the Harbor School Pep Rally Bonfire? -You're kind of creeping me out. -I'm okay with that. Wait, Summer. Come back. All right, nice and easy. Now, start that shoulder turn. Keep your eye on that ball. Maintain the spine angle. Come on. Turn those shoulders. Finish that turn. Feel that weight shift. Do you feel the...? All right, I'm just gonna stand here nice and quietly. But supportively. That was good. Your feet were busy. Quiet your feet down. -Come on, try it again. -No more tries. I hate golf. I suck at golf. I no longer wanna play golf. -You could only get better. -I'll have to take your word for it. Come on. We could play together. You look so cute in that visor. I do? I gotta go. We're putting together our first issue of Newport Living... ...trying to figure out what photo of Julie to use. T alk about Sophie 's Choice. Who'd you finally get to edit the Medusa Monthly? Carter Buckley. He's really great. He wants to take it beyond gossip and dish. Focus on culture, the local art scene. So it's really more of a pamphlet than a magazine. Carter Buckley. Now, what's he done before? A bunch of stuff. A magazine called The Ugly American. National Geographic, GQ. And he self-published a magazine called Revolution. -You've gotta be kidding. -You know it? That was the magazine of Berkeley's left wing. Portraits of the misunderstood, the marginalized, the crackpots. -An entire magazine about losers. -But loveable ones. I read it religiously. I'm impressed. You know, I'd love to meet him. Well, I'll set something up. -You found your wedding ring. -Yeah. Behind some cushions. Thanks for the lesson. -Hello, Marissa. -Hey, Cohen. -You seem stressed, a little distracted. -Yeah, well, it's this bonfire. It would be really great if we had, you know, a bonfire. Well, Coop, I think I got what ails you. First of all, only Summer calls me Coop. I figured, we're back together now... ...and if A equals C and B equals C then A equals B. -Know what I'm saying? -No. I really don't. So, what's your plan? Who's your social-chair savior? -Ryan. -Mr. Water Polo? I don't think so. Yeah, but think about this. That guy worked and-- No, no. He toiled in an actual construction job. Also, he enjoys architecture and burning stuff down. He did torch Caleb's model home. -I don't know. You think he'd say yes? -To you? How could he resist. Especially now that Lindsay's gone. The kid's kind of blue. It might be good for him. Distract him. And it would be fun. Yes. Yes. Although I personally don't see the appeal, yes. -All right, that's a good idea. Thanks. -Don't mention it. Seriously, don't. Especially to Summer. Hello, Mother. No, I'm not coming home, okay? Bye. Please do not-- She's such a little me. Okay, like you're not creepy enough, you're appearing in doorways now? -Trouble at home? -Like I'd open up to you. -I'm here if you need me. -I'll keep that in mind. -What do you want? -My money. Again, good to know. -How'd you get past security? -Charm and good looks. -I know you've got this magazine ready. -Get out, Lance. This is not the moment when you want your perfect reputation... ...undone by one bad decision and not so flattering lighting. You got three days to give me my money... ...or everyone in Newport's gonna see a lot more than your face. Traffic was terrible. Is Carter here yet? Mr. Buckley left a voicemail at around 3:30 a.m. Said don't expect him today. Three-thirty? Did he say why? No. But I couldn't understand everything on the message. -He was slurring. -You're kidding. Well, I guess Julie and l will proceed without him. -Oh, hey, Kiks. Can't make the meeting. -ls something up? Just a critical personal emergency. But nothing important. I guess the meeting's cancelled. I can try Mr. Buckley, see if he's changed his mind. No. I'll take care of it. So how are you and Alex? You know, really great. -Really great? Or really great? -Really great. Thanks for clearing that up for me. Tell Seth never to call me Coop again. He ruined the nickname. -Cohen called you Coop? When? -Earlier. Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting. No, actually, I was hoping I'd run into you. -Yeah? You were? -You were? I was. I need someone to build the bonfire for us... ...and I figured, who else has worked in construction-- -Has burned down a house? -Yeah. Exactly. And I thought it would be fun working together. -You did? -You did? Besides, if you don't do it then the water polo team's not gonna have a pep rally. Well, we can't have that happen. -Sure, yeah, okay. -You'll do it? -That's great. Isn't that great? -It's great! -What's great? -Ryan's gonna build the bonfire for us. Hey, great idea, you two. I love that. Making it happen on behalf of the school. Yeah. Yeah, you know, the idea is just inspired. Well, I've got a big test to study for... ...so it looks like I'll be eating in the library. So long. Oh, come on. Do you have to go? You know, will you two excuse me? So thanks again. I'll see you after school? -Yeah, sure. -Okay. My place? -Your place with Alex? -Yeah. Is that a problem? -No. -Okay. No problem at all. No, I looked in the box. This computer does not have an access key. Look, all I wanna do is check my e-mail. No! Do not transfer me. -You must have been talking to Marissa. -Julie, you scared me. -More than usual. -Always a pleasure, Sanford. Only Caleb gets to call me Sanford because he won't not. -What are you doing here? -Official business. And as a new client, I'm not impressed. If this is a marital issue, I have to decline. -Caleb's got me on retainer. -Caleb and I are just fine. And, well, I'm trying to keep it that way. Well, l.... This is the first time in my life I'm actually speechless. It was the '80s. I was young, I had no money and.... -lt was the '80s. -That explains everything. I'm not gonna give you my whole sob story. Needless to say, I never thought that it would resurface. -So where did this come from? -The auteur behind this masterpiece. His name is Lance Baldwin. He's an ex. So you started with a porn producer and you ended up with Caleb. -See, I'd consider that a lateral move. -He wants half a million. Or he goes public on the eve of Newport Living 's launch. -You've gotta go to the cops. -No. Sandy, no cops. And before you even suggest it, no Caleb. -I am so not the guy for this. -Sandy. Please. I'm begging you. Forget the company or my marriage. If Marissa ever found about this.... I mean, she's already moved out on me. She won't take my calls. She would never speak to me again. It's all right, Julie. You deal with Marissa and I'll deal with the colonel. It's a Boogie Nights reference. Expect a lot of them. -Don't worry about it. I wasn't reading. -What the hell is your problem, Cohen? You're interrupting very studious people. Like me. Okay. All right. -Now no one can hear you scream. -What is your problem, woman? You are. What did I tell you about messing with them? I was concerned the water polo team wouldn't have a pep rally... ...so I suggested it for the good of the school. -Cohen. -They belong together. -No, they don't. -Yes, they do. It's me and you, and Ryan and Marissa. That's the way it should be. Listen up, asshat. Ryan and Marissa separate, both great people that I love. T ogether, disaster. So stay away from them, all right? Or otherwise, more than the bonfire is going up in flames. I can make no promises. Hey, what's up? Nothing. I just wanted to see what you were up to. We haven't had time to hang. I know. I just have this project to work on after school with Ryan. With Ryan? -What thing? -This bonfire pep rally. You never mentioned a pep rally. Yeah, I kind of have a handle on your sense of school spirit. Yeah, good point. So I guess I'll just see you at home. -Hello? -Yeah, sorry. I'll see you later. Hello! Anyone here? Kirsten. Sorry, private party. We had a meeting! You wanna explain what happened? Oh, it was just a little thing I like to call my wedding anniversary. -You're divorced. -No wonder this party sucks. I see you found your ring. Must mean you're still married. Thanks for stopping by. Look, I'm sorry I just stopped by. But you could apologize for blowing off the meeting. Right. Yeah. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for all the future meetings I'm gonna miss. You see, now you don't have to feel bad about firing me. Maybe you're not in the best frame of mind to be having this discussion. I'm gonna be less self-loathing if I'm sober? Come on, I work for a rag about Julie Cooper-Nichol. -No, it's about culture, it's about art. -Oh, come on, Kirsten. This magazine is just a photo opportunity for 55-year-old women... ...with 25-year-old breasts. But this is a chance to turn this community upside down... ...be subversive, irreverent. I'd rather be drunk. You see, Oats. It's even the same on The Valley. Last year was just better. You and Captain Oats catching up? Yeah. Does he seem grumpy to you these days? Yeah. I know how he feels. This bonfire thing is a disaster. Oh, yeah. You and Marissa working on the bonfire together. -That's pretty cool, huh? -Not so far. I did a bunch of designs but they all suck. Yeah, well, I'm sure whatever you come up with Marissa will love you. It. -There's nothing going on. -It's none of my business. Hey, you guys cool fending for yourselves for dinner? -Sure. -Your mother's at work, and I gotta run. -But I'm leaving you money for pizza. -Thanks. -You two all right? -Yeah. Just school project. -Ryan's working with Marissa. -You and Marissa. That's nice. Just like last year. You and Mom have been working a lot. Everything all right? Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. Just busy. I feel like there's maybe been some kind of tension recently. You're married to someone for 20 years, you're bound to hit a few bumps. It takes work, but we love each other. -Good. -Okay. I'll see you. -All right. -Bye. Did you hear that, Ryan? Love takes work. -You referring to me and Marissa? -I'm staying out of that. You go work on your cool bonfire. Me and Oats are gonna order in. -Hey, can I borrow Captain Oats? -Sure. But he's a poor substitute for a broken heart. Oats, if he touches you anywhere weird... ...and by weird I mean.... I want you to neigh as loud as you can. See, you're punching people. That's very last year. It's cool though. -What? -Well, it's nice to see you too, sweetie. Hello. I haven't been vaccinated. What do you want? Well, I thought that we could talk face to face. -May I come in? -No. Don't you think you're taking this a little too far? You enjoy living in squalor? You and Caleb don't live here. Can't be that disgusting. -I could make you come home. -What, call the cops? -I'd tell them about you. -I'll take your credit cards. -I'll get a job. -You? Doing what? Or maybe I'll just steal. You know I'm really good at that. Marissa, come home. Please. Don't throw away your future just because you hate me. We've all done things in life that we regret, but it is never too late. -The door's always open. -Not this one. Alex, hey. You're in my room. Which never happened when we were dating. I hope I'm not interrupting. You trying on new clothes or something? No, actually. I'm trying on clothes from last year. Come in. Hi. What's going on? I know this is weird, but I need your advice. It's about Marissa. Okay. Well, I'm a little fuzzy on your guys' relationship... ...so perhaps you have some photos, or a video or things you-- -I was just trying to be thorough. -It's not about me and Marissa. This is about Marissa and Ryan. -I have a sense about them. -Yeah, I have a lot of Penguin to try on. So there is something going on. If you were this sensitive and neurotic when we dated, it might have worked. I really, really have fallen hard for this girl. Please, will you tell me if I'm fighting for a lost cause? Are they just one of those couples that will always be a couple? Is this about the other night at the mall? What, no? I know all about the mall, why? Okay, so big deal. They slept in a tent together. -A lot of friends would do that. -I'm sorry. Did you just say tent? Did you think I said that? No, no. What did you think? Did you think I said tent? -No, I was saying they repented. -Marissa forgot to mention that. -lt wasn't a big deal. -You've been very helpful. I wasn't even trying to meddle. I was saying.... Summer's gonna kill me. -Hey. -Hey. -Come in. -Great, thanks. Sorry about the mess. We're between maids. How do you survive? -So where's Alex? -Working. -Got it. -Just us. -Keep going. -Okay. Let's see. -Captain Oats! -Yeah. Seth let us borrow him for the bonfire. -We're not gonna burn him, are we? -No, no. He's our inspiration. We'll build a scale model so we'll know how much wood to use for the real thing. -Oh, a Trojan horse. -Exactly. So, what do you think? I think it's perfect. Yeah, it's not bad. So let's get started. How are you with popsicle sticks? Really good. -You got a warrant? -You're not suspicious, are you? I'm Sandy Cohen. I'm Julie Cooper's attorney. -And I'm a huge fan of your work. -You got my money? I'm here to negotiate. Is this gonna be a three way? Because my rate doubles. Why don't you go grab some more smokes at the store. We got business. You know the offer. Five hundred grand makes this thing go away. That's no offer. That's extortion. She's willing to pay you $50,000... ...which could finance a handful of your masterpieces. You need to add another zero. Otherwise, this thing is streaming live on the lnternet in 72 hours. -You really think anyone's gonna care? -I think Julie will. Enough to save her magazine. Her marriage. -Well, you'll be hearing from me. -It's been a pleasure. -This is gonna be great. -Glad you liked it. Yeah, and I'm glad Seth suggested you for the job. -Seth suggested me? -Yeah, why? Nothing. He's kind of stuck in the past. He thinks that now that he's back with Summer that.... You know. -Yeah. Crazy. -Totally. Yeah. Good night. Hey! You almost hit me. -I'm sorry. I'll try again. -What do you think you're doing? Let me try to put it in a way you'll understand. Stay away from her! -There's nothing going on. -What? Studying late together, sharing a sleeping bag. -Yeah, there's nothing going on at all! -Hey, listen to me. No, you listen to me. Don't go near my girlfriend again. You understand me now? Walk away. I'm gone. -I'm sorry I missed you last night. -I'm sorry I missed you too. -The all-consuming magazine. -And you were...? -Also at work. On a new case. -Another Newport calamity? No, this is one I've never seen before. I hope to never see it again. How about we log a little quality time? I'd love to, but I have to work. -With Carter Buckley? -Actually, without. It turns out that Newport Living wasn't for him. When he didn't show up for work, I went by his place... ...and I found him drowning in self-pity and tequila. Couple of weeks in Newport, his spirit's crushed. I'd never have thought that possible. He built a whole magazine... ...around people who fought the system, no matter the cost. The guy was an inspiration to me. You know that magazine of his that you loved in college? -Do you happen to have a copy? -Revolution? Yeah, I probably do. It's probably in the office or maybe the garage. Hey, man. How'd it go last night with Marissa? -Things with Marissa went great. -Good. Things with Alex, not so much. -Alex was there? -Yeah. She threw a beer can at my head. -What? -And shoved me a couple times. Yeah. -Pretty hard actually. -That is one angry lesbian. Okay, here's the thing. I may have accidentally let a little something slip about, you know.... -A tent? -No, I didn't. Yeah, okay, maybe. Yes, I did. Why is she's making such a big deal? There's something dirty about camping? And before Alex and l had our friendly chat... ...Marissa mentioned it was your idea we work together. I mentioned it, but I shouldn't hog all the credit. Stay out of it! Just because you're back with Summer-- I know. You were just a lot happier back then so.... -Well, that was then. -All right. You have one new message. Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight. But the wood's ordered, and you have the plans, so everything should be fine. Have fun. Who was that? My mom. More empty threats. You were asleep last night when I got home. Yeah. Yeah, I was really tired. You should try sleeping in a tent. With Ryan. But you already did that. Look, I'm sorry. I was going to tell you that. It's just, I didn't wanna make it a big deal. -But it wasn't, until you lied. -I didn't lie. -I just-- -Lied? No big deal. Please tell me you have some good news. Well, unfortunately, Lance is as sleazy as he looks, but not as dumb. He owns the rights to the movie in perpetuity. And you were a consenting adult, so if he wants to make money off it... ...it's his prerogative. Sandy, there's gotta be some way to stop him. We could charge him with extortion, get an injunction. -But that would involve the authorities-- -No! Even if I paid him off, there's nothing to stop him from leaking it anyway. Look, I'll figure something out. You worry about Marissa, I'll handle the rest. I can worry all I want, it doesn't seem to help. Why is the one person who knows best for their child... ...the last person that child wants to hear from? We had a similar situation with Seth last summer. All I can say is that sometimes it's not the message... ...it's the messenger. I don't know, Coop. It sounds like a pretty bad fight. -Maybe you should just move home. -I can't. Because you love Alex, and wherever she is, that's your home? Because it would make my mom too happy. What was I thinking? Well, if you can't go to the bonfire with Ryan... ...then go home to Alex. You can't ride two horses with one ass. It's a proverb. Okay, well, Ryan's not going to the bonfire. Why? I thought it was like his idea. He didn't say, but I know it's because of Alex. I'm confused. I thought Alex wasn't going. She's not. But Ryan and I were working late at the apartment the other night... ...and somehow she found out about the mall and the tent. -Well, I hadn't exactly told her about it. -lf you didn't tell her then who did? I am going to kick his ass back to last year! Hello. Summer? Whose ass? Not now, Seth. I'm busy. Hi. Sorry to interrupt you doing whatever it is you were doing. Brooding, is it? Yeah. Right now I'm in the middle of a major session, so if you could.... -What's going on? -Well, actually... ...I'm glad I caught you before you go to the bonfire. -I'm not going to the bonfire. -But you have to. -You and Seth on the same team now? -No, I'm on my own mission. I need help. With Marissa. For whatever reason that I don't quite understand... ...she listens to you. -She needs help. -Maybe she's happy where she is. Do you think that Marissa knows what she wants? She is in so far over her head with this relationship. She's skipping school, staying out all hours... ...risking everything important to her to prove a point. Okay. So, what do you want me to do about it? I know that she wants to come home. If she does it for me, she's letting me win. But if she does it for you-- No, I'm not getting into the middle of Marissa's life. Not again. -Especially her relationship with Alex. -This is not about Alex. It's about Marissa and her future. Which we can both see is slipping away from her. Ryan, please. Help me. Convince her to come home. You know that's what's for the best. -What the hell are you doing here? -Looking for Marissa. This is you staying away? I'm here because of her mom. -You and Julie Cooper a team now? -Yeah. Where is she? She's at her little bonfire. -All right. -No, no. You remember what I told you last night. You stay away from her. -Or what? -You wanna find out? -Sure. -You go down there, it's on. Great. You know, this sort of thing used to be my specialty. Oh, a little word of advice. You gotta work this hard, it's not working. Is this board for the hind legs or the front? It's just labeled leg. -Front, I think. -Right or left? Guess. The odds are fifty-fifty. Marissa, the horse's head seems to only fit the hindquarters. What do we do? We're running out of time. I don't know, okay? I picked the font for the banner. I color-coordinated the balloons. -This is not my area of expertise. -Maybe I can help. Hey, I thought you weren't coming. Captain Oats was concerned that he be well represented. He's very self-conscious. He is Seth's horse. -So are you gonna stick it out? -Yeah. If I'm needed. Oh, yeah. Hang on. Hey, everybody! This is Ryan. He's gonna answer any and all of your questions. Okay, great. That's a good question. All right! Great. That horse is gonna have its head up its ass if we're not careful. We need to rotate the neck to the other side. You guys in back take care of that. I need you ladies right over there to hoe that area. Hoe that thing down. We need to set the tiki torches over here. Hey, you with the gasoline. Away from the fire. What are you doing, man? All right. The sun's gonna be down in an about hour. We can make this happen, okay, people! Let's go! Let's go! Well, that was a dirty trick. -Haunting me with my past. -I was trying to inspire you. You know, looking this thing over, it feels like a lifetime ago. What was I thinking making a magazine all about losers? At least they were lovable ones. Where'd you find this? A crusading idealist... ...who remembers every word of that magazine like it was yesterday. My husband. Well, I'll have to meet him. So, what do you think? You in? You say subversive and irreverent, I say Julie Cooper-Nichol. -Where does that leave us? -Pretty much lost. That's pretty much my favorite place to start. I've got an idea. Okay, it's not really my idea.... Summer. Hey, how are you? I hope you have Motrin in the house because you're about to feel pain. I wanted everyone to be happy. Well, nice going. Now everybody is miserable. You need to start apologizing, starting with Ryan. -Okay! -Go! Ryan? You around? I'm here to apologize. -He's not here. -Yeah, I know. I can see that. -Well, where is he? -You think he went to the bonfire? If so, we have a four-alarm emergency on our hands. Break out your hose. -It's a metaphor. -I know. -You got me my money? -I got this. Starting your own film company? What better star to hitch my wagon to than Julie Cooper? You're buying the film? The master, the film, and the negatives. We're gonna meet your offer. -A hundred bucks? -Consider it a good-faith deposit. I need two weeks. I sign this, I get half a mil in two weeks? That's right. So you know, if one frame of this leaks onto the lnternet-- I'm not saying that'd happen, you seem like a stand-up guy. --we're coming after you for 1 0 times the amount. It's called copyright infringement and piracy. And you could go to jail. Hello? Some good news and some not-so-good news. Good news first, always. You don't have to worry about the movie surfacing. As long as we pay him, which is the bad news. And where am I gonna get this money? You have to talk to Caleb. Hopefully, he'll understand. Yeah, sure he will. I am so screwed. I know. I saw the footage. This is going great. Not for long. Hey, what are you doing here? -Are these your friends? -Yeah. They're here to see Ryan. -You gotta be kidding me. -Why? You think this is funny? Hey, guys. Stop it. Guys, seriously, stop it, okay! Cut it out! No, not you guys. You guys are great. Go Harbor! This is between you and me. -Fine, then let's talk, you and me. -Fine. I like the wrist cuff. You wanna tell me what the hell is going on? -I just wanna talk. -You wanna talk? Tell me why you brought two skeezy ex-cons to my school bonfire. I am sorry I interrupted your bonfire! It just seems like that's all you do lately. I didn't realize moving in meant giving up my life. I didn't ask you to give up your life! All I ever wanted was to be a part of it! This is my life, okay! That's it! So, what do you think? I think... ...this is your life, and I don't fit in. Pep rallies, cheerleaders. -Boys. -Nothing happened with Ryan. Yeah, not yet. But what do you give it? A week, a month? I really wanted this to work between us. Look, I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm sorry that I brought two skeezy ex-cons to your bonfire. Actually, only one of them ever really served time but.... So, what happens now? Who knows? I think I might go back home... ...save some money, go back to school. It actually looks kind of fun. Yeah, from really far away. Come on. You're gonna miss the human pyramid. Okay. Pretty good, huh? Not into the school-spirit thing. That's cool. I'm sorry. -lt wasn't about you. -I know. That's okay. You okay? Yeah. Now all that's left is lighting the bonfire. -I don't hear any screaming. -I don't see any ambulances. -Maybe we're here just in time. -Or maybe someone was right all along. Thanks. You know what, this honor's yours. We built it together. Let's burn it together. Hey, I think Captain Oats would be very proud... ...or deeply disturbed by this visual. -You guys, it's so good. -Thanks, Seth, for making it all happen. Oh, you see that? They're thanking me.
