Get your hands off me! Are you happy? Your family requested I be here to help them lead an intervention. We are worried that you have an addiction to alcohol. I'm so sorry that I put you through this. He attacked her, Seth. But she didn't tell Ryan because... - He has to know. - I'm gonna settle this with Trey. Once and for all. Oh, my God. Stop it. You're killing him. I got a gunshot wound. Exited right clavicle, punctured an artery. - He still alive? - Not for long. How could you, man? I would've done anything for you. Look, man, I was messed up. I was stoned. - We still have questions. - I gotta see if he'll be okay. Trey, get off of him, please! He's not gonna die, right? It wasn 't my idea, Trey. I didn 't wanna steal that car. Yeah, well, I went away for it, and you got the good life. So you had to destroy it? You had to hurt her, huh? That's my brother. Is he gonna be okay? He'd be better if someone hadn't shot him. - Wait, please... - He's lost a lot of blood. Jesus, what the hell happened to you? - Nothing, I'm fine. - Can someone look at him? You can look at him just as soon as we're done talking to him. Ryan. - Did you discharge this weapon? - Yes, I already... - Don't answer him! Don't say anything! - You okay? We're losing him. You all right? Ryan? Seth? You okay? Hey, man. Just wanted you to know that... You okay? - I just had the worst nightmare. - Yeah? I've got some bad news. It wasn't a dream. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, that lawyer guy's on his way over, so... Yeah. You know, Coop... ...if you'd have asked what we'd be doing the weekend before senior year... ...I probably would have said a road trip to Rosarito... ...or rush week at SC meeting college boys. And waiting to get charged with manslaughter? Wouldn't have made the list. You're gonna get through this, Coop. You're innocent, you were saving Ryan's life. Try explaining that to Ryan. He understands why you did it. He's not mad. It's just like this weird, horrible thing hanging over us. Like the elephant in the room. Or in the Intensive Care Unit. Before Trey, I never actually knew anyone in a coma. Well, I mean, on <i>The Valley</i> there's someone in a coma every week. But I think they do that so when the person wakes up... ...another actor can play the part. Unfortunately, if Trey wakes up, he's still gonna be Trey. If he wakes up. You gotta admit, Coop, whatever happens... ...Ryan facing off with Trey to avenge your honor? God, that is so freaking hot. In a mythic, biblical, samurai, Western kind of way. I really wish that helped me sleep at night, Summer. - You're still not sleeping? - I shot someone, Sum. And even if he lives, which is a big if... ...I'm still gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. Oh, senior year. Should be all-time. Yeah. Thanks a bunch, Sandy. If a pot and a half isn't enough to get you through the morning... ...I can make more. That'd be great. Sorry for the mess, it's been a little hectic. - Seth will be right down. - And Mr. Atwood? He's getting dressed. The kids have been through a lot with this hanging over them. Now school is starting. Which is why the DA wants to get moving. We waited as long as we could for Mr. Atwood to wake up... ...but we're getting calls from parents. The DA's under pressure to prosecute. Except there's nothing to prosecute. Marissa's protected under the defense of others. Of course, your boss may not find that very sexy. Or true. DA's not looking to go after Marissa. Ryan's innocent. You got his statement at the scene and hers. Look at the record Ryan's got. His history of violence. Caleb Nichol's daughter is the one shooting ex-cons with a.45? - She saved Ryan's life. - Why was he at Trey's in the first place? His brother tried to rape his girlfriend. - We've got cause. - Yeah, and you got witnesses. The only people who saw the gun go off were Mr. Atwood, Miss Cooper... ...and the other Mr. Atwood. Who may or may not wake up. If you go after Ryan, even if he's brought in on charges... ...Social Services could take him away from us. Which explains Miss Cooper's motivation to cover for him. Mr. Atwood's got a lot more to lose. Where is your wife anyway? She's out of town. My name is Kirsten, and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Kirsten. Kirsten, your progress here at Suriak has been truly wonderful to watch. You're a model patient for everyone here. Well, I don't know about that. I mean, Shelly is definitely better at poker. She's cleaned me out. But being here... ...has given me the clarity to understand why I turned to alcohol in the first place. And do you feel comfortable sharing with the group why that was? Sure. I mean, we're all in this together. I... I guess it begins and ends with my dad. He was... ...an amazing man. But controlling. And I realized that I was living his life, not mine. After my mother died, I did everything I could to please him. But I realize that no matter how hard I worked, or how hard I tried... It was never enough. I'm sorry. No. No, it's true. It was never enough. Became my mantra. I was never a good enough wife or a mom... ...because I wasn't a good enough daughter. The power that comes with that kind of difficult realization... ...will be invaluable after you leave us. - Are you trying to get rid of me? Well, it sounds to me like Suriak's work is done. You'll need to get a sponsor, attend meetings... ...but there's no reason you can't do that from your home. Great. Mr. Atwood, do you swear to tell the truth... ...and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Well, then you won't mind if I record this deposition. Sure. Release it on iTunes. I hope it's a really big hit. Just answer the questions. I've already answered all these questions. I have nothing new to say. Well, your previous statement came at the hospital. It was traumatic. Maybe you remember things differently now. I remember everything exactly as I told you. Well, then you can tell me again. I confronted Trey about what had happened... ...and that's when he pulled the gun on me. And we called Marissa to see if maybe she could stop Ryan. And that's when Marissa saved my life. You mean, that's when Marissa shot Trey? And you witnessed the shooting? It was clear when we got there what had happened. - Just answer the question. - No, I did not. I did... - And I didn't shoot him. - Your prints were on the gun. Because I put the safety back on to make sure it didn't go off again. We... - We weren't exactly thinking at the time. - Just one final question. What were you afraid was going to happen between Ryan and his brother? Why were you trying to stop him? You went to Trey's that night to kill your brother, didn't you, Mr. Atwood? So, what kind of food do you think prosecutors like? Because that's what's important here, Jimmy? Okay. So does this look like the outfit the mother of an innocent girl would wear? Yeah, well, at least somebody has their priorities in order. I just hope Marissa listens to me and our attorney. The last thing we need is her admitting she shot someone. Jules, she already admitted it. She wasn't in her right frame of mind when she spoke to the police. - It's not like she's a trained assassin. - So... So, what's our story? - Trey shot himself in the back? - No, Jimmy, be reasonable. She's not gonna say Ryan did it. They already have her statement. Nobody believes her. They all think she's protecting him. So you want Ryan to go away for this? All I know is that before he moved to Newport... ...our lives were a lot more normal. Stable. So it's his fault that I went bankrupt and nearly went to jail... ...and you married Caleb Nichol only to watch him drown in a pool... ...and Trey got shot? - Not everything I say is meant literally. I'm venting. Look, I wish none of this ever happened, but it did. And we have a chance to be a family again. I don't wanna lose that. Look, l... Put out some crudit√©s and the Gouda. I'll go see if Marissa's out of the shower. Hey, you decent? Thought maybe you could use a post-depo dip. I just showered. A fair point. We'll stay away from aquatic activities. - Something landlocked maybe. - I'm gonna visit Trey. I was gonna go with a movie, this being the time when Hollywood dumps... ...their crappy would-be blockbusters which we could mock... ...and thus feel better about ourselves. - You got the keys? - But... ...visiting your comatose brother in the ICU? That's also an excellent way to relax and blow off steam, so I'll drive. Awesome. Oh, Mr. Caldwell, would you like some more lemonade? Mr. Esbenshade? No, thanks. Come on, it's okay for a prosecutor and defense attorney... ...to have a glass of lemonade together. We're all human beings here. I'm not so sure about these guys. Miss Cooper. I'm Deputy District Attorney Chris Caldwell. - I'll be conducting this deposition. - Hi. - Where do you want us to sit? - Miss Roberts can't be present. We wouldn't want you influencing her testimony. She knows what you know, which is the truth. Which is what I already told you people. Miss Roberts, if you could please wait inside. Summer, we have HBO On Demand. Every season of <i>Sex and the City.</i> Knock yourself out. Mariss, you'll be okay. I'm just gonna wait inside. I already told everybody everything. I don't wanna go through this again. Talk about it in front of these strangers. Marissa, I need to remind you, this deposition is binding. Your court testimony can't waiver from what is said here. I told the truth, so, what's the problem? The problem, Ms. Cooper, is that your testimony lacks credibility. Miss Roberts, please wait inside. Come on, Summer. Now, Miss Cooper, I'm going to have to swear you in. It'll be okay, Marissa. I kind of like him this way. He's a better listener. Sorry. I get talkative around coma patients. It's a compensation thing. I'll give you guys a minute. Wait, just... Sorry, man, I don't even know why I came here. I wanted to kill him. Now I'd do anything to take it back. You can't blame yourself. You can't change what happened. Yeah, but Trey could have tried to make it work. Living in town, I mean, I could have my brother here. Now everything's screwed up and he's the only family I got left. Well, that's not exactly true. Okay, I just have to say that I still support the recent decision... ...in the wake of all the violence we've experienced... ...to ban any games with ninjas or guns. - Yeah, but? Well, it's just, I don't understand any of the rules to this... ..."baseball," they call it. You mean, America's pastime? Yeah, feels like more of a fad to me, buddy. I don't really see it catching on. Sure. You called Marissa and Summer, right? They're with the Dark Lord Sauron or whatever the DA's name is. Did that guy blink during your deposition? I feel like he didn't even have eyelids. Hello. Oh, I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Can I take a message? Dallas McPherson will stand in... Okay, thank you. That was the hospital. Trey woke up. Kirsten, right? Hi, I'm Charlotte Morgan. I'm so sorry about interrupting you in group. Oh, no, no, that's okay. When I heard you talking, it was like you were describing my life. The rich, dominating father, the high pressure... ...nothing was ever good enough. - I'm just glad I didn't bore you. - No, it was amazing. I mean, to hear someone on the same journey as me. Well, obviously... ...you're a little further along. I could never have admitted all that. - You're so brave and honest. - I don't know about that, but thank you. Do you wanna maybe get coffee sometime? We can talk trash about our dads. Sure, I'd love to. Okay. That's my husband. Well, I don't wanna take up any more of your time. Goodbye. Bye. Look at you. So it exploded all over the kitchen? - The microwave, mostly. - An entire jar of peanut butter? Well, we were trying to make peanut-butter cookies... ...as a surprise for you. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Well, it's a well-known science factoid that metal plus heat equals... Peanut butter everywhere. These are just a few of the lessons we three struggling, handsome bachelors... ...are learning every week. Sounds like you have a reality series here. Oh, I hope it's not a reality for too long. So... Well, you should be coming home any day now, right? Just give me a heads up, so I can make sure the house is livable. Yeah, l... I just have to sit down with Dr. Woodruff soon and see what's going on. See if I'm eligible. Hey, Seth. I'm here with Mom. Well, thanks for calling. I'll see you when I get back at the house. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. He says hi, that he misses you. I better get going. Go back to work. Just let me know what the doctor says. - Yeah. - All right. Hey. So, what's going on? - Trey's awake. - Oh, my God. - When did he...? - Not too long. I just saw him. - You saw him? - Yeah. I've been up there a couple times, you know. I didn't know. - Hey, I would've gone with you. - No. You shouldn't have to see him ever again. I don't have the same choice. Well, I mean, I guess now that he's awake... ...he can tell the lawyers what really happened. Trey got us into this mess, hopefully he can get us out. Yeah, our future's in Trey's hands. Come on, Seth and Summer are at the diner. What do you mean, it'll take two months? Caleb wrote a will, just read it already. It's much more difficult than that, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol. As you can see, there's a lot of paperwork... ...a number of offshore accounts we haven't yet found. Okay. Well, you just take your sweet time, Mr. Frankel. But understand this: We are paying a very high-priced defense attorney... ...to protect our daughter and right now the meter's running. I wish I could help. I'm a grieving widow. - Clearly. - You've seen the will, haven't you, Jeff? Why don't you just tell us what's in it and it'll be our little secret. - I can't do that. - It's our attorney, Julie. Let's play Hot-Cold. Two million. Seven million. I have at least 3 million coming from my prenup. - You blinked. Does one blink mean yes? - Julie, the hospital called. What? What did they say? - Okay. I have an idea. - Are you gonna save Chrismukkah again? Because I really enjoyed that last time. - We need to have some fun. - Fun? Yeah. Look, we can't control the future, right? So how do we deal? We could do what my stepmother does and take painkillers... ...to numb ourselves from the reality that life is random, unfair and meaningless... - There's another option, right? ...or we can accept the fact... ...that we can't worry about what we can't control... ...and just enjoy the time we have. Trey's awake, and school is starting soon. Who knows what's to come, right? So this might be our last chance to have fun. I like plan B. So, what do we do? Well, I have an idea. But I'd have to ask my dad first. Mr. Cooper's got a nice boat, huh? Yeah. It's amazing what laundered money can buy. You know, Cohen, with your two hands on the wheel... ...and the wind blowing through your hair, you actually look kind of hot. Let me guess, Summer, you have a weakness for seamen. - Cohen. - Yeah? And then there's that. Hey. Hey. - How you doing? You okay? - Yeah, I guess. I mean... I don't know, to be honest. Are we okay? Yeah, sure. Why wouldn't we be? Because since that night, we haven't really talked about it. Hey, knock it off. Listen, you gotta get your mind off everything. Who wants to go fishing? You do the hunting, we'll do the gathering. Fishing, I like that idea, but we don't have any bait. Wait, no, we have Summer. This little sardine. - No. - You guys, that's not funny. - Look at this little sardine. - No. No. No! No, guys, come on. Well, if this is as good as it gets for a while... Yeah, that was pretty good. Yeah. Thanks for almost getting my bathing suit wet, Cohen. My pleasure. Cohen. I can't believe that you did that, Cohen. I'm looking for Trey Atwood. I'm sorry. Visiting hours ended a while ago. Oh, did I forget to introduce myself? I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol. As in the Nichol Wing of this hospital which we're both standing in. Oh, hello, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol. My husband was very philanthropic. Hospitals were his favorite charity. Especially making sure... ...nurses and orderlies were compensated for their hard work. I would hate to see his passion fall by the wayside. Hello, Trey. I've been wanting to talk to you. Oh, no, no. No pleasantries. Look at you, lying there all helpless... ...unable to stop me from doing whatever I wanna do. Kind of like the night you tried to rape my daughter. I'm sorry. Oh, you should be, you son of a bitch. Which is why you're gonna help me. In exchange, I'm prepared to compensate you. How does $20,000 sound? - What do you want? - Three simple words. Repeat after me, Trey: "Ryan shot me." Trey? Ryan... ...shot me. Okay, so I know <i>Teen Wolf</i> is not a realistic movie. Really going out on a limb there. But, yeah? Well... I mean, how does being a werewolf make you a better basketball player? Can't argue that one. Hey, fellas, you mind shutting off the TV? Trey talked to the police this morning. He confirmed their suspicion... ...that it was you who shot him. Well, that's a total lie. Now, the DA's office gave me a heads up. They're gonna be issuing a warrant for your arrest in a few hours. We're gonna figure this thing out. But I need to know that you are telling me everything that happened. What difference does it make? You're gonna fix this, right? A little early for champagne, don't you think? I'm making mimosas. They're breakfast-appropriate. Besides, we should celebrate. Celebrate the fact that Marissa's boyfriend is getting arrested? No, the fact that Marissa isn't. You know, Julie, it's just a little too convenient. Trey wakes up and immediately points the finger at Ryan? Well, sometimes, Jimmy, and I know you don't have... ...that much experience with this, but things work out. You know, even if Marissa was accused... ...she wouldn't go to jail. - She also wouldn't be going to college. Forget what the law says about just cause and defense of others. How's it gonna look on her college application: - "Shoots blue-collar thugs." - I don't want Marissa to suffer either... ...but Ryan... - Ryan's die was cast... ...Iong before he moved into the Cohen pool house. Look, Jimmy, let's just put this to bed. We'll collect on Caleb's will, and we'll go back to being a normal, happy family. Hey, what's for breakfast? - Hey, kiddo. What are you doing up? - I can't sleep. Well, I have news that's very good for us. It's just not so good for Ryan. Well, I know he wants to be left alone. We have to do something. Should we bring him a snack? What does Ryan eat? Dry cereal from a box and black coffee. Well, maybe we could get him something, a gift. - Sure. Money's no object. - Okay. What does Ryan like? Any favorite movies? Hobbies? - Cohen, he's your best friend. - You've known him as long as me. I don't hear you throwing out any gems. Well, we can't just leave him alone in there. I know. But who even knows what to say to him? He's never been arrested before... ...for attempted murder. - Where is he? - He's not really seeing visitors right now. We're kind of giving him his space. - This should go well. - Right behind you, Coop. - Hey. - Hey. Hoodie, wifebeater, leather jacket. It's the Ryan Atwood escapist ensemble. That's right. No matter what I say, no one's gonna believe me. - Dude, you're not running away. - Yeah. Yeah, I am. No. No, you're not. You're sailing. And we're coming with you. Yes. Since apparently there's boats involved, which is my forte. Totally. We all go down together. Thanks. How was your visit? Is your husband excited you're coming home? Yes, he is. Didn't tell him you're not ready yet, huh? - Been there. - Well... ...if Dr. Woodruff says I'm ready, I must be ready. Except he won't be there at 3 a.m. when you're rooting around the spice rack... ...for anything with alcohol and start pounding vanilla extract. Oh, God. I'm... I'm sorry. Is that what happened to you? It was cough syrup. That's my biggest fear, that I'm not ready. And I'm not going back to my husband and my boys until I know... ...that I'll never let them down again. Look, can I give you some advice? It's not a race. Take all the time you need. Hello. I'm back. - We're looking for Ryan Atwood. - You're a little late, I'm afraid. Nope, she's not here either. And she left for your house hours ago, Sandy. You don't think they'd try anything, do you? - What's going on? - The cops are at Sandy's. The kids are gone. We don't know where they went. You don't think your dad'll miss the boat? Well, he of all people will understand. - But we gotta hurry. - Let's go. - Hey, man, how long is it to Catalina? - About four hours. Then from there we can go wherever you want. Mexico, Hawaii. Look, guys, you can get in a lot of trouble for this... ...so if you wanna back out... This is a great excuse to skip school. It's not forever. It's just until we can get Trey to change his story. - I understand that, but... - Yeah. Glad to see the jump suit still fits. Well, kid, for someone who's innocent, you've done a hell of a job to look guilty. Glad to see you're here to make me feel better. No, I'm here to tell you the truth. As your lawyer and your guardian. The only person who runs is somebody who's got something to hide. Or who has no choice. I see how these cops and lawyers look at me. My record, my family. And you know I'm right. This isn't over. The arraignment's set for tomorrow. We're gonna fight this. - Trey could still change his mind. - Yeah. How's that gonna happen? I haven't worn this candy-striper's outfit since, like, the 10th grade. Maybe we should volunteer again. It's good for charity. Not that I'm against you guys wearing these uniforms, because I'm not... ...but doesn't this plan seem lighthearted given the nature of the predicament? You're not part of the plan. We're just letting you push a cart. Okay, Sum, you're on. - Hey, Denise. How are you? - Summer Roberts. I haven't seen you in years. Where you been? Oh, I love helping sick people. It's just, they kept making me sick. So I've been reassigned... ...to gunshot victims because you can't catch one of those. Well, glad to have you back. Who do you wanna see? I don't wanna speak to anyone else. Hey, did you hear what l...? Did you come to finish the job? So you do remember it was me who shot you. I... I'm trying to protect you. Protect me? By blaming Ryan? I'm... I'm sorry, Marissa. For... For everything. I... I just didn't know how to make it right. And she offered me a way out. What? Who did? Your mom. Look... ...Trey... ...if you wanna make it right, there's only one thing for you to do. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey. - Thanks for meeting me. - Sure. Sorry to hear about Ryan. - You think things couldn't get worse. - That's why I wanted to talk to you. I've been trying to figure out why Trey would try to frame Ryan. You know, I know the kid's not gonna be sainted any time soon... ...but still. The only thing I can figure? Somebody paid him. But who would sink that low? Only one name came to mind. And you didn't try to stop her. Look, l... I found out about it too late, there was nothing I could do. Jimmy, at some point you gotta do the right thing. Well, you gotta understand what I'm dealing with. Put yourself in my shoes. In your shoes? I got a wife in rehab who doesn't wanna come home... ...and a kid locked up for something he didn't do. I think your shoes are looking pretty good. Look, l... I get it, I get it. I'm trying to protect my family too. Right. Because family means so much to you. - What's that supposed to mean? - What are you doing back in Newport? Caleb dies... suddenly you show up. Grand Central Station. Hello? Okay. Thank you. Wait till Julie hears this. Hi, sweetie. I'm still learning how to do the wash, so whatever no longer fits... ...we'll just send it to your sister. I know what you did. What do you mean? - What's this? - A copy of Trey's confession. Saying that if I didn't shoot him, he would have killed his brother. The police have one too. Do you know what you've done? I'm not going to jail. But where are you gonna go, Marissa, huh? You know how small this town is. This will get out. - What? That I saved my boyfriend's life? - That you shot someone. When there's a scandal, no one cares about the details. All you care about is what people in Newport think of us. Of you. You know, I don't need you to protect me. I need you to stay out of my life. - What happened? - You have a hell of a girlfriend. And if you two get married, you'll have a hell of a mother-in-law. But you're free. There's something I gotta do. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. This one time, when we were kids... ...Trey got in this big fight with my mom... ...and her boyfriend of the day... ...and he ran away. And I stayed up all night... ...waiting for him... ...wondering where he went. It was always me and Trey against the world. How would I make it without him? And now here I am again... ...alone... ...wondering where he went. - Hey, look, you're not alone this time. I know, I know. - I really wanna put this behind us. - So do I. But... I mean, can we? I hope so. Okay.
