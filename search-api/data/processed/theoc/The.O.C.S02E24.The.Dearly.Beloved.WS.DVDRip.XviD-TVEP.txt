-You came on to her. -She threw herself at me. -What should I think? -I didn't hook up with him. -I am a good mother. You're also an alcoholic. I may like my chardonnay, but I am not gonna die alone. -And that's more than I can say for you! -Cal! It's about your father. He's dead. I can meet you right away. I want to. Now, I have a funeral to go to in a couple of hours... ...so I gotta keep it brief. But the sooner the better. Thank you. -Hey. -Hey. -Everything okay? -Been better. -I'm sorry about everything. -That's okay, sweetie. -He loved you very much. -Y eah. -I'm gonna miss him. -Need anything? No, I'm looking for my cell-phone charger. My battery's dead. There might be one in your dad's office. -I'm gonna get ready. -All right. -Oh, hey. -Hi. -How you doing? -Well, I was depressed. Now I'm depressed and confused. -A rehab center. Where'd you get this? -My dad's office. I don't think he's trying to kick bagels. I don't think it's for your dad. Why don't you tell me more about your wife, about her history. Well, Kirsten's always enjoyed a glass of wine or two... ...but in the last few months, it's changed. She's changed. -Changed how? -She switched to vodka for starters. Last week she had a car accident. And now I'm afraid, with the loss of her father, things are gonna get worse. I assume you'd want her to have a residential treatment. And as you can see, we provide... ...a confidential and peaceful environment for recovery. You know, doctor, l-- I might be overreacting. I know how hard it is to accept. We all wanna think we can get someone we love through something like this. She's not gonna come voluntarily. Very few of our patients check themselves in. I'm getting ready. My black dresses look like they should be accessorized with a broomstick. -Do you have anything I could borrow? -It's a funeral, Mom, not a fashion show. Sorry. Look, let me see what I've got, okay. -Wait. I can do it. -No. You've been through more than enough. I didn't mean to be a bitch. Apples and trees. You are my daughter. Which means I must have something that'll look great on you. -Dad. -Hey, kiddo. Hey. -Hey, Jules. -Jimmy. -What are you doing here? -Think I'd leave you alone during this? Well, I can see how you might, but I'm.... I'm so sorry. I really am. -It's really good to see you. -Yeah. Really good. Well, I'm sure it's been a hard week, but... ...we'll get through it. -Hey, sis. -Hey. Oh, it's so good to see you. He said his heart thing was no big deal, not worth flying home for. He didn't wanna worry you. -You were his little girl. -I know. And after all these years, I caused him nothing but stress and anxiety. Nothing made him more proud than seeing you get your life together. Me? The last time I saw him, I told him he was gonna die alone. -Hi. -Hey, Cohen. Captain Oats around? I brought him some company. Princess Sparkle, you're in my room. Yeah. I figured Oats would be pretty down... ...could use the companionship of someone sweet and with shinier hair... ...that would just, you know, be there for him. Yeah. Well, the captain's pretty lucky. Well, if he gets fresh with her, it's straight to the glue factory. -Hi. -Hi. I know you and your grandpa were close. -It's actually my mom I'm worried about. -Your mom? Yeah. This morning I was in my dad's office, and I found, like, a brochure for rehab. Oh, my God. Has she been drinking a lot? Well, I mean, she's a Wasp living in Orange County, so it's all relative, right? I don't know. She has a glass of wine at dinner, maybe two. -Any more than that? -That's the thing. I've been so self-involved this past year, I don't even know. I have no idea. And I'm sure it's, you know, at least partially my fault. I know running away was really hard on her last summer, and-- Cohen, no offense, but you're being self-involved again. I think this is bigger than you. I should go put on my tie. It always takes me a few tries. Yeah. I didn't think you got up this early. Maybe I haven't been to sleep yet. Something's come up. What's going on? It's graduation time, which always means big business. I got a call from a couple of kids who basically supply Garden Grove. I'm real happy for you. For us. It's gonna be huge, like 1 5 grand. I'll give you half. -And why would you do that? -Because I need your help. -Where the hell did you get that? -Do you know how to use it? I'm not, like, a sniper or anything. Can you point it at somebody like you mean it? Then you get half. Now... ...I definitely... ...need to get some sleep. Thanks for coming. Julie. We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Caleb Nichol. His loss is felt across the county, across the-- Caleb Nichol was not a man of many words. He was, however, a brilliant man. He leaves a legacy of possibility. But his true achievement were his children. He was a caring father, a wonderful grandfather... ...a truly terrible father-in-law. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... -...I will fear no evil.... " -So... ...he may be gone, but he won't soon be forgotten. Rest in peace, Cal. And if you can't do that... ...I'm sure heaven could use a few more McMansions. What are you doing here? -I do work for a living. -Yeah? Hang out with me and you won't have to. Let me ask you a question. Why don't you ever worry about, like, calculus or Mayan history... -...Iike a normal teenager? -Bad parenting. So it looks like everything's gonna go down tonight... -...and it's gonna go down here. -What do you mean? I needed a public place. The last kid who sold to them... ...ended up with a tire iron upside the head. -Look, if you don't wanna do it-- -Look, I said I'm gonna do it, and I will. But after this, I am done. I figured if I didn't initiate, you wouldn't talk to me. Hailey, hey. No. I'm sorry, I had my hands full with Julie and Marissa. -You don't hate me for bailing on you? -People in glass houses, Hail. -So you moved to Hawaii. How is it? -It's fantastic. -You would not believe the North Shore. -So I've heard. She's-- She's taking it pretty hard, huh? I've never seen her like this. We have bartenders we're paying to do that. -I don't like waiting in line. -You know, honey, it's still early. This thing's gonna going on for a while. Maybe you wanna pace yourself. Maybe I don't. My father just died. Maybe you wanna lay off the Kirsten drink count. -Look, I know you're upset. -You're right. I am. If it would help, I could take over Kirsten watch for a while. I don't know if anything's gonna help. So then let her glower at me. I'm used to it. Unfortunately, so am I these days. Thank you, Julie. I have officially talked to every pillar of the community. I'm sick of pillars. You don't have everyone asking if you burned down Caleb's home... ...and caused his heart attack. Everyone's looking at me like I'm the grieving stepdaughter. -I don't think the guy could stand me. -Where is Summer? Is she smoking the salmon herself? -You guys wanna hide in the pool house? -Oh, so bad. Mrs. Cohen, I thought you might be hungry. Oh, no thank you, Summer. If my stepmother taught me anything, it's to never drink on an empty stomach. Thanks for the tip. -Hey, Summer. -Hey, Mr. C. Boy, you really cleaned out the buffet, huh? -Well, I have extra if you want any. -I am powerless before a whitefish. Could you do me a little favor? This thing is gonna be going on for a little while... ...and, you know, Seth's been through a lot the last couple days. It might be a great idea if you could get him out of the house for a little while. -Yeah. Sure thing. -Thanks. -Hey. -Hey. Funeral food is so depressing. I thought maybe we could go get some chili fries... ...and maybe stop by the Bait Shop or something. Good idea. Hey, Ryan, you don't think Trey will be there, do you? No, he's on day shifts. Be fine, promise. Do I still even work here? I should find out for tax purposes. You've gotta be kidding me. Great. Hey. Man, I'm so sorry about your grandfather. -Thanks. -What are you doing here? -I came by to pick up a paycheck. -Paychecks are handed out on Mondays. -Even I know that, and I've been fired. -Oh, yeah? When was that? You guys are dressed up. We just came from my grandfather's funeral. Yeah. Well, he was probably pretty old. Ready, Trey? Bye, party people. You wanna go grab us some seats? -Yeah, we'll get drinks. -Okay. Come on. It's bad enough this has to go down in the place I work at, but with Ryan here? Afraid you're gonna look bad in front of Marissa? No, I just think we should go someplace else. The pier, whatever. It's too late. Our friends are already on their way. Is it loaded? Okay, Coop, you wanna tell me what that was about between you and Trey? -What are you talking about? -I don't know... ...gamma rays of hate shooting out of your eyeballs. I mean, problems with Ryan, a weird tension with Trey. One girl, two brothers. It's all a little Legends of the Fall. -I never saw that one. -Hey, Marissa. Hi. I guess if I still worked here I could make the drinks myself. -So how are you, man? -Not good. My head's all over the place. I still haven't had a chance to talk to my dad. Two Y oo-hoos and a couple of smoothie chasers, please. And what about you? I mean, how's--? How's work? How's the family? Well, actually, not so good. You know, you left, boy, just before things got really crazy. -Yeah, well, that was the idea, I guess. -Sandy. I need your help. Excuse me. For God's sake, Kirsten, at least use a glass. For God's sake, Sandy, just leave me alone. It's been a long day, and I bet you could probably use a little sleep. -I feel okay. -Come on. Let's just go to bed. Get your hands off me! Are you happy? -Kirsten. -I'm okay. Jimmy, I'm okay. I got you. You got the money? Have your taste, then we're all good. The speed and E are in the bag. Same quality. Actually, we don't have enough to cover the coke. How about we set up a payment plan. We pay when we feel like it. -Yo, what's up? We had a deal. -We're renegotiating. What are you gonna do about it, you little Newport beyotch? -Who's the bitch now? -What the hell do you think you're doing? Give me my money, get in your rice rocket, and drive away. You're gonna have to shoot me. Get down! -Everybody okay? -Marissa. Oh, my gosh. It's just broken glass. Wait. Hold on. I can answer all of your questions now. You already have. There was only one answer to that question. Where is she? - Yes, I know why you came back. -Sleeping it off. How long has this been going on? T oo long. You know, last night sealed the deal. She's getting help, whether she wants it or not. Speaking of help, how can l? Well, I'm gonna need to talk to the boys privately. -I don't know what they know. -I can get her out of the house. Maybe a day at the spa. -Thanks, Hail. -Yeah. -Hey. I had a feeling I'd see you-- -Can l.... -Can I come in? -Yeah. Yeah. -You want something to drink--? -What happened last night? I was helping Jess out. It got a little out of control, man. Story of your life, right? Yeah, but that was it, man. -I told her I'm done. -Done. I heard that before too. I know, but Jess turned out to be a little crazier than I expected. Really? You met her face down in a pool. I screwed up. I know that. What do you want me to say? I don't want you to say anything... ...anymore. We gave it a shot. We tried to make it work. -I swear to God, Ryan-- -I want you out of Newport. Come on, man. We're brothers. We're blood. -Granted, I got more of Dad's bad luck-- -You gotta go, Trey. Okay. I'll be gone first thing in the morning. I figured you hadn't learned how to brew coffee yet. Okay, marrying Caleb didn't exactly turn me into a domestic goddess. I brought your favorite powdered-sugar doughnuts from 7-Eleven. Thank you. So listen... ...I was hoping you, me, Marissa take the boat out and sail to Catalina today. Oh, well, except Marissa won't be up till close to sundown, so.... Well, then how about you and I go? You and me. Grab some lobsters... ...dead ones, of course, hang out, have lunch. We haven't done that in like a million years, since before we were married. Okay. I'll write Marissa a note. -Hey. -Hey. -I was making some cereal. Want some? -No, I'm good, thanks. We got a lot of leftovers, and food is arriving by the truckload. Yeah, it's the silver lining of any funeral. -How's Mom? Is she up yet? -Yeah. She's spending the day at a spa, getting a little R and R. Well, that's good. She could use a day to relax. She hasn't really been too mom-esque lately. Well, that's true. She's suffering right now. Well, she was really close to grandpa, so.... Oh, it's bigger than that, Seth. Your mother has a drinking problem. She needs help. You mean like that rehab brochure I found you just forgot to mention? I've been waiting for the right time... -...and hoping I can do this myself. -Maybe we can. So she's drinking. We ask her to stop. We don't have to send her away. She can't stop. She's tried. There's a doctor coming here this afternoon. -To help us stage an intervention. -What? Is this like an Afterschool Special? Her dad died. She's sad. She's having a few drinks. This has been going on for a long time. -The car accident she had. -Yeah? Did you know she'd been drinking? No, I didn't, because you never told me. You never told me anything, and you expect me to help ship her off. We're trying to help her. How do I know you didn't cause her to drink? Something weird has been going on. I get that you're upset. I'm upset too. Well, if your way of showing that you're upset is shipping her off... ...I'm not gonna be a part of it. You are a part of it. You wanna run away again, get in your boat and sail away? Your mother needs you. -Come in, Ryan. You should hear this. -Yeah. Apparently, mom's a drunk and today's the intervention... ...so plan your afternoon accordingly. I can talk to him, tell him you're doing the right thing, because you are. Thanks... ...but that's my job. Come in. Hey. How's your head? Okay. It's just a scratch. Well, I was thinking, after the past few days you've had... ...some pancakes and some serious sunbathing... ...could be just what the doctor ordered. That is, if I had a Ph.D. You don't have to take care of me. You kidding? After that scene from Scarface we just lived through... ...I could use a short stack, stat. All right. Well, I appreciate it. Good. So we'll go... ...just as soon as you tell me what's going on. The weird bruise on your neck, and a bad excuse from you. Weird tension with Trey, and then you don't even bother to make up an excuse. Marissa, please don't lie to me. I'm your best friend, and I know something happened. Please just tell me what's going on. Coop? Coop? Oh, sweetie. Maybe I should've told you earlier. I don't know. They left that chapter out of the manual. How long would she go away for? Well, as long as it takes. Months, maybe. This isn't.... This isn't supposed to happen to us. We're not that family. Every family's got their issues. This is ours. I just don't think I can do it. Not to Mom. I get it. That's the doctor from the clinic. We'll be downstairs. I'm sorry. -How you feeling? -Better, thanks. It's just what I needed. That deep-tissue massage worked miracles. That's good. We should see if they want us to pick up food. We should probably just go home. You know, there's a lot of leftovers. Hello. Anyone home? -Hey. -Oh, hey. Why don't you come to the kitchen. I need to talk to you. You're acting awfully mysterious. Oh, I didn't know we had company. Hi, I'm Dr. Kenneth Woodruff. I'm a counselor at the Suriak Drug and Alcohol Abuse Rehabilitation Center. Okay, does someone wanna tell me what's going on? Your family requested I be here to help them lead an intervention. -What for? Why? -We are all here... ...because we are worried that you have an addiction to alcohol. Each person here wants to share their concern for you. Well, that's very nice of everybody, but not necessary. Sandy, you go first. I' m so sorry, honey. How hard this must be for you to hear. -I don't want you to hurt yourself. -Don't you think you're overreacting? I mean, everybody's overreacting. Hailey, please. Now you. Kiks... ...you know our history. Mom battled it, and you know if it was me, you'd do the same thing. I don't know that. All the time you were partying and doing drugs... ...I just encouraged you to make better choices. I didn't lock you up. Ryan. Oh, don't you say a word. I let you into this house. Yeah, you did, because my own mom couldn't take care of me. Because she wouldn't get help even though I asked her to. I don't wanna see that happen again to someone I love. I don't know who you are or what you're doing here... ...but I am not going. Mom, please. You gotta do this. Whether you have a dark complexion, a light complexion. If you-- --earnings per share by 12 cents to 15 cents.... Aren't you glad you got to come back for all this fun? Actually, I am. I'll put the bag in your car. I'll see you soon, sis. I' m so sorry that I put you both through this. -Just get better. -I will. You gonna be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about Dad. We'll set up a stage in the living room. Give him a mike and the music to Starlight Express. I got the takeout menus covered. -I'll order. I' m good with the phone. -We'll be fine, really. I love you both so much. All right, come on. You owe me a rematch. Well, James, other than those disgusting mussels you made me eat... ...this was actually pretty fun. Well, you're entitled to a little fun. Oh, it's just... -...I feel so guilty. -About what? Smiling the day after your husband's funeral? Well, let's-- Let's face it. That marriage wasn't exactly-- What we had? Nothing ever will be. What if I decided to stay? What if, you know, we gave it another shot? We're both older and wiser now. Well, I'm certainly wiser. Going somewhere? I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going. -We could take off together. -Yeah, Jess, and where would we go? Vegas. You a gambler, Trey? I hooked up with you. I'm gonna go home and pack... ...steal my stepdad's Beamer... ...and I'll be back at 8. This floating in the pool thing is not helping. No, I hear you. But neither was video games or the wisdom of Chuck Klosterman. You know, we should get out of the house. Hit up a old-age home, some shuffleboard action. I'm not really in the mood for old people. IMAX movie? Something with sharks, huh? I don't really like sharks. The way things have been going, I bet that's Oliver. -Hey. -Hey. Can I talk to you alone? -What's going on? Everything okay? -No. Look, I'm really sorry to pile on in terms of, like, the worst news ever. Hey, it's okay. What's the matter? When you and Ryan were in Miami, Trey and Marissa.... Yeah? He attacked her, Seth. -What do you mean? -He forced himself on her. He tried to-- But she didn't tell Ryan... ...because, you know, he's Ryan, and who knows what he would do. -Well, he has to know. -You think? Yeah, look, if last night wasn't proof enough, Trey's crazy. What if he attacks you next? I can't not tell him. But how are you gonna tell him? Welcome. I'll show you to your room, but first I need to check your bag, Kirsten. It's standard procedure. Oh, it's a good-sized bed. Oh, nice sheets. High thread count. Nice TV. A lot of channels. I'll bet you get a lot of reading done here. Yeah. Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen, we're having a meeting for new guests. What time is it over? I wanna make sure I'm home when you call. Actually, she won't be able to make any phone calls for 72 hours. It's detox. -Could you give us just a minute? -Yeah. I'm so sorry, Sandy. What I said to you, put you through. Now, we can bend this thing. It doesn't mean it's gonna break. -Hey. -Hey. We should probably go. IMAX movies have previews? Maybe we should skip the movie, actually. Do you wanna sit down, maybe, or stand up or whatever? What's going on? My dad just called. He said my mom just landed at the place. -It's really beautiful, and-- -That's good. Yeah, but also, something more. But before I tell you, you gotta promise you're gonna stay calm. You're not gonna get all old-school Ryan Atwood. -What is it? -Well, it's upsetting. Yeah, we covered that. So I know what happened with Trey and Marissa. Like, what really happened. What do you mean? I guess when we were away, he sort of, like, attacked her or something... ...and kind of forced himself on her. I mean, nothing happened. She fought him off. But that's-- That's why he's got the cut on his head. All year... ...I have tried to be a different person. I can't do that anymore. Wait, Ryan. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna settle this with Trey. Once and for all. What are you guys doing? Oh, well, we thought we'd have dinner as a family. Okay. And breakfast. What's going on here? Well, your father's going to stay with us while we get settled... ...and then maybe after that. If that's okay with you. And with Kaitlin coming home from school... ...we were talking about taking a family trip maybe. Again, if that's okay with you. Anything to have you back, Dad. Thanks, kiddo. I'd really love for us to be a family again. The Coopers making a comeback. Who'd have thunk it? Oh, sorry. One sec. -Hey, can I call you back? -Actually, no. There's a problem. -What's going on? -We're going to Trey's. You're closer. -Maybe you can stop him. -What are you talking about? Ryan knows. -Hey, Ry. -I know what happened. I know what happened with you and Marissa. How could you, man? -I would've done anything for you. -Look, man... -...I was stoned. -lt wasn't my idea, Trey. -I didn't wanna steal that car. -Yeah, well, I went away for it... -...and you got the good life. -So you had to hurt her, huh? No, no. Hey. Okay. Listen, man. You're gonna calm down. You're gonna calm down right now, okay? What are you gonna do, shoot me? Is that how this ends? How this ends is up to you... ...and whether or not you walk away right now. Walk away. Oh, my God. Stop it. You're killing him. Trey, get off of him, please!
