you have to go back to the beginning. His Majesty, the king. My dear sister. Fare you well on your journey. Remember, the king of Portugal, your future husband... ...loves and respects you. And you must love him in return. Remember your promise. When he dies, I marry whom I choose. Charles, as you love me, take care of her. I will. You may have no doubts. I shall treat her as if she were my own sister. God be with all of you. And remember your duties to my lady and to England. Let us pray. His Holiness thanked God for raising up such a prince... ...to be a champion of the Church. And he expressed astonishment that you found time to write the pamphlet. Furthermore, in order to show his gratitude... ...the Pope has decided to honour you with a new title: Fidei Defensor. Fidei Defensor. Defender of the faith. But Your Majesty should know that Martin Luther... ...has also responded to your work. - What did he say? - Well, he accuses you of... Yes? He accuses you of raving like a strumpet in a tantrum. What? He says, " If the king of England gives himself the right... ...to spew out falsehoods, he gives me the right... ...to stuff them back down his throat." He ought to be burned. Give me a hand with these ropes. This is your stateroom. I hope it meets with Your Highness's approval. It will serve. The bed is narrow but adequate. And in case of action, all this panelling will be removed. - Action? - Lf we are attacked. - Who will attack us? - Pirates. It seems to me, Your Grace... ...we have more to fear from the pirates already onboard. - Good morning, madam. - Your Majesty. Your Majesty, Lady Anne Clifford. Your Majesty. Your Gracious Majesty. ; It causes me such pain and grief to return the gifts you gave me. Alas, they are too beautiful and I unworthy to receive them. I think I never gave Your Majesty cause to give them to me... ...since I am nothing and you are everything. Give them, I pray you... ...to a lady more deserving of Your Majesty's affections. I am leaving now for my family's house at Hever. I shall think of you on the journey there. "Your loving servant... ...Anne Boleyn." - Mr. Pace? - At your service, sir. You are to be released. I don't know anything. What's that? I said, you're to be released. I told my wife. I said, I don't know anything, anything at all. You told your wife, Mr. Pace? When? She's sleeping. We talk together. I thought she had died when she gave birth to our son. I was sure I went to the funeral and wept. But now... ...I see she's alive... ...and as well as I. Do you not see her? Yes, Mr. Pace. I see her. Mr. Cromwell. Eminence. I have long noticed your aptitude for work... ...and your diligence in carrying through my affairs. And your discretion. Well, I am grateful to Your Eminence. You are of obscure stock. But then, so am I. It should not be held against you. I may have a proposition to put to you. Thank you, Your Eminence. By the terms of our treaty with the emperor... ...we are obliged to support his war effort financially. At present, his armies are fighting the French in Italy, near Milan. Unfortunately, I have calculated that in order to meet our obligations... ...we shall be obliged to raise taxes. A bill will be presented to Parliament at the next session. - Good, good. - I trust the bill will pass successfully. I am sure, Your Eminence, with your guiding hand, it will be so. At least our alliance with the emperor is popular. Although sometimes I ask myself why that should be so. Because he's not French. Right. The new warship is commissioned at Portsmouth. I forgot to mention to Your Majesty... ...we have a new visitor at court, Princess Marguerite of Navarre. I received her myself yesterday. I found her a beautiful young woman... ...with a very sweet and yielding disposition. She confessed a great admiration for Your Majesty. Should I arrange...? Yes. Yes, do it. With Your Majesty's permission, I intend to appoint a new secretary... ...instead of Mr. Pace. Yes. We're coming up from England. Their whores are the best in the world. Even if you can't understand a word they say. They don't talk to me. They always have their mouths full. There you are, Your Grace. My king has your queen. Well, I was rather hoping that the knave would get the queen. - Eminence. - Your Majesty. May I present Princess Marguerite of Navarre? - Madame. - Majesty. You are visiting here? Oui, Majesty, the count... ...my husband, had to stay behind in France, regrettably. Indeed. Very regrettable, madame. But you must be compensated. You must enjoy some pleasures whilst here. I have some news which may interest Your Grace. The Bishop of Winchester died six months ago. Winchester is the richest parish in England. Wolsey is supposed to appoint his successor. And he just did. He appointed himself. How much more wealth does that man want? - There's more. - Tell me. It appears that he's been using the king's money... ...to invest his new college in Oxford and his own personal foundation. He closes down the worst monasteries, strips them of their assets... ...as he is supposed to do. But instead of transferring all the profit to the privy purse... ...he makes the profits disappear. God. You must tell the king right away. Forgive me, Your Grace, but we must judge the time exactly. Such is Wolsey's hold over the king... ...that whatever the evidence, the king won't believe it. There will come a point when the king's belief in his minister... ...will hang in the balance. And then, Your Grace, we shall drop our truth into the scales. And the scales will fall. Great hunting this weekend. Dear Thomas. Majesty. Come and stay at court. I need you. I'll give you great chambers. Compton has great chambers. You can have his. Much as I love Your Majesty... ...I like my chambers to have my family inside them. Indeed. His Majesty loves you above anyone else, Mr. More, you know that. That may be true. And yet if my head were to win him a casque in Spain... ...I think he would cut it off. Mr. Wyatt. Your Majesty. I hear you're a poet. I write poems. I don't know how to be a poet. I have read some. I like them. My lord, I don't know what to say. Were you in love with Anne Boleyn? I... Cardinal Wolsey tells me you were once engaged. No, that's not true. Did you love her? Lady Anne is so beautiful, it is the duty of every man to love her. Of course I loved her, but from a distance. Personally, I have a wife. Enjoy the feast. Thomas? Thomas Tallis. Hello. We just wanted to say we love your music. Thank you. We share a room. Do you want to come back with us? - I want to finish this song. - Finish it tomorrow. I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow. And you'll forget us too. Compton, my friend... ...what do you think of Princess Marguerite of Navarre? She's well-built, Your Majesty. Little heavy in the top decks for my taste, though. She's Francis' sister. I happen to know that. - Mon Dieu, Henri. - Mon Dieu, Henri. Happy to take your money anytime. You just save your money, captain, for when we get to Lisbon. Good night. Out of the way. Make way. Make way. A messenger from the emperor, Your Majesty. Well, what is it? The emperor has won a great victory against the French. - What are you saying? - At the Battle of Pavia five days ago. The emperor's army totally overcame those of the French. The French army was destroyed. My God. Is this true? Not only that, the French king himself was also captured on the battlefield. Francis? King Francis was captured? Yes, Your Majesty. He is now the emperor's prisoner. You are as welcome here as the angel Gabriel. Feed yourself. Great news. We must celebrate. Huzzah! Point to Mr. Anthony Knivert. Well done, Tony. I tell you, William, I will be called a knight today or I never will be. His Majesty, the king. His Majesty. - My queen. - My lord. My lady. Godspeed, Your Majesty. You see how popular the queen is with the people? She is the daughter of Isabella and Ferdinand. Perhaps the people think she is what a queen ought to be. Mr. William Compton takes His Majesty's challenge. You seem out of sorts today. I have reasons to be downcast and pained... ...but they needn't bother you. Why should we not have pains? Some people think we ought to go to heaven in feather beds. But that is not the way. For our Lord himself went there in pain and tribulation. Not that I'm suggesting that you're like that, of course. Are you ready? I was born ready, William. Your Majesty. Huzzah! A point for His Majesty, the king. Do not look at me. I ask you privately to do something for me. Take this letter to the emperor. You will do this for me... ...and not show it to anyone or speak a word about it. Again. Come on. Get him there. Huzzah! Two points for His Majesty. "I was distressed you would not accept the brooches. They were made for you, not for anyone else. And why are you not worthy when I deem you so? For certain, it must be plain to you now... ...that I desire to find a place in your heart..." Wait. Give it to me. Give it. "That I find a place in your heart... ...and your grounded affection." - Grounded affection? - Grounded. "Tell me at least that we can meet in private. I mean nothing more than a chance to talk to you." - I beg you, come back to court soon. - Give it back, brother. Meanwhile, accept this new gift and wear it for my sake." What gift? And where is it? Oh, holy Jesus. Bring it here, lads. Very, very good rider. When will you bring my niece back to court? Soon, I think. Now the king's appetite is whetted. What's this? Just a trick, Your Majesty. Just a trick. His Majesty, the king and Mr. Anthony Knivert, en plaisance. Ready? Lance. The king's forgotten his visor. Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold. Majesty. Your Majesty. - I'm not hurt. - Let me see. - Not your eyes, thank God. - Cloth. See? See? Your Majesty. Will you forgive me? Will you? It's not your fault, Anthony. It's all my fault. It's my fault. - You didn't hurt me. You can't hurt me. - No. Let's run again. Henry. Henry. Madam, have no fear. I intend to ride again... ...and prove to everyone that I am well and unharmed. If you insist, but I would much rather you did not. My lady. Arm yourself. Yes. Are you ready for me, Anthony? People of England, your king is unharmed. Lance. He's breathing. Get a physic, quick. Knivert! Anthony. Anthony. You wanted to see me, Your Highness? Only to ask how much longer we must be at sea. With a fair wind, two more days. Do you play cards, Your Grace? Sometimes, Your Highness. What game shall we play? You choose. French ruff. You pick trumps. - Kings. - How appropriate, Your Highness. Wine? As you please. Your Highness must be looking forward... ...with great anticipation to your wedding. I hear the king was a great horseman in his time. And famous for his beautiful mistresses. Don't tease me. I don't like it. Will you like it when an old man tries to make love to you? Your Grace goes too far already. Gospel says the truth will make you free. Now you are blasphemous. My poor lady should not hear you. My lady. - My lady. - My lady. I want you to leave. Do you? Yes. Now. Pity. I had a winning hand. Send a message to the emperor. Tell him of our joy and contentment at his great victory at Pavia... ...and his capture of the French king. Yes, Your Majesty. Ask him what he intends to do with Francis. And whether or not, with Francis captive... ...it may not be a good time to think about striking France itself. Tell him we have gold, men and ships at his disposal... ...and are eager to do battle and share some of his glory. Yes, I shall. Your Majesty, this is your new secretary. This is Thomas Cromwell. He is a trained barrister... ...a diligent man and a scholar. He will be very useful for Your Majesty. - Mr. Cromwell. - Your Majesty. Ladies. And back, of course. May I see you privately? Sweetheart. My lady. Why does Wolsey open my letters? Am I not the queen of England? - Are you sure he does? - I am sure. Then I shall stop it. Cardinal Wolsey can be too zealous. But it is always in our interest. Unless you have secrets. Mr. Anthony Knivert. - Anthony. - Majesty. - You almost lost an eye. - Never use that one much anyway. Kneel. I dub thee Sir Anthony Knivert. Arise, Sir Anthony, and be recognised. Mr. William Compton. Why so reproving a look, Sir Anthony? Majesty, I nearly lost an eye for the same reward. But you never carried a tree. William. Kneel. So that is why it is to be understood that the Pope... ...far from being a descendant of St. Peter... ...is a sinner, a hypocrite, a handmaiden to the devil... ...the living Antichrist on earth. This is what Luther teaches us... ...in order to free us from false worship and false idols. In order that we might return to the true religion... ...and take the true and fruitful path to salvation. Our message of hope, of liberty, of truth... ...is already spreading throughout Europe from one corner to the other. Here in England... ...we have planted a seed that will, with prayer, with action... ...and perhaps even with sacrifice, grow one day... ...to become a great tree whose branches will overreach the kingdom... ...and destroy the putrid monastic houses of the Antichrist! And this tree... ...this tree will be called the Liberty Tree. And in its branches, all the angels of the Lord will sing hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've dreamt of this moment a long time. Anne, you must know I desire you with all my heart. Anne. The young man you were dallying with earlier... ...who was he? My brother, George. - Her Majesty expects me. - Later. Who was that, Your Majesty? Just a girl. Your new kingdom. - The king must be looking forward to... - Don't. I forbid you. I should hate you. But you don't. I know you don't. What will I do? Save me. Margaret. You are even more handsome than your portrait. I feel so greatly fortunate... ...that you are soon to be my queen. Everything here is at your disposal. I only want you to be happy... ...and to make me happy. And then we will make children... ...many children... ...with God's help! What are you doing? What the king ordered. Perhaps you don't understand. But I can't sleep, I can hardly breathe for thinking of you. Your image is before my eyes every waking second. I almost believe that I would sacrifice my kingdom... ...for an hour in your arms. I beg you... ...name some place that we can meet and when. Where I can show you truly an affection which is beyond common affection. Written with the hand of your servant, Henry. Now he is your servant? With some subtle care and the lure of your flesh... ...he may become something even closer. Did His Majesty? Hold. - What is it? - Ground's too boggy. We're gonna have to go around. Says who? We can't jump this ditch, Your Majesty. You mean you can't jump this ditch. Flagpole. - Majesty? - Yes, Sir Anthony? What are you doing? I'm gonna vault this stupid ditch. Nothing stands in the way of me and my sport. Are you sure? Just watch and see what the king of England can do. Your Majesty! Fetch a physician, quickly. With Your Majesty's permission, may I dance with your wife? When do you leave? Tomorrow. You can't. Why can't I? I've discharged my duty. Why should I stay? You have a life to lead. It's strange. Some men who seem at the peak of health... ...who are still young and full of life... ...suddenly collapse and die. By that same counter... ...some old men whose bodies look worn out... ...whose race seems run... ...they can go on for years. Don't you think it's strange? Do you tease me because it amuses you? Why else? Because you love me. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, we would like to bleed you a little... ...to drain away the bile which is causing Your Majesty so much pain. With your permission. Yes. I almost died. - Yes, Your Majesty. - No! Not "Yes, Your Majesty." I almost died! Don't you understand? Since that moment, I've done a great deal of thinking. What if I had died? What would I have left? I have no heir. Only a daughter and a bastard son. You understand, Wolsey? The Tudor dynasty, gone. All my father's work finished. And it's my fault. I have lived too long for pleasure. I never even thought of the future. I married my brother's wife and God has punished me. I've been such a fool. Now everything has changed.
