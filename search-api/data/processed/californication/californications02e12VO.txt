Way more than i thought. Yeah, i know the feeling. At first, fucking him was... Was just a way of yanking your chain. Really? You don't say? Yeah, but then he just had to win me over, you know? Like some sweet, mangy little puppy Who just wanted someone to pet him And tell him he was a good boy. Then he'd shit the rug. Or hump your leg. Mm. Where's your first stop? Uh, borders in tacoma. Know it. There's a great coffee shop down the street. Around the block, there's this old record store, Sells used vinyl, tons of it... fantastic. Great...  old guy's guide to tacoma. Good to know.

You heard the bearded woman. Y-You're okay with that? I'm not entirely convinced it's mine. You know, i never came inside her. I don't... i don't think i did. I mean, when she broncoed me, I spasmed out a little dog water, you know. Thank you. I'm still holding out the hope That she banged some dude in the p.F. Chang's parking lot While she was looking for mr. Goodbar. I think that's an entirely plausible scenario. There is something wrong with you. Well, i'm special. I think i'm special. I really do. What does jeff becca think about you tearing our family apart? Well, no...  right now... she's heartbroken right now. Yeah, of course she's heartbroken.

That's the problem... i wasn't thinking.</i> I mean, she fucking kissed me, dude. That kind of shit just doesn't just happen to me a lot... Like ever. W...  w...  yo. Be that as it may, on the flip side, What i've got is a young girl whose heart is broken. Yeah, i know. I know, and i feel all sorts of awful about it. But, you know, i've been thinking about it, And given the opportunity to...  to do it again, I don't think it would go any differently, honestly. I mean, a beautiful girl is kind enough to kiss you... Fuck, you kiss her right back. 'Cause... You know, who...  who knows Where that kiss is gonna take you? I went there to kick his ass, And i stayed to soak up his wisdom. They know more than we do... the children. We forget. Which is why we end up in these fucked-Up situations. Yeah. Selling bmws in the valley... What the fuck, dude? Don't kid yourself, pal. I always was. Selling writers, actors, directors... It's all the same shit. Have you talked to the marce? Through the lawyers. She's a little feral right now... Wants to take me for all i'm worth. Oh, no. All four figures? I don't even care, really. I just want to be happy, you know. That's all that matters now... the big happy. Right...  pimping rides, living in a studio apartment In the valley with a porno chick.

Woman! Uhh, i'm tapping out. You had me looking for the fucking rodeo clown. Really? Hey, you know what? I think you should come to new york. Well. Why the change of heart? I can't live without this. I thought maybe it was 'cause You wanted to make a black baby with me. No, i just need a manny. Oh, i have excellent references. Plus, my vagina's become really attached to you. Not your heart? Just your vag? Well, it's tough if, you know, The heart and the vag are not on the same page. But, you know what? In this instance, they are. Well, that's terrific because i am all about Improving heart/vag relations, you know? It's my thing. So we're in sync. Mm-Hmm. Should we take advantage of that? Could...  could we... Round two? Yeah. I'm answering the bell. You got five minutes, runkle. You look beautiful. That's right, motherfucker, i do. I've always looked beautiful. That's true. You have. Then why the fuck did you have to go And stick your dick into some skanky porno chick? I don't know. I got confused. You could've stayed with me. You were number 19. There were 18 cocks before you, charlie... Not a ton, not a rogues gallery, But enough to know that i liked yours the best. Not the longest, not the thickest, Little bit of english on it, but it was mine...  all mine. And now you and your cock Have betrayed me for the last time. Don't go, marce. I'm already gone, baby.

He said something about intense video wanting to "Buy 'vaginatown' For a shitload of money." Really? That's good news. Oh, hells yeah. It's great news... for me. What? You said i could have everything. But don't worry your pretty little head about it. We'll let my lawyer figure it out. He's really good. Later, runkle. Where's my ipod? I can't find my fucking ipod! Bec... It's gonna be a long trip. Yeah. What? Something pubescent this way comes. Okay, i know you hate me right now. I do. Okay, but i figured i'd hate myself even more If i didn't, you know, at least say goodbye. That's it? That's the best you can do? Here, i got you something. I put a playlist on there... Our playlist... the one we made out to... All 17 songs. What?! 17 songs? That's a lot of making out. Hank, could you shut up? He said 17 songs. I still loathe you. I know. I know. And you have every right. I do feel like i was unjustly seduced, But i know that doesn't make it okay. Anyway, i just wish you weren't leaving 'cause... 'Cause i...  i love you... becca moody. You're like the only post-Punk, heavy-Metal chick Who's ever truly rocked my world. Is it okay if we go upstairs for a minute? Of course... no fucking way. No, no, no. You take it out on the strand Where there are people, and i'm watching you... Eyes in the back of my head. As always. Hey, damien. Well played. Big ups. You know, that was a nice parental move. I...  yeah. I kind of... I like the way you handled that shit. That's right, mothafuckah! I feel kind of bad splitting them up right now. Well, then don't. What do you mean? You go. I stay. Are you crazy? What, you think i'd leave becca behind? Well, i'm not gonna break her. I promise. Well, hold on a second. What about you? I mean, you'd give up new york? For her, yeah. At the end of the day, it's all about her. It's always been about her. What happens between us, i can't fucking control. Lord knows i've tried every which way. But what i can do Is be the absolute best i can be for her. If i followed you to new york, I'd just be hoping against hope That we lived happily ever after. Maybe we do. Maybe we don't. But you got some shit you got to do, lady. I think you should do it. I'll hold down the fort... Keep her off the pole. Oh, jesus. I wish you hadn't just said all that. Why? I don't know. 'Cause, you know, it just makes me love you even more. Yeah, well... that really can't be helped. I am me, after all. A quick one while they're away? You're disgusting. Mm. Look, just because it's you and me now, alone, Doesn't mean i'm gonna let you get away with stuff. It's good. 'Cause i'm not gonna let you get away with stuff either. Oh, really?

You're disappointed, aren't you? Well, you know, i did kind of like not knowing. It was...  it was cool In a "last tango in paris" kind of way. I think you mythologize me just a little too much. You know, i'm just a normal girl... With normal wants and needs. You know, i have been around the block a time or two, lady, And there ain't nothing normal about you. Aw, you're still the sweetest guy i ever fucked and robbed. You know, i'd like nothing more than to get high, Fuck you goofy, and indulge your larcenous tendencies, But i have a, uh, serious child-Raising... Problem here. Look at that. I think she's... she's looking for a bong. And the dance continues. So it does. She seems nice. I don't know if "nice" is exactly the word. Have you been intimate with her? Why do you got to talk to me like that?! What? You're always up in my grill about boys. Well, and up in your grill i always will be. Count on it. Don't stop, okay? Even if i curse your name on a semi-Daily basis. I wouldn't dream of it. He gig. Hey. Oh. What's this for? For staying. You're stuck on the island now. And you did it for me.
