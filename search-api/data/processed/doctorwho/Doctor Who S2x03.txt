What are Krillitanes? 00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,815  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523 They're a composite race. Just like your culture is a mixture of traditions from many countries, 00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,213  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523 people you've invaded or been invaded by, 00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:38,457  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523 the Krillitanes are the same, an amalgam of races they've conquered. 00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,966  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523 But they take physical aspects as well. 00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:44,123  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523 They cherry pick the best bits from the people they destroy. 00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,161  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523 That's why I didn't recognise them. The last time I saw Krillitanes 00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:51,872  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523 they looked just like us except with really long necks. What are they doing here? 00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:57,412  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523 It's the children.
