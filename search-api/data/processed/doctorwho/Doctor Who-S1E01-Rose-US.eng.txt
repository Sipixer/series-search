The store closes in five minutes.' Oi! Wilson? I've got the lottery money. Wilson? You there? I can't hang about cos they're closing the shop. Wilson? (Oh, come on.) SOMETHING BANGS Hello? Hello? Wilson, it's Rose. Hello? W... Wilson? Wilson! Wilson? DOOR SLAMS SHUT (Oh, you're kidding me!) SOMETHING BANGS Is that someone mucking about? Who is it? OK. You got me. Very funny. Right, I've got the joke! Whose idea was this? Is it Derek's? Is it? Derek, is this you? Run! You pulled his arm off! Yep, plastic. Very clever, nice trick. Who are they, students? A student thing? Why would they be students? I don't know! You said it. Why students? Cos... that many people dressed up and being silly has to be students. That makes sense. Well done. Thanks. They're not students. When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police. - Who's Wilson? - Chief electrician. - Wilson's dead. That's just not funny. That's sick! Mind your eyes. I've had enough of this. Who are you, then? Who's that lot down there...? I said WHO are they? They're living plastic creatures. They're being controlled by a relay device from the roof, which would be a great big problem IF I didn't have this. So I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up. I might well die, but don't worry(!) You go home. Go and have your lovely beans on toast. Don't tell anyone. If you do, you'll get them killed. I'm the Doctor, what's your name? Rose. Nice to meet you. Run for your life! TV: 'Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.' I know, it's on the telly! It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive. Honestly, it's aged her. Skin like an old Bible. You'd think I was her daughter. Oh, and here's himself. I've been phoning! You could have been dead! It's all on the news! I can't believe your shop went up! Honestly, I'm fine. Don't fuss! But what happened? I don't know. What caused it? I wasn't in there. I was outside, I didn't see anything. It's Debbie. She knows a man on the Mirror, 500 quid for an interview. Oh, that's brilliant, give it here. You've got to find some way to make money. I'm not bailing you out. PHONE RINGS Bev, she's alive! I've told her, sue for compensation... She was within seconds of death. You drinking tea? That's no good! You need something stronger. I'm OK. You deserve a proper drink. We're going down the pub. My treat. Is there a match on? ...No, no... I'm just thinking about you! There's a match on, ain't there? We COULD catch the last five minutes. Go on, then. I'm fine, really, go. And get rid of that. Bye-bye. Bye! Aaaggghhh! '15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.' ALARM CLOCK BUZZES There's no point in getting up, sweetheart. You've no job to go to. There's Finch's. You could try them. They've always got jobs. Oh, great, the butcher's. It might be good. You were getting airs and graces. I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma. Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek! I know she is Greek, but that's not the point. It was a valid claim. Mum, you're such a liar! I said to nail the cat-flap. We'll get strays! I did it weeks back. Na... you thought about it. What are you doing here? I live here. What do you do that for? Cos I do! I'm here cos someone blew up my job! I must have the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you? Nope, bonehead. Bye. You, inside, right now. Who is it? It's about last night. He's part of the inquiry. She deserves compensation! Oh, we're talking millions. I'm... I'm in my dressing gown. Yes, you are. There's a strange man in my bedroom. Yes, there is. ..Well, anything could happen. No. Don't mind the mess. Coffee? Might as well, thanks, just milk. We should go to the police. Seriously. That won't last. He's gay and she's an alien. I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke... Sad ending. It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler." Ah, could've been worse. Look at the ears! He was nice. He was a nice bloke. Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying. I want you to explain. Maybe not. FLAPPING SOUND What's that? ...Have you got a cat? No. We did have, but we just get strays. They come in off the estate. I told Mickey to chuck that out. You're all the same. Give a man a plastic hand... Anyway, I don't even know your name. Doctor what? It's all right, I've stopped it. There. See... armless! You think?! Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off? I can. This is me, swanning off. But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me! Well observed. You can't walk away! That's not fair. You've got to tell me what's going on. No, I don't. All right, I'll go to the police. I'll tell everyone. You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice. Tell me or I'll talk. Is that supposed to sound tough? Sort of. Doesn't work. Who are you? Told you, the Doctor. Yeah, but Doctor what? Just the Doctor. The Doctor? Hello! Is that meant to sound impressive?! Sort of. Come on then, you can tell me. I've seen enough. Are you the police? No! I was just passing. I'm a long way from home... But what have I done wrong? How come those plastic things come after me? Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you. You got in the way, that's all. It tried to kill me! It was after me, not you! I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all! I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down. It fixed on you cos you'd met me. So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you? Sort of, yeah. You're full of it! Sort of, yeah. All this plastic stuff, who else knows? No-one. What, you're on your own? Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on. OK. Start from the beginning. I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it? The thing controlling it projects life into it. I cut off the signal. So, radio control? Thought control. You all right? Yeah. So... who's controlling it, then? Long story. What's it all for? Shop window dummies, what's that about? Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?! No! Well, no! It's not a price war. They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me? No. But you're still listening. Really, though, Doctor... Tell me. Who are you? Do you know like we were saying? About the Earth revolving? It's like when you're a kid. The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still. ..I can feel it. The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour. The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour. I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me. Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... That's who I am. Now forget me, Rose Tyler. Go home. STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE H... hey, here's my woman! Kit off. Oh, shut up. Coffee? Yeah, only if you wash the mug. I don't mean rinse, I mean wash. Can I use your computer? Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom. Don't read my e-mails! You're not coming in. He's safe, he's got a wife and kids. Who told you that? He did! That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say. Um, hello, I've come to see Clive. We've been e-mailing. Dad! It's one of your nutters. Sorry, hello! You must be Rose. I'm Clive. Obviously. I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me! No, good point! No murders! Who is it? It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website. Please come through, I'm in the shed. She? She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she? This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it. People might intercept. If you know what I mean. If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place. Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories. No first name, no last name, just the Doctor. Always the Doctor. The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance. That's your Doctor there, isn't it? Yeah. I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year. The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original... November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy. See. Must be his father. Going further back... April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend... Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world. On the Titanic. But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived. And here we are... 1883, another Doctor. Look, the same lineage, he's identical... This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded. The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history. When disaster comes, he's there. He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion. Who's that? Death. If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain. We're all in danger. Come on then. If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you. BIN ROARS BIN BURPS But who is he? Who d'you think he is? I think he's the same man. I think he's immortal. I think he's an alien from another world. All right, he's a nutter. Off his head. Complete online conspiracy freak, you win! So, what are we going to do tonight? I fancy a pizza. Pizza! Puh-puh-puh. Pizza! Or Chinese. Pizzaaaaaaaa! Should I try the hospital? Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen. Is that it then, dishing out chips? I could do A-levels. I dunno. It's all Jimmy Stones's fault. I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up. What do you think? So where did you meet this Doctor? Oh, sorry, was I talking about me? I reckon it started at the shop, am I right? Was he something to do with that? No. Come on. Sort of. What was he doing there? I'm not going on about it, really I'm not. Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe. He's dangerous. You can trust me, sweetheart. HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar... You can tell me anything. Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning. I can help you, Rose. That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart. What are you doing that for? Champagne. We didn't order any. Where's the Doctor? Madam, your champagne. It's not ours. Mickey, what is it, what's wrong? I need know out how much he knows, so where is he? Doesn't anybody want this champagne? Look, we didn't order... Ah, gotcha. Don't mind me. I'm just toasting the happy couple. On the house! Anyway! Don't think that's gonna stop me. Everyone, out, now! Get out, get out, get out! Open the gate! Use that tube thing! Sonic screwdriver. Use it! Nah, tell you what, let's go in here. You can't hide in a wooden box! He's gonna get us! Doctor! It's gonna follow us. The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door. Believe me, they've tried! Now, shut up a minute. You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect. I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right. Where d'you want to start? Um... The inside's bigger than the outside. Yes. It's... alien. Yep... Are you alien? Yes. Is that all right? Yeah. It's called the Tardis, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That's OK. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead? Oh, I didn't think of that. He's my boyfriend! You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think? Now you're just gonna let him melt. Melt?! Aw, no, no, no, NO! What are you doing? Following the signal. It's fading! No, no, no, no, no, no, NO! Almost there, almost there... Here we go! You can't go out there. It's not safe! I lost the signal. I got so close. We've moved. Does it fly? It disappears there and reappears here. But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose. Melted with the head. Are you gonna witter on all night? I'll have to tell his mother. Mickey. I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him. Again! You were right. You are alien. If I did forget some kid called Mickey. He's not a kid! ..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right? All right?! Yes, it is! If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north? Lots of planets have a north! ..What's a police public call box? It's a telephone box, from the 1950s. It's a disguise. OK. And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us? Nothing. It loves you. You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect. Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted. So. Earth. Dinner. Any way of stopping it? Antiplastic. Antiplastic? Antiplastic! But first, I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big in a city this small? Hide what? A transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal. What does it look like? A transmitter! Round and massive - in the middle of London. A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible. What? What? What is it? What? Oh. Fantastic! Think. Plastic. Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive. The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables. The breast implants. Still, we've found the transmitter. The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath. What about down here? Looks good to me. The Nestene Consciousness. That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature. Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go. I'm not here to kill it. I've got to give it a chance. I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation. Thank you. If I might have permission to approach. Oh, my God. Mickey! It's me! It's OK. It's all right. Shhh. That thing, down there... The liquid, it can talk! Oh, you're stinking! Doctor, they kept him alive! Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy. You knew that and never said?! Can we keep domestics outside, thank you! Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?! Oh, don't give me that! It's an invasion, plain and simple. Don't talk about constitutional rights. I AM TALKING! This planet is just starting. These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk. They are capable of so much more. I'm asking you, on their behalf. Please, just go. Doctor! That was just insurance! I wasn't gonna use it. I was not attacking you. I'm here to help. I'm not your enemy, I swear. What do you mean? No! Honestly, no... Yes, that's my ship. That's not true! I should know, I was there. I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault. I couldn't save your world. I couldn't save any of them. What's it doing? It's the Tardis. The Nestene's identified it as superior technology. It's terrified! It's going to the final base. It's starting the invasion... Get out, Rose! Just leg it! Mum? Oh, there you are. I was gonna phone. You CAN get compensation. I've got this document thing off the police. Don't thank me! Where are you, Mum? I'm in town. Look, go! Just go home right now. Darling, you're breaking up. I'm just gonna do a bit shopping. I'll see you later, ta-ra. Mum? Mum? It's the activation signal! It's transmitting. It's the end of the world. There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter. My God! I thought they were dummies! I nearly had a heart attack. It's true. Everything I've read. All those stories, it's all true. Get out, Rose! Just get out! RUN! The stairs have gone. I haven't got a key... We're gonna die! Leave him! There's nothing you can do! I've got no A-levels, no job. No future. But I'll tell you what I have got. Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team. I got the bronze! Rose! Now we're in trouble! Rose, don't go out of the house! 'Lt's not safe. There are these things, they were shooting and... ' Hello? Fat lot of good you were! Nestene Consciousness? Easy! You were useless! You'd be dead if it wasn't for me. Yes, I would. ..Thank you. Right, then! I'll be off. Unless... I dunno. You could come with me. This box isn't just a London hopper, you know. It goes anywhere in the universe. Free of charge. Don't! He's an alien, he's a thing. He's not invited. What d'you think? You could... stay here. Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere. Is it always this dangerous? Yeah. Yeah... I can't. I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump. So... OK. See you around. Come on, let's go. By the way, did I mention it also travels in time? Thanks. Thanks for what? Exactly. This is the year five billion, and this is the day... Hold on... Welcome to the end of the world. Who the hell are you? Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler. She's my plus one, is that all right? Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien. Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
