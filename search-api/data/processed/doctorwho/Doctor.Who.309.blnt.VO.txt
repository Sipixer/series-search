we wait for them to die. I must stop being a Time Lord and become human. Chameleon arch, rewrites my biology. Journal of impossible things, such imagination. It's become quite a hobby! He's different from any man you've ever met, right? Yes. He had to go and fall in love with a human and it wasn't me. If they find us, Martha, open the watch. Sometimes I say things, they turn out to be correct. Arghhh! They found us. Oh, my God, where's the watch. What are you talking about? This is not you, this is 1913. Change back! Arghh! We need a Time Lord. Which one of them do you want us to kill? Doesn't this scare you enough to change back? Your friend or your lover? Make your decision, Mr Smith. Perhaps if that human heart breaks, the Time Lord will emerge. Time Lord... TICKING All right! One more move and I shoot. Oh, the maid is full of fire! And you can shut up! Careful, Son of Mine. This is all for you, so that you can live forever. Shoot you down. Try it. We'll die together. Would you really pull the trigger? You look too scared. Scared and holding a gun's a good combination! Want to risk it? Doctor, get everyone out, there's a door at the side, it's over there, go on, Do it. Mr Smith, I mean you! Do what she said. Everybody out! Now! Don't argue, Mr Jackson, they're mad, that's all we need to know. Susan, Miss Cooper, outside, all of you! THEY SCREAM Back to the school, quickly. And you, go on, just shift. What about you? Mr Smith, I think you should escort your lady friend to safety, don't you? Get everyone out!... Latimer, get back to the school, tell the Headmaster... Don't touch me! You're as bad as them! Don't try anything! I'm warning you, or Sonny Boy gets it. She's almost brave, this one. I should have taken her form. Much more fun. So much spirit. What happened to jenny? Is she gone? She is consumed. Her body's mine. You mean she's dead? Yes! And she went with precious little dignity. All that "aah!" - screaming! Get the gun! Good work. Don't just stand there! Move! God, you're rubbish as a human, come on! PEOPLE SCREAMING EXPLOSIONS Run! Oh, this is super! We've been hiding for too long, this is sport! I can smell the schoolteacher, he's gone back to his academy. And what do we know about her? This body has traces of memory. Was once her friend. Martha would go walking to the west. Husband of Mine, follow the maid's scent, go to the west. Find out what she was keeping secret. Soldiers! As for you, Mother of Mine... ...let's go to school. RINGS BELL What are you doing?! Maybe I can't fight them. But this school teaches us to stand together! Take arms! You can't do that. You want me to fight, don't you? Take arms! Take arms! Take arms! I say, sir! What's the matter? Enemy at the door, Hutchinson! Enemy at the door! Take arms! They're sounding the alarms! I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of Mine. These bodies can damage and die, that's why we need the Time Lord. Indeed, they will have guns. Perhaps a little caution. Sister of Mine. You're such a small little thing. Find a way in and spy on them. We can't do this, Doctor! Mr Smith? Redford, maintain position, faster now. They're boys! They don't stand a chance. They are cadets, trained to defend the King and all properties. What in thunder's name is this?! Before I devise an excellent and endless series of punishments for each and every one of you, could someone explain, very simply, and immediately, exactly is going on? Headmaster, I have to report the school is under attack. Really? Is that so? Perhaps we should have a word in private. Sir, I was in the village, with Matron. It's Baines, sir, Jeremy Baines, and Mr Clark, from Oakham Farm, they've gone mad, sir, they've got guns. They've already murdered people in the village, I saw it happen. Matron? Is that so? I'm afraid it's true, sir. Murder? On our own soil? I saw it, yes. Perhaps you did well then, Mr Smith. What makes you think the danger's coming here? Well... they said, uh... Baines threatened Mr Smith, sir. Said he'd follow him. We don't know why. Very well. You boys, remain on guard. Mr Snell, telephone for the police. Mr Phillips, with me. We shall investigate. But it's not safe out there. Mr Smith, it seems your favourite servant is giving me advice. You will control her, sir. Gotta find that watch. 'Hold me, keep me safe, keep me dark. 'And keep me closed - the time is not right. 'Not yet, not while The Family is abroad. 'Danger.' So... Baines and one of the cleaning staff, there's always a woman involved. Am I to gather that some practical joke has got out of hand? Headmaster, sir! Good evening, sir! Come to give me a caning, sir, would you like that, sir? Keep a civil tongue. Come on, everyone, I suspect alcohol's played its part in this. Let’s just calm down. And who are these friends of yours, Baines? In fancy dress? D'you like them, Mr Phillips? Look. S'called molecular fringe animation! Fashioned in the shape of straw men. My own private army! S'ever so good, sir! Baines, step apart and come inside with me. No sir, you sir, YOU will send us Mr john Smith. That's all we want, sir, Mr john Smith and whatever he's done with his Time Lord consciousness, then we'll be very happy to leave you alone. You speak with someone else's voice, Baines. Who might that be? We are the Family of Blood. Mr Smith said there had been deaths. Yes, sir! And they were good, sir! Well, I warn you. The school is armed. All your little tin soldiers! But tell me, sir... will they thank you? I don't understand. What do you know of history, sir? What d'you know of next year? You're not making sense. 1914, sir. Because the Family has travelled far and wide, looking for Mr Smith, and oh, the things we have seen. War is coming. In foreign fields. War of the whole wide world, with all your boys falling down in the mud. Do you think they will thank the man who taught them it was glorious? Don't you forget, boy. I've been a soldier. I was in South Africa. I used my dead mates for sandbags. I fought with the butt of my rifle when the bullets ran out, and I would go back there tomorrow for King and Country. Etcetera... etcetera. HE SCREAMS Run along, Headmaster. Run back to school. And send us Mr Smith! LAUGHTER Mr Phillips has been murdered, Mr Smith. Can you tell me why? Honestly, sir, I have no idea. And the telephone line's been disconnected. We're on our own. If we have to make a fight of it, then make a fight we shall. Hutchinson! We'll build a barricade within the courtyards! Fortify the entrances! Build defences! Gentlemen, in the name of the King, we shall stand against them! Yes, sir! Barricade the kitchens, secure the passageway to the stables. You little coward. You'll do your duty, Latimer. With the rest of us! Sandbags to the north and west! Williams, you take charge! Quickly now... Pemberton, load the spare magazines with bullets! Take the magazine cut-off out! They've got an army... ...So do we. Soldiers! SOLDIERS! Ashington, we need water for the Vickers Gun, see to it! Faster, all of you! Faster. Lockley, when firing commences, you're in charge of the gathering. Peterson, that's not acceptable, report to your senior officer. War comes to England, a year in advance. 'Family of Mine, wait. 'Hold the soldiers back. The Time Lord is playing some sort of trick.' 'Discover him, Sister of Mine.' I know it sounds mad! But when the Doctor became human, he took the alien part of himself, and stored it inside the watch. It's not a watch, it just looks like a watch. And "alien" means? Not from abroad, I take it? The man you call john Smith. He was born on another world. A different species? Yeah. Then tell me. In this fairy tale... who are you? Just a friend, I'm not... I mean, you haven't got a rival! As much as I might... just his friend. And... human, I take it? Human, don't worry! And, I don't just follow him around, I'm training to be a doctor... Not an alien doctor, a proper doctor, a doctor of medicine. Well, that is nonsense. Women might train to be doctors, but hardly the skivvy. And hardly one of your colour. Oh, d'you think? Bones of the hand. Carpal bones, proximal row, scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, distal row, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate, then the metacarpal bones, extending in three distinct phalanges, proximal, middle, distal. You read that in a book. Yes! To pass my exams! Can't you see? This is true. I must go. If we find that watch, then we can stop them. Those boys are going to fight. I might not be a doctor, but I'm still their nurse. They need me. Son of Mine, Wife of Mine. 'Father of Mine, what have you found?' His Tardis! The Doctor can't escape. You're with Armitage and Thwaites, they know the drill. Joan, it's not safe. I'm doing my duty, just as much as you. Fine evening we've had together. Not quite as planned. Tell me about Nottingham. I'm sorry? That's where you were brought up. Tell me about it. Well... It lies on the River Leen, with its southern boundary following the course of the River Trent, which flows from Stoke to the Humber. That sounds like an encyclopaedia. Where did you live? Broadmarsh Street. Adjacent to Hockley Terrace, in the district of Radford Parade. But more than facts. When you were a child, where did you play? All those secret little places, the dens and hideaways that only a child knows. Tell me, john, please tell me. How can you think I'm not real? When I kissed you, was that a lie? No, it wasn't, no. But this Doctor, sounds like some, some romantic lost prince. Would you rather that? Am I not enough? No, that's not true. Never. I've got to go. Martha was right about one thing, though. Those boys, they're children. John Smith wouldn't want them to fight, never mind the Doctor, the john Smith I was getting to know. He knows it's wrong. Doesn't he? Mr Smith, if you please. What choice do I have? Get those bags piled up, filth, they'll be the difference between life and death for us! Not for you and me. What are you babbling about? We go to battle together. We fight alongside. I've seen it. But not here, not now. What's that supposed to mean? It means that you and I both survive this. And maybe I was given this watch... so I could help. I'm sorry. Latimer! You filthy coward! Yes, sir. Every time. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? 'Beware. ' Beware of what? 'Her.' Keep away. Who are you? I saw you at the dance. You were with that family, you're one of them. What are you hiding? Nothing. What have you got there? Nothing. Show me, little boy. I reckon whatever you are, you're still in the shape of a girl. How strong is she, d'you think? Does she really want to see this?! Time Lord! Inside the device! Everything he is. Concealed away. In the hands of a schoolboy. But now we know. That's all we need to find - the boy, and the watch. What are we waiting for?! Attaaaaack! Stand to! THUDDING AND CRASHING At post! Enemy approaching, sir. Steady. Find the biting point... PANICKED BREATHING CRASHING Fire! LOUD GUNFIRE RAT-A-TAT OF MACHINE GUN CHOIR SINGS Cease fire! Just straw. Like he said. Straw. Then no-one's dead, sir. We killed no-one. Stand to! You child, come out of the way. Come into the school, we don't know who's out there. It's the Cartwright girl, isn't it? Come here, come to me. Mr Rocastle, please. Don't go near her. You were told to be quiet. Just listen to me. She's part of it. Matron, tell him. I don't know, I think you should stay back, Headmaster. Mr Smith... She was... She was with Baines, in the village. Mr Smith, I've seen many strange sights this night. But there is no cause on God's Earth that would allow me to see this child in the field of battle, sir. Come with me. You're funny. That's right. Now take my hand. So funny. HE SCREAMS Now who's going to shoot me? Any of you? Really? Put down your guns. But, sir. The Headmaster... I'll not see this happen. Not any more. You will retreat. In an orderly fashion. Back through the school. Hutchinson, lead the way. But sir... I said, lead the way. Well, go on then, run! Soldiers! Come on! Reanimate! PANICKED SHOUTING Out you go, quick as you can. Don't go to the village, it's not safe. And you, ladies. Not till we've got the boys out. One of these boys has got the watch. This one? No. This one? No. This one? No. Get off me! I said get off! This one, is that him? No. Right, then we can kill this lot. 'Lord of time.' That's him! Upstairs. Don't just stand there. Outside, come on, out! I insist, the pair of you, just go. If there are any more boys inside, I'll find them. I think... retreat! Doctor! Doc-taaaar! Come back, Doctor! Come home! Come and claim your prize! Out you come, Doctor! There's a good boy! Come to the family! Time to end it, now! You recognise it, don't you? Come out, Doctor! Come to us. I've never seen it in my life. Do you remember its name? I'm sorry, john, but you wrote about it. The blue box, you dreamt of a blue box. I'm not... I'm john Smith. That's all I want to be. John Smith. With his life. And his job. And his love. Why can't I be john Smith? Isn't he a good man? Yes, yes, he is. Why can't I stay? But we need the Doctor. And who am I, then? Nothing? I'm just a story? One more phase, and we won't have to hunt. The Doctor, Mr Smith, the boy, the watch - they will come to us! Soldiers, guard this thing! This way! I think I know somewhere we can hide. We've got to keep going. Just listen to me for once, john, follow me! Power up! Fully armed and ready. Mother and Father and Sister of Mine, prepare the armaments. I doubt that England is ready for this. Fix targets. And counting down. Here we are. It should be empty. Oh, it's a long time since I've run that far! - But who lives here? - If I'm right... no-one. Hello? No-one home. We should be safe here. Whose house is it, though? The Cartwright’s', that little girl at the school, she's Lucy Cartwright. Or she's taken Lucy Cartwright's form. If she came home this afternoon, and if the parents How easily I accept these ideas. I must go to them. Before anyone else dies. You can't! Martha, there must be something we can do. Not without the watch. You're this Doctor's companion, can't you help?! What exactly d'you do for him? Why does he need you? Because he's lonely. And that's what you want me to become? KNOCK ON DOOR What if it's them? I'm not an expert, but I don't think scarecrows knock. I brought you this. Hold it. I won't. Please. Just hold it. It told me to find you, it wants to be held. You've had this watch all this time, why didn't you return it? Because it was waiting, then because I was so scared. Of the Doctor. Why? Because... I've seen him. He's like fire. And ice. And rage. He's like the night and the storm and the heart of the sun. Stop it. He's ancient and forever. He burns at the centre of time, and he can see the turn of the universe. Stop it, I said stop it. And he's wonderful. I've still got this - the journal. Those are just stories. Now we know that's not true. Perhaps there's something in here. LOUD EXPLOSION What the hell? This'll flush him out. This'll do it. Super, super fun! They're destroying the village. The watch. John, don't. Can you hear it? FAINT VOICE MURMURS Like he's asleep. Waiting to waken. Why did he speak to me? Oh, low level telepathic field, you were born with it, just an extra synaptic engram, causing... Is that how he talks? That's him. All you have to do is open it, and he's back. You knew this. And yet you watched, while Miss Redfern and I... I didn't know how to stop you. He gave me a list of things to watch out for, but that wasn't included! Falling in love. That didn't even occur to him? No. Then what sort of man is that? And now you expect me to die? It was always gonna end. The Doctor said, the Family's got a limited lifespan, that's why they need to consume a Time Lord. Otherwise, three months, and they die. Like mayflies, he said. So your job was to execute me. People are dying out there! They need him. And I need him. Cos you've got no idea what he's like. I've only just met him. It wasn't even that long ago, but... He is everything. He’s just everything to me, and he doesn't even look at me but I don't care, cos I love him to bits, and I hope to God he won't remember me saying this. LOUDER EXPLOSION It's getting closer. I should have thought of it before! I can give them this! Just the watch! Then they can leave and I can stay as I am! You can't do that! If they want the Doctor, they can have him! He'll never let you do it. If they get what they want, then... Then it all ends in destruction. I never read to the end. Those creatures would live forever. To breed and conquer. War, across the stars. For every child. Martha. Timothy. Could you leave us alone, please? SHELLS WHISTLE OVERHEAD If I could do this instead of you, then I would. But my hopes aren't important. He won't love you. If he's not you, then I don't want him to. I had one husband and he died, and I never thought, ever again... And then you... You were so... And it was real, I wasn't. I really thought... Let me see. Blasted thing. Blasted, blasted thing. I can't even hear it. Says nothing to me. BABY CRIES LAUGHTER They're all safe, aren't they? The children. The grandchildren. Everyone's safe? Everyone's safe. And they all send their love, john. Well, then. It's done. Thank you. Did you see? The Time Lord has such adventures. But he could never have a life like that. And yet I could. What are you going to do? We'll blast them into dust, then fuse the dust into glass, then shatter them all over again. FOOTSTEPS just... PINGING NOISES just stop the bombardment, That's all I ask. I'll do anything you want, just stop. Say please. Please. Wait a minute... Still human. I can't pretend to understand, not for a second. But I want you to know, I'm innocent in all this. He made me john Smith, it's not like I had any control over it. He didn't just make himself human, he made himself an idiot. Same thing, isn't it? I don't care about this Doctor, and your Family, I just want you to go. So I've made my choice. You can have him, just take it, please, take him away. At last. Don't think that's saved your life. Family of Mine. Now we shall have the lives of a Time Lord. It's empty. Where's he gone? You tell me. Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection. A little bit like ventriloquism of the nose. It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. And it's got to be said, I don't like the look of that hydrokinometer. It seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all the way through the retro-stabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters. Cos if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't have let me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you one word of advice. Run. Get out! Get out!

That ordinary man... ...you chose to change, he chose to die. Come with me. I'm sorry? Travel with me. As what? My companion. Oh, but that's not fair. What must I look like to you, Doctor? I must seem so very small. No. We could start again. I'd like that. You and me, we could try, at least. Cos everything that john Smith is and was, I can't. Please come with me. I can't. Why not? John Smith is dead. And you look like him. But he's here. Inside. If you look in my eyes. Answer me this. Just one question, that's all. If the Doctor had never visited us, if... he'd never chosen this place, on a whim... Would anyone here have died? (You can go.) Right then. Molto bene! How was she? Time we moved on. If you want, I could go and... Time we moved on. Um. Meant to say. Back there, last night, I would've said anything to get you to change. Yeah, course you would. I wasn't really... No! No, no. Good! Fine! So there we are, then. There we are then, yes. And I never said. Thanks for looking after me. Doctor! Martha! Tim, Timothy, Tim!

But you could get hurt. Well, so could you, travelling around with him. But it's not going to stop you! Tim. I'd be honoured if you'd take this. I can't hear anything. No, it’s just a watch, now.
