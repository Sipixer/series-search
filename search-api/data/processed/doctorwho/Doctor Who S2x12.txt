I dunno. 00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,427  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523 It feels weird. The Sphere has that effect on everyone. 00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,063  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523 Makes you want to run and hide. 00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:20,181  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523 Like it's forbidden. 00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:23,178  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523 We've tried analysing it, using every device imaginable. 00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:26,813  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523 But according to our instruments, the Sphere doesn't exist. 00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:29,369  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523 It weighs nothing. It doesn't age. 00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,486  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523 No heat, no radiation 00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,084  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523 and has no atomic mass. 00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,001  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523 But I can see it. 00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,598  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523 Fascinating, isn't it? It upsets people, because it gives off nothing. 00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,796  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523 It is absent. 00:24:42,836 --> 00:24:44,954  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523 Well, Doctor? 00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:46,717  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523 This is a Void Ship. 00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,508  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523 And what is that? 00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,545  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523 Well, it's impossible, for starters. 00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,624  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523 I always thought it was just a theory, but... 00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:59,779  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523 It's a vessel designed to exist outside time and space. 00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,590  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523 Travelling through the Void. 00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:07,088  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523 And what's the Void? 00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:12,164  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523 The space between dimensions. There's all sorts of realities around us, different dimensions, 00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:17,678  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523 billions of parallel universes, all stacked up against each other. The Void is the space in between. 00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:20,075  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523 Containing absolutely nothing. 00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,273  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523 Can you imagine that?

The Big Bang... 00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:53,041  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523 the end of the universe, start of the next, wouldn't even touch the sides. 00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,478  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523 You'd exist outside the whole of creation. 00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:58,320  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523 You see, we were right.

We don't. 00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:06,189  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523 We send it back into hell. How did it get here in the first place? 00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,747  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523 The Sphere came through, into this world. 00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:11,489  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523 And the ghosts followed in its wake.

What am I supposed to be looking for? 00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,494  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523 Just go to the left. 00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,479  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523 Yvonne's gonna be back any minute. 00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:35,960  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523 Just go to the left. 00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:39,666  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523 What d'you mean, in here? 00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,568  X1:078 X2:285 Y1:488 Y2:523 MATT SCREAMS 00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:57,192  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523 The Sphere came through here - 00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:59,365  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523 a hole in the world. 00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:05,981  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523 Not active at the moment. But when we fire particle engines at that exact spot, the breach opens up. 00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:11,053  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523 How did you even find it? We'd been getting warning signs for years, a radar black spot. 00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:13,650  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523 So we built this place, the Torchwood Tower. 00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,048  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523 The breach was 600ft above sea level, it was the only way to reach it. 00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:21,565  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523 You built a skyscraper? Just to reach a spatial disturbance? How much money have you got? 00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,078  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523 Enough. 00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,475  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523 Hold on a minute. We're in Canary Wharf. Must be. 00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:32,393  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523 This building, it's Canary Wharf! 00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,270  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523 That is the public name for it. 00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,866  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523 To those in the know, it's Torchwood. So you find the breach. Probe it. 00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:40,424  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523 The Sphere comes through, 600ft above London, bam! 00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:45,975  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523 It leaves a hole in the fabric of reality, and that hole, you think, ooh, shall we leave it alone? 00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:50,091  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523 Shall we back off? Shall we play it safe? No, you think, let's make it bigger! 00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:52,129  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523 It's a massive source of energy. 00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,045  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523 If we can harness that power, we need never depend on the Middle East again. 00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,523  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523 Britain will become truly independent. 00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:01,919  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523 But you can see for yourself. The next Ghost Shift's in two minutes. 00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:06,075  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523 Cancel it. I don't think so. I'm warning you. Cancel it. 00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:08,114  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523 Exactly as the legends would have it! 00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:11,592  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523 The Doctor, assuming alien authority over the rights of Man. 00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:15,153  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523 Let me show you. Sphere comes through. 00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:22,500  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:344 Y2:415 But when it made the hole, it cracked the world around it. 00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,016  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:344 Y2:415 The entire surface of this dimension, splintered. 00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:29,250  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523 And that's how the ghosts get through, they're bleeding through the fault lines. 00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,568  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523 Walking from their world, across the Void, and into yours. 00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:38,996  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523 With the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along. But too many ghosts, and... 00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,996  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523 Well, in that case, we'll have to be more careful. 00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,433  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523 Positions! Ghost Shift in one minute. 00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,190  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523 Miss Hartman, please don't do it. 00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,190  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523 We have done this a thousand times. 00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,147  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523 Then stop, at a thousand. We're in control of the ghosts. 00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:58,197  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523 The levers can open the breach, but, equally, they can close it. 00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:01,935  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523 OK! 00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:06,050  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523 Sorry? Never mind! As you were. What, is that it? 00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,529  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523 No, fair enough, I've said my bit, don't mind me! 00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,286  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523 Any chance of a cup of tea? 00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,803  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523 Ghost Shift in 20 seconds. 00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,564  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523 Can't wait to see it! You can't stop us, Doctor. 00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:18,837  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523 Absolutely not. Pull up a chair, Rose. Come and watch the fireworks. 00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:21,438  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523 Ghost Shift in ten seconds. 00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:25,312  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523 Nine, eight, seven, 00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:30,749  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523 six, five, four, three, two... 00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,196  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523 Stop the Shift. I said stop! 00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,297  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523 Thank you. I suppose it makes sense 00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,457  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523 to get as much intelligence as possible. 00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:43,051  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:452 Y2:523 But the programme will recommence, as soon as you've explained everything. 00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,647  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523 I'm glad to be of help. And someone clear up this glass. 00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:50,014  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523 They did warn me, Doctor. They said you liked to make a mess. 00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,095  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523 Come on. 00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,976  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523 Can I help you?

Sorry, um... 00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,410  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523 They sent me from personnel. 00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,884  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523 They said some man had been taken prisoner, some sort of Doctor. 00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:44,364  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523 I'm just checking the lines of communication. 00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:47,959  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523 Did they tell you anything?

I ordered you to stop. 00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:18,426  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523 Who's doing that? Right, step away from your monitors, everyone. 00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:22,112  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523 Gareth? Adi?

I haven't got time for this! 00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:28,950  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523 What are these earpieces? Don't. How does it control them?

Can't you stop it? 00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:44,452  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523 They're still controlling it, they've hijacked the system. Who's "they"? 00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:48,686  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523 Might be a remote transmitter, but it's got to be close by. I can trace it! Jackie, stay here. 00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,598  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523 Keep those levers down!
