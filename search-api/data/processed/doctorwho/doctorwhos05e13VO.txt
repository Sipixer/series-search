It was built to contain the most feared thing in all the universe.</i> Anything that powerful, I'd know about it.</i> Why don't I know? Everything that ever hated you is coming here tonight.</i> They're all here, all of them. All for you. What could you possibly be?</i> If something can be remembered, it can come back.</i> Hello, Amy. But you died. How can you be here? - What's your name? - Rory. - How can she not remember me? - 'Cos you never existed. Who are those Romans? They're not real. <i>They can't be. They're all in a book in Amy's house.</i> It's a trap. It has to be. Plastic Romans. Duplicates! Listen to me, you have to run. I'm a thing.</i> I'll kill you. Just go! There's something wrong with the TARDIS. Something is controlling it.</i> 26 June 2010. A scenario was devised from the memories of your companion. Rory Williams from Leadworth. My boyfriend. How could I ever forget you? The cracks in time are the work of The Doctor.</i> The Pandorica is ready. Ready for what? Ready for you. Every sun will supernova at every moment in history. The whole universe will never have existed! Listen to me! Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.</i> It's Easter now, so I hope I don't wake you,</i> but, honest, it is an emergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just an ordinary crack, but I know it's not, cos at night, there's voices. So, please, please, could you send someone to fix it. Or a policeman. Or... Back in a moment. It's a lovely painting, Amelia. And what are all these? Stars. Oh, Amelia! Tell you what, shall we go outside? What do you see, Amelia? The moon. And what else? Just the dark. But no stars. If there were stars up there, we'd be able to see them, wouldn't we? Amelia, look at me. You know this is all just a story, don't you? You know there's no such thing as stars. It's quite common, actually. Throughout history, people have talked about stars in the sky.</i> God knows where it comes from. I just don't want her growing up and joining one of those Star Cults.</i> I don't trust that Richard Dawkins. Come on, Aunt Sharon. - Look at that! That's good, isn't it? - Not that! This way. - But we're not looking at anything. - This way! Amelia Pond, please go to the reception, please.</i> Your aunt is waiting for you there. Sorry. OK, kid. This is where it gets complicated. U-Sub.net et la Allons-y Team présentent Doctor Who - saison 5 THE BIG BANG - FINAL Transcript : Red Bee Media Ltd Synchro : Dauphinus, Delphiki, Imaginos et Jojo Traduction : Akiha, Citrøn, Delphiki, Imaginos Relecture : Arno, Citrøn, Imaginos, Killarney So the universe ended. You missed that. In 102 AD. I suppose this means you and I never get born at all. Twice, in my case. You would have laughed at that. Please laugh! The Doctor said the universe was huge and ridiculous, and sometimes there were miracles. I could do with a ridiculous miracle about now. Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end of the world. Well, it is. Actually, it's the end of the universe. Oh, no. Hang on! You need to get me out of the Pandorica. You're not in the Pandorica. Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then. Well, back now from your point of view, which is back then from my point of view. Time travel, can't keep it straight in your head. It's easy to open from the outside - just point and press. Now go. Oh, when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket. Good luck! What do you mean? Done what? How did you do that? You gave me this. - No, I didn't. - You did. Look at it. Temporal energy. Same screwdriver, at different points in its own time stream. Which means it was me who gave it to you. Me from the future. I've got a future, that's nice. That's not. Yeah. What are they? History has collapsed. Whole races have been deleted from existence. These are just like after-images. Echoes, fossils in time. The footprints of the never-were. Er, what does that mean? Total event collapse. The universe literally never happened. So, how can we be here? What's keeping us safe? Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all. We're just the last light to go out. Where's Amy? I killed her. Oh, Rory! What am I? You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump of plastic with delusions of humanity. But I'm Rory now. Whatever was happening, it's stopped. I'm Rory! That's software talking. Can you help her? Is there anything you can do? Probably, if I had the time. The time?! All of creation has just been wiped from the sky. Do you know how many lives now never happened? All the people who never lived? Your girlfriend isn't more important than the whole universe. She is to me! Welcome back, Rory Williams! Sorry, had to be sure. Hell of a gun-arm you're packing there. Right, we need to get her downstairs. And take that look off your plastic face. You're getting married in the morning! - So you've got a plan, then? - Bit of a plan, yeah. Memories are more powerful than you think, and Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl. Grew up with a time crack in her wall. The universe pouring through her dreams every night. The Nestenes took a memory print of her and got more than they bargained for. Like you. Not just your face, but your heart and your soul. I'm leaving her a message, so she knows what's happening. - What are you doing? - Saving her. This is the ultimate prison. You can't even escape by dying. It forces you to stay alive. But she's already dead. Mostly dead. The Pandorica can stasis-lock her that way. All it needs is a scan of her living DNA and it'll restore her. - Where's it going to get that? - In about 2,000 years. Are you all right? Who are you? I'm... fine. I'm supposed to... rest. Got to rest, the Doctor says. What doctor? He's in here. Left a message in my head like I'm an answerphone. Where am I? Hang on, national museum, right? I was here once when I was a little... Yeah, complicated. Let's see, it's what... 1996? Who are you? It's a long story. A very long story. She's going to be in that box for 2,000 years?! Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut. River's vortex manipulator. Rubbish way to time travel, but the universe is tiny now. We'll be fine. So the future's still there, then? Our world? A version of it. Not quite the one you know. Earth alone in the sky. Let's go and have a look. You put your hand there. Don't worry, should be safe. That's not what I'm worried about. She'll be fine. Nothing can get into this box. - You got in there. - There's only one of me. I counted. This box needs a guard. I killed the last one. - Don't even think about it. - She'll be alone. - She won't feel it. - You bet she won't! 2,000 years. You won't even sleep, you'd be conscious every second. It would drive you... mad. Will she be safer if I stay? Look me in the eye and tell me she wouldn't be safer. Answer me! Yes. Obviously. Then how could I leave her? Why do you have to be so... human? Because right now, I'm not. Listen to me. This is the last bit of advice you're going to get in a very long time. You're living plastic, but not immortal. I have no idea how long you'll last. And you're not indestructible. Stay away from heat and radio signals. You can't heal, or repair yourself. Any damages are permanent. So, for God's sake, however bored you get, stay out of... According to legend, wherever the Pandorica was taken, throughout its long history,</i> the Centurion would be there, guarding it.</i> He appears as an iconic image in the artwork of many cultures,</i> and there are several documented accounts of his appearances</i> and his warnings to the many who attempted to open he box before its time.</i> His last recorded appearance was during the London blitz in 1941. The warehouse where the Pandorica was stored</i> was destroyed by incendiary bombs, but the box itself was found the next morning, a safe distance from the blaze.</i> There are eyewitness accounts from the night of the fire</i> of a figure in Roman dress, carrying the box</i> from the flames. Since then, there have been no sightings of the Lone Centurion,</i> and many have speculated that if he ever existed, he perished in the fires of that night,</i> performing one last act of devotion to the box he had pledged to protect for nearly 2,000 years. Rory... Exterminate! What's that? ... of trouble. Two of you? Complicated. Exterminate! Weapons systems restoring. Come along, Ponds. Exterminate! What are we doing? Running into a dead end, where I'll have a brilliant plan, that involves not being in one. What's going on? Get out of here. Go! Just run! - <i>Drop the device!</i> - It's not a weapon. Scan it. It's not a weapon, and you don't have the power to waste! Scans indicate intruder unarmed. Do you think? Vision impaired! Vision... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. - It just happened. - Shut up. Yeah, shut up, cos we've got to go. Come on! I waited. 2,000 years, I waited for you. No, still shut up. And break! And breathe! Well, somebody didn't get out much for 2,000 years. I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink? It's all mouths today, isn't it? The light! The light from the Pandorica, it must have hit the Dalek. Out, out, out! 2,000 years. How did you do? Kept out of trouble. How? Unsuccessfully. The mop! That's how you looked all those years ago when you gave me the sonic. No time to lose then. Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end of the world. Oops, sorry. How can he do that? Is he magic? You need to get me out of the Pandorica. - You're not in there. - Yes, I am. I'm not now. But I was back then. Right, let's go then. Wait! Now I don't have the sonic, I just gave it Rory 2,000 years ago. And when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket. Right then. Off we go! No, hang on, hang on. How did you know... to come here? My handwriting. There you go, drink up! What is that? How are you doing that? Vortex manipulator, cheap and nasty time travel. Very bad for you. I'm trying to give it up. - Where are we going? - The roof. Doctor, it's you. How can it be you? Doctor, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Me from the future. Are you... I mean, is he... Is he dead? What? Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead. Right, I've got 12 minutes, that's good. 12 minutes to live? How is that good? You can do loads in 12 minutes, suck a mint, buy a sledge, have a fast bath. The roof! - We can't leave you here, dead. - Oh, good! Are you in charge now? So, tell me, what are we going to do about Amelia? Where did she go? There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History is still collapsing. - How can I be here, if she's not? - You're an anomaly. We all are. We're hanging on at the eye of the storm, but the eye is closing, and if we don't do something, reality will never have happened. Today, just dying is a result. Now, come on! He won't die. Time can be rewritten. He'll find a way. I know he will. Move it. Come on! Restore! What, it's morning already? How did that happen? History is shrinking. Is anybody listening to me? Universe is collapsing. - We don't have much time left. - What are you doing? - Looking for the TARDIS. - But the TARDIS exploded. Then I'm looking for an exploding TARDIS. I don't understand. The TARDIS blew up and took the universe with it. Why would it do that? How? Good question for another day. But for now... total event collapse means that every star in the universe never happened. Not one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that ever were are gone, then what... is that? Like I said, I'm looking for an exploding TARDIS. - But that's the sun. - Is it? Here's the noise that sun is making right now. That's my TARDIS burning up. That's what's been keeping the Earth warm. Doctor, there's something else. There's a voice. - I can't hear anything. - Trust the plastic. I'm sorry, my love. Doctor, that's River. How can she be up there? - It must be a recording or something. - No, it's not. Emergency protocols, the TARDIS has sealed off the control room and put her into a time loop to save her. She is right - at the heart of the explosion. - <i>I'm sorry, my love.</i> I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. Hi, honey. I'm home. And what sort of time do you call this? - And the plastic Centurion? - It's OK, he's on our side. Really? I dated a Nestene duplicate once, swappable head, it did keep things fresh. Right then, I have questions. But number one is this, what in the name of sanity have you got on your head? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Exterminate! Run, move. Go! Come on! Doctor, come on. It's moving away, finding another way in. It needs to restore its power before it can attack again. Now, that means we've got exactly four and a half minutes - before it's at lethal capacity. - How do you know? Because that's when it's due to kill me. - Kill you? What do you mean, kill you? - Sshut up, never mind. How can that Dalek even exist? It was erased from time and then it came back. How? You said the light from the Pandorica... It's not a light, it's a restoration field, but never mind. Call it a light. That light brought Amy back, but how could it bring back a Dalek when the Daleks have never existed? OK, tell us. When the Tardis blew up, it caused a total event collapse. A time explosion. It blasted every atom in every moment of the universe. Except... Except inside the Pandorica. The perfect prison. Inside it, perfectly preserved, a few billion atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you could extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them, like cloning a body from a single cell. And we've got the bumper family pack. No, too fast, I'm not getting it. The box contains a memory of the universe, and the light transmits the memory. - And that's how we're going to do it. - Do what? Relight the fire. Reboot the universe. Come on! Doctor, you're being completely ridiculous. The Pandorica partially restored one Dalek. If it can't even reboot a single life form properly, how will it reboot the whole of reality? What if we give it a moment of infinite power? Transmit the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space and time simultaneously? That would be lovely, dear, but we can't, because it's completely impossible. No, you see, it's not. It's almost completely impossible. - One spark is all we need. - For what? Big Bang Two! Now listen... - <i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i> - Get back. River, get back now! Exterminate! Doctor, it's me, River. Can you hear me? What is it? What do you need? Where did he go? - Damn it, he could be anywhere. - He went downstairs. - 12 minutes ago. - Show me! He died. Systems restoring! You will be exterminated! We've got to move. That thing's coming back to life. You go to the Doctor. I'll be right with you. You will be exterminated! Not yet, your systems are still restoring. Which means your shield density is compromised. One Alpha Mezon burst through your eyestalk would kill you stone dead. Records indicate you will show mercy.</i> You are an associate of the Doctor's.</i> I'm River Song. Check your records again. Mercy! - Say it again. - <i>Mercy!</i> One more time. Mercy! How could he have moved? He was dead! But he was dead! Who told you that? - He did. - Rule one. The Doctor lies. - Where's the Dalek? - It died. Why did he tell us he was dead? We were a diversion. Long as the Dalek was chasing us, he could work down here. Can you hear me? What were you doing? - What's happening? - Reality's collapsing. It's speeding up. Look at this room. - Where did everything go? - History is being erased. Time is running out. Doctor, what were you doing? Tell us! Big... Bang... Two. The Big Bang. That's the beginning of the universe, right? What, and Big Bang Two is the bang that brings it back? Is that what you mean? What? The Tardis is still burning. It's exploding at every point in history. If you threw the Pandorica into the explosion, - right into the heart of the fire... - Then what? Then let there be light. The light from the Pandorica would explode everywhere at once, - just like he said. - That would work? That would bring everything back? A restoration field, powered by an exploding Tardis, happening at every moment in history. That's brilliant. It might even work! He's wired the vortex manipulator to the rest of the box. Why? So he can take it with him. He's going to fly the Pandorica into the heart of the explosion. - Are you OK? - Are you? Shut up then! Amy... He wants to talk to you. So, what happens here? Big Bang Two? What happens to us? We all wake up where we ought to be. None of this ever happens and we don't remember it. Tell me he comes back, too. The Doctor will be the heart of the explosion. So all the cracks in time will close, but he'll be on the wrong side, trapped in the never-space, the void between the worlds. All memory of him will be purged from the universe. He will never have been born. Now, please. He wants to talk to you before he goes. Not to you? He doesn't really know me yet. Now he never will. Hi. The girl who waited. All night in your garden. - Was it worth it? - Shut up. Of course it was. You asked me why I was taking you with me and I said... "No reason." - I was lying. - It's not important. Yeah, it's the most important thing left in the universe. It's why I'm doing this. Amy, your house was too big. That big, empty house. - And just you. - And Aunt Sharon. Where were your mum and dad? Where was... everybody who lived in that big house? - I lost my Mum and Dad. - How? What happened to them? Where did they go? I... - I don't... - It's OK. Don't panic. It's not your fault. I don't even remember. There was a crack in time in the wall of your bedroom. And it's been eating away at your life for a long time now. All alone. The girl who didn't make sense. How could I resist? How could I just forget? Nothing is ever forgotten, not really. But you have to try. Doctor! It's speeding up! There's going to be a very big bang. Big Bang Two. Try and remember your family and they'll be there. How can I remember them if they never existed? Because you're special. That crack in your wall, all that time, the universe pouring into your head. You brought Rory back - you can bring them back, too. You just remember and they'll be there. You won't. You'll have your family back. You won't need your imaginary friend any more. Crying over me. - Guess what? - What? Gotcha. Back! Get back! It's from the Doctor. What does it say? "Geronimo." I escaped, then. Brilliant! Love it when I do that. Legs, yes. Bow tie, cool. I can buy a fez. The beach. The beach is the best. Automatic sand. Automatic sand? What does that mean? It's automated, totally. Cleans up the lolly sticks... No, hang on! That's last week when we went to Space Florida. I'm rewinding. My time stream - unravelling, erasing. Closing. Hello, universe. Goodbye, Doctor. Ah, three weeks ago, when she put the card in the window. I need to tell you something. She can hear me. But if she can hear me... Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let that girl open her eyes.</i> Amy, later! River, going to need your computer.</i> Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been more important. But you don't always tell me the truth. If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust me. Doctor, the crack in my wall. How can it be here? I don't know yet but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Remember what I told you when you were seven? What did you tell me? That's not the point. You have to remember. Remember what? Amelia's house. When she was seven. The night she waited. The girl who waited. Come here, you. It's funny. I thought if you could hear me, I could hang on somehow. Silly me. Silly old Doctor. When you wake up, you'll have a mum and dad... And you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me a little. I'll be a story in your head. But that's OK. We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? Cos it was, you know. It was the best. A daft old man who stole a magic box and ran away. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I borrowed it. I was always going to take it back. Oh, that box, Amy. You'll dream about that box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time. Brand new and ancient. And the bluest blue ever. And the times we had? Would've had... Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. The Doctor and Amy Pond. And the days that never came. The cracks are closing. But they can't close properly until I'm on the other side. I don't belong here any more. I think I'll skip the rest of the rewind. I hate repeats. Live well. Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond. Morning! You're my mum. - Oh, my God. You're my mum. - Well, of course I'm your mum. What's the matter with you? And this is your breakfast, which your father made, so feel free to tip it out of the window if it's an atrocity. Downstairs, 10 minutes? Big day! Of course she's my mum. Why is that surprising? I fear I may have been using the same joke book as the best man. You're my tiny little dad! Amelia, why are you behaving as if you've never seen us before? I don't know. It's just... Hello! Do you feel like you've forgotten something really important?'</i> Do you feel like there's a great big thing in your head, and you feel like you should remember it, but you can't? Are you just saying yes cos you're scared of me? I love you. I mean, I love you too! Ladies and gentlemen, the father of the bride, Augustus Pond! Sorry, everyone. I'll be another two minutes. I'm just reviewing certain aspects. Your father, Amelia, will be the absolute death of me. Unless, of course, I strike pre-emptively. You OK? I'm fine. Right. You're crying. So I am. Why am I doing that? Because you're happy, probably. Happy Mrs Rory. Happy, happy, happy. I'm sad. I'm really, really sad. Great. Why am I sad? What's that? Someone left it for you. - A woman. - But what is it? - It's a book. - It's blank. - It's a present. - But why? You know the old saying. The old... wedding... thing. Ready now. Sorry about that. Last-minute adjustments to certain aspects. Shut up, Dad! Shut up, please! There's someone missing, someone important. Someone so, so important. - Amy, what's wrong? - Sorry. Sorry, everyone. But when I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend. - No, not this again. - The raggedy Doctor. My raggedy Doctor. But he wasn't imaginary. He was real. - The psychiatrists we sent her to! - I remember you! I remember! I brought the others back, I can bring you home, too. Raggedy man, I remember you, and you are late for my wedding! I found you. I found you in words, like you knew I would. That's why you told me the story, the brand new, ancient blue box. Very clever. What is it? Something old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something blue. It's the Doctor! How did we forget the Doctor? OK, Doctor. Did I surprise you this time? Completely astonished. Never expected that. How lucky I happened to be wearing this old thing. Hello, everyone. I'm Amy's imaginary friend. But I came anyway. You absolutely, definitely may kiss the bride. Amelia! From now on, I shall be leaving the... kissing duties to the brand new Mr Pond. No, I'm not Mr Pond. - That's not how it works. - Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Right then, everyone. I'll move my box. You're going to need the space. I only came for the dancing. You're terrible. That is embarrassing! That's it. That's good. Keep it loose. 2,000 years. The boy who waited. Good on you, mate. Did you dance? You always dance at weddings, don't you? You tell me. Spoilers. The writing's all back, but I didn't peek. Thank you. Are you married, River? Are you asking? No, hang on. Did you think I was asking you to marry me, or asking if you were married? No, but was that "yes", or "yes"? Who are you? You're going to find out very soon now. And I'm sorry, but that's when everything changes. Where are you off to? We haven't even had a snog in the shrubbery yet. Shut up, it's my wedding. Our wedding. Sorry, you two, shouldn't have slipped away. Bit busy, you know? You just saved the whole of space and time. Take the evening off. Maybe a bit of tomorrow. Space and time isn't safe yet. The TARDIS exploded for a reason. Something drew the TARDIS to this particular date, and blew it up. Why? And why now? The silence, whatever it is, is still out there, and I have to... Excuse me a moment. I'm sorry, this is a very bad line. No, but that's not possible. She was sealed into the Seventh Obelisk. I was at the prayer meeting. No, I get that it's important. An Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express. In space! Give us a mo. Sorry, something's come up. This will have to be goodbye. Yeah, I think it's goodbye. Do you think it's goodbye? Definitely goodbye. Goodbye! Don't worry about a thing, Your Majesty.
