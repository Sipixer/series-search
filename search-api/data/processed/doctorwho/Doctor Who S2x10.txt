Poor Ursula.' 00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:39,127  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523 But like she said, there was this little community, the select few, 00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:42,123  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523 all with their stories of the Doctor. 00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:46,214  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523 'This little gang used to meet up, underneath the old library on Maccateer Street. 00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:50,535  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523 'Mr Skinner, first name Colin, but we always called him Mr Skinner. 00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:55,332  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523 'I don't know why, we just did.'

All these different Doctors come and go, 00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,754  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523 but the single constant factor is this faux-police box.
