But handy! 00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:23,208  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523 They work the mineshaft, all the drilling and stuff, supervision and maintenance. They're born for it. 00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,287  X1:078 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523 Basic slave race. You've got slaves? 00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,364  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523 Don't start!

Since when did humans need slaves? 00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,998  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523 But the Ood offer themselves. 00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:38,193  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523 If you don't give them orders, they just pine away and die. 00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,713  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523 Seriously? You like being ordered about? 00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:44,508  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523 It is all we crave. Why's that, then? 00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,106  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523 We have nothing else in life. 00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:49,267  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523 Yeah, well. I used to think like that. 00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,504  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523 Long time ago. There we go! D'you see? 00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,580  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523 To generate that gravity field and the funnel you need a power source 00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,650  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523 with an inverted self extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds. All the sixes. 00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,247  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523 And it's impossible. It took us two years to work that out. 00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,846  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523 I'm very good. 00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:06,005  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523 But that's why we're here. 00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:10,760  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523 This power source is ten miles below, through solid rock. 00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,037  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523 Point Zero. We're drilling down to try and find it. 00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:18,353  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523 It's giving off readings of over 90 Statts on the Blazen Scale. It could revolutionise modern science. 00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:20,110  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523 We could use it to fuel the Empire. 00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,788  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523 Or start a war. 00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,944  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523 It's buried beneath us. . . In the darkness. Waiting. 00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:26,944  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523 What's your job? 00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,344  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523 Chief dramatist? 00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:32,338  X1:218 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523 Whatever it is down there, it's not a natural phenomenon. 00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,176  X1:208 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523 This planet once supported life, 00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:37,489  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523 aeons ago, before the human race had even learned to walk. 00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,728  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523 I saw that lettering on the wall. Did you do that? I copied it from fragments we've found, 00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:45,642  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523 unearthed by the drilling. I can't translate it. No, neither can I. 00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,837  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523 And that's saying something. There was some form of civilisation. 00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:54,036  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523 They buried something. And now it's reaching out, 00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,311  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523 calling us in.
