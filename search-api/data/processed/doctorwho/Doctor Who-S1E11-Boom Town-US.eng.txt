But worth it! 00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,757  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523 Did you manage to find it? 00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,235  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523 There you go. I can go anywhere now! 00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:03,389  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523 You don't need a passport. It's all very well going to Platform One in Justicia and the Glass Pyramid, 00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:07,824  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523 but what if we end up in Brazil? I might need it. You see, I'm prepared for anything. 00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:10,247  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523 It sounds like you're staying, then. 00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,489  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523 So what are you doing in Cardiff? And who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash? 00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,612  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523 I don't mind you hanging out with Big Ears there. . . Oi! Look in the mirror. 00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:26,522  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523 .but this guy, he's kinda. . . Handsome? More like cheesy. 00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,363  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523 Early 21st-century slang, is cheesy good or bad? It's bad. 00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,439  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523 But bad means good, isn't that right? 00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,273  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523 Are you saying I'm not handsome? We just stopped off, we need to refuel. 00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:39,113  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523 Cardiff's got a rift through the middle of the city. 00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:45,464  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523 It's like an earthquake fault between different dimensions. The rift was healed back in 1869. 00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:50,101  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523 Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth. She saved the world and closed it. 00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,815  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523 But closing a rift leaves a scar, and that scar generates energy, harmless to the human race. . . 00:04:54,855 --> 00:05:00,805  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523 But perfect for the Tardis. I park on top of the scar. . . Open up the engines, soak up the radiation. . . 00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:04,609  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523 Like filling her up with petrol, and off we go! Into time! And space! 00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,922  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523 My God, have you seen yourselves? You all think you're so clever, don't you? Yep. Yeah! Yup. 00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:14,314  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523 It'll take another 24 hours, so we've got time to kill. 00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:19,349  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523 That old lady's staring. Probably wondering what four people can do inside a small wooden box. 00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,261  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523 What are you captain of - the Innuendo Squad? 00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,263  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523 Wait, er, the Tardis, doesn't it get noticed? 00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:30,300  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523 Yeah, why does it look like that? It's a cloaking device. 00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,448  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523 It's called a chameleon circuit. The Tardis is meant to disguise itself wherever it lands. 00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:41,723  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523 I landed in the 1960s, it disguised itself as a police box, and the circuit got stuck. 00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:43,842  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523 There actually was police boxes? 00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:51,473  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523 Yeah. Before they had radios, they'd phone for help. If they arrested someone, they could put 'em inside. 00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,790  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523 Why don't you just fix the circuit? I like it, don't you? I love it. 00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,553  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523 There's no police boxes any more, so doesn't it get noticed? 00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:05,381  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523 Ricky, you put a mysterious blue box slap bang in the middle of town, what do people do? Walk past it. 00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,377  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523 Now stop your nagging, let's go and explore. 00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,529  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523 What's the plan? I don't know. Cardiff, early 21st century, 00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,126  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523 and the wind's coming from the. . .east. Trust me. The safest place in the universe. 00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:21,655  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523 This nuclear power station right in the heart of Cardiff city will bring jobs for all! 00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:29,235  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523 As you can see, as Lord Mayor, I've had to sanction some radical redevelopments. 00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,272  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523 No photographs! What did I say? 00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:36,586  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523 Take pictures of the project by all means, but not me, thank you. 00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,703  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523 So. . . 00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:44,897  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523 Cardiff Castle will be demolished, allowing the Blaidd Drwg Project to rise up, tall and proud, 00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,614  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523 a monument to Welsh industry. 00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,171  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523 And, yes, some of you might shiver. 00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,048  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523 The words "nuclear power station" 00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:56,325  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523 and "major population centre" aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows. 00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:59,043  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523 But I give you my personal guarantee 00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:05,396  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523 that as long as I walk upon this Earth, no harm will come to any of my citizens. 00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:08,191  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523 Now drink up, a toast. . . 00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,790  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523 To the future!

I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews. 00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:27,569  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523 But are you aware of the curse? 00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:31,246  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523 Whatever do you mean? Cathy, wasn't it? 00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:37,079  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523 Some of your engineers are saying that the Blaidd Drwg Project is cursed. Sounds rather silly to me. 00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,677  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523 That's what I thought, 00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:43,354  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523 but the funny thing is it does look a bit odd. 00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:47,631  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523 In what way? The number of deaths associated with this project - 00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,749  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523 the entire team of European safety inspectors. 00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,021  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523 They were French, and, "Danger! Explosives!" was only written in Welsh. 00:07:55,061 --> 00:08:01,172  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523 And the accident with the Cardiff Heritage Committee. The electrocutio of that swimming pool was accidental. 00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:02,651  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523 And then the architect. 00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,926  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523 It was raining, visibility was low, my car simply couldn't stop. 00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:12,881  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523 And then recently Mr Cleaver, the government's nuclear adviser. Slippe on an icy patch. He was decapitated. 00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:20,074  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523 It was a very icy patch. These stories are nothing more than typical small-town thinking. Excuse me. 00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:24,990  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523 Before he died, Mr Cleaver posted some of his findings online. Did he? 00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,947  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523 He was concerned about the reactor. Oh! All that technical stuff. 00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:33,301  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523 Specifically that the design of the suppression pool would cause the hydrogen recombiners to fail, 00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:38,892  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:416 Y2:523 precipitating the collapse of the containment system, causing meltdown. You've done your homework. 00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,212  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523 That's my job. 00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,840  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523 I think. . .Cathy Salt. . . 00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,723  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523 .I think you and I should have a word in private. 00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:50,523  X1:078 X2:219 Y1:488 Y2:523 GURGLING 00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:56,635  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523 Oh, my little tummy's complaining. We might have to make a detour to the ladies. I'll wait here. 00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,634  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523 Oh, come on! All girls together! 00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:04,424  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523 So you were saying? These outlandish theories of yours. 00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,625  X1:078 X2:219 Y1:488 Y2:523 GURGLING 00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:14,973  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523 It sounds like we got here just in time. Continue. Well, I don't know much about nuclear physics, 00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:22,288  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523 but from what I could make out, Cleaver was saying the whole project could go up, worse than Chernobyl. 00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,485  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523 Is there something wrong with the lights? 00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:30,879  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523 Oh, they're always on the blink.

He almost made it sound deliberate. 00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:51,655  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523 We're hardly The Sunday Times, we're only the Cardiff Gazette, but we do have a duty to report the facts. 00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:58,369  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523 And you're going to print this information?

If we take her home, give her to a different family who bring her up properly, 00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:14,549  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523 she might be all right. Or she might be worse. That's her choice. She's an egg. She's an egg. 00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:17,086  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523 Oh, my God, Mickey! 00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:13,066  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523 Opening the rift filled us up with energy, we can go. If that's all right. Yeah, fine. 00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,678  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523 How's Mickey? He's OK. He's gone. 00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:24,191  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523 Do you wanna go and find him? We'll wait. No need. He deserves better. 00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,588  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523 Off we go, then. Always moving on. 00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:30,386  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523 Next stop, Raxacoricofallapatorious. 00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:32,386  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523 Now you don't often get to say that. 00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:37,661  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523 We'll pop her in the hatchery. Margaret the Slitheen can live her life again. A second chance. 00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,323  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523 That'd be nice. 00:41:56,955 --> 00:42:01,390  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:272 Y2:343 You got chosen, you're a housemate, you're in the house! 00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,870  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523 Welcome to The Weakest Link. 00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,806  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523 We're giving you a brand-new image. What's wrong with what I'm wearing? 00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:12,317  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523 What was that? She's been evicted. 00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:19,013  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523 This isn't just a game. I need to find the Doctor! 00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:22,332  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523 There's something else going on. We have contestants outside the games. 00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:25,170  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523 They fear the Doctor. Tell me, who are they? ! 00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,486  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523 That's impossible. I know those ships, they were destroyed. 00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:33,560  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523 Obviously they survived. Alert, alert! We are detected!
