and space, just like California on the San Andreas fault... but the rift bleeds energy. I open up the engines, soak up the energy AND use it as fuel. So it's a pit stop? Exactly! Should only take 20 seconds. The rift's been active. Wait. They had an earthquake in Cardiff, couple of years ago. Was that you? Doctor! Finito, all powered up. What's that?! We're accelerating into the future. The year one billion. Five billion. Five trillion! 50 trillion? What?! The year 100 trillion?! That's impossible! Why, what happens then? We're going to the end of the universe. Doctor! Humans. Humans are coming. I don't... I just want to go. Please, let me go. Huuuuuu-maaan! Huuuuuu-maaan! Huuuuuu-maaan! THEY GROWL AND GRUNT Hunt! Hunt! Hunt! Hunt! There's movement on the surface. Another human hunt, God help him. Chan, should I alert the guards, tho? No, no, we can't spare them. Poor beggar's on his own. One more lost soul, dreaming of Utopia. Chan, you mustn't talk as though you've given up, tho. No, no, indeed. Here's to it. Utopia. Where, it is to be hoped, the coffee is a little less sour. Will you join me? I am happy drinking my own internal milk, tho. Yes, well that's quite enough information, thank you. 'Professor Yana? 'Don't want to rush you, but how are we doing? ' Yes, yes, working! Yes, almost there! 'How's it looking on the Footprint? ' It's good, yes, fine, excellent. There's no problem as such, we've accelerated the calculation matrix, but it's going to take time to harmonise though. We're trying a new reversal process, we'll have a definite result in approximately two hours, though. Chan, professor... VOICE DROWNED OUT BY LOUD DRUMMING Chan, professor Yana, tho. Chan, professor tho. Yes, yes, yes, working. Chan, it's the surface scanner, Professor, it seems to be detecting a different signal, tho. Well that's not a standard reading. I can't make it out. It would seem, something new has arrived. Well... we've landed. So what's out there? I don't know. Ooh, say that again, that's rare. Not even the Time Lords came this far. We should leave. We should go. We should really, really... go. Oh, my God. Can't get a pulse. Hold on, you've got that medical kit thing. Hello again. Ohh, I'm sorry. Here we go. Get out the way. It's a bit odd, not very hundred trillion, that coat's more like World War Two. I think he came with us. From Earth? Must've been clinging to the Tardis, all the way through the vortex. Well, that's very him. D' you know him? Friend of mine. Used to travel with me. Back in the old days. But he's... I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat, there's nothing. He's dead. Oh, well so much for me! It's all right, just breathe deep, I've got you. Captain Jack Harkness. And who are you? Martha Jones. Nice to meet you, Martha Jones. Oh, don't start. I was only saying hello. I don't mind. Doctor. Captain. Good to see you. And you. Same as ever. Although... Have you had work done? You can talk. Yes, the face. Regeneration. How did you know this was me? The police box kind of gives it away. I've been following you. For a long time. You abandoned me. Did I? Busy life. Moving on. I've just got to ask... The Battle of Canary Wharf. I saw the list of the dead. And it said Rose Tyler. Oh! No! Sorry! She's alive! You're kidding! Parallel world! Safe and sound! And Mickey! And her mother! Oh, yes! Good old Rose. So there I was, stranded in the year 200100, ankle deep in Dalek dust, and he goes off without me, but I had this. I used to be a Time Agent, it's called a Vortex Manipulator, he's not the only one who can time travel. Excuse me, that is not time travel. It's like, I've got a sports car, you've got a spacehopper. Oh, boys and their toys. All right, so I bounced, I thought, 21st century, best place to find the Doctor. Except I got it a little wrong, arrived in 1869, this thing burnt out, so it was useless. Told you! I lived through the entire 20th century, waiting for a version of you that coincided with me. But that makes you more than 100 years old. And looking good, don't you think? So, I went to the Time Rift, based myself there, cos I knew you'd come back to refuel, until finally, I get a signal on this... detecting you, and here we are! But how come you left him behind, Doctor? I was busy! Is that what happens? D' you just get bored of us, one day and disappear? Not if you're blonde. Oh, what a surprise! You two! We're at the end of the universe, right at the edge of knowledge itself, and you're busy... blogging! Come on! Is that a city? City, or a hive, or a nest. Or a conglomeration. Like it was grown. But look, there, that's like... pathways, or roads, there must've been some sort of life. Long ago. What killed it? Time. just time. Everything's dying now. All the great civilisations have gone. This isn't just night - all the stars have burnt up and faded away. Into nothing. They must have an atmospheric shell. We should be frozen to death. Well, Martha and I, maybe. Not so sure about you, Jack. But what about the people? Does no-one survive? I suppose... I have to hope, life will find a way. Well, he's not doing too bad. Is it me, or does that look like a hunt? Come on! Oh, I've missed this! SHOUTING AND GROWLING I've got you. They're coming. They're coming. GROWLING Jack. Don't you dare. GUNSHOTS What the hell are they? We've got to keep going. I've got a ship nearby. It's safe, it's over there... or maybe not We're close to the Silo! If we get to the Silo, then we're safe. Silo? Silo! Silo for me! It's the Futurekind - they're coming, let us in! Show me your teeth! Show me your teeth! Show me your teeth! Show him your teeth! Human! Let them in! Let them in! Close! Close! Close! RAPID GUNFIRE Humaaaaans. Human meat. Make feast. Go back to where you came from. I said, go back! Back! Don't tell him to put HIS gun down. He's not my responsibility. And I am? That makes a change. Watching you. Kind hungry. Yeah! Thanks for that. Right, let's get you inside. My name is Padra Fet Shafe Cane, tell me, just tell me... Can you take me to Utopia? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, I can! Professor, we've got four new Humans inside, one of them is calling himself a Doctor. Of medicine? He says of everything. What? A scientist! Oh, my word! Chantho, just... I don't know. I'm coming! It's like a box, a big blue box... I need it back, it's stuck out there. You're 561. My family were heading for the Silo. Did they get here? My mother is Kistane Shafe Cane, my brother's name is Beltone. You can check the paperwork. Creet! Passenger needs help! What d' you need? A blue box, you said? Big, tall, wooden, says "Police". We're driving out for the last water collection, I'll see what I can do. Thank you! We could still take a look. Come on. Sorry, but... how old are you? Old enough to work. This way. Kistane Shafe Cane! Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane! I'm looking for Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane! The Shafe Canes, anyone? Anyone? Kistane from Red Falls Five? Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane. Anyone know the Shafe Cane family? Anyone called Shafe Cane? It's like a refugee camp... It's stinking. Sorry. No offence. Not you. Don't you see, though? The ripe old smell of humans! You survived! Oh, you might've spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas, and another million as downloads, but you always revert to the same basic shape. Indomitable! Is there a Kistane Shafe Cane? That's me. Mother! Oh, my God! Padra! It's not all bad news. Captain Jack Harkness, and who are you? Stop it! Give us a hand with this. It's half-deadlocked. See if you can overwrite the code. Let's find out where we are. I've got you. Thanks. How did you cope without me? Now that is what I call a rocket! They're not refugees, they're passengers. He said they were going to Utopia. The perfect place. Hundred trillion years and it's the same old dream. D' you recognise the engines? Nope, whatever it is, it's not rocket science. But it's hot, though. Boiling! But if the universe is falling apart, what does Utopia mean? The Doctor? That's me! Good! Good good good good good good good good good good good good! It's good, apparently. Chan, welcome, tho. This is the gravitissimal accelerator, it's past its best... Chan, welcome though. And over here is the Footprint Impeller System. D' you know anything about end time gravity mechanics? Who are you? Chan, Chantho, tho. But we can't get it to harmonise... Captain Jack Harkness. Stop it! Can't I say hello to anyone? Chan, I do not protest tho. Maybe later, Blue. So what have we got here? And all this feeds into the rocket? Except without a stable footprint, we'll never achieve escape velocity. If only we could harmonise the five impact patterns, and unify them, well, we might yet make it. What d' you think, Doctor? Any ideas? Well. Um. Basically. Sort of... Not a clue. Nothing? I'm not from round these parts. I've never seen a system like it. Sorry. No, no, I'm sorry, it's my fault. There's been so little help... Oh, my God. You've got a hand, a hand in a jar. A hand, in jar, in your bag. That's - that's my hand! I said I had a Doctor-detector! Is this is a tradition amongst your people? What d' you mean, that's your hand?! You've got both your hands. I can see them! I lost my hand Christmas Day in a swordfight. What, and you grew another hand?! Um. Yeah, yeah I did, yeah. Hello! Might I ask, what species are you? Time Lord - last of. Heard of them? Legend or anything? Not even a myth? Blimey, end of the universe is a bit humbling. Chan, it is said that I am the last of my species too, tho. Sorry, what was your name? My assistant, and good friend, Chantho. A survivor of the Malmooth. This was their planet, Malcassairo, before we took refuge. That city outside, that was yours? Chan, the Conglomeration died... tho. Conglomeration! That's what I said! You're supposed to say "Sorry". Oh, yes. Sorry. Chan, most grateful, tho. You grew another hand? Hello again. It's fine, look, really, it's me. All this time and you're still full of surprises. Chan, you are most unusual, tho. Well... So what about those things outside, the beastie boys? We call them the Futurekind. Which is a myth, in itself, but it's feared they are what we will become, unless we reach Utopia. And Utopia is...? Every human knows of Utopia. Where have you been? Bit of a hermit. A hermit with friends? Hermits United. We meet up, every ten years, swap stories about caves. It's good fun for a hermit. So, um, Utopia? The call came from across the stars. Over and over again. "Come to Utopia". Originating from that point. Where is that? Oh, it's far beyond the Condensate Wilderness. Out towards the Wildlands and the Dark Matter Reefs. Calling us in, the last of the humans, scattered across the night. What d' you think is out there? We can't know. A colony, a city, some sort of haven? The Science Foundation created the Utopia Project, thousands of years ago. To preserve mankind, to find a way of surviving beyond the collapse of reality itself, now perhaps they found it. Perhaps not. But it's worth a look, don't you think? Ohhh yes... And the signal keeps modulating, so it's not on automatic. That's a good sign. Someone's out there. And that's, ooh that's a navigation matrix... DOCTOR'S VOICE DROWNED OUT BY LOUD DRUMMING Professor? Professor! Right, that's enough talk. There's work to do! Now if you could leave, thank you. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. And busy! Except that rocket's not going to fly, is it? This footprint mechanism-thing, it's not working. We'll find a way! You're stuck on this planet, and you haven't told them, have you? That lot out there, they still think they're gonna fly. Well, it's better to let them live in hope. Quite right too. And I must say, Professor, what was it? Yana. Professor Yana, this new science is well beyond me. But all the same, a boost reversal circuit, in any timeframe, must be a circuit which reverses the boost, so I wonder what would happen if I did this... SIREN WAILS Chan, it's working, tho. But! How did you do that?! Oh, we've been chatting away, I forgot to tell you. I'm brilliant! ON TANNOY: 'All passengers, prepare for boarding. Repeat, all passengers prepare for immediate boarding. 'Destination Utopia. ' There... ...and there. TANNOY: 'All troops withdraw to Silo. Repeat, all troops withdraw to Silo. ' Inside! Everyone, inside. Come on, move, move, move. ON TANNOY: 'Air passengers prepare for immediate boarding. 'Air passengers prepare for immediate boarding. ' Excuse me. Hey, what was your name, Creet? That's right, miss. Who are you with Creet, you got family? No, miss, there’s just me. Good luck. What d' you think it's gonna be like, in Utopia? My mum used to say, the skies are made of diamonds. Good for her. Go on, off you go, get your seat! SHE SNARLS Is that...? Gluten extract. It binds the neutralino map together. But that's food. You've built this system out of food and string and staples. Professor Yana, you're a genius! Says the man who made it work. Aah, it's easy, coming in at the end. But you're stellar, this is, this is magnificent! And I don't often say that, cos... well, cos of me. But even my title is an affectation. There hasn't been such a thing as a university for over 1,000 years. I've spent my life going from one refugee ship to another. If you'd been born in a different time, you'd be revered. I mean it. Throughout the galaxies. Oh, those damn galaxies, they had to go and collapse! Some admiration would have been nice. just a little. just once. Well, you've got it now. But that footprint engine-thing... You can't activate it from on board, it's got to be done from here. You're staying behind. With Chantho. She won't leave without me. Simply refuses. You'd give your life, so they could fly. Oh, I think I'm a little too old for Utopia. Time I had some sleep. ON TANNOY: 'Professor, tell the Doctor we've found his blue box. ' Aah. Doctor... Professor, it's a wild stab in the dark, but I might just have found you a way out! Extra power. Little bit of a cheat, but who's counting? Jack, you're in charge of the retro feeds. Oh, am I glad to see that thing! Chan, Professor, are you all right? Fine, I'm fine, I'm fine just... get on with it. Connect those circuits into the spar, same as the last lot but quicker. Yes, sir! You don't have to keep working. We can handle it. It’s just a headache, just... noise, inside my head, Doctor. Constant noise inside my head. What sort of noise? The sound of drums. More and more, as though... it's getting closer. When did it start? Oh, I've had it all my life. Every waking hour! Still, no rest for the wicked. So how long have you been with the Professor? Chan, 17 years, tho. Blimey. Long time. Chan, I adore him, tho. Oh, right. And he... Chan, I don't think he even notices, tho. Tell me about it. Chan, but I am happy to serve, tho. D' you have to start every sentence with "Chan"? Chan, yes, tho. And end every sentence with...? Chan, tho, tho. What would happen if you didn't? Chan, that would be rude, tho. What, like swearing? Chan, indeed, tho. Oh, go on. just once. Chan, I can't, tho. Oh, do it for me. No! Professor! Systems are down. Professor, you getting me? I'm here - we're ready. All you need to do is connect the couplings, then we can launch. God save us, this equipment! Needs rebooting, all the time. Anything I can do? I've finished that lot. Yes, if you could. just press the reboot key every time the picture goes... Certainly! just don't ask me to do shorthand. Are you still there? Present and correct! Send your man inside. We'll keep the levels down from here. He's inside and good luck to him. Captain, keep the dials below the red. Where is that room? It's underneath the rocket. Fix the couplings, and the Footprint can work. But the entire chamber is flooded with stet radiation. Stet? Never heard of it. You wouldn't want to but it's safe enough. We can hold the radiation back from here. ALARM RINGS It's rising. 0.2, keep it level. Yes, sir. SIREN WAILS We're losing power, tho. SIREN CONTINUES TO WAIL Radiation's rising! We've lost control! The chamber's going to flood! Jack! Override the vents! Get out! Get out of there! Jake! Oi, you! Duck... We can jump-start the override. Don't, it's gonna flare! Jake, get out of there! Get out! Noooooo! I've got him. Don't touch the cables, tho. I'm so sorry. The chamber's flooded with radiation, yes? Without the couplings, the engines will never start. It was all for nothing. Oh, I don't know. Professor, you've got a room which no man can enter, without dying. Is that correct? Yes. Well... LOUD GASPING BREATH I think I've got just the man. Was someone kissing me? Lieutenant, get on board the rocket, you're going to fly. The chamber's flooded. We've found a way of tripping the system. Run! What are you taking your clothes off for? I'm going in! Well, I'd say that stet radiation doesn't affect clothing, only flesh. Well, I look good, though! How long have you known? Ever since I ran away from you. Good luck! We lost picture when that thing flared up... Doctor, are you there? Receiving, yeah. He's inside. And still alive? Oh, yes. But he should evaporate. What sort of a man is he? I've only just met him. The Doctor sort of travels through time and space, and picks people up... God, I make us sound like stray dogs. Maybe we are. He travels in time? Don't ask me to explain it. That's a Tardis, that box thing. The sports car of time travel, he says. When did you realise? ECHOING VOICE: 'That's a Tardis, that's a Tardis, that's a Tardis... When did you realise? Earth, 1892. Got in a fight on Ellis Island, man shot me through the heart and then I woke up. Thought it was kind of strange but then it never stopped. Fell off a cliff, trampled by horses, World War One, World War Two. Poison. Starvation. A stray javelin. In the end, I got the message. I'm the man who can never die. And all that time, you knew. That's why I left you behind. It's not easy, even just... looking at you, Jack, cos you're wrong. Thanks. But you are, I can't help it, I'm a Time Lord, it's instinct, it's in my guts. You're a fixed point in time and space. You're a fact. And that's never meant to happen. Even the Tardis reacted against you, tried to shake you off, flew all the way to the end of the universe to get rid of you. So what you're saying is... you're prejudiced. I never thought of it like that. Shame on you. Yeah. Last thing I remember, back when I was mortal... I was facing three Daleks, death by extermination and then I came back to life. What happened? Rose. I thought you'd sent her back home. She came back. Opened the heart of the Tardis, and absorbed the Time Vortex itself. What does that mean, exactly? No-one's ever meant to have that power. If a Time Lord did that, he'd become a God, a vengeful God. But she was human. I bring life. Everything she did was so human. She brought you back to life but she couldn't control it, she brought you back forever. That's something, I suppose - the final act of the Time War was life. Do you think she could change me back? I took the power out of her. She's gone, Jack. She's not just living on a parallel world, she's trapped there. The walls have closed. I'm sorry. Yep. I went back to her estate. In the nineties, just once or twice. Watched her growing up. Never said hello, timelines and all that. Do you want to die? Oh, this one's a little stuck. Jack? I thought I did. I dunno... but this lot, you see them out here, surviving, and that's fantastic. You might be out there somewhere. I could go meet myself. Well, it's the only man you're ever gonna be happy with. This new regeneration. It's kinda cheeky. VOICE IN HEAD: 'Regeneration, regeneration... ' I never understand half the things he's saying... What's wrong? Chan, Professor, what is it? Time travel. They say there was time travel back in the old days, I never believed... But what would I know? Stupid old man, never could keep time. Always late, always lost. Even this thing - never worked. Martha, this watch is me. I'm gonna become human. Time and time and time again, always running out on me... Can I have a look at that? Oh, it's only an old relic. Like me. Where did you get it? Hmmm? I was found with it. What d' you mean? An orphan in the storm. I was a naked child, found on the coast of the Silver Devastation. Abandoned with only this. Have you ever opened it? Why would I? It's broken. How d' you know it's broken if you've never opened it? It's stuck, it's old, it's... not meant to be. I don't know. Ah... Does it matter? No, it's nothing, it's... Listen, everything's fine up here, I'm gonna see if the Doctor needs me. Yes! Now get out of there, come on! Lieutenant, everyone on board? 'Ready and waiting. ' Stand by! Two minutes to ignition! TANNOY: 'Ready to launch. 'Outer doors sealed, Countdown commences, T minus 99, 98... ' The Footprint, it's a gravity pulse, it stamps down, the rocket shoots up bit primitive, it's gonna take the both of us to keep it stable. Doctor, the Professor's got a fobwatch, it's the same as yours, same writing on it, same everything. Don't be ridiculous. I asked him, he said he's had it his whole life. So? He's got the same watch. Yeah, but it's not a watch... it's this chameleon thing. No, no, no... it's this... it's this thing... this device that rewrites biology, changes a Time Lord into a Human. And it's the same watch! It can't be. That means he could be a Time Lord! You might not be the last one! Jack, keep it level! But that's brilliant, isn't it? Yes, it is, course it is! Depends which one. Fantastic, yeah... but they died, the Time Lords, all of them, they died. Not if he was human! What did he say, Martha, what did he say?! He looked at the watch like he could hardly see it... MONTAGE OF VOICES: 'Tardis, the Time Vortex... 'Regeneration. It's the drums, 'the drums, the drums the never-ending drumbeat, open me you human fool, 'open the light and summon me and receive my majesty. 'Destroy him, then you will give your power to me. ' Chan, Yana, won't you please take some rest, tho? ON TANNOY: '13, 12, 11, 10... ' If he escaped the Time War, then it's a perfect place to hide - the end of the universe! And think what the Face of Boe said! His dying words! He said. You... are... not... alone. Chan, Professor Yana? Tho. Lieutenant, have you done it? Did you get velocity? Have you done it, Lieutenant, have you done it? 'Affirmative, we'll see you in Utopia. ' Good luck. But you've locked them in, tho. Get it open! Get it open. Not to worry, my dear. As one door closes, another must open. Chan, you must stop, tho. Chan, but you've lowered the defences, the Futurekind will get in! Tho. Chan, Professor, I'm so sorry... ...but I must stop you. You are destroying all our work. Ohhhhhh, now I can say I was provoked. SHOUTS AND GROWLING Did you never think all those years, standing beside me, to ask about that watch? Never? Did you never once think, not ever, that you could set me free? Chan, I'm sorry, tho... Chan, I'm so sorry. And you, with your "Chan" and your "tho", driving me insane... Chan, Professor, please... That is not my name. The Professor was an invention. So perfect a disguise, that I forgot who I am. Chan, then who are you? Tho. I am the Master. This way! Professor! Professor, let me in! Let me in! Jack, get the door open NOW! Professor, professor, where are you? Professor, professor, are you there, I need to explain, whatever you do, don't open that watch. Utopia. They're coming! Open the door! Open the door, please! I'm begging you professor, please listen to me! just open the door, please! And locked. Let me in! Let me in! She's dead... I broke the lock. Give me a hand. I'm begging you! Everything's changed. It's only the two of us, we're the only ones left. just let me in! Killed by an insect. A girl! How inappropriate. But still, if the Doctor can be young and strong... then so can I. The Master... reborn! HE SCREAMS Doctor, you'd better think of something! Ha, ha! Ha, ha! Oh! Oh! Now then, Doctor... ooh, new voice! IN DIFFERENT PITCHES: Hello! Hello. Hello. Anyway! Why don't we stop and have a nice little chat while I tell you all my plans and you can work out a way to stop me, I don't think! Hold on, I know that voice. I'm asking you, really properly, just stop, just think. Use my name. Master. I'm sorry. Tough! Oh, no you don't! End of the universe! Have fun! Bye bye! Doctor, stop him!
