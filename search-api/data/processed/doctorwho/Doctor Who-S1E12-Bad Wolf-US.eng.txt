That's what I call power. 600 channels coming out of Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere. This technology's wrong. Trouble? Oh, yeah. This is not the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. Humans are allowed to live here by kind permission of my client. Who controls Satellite Five? The Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe. You mean that thing's in charge of Satellite Five? Once you go to Floor 500, you never come back. You'll have to stay and explain it, no-one's gonna believe me. Oh, they might start believing a lot of things now. The human race should accelerate. All back to normal. What is it? What's happening? Oh, my God! I don't believe it, why did they put you in there? They never said you were coming! What happened? I was. . . Careful now, oh. . . Oh, mind yourself! Oh, that's the transmat, it scrambles your head. I was sick for days. You all right? So. . .what's your name, then, sweetheart? The Doctor, I think, I was. . . I don't know what happened! You got chosen. Chosen for what? You're a housemate! You're in the house! Isn't that brilliant? That's not fair, we've got eviction in five minutes! I've been here for all nine weeks, I've followed the rules, I haven't had a single warning, and he comes swanning in! If they keep changing the rules, I'm gonna protest, I am. I'm gonna paint the walls. 'Would the Doctor please come to the Diary Room?' You are live on Channel 44, 000. Please do not swear. You have GOT to be kidding. Oh. . . Ah. . . What happened? It's all right. It's the transmat. It does your head in, you get a bit of amnesia. What's your name? Rose. But. . .where's the Doctor? Just remember, do what the android says. Don't provoke it. The android's word is law. What do you mean, android? Like a robot? Positions, everyone, thank you! Come on, hurry up! The contestants are in place, the cameras. . . Oh, steady! I was travelling, with the Doctor and a man called Captain Jack? The Doctor wouldn't just leave me. That's enough chat! Positions! Final call. Good luck. But I'm not supposed to be here. It says Rose on the podium. Come on. Hold on. . . I must be going mad. It can't be, this looks like. . . Android activated! Oh, my God, the android. . . The An. . .droid. Welcome. . .to the Weakest Link! WEAKEST LINKJINGLE Here we go again. We've got our work cut out for us. I don't know, he's sort of handsome. Good lantern jaw. Lantern jaws are so last year. Sorry. . . Nice to meet you, ladies, but where exactly am I? We're giving you a brand new image. Hold on, I was with the Doctor. . . Why, is there something wrong with what I'm wearing? It's all very 20th century, where did you get that denim? A little place in Cardiff, it was called. . .the Top Shop. Ah, design classic! We're gonna have to find you some new colours, maybe get rid of that Oklahoma farm boy thing you've got going. Just stand still and let the defabricator work its magic. What's a defabricator? OK, defabricator. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Am I naked in front of millions of viewers? Absolutely! Ladies. . .your viewing figures just went up. I can't open it. It's got a deadlock seal, ever since Big Brother 504 when they all walked out. You must remember that. What about this? Oh, that's exoglass, you'd need a nuclear bomb to get through. Don't tempt me. I know you're not supposed to talk about the outside world, but you must've been watching. Do people like me? Lynda, Lynda with a Y, not Linda with an I, she got forcibly evicted cos she damaged a camera. Am I popular? I don't remember. Oh, but does that mean I'm nothing? Some people get this far just cos they're insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me? No, you're nice, you're. . .sweet. Everybody thinks you're sweet. Oh, is that right? Is that what I am? No-one's ever told me that before. Am I sweet? Really? Yeah, dead sweet. Thank you. It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be a garden out there? Don't be daft, no-one's got a garden any more! Who's got a garden? Don't tell me you've got a garden! No, I've just got the Tardis. I remember. That's the amnesia! So what happened, where did they get you? We'd just left Raxacoricofallapatorius and then we went to Kyoto, that's right, Japan in 1336, and we only just escaped. We were together and we were laughing and then. . . there was this light, this white light coming through the walls, and then. . . I woke up here. Yeah, that's the transmat beam, that's how they pick the housemates. Oh, Lynda with a Y. . . Sweet little Lynda. It's worse than that. I'm not just some passing traveller. No stupid little transmat gets inside my ship. That beam was 15 million times more powerful, which means. . .this isn't just a game. There's something else going on. Well, here's the latest update from the Big Brother house. I'm getting out, I'm gonna find my friends. . . and then I'm gonna find you. Need a word. Hold on. Let me finish this. 19, 18. . . 17, 16, 15. . . Thank you, people, transmitting in. . . 12, 11, 10. . . But I need to find the Doctor. Just shut up and play the game! All right, then. . .what the hell? I'm gonna play to win! And. . .cue. Let's play the Weakest Link! Start the clock. Agorax, the name of which basic foodstuff is an anagram of the word "beard"? Bread. Correct. Fitch, in the Pantraffic Calendar, which month comes after Hoob? Is it. . .Clavadoe? No, Pandoff. Rose, in maths, what is 258 minus 158? 100. Correct. Rodrick. Bank! Which letter of the alphabet appears in the word "dangle" but not in the word "gland"? E. Correct. Colleen, in social security, what Correct. Broff, the Great Cobalt Pyramid is built on the remains of which famous old Earth institute? Touchdown. No, Torchwood. Agorax, in language, all five examples of which type of letter appear in the word facetious? Vowels. Correct. Fitch, in biology, which blood cells contain iron - red or white? Erm. . . White. No, red. Rose, in the holovid series Jupiter Rising, the Grexnik is married to whom? How should I know? Why is she laughing? Rodrick, in maths. . . Oh, my God, I think she knows. And I've got a housemate who appeared out of nowhere. I told you. It's like the game's running itself. It's the buccaneer look - a little a dash of pirate and just a tweak of President Schwarzenegger. I'm not sure about the vest, what about a bit of colour to lift it? Absolutely not, never wear black with colour. Now, let's talk jackets. I kinda like the first one. No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel, I think I like the shorter one. Look, waist-length, nice and slimming, shows off the bum. Works for me. Once we've got an outfit, we can look at the face. Ever thought about cosmetic surgery? I've considered it. A little lift around the eyes, tighten up the jaw line. What do you think? Oh, let's have a bit more ambition! Let's do something. . .cutting edge. So, Rose, what do you actually do? I just travel about a bit, a bit of a. . .tourist, I suppose. Another way of saying unemployed? No. Have you got a job? Well, not really, no, but. . . Then you ARE unemployed, and yet you've still got enough money to buy peroxide. Why Fitch? I think she got a few of the questions wrong, that's all. And you'd know all about that. Well, yeah, but I can't vote for myself, so it had to be Fitch. I'm sorry, that's the game, that's how it works. I had to vote for someone. Let me try again, it was the lights and everything, I couldn't think. In fact, with three answers wrong, Broff was the weakest link in that round, but it's votes that count. I'm sorry, please. . . Oh, God, help me! Fitch, you are the weakest link. Goodbye. And we've gone to the adverts, back in three minutes! What was that? What just happened? She was the weakest link, she gets disintegrated. Blasted into atoms. But I voted for her! Oh, my God, this is sick! All of you, you're just sick! I'm not playing this! I'm not playing! I. . .I can't do it! Oh, please, somebody let me out! You are the weakest link. Goodbye. Don't try to escape. It's play. . .or die. Doctor, they said all housemates must gather on the sofa, you've got to. I'm busy getting out, thanks. But if you don't obey, then all the housemates get punished. Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then. How stupid are you? You've only just joined, you're not eligible. Don't try anything clever or we all get it in the neck. Big Brother house, this is Davina-droid. Crosbie, Lynda and Strood, you have all been nominated for eviction. And the eighth person to be evicted from the Big Brother house is. . . Crosbie! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It should've been me, that's not fair. Oh, Crosbie. . . Crosbie, you have ten seconds to make your farewells and then we're gonna get you. I won't forget you! I'm sorry I stole your soap. I don't mind, honestly! Thanks for the food, you were a smashing cook, bless you. Crosbie, please leave the Big Brother house. Bye, then. Bye, Lynda. Bye. . . I don't believe it, poor Crosbie. It's only a game show! She'll make a fortune on the outside. Sell her story, release a record, fitness video, all of that, she'll be laughing. What do you mean, on the outside? Here we go. Well, what are they waiting for? Why don't they just let her go? Stop it, it's not funny! Eviction in five, four, three, two, one! What was that? Disintegrator beam. She's been evicted. >From life. No-one programmed the transmat, no-one selected the new contestants. It is exactly like those stories. Oh, don't start that again. I think you need to take a session off. I would, if you'd take it with me. And don't start that again either. Though the rumours go back decades, saying that something's been hidden up here underneath the transmissions. But the controller would know. She watches everything. Maybe she just can't see it. You've got to allow for human error. Well, that's your problem, then. I don't think she's been human for years. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, transmit. Are you insane? You just step right into the disintegrator? Is it that important, getting your face on the telly? Is it worth dying for? ! We haven't got a choice! But I thought you had to apply. Don't be so stupid, that's how they played it centuries back. You get chosen whether you like it or not. Everyone on Earth is a potential contestant, the transmat beam picks you out at random. It's non-stop, there are 60 Big Brother Houses running at once. How many, 60?! They've had to cut back, it's not what it was. It's a charnel house! What about the winners, what do they get? They get to live. Is that it? ! Well, isn't that enough? Rose is out there. She got caught in the transmat, she's a contestant. Time I got out. That other contestant, Linda with an I, she was forcibly evicted for what? Damage to property. What, like this? No, I'm just not getting this, it's just too. . .safe, too decent. And you'd never keep it clean. Stage two ready and waiting. Bring it on, girls. Now it's time for the face-off! Does that mean I get to compete with someone else? No, like I said, face. . .off. I think you'd look good with a dog's head. Or maybe no head at all, that would be so outrageous. And we could stitch your legs to the middle of your chest. Nothing is too extreme, it's to die for! Now hold on, ladies, I don't want to have to shoot either one of you. But you're unarmed. You're naked! But that's a Compact Laser Deluxe! Where were you hiding that? You really don't want to know. Give me that accessory! You are the weakest link, goodbye! Going to the break, two minutes on the clock. Just a reminder, we've got solar flare activity coming up in ten. Colleen was clever, she banked all the money, why'd you you vote for her? Cos I want to keep you in! You're stupid, you don't even know the Princess Vossaheen's surname. When it comes to the final, I want to be up against you. So that you get disintegrated and I get a load of credits, courtesy of the Bad Wolf Corporation. What do you mean? Who's Bad Wolf? They're in charge. They run the Game Station. Why are they called Bad Wolf? I dunno, it's just a name. It's like an old Earth nursery rhyme, what does it matter? I keep hearing those words everywhere we go, Bad Wolf. . . The things you've seen. . . The darkness! The big bad wolf. Attention, all personnel, Bad Wolf One descending. Blaidd Drwg. . . What does it mean? Bad Wolf. Different times, different places, like it's written all over the universe. What are you on about? If the Bad Wolf are in charge of the quiz, then. . . maybe I'm not here by mistake. Someone's been planning this. The Doctor, you've broken the house rules, Big Brother has no choice but to evict you. You have ten seconds to make your farewells, and then we're gonna get you. Come on, then, open up! You're mad, it's like you want to die! I reckon he's a plant, he was only brought in to stir things up. The Doctor, please leave the Big Brother house. Come on, then! Disintegrate me! Come on, what are you waiting for? He's mad, he's bonkers. I told you to keep an eye on him, not kill him. He damaged the property, it's an automatic process. Eviction in five, four. . . three, two. . . one! Ha-ha, I knew it! Do you see? Someone brought me into this game. If they wanted me dead, they could've transmatted me into a volcano. What did you do? Nothing, it's like. . .some sort of override. Maybe the security isn't as tight this end. Are you following this? I'm getting out! Come with me. We're not allowed! Stay in there, you've got a 50/50 chance of disintegration. Stay with me, I promise I'll get you out alive, come on! No, I can't. . .I can't. Lynda, you're sweet. >From what I've seen of your world, do you think anybody votes for sweet? Hold on. . .I've been here before. This is Satellite Five. No guards. That makes a change. You'd think a big business like Satellite Five would be armed to the teeth. No-one's called it Satellite Five in ages. It's the Game Station now. It hasn't been Satellite Five in about 100 years. 100 years exactly. It's the year 200100. I was here before, Floor 139. The satellite was broadcasting news channels back then. I had a bit of trouble upstairs, nothing too serious. Easy, gave 'em a hand, home in time for tea. 100 years ago? What, you were here 100 years ago? Yep. You're looking good on it. I moisturise. Funny sort of readings. All kinds of energy. The place is humming. It's weird. This goes way beyond normal transmissions. What would they need all that power for? I don't know, I think we're the first ever contestants to get outside. I had two friends with me, they must've got caught in the same transmat, where would they be? They could have been allocated anywhere, there's 100 different games. Like what? Well, there's ten floors of Big Brother, there's a different house behind each door, and beyond that there's all sorts of shows, it's non-stop. There's, em. . .Call My Bluff with real guns, Countdown where you've got 30 seconds to stop the bomb going off. Ground Force, which is a nasty one, you get turned into compost. Erm. . .Wipeout, speaks for itself, oh, and Stars In Their Eyes, literally, stars in their eyes - if you don't sing, you get blinded. And you watch this stuff? Everyone does. How come you don't? I never paid for my licence. Oh, my God, you get executed for that! Let 'em try. You keep saying things that don't make sense. Who are you, though, Doctor, really? It doesn't matter. Well, it does to me. I've just put my life in your hands. I'm a traveller wandering past. Believe it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life. So. . .if we get out of here, what are you gonna do, just. . .wander off again? Fast as I can. Cos, em. . .I could come with ya. Maybe you could. I wouldn't get in the way. I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y. But first of all we've gotta concentrate on the getting out, and to do that, you've got to know your enemy. Who's controlling it? Who's in charge of the satellite now? Hold on. . . Your lords and masters. OK, you win, the Controller's got to handle this. Archive makes a record of all transmat activities. Find out how he got on board. Archive Six. Controller. . . we have a problem. Continue working. We have a security problem. Continue working. I'm sorry, but I can't. We have contestants outside the games, but the alarms haven't gone off. No security, the games continue. We can't just let them wander. They are no-one. They are no-one. I'm sorry, I was just, erm. . . Archive Six is out of bounds. But I need to check the transmat log. Archive Six is out of bounds. No-one may enter Archive Six. Return to work. Return to work. Inform all staff, solar flares in delta point seven. 19, 20. . . Compatible systems. . . Just align the wave signature. . . That-a-boy! Got myself a gun! Well, ladies, the pleasure was all mine, which is the only thing that matters in the end. Two hearts, that's him. Which floor? Blimey! I've never seen it for real before, not from orbit. Planet Earth! What's happened to it? It's always been like that, ever since I was born. See there? That's the Great Atlantic Smog Storm. We get newsflashes, telling us when it's safe to breathe outside. So the population just sits there. Half the world's too fat, half's too thin, and you lot just watch telly. 10, 000 channels, all beaming down from here. The human race! Brainless sheep, being fed on a diet of. . . Mind you, have they still got that programme where three people live with a bear? Oh, Bear With Me, I love that one! And me. The celebrity edition where the bear got in the bath. . . But it's all gone wrong, I mean, history's gone wrong, again! This should be the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. I don't understand. Last time I was here I put it right. No, but that's when it first went wrong, 100 years ago, like you said. All the news channels, they just shut down overnight. But that was me. I did that. There was nothing left in their place, no information. The whole planet froze. The government, the economy, they collapsed. That was the start of it, 100 years of hell. Oh, my. . . I made this world. That leaves Rose and Rodrick, you're going head-to-head. Let's play. . .the Weakest Link! That's the end of tactical voting. You're on your own now. Hey, handsome, good to see you. Any sign of Rose? Can't you track her down? She must be still inside the games, all the rooms are shielded. If I can get inside this computer. She's got to be here somewhere. Hurry, these games don't have a happy ending. You think I don't know that? ! There you go. Patch that in, it's programmed to find her. Thanks. Hey, there. Hello! Captain Jack Harkness. Lynda Moss. Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss. Do you mind flirting outside? I was just saying hello! For you, that's flirting. I'm not complaining. Muchas gracias. Not compatible! This stupid system doesn't make sense! This place should be a basic broadcaster, but the systems are twice as complicated. It's more than TV, this station's transmitting something else. Like what? I don't know. This whole Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me. Someone's manipulating my entire life, it's some sort of trap, and Rose is stuck inside it. Rose, in geography, the Grand Central Ravine is named after which ancient British city? Is it York? No, the correct answer is Sheffield. Found her! Floor 407. Oh, my God, she's with the Anne-droid, get her out of there! Rodrick, in literature, the author of Lucky was Jackie who? Stewart. No, the correct answer is Collins. Rose, the oldest inhabitant of the Isop Galaxy is the face of what? Boe! The Face of Boe! That is the correct answer. Come on! Come on! Rodrick, in history who was the president of the Red Velvets? Hoshbin Frane. That is correct. Rose, food, the dish gaffabeque originated on which planet? Em. . .is it. . . ? Mars? No, the correct answer is Lucifer. Rodrick, which measurement of length is said to have been defined by the Emperor Jate as the distance from his nose to his fingertip? Would that be a goffle? No, the correct answer is a paab. Rose, in fashion, Stella Pok Baint is famous for what? Shoes. No. The correct answer is hats. Rodrick. . . Game Room Six, which one is it? Over here! San Hazeldine. No, the correct answer is San Chen. Let me blast it open. You can't, it's a vital combination. Rose, in history, which Icelandic city hosted Murder Spree 20? Reykjavik? No, the correct answer is Pola Ventura. Oh, my God! I've done it! You've lost! Cone on, come on, come on! Rodrick. . . I'm not mean to be here. . .you ARE the strongest link. I need to find the Doctor, he's gotta be here somewhere! He wouldn't just leave me! Thank you so much. This game is illegal, I'm telling you to stop! Rose! Stop this game! I order you to stop this game! You are the weakest link. . . . Look out for the Anne-droid, it's armed! A-a-a-a-ah! What the hell did you do to her? I'm calling security, you have no permission to be here. Deactivate the Anne-droid. You killed her and all you're worried about money? ! Back off, mister! Back off! Control, I'm overriding your commands, I need security, and I need it here right now! It's that lot. . . Leave him alone! Sir, put down the gun or I'll have to shoot. You killed her! Your stupid freaking game show killed her! Sir, I'm arresting you under Private Legislation 16 of the Game Station Syndicate. . . HIS VOICE FADES OUT Can you tell us the purpose of this device, sir? Can you tell us how you got on board? Just leave him alone. I'm asking him. Sir? Can you tell us who you are? You will be taken from this place to the lunar penal colony, to be held without trial. You may not appeal against this sentence. Is that understood? Let's do it. Oh, my God, now we're in trouble. Floor 500. ALARM SOUNDS Clear the floor! He's on his way up here. . . with a gun! This is an emergency, close down the lift. All staff are reminded that solar flares commence. . . Never mind solar flares, he's gonna kill you! OK, move away from the desk. Nobody try anything clever. Everybody clear, stand to the side and stay there. Who's in charge of this place? 19, 20. . . This satellite's more than a game station. 79, 80. . . Who killed Rose Tyler? All staff are reminded. . . I want an answer! She can't reply. Don't shoot! Oh, don't be so thick, like I was ever gonna shoot. Captain, we've got more guards on the way up, secure the exits. Yes, sir! What were you saying? But. . .I've got your gun. OK, so shoot me. Why can't she answer? She's, erm. . . Can I put this down? If you want, just hurry up. Thanks. Sorry, erm. . . The Controller is linked into the transmissions, the entire output goes through her brain. You're not a member of staff, so she doesn't recognise your existence. What's her name? I don't know. She was installed when she was five years old, that's the only life she's ever known. Doors sealed, we're safe for about ten minutes. Keep an eye on 'em. That stuff about something going on with the Game Station, I think you're right. I've kept a log, unauthorised transmats, encrypted signals. It's been going on for years. Show me. You're not allowed in there, Archive Six is out of bounds. Do I look like an out-of-bounds sort of guy? What the hell. . . ? Solar flare activity in delta. . . If you're not holding us hostage, let us out, the staff are terrified! That's the same staff who execute hundreds of contestants? We're just doing our jobs. With that sentence you just lost the right to even talk to me, now back off! That's just the solar flares. They interfere with the broadcast signal, so this place automatically powers down. Planet Earth gets a few repeats. It's all quite normal. Doctor. . . Doctor? Whatever it is, you can wait. I think she wants you. Doctor. . . Doctor. . . Where's the Doctor? I'm here. I can't see, blind. . . So blind, all my life blind. All I can see is numbers, but I saw you. What do you want? Solar flares hiding me, they can't hear me. My masters listen, but they can't hear me now, the sun, the sun is so bright. Who are your masters? They wired my head, the name is forbidden. They control my thoughts, my masters, I had to be careful. They monitor transmission. but they don't watch the programmes. I could hide you inside the games. My friend died inside your games. It doesn't matter. Don't you dare tell me that! They've been hiding, my masters, hiding in the dark space, watching and shaping the Earth, so. . .so. . .so many years. Always been there, guiding humanity, hundreds and hundreds of years. Who are they? They wait and plan and grow in numbers, they're strong now, so strong, my masters. Who are they? But speak of you. My masters, they fear the Doctor. Tell me! Who are they? When's the next solar flare? Two years' time. Fat lot of good that is! Found the Tardis. We're not leaving now. No, but the Tardis worked it out. You'll wanna watch this. Lynda, could you stand over there for me, please? I just wanna go home. It'll only take a second, could you stand in that spot? Quick as you can! Everybody watching? OK, three, two, one. But you killed her! Oh, do you think? What the hell was that? It's a transmat beam, not a disintegrator, a secondary transmat system. People don't get killed in the games, they get transported across Space. Doctor, Rose is still alive! No, it can't be. I saw you die! She's out there somewhere! Doctor! Coordinates 5.6.1. Don't, the solar flare's gone, they'll hear you! No, my masters, no, I defy you! Sigma 7. . . A-a-a-ah! They took her. Oh, my masters. . . you can kill me. . . for I have brought your destruction. Look, use that. It might contain the final numbers, I kept a log of all the unscheduled transmissions. Nice. . .Thanks. Captain Jack Harkness, by the way. I'm Davitch Pavale. Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale. There's a time and a place. Are you saying that this whole set-up's been a disguise all along? Going way back, installing the Jagrafess 100 years ago. Someone's been playing a long game, controlling the human race from behind the scenes for generations. Click on this. The transmat delivers to that point, right on the edge of the solar system. But there's nothing there. It looks like nothing because that's what this satellite does. Underneath the transmission there's another signal. Doing what? Hiding whatever's out there. Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanner. There's something's sitting right on top of Planet Earth, but it's completely invisible. If I cancel the signal. . . That's impossible. I know those ships. They were destroyed. Obviously, they survived. Who did? Who are they? 200 ships. More than 2, 000 on board each one. That's just about half a million of them. Half a million what? Daleks. Alert! Alert! We are detected! It is the Doctor! He has located us! Open communications channel! The female will stand! Stand! I will talk to the Doctor. Oh, will you? That's nice, hello! The Dalek stratagem nears completion. The fleet is almost ready. You will not intervene. Oh, really? Why's that, then? We have your associate. You will obey or she will be exterminated. No. Explain yourself. I said "no". What is the meaning of this negative? It means no. But she will be destroyed! No. . .cos this is what I'M gonna do. I'm gonna rescue her, I'm gonna save Rose Tyler from the middle of the Dalek fleet, and then I'm gonna save the Earth, and then just to finish off, I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky! But you have no weapons, no defences, no plan! Yeah. . . and doesn't that scare you to death? Rose? Yes, Doctor? I'm coming to get you. The Doctor is initiating hostile action! The statagem must advance! Begin the invasion of Earth! The Doctor will be exterminated! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Launch missiles, exterminate. We've got incoming! This is it, ladies and gentlemen, we are at war. There's an army about to invade this station. Defences have gone off-line. I'm dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape. I'm dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape. They interfere with the broadcast signal, so this place automatically powers down. How did you survive the Time War?
