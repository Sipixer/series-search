my old hand's very excited about it! I thought that was just some freaky alien thing! You telling me it's yours? Well... It got cut off. He grew a new one. You are completely...impossible! Not impossible...just a bit unlikely. Why would the TARDIS bring us here? Oh, I love this bit. Thought you wanted to go home. I know, but all the same... It's that feeling you get... Like you've swallowed a hamster? Don't move! Drop your weapons! We're not armed! Look, no weapons, never any weapons, we're safe. Look at their hands. They're clean. All right. Process them. Him first. Oi. Oi! What's wrong with clean hands? What's going on? Leave him alone! Something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure. Aarrgh! What're you doing to him?! Everyone gets processed! It's taken a tissue sample. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! And extrapolated it. Some kind of accelerator? Are you all right? What on earth? That's just... Arm yourself. Where did she come from? From me. From you?! How? Who is she?! Well, she's... Well... She's my daughter. Hello, Dad! Doctor Who - 4x06 "The Doctor's Daughter" Transcript: evarin Update: LauCass ~ Bad Wolf Team ~ ~ www.seriessub.com ~ You primed to take orders, ready to fight? Instant mental download of strategic and military protocols, sir. Generation 5000 Soldier. I'm ready. Did you say daughter? Mmm. Technically. Technically how? Progenation. Reproduction from a single organism. You take a sample of diploid cells, split them into haploids, then recombine them in a different arrangement...and grow. Very quickly, apparently! Something's coming! It's the Hath! Get down! We have to blow the tunnel! Get the detonator! I'm not detonating anything! Blow the thing! Martha! No! Don't! You've sealed off the tunnel. Why did you do that?! They were trying to kill us! But they've got my friend. Collateral damage. At least you've still got her. He lost both his men. Her name's Martha, and she's not collateral damage, not for anyone! Have you got that, GI Jane?! I'm going to find her. You're going nowhere. You don't make sense, you two, no guns, no marks, no fight in you... I'm taking you to General Cobb! Now, move. Hold on, I've got you, is it your arm, yeah? GURGLING Is that a yes? Let me examine it. Keep still. Still, yeah? No move! Half fish, half human, how'm I supposed to know? Is that a shoulder? Feels like a shoulder! I think it's dislocated. I'm trying to help him. I am a doctor, and he is my patient, and I'm not leaving him. Now, this is gonna hurt. One, two, three. Now, then. I'm Doctor Martha Jones. Who the hell are you? I'm Donna. What's your name? Don't know. It's not been assigned. Well, if you don't know that, what do you know? How to fight. Nothing else? The machine must embed military history and tactics but no name. She's a generated anomaly. Generated anomaly? Jenny-rated. Well, what about that? Jenny! Jenny. Yeah, I like that, Jenny. What d'you think, "Dad"? Good as anything, I suppose. Not what you'd call a natural parent, are you? They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it. It's not what I'd call natural parenting. Rubbish. You can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident. Er, Child Support Agency can. Just because I share physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle, does it? I'm not a monkey! Or a child. So where are we? What planet's this? Messaline. Well, what's left of it. 663 - 75 deceased. Generation 6671 extinct... Generation 6672 - 46 deceased. Generation 6680 - 14 deceased. But...this is a theatre! Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon. It's like a town, or a city, But why? General Cobb, I presume? Found in the western tunnels, I'm told, with no marks. There was an outbreak of pacifism in the Eastern Zone, three generations back, before we lost contact, is that where you came from? Eastern Zone, yeah. I'm the Doctor. This is Donna. And I'm Jenny. Don't think you can infect us with your peacemaking. We're committed to the fight. I can't stay anyway, gotta go and find my friend. That's not possible. All movement is regulated. We're at war. Yes. I noticed. With the Hath. But tell me, cos we got a bit out of circulation, Eastern Zone and all that, so...who exactly are the Hath? Back at the dawn of this planet, these ancient halls were carved from the earth. Our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning, a colony where Human and Hath would work and live together. So what happened? The dream died - broken, along with Hath promises. They wanted it all for themselves. But the early pioneers fought back. They used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists, and began this battle for survival. There's nothing but earth outside, why's that? Why build underground? The surface is too dangerous. Then why build windows? And what does this mean? The rites and symbols of our ancestors. The meanings...lost in time. How long's this war gone on for? Longer than anyone can remember. Countless generations, marked only by the dead. What, fighting all this time? Because we must. Every child of the machine is born with this knowledge. It's our inheritance. It's all we know. How to fight. And how to die. Right... So, we're here? Does this show the entire city? Including the Hath zones? Yes. Why? Well, it'll help us find Martha. We've more important things to do. The Progenation Machines are powered down, but we could breed a whole platoon from you two. I'm not having sons and daughters by some great big machine! Sorry, no offence, but you're not real. You're no better than him! I have a body, I have a mind, I have independent thought, how am I not real? What makes you better than me? Well said. We need more like you if ever we're to find the Source. Ooh, the Source, what's that then? I like a Source, what is it? The Breath of Life. And that would be? In the beginning, the Great One breathed life into the universe. Then she looked at what she'd done and she sighed. She? I like that. Right, so it's a creation myth. It's not myth. It's real. That sigh, it was caught and kept as the Source. It was lost when the war started. But it's here, somewhere. Whoever holds the Source controls the destiny of this planet. Ah! I thought so. There's a suppressed layer of information in this map. If I can just... What is it? See? A whole complex of tunnels, hidden from sight. Hold on, look! That must be the lost temple. The Source will be inside. You've shown us the way! And we're closer than the Hath! It's ours! That's a new map. There's a different set of tunnels. Tell them to prepare to move out. We'll progenate new soldiers on the morning shift, then we march! Once we reach the Temple, peace will be restored at long last. If you really wanted peace, couldn't you just stop fighting? Only when we have the Source. It'll give us the power to erase every stinking Hath from the face of this planet. A second ago, it was peace in our time, now you're talking genocide?! For us, that means the same thing. Then you need a better dictionary! Look up genocide. You'll see a picture of me there and the caption will read "over my dead body"! You're the one who showed us the path to victory. But you can consider the irony from your prison cell. Cline, at arms! Oi oi! All right! Cool the beans, Rambo. Take them. And if you try anything, Doctor, I'll see that your woman dies first. I am not his woman! W-We're not a couple! Come on. This way. I'm going to stop you, Cobb. I have an army and the breath of god on my side. What'll you have? This. Lock them up. What about the new soldier? Can't trust her. She's from pacifist stock. Take them all! But I didn't do anything! I think I just started a war. More numbers. They've gotta mean something. Makes as much sense as the breath of life story. You mean that's not true? No. It's a myth. Isn't it, Doctor? Yes. But there could be something real in that temple, something that's become a myth. A weapon? So the Source could be a weapon and we've given directions to Captain Nutjob? Oh, yes. Not good, is it? We need to get out of here, find Martha and stop Cobb from slaughtering the Hath. What, what are you... What are you staring at? You keep insisting you're not a soldier. But look at you. Drawing up strategies like a proper general. No, I'm trying to stop the fighting. Isn't every soldier? Well. I suppose. But...that's...that's... Donna, give me your phone! Time for an upgrade! You've got a weapon! It's not a weapon! You're using it to fight back! I'm gonna learn so much from you, you are such a soldier! Donna, will you tell her? Oh, you are speechless, I'm loving this! You keep on, Jenny! Doctor? Martha! You're alive! Oh, am I glad to hear your voice! Are you all right? I'm with Donna, we're fine, what about you? And Jenny, she's fine too! Yes, all right, and Jenny... That's the woman from the machine, the soldier, my daughter, except she isn't... Anyway! Where are you? I'm in the Hath camp. I'm OK. But something's going on. The Hath are marching off to some place that appeared on this map. Ohhh... That was me. If both armies are heading that way, there's going to be a bloodbath. What do you want me to do? Just stay where you are. But I can help. PHONE BEEPS Doctor? Doctor! The doors that have been closed will be open to us now. The door to the Temple, to the Source, and to Victory! Come the dawn cycle we march. CHANTING They're getting ready to move out. We have to get past that guard. I can deal with him. No, no. You're not going anywhere. What? You belong here. With them. She belongs with us. With you. She's your daughter! She's a soldier. She came out of that machine! I know! Have you got that stethoscope? Give it to me. Come on! What're you doing? It's all right. Just hold still. Come here. Listen. And then tell me where she belongs. Two hearts. Exactly. What's going on? Does that mean she's a...? What do you call a female Time Lord? What's a Time Lord? It's who I am. It's where I'm from. And I'm from you. You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more. A sum of knowledge. A code. A shared history. A shared suffering. Only it's gone now. All of it. Gone forever. What happened? There was a war. Like this one? And you fought? And killed? Yes. Then how are we different? I need to charge it up, I need power, d'you understand? There's even more! In 3D! Oh, you're a clever Hath! So this is where everybody's headed? But look... those tunnels sort of zig-zag. If I went up and over the surface in a straight line, I'd get there first. Why not? Are these the readings for the surface? It doesn't look too bad. Nitrogen and oxygen about 80:20. That's fine. Ozone levels are high. And some big radiation spikes. But as long as I'm not out there too long. I have to find my friends. Come on, then. Hey. I'm not supposed to talk to you. I'm on duty. I know. Guarding me. So does that mean I'm dangerous? Or that I need protecting? Protecting from what? Oh, I don't know. Men like you? Keep quiet and open the door. I'd like to see you try that! Let me distract this one. I have picked up a few womanly wiles over the years. Let's save your wiles for later. In case of emergency. I was gonna distract him, not clobber him! Well, it worked! They must all have a copy of that new map. Just stay there, don't hurt anyone. You can stay down here and live your whole life in the shadows. It's up to you. But nothing's gonna stop me. I knew you couldn't resist it. Er, language! ..Come on. It was the girl. She tricked me. They got away. I'm sorry. I waited all my life for this moment. No-one is going to get in my way. Certainly not this Doctor. At arms! We march! To war! Wait! The hidden tunnel. There must be a control panel. It's another one of those numbers. They're everywhere. The original builders must've left them. Some old cataloguing system. You got a pen? Bit of paper? Cos, d'you see, the numbers are counting down. This one ends in 1-4, the prison cell said 1-6. Always thinking, both of you. Who are you people? I told you. I'm the Doctor. The Doctor? That's it? That's all he ever says. No. Oh, come off it! You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever met! Here it is! And Time Lords, what are they for exactly? "For"? They're not... They're not "for" anything. So what do you do? I travel. Through time and space. He saves planets, rescues civilisations. defeats terrible creatures. And runs a lot. Seriously, there's an outrageous amount of running involved. Got it! Squad 5, with me! Now, what were you saying about running? That's not mood lighting, is it? No, I didn't think so. Arming device. There's more of these. Always eight numbers, counting down, the closer we get... Here we go! You better be quick! The General! Where are you going? I can hold them up. No, we don't need any more dead. It's them or us. It doesn't mean you have to kill them! But I'm trying to save your life! Listen to me, the killing, after a while it infects you. And once it does you're never rid of it. But we don't have a choice. We always have a choice. I'm sorry. Jenny! This door! Now! There she is! I told you. Nothing but a soldier. She's trying to help. Jenny! Come on! I'm coming. Ceasefire! Ceasefire! That's it! Jenny! Leave it! Let's go! You're a child of the machine. You're on my side. Join us! Join us in the war against the Hath. It's in your blood, girl, don't deny it. Jenny! Come on! That's it! Hurry up! No, no, no, no! The circuit's looped back! Zap it back again! The controls are back there! They're coming! Wait! J-Just...! There isn't...! Jenny, I can't! I'll have to manage on my own. Watch and learn, Father! No way! That was impossible! Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely! Brilliant! You were brilliant! Brilliant! I didn't kill General Cobb. I could have, but I didn't. You were right. I had a choice. Spread out! I warned you, Cobb. If the Source is a weapon, I'm gonna make sure you never use it. One of us is gonna die today and it won't be me. It can't be much further. Help me! I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Help me! Peck! Help me! Help me, Peck! I'm sinking! It's no good. Aah! Aah! Noooo! No-oo-o! So, you travel together, but you're not "together"? What? No, no! No way! No, no. We're friends. That's all. We're not even the same species. And what's it like, the travelling? Never a dull moment. Can be terrifying, brilliant and funny - sometimes all at the same time. I've seen some amazing things though. Whole new worlds. Oh, I'd love to see new worlds. You will. Won't she, Doctor? Hm? Do you think Jenny'll see any new worlds? I suppose so. You mean... You mean, you'll take me with you? We can't leave you here, can we? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on! Let's get a move on! Careful, there might be traps! Kids! They never listen! Oh, I know that look. See it a lot round our way. Blokes with pushchairs and frowns. You've got dad-shock. Dad-shock? Sudden, unexpected fatherhood. Take a bit of getting used to. No, it's not that. Well, what is it then? Having Jenny in the TARDIS is that it? What's she gonna do, cramp your style? Like you've got a sports car and she'll turn it into a people-carrier? Donna, I've been a father before. What? I lost all that a long time ago. Along with everything else. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? You talk all the time, but you don't say anything. I know. I'm just... When I look at her now I can see them. The hole they left. All the pain that filled it. I just don't know if I can face that every day. It won't stay like that. She'll help you. We both will. But when they died, that part of me died with them. It'll never come back. Not now. I tell you something, Doctor, something I've never told you before. I think you're wrong. They've blasted through the beams. Time to run again! Love the running! Yeah? Love the running. We're trapped. Can't be. This must be the temple. This is a door. And again! We're down to 1-2 now... I've got it! I can hear them! Nearly done. These can't be a cataloguing system. They're getting closer! Get back! They're too similar. Too familiar. Not yet. Now! Got it! They're coming! Close the door! That was close! No fun otherwise! It's not what I'd call a temple... It looks more like... Fusion-drive transport. It's a spaceship! The original one? The one the first colonists arrived in? Could be, but the power cells would have run down after all that time. This one's still powered-up and functioning. Come on! It's the Hath! That door's not gonna last much longer. If General Cobb gets through down there, war's gonna break out. Look, look, look, look, look! Ship's log! "First wave of Human - Hath co-colonisation of Messaline". It is the original ship. What happened? "Phase one. Construction." They used robot drones to build the city. But, does it mention the war? Final entry... "Mission commander dead. "Still no agreement on who should assume leadership. "Hath and humans divided into factions." That must be it! A power vacuum. The crew divided into two factions and turned on each other. Start using the progenation machines and you've got two armies fighting a never-ending war! Two armies who are now both outside. Look at that. It's like the numbers in the tunnels. No, no, no, no. But listen... I spent six months working as a temp in Hounslow Library, and I mastered the Dewey Decimal System in two days flat. I'm good with numbers! It's staring us in the face! What is? It's the date! Assuming the first two numbers are some big old space date, then you've got year, month, day. It's the other way round, like it is in America! Ohhh! It's the New Byzantine Calendar! The codes are completion dates for each section. They finish it, they stamp the date on! So the numbers aren't counting down, they're going out, from here, day by day, as the city got built. Yes! Oh, good work, Donna! Yeah! But you're still not getting it. The first number I saw back there, was 6012-07-17. Well, look at the date today! 07-24. No! What does it mean? Seven days? That's it! Seven days! Just seven days?! What d'you mean, seven days? Seven days since war broke out. This war started seven days ago! Just a week! A week! They said years! No. They said generations. If they're all like you, products of those machines... They could have 20 generations in a day! Each generation gets killed, passes on the legend! Ohhh! Donna, you're a genius! All the buildings, they're in ruins. They're not ruined! They're just empty! Waiting to be populated! Ohh, they've mythologised their entire history! The Source must be part of that too. Doctor! Martha! I should've known you wouldn't stay away from the excitement! Donna!! Oooh, you're filthy, what happened?! I, erm, took the surface route. That's the general! We haven't much time. We don't know what we're looking for! Is it me, or can you smell flowers? Yes! Bougainvillea! I say we follow our nose! GENERAL: Blocks 7 to 10, advance! With me! Oh, yes! Yes! Isn't this brilliant? Is that the Source? It's beautiful. What is it? Terraforming! It's a third generation terraforming device! So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens? Because that's what it does. All this only bigger. Much bigger! It's in a transit state. Producing this must help keep it stable before they finally... Stop! Hold your fire! What is this? Some kind of trap? I want this war won. You can't win. No-one can. You don't even know why you're here. Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers. Getting more distorted the more it's passed on. This is the Source. This is what you're fighting over. A device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem. It's nothing mystical. It's from a laboratory, not some creator. It's a bubble of gases. A cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution. Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids. It's used to make barren planets habitable. Look around you! It's not for killing. It's bringing life. If you allow it, it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight! No more fighting. No more killing. I'm the Doctor and I declare this war is over! What's happening? The gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process. What does that mean? It means a new world. No! Jenny! Jenny! Talk to me, Jenny! Is she gonna be all right? (A new world.) It's beautiful. Jenny? Be strong, now. You need to hold on. D'you hear me? We've got things to do, you and me. Eh? Eh? We can go anywhere. Everywhere. You choose. That sounds good. You're my daughter and we've only just got started. You're gonna be great. You're gonna be more than great. You're gonna be amazing. You hear me? Jenny? Two hearts. Two hearts, she's like me. If we wait... If we just wait... There's no sign, Doctor. There's no regeneration. She's like you, but... Maybe not enough. No. Too much. That's the truth of it. She was too much like me. I never would. Have you got that? I never would. When you start this new world... ..this world of Human and Hath... ..remember that. Make the foundation of this society a man who never would. It's happening. The terraforming. Build a city, nice and safe underground. Strip away the top soil. And there it is. And what about Jenny? Let us give her a proper ceremony. I think it would help us. Please. Jenny was the reason for the TARDIS bringing us here. It just got here too soon, which then created Jenny in the first place. Paradox. An endless paradox. Time to go home? Yeah. Home. You sure about this? Yeah, positive. I can't do this any more. You'll be the same one day. Not me. Never! How could I ever go back to normal life after seeing all this? I'm gonna travel with that man for ever. Good luck. And you. We're making a habit of this. Yeah. And you'd think it'd get easier. All those things you've been ready to die for. I thought for a moment there you'd finally found something worth living for. Oh... There's always something worth living for, Martha. Bye, Doctor. Goodbye. Dr Jones. Hello, boys. The shuttle! Jenny? What're you doing? Come back! Sorry. Can't stop. What you gonna do, tell my dad? But where are you going?! Ohh, I've got the whole universe! Planets to save, civilisations to rescue, creatures to defeat. And an awful lot of running to do. Agatha Christie. What about her? That's me. Noooooooo! Murder! Chief Inspector Smith from Scotland Yard, known as The Doctor. Miss Noble is the plucky young girl who helps me. I say! There's a murder, a mystery and Agatha Christie. So? It happens to me all the time. Show yourself, demon! There's nowhere to run. The thrill is in the chase,
