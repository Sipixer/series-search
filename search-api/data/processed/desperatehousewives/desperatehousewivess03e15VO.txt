WEREN'T YOU THERE? NO, I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING! I JUST WOKE UP, AND HE WAS IN BED NEXT TO ME. THANKS AGAIN, GABY. HEY, CARLOS. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER, THEN HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT YOU AND ZACH HAD SEX? WELL, WE WERE BOTH HALF-NAKED, AND--AND THERE WAS A CONDOM WRAPPER. AND HE SAID I WAS AMAZING, WHICH TOTALLY SOUNDS LIKE ME. HE THINKS WE'RE A COUPLE NOW. YOU HAVE TO HELP ME. (laughs) I AM NOT GETTING INVOLVED. GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BAGGED ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD KID. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO WARN THE SCAVO BOYS. I WANNA SPEAK TO MY WIFE. SHE'S RESTING. IF WE CAN GET BACK TO THESE QUESTIONS... I FELL OFF A ROOF. I NEED A PHYSICIAN, NOT A PSYCHIATRIST. WELL, I'M AFRAID IT'S HOSPITAL POLICY WHEN THERE'S A SUSPECTED SUICIDE ATTEMPT. I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL MYSELF. BUT YOU DO HAVE A CERTAIN... HISTORY? YOU SPENT MOST OF 1976 IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. I DON'T CARE TO DISCUSS THAT. YOU WON'T BE LEAVING HERE UNTIL WE DO. MY PARENTS WERE VERY REGIOUS. WHEN I WAS 16, MY FHER HAD AN AFFAIR, CAUSED QUITE A SCANDAL AT OUR CHURCH. (Orson) HE BECAME DEPRESSED. HE STARTED DRINKING HEAVILY. MY MOTHER GREW CONCERNED. SHE DIDN'T LIKE LEAVING HIM ALONE. ONE NIGHT, SHE HAD TO VISIT A SICK FRIEND, AND SHE ASKED ME TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. BUT I HAD MADE PLANS WITH FRIENDS. I THOUGHT I COULD DUCK OUT FOR A WHILE. WHEN I GOT HOME, I FOUND HIM IN THE BATHROOM. YOU BLAMED YOURSELF? AH, I DIDN'T NEED TO. MOTHER BLAMED ME ENOUGH FOR BO OF US. THAT MUST HAVE CAUSED QUITE A STRAIN IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP. YES. BUT NOW AND THEN, SHE SUGGESTS LITTLE WAYS I MIGHT MAKE IT UP TO HER. YES, I'M CALLING TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF A PATIENT. LAST NAME HODGE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WHICH HODGE"? GLORIA! THANK GOD. I THOUGHT YOU'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME. WHEN ARE YOU LETTING ME OUT OF HERE? IT WON'T BE LONG NOW. IN FACT, SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. ORSON TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF. OH, MY GOODNESS. IS HE OKAY? HE'LL BE FINE. MY POINT IS, SUICIDE IS HARDLY THE ACT OF A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN. GLORIA, FOR GOD SAKE, GIVE IT UP. HE DOESN'T LOVE ME. HE WILL, DEAR. BREE WILL BE GONE SOON, AND HE'LL NEED A GOOD WOMAN LIKE YOU TO CONSOLE HIM. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO BREE? (Alma) GLORIA? GLORIA? OH, HEY, HON. HEY. DID YOU GET SOME SLEEP? YES. I'M STILL KIND OF GROGGY FROM THOSE PILLS, BUT... AND NOW I'M AWAKE. OKAY, LITTLE MIX-UP WITH THE NEW CHAIRS. WHICH <i>YOU</i> WERE IN CHARGE OF. OKAY, OKAY, WE COULD POINT FINGERS, BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS FORGETTING ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECTED AND FOCUSING ON WHAT WE HAVE, WHICH ISN'T SO BAD. I MEAN, ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHAIRS GIVE THE PLACE A KIND OF BOHEMIAN VIBE. PLUS, IF WE GET A LOT OF BABIES-- LOOK, WE'RE JUST TOTALLY SET. TOM, I'M SORRY. I AM. I'M SORRY. I JUST--I REALIZE IT'S NOT... PERFECT. BUT... PLEASE SAY SOMETHING. WHAT CAN I SAY, LYNETTE? IT IS WHAT IT IS. WHY DO <i>I</i> HAVE TO BABYSIT MOM? ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE AT THE OPENING. AUSTIN WAS GONNA SNEAK US BEER! DAMN IT, DANIELLE, I HAVE TO WORK! OUR MOTHER'S LYING HELPLESS UPSTAIRS 'CAUSE HER HUSBAND TRIED TO KILL HER. NOW FOR JUST ONE NIGHT, COULD YOU TRY TOE RESPONSIBLE? I LIKED YOU BETTER WHEN YOU WERE A PSYCHOPATH! HERE YOU GO. AH. WOW, YOU'RE... HERE. I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT LYNETTE AND TOM. UH, LOOK, ZACH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK ABOUT US. ME, TOO. YOU, UH, BEING IN MY LIFE NOW, HAVING THE CONNECTION THAT WE DO, THIS IS REALLY THE--THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HAPPY SINCE MY MOTHER KILLED HERSELF. WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME A SEND? huckles) OF COURSE, BABY. HURRY BACK. YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I AM IN <i>HELL.</i> I JUST TRIED TO BREAK UP WITH ZACH, AND THE LITTLE TWERP PLAYED THE DEAD MOMMY CARD. WELL, U CAN'T LET HIM MAKE YOU FELL GUILTY. BUT I <i>AM</i> GUILTY. I DON'T REMEMBER HOW WE ENDED UP IN BED TOGETHER. MAYBE--MAYBE I LED HIM ON. I GOTTA BE SENSITIVE HERE. COD YOU THREATEN HIM FOR ME? WHAT? YOU KNOW, INTIMIDATE HIM. DO THE WHOLE JEALOUS, LATIN EX-HUSBAND THING YOU DO. TELL HIM IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ME, NOBODY CAN. FORGET IT. I'M NOT GONNA HEY, I AM LOOKING T FOR ZACH, TOO. IF I DUMP HIM, IT'LL DESTROY HIM EMOTIONALLY. BETTER TO SCARE HIM OFF. (sighs) PLEASE? FINE. THANK YOU! OKAY, LOOK, THERE HE GOES. GO! GO GET ALL CHOLO ON HIS ASS. HEY, MR. SOLIS. HEY. LOOK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD, BUT... MR. SOLIS? WHAT? YOU WERE JUST SAYING THAT SOMETHING WAS AWKWARD? NEVER MIND. FORGET THAT I SAID ANYTHING. (urinal flushes) HEY. SO HOW'D IT GO? YOU DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH ZACH YOUNG. REALLY? DID HE TELL YOU THAT? HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. WHAT? I WAS STANDING NEXT TO HIM AT THE URINAL. I DON'T CARE HOW DRUNK YOU WERE. IF YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM, YOU'D REMEMBER. (gasps) LITTLE ZACH YOUNG? WELL, JUST HOW MUCH WOULD I HAVE REMEMBERED? UH, HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT BREE MIGHT LIKE SOME SOUP. IT'S MY OWN SPECIAL RECIPE. I'M SURPRISED TO FIND YOU HOME. I THOUGHT THE WHOLE STREET WAS GOING TO SCAVO'S TONIGHT. WELL, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO, BUT, UH, ANDREW SAID I HAD TO STAY HOME AND BABYSIT MOM. WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY. A VIBRANT YOUNG LADY LIKE YOU SHOULD BE AT THE PARTY, TURNING BOYS' HEADS. YOU GO. I'LL LOOK AFTER YOUR MOTHER. YOU MEAN IT? JUST TAKE HER DINNER UP FIRST. I DON'T THINK I CAN MANAGE THE TRAY WITH MY CANE. THANKS, GRANDMA. YOU'RE T BEST! MM. THIS SOUP SMELLS SO GOOD. YOU WANNA SCORE SOME POINTS? DON'T SAY I BROUGHT IT. TELL HER YOU MADE IT YOURSELF. HEY! HELLO? OVER HERE! AAH! HONEY, THERE IS A LINE OUT THE DOOR. WE ARE GONNA MAKE A KILLING TONIGHT. I'M HAPPY FOR YA. FOR US. NOW IT'S "US"? BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS TRYING TO RUIN EVERYTHING. HEY, LOOK, I KNOW I OVERREACTED-- YES, YOU DID. BUT I HAVE CUSTOMERS. OH! THE PLACE CAME OUT GREAT, HUH? SURE DID. LOOKS LIKE, UH, THE WHOLE STREET'S HERE. YEAH. EXCEPT FOR ORSON, WHO FELL OFF A ROOF. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUTHAT? WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

IS IT REALLY GOOD, OR ARE YOU JUST PRETENDING YOU HAD A SLICE? YOU AND I DID NOT HAVE SEX. ADMIT IT! OF COURSE WE DID. ZACH! HOW CAN YOU CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT ME AND LIE TO MY FACE? I'M SORRY. I'M TIRED OF JUST BEING YOUR FRIEND. I THOUGHT IF YOU SAW ME AS A LOVER, YOU CAN THINK OF ME AS A MAN, NOT--NOT A BOY. ZACH, A REAL MAN IS HONEST. ALL YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO DO IS BRIBE AND TRICK ME INTO FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU. A LITTLE ADVICE NEXT TIME? DON'T PLAY GAMES. JUST STAND UP AND BE THE KIND OF MAN A WOMAN WOULD BE PROUD TO SHARE HER LIFE WITH. (singsong voice) HELLO! I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME TO MAKE A TOAST. (woman) ALL RIGHT! (man) SURE! UM, TOM, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE--AH. TOM, YOU DID IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD PULL IT OFF. OKAY, WELL, MAYBE JUST ME. ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS.
