Remember what it was like To work a 60-hour week? You can't take them back. You are never going To get somebody who cares As much about finding dierdre As i do. You shot yourself? Pretty lame, huh? The damage is already done. Mom! You're not taking her Away from me. Get out. Lynette: i needed you To see something. They said they stole it >From mike's garage. Is that blood? Mary alice: bree van de kamp Believed In old-fashioned values. Things like respect for god... The importance of family... And love of country. In fact, bree believed So strongly in her values, It was always a shock Whenever she was confronted With those who didn't. It's not mine. You promised The cheating had stopped, rex. You promised. Could we not yell At each other? I'm feeling Really lousy today. I want you Out of the house! Bree, look at me. It's not mine. Well, then, Whose is it? It just didn't magically Appear in my laundry basket. Well, i'm not the only guy In this house That uses that hamper. No. Sorry. Andrew is still a child. He's 16. It's not unheard of. Honey, you have to Talk to him. And tell him what? Tell him that We found his condom, And that he is forbidden From, you know... I can absolutely tell him That we think he's too young, But i don't think It's going to do any good. Well, then, the least we can do Is go search his room, And if we find any more Of these, we'll confiscate them. And that will Accomplish what? Well, if we take away His condoms, maybe -- He's a teenage boy. We could take away his penis, He'd still try To have sex. Well, we can't Put it back in his room. I mean, that would be Like we're condoning him Having premarital sex. Bree, let me Put this another way. Do you want To become a grandmother? Yes, bree believed In old-fashioned values. But she also believed... It was better to be safe Than sorry. Mary alice: each new morning In suburbia brings with it A new set of lies. Little white lies, Told not to hurt... Morning, mrs. Petchel. You lo lovely today. But to make life More pleasant. They tell these lies To protect themselves And their reputations. Oh, for god's sake. This is unbelievable. That's the last time I do my banking online. Of course, every now and then, The day arrives When someone finally decides To tell the truth. He was shot? How could you Not tell us about this? He was embarrassed. He said it was an accident. Oh, don't look at me like that. Accidents happen. We know That you want to trust mike, But he had a dead woman's Jewelry in his garage. Now, did he? We don't know that for sure. All we know Is that lynette's kids Turned up with it. So what are you saying, That the twins murdered martha? Well, i wouldn't Put it past them. I'm saying that That is about as likely As mike having done it. He's a good guy. I know him. I mean, he's -- He's mike. Honestly, i don't think Mike did it, either, But if we don't call, We're guilty Of withholding evidence. Well, you know what? If he is innocent, This should be A simple matter to clear up. But we will do Whatever you want us to do. Okay, call. So shall i just dial 911? Well, it's not really An emergency. There was a murder. Well, not recently, and i prefer Not to tie up the line. Will you just call? [ dialing ] [ teleone rings ] [ knock on door ] H ey. My mom will be home Any minute. She'll freak If she sees you here. Oh, i just wanted To deliver this personally.

Mow your lawn, Water your flowers, Trim your bushes. I could do everything John did for you. That's very generous of you, But i don't thk so. Why? Because my husband is home Quite a lot these days.

If you cannot afford An attorney, One will be Appointed to you. So get this -- Zach young's throwing A pool party saturday night. Sent out a bunch Of formal invitations, Complete With fancy lettering. I'm surprised he didn't Spritz them with after-shave. What is wrong With nice invitations? Andrew: mom, It's a pool party. Why couldn't he have just Passed out flyers in the quad? 'Cause he's genetically Incapable of being cool? So, uh, Are you going? Mm, maybe. I mean, um, Lisa and justin -- Some of the guys thought It'd be fun to swim. We can always bail If it's as lame As we think it's going to be. Oh,  is, um, lisa your friend With the pierced navel? Yeah. You've been spending A lot of time together lately, Haven't you? I guess. Oh, uh, andrew, I'm going to want you home By 11:00 on saturday. 11:00? Mom, it's not even A school night. Bree, a curfew isn't Going to do any good. You may be able to abdicate all Your parental responsibility, But i cannot. What -- At's going on here? Would this have to do with The condom you left in my room? As a matter of fact, It does, And just so we're clear, If you get lisa pregnant, You will marry her. Ha ha. Andrew, This is not funny. Mom, trust me -- This is very funny, Mostly because The condom wasn't mine. You suck, You know that? So obviously, We need to talk. I'm still a virgin, If that's what you want to know. Well, good. But why on earth Would you need a condom? Because i'm planning On having sex, And i don't want To get pregnant. Danielle, you are president Of the abstinence club. I wasn't planning On running for a second term. John. John rowland? I thought You broke up with him. No, he broke up with me, And you want to know why? Because i wouldn't do it. Well, if that's the type of boy He is, then good riddance. Mom, every boy at my school Is that type of boy. Besides... It's different with john. I love him. Oh, sweetheart, Just because You give a boy sex Doesn't mean You'll get love in return. So maybe I'm being stupid. What's the big deal? It's just sex. Honey, i am looking out For your happiness. Now, i understand What it's like to be young And feel urges, But i waited until I got married, As did your father, And it was so much better. But daddy ended up Cheating on you. Yes, well... And ever since He moved back in, You've been miserable. Why would you say that? The walls between our bedrooms Are paper-thin. I hear more stuff Than i probably should. Oh. Look, mom, I love you a lot, But you really are The last person To ever give anyone advice About sex and happiness. Have you seen these? Five more Past due notices. Don't worry. I'm handling it. How? How are You handling this? Can i please Finish my sandwich? Have you seen Our checking account lately? We're broke. And then we have The mortgage payment coming up, We have property taxes -- Gabby, it's going To be okay. No, it's not. We are seriously screwed, And i am freaking out That you're not freaking out.
