You could ask Any of his customers, And they would tell you, There was nothing He couldn't fix. Whether it was a broken vase... A leaky pipe... Or a shaky banister, Eli always knew How to get the job done. But sadly, The man who had fixed So many things For the residents Of wisteria lane Was now about To break the hearts. Eli scruggs, Get down from there! Mrs. Mccluskey. Just found this note In my mailbox. Says you're retiring? What the hell? Yes, ma'am. It's true. Now why would you want to do Something stupid like that? My doc says I got a bum ticker, Have to take it easy From now on. Well, once i'm done fixing Mrs. Mayer's shingle I'm on a plane to waikiki. Well, this is very annoying. Who's gonna fix my water heater When it breaks? Oh, i met this young guy Named toby. Very bright, just turned 30. He'll take care of you. Ah, damn it, eli! I am not comfortable With strangers in my house. Took me ten years To trust you. I know. Most of those guys leave tools And nails all over the place. You never leave a mess. Thank you, ma'am. Have you told everyone else You're leaving? I left copies of that same note In everybody's mailbox. Well, that's not right. After all these years, people Will want to say good-Bye, And... you know, maybe throw you A party or somethin'. Oh, no. I prefer to go quietly, If you know what i mean. I don't want a big fuss. Well, i'll miss you, eli. There will never be Another one like you. With that eli scruggs Climbed his ladder For the very last time. And once he had finished Making his last repair, Eli scruggs-- Quietly, with no fuss-- Had a heart attack and died. And most importantly... Without leaving a mess. desperate.housewives s5 e13 www.1000fr.com presents Sync:FRS@ÏºÃ× wdysai mzinfo</font> It took an hour For someone to finally notice The body laying atop Susan mayer's roof.
