I'D LIKE TO PLAY BS FOR AEROSMITH. OKAY,LET'S CALL THAT THE BACKUP PLAN. BUT,SERIOUSLY,DON'T YOU HAVE  S OME ROAD NOT TAKEN, SOME DREAM YOU NEVER GOT AROUND TO? I DON'T KNMAYBE. MAYBE? I DON'T KNOW. YOU GET MARRIED. YOU HAVE KIDS AND... YOU LOSE TRACK OF THAT STUFF. WELL,THINK ABOUT IT,OKAY? CAUSE WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO, I'M IN YOUR CORNER. MAN,DID I LUCK OUT MARRYING YOU. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW. HI,MIKE. IT'S EDIE. I'M SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T COME BY TO VISIT. PRETTY ROUGH LUCK,HUH? ANYWAY,I'M,UM... HERE TO PICK UP MY CD PLAYER. SO... WELL,I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON. DAMN! AND THAT'S <i>WITH</i> THE COMA. WE ALL CARRY SOMETHING WITH US. OF COURSE,IT'S NICE IF WE TRAVEL WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP LIGHTEN THE LOAD. BUT USUALLY IT'S EASIER TO JUST DROP WHAT WE'VE BEEN CARRYING SO WE CAN GET HOME THAT MUCH SOONER... ASSUMING,OF COURSE, THERE WILL BE SOMEONE THERE TO GREET US WHEN WE ARRIVE. WHY DO WE CLUTCH AT THIS BAGGAGE EVEN WHEN WE'RE DESPERATE TO MOVE ON? BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE WE MIGHT LET GO TOO SOON. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
