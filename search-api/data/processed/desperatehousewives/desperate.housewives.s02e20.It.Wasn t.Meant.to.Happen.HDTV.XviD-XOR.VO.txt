until we can get a straight answer from the birth father. Gabrielle got exactly what she wanted. If Edie doesn't know, then that means that you just cheated on her with me. Susan got fooled again... I'm also a member of S.A. And Bree got too much... Sex addicts anonymous. - ... information. Karl Mayer didn't pray often, but when he did, it was usually to ask for God's help in breaking up with a woman and to spare him the nasty drama that usually accompanied such callous and unexpected departures. Over the years, Karl had dumped dozens of women, and not one of them had ever seen it coming. Every retreat was always meticulously planned, right down to the personalized stationary, hence his record of successful getaways from women who did not want to see him go. So when he decided to break up with Edie Britt, Karl prayed to God yet again to help him avoid all the unnecessary drama. Unfortunately for Karl... God was in the mood... to be entertained. Come on! - What the hell is this? - Edie, baby, calm down. "Let's be honest with ourselves, Edie. We haven't been happy in a long time"? Who are you to tell me I haven't been happy, you miserable son of a bitch? I have been ecstatic! Okay. I-I'm the one who hasn't been happy, then. - Then why did you propose to me? - I don't know. I have told every woman in this town that we are getting married, and all you have to say to me - is, "I don't know"? - Oh, what else do you want me to say? I'm sorry. What's going on? Is there someone else? Oh, my God. Oh, crap. Come on, come on, come on! As he sat there, Karl couldn't help but wonder why God had forsaken him. It never occurred to him that God... might be a woman. 2x20: It Wasn't Meant to Happen God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference... The members of the Fairview chapter of A.A. ended every meeting with a prayer. And while most were asking God for help in resisting temptation, Bree Van De Kamp was busy thinking thoughts that were downright sinful. ...with him in the next. Amen. Keep coming back. It works if you work it. Amen. I think you'd love the opera. The music and the voices... It's just all so... passionate. Yeah, a 300-pound soprano seducing balding tenors. - That'd be hot. - You making fun of me? Huh? - Bree... - Yes? Maybe a little bit. What's going on here? Claude? We made plans, remember? I'm sorry. I was just about... Yeah, I saw what you were just about to do. I'm sorry, Peter, but, uh, who is this? This is Claude. He's my sponsor. Oh, your A.A. sponsor? No. I'm his other sponsor. For my sex addiction. Oh. Damn it, Peter. What did I tell you? Avoid lust triggers. And what is she? Come on, don't do this, man. She's a lust trigger. A lust trigger! Um, excuse me. I don't know what that means, but could you please stop saying it? Where's your chip? Give it to me. Do you remember how low you'd sunk when we met? This represents 12 months of hard work, not giving in to your urges. Now if you wanna blow all that on this woman, just tell me now so I can stop wasting my time working with you. I don't want to blow it. Good. Then tell the pretty lady good-bye and that you can't socialize with her anymore. And do it quick. I'm hungry. Bad news. Ed wants us to push through tonight and finish the Edelstein realty pitch. But  we're not presenting for another two weeks. Why don't we start tomorrow? - But how would that help Ed avoid his marital problems? - What? Oh, he's right. I hear Ed fighting with Fran on the phone - every day through the office walls. - That would explain all our working hours. Yeah, but you lucked out, Scavo. Darlene talked him into cutting the people who have kids in day care loose. Hey, great. Let's go before he changes his mind. But  that doesn't include you, Miss senior V.P. - Ed wants you in the conference room now. - You're kidding! You're his security blanket, Lynette. He stays, you stay. Jerry, can you help me get the kids down to the car? - Oh. - Yeah. - Thanks, Jer. - Sure. - Lynette? - Yeah? Get those mock-ups together, will you? Jerry, I didn't know you had a kid. Y-yeah, um, out of wedlock. Oh. So... see you in the morning. I'm sorry I'm late. - What's going on? - Karl broke up with Edie. Oh, my God. Yeah, apparently, he was seeing someone. Really? Did he say who it was? I know who she is. She's a man-eating, scum-sucking ho-bag. No, he did not say. You know, when Karl dumped you, I thought that it was all your fault. Yeah, I figured that... you were a nag or bad in bed. But now I... now I see that you were just a victim, too. We have a bond, Susan. It's like we're sisters. There's even a pretty one and an ugly one. Edie! No, I'm just saying that Karl screwed us both. Yes, like you wouldn't believe. Guys, I'm all for bashing exes, but let's save a little of our hate for his partner in crime... - the other woman. - Mm-hmm. Yeah! You know, they're always coming up with these excuses to justify being a home-wrecker. Exactly! Like, "he wouldn't have been with me if he was gettin' it at home." Yeah, "honey, you're the love of my life. she's just the runner-up." Oh, look, the baby's doing something really cute. She's sleeping. Like an angel. Look, I think we all know that Karl is a dog. I mean, but let's face it... if these tramps weren't laying out the buffet, he wouldn't be chowing down. Well, every situation is different, and it's hard to judge until we know all the details. Which... obviously I don't know, because how would I know? She's a slutty, slutty whore. Absolutely. Yeah. Are you sure she needs that? I just put sunscreen on her. Yes,  she needs the bonnet. It completes the outfit. Oh, for God's sakes, Gaby. She's never too young to start accessorizing. Besides, all the neighbors are out today, and I want them to see how happy we are and wish they were us. Hey. Uh, the baby's a beauty. We think so, but we're a little biased. Oh, wow, she's got my eyes. Huh? Oh, I'm Dale. Dale Helm. I'm the baby's birth father. Uh, well, hi, Dale. Nice to meet you. A lot of people have been looking for you. Yeah, I know, lawyers and stuff. I got kinda held up in Florida longer than I thought. Spring break, right? Yeah. Oh, man, we were wasted 24/7. Then I got the message and just thought my friends were messing with me. Those buttwads! Ahem. Well, it's a good thing he's here. We can take him to the lawyer's office, and you can sign over full custody to us. Okay. Yeah, uh, the thing about that is, I'm gonna want the baby. Come on, you guys. We don't have to make this ugly. You're trying to take our baby! How is it not gonna be ugly? Just keep walking, Gaby. Don't engage him. - Listen, Mr. Solis... - No, you listen! We were granted custody. If you want her, you talk to the judge. - Hey, what is the holdup? - They told me I gotta talk to a judge. - What the hell are you doing here, Frank? - It's his baby. Give it to him! - Like hell! - Hey, Mrs. Solis, can I see the baby? - No! - Dale, just do it already! - I'm not just gonna kidnap it. - Why not? They did! It is your baby. Just take it! Try it. Frank? Get in, you moron. Anyways, it looks like - you're doing a good job with her. - Dumb-ass! She seems clean. And like I said, we have been very happy here, and I'm sure you will be, too. - Well, we just love it. - Yeah. Once the stairs are repaired, I'll show you the basement. What's going on? The house just sold. Start packing. Why don't you just put Caleb in an institution? - It's where he belongs anyway. - My mom would never let strangers take care of him. Then why don't you call the police? Then it's not up to her. If I call the police, my mom and I go to jail with Caleb. We've been hiding a murderer. Now, look, if we... If we do move, I promise I will call you every day. I don't need a phone buddy. I need a boyfriend! - Would you calm down, please? - Don't tell me what to do! - You know, I could go to the police myself! - Danielle... I just... I love you so much. I would do anything to keep you here. Yeah, I see that now. You can't leave me alone here. You have to think of something. Don't worry. I will. Oh, my God! Ed? Hey, I'm so sorry, but obviously that was just meant for Tom's eyes only. Honest mistake. Don't even worry about it. Okay. Thanks. Well, I'm gonna go back in my office and continue to feel like a huge pervert. At least you and Tom have a love life. Well, we do the best we can given the circumstances. Better than Fran and I. We're dead in that department. I don't wanna bore you with the details. I appreciate that. You know, Ed... I  don't wanna pry into your personal business, but if you are having problems in that area, you don't have to be resigned to it. What are you suggesting, hookers? No, Ed Ferrara doesn't pay for sex. I mean, you and Fran could spice it up a bit. You know, get the old juices flowing again. Oh, I see. Kinda like, uh... "I'd like to lick you from head to foot." Okay, well, that wasn't my best work, but you can't deny results. IMing works, and when I go home tonight, Tom and I are going to... Okay, well, I'm gonna be exhausted, so I'll probably just lay there. But trust me, Tom is gonna go to town. It's something to think about, Lord knows. You know what the sad truth is? I have been thinking about hookers. Okay! Uh, well, I hope that helped. And I'm just gonna go back and finish so we can all get out of here. Let me guess. You're not here for a bear claw. No, I'm not. You're wasting your time. Look, you don't have to worry about Peter, not while he's with me. Yeah? Why is that? Because when it comes to sex, I have an unwavering moral compass. Truly. A man could beg and plead all day long, and it wouldn't make any difference. So, since I have such strong self-control, there's really no reason for us to end our friendship. The guy's a ticking bomb. You have no idea the kind of depravity that comes with this disease. Waking up in a stranger's bed every morning... cruising the park at night, looking for somebody to get off with, compulsive masturbation every chance you get! Look, for guys like Peter and me, there's no beauty in the sex. It's an empty and ugly compulsion. Well, I am sorry, - but the Peter I know has a little more s... - Hold up. Claude, I need some... I need some help. What are you doing here? Are you using? No,  but I bought a bag. You're an embarrassment to me. Give. There's a meeting over on 10th street. You go there. You call me after. I'm sorry. Get the hell out of my shop. I'm also a sponsor at cocaine anonymous. Well, aren't you the renaissance man. Are we done here, princess? Not yet. You obviously have an encyclopedic grasp of everything depraved. But clearly, you don't have the slightest idea about the power of a loving relationship. This is all you are to Peter. Something to satisfy his addiction. Well, I think Peter is a better man than you do, - and I am not gonna let you keep us apart. - Try and stop me. Peter does everything I tell him to do. That's the one thing you can depend on with addicts: They're weak. Excuse me. Excuse me. May I ask you something? Yes,  ma'am? If a citizen, an ordinary citizen like myself, knew of someone holding a significant amount of drugs, what would my responsibilities be, you know, under the law? What's all this? And this one, I ran out and got the day I found out Karl was doing it with his secretary. I think you'll find this particularly helpful. It's got a chapter called, - "Revenge: you're only hurting yourself." - Yeah, you know, I'm just really not into the whole reading thing. Oh. Well, um, why don't we get you out of here? Let's go see a feel-good movie. Why are you being so nice to me? Well, I just wanna help. So how about that movie? You know how I like to heal? I get hammered. Uh... well, um... then I should just go and let you get started with that. Do you really wanna help me? Good. 'Cause I'm gonna need a designated driver. Oh! Uh... Okay. How could he be arrested for cocaine possession? Claude swore he was clean. It's just awful, isn't it? I mean, you never know what people are doing behind your back. Would you like some milk with your cookies? Thanks. It's just, you know... He was he best sponsor I've ever had, and I don't know what I'm gonna do now. Well, I have been doing some thinking and... here's a thought: Why don't I be your sponsor? You gotta be kidding. You don't know squat about sex addiction. Well, cravings are cravings, and all you really need is a friend to call when you start having inappropriate thoughts, and I can be that friend. Well, there's more to it than that. Claude rescued me from some pretty nasty scenes over the years. Well, if you were in trouble, I could handle it. How can you be so sure? Because I can be very strong for those people that I really care about. How can you have any feelings for me at all? I mean, you've only known me for a few weeks. Yes, and in that time, I've come to learn that you're good and kind and smart. And, yes, you have a little problem that you need some help with, but I'm willing to be there for you. So what's the big deal? If you saw me at my worst, you might not like me so much. Peter, let me be your rock. Taking care of people is what I do best. Drink your milk. Ah-ah-ah. Mmh-mnh. I asked for extra spicy. I'm pretty sure you said medium. Are you? Well, maybe if you'd written it down, you would've spared yourself the walk of shame back to the kitchen. Edie, why are you torturing that girl? That is her. That is the one that Karl is in love with. We have been here a million times, and you should see the way that she flirts with him, and when she comes back here, I am gonna shove this pitcher in her perky little mug, and when she's... Okay, let's not make a scene. It's not worth it. For the sake of argument, let's... let's... let's say that it's someone else. You know, probably it would be a vulnerable, lonely woman who Karl just took advantage of, and what if... this poor, confused soul begged your forgiveness? What would you say? I'd say... "too little, too late, bitch," and then I'd kick her. Oh. Yeah, but you don't have to worry about that, - because I'm positive it's her. I mean, who else could it be? - Yeah. Karl's office is all guys, and then the only women he sees are me, Julie, that... that lesbian that does his taxes and you. You know what? It is her. Really? Why? She just... spit in your wings. You got my back? Uh... sure? Here you go, extra spicy. You did that on purpose. You are going to pay! - Oh! - Whoa! Fight, fight! Get off me, you! Get off me! Mayer! Four on one! A little help! So, uh, when we leave... who you gonna miss the most? I don't know. Yeah, you do. You said good-bye to her yet? No. Look, man, it's... it's okay if you like her. You know, I think Danielle really likes you, too. Really? Yeah, she told me she'd be really sad if you left and didn't say good-bye. You know, I think that she might even want you to give her a little kiss. But Danielle doesn't even like me in her room. She gets mad. Yeah. I talked to her about that. She feels really bad. But you know what? She told me, if you come in her room again, she won't get mad. And, Caleb, she's gonna act like she doesn't want you to kiss her... but she does. Dale Helm, like all the students at Parsons Christian Academy, was taught that his future was safely in God's hands. What he didn't know was that Gabrielle Solis was about to force a fumble. All right, guys, you all know next week we're playing the Falcons! And we're gonna fry up those birdies for dinner, 'cause we're the Huskies! And who are the Huskies? God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! God's team! What are you doing? You can't be here. Let's talk turkey. What is it gonna take for you to give up the baby? It's not gonna happen, okay? I gotta get back. I'm the quarterback. It doesn't look right. Okay, no, no! Wait, what about a car? Or college? Tuition's a killer these days. I could help you out. I don't need help. You hear those cheers? Those are for me. Last game, I threw 246 yards. With stats like that, I can get into the college of my choice. So why do you want to be a dad? These are your glory days. A baby would ruin your life. Oh, I know. But Frank said once I get the baby, he's gonna take it off my hands. But it's not even his. Libby dumped him. He thinks that if he has the baby and she sees him acting all mature, - she'll take him back. - No, no, no. I am not letting that idiot use my baby as a bargaining chip. Hey, it's out of my hands! No, it doesn't have to be, okay? Just do the right thing - and sign the release form. - Look, I'm really sorry. Before we adjourn today, let's take a moment to bow our heads. Hello, everyone. I'm Gaby Solis, class of '94. Whoo-hoo! I just wanted to give God a big shout out for this amazing season. The man upstairs has definitely been on your side, and you wanna know why? Because you boys live clean. You keep your noses up, you stay out of trouble, and you don't go around getting strippers pregnant. And that's a good thing, 'cause if one of you caused a scandal like that, not only would that guy get kicked off the team and lose all of his scholarships, but God would drop your school colors so fast, it'd make your head spin! And then the football season would go to hell. No pun intended. So my point is, do the right thing, and no one gets hurt. Signed, sealed, delivered. Lily's ours. So what do you think? Are you staying late again, or can I finally have dinner at home with my wife? God, I don't know. I'm gonna go check with Ed. Okay. Hey, any luck with that IMing thing? No, not really. I was online chatting with Fran a while ago, and I asked her what she was wearing, and she said, "a yellow blouse." Okay, that's good. Then what? Then... yeah, that's it. I just kinda blocked. - You blocked? - Yeah, I didn't know what else to say. You're an award-winning copywriter, Ed. You get paid to write. Yeah, jingles for oatmeal, not soft-core porn. For God's sakes, it's not brain surgery. - Is she still online? - Yeah, I think so. "I love the way that blouse clings to your body." "Are you joking?" mnh-mnh-mnh. "Nothing funny about those beautiful breasts." "Yeah? What did you want to do to me?" Uh... Ed, your conference call's ready. Oh God, I almost forgot about that. Okay, I gotta go take this, but you keep going, 'cause you're doing great. No, Ed, I'm not doing this for you! - Just... - What? "Touch every inch of your body until you're trembling." "Oh, yeah. I'll bite you good." "Hell, yeah. First, I want you to touch yourself." "Oh, yeah!" "I'm on my way." Hello? Bree, it's Peter... and I'm in trouble. Hi, I'm... I'm looking for, um, Peter McMillan. I'm not sure I know him. You should ask my wife. She organized the party. Hey, Judy, get over here and act like a hostess! Come on in! Come on, come on, come on. Hey there. Things are just getting started. After you take off your clothes, feel free to jump right in. No, no, I'm... I'm good. I'm just, um, here to pick up my friend Peter. He's locked himself in your bathroom, and I'm here to take him home. Oh, yeah, that guy. We were wondering about him. The bathroom's over there. Hey, is that your natural color? Yes, it is. Beautiful. I wish mine would do that. This is out of a bottle. Yes, I'm aware of that. Peter? Peter, it's Bree. Are you in there? What are you doing here? I'm a sex addict. What do you think? You can't possibly be turned on by what's going on out there. - Disgusting, isn't it? - Yes. Why would you wanna come to a place like this? I didn't. I wanted you to come. I can't make you not have feelings for me, but I can show you who I was, what my life was like. Well, that's not your life anymore. But it could be. If I slip again, this is exactly where you could find me, or someplace worse. Then what would you think of me? - Peter... - Bree... it's dangerous to care about me. A lot of people have over the years, and they all end up getting hurt. Rex said he'd always be faithful. George said he'd never hurt me, and as it turned out, they were both liars. So as long as you're honest with me, you'd be amazed at what I can put up with. Now let's go home. Hey there. Did you have a late night? I hope. It was horrible. The whole thing blew up in my face. Why would you tell my wife to bite my nipple off? I didn't! I didn't. Why would she... oh! The honeymoon thing. Yeah, and it hurt like hell then, too. And it didn't take her long to figure out that I let a stranger seduce her online. Oh, God! She was so mad, she locked herself in the bathroom and called a divorce lawyer. You're getting divorced? I spent two hours pleading with her through the bathroom door, begging her not to leave me, and... we finally managed to come to terms. - What kind of terms? - I promised her I would fire the person who did it. You're gonna fire me? No, of course not. You're too important here. I'm gonna fire Tom. I told her it was him that sent the IMs. - What?! - I told her that he had a problem with boundaries. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna do this, but my marriage was on the line. You can't make my husband your scapegoat. I won't let you. I don't have a damn choice. I can't be divorced, Lynette. I can't. He's under contract. If you just fire him, he'll sue you, and I'll back him up. You need cause. Well... I guess I'll have to find cause. It shouldn't be too difficult if I look hard enough. Hey, how's the eye? Oh, it's still a little red, but think I got all the hot sauce out. That's good. So, um... you know the other day when I said that thing about us being sisters? Well, when I said it I really didn't mean it. Yeah, I kind of figured that. No, I mean, I really didn't mean it. But, um... now I do. Thank you. Thank you for having my back. So do I have to worry about you attacking any more waitresses? Nah, my bar brawlin' days are over. Oh, you know, I-I've gotta go. I have a meeting. I'll talk to you later. Are you Oliver? You must be Edie. Pleasure to meet you. Oh, likewise. I hear you're one of the best private detectives in town. I do what I can. Well, come on in. Let's talk. Um... basically, I just want you to trail my ex. He, uh... left me for another woman, and I wanna nail that ho to the wall. Caleb? Hey, come on, buddy, wake up. Caleb? It's time. Get away from me! Get away from her! Danielle, I want you to pick up the phone and call the police. - No! - What? Matthew and his mother have been protecting Caleb. They're in as much trouble as he is! I don't care. Mom, please! I love him. Please. If I hadn't been in the house, he could've raped her... or worse. He's locked in his room now, so... Needless to say, the agreement between us is off. Caleb is dangerous, and I want him put away. If he is not gone by tomorrow, I am calling the police. He will be. I promise you. Can I go check on Danielle? Yes. Betty, I am serious. Either you do something, or I will. Bree, stop worrying. I understand what needs to happen now. Danielle? Did it work? Perfectly. You did great. Um, so I got some rates on some mental hospitals around here, and there's one called Silvercrest which actually seems okay. Put this ham in the fridge, will you? I think I'll make it for dinner. Uh, mom, I know you don't wanna talk about this, but we have to. Mrs. Van De Kamp is gonna call the police. I promised myself I would never institutionalize your brother. - Mom! - How long do you think it'd be before he'd act out, maybe even hurt somebody? A couple of days? A week? Then they'd throw him in a straitjacket and drug away what's left of his mind. He'd spend the rest of his life at the mercy of strangers. But if we don't send him to a hospital, he's gonna end up in prison, - and don't you think that's worse? - Yes, of course I do. So what the hell are we gonna do? Phenobarbital? It's easy. It's painless. It's just a few extra drops. He simply falls asleep. Caleb was meant for a better world than this, Matthew. It's time to give your brother the peace he deserves. Who's the pretty girl? Oh, looks like it's daddy's turn. - I got her. - Yes. Oh, yes. - Mrs. Solis? - Yes? We have a court order to take the Collins baby into custody. No, no, no, that's a mistake. No, we... we have the paperwork. The birth father signed away his rights. It's the birth mother who's protesting. What? Until the adoption is legally finalized, the birth mother can still change her mind, and... she has. No, no, no, no, no, no! Gaby, wait. You? You don't even wanna be a mother! Well, look, Frank quit usin', and, uh, he got a good job down at the plant. He's really stepped up. So?! Well, so we're gonna give the whole family thing a shot. Well, I'll totally give you all your money back. I don't want my money back. I want my baby! Come on, let's go. Carlos! No! Carlos, what's happening? No, no, no, ma'am, You don't understand, You don't understand. This is our baby! No, we've been... we've been feeding her, and we... we've been bathing her, and we wake up in the middle of the night and we rock her, which is crazy, 'cause if you knew me, I don't do that. I don't do that. And... and my husband... my husband, he sings to her. He sings, so you can't take her away. It's too late. We've already fallen in love with her! Carlos, do something! No, you can't go! You can't... you can't take her! You can't take her! No! She's our baby! She's our... No! Please! There is a prayer intended to give strength to people faced with circumstances they don't want to accept. The power of the prayer comes from its insight into human nature... - We ask God to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change... - ... because so many of us rage against the hand that life has dealt us... - ... the courage to change the things we can... - ... because so many of us are cowardly and afraid to stand up for what is right... - ... and the wisdom to know the difference. - ... because so many of us give in to despair... when faced with an impossible choice. The good news for those who utter these words is that God will hear you
