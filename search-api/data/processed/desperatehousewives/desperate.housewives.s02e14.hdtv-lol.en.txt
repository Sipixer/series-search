How did you knowabout the doctor? People talk. So you-- you're marrying a gay guy? I need health insurance, um,'cause I've gotthis wandering spleen and... that sounds funny, "spleen wandering," but... actually,it's not funny 'causeit can bang into things... so I need health insurance,so I'm getting married tomorrow. And you probably thinkI'm crazy,right? Well... can it wait? Um,the surgery? No. It can't wait. I guess it's really not that crazy. how you doin',ma'am? Susan,can you justgive me a minute?

Maybe I should startby paying her a visit... her daughter's not the one. Yeah,well,given your track record, I might wanna check that outfor myself. Tell him I'll be therein the morning. Oh! So pretty. You like nice things? that's why I think you're stupid, for not wanting to stay here. You could be around my nice things all the time, taking care of them... how fun would that be? Well,I'm sure it's a lotmore fun than you'd have in that tiny,godforsaken village of yours. You know,we're probably more alike than people would guess. I'm from a small town,too. My folks had nothing. That's why I love america. Anything is possible. Oh... hmm,you like that? No. An old,fat stockbrokergave this to me. It's not worth anything.You can have it. Oh... oh!

I had steven burn a little wedding mix for us,. for ambience Sure,just,um,give me a sec do you have a problem? You said she was sick. She is. She has a wandering spleen. It sounds nothing like cancer. It doesn't even sound real. Well,it is. I-I could die. You look fine to me,honey. Don't do this. I have asked you six times to fly with me to holland to get married, and you always havesome la me excuse. But the second some chick witha silly disease comes along, well,you drop everythingand head for a chapel. Oh,no,it's a serious illness. See,it just sounds silly'cause of the word "spleen." What do you want from me? I want you to worryabout my feelings half as much as you worry about your mother's! What is it gonna taketo make you happy? Not go through with the wedding? Is that what you're asking? Oh,oh! No,no,stop right there. Okay,I would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in holland more than anyone, with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang. But unless I get this surgery, my spleen is going to slam straight into my heartand explode. So,you know,seeingas I am just a nice person and I always support gay rights,let's just do this. And then I'll havea husband and insurance. Nobody gets hurt. Steven,why...steven! - it's just... - yeah. I'm so sorry. My hands are tied. I'm really sorry. Steven,wait.

So now I'm known throughout the advertising worldas "toilet boy." Tell him you're donewith the games. You don't wanna playanymore. No,no,no,I can'T.I can'T. If I back down now,he'll see itas a sign of weakness. Look, this is the way that guys do business.But-- so you called it. He made mehis bitch. Come on. Here you go.Oh. You know,ed,I've been thinking. We've had a lot of fun and gamesaround here lately, but maybe it's time to set a slightly moreprofessional tone in the office. Oh,I get it. Somebody went runningto mommy,didn't he? Huh? What? Tom loses a few bets, so he tries to get his wifeto make me back off? Oh,this is so alpha tau. I am gonna make him pay. No. No,you're notgonna make him pay. You are gonnastop this now. This is my company. If people wanna work here,they play by my rules. - Ed! - What? I'm calling you out. Huh?Yes,you're right. This is your company,so I'll play by your rules. What do I have to do to get youto stop this frat boy crap? Shave my eyebrows?Come to work naked? Name your stakes. I don't have time for this. Aw,what's wrong,ed? You afraid a phi kapp'sgonna get beaten by a girl? Come on,big man... it's just a little bet. As you know,I thinkthat making the workplace fun is good for morale. But lynette here thinksthat our shenanigans have gottena little out of hand. oh,hold on. Hold on. I respect lynette's work ethic. So we've decidedto settle the matter with a little testof intestinal fortitude. If she can eat 1 pound of our client's fine,farm-fresh pork product, raw... there'll be a moratoriumon wagering in the office. oh,oh! I knowyou are doing this for me. You don't need to do this. I don't need you fighting my fights. I am not fighting your fights. This is my fight this is how guysdo business,right? While we're young. no shame in defeat,lynette. No shame at all. oh,she's gonna do it. ohh! oh,yes! oh! oh,this is too much. oh! what? She took the bet. What? This is fun,people. she's got one more. so... can this be a placeof business again,ed? - No more games? - Sure. You sucked all the funout of it anyway. that was really something. Thanks. Could you scrounge me upa bucket? Caleb saida nice,red-haired lady came to visit him. Come on in,betty. Get you a drink? This is nota social call,bree! Did you or did you not breakinto my home and talk to my son? Caleb and I had,uh,a very lovely chat. Yes. if you evercome near him again, there will be hellto pay. Do you understand? Aren't you gonna ask mewhat we talked about? The name,um... melanie foster came up. I'm gonna pour youa drink now,betty, because we're about to havea very honest discussion, and I think you're gonnaneed a little help getting through it. his name's zach young. He lives with his father. Mother committed suicideabout a year ago. How did he end upwith these people? How do you think? Dierdre was strung out,noah.She gave him up. I wanna see this boy. Well,he's gota new family now. I can't just snap my fingersand get him in here. Maybe not,but I can snap my fingers, and detective sullivan can make it happen. - You don't wanna do that. - No? Is that reallythe way you wanna meet him-- have that thug drag him in hereso grandpa can give him a hug? Fine. You bring him.I'll give you two days. As you know,I'm on a bitof a clock here. When caleb was born, and the doctors discovered that he was different, I didn't even cry. It was the most painful moment of my life. I didn't shed a single tear. I just thought to myself,what's the point? He is my son, and I haveto raise him as best I can. Now that's my job. In a lot of ways,I feel so blessed. Caleb is challenged, but he has such a sweet nature. I'm sure you noticed thatwhen you came to visit. Yes,I did. I also noticed that you had himchained in the basement. That's becauseof melanie foster. Melanie was a girlthat matthew dated. She was a debutante. And liketypical teenagers, their relationshipwas full of drama. They were always breaking upand getting back together and breaking up. One night,after oneof their big blow-ups, caleb somehow convinced melanie to meet him downat our local lumberyard. I can only imagine thatshe thought he was bringing some kind of apology from matthew but he wasn'T. Caleb told melanie he was in love with her, and thatif he was her boyfriend, he would neverbreak up with her... and she laughedin his face. He tried to show herhe was serious by kissing her... and she hit him. He doesn't remember a lotof what happened after that,but he-- he does know thathe got very,very angry,and... and that there was an axlying on the ground nearby him. Yes, my caleb killed melanie, but I couldn'tlet him go to jail... or worse,be put down, for what was really my crime. Your crime? It was my responsibility. I was supposedto protect him from himself. I am his mother. That was my job. The world is filled with unlikely friendships. How do they begin? With one person desperately in need, and another willing to lend a helping hand. When such kindness is offered... We're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously written off. And before we know it... a bond has formed, regardless of whether others can understand it. Yes,unlikely friendships start up every day. No one understands this more than the lonely. In fact, it's what they count on. -------------------------- Proudly Presents
