Hey,Todd,it's me ,pick up,pick up listen,i'm on my way back to the apartment. i remember the proposal,so please don't go. we really have to talk. proposal. proposal. okay. proposal. proposal. proposal. proposal. do not talk to me,frank. proposal. always my first choice. i-i tried. i did everything i could,and it's not enough. you do not get to choose when we break up. i just did. yeah,i just cut it all off. todd loved my hair long. that'll teach him. - oh,hey. hey. listen-- - did your mom tell you i found a place? - as soon as they process the application,i'm in. - shh. shh. listen to me,okay? it's not big. it's a little dark, but there's zero goat heads, - and i'm feeling pretty good about that. - listen. listen. we need to talk. i-i justeed you to know that i am so sorry that i... that i what? oh. oh. it's here. it's here. um,i'm--i'm,uh,for the pro--prof-- p... p... um,pro-- it--it--it smeared. pom--pomnip--uh,does that-- any of that ring a bell? you know what? hold on. there's a message. hey,todd. it's me. pick up. pick up. listen,i'm on my way-- well,you're here now. what was it? - i don't know. it's gone. - well,i'm sure it'll come back. no. it won't. maybe it was nothing. oh,hi. just reading a little didion,like usual. there's nothing like a "'poignant and trenchant look "at marriage in the 21st century,' says the new york--" me. why are you stalking me? - what? i-i'm--i'm not. - i know that you keep calling me and hanging up. your extension shows up on my phone. it does? i call everyone in the office just to say hi. okay,why don't you like me? excuse me? kiss me. kiss me. just do it. okay,that's it. you just bought yourself a sit-down with human resources. no. ooh. ooh. wait. wait,carol,okay? you know,just go easy on her,okay? she's not right. i think we both--we both know that. you know what i mean? for you. okay. why is she not attracted to me? i think she's stupid. i hate her. well,maybe she's not into looks. you know,maybe-- maybe she dislikes you... for who you are. you think? andrea,life has a way of evening things out, and pretty on the outside usually doesn't get to be pretty on the inside, and,andrea,you are very... very... pretty on the outside. thank you. i just checked my voice mail. i was turned down for the apartment. it was a done deal. it was my place--a crappy place--but it was mine. you know,um... you could always just stay here. excuse me? well,you know,until you-- you find exactly what you want. okay... when did we ever worry about what i wanted? i know. i know. i--it just-- i-i can't explain it entirely, i just know,that looking over these notes, everything ends with a "bad to todd," or "apologize to todd" or "buy todd a new bird." that was you. i just think i would feel a lot better if i could just make it up to you. so i'd be doing you a favor? if you wouldn't mind. - no rent then? - a favor,not a charity. but as just... friends,right? yeah,of course. just as-- just as... friends,you know? or not friends if you don't want to do that. we could,you know,just be roommates. no,no,no. friends would be nice. you know,because i'll probably slide on the rent a few times, and my roommate might not understand. navigating through memories can be quite a trip. and maybe it's true, maybe the mind,like any smart traveler, does know where it's safe
