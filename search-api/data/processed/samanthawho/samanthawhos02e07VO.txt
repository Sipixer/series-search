What are-- what are you-- wh are you doing home? Well,what about you? I thought you were at granola boy's house. Unless it's mixing your current boyfrie and your ex-boyfriend. Because granola boy called,and they've got some fresh granola in. This is awesome. I mean,it's,uh,awkward. I don't know why i said "awesome," 'cause it's not. It's awkward. Mostly because he's wearing my shirt. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'lluh,go change. - Good plan. - All right,well,that went really well,huh? - No. But i'm glad,because now you owe me a favor. My mom's coming in from canada for the week. Wait a minute. She's in canada? - You're canadian? - Yeah. Why? It's just not something that you eaboot. Anyway,look,she knows we broke up. What she doesn't know is that i live on your couch and that your boyfriend wears my shirts. Got it. You want me to moveoot. Yes. Okay. Well,what should i-- should i come by and say hi to r? Or let me guess. She hates me. Oh,she might,if she ever met you. You said you never mixed boyfriends and parents. That's not true. I mean,i obviously introduced you to my parents. Well... Sort of. Oh,i can't do this. I can't do this. Oh,what is wrong? It's just-- being in your parents' house... They're in myrtle beach. You know,it's your childhood room. I - i don't know if i can do it in front of this many unicorns. Well,unless you want to do it in front of the guys reflooring my apartment, - then this is gonna have to do. - Okay. Hey,sammy,i saw your car in the driveway. Oh,my god! Hey,daddy. You guys bring me anything? It's okay. You can have the apartment. I'll... Go stay at my... Parents'hoose. Why would you invite your boyfriend to meet your parents? Seriously,you need a handler. You cannot be left alone. I don't want things in my life to be separate. You know,i like everything individually,so why wouldn't i like them all mixed together? - You like your red wine,right? - Yeah,i love it. - You like martinis? - Sure. - Enjoy. - Thank you. I will. I'd just be happy to mix with my own boyfriend,but chase is always busy. I've been trying to get him to go see that movie "australia" with me. I mean,i even told him,it's a big romance starring hugh jackman. What more could a guy want? He used to want to spend every second with me. Now i never see him. I see him every day. Believe me. You're not missing anything. Yes. That's an idea. If i want to see him,go to his work. Uh,which is also my work,so no. I'm telling you,dnot mix parts of your life. I think you are wrong. And owen is amazing,and i cannot wait for my parents to get to know him. Okay,well,have you considered this? When your pa get to know owen,owen will get to know your parents.

Oh,how lucky were you to find that one? "has he ever been married?" "is he mried now? Does he have children? "canhe have children? "your sex life. Oursex life." Howard,can you believe this? Our daughter is embarrassed by us. Us? She didn't givemeany cards. Oh,i can't tell the constipated parrot joke? No. Please. Because smitty and reno down at the chicken farm loved it,and they're a tough laugh. Daddy,for me? Okay. But you do realize that he hasn't gone for days. - No,i know it. - All ri-- all right,all right,all right. You know what? I was once told i was a "bewitching" conversationalist. Why am i being singled out? I mean,i've already met owen. Yes,and pretended to be my sister. So you can understand my concern. Fine. Fine. I won't speak. I'll just cook and bus tables. What,i'm the hired help now? Yes,but we think of you as almost a member of the family. Well done,sir. I'm sorry? Your mother,"who is coming to stay," so miss newly would clear out? Excellent story. Well played. Uh,no,no,no. My mom really was coming,but she canceled. I was gonna call sam and tell her to come home. If i may... Rarely does the universe offer you a weekento yourself...

Okay,so we're not leaving until we're done. First up is permits. Andrea. Really? Is she gonna be in the meetings now? Just ignore me. - I'm not even here. - She's not even here. So what are we gonna dabout those permits? Yes,sir.We're still waiting for the city-- i'm sorry,jerri. Waiting? So now waiting is doing? Is that it? Oh,wait. I see the similarities. I see them. They're both participles,right? They're both action words,like "groveling,packing,firing." I'm sorry. I thought you were kidding. I thought you were like... I'm a bear. A cute little baby bear,that's what you are. Okay. Okay. Dena? Dena? Kicked out of the bear cave. Call me. You know,owen,i was an environmentalist beforeit became a fad. And if i'd ever gotten these two to turn off a light when they left a room, I'd be a rich man myse i never said that you were rich. Oh,it's okay. I am. Samantha,uh,would you pass the potatoes to owen? And,uh,howard,would you like to ask our guest if he wants to have children someday? Okay,owen,um,you'reonna love regina's chicken salad. Oh,thank you. It looks fantastic,but,uh,i don't eat chicken. Pardon me? Oh,but it's okay. I mean,nothing to worry about. I have plenty of potatoes here. - You have a problem with chicken? - Daddy. No. - Okay. - Okay. Just the industry that farms it. Which... I now understand means you. All right. What do we got? Chicken stock. Yams. We have yams! Uh,really,i'm fine. Well,i guess you gave your little topic cards to the wrong parent. Mother,i told you he was a vegetarian. Which is why i made a salad. Withchicken. But chickensalad. Chicken. Salad. ***I - i can pick around it. So is this a humane thing? Because we have free-range chickens only. Uh,it's more of an environmental concern. Factory farming uses a disproportionate amount of resources. Oh,here we go,the part where i'm personally responsible for "global warming." Daddy,it's-- it's not "global warming." Okay? It's very real. Um,owen and i actually went to a lecture about it last week,an incredibly informative-- And maybe about an hour and a half too long-- lecture. And now i get one in the privacy of my own home. Daddy,this is what owen essa fmaornt aha l wivhoin? G. He's-- he's saving the planet. And i'm killing it,right? And my little hobby provides food,jobs,a roof over your head. And let me remind you,chickens built this house. Really? I'd love to see pictures of that. Oh,look! Beets. Nature's candy. I'm-- i'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause problems. I should probably go. Yeah. - No. - Maybe we can do this some other time. Yeah,but you're gonna miss dessert. I - i hope you like panda.

Creamed corn? Panda? He rode his bike. Last night was a complete and utter disaster. I feel bad for you sam. I do. But the lesson we can all take from this is ias right. Yes,you were right. Never mix. I mean,my father still wouldn't talk to me this morning. You guys were talking about chicken and ended up with a beef. A beef. Right? I mean,i-i was just defending my boyfriend. It's not like i was attacking my father and what he does. Well,a guy like your dad iswhat he does. You know what i have to do? I have to go down there,i have to apologize and i have to see what it is that he does. No,don't. Because i spent one day at chase's office,and it ruined him. It was horrible. Meaning? - You were right. - Yes,i was right. I'm having a great day. Look,chapman will be fine. He just needs to humiliate somebody in public,and he'll be back to normal. Yes. Andrea,please do it. Just pretend to let chase take you down. And why would i do that? And why would she do that? - So that dena will stop coming to your office. - Deal. You know who i blame for all of this? Todd's mother. I hope she's enjoying herself. Intercepted! No,no,no. That's interference. No,that's 98,nothing. - Yeah,switch controllers hawi wthho m? - Back off,woman. Would the world's greatest dad like a mug for his coffee? Well,if you're talking about me,i like styrofoam cups, So when they get dumped into the ocean,i get to clog up a dolphin's blowhole. Actually,the thing about styrofoam is tt the danger of it is that it has these chemicals That are released when it-- i'm sorry. It was a very informative lecture. Thanks. Daddy,i shouldn't have taken owen's side without even knowing what you do or even taking the time to find out. I'm sorry. Yeah,well,you've been busy. You know,you had that whole coma thing going on,you know,this and that. So... This is where it happens,huh? Yeah,this is it. You loved coming here when you were a kid. You used to sit at this desk and play with the stapler,be the boss like your old man. Will you show me? Oh,you just take it and just kind of go like this... "hey. I'm the boss." No. Will you show me what you do? No. You're just being polite. It's-- hey,it's okay. Please can i have a tour? Okay. Sure. Why not? Uh,we might have to get some booties... So you don't get blood on those nice shoes and maybe a shower cap. So we're projecting revenues escalating in that market,so i'm gonna need-- people. Andrea. Yes,mr,chapman? Andrea,it has come to my attention that you have made some sort of mistake. Apologize. - Yes.I've made a-- - stand up. I did make a mistake. I messed up bad. And i feel i need some sort of slap on the wrist to show me who's the boss. Oh,i didn't say to sit down.

And i promise this is the very last apology that you will ever need. - You got it? - No. Get on your knees,woman. I'm never doing that. This is not my fault. I didn't mess things up with your girlfriend. - Okay,apologies accepted. - I'm not apologizing. You apologize.

Ironically,by the time i get there,he'll be 6 feet closer than me. Hey,sammy. Come here. Look. Ntha who i've been waiting a long time to give you this. The guys down at the farm gave it to me for my 20th year in the business. Look at that-- "the cluck stops here." Smitty came up with that. And y-you'll get a chance to meet him when you hang that over your desk tomorrow. Tomorrow? No. N - not until you die. You gotta die first,silly. Well,you need to learn the business. You know,right after my death,you're not gonna be in a very good headspace. You know,viking funerals are very powerful,unsettling things. Dena. Dena. Dena. Excuse me. Stop. Move. Move. Ank you. So you think i'm ignoring you? What are you doing here? Don't you have to work? No,i forwarded all my calls. Well,yeah,i don't feel like i'm a priority anymore.

Wait,wait. What are you doing? No,come back! That's so romantic,you coming through my bedroom window. Uh,this is not romantic. This is me being scared of your dad. There's a lot of things that i can be afraid of in this house. Right. I-- yeah,i was just,um... Just doing my nails. It's fine. - Careful. - Oh,yeah. Sorry about last night. I should have just shut up and not made a big deal. But i got all competitive and everything,tried to act strong in front of my woman. I know you're strong.

You got a great guy now,and he is. He's great. I just don't think i... Handled it well. Well,the reason i can pick a great guy is because i have a fantastic one for a dad. Now hamburger production-- boy,oh,boy. Y- you want to talk about nightmares,i mean these-- Ernest hemingway once said that life is a "moveable feast." I think what he meant is that there's an instinctive human desire to mix the ingredients of our lives... Preparing a far richer meal than if those ingredients had never come together.
