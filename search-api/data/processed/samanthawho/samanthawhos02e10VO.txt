Look, i know he's a big basketball star and everything, But he should take the time... Why are you "bupping" me? Look, it's okay.

I am completely afraid that a bug is gonna crawl down my throat when i'm asleep. I saw that on the discovery channel last night. When did you start thinking that your life needed a narrator? Everyone is afraid of something, all right? Go out with Tony. You need more than a text relationship, Andrea. You deserve that. - And Tony likes you. - No. No. He likes the stuff my phone says i say. Okay? I mean, i could be this perfect person, And i plan every word, and i could spell-check myself. I mean, what if i meet him, and every word that just comes out of my mouth is just misspelled? Well, if that's what you're worried about, i'll go with you. I'll bring Todd. We can be like the Ricardos and the Mertzes... The Flintstones and the Rubbles. - I've been watching way too much tv. - Yes. Mr. Newly, hi. I have a situation.

My real boyfriend, Chase, sees it at my place, he'll know i'm cheating. Regina, it's for you! Hey, Todd, will you bring me my purse?

Leave, but don't come back. - Excuse me? - No. Please don't... Don't make this any harder than it needs to be. We had our chance, but our chance came and went. People change. So just... Just walk away... And always remember the times that we had. You are so hired. Hello? Thirsty. - Mm. - My drink? You know, I forgot you were there You know what? I should go. Yeah, i have a big tort complaint to prepare for, And you don't even know what that is, So you can't say i'm lying. - Yeah. - Here he comes. You see? He hates me. He doesn't. Just breathe, okay? Andrea? Oh, it was definitely worth the wait. High-Lo. I mean to say "hi," and... then i thought,"hello," And it came out like,"high-Lo." Let me start again. High-Lo. Now Philly... That's a tough town to play in. Huh. So are you two together or what? - We used to be, we just live together. - Nope. I'm alone. Lone wolf. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - Yeah. Oh, excuse me. - Gay? - Trust me. Yeah, well, he wasn't before he went. He... He took the urinal right next to me, And then there was a look. How does that make him gay? - And then there was a nod. - Okay, a look and a nod. That's it? And a smile. There was a look, a nod and a smile. The only thing missing was ice skates. - Ice skates? - Well, figure skaters are gay, right? Look, I don't know. This is not my scene. Sam. Sam, come here. Do not say anything, all right? This is going really well, And i'm not gonna let anything screw it up. Okay? Yeah? Tony just said the most amazing thing. Go ahead. Say it again. - I just said i liked her shoes. - No, no, no. He said he liked my vintage Lacroix shoes. I mean, really, what kind of man notices something like that? Sam, thoughts? Look at her. She likes him. Maybe she can change him. It's possible, you know. They have camps for that. I saw it on the bible channel. - Look, just tell her. - Tell her what? That she's in love with a gay man? I can't tell her that. She's just gonna think that i'm sabotaging her relationship again. - So don't tell her. - She's in love with a gay. How can i not tell her? She's gonna get hurt. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're right. You're right. I don't tell her. I show her. So if she sees it for herself, then she can't be mad at me, right? Thank you so much. You are such a good friend. Oh! Wait. Friend? No, no, no, I'm not your... Damn it. Hmm? Like it? "Hey, look at me. I'm a breakup artist." Nice stove. I'm sorry. He wrote and told me how hard it was for him over there, and i wanted to relate, I told him the pilot light on my stove kept going out. You were supposed to be helping me out of this. I couldn't do it. I might be the only thing keeping him alive at night. Who are you keeping alive at night? - My soldier. - Oh, i'll break up with him. I fire people all the time. No problem. But nobody buys my wife a stove. Including you. Damn right. Look at it. You begged for it. Look at it. Tony, you know, um, Todd and i were... were talking this morning about what our favorite characters on "Sex and the City" were, and i was just curious what yours was. You know, i've... I've never... I've never seen "Sex and the City." Mm-Hmm. That's okay. You know, let's put on some music, all right? Hey, Tony, you can pick, 'cause you're... you're the guest. We have Foo Fighters, Metallica, "Mamma Mia." Hey, what's your favorite musical, Tony? I'm really not into musicals. Oh, really? So we're gonna play it that way, huh? Uh, andrea, i need to get some more wine. Will you help me open up a bottle? - Okay - good. You guys have fun. I like him. Oh, me, too. You know, i think we... I think you should have sex with him. - What? - Yeah, right now. Just try. And then observe what happens, you know? If he says he's not in the mood, then... then you tell him to get in the mood or explain why not. Okay? - That sounds kinda hot. - Yeah, it is, kinda. But i like him. I really do. I think i kinda want to take it slow with him. Oh, my god. Maybe some of the new u is rubbing off on me. Ah. Now? Oh, god. What are you doing leaving me out there with him? - I'm a pleaser. You know that. - Look, Andrea is just not getting it. I need you to sleep with Tony Dane. - Sorry? - We already know that he likes you, so we just need him to, like, hit on you in front of her. I know what we could do. We could go in there. We could all start dancing, and then I'll switch, And then you can start dancing with Tony and i'll start dancing with... Then you start dancing with him. - Let's just open this up a little bit. - Will you just cut it out? Put some oil on there because i think it needs to shimmer. Stop it! What you doing? I'm not your toy, i'm not your pal, not your girlfriend, and i'm not your gay roommate. I'm here, okay? Right here. And i guess that's the problem. Drama queen, huh? Snap. - Where's Andrea? - Bathroom. Oh, good. Then it's just the two of us. All right, Tony, come on. You can be straight with me. - I'm sorry. That's a very poor choice of words. - What you talking about? - Tony, i think you know. - Do i? Tony, i know what happened in the men's room with todd, okay? And Andrea is my best friend, and i'm not gonna stand by and let her get hurt. Look, she's gonna understand, you know? I have admitted so many horrible things to her, and she's always forgiven me. Not that being gay is horrible or needs to be forgiven or anything like that. I actually think it's good. Go, gays! So... - Hey. - Hey. Uh, what's going on? Andrea, um... This i't easy to say. It's okay. It's okay, Tony. It's all right. Andrea, Tony has something that he needs to tell you. - Sam tried to hit on me. - What?! Sam! No! No. What? I don't want to come between you two, but i think we should just go. I was not hitting on him. I was not hitting on you. I was... Why would i hit on him? He's gay! Yeah, you're gay. He's gay. There. Oh, god, i said it. I said it. Whew. Big weight lifted now. Oh, honey, he is gay. Oh, my god. Honestly, Sam, A new low, even for you. - What? No. - Mm! He's gay. He was staring at Todd's... Maybe Andrea is right, maybe i do have some sort of pathological need to destroy all of her relationships. You know, it's, like, i don't know if Tony Dane is gay. I could be totally wrong. My boyfriend in college was gay. We didn't know it at the time. I mean, he knew it, and all the members of the, you know, man alive choir, but i did not see it. Yeah. Now andrea hasn't called me back for two days. Todd's avoiding me. He leaves before i even get up. Did you do something make him mad? Like ask him to oil up and seduce tony dane? Hmm. No. Just that. Hi. Hey, guys. Hey. - Guess who's gay. - No one. No one's gay, And anyone who says that they are just kidding themselves. Tony Dane. Maybe not. Maybe i'm just being narrow-minded. You know what? In Europe, straight guys... they hold hands, they walk right on... They walk right on down the street. No, he's gay. He told me himself. He did? You know that i was not trying to break you guys up. Yes, and today we're leaking our relationship to the press. I know that i'm the one with amnesia, but that still means when two guys love each other and they... No, look, this is all good. Tony gets to have me on his arm, and i get paparazzi, press and private planes, And i get to see whoever i want in secret, So you know what, Sam? You were right. I need more out of a relationship... Fame. Okay. Are you sure that this is what you want? Yes. - Really? - Hey. Bup. It's just a little weird to have a guy who's just a friend. It doesn't have to be. I mean, look at me and todd. No, it only works if one of you is gay. Why? Because there's always one of you that wants something more than the other one. Usually me. Or Todd. Oh, God. I am such an idiot. Of course he was mad i was trying to put oil on him. - Who wants to be treated like that? - Chase. He loves when I take baby oil... Ew. Bup-Bup. Bup-Bup. I saw this thing the discovery channel or something about the theory of matter, That matter exists in different forms. I think the same thing applies to love. Love is like liquid. It can flow outward and bring life to a desert... he's very charming. You know, he's only on leave for a week. Just show him a good time. I can't show him a good time. You show him a good time. - Regina, it's for you! - Hey. Love can be a gas... Light as air and assuming the shape of its container... I mean, it's crazy. I have been so busy with other people's lives That i have paid no attention to what's happening in mine. Like Todd I mean, if he has feelings for me, We need to talk about that and about my feelings about his feelings for me or if i have feelings for him and my feelings about that. You know? So i'm just gonna open up some wine and settle in for a nice chat. White wine and feelings... He's a very lucky man. Good night, miss Newly. Good night, Frank. Hey, Todd? Hey. Can we just talk about some... Hi. You there. Hi. Hi. Sam, this is Cameron. We were just going out. Yeah. Okay, good. Hi. Th's... You'll like that. Yeah. And him. You'll like him, 'cause he's not... gay. You wanted to talk? Me? No. I'm good. Have fun. Yeah. Plus, i only got enough wine for one, so... So yeah. And like matter, love can't be created or destroyed. It's always there, even
