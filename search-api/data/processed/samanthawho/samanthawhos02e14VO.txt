He's gonna be so embarrassed when he remembers he looked like that. Oh,god. We all looked like that. - Oh,I know. - Oh,my god. See,when we were 13, we were so in love with tommy wylder. We bought the,uh, "king of hearts" album,and we cracked up, because you said it sounded like the "king of farts." And then you said I was the queen of farts, and we-- we laughed so hard that my mom tried to pull over the car. I want to meet him. I think he'll find that story charming. Hey,samantha,why don't you ask him if he's looking for a new crib? And we could put it on our business cards-- "real estate agents to the stars." it already says that on our business cards,mom. So now it'll be true. Still,I don't get it.I don't get how we could worship somebody that we've never met and who shows absolutely no interest in us at all. What is all this talk again? If you don't want to go to church with us,don't go. No. No. Sam is gonna marry tommy wylder. And we're gonna sell him a new house. Oh,guys,I'm only going on my first date with him tonight. Don't do it,sam.A musician is married to one woman, and her name is lady rock 'n' roll. And then he has lots of other women he has sex with. Howard, shis her mother's daughter.She has a lu for the rockers. Probably gonna marry one like I did. You were married to somebody before dad? Why does nobody tell me this stuff? No,I mean your father. He was the lead singer in a band. Yeah,the shadowmakers. The what-y hooters? He was good. You should have seen him on stage. His sweat would sort of glisten in his chest hair, and he'd lick his lips really slow-- okay,okay,too far. Too far. Oh,but then a certain little someone came along, and he dided to lose the leopard skin pants and get a real job. Because of me? Oh,great. I killed my father's dream.

We're getting audited next month. I turn my back for one second, you stop practicing the guitar? Practicing for what? For a gig! I've been putting feelers out. You know phil remy over at the ramada? He said that if that gal that plays the piano--You know,with the lazy eye and the fog machine? If she gets sick, he's gonna call. Now here. Wait a second. I got you something. I'm not playing the ramada. I'm going through the books. Look. Look,look,look.It's just like the one you used to wear! Come on,just for a second. oh. Ay,take me right now. oh!Take me right now. And we're going to jail. Now,now. Tommy wylder. We're together. I'm with him. I'm actually with him,with him. So lunch was fun,huh? Do you wanna do something else? I kinda have to be in the studio. Oh. You're writing a song,huh? Is it about me? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm sure it's really hard to rhyme things with "samantha." Maybe "pantha"? I don't know. I - I just wanted to say I'm a big fan, and,uh,I play some guitar myself. Back off,frank! Okay,he is not public property,so chill. Fans,huh? I mean,whatisthat? Speaking of which,did you call me,like, ten times today and hang up? No,I don't-- No,I don't think so. You know what?Maybe my phone dialed from inside my purse, because that happens to people, for reals. - U wanna come up for a sec? - no. We could watch your music videos-- what? Sam,I think it's time for me to step off. "step off"? It's been fun,but you--You're starting to get a little freaky on me. It's michelle,isn't it? who? From your song, "paris lover." You sing about that girl michelle. It just seemed like it must've been really intense. I mean,the lyrics are really sweet and everything,but she kind of seems like a wacko. Right. So I'm gonna take a really confusing way home. Don't try and follow me,okay? Good-bye. T- tomm y,I-- No,come on! Don't do that! I'm not usually like this! I'm not-- I love you! I love you! Don't... Go. Come on. Let's move you inside quietly... Like a "pantha." I love him. Here you go,sweetie. I brought you peanut butter and pickle on an english muffin. It's-- it's one of your favorites. Is it really? Because you usually say that when you're just trying to clean out the fridge. This one's real. Eat it. God,what happened to me? I was fine,un-until I-I saw tommy up on that stage, and then all of a sudden, I was just like... Oh,my god! Uhh! - Samantha... - So... It's designed that way. You're there in the dark, everything falls away, and it's just the two of you. And the passion... No one has ever understood you the way he does. Oh,god,no,I know! And your heart starts to beat a little faster, and you get flushed... And you imagine that the two of you belong together. And then your father starts doing this little thing with his hips,and you-- no! No! Too far. Too far. Oh,boy. I've seen that look before. Another victim of rock 'n' roll,huh? Musicians stink. You should be thanking me for saving you from that life. Well,thank you. Why? Because I... Killed your dream? It's okay.Mom told me that you gave up everything because she got pregnant with me. What? You told her that? Well,I'm not gonna lie to her,howard. You know how I feel about that. Sammy,you had nothing to do with how my life turned out. Okay?imade my choice. In fact,you were my excuse. Howard,just tell her you quit because you wanted to be a responsible father. No,I quit because I didn't want to be a musician anymore. That's not true! Stop that. You loved playing in that band. No,youloved that I was playing in that band. Admit it-- If-- if I was the waiter when you walked into the club that night instead of the guy up on the stage,would you have given me a second look? Yes... No. But-- but look,l-look, look,look. Look,howard... You haven't picked up a guitar in over 30 years. You'll leave your fingernail clippings in the sink. I'm still here. Wait a minute.So now you're saying I just went into debt over a guilt guitar for absolutely nothing? You wanna take it back? Yeah,i wanna take it back. No,not for nothing. Oh. For a few days,I got to... Look at your father with that guitar,and it was 35 years ago all over again. Regina, every time I look at you,it's 35 years ago again. Okay,if music can stir passions ofallkinds, then chances are, it can also soothe them. dad? Do you think you've got one more gig left in you? All right,let's here it for the shadowmakers! Shadowmakers? Dena,I am so sorry. Look,I know I don't rember that tommy was our thing, but just because I don't remember stuff doesn't mean that it didn't happen and that it didn't matter to somebody else. So I really need you to keep reminding me when it did,okay? Okay. Remember that time we called all the hotels to see where he-- I don't remember. Remember that time there was only one album-- no,I still have amnesia,though.Is there cake? Yes,yes,yes,yes. They're gonna blow the roof off the ramada. what are you doing with her?! You are terrible at this. No,it's okay. She broke up with tommy, and-- and she apologized for being an ass. - I mean,reallyan ass. You weresuchan ass. - I know. All right,fine,great.Now let's go. I'm at a dog party. So I get it now-- nostalgia. With nostalgia,idohave a past-- the same one as theirs.
