Season 2 Episode 19</font> Okay,before you attack me or anything like that, I want you to know that there are a lot of plainclothes officers in this room, and I may or may not be one of 'em. You do realize you ruined my life? Really? Gosh,I think that having $400 million would make everything-- okay,I'm--I'm sorry. Look,you--you need to understand something. That person who broke up your marriage is not me. I read the e-mails. I saw the romantic things that he wrote to his "emerald-eyed beauty with the sunshine hair. " Okay,well,there are certain resemblances,yes. But what I'm saying is that that "me" was hit by a car and got amnesia. Seriously,I don't remember anything from before that day, and I am nothing like that person at all. And what,you're not with him anymore? No.Not even a little bit. If I could take it back,I would. Damn it. What? Well,you're nice.That's what. I spent an entire year working up to this. I even learned to like martinis so I could throw one in your face. You still can. Here,go,go,go. Hey,I'm stealing your husband. You better stop me. All the fun's out of it. Samantha,after I read those e-mails,I was so angry. I spent an entire year at an ashram breathing in forgiveness and sleeping on a cot made of hemp, which got pretty tiny because I had to smoke a little of it every night to get to sleep. I was-- I-I was such a mess. No.Oh,come on,no,no,no.Don't cry.Please. Look--look,look,listen-- listen to me. If there is anything-- anything at all that I can do to make it up to you,I-I--anything... help me get back together with him. Uh,I was thinking,like,a ride to the airport. Something like that.But,yeah,sure. Okay. Okay,calendar up. I am blacked out on the 10th,the 14th and the 20th. Oh,but two saturdays from now I got us tickets the murder mystery train. Oh,I can'T.It's andrea's wedding. I don't have that. All right,fine.Just tell her that she has to pay me back for the tickets. Oh,no,sorry. I don't-- I don't get a plus one. I'm not a plus one. We're in a committed relationship. Yes,we are,unless I meet someone off my free pass list,of course. Considering most of them are characters from "the lord of the rings, " I think you're pretty safe. Tell andrea we're coming. I can'T.I mean,andrea thinks that couples shouldn't be invited unless they're married. All right,fine.You know,if it's just about bemarried,dena,then... why don't we just... get married? Was that supposed to be a proposal? I don't know.It can be. You want it to be? Bottom line it for me.What do you want? We do it by october,we can file jointly. How much do you make? Nice. -Very romantic. -What? You know,chase chapman,you could learn a thing or two from aragorn, the rightful king of gondor,about how to treat a lady. You keep this up,and you'll be my minus one. Your... andrea? Are you okay? I'm good.I'm not hungry. What? Wait. This isn't my fice. Okay,are you still not eating? I have to be crazy thin for this wedding. Women I have hated my entire life are coming from around the world to be jealous of me. They're not leaving until they're in tears. Yes,but you can't not eat for two weeks. I'm fine. I licked two stamps before I came in. Okay,that is not what I meant--and she's down. tyler,can you please come in here and wheel ms. Belladonna into her office? Oh,and you know what? Will you call mr. Funk and tell him that I will have dinner with him tonight? I'm sorry? It's not a date. I am setting him up with his ex-wife. Awesome. Still in the game. Uh,you know what? I'm just gonna e-mail him myself,okay? "samantha,no words,no music,no sigh can give voice "to this feeling. I am silenced by your beauty. " "there's nowhere I'd rather be "than beside you, waiting for the moment your eyes open and give light to my day. " "The world says I'm a wealthy man,but I'm always poor when you say good-bye. " "Ts slope I'm on is too slippery,"and I can't climb back up,so I just let go and fall into you. hey,sam! I saw that you were online. You good?What's going on? Nothing.I,um... I-I,um... wait,sam? Sam? The picture froze again. Sam? so... when I rented it out for the two of us,I thought it would be romantic. And it'S... not. No,it's--it... it just sorta seems like the place is going out of business,that's all. Thank you. Thanks. So,um... -I wanna talk to you about gigi. -Okay. Um,champagne? Um,no,thank you. I-I won't even be here that long. -Thank you. -Thanks. Grilled cheese? That's the first meal we ever ate together. I'm sorry.You--you were saying? Yeah.Gigi.Okay. I think that... you need to get back together with her. saM... I don't want gigi. I want you. Well,I tried. Samantha? Turn off the light. What are you doing in my bed? I was clubbing,and I experienced a temporary forgetting of my address. Mom? Are you actually going to meet dad in the R.V.,Or is he,like, resting in the basemenor something? I am meeting up with him tomorrow. And what are you doing coming home so late? Well,you'll be happy to know I went out with funk,and I kissed him, which is the exact opposite of what I wanted to do. Now I don't--I don't know how I feel about it,because... well,I mean,partly because of todd. But you know,todd's not here. But because of gigi,and--and she wants to be with him,so she's not gonna like this at all. Or maybe she'll be okay with it.I don't know. She's all kinda like forgiving now. oh,get that. I can't get up. It's--it's like I'm looking through the eyes of a bee. Hello,samantha. Gigi. You know where I live. That's cool. Your assistant told me that you had dinner with winston, and I was wondering if you might've talked to him about me. Yeah. Funny thing-- we did. Gigi,look,you know how you were talking about your ashram with the forgiveness? What did he say? I mean,I had to know. I don't even have a car here. And I'm so excited I had someone run me over. He said he likes you. So go get him,killer! why? Why did I kiss funk? I should not get involved. You know,now I'm just the other woman... again. Don't worry. I've got your back. more flowers from mr. Funk. Get those outta here,man! What are you trying to do,geme killed? She found out that funk's ex-wife is the one that ran her over. Mr. Engle in 4 will be disappointed. In the tenant pool,he had "disgruntled classmate. " Most of the others had me. Is there any chance that I've mastered,like, a deadly martial art that'll just come back to me right when I need it most? Oh,god! No. maybe she's not dangerous anymore. You know,she's been at an ashram. You know what?You're right. She spent the last year trying to get peaceful. That's one explanation. Okay,what? Often,the original purpose of a pilgrimage to ashram was not for tranquility, but for cleansing and instruction in the art of war, particularly in the use of enchanted weapons. Well,let's see if they're any match for these magic scissors. No.No. This does not constitute a tip. I wasn't,um,expecting to run into,uh,to see you today. He's not returning my calls. Who isn't? Winston. You said that he wanted to get together,but he's not calling me back. Yodon't mind if I just cut some stuff while we're talking? They just happen to be the best and sharpest scissors I've ever owned. Fine. Do you think he's seeing someone else? Yeah,that's not what I wanted to cut. Because if he is,samantha-- hands where I can see 'em! Just,I mean,just 'cause I love those nails. flowers! From that funk guy. For you! No,they're-- okay,you can go now,tyler.Just don't speak.Go.Go. Just go. Here's the card. No,no,no,no. "I can't wait to kiss you again. I'm waiting for you at chez monique. omg,sam.Thank you! Don't go. -No? -No,god,no. You wanna play the game,right? I mean,I-I would say wait,you know,at least aear. You know,maybe go meet someone. Maybe have some kids.Move to canada. That'll drive him crazy. I'll call you! Oh,I can't wait. Drive slowly. Don't hit anyone. Tyler,I need you--oh.Of course! Oh,come on,funk. Pick up,pick up,pick up. No,do not go to voice mail.Do not go to voice mail.Do not go to voice mail. Hey,hey,it's me. Listen,when you get this message,get out of the restaurant immediately,all right? Delete this message. Do not call me back. do not e-mail me. We need to cool it until gigi is out of the picture. All right?! which might be sooner than I thought. there,sleepyhead. It's your cousin cindy. Sam,I don't have amnesia. Well,it was worth a shot. Look,gigi,I'm sorry. It was--it was an accident. I understand. You still want him. And now that I'm with winston,it's eating you alive. What?! And now your darker side has taken over. My darker side? Are you kidding me,lady? Thank you,lauren.That was fun. And how is the patient? The patient is fine. The visitor can't seem to handle that you're in love with me. In love with... you? Yeah,you know,the flowers? And the note? The lunch? I can see you winking. You know,I think I'm blocking an ambulance. She tried to kill me! She tried to kill me first! She put me in a coma! So you don't have amnesia! Yes,I do. But I remember things sometimes when I'm really,really stressed out. Just like now. I just remembered I can juggle. And I remember that you ran me over with your car first. All right,I know I only have an honorary law degree,but none of that sounds okay. Hey,you know what?I'm not gonna live in fear, loing over my shoulder. Because you know what,lady? You and I--we're even. Because that girl that you were trying to kill-- you killed her. She's dead. In rhode island? Um,no. Me. And another thing,I'm not the other woman anymore, because he wants to be with me,which makes me... the woman and you the other woman,which technically gives me every right to run you over. All right,you know,that's not exactly-- but she has a point,gigi.Okay? You gotta start living your life and stop waiting for things that are just not gonna happen. not gonna happen. You're right. You are. Sam,letting it go. White light in. Black smoke out. God,I want a cigarette. Thanks. Sam? Oh,and,sam? Yes? That's the last time you should ever turn your back on me. Do you wanna go to dinner tonight? Can'T. Brushing the dogs' teeth. You know what?You have really painted me into a corner here. So I'm just gonna... what are you doing? Calendar up. October 10th. Church,preacher. Let's pull the trigger on this one. what are you doing?Get up! No,no,no.I know it's not romantic enough. I was gonna do it at night. You don't get it.You're not proposing wrong. I don't wanna get married. I... get it. No problem. No,no,that's not what I mean.I... it's not that I don't wanna get married. I-I do. I'm just afraid that marriage can't live up to the way I've always pictured it. It's the same reason that every christmas I leave one package unopened. You know,when it's still wrapped and under the tree,it can be--be anything. The fantasy of what it could be is always better than... opening up to find socks. For the record,dvd player,a,uh,bicycle-- those are really great gifts. But... just remember... if you ever get cold... you're gonna want that pair of socks. Thanks for being patient. Yeah,sure. I just need to marry someone in october,'cause I don't know how to delete this. they say opposites attract. I wish it were that simple. Dena gave me these scottie dog magnets. Aligned correctly,they come together. Pointed the wrong way,no matter how hard they try... I know,howard. I'm sorry. I know.Just--just one more day. I am--I am absolutely swamped with work. Okay,I love you,too. They push farther and farther apart. That's what everyone's trying to do,isn't it? Find that scottie dog and come together? clicK. are you ready? Yeah. I think I am. Let me just get my coat. sam?Heo? Sorry I'm late.I-I got hung up. Did I catch you in your knickers? Hello? Are we being cheeky then?
