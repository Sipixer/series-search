"i'm sorry you feel that way"... and you're good to go. so you're doing something without doing anything. it sounds like a trick. no,the trick is to show them that you're listening. yeah,it's a- it's a gesture. it like when regina and i were dating. she said that she wanted a ferrari someday, so i listened,i nodded,and i went out and i bought her a toy car,a little matchbox deal. i said it was just until i got her the real thing. 35 years,and i'm still waiting. r hey. didn't hear you knock. i had key made while i was out. samantha keeps forgetting to give me one. did you have fun?

well,shut up,and i'll tell you. now remember i said i got a second chance because i got hit by that car? well,here's your car. listen to me. what you do now is up to you, but what you cannot do ever again is use the excuse that everyone is always bailing on you. now go. go. seriously,the back door is over there. thank you. sam,run for it! i sang like a canary. right here. i did it. yeah,me. this never happens when i rescue newfies. sorry! dena,please say something. i'm so sorry. - i just- i did it because i really- - i know. i know. because you're good. you know what i'm good at? holding my pee for 12 hours straight. didn't know that before. thanks! oh! they are so cute. i can't decide. if i don't take both of them, do you have to put one of them down? did you come here to bail us out or to gloat? i think i just answered that question. andrea,please let me out. i really have to go. - really - yeah. oh,don't do that. let's go. you're sprung. ooh. okay. okay. i'll jusdo it. just leave me here. i'm a loser. no,no,no,no,no,no. no,i'm not a loser? no,i mean i'm not going to listen to this. i posted bail. i've done my part. i codn't even change one tiny person. no,not that tiny person. she didn't want to be changed. look at me. i've tried to change you for an entire year. you're just not cooperating. maybe i should have just run her or. you know,it's not too late. do you have your car here? enough with the car. this magic car that suddenly changed your life- did that car help you quit your job? no. did it move you out of your parents' house? no. did it run that 5k for heart disease? you still owe me 50 bucks for that. oh,my gosh. every single day since you woke up from that coma, i have to hear about how hard it is to make these choices. and now you're gonna say it's all because of some car. you should market that thing. the good-mobile? there you go. you're right. i do work hard. it's really,really hard being this good. no kidding. it's exhausting just watching you. come on. another great thing about my friends are that they are patient. they understand that i'm just learning things now that i should have known a long time ago, like how the only person you can really change is yourself. see,the thing is, if you're so busy worrying about other people that you're t paying attention to your own life, you might miss out on something really,really important. that's why from now on, i've got to keep my eyes on the road ahead of me, stay focused on my own path. it's not always easy,but it's worth it. listen up,people. if you happen to come across a body part, don't forget to use your emergency while. but i don'have to worry about anything because no matter where that road takes me, i know i'm gonna have my best friends right beside me... keep movin'. not here to make
