're infrica! well,we've been gone a whole day. i just want to see if chase misses me. you think this is what africa sounds like? he won't be able to hear you over the blenders. then just let me check his old text messages. if you make me spill this drink,you're dead! - oh,brent. - brent. what are you,uh,what are you doing in miami?

i love you very much. i miss you. i hope you're not dead." - dead? - that's not our usual sign-off. it's usually,"i hope you still like me." why would you be dead? all we know at the moment is that sudanese rebels have sealed off the entire city with no communicationic or travel i sam,isn't that where we're supposed to be? i did it again. i made it worse. from salamani and the republic of chad, this is kenneth esther alaric reporting. that's the name of the town. that's where sam is. well,i'm sure she's fine. she's not fine,howard. she's dead. she is not dead. willou stop that? they're not reporting any casualties. i'm taking this very well,i think. well,i'll be sure to thank the pharmaceutical industry. also because she appeared to me in a vision on my walk that night to tell me she's at peace and that i've been an excellent mother. god,i should have just told them the truth, and now the truth is worse than any lie i could have even make up. i just want to call home and tell him that i'm okay. you saw on tv. there's no phone service. they'll know we're fine when we get home. we can't go home,andrea. there's no way in or out. we are stuck in africa. well,maybe the hotel will give us free drinks, like they do when you're stuck on the tarmac. you are not helping. well,i want to stay. we're having fun. that's all you wanted,isn't it? you didn't want to help me. you just wanted a vacation. i wanted a vacation with you, you know,the way it used to be,you and me. this whole year,i just-i'm watching us just go like this... and i have been trying to get you back to normal. you were my africa. you know,i'm so sorry that i turned out to be a better person than i was. so am i,because where does that leave me? i mean,where do i fit in? i mean,what purpose do i have in your life? right now... i need you to get us out of here. right now i need you to dig down deep inside of that devious brain of yours and help come up with a plan. i guess i can sleep with a guard. - thank you. - two,if i had to. okay,good. um,and then i will, uh,i'll commandeer a humvee. no,no. you can't drive stick. see,this is why i need you, because you know these things. howard. howard,look at this. a picture of a 12-foot snake they caught in africa, and that big bulge in the middle is what it just ate. now they're saying it's a goat or a dog, but i think we both know who's in there. no. no. i- i-it's in the congo,regina. see,that's nowhere near where sam was. oh,a mother knows her own child. hey,everyone. i'm back from africa. - oh! oh! - sammy,oh,my god! - samantha! samantha! - my god. sam,oh! oh,yeah,yeah. are you okay? yeah,i'm fine. i'm fine. i'm just like... gonna turn in 'cause zulu time's got me all... wonky,so... wait. let us at least look at you. yeah,what happened over there? oh,you know,i have suppressed so much of it. - but-but how did you get out? - one of us slept with a guard. - andrea went with you? - mm-hmm. and we swam. yeah,across a river. river? well,there's no rivers in that part. - excuse me. where you there? - will you stop interrogating her? all that matters is that she's home. - can i ask her if she saw a monkey? - no. i knew you were safe. i had a vision on my walk, and you told me not to worry and that i was a good mother. i'm proud of you,kiddou di know you had it in you. yesh,well¡­¡­ oh,and don't forget to call todd. we phoned him when we saw the news. i'm sure he's as worried as we were. great. hey,frank. i've been trying to call todd, but his voice mail's full. - is he up there? - he is not. he raced out of here this morning in a state of agitation, said he had some shots to get before it was too late. what? shots? oh,no. on,no. frank,todd went to africa to save me. - but you're not in afri - - yeah,you see the needles. then you can judge. come on! hurry, just gotta try to find some kind of itinerary or-or some clue of where he might have gone. here. look through these. oh,god,i will not forgive myself if something happens to him and if he gets hurt. yes,the odds of getting hurt in africa do go up if you actually go. all right,i chickened out. all right? africa is a very scary place. oh,todd you're the only person on the planet who would go halfway around the world to save me, and i was too self-involved to see it. sam? - sam? - yeah? oh! to?! oh,thank god! i didn't go to africa. i lied. i am so sorry,but it meant so much to me that you were gonna go there to rescue me, and i'm just so glad that i stopped you before you went. oh,god. i wasn't going to africa. - huh? - and that a good-bye for frank. no,but you-you- you hurried out 'cause you-you had to get shots before it was too te. shots of a playground with my camera. i'm doing an ad for a shoe company. you weren't going to africa to save me? no. how could you not go to africa to save me? - because you're not there. - yeah,but as far as you know,i am. i mean,i'm-i'm there right now, and where are you,you know? you're not there. neither are you. but i was going to go. but you didn't go. yeah,but how would you know that? - becausi know you. - no. no,yo not know me. - you didn't go,did you? - yeah,but i was going to go. but you didn't,and i don't care. isn't that what you want-a guy who sees you for who you are? no. no,i know who i am. i need someone who thinks that i am better than i know that i am. i- i'm sorry? oh,damn it. you know... fine. fine. i'm just gonna be a better person,all right? will that get everyone off my ass? no more taking the easy way out. i am going to do things the hard way. - you're going to africa? - no,i am kicking you out. what? and that is very hard for me to do but change begins at home. but don't hurry or anything. you can stay here for a week or so. so do you not wanna date? todd,no. don't you see what this is about? i never see what this is about. okay,so my dentist has this fun facts poster in his office, and did you know a rocket has to go 25,000 miles an hour to get into orbit? oh,and the american buffalo isn't really a buffalo at all. it's a bison. anyway,25,000 miles an hour- that's a lot of force keeping us right where we are. so go ahead and tell your daughter to reach for the stars, just give her a break if she falls a little short. what do you mean,you didn't go to africa? look,i'm sorry i lied to you. you know,and you're right, i'm not the person that i want to be. but you know what? i'm not the person that i was either. and that girl that i used to be- she wouldn't have even thought about going to africa,you know? so i'm trying to change. i'm like those rockets,those early rockets, who-who,you know,they tried and sometimes they failed, but they-they're- they had progress. samantha,you did go to africa. what? no. yes. and you want to know how i know? because tomorrow morning, the "action news" is coming here to interview the mother of the girl that went to africa. ??? now if you want dinner,go wash up. sorry,dad. are you mad? mad? i thought you were gonna tell
