(rewinds tape) see, our footwork is really sloppy. mm. well, i think we look pretty good. no, "pretty good" is not enough to beat paula drake. oh, i see what this is about-- your little rivalry with paula drake. yes, it is, her and her smug little grin. she beats me at everything-- this and best tulips and best chili cook-off. oh, and that daughter of hers-- she's a doctor. she's married. she has two children. you know, and you're single and you're unemployed, and after your coma, you had to relearn how to peel an orange. hey, i got that in one day. howard, honey, we've gotta practice that grapevine, or we're never gonna get first place. well, third place is a screwdriver set. that's something we could use. hey, hey. what's this? it's one of your college recitals. i was in a recital, and you taped over it? how was i supposed to know you wanted to see that again? i mean, what am i supposed to think every time i want to tape an "oprah" that... (singsong voice) "oh, sam might get amnesia. she might want to see that first birthday party"? i used to dance. y-you know, i don't want to sound conceited or anything, but i'm pretty badass. (howard) yeah, you were incredible. yeah, you take after me. feel that thigh. yeah, hard as a rock. feel it. later. why didn't you tell me? i mean, you point out every lousy thing about my life, but the one talent that i do have, nobody mentions it? we didn't want you to get a big head. i want to see it again. i want to see it again. shouldn't you be hunting for apartments? i set a few traps. i'll check them tomorrow. i know your game. you have no intention of looking for an apartment. you're just gonna keep mooching off sam. i was looking, okay? you know, i thought i had all this money coming from this wedding i shot, but the bride-- you know, she didn't like the proofs. so what, she's just not gonna pay, and you're gonna let her get away with that? no, i left messages, e-mail. i don't know what else to do. i'm an attorney. come to my office tomorrow, and i'll show you what else you can do. i just told you, i don't have money for a lawyer. are you slow? look, i get to bring a bride to tears and kick you out of sam's apartment? i should be paying <i>you.</i> well, you know what? we should switch things out before we go. that paper towel holder goes home with me. this spatula goes back to the city with you. look at you. you're all grown up, got your own spatula. i did a good job. oh, crap! what? what? what? (lowers voice) paula drake. i know i should never leave the house without a bra. i don't think we need paula drake to make that a rule, mom. what are you doing? putting on lipstick. she's my nemesis. she's your nemesis? what does she-- does she have an underground lair? regina! oh. h-hi! i thought that was you. what are you doing here? buying a bra, i hope. hi, paula. samantha, hello. how is your head injury doing today? i'm not brain-damaged. i have my own spat... ula. oh, regina, did i see that you signed up for the dance at the club again? oh, yes, you did. yes, you did. in fact, i think howard and i are gonna give you and charlie a little run for your money this year. of course you will. like i said at the chandler's anniversary party... oh, faux pas. were you not invited? anyway, i told everyone that no matter how many times the newlys lose, they just keep on going. they may be failures, but they are not quitters. hey, they're not failures either. of course they're not. will you have a special seat to watch your parents lose? she won't be there. she's moved back to the city. oh, no. i'll be there. i'll be there, 'cause we're gonna kick your butts. we? yep, that's right. i am your new partner, and i am excellent. two women can't dance together at the club. oh, yes, they can, thanks to those two nice gay lawyers who just moved down the block. it's a whole new world. yeah, well, we made them cry, and we'll make you cry, <i>too.</i> oh, yeah? you want to see some crying? 'cause we're gonna bring you to your <i>knees</i> and not in some cool dance move way. ah. what just happened? i don't know, but i got that same high i got when i peeled that orange.

(inhales deeply) mmm. that really does smell good. what is that look for? she said herself she knew we couldn't beat paula drake. she practically moved back home. you guys have been out in that garage ten hours a day. she did it to be with you. howard, please. i know my own daughter. she hasn't wanted to spend time with me since she was 12 years old. can we please go back out there? we've got a lot of work to do. you know, i think i'm done for tonight. i don't even <i>want</i> any pie. that bride messengered over the check this morning. there's enough here for first and last month's rent, plus security. huh. what i said must have gotten through to her. no, what you said scared the crap out of her. i had to talk her out of a restraining order. great. so... now i can move out. yeah, and sam can get on with her life. and there we are. mm-hmm. thanks, <i>ann-drea.</i> on-drea. right. hey. and hey, listen. um... you're not gonna end up alone, making meat loaf for one. and somewhere out there, there's a girl who's just gonna-- sorry. i can't do it. it's too weird. we tried. (whispers) who is that guy? (man) that was drake and romero! you guys are next. i will deny that we had this conversation, but i'm gonna give you guys some extra light. i was just warming 'em up for you, regina. where's charlie? poor thing hurt his knee, but fortunately, my good friend mateo, 3-time international ballroom dancing champion, was able to be with me. so when do i get my money? now please welcome next to the floor-- newly and newly... and the cha-cha. you ready, regina? hurt your knee. i think the expression is "break a leg." howard, i swear to god, if you don't hurt your knee right now, i'll break it with a pipe. oh! oh! the pain--it's on fire. oh! all right, easy, de niro. flamingo down. flamingo down. weber and duncan on deck. we're on! i don't believe it. (panting) what's going on? are you okay? i'm so happy you came. oh. i was afraid that was gonna be our last fight. no, mom. i want to have lots of fights with you. it's only been a year since we started over, right? what kid leaves home after a year? oh, it's getting worse. it's like a branding iron searing my flesh. (under breath) it hurts. we get it. (man) so... last chance for newly and newly? not on your life. ready? what? me? mom, you won't win. no, samantha, <i>we</i> won't win. i was hoping you would ask. here. take this. take this. okay. oh, good. all right. positions. positions. oh, my god. we're doing it. head. * lilly runs when you look away * (samantha) you know when you think something is going to go badly, and it goes just okay, so you think it's going great? it's probably worse than you ever imagined. (pink martini) * lilly runs when you look away * * lilly leaves kisses on your collar * * lilly, lilly, lilly, lilly, stay * all right, are you sure you want more light? because i was thinking more darkness. * pressed up against the glass * * he prays that she will pass * now he's living with his mother * * lilly comes when you stop to call her * you know, we don't have to go through this to see each other. just come over. i'll be there. it's good to know. thanks. well, call first. i do have a life. yeah. (samantha) okay, maybe i was wrong. maybe i didn't lose every good thing with my amnesia. some things are in there to discover. some can be relearned. and others, if they're important,???
