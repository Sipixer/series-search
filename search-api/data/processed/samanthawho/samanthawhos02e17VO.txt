Oh,sam,I don't want any trouble. What are you doing here? Well,fiddle-dee-dee. I'm here for my maid of honor fittin',sugar. dena is my maid of honor now,honey pie. see,she's wearing the hat. She's wearing the maid of honor hat. I am wearing the hat,sam. yes,well,you asked me to byour maid of honor,and guess what? I'm not going anywhere. Now let's talk bridal shower. I was thinking maybe some sloppes,some ribs or maybe a dancing bear. You don't have to rassle it. That's okay.That's dena's job n I have to wrestle a bear? What is the theme of this wedding? Oh,also,my maid of honor speech. Oh,no,no,no,no. No one said I had to make a speech. I was thinking about starting off with a dirty limerick... in a wee irish brogue. I can't--I can't tal in public. I-I freeze up,and I swallow air. I cannot believe you're doing this to me. you started it. You lured me into a job,and then you fired me. You took advantage of our friendship. I blew off a fake job to go and plan my wedding. Big whoop. A fake job? You got hired to do a job that you know nothing about because the boss wants to get into your pants. It's a joke. Oh,yeah? You want to know what a joke is? Marrying a gay guy and thinking it's an actual wedding. You know what? It's so funny,people are laughing behind your back. Oh,like they're laughing at you at chapman & funk? I wouldn't know,because the laughing that they're laughing at you is drowning it out! But possibly! A joke! I can start with a joke and use my little hand puppet,little dena,and,you know,' cause she has the courage to say things I don'T. Hell everyone. Has,uh,that one been in yet? She got a 9-1-1 text from an ice sculptor and flew outta here. Oh,good. Then we can get some work done. Almost done already. I divided the proposs into yeses,maybes and nos. There's only one pile. Those are the nos. Well,why even do the maybes,then? I'm an optimist. You rejected the red cross? Showboaters. "we're the red cross. We save victims of war and disasters. " Um,cheryl,I,uh,know we haven't quite pinned down the mission statement yet, but the gist of it is we give money away. And that's what they want-- handouts. I could u a million dollars.Maybe I'll apply. I worked my tailbone off for every penny I ever got. Nobody ever gave me a free ride. That's nuts. Cheryl,have you noticed a downturn in the economy? I'm not going anywhere. I signed a contract,too. Dad? What? Oh,it's you.I'm sorry. Whole neighborhood's out. Yeah,I saw that. So what were the "beavers" trying to get this time? One of those fancy washer/dryers that talk to each other. All I did was yank a couple of wires, and now mr. Mcclatchey's respirator is running off his car battery. The abernathy kid picked the wrong day to bring the incubator chicks home from school. The high school hockey game... let's just say we've had a day. You want some chardonnay? It's warm,but it does the job. Dad? Hey,sweetie. How's the boss? I suck. I have two lawyers. I have a thousand applicants. And I have 2 days to start giving away $30 million. There's nothing but problems. Could you--could you hold that for a second? Now that,that's a problem,okay? What you have is a job,a job that you always wanted. You just shocked me. Well,so you stumble a little bit out of the gate.Who cares? do you think I knew what I was doing when I started out? I mean,it's not that I'm bad at it.It's just... the truth is,dad,I don't deserve it. Andrea's right. It's just a joke job... and the only reason I have it is because some billionaire wantto get into my pant-- ... tomine club. It's a very exclusive club. Here's a secret. Everyone is a fraud. Nobody knows what they're doing. I mean,do you think I have any idea how to fix this electrical panel? But I am not letting your mother win. That is not an option. Okay. I get it. I just gotta do it. It gets easier,though,doesn't it,daddy? Boy,wouldn't that be great? You know,for every problem you solve,you create three more. You know,and then you-- you hire a staff. And then the staff has kids. Now they all want to take the afternoons off so that they can take their kids trick-or-treating. I mean,since when did halloween become a holiday,huh? Daddy. But,hey,it's gonna be great for you,okay? Okay. For me,you know,I think I've had a good run. What? You're quitting? Yeah. Thanks for the talk,kiddo. Hey,regina... we have to talk about the rest of our lives. What have you done to your father? Good morning,tyler. Will you grab all the proposals and bring them into my office? And hold all my calls. I love your sense of purpose. And your...bouncy ringlets. prenatal care would cost so little, and the effect on infant mortality would be enormous. it shouldn't be that easy to end up in the street. It should be hard. god asks us to save his children,not to prove we're virtuous,but to fill our hearts with joy. What's this? It's my resignation. I was wrong. You're not a joke. You ever wonder why we're friends? No. Because the truth is,I have no idea what I'm doing. And you were the only person who would tell me that. And I think it's because you and I will tell each other the things that other people won'T. Or should. I mean,like you and your wedding. Who else is gonna say to you,"andrea,stop. What's up with the gay dude? " No one. But seriously,the guy is,like,super gay. I kn I kn Okay,fine,look. When I was 6,I would play dream wedding like every little girl would do. And my cat would be the ring bearer. And I'd wear this big dress,and--and I'd have a big pink cake,and there'd be birds. And then when I got older,then I'd play divorce attorney. And now the guys that I date-- I don't wanna marry them. And if I did,I'd run off to vegas or a courthouse or something,but... the little 6-year-old still wants that day. You wanna take that dream away from a little girl? Nope. You know that the cats would eat the birds,right? So what do you wanna do? I want you and i to learn this job together. And I want you to get rid of the crazy lady. Done. I already have a plan. Do I want to hear it? I don't kn Can you lie to a grand jury? Go. With my amnesia,I can't dream about things I don't remember,so I dream about the future. Some people don't even want to wake from their old dreams. Some just need to make new ones.
