with someone else who's not trustworthy. You have got to respect the people who voted for you. Her ex-husband had his own agenda. It won't be hard to prove he's a liar. Anne, it's me, Ted. I'm up in my office. Come up and I'll explain everything. I have some documents that'll prove your innocence. - Kim, it's me. Are you alone? - Chappelle ordered you back here. I'm not coming back until I find your father. I found out where Salazar is. A town in northern Mexico, Las Nieves. Jack's taking Ram Ãn there. You cannot go in there alone. Hector's gonna have an army. Promise me you're not gonna tell anyone you talked to me. Be careful. - What are you doing? - Your brother tried to kill me on the plane. That is not what we talked about. - My brother, I'm so glad to see you. - What's going on? I don't understand. I'll tell you in a minute. I promise. Good job, Jack. Come, we have a lot of work to do. - Where's Chappelle? - lnterrogation 820. Let's go. Talk to me. Almeida, what are you doing here? Get him out of the room. (beeps) (beeping) - He's in. - What are you talking about? Who's in? Jack. Gael and I have been working with Jack to get him undercover with Salazar. - That signal means he's in. - I don't understand. I'll explain everything. Right now we gotta call the president. So you're telling me Bauer's been playing a game with us all this time? It's no game, Ryan. He's back under with the Salazars? They trust him again? - That's what we're counting on, yeah. - I'm your boss. You should've come to me. You'll understand everything once I've explained it to the president. After that, if you feel I've acted inappropriately, do what you gotta do. I will. Count on it. - The president is coming on the line. - Thank you. - (woman) Go ahead. - This is Tony Almeida, director of CTU. - Mr Almeida. - Thank you for taking my call, Mr President. You're also on with my chief of staff, Wayne Palmer. I was told this is an urgent matter. Yes, sir, it is. It's also fairly complex. I'll try to keep it as clear and concise as I can. Go on. Everything that's happened today, from the infected body to Salazar's prison break, has been part of an elaborate sting operation. Sting operation? Planned and executed by Jack Bauer, Agent Gael Ortega and myself. Elaborate, Mr Almeida. Jack Bauer wanted to fill you in on the situation himself, sir. Jack Bauer is a fugitive from the law. If you'll indulge me, there's a video file you should see. It's on a designated CTU server. You can access the file with the pass code: Delta-3-Delta-5-9. Mr President, the fact that you are viewing this now means that I have completed the first phase of a secret operation. Contrary to what you've been told, the Salazars are not in possession of the virus. The idea that they are is a lie which I promoted, in order to achieve a more important goal. Please, sir, let me explain. A month ago, I learned that some Ukrainian scientists were trying to sell a weaponised virus. They were looking for a buyer with cash and credibility. I got their interest by suggesting the Salazars as potential buyers. If I could get the Salazars to agree, CTU would seize the virus as the sale took place. Our goal was to remove the virus stockpile from the marketplace, because it is, without a doubt, the most lethal threat that we have ever faced. But all of this hinged on me convincing the Salazars that I had switched sides. The only way to gain their trust was to break Ram Ãn Salazar out of prison. Mr President, I'm sorry for deceiving you, but I assure you it was a benign deception, and I assume complete responsibility for my actions. If things went wrong, you would have been exposed personally and politically. This was the only way I could see to avoid that risk. But now it's time for you to know the truth. I'm asking you to allow Almeida to coordinate an interdiction with the military, so we can take possession of this virus and keep it from our enemies. Thank you, Mr President. (Tony) Mr President. Keeping me in the dark on a matter of national security is inexcusable. - We were trying to protect you, sir. - I know what you were trying to do. It was a mistake, and you and your colleagues will take responsibility when this is over. - Yes, sir. I understand. - Where's Bauer now? In northern Mexico. He's setting up a meeting between the Salazars and the Ukrainians. When is this meeting to take place? In the next few hours, sir. Mr President, I'm requesting your permission to activate the interdiction plan. Under the circumstances, I don't have a choice but to say yes. But even if this plan works flawlessly, you haven't heard the last of it. I don't like decisions being taken out of my hands. Some decisions you wanna keep as far away from as you can. Not this decision. It's too important. Bauer had no right to keep me out of the loop. I disagree. Bauer protected you as he should have. When this is over, you'll probably have to punish him, but while you're punishing him, know this: he did do the right thing. Michelle. We need an extended network using protocol four. All right? Thanks, hon. I'm not so sure this is gonna work out well for you, Almeida. Maybe not, but right now I gotta help Jack. I don't need you looking over my shoulder. You work for me. You don't give orders, you take them. Yeah. Except the president put me in charge of this particular operation. Now, if you object, give him a call. I may be wrong, but I got the impression he's not in the mood for any squabbling today. Ryan, just let me do my job, all right? I'll be watching. Are you ready to listen, Ram Ãn? All right. Tell me how the man who betrayed us is now our friend. Bauer came to me with an opportunity. - An opportunity? - (Hector) Yes. To make more money than we have ever dreamed of. Bauer found out about a virus coming on the market. These men who have it, they're from the Ukraine, scientists. All they want to do is to make their money and disappear. How much are they asking? A hundred million. Al-Qaeda will pay us ten times as much. North Koreans too. The buyers are lined up. That's a billion dollars. - How do you know this virus is real? - The Ukrainians gave us a demonstration. Bauer delivered a body to Health Services. He used it to scare the Americans into letting you go. - The scientists, where are they now? - They're not far from here. I'm supposed to call their representative, a man named Michael Amador, in the hour. What's in it for you, Jack? 15 million dollars. We don't like each other, but it doesn't mean we can't do business together. I need your capital, and you need my access to the virus. I would never have thought that Jack Bauer was for sale. And I am not that sure now. My wife was killed because of my job. My daughter's never been the same since. This last year... Well, you know what I went through to bring you in. What did I get for it? A pat on the back. In the end, a demotion. And a heroin habit. I'm tired of putting my ass on the line for nothing. I'm done putting my ass on the line for nothing. If you don't want to go through with it, blow him away. But just remember, you're blowing away a billion dollars. Ram Ãn, no! - Are you crazy? - You are crazy for trusting him. - Give me the gun. - No. Who are you to refuse me? I run our business, not you. If not for me, me, you wouldn't even be here. Like I said... I have to call him within an hour. These men are not gonna wait around. There's too much at stake. You can either shoot me or let me make the call. But you better decide quickly. Jack's transponder pinpoints him somewhere east of Las Nieves, just south of the border. Satellite photos show that it's some sort of ranch or farm. Our units will hold a perimeter of ten miles. Communication is on a designated frequency. Nobody moves unless they go through me. Chloe, I want you and Chase to provide tactical assistance. Where is he? We're not sure. Chappelle ordered him back over an hour ago. Let me know when he gets back here. Let me make this perfectly clear. For the next few hours, all of our resources are dedicated to helping Jack get this virus. Any questions? All right, let's get back to work. Tony. - I spoke to Chase. - When? About an hour ago. He's not coming back to CTU. - Chappelle gave him a direct order. - He ignored it. He still doesn't know what's going on. None of us did. - Chase still thinks my father was captured. - And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack. Yes. He knows about Las Nieves. He's on his way there now. Probably by plane. - How did he find out about Las Nieves? - He said he followed a lead. Dammit, he'll blow Jack's cover and we'll lose this virus. - I know. - Maybe I can get ahold of him. Tony, you won't be able to reach him. - Why not? - He's gone dark. (panting) (keys in door) Hector thought you might be hungry. Look at you. You're pathetic. You're still a junkie, aren't you? It's the only real thing about you. It makes me sick to think that I ever believed you. You said you'd take me away from here. Remember? Do you remember, Jack? - Yes, I remember. - Yeah. There was one small thing you forgot to mention - you were a cop. Even that wouldn't matter if you'd meant what you said to me. - I meant everything I ever said to you. - Do you think I am stupid? You were doing a job. My compliments, you did it very well. But you know the saddest thing, Jack? You couldn't even be true to that. You betrayed Hector and Ram Ãn, betrayed me. And now you betray your own people. There are times when I despise Hector, but at least he's true to himself. He knows who he is. You? You're a man without a soul. Does Hector know about us? Do you think I'd be alive if he did? You know where he is right now? He's with Ram Ãn, deciding whether you should live or die. While you sit here shaking like a leaf. You need a fix, don't you? There's plenty here, Jack. Want me to get you a fix? Is that what you want? No. Jack, you were a man once. What happened to you? (groans) - (Tony) I'm sending his photo to you now. - (man) OK. Miguel, he's acting on his own authority. Tell Gutierrez that he's armed and dangerous. - OK. Then I'll confirm with you. - All right, good. My contact in Mexican lntelligence says he can get a man to Las Nieves in 20 minutes. - Agent Raphael Gutierrez. - Won't local police be quicker? No. If we bring them in, we might as well tell the Salazars that Chase is on his way. - What about our Delta teams? - lt'll take them over an hour. We're analysing the map of Las Nieves. There's only one landing strip. He won't use it. A landing strip's too exposed, especially if it's the only one. Run a topographical overlay. Find the most likely landing area besides the airfield. Yes, David? - Have you seen or heard from Anne? - Not for some time. Why? - I can't reach her. - Is it your health? No. I'm concerned about her. She was pretty ripped up after the debate. We're all pretty ripped up here, David. This allegation by Anne's ex-husband is no small bump in the road. There may be no way to defend ourselves against Keeler's accusation that Anne was involved in something illegal. You have to do better than that, Wayne. You like to deal with things head-on, but I think the best course of action now is to be evasive. If the press brings this up, make it clear you won't answer any questions. That you're gonna wait for all the facts to come in, as should they. You may be right, but I need you to find Anne. The reporters are gonna be chasing her and she's not up to this. - I'll put Perry on it. - Thank you. Hello, Anne. Thanks for coming. I just wanted to have a chance to apologise face to face for what I did. I don't know what I was thinking. Where are the letters, Ted? Right here. For God's sakes, Anne. It's not meant for you. - For whom, then? - Just take the letters and go. Ted, you're not thinking about killing yours... - No. It's for self-defence. - Don't lie to me. You got what you came for. So go. You don't need to be here for this. Ted. At least talk to someone. I know some good doctors. Phoneys who are gonna talk me out of doing what I should've done five years ago? No, thank you. I'm a failure, Anne. Everything I touch goes bad. That's just the way it is. Don't shed any tears for me, because I don't deserve it. Just go. Don't come any closer. - Let me call someone. - No! You're a great woman, Anne. Much better than I ever deserved. I'm sorry I let you down, but just get the hell outta here. I said go! Ted. - It doesn't have to be like this. - No? How can it be? Can we be 25 again? What you did was wrong, but you made it right. And that means something. That means you can start again. People do it all the time, Ted. Why not you? You're really something. If I gave you a few more minutes, you might actually be able to talk me out of doing it. Ted. - (gunshot) - No! - The president can expect updates. - (Wayne) When will you call? - Every 15 minutes. - I'll let him know. All right. We'll be in touch. (gasps) You should be in the hospital. I'm fine. What have you got? Briefing package on Las Nieves. Alternate landing sites that Chase might use instead of the airstrip. Thanks. - Is there something wrong? - I'm just worried about you, that's all. Uh-huh. What is it? - It's not the time. - Michelle. What is it? This whole thing that you've been planning with Jack. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. Jack planned it. He wanted absolute secrecy and I agreed. - You don't have to explain. - No, I want to explain. Listen to me. I trust you with my life. But this job is what it is. Jack said he came up with the plan a month ago. Is that how long you've known? Something like that. Yeah. I just... I had no idea that you were hiding something from me. But that's my problem. I just got off the phone with CTU. Bauer's near a place called Las Nieves. Delta teams are scrambling now. When does CTU expect to intercept the virus? When Bauer gives them the signal. Almeida says he'll update us every 15 minutes. - Good. - Wayne Palmer. Yeah. Yeah, hang on. David, it's Anne. She says it's important. - Hello, Anne. - David. It's Ted. He just committed suicide. Oh, Anne. I'm so sorry. Are you all right? Not really, no. I was, uh... - I was with him when he did it. - What were you doing there? He asked to see me. He said he was sorry and wanted to make things right. Did you call the police? - Yes. They're here now. - What can I do to help? There's something Ted wanted me to give you. What's that? Letters exonerating me from any connection to the falsified research data. That's why I was here in the first place, because he wanted to give them to me. - And you have these letters? - Yes, I do. I'll be in the clear, and hopefully it puts an end to the negative fallout for you as well. That's secondary to your wellbeing. I'll be OK. I'll come over as soon as I'm done here. Good. I'll see you then. OK. Is everything all right? Ted Packard just committed suicide. And he did it in front of Anne. Oh, my God, David. I'm so sorry. Listen, I don't mean to sound callous, but what was she doing with him? He wanted to give her letters which apparently prove she's innocent. - Are you serious? - She's gonna bring them over in a little while. I guess that's some sort of silver lining. Listen, David, I know I've been somewhat hard on Anne, but she cleaned up her own mess, and I respect that. Maybe she's learning what it takes to be in this game after all. - (Ram Ãn) Why do we need Bauer? - He made contact with the Ukrainians. They trust him. You trust him, too. The man who put me in prison. - And got you out again. - He has an angle. Count on it. Of course he does. 15 million dollars, it's a big angle. You saw him. He's a shell. There's nothing left. No future, no family. And a habit he can't beat. He's not the same man who fooled us before. So sure of that, huh? We have people in the American agencies. In their military, too. Every one of them confirmed the prison break was real. Bauer is a fugitive from his own country. If they hadn't wanted you alive, they would have killed him. That's a fact. So, if we go through with this, what happens afterwards? We just forget what Bauer did to us and let him walk away? Do you think I could forget what he did to us? As soon as we have the virus, we kill him. Now, that's the first thing you've said that I like. Bauer is clever, he'll expect it. - What can he do? Alone, surrounded. - Don't underestimate him. It's me who's been underestimated, Ram Ãn. But I will earn your respect, when we make more money in one day than we've made in both of our lifetimes. But you don't have all night to decide. This man Amador is waiting for Bauer's call. - Bring Bauer in. - (man over radio) Right away, Ram Ãn. What have you decided, Ram Ãn? I'm not sure yet. I don't trust you, and I never will. All I want right now is to spill your blood. But I won't. Not yet, anyway. Out of respect for my little brother, I am willing to play this out a little longer. So make your call. Amador won't be at the number he gave me for another 15 minutes. We'll wait. And you won't be sorry. - Tony. It's Rafael from Las Nieves. - Patch it over here. - (Tony) Rafael? - I'm at the landing area now. - There's no sign of any incoming craft. - What size team do you have? - What team? It's just me. - You gotta be kidding me. This is a corrupt area. Salazar's got a lot of influence. We don't know how far it goes. Miguel wanted me to do this on my own. You'll have your hands full. Chase is one of our more capable agents. All right. How do you want me to approach? Don't surprise him. Make sure he knows you're working with CTU. Hang on, I hear something. Yeah, this must be him. It's a twin-engine prop on approach. He's landing now. - You have the photo? - Yeah. Make sure it's him. Be careful. We'll keep this line open. Good. All right. I'm moving in. Be careful. He's not expecting company. Edmunds. Edmunds. I'm here to help. Edmunds. Edmunds! Edmunds. Gutierrez, talk to me. He's not here. The plane's empty. He must have spotted you. Stand by. I'll call you back. Yeah, all right. Edmunds. Edmunds. Edmunds. Wait. Wait, wait! Take it easy. - Who the hell are you? - My name is Rafael Gutierrez. Mexican lntelligence. Check my pocket, my left pocket. Get on your knees. Hands behind your head. Interlock your fingers. - How do you know my name? - Your boss sent me. Tony Almeida, CTU. His access code is 3-Tango-6-6-4. Get up. - What does he want? - He wants you to call him. I've got a phone right here. He says it's a matter of life or death about Jack Bauer. Gimme the phone. Thank you. (phone rings) Almeida. - Edmunds. - Chase... - If you're trying to get me to come back... - (gunshot) Chase! (gunshots) Chase, what's going on? Chase, can you hear me? - Tony, are you there? - What's going on? The guy you sent is dead. A sniper took him out. I'm being pursued. Chase! (Tony over radio) Chase! (Tony) Chase, can you hear me? Chase! - Doctor Packard. - I'm here to see the president. Follow me, ma'am. Come. Anne. - How are you holding up? - I'm OK. Are those the letters? This is good, David. This is very good. This clears up everything. Yes. Yes, it does. Once authenticated, we'll take 'em to the press. You'll be off the hook and Keeler should be hoisted up on it. Yeah. I thought you'd be pleased. Anne, listen. I'm sorry about Ted. I really am. And if there's anything that I can do, anything at all, please just... Iet me know. Thank you. Excuse me. Anne? I'm all right, David. I'm gonna be all right, but... something came out of this, and it was suddenly so clear to me. What was clear? I don't know how to say this, except to just say it. I think we need to end things. After what's just happened, after what's been happening all day, - I can understand why you'd want time apart. - David, it's not about time apart. - Anne, don't... - It's true, this day has been awful, but it just confirmed something that I've been feeling for a while. I can't live in your world. The things that people do to each other, the things they have to do in order to survive, I just... I can't... That's exactly why I need you. You need someone who can stand beside you. Not someone who stands back and watches, and maybe passes judgement on things she doesn't really understand. I'm sorry. You are the finest man I have ever known. And Wayne, God bless him, he's just what you need and I'm so glad you have him, but it's not for me. Goodbye, David. Anne. (ringing tone) - Hello? - Michael. Jack Bauer. Can you hear me? I can hear you, Jack. I'm glad you arrived safely. Where are you? - You know I can't tell you that. - OK. Then where do you wanna meet? I'll call you back. Give me the number you're calling from. OK. I'm on a satellite phone. One second. The number's 34221. - You'll hear from me soon. - OK. Good. - Have your money prepared. - Don't worry about that. (door opens) He came in by plane, just south of the town. He was with a federal that they killed. - I know this man. He's Bauer's partner. - (Hector) Was he with anyone else? - No, just the federal. - What are you doing here? Shut up! If he is here, others will be here soon. We gotta get outta here. Tom Às, make sure everything is ready. We're moving out of here now. - Bauer has been lying to us all along. - I had no idea he was coming. - You've been playing us for fools. - You're making a mistake. Hector, please. We can still do this deal. Don't let your brother piss away a billion dollars. - What if he's telling the truth? - You keep hearing what you want to hear. - This is an act. It's all been an act. - How do you know? Ram Ãn, I swear to you, I'm not lying. Please, let's do this deal. - (Chase) What the hell's going on, Jack? - Shut up. You shouldn't have followed me. - You're with them? - Yes, I'm with them. - You say he's not with you? - Yes, that's right. Then kill him. Kill your partner. You want me to kill him? Fine, I'll kill him. But we would be smarter to use him for information or as a hostage. No more clever talk. You keep saying you are on our side. Now prove it, once and for all. Fine. You should never have come down here, Chase. You should have listened to me. Very good, Jack. We'll take him with us. Bauer is right. Let's find out what he knows. Break him down, see if anyone came here with him. We'll go to a safe house and we'll wait for Amador's call. - Jack? - Shut up, Chase. You wanna get through this, just shut up! Dammit. I don't know how, but the transponder on Jack's watch just went dead. - Did you try to reset? - Yeah. Nothing. Dammit! By the time the assault teams are in position,
