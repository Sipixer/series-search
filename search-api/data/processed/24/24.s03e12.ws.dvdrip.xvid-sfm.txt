Even if it means destroying my presidency. You want me to find something you can use against Alan. You think you can enlist your ex-wife to manufacture lies in order to bring me down? You want it to stop, stay away from my brother. - (phone rings) - Jack, I think it's Amador. I've got the product. There's an old mine east of Posta Mita. Meet me in there in an hour and ten minutes. I'll have one man with me for security. You may do the same. (Ram Ãn) We are following through. - (Hector) There are too many risks now. - They are in the playbook. CTU, Dessler. (Jack) Ram Ãn, ifyou want this deal to happen, we've gotta go now. Tony, Jack's on the line. He's using his cell as a one-way. Amador's gonna be at Posta Mita in an hour. It's gonna take us that long to get there and get your men into position. He's disconnected. Based on what CTU got, the meeting will probably take place here. My forward position is gonna be here. I need you to put your men behind this ridge until we know that the virus is real. - How long will it take them to get there? - 90 seconds. Good luck. Ram Ãn, if you want this deal to happen, we have to leave now. We have to be there 20 minutes before Amador. The deal is off! We're leaving now. Hector! (gunshot) (gasps) - Are your people ready? - Yeah. - What about Chloe? - Yeah, she's there, too. This is our chance to get the virus. Make sure they're aware of what's at stake. - They're aware. - lt'll all come down in the next hour. - You don't have to keep reminding me. - I do. Too many things can go wrong here. We don't need another mistake. So, um... Have we had any word from Jack in the last few minutes? No. He's still with Nina and the Salazars. You should have listened to me. This is my business. I built it. And I won't let anyone destroy it. Not even you. Ram Ãn. - We gotta get him to a hospital. - We can't. They'll ask questions. - He'll die if we don't. - I know. Ram Ãn. Ram Ãn, I'm sorry, but we have to go. When we are done. I want him to have a proper burial. Ram Ãn, you're making a big mistake. He's setting you up. He works for CTU. Hector was right. You should give this up. That's enough. Don't mention my brother's name. Ever. All right. Let's do the deal. Everybody back in the cars. Come on. (Palmer) Coordinate with CTU. I want updates every half-hour. (woman) Yes, sir. - Yes? - David. I just want you to know that I'm leaving. - This leverage you have with Milliken. - It's better that you don't know the details. All right. Aaron told me that you refused a Secret Service escort. Yes. But that's because the person I'm going to see might scare if I don't come alone. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. I know you can. - David. - Mm-hm? I still believe in your presidency. And if Alan Milliken is threatening your ability to lead this country, he will be stopped. Amador will be here in 30 minutes. We have Delta teams ready to intercept the package when Jack confirms it has the virus. - Jack's transmitter working yet? - We're using Chase. He's moving into a covert position to give confirmation. - He can transmit to us and the Delta teams. - Who's running his comm? I am. I wrote a software bridge. I'm amplifying the low-frequency signal and relaying it out. OK. Good. Chase'll let us know when the transaction's complete and Jack has the virus. Our units will move in, taking full precautions to keep that virus safe. Ram Ãn, you have to get your men out of sight before Amador arrives. I know. Take Nina and send her inside. - Hombres, vengan aca. - Enseguida. (Ram Ãn) Give me the map. I want some men over here and some over there. Tell them to keep their eyes open. Ram Ãn, he's setting you up. I can prove it. Luis, espera. Really? How? I was at CTU for seven years, I know their protocols. I know how they'll play this. - I'm listening. - Their attack teams won't be close. They'll have one man doing reconnaissance. He'll be watching now. - You know where he would be? - There's some high ground. I bet he's there, or 90 degrees west at the tree line. We'll know soon enough. Felipe, Pablo, check it out. Make your approach from the sides in case the woman is right. I am right. Vamonos. - Kim, go over these format changes. - Yeah. Here, you're gonna need these files for the repagination. - What is that? - It's a baby. I can see that it's a baby. Whose is it? - Chloe's. - Chloe's? Her baby-sitter must have had an emergency... - Chloe doesn't have a baby. - She does. She doesn't. I was in the search team when Chloe got hired. I did her background checks - personal and medical histories. - And she's never had a baby? - No. It's definitely not her kid. Felipe, Pablo. Call me with your positions. - (over radio) It's Felipe. - Where are you? - At the tree line. There's no one here. - Pablo, what about you? Pablo. Pablo, can you hear me? They got to him. - Pablo. - He's dead. They're coming for you next. What's going on? What did you say to him? What did you say to him? (Pablo) Ram Ãn. It's me. I'm at the high ground. - Do you see anything? - No. There's no one here. Right. Good. Hold your position. And keep your eyes open. OK. Drop the walkie. No more lies from you. Amador will be here in 15 minutes. Confirm he has the virus, give him his money and bring the virus back to us. You'll have one of my men with you as your bodyguard. But if you try to escape, or communicate anything to Amador, he will kill you. If he misses, there are three men in the hills with sniper rifles aimed at your head. If you want to live, make sure this deal happens. - Understood. - Good. How's Angela? Adam just told me you're not the mother of this child. Who does the baby belong to? - My boyfriend, Eric. - Eric? - Binder. Eric Binder. - So why isn't he taking care of his daughter? Cos it's the first place his ex-wife would look. His ex-wife has custody of the baby. She's seeing this guy with a drinking problem, then Eric found out that he was abusing the baby. - Why doesn't the ex-wife stop the boyfriend? - She's in some kind of denial. So why doesn't he call Child Protective Services? Eric has. The social worker couldn't make it until tomorrow. He's afraid that'll be too late. - Wait. So he's kidnapping Angela? - Technically. But just for tonight. I don't care, Chloe. Kidnapping is a felony. You wanna call the police, go ahead. But if something bad happens, then that's on you. So think about that. Think about it. Chloe. Tony needs you. Chase is transmitting. - I'll be down there in a minute. - No, he needs you now. Is there a problem? - No. No problem. - Good. Let me know how much of her bottle she takes. - Mr Kelly? - Yeah. Come on in. - Drink? - Um... No. Thank you. We appreciate your help on this, Mr Kelly. "We" meaning you and the president? I am representing the president on this, yes. So... What can I tell you? You can tell me what really happened. What do you think happened? I think Alan Milliken was driving the car that hit and killed your daughter 12 years ago. I... I wouldn't know. You testified that you didn't see anything, but I think you did. And I think what you saw implicates Milliken. Three weeks after your daughter's death, an account was set up in your name at Maritime Bank and a large deposit was made. That was to keep your mouth shut, wasn't it? This is a chance for you to set everything right. Yeah. I saw Milliken driving the car that night. Got the licence plate and everything. But when I told that to the cop, he takes me aside and he says: "Your daughter's dead." "Nothing you can do about that now." "But if you keep your mouth shut, there's... there's a payoff. A big one." So I said I didn't see who killed my daughter. It was blood money and I took it. (sobs) Mr Kelly. Mr Kelly, we are gonna have a press conference. And you are gonna have a chance to tell your story to everyone. - I'm not gonna be doing this for nothing. - How much money... I don't want money. I've already made that mistake. OK, I'm sorry. Then what do you want? My son. My only living child. He's doing a prison term, life sentence. I want the president to pardon him. - What was he convicted for? - Murder. He's all I've got. You get him outta prison, and I'll tell anyone who wants to listen what really happened. I don't care what Ram Ãn thinks, I know you're still working with CTU. You don't know anything. My interests coincide with Ram Ãn's, and he knows it. You've convinced everybody, but I don't believe it. Keep shooting your mouth off, you're gonna get yourself killed. Once he gets the virus, he's gonna kill us both. (Ram Ãn outside) Get the rest of the guns outside. Uncuff her. She needs to get going. Get the briefcase. If there is trouble, kill her first. (Chase) She's got one of Salazar's bodyguards with her. Michelle, send the teams to their final marks. Everybody get set, this is it. (Chase) Myers and Salazar's men are holding 300m away. - Edmunds is still on point. - No activity. Make sure the Delta commander has his field protocol straight. Almeida. It's Kim. I need to talk to you in private. Right now? Yeah. It's about Chloe. It's important. All right. Tech One. Keep me posted. You want me to pardon this man's son, a convicted murderer. I know I'm asking a lot, David, but unless you pardon Kelly's son, he's not gonna help us. And how exactly is he supposed to help us? 12 years ago, Kelly was paid off not to come forward as a witness against Milliken. - What did he witness? - Milliken killing his daughter, while driving drunk. Then drove off. Hit and run. Kelly was the only witness. Milliken got to him before the police report was filed. - And he'll swear to this? - All you have to do is pardon his son. His name is Patrick Kelly. He's already served four years of a life sentence. I'll have to get back to you on this. Just hurry, OK? - What do you think? - You know what I think. You shouldn't be involved in this, David. Give in to Milliken. Accept my resignation. I told you. I am not Milliken's puppet and I will not let him dictate my decisions. You're gonna let your ex-wife convince you to grant a quid pro quo pardon to a murderer. She's only been back in your life for a few hours and look what's happening. I thought you'd be in favour of what she's proposing. Of you abusing the power of your office? Absolutely not, David. It is wrong. When you wanted me to pay hush money to Anne's ex-husband, that was justified? The difference is that... David, I have your best interests at heart. You know that. I'm sorry, but Sherry has her own, and she always has. Your loyalty, which I am grateful for, does not change the fact that when someone wants to get down in the mud, the only way to fight back is to get down in it with them. So you're gonna grant the pardon? I don't know what I'm gonna do. - What is it? - There's something you need to know. If this is about Chloe's baby, I don't have time. It's not her baby. Chloe does not have a baby. And, frankly, I think she's delusional. - What are you talking about? - Look, Chloe does not have a child. I confronted her. She said this was her boyfriend's baby, and that the mother of this child was letting her get abused. I spoke to Child Protective Services. They said there was no abuse claim filed. - You sure? - Positive. - Have you talked to her since you found out? - No. When I confronted her, she was losing it. Look, this is what I'm worried about - I think she's unstable. Kim. - I need you to take a step back here. - My father and Chase's lives are in her hands. - That's why we can't do anything now. - What do you mean? Chloe is our only lifeline. She's the only one capable of filtering Chase's audio streams. - If Chloe is unstable... - We don't have an alternative. We have got to keep her in place. What about the baby? Whoever her parents are, they must be going out of their minds right now. Take care of that baby until this operation is over. I do not want Chloe distracted. I'm not happy about this. Let's hope Chloe holds it together. We'll deal with the baby once we get possession of the virus. Mr Kelly? Mr Kelly? Mr Kelly? (gasps) Hold on, I hear something. It's a car approaching. Chase is reporting a car approaching. Salazar's men are sitting tight. No sign of Amador's men and no other vehicles. Chase. I've got a visual. Two men inside. It's Amador and his bodyguard. Ram Ãn. Amador's arriving. (Chase) They're exiting the car. Amador's got a case in his hand. - Where's Delta? - 90 seconds away. No one makes a move until we're sure it's the virus. Understood? Understood. - Do you have it? - Yes. Good. The transfer protocol is in place with the bank? I'll transfer the funds once I've verified the virus. So let's see it. It looks like he's gonna give her the virus now. (Chase) He's taking a canister from the case. He's unscrewing the lid. It should take about five minutes to confirm it's the virus. We don't have enough audio filters. - The library on  Átude three, should I use it? - Yeah. - Mr Palmer, this is Tony Almeida. - Give me an update. The exchange of the virus hasn't happened yet. We expect it at any moment. The Pentagon is furious at having to play catch-up. I don't blame them. This operation began as a secret between three CTU agents, and, I reiterate, when this is over, the president will hold you accountable. I understand. But if you're reprimanding me, you're doing us both a disservice. - I need to focus on this operation. - This operation, how large is it? We have six Delta teams, waiting for the signal to go in. - Will that be sufficient? - It has to be. Any more bodies down there, we risk being spotted. - Tell me what's gonna happen. - We don't have time for this. You've asked the president to support you on this and he has. You put him way out on a limb here. He wants to know what the plan is. Michael Amador, the seller, will hand the virus over to Nina Myers. He doesn't know that Myers is now under our control. After the exchange, Delta teams move in, secure the virus, take Nina Myers, Michael Amador and Ram Ãn Salazar into custody. A lot of things are gonna have to go perfectly. That's true. But we're pretty sure we have our bases covered. Pretty sure isn't good enough. You make this happen. Yes, sir. How much longer? Chase is watching. Myers is still testing to confirm that it is the Cordilla virus. Tell me when he sees movement. - I know to do that, Tony. - Then do it. - I put an extra filter in your volume. - I don't need it. - You asked for it. - I found a plug-in that worked. - Why not tell me instead of wasting my time? - Leave me alone, Adam. Tony. Yeah. - Some things about Chloe concern me. - I know about the baby. Are we right to let her run point on this? If we make any mistakes, we could lose the virus. Adam, channel two is floating. Use a phase loop to lock it down. OK. Just do what she says. - What's the matter? - They changed the access code to Division. Yeah. Here. There. Thanks. (Chloe) OK, we're on. (Chase) The testing device is finishing. - What's going on? - They're about to get confirmation. (beeping) The signatures match. - It's the virus. It is the virus. - Send Delta in. Delta teams, green light. Go! I'll take that. Until the funds are in place. - (woman) Transfers. - Fund transfer locater 65-1911374. Waiting to confirm. Your bank is on the phone to confirm the transfer of the funds. - Yes? - 65-1911374 verified. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Our business is done. Good luck. Amador is out of the building. He's left the case containing the virus with Nina. They're in the car. Turning around, heading north. - Have a Delta unit pick him up. - OK. (Chase) Nina's on her way. She's carrying the... - What did he say? - He thinks Nina's leaving with the virus. (static) - What is wrong? - The channel's modulating. - I know. I'm switching to Sat 9. - What? In the middle of a meet? - What's going on here? - lt'll be fine in a second. - Switch it back to Sat 3. - No. - Are you crazy? - Sat 3 is out of range. It had a glitch in its software. I had to switch it or we would have lost it. Chase, do you copy? Chase, do you copy? - We should be getting a clear signal now. - Chase, do you copy? (static) Chase, do you copy? Yeah, I copy. Nina's still in visual range and she's headed towards the building. Delta's 50 seconds away. Let's go. Good job. Ram Ãn, we should go. No, Jack. I don't need you any more. He's gonna kill him. Delta teams won't get there. - We had a deal. - My brother died because of you. (gunshot) Chase. (gunshots) Chase! - Chase, come in. - Delta's here. I'm moving in. Ram Ãn! Salazar's on the move with the virus. Repeat, he has the virus. He's headed west between the buildings. Jack is in pursuit. You two, you're with me. All men in pursuit. Repeat, Salazar has the virus. (phone rings) - Hello. - Hello, Julia. It's Sherry Palmer. I'm sorry to call so late. Are you alone? Yes. It is very late, Sherry. Why are you calling? I know what your husband is doing to David. - I can't do anything about that. - That's not true. You don't see any reason to do anything, but I'm gonna give you a reason. - What are you talking about? - I know your situation, Julia. Alan is too controlling to let you go. You're not willing to sacrifice everything to get out. You're making assumptions. I'm hanging up. No. I'm telling the truth and you know it. But I can help you, Julia. I can help you get away from Alan without giving everything up. - This is ridiculous. - You know me, Julia. When I say I can make something happen, you better believe I can. - How would you do this? - We need to meet in person. - When? - It has to be now. I can't leave at this time without Alan wondering what I'm doing. Then I'm coming to you. - (twig snaps) - (Chase) Jack, hold your fire. - Chase? - Yeah. - You're all right. - Yeah, I'm all right. Our first priority is the virus. Ram Ãn is our second. Anybody gets a visual, do not fire. Copy. I lost him down the path. If I were him, I'd head north. Headed north, he'll run into the river. Give the chopper our coordinates. Send a team down the path in case he doubles back. Four of you down that path. I want two of you with me. Ram Ãn is in possession of the virus. He's headed north of position 453.6. (man over radio) Roger. 453.6. (man over radio) This is Air One. We have visual confirmed. (groaning) (Jack) It's over, Ram Ãn. There's nowhere else for you to go. - I'm not going back to jail. - Put the cylinder down and we'll talk about it. Stop, Jack. There's nothing to talk about. (groans) Put the cylinder down! I don't want to have to shoot you. Just put the cylinder down. - Jack, say the word. - Not now. Ram Ãn, I have the authority to cut a deal. All we want is the virus. Just put the cylinder down slowly. Please. I don't want to shoot you. There you go. Just put it on the ground nice and easy. Good. (cylinder makes whistling sound) - Chase, are you all right? - Yeah. Gimme your phone. - (woman) CTU. - Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida now. - (Tony) What's going on, Jack? - We do not have the virus. The cylinder was rigged with a bomb. Amador must have switched it. - Do we have a position on him? - Delta's on him. It must have been Amador's plan, which means he has an escape route. - Advise Delta team. - We're on him. Tony, Nina Myers is out there too. - Any chance she was involved? - No. The bomb was for her. Delta has Amador pinned. They're 2km west of you, Jack. Copy that. We're moving. Chase, get your team ready. Two clicks to the west. Split the road. Copy, Delta Three. Get out of the vehicle now! Hands in the air. Move a muscle, you're dead. Very slowly, get on the ground. Do it now! Go. Tony, the Delta unit's been taken out. Amador's escaped. Amador's cellphone signal just went completely dead. Jack. - Jack, come in. - Yeah, this is Bauer. Amador ambushed Delta Three. - It was a setup. - Do you have a position? We were tracking him by his cellphone signal. We lost it in the ambush. Satellite? No. There's no visual satellite coverage of this area. Son of a bitch. Copy that. Delta Three's been taken out. They don't have Amador's position. - What do you wanna do? - We gotta find Nina. Take a team up to the high ground. I'll cover down here.
