week, nine per cent of LA will be infected. That's over a million people. (distorted) We want the release of Ram Ãn Salazar. If you refuse to comply, the virus will be unleashed. You know Salazar better than anybody else here. Who are we dealing with? (Jack) His brother. Hector was next in command. He went underground when Ram Ãn was taken into custody. Have you made the call to the FBl? Y es, I did. - What about our boy? - I'm watching him now. What are you into here, man? Selling dope? This guy paid me five grand to bring some coke over the border. I did that last night. Today I drop it off, I get another five. When did the FBl get this call? - About 20 minutes ago. - We don't know who we're dealing with? - It was a scrambled voice on an open line. - Do we cancel the debate? They are discussing whether or not we should stay in Los Angeles. Chase, no day is a good day. We said that we would tell him if we were still together after two months. It's almost three. Why don't we just get it over with? Listen, Jack. You were under with Salazar for six months. I know what they did to you. You look like hell. I'm concerned about you, Jack. The things you did to get me here, I wouldn't wish on anyone. The president won't make any decisions until he knows what we're dealing with, so give me all the parameters, Tony. What we have here is a terrorist demand. Someone close to Salazar, we're guessing his brother, is demanding his release. If we don't comply, he'll initiate an outbreak of a very deadly, fast-acting virus. How do we know they're in possession of it? Wayne, I've got Dr Sunny Macer on the line. She's technical director of National Health Services. Mr Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body was anonymously delivered to our office. It was infected with a type lll pneumonic virus, deliberately introduced. This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure and there is no known antidote or vaccine. What's particularly disturbing is how fast it spreads. Take a look. It's latent for several hours but once it presents, it consumes the host rapidly. We will send you preliminary projections of casualties in case something's unleashed. And, Wayne, I gotta tell you, it's pretty bleak. I don't understand this. I thought we knew what biological threats were out there. How do we find ourselves up against the wall with something that isn 't even on our radar? This is a strain we 've never seen. The autopsy confirms someone has engineered this virus to kill ten times faster than its ordinary genotypes. OK. OK, I see. Sir, I can 't underscore enough how potentially devastating it would be if this virus were released by terrorists. What options will the president be looking at? It's the unwavering policy of the US to stand firm against any terrorist demands. I know the president, Tony. He will not free Salazar. No matter what the threat. We can't waste any time on standard protocol today. We've been given five hours to comply. If we're gonna stop this threat, then CTU has to have every possible resource at its disposal. - You'll have it. - I'd like to get my team back to work. - Understood. - Thank you. - Bauer. - Dad, it's me. - What, Kim? - Adam and I just found something on Goss. We should have an address for you pretty soon. OK. Good work. - And, Dad, remember I wanted to talk to you. - Why? Is something wrong? No, I was just wondering ifl could come up for a few minutes. It's something personal. Sweetheart, now's not a good time. As soon as I've got a moment, I'll come down, OK? Yeah. Thanks. They're getting close to Goss. You didn't shoot up, did you? You think you can hide it from me? I'm not trying to hide it from you. I'm trying to quit. People don't just quit, Jack. I've been tapering off. OK? Now it's time to stop. Doesn't look like it's time. Today is not a good day for you to be needing a fix. Why don't you go work with Chloe and pin down a location on Hector Salazar? What's wrong with the methadone programme? It takes a little time, but it works. I am not going on record with this addiction, do you understand me? You're the only person who knows, and it's gonna stay that way. This is nothing to be ashamed of. You did this in the line of duty. Doing junk was the only way to get close to Salazar. I know what I did. This conversation's over. Just get back to work. Yeah. - Chase. - What? I was playing back the Health Services briefing. - What about it? - The government can't let this happen. Salazar's just one person, no matter how bad. Forget that. We need to operate under our orders and find the carrier of this virus. Find the carrier? In the next four hours? Come on, Chase, that's not likely, is it? Not if we sit and debate it. Weren't you meant to find a list of the Goss associates? Kim's bringing it up now. Great. Then go over the autopsy report. See if there's anything they overlooked. Fine. Here are the files on Goss. I heard you talking to your dad when I was in his office. - Why do you wanna tell him today? - Cos it's not a big deal. It is a big deal. Not only do I work for him, but I'm also a field agent. - It's the last thing he wants for you. - How do you know? I know. OK? I mean, he talks about things. About how he was never there for you. Or your mom. He doesn't believe a field agent can have a relationship. Did you ever stop to think that maybe it would make him happy? That his daughter's found someone she loves? Look, I love you too. I just don't think today's a good day. Chase, I need you to copy me on that list. - What's this column keyed off at? - That's family and that's legal. - Great. - OK. (Jack) I want you to cross-reference those files with our Latin American files. Yes, I want all the names printed out. OK, just get that intel over to my office. Thanks. (knocks) - Hey, Dad. - Hey, sweetheart. - You all right? - Yeah. Why? What's going on? Chase said you were really stressed out. - Stressed? What do you mean, "stressed"? - You know. Salazar and the terrorist threat. Yeah. Yeah, but I think we're gonna get it under control. We just got a lot of work to do. - Listen, can I talk to you now? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on in. Take a seat. Hey. What's going on? After all we've been through, I find it very difficult to keep things from you. OK. What's up? Chase and I have been going out for a while. And it's starting to get serious. Wow. I think he wanted to be the one to tell you but he was worried it would cause a problem. I see. How long have the two of you been seeing each other? Three months. I really care for him, Dad. So what do you think? I don't know what I think. I'm really surprised. I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted with everything going on... I know, but... - Forget it. I just had to let you know. - No, I'm glad you told me. I am. OK. - I love you. - Love you too. Told him. What did he say? Nothing. (phone rings) - Dessler. - It's Sunny. I have something that might help. We found something odd in Goss's system. We found an unmetabolised virus particle. I'll skip the technobabble. It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form. Maybe what you're looking for is a white powder. - So it would look like cocaine? Or heroin? - Yeah, that may even be the strategy. Someone thinks they're selling coke, but they're handling the virus. Look, Kyle. I'm not gonna do it. OK? I don't care how much you pay me, it's dealing drugs. You're my best friend. You gotta come through for me here. You should have talked to me before you went to Mexico and bought the coke. I only want you to wait in the car. I'll make the delivery. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna go with you. Fine. (phone rings) - Yeah. - It's Zach. - Zach, hey. What's up? - We need to talk. Hold on a second, man. - Who's Zach? - It's nobody. What's with you today? Everything's a secret. He's got family stuff going on. What's going on? - You tell me. You got the powder? - Yeah, of course I do. - What time you want me to drop it off? - Tonight. Come by around 7.30. 7.30, yeah. Can we just go over one more time how this whole thing's gonna go down? Go over what? You drop off the coke, I give you the money. Is that too much for you? No! No, no, that's totally cool, man. It better be. (phone rings) - Yeah. - It's Michelle. We got an address on David Goss, the infected body that was left at Health Services. - How recent? - Two months. OK, have LAPD send over a perimeter team. Tell 'em hands off until Chase and I get there. Got it. Chase! Let's go. We're on. - Get an address? - Yeah. Make sure they don't go in until Jack gets there. Hey. - Peter just told me you got an address. - Yeah. - I'm bringing it over now. - There's nothing more recent? We could look for another hour and not find anything better. We don't have an hour to waste, do we? Put transmitters on Jack and Chase. I wanna analyse their interactions so we can work it up in real time. OK. - Jack. - What have you got? Here's the address where Goss was arrested for dealing. - How recent? - Two months ago. It's all in the file. Good. Medical kit. Health Services had us put it together. Thanks, baby. Be careful. Let's go, Chase! We'll have to wait till we get there to see the setup. LAPD is locking it down now. I know Kim told you about us. I was gonna tell you, I just couldn't find the right time. We thought you should know. It's getting serious. That's what she said. - And what did CTU have to say? - That it could be a very dangerous situation. Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could happen if this virus is released. It's not good. Give CTU carte blanche. Whatever they need, make sure they get it. - I did. - We should cancel the debate. - What? - It's a mistake to continue prepping - while there's an imminent bioterrorist threat. - We don't know that it's imminent, David. And you know just as well as I do that we get threats every day. Not like this one. They said the body was infected with a weaponised virus. OK, let's say you're right. What do you really think you could do if you put your full attention on it? I want to make sure you're not advising me out of fear my image will suffer if we cancel. Oh, no, it will suffer. But I still think the best thing to do is to proceed as planned and respond when we have more information. (car door) Keeler's here. - Come on. Let's go in this way. - Don't worry, Wayne. - John. - Mr President. - You didn't have to come to welcome me. - It's no trouble. (Keeler) I spoke with your friend Jacob Weiss yesterday. - (Palmer) You stopped in South Dakota? - Just for dinner. - How's he feeling? - Better. He's playing a few rounds of golf. That's him. Well, I don't want to keep you, John. You have last-minute cramming to do if you want to survive this debate. I won't argue with you there. Your research staff outnumbers mine three to one. I have to do some of the shoe leather myself. Touch Á. - I'll see you inside, sir. - You certainly will. - (Wayne) No one, I mean no one, hears... - (Palmer) Wayne. We're ready. I'll give you a call, all right? What were you talking to him about? I think we may have an opportunity. What kind of opportunity? Not now. After. I'm sorry if you think I'm not good enough for your daughter. But I can't help the way I feel. Chase, why do you think I put Kim at CTU? Behind a desk, working at a computer? So I can keep an eye on her. Make sure she's safe. Not so she can date some field agent. Safe? You're talking about her like she's 12. She's a grown woman. Dammit, you've seen what this job can do to you. - It's ruined every relationship I've ever had. - That's you, Jack. No! No! - It's the job. - I don't think so. You don't think so. What the hell do you know? My wife died because of this job. And I almost lost Kim, too. I'm not gonna let that happen again. I will do everything I have to to protect her, do you understand me? Everything. Dammit, Chase. You cannot have a normal life and do this job at the same time. You're saying I shouldn't have a relationship with anyone? That's exactly what I'm saying. And especially with my daughter. (phone rings) This is Bauer. - Jack, it's Luis. - What's up? I tried to move Salazar to solitary. There was a lock on it from Division. What's that about? - I can't tell you right now. - He murdered his attorney right in front of us. What the hell is Division doing protecting him? - They're not protecting him. - Then what? - I can't get into it right now. - Can't go into it? You're not the only one who gave up his life to put this guy away. I need to be in the loop, Jack. Jack? This doesn't go anywhere after you hang up the phone. What? - Salazar might walk. - Walk? What're you talking about? I don't think it's gonna get to that. Someone on the outside's got a lot of leverage. Who? I think it's his brother Hector. - I don't believe this. - Just hang tight. - I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Yeah, all right. You better start thinking about what we're going to do when we get there. - We'll talk about this later. - Fine. Open the door. Let's go. - Open 12. - (man over radio) Opening 12. Step forward. Let's go. Luis,  ïya has encontrado nuevo abogado? No, I haven't found you a new lawyer. - How about an execution date? - Someone's not happy. - What do you know, Ram Ãn? - About? (coughs) - Talk to me. - Talk to you about what? What is your brother trying to do? Hector? Have you heard from him? How is he? His birthday's coming up next week. I don't even know what to get him. You keep talking trash, man, you're not going anywhere. Maybe not. But let me assure you of one thing. If something does happen, and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free, I have no doubt that you'll come looking for me. Especially after the death of your wife Elyse. And your two boys. What are their names? Tom Às and Luis Jr? - There's no follow-up call from the terrorists? - No. So there's nothing to report to the president? Not till I hear from Bauer. He's following up on the Goss lead right now. All right, Tony. Thanks. So, if you'll excuse me, until this evening's debate. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for all of your questions. - That went well. - Yes, it did. - So what's the latest? - Nothing yet. CTU's trying to figure out who dropped off the dead body. We still don't know who's behind this? They're still speculating that it's Salazar's brother. What they don't know is if it's a bluff staged to release Salazar. How can it be a bluff? The virus has been confirmed. Yes, but dropping off a dead body is one thing. Being able to infect an entire city, that's something different. All right. I guess we'll know soon enough. OK. Hey, Wayne. - You spoke earlier about an opportunity. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm not really sure that's something we need to discuss right now. Which means whatever it is fell through. Or I won't like it, so you're proceeding without me. No, that's not it. I just think that, because of this threat, I don't want to divert your attention. I can walk and chew gum at the same time. What is it? Keeler's playbook. What if I can get us a copy? - What exactly do you mean by playbook? - His entire prep for tonight's debate. How he's gonna answer the questions, what issues he's gonna try and trip you up on. Everything. - And how would we get it? - You don't need to know the details. - I'm surprised. - About what? The question. You know there's no way on earth that I would ever agree to this. David, I'm not... I am not talking about pulling a Sherry and stealing it. It may just drop in our laps and, if it does, why shouldn't we look at it? Wayne. You are not in the private sector any more. You have to get used to how my administration works. I am just trying to give your administration four more years. OK. OK, if that's how you want it. That's how I want it. (woman) All right, we're just about to start. Can you all please take your seats here? - Kim. Are you all caught up? - Pretty much. I just have to refresh the data on my dad's panel. Great. Can I ask you a question about you and Tony? Me and Tony what? I don't know, I was just wondering. Is it... a problem? Working with your husband in the same office? No. No, it's not a problem. Why do you ask? - It's not a big deal. - No, it's OK, we have a minute. Well, l, um... been dating Chase and I don't think my dad's too happy about it. I see. Well, um... I'm sure your dad's just trying to protect you. But, ultimately, it's just between you and Chase. Yeah, I know. - Let me know when you finish those panels. - Sure. Hey. Analysis just called. If Hector Salazar's orchestrated this biothreat, he's probably operating out of Northern Mexico. We need a list of his properties. Chloe's going through the files Jack turned in after the bust. All right. I'll talk to her. Fire up all our contacts there in case Hector has shown his face in the last couple of days. OK. - Is the boy still in place? - Yeah. And the president's been informed? Yeah, and he's not cancelling the debate. He's got some cojones, I'll give him that. Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when there's a couple of million lives on the line. S Ãlo quiero lo mejor para ti y no quiero preocuparme. Papa, no tengo miedo. S Á lo que estoy haciendo. No sabes, hija. Soy suficiente grande para hacer mis propias decisiones. Claudia! - What's going on? - Nothing. Everything's fine. Don't tell me nothing. - Why you argue with your father? - Please, Hector. It doesn't matter. He's not happy with how I live my life. He doesn't like you being with me? -  ßOriol! - Si, se Íor. (in Spanish) Don't raise your voice to your father ever again. Claudia, no! How I conduct myself with my father is my concern. Not yours. Good. Now that's settled. Tell Luc Âa to prepare supper. OK? We eat early tonight. OK, I'll tell him. (phone rings) - Almeida. - I just got off the phone with Jack. - Theyjust arrived. - Is there a problem? - Jack won't use the transmitters. - Why not? He says it would take too long to wire them up. Whatever. Look, any information he digs up, I want it right away. You got it? OK. You don't have to yell. No one's yelling, Chloe. We got a body infected with a deadly virus. We have to tie it to Salazar in the next three hours. Right now, Jack's location is our only lead. So I need you to keep me up to the minute. - Understood? - I said OK. Good. Then get on it. - Detective Fisher? - Yeah. You Bauer? This is my partner Chase Edmunds. What's the activity? - No one's gone in or out since we got here. - What's the layout? Probably 30 people. Spread out on all floors. The apartment you asked us to case is the corner one, third floor. - You didn't go in? - Orders were to wait till you got here. - Good. - How much backup you want? - None. I want your men to cover the exits. - There's 30 scumbags in there. We don't want to set off any alarms. We can sneak in without a fight. - Sure about that? - (Jack) Yeah. Keep this on channel one. We'll tell you when we want you to come in. - Let's go. - You got it. ( "3000 Miles" by Hawaii) - This area's not open to the public. - Take it easy, sport. - We just want a little information. - Beat it. - Zach, cops! - Go, Chase! Get back! Cover me. (Jack) Reloading! Chase, we got a runner! - Don't even think about it! - I'm clean! You've got nothing on me! Shut up, stupid. You just fired at a federal agent. You better start talking to me. Or I will let you bleed to death here. - Chase! I got him. We're down here. - Fisher, we're good. We got our suspect. - Who is David Goss? - He's a dealer. I score from him sometimes. - Not any more. He's dead. - OK. He's dead. Don't be a smartass. Who was his supplier? Who was his supplier? Chase. A guy named Carlos Corretja. He works outta Tijuana. Corretja was one of Salazar's mid-level distributors. - You doing business with him? - I'm calling him tonight. Corretja wanted me to find a mule. Someone clean, without a record. - What for? - To move a bag of coke across the border. - It didn't make any sense to me. - Why not? He paid ten grand to bring it up. - Coke isn't even worth that much. - Where's the bag of coke now? The guy who brought it across still has it. - What's his name? - His name is Kyle. Kyle Singer. (man, indistinct) Sorry, Helen... - What is... what is this? - It's the final notice. If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow, 8am, I'm calling City Services and they start the eviction process. (Helen) Don, don't do this. Please. I'm gonna have it in a couple of days. (Don) I can't carry you... ( "Suddenly" by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) I'll be back. - Kyle. - How much do you owe him, Ma? - Stay out of this. - How much? $1800. And don't you worry about it, because your father is gonna talk to Uncle Sandford. Hey, 1800, right? Here. From now on if you have a problem, talk to me or my dad. OK? Leave my mom out of it. I expect a receipt in the mailbox. - Where did you get that money? - It doesn't matter. We needed it, I got it. Can I have everybody's attention, please? Everyone should work up the name Kyle Singer. I want point sheets from department heads on my desk in five minutes. Everything about Kyle Singer, I want it. Where he lives, works and, most importantly, where he's likely to be now. Keep an open channel to Field Ops so Chloe can forward anything that comes in to Jack. Let's go. - What are you doing? - Narrowing the search space. I can't believe you're this stupid, Kyle. This is how you're gonna help your family? By dealing drugs? I'm not dealing 'em. It's a stupid delivery. It's quick money which my folks need right now. Where are they gonna get the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle? You're right. It was stupid. I know that. But I did it. I'm in this now. I'm in the middle of this. Look, I'm gonna make this delivery tonight, all right? And I promise it's gonna be over. I promise you. I'm not waiting until tonight. It's over now. What you talkin' about? I can't be with someone who does stuff like this. I'm sorry, Kyle. Hold on. Linda! - Come on, Linda, please! - It's over, Kyle. Are you gonna tell me what's going on? - Look... we just had a disagreement. - Where did you get the money to pay Don? - Mom, forget about it, please. - What's your dad gonna say? He's not gonna take "forget about it" as an answer. I don't know. (door slams) - Would you excuse us, please? - David. - Sorry, Anne. Our schedule's been way off. - I thought you couldn't join me. I can't. I only have a couple of minutes. I'm having your security level upgraded. - I'm gonna need your advice today. - What's going on? What do you know about type lll pneumonic viruses? Not a lot, they're fairly new. As far as I know, there are several strains. Most of them are fast-acting and all are deadly. - Someone's threatening to release a virus. - Oh, God. I need you to talk to a Dr Sunny Macer at National Health Services. Yeah, I know Sunny. But, David, if you think there's a remote possibility that this thing is for real, you need to get outta Los Angeles. That's not possible. The debate is in little over two hours. You're talking about an outbreak here in the city. This isn't something the Secret Service can protect you against. I know. I know. And we are prepared to leave if the situation warrants it. But right now, I need you to talk to Dr Macer and learn everything you can about this thing. - I will. - It's OK. It's all right. (knock at door) Yes. - Your brother would like to see you, sir. - Send him in. He's downstairs. He requests that you come see him. - Come see him? - Yes, sir. He has something to show you. You go ahead. I'm gonna call Sunny. See you later. (Jack) No, I'm gonna check that out myself. Chase is bringing the suspect into CTU. I want you to set up a white room for him now. - Take Parker to CTU. - What about Singer? I'll take care of Singer. You take care of Parker. Anybody can take him to CTU. I'm going with you. - No, you're not. - Why are you trying to get rid of me? I'm not. I think Parker's got more information. I want you to get it out of him. Is it about Kim? Are you punishing me for dating your daughter? If that kid's got a bag of cocaine that's got the virus in it and he doesn't know it, - I need to stop him putting it into circulation. - I know. That's why I wanna help you. - You can't. It's too dangerous. - Too dangerous? You can't have it both ways, Chase. My daughter loves you. You wanna be with her, I have to stop putting you in danger. You're kidding, right? Take Parker to CTU. That's an order. - Yeah. Call you right back. - (man) All right. Same number. Excuse us for a minute. What is it, Wayne? Don't be angry, but I got a copy of Keeler's playbook. - I told you to drop that. - Will you listen to me? If you don't want to use it, then don't. But there is something you need to see. There's nothing I need to see. It's about Anne. Keeler's too smart to play the race card orthe girlfriend card. It's neither one of those, which is why I'm bringing this to you. It's something that we didn't know about her. Something that, if true, could... David, it could damage all of us. Just take a look at it. (phone rings) Yeah. Give me an update. - Kyle's still in his house. - What about the package? - It's with him. - And Ram Ãn? - Just waiting to come home. - Good. - Gael. Chloe's been looking for you. - Where is she? - She's in lT.
