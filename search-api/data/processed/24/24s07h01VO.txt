We got to the most of the boys had gone I need soldiers not I'll bring some more sir  i promise Just give it to me You will learn to fight like a man For that i have no doubts This Would make you strong little soldiers This would make you free Gore Take it Ah... how is it make you feel Powerful yes? Gore Your mothers and your fathers They have made you weak But general juma... He will make you strong. He will make you strong So that you can take back the country from the government And the traitors that work for them... Like this cockroach here! This cockroach Who works for the government And their white masters... yes, yes. Have mercy on me. They have taken our land. But soon, all that will change. Soon, all the land will belong To the people again. Soldier... ...you must buy our freedom With the blood of this cockroach. Please, no. And you know what we do to cockroaches. Kill the cockroach. Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! I thought i told you To turn up the air-Conditioning. All right, sir, i do, sir. But we need another player. Find somebody else. Who? Tell me, willie, Who can handle the ball better than you? That's right, no one. We're not supposed to go to town without mr. Benton. Mr. Benton worries too much. And so do you. Hey, desmond. Hurry or the bus will leave-- Come on. Let's go. -You're not my father. -I'm your brother, And you'll do what i say. No! Fine, then. The truck is here! The truck is here! I wasn't stealing it. I swear. I was just looking. Forgot these. Very pretty. For a woman, yes? I was gonna give it to my daughter one day. You have a daughter? Yeah. Where did you get it? Rajasthan. India. You ask a lot of questions. That's what mr. Benton says. I bet. When were you there? Last summer. Before you came here? Yes. And before that, where were you? Different places. When are you going home? I'm not going home. Look, i told the boys i'd help them unload the truck. If you want that, You can have it. Really? Really. Willie. You're gonna have to give me back my knife though. On. Hey, willie. The supply truck's here. Want to give them some help? Look what jack gave me. -Very nice. -It's from india. Willie, go on. Jack, this is frank tramell. He's the ambassador's chief political officer. I know who he is. He says he left some messages for you -To come see him at the embassy. -I got his messages. What's going on, jack? I'll tell you what's going on. A senate subcommittee has questions About the illegal detention And torture of certain prisoners I have a subpoena requesting you To appear, and it's way past due, So consider yourself served. I told the boys i'd help them Unload the truck-- Excuse me. Failure to comply to a subpoena Is a federal offense, mr. Bauer. You are bound by law to respond. Then give them my response. If they want me back in washington, They can come and get me. The, uh, ambassadador said That you and bauer Were in special forces together. How long has he been here? A few months. He never mentioned a subpoena? Nope. Well, he's been ducking it for more than a year, Across three different continents. Washington is leaning on the ambassador To deliver him. And now, the ambassador's leaning on you. If bauer doesn't come back to the states On his own, they'll come for him. That would be a mistake. You're doing god's work here, carl. Between malaria and the wars, These kids neverad a chance. Now you're giving them a decent life. It'd be a shame If the funding dried up. Don't threaten me, frank. I'm just giving you the facts. You're his friend. Talk some damn sense into him. Thank you, thomas. There he is, The mighty warrior Who traded his gun For a wheelbarrow. Why are you here, hmm? To do penance for all your sins? You don't want to talk about it. I don't blame you. Hey, careful, don't drop her. The government won't be able To hold out against us for long. Except we have more weapons than soldiers who can use them. We need to overrun the main garrison From the west. We have minefields here and here. Then i'll bring you more little soldiers To clear them-- Do not worry. Our father would be really proud, youssou. Very proud. You'll have your little soldiers. Go. This is colonel dubaku. Hodges here. I just heard some troubling news, colonel, That your recruiting numbers are, Are still coming up a little short. I want you to know, My offer stands. I've got personnel standing by Right across the border. They can be deployed within the hour. That won't be necessary. Do some thinking now, colonel. I'm offering you Professional soldiers, Not children that you haven't had time to train. You provided the weapons. We will fight our own war. Well, it's your country. It will be soon. Is there anything else, mr. Hodges? Yeah, tell general juma To give me a call When he gets there, will you? I'll let him know. Good. That's one hard-Nosed son of a bitch. It is his country. But i'm paying for it. I don't want those transactions traceable, Mr. Nichols. Not by the sec, the irs, or any of my ex-Wives. You understand me, don't you? John, what do you want me to tell you? You've got to hang in there and be patient, my friend. Yes, i know, i know-- Hold on, hold on. Stop, stop, we got caught by the margin. It's going to turn around. Yes, yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, you've got to give it time And just... yeah, be patient. Yeah. Okay. Yes, yes. Okay, all right. Bye-Bye. Chris. Yeah? Would you come in here please? Who's that guy? A client. I need you to close out Abu dhabi and eritrea. Burn the records and bury the ashes. Go. Jack? Can i have a word? Yeah. Willie, go on out to the truck. Pick up another load. I think you should take a look at this. I don't need to. I know what it says. Don't worry, carl. I'll be gone by dark. I'm not asking you to leave, jack. I'm asking you to have a conversation. Tramell says this subpoena's been chasing you For over a year now. It's going to catch up with you sometime. I'm not going back. I'm not saying you should. But a year's a long time To spend looking over your shoulder. A lifetime of that's Going to drive you out of your mind. Whatever 've done, i've paid for in full. All i've got left is my freedom. I'm not letting them take that away from me. "Freedom." What kind of freedom is this, jack? You're running away. What do you want from me, carl? I want you to trust me, jack. I am your friend. I'm sorry. When you called me up For the first time in what, ten years, i hoped... You were maybe looking for something more Than just a place to stay... Trying to find a way to make some sense of it all. It's a normal impulse. Especially for people like us. Ah, except you found what you were looking for. Yeah. Carl? Carl! I just meant it's different for me. You know, i'm not sure i have found what i was looking for But i have found a way to live with myself. It took a long time. The first thing i had to do Was stop running. I meant what i said, jack. You can stay here. Don't worry about trammell. The state department's not The only place with money. I appreciate what you're trying to do, carl, But this is my problem. I'm not gonna let it become yours. What you've done with this place... The school, what you've done for the boys Is worth protecting. You and i both know It will be better for everyone if i leave. I'm sorry, jack. Me, too. Me, too. Thank you, carl. Always. Yeah. You're spreading rumors. You'll start a panic over nothing. They're not rumors. It's the truth. You are just a boy. You do not know what you are talking about. Juma is killing our children. The united nations has no evidence of that. What do you know? This isn't even your country, huh? What's going on? Thomas is talking nonsense. He's spreading rumors about juma. "Rumors"? They are not rumors. Juma's soldiers have been crossing The border and stealing our chdren. Juma has no soldiers, And he has no weapons. Everyone knows that. My cousin is missing. He went to the market yesterday And he has not returned. Then it was gun-Runners who took him. Or someone from the diamond mines. My brother is in town with james. You see that, hmm? Now you have the boy all worried. He should be worried. We should all be worried.  Stop it! Both of you. Keep sharp work, i'll go to town and see what's going on Fine. But you are wasting your time. I thought i told you kids not to go into town Without telling me. Desmond never listens to anyone but desmond. Where'd he go? Playing football. There's a field, just past the bridge. I'll be back soon  benton! You're not seriously Worried about all of this, are you? If juma was making trouble, We would have heard something, no? Probably. But this is sangala. I'm not taking any chances. What'd you think that was, huh? Nothing. What'd you say "nothing"? Nothing. What'd you say "nothing," huh? He's so powerful, guys. Oh, you just threw the ball away... wow! You wanna fight, do you wanna fight! Go to fetch the football, go fetch it, fetch it Run! You are now soldiers in the people's freedom army. You will all have the honor of fighting the imperialists Until we have taken back our land. Samuel tells me you are from the american school In okavango. These americans make our people slaves. But we will free you. And we will free the other children So they can become soldiers. Take them. Tell me your name. Sive. Louder. Sive. Are you a baby, sive? I asked you a question. Are you a baby? No. Good. Because we need soldiers, sive, Not babies who wet themselves. Now stop crying, or i will stop you myself. Commander! Put them in the truck! Go. Go! What are you doing?! Idiot! They are no good to us dead! Go! With the inauguration less than two hours away, President daniels is scheduled to meet with his successor Here at the white house to review final details For the transfer of power. Their respective transition teams have been working Together for several weeks to ensure a smooth turnover Stop looking at me like that. Shouldn't you be getting dressed? We've got time. Stop. Hello. Uh, i need to talk to you, rog. Chris? Yeah Uh, i think i might be in trouble. Okay. Are you using again? That's not what this is about. You didn't answer my question. I can't, uh... I can't really talk on the phone, okay? I was hoping that i could... I could meet up with you face-To-Face. Now? Hang on a sec, rog. Chris? I know, i know, i know, i know, it's terrible timing. Believe me, i know. But i wouldn't be asking if it wasn't really important. I got to leave in 45 minutes, man. I can be there in 20. Chris... I am not gonna stay long. I swear, rog. Just please. Do this for me? Fine, but i'm out of here in 45 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. You're letting chris come here right now? He's having some kind of relapser something. What am i supposed to do? Exactly. What are you supposed to do? Make sure he calls his sponsor. I don't know. This is so chris. He's been a friend for a really long time. He got me my job. Which, if he hadn't, Stop it. I wouldn't have met you. Don't do this. Stop. Hmm? Just don't be late for your mother's inauguration, okay? Madame president. Not yet. This way. How are you feeling? Excited. Nervous. You should be. In a few hours, you're going to be The most powerful person in the world. As if you're not already hard enough to live with. Ma'am. Mr. Taylor. Tom. The president apologizes he could not be here to greet You in person, but something urgent has come up. Something urgent? Whatever it is, tom, It's going to land on my desk in about two hours. Could i just have a moment? I'm sorry. Don't be. Go ahead. Our embassy in sangala just got word of an imminent coup. How imminent? Very. Where's the president now? He's in the telepresence suite. He's on a secure line with prime minister matobo. Juma is moving his forces toward the capitol as we speak. This video was taken moments ago. Mr. Prime minister, This news has caught us all by surprise. But our priority here in washington is to ensure The safety of you and your family. My priority is to defend my country from this monster juma. And the only way that can happen is if you accelerate The military assistance your congress Has already pledged to us. Unfortunately, i'm not in a position to make that happen. Certainly not today. What about your successor? Will she be in a better position to help us? I'm afraid i can't speak for her. Will you excuse us for a moment? Yes, of course. You were right, sir. Taylor does want to weigh in on this. Where is she? Just outside. I'm sorry, mr. Prime minister, But i have to cut this short. The president-Elect is waiting for me. Please, sir, convey to her My request for military assistance. I'll do that. Mr. President. Senator taylor. Tom told me what's happening in sangala. It is a damn tough situation. Yeah, i don't understand. How could juma raise an army Without our getting wind of it? We disarmed him three years ago. The un's been monitoring the situation. Not closely enough, apparently. Then you have no idea who's supplying him? All we know is, juma's secured Some fairly advanced weapons systems, Which is why prime minister matobo is asking for Our military assistance. And what did you tell him? It's not a viable option. You don't agree. We have troops in the region. A show of force might make juma blink. And if it doesn't, we get caught up in Another civil quagmire halfway around the world. Now, that is a hard sell. Especially when there's nothing in sangala worth protecting. No natural resources, no substantial economic ties, Nothing that threatens our national security. The last time juma made a power grab, He ignited a tribal war that killed Tens of thousands of civilians. Our involvement could avert a genocide. And this war will be tragic, too. But it isn't our war. Which is why i've ordered the ambassador To begin evacuating all Non-Military nationals. I think that's a mistake. I n't want any americans Caught in the crossfire when juma starts shooting. Closing our embassy sends a signal to the world That we are willing to set out a democratic ally To a war criminal. I appreciate your idealism. I can't say the same for your cynicism. Let's talk... After you've been sitting in my chair for a while. And until then, We still have some transition business to go over. So, i suggest We get started. Send in tom lennox. Desmond? Desmond. Desmond. Open your eyes. Open your eyes! Oh, that's it. Stay with me, desmond. Stay with me. Open your eyes. Open your eyes! Do not go to sleep! Do you understand? Do not go to sleep. Good lad. Don't go to sleep. It's not heavy. I can carry it. I want to go with you. Me and my brother desmond, too. We can carry your things and work for you. No. Why not? Because you can't. I'm going alone. People who like to be alone Are witches, my grandfather says. Well, there you go. Your grandfather wouldn't be happy If you left here with a witch now, would he? He would want me to go to america. His favorite was elvis presley. I'm not going to america. Where are you going, then? I don't know yet. I don't know yet is better than here. You sure about that? Here doesn't seem so bad to me. Mr. Benton is very nice, But there are too many ghosts walking around. Ghosts? My mother, My father and my three sisters. They live in the bush and come out at night, But you wouldn't see them because you are poo-Mui. Poo-Mui? A white person. Willie, you and i are friends, right? I want you to do me a favor as a friend. I want you to stay here With mr. Benton and help take care of the other boys. Will you do that? You promise? Promise. Okay. Thank you. Jack! Benton's on direct connect. He says he needs to talk to you. Carl? Jack, James is dead, desmond's been shot. What happened? Juma's raising an army. Desmond says they're headed for the school. They're coming for the boys, jack. You got to get them into the shelter. Thomas knows where it is. How many guns are coming? Maybe a dozen. I don't know. You have to hold them off till i get there. Carl, you need to call the embassy. Get them to send some marines out here. I've been trying. I can't get through. Jack, go into my room. You'll find what you need in a locker under my sink. The key's on top of the cupboard. How far out are you? Maybe five minutes. Jack, Don't let them take don't the children.My kids. Carl, i won't. Everybody! Everybody, i want you to listen. I want you to go to the shelter with thomas. He's gonna take you there now. Go! What's going on? I don't have time to explain, willie. Just go with thomas, and ring the bell. Now! What about my brother? Your brother's with mr. Benton. Everybody, follow me! Juma's men are coming. Do you have a weapon? How do you know it's just not another rumor? Do you have a weapon or not? If they are coming, i will talk to them. They will listen to me. Save your helmet for the parade. There are coming. Two of our boys have already been shot! The united nations remains neutral in this matter. Still want to talk to them? I didn't think so. Why don't you go hide in the shelter with the other children? Are you the last? Yeah. Wait! Wait for me. Find the boys. Find them! Fire! No! Do not kill him yet. Not until he tells us where the children are hiding. Bring him. Stay here. Stay here. Where are you going? I'll be back in a bit. U.S. Citizens only. I have a sister in chicago. She has a job. She needs to sponsor you. By then, it will be too late. My husband died fighting juma. Juma will kill me. He will kill my child. I'm sorry. Whatever you want me to do for you, i will do. Please, just take me from here. Anything at all. I can't. I'm sorry. Sir, it's carl benton. Please don't let them Kill my baby, please! Please! Benton? I've been trying to get through to you. Yeah, our lines are overloaded. Juma's men are here. -They're raising an army.  -We know. You know? Yeah, we don't know how he managed to pull it off. No one saw it coming, but he's got soldiers And they're moving in on the capital. Well, they're here right now, frank. They're at my school. You have to send some marines to help. Well, i can't spare any. They're all being deployed for the evacuation Evacuation? The orders came down From the president. We're rolling up all u.S. Nationals. We already started ferrying people to the border. Frank, look, I've got 14 kids hiding in a shelter, And one is gonna bleed to death If he doesn't get medical attention. Look, if you want us to get you out, You need to get here on your own The last chopper's leaving in an hour. Frank, don't... don't strand me like this, please. -My hands are tied, carl.  -Frank... -Tramell, please.  -I'm sorry. Damn it! Damn it. I'm running out of ways to ask the question. Where are the children? You're wasting your time. They're not gonna find anything. I already told you they're not here. You're lying. No, i'm not. If you want to find soldiers for your army, You're gonna have to look somewhere else. Where are the children? I told you... i don't know. I will keep doing this until you beg me to kill you. But i won't kill you even then. Not until you tell me what i want to know. No. Please, please, no, no! I'll show you where the kids are. Tell me. I need to show you. They're in an underground shelter. No. You will tell me where this shelter is. Okay, okay, okay. About 200 meters up the footpath. Behind the tree line There's a wooden hatch under a mound of dirt. Please, please... Get the children. I'll stay here with him. Don't worry. Once i have these children, I will kill you quickly. You all right, jack? Yeah. The kids are in the shelter. How is desmond? He's lost a lot of blood. The border's five hours from here. I don't think he's gonna make it. I'm gonna try and get him to the embassy. They've started evacuating already. How are you gonna get the kids asylum? They're not u.S. Nationals. I've got sponsorship papers. Tramell's gonna let them in, But i have to go now, jack. The last chopper leaves in an hour. You all right? Go, go! Jack... Good luck. Stay here. Jack may need our help. And if they catch you, They will make you tell them where we are. You are endangering the rest of us. We wouldn't have been in danger If you'd done something about juma Instead of looking the other way. All right. Everyone out. Quickly. Go to the bus, quickly. Thomas, go get desmond. He's in the jeep by the end of the footpath, all right? Quickly, quickly, quickly. Go to the bus, go to the bus. Go to the bus. Where is my brother? Thomas is gonna get him. Then he's all right? He will be, he will be. Go to the bus. Quickly, quickly. Desmond. It's not as bad as it looks. On the bus. Move. Quickly. Quickly. Solenz? Where are you going? I told mr. Bauer before. The united nations remains neutral in this conflict. A un escort might help us get where we need to go. Solenz! Let him go. He's just trying to save his own ass Because he knows the children are a target. You're gonna need my help, carl. Juma's men are gonna set up roadblocks, Checkpoints all the way into the city. I got one of the soldiers' walkies. We can use it to try and avoid them. Jack You won't have to go anywhere near the embassy Just help me get the kids to the city. You can head to the border from there. Let's go. Yeah,thank you,can you take it easy,please? Just keep your hands where i can see them. I thought i told you he's expecting me. Hey,rog! Rog,can you call your watchdog off,please? Agent vossler He's a friend of mine,you can let him in. Thank you. Your friend's jacked up on something. I'll take care of it. It's all right. I'll be outside. Look,man,um,i know that my timing right now Must,you know,suck,so thank you. Uh,it's just,i'm... I think i'm in a little bit of trouble here,so... What kind of trouble? Coke,pills? Okay,you know what,don't get all righteous on me,rog,okay? I seem to remember most nights You party me under the table. That was a long time ago. Yeah,not that long ago. All right,you got five minutes,so talk fauh... Okay... a couple months ago Nichols calls me into his office, Says he wants me to manage A special project. Special project? Yeah.That's what he calls it. He says that he knows that i've taken some serious hits In the stock market,and,uh, He's gonna give me a chance to recover my losses. I mean,the money he paid me... Rog... It was crazy. All i had to do was keep my mouth shut. What did he have you do,chris? Oh,you know, Open a few offshore accounts,move a bunch of money In and out,that type of thing. So,you helped nichols embezzle money from his own firm? Yeah,that's what i thought i was doing at first, But,rog,three days ago, Recognized the prefix on one of the accounts. It's something the justice department has red-Flagged For traders to report,okay,so... Do a little digging Turns out that the,uh,the account holder Is on the terrorist watch list. I know,it's crazy, And it's all getting a little too weird fe. This morning,there was this creepy guy In nichols' office who... Look,i don't know what he's doing. I don't want to have anything to do with it. I'm willing to turn state's evidence. Yeah,good,you should go to the fbi. Man,i was just thinking that,uh... I could probably cut a much better deal If we take this directly to your mother,you know. You want my mother to clean up your mess? Chris,what do you expect me to say to that? What do i... i don't know,rog. How about... "I'm sorry to hear that you're in trouble,chris, "But you're a friend of mine, "And i'm gonna do whatever i can do To help you out." Do you even have any evidence? Nichols asked me to destroy some records. I didn't do it. I,um... I sent them to my hard drive at home instead. They're coded, But,you know,they're probably traceable. Hello,chris. Hey,sam,you look great. Thank you. We really need to leave now. We're already pushing it. Agent vossler's in the car waiting. I'll meet you there. I'm right behind you. See you at work later? Right. I have to go. I know,i know,i know. Look,look,if i forward you these records, Will you at least show them to your mother? I'm not talking to anybody until i see them for myself. Okay,all right,that's... Look,rog,thank you. Just,can you check your e-Mail in one hour? Clean yourself up,okay? 16 mortar teams supported by 20 forward observers. Make sure we all have the same encryption codes. And have a backup in case the government To jam communication. Sir,general juma is here. Welcome home,general. Colonel dubaku. Look what you've built here. Our american friends have been very helpful. -Did they send us the howitzers? -Yes. We have them in position about 20 kilometers From the capitol. We can hit any target in the city. All we need is your order to begin the bombardment. Sir... one of our checkpoints. Excuse me,general. Yes? Colonel,this is lieutenant kintu, Checkpoint delta. We have a man in custody,a un relief worker. He was driving is base, But we have detained him for questioning. He says he has information about your brother. What sort of information? He says your brother is dead,sir. Your brother and his men... they were ambushed At the american school. He says that he can help us find the man who killed your brother. I'll be right back. I managed to stop the bleeding, But desmond's fever is spiking. If we don't get him to a hospital soon, He's going to go into shock. We're five kilometers from the city. Carl,i'm really sorry about the school. I know how much you put into it. Just a bunch of cement and 2x4s,right? What the hell was i thinking? That things were finally let different here That this country had turned a corner. The bus is from the american school. They are heading into the city From okavango. There is only one of two roads they can go. I am seeing patrols on both. This is patrol one,sir. We have not seen a bus matching that description. Where is your position? Heading east,one kilometer west of okavango junction. Jack They're right in front of us. Everybody,hold on. Hold on. What is it? A rebel patrol. Carl,we can't get back on that road. Follow the river. It leads into the city. Desmond will not make it that far. Then you help him,thomas, But we're not getting back on that road. Where are we going? We're going to walk to the embassy. Let's go,quickly,quickly. The decision book. Master protocols for the command And control of our nuclear arsenal. I never knew how much i didn't know till i read that book. Are the gold codes in here? Not yet. Dan wilcox will deliver them to your designate. All right, then. Well, if we're finished here, i should get going. Join me for a drink. A toast to your administration. As much as i'd like to, It's still a little early in the morning. You sure? Yes. To your administration. Thank you. Thank you, mr. President. Thank you, mr. President. Please extend my gratitude To your transition team for all they've done. You know what the talking heads are saying? They're saying that i lost this election Because i didn't want to win it. They're saying that... My heart wasn't in it. What about you? Me? Do you agree with their opinion? I don't believe there's a simple answer to that question. You are right. Nothing about this job lends itself to simple answers, Just, uh... Jagged edges and moving parts. Most you won't even see coming Till they've smacked you in the head. So... ...be careful, Madame president. See you at the inauguration. Are you all right? I'm not sure yet. Gentleman, we just got word of a coup In sangala. Daniels has ordered the embassy to evacuate Without even consulting me. Is it the right call? Right or wrong, he should have brought me in on the decision. Maybe he's still bitter about the election. Noah daniels isn't that vindictive. You think he has a reason for pulling out of sangala Before you take office? Maybe. I'll call ethan from the car. If daniels is hiding anything about sangala, he'll be able To dig it up. It's definitely the bus from okavango. They were here not too long ago, at least a dozen boys. I don't care how many boys. How many men? Just benton, Or is he with that bastard that killed my brother? There were two men. Along the river would be Their fastest route. Colonel dubaku. I am sorry to hear about your brother, but i need you here. Are you ordering me to stay? Our campaign is just beginning, and you are Critical to its success. There will be time for you to avenge your brother After we have taken power. The man who killed my brother Is heading toward the american embassy. They are evacuating within an hour. That is all the time i have And all the time i need. Sir. Excuse me, general. Sir, the men are ready, sir. Go. Go. Is this everything, Mr. Whitley? You've been stealing financial records From your office. Those files are private property, and i'm here To recover them. Is this everything? Uh, look, i, i saw something that didn't look right... Took it home to check it out-- That's probably a mistake, and i... just calm down. Answer my questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's everything. It's all there. What about your laptop? Um, it's... it's in my briefcase if you want to check it. Did you make any hard copies? No, i swear. I... i barely even looked at those files. Who have you shown them to? No one. Nobody. So, um... Just erase it and then you take whatever you want Then you leave. Okay? Are we cool? Do we look like fools to you? Huh? No. Do we, do we? No. No. Then don't talk to us like we are. Okay. Sit down.

It's been a long journey, madame president. I'm afraid we're just getting started. Henry. Ethan. Our africa group is preparing a brief on sangala. You'll have it on your desk as soon as you're done here. Wo good morning. Good morning. Congratulations. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you so much. You look beautiful, madame president. Thank you, samantha. Father. It's nice to see you on time for once. How are you holding up? It still doesn't feel quite real. It will soon enough. Whitley needed some encouragement, But he told my man everything. How much does roger taylor know? Nothing you need to worry about. But he knows nichols was involved. All he knows is that his desperate, Drug-Addicted friend told him some crazy story. He's got no evidence. If he finds nichols, He could find me. Not without evidence. Sir, whitley's no longer a problem. We limited the damage. But you haven't eliminated it. Keep your eye on taylor. Stay together! Sergeant! Sergeant! I need to see Frank tramell; he's expecting me! Who are you? Jack bauer! Stay with me! Don't worry, desmond! We made it! We're going to america! Tramell! Listen to me, i've got 14 children seeking Political asylum. All of them are r-1 status! One of them needs urgent medical care! Where's benton? He's dead! Wait! Wait! I've got their paperwork. Show me. Keep desmond up. There! Desmond, it's all right. Just stay with me. Come on! They appear to be in order. Good! Then open the gate, and let them in! There's just one small problem. They need the legal guardianship Of a u.S. Citizen. Guardianship?! I already told you, benton is dead! He died getting these children here! Then don't let him have died in vain. Surrender yourself to the subpoena, And the ambassador will waive The issue of guardianship. Tramell, i am warning you, leave me out of this. I'm afraid i can't do that. We are talking about innocent children. Whatever happens to them is all on you. You would really leave these children Out here in the street, knowing What you do about juma?! Damn it, frank! They'll be used as cannon fodder! Or slaughtered in the soccer stadium for entertainment! I am giving you the chance to make sure that doesn't happen! The choice is yours. I don't have a choice, you son of a bitch. Open the gate. Hold on, boys. Hold on. Desmond, come on! No, no, no. You in first, bauer. It's all right, willie. It's all right. It's all right. All right, take him into custody right now. Let them in! Let them in! Let them in! They're with me! Let them in, damn it! No! Those with me, too! All of them! All of them! It's all right, willie. Just go with them. Go with the soldiers. Put them on the choppers. It's all right. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, allison taylor, do solemnly swear... I, allison taylor, do solemnly swear... That i will faithfully execute the office Of the president of the united states. That i will faithfully execute The office of the president of the united states. And will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect And defend the constitution of the united states. And will to the best of my ability, Preserve, protect, and defend The constitution of the united states. So help me, god. So help me, god. Congratulations, madame president. Thank you. Thank you. When the founders of our country Boldly declared america's independence to the world, They knew that they derived Their power to govern from three basic human rights. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Today, we rededicate ourselves To the preservation Of those inalienable rights. But even as we carry forth The torch lit by those great men, We need to remember, its light don't Always shine as brightly as it should. It flickers and grows dim Because of apathy, Greed... And fear. De tocqueville said, "In every democracy, The people get the government they deserve." Today... I am asking each of you To help me give you The government you deserve. We all share the responsibility History has placed in our hands.
