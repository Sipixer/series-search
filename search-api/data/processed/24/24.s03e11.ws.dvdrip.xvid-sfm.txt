- I don't make threats. I just tell it like it is. He's showing you that he had the power to help start your political career, but he also has the power to end it. There has to be a way to get to him. - David, what's wrong? - I need your help. Hector and Ram Ãn are trying to buy a virus to use as a weapon. Millions of people could die. I've set up this deal so my government can destroy the virus. - You're still with CTU? - Yes, I'm still with CTU. I cannot allow this virus to get into the wrong hands. The virus they're going to buy, Jack is going to take it from them. Jack promised to get me and my family out of here if I help you. Come on. Move it. Hurry, hurry. Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico. His transponder signal stopped working. We're doing all we can to re-establish contact. Tell the Delta units to hold their position. There's been a complication. Another buyer's interested in the virus. - What? We have a deal. - We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder. We found out there's another player in the deal. - Who is it? - Nina Myers. Your bid is 225 million dollars. Hers is 240. You win. - We can get the virus. - How do you get the virus? I told you. I know her. I can get to her. The Salazars will pay you at least ten times more than what you're getting. Are you going to be able to forgive me for killing your wife? If I wanted revenge, Nina, I would have killed you already. All I wanna do is finish this deal and disappear for good. Convince me. - Adam. Is Amador moving yet? - No, he's still stopped at the location. - What do we know about the area? - It's mostly rural, very few structures. - Do we have infrared on it? - Yeah. It's not high-res satellite. There are vehicles and bodies nearby. We have no idea what they are. Give him space. Make sure he feels safe enough to take delivery of the virus. - Got it. - What's the latest on Chase Edmunds? He phoned his position into the Delta teams and they're en route to pick him up. - Edmunds? - Yeah. - What's your condition? - Shot in the hand. But I'm fine. - What about the others? - I got two people coming with me. We spotted a vehicle heading this way. It's the Salazars. They can't know CTU is down here. We need to leave now. Then let's get outta here. Sergio, we're getting on the chopper. We're going to a safe place. Oriol, go right now. I can't leave her like this. Hector's coming. You need to think about your son. - Bueno. Vamonos. - We gotta go now. Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move! Keep them low! Keep them low! Give him to me now! Come on! Stay low! Stay low! Yes? Alan, it's Wayne Palmer. What do you want? I thought you had more balls than to threaten me through my brother. What, you can't talk to me man to man? I don't owe you an explanation. You slept with my wife. - That's between you and me, Alan. - Fine. Step down and it all goes away. - That's not your decision. - We'll see. Wayne. Who you talking to? Alan Milliken. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Cleaning up my own mess. - Hello, Alan. - Mr President. That brother of yours is going to be your undoing. - I am not firing my brother. - That's too bad. I have no intention of losing my healthcare bill. I spent two years putting it together. Except you're three votes short, the last I checked. You better brace yourself for some disappointment. I don't wanna go to war with you, Alan. It's your choice, Mr President. The choice is unacceptable. There has to be another way to work this out. On any other issue I'd bend over backwards to accommodate you. Not on this one. You have only yourself to blame for the consequences. And I promise you... you won't like them. - When's Sherry getting here? - Five minutes. Good. Sure you want to bring her into this? We're in a street fight, Wayne. It's what she does best. And we both have to focus on what's happening in Mexico. I know we're hoping for success, but we have to anticipate failure. If Jack Bauer does not intercept the virus, then we are dealing with an international crisis. This is Michael Amador. He's representing the Ukrainians in the sale of the virus. We have a Delta team tracking him on the ground at a safe distance. Why don't they just get Amador now? He may not be carrying the virus, and we'd blow our chance at the interception. Once Jack confirms it is the virus, the Delta teams will go in and secure it. - Delta asked for a photo of the woman... - Adam, wait. Nina Myers is the broker? - Didn't you read the ops brief? - No. Kim, come with me. - Would you finish the briefing? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I was looking for the right time to tell you. I cannot believe Nina Myers is involved in this. Your father needed her help to secure the virus. She killed my mother. My father couldn't even pretend to work with her. I'm sorry, Jack. I'm sorry, Jack. I wanted to think you'd changed, but I can feel it. You're lying. You haven't forgotten anything, have you? You despise me. You'd do anything to get me to go along with your plan. - It's not true. - It is true. I know you're still with CTU. So why would I let you set me up? You know what? You can believe whatever you want. I need this deal to happen. I'm a fugitive. I don't have a choice. I need the Salazars to pay me for the virus and Amador will only deal with you. Do you understand me? I'll honour your original deal. You'll get your 20 million dollars. And you get to keep breathing. Until my client doesn't get what he paid for. Right now your client should be the least of your worries. (speaking Spanish) Hector. She's dead. Get away from her. Claudia. Claudia. They can't be far away. Find them. Find them! Find them! The Mexican authorities are pissed off that we didn't notify them earlier. (phone rings) It's Hector. - You set? - Go. - Yeah. - It's me. Edmunds escaped. He killed three of my men. Has he contacted CTU? Not yet. But he may not call. I found out Edmunds is rogue. He's been acting on his own. CTU hasn't sent anyone down here to find him? They don't even know where he is. - You call me the second you hear from him. - I will. (phone rings) - Yeah. - Are you still with Bauer? I'm at the main road into town, waiting for Bauer to bring the woman. - We have to call this off. - What are you taking about? The CTU agent, Edmunds, he escaped. - How? - I don't know. Claudia was with him. Ram Ãn... she's dead. I'm sorry. But, Hector, we still have business to do. Not with Edmunds on the loose. When he gets to a phone, he'll call CTU. - Find him before that happens. - I am trying, but it's too dark. - He'll be impossible to track. - What do you suggest we do? Forget it. It's too dangerous. - It always has been. - Not like this. You were the one who made this deal. You promised our buyers what we can't deliver. If you don't keep your promise, my reputation will be ruined. Do you understand? I understand. Keep some of your men looking for Edmunds and bring the rest here so we can do the deal. (phone rings) - Yes. - Ram Ãn, it's Jack. - Everything clear outside? - Yes. I need you to come back to the building. - Did the woman agree to work with us? - I'll explain when you get here. - (knock at door) - Yes. - Mr President. - Yes, Aaron? Sherry Palmer is here. Show her in. Thank you. - Hello, Sherry. - David. Thank you, Aaron. - Please, have a seat. - No, thank you. I... I'd rather stand. - So, how are things with Anne? - They're fine. Good. I'm glad. You, uh... You deserve a little bit of happiness. Thank you. You're looking well, but somehow different. - A little older. - No, it's not that. - You look calm. - Um... tired, maybe. But I'm not sure exactly how calm. I know these last three years have been difficult. Well... not as difficult as they could have been. And I have you to thank for that. You kept me out of prison, away from public humiliation. I... I lost a lot. But most of it, I discovered, really wasn't that important to begin with. Which surprised me. Imagine that. - What? What's funny? - No, nothing, really. It's just that when I wanted you to pull back and just let things be, you were a shark. Now that I've asked you back, I need you to be a shark. I can still be whatever you need me to be. Thank you. So you say you're having some kind of trouble with Milliken? Yes. I am. OK. Tell me all about it. (door opens) Handcuffs? I thought you were going to gain her trust. I will. It's just going to take a little longer than I hoped. She'll do the exchange. That's what's important. - When is it happening? - As soon as Amador calls. Amador better call soon. We might not have much time. Your partner escaped. - You should have let me kill him. - Yes, I should have. For some reason Claudia was with him. She ended up dead. What are you talking about? How? Hector didn't say. Tell Hector I'm sorry. Tell him yourself when he gets here. Nina, I need you to open up this transaction file. Amador's gonna wanna verify your client's funds. Now! The bottom line is, Alan's determined to see Wayne removed. Even if it means destroying my presidency. - You've tried to work this out peacefully? - Of course. Alan wouldn't budge. In Alan's mind, it's a matter of pride. So you want me to find something you can use against Alan? I've always known you knew things about Alan that you didn't tell me because of my friendship with him. And I've always known you were too smart to ask. Well, I guess we're both right. Alan does have skeletons in his closet that he would guard at any cost. One in particular comes to mind. But I must warn you, David. It's a big one. What is it? All you need to know is that if you play this card, you and Alan Milliken will be enemies for the rest of your life. As far as I'm concerned, our friendship ended when he tried to extort me. Then I can help you. Our insertion points are here and here. Claudia's dead. Why did she die? So we could be safe. Your sister was very brave, Sergio. We don't have to worry about Hector no more. But I like Hector. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, will do. Copy that. - That's good enough. Give it to me. - I'm not finished. Reiss, what's going on? With the Salazars after us, CTU wants me to pull back my surveillance team. - We can't lose Amador. - CTU's tracking him through his phone. He can dump his phone. We need visual. Don't worry about that. It's not your problem any more. Don't tell me it's not my problem! It's been my problem for the last year! Look, Edmunds, you need medical attention. We're evacuating you with the boy and his father now. I'm not going anywhere. - Mr Chappelle. - Yeah. I'm picking up heat signatures moving in on Amador's position. - Ground vehicles? - From the speed it looks like it. - This may be the virus. - What protocols do you want me on? - Shall I contact the Delta teams? - Put them on alert. Make sure they don't approach until Amador meets Bauer. We want a visual on the virus. OK. Got it. Sherry. Wayne. What are you doing in here? I'm waiting for them to prepare an office for me. It's good to see you, Sherry, but to be blunt, I don't think your being here is a good idea. Of course you don't. That's because this is all about your indiscretion with Julia. - Sherry. - I say that with no judgment. Of course. You're the last person who's in a position to pass judgment. OK, let's not play this. We're both too good at it. So, what do you want me to hear? - I appreciate you coming to help David... - No, no, no. Skip that part. That's right. I forgot that about you. Listen, Sherry, do whatever it is that you do around here for a few hours. But then tell David you were unable to find anything that he could use on Milliken. Hm. You know, if I do that, the only way out of this is if you resign. Which is what I wanna do. David doesn't want that, and frankly, neither do l. - Sherry, why do you care? - Because David needs someone like me. Someone who sees things the way they really are, who's not afraid to throw a punch every now and then. It's obvious I can't play that role any more, but you can. No, Wayne, I feel good knowing David's got you and I'm gonna make sure he keeps you. So save your breath, I'm gonna fix this and you are gonna make sure your brother gets re-elected. Fine. But, Sherry, don't you forget how dangerous Alan Milliken can be. Oh, I won't forget. I'm afraid you're the one who forgot, when you decided to get involved with his wife. We haven't heard from Jack in over an hour, but our Delta teams are on standby. We're monitoring from here. You'll advise us of any changes. I'll let him know. All right, good. Do you have any more information on Nina Myers? No, not yet. Look, Kim, I know it's hard, but you're gonna have to put your feelings aside till all this is over. How can I put my feelings aside? How can my father put his feelings aside? I've spent the last three years knowing that the woman who killed my mother was pardoned by the president. And that she's out there... Iiving her life. And it's wrong. I know. She's violating her pardon. She's buying and selling the virus. - Kim. - We cannot let her get away this time. - Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. - Please. She has to pay for what she's done. Promise me when this is all over, you'll at least help make that happen. (phone rings) - Yeah. - Tony, this is Chloe. - Is Kim in there? - Yeah. - I need her. - All right, she's on her way. Kim. I'll do what I can. Thank you. - (baby gurgles) - Shh. It's OK. - (phone rings) - Good girl. Nice and warm. - Yes? - Chloe, where are the index keys for Salazar? - Who is this? - Patrick in Com One. You guys aren't authorised to access those keys. - I'll come and do it for you. - I'm trying to save some time. - I'll be down in a minute. - Fine. Chloe. You wanted me? Michelle needs me to brief people in Division, then I have to give index keys to Com One. I need you to watch some things for me. Can you do your work from my station? - Yeah, I guess so. - Good. This is Angela. She's been fed, so she'll sleep. If she gets fussy, put that in her mouth. But you can't have a baby in here! Chappelle thinks I had someone pick her up, so if he comes up, just keep her hidden. - Yeah, but I can't... - I'll be back in 15 minutes. Ram Ãn. Jack's not who you think he is. - Is that right? - He's working with CTU. He's setting you up. Do you think that my brother and I are that stupid? We made sure that he's acting alone. Don't you even think of undermining this deal. (phone rings) Hey, Jack. I think it's Amador. Put this phone on speaker. You say one wrong word and he will kill you. You understand? Go. - Hello. - I've got the product. - Are you ready to show me your account? - Yes. - We agreed you'd provide audit privileges. - Yes. Tell me your routing number. 77509210. Account number 45508996. OK. The funds are in that account, ready to be transferred? Yeah. There's an old mine east of Posta Mita. Meet me at the northernmost building in an hour and ten minutes. I'll have one man with me for security. You may do the same. Good. We'll leave as soon as Hector arrives. Yuri. (shouts command) Amador's on the move. - What direction? - East. Likely destination? There's half a dozen villages. It could be any one of them. With all due respect, Adam was right. We should order Delta Team to move in and arrest Amador. If the virus isn't under Amador's control, we could lose it. - We gotta wait for Jack's confirmation. - How will he let us know? The Salazars are watching him. He can't call. I don't know. He'll find a way. Shouldn't we inform the Mexican government what it is we're doing on their soil? No. I don't wanna risk compromising the operation. You should call the president yourself. Once he understands what kind of threat this virus poses, he should ease up. Yes. Sir, Alan Milliken is holding for you on line five. Thank you, Aaron. - Yes, Alan. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - What are you talking about? - Don't screw with me, David. I didn't pick this fight. You think you can enlist your psychopathic ex-wife to manufacture lies to bring me down? It's not going to happen. You want it to stop, stay away from my healthcare bill and my brother. You've got it backwards. Your brother should have stayed away from my wife. - Come on, Alan, it's over. - Really? I'm looking at photographs of her and Wayne together an hour ago. He was trying to convince her to talk some sense into you. I'm warning you, David. Pull Sherry off this, or the bill will be the least of your problems. - Alan's scared. - Alan is most dangerous when he's scared. Mm-hm. Tell the Mexican ambassador that I'll be calling his president directly. - She's still out of town. - I heard you the first time. I'm not deaf. I understand she's away. I want to talk to her about Chagrin Falls and give her this number. - All right. - Thank you. - Yes, David? - I just got off the phone with Alan Milliken. The blowback happened quickly, huh? I guess he was pretty upset. - What have you been up to? - Exactly what you asked me to do. I'm fighting back. What's Chagrin Falls and what happened there? It's something that Alan wants to keep buried. I'm gonna tell you everything, but not just now. I got a lot to get done in a very short period of time if I'm gonna pull this off for you. All right. Across from the opening of the mine there's enough cover to hide your men. - All right, good. - (door opens) - Did you find Edmunds? - No. It's too dark to find him. You don't need to look for Edmunds. Even if he contacted CTU, they don't have time to get here before the deal happens. - What makes you so sure they're not here? - Didn't Gael say Edmunds came down alone? Why is she tied up? Bauer said he's going to buy her cooperation. Don't worry. She'll do what she's told. Ram Ãn, can I speak to you in private? - What is it? - This is not the plan. I don't like it. I know you are upset about Claudia, but there's no reason to panic. I'm not panicking, I'm being sensible. - This was your deal in the first place. - And you were against it. You was right and I was wrong. Edmunds escapes, Claudia is dead, now this woman goes only along at gunpoint. - It doesn't feel right. - We don't have a choice. The buyers are waiting for this deal to happen because of you. - Ram Ãn, things are not going as planned. - The plans have changed. (phone rings) CTU, Dessler. We are following through with what you have started. Hello? They aren't... Ram Ãn, I'm sorry to interrupt, but if you want this deal to happen, we gotta go now. Tony! Jack's on the line. He's using his cell as a one-way. Put it on speaker. (Jack) Amador will be at the mine in an hour. It's gonna take us that long to get there and get your men into position. Bauer's right. Our men need to be in place before Amador gets there. - I still haven't signed off on this. - You do what I tell you to do. Now call your men and tell them to be at the village outside the mine. Dammit! My battery. - Hey, Jack, where's the other phone? - Got it here. - It's disconnected. - They told us what we need to know. Get the Delta teams in position. Set up a quarantine zone in case the virus gets out. (Gael) Bauer made it through. The deal is going down near a mine just outside of Posta Mita in 55 minutes. - How long until you can mobilise? - We've got the coordinates. Moving now. - Your men are mobilising. - They will be 3km from the strike zone. - How did you find out where? - Bauer got through. It's going down in 55 minutes. - You're keeping your men three clicks away? - We're keeping them out of sight. How will you know the package contains the virus? I'm sending in a forward observer. - Have you picked anyone yet? - No, not yet. I'll do it. - We got people trained for that, Edmunds. - I'm trained for it too. Besides, I know the Salazars, remember? - Your hand. - This isn't combat, it's observation. All right. Trell, gear this man up with the surveillance package. - Get over it, Hector. - Not until you respect what I have to say. - The Americans could be hiding anywhere. - There's no more time to argue. Stop talking down to me! Did you already forget the only reason you are here is because of me? - Who got you out of prison? - Bauer got me out. Not you. Now that I'm out, you take orders from me, like you always have. - Ram Ãn... - It's over, Hector. No more talking. We're gonna do the deal now. Bauer! Get her in the car. You can't control this, Jack. Just get in the car. Hombres, vamonos. - (baby crying) - What's the matter? Please don't cry. Shh, it's OK. - Shh. - (crying continues) - What did you do to her? - I didn't do anything to her. You must have done something. Chloe, look, I promise you, I didn't do anything to her. I'm gonna redirect all my files back down to my desk. I'm finished with this. Jack and Nina are meeting Amador in 53 minutes in a place called Posta Mita. - What about Delta Force? - They've established a perimeter of 3km. - (baby screaming) - What the hell is that? Dammit. I told her. Michelle, you take care of this, please. - That's it, Chloe. You're out of here. - I said I didn't have anyone to watch her. You'll watch her. I gave you a warning. You're suspended. - It was a verbal warning only. - Ryan. - What? - Jack's meeting Amador in less than an hour. We have no visual satellite coverage of that area. What does that have to do with this baby? We have to use digitally enhanced audio coverage. Chloe is the best we have at that. You're telling me we have to let this woman raise her child in our office because no one can do her job? Maybe we should deal with Chloe's childcare problems on another day. OK, thatta girl. (cries) I have work to do. Who's gonna look after my child? - Give her to Kim. - What? Based on what CTU got from Jack, the meeting will take place here, by an old mine north of town. My position is gonna be here. I need you to put your men behind this ridge until we know that the virus is real. Good natural cover. That'll work. - How long will it take your men to get there? - 90 seconds. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Where are the rest of the men? - Felipe brought everyone. - There's not enough. - Amador is only bringing one man. So he says. - Stop making problems. - I'm making sure we are covered. You want to stop this because you lost your nerve. Things are moving fast. We haven't had time to think them through. - We'll be fine. - That doesn't mean we'll be fine. The situation is difficult enough. Don't make it worse. Or what? Ram Ãn, if you want this deal to happen, we have to leave now. We have to be there 20 minutes before Amador. The deal is off! All right. - Hector, we're not done here. - I've said what I need to say. Listen to me, Hector. Listen to me carefully. If we don't give our buyers what you promised, we won't just lose money, we'll lose respect. And without that, we have nothing. We'll have our lives. We're leaving now. Pablo, Felipe, vamonos. Now! Hector, don't do this. Hector! Hector!
