disappear. You just give me the OK. - David put you up to this, didn't he? - Sherry, l... The police think I killed Alan. Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut. It's nobody's fault but your own. Oh, my God. Sherry... No! You committed treason. You facilitated the escape of a man who was responsible for the death of Ryan Chappelle and almost a thousand civilians. With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years. Tell me how to find your couriers, or I'll put her in that building. - She has nothing to do with this! - Neither do the people in those body bags. When your daughter is infected, I'm gonna make you watch her die. Dad, stop them! - Stephen, you're out of time! - Stop! Stop! I'll tell you! Where's the 11th vial? - Los Angeles. - What's the target? He was told to select a public place where maximum casualties would be inflicted. (Chloe) Target has stopped moving. The target has stopped. Drop the bag! Get on the ground, now! Don't move! - What's going on? - Where is it? Where is it? - Where's what? - Chase. - What are you doing? What's going on? - I've got a signal. What are you looking for? It's just the transmitter. This man is not Rabens. Shut the station down now! This is Dessler. It's Jack. We just lost Rabens. He dumped the GPS beacon onto an innocent. - He still has the virus? - We have to assume so. We're sweeping the station. We've locked down the building. - We'll set up checkpoints. - How will you find Rabens? We need Saunders to do an lD. Move him to Chloe's station. We're setting up a live feed. We'll be ready on our end. Michelle, Gael Ortega's wife Theresa's here. All right, Jesse. Send her in. According to Chloe's statement, you were working to bring down Saunders, even while you were complying with his demands. Yeah, that's right. I gave Chloe a recording of a conversation between Saunders and... Chloe also said you intentionally scrambled the voice to slow down her progress. Tony, did you put Michelle's life ahead of public safety or national security? Yes. I did. They said he was exposed to a virus. Yeah, that's right. Did he suffer? No. He went quickly. (sobs) Gael... He was a hero. He tried to stop the virus being released, and when it was, he just kept working. Till the end. Thank you. Thank you. Can I pick up his things? Of course. I'll see what I can do. Wait here. - Kim? - Yes, Michelle? That's Mrs Ortega. Gael's wife. I need you to take her to his station to pick up his personal belongings. Thank you. (Michelle) Sit him down. (phone rings) Hello? (Chloe) I need you. Saunders is here to lD Rabens. Well, I'm with Mrs Ortega. Michelle said I could reassign anyone, and I want you. Please don't make me ask again. Fine. I'll get Barry to watch her. - Barry? - Yeah? Please watch Mrs Ortega while she gathers Gael's things. Sure. - Take as much time as you need. - Thanks. - Excuse me, Barry. Can I get a signature? - Sure. Thanks. - (Barry) Anything else? - No, that's all. Sir, if you'll just step up to the monitor. Right here. Chin up, please, sir. Chin up. (Saunders) Move in closer on 2A. - Jack, it's me. - Any matches? - Nothing yet. - How far have you got? We've gone through the first two sets of photos. - Next group is uploading. Stand by. - (Saunders) It's not him. - Is there anything on this page? - Try 3B closer up. No, that's not him. No. - No. - Do we have a match? - Negative, Jack. - Don't see him anywhere. - Next. - Yeah. Head up, sir. - Bring up 5B. - No. - Are you sure? - He's not here. Bring up the next page. What about this one? No? - He killed Gael! Don't you understand? - I need medical! - What's going on over there? - Saunders has been shot. What are you talking about? Who shot him? Gael's wife. Hold on, Jack. I need medical here now! - What is his condition? - Looks critical. Do everything you can to keep him alive. He's our only connection to Rabens. - Chase. - Yeah? - Jack? - Talk to me. - He didn't make it. - Son of a bitch. We'll get back to you. Saunders has just been shot. He's dead. - (man) Don't move, ma'am. Don't move. - (Theresa sobs) (Theresa) He did kill... Gael... (PA) The service is experiencing significant delays. From the couriers and our own intelligence, we've been able to confirm that Saunders was the sole architect of today's actions. If we catch this last man, Arthur Rabens, that'll be the end of the threat. And if not, we're back to square one and the virus is back on the market. Find him. - Hello, Wayne. - Joseph, could you give us a minute? - Thank you, Joseph. - Mr President. Well? Did you get the prescription bottle from Sherry's house? Yeah. Well, that's good. David... David, something horrible happened and I don't... Sherry's dead. What? How? Julia. She came in and she killed her, and then she turned the gun on herself. They're both dead? Yeah. Listen, I'm not gonna try to pretend that we can just put this behind us. But the fact is... The fact is that politically we're free of everything. Free of Milliken's extortion, his death. Free of Sherry's involvement. You're thinking of the politics of this? The mother of my children has just been murdered. And the woman that I love just killed herself in front of me. I understand how you feel. But there's a story here, David. There's a story that can tie this all together. Alan Milliken was having an affair with Sherry. Julia found out and then she killed them both. - Oh, no. I don't wanna hear it. - Your emotions are clouding... No! David, please, just listen to me. Leave me alone. David, please... Jeannie? Yes, Mr President? Would you get my son and my daughter on a conference line, please? Separate the crowd into units of ten, an officer to each unit. That officer's to make sure no one leaves that unit unless authorised by a CTU agent. I understand. We're also gonna search every passenger. Then we're gonna verify their identification. - Be here all day. - Not if we find him. Initiate another search of the station, including the tracks a mile in each direction. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Jack, we're locked down. We've got two men at every exit. Good. - Is there anything else we can do right now? - Not until we get an lD on Rabens. Jack, listen. About Mexico. I hope you know I understand you were just doing your job. Look, it took me a long time to understand that if you wanna do this job well, you have to stay detached. If you can accept that, you'll be fine. Yeah. Well, I have accepted it. That's why I'm thinking after today I'm done. I don't wanna be detached, Jack. Not from Kim, not from my daughter. I'm gonna request a transfer to the floor. Are you sure about this? I'd still be serving my country. I'd take care of the people I care about. I owe them that, Jack. What'd Kim say? I think she's willing to give it a try as long as I'm not in field ops. What do you think, Jack? I'm the last person you should be asking. This is between you and Kim. Whatever you choose I would support. You're a good man, Chase. Let's go. Moving in. Form a line here, sir. Fast. We'll be checking your belongings and your identification. Sir, please. At the end. Thank you, sir. You only have nine people here. Where's the man in the brown jacket? - I don't know. - We have a passenger unaccounted for. This is Jack Bauer. We have two LAPD officers down at the northwest exit. I need transportation to meet me on the corner. (people shouting) (man) Help! - I'm a federal agent. What happened? - A carjacking. - Did you get a make on the car? - No. This is Jack Bauer. We've got a civilian casualty on Hope and 7th. - Did you see which way the car went? - He went straight down there. I need that transportation now. Michelle, this is Jack. Rabens is out of the station. He was headed east on 5th Street five minutes ago. I need to lD a stolen car. Get me a DMV readout on a... - Frank Cassar. - Then set up roadblocks at a five-mile radius. Coordinate sat surveillance, traffic cameras, everything we've got. (phone rings) Yeah? All right. I'll be right out. I need to step out. (door opens) Brad, Rabens is gone. He got through the perimeter at the MTA station. - How the hell did that happen? - Doesn't matter how. It happened. We identified the vehicle he carjacked, a blue Malibu. We set up a roadblock and uplinked traffic cams, but I need Tony to coordinate the data flow with Tactical. There's no downside here, Brad. He's not a flight risk, and he'd be a major asset. - I could be brought up on charges. - We can't lose Rabens. So unless you wanna take responsibility and run Tactical yourself... You're wasting time, Brad. We need you on the floor. - Come on, Chloe, where's Rabens? - Just a second, Jack. I think I've got a match. A light green Malibu, intersection of 5th and Vanowen. We're only a few blocks away. We'll go there now. - Adam, get me a closer shot of that plate. - Doing it now. I'm back in play, Jack. Michelle got me up to speed. - Tony, how long till the plate's lD'd? - Adam, do we have a match? - Yes. It's him. The plates match. - Jack, it's him. - Where's he headed? - East on Del Mar, just past Franklin. It's the next block. Right there, right there! We got him. He's headed south on Manning. We need backup. Copy that. - Tony, where's that backup coming in from? - From the east and the south. We just made a right. We're headed west on De Soto. Move that thing now! We've been cut off. He made a right onto Lawndale. We're three blocks behind him. Three vehicles are ready to cut him off. We're gonna corner him. - (Tony) We got him pinned on Chamberlain. - Keep him there. We're two blocks away. He ran into the middle school on Chamberlain, main entrance. Tony, we're coming up on the middle school now. He's in the school. I'll get back to you. Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits. We cannot evacuate. We run the risk of losing him. Let's move. Haynes, cover the west exit. Get anything? Cover your exit. No one leaves this building. Chase, take your man. Search the auditorium. (PA) All students are to remain in their classrooms and lock their doors. I repeat, remain in the classrooms and lock the doors. Chase, it's Jack. Second floor is clear. Do you copy? Chase? No! (gunshots) Now, Chase, just lay still. Everything's gonna be all right. This is the only thing I could do to keep him from escaping with the virus. (Jack grunts) Don't waste your time. It's not coming off. - What are you talking about? - Rabens didn't even try to remove it. If he could unlock it, he would have. Tony, Rabens is dead. The virus is in our possession. The dispersal device has been activated. I've got no idea how long we've got. Find a secure container, anything airtight. I can't do that. The device is attached to Chase's wrist. - What? - I'll explain later. Put me in touch with one of the teams that have disarmed the device already. - I'll get back to you. - Hurry. Just support the device. I don't know how this is gonna turn out, but tell Kim I'm sorry. Whatever you gotta tell Kim, tell her yourself. We'll get through this. You just stay with me. We'll get through this. - (Tony) Jack, I'm patching you through. - OK. Roger Summers here. Roger, my partner had to fasten the dispersal device to his wrist. I need to figure out how to disarm the timer or remove the clamp. The clamp's titanium, and it's wired to the tamper-proof mechanism. Fine, then let's disarm the timer. - There's a plate at the end. Open that up. - OK, I see it. Chase, stay with me. Stay with me! I've got the timer. Three minutes 51 seconds, counting down. You should see six wires to the left. Separate them from each other. - OK. Done. - The furthest to the left should be red. Cut it without making contact with the others. You ready? I cut the red wire, but it's still counting down. The timer will stop with the next cut. Locate the green wire. It's in the group to the right. Roger, I don't have a green wire. - What colour wires do you have? - Orange, yellow, black and purple. The devices don't match. Don't panic. And don't cut any wires until we figure this out. Hurry. We're running out of time. - Jack, you need to go. - I'm not going anywhere without you. - Do it. - They're gonna call back. - You have to. - They're gonna call back! It's OK. Man down in the third-floor science lab, northeast corner of the building, requiring medical assistance. Emergency! Now! (door opens) - Could you give us a minute, please? - Sure thing. Come on. What's going on? I'm back in custody. Hammond's taking me down to Federal. No. They can't do this, not after everything you've accomplished today. Michelle, I put your wellbeing above the country's. Nothing anybody can say will ever change that fact. But they can't... they can't put you in prison. Yes, they can. And they will, for a long time, believe me. Tony, don't talk like this. - I can't... I won't give up on you... - Michelle, come on. Please, don't do this. Baby, you're alive. And nobody else got hurt because of what I did. That's more than I hoped for. I can live with that. - Even in prison. - (man) Tony, it's time. - Thank you, Doctor. - Sure. (phone rings) - This is Bauer. - Agent Bauer, please hold for the president. - Jack? - Mr President. I wanted to thank you personally, not only for what you've done today, but for everything. This country continues to owe you a great debt of gratitude. Thank you, sir. I put you in an unimaginable position earlier today when I asked you to take the life of one of your colleagues. Please forgive me for that. Mr President, there's nothing to forgive. It's what had to be done. And it wasn't the only sacrifice made today. I understand. - How's Agent Edmunds doing? - He's in surgery now. It's gonna be a few days before we know whether or not he can use his hand. When he's strong enough to talk, I'd like to thank him personally. He would appreciate that, sir. You know, Jack, men and women like you... your courage and level of commitment humbles me. Thank you. I'll let everyone know at CTU that you appreciated the job they did. And, Jack, there's one more thing. Please don't discuss this with anyone until it becomes public, but I wanted you to hear it from me personally. I've decided not to seek re-election. This will be my only term. I hope you don't mind me saying so, but I think you're making a mistake. Mistake or not, it's what I've decided. When I'm a private citizen, I hope we can become better friends. That would be an honour, sir. Thank you, Jack. Thank you, Mr President. Come. Mr President, the motorcade's ready. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you, Wayne. Right in there. - Dad. - Hey. Is Chase gonna be OK? The doctors are very optimistic. - They got him into surgery very quickly. - Thank God. Come here. I hear you and Chase are gonna make some changes. - I'm very happy for you. - I thought you were gonna be upset. I'm so proud of you. I'm sure whatever choices you make will be the right ones. Thank you, Dad. Thank you. You gonna be OK? Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. There are some things I have to do... but I'm gonna be fine. - Are you gonna wait here for Chase? - Yeah. I've gotta leave for a little while. I'll be back. OK. - I love you. - I love you too, Dad. (man on radio) Jack, you there? Jack? - This is Jack. - I just got a call from District. They've started interrogating Saunders' courier. We could use your help. - Jack? - Y eah. Jack, did you copy?
