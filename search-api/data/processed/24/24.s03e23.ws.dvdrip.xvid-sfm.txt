at the time of Milliken's death. Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle prove otherwise. - What do you want? - Your resignation. Without this, Sherry's got nothing. I can call Foxton and he can make this disappear. You mean steal evidence? I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders. Saunders has Michelle. He wants to trade her for his daughter. Tony, put the gun on the dash! You help me make this trade, I'll turn myself in, go to prison, whatever. We don't have a visual on Saunders. Keep your teams down. Stay down. I can't. Jane! It's OK! Come here! Teams A and B move. Move now! Stephen! I'm pinned down! Saunders has a helicopter. Call in air support now! 11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for. Where are they? It's not gonna be that simple, Jack. This is Jack Bauer. Saunders is in custody. We just got verification. There's 11 vials. How long till you can give us their location? I'm not sure I can. Saunders applied a decryption overlay. Unauthorised access will erase the file structure. I'll keep trying. - Where are the 11 vials? - You're wasting your time. I don't have that information in there. Where are the vials? - In the hands of true believers. - Believers in what? That the greatest threat to world peace comes from this country. There's a hotel near here where 800 innocent people are dead or dying because of you. Were they a threat to world peace? The US must retreat within its own borders. Those people are the first casualties of war. What happened to you, Stephen? I was abandoned by the people I worked for, as you'll be some day. - But my message will be heard in one hour. - What are you talking about? My couriers have been instructed to release the virus at noon. They can't be recalled. Tell us where they are. We'll stop them. That is possible. But only if you agree to my terms. - What are your terms? - I have a private jet at Van Nuys airport. I need to be on it, with a presidential guarantee of safe passage to North Africa. - Never gonna happen. - Then hundreds of thousands will die. I know what you're thinking, but the Bosnian police had two years and couldn't break me. Do you really think you'll be able to do it in less than an hour? Get me on that plane, Jack. You don't have a choice. Bring me Jane Saunders. I'm gonna need your gun, Tony. - Frisk him. - Up against the wall. - Hey! You don't have to do that. - I've got my orders. - He's one of us. - Not any more. - What's going on? - I'm taking him into custody. That's straight from Brad Hammond at Division. I'm sorry, Tony. There's nothing we can do right now. Just take care of business, Jack. I'll be all right. - They said you wanted to see me. - I need you to speak with your father. - What do you want me to say? - Try to make it personal, connect with him. Tell him you're scared, that you don't want him to do this. I'll try. I know what's going to happen... and I know you can stop it. Please. I won't let them use you to manipulate me. Despite everything that's happened... I love you, and I'm asking you, please don't let this happen. This doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense to you because you haven't seen what I've seen. You don't understand. You think what happened to you is the government's fault, and maybe it is. - But the people who'll die are innocent. - And that is tragic, Jane. But it has to happen for things to change, and they must change. How can you do something like this? - I'm doing it for your sake. - For my sake? For you and your children. After it's all over, the world will be a better place. Please, Dad. Please. Please. Don't do this. Jane, I don't expect you to understand now. But one day you will. And you'll look back and you'll thank me for what I've done. Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Jane. Jane! Jane. We're on the move. Get the choppers ready. (phone rings) - Hello? - Sherry, it's David. - Hello, David. - I've been thinking things over. What Keeler offered you. How did you put it? A seat at the table? - Yeah, something like that. - Well, there may be a seat at my table. It's a little too late for that, David. Sherry, I think it's in both our best interests for you to hear what I have to offer. All right. I'm listening. - No, not on the phone. In person. - Where, then? - At Latham Park, the old baseball ground. - I know it. - I'll meet you there in 25 minutes. - That's short notice. But you will be there. - You're in no position to make demands. - Sherry, I have a schedule to keep. If I start changing things, it will attract attention, and neither one of us wants that. All right, David. I'll hear what you have to say. Fine. (phone rings) Yeah. - She should be leaving soon to meet me. - I knew she'd go for it. She's enjoying having me over a barrel. - I could hear it in her voice. - Don't worry about that, David. If we can find this prescription bottle, all her leverage is gone. How long will you need? The more time we have, the better our chance of finding it. I'll do whatever I can to keep her there with me. Wayne... find it. Take a look at your handiwork. You murdered these people. Whole families! Sometimes a fire needs to be lit in order to put out another fire. I don't wanna hear your justification. This is over! You are gonna tell me how to find the rest of the vials now! Or you'll send me inside the hotel? I'm prepared to die for my cause, Jack. Yeah, I know. - Chase. Come in. - Copy that. What are you doing, Jack? - Why did you bring me here? - Ask your father. It's up to him. Dad? Tell me how to find your couriers, or I'll put her in that building. - She has nothing to do with this! - Neither do the people in those body bags. I am gonna do everything I have to to stop you releasing more of this virus. - How could you do this? - I'm gonna give you one chance. No, you're not. - Tell me how I find them. - You know you can't do this, Jack. You are a government agent. Send her in. Take her inside now! No. Dad, stop them! Dad, stop them! Stop it! Dad! Dad, please! No! No! Jane... Everything that happens to your daughter is because of you. Get her out of there, Jack. - Dad, please! - Jack, get her out of there! - Where are the vials? - Get her out of there! How do I find the vials? Let her go! Do as I say now, Jack! When your daughter is infected, I'm gonna make you watch her die. Let her go! Let her go! You're running out of time, Stephen. - Stephen, you're out of time! - Stop! Stop! I'll tell you! Just don't harm her! How do I find the vials? Each one is tagged with a GPS locator chip, so that I can track them right up until the moment they're released. Where are the locator codes? - In my head. - You memorised all 11? Yeah. Get her out of there. Bring Jane out from the tunnel now. Let's go. Jack, we picked up 10 of the 11 GPS signals coming off the vials. - Why are we missing a signal? - I don't know. I gave you the correct codes. Where's the 11th vial? - Los Angeles. - What's the target? He was told to select a public place where maximum casualties would be inflicted. - What's his name? - Arthur Rabens. - I'm assuming that's not his real name. - We need a description. Take him back to holding over at CTU. I want him working with a sketch artist immediately. - What about Jane? - She stays here. - Kaufman. - Adam, it's Jack. I need you to do an all-agency search on the name Arthur Rabens. - Saunders believes it might be an alias. - I'm on it. Has District sent anyone over to replace Tony? Brad Hammond just got here right now. - Let me speak to him. - One second. Mr Hammond, I have Jack Bauer for you on line six. Jack, I've been briefed on CTU activity to this point. We're relaying the coordinates of the 10 vials to local police, NHS and Haz-Mat. - We can't get a signal from the 11th vial. - The 11th vial is in Los Angeles. The courier is Arthur Rabens. Saunders believes that might be an alias. - There's no predetermined target. - Is he telling the truth? Yeah. He thinks we're willing to kill his daughter. - But our best bet is to lock on to that signal. - Everyone in comm is working on it. Brad, I know you took Tony Almeida into custody. But now his wife is safe, he might be a real asset to us. There's not going to be any special treatment. For God's sakes, Brad. Four and a half years ago I was in the same position Tony's been put in today. Drazen kidnapped my wife and daughter. I went outside of CTU to get them back, and no one put me in prison. - The circumstances were different. - And the outcome will be the same. The operation was put at risk because of what he did. This operation started a year ago with Gael, Tony and myself. Gael gave his life, I became an addict just to maintain my cover, and now you're sending Tony to prison? It's wrong, Brad, and you know it. You should put a medal on him, not handcuffs. Jack, you can testify at his hearing. Right now, we've got work to do. - Where's Michelle? - She's here. - Could I talk to her, please? - First things first. Plachecki from the attorney general's office will take your official statement. You're entitled to have a lawyer present. Look, I don't need a lawyer, Brad. I did what I did. What you did, Tony, is punishable by the death penalty. - Death penalty. - What did you expect? - You committed treason. - That was not my intent. You facilitated the escape of a man who was responsible for the death of Ryan Chappelle and almost a thousand civilians, and who was contemplating killing millions of others. You tried to neutralise the only leverage we had by giving him back his daughter. So what's the bottom line? I will testify to the fact that your service record is long and, for the most part, distinguished. With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years. - Sherry should have left by now. - Yeah, well, she's taking her time. So she can make the president wait. (phone rings) - Wayne Palmer. - (Julia) Wayne... - I told you not to call me. - I don't have anyone else. I'm sorry, but I can't help you right now. The police are coming back to arrest me, Wayne, for murdering Alan, because they don't believe that Sherry was here. - I know what happened. - Then why didn't you tell them the truth? My lawyer says that the president is backing Sherry's story. Is it true? Is your brother covering for Sherry? - l... I don't know, Julia. - Don't lie to me. Listen, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you right now. Please, just... don't hang up. I'll call you as soon as I can, I promise. Wayne. I'm so scared. I know. I know. We loved each other once. Help me. - I have to go, Julia. - Wayne... I'm sorry. All right. I'm Chief of Staff to the president and I'm committing a burglary. It's an historic moment. Foxton, Sherry can never know we were here. You do what I say and she won't. Let's get to work. Jack. Tactical feed from San Francisco. They're apprehending Saunders' courier. - He's not breathing. - Sniper took him down with a head shot. Got it. Is the vial intact? Field Ops, I repeat, is the vial intact? Vial appears intact. We 've got it. The vial is intact. We have the vial. One down, ten to go. - Did you check the kitchen? - For the second time. There is nothing there. Well, it looks like Mrs Palmer believes in better living through chemistry, but none of the bottles are Alan Milliken's. - Dammit. - Relax. If she's hidden it here, we'll find it. - How can you be so sure? - Cos she's not a professional, and I am. - Sherry. - David. - Let's take a walk. - Actually, I just wanted to get to the point. What is it that you've decided? I've decided to give you what you want: a place in my administration. That's what you implied over the phone, but I thought I was here so that you could be a little more specific. You will be my de facto right hand, involved in all major decisions. Involved how? On everything from ambassadorial appointments to legislative proposals. You will be one of my primary consultants. - One of your consultants? - Right. - Goodbye, David. - What? Where are you going? Back home, because this conversation is over. - Why? - That's just not good enough. I am not going to be relegated to some informal role so that you can ignore me whenever you choose. - Why don't you just tell me what you want? - I want a permanent position, David. In your administration and in your life. I don't understand. I want to be your wife again. You what? I don't expect to have the kind of physical intimacy that we used to have, although maybe in time that'll come. But I really want to be Mrs David Palmer again, the first lady, right by your side in Washington, wherever you go. Sherry, I don't know what to say. You can start by saying yes... or I walk for good. Are you prepared to have me be your wife again? Yes. Really? Oh, David. Oh, God. We should talk about the details. Work out a timeline, how we expose this to the public. Wait a minute. No, I know you a little better than this, David. Something's not right here. You're making this all too easy. There's something else going on. - I'm giving you what you ask for. - No, no, no, you're not. You're toying with me. And I don't know why and, frankly, I don't care. You... you just consider my offer rescinded. John Keeler will be the next President of the United States. (phone rings) - Yeah? - She's on her way back. We need more time. We haven't found anything yet. I tried to keep her here, but she knew something was wrong. - Wayne, you should leave. - We're not done. She will be there soon. You have no choice. David, hold on. - There's a safe. - We've found a safe in a hidden cellar. - Can you open it in time? - Can you get in? It's an Evans-Stoller, so forget about cracking it. These electronic safes have manufacturer override codes. I have a guy who can get 'em for us. - How long? - As long as it takes to get him on the phone. - David, we may have just found a way. - You'd better. You're running out of time. The suspect used a titanium clamp to secure the device to a railing. We're defusing it. - Wilson, what is your status? - Suspect in custody. Virus is contained. - (phone rings) - Y eah? Seattle, Las Vegas secure. Denver courier taken down making a phone call. Jack, we got the couriers in Las Vegas and Seattle. Saunders' man in Denver was making a phone call. - Did he complete the call? - We don't know. We gotta find that out. (woman) Vial is secure. We are secure. I'm getting a level-two SAT transmission from the LA grid. - Are you sure? What are the coordinates? - Alpha 1733 and Delta 401. That's downtown. Lock in on the SAT feed. Transfer to my screen. OK. (dials number) (phone rings) - This is Jack. - It's Chloe. - What have you got? - Rabens is in Los Angeles. - Where? - On South Flower heading northwest. We got a location. Extrapolate his path and cross-reference it with probable public targets. The most likely match is the California Centre. A mall makes sense. Get units over there to evacuate and secure the area. We're on our way. I just tried to see Tony. Security said you're denying me access. - He's a prisoner, Michelle. - He did what he did to save my life. I'm aware of that. And because of that he's being charged with treason. Treason? I know that he broke protocol by taking Jane Saunders out of CTU, but he would never have given her up. - Because of him, we caught Saunders. - We had Saunders two hours ago. Tony let him escape. No one told you? We had Saunders trapped in a building downtown. We were ready to drop the net, and Tony pulled units out of position so Saunders could get away. - Brad, it was an impossible choice. - No, it wasn't. Tony has a sworn duty to protect the people of this country. Putting your life first was treasonous, and he's going to prison for it. - Brad... - I want you to put yourself in his place. If you would have made the same call, you should resign right now. The target is moving north at 40 miles per hour. How long till we intercept? - About a minute. - How are we doing on the other vials? They got the Flagstaff couriers and two in Washington. Rabens is the last one. Next right. You should be coming up right behind him. I'm turning right onto Flower. The target is less than a block ahead of you. You should have a visual. - There's no vehicles within range. - You sure the target's in the vehicle? Of course. He's travelling 40 miles per hour. Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you. There's no cars in front of us. Recheck your signals. It's not possible. Yes, it is. He's underneath us. Chloe, the target's on the subway. Can you access the MTA's disaster-response system? We can access their control centre. We need to stop the train in the tunnel before it hits the station. Logging onto their system. Has Adam turned up a photo on Rabens yet? No. And Saunders hasn't completed the identity sketch. They're accepting my request to stop the train just short of the station. - Shall I tell MTA to close the station? - Absolutely not. If Rabens notices anything, he might release the virus. I'm gonna need 20 personnel undercover and a backup Haz-Mat team ASAP. We've got men nearby. I'll tell Hammond to order the redeployment. (phone rings) - Foxton. - I've got those codes for the safe. - OK, give me the first one. - 676765B. 676765B. - That didn't work. Got another one? - Come on. - 228767. - (car approaches) Did you hear that? - (car door slams) - It was a car. No. - Sherry's here. - I need you to be quiet. - We need to get the hell out of here. - Quiet! - The next one. - Next one. 35266... - Dammit, Foxton, come on! - Got it. - It's not here. - Dammit. All right, come on. - That's it, let's go. - What? I didn't come this far to leave empty-handed. Wayne. What's going on here? Answer me. What...? Oh. Now I understand why David wanted to meet me. But I am so surprised to find you here doing his dirty work. I've never done anything to hurt you. David put you up to this, didn't he? - Sherry, l... - Answer me. David put... The eyebrows. Change the eyebrows. Attention, passengers. Southbound services are temporarily suspended due to a stalled train. We apologise for any inconvenience. (Chloe) Chase, what's your location? - I'm covering the east side of the tracks. - Copy that. (Jack) Chase, I've got a visual on you coming down the stairs. - Everything in place with the MTA? - They're ready to move the train. - Teams A and B, are you in position? - Roger. We are in position. Rabens' description: mid-30s, white male, dark hair, brown eyes. Nondescript. - Chloe, release the train. - Release the hold on the train. (train hooter) Train doors are opening. - Target is moving off the train. - North or south? - North. - Target is moving north. All teams remain in your zones. Chloe, can you check the altitude on a GPS signal? If I triangulate. - Target is changing altitude. - Target's moving up the stairs. We've got ten remaining white males. Target is now moving west. Team A, split off and maintain pace. (Chloe) Target is now moving south. Target is now descending. (Chase) He's heading to the 7th Street exit. Coming right towards you, Jack. (Chloe) Target is heading south. I've got a visual. Four white remaining males. I want all teams to start closing in. I repeat, all teams start closing in. - What have you got, Chloe? - Target is now moving west. (Chloe) Target has stopped moving. The target has stopped. I have identification on the target. White male at my six o'clock. He's looking at the map. I'm initiating takedown. Drop the bag! Get on the ground, now! Don't move! - What's going on? - Where is it? Where is it? - Where's what? - Chase. What are you guys doing? What's going on? I've got a signal. Wait for Haz-Mat? No, it's either in the vial or we're already contaminated. What is this? (beeping) - Those aren't mine. I don't even... - Shut up! - Son of a bitch. - Just the transmitter. This isn't Rabens. He knows we're onto him. He's still got the vial. Shut the station down now! Julia. - Stay here. I'll be right back. - Where are you going? Just stay here. - Julia, what are you doing here? - The police think I killed Alan. Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut. It's nobody's fault but your own. What are you doing with a gun? You don't wanna do this. I'm going to jail for the rest of my life because of you. - Julia! Julia! - That's not true, Julia. No, Wayne, relax. We're all right here. - You gotta put that gun down. - No! No! She's the one who should be going to jail. My life is ruined. Don't you understand that?! Julia, please, we can... We can work this out. He's right. We can work it out. Shut up. Shut up! You have been lying your entire life. - You are not gonna lie your way out of this. - You're right. But right now, Julia, I am telling you the truth. Now, I will go to David and he will pardon you. I was just with him, just now. I'm gonna be his wife again. He'll do whatever I say. I promise you, you will not spend one day in jail. Isn't that so, Wayne? Julia, listen, you'll have everything you've always wanted. You'll have your freedom, you'll have Alan's estate. You just think about it, sweetie. I promise. You'll be set for life. Good, good. That is real good. That's good. Oh, my God. Sherry... Sherry... I'm so sorry. No! God, no, please. Take up position at the end of the platform. - We've detained everyone in the station. - Did we shut it down in time? - No one's left since the train came in.
