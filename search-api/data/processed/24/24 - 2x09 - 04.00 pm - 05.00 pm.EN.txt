We're holding him at the OC. When the crisis passes l'll let him go. You better come out here. What l find most troubling is that our president knows about this threat and is saying nothing. - Who was controlling that room? - Armus. l want to see him now. Kim, l'm scared! Where are you taking her? She can't go back to LA. l checked you out. Your father does work for CTU. Now you tell me, what did he tell you was gonna happen today in LA? lt's a nuclear bomb. What's my father's connection to all this? He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000 in return for consulting services. Maybe they were doing business. Syed Ali's only business is bankrolling terrorists. l'm a consultant for the ClA. Let's go! (speaks Arabic) (Michelle) Nina, how big is the bomb? What did he tell you? - Everything. - No! We're losing him! - Jack... - Secure her! l know where the bomb is. l was illegally detained inside the president's retreat for the last six hours. That tells you how much he did not want this information come out. No, Karen. - That does me no good. - What am l looking for? Wieland has a source inside of this administration, and l need to know who. - l'm on it. - Fine. Then you get back to me with that. OK. No, l need the information. Good. - What's going on? - You tell me. - What does that mean? - Wieland's been contained for six hours. After you met with him, someone let him out. And you think it was me? Even if l had the resources, which l don't, why in God's name would l want to see Wieland cause a panic, especially today? - l don't know. - David, l had nothing to do with this. l swear on the lives of our children! Mr President... Wait here. You find Armus yet? l wanna know how Wieland got past him. Take a look. What's this? A digital playback from the surveillance feeds at OC. That's Armus. This happened 25 minutes ago. - Armus let him out? - Yeah. - Where is he? - We haven't found him. Mr President, if Armus is working covertly against you... lt's not covert now! lt's in my face! - We will find him, sir. - We'd better. Because whomever he's working for is trying to keep me from finding this bomb! - How long till we go down? - Any minute. The pilots found us a place to crash land. l've gotta get the coordinates to George. - George? - Jack, what's happening? We're going down. The pilots don't know what's going on. lt felt like some kind of explosion. We're losing all kinds of power. They think they can make a safe crash landing on a soft riverbed located in sector J. The coordinates are 34-30-44 north, 119-0-niner-0-5 west. - Did you get that? - Yeah, we got it. Nina, there's a chance we're not gonna make it through this. We need to know the location of the bomb now! We've given you everything you've asked for! Please! Can she hear me? Hold on, l'll put you on speaker. Nina, you got your pardon from the president. What more do you want? Even if l survive this, Jack's gonna kill me. - Phillips is there to protect you. - He can't protect me from Jack! Nina, all l want is the location of the bomb. l give you my word, l will not harm you in any way! l don't believe you! - Where is the bomb? - Rick, holster your weapon! - Do one last good thing with your life! - Phillips, what is going on? Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat! This is the captain. We're not going to make it to the riverbed. Everyone assume crash position and get ready for impact. George, we're going down! We're not gonna make the riverbed. The coordinates l gave you, they're going to be off... (white noise) Get the crash-site coordinates from ATC and send in search and rescue. ATC, this is CTU. l need the exact coordinates. l'll prepare a statement in the next hour. ln the meantime, let's find Armus. Yes, sir. Sherry... l owe you an apology. Why? What did Mike say to you? Richard Armus was the one who let Wieland go. But Armus doesn't have his own agenda. He must be working for someone else. We're looking into it now. l'm sorry l jumped to the wrong conclusion. lt's all right. l don't expect you to change your attitude towards me overnight. Apology accepted. David... What are you gonna do? Talk to the press. l'm not sure how, but l may have to go after Ron's credibility. - Ron's credibility? - Yes. Make it look like his report was motivated by personal dislike, that it's not based in fact. Yes, but it is based in fact. - Believe me, l wish there was another way. - Maybe there is. Why don't you just tell the truth, David? lt's what you do best. l mean, you pulled it off with Keith, with our divorce. You've earned the public's trust. Just use it. What? l'm just wondering if you've really changed, or if you've just gotten better at pretending. - Sir? - Yes, what is it? We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles. The plane Jack Bauer was returning in just went down. lt crashed? We're still waiting for details. Oh, my God! (yells) Rick. Rick! Rick! Myers... l haven't found her. l don't even know if she made it. Find her... l'm gonna find her. You gotta hang in there. Hang in there. Search and rescue will be here any minute. Just hang in there. l'll be right back. Come on, come on. (breathes deeply) These images were taken around the time the pilot reported the explosion. - They were shot down. - By some kind of ground-to-air missile. Compile a list of anybody that might have had access to their flight plan. lf Nina didn't die in the crash, whoever it was will want to finish the job. l have search and rescue scrambling now. Make sure they're well armed. Get me their ETA as soon as you have it. George, Richards told me you had Warner and Naiyeer transferred to room seven. - That's right. - l separated them for a reason. lt's not working, so let's put them together and play them off each other. One minute you're trying to save your own ass, then you act like you give a damn about anybody... - Back off! - No, l'm not gonna back off. Not today. Now, what's going on? Remember the warehouse in Panorama City? Weapons-grade plutonium, airborne in the firefight. - You were exposed? - Yeah. Said l'd be lucky if l made it through tomorrow. l don't know what to say, George. l'm sorry. Me too. Does anybody else know about this? Just Jack. You. Can we keep it that way? Do you need anything? ls there something l can do? Just do you job. Let me do mine. (door opens) So you both claim not to know Syed Ali. - lt's not a claim. lt's the truth. - Sit down. - l'd rather stand. - Sit down! Where the hell do you think you are? Wake up! A cache of weapons-grade plutonium was found in a warehouse in Panorama City! A nuclear weapon was assembled there and it's set to be detonated today. A nuclear bomb? We also found this in the warehouse. What do you make of that, guys? This is a bill of lading from our company. For a container sent to Syed Ali, which means at least one of you is lying right now. l'll let you two work that out between yourselves. Whoever talks first gets immunity. lt's a one-time offer. lt expires in ten minutes. - They're gonna come for us soon. - What's taking them so long? l don't know, but they'll be here. - We're leaving soon. - Where are we going? - Central booking. - LAPD? That's downtown. - l know where it is. - Aw, man. What did l tell you? l don't believe this. Someone from CTU is supposed to pick us up. Can you call George Mason? Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction. Look, you're both suspects in a capital crime. - We told you why we can't go back to LA. - The bomb. - Yes. - l checked it. There's been no departmental alert or elevated threat status. They do not want the entire city to panic at once. Do you think we're making this up? Call CTU. They'll tell you. l'm a cop. l have my orders, OK? l'll sign you two out before l take you back to the city. - l don't believe this. We can't go back to LA. - When my dad finds out, he'll fix things. We shouldn't be counting on your father. No offence, but you were right when you said how messed up he is. Everything l've said about my father is because l was angry and l blamed him for what happened to my mom. - Maybe you were right. - No. No, listen, it wasn't his fault, and he did the best he could. lt just all turned out wrong. No, this is crazy. How can they keep us here without letting us see a lawyer? Huh? - What are we gonna do? - Nothing. Because nothing we say will make any difference. They'll make it look like we're involved. With a nuclear bomb? l've done nothing wrong! This is crazy! l have nothing to hide! - What about you, Bob? - What about me? - You got anything to hide? - Of course not. No. You made the authorisation to Ali. - No, l didn't. - Then who did? Don't interrogate me. That's exactly what they want. Yeah? l'm not asking for them. lf you didn't make the authorisation... Naiyeer's levels are even. Warner's spiking all over. (Reza) They also said... that you work for the ClA. l let the ClA pass information through our distribution network a couple of times. - That's it. - Why didn't you tell me? - Because it is none of your concern! - l think it concerns me now! l think a nuclear bomb pretty much concerns everyone! Don't you? You know what l'm thinking, Bob? l'm thinking that all your generosity and acceptance is just a load of crap. Reza, you better sit down and shut up before you say something you will regret for the rest of your life. You lied to me. l can track the shipping order! Bob's code signature will show that he authorised the transaction order! - Get off of me. - No, just stop it. The database is at the office. l'll take you there. Step outside. - l'm not taking the fall for you, Bob. - Come on. Take it easy. All right, all right. - Hey, where's George? - With Naiyeer. He broke. Could you tell him the search and rescue is about 12 minutes from the crash site? OK. - Tony. - Yeah? - What's going on with George? - As far as what? He's sick, isn't he? He's got some kind of radiation poisoning, doesn't he? Where'd you get that? Hazmat's all over the warehouse he raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot. His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me he was throwing up in the bathroom. And it doesn't take a doctor to figure it out. Besides, l can read your face pretty well by now. Look, he doesn't want anybody else to know, OK? - How bad? - Pretty bad. Can he run things in his condition. - Yeah, l think so. - That's not good enough. lf he's compromised mentally or physically, we can't... He can do his job, Michelle. He wants to do his job like l've never seen. He's determined to stop this bomb. So am l, which is why l think he should step down. l'll keep an eye on him. And the second he misses a step, l'll make sure he backs off. - No, you can't baby-sit him. - l'm not baby-sitting him, Michelle. Now, you gotta trust me on this. Can l see that information as soon as you get it? l made some notes on David's speech. l thought maybe you might want to incorporate them. l haven't even shown that to the president yet. - Jenny showed me a draft. - She shouldn't have. She's known me for a long time, Lynne. She knows what l have to offer. Mrs Palmer, the president believes that you can be an asset to him during this time of crisis. That's why you're here. He did not give you licence to insinuate yourself into... Wait, wait, wait. Put your back down, Lynne. l am not here to trespass on your territory. l am here to help. That's why l'm coming to you first before l go directly to David. Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me. Unless David's speech is pitch-perfect, which it is not, Wieland's allegations might bring down this presidency. l don't need you to tell me how important this is. Then you owe it to David to look at my revisions. Give me your hand. Come on. (man) We got a survivor here. This doesn't look like search and rescue. (gunshot) - Who are they? Are they coming for you? - l don't know! (screaming) Don't even think about it! Keep going! Go, go! Keep going! Keep going! Take cover in the creek bed. There's too many of them for me to handle. l need your help. Give me your hands. l need you to run recon for me and handle the ammunition. You screw with me now, and we both die. Do you understand? Jack, we need to get to higher ground so l can spot for you. Take the ammunition. Go. Go! (male Arabic voice over telephone) (speaks Arabic) (clicks) Would you like some water, Kate? Maybe some tea? - How do you know my name? - l know more than that. l know you are 29 years old, unmarried. l know you have an economics degree from Stanford. Who are you? My name is Syed Ali. You know who l am? l've heard your name mentioned. What else have you heard about me? Nothing. Kate, what have you found in your father's files? You were looking in places you do not belong. You must have seen some things. l don't know what you're talking about. Really? Let go of me! Let go of me! l told you, l don't know what you are talking about. You got the wrong guy. Paul? Oh, my God. What are you doing? He tells us your father works for the ClA. This is not new information. Tell us what you saw and who you told. We didn't tell anyone because we didn't see anything! He's telling you the truth! Please don't do this! Listen to me. Nothing can get in the way of this sacred day. - Tell us what you saw and who you told. - We didn't see anything, l swear! - The files deleted themselves... - Don't lie to me, Kate! - l'm not lying! - She's not lying! They were self-deleting files! We don't know anything! - What are you... - No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Jack, l can spot you from here. l'm set. Where are they? 11 o'clock, 90 metres, moving left. - l'm out! - Last pack, Jack. - Where are they? - Ten o'clock, within 50 metres. That's it! - Where are they now? - Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground. (helicopter overhead) lt's a CTU chopper! They're gonna make a sweep! Stay down! Stay down! (gun cocks) Drop it, Jack. l said drop it! l don't wanna shoot you just yet, but l will if l have to! Drop the gun! Drop it! lt's over! Stand down! Stand down or he's dead! Stand down! She's the only one who can get us to the bomb! l wanna talk to the president! Now! Megan. Megan! - Come here. - Kim! - Are you all right? - Yes. - l'm scared. - l know. - lt's scary, but you're doing so good. - Let's go. Wait. Where are you taking her? Do you know where you're going, baby? Aunt Emily. She's my mom's sister. Do you know where she lives? - Santa Barbara. - Santa Barbara? Santa Barbara. That's so good. - Why can't you come with me? - Oh... Oh, l will soon, OK? - l don't wanna go. - l know. OK, let's go. Your aunt's waiting. Go on, OK? You can go now. Go on. Go on. Don't cry. No, no, shh. l'm gonna see you soon, OK? Santa Barbara, that's like, what, 50 miles outside of LA? - lt's more like a hundred. - Oh, God. She's gonna be OK. - Mr Mason, Tony. - Yeah. Jack's alive. Seven hostiles were killed, but there's a complication. - What? - Nina Myers took Jack hostage. She's demanding to speak to the president. Have Richards and Maccabee take him to Bob Warner's office. - Let me talk to her. - She'll be here when you get back. We were supposed to get married in an hour. Just let me explain everything to her. You have one minute. Watch him. l'm gonna make a call. - What did they do to you? - They just asked me questions. - Everything's fine. - Are you sure? Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer. He's one of the top guys in the city. l'm not gonna need a lawyer. But your father might. l don't understand. Reza, what's going on? lt's your father, Marie. They think that he might have something to do with Syed Ali. My father? - Yeah, he tried to use me. - Used you how? To do business with Ali, who they say is part of this terrorist group. - My father? Part of a terrorist group? - They have proof. They have this transaction that's connecting one of us to Ali. And l know l didn't write it. l'm sorry to put you in this impossible situation. l love you, and l wanna be with you. But right now, something really bad might happen if l don't help them. After everything he's done for you, to turn on my father... He turned on me. He turned on us. What else was l supposed to do? Marie... - Come on, let's go. - Marie. We have a secured line ready. - (rings) - That's Nina Myers. Mike, you should talk to her first. l don't want to give her access to me until she gives us something in return. Miss Myers... this is Mike Novick. l'm the president's Chief of Staff. - l asked to speak with the president. - He's not available. Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not? - Of course we do. - Then put the president on. l'm authorised to negotiate on his behalf. What l want is nonnegotiable. What do you want? l'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity. The president's already granted you a total pardon. Except this is a crime l haven't committed yet. (Mike) What crime? The murder of Jack Bauer. Add that to my pardon, and l'll tell you where the bomb is. And if we don't comply? We don't have a choice. - ls that you, Mr Bauer? - Yes. Please tell the president that he has no other choice but to accept her deal. - ls CTU on a secured line? - Yes. This is George Mason. We're on a designated channel. Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida. Do you have alternatives to what she's asking? Any weaknesses that we can exploit? None. She's a survivor, sir. She knows Bauer. She knows if she doesn't kill him now, he'll hunt her down and find her later. So, in your assessment, Nina Myers is our best chance to stop this bomb? Sir, she may be our only chance. - Ms Myers, this is President Palmer. - l'm listening. - ls Jack Bauer there? - Yes, Mr President. l'm here too. Ms Myers... if the information you provide culminates in the successful interception of the nuclear device, you will get everything you asked for. You will be pardoned in advance for the murder of Jack Bauer. l can live with that. Start talking, Nina. The bomb will be detonated by a man named Syed Ali. We know about Ali. We need to know where he is. He's at a house in Chatsworth, on Starling Court. 18 Starling Court. Contact the local law enforcement to set up a perimeter. Coordinate among the relevant agencies. Ms Myers, you're not to take any action until we put our hands on this bomb. Agreed. - Jack? - Yes, sir. ls there anything you want me to do? Please make sure that my daughter is safe, sir. - Tell her that l love her. - l'll do that. Thank you, Mr President. - Jack? - Mr President... Please, you don't need to say anything, sir. There was only one right choice to make, and you made it. - l'm sorry, Jack. - (hangs up) He's right, Mr President. lt's the only way we're going to find this nuclear device... before it's too late. Sir... The press corps is waiting. - You've made some changes. - Yes, sir. - lt's better. - Thank you, sir. For God's sake, stop it! What do you want? l don't know what you want! Yes, you do. We didn't see anything. We didn't tell anyone anything! l swear! l don't know anything! How can l tell you what l don't know? l believe you. lf she knew anything, she would have told us. Kill her. (all chattering) lt won't take them long to find Ali. This isn't how you thought it would end, is it, Jack?
