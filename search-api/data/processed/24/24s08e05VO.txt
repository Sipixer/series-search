I need to know about my brother. He's alive. Get out now. It can't be long before they realize it's you.</i> I need you to get back in the car. Your brother was involved with the attack. He's the insider we've been looking for. - What's going on? - The body triggered a hazmat alarm. - It's highly enriched uranium. - It's weapons-grade? - How did he come into contact? - I think I know the answer. Someone approached my brother with weapons-grade uranium. Who? Someone who had access to decommissioned soviet stockpile. You must find the russians before they can get the uranium to my brother. I want proof that the rods exist, - or you will not be paid. - You want proof? Come with me. My younger son, he was transporting the rods, and he was careless. There, you have your proof. You were undercover for nearly two years with the russian mob. - Your cover is still intact. - Are you asking me to go back in? She hasn't been undercover for over six years. You're making a mistake by putting her in. You must have other options. - She's our only way in. - Then I want to go with her. I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy? I'll act as a buyer. I'm looking for Vladimir. Vlad disappeared. But you can find him. They know where I am 24/7. I'm still in prison. Parole bracelet? I can get this off. - You can't cut bracelet. - I'm not gonna cut it. What the hell have you done?! That's it, this is over. Maybe for you, but I'm just getting started. I thought you were dead. Where have you been? It took me this long to get clear. I'm with Bazhaev. To hell with Bazhaev! All we have worked for, it's all over because of him. It's not over, general. Of course it is! Your brother is still alive, and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished. Now his security forces are rounding up our people all over the city. General Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago, in front of his wife and children. Look, the americans won't let him continue. They'll accuse him of human rights violations and threaten to pull out of the peace talks. Once we have the uranium, my brother will become irrelevant anyway. You are being hunted like an animal. - How do you expect to get the uranium? - Bazhaev can deliver it to us, but first I need payment wired to his account. - It's all right. - Thank you. Papa, there's a clinic in Mt. Vernon. I found a doctor who can treat him. We have been through this. - No doctors. - Yes, but this one has a family. I know where they are, I know their names. I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut. And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out? Another doctor, a nurse, no one? The authorities know about the nuclear material or they will soon enough, and they'll be looking everywhere. Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us. He's going to die if we don't get him help. Then he's going to die. But alone like this? In a cold room behind the kitchen? He's my brother, papa, and he's your son. All right. Take him to the country house. Ulana will look after him. Thank you, papa. - What is it? - Farhad is asking for you. You have news for me? The money will be transferred to your account shortly. When can I take possession of the rods? As soon as we have the money. Five hours. Good. I'll help you pass the time. You have a preference? Then take both. He's still bleeding out. This should cauterize the wound. It's working. - Who are you calling? Why? - Hastings. I'm shutting this operation down. You shouldn't be in the field. This was the only play. You'd have done the same thing. - The play was to get him to cooperate. - He will cooperate. - How do you figure? - I know these guys. The only thing that Ziya likes more than 13-year-old girls is money. He'd have butchered himself for a score like this. - Hastings needs to know the truth. - The truth? That you're unstable! I don't blame you, after everything you've been through, but you are not fit for this mission. I went through a rough patch, yeah, but I came out on the other side. And I don't think you have. The bottom line is, I'm the best chance that anyone has of intercepting that uranium, I can do it now. So, you making that phone call or what? He's waking up. Better make up your mind. Fine. You see what you can get out of him. But don't forget, I'm listening. Shut up, Ziya. - You'll get painkillers soon - What did you do?! I got the bracelet off, I did you a favor. - You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb! - What's done is done. You can either stay here and whine like a baby, or you can come with me and be a rich man. I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top. It's a lot of money, Ziya. - How much? - Two-and-a-half million. Maybe three when it's all done. Two million? You're serious? You tell me. I take this deal to Vladimir, it's not real, you know what happens?! Why would I be here if this wasn't real? Fine, forget it. I'll find Vladimir my own way. No, wait! I don't know where he is exactly, but where he might be. Tell me. No, I'll take you there myself. - You have a car? - I have truck. It's parked out back. All right, I'll drive. Come on! I found out in my background check that Ziya has a probation officer. - How do you want to handle this? - You don't need to. - He has a tracking bracelet. - Not anymore. I don't understand. They have anti-tamper mechanisms. You can't cut them off without triggering an alarm. Trust me, it's been taken care of. Jack, what happened in there? Renee got the result she wanted. Ziya's taking her to Vladimir. Dana's still working on your cover profile. - They're moving. - I'll call you when it's ready. Jack's waiting on the rest of that profile. I'm still working the timeline. Tell him I'm almost finished. Okay. You get that? Yeah, probably should. Hello? I'm in the middle of something. Hold on a second. I'll send that profile to you when I'm done. I told you not to call. I know what you told me. But now that I'm here, I just can't help but miss you. My shift is over in the morning. I will see you then. That's just not going to work now, is it? I'm busy, Kevin. Turn on the news if you don't believe me. That's not my problem. I need to see you. - You have 15 minutes. - That's not possible. Okay, you got 30. Who said I can't be reasonable? Don't make me call your little boyfriend. Rock his perfect little world. "Hey, pal, congratulations. "By the way, her name's not Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott. "Did I mention that she's an ex-con? Nothing too serious. "Just accessory to murder is all." You still there? I'm here. See you soon. - Can I ask you something? - Yes, I'm available Saturday night, and I can change my plans for Friday if you want. Also, I'm free on Thursday. Arlo, I'm sorry. A situation's come up, and I have to go home. We're in a major protocol. I know, and I won't be long, I promise. But I need you to cover for me. Finish the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer. If I ask what this is about... - None of your business. - Right. I thought so. Send it to Chloe when you're finished. Okay. Thank you, Arlo. I owe you one. One what? Thank you, Mr. Prime minister. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I've spoken to 12 heads of state. They're concerned, but they're all still planning to attend the signing ceremony. I've got some bad news. Killing president Hassan was only part of his brother's plan. CTU believes he's trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium. From whom? A russian crime syndicate in New York. Half of them are ex-soviet army or KGB. If anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles... It's what we've been afraid of since the wall came down. Is president Hassan is aware? He's the one who told CTU about it. Hastings has initiated an undercover operation to recover the uranium before it's leave the country. The nuclear materials are here on US soil? - Are they sure? - Afraid so. Ethan, you asked if president Hassan was aware of this. Why? Helps explain what's been going on in the islamic republic. I just spoke with our ambassador in the IRK. Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations. Has he declared martial law? Not officially, but effectively, that's exactly what he's been doing. Who can blame him? His brother is not alone. We want Hassan cracking down on hardliners in his own government. Except that he's defying his country's laws, as well as his international human rights obligations. And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord. Is president Hassan back yet from CTU? - He'll be here in 10 minutes. - I want to speak to him. Alone. I'll take care of it. That's enough. What's your problem? I need you thinking clearly. You tell me you'd get me real painkiller. Put it away. I'm surprised. I'm surprised you take deal to him again. After what he did to you. How much further? You don't want to talk about Vladimir. It's okay. I don't blame you. After all, what is there to say about such a man? Nothing good. - Nothing very... - Just tell me how much further. Ten minute. Touchy, touchy. Arlo just locked your cover profile. I'm uplinking it to you. Hold on one sec. Okay, I got it. You're taking me out of Renee's comm when you call? Go into her undercover file with regards to Vladimir Laitanan. I need to know what happened between them. - I'll call you right back. - Okay, thanks. Mr. President. Your chief of staff said it was urgent. It is, but first, I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right. If this is about my security forces and the necessary steps I'm taking back home, I'm afraid I can't help you. Are you so sure they're necessary? What happened today was nothing short of a coup. These same people are trying to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program. I understand, but... I don't think you do. Yours is an open society, madam president, governed by the rule of law. Mine is closed. The only real law is power. Any perceived weakness on my part, and I'm finished. I'm aware of the complexities of your situation, Mr. President. My brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government. Those elements must now be purged. Purged? You mean, executed? It is the only thing my people understand. I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President, if you renege on your human rights obligations. The world is trusting you because I trust you. You're asking me to show mercy to enemies who are trying to destroy me. I am asking you to find a middle way, in the name of bringing peace to a region that hasn't known peace for generations. I need to see my family now. - I found a doctor. - A doctor? Someone who can help you, someone we can control, but papa says it's too risky. Papa's right. Condemning you to death? I don't believe that. What happened... was my own fault. The family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake. All these years, I thought it was an act. But you really are the good son, aren't you? I'm no better or worse than you, Josef. You're my older brother. You've always looked out for me. What are you doing? - I'm taking you to the doctor. - But papa said we can't. I don't care what papa said! I'm not letting you die without a fight. You are old enough to make your own decisions. I've decided to stay. As you wish. You should stay, too. I can't. - Why not? - You think that your father is one way, but he's not what you think. Stop doing that. - You always do that. - What? Imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean. It is better that way, Kayla, believe me. I don't want to poison you against your father. There. You're doing it again. - You can't help yourself. - Doing what again? Father! - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - We thought that... - I know. I need to speak to your mother now alone. We have nothing to say to each other. Please. Do you love her? It's over. I ended it. You didn't answer the question. Be honest for once. Show me a little respect. I'm your wife, damn it. Do you love her? Maybe I thought I did. Then say it. Does it matter? It matters to me. The truth is... ... I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything. And that's my fault somehow? How dare you! Our fault. There's enough blame to go around. - Dalia, please don't go. - What? I don't want you to leave. Don't worry. I won't make a scene. You should know me better than that by now. My brother's a traitor. My highest officers are conspiring against me. And now president Taylor is threatening to pull out of the peace talks. It has been a long time since you've asked my advice about anything. You were the one who always gave me the best counsel. Thank you for remembering that. Then you'll stay? It's too late for that, Omar. Too much has happened between us. I'm sorry. Vlad operates out of here? Sometimes. He moved a lot. That's why cops don't find him inside here.</i> - <i>Come on, let's go.</i> - <i>Hey, Ziya?</i> Vladimir was never fond of surprises, so I was thinking... Maybe you could go in first? Get him used to the idea of me again. Whet his appetite? Exactly. Is our cover in place? Chloe got me everything. Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City. How we met, who we dealt with. Tell me about Vladimir. - What do you want to know? - What he did. I heard Ziya. Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen. Damn it, I am running this! Stop messing with me! I'm responsible for your safety. When I ask you a straight question, answer straight. It was nothing, all right? I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today. I only worry about locking down this cover, so, please, let's not waste more time on Vladimir.</i> I'm a Munich-based arms dealer named Ernst Meier. We met in Mexico City. You became my liaison to the locals. Lugo. Long time. It's me, Ziya. I know who you are. What the hell are you doing here? Business. - Business? - Yeah. With Vladimir. You've got business with me? Vlad! I should kill you for even thinking of coming here. Let me go, please! Five years... I've been living underground five years and now you walk in here? You're on probation! No. Not anymore, Vlad. Look. She get bracelet off. Who did? It's what I'm trying to tell you. Renee. Renee Zadan. She come to my place looking for you. Yeah, she say she have buyer that you'd want to hear about. That it'd be good for all of us. It'd be worth it for all of us. She say where she'd been these last five years? Where everybody else was. In jail. Then she go to Mexico City. She got the opportunity there. Mexico city? What do you think, Lugo? You believe this piece of dirt? Sure I believe him. He's too stupid to make up a story like that. It's her I don't believe. I never did. I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her. She's not the one who sold us out. She shows up out of the blue, then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats. I'm just saying, Vlad. You were just saying. - Where's Renee now? - Outside. Clean yourself up. Bring her to me. - Where's Dana? She isn't at her desk. - She went home. Home? - Who is it? - It's me. You have my key. Nice of you to drop by. It's not funny. What the hell? Who's he? That's Nick. It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont. Get him out of here. You know I can't do that, Jen. I already told him he could stay. It'd be impolite. Here. What's this? It's $500. It's all I could get out of the cash machine. I'll get you another 500 in the morning. You think you're smart, and the whole world's stupid. That's just not how it is, Jen. I don't think you're stupid. No? But you think you can buy me off with $1,000? I'm not trying to buy you off. What do you want from me? You know what I want? What I really want is for you to stop treating me like a dumbass, 19-year-old stickup artist with a fast car! You're not the only one who's grown up. Easy, Kevin, easy. I've been waiting for this moment. Dreaming about it. You owe me. If you think that I testified against you, I didn't. Don't lie to me! I'm not lying to you! I got out of jail before you did, only because I went in as a minor. No other reason. The truth is, it doesn't change things, one way or another. See, I've done my homework. I know what your job is. I'm a data analyst, nothing more. Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU. You got access to all sorts of good stuff... Bank codes, port authority manifests, stock exchange. Access, yeah, but not unrestricted access. You'll figure something out. You always do. But whatever it is, the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay? Please, Kevin. Here's the deal. You do this one thing for me, and I'm gone. I'll never bother you again. I can't. You can. And you will. We've been living and operating out of a hotel called Bella Noche on avenida Juarez. - Can't they check that? - <i>It's a safe haven</i> for high-end criminal activity. They don't keep records. - Have you got the name? - Bella Noche. I got it. I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details. Listen to my voice. I'll get you all the information you need. He's coming. Come on. Let's go. It's not pretty. She had a problem on her hands. Talk to me. According to the responsible agent, Vladimir Laitanan was obsessed with her. It turned violent. - How violent? - Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone. Two trips to the emergency room. Did he rape her? Not according to these files, but he tried a couple of times. Did she say anything about this to you or Hastings? What's this about, Jack? The FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could. But after she left the Bureau, Renee went into a tailspin. She tried to kill herself at least once that I know about. She says she's past it, but she's not. I can see it in her eyes. You think she's putting herself in harm's way? I don't think she cares what happens to her either way.</i> - <i>Where is she now? - She's going in. I'm going to put you on speaker. Hands up. Turn around. Go. Hello, Vlad. You changed your face. I had it done in Caracas. What do you think? Makes you look younger. I should get the name of that doctor.</i> He's not practicing anymore. A sad story. Our little friend here says you were in Mexico City. For what? Had some business. Good. I've some contacts there myself. I know you do. Give me names. The Peralta-Rodriguez family. The Peralta-Rodriguez family. Castorenas in Guadalajara. - Ramon Jimenez. - I know Ramon. Is his brother Luiz still running their heroin operations? He was killed nine months ago by the federales.</i> Not since he was killed by the federales nine months ago. You know, Renee, now that you mention it, there is something different about you too. How do you mean? Your eyes. Your skin. You look like hell. Well, it's hard to look your best with a gun in your face. No, that's not it. Something else. Have you been sick? Maybe... you picked up a little hepatitis C on your travels? Where were you staying in Mexico City? The Bella. Bella Noche hotel. Bella Noche, naturally. You must know the government official who allows it to operate without police interference. The hotel in Mexico City, was there a politician on the take? - I don't have it. - Neither do I. - Checking DEA database. - Come on. - Give me a minute. - She doesn't have a minute. Waiting for a name! Go ahead, tell him. Really getting tired of this, Vlad. His name! Got it... Raul Castillo. Castillo, Raul Castillo. Raul Castillo, all right? Are we done playing 20 questions now? Yes, I believe we are. You know, I had almost forgotten how much fun you are. You're not like other women. You have balls. You always did say the nicest things. Can we talk about this deal now? I wish it were that simple. Tie her up. What? What are you doing? You're not telling the truth. You're making a mistake. This is the chance of a lifetime. Him, too. Vlad, wait. Put them in the trunk. Please don't do this! Listen to me! She come to me! She come to my place, the bitch! I swear! I don't know anything about this! What's happened? They put her in the trunk, I lost audio. Boosting the signal now. Try it again. Renee, can you hear me? Say something. - I don't have her. - <i>The car must be armored.</i> Either that or her comm shorted out. Are you seeing this? I am. I'm following north through an alley towards woodward. I think this operation just blew up. Are you planning to intercept? The car is armored. I'll need tactical support. I'm alerting Hastings to scramble a team now. Tell him I see four men in the car, we're going to have to assume they'll kill her. - <i>Copy that.</i> - Damn it! Don't work too late, hon. Call me when you're on the road.</i> Will do. Dr. Levine. How did you get in here? My brother is sick. I'm not seeing patients right now. He needs your help. I'll call an ambulance. No one else can know about this. My men are outside your house in New Rochelle. I don't believe you. I just spoke to my wife. We're outside the gate. The address is 1614 Brook Street. The light in your daughter's room went out about ten minutes ago, so I want you to put the phone down you're not going to try to warn anybody about this. Do you understand? I understand. My brother has radiation poisoning. He needs treatment. His symptoms seem quite advanced. I'm not sure what it is, I can do for him. You'd better be able to do something, for your family's sake. I need to know what kind of materials he came in contact with. It was uranium. Do you know what isotope? Weapons-grade 235. Jack, this is Hastings. Tac teams are three minutes away. All of them aware that Renee is in the trunk? The instructions are to engage only on my command. Any indication where they're taking her? Any percentage in letting this play out? As soon as she's out of the vehicle, she becomes more vulnerable. If we engage now, it means ending the operation. This operation's over. Vladimir didn't take the bait. Target just turned south on flushing. Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE in 2.6 miles. If we don't engage on these surface streets, we lose our tactical advantage. Chloe, get me an ETA. Intercept in... Two minutes, ten seconds. Sir, you need to make the call now. All right, I'm authorizing engagement. Stand by for intercept protocols. This is good. Pull over. Open it. - Take them out of the trunk. - Lugo, please, you tell Vladimir... I've got a signal again. Something's wrong... They sound stopped, but the vehicle I'm following is going south on flushing. - She told me to come to you! - Shut up. It won't do any good. Confirming that, the target is still moving. A decoy. They must have left in another vehicle. Find it! Pulling up a satellite footage. All right, tac teams, hold your positions, stand by. Another car drove out of the building five minutes after the first one. Are you kidding me? - Sorry, we were focusing on the follow. - Just tell me where they are! Take them down to the water. I've got a GPS lock on Renee. They're pulled off at Newtown Creek, just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge. - The tac teams? -<i> I'm redirecting them.</i> - How far out? - Ten minutes. Tell them to move it. Put me back on to Renee's comm. Damn it! I know you can hear me. Vladimir had us following a decoy. Tac teams are ten minutes out. I'm on my way now.</i> Do whatever you have to to buy time. On your knees, both of you. Please listen to me, - I don't know anything. - Shut your mouth. I'm going to give you one last chance to tell me... what is going on. I swear on my life, she come to my place. I don't know anything. Amazing. You didn't even blink. Go ahead. Just get it over with. Renee, what the hell are you doing? Not yet. For God's sake, don't make me grovel. Pull the damn trigger. First I want to hear the truth. I want to know who you really are. Who I really am? Who you are, not a game, Renee... Or whatever your name is. Fine, you want the truth? I'll tell you the truth. You were right. You were right, I am sick. I am so sick of living like this. The truth is... Even if you let me walk right now... I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.</i> You don't want to do this deal, fine. Then you might as well kill me because this deal is the only thing that I have. Renee, please don't do this, please. Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything that I haven't already tried myself. Do it. Do it! Pull the trigger! I had to be sure. You understand, right? Good. Dump him in the river. Tac teams are almost there. I need a status update.</i> Jack, are you there? Do you copy?</i> You tell the tac teams to stand down.
