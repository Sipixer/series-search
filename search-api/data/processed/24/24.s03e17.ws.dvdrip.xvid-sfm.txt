- My assignment was the hotel. - So there are others? - Yes. 11. Alvers planted a vial in the ventilation system. It went off as Gael tried to disarm it. No one can leave the building. We have to impose a quarantine. If people realise what's going on, there'll be panic. - (man) They're lying. - It's inside! (Phillips) Keep away from the doors. (screaming) - If you try to leave, I will shoot you. - (whispers) No, you won't. (screaming) - He knows who you are, Jack. - Who knows who I am? "Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer." That's what he said. Go up against him, you're a dead man. - Bauer. - (Saunders) Hello, Jack. I knew you were better than Amador, but you're not better than me. I need you to put me in touch with a... friend of yours. Mr President, the man in possession of the virus demands to speak with you. (Saunders) You are no longer in control ofyour country. And if you do not use the full power of your office to execute my wishes, the virus will be released. And it be impossible to stop. Everybody. Stay calm. Stay calm and quiet. - Look! Outside! - (screaming and panic) Move in! Move in! (screaming) I want to make one thing clear right now. No one leaves this building until further notice. In a moment, I will get on the intercom and explain why. I need absolute quiet and absolute cooperation. - It reaches the entire hotel? - Yes. (coughing) This is Federal Agent Michelle Dessler. In order to survive what's happened, you will need to listen carefully and follow my instructions. As most of you already know, an infectious substance has been released in the building and the hotel has been quarantined. Anyone attempting to leave will be stopped by any means necessary. If you are in your room, stay there. If you are anywhere else, return to your room immediately. Medical assistance will arrive shortly and be given to anyone who requires it. The first priority is to go back to your room and stay there. Thank you. You heard the announcement. Let's make our way back to the elevators. The elevators are back in operation. This way, people, in an orderly fashion. God. Danny? Oh! No! It's OK. Who did this? Who killed him? You? You're a federal agent. You were supposed to protect him. Get your hands off me. I am sorry, but this will just make things worse. - You were supposed to protect him. - (man) It's OK. Come on. Yeah, this is Bauer. (woman) Agent Bauer, please hold for the president. - Jack. - Mr President. The man I spoke to, the one who controls this virus. Why did he use you to get to me? I wish I could answer that. He says he knows me, but we haven't ascertained a positive identification. The only thing I can tell you for certain is that within the last hour he was in Los Angeles. He made it clear he intends to use the threat of this virus to control me, and, through me, the entire government. Obviously, we cannot let that happen. - I understand, sir. - Find him, Jack. We're doing everything we can. I'll keep in touch. Thank you. With Amador dead, we got two leads left. First, whoever this guy is says he knows me. - Second, he knows Alvers. - The guy who planted the virus at the hotel. Right. Call Tony. Tell him to get Alvers to give us a physical description, detailed. Then I want it crosschecked with personnel in my service file. - Bauer says he doesn't know this man. - But he knows Bauer. - Apparently. - How is that possible? I don't know. All I know is they're doing everything they can to find him. Did he give any indication of what he wants? No. But he controls enough of the virus to wipe out a significant portion of the population. So, whatever he wants, we don't have much choice but to give it to him. At least for now. - Make sure all the exits are sealed off. - I checked a few minutes ago. Well, check again. You don't have to keep me busy, Agent Dessler. I'm not gonna panic. I know you won't. I appreciate all the help you've given me. I'd just like to know the truth. Um... Is everyone in this hotel gonna die? Not everyone. A few will be immune to the virus. But most of us... - What are the chances of survival? - I don't know. I'll let you know as soon as I do. Thank you. (phone rings) - Dessler. - Hey, it's me. The perimeter's set. Things are under control, but a panic's still possible as more people show symptoms. We have to be ready for that since the incubation period is shorter than we thought. How you doing? I... I'm fine. So far. I just... What? Things got crazy. I had to shoot a man. He was trying to get out of the hotel. He's dead. Michelle, you did what you had to do, the only thing you could have done. - You need to stay focused, all right? - I know. I am. There's something we need you to do. Find out if Alvers ever saw the man that hired him. We need a description as detailed as possible. I'm on it. I'll call you right back. (man) Medical assistance just got here. We're gonna really need your help now. (Duncan) Come on, everybody. Move it. (male agent) Ma'am, bring her up. - I'm bleeding. - You don't look too bad so far. We had a deal. I told you what I knew, you'd kill me when I started showing symptoms. - You haven't told us everything you know. - What are you talking about? The man you work for. What's his name? He never told me his name. I'm dying. I have nothing to gain by lying about it. When was the last time you saw him? Three hours ago, at a go parlour in Chinatown. - Tony. I'm with Alvers. - We're ready. Go ahead. I want a description. Mid-thirties. Caucasian. Uh... About six one. Black hair, brown eyes. Lean, no facial hair. - He... He speaks with a British accent. - You get that? - We got it. How long will this take? - Once the parameters are in, not long. I need to cross-reference it with personnel Jack has worked with. (Tony) All right, Jack. We're uploading photos of suspects. You should have a visual. (Jack) Copy that. (Alvers) No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. - He's not there. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. - Tony? Yeah, I heard. We'll have to widen the search parameters. The accent might be a mislead. Maybe he's not British. If we drop that parameter, the database will increase by a factor of 50. That's 750 possibilities. A fair amount of those are missing visuals. In other words, no head shots. - Tony. - Yeah, Jack? What are the parameters, outside of accent and appearance? As wide as we can make 'em. All living males... - Change that. - Change "living"? - Yeah, change it to "presumed dead". - Copy that. (Alvers) No. No. No. No. No. - There. That's him. - Tony. Tony. That's him. - (Tony) Jack, you know this guy? - My God. - Jack? - I know him. His name is Stephen Saunders. British lntelligence lent him to CTU for a mission in Kosovo. - The one that targeted Victor Drazen. - Yeah. I was the only one to get out. Five died, including Saunders. At least, that's what I thought. I was obviously wrong. Tony, I'll get back to you. I need a minute to think this through. Jack. Hurry. Son of a bitch. The hotel seems to be under control. SWAT's in place. NHS is there and will start the testing procedure soon. - Any sense the press has picked up on this? - Not so far, but they're bound to before long. Containing the virus is crucial, but containing the story is just as important. If this story breaks, we need a plausible cover. - I'll work up some scenarios. - Don't use the term "Cordilla virus". People have never heard of it and the unknown creates fear. Say it's similar to legionnaire's. People are familiar with that. - And they know it was handled successfully. - OK. - Mr O'Laughlin. - Mr President. - Please. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr Palmer. 11 vials are unaccounted for. What's Homeland Security's assessment? - The threat level should be raised to "Red". - Do it. What about domestic air travel? It is our suggestion that flights be grounded and airports closed. If your concern is to avoid panic, stopping air traffic might have the opposite effect. Better than widespread release of the virus. If you shut down airports, you can't explain it with legionnaire's. We're talking about security issues. We are not talking about public relations. How the public relates to this is a security issue. We also advocate shutting down interstate rail and bus traffic in the interest of... Whoever has these vials could already be in their cars. - We can't shut down every highway... - Mr President... Gentlemen. Alert the airlines to a possible shutdown. But wait for my authorisation. Yes, sir. (phone rings) - Yes. - (woman) Mr President, call on one. One moment, please. Thank you, Mr O'Laughlin. Thank you, Mr President. It's him. OK, guys, here we go. Start the trace. - Put the call through, please. - Yes, sir, right away. - (Saunders) Mr President? - Yes? It's time for your first assignment. A simple one, but one necessary to our future relationship. - We don't have a relationship. - No. You don't negotiate with terrorists. Well, I don't negotiate with heads of state, so just do as you're told. Across the street from your building is a mailbox. Have the Secret Service open it. Inside is a package wrapped in black paper. Have them bring it to you within ten minutes. - I'm not doing anything until you tell me... - (dial tone) He didn't stay on long enough. Probably knew we were going to try and trace the call. - Send Secret Service to get the package. - All right, but it'll have to be screened for explosives, the virus... Then do it. Just make sure it's back here in ten minutes. All right. His file's inactive. There's no evidence he surfaced after Kosovo. So, for six years he's let everyone think he's dead. I don't think so. If he survived, he'd have been captured and sent to prison. If the mission failed, maybe he was why. Betrayed the team and pretended to be killed. You don't know Saunders. He was a patriot. Something else happened to him. - Who are you calling? - Ml6. (man) Operations. This is Jack Bauer, I need to speak with Trevor Tomlinson, please. (phone rings) Hello, Jack. Has CTU brought you up to speed on Saunders? We've got his file up now. There's no indication he's still alive. Trust me, he is. You'll want to do a forensic protocol search. - Being done as we speak. - Would London have any additional data? On something like this? No, it's local. One more thing. He'll want to deal with people he knows and trusts. See if you can do a search on all his past contacts. Great. Most of them have gone dark, or they're confirmed dead. Oh, here's something. A name. Diana White. Ran a high-class escort service in Los Angeles in the late '80s. Catered to diplomats, embassy employees, that sort of thing. She passed intel to Saunders and they became close. - They lived together for a while. - Is she still in Los Angeles? Yes, but she's been inactive in intelligence circles for some time. Patch her file and every piece of information you've got through to my computer. Thanks. I'd like to begin testing hotel staff. But it would really help if you would go first. - All right. - OK. - (woman) Name, please? - Michelle Dessler, CTU. There you go. We're set. It's a nasal swab. As reliable as a blood test, but it can be analysed much more quickly. - How quickly? - We should have the results in two hours. Thank you. Next. - (man) In there. - (Duncan) Over here, sir. Sir, step over here. It's all right, sir. There's nothing to be worried about. It's a simple nasal swab. This phone is what was in the package from Stephen Saunders. We scanned it. It's clean. Unfortunately, Mr President, it's built with what's called a subchannel chip, designed to receive a specific signal that can't be traced. - I understand. Thank you, Aaron. - Yes, sir. So this is how he intends to communicate now. - And if we can't trace the call... - We can't find him. (phone rings) Yes. Good. You're using your new phone. Consider it our private line. And, as you've no doubt been informed, don't bother trying to trace my calls. What do you want? - Within half an hour hold a press conference. - About what? The space programme. The price of wheat. It's entirely up to you. But at some point, you will use the phrase "The sky is falling". Use it however you like, Mr President... but use it. He wants a press conference. About what, it doesn't matter. Just say, "The sky is falling". It's a signal of some sort. Maybe for an attack, maybe for a wave of attacks. Maybe it's just to show he's in control. Either way, you can't give him that kind of power. - You saw what that virus does. - I read the file, yeah. A thousand people are dying as we speak. Not just in a file, but in real life, right here in LA. I realise that, but... If I don't do what this man says, it will be millions. It could buy some time. Maybe CTU can find this maniac before things get out of hand. Call a press conference. - (man) She's there. - I'll let him know. Diana White is at home. - Have we got anything new on her? - Just the list of her clientele. Dignitaries, heads of state, even a member of the Vatican. Net worth, 20 million. Her relationship with Saunders makes sense. She names her clients, he blackmails them by threatening to reveal them. - Think that's how he financed his operation? - I think it's how he financed part of it. You knew Saunders. You said he was a good soldier. What do you think happened? To be honest, I don't know. I still can't believe he survived the blast in Bosnia. They must have captured him, otherwise he would have resurfaced. They would have put him in prison, tortured him for God knows how many years. Now he's holding our government responsible. - But he was a British agent. - He was on loan to us. - It was a US operation. - Oh. We left him behind. I left him behind. You were studying this virus, even before it surfaced. - (man) This isn't the same strain. - Maybe not the same, but related, right? You must have worked on a cure or vaccine or something. Any research we have is based on... I got a hotel full of people dying. One of them's my wife. - So don't tell me there's nothing you can do. - I wish there was. I'm sorry. NHS. What did they say? Anyone infected... It's a hundred per cent mortality rate. You know today? When Michelle told Chappelle that I should stand down because of my wound, I barely even spoke to her. Tony, I can't tell you that I know what you're going through, cos I don't. - But if you need anything, I'm here. - Kim. Would you excuse us? - Of course. Here's the file. - (Tony) Thanks. Have you cleared those files with Division? No, I didn't get to it yet. I had to take care of something. I know what you were doing, Tony. You were calling about Michelle. - She's my wife. - I understand that, but we're short-handed. We can't afford... - I know how to do my job. - You're not doing it. You have to move on. "Move on"? - What, you're acting like she's already dead? - Yes. I am. And so should you. We're at war, Tony. I need your full attention. If you can't give it to me, go home, or maintain a vigil at the hotel. But if you stay here I need you to focus, and the best way to do that is to assume the worst and make it about getting revenge. Now, what's it going to be? Are you staying or not? What do you need? I'm hunting for bank accounts Amador used over the past few months, on the computer we confiscated at the go club. If I find something, maybe we can follow the money trail back to this Stephen Saunders. - This offshore or domestic? - Both. Anything suspicious, I'll stream it to you. Coordinate with Division on a substrata overlay. All right. You got it. - Thanks, Tony. - Yeah. - Don't fire! I'm a federal agent. - So what? You're in my house. Don't shoot. I just want to show you my identification. - What do you want? - I need to talk about Stephen Saunders. Bastard. Put that gun down! You first. OK. I'm going to put my gun down. Just take it easy. - Step out from behind there. - OK. I'm coming out. Just take it easy. Just stay calm. I just want to talk to you. Now we can talk. Do you mind if I get dressed first? Go ahead. Tell me about you and Saunders. Stephen always told me he'd protect me. I was young and stupid and I believed him. When the work turned ugly, he left me hanging. - What kind of work? - (exasperated sigh) It's a figure of speech. We know you acquired intelligence for Saunders. I provided a service for wealthy men. How long do you think it would've lasted if I'd betrayed confidences? - So, you're denying that you work for him? - Yes. - I don't believe you. - I don't care. You will. Come on. Call Tomlinson. Tell him we're bringing Diana White in for questioning. - I'm not going anywhere without a lawyer. - You're not under arrest. I'm taking you to Ml6. You'll be interrogated by an agent of a foreign government. Your constitutional rights no longer apply. Let's go. - Have you seen Gael? - He doesn't have much time left. So fast. - Is he in a lot of pain? - You know the pathology of this virus. - I want to see him. - I wouldn't advise that. If I've been infected, I've been infected. There's nothing anyone can do. That's not what I meant. (hacking cough) (breathes heavily) - Do me a favour. - Anything. Contact my family... and tell them that I love them. Tell them that I died quickly, no pain. Of course. Gael. I was raised to believe... suicide is a sin. No one could blame you, in this world or the next, for ending your suffering. Are you so sure about that? (choking cough) A few seconds more, that's all I needed. You know... when I was trying to stop the cylinder from exploding, I hesitated, just a moment, because I was afraid. Then I forced myself to move forward. If only I hadn't hesitated, this might not be happening to me, to all those poor people upstairs. Oh, Gael, you did everything you could. I'm proud to have worked with you. You're one of... You're one of the bravest men I've ever known. And I will make sure that your wife and children know that. (chokes) (chokes) Homeland Security put the threat level to Red. They're in contact with the FBl, set to move if "the sky is falling" should trigger any kind of suspicious activity. Is the FAA set to ground flights and close airports? - David, I think that's an overreaction. - That was not my question. Yes. (man) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. - Please, be seated. Good morning. - (press) Good morning. I know the hour's unusual, but so are the times in which we live. As a result of intelligence on terrorist activity gathered by the office of Homeland Security and other agencies, I'm announcing that a threat level Red exists throughout the United States. Therefore, I'm ordering the grounding of all domestic and international air traffic, and the closing of airports. I'm not taking this action because the sky is falling. But I'd rather be overprotective than underprepared. And, as always, diligence and calm are your best weapons against the insidious nature of the enemy. And God willing, we and all those who love freedom will remain safe and secure. Thank you. - Mr President, can I have a question, please? - This is not a Q-and-A session. The president has made a statement and has nothing more to add. Thank you. One moment. Maybe a couple of questions. - Mr President? - Bill? - Is the United States currently under attack? - This is a preventive measure. What are you preventing? Will the public accept grounding air traffic based on the vague justification you've just given? The exact nature of the threat is something I can't go into. - Hello, Jack. - This is Chase Edmunds. Chase Edmunds, Trevor Tomlinson. This is Miss Diana White. Miss White. We've done some additional checking. She's the owner of the address in Chinatown where Saunders was. - I haven't seen him. - You might want to think that through. - Think he'd put himself on the line for you? - We're vetting the data on Saunders. - Have you sent it off to London? - No, it's still in our system. London wants to get as far as we can before transmitting. Get down! - She's dead! Chase! Are you hit? - I got it in the vest. Cover me. Trevor! Saunders' computer file. What server did you store it on? A 5. We gotta get down to the computer room. Use the stairs. Go! There's no way Saunders took out this place just to kill Diana. Ml6 has information that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. We need to get it. I'll get the door. Room's clear. Check him out. (beeping) - Chase. - What? We got a bomb. - How much time? - None. You gotta go now. - Go now! - Jack, I'm not leaving you. Get out of here! It's an order. Go now! (beeping quickens) I got it. Go! Go! Go! Go! (phone rings) - Almeida. - Tony, it's me. Gael's dead. He was suffering so badly. No one should have to go through what he did. Tony, there are children upstairs who are going to die in agony in front of their parents' eyes. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do for them. Actually, there is. - Field Ops has a supply of capsules. - Those are for agents that are captured. I know. They're for committing suicide to prevent torture. It's what they'd be used for. We could make them available to anyone symptomatic. - It would be their choice. - You know I'm not authorised to do that. I'm not interested in what's authorised. You're talking about mass suicide, facilitated by an agency of the government. I'm talking about common decency. Ifyou could have seen Gael... I'm calling because... if it was me... If I'm infected... I know what I'd want. We don't have much time. Gael was the first to die because he was the first exposed, but others won't be far behind. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. (woman) Mr Chappelle, line two. Chappelle. Ryan, it's Jack. Almost the entire Ml6 office has been wiped out. What? They took out a woman who had contact with Saunders, and most personnel, including Tomlinson, which means Saunders has a larger organisation than we thought. It also makes him more visible, easier to find. Got anything yet? I don't know. I'm following the money trail. I narrowed it to a few dozen offshore banks, but it'll take time. One of the things Saunders was trying to destroy was the information Ml6 had on him. I retrieved the hard drive storing that information. Call London, get their protocols and assemble a team ready to start striping data off this thing. - All right. I'll put Chloe on it right away. - OK. Suicide capsules. For the people down at the hotel. It's gonna get pretty bad down there. It's against every regulation in the book. Yeah. Do it. I tried to call Pachal. There's no answer. He's dead. So's Young, taken out in the Ml6 operation. And Bauer? He and his partner got out before the explosion. - But the hard drive was destroyed? - Completely. - What about Diana? - Dead. I'll miss her. There's one more thing. There have been inquiries made about the bank in Cayman. - By whom? - They're coming from CTU. - A man named Ryan Chappelle. - I know Chappelle. Apparently he's quite good at following money trails. Is he? Carry on. What is it? There was just an attack on the LA office of Ml6. - Jack Bauer was there at the time. - Is he all right? Yeah. He's on his way back to CTU. Any indication that the attack was triggered by what I said at the press conference? - We don't know what triggered the attack. - So, it could have been what I said? - How was the attack carried out? - By helicopter. And two men inside. They have to land it somewhere. I want FAA to coordinate with Homeland Security and Border Patrol. Right away, Mr President. (phone rings) What? I enjoyed your press conference. Good to know the sky's not falling. - What do you want? - To give you your next assignment. A sort of preliminary action to clear the decks before the main event to come. There's a man named Ryan Chappelle, regional director of CTU. - Yeah, what about him? - I want him killed. What? At 7am, have his body delivered to the train yard downtown, just off the main line. - It's out of the question. - What a shame. Before you decide, you might want to drop by the Chandler Plaza Hotel, look at what's happening. Then imagine the same taking place at hundreds of locations all over the country. You're insane. (dial tone) What does he want?
