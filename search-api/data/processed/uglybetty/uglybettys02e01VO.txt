i waed to talk to you both now, while i've got my nerve. i don't think you two have been very honest with me. what are you talking about? we tell you everything. actually,i think there's one very big secret you haven't told me about. what secrets? we don't have any secrets in this house. no. yoo-hoo! did someone forget about us? we were getting lonely. uh,this is our daughter a-a-amanda and her friend marc, and this is,um,bob and elaine klein. they're our new,uh,internet friends. it's a very funny story. see,they came over to play tennis. and wouldn't you know it,the sprinklers went off?

yes. no. no. well,you might want to think about slowing down a bit. now leave that patch on until the swelling's gone, and i'll be back in a minute with a prescription. okay. thank you very much,doctor. well,i hope you take his warning seriously and maybe start to slow down just a little bit - oh,no! it's 12:00! i'm late for my dad's lawyer. will you stay for the prescription?

well,when your father worked for fey,you know, handling her accounts,she found out she was pregnant. she wouldn't even tell us who the father was. honey,all fey ever wanted was a career. she knew she could never give you the love you needed. and since we couldn't have kids on our own... your father has lethargic sperm. is that really an important part of the story,rosemary? so you've been lying to me all these years? i'm not here. just looking for some more wine. amanda,adopted or not, - weoved you from the moment we held you in our arms. -  you're still our little girl. no,i'm not! i'm fey's and some guy we don't even know. i don't think i'll ever be able to trust you two ever again! it was really nice seeing you again. your home is beautiful. hey. hey! you leave my sister alone. you want a photo of a meade in trouble? here i am,you son of a bitch! mr. meade,this is i.c.u. any change at all today? her vitals are the same. mr. meade,are you sure you don't want to go in and see her? it just seems like you want to. you come this far every day, and you look at her through the window. i can't. no,i think,um,i need my medication. it's been four hours. you know,you go through life thinking you're one person, and then boom,just like that,the slate is wiped clean. i mean,who am i? - you are fey sommers' daughter. - yeah,but what does that even mean? she's just a woman who walked by my desk for years, and she never even looked at me,and now she's gone. maybe if we can find out who your real father is... how? he could be anybody. true. your mother was a hoochie in a bob. mm. if bradford is my father, that makes daniel my brother... who i slept with... a lot, and that's the kind of dirty that don't wash clean. okay,first of all,he'd be your half brother.</i> already a little better,right? and second,i gotta say,kinda hot. it's incest. okay,before you get all "flowers in the attic" on me, let's first find out if bradford really is your dad. and how are we gonna do that? invite him to father's day brunch and see if he shows up? no,sarcasma. three words-d.n.a. dad,i'm so sorry. i was only ten minutes late to the lawyer's office, but he still wouldn't see me. so i made another appointment. mija,relax. i'm fine here. although it wouldn't kill your cheap aunt to turn on the air conditioning every now and then! well,are you eating enough? are you taking your medication? oh! oh,i'm sorry. no peripheral vision. stop worrying about me. it just kills me that i'm so far away. i know. but you'll be home soon,so just have faith. te quiero. te quiero. s? i mean,hello> is this betty suarez? yeah. this is lisa lapera,justin's camp counselor. i just wanted to let you know,your nephew just took off. what do you mean,he just took off? apparently,the indian dream catchers we were making were "amateurish" and "culturally insensitive." he threw a hissy fit and said he was going home, and i'm not sure,but i think he stole a bottle of glitter. and we need that back or a check for $1.99. justin wouldn't... hello? ugh. this is not happening. no! damn,the hooker had her baby kidnapped, now she has tetanus? that's a pretty bad monday. okay,december 15th is the latest we can go with the new wedding date. otherwise people try to combine your wedding gift with your christmas gift, and that is not gonna happen. you sure you wanna wait till december? i mean,didn't this teach us anything? gotta live for today. what are you trying to say? let's elope. elope? yeah. oh. no,seriously,you,me,we'll grab justin. we'll go down to city hall this weekend. besides,my dad would die if he doesn't get to give me away. i guess it would be pretty rough... to miss you walking down the aisle in your wedding dress. you think it's all right that i'm wearing white,right? why don't you show me the dress? no way! that is bad luck! i just got shot. how much worse can my luck get? come on,mama. oh... dad-ford! i mean,bradford. i mean,mr. meade! i sufferrom severe cotton mouth. would you mind licking this for me? i beg your pardon? lick this for me. amanda,you don't have to lick these. see? thank you,betty. you're welcome. hey,what's different about you? did you ge your hair cut? i'm wearing an eye patch. you didn't always have that? those are pink gerber daisies. hey,look at that! they're for you. i think they came a few weeks ago. well,why didn't you give them to me? you know what,betty? i have had a lot on my mind these last few weeks. amanda! it might be hard to believe, but pretty girls have problems,too. thinking of you all right, ladies of natural disasters, and do say "ladies" and not "victims," because there isn't a victim among you. you've all survived horrible tragedies and now "mode" is going to make you beautiful. sheila,talk to me. okay,just like on the storyboards-- we're gonna show them at their absolute worst-- ravaged by hurricanes, floods,fires... sad,sad,sad. and then we do the "afters." happy,sexy,blown out. i love it. we change their lives and,uh, showcase the fall collections. mm-hmm. just make sure the skinny ones are up front. (sheila) "famine," makeup. now. bless your heart. what disaster are you, honey? mudslide? what? no,i'm not a victim. i'm fine. i just need some food. my blood sugar's a little low. uh-huh. looking good,"flood." excuse me, are there any more bagels? i don't see any more bagels. uh,no! you can have mine. no,no,no,no,no. i'm not gonna take a bagel from "famine." you need to eat,too. give me sofi of th it's just that there is nobody here who cares about filling the inside. they only care about fixing the outside! what's stumpy up to now? you know what? this concealer here, this isn't gonna change the fact that she doesn't have a house! and--and this, this eyeliner, this isn't gonna bring back the people that you loved! these women have lost everything! and there is not enough styling gel in here to change that! you know what? she's right. we don't have enough styling gel. oh,excuse me,mr. meade! hi,i have some mail here for you. ow! oh,my god,a paper cut! here,let me swab you. no,thank you. - ???? - ???? hit me again. you sure? it's your third one. i know my limit. this time chili cheese fries. betty? daniel? why aren't you in the hospital? well,i had a few... dozen calls about the photo shoot. i thought you might need a friend. fry? i was thinking with the leopard, we could add this belt-- n! i don't have the energy to say "no" anymore. what about this boa? n! what about this brooch? we can-- why don't you just stick the pin in my eye? what is the matter with you people? we might as well be publishing "field & stream" because apparently no one in this room knows a thing about fashion! (justin whispers) loose the belt. is it just me, or does anyone else see the little fashion elf? i'm sorry. i just think it's too busy. like coco chanel always says, "when accessorizing"... "always take off..." "always take off..." "the last thing you put on." "the last thing you put on." you've got the gift. phone call! i'm in the middle of a run-through. take a message. it's "schmaire schmeade." (lowers voice) claire meade? (lowers voice) yes. (normal voice) everyone out! (normal voice) go,go. get. get out of here. go. go. go. get out! ace the call. what? how? i don't know. figure it out. triangulate the signal. hello,is this no one's most wanted? oh,bite me,wilhelmina. i wanna talk to you about bradford. you mean my fianc? you're not in love with him. oh,claire, you're so wrong. i'm madly in love with him. as a matter of fact, i'm staring at our wedding invitations as we speak. do you love him more than "mode"? i know the magazine is what you've wanted all along. and i'm the only person who can give it to you. keep talking. leave bradford,and i will sign "mode" over to you. "wilhelmina slater-- editor-in-chief." are you salivating yet? no. meet me at the bow bridge in central park tonight at 8:00. i'll be dressed as a nun. or a cat. i haven't decided yet. have the documents ready, and i will sign "mode" over to you. 8:00. i couldn't do it. i couldn't triangulate the signal. i don't even know what triangulate means! don't worry,marc. i think all our problems will be taken care of. how'd you find me? it's no secret you turn to potatoes in times of need. it helps. look,daniel, i'm really sorry if i screwed up the photo shoot. i just--i think this whole thing with henry-- it finally got to me. and i shouldn't have let it. after everything that's happened to my family and to you... he's just a guy,right? he's a guy you loved. you know what? i have an idea. go back the office. there are some things you're gonna need to get for tonight. what's tonight? we're going to a funeral. sir? i don't mean to disturb you. may i speak to you privately? it's about wilhelmina. what about her? as you know,i'm privy to many of her conversations, both professional... and personal. she has issues with you. issues? ear hair. i didn't realize i had any. perhaps others have tried to tell you, but you couldn't hear through all the ear hair.</i> she would never, in a million years, bring this up. so i thought,as someone rooting for the relationship, i might spare you both the embarrassment. may i clip you,sir? never send a girl to do a woman's job. mm. ah. don't you think this is a little weird... and illegal? yeah, it's both those things. it's also symbolic. henry's gone. if you're gonna move on, you have to put him to rest, right? okay, i just hit something soft! ah! oh,i'm sorry. are you okay?  all right, what are you gonna bury first? um,well... i could start with these. this is from our first meal together. sushi. it was good... getting to know him. the raw eel? not so much. low sodium. he was always looking out for me. man,you brought a lot of stuff. uh,we may need a bigger hole. yo,how you doing in there? okay,you ready? damn. you like it? i was gonna take it in a bit, maybe cut the top a little bit lower. no,no,no,don't do anything. don't touch it. it's beautiful. just like you. okay,so now you've seen the dress. papi... i want something from you. oh,come on,baby,you know what the doctor said. i need at least a month. (laughs) no,not that. i wanna hear your vows. now? i knew it. i knew you didn't write them! you had two months! you are so not seeing the honeymoon lingerieow. give me my jeans. reach into the back pocket. go ahead. you feel stupid? a little bit. mm-hmm. say your prayers,bitch. bradford! i knew i could count on you working late on thursdays. we don't have much time. wilhelmina is in the park. is she? you ain't wilhelmina slater. no,i'm not even sure what i'm doing here or why i'm wearing this outfit. please don't hurt me. (pants) did you really think i'd fall for your offer? i knew you'd never take "mode" away from your own children. but that's all right. i may not have "mode," but very soon i will have everything else, including your husband. oh... listen to me go on and on. i'm so rude. sit down. you're the guest. let me,uh, fix you a drink. though you'll probably have to down it quickly, because the police will be here in,um... three minutes. i only need one. and this is the crown he gave me at the middle ages. (snores) are you sleeping? no. (clears throat) that was a silent prayer. i was just... so moved by the paper clips he gave you. this is good-bye for him and you. any final words? okay,well... here... near the place where it all came to an end, lies the remnants of a relationship that almost, but never quite was. "it started good, really good. "and then it got bad... "mainly 'cause of me. "i took her for granted, "never realizing she was everything i needed. "she was always there... right in front of me." i hoped for so much. i had a fantasy. we were together. we were building a life. "it took me ten years... "but i'm glad i finally came to my senses... before the most special thing in my life..." was gone... for good. * comfort is my solitude i embrace * i loved you,henry. "i love you,hilda." * i will rise from my sorrow * i wilmyrise froorrow * * i will rise from my sorrow how do you feel? i don't know. uh,better,i guess. maybe now i can start fresh. what's that? are you in pain? no,i just--i... i need a fresh start,too. you okay? not really. there's something i didn't tell you. the reason we were in the accident... why my sister is in the coma... i was high. she was rushing me to the rehab hospital. it was my fault. you know,i don't know if i'm ever... gonna be able to get over the guilt. but i can get over these. good-bye,henry. oh,it was horrible! the next thing i know, sister mary gang member threw me to the ground and took my wallet. marc,i am in serious trouble. you? i don't think i'll ever be able to watch "the sound of music" again! claire's not going away easily. and apparently she's got friends. i need protection. hi. it's me... daniel. sorry i didn't come by... sooner. i just didn't think i could handle seeing you like this. you were always the rock, right? the strong one. oh,my god! i'm so sorry,alexis. this should be me. (strained voice) oh,i'm thirsty. nurse! nurse! alexis,can you hear me? yeah,daniel, i can hear you. alexis,i... i can't believe this. why do you keep calling me alexis? what? it's me. alex. hi. hi. so i heard there was a little fashion elf spreading the word of coco chanel around "mode" today. i'm sorry,aunt betty. i had to get away. that's okay. but as far as tomorrow goes-- i know,back to camp. actually,i think you were meant for greater things than macaroni necklaces,justin, so i talked to daniel, and it looks like we're gonna need an intern around the office for the next couple of weeks before school starts. oh,my god! oh,my god! are you serious? you deserve it. thank you. thank you. i can't believe you wrote this. it is so beautiful. what,did you think i was gonna stand up there in front of everybody and just wing it? (giggles) kinda. hey,tomorrow,let's open up some of these presents. let's see who's cheaper, your family or my family. look,babe... we can't stay in here forever. i think i gotta go. no. no,no,no. not yet,okay? we just need one more day. shh. just wait one more day. it's gonna be okay. oh. hey,uh,i know you probably don't want to, but any chance you wanna come down and help me and justin make dinner? * together under * lonesome silver stars he's gone,betty. s * theilence spoke for us that's the first time i've said that out loud. * as i remember * in a golden dream * in a golden dream oh,god,he's gone. * there's a veil of tears between us * yeah. he's gone. * and many years * may keep us apart * but i remember
