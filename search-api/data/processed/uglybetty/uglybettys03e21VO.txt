SLATER SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOUR FRIEND CHRISTINA McKINNEY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HER CHILD. NO, SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SHE LOVES THAT BABY. SHE'S AS DEVASTATED AS ANYONE ELSE. WHICH GIVES HER EVEN MORE OF A MOTIVE. LOOK, SHE ALREADY TOLD YOU, SHE WAS IN THE CLOSET THE WHOLE TIME. DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID ANYTHING? THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING TO YOU, MISS SUAREZ. (sighs) DETECTIVE, I HAVE KNOWN CHRISTINA FOR YEARS. THERE IS NO WAY SHE COULD'VE DONE THIS. OKAY. YOU CAN GO. BUT, UH, IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP, HERE'S MY CARD. CHRISTINA! HI, HILDA. (Hilda) Archie hated the dresses. HE SAYS THEY'RE TOO FANCY. HE WANTS TO REPRESENT HIMSELF AS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE AND DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE THE NEXT SARAH PALIN. HILDA, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY. OKAY, WHAT IS THE EMERGENCY? STRIPES ARE OVER? NO, WILHELMINA'S BABY'S BEEN KIDNAPPED. OH... GOD. THEN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING TO ME FOR? Go! Go! AMANDA, DO YOU KNOW WHERE CHRISTINA IS?

CHRISTINA,HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? I DON'T KNOW! WHEN YOU TOLD ME THE BABY WAS IN THE OFFICE,I-I JUST SNAPPED. AND THEN WHEN EVERYONE WENT TO THE ELEVATOR, I JUST TOOK HIM,AND THEN I CALLED STUART. YOU KNOW, I DEFENDED YOU TO THE POLICE I'M A PART OF THIS NOW. I'M ACCOMPLICE TO A KIDNAPPING. BETTY, IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN SON. IT'S NOT YOUR CHILD. CHRISTINA, THERE WAS A TEST. THE BABY IS WILHELMINA'S! AND YOU THINK THAT WILHELMINA IS NOT CAPABLE OF-- OF FAKING A D.N.A. TEST? BETTY, SHE NEEDS THAT CHILD  TO HOLD ON TO HER PLACE AT MEADE. THIS IS INSANE. THIS IS CRAZY.WE HAVE TO GO BACK. YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE BABY. I CAN'T. I CAN'T GO BACK. THEY'LL ARREST ME. OH! OH, GOD. OH, I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'TMEAN FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED. AND THIS CHART CLEARLY SHOWS THE FOURTH-QUARTER PROJECTIONS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE,EVEN IN A BAD ECONOMY, MODE"" SALES HAVE INCREASED." WE'VE ALREADY LINED UP KATE BECKINSALE,PENELOPE CRUZ, ANNE HATHAWAY FOR THE FALL COVER-- IS THIS A JOKE? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY CHILD! HATHAWAY--SHE, UM, SHE'S HOT. SORRY. UH, I MEAN,SHE'S HOT RIGHT NOW. I'M SORRY. MR. HARTLEY... THIS DEAL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT, UH, MY PARTNER'S SON HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED-- MY HALF BROTHER.

LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE. WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE. YOUR TAILLIGHT IS OUT. OH. JUST THE TAILLIGHT? IS ROAD SAFETY A JOKE TO YOU? NO, MA'AM.

OH, BETTY,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING. CHRISTINA, LOOK, I BELIEVE YOU, OKAY? YEAH.BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THINGS. I JUST WISH YOU WOULD'VE COME TO ME FIRST. NEXT TIME. LET'S JUST GET SOMEWHERE SAFE SO WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. JEEZ,I CAN'T READ THIS WATCH. LET'S JUST SAY HOUR FOUR OF THE SLATER-MEADE KIDNAPPING. NOW THE FUZZ HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STINGY ABOUT THE DETAILS, SO WE'RE FORCED TO CONFINE OUR REPORTING TO GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED WILD SPECULATION. NOW THE BOYS IN THE F.X. DEPARTMENT HAVE USED AGE-PROGRESSION SOFTWARE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SPAWN OF BRADFORD MEADE AND WILHELMINA SLATER WOULD LOOK LIKE BY 20. MOTHER OF PEARL,THE MAN IS AN ADONIS. THE WORLD CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS SPECIMEN. IF YOU'RE OUT THERE LISTENING, I MAKE THIS DEMAND OF THE KIDNAPPERS-- BRING HIM BACK. WE'RE TALKING FASHION ROYALTY. MOM! MOM. I HAVE TO WATCH THIS!THIS IS MY O.J. THEN GO WATCH IN THE KITCHEN. THEY'RE ABOUT TO START SHOOTING. (woman) WE'RE GONNA SET UP IN THE SALON. THAT'S PERFECT, THANKS. NICE WORK, GETTING THEM TO SHOOT IN MY SALON. IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS. WELL, YOUR SALON IS AN EXAMPLE OF MY SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS. AND IT'S THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT THAT WILL PULL THIS COUNTRY RIGHT OUT OF-- YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.YOU ALREADY GOT MY VOTE. JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A CLEAR SHOT OF MY SIGN. OH, OKAY. HEY, THANKS FOR TONING DOWN THE OUTFIT, HUH? NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS THING. (woman) UM, COUNCILMAN,WE'RE READY TO CHECK YOUR MIKE. OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. UM, THANKS. SEE YOU IN A BIT. OKAY, JUST WIPE THAT-- OKAY. OKAY. (sighs) ...THIS DRAMA WILL UNFOLD. THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS, WHERE IN THE WORLD IS THAT KIDNAPPED BABY? IF THE BABY SNATCHERS HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AT ALL, THEY'LL TAKE THE GENETICALLY BLESSED BAMBINO TO... YOU ARE KIDDING ME. WE FOUND THIS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA IN THE STAIRWELL. I BROUGHT IT TO YOU FIRST,AS PER OUR USUAL AGREEMENT. HIT IT. UH, COULD YOU PAUSE,PLEASE? UM, TROY, MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT ALONE? COME ON, YOU. WHO'S THAT? THAT IS CHRISTINA'S HUSBAND STUART. (gasps) GREAT SCOTT! I'M SORRY. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT. SO SHE REALLY DID TAKE THE BABY. OH, SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS. THE BABY'S SAFE. NOW ALL WE NEED TO FIND CHRISTINA IS A TEAM OF BOOZE-SNIFFING HOUNDS. WIL, IT'S OKAY. CHRISTINA WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT LITTLE WILLIAM. IN A FEW HOURS,HE'LL BE BACK SAFE AND SOUND IN HIS NANNY'S ARMS. WE DON'T HAVE A FEW HOURS. IF CHRISTINA HAS THE BABY,THEN THE TRUTH IS GOING TO GET OUT. WHAT TRUTH ARE YOU REFERRING TO? I HAD THE D.N.A. TEST FAKED. THE BABY'S NOT MINE. IT'S CHRISTINA'S. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU FAKED THE D.N.A. TEST IN ORDER TO CLAIM CHRISTINA'S BABY AS YOUR OWN. THE BIGGER PICTURE, FOOL. IF IT GETS OUT THAT THIS BABY IS NOT MINE, I LOSE MY CLAIM TO THE MEADE FORTUNE. I'M FIRED, AND YOU ALONG WITH ME. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT BABY IS SO THEY DON'T DISCOVER THE TRUTH. HOW? CHRISTINA COULD BE ANYWHERE. OKAY. I'M A SCOTTISH SEAMSTRESS/KIDNAPPER AND I HAVE A PASTY COMPLEXION. WHERE DO I TURN? YOU WOULD TURN TO YOUR BEST FRIEND. BETTY. BETTY. OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS ARE THE KIDNAPPERS? I TOTALLY CALLED THAT. SHH! NO, WE'RE NOT KIDNAPPERS. WELL, OKAY, TECHNICALLY,WE'RE KIDNAPPERS, BUT IT--IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. THIS IS SO EXCITING. I GOTTA  GO TELL ALL MY FRIENDS WHOA, YOU GO UP TO YOUR ROOM AND YOU DON'T SAY A WORD. YOU GOT THAT? BUT ALL THIS DRAMA--I CAN'T EVEN TELL THE DRAMA CLUB? ZIP. FINE. YOU GUYS GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. IF REPORTERS THINK THAT ARCHIE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, HIS CAREER IS THROUGH,AND THEN WE ARE THROUGH. HILDA, JUST KEEP THEM IN THE SALON. WE'LL SNEAK UP THE STAIRS. THEY'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW WE WERE HERE. ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE HOUSE. WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? I DON'T CARE. I JUST DON'T WANT ARCHIE TO SEE YOU HERE. HILDA? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? (chuckles) YEAH. EVERYTHING IS GREAT.NEVER BETTER! FINE, I WILL DISTRACT THEM. BUT THIS ISN'T OVER. (Hilda) OKAY, EVERYBODY! LET'S GET THOSE CAMERAS ROLLING. I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS. HOW ABOUT EVERYBODY FACES ME AS I STAND AGAINST THE WINDOW? OH, HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN ARCHIE'S POSTER, HOW HANDSOME HE IS? COME ON, STOP. OH, NO, THAT'S GREAT. WHY DON'T WE USE WHILE WE'RE-- YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY,I PREFER THE WINDOW. I LIKE TO BE BACKLIT. IT'S VERY... SPIELBERG. WAS THAT A BABY? NO, THAT WAS JUSTIN, MY SON. MEGAN FOX AND BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN BROKE UP AGAIN. HE WAS REALLY PULLING FOR THEM, SO HE'S JUST... WELL, HERE'S WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR... AND THEN WE CAN SHOW THAT WE'RE INSIDE A HOUSE. YOU KNOW, YOU WANNA GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR? YOU KNOW WHAT?I JUST HAD AN IDEA--GENIUS. ARCHIE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD REALLY SHOW THEM? THE YIELD SIGN YOU HAD INSTALLED DOWN THE BLOCK. WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SEE A YIELD SIGN? BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FIRST ACT AS COUNCILMAN. FIRST SMALL STEP ON THE WAY TO GREATNESS. ACTUALLY, I LOVE IT. IF YOU WERE SMART, YOU'D HIREHER AS YOUR PUBLICIST. WELL, O-OKAY. SEE? COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU THE SIGN. BEFORE IT WAS THERE,THERE WAS NO YIELDING. IT WAS CHAOS. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. HE HAS SAVED THE DAY-- ARCHIE RODRIGUEZ. YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME, MIJA? OH, HI, STUART. I'M AFRAID WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DETOUR. KIDNAPPING. AY, DIOS MIO. THAT'S GOTTA BE, LIKE,10,000 HAIL MARYS. PAPI-- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ASKED WHERE YOU SHOULD DRAW THE LINE WHEN HELPING A FRIEND? YOU JUST CROSSED IT. HILDA, WE HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS. PAPI, YOU UNDERSTAND,RIGHT? I'M TRYING TO. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA DISCUSS THE FACT THAT YOU KIDNAPPED A BABY, BUT THEN TO BRING HIM HERE WITH ARCHIE'S CAMPAIGN ON THE LINE? WHAT WAS I GONNA DO? SHE NEEDED MY HELP. I COULDN'T JUST TURN MY BACK ON HER. BUT, BETTY, SHE DIDN'T JUST JUMP A SUBWAY TURNSTILE. THIS IS KIDNAPPING! I KNOW, BUT SHE THINKSTHAT BABY IS HERS,AND I BELIEVE HER.

ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. SO IN THEORY,IF YOU HADN'T STOPPED US, WE'D ALREADY KNOW THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE BABY'S MOTHER. IN FACT, WE WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU RESOLVE THE SITUATION. HEY, LADY, YOU CAN STOP TALKING, HUH? WE GET IT. YOU'VE BEEN FREE TO GO FOR 15 MINUTES. YOUR FRIEND OVER THERE HAS GOT A GOOD LAWYER. OK, SO, SO WILINLMIN S REEDREEDDRO THE THA CHARGES AIAGAINSTHBOF YOF YO AATUTBOUT CHRNA? BETTY, DANIEL??THAT THE BABY IS HERS. DANIEL, I BELIEVE HER. COME ON, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO WILHELMINA. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP. (Claire) JUST DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. THAT WOMAN WON'T GIVE UP ANYTHING UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON HER. WILHELMINA, WE ARE IN FRONT OF A D.N.A. FACILITY. WHAT HARM COULD IT POSSIBLY DO? I AM NOT GONNA INDULGE THE LUNATIC WHO TOOK MY SON JUST TO GIVE HER PEACE OF MIND. I KNOW. I-I'M JUST SAYING,THEN WE'D BE DONE WITH THIS WHOLE UGLY SITUATION. WE COULD PUT IT BEHIND US. I TOOK THE TEST ALREADY. IT PROVED THAT HE WAS MY SON. I KNOW. JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, I SHOULD SUBMIT TO ANOTHER ONE? LOOK, DANIEL,SHE STOLE MY SON. LORD KNOWS WHERE SHE COULD'VE TAKEN HIM. AND YOU WANT ME TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR HER? AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,SHE CAN ROT IN JAIL. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO. WE'RE IN HANDCUFFS IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR, BETTY. I THINK WE MIGHT BE OUT OF OPTIONS. NO, WE'RE NOT. WE COULD GET A COURT ORDER OR... SOMETHING. WE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT. I DON'T KNOw WHAT I WAS THINKING... TAKING ON WILHELMINA SLATER. I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE. CHRISTINA... YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,BETTY. I JUST WANTED HIM TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE. THAT'S ALL. (man) MA'AM, WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE? I MADE A FEW MORE BOTTLES,AND THEY'RE IN THE REFRIGERATOR, AND THE NANNY SHOULD BE HERE AT 7:00 TO TAKE OVER. THANK YOU, MARC. IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE? N-NO. UM, JUST... CONGRATULATIONS, I GUESS. YOU DID IT. AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS,THE BABY IS YOURS. THE BABY IS MINE, MARC. OF COURSE HE IS. UM... AND YOUR POSITION AT THE COMPANY IS SECURE. AND CHRISTINA IS GOING TO JAIL. WIN-WIN. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT? I... HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,WILHELMINA. GOOD NIGHT, MARC. I'M SORRY, HILDA. I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THEM HERE. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. MM. IT'S JUST A GOOD THING THAT ARCHIE DIDN'T FIND OUT. IF HE THOUGHT THAT YOU BROUGHT A KIDNAPPED BABY HERE WITH A NEWS CREW FOLLOWING HIM AROUND... (laughs) HE WOULD BE SO, SO-- I WOULD BE SO... WHAT? CUTE. YOU ARE SO CUTE. DID YOU CHANGE TIES? BECAUSE IT IS--IT IS CUTE. IT IS WORKING FOR ME.SEXY. I LIKE IT. HILDA, I KNOW. (scoffs) CONCEITED! BUT STILL CUTE. JUSTIN TOLD ME EVERYTHING. (chuckles) HE'S ALWAYS MAKING UP STORIES. HE'S VERY CREATIVE. HILDA, STOP. LOOK, SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, ARCHIE. IT WAS ME. IT WAS MY FAULT. I WASN'T TRYING TO ENDANGER YOUR CAMPAIGN. I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP MY FRIEND. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK THAT'S NOBLE. WHAT? YOU WERE STRESSING ABOUT WHAT DRESS I WAS GONNA WEAR, BUT NOW YOU'RE OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING? OKAY, OKAY, TO BE CLEAR, AS CANDIDATE FOR QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT, I AM NOT OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING, BUT... AS YOUR FRIEND, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT'S RIGHT,BECAUSE WILHELMINA WON. DID YOU TRY FIGHTING DIRTY? EXCUSE ME? WELL, I'M--I'M JUST SAYING, WE ALL WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES, BUT SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED IN CITY POLITICS IS, WELL, TO GET WHAT YOU WANT, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT TO BE A LITTLE... CREATIVE. I KNOW THE TRUTH. AND, UH, WHAT TRUTH DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW? THAT BABY DOESN'T BELONG WITH YOU. AND THAT AUBERGINE FAUX FUR DOESN'T BELONG WITH ANYTHING. YET HERE WE ARE. I CAN PROVE IT. YOU SEE THIS? THIS STAIN IS THE BABY'S SPIT-UP. AND WHEN I GET IT TESTED, IT'S GONNA PROVE THAT THE BABY IS CHRISTINA'S, AND YOU WILL GO TO JAIL. OR... YOU CAN ADMIT THAT THE BABY ISN'T YOURS, AND WE CAN CHALK UP THAT FAKE D.N.A. TEST TO A MISTAKE. YOUR CHOICE. LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ME. YES. YES, I DO. SO WE SHOULD GIVE THAT ENCHANTING POLY-BLEND THING TO YOUR LAB? AND WHEN THE D.N.A. RESULTS COME BACK AND THEY SAY STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE, THEN WHAT? BABY SPIT-UP AND MILKSHAKE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLORS. OH, COME ON, BETTY. I'M A FASHION EXPERT. I NOTICE EVERYTHING. IT'S A GIFT AND A CURSE. ALL RIGHT, FINE. I DON'T HAVE D.N.A. EVIDENCE. BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP. I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY, AND I DON'T HAVE YOUR POWER, BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH, AND I WILL FIGHT UNTIL IT COMES OUT. WILHELMINA, EVEN YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LIE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH NOW. WHEN I DISCOVERED THE ERROR IN THE D.N.A. TEST, I WAS DEVASTATED, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING. BECAUSE WHILE I KNEW I'D BE LOSING MY BABY, THERE WAS SIMPLY NO WAY I COULD KEEP A CHILD FROM HIS REAL MOTHER. IN A FINAL TWIST, IT TURNS OUT THE BABY APPEARS NOT TO BE THE SCION OF BRADFORD MEADE AND WILHELMINA SLATER-- BOO-HOO--BUT RATHER SOME KID FROM A COUPLE OF SCOTTISH PEOPLE. NOW GIVEN THIS NEW INFORMATION, WE'VE HAD TO REVISE OUR PREVIOUS DEPICTION OF WHAT THE BABY WOULD LOOK LIKE AT 20. DEAR LORD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS A SHAME THAT THIS KIDNAPPING STORY HAS COME TO SUCH A TRAGIC CONCLUSION. I CAN'T BELIEVE WILHELMINA TOLD THE TRUTH. YES, THE WOMAN'S A SAINT. OH, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT HER SHARES IN THE COMPANY ARE LITTLE WILLIAM'S, AND WITHOUT THE BABY, SHE'S GOT NOTHING. AND I DON'T CARE HOW TALENTED SHE IS. YOU KEEP A COBRA AROUND LONG ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY THEY BITE. MOM'S RIGHT. WILHELMINA'S PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED. LET ME FIRE HER. NO. I'M GONNA DO IT. IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. FINE. BUT I WANT TO SEE TEARS. MR. HARTLEY BEFORE WE SIGN THE PAPERWORK, THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF. WILHELMINA, AHEM, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU? YOU'RE FIRED. UH, I'M SORRY.I COULDN'T HELP IT. SERIOUSLY? YOUR TIME AT MEADE IS OVER. WELL, THAT IS A SHAME. LET'S GO, GUYS. WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? IF YOU'RE GONNA FIRE WILHELMINA, I'M OUT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MR. HARTLEY, THIS IS AN INTERNAL PERSONNEL MATTER. BUT I HAVE AN OPINION. I THOUGHT WE AGREED YOU'D BE A SILENT PARTNER. WELL, YOU'LL FIND THAT SOMETIMES I'M NOT SO SILENT. SHE'S A SHARK.SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED. SON, I THINK A SHARK IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO BALANCE THINGS OUT AROUND HERE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? LOOK, YOU'RE A STAND-UP GUY, DANIEL, AND THAT'S GREAT, BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU HOPPING OFF TO YOUR BUNNY HOLE EVERY TIME A PROBLEM COMES UP. I OWN COMPANIES IN COLOMBIA,INDIA, BRAZIL. IF I STOPPED DOING BUSINESS EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOT KIDNAPPED, I'D NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE. SO EITHER MS. SLATER KEEPS HER STAKE IN THE COMPANY AND HER JOB,OR I WALK. PLEASURE. CLAIRE. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. (man) GOOD. FOR YOU. I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST. OKAY, NEVER MIND. (sighs) GLAD TO SEE YOU,BETTY. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO THANK YOU. WHAT FOR? FOR THE PLUCKY LITTLE THREAT YOU MADE. YOU WERE RIGHT. THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT. AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER NOT TO HAVE TO LIE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I TOOK THAT QUITE TO HEART. IF YOU'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THIS COMPANY, I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ME. WHAT IS THAT? I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO STOLE A DEAD MAN'S SPERM, WHO FALSIFIED D.N.A. RESULTS,WHO KEPT A MOTHER IN THE DARK JUST TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION THAT HER BABY WAS MINE-- ALL OF THIS TO ENSURE MY PLACE IN THIS COMPANY. WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THIS? BECAUSE I'M SOMEONE YOU NEED ON YOUR SIDE, WORKING FOR YOU AS OPPOSED TO AN ENEMY... WORKING AGAINST YOU. YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO TELL THE TRUTH, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, HARTLEY DECIDED TO KEEP ME ON. SO THANK YOU AGAIN. OH, AND WHEN CHRISTINA COMES BACK, WOULD YOU BE A DEAR AND BRING THE BABY TO HER? I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF SHE AND I DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER. BRAVO, WILHEL-MAESTRO. BRAVO. WHO'S THAT? IT'S YOUR MOMMY. (whispers) HELLO. THERE'S MOMMY. AND I'M YOUR DADDY. YES, YES. HEY, LITTLE GUY. HEY. BETTY... I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE YOU FIRST GOT TO "MODE." I MEAN, YOU STILL DRESS THE SAME, BUT STILL, A LONG WAY. IT'S BEEN REALLY LOVELY KNOWING YOU AS A FRIEND. I MEAN THAT. CHRISTINA, STOP. WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE YOU'RE GOING AWAY? CHRISTINA... STUART AND I ARE GONNA GO BACK TO SCOTLAND. WHAT? WHY? WE WANT TO BE CLOSER TO OUR FAMILIES SO THE WEE ONE CAN GET TO KNOW THEM. PLUS, I DON'T WANT HIM SPEAKING LIKE A YANK, 'CAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU PEOPLE SAY. (chuckles) BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAREER? WHAT ABOUT DESIGNING? WHAT, YOU THINK THEY DON'T HAVE DESIGNERS IN EDINBURGH? LISTEN, I'VE NOT GIVEN UP ON MY DREAM. THAT WAS SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM A VERY GOOD FRIEND. COME HERE. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.
