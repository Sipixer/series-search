- Weird. just then, I hear henry's voice. - Betty? I realize it's not henry, but... Antonio Sabato Jr.? Before I can do anything, Antonio rips the hot dog from my hand. No hot dog for you, Betty Suarez. And then he kisses me. Joanna    ronald     sadnessleaf honeybunny Matt? How could you, Betty? You betrayed me. You're a cheater. you kissed him. You kissed Antonio Sabato Jr. with tongue. You frenched Antonio Sabato Jr? Was it good? That's not the point. Obviously, he'Henry. Oh. So what's the hot dog? Also not the point. I think I have to tell Matt that I kissed Henry Before we move in together. Betty, I don't care how guilty you feel. Keep your piehole shut. Please tell me, what good is telling him? Well, I don't want there to be secrets between us, Especially when we're about to take things to another level. I mean, it's been three days already. Listen, if that kiss meant nothing, You're about to turn nothing into something. I don't know. Matt's coming home from his painter's retreat today. I'm just gonna tell him at lunch. Good morning. Hey. What are you doing up so early? The live media telecast of the Mama Award nominees. Oh, yeah. Oh, the Mama Awards-- am I nominated? The magazine and media association awards. Yeah, it's, like, my favorite awards show After the Oscars, the Tonys, The Golden Globes and the Grammys. Aw. My baby's so full of culture. You are so getting into That performing arts high school. Mom, it's too early for love. Nominees in the category of socially relevant article Are "anorexia's forgotten prisoners," The "New York Review"... In honor of the Mama Awards, Your traditional one bite of bagel. Thank you. I assumed since you're off to work for "Vogue" now, You wouldn't be here this morning. Oh, Stop. My head may belong to Anna Wintour, But my heart will always belong to you And Jake Gyllenhaal-- but mostly you. And the nominees for best fashion issue of the year... That's our category. "Elle," spring fashion issue, march, 2009, Editor-in-chief Robbie Myers. "Mode" magazine, wedding issue... Editors-in-chief Daniel Meade and Wilhelmina Slater... Willie, it's your first nomination as editor-in-chief. Too bad I have to share it with that drooling idiot. Congratulations. You're nominated for a Mama for the wedding issue. Mm. that's cool. Cool? It's huge. Not to mention, I'm on the cover. Okay, that is definitely the best part. Wait, wait. you had a fever last night. You have to get back to sleep. Come on. I'm fine. And even better knowing... you're gonna win. Yeah. I can't wait-- My husband on stage accepting his trophy. I am so proud of you, babe. Yay, Wilhelmina! All hail the nominee! Oh, this is all too much. you know I hate attention. - Brava, Willie. Brava. - Oh, you don't have to do that. - Keep doing that. - Marc, where is the press? Eagerly awaiting their queen. That's not their queen. Look at them fawning over her Like she's Obama's portuguese water dog. I think it's time we bust out That little secret we dug up. So are there any more questions Oh, I have one. Uh, I was thinking about taking a little vacation To Madison, South Dakota. I heard it's a wonderful place to find your inner child. Ever been there, recently, or maybe in the early '80s? I think we've had quite enough questions. Thank you all for coming. Thank you. What does she mean? what does she mean by that? Were you there at that time? I'm so sorry. You know how easily the elderly tire out. Now who wants to talk about my nomination? When did you find out? How did you share that with Daniel? Congratulations! Huh. That's... interesting. It's an "M" for Mama. You can't tell? A piece broke off. Okay, I ate it. Why aren't you out there doing any press? Oh, my mom's Senior V.P. now. I'll let her be the face of the company. I meant to ask you, has Penny Meadows turned in That Yves Saint Laurent piece yet? I haven't gotten anything. That's weird. She's been working on that for months now. I'm gonna need that for the fall issue. Can you go check and see how it's coming? - What? - It's just... she's mean... And scary and she always has terrible breath, Like coffee and moth balls And some other weird smell I can't quite figure out. Betty, she's not that bad. What the hell do you want, eyebrow? Good morning, Penny. Daniel was wondering about the Yves Saint Laurent piece. - Working on it. - Right, I understand. It's just-- Look at those damn pigeons-- taunting me, Making their little pigeon noises... Crapping all over the window. - Could you give me a hand here? - Um, okay. See, the thing is, They're starting to work on the fall issue, - And Daniel's just a little concerned... - You want a beer? No, thank you. Uh, maybe... maybe after work, When it's appropriate to drink. So about the article-- Listen, buzzkill, you can't rush art, okay? Did anyone say to Picasso, "yo, Pablo, "uh, could you hurry up "with that Guernica thing? You're a real Pioneers full of fun. shoo! Shoo! shoo! shoo! Come on. go. shoo. shoo. Why are they wearing gas masks? It's protecting them From the foul stench of their lies. Wow. uh... that's neat. It's dark, but neat. It's where inspiration took me. Um, matt, I have something That I've been meaning to talk to you about. I'm glad to hear it. God, this is hard. But before we move in, i-i think that you should know-- Oh, my god! penny? Fall fashion exclusive-- Emphasis on "fall." "mode" feature editor penny meadows To shoo pigeons away from her 28th-floor window. On my sexy death meter, this one barely rates a 3. All right, so I issued a statement to the press, Signed the police report. - What else are we forgetting? - I sent flowers to the family. - Oh, good. thank you. - daniel, I was thinking, Maybe I could organize a memorial service So that her friends here can say good-bye to her. -did she have friends -not really, but we'd do sth nice - I was thinking a coffee cart. - oh, I'd love a coffee-- I mean, uh, I think penny would've really liked that. I hate even thinking about it, But how are we gonna spread out her workload here? Well, um... Daniel, since you brought it up, - I was thinking--  - do you want her job? Oh, god. it sounds so awful when you say it out loud. No, no, we were thinking the same thing. I think a feature editor position Would be a perfect fit for you. Well, we should be respectful. You know, let the grieving process happen Before we tell anyone. Way to go, aunt betty! Guys, please. it's a really delicate situation. Promise me you're not gonna show up at work With balloons or a cake. - Somebody say cake? - papi, please. it's so inappropriate. I'm sorry for how you got the job, mija, - But you know you deserve it. - thank you, papi. Look, if it helps, we can all go to church tonight - And light a candle for the poor woman. - oh, good. I could light a candle for saint vitus. The patron saint of all actors? He's gotta have some pull at the performing arts school. oh, honey. Don't worry about it. You're gonna get in. you're gonna be a big star. Now go help grandpa with the meat loaf. Hurry up. hurry up. so tell me, what happened with matt? I didn't get to tell him. The accident sort of interrupted things. - Good. - no, not good. I need to tell him. You know that I am a very spiritual person, right? - Not really. - I am. And I try to find the meaning in everything, And all I'm gonna say is, that woman gave her life So that you could have a chance at a new one. okay, that's a little much. You got a new job, you got a chance At a clean slate with matt. Why are you gonna screw it up by telling him? You're just gonna hurt him. Okay, ryan, If you're going to be replacing marc, There are a few things you need to know. NO.1, wilhelmina doesn't like being called by her name. She prefers "honey." And number "b," she insists on a morning mouth kiss-- - A big one. - amanda! - Are you trying to sabotage young ryan? - yes, I hate him. Marc, you can't just replace yourself - With another gay guy. - I'm not gay. Yeah, right. You're in a long-distance relationship With a lovely heavy woman. Watch your back, new boy. She's coming out of her meeting. Give this file to her. Wilhelmina... We need to talk. So victoria hartley told you about south dakota. She told me her husband got you pregnant. I assume that's the same story. I was pregnant by my husband's best friend. I had a very difficult decision to make. I left the city and i... Terminated the pregnancy. Bradford and cal never knew. But all the lying drove me to have a nervous breakdown. It took me a year to recover. Mm. I love our girl talk. So I suspect there's a reason why you don't want cal To know about your difficult decision. I could see how he might hate you. What do you want, wilhelmina? I want you to step down As senior vice president of meade, And keep your big dandelion head Out of any "mode" business. Oh, claire, you know what might be fun? If you announce your resignation at the mama awards. Seems appropriate. Don't you think? I didn't think it was possible For a human being to exist And not have one ounce of humanity, But there you are. Why, claire, you flatter me. Methinks ye olde claire is vanquished yes, we have conquered our enemy once again. It seems like This will be our last conquest together. I guess it is. We've had a lot of good times together. oh. Remember breaking into that safe To steal bradford's will? Oh, that was the best. No. the best was having christina accused Of kidnapping her own baby. Wait, you're forgetting the fact The we stole the sperm from bradford's cold, dead body In the first place. Oh, good times. Oh. we really should be in jail. Marc, I know I always haven't been... Forthcoming with my praise for you. I just want you to know that, uh... I'm really... Going to miss you. Oh, my g--oh! Um, wilhelmina. I-i just wanted you to know That penny's memorial's about to start. Oh, uh, marc, before you go, I want to talk to you about something. So is that really the best picture You could find? It's the one where she was happiest. Oh--matt. hello. Hey, how's it going? Uh, pretty crazy. Yeah, I'll bet. Hey, listen, I know you're busy, But before everything happened, You were gonna tell me something. No, no. it was nothing. Really? 'cause it sounded pretty important. No, it was about the move. Um, listen, matt, uh, The memorial is just about to start. So could we talk about this later? Sure. Oh, my god. a ghost. I'm not a ghost, dumbass. I'm her twin sister. Oh. oh, I am so, so sorry about your sister. We all... Worked with her. You must be Mindy. Wow. you really do look-- I know. Penny got the looks, and I got the personality. Well, we're so glad you could make it. We were just happy to have an opportunity To pay tribute to your sister. Ok  lets get this doll and tony show on the road - I have a 4:00 eyelash tint.  - who had the latte? Oh, thank god. coffee. Hello. hi. Everybody, thank you so much for coming. um... God, there's so much to say about Penny Meadows. She was part of the "mode" family. Excuse me. sorry. Could we maybe not make blended drinks while people are talking? Thank you. Uh, so even though we all didn't know her... The--the way we wanted to know her... We'll miss her. Is there anyone else who'd like to share their thoughts? I have something I'd like to say. Good. I'm saddened, as everyone is, By the sudden death of Penny Meadows. The only way to make... sense of this tragedy Is to ensure that her legacy lives on. That will be my goal As the newest feature editor at "mode" magazine. What?! no way. that's my job. - this news you lose Betty  - I did this news I went after her job the second she died. oh. Is this still about my sister?! You can stare all you want, Marc. I'm not giving in. Daniel gave me this promotion. And wilhelmina gave me the promotion. Yeah. aren't you going to "vogue"? I passed when Willie reminded me How much I was needed at "mode," Which everyone here agrees with. yeah. How could you be on his side? Amanda, I took you in when you had nowhere to live. That's because you wanted me for your ponzi scheme. You mean the Ponzi Scheme where I paid your rent - you went out shopping? - Yeah, I want my money back. Scram. It seems that the only thing that we can agree on Is that you're both qualified for the job. Unfortunately, there's only one position as editor. So here's what we're gonna do-- We're making copies of Penny's hard drive-- All her research on the Yves Saint Laurent article. you'll take what she's done and prepare it for publication. Whoever does best gets the job. The loser gets fired. - The loser stays an assistant. - not as interesting, but ok. Any questions? No. I guess we're on. We certainly are. It's from Laguardia. - The airport? - The school of the performing arts. I can't open it. I can't. "thank you for your application." "unfortunately, we're unable to accommodate you For the upcoming school year." What? Sorry, mijo. - They're idiots! - Hey, the good news is, it says You can try out again next year. I don't want to go next year. Yeah, I know, Justin, but look at this way-- You know how many times I ran for city council before I won? Things that are worth it, sometimes, they--they take time. I... I-I just wanted to go now. You're gonna win this. I wouldn't have agreed to it if you weren't. There isn't a chance in hell Marc is gonna turn in a piece better than yours. I hope so. Is that your family? No, Amanda, they're birds. And apparently the only thing on Penny's hard drive. Where are her notes? Well, they wouldn't be on there. Penny always worked from home. She only ever came in if she needed Those ugly yellow pads from the supply closet Or to take a quick whore's bath in the ladies room. Thank you, Amanda. Do you want to get some lunch? So I think most of penny's research Is in her apartment. I was going to go by, see if I can get in. Well, it sounds like you have a good handle on things. So did, uh, Henry and his girlfriend get off okay? I think so. You, uh, see him again before he left? I did, briefly, but it wasn't a big deal. Really? it seemed like a big deal. I saw you. you kissed him. Right here in this park, you kissed him, And I have given you every opportunity To tell me the truth, but you didn't. You've just been lying to me. - I haven't been lying to you, Matt. - maybe not directly. It's not like I said, "hey, Betty, I know you're my girlfriend, I just want to know, have you kissed anyone this week?" 'cause that's not usually a question boyfriends have to ask. It didn't mean anything. I swear. - I-I was just saying good-bye to him. - I don't believe you. Matt, please. Can we just talk about this? That is what I've wanted to do ever since I stood there With my heart in my socks watching you kiss him. Look, don't you know how I feel about you? don't you know that I'd never kiss someone else, ever? I'm sorry. It just happened. it means nothing. - You have to trust me. - How? I opened up to you, I wanted us to move in together, And this is what you do to me? I... Matt. Hilda, I lied to him, and you told me to. But you were protecting his feelings. Yeah, that distinction was kind of lost on him. A year ago, everything was so clear. I wanted my own place in the city. I wanted a promotion. The last thing I wanted was a boyfriend. And now it's all I can think about. Okay, you gotta listen to me. Matt needs time to cool off, and you cannot screw up Something that you've been working for the past few years how am I supposed to think about work right now? Mama, you have to. Focus. No, listen to me, you tell Dave I want those prints on my desk by this afternoon, Or we're taking our business someplace else. It's not negotiable. You're sexy when you get all bossy boots. What? You have been working so hard Taking care of "mode" and me. I thought a romantic meal might force you To take time out to enjoy yourself. Plus, I need your opinion on my dress For the mama awards. What do you think? I think lunch... is gonna have to wait. But it'll get cold. I don't care. it's not negotiable. You're here? No, you're here. I call the apartment! No, no. you can't call the apartment. We're both entitled to the same information. Great. making up rules as we go along. Well, we're both here. we need the research. What have you found? Nothing. just boxes and boxes of menthol cigarettes, Vintage porn, More menthol cigarettes. We are never gonna find anything in here. Nothing except for more of these female jock straps. - Bras, Marc.  - Whatever. I allowed myself to get beat up all through high school So I wouldn't have to handle things like this. God, she really did like beef jerky, didn't she? Oh! that's the other smell on her breath. What are you two dinks doing here? Mindy, hi. How are you? I just had a pap smear, I stepped in poo on the subway, And my sister's dead. how do you think I am? In need of a hug. Betty, hug her. Whoa, whoa, whoa. back off. Got a real lezzie vibe off you the minute I met ya. What? it wasn't enough to ruin my sister's memorial? You have to come in here and wreck her apartment, too? Mindy, we're just looking for anything On your sister's Yves Saint Laurent piece. And we want to put it together and publish it in "mode." For Penny. Our penny. Is this what you're looking for? maybe. Amanda said yellow. - No, no, no. what are you doing?  - no! Penny hated "mode." Now get out! To Penny... Hater of pigeons, lover of vintage porn. Today really has been the worst day. Ugh. Matt hates me, this assignment is a dead end, And I am so mad at daniel. I know. he is such an idiot. What the hell is wrong with Wilhelmina? I know. daniel is such an idiot. it's not like you haven't already given her Your blood, sweat and tears. I have practically cut arteries open for that woman. You know who I think the real idiots are?  The two of you. You're a mean drunk. Seriously. you are such whiners. Not to mention, you are totally letting me down. If one of you freak shows doesn't pull ahead, Then who am I supposed to glom on to? And yes, I bring the pretty and the sparkly... But shockingly, sometimes that's not enough. And, you know, Marc, with your brains, And, betty, with your aztec build, There is nothing the two of you can't do. So what are we supposed to do? I don't know. I'm so drunk... My jockstrap is starting to dig in. I'll be right back. She's right. About what? I didn't follow any of that. Marc, we can do anything. We just have to join forces. What are you thinking? What is this? Our letters of resignation. Resigning? What about the article? - It flew out the window.  - like penny herself. Look, we are both worthy of this position. So we're doing what any good editor should do Presenting you with strong options. - It's either marc  - or betty. Unless you want both of our resignations, You have to decide who gets promoted to editor Of a fashion magazine. A features editor. Of a fashion magazine. - Enough.  - Give us some time to discuss. You are dismissed. That was terrifying. did I seem terrified? I was terrified. I'm still shaking. it was good, though. I feel strangely empowered. Where are you going? To see Matt. wish me luck. Hi. - Can we talk? - I don't know if I'm ready. Matt, please just listen to me. I made a mistake, And I should've just told you what happened, but I didn't, And I'm sorry, and if I could go back and change it, I would, but I can't. All I can tell you is that I love you And I want to be with you. I don't think we should just throw this all away. I have to get to class. Here's a ticket to the mama awards. I hope you'll come. Oh, no. I forgot. have you seen my note cards? Don't tell me You're one of those guys who goes up there all modest, Then has a prepared speech, - like you knew you were gonna win.  - look, you were right. It's a big deal. I mean, think about it. what if we win? I don't want to look like a deer in the headlights. I'm glad it's important to you. You're warm. Your fever's back. Molly I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. No, we're both staying home. I'm gonna go cancel the limo right now. honey, this is your night. And I will not be the reason you miss it. -But it's more - I'll make you a deal. Your award's later in the presentation, right? - Yeah. - So you go, I'll take a nap, And then I'll meet you there in time for your category. Save me a seat. Okay. But I'm having the nurse come by to check on you. Suzuki st. pierre reporting From the mother of all publishing award shows... The mamas. Tensions are high and faces are pulled As we wonder who will go home with a mama And who will go home to feel self-worth With booze, pills, internet sex and trans fats. Or as I call it, thursdays. Looking forward to your big announcement. Oh, look. Somebody's been picking through liz hurley's old rags Oh, my god. He just said I look exactly like liz hurley. Yeah, go with that. And there's evelia avila. I'm sorry. oh, my god! Antonio sabato jr. Aunt betty, didn't you have A dream with him the other night? -J...uh, justin. -what was that dream? it was nothing. Aunt betty, tell him about the hot dog. god, it's good to meet you. Stop. that was fun. Did it cheer you up? Yeah. I mean, I'll never have a career like his Because I didn't get into the performing arts school, -But I could always be a plumber. -justin. Aunt betty, I'm fine. - I'm just happy you brought me here. - betty! Hey, you, betty's son, come with me to the swag room. - I want to get two bags. - okay. I didn't know you were coming tonight, matt. I wasn't. I came to see betty. Everything all right, son? I don't know how I didn't get in. I mean, how do you beat a monologue from "equus" And 16 bars from "les mis"? You're great, kid. they made a mistake. Well, like everyone says, there's always next year. - But the problem is this year, right? - yeah. You're about to start public high school in queens And you're afraid that it's going to suck, right? Pretty much. It might. It's just... I don't always fit in with new people. And I thought that laguardia would have more people... You know, that... Like the same things that I like. Right. Well... this may shock you, But yours truly Is a product of a public high school, And I think I'm pretty great. The trick, I think, is to find your niche. And if you can't find one... Make one. Maybe I have been too hard on her, dad. I mean, she was kissing him good-bye. I should be able to let that go, right? What? Did I ever tell you about my first motorcycle? - Okay. - and I've had a lot of cycles since then, But I never loved any of 'em like I loved that old girl. I get it. I'm fancier, but henry runs like stink. All I'm saying is, You will always be competing with that first motorcycle, Especially if it's shoving its tongue Down your girlfriend's throat. I don't know what to do. I know. I've been there. But... I let myself Just get good and mad And then I channeled that into work. It made me what I am today. I don't really have a job anymore. You could. Dvds? where are the hermes? where are the chanel watches? Dvds, seriously? they're not even on blu-ray? This should be a nice treat for you then. Daniel's acceptance speech. So he'll be tongue-tied, and you'll take over. See? I'm still your assistant for the moment. I do my job. Nice. Wilhelmina, we need to talk. Hey, "air buddies." - What is it, daniel? - well, we've been avoiding this all day. - We need to make a choice-- marc or betty? - okay. marc. - Wilhelmina, come on. - you're right. We are dealing with the fate of two people's lives. There's only one fair way to do it. You want to flip a coin? Look, they're both equally qualified, And neither of us are willing to budge. You have a better idea? Heads, it's marc. tails, betty. - I guess that's it.  - Yes, that's it And the nominees for photographer of the year are... Patrick demarchelier for "american vogue," oh, it's happening. I hope it's not annie leibovitz. I mean, I love her, but I'm bored. Betty, can I talk to you? Yeah. I'll be right back. And the mama goes to... Annie leibovitz for "vanity fair." So about the job... Daniel, it's...It's fine. I know it was a hard decision and-- It's yours. You're our newest features editor. What?! aah! Oh, my god! that's amazing! Thank you! thank you! thank you! aah! You scared the hell out of me. -I couldn't really help myself. -my god. this is wonderful. I'm just glad you're not going too far. And the nominees For fashion magazine issue of the year are... There's your category. let's go. "elle" for the spring fashion issue... "gentlemen's quarterly," april 2008 issue... And finally, "mode" magazine for their wedding issue. And the mama goes to... "mode" magazine. Uh, thank you, everyone. Oh, uh, sorry. Maybe I should, uh... This award means so much... So much to me personally. I mean, it's not just the end product Of a-a... a lot of hard work. It's, um... it's a symbol... A symbol of love. You know, sometimes... We're fated to meet certain people Who, uh, can change our lives, People who really make a difference. They make you a better person, They push you to grow. I'd just really like to share this award with everyone Who did this with me. Thank you. Thanks, betty. hey, where did molly go? I haven't seen her. She was right next to you. No, I don't think so. Betty, she was standing right next to you. Daniel, I didn't see her. are you okay? Yeah. um... I'm gonna go. Great speech, wilhelmina. Speaking of speeches, When are you announcing you're stepping down? I'm not going to step down. then I think it's time hartley knew about your choice Not to have his baby. I already know, and it's none of your business. Cal and I have been talking, And we decided We need to reevaluate your role in the company. I still don't believe it. Okay, we got the champagne and the cake ready. We're very proud of you, mi amor. Why aren't you home yet? yeah. There's just something I wanted to do first-- Stop by my new office. You're getting everything you wanted. I am. I'll see you at home. Matt... I'm so glad you're here. I mean, can you believe... betty, wait. I have to ask you something. Okay. Do you still love him? So you do. Matt... look, henry was my first love. I guess there's always gonna be A part of me that does, But... but that's a part of my past. I mean... Don't you feel that way about your first love? The thing is, betty... You're my first love. You told me all I needed to hear. What are you saying? I'm saying... we're over. What--what, that's it? you're just gonna walk away? I'm never gonna see you again? No, you'll see me... every day. My dad offered me a job at "mode," And I'm gonna take it. I'm your new boss. I have never felt more alone. It appears that my position at my own company Is being undermined. My company is all I have. How can I help? Well, the only way I can fix it Is to get enough money to push out cal hartley. And the only person I know with that kind of money... Is the man who stole it Connor owens. You want him alive? As long as I get the money, I really don't care.
