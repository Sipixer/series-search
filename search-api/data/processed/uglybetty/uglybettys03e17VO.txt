They lied to me my entire life about being adopted Now you know me I'm not the one to hold a grudge But I will never speak to my parents as long as I may live - What? - Nothing, it's just really pretty when you're dramatic The bad news is our insurance doesn't cover us for a loss of this magnitude Oh .. So what's the good news? There is no good news Oh good god! Do you even know how the good news/bad news setup works If you're looking for good news, why don't you ask your boyfriend Connor Well you stole his fiancee no wonder he wanted to steal from us You were dating him, how could you not know what he was doing? Oh so it's my fault now? Stop! Bickering isn't going to solve anything Yes, stop bickering Daniel Thousands of people are going to lose their jobs if we don't fix this Well easier said than done Claire, what's your bright idea How about a federal bailout? Oh of course, Daniel and I will just march down to Washington And beg the government to save our magazine You don't have to march anywhere They're already here Federal government sends panel to New York City to consider print media bailout Mum, this is genius You may wanna rethink your wardrobe Wilhelmina We're gonna have a little trouble convincing them we need money wearing mink It's not mink darling, it's chinchilla Whatever it is, you look like a rich bitch Matt, you didn't have to come all the way to Queens just to see me home Well considering how I left my wallet at work and made you pay for dinner I could use your brownie points Oh sorry, don't mind me So you must be Betty's new friend Matt I'm her sister Betty you didn't tell me you have a sister - What? - Yes I did I'm kidding, she talks about you all the time I have a terrible sense of humor It grows on you, or it doesn't - It's nice to meet you Hilda - You too Thanks again for dinner Wait a minute, why was he thanking you for dinner?

Stop Okay maybe he's not perfect but.. The more time I spend with him, the more I like him and .. I don't know, just all this craziness at work is really giving me perspective I have a wonderful job and a great family and .. A guy that I like, can't I just enjoy this moment, please? Mum, Mum! I found this with the mail Honey, what is it? It's from the landlord This document shall serve a termination of your rental agreement Please be advised you have until the end of the month to vacate the premises Oh my god! We're being evicted I hate doing this to you Ignacio Then don't, we've been living in this house for 25 years Mr. Di Lena, this is our home I mean there's gotta be something we can work out right? The truth is I'm having some money problems I'm gonna have to sell to my idiot nephew Sao, couldn't we rent from him? He's turning it into a recording studio cause that's a good investment A recording studio? But I have my business here too My salon, what am I supposed to do? I wish I could help, but unless you can match my nephew's offer buy the house yourselves Yes!

Oh god, this is the lowest moment of my life Straight tote across town, come on it's gonna be fun - One please - Metro cards or quarters only Do you think I carry quarters? I don't know whether to laugh or cry Can you break a 50? Thank you! Ok, the loan officer said that we do qualify for an FHA loan So what does that mean? It means we only have to put down 5% before the end of the month 15 thousand dollars Betty, I don't have that much money saved up Yeah but if we combine all of our savings This is my responsibility, I'm not taking money from my children Dad stop, stop being so stubborn This is our house and we wanna stay Why don't we just ask Daniel for the money? Justin! Daniel has his own money problems And I would never ever ask him for something like that Oh! But Marc and Amanda still owe me the security deposit on my apartment That's a start I could offer more sodas at my salon Smear some yoghurt on an old lady's mug and call it a facial Yeah! See? Come on papi it's our house, our memories We should at least try, right? Come on! Alright Excuse me sir, you're in my personal space So if you're fond of your thumbs I suggest you take one large step backwards Thank you very much I thought you were gonna dress down so it looks like we need money This is what I wear to the gym For god's sake, hold on to the pole No way, I don't know who touched that thing You're such a baby We better get that bailout Agh why would anyone want to have a baby They're so expensive I know right?

We didn't get the bailout Betty I just blew our last shot at saving the company What? No but I thought .. Meade is done Betty .. And I'm sorry, but I didn't write you that check Here, take it What happened, where is Marc? I thought Wilhelmina wanted him to bond with the baby He just needed it to hook up with this guy - What? - Oh yeah, babies are THE hot accessory in the gay world Small dogs, totally 5 minutes ago Well he likes you Well I did carry him for 9 months Kinda hard not to feel connected You have to be careful with some things, Remind myself that I'm not his mother What do you mean? Well, you're adopted, you should know more than anyone Your real mother's not just the one who gave birth to you It's the one who raises you and tuck you in at night And yells at you when you miss your curfew uhoh, you wanna help me change the diaper? No No notes, no explanation, just 10,000 dollars Doesn't that seem so weird? Yes, really weird I mean what would you do? If I get a check like that? I don't know, cash it? Dance for joy? I can't dance by the way, please don't ever ask me It's just .. Maybe I'm overthinking it Oh thank you Thank goodness I've brought my wallet today I know it's a miracle uhoh, it's work Can you just hold on one second? Hello? So without the government's help The company has no money to move forward As of tomorrow, Meade publications goes dark I can't believe this is happening I told you not to flaunt your wealth Oh please, I suppose you've started making bathtub gin to economize? When you start ordering your botox from Mexico we'll talk They were right The bailout committee We don't deserve that money What are you babbling about? Well do we really expect some unemployed auto worker to save us? It's not fair So what, we throw in the towel? No, we clean up our own mess It's our name on this building, it's our responsibility What do you propose? I'm gonna start liquidating my personal assets The house in Amagansett, the town house, stocks, art Everything I've got I should be able to raise enough to keep the company afloat Keep everyone on payroll at least for a few months You do realize that if the company doesn't turn around You will lose everything I know Daniel, I don't have the same kind of resources you do But I'll contribute as much as I can I have a son now and it's his company too Your father would be proud you've taken this off You are very very brave son Yeah Thanks mum Sorry about that You're ready to go? Matt what is this? Is it some kind of a joke? It's not a joke So this is you And you weren't gonna tell me You were just gonna let me believe that some stranger gave it to me?

Well, well my family is sort of, really wealthy Okay, and you weren't gonna tell me that either Well, it never came up in a conversation Betty, please don't be angry Look, it's not that much money Yes, it is No, not when you get billions of dollars laying around I'm sorry, did you just say billions?
