(chuckles) so you did. look, we had a wonderful time in the swiss alps for two weeks, but now it's time to get back to work, which means we have to try harder to hide it, starting with, uh... this? mm, it is a bit suspicious, isn't it? suspicious? even the "special" boy in the mail room could put the two of us together. what's that? all you need to know is that it's expensive, illegal and will even out your tan lines. you're not allergic to panda, are you? you saw nothing. uh, well, actually-- you saw nothing. oh! oh, oh, oh, oh. yes, yes. nothing! no, no, no, no.

(chuckle well, dr. farber works in the <i>meade</i> wing of the hospital. it's not gonna cost you anything. hey, guys! i've got some good news. oh, good. us, too. talked to dr. steve. he said it's probably just a cold, and <i>papi's</i> fine. um, what did he do, just listen to his chest, take some blood samples? no. we didn't go in. we just talked to him on the phone. (coughing and hacking) i'm fine. hey, do you hear a bluebird? it's night. it's winter. i don't hear anything. well, maybe we should go and check, you know, just in case? hilda, i thought we were gonna talk about you taking that job. i have it under control, betty. dr. steve said <i>papi</i> is fine. it's a mild cough. it hasn't moved to his chest. if it gets worse, then i take him in. but you haven't even had a second to take him in to the doctor, and apparently, you couldn't finish a single thing on my list. sorry, betty, i thought things like "de-linting his sweaters" could wait. what is that you didn't give him his pills for today? yeah, he can't take them before he eats. it upsets his stomach. well, then why don't-- why don't-- just wanted a little more tea. uh... oh, i think the bird went around that way. oh, yeah. crazy bird! (bird squawks) look, claire meade got us an appointment with her cardiologist tomorrow in the city. okay, all right. so i'm supposed to give up my job with the quinceaÑEra? we still need the money. got my tea. oh, good. i think i heard that bird out front. i might not do things the way that <i>you</i> want me to, but you can't be betty bossypants when you're off at work all day. well, you know what, hilda? i only have to be betty bossypants when <i>nothing</i> gets done around here. and don't call me betty bossypants. well, then stop trying to control everything. look, you don't want to take papi to the city? fine. i'll do it. i'll take over. you'll what? i'll take over with <i>papi.</i> you don't wanna help? i'll just find a way to do it all by myself. oh, i would like to see you try. i will. fine. fine! -==http://www.ragbear.com==- ³óÅ®±´µÙ µÚÈý¼¾µÚ12¼¯</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËid Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËid Ê±¼äÖá£º¼Ó·¹µÄ²ËÖí  well, i guess there is something everyone can agree on. dr. farber is an excellent doctor, <i>papi.</i> mr. suarez, how are you feeling? just a little chilly. is there some reason it has to be so cold in here? yes. now i've reviewed your chart. i'd like to run some tests. dr. steve was pretty sure it's just a cough. two weeks after a quadruple bypass, you can never be too careful. yeah, and, <i>papi,</i> hilda only spoke to dr. steve on the phone. on the phone--terrific. that's how i order chinese food. (chuckles) breathe. (inhales and exhales) all right. again. all right. i want an x-ray to check for fluid in the lungs, an e.k.g., an echo, and draw some blood. c.b.c., check for dressler's? yeah. dressler's? inflammation of the pericardium. you did the right thing, bringing your father in. who's next? see? aren't you glad we came in? my butt is cold. (connor) you were a killer in there. i'm continuously amazed by you. well, that makes the two of us. (chuckles) marc, don't just stand there like a gay flagpole. we want to celebrate. go get something bubbly and expensive. yeah, it's what i live for. how you convinced the guerlain people to incase their ad buy by 6% in this market... well, you said the advertisers would never do it, and i saw it as a challenge. well, maybe when we meet with the jaeger-lecoultre people this afternoon, i might get them to increase <i>their</i> ad buy by, say... 7%. what about eight? how about nine? or maybe... ten? yes. i want you to give me 10%. ahem. collette! klaus! other klaus! you're early. (laughs nervously) (swiss-french accent) jaeger-lecoultre has put us on a tight schedule, so... we were hoping that wilhelmina could see us now. oh, it's funny. you'd think people who work for a watch company would be precisely on time. (laughs) follow me. you know what? it's an american tradition to circle the building three times before a meeting. sometimes four. well, it's a good thing we got him in, because dr. farber's running a bunch of tests. what tests? is <i>papi</i> okay? yeah, but two weeks after a quadruple bypass, you can never be too careful. (call waiting beeps) oh, hilda, that's work. can i call you back? work? wait a minute. don't tell me you're leaving <i>papi</i> there alone. because i am up to my ears in teenagers right now. i cannot just run off. no, hilda, i told you, i can handle it. look, i'll stay here with <i>papi.</i> i'll call you with the results. okay? bye. amanda? hi, betty. some guy from a photo lab called and said you messengered your phone bill to him. (gasps) if he pays it, can i send him our other bills? what? s. meade, can i have that back? (betty gasps) if daniel's photos went to suzuki, then everything's gonna go to the wrong place. amanda, i need your help. and i would totally help you, but i'm a little busy covering daniel's desk like you asked me to. i know, amanda, but i'm at the hospital. i can't leave. (gasps) oh, my god. is it your heart? no, it's my dad. haven't we had this conversation? i know, betty, but these things get passed down. they're <i>generic.</i> look, i can't leave my father, so i need your help. will you help me track down some of these letters? okay, fine, what do you need me to do? marc, throw those people out of the conference room. i need to use it for the jaeger-lecoultre meeting. actually, i'm... in a good mood. i'll throw them out myself. about that... uh, collette and the klauses have already come and gone. what? they came early? well... why didn't you come get me? because you were busy snorkeling in the great barrier reef? so i was otherwise occupied. you should've stalled them. i tried, but that's not the point. i'm worried, you know, that, you know... will... you know? marc, mince when you walk, not when you talk. what? i don't want it getting out that the most talented woman in fashion is missing meetings because her head is... elsewhere. oh, because i missed one meeting with them? our swiss friends will not leave new york without an audience with me. i'll call them. it'll all be fine, you'll see. get, uh, klaus on the phone or... klaus. betty. uh, how's your dad? he's getting tests done, and they won't let me see him, so in the meantime, i've been dealing with a little work snafu. there was a work snafu, huh? it's all taken care of. amanda helped me. oh. that's--that's great. the only thing left is something i was hoping i can get done tomorrow. i have to get suzuki st. pierre to swap out your vacation photos for the new picture of the halston dress. wait, wait. suzu-suzuki st. pierre... has my vacation photos? oh, no. you didn't ask me to print out those type of photos, did you? again? coming up, more life-ruining gossip, but first... betty, i have to tl you something. i'm seeing molly. what, connor's mol? look, she was with me in st. barths. wait. <i>connor's</i> molly? look, it's not what you think, okay? we are actually in love. daniel, you're in love with connor's molly? could you stop calling her that? they stopped seeing each other before we got together. well, does connor know about you and... no. this could be a huge disaster. i promised molly i was gonna keep this a secret. you have to get those photos back for me. now? betty, yes, now. but, daniel, i'm at the hospital. um, i have to wait-- betty, please, there has to be something you can do. (sighs) okay, all right, i'll find a way to get the photos back. i promise. (beep) (beep) (woman) dr. maddox, dr. chester maddox, please go to the pharmacy. dr. chester maddox to the pharmacy. hold it right there, missy. no visitors during medical tests. oh, i know. i just-- i have to tell my dad i have a work emergency that i gotta go deal with. well, he's gonna be in there for at least four hours. how you spend your time is up to you. okay, well, can you just tell him that i'll be back as soon as possible? yeah, okay. okay. okay. you can do this, betty. no. but--but why not? pictures of daniel meade having an affair with the fiancéE of his c.f.o.-- in my business, we call that news, honey. but she's not even his fiancéE anymore. they broke up before she went on vacation with daniel. so see? no scandal. or even <i>juicier</i> scandal. he stole her, and they ran away on a sexy caribbean getaway. all right, suzuki, can you just do this as a favor to me? do i know you? betty suarez. we've met, like, a thousand times. you've interviewed me... sorry. i've been working on this story for months. really? 'cause these pictures literally just fell into your lap. just good, solid journalism is what i say. and i'm going with the story tomorrow. so good-bye, benny. (normal voice) what are you doing? shh! marc, i was just trying to borrow these. b-b-b-b-b-buh! marc, what?! (connor and wilhelmina laugh) oh. hello, marc... marc's <i>friend.</i> actually, it's-- hmm. marc's friend is fine. oh, my god. are they... no, they are absolutely not. (laughs) okay. but you have to swear not to say anything to anyone. (giggles) (gasps) swear. ow. marc, you're hurting me. am i? not really. ohh. but i get it. you're serious. i'm not gonna say anything to anyone. god, why are you being so weird anyway? (grunts) why must god test the pretty people so much more than the regular lumpy people? this is supposed to be my year. i got into y.e.t.i. willie is co-editor-in-chief. i just don't want her star to wane before i have a chance to cash in on having worked for her. you know what i think? good things come to those who wait. oh. plus it helps being pretty. take me. i have always wanted to work daniel's desk, and now check me o. (telephone ringing) do you need to get that? no, it's fine. it's just i've never had to deal with a boss who cared more about sex than work. actually, maybe this is what working for daniel is like. why are you looking at me? be-- oh, marc, there you are. i need your help. i need yours. when daniel blows off a meeting to go sleep with some floozy, what do you do? what? daniel doesn't do that. yeah, and this is my real nose, which it totally is. okay, so when daniel gets "distracted by life," what do you do? i just like to see those moments as career opportunities. you know, a chance to step it up, show daniel what i can do. why, is wilhelmina... (scoffs) no, no, not at all. why would you even say that? but she's a woman. she has needs. get over, it betty. grow up. ahem. what did you want? i need to get a gift for suzuki. i accidentally sent him something that i need back, and i just--i have to do it fast so i can get back to the hospital and my dad, and anyway, i thought you could help me. a gift for suzuki st. pierre? he's a serious journalist. he's not gonna take a bribe. you need to blackmail him. what? bribery, blackmail--that's not at i was talking about. ll, too bad, 'cause his ex works at meade, and that bitch'll dish. fabian? fabian, hi! you don't know me, uh, but you might be able to help me with a problem. i understand you dated suzuki st. pierre? i can't talk about that. but i thought you said he'd dish. not if you approach him like that. people who have dated celebrities are really secretive about it. hello, i should know. you've never dated a celebrity. as far as you know. (muffled voice) jeremy piven. okay, he goosed you on the subway once, amanda. you talk about it constantly. (normal voice) the point is, you have to make him talk. go put the heat on, sister. ah! fabian, you have to... help me. um, please? um, no, i don't. you tell her what she needs to know, or i will tell everyone you have ambiguous genitalia. oh, yeah, like a ken doll, and that's the kind of stank that don't wash off. is this suzuki's address? ow! um, no. suzuki st. pierre does not live in jersey. well, who lives here? oh, betty, thank god i reached you. it is teenage chaos here, but i just wanted to check and see how <i>papi's</i> doing. um, he's fine. the nurse says he's fine. oh, good. can i talk to him? no. he, uh, they won't let anybody see him while he's getting his tests done. oh. yeah, i get it. i get it. i'm just worried about him, that's all. listen, betty, thank you. i know you're crazy juggling dad and--and work and everything. hilda-- (woman) hilda, my hair! i'm coming! betty, let me call you back, all right? but keep me posted. okay, bye. okay, bye. (beep) guess my photos aren't all that important in the big picture. oh, they are, they are. i just have a lot on my plate right now. so what is it you're hoping to find here? i have no idea. "byron wu"? daniel! you're not supposed to just go through people's mail. no, we want to find out who lives here. who's byron wu? i don't know. maybe... suzuki's boyfriend? (whispers) come here. (man) hey, hey! nice hustle today, kiddos. now let's get dressed get inside, and i'll go grill some brats. all right. you heard your father. (lowered voice) betty, is that suzuki? (lowered voice) that's his wife and kids? hi, suzuki. or should we say "byron"? oh, crap. (suzuki) hit it, hit it, hit it! whoo! that's my boy. so when i graduated from columbia j-school, you know, i wanted to be woodward, bernstein. but the only jobs available were britney this, angelina that. but isn't that the stuff you love? it's the stuff suzuki loves. wait. so suzuki st. pierre is made-up? you think "fashion buzz" would go near a guy like me? i mean, look at me. (effeminate voice) but as a fabulous, bitchy queen, the fashion world welcomed me with open, well-toned arms. that's creepy. byron? don't forget to take the garbage out when you're done. (normal voice) yeah, no prob. so down to brass tacks. daniel, bessie-- betty. betty. you know my secret. what do you want? well-- we are not here to blackmail you. we're not? no, but we do need your help. those photos could destroy people's lives, <i>byron.</i> you have your own secret. you should understand. (boy) you want me to try for it? (laughs) soft! (boy) i didn't think so. (daniel) that was nice work, betty. so, daniel, how long do you plan on keeping this whole molly thing a secret? i don't know. sometimes honesty isn't always the best choice, i guess. i understand that. it's just... secrets kind of have a way of getting out. don't even bother with klaus, either one of them. collette's the one with the real power. the ice queen of lake geneva. well, i have a feeling you'll be able to melt her. just, uh, flirt with her a little bit. you'd be comfortable with that? of course. it's just business. well, i'm not sure i'd be able to pull that off. i can't just turn it on for anybody. really? you've flirted with me a million times. that's because i meant it, because it was you. so we have been waiting for... ten minutes. (clears throat) well, perhaps if wilhelmina had one of your beautiful, elegant, timeless, handcrafted watches... we'll come back later. wait. since wilhelmina is obviously delayed why don't i take you through our proposal? you speak french? actually, that's all the french i know, but if you give me just a minutes, i know that i can show you why "mode" and jaeger-lecoultre are meant to be together. excuse me. where's my father? he left. he left? but you said he'd be in there for four hours. i guess he was done earlearly. well, where did he go? i'm sorry. i don't know what to tell you. (beep) what? hilda? i think i might have lost dad. all right. somehow we have to find a way to get through a whole day without <i>that</i> always happening. nothing wrong with creating a little anticipation for our swiss friends. well, it looks to me like your assistant's doing a pretty good job of entertaining 'em. and, oh, this is the best part. you're gonna love this. this is very exciting. so what we do is we should-- ah, bonjour, <i>mes amis.</i> bonjour. ah, collette. mwah. mwah. mwah. mwah. klaus! klaus. mm. i had no idea you were here, which is particularly tragic, since i specifically told my assistant to call me as soon as you all arrived. this is... (singsong voice) beginning to be a problem. (chuckles, normal voice) so if it happens again, it'll be back to spritzing perfume at the makeup counter. (laughs) that will be all, marc. nice to look at, but you could sit a picasso behind his desk to do the same job. (collette laughs) how could you have lost him? you promised me you weren't gonna leave him. i know, but there was this emergency at work, and i might've maybe left for just a minute. betty, i-- i know, i know. you're mad at me. i'm mad at me, too. but can we just try and find <i>papi?</i> oh, look, there's dr. farber. dr. farber! hi! do you know where my dad is? yeah, see, my sister sort of lost him. uh, i talked to your dad maybe... maybe two hours ago, but once his tests are completed, he's free to go. and you have no idea where he went? can't be far. two weeks after major surgery, he's not gonna be running a marathon. (laughs) look, i wouldn't worry about him. his tests came back normal. he's gonna be totally fine. oh! that's great. thank you. not a problem. did you hear that? papi's gonna be fine. yeah. so he didn't have to come to the hospital at all. hilda, where are you going? the doctor said papi's gonna be fine! yeah, i heard what he said. well, then what is wrong with you? he was already fine... until you came in and decided we had to take him to some fancy manhattan doctor. and i thought for a second, okay, maybe betty's right. maybe we need to be more nervous. but you got me scared for no reason. well, what was i supposed to do? if something's wrong, then we have to know about it. i'll tell you what you could ?? you could have stopped trying so hard to control everything that you scared me half to death. hilda, if there is a problem, then we can't just ignore it. you always do this. and you always make me feel like everything i do is wrong, like if i don't do things your way, then i don't love <i>papi.</i> when have i ever said that? it's not what you say, it's how you act. this is exactly like when mom was sick. everything had to be your way. hilda, when mom got sick, you disappeared. you went off with santos or wherever, and i stayed home and took care of <i>papi.</i> like i'm doing now. you're in manhattan. you got your job. you got your apartment. where are you? where am i? i am here! i have been here every day! do you have any idea what i have had to give up so that i could be at home helping out with-- you want to talk about sacrifice, betty? i live at home. i work at home. and now with <i>papi</i> sick, i gotta fight you to take one job. well, i need your help. i guess i can't do it all by myself. yeah, i guess you cat. what? you know what bothers me the most, betty? for all your lecturing... you weren't even there. i was the one in ambulance. (crying) i was the one-- i was holding his hand, and--and i thought he was gonna die. and you know where you were? you were in the city. you were at some... party. that is not fair, hilda. don't you think it kills me that i wasn't there? i think about it every single day. it's justin. hello? mom? grandpa's home. okay. <i>papi's</i> fine. he's at home. all right. love u. "bluebird"? (chuckles) come on. i'm not stupid. look, i know you're fighting, but what i can't live with is that you're fighting because of me. papi, honestly-- papi, that's not true. please. now you both are strong, intelligent, capable women, but you can't do it all. so... i've decided. i'm hiring a nurse to help take some of the burden. what? what? we cannot afford that. and you're not a burden. stop. we can afford it. i went to the medicaid office and found out that they'll help pay for a rt-time nurse. help? what's that supposed to mean? it means we'll manage. look, i... i can't control what happens to me. but i can control some things, and i won't come between you two. you could use a trim. i'm sorry i wasn't there that night, hilda. if i could go back and change it, i would. i don't know what i would have done... a little gift from our new friends at jaeger-lecoultre. we landed the account. nice work. great. now i won't be late to any meetings. uh, i'm sorry. did i miss something? you're my assistant. you took a hit for me. i brought you a fancy gift. i expect gratitude, not attitude. i'm sorry, willie... but that was humiliating for me. i was doing really well in there-- it doesn't matter how well you were doing. they didn't come here to be pitched by some assistant. they came here to be pitched by wilhelmina slater. well, maybe i wouldn't have had to step in if you hadn't been o-- if i hadn't what? it's just that i thought after four years, i might be able to-- getting thrown under the bus to make me look good is part of your job... unless, of course, you'd like to find another one. no, i don't want another job. i... never mind. you're right. (whispers) thanks. hey, sweetie. okay, what's the matter? so you know how we dodged a bullet with our vacation photos? uh-huh, yeah. look at "page six," behind heidi and spencer. you're cut out of the picture, but i'm not. are you done with that? i'm off. lunch with tom ford. oh, but, uh, proenza schouler are coming to meet with you at noon. (sighs) those ad meetings are so tiresome. why don't you take it? if you think you can handle it. of course, i can always-- give my love to tom and his chest hair. cable we can totally just steal from upstairs. oh, and we both have cell phones, so we don't need a landline. plus i gave that number out to too many weirdos anyway. my god, we have so many. there's electric and gas and maintenance and bergdorf's. god, it is so hard to know which one to sacrifice, you know? mm-hmm. amanda? i have to tell you something. you're moving out. how'd you know? because your family needs you right now... and you're good like that. yeah. * a dream of togetherness * turned into a brighter mess * * a faint sign, my spoken best * ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é -==http://www.ragbear.com==-
