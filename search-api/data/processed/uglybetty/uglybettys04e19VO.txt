I just wanna get my money and go home. Okay, okay. Well, let's think about this. There's always a solution. I suppose I could buy your shares. I mean, I'm--I'm used to dealing with the meades.

But this has been really fun. sure. Thank you. Ooh. Have a good day, guys. Hi, hilda. Okay, you, too. Betty, justin's got a boyfriend! Meet me at your place at 1:00. Wow. Pretty good arm. Although, I probably could have done the same thing, You know, if I warmed up a little. He is not in his right mind. This is not the boy I've gotten to know. Mom, you've known him a couple of weeks. You sound pretty naive. I mean, even wilhelmina saw this coming. Wilhelmina? What did she say? She said it was gonna come to money, whichs Why I offered him a check when we were at the club. You offered him money? Yeah. Apparently, not enough. And you're taking advice from wilhelmina? Doesn't that seem like a dumb thing to do? No, it doesn't, not when she's right. Uh, it's trista. Sorry, I gotta take this. Hey. Marc, just give spencer a chance. You will love him. He's like me, but with junk. I can't, mandy. I am still grieving over troy. I don't think I'll ever be able to be in a relationship again. He's like me with big junk. Why am I getting an e-mail from ignacio suarez? Oh, my god. Ah. Well... I like the enthusiasm, But... Is this all a little bit too much? Yeah, it is. Listen to her. Come on. Can't we wait until after the wedding at least? This is one of the most important things That will ever happen to justin, And he needs to know that we accept him. We told him to come here after class, And when he walks in, we're all gonna shout... we're know you're gay, and that's okay! Okay, so maybe we put that in the card. Well, justin does like a good party And... Colorful things. That's the gay flag. Gays do not have a favorite color. They like 'em all. Mija, look at all these groups they have--</i> P.F.L.A.G., g.L.S.E.N. And everything came in this fun starter kit. And look, a strawberry lip balm. Oh. This is so gonna bite me in the ass. Ay, please.</i> Stop. Stop this right now. they like to make entrances. Have you people lost your minds? You cannot do this. Why not? We're fine with it. It's not about you being fine with it. It's about justin being fine with it. Really, you know, I expected you to know better. Well... why do I always have to know better? Thanks. Thank you. You saved my life. Would you listen to the man? Come on. He's... He's an expert. What is with this family? I mean, it is one thing to be accepting... We're just trying to help. If justin is ever gonna have Loving and sustaining relationships, It is important for him to feel the acceptance of his family. Th-that's a pretty big statement. No, it is true. It is in everything that we have read. Just because your mother doesn't accept your homosexuality Does not mean that I won't have a la-- Does not mean that one won't have a lasting relationship. But I do accept it. Yeah. Marc, who are we talking about? Uh, it's right here. Oh, just... Don't believe everything you read, okay? Justin will come out when justin wants to come out, And then you will all act surprised, And you will never ever mention this hideous idea. Oh! Oh! They like their exits, too. I'll go out with spencer. really? Yeah. Who says I can't have a healthy relationship? Oh. Uh, he might have just been thinking casual sex, But he's coming to the wedding, So you guys can totally figure it out. * * I'm a fashion film * * 'cause I want it all * Higher. Nice. Chin up. Chin up. Make sure you get them here, from here up-- I don't know how, And I don't know why, But I know you got to tyler. This has your stink all over it. Oh, claire, have you escaped from your handlers again Or have they allowed you a senior outing? This boy is an alcoholic. He is troubled. Isn't that the pickled lush calling the kettle black? You bitch! Hey. Ow! wha--you rotten... God, you--you-- get- -you get over here! You crazy-- aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, no, you don't! Aah! pull 'em apart! aah! You see that, everyone? She attacked me! Stay away from my son! Hey, what are you doing here? I was just about to leave. Is everything okay? I'm not getting that job. What? Yeah, apparently my old boss called Angave me a bad recommendation. Wilhelmina? Nope. Daniel, you cost him his job! When I see you making such a big mistake? No, you don't! And who said it was a mistake? You are moving backwards. You have so much ahead of you. Oh, my god! Talk about moving backwards. What are you doing with trista? Aren't you past that? That is so completely different. You know what? Let's just make a deal. I will stay out of your personal life, And you stay out of mine! I have some nail polish remover In the bathroom. I heard you can get a buzz off that. Don't go through my things. Claire's not gonna give me anything. be patient. She will. Yeah, well, why should she? I'm nothing to her. I'm just some stupid piece of white trash That's here ruining her perfect life. Tyler, pull it together. I know you're angry. You have every right to be. But don't take it out on yourself. Channel it! Channel it towards claire meade. Ugh, what a crap day! So we both have the same one. That's cool, right? Totally. Yeah. Um, I love it. Me, too. Uh, my mom won't really let up About, uh, you coming to the wedding. Well, I will, if you want me to. It's okay if you don't. I-I do. I do. I just-- I feel like I'm gonna be under some sort of microscope. I get it. 's okay, but, you know, if I do go, No one would have to know anything. I just like hanging out with you. you know what? You should come. You sure? Yeah. Cool. I-is it dumb to have the same bracelet? Yes, I totally hate the color. Wanna take it back? Yeah. Let's do it. You know, my face isn't actually perfect. But it works on me. Do you know, If I hadn't spilled my drink on you at the revlon party, We wouldn't have met? Yeah, I know. It was a real blessing in the skies. Wait. "blessing in the skies. " does that sound weird? No, no. That's right. "bleing in the skies." The party was outside. right. I wonder what you would say if we met inside? 'cause, you know, there'no sky. irregardless, trista, we should probably get going. Wait, did I just say "irregardless"? Is that a word? I don't know. Do you like my earrings? Yeah. Great news! I got the job. Daniel must have called them back. Oh, good. I ew he would do the right thing. Yeah, well, thank you. Come in. Great. Wow, betty, this place is amazing. Hey, do you wanna go celebrate? I thought maybe we could go To that thai restaurant we used to love. Oh, it's not there anymore. Oh. Well. Henry, can we talk a-- "affordable london apartments." Are you thinking about taking the job? No. No, no. I was just curious. I w--no. yeah, well, I mean, if you're thinking about taking it, I'd just kinda like to know. No, I'm not. I'm not. I-I was just looking. It's just a really great opportunity. It's sort of hard to let go of, so... Well, why are you letting it go? It's not 'cause of me, is it? No. Because I do not want to be the one That keeps you from living your life. If you want to take that job, then you should. You should take it. You should travel the world if you want to. Henry it's not you. It's... My sister's getting married, and papi's gonna be alone,</i> And there's all this stuff with justin. It's just- it isn't the right time. And... It's not the right time for us, either. You feel that way, too? Yes. It would've been nice, though, right? To have what we had three years ago? Yeah. But it's not three years ago. It definitely isn't. I have a wet rice cake in my pocket. Ew. Uh, listen, you still like thai food, right? Yeah. See, that's one thing that hasn't changed. No, that will never change. okay. You know a new place? Yeah, but you're paying this time, right? yes, absolutely. Hi. Hi. Wow. You ready? Is bobby out there? Oh, his parents have him in the back. He was nervous, so they gave him some sacramental wine. Oh. I had some, too. God, hilda, you look so beautiful. Doesn't she? Oh. Oh, my god. I just wanna eat something. Mama, the second this thing is over, You can eat your face off. Yeah. Over? This is the happiest day of my life. Ohh. ohh. All right. Let's do this bitch. Hey. You look great. Thank you. So, um, thanks for helping henry get his job back. Betty, I'm really sorry. I should probably go say something to him. He's not coming. You were right. I was going backwards. You okay? Yeah. We're just in two very different places. I guess you know me better than I thought. Well, you know me pretty well, too. Trista definitely brings out the dumb in me. "irregardless" isn't a word, is it?
