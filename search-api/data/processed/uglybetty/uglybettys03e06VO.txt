"mode" has scored adriana lima for their sizzling hot issue, and it's all the doing of this young lady-betty suarez. speak, betty. um, well, suzuki, i was researching our sizzling hot fruit, the tico berry, when i discovered that adriana's grandfather grows them on his farm. farms. we know what those are. those are the things fashion people knock down so we can build our weekend houses. tell us more, betty. what other newsworthy crumbs can you drop on the ground for gossip-hungry "fashion buzz" viewers, hmm? - wow. - she's doing so great. - i bet you she gets her own show after this. - quiet. i want to hear what she says. steamy brazil, was it? well, suzuki, um... this unique cover is a great chance for "mode," um, to show... um, show, a-a different side of adriana. not so, uh, old. i mean, uh, not the same old- - not the same old thing. - now, uh, does the tico berry go good with vodka?

no questions. i'm so thrilled about this. - i'm really excited for us to be working gether, betty. - moving on. anyone's name who is not on the masthead may leave. you are unbelievable. you sabotaged me. uh, it's not my fault you don't have the face or pores for television. no, you just couldn't stand that i was in charge, - so you had to weasel your way in there. - i happen to like being in the spotlight, and unfortunately, there's just not room for the two of us. yeah, well, we have to work as a team, so it'll have to be.</i> - that's one way to look at it. - and what's the other? the shoot is in two days. my bet is, is that by the time it happens, one of us will be gone, and it's not gonna be me. you know daniel, i was thinking about what your mother said. about hiring a c.f.o.? well, i only know him by reputation, but, uh, - i heard that connor owens is an exceptional - no. well, he has the best business mind this side of iger. absolutely not daniel, i-i thought we had reached a place where we could work together on things. isn't there a chance you could put whatever silly issues you have with him aside and do what's best for meade? daniel, i'm so sorry to bother you, but i really don't think that i can work with kimmie. why not? well, i don't trust her, and she brings out this side of me where i want to scratch her eyes out. betty... do you think i like working with wilhelmina? well, no. there isn't a day that goes by that i'm not fighting with her about something. like it or not, she's my partner. - we have this magazine to put out. - but kimmie's trying to take my project from me. - so don't let her. - no, but she doesn't play fair. that's her problem. you gotta worry about yourself. this is what you wished for, right? as you move up, things aren't gonna get easier. my advice to you- be a professional. take the high road. and christina aguilera walks in with her child, and she's breast-feeding. how did it happen? we used to be the ones spreading rumors, mocking coworkers, ruining self-esteem, because god made us pretty, god made us mean. sometimes he gives with both hands. but look around. it is kimmie's world. okay, but before we go nuclear on her, we need more. i agree. and you know me, i hate going nuclear. - you love going nuclear. - i do love going nuclear, and destroying someone is fun. oh, look. it's sad betty. betty, we need to talk to you. there's a problem, something that affects all of us, like global warning. it's kimmie, and the inconvenient truth is that she's evil, - and she has to go. - what do you mean, go? - we need to kill her. - get her fired. - whatever. - and we need your help. she's working with you on the shoot, right? i don't know, guys. getting someone fired... - betty, she threatened your family. - what? when? okay, she didn't do that, but she did weasel her way into your big moment, right? yes. it's not exactly taking the high road. betty, yes or no? no. people, behold. this is a loulou de la falaise reproduction of marie antoinette's famous framboise necklace.</i> poor girloved her berries. betty, do you think this might be a good idea for the adriana lima shoot? - maybe. yeah. - it's just a suggestion. it could be the perfect complement - to that beautiful oscar de la renta gown. - bom dia.</i> bom dia. adriana - mwah. adriana. mwah. tudo bem? - tudo bem.</i> - hi. - i haven't seen you since milan. how you feeling? i've been great except for my broken finger. you should see thether girl. joking. joking. but i'm really happy to be here to do this photo shoot with my beloved tico berries. oh, we are just thrilled to have you. kimmie has been telling me all her ideas for this photo shoot. the theme of memory is genius. uh, kimmie's ideas? i don't know about genius, but it could work. and guess who we got to shoot it? phillipe loire. we saw him at t club last night. - cliff was supposed to shoot that cover. - that skank needs to be stopped. - kimmie, what is going on? - oh, i saw in the schedule that you gave out that adriana was landing lastight, so i met her at the airport and introduced myself. we hit it off, so we went out for some dinner and some drinks. and then you told her that my ideas were your ideas? well, maybe you should have done more - than just send a fruit basket to her room. - adriana, hi. - hi. - i'm betty suarez. nice to meet you. - i work here. actually - sorry, but we, um, we have to go. sorry, guys. but, um, a. lim., it's spa time. i'm sorry to interrupt. i'll see everybody tomorrow. and remember, tico is life. don't worry about her. she's just someone's assistant. screw the high road. i'm in. let's kill kimmie. it's a pleasure to be here. daniel knows me from harvard, but unlike some people in this room, i didn't grow up rich. nobody ever gave me anything. i grew up in a council flat in sydney. if that's where i end up, fine by me. is there a point to this delightful mini bio? - oh, daniel. - i never take a job for the money. - ah. - when i ran accounts for beard & phelps and a client didn'tike our campaign, i didn't take no from some v.p. of marketing who couldn't find his nuts with a gps. i went over the idiot's head until i was standing in a room with the person who had the power to say yes, and then that person said yes. because if i learned one thing talking to my old man on a prison phone through a glass partition, it's never take on something you can't defend. and i can defend this company. but i won't lie to you. there's work to do. you need a new business plan. here's what i'd do. read it through. it speaks for itself. thanks for your time. thank you. daniel? it's an odorless, colorless gas. when she wakes up, she's got heroin stuffed in her pockets. police come in, whisk her away, problem solved. - i don't know how i feel about sending her to prison. - yeah, i'm gonna have to go with betty on this one. - too far, mandy. too far. - i say she deserves - whatever horrible punishment she gets. marc, - your boyfriend's getting cheese on my couch. cliff, napkin. honey, i know you're upset and anger-eating because you lost the adriana shoot, but trust me, kimmie will be dealt with. it just has to be appropriate. - do they still make guillotines? - not constructive. - wait. that's it. - marc, you're scaring me. the marie antoinette necklace - that wilhelmina wants to use in the shoot. - yeah, but that was just a suggestion. that was no suggestion. that was vintage slater scheming. that necklace is up for auction, and if a "mode" cover spikes the price, wilhelmina gets a cut. and if that necklace isn't around adriana lima's neck... then someone will lose their head. ay, louisa, you look beautiful.</i> - and yohave your "i voted" sticker, so you get 10% off. - all right. - justin's outside. he'll cash you out. - all right. okay, thank you. okay, who's next? hi. come on in. come on in. sit down. okay, i'm thinking, like, um, a sexy michelle obama or maybe a stylish cindy mccain. oh, excuse me. mija? oh. ruminate on that. i'll be right back. okay, good. - sweetie, are you gonna take a break soon? - i got business out the wazoo. - but you haven't had a chance to vote yet. - yeah, papi, i'll do it if i have time.</i> mija, do you realize how important your vote is?</i> mija, you are an american. ay, spare me the civics lesson, okay?</i> you know what's american? making money. i am not about to slow down the best day of business this salon has ever had to vote on something that i don't care about. it's got nothing to do with me. now i gotta go. i got business. hi. sorry about that. you know what i was thinking? senator clinton. it's a style that never quits. all right, just make sure everyone's okay over there, - and then i'll - o.m.g., kimmie. it looks amazing. - you did such an awesome job. - thanks. i love how those things - look like they're free-floating in the air. - oh, yeah. it's suri-realism. - it's this thing tom cruise's daughter invented. - oh. oh, but what is that thing on adriana's stand-in's neck? ew. marc, check that out. ugh. it is awful! it's a giant piece of fruit. what, did it fall off of carmen miranda's hat? - oh, or is the theme berries? - oh. tico berries, strawberries. - what about blueberry? - or a halle berry? this was betty's idea, wasn't it? it was totally betty's idea, 'cause it sucks. do you really think it's that bad? - the worst. - beyond. i don't know. yeah, it blows. could someone please lose that necklace a-sap? get it off her neck. it's hurting my eyes. okay, come on. we don't have all day. - we set her up, betty. - you knock her down. since you haven't said anything, i assume it's a no go on hiring connor? fine. i'll give him a call, tell him we didn't think he was the right fit. i'll talk. hi, daniel meade for connor owens. connor, daniel meade here. i'm sitting with wilhelmina slater. so how'd you like to come run the business side of meade? you'll have the offer in writing tomorrow morning. yeah. you were right. we need him. well, thank you, daniel, for putting your ego aside and respecting me on this. this is albacore, okay? i don't eat albacore. - now go back to nobu and get me what i ordered. - hey, kimmie. i was just wondering if you needed me to do anything, - you know, help out? - no, i'm good. gosh, i'm so nervous you know, wilhelmina's gonna be here any second. - so? big deal. - well, not for you, because you're so good at standing up for yourself, but i'm not. i mean, wilhelmina always has such strong opinions, - and i always back down. - well, i'm sure she likes that. no. no, she hates it. she only respects people who stand up to her. really? yeah. i mean, she's gonna walk in here, ask to change ten things, but what she really wants is for someone to say no. i always say yes. i just wish i wasn't so weak. the only way to impress wilhelmina is to be strong. oh, well. * if anybody wanted to know * know *how to party and get on the floor * - you made it happen, betty. - ye, i did. i'm proud of you. you found a way to make it work with kimmie. oh, uh... yep, i did. this business is tough. it really makes you wonder, what kind of person am i? what am i willing to do to get ahead? it's not easy. so how's everything going? excuse me. - kimmie, i have to talk to you right away. - bad time. adriana's due any minute. - no. look, i may have steered you in the wrong direction. - hey, betty. - what are you doing? stop this. - guys, i can't do it, okay? - this isn't how i want to get ahead. - oh! - we have to distract her. does anyone have a 6-foot hoagie? - no. ooh. all right, so i set you up. wilhelmina hates it when people disagree with her, so whatever she says, just do it. what? just back down and look weak? no, thanks. unlike you, betty, i intend to go places. no, but that's what she wants. - she wants you to be weak. she wants everybody to be weak. - you're so transparent. no, i am being honest. look, she really, really wants that necklace in the shoot, so just put it back. - necklace! - unbelievable. now you're trying to set me up to put that ugly necklace back on the model. no, i was setting you up before. i am not now. i swear. look, betty, i know how to judge character, and right now you're oozing petty, bitter, jealous ooze. - it's all over you. i see right through your stupid little plan. - kimmie. so, uh, where is the necklace? it's not going to be in the shoot. - but i want it in the shoot. - yeah, but it's hideous, so we're not using it. now don't worry, babe. i got it covered. just sit back, relax, have a doughnut. - do you have some kind of death wish? - my only wish right now is that you scooty scoot scoot. go on. find someplace shady. get the damn necklace and put it in the damn picture. - here. - it's not going to be in the picture. - that's my decision, and that's final. - well, you're fired. - no, i'm not fired. - oh, yes, you are fired. but-but... wait a minute. they tricked me. that's not fair. i have worked too hard to get here. this is my jumping off point. what about my blog, my vlog, - my perfume, my fashion line? - security, come get her, please. nuh-uh. this is not how it's going down. no kimmie, no shoot. how about that? - excuse me? - have fun doing a tico berry shoot with no tico berries. no. no, kimmie! don't. please don't. that's all we have! - this way, miss. - what are you doing?

nah. i didn't get one. what's the big deal, right? well, they could hit you with a pretty big fine, - shut you down. - yeah, but who's gonnsay anything? maybe no one, but, uh, it's always better to be safe with these things. trust me. i'm a councilman in this district. so you're here to bust me? uh, no. actually, i just really needed a haircut. - well, now you're not getting one. - i'm just telling you the law. it's my job. - get out. - but you only finished half my hair. all right, look. why don't you take my card? and i promise, i'll do anything i can to help you. but i strongly suggest you shut down temporarily - until you get that license. - "archie rodriguez"? that's me. well, archie rodriguez, i have six weeks of bookings, and now you're telling me that i can't run my own salon? what can i say? next time you could vote me out. betty, do something. are there any more berries? - they weren't very easy to find. - well, adriana's not doing the shoot without those berries. if this falls apart, it's a major fiasco. - the press will kill us. - hello? i'm waiting for my beautiful berries. uh, they'll be here in a minute, adriana. we can't bluff for too long. you know what they say about models, - but this one is a smart one. - done. anybody have the sunday "times" crossword? we have a lot riding on this. are you sure you don't want me to take over? no. uh, no. um... i just remembered something. adriana, hi. hi. i'm betty suarez. i work at "mode." - nice to meet you. - uh, adriana, did you get that fruit basket we put in your room? yes, i did. it was wonderful. thank you so much. oh, good. uh... see, 'cause i know i put some tico berries in there, and it would be great if you didn't eat all of them, because, you see, we don't have any tico berries for the shoot. i don't understand. this whole shoot was inspired by the berries. i know, i know, and we had them. it's just, there was an incident, and now we don't. and it's not like it's exactly easy to come by them. i mean, this isn't todos os santos bay. - how do you know that? - well, it's where your grandfather's farm is, right? - yes. - i did the research. kimmie told me she did all the work. yeah. okay. i get it. she's that type of girl. well, it's not exactly like my way's any better. we don't have the berries. so... did you eat all of them? i gotta say, you really pulled it off, betty. congratulations. thank you, daniel. and i owe you an apology about kimmie. she was a bad seed. i didn't see it. oh, well. you were right. the thing that's important is how i do my job. oh, uh, speaking of the business, i got you something i thought you might be able to use. - what? - hello, daniel. connor. - this is my assistant betty sua - betty suarez. hi. you're connor owens. oh, my god. you're, like, famous in the publishing world. and you've got a good handshake. firm, strong big hands- - really big, like tennis racquets with fingers. - ahem. betty. - sorry. - it's nice to meet you. - so did that offer come in? - yes, it did, and i'd like to talk about it with you. betty, would you excuse us for a second? we did it. so now it's real. that was smooth. and wilhelmina has no idea. looks like somebody had a good day. yes. today was a good day. - what you holding on to so tight? - oh, nothing. just something my boss gave me for doing a photo shoot. oh. so you got your chance. uh, yeah, mainly because you told me to go for it. oh, well, i was just telling you what i tell myself. well, it worked, so thank you. sure. so let me see what you got. business cards. they don't have a title yet, but i'll get there. and you can keep that one. i have plenty. that's really cool, betty. thanks. *... last night * i had a reason to stay in the back of my head * * still, i have to say good-bye * * here in this bed * free * you are free
