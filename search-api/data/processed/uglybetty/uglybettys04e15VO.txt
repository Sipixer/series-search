We're not quite the same people we were back then. Well, I am the same old regular guy. But you! You've gotten quite a reputation. What was it they said about you in the paper the other day? They called you a-a " power hgry fashion nazi." But that's a good thing in your business though, right? uh-- Yes, yes. we were very proud of that. i--you know, I am sti the same old wanda I used to be. Still fun, still sweet. this is all for show. You should--you should call me. you'll see. I-i-i'll check my schedule. Marc. Justin! Hi. what are you doing here? Um, I need to talk to you in private. Um, is my aunt betty here yet? nope. about ten minutes away. Good. I have to tell you something huge, But you have to promise not to tell any of my family. okay? Okay. It's about something that I did... With a friend from acting class. Oh. Yes. yes. Sit down, Take your time... And, um, let it out. These things can be difficult. Trust me, I know. It wasn't too long ago that yours truly Sat down wand had sympat a very similar conversation. No way. you burned down your house, too? Boy, did i. y--i'm sorry, what? I smoked a cigarette in my house, And I think I started the fire. Thank you for coming over. I really need to talk. Yeah. what's up? you're stress cooking, And your shoulders are all the way up by your mustache. Yeah, I think I did a terrible thing. I promised hilda I'd hire an electrician To hang my classy new chandelier. But when you hired sal the electrician, It turned out to be sally the electrici-anna, And you two had a steamy love affair. But little did you know sally was married, And now her hubby's coming to get ya. no. that's not it at all. Are you sure? 'cause I totally thought that's where you were going with that. I need more bacon. No, no, no, i-i-i never hired an electrician. I did the wiring myself, And I think I may have caused our house fire. uncle papi! Okay, I need to ask you something, And you have to tell me the truth. I'm all about the truth, all right? ask away. Did you burn down my house? what?! What the hell kind of question is that? no! I'm sorry. it was rude. Did your family burn down my house? If you're implying what I think you're implying... Well, bobby, don't you think it is a little bit weird That my salon went up in flames just two days after I joked That the stupid place should burn down So I could collect the insurance? Listen to me, for the last time, okay? My family is not in the mafia. Well, that's not the story on the street... "mobby." I'm gonna pretend, right, That you didn't just call me "mobby." And you know what else? Accusing my family of something like that When you haven't even met them yet-- You know, that takes a big fat set of kiwis. Oh, hi. good morning. could you just hold this? thanks. Did you just get here? What makes you say that? amanda, it's 11:30. Big whoop. I'm filling in at reception today. Besides, I'm sleeping with the boss, so it's all okay. Oh, how's that going for you? It is so good. the sex is great, And he doesn't mind if I date. And I don't mind that he's picking out models at 1:00. Ooh, he is? hmm, this is fun. That's the jackass who upstaged me at fashion week. What's he doing here? Decorating my world. I don't know what it is. There's something that bugs the hell out of me about him. Do me favor. find out why he's here. On it. A recent study found That over 50% of american women wear glasses. And because lady gaga is so well-known For heoutlandish eyewear, We thought she would be the perfect model for "mode's" Top list of fashion forward prescription glasses. We're calling the spread "lady gaga's lady goggles." No, we're not. We're not. Betty, uh, less talking, more pictures. Show us the mock-ups, please. Sorry. Um, my--ugh--my dessert. My dad--he, um... He packed my dessert... And it must've gotten wedged in my computer. Um... he likes to do that. Stop. we're nauseated. Okay. uh... Still works. Yay. uh, all right. so as you will see, The angle for the spread is... What is that, and why is it singing? I don't know, my nephew was using my computer we're in...., this doesn't work The flan is making it sticky. Um, I'm sorry. my nephew must've replaced my lady gaga file With his lady gaga file. But you know what? I can run to grab my flash drive. Enough! gentlemen, let's give betty five minutes To go get her flash drive so she can give it to tracy, Who will be taking over this account.

Is there anyone else here I could talk to? All right. come on. I'm sorry. I'm just playing with you. Okay, i-i-i actually have A little bit of pull around here, all right? My aunt, she's an assistant fire inspector. not falling for that one. Uh, no, no, no. no, for reals. for reals this time, okay? I could probably get you moved to the top of the list. Maybe, uh, I don't know. Maybe you want to grab some dinner? we could talk it over. Um, that's flattering, but I don't think I can. Well, okay. well, uh, maybe tomorrow then. No, I just don't think it's a good idea. Well, all right. Uh, well, good luck with everything. Hope it all works out. Trust me, kathy, That hurt you more than it hurt me. Now the only reason I am not firing you Is because you've finally discovered concealer. Now get out. Wow. someone's showing restraint. See? I can be nice. but what does it matter? People still view me As a drop-dead gorgeous fashion nazi. Wow, it sounds like some of don's words Are really sticking with you. well, don was a great guy. Back in the day, believe it or not, Being with a simple man like that actually appealed to me. Willie... please don't hit me for saying this, But your face just softened. You still like him! I do. But you heard him. he's a regular guy. And I'm a monster. I'd doubt he'd even get near me. But he might get near wanda. I mean, if you really like him, Maybe you oughta dust the old girl off, Take her for a spin. Thank you. Well... Thanks again for lunch and all the dinners And the, uh, the gentleman's facial, And it's really nice to know that I have Practically no pores, and that's a good thing. well, you get that from me. I have to admit, I kind of feel like I'm freeloading. Tyler, you're not freeloading. You're my son. Oh, this has been the nicest week. Now go! okay. I'll see you tonight. I am freaking. Amanda. what are you doing? He is your son! and he is hot! well done. When are you gonna tell daniel? in time. I just want to enjoy this a little longer Before it gets complicated.

I know! he can be one of our in-house test models. Oh, he's perfect. look at that skin. he gets that from me. Really? Are you in a good mood? 'cause I need to ask you a favor. Actually, I'm in a terrible mood. I've had a horrible day. Are you in oh. well, maybe this I need t will cheer you up. I need to use your apartment for a dinner party. Why would that cheer me up? I know it's a lot to ask, but I promised bobby That I would get to know his family. You know, so I don't think... they're in the mob. Oh. well, now that I know It's for something totally reasonable... I'm sorry. But you know we'll be out of your apartment soon. Ugh. not unless I go out With the world's most irritating fireman. what do you mean? So you go on one date with this guy, And we'll move to the top of the list? you're going. no, I'm not.

They always come back. You're going on a date with a fireman? Betty, these are firemen. This... Is you. well, marc, Maybe if you could get a date with a real fireman, You wouldn't need the calendar. mean. I love it! Besides, my fireman isn't exactly chiseled... Or hairless... Or coated in oil. how does he fight fires then? Oh, I get it. he's one of these february firemen Who they make pose with dogs 'cause they're not cute enough. I guess. I don't even want to go on this date. I'm only doing it so that my family Can get back into their house quicker. Well, if you wanna make the date Quick and painless yet effective, Then you need to implement my s. a.a.d.d. system. "sad" system? Saad-d. "skip appetizers and don't drink." Appetizers only prolong a meal, And alcohol is a gateway to endless conversation And... other things which I'm sure you want to avoid. Mm. I do. Yes Marc, in my office now. oh. uh, wilhelmina, I hate to ask this because I know you kicked me off The lady gaga account, but... Is it okay if my nephew still comes to the shoot? marc, tell her "no." No. and throw away her bagel. She doesn't need it. No. no, no, no, no. no. you're smouthing again. "smouthing"? smiling w. it's a very common mistake. But if you're going to be our new test model, You must learn to smize. smile with my eyes? now you're getting it. Can I confess something to you? What, that you're claire meade's long lost son That she put up for adoption, And you've come to claim your rightful place Since the revelation of your true birth mother Rock your small town world?

Oh, honey, they don't have girls like me anywhere. You're free tonight? Oh. great! Um, well, why don't we go to remi? You know, they always have a table for me there and, uh... Or--or--what--you know what? why don't you pick the place? Well, you know, I'm--i'm easy-breezy. Yes. Easy-breezy-george-and-wheezy! That's, uh... Um, you know what? um, okay. Why I send my car to pick you up and w-- Or... you can pick me up in... a cab, Because that's what people do. Great. I'll see you later. And you thought you couldn't be nice. Get kathy back in here. I need to kick someone. Hey. oh, hey. So... why is he here? well, he is one of our test models Wait. no, that's impossible. I'm the one who hires the models. oh! oh, that's weird. That's a total mystery, Maybe one of those things we'll never know, Like what water's made Of or who invented canned potato chips. No, really. did wilhelmina hire him? no. but who cares? I want you now and far from this location. But, no, wait. okay, so that only leaves my mother. Why would my mo-- For once, can we not talk about your mother when we have sex? Okay, the talercios are on their way up. Remember, no cracks about them being in the mob. So what if they are? who am I to judge? People do things they wish they hadn't. Unforgivable things.

These are the best cannolis in all of brooklyn. Ooh! she's right. I'm telling ya, we'd kill for them. oh, yeah. she's right. Let me take your coat. sure. Hello? hey, it's, uh, it's jimmy. Look, I'm sorry. i-i can't make it. There was a fire, and... I went in alone. Things got really bad. oh, no! Gotcha! oh! Damn, you're easy! Look, um, it's, like, an hour wait for a table.

That's disgusting. are you sure? He's joking. I'm joking. there's no hair! There's no hair. see? she gets me. I love that. So how do you two know each other? Oh, we go way, way, way back. I-i knew this one before she was the famous wilhelmina slater. To be honest, i-i'd be afraid to go out with that woman. I read somewhere that she put out a memo Firing anyone with a visible mole. Well, haters love to hate. okay? So tell me. you're her buddy. Is she still the sweet girl I remember? Bobby told us about the fire. it's a terrible thing. Ah, excuse me. yeah, but on the bright side, You're gonna be getting a big insurance check, And you can buy some really nice upgrades for your salon. I guess. but I didn't really want upgrades. Hilda's beaulities plus was doing just fine. Yeah, but still, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. oh, you're right. That's interesting. your son said "gift horse," too. I tend to look at it as the loss of my livelihood, But then again, I can go negative, so... You know, uh, mr. s... mmm! I was thinking... oh, that looks good. When you rebuild, marble floors would look great in the house. You know? especially with that new crystal chandelier you got. Crystal? yeah. Ooh, very fancy. Yeah, well, it's not really me. I'm a simple man. I may even get rid of it. What? what are you talking about? No way. come on, this guy loves this chandelier. it's true. Well, listen, if you decide you wanna go with marble, You let me know. I can get you a deal. we got family in construction. Really? you have family in construction? yeah. I gotta get this. excuse me. come here a second. What happened to keeping an open mind? okay. all right, open mind. Thank you. mm-hmm. >ci sar?morte! Giuro su dio... >e si concluder? /i> nella tua morte! I don't spk italian, But "morte" means "death," right? Very good. ah, he's talking to his brother. You ever get mad enough at someone you tell 'em, "i'm gonna kill ya"? It's just, uh, it's an expression. No, no, you don't understand. I'm really gonna kill you. Look, uh, you're gonna hear what you want to hear. Wilhelna is so supportive of all of us. You know, if someone is having a problem, She's probably involved. And if there are tears, She's there. Well, that's right. Uh, just this morning, kathy was in my office crying, And I just rocked her and, uh, gave her some makeup tips. Aw. sounds like you guys have a great time at work. Well, it's not work. it's--it really like a family. Isn't it, betty? Right. You know what? Just yesterday, I totally screwed up a pitch to lady gaga's people. And, you know, Another boss would've just taken me off the project. But wilhelmina, she was just like, "try again, girl!" That's right, girl. try again. And you know what the best part is? My nephew justin, he still gets to meet lady gaga, Who he loves almost as much as he loves wilhelmina slater. You know what would be such a cool thing? Is if wilhelmina called justin and told him the news! Yeah! call him! he'll love that. yeah! Do it! do it! do it! do it! do it! Do it! call him! call him! call him! call him! it's... Do it! do it, willie! do it, willie! do it, willie! Call him... sorry. Uh, hello? it's wilhelmina slater. oh my god! hi. That's him.

Thanks, wils. Uh, betty, why don't we go, um, Powder our noses? hmm? Damn, hilda. you know, you're not even trying. Well, I'm sorry. but... But every time one of them opens their mouth, A dead body falls out. hey, that's not funny. come on. You know, they heard rumors about you back in the day. oh, please. What rumors? You know, rumors, like... maybe you're not the kind of girl That their sonhould be going out with. But at least they came here with an open mind. Are you telling me that they're here to decide Whether or not I'm a slut? Jeez. wilhelmina, I'm sorry. You don't haveo give me back the project. It's just that my nephew really wants to meet lady-- Oh, stop apologizing, betty. playing the gaga card Might've been the first time I've ever respected you. Really? Now it's time for you and your chubby municipal worker To be on your way. Right. Um, I'll make up an excuse, and we'll go. Not that I'm gonna lose right. any sleep over it, But I'm surprised at your choice of boyfriends. I would think that even you could do better than that. Oh, he's not my boyfriend. I just need him to get my family's inspection moved up. Betty suarez-- Using a man to get what she wants? You are full of surprises tonight. No. it's not like that. I-- There are extenuating circumstances. This isn't... really me. And yet here you are. Girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Right? I mean, it's just weird. why is my mom hiring models? Everybody knows that's my job. And why that guy? I mean, he's not even that good-looking. Okay, first of all, he's crazy hot. and second... If you're actually done with your rant, I think I might have your answer right here. it's only february, But it's already december for claire meade-- May/december, that is. The menopausal meade matriarch has been spotted Canoodling over noodles with an age-inappropriate hottie. And we don't think his palm Is the only thing she's been greasing. you have got to be kidding me. I know! How does he eat pasta and still look like that? What are you doing here? You know what? I already know. I'm just waiting to talk to mrs. meade. if you think I'm gonna stand by And watch you take advantage of my mother, you don't know me. You--you got it all wrong, man. I don't think so. I think it's time for you to leave, man. Okay, you--you need to calm down. or what? huh? You gonna calm me down? get up! I don't want you ever around my mother! Do you under- what the hell is going on?! this guy is playing you! He's only interested in his career and leeching off of you! Daniel, stop. you don't know what you're talking about. oh, yes, I do. Everyone has seen you together. it's embarrassing! But it stops right now. Are you gonna tell him, or should i? tell me what? Tyler is not who you think he is. well, who is he then? He's your brother. Well, I hate to cut this thing short, But I did promise my dad That we'd be home in time for dessert. He's dying to meet one of america's heroes. I get that all the time. Shall we? hey, you know what? I got an idea. Why don't you guys come with us? we can, uh, We can get some dessert, we can get a couple of pictures Of the old man, and then... karaoke. no, jimmy. Come on. they don't- they don't want to. You know what? that sounds like fun. what?! What? obviously, she doesn't want To be alone with this guy. why did you do that? Let's just go back to her house for a little while. 'cause we're having fun. They don't want to hang out with us. come on, she's your friend. No! betty suarez is not my friend, And I'm not going back to some tenement mud hut In little mexico! I live in chelsea. Don, I can't take it anymore! I'm a bitch! I'm a stone-cold bitch. My favorite mome of the day Is throwing out my breakfast muffin In front of a homeless person. Anyone who has a mole is an idiot! And everything you've read about me is true, Or might as well be true. And as long as we're being honest, I'm starting to remember why I really liked you-- The amazing sex. so if you want to do that again, fine. But this time, I'm on top. I'm good with that Now all I'm saying is, your boss seems kind of psycho, Which I did not see coming. I'm a pretty good judge of character. Like, i, uh, I knew right away that you were the girl for me. I usually like blondes! you know what? I'm not usually the one to be defending wilhelmina slater, But at least she was being honest. I mean, isn't that better than what we're doing? what do you mean? Us on this date? I mean, I'm only here So that you can help move my family's name up the list. wait a minute. You're using me? That's awful. I thought you liked me. Jimmy, come on. I mean, you basically said That if I went out with you, you would help. whoa. I would never say that. You kind of did. You were all like, "oh, my aunt's a fire inspector," And then you got all wink-y and--and... I mean, what was that? that is my thing. It's charming! You know what? I am america's freaking hero. I don't need any of that crap to get a date! jimmy-- Forget it! I'm not taking you back! And your family is going to the bottom of the list! And yoi mean,ly is going this doesn't make any sense. Why didn't you ever tell me? it was a long time ago. You were too young to understand. but you told us you were in rehab! Mom, you went away for a year! I did the best I could under the circumstances. Okay. so who's the father, huh? Obviously, it's not dad. Don't tell me it was hartley. You had a kid with him? I don't believe this. Daniel, daniel, please. No, no. I spent my whole life thinking you were the victim. My relationship with dad was crap Because I always sided with you. I never thought for a second That you were just as screwed up as he was. This doesn't sound like you, justin. Why were you smoking? look, I was only doing it To impress someone in my acting class, though. Someone I like. So we're here again. So you like someone. Well, tell me about them. What is... their name? Lily. Lily. cool. Everybody okay? whew! we're full. Are you done with your puttanesca? Oh, honey, this is not puttanesca. Oh. well, apparently it is when I serve it. I mean, it is italian for "whore sauce," right? Hilda! no, we're not gonna go there, please. Bobby, what is she talking about? I will tell you what I am talking about. You got some nerve, Coming here to find out what kind of person I am When you and your mafia family burned down my salon! wait a minute! What, you think we burned down your salon? tony, get the coats. We're out of here, you understand? Hi, I'm betty. hey, no one's going anywhere, all right? I am out of here. hello. Uh, uh, hilda doesn't think you burned down her salon. Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. maybe you hired someone. I don't know how these things work! what?! Hilda, please! what is going on? why is everyone yelling? Tony, the coats! I'll get the coats. We make it a point not to stay in places Where people think we're in the mob. Not that that happens that often. ha! No! okay... what, "no"? We're gonna figure out a way for everybody to get along. That is not gonna happen! Well, it has to, ma! this is the woman I want to spend my life with. oh, my god! All right, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got something to say. I think bobby is talking. I started the fire. what? What? I told you guys I'd hire an electrician for the dimmer. I did it myself. Papi! you could've hurt yourself! Forget that! he hurt my business because you had to get All highfalutin with your fancy chandelier! no, mom, stop! stop! It's not grandpa's fault because... I started the fire. What? justin, what do you mean? Well, I was smoking and-- You were what-ing?! Well, at least our family doesn't smoke. Do you have any idea what you have put us through?! That's it. you're grounded until you're dead. you know, If you want to shave some years off of it, keep smoking! At least now we know that it wasn't my family. We don't know anything about your family! Okay! please, everyone, stop! It doesn't matter who started the fire. What's important is that We don't start turning against each other. We might have to be here a very long time, So we need to find a way to make it work Without ruining projects or spitting on hats, And showers beg taken at all hours of the day. Who cares if it was faulty wiring or smoking or the mob? No disrespect. We just have to get through this. it was a curling iron. Oh, who's this guy? Jimmy, what? what are you doing here? I was acting like a d-bag. And you were right. I did want to go out with you. That's why I didn't tell you That they did the inspection yesterday. So... yeah. uh, someone left a curling iron on oh! so! It was you. hmm? Nuh-unh! I didn't even have clients that day! Besides, I prefer velcro rollers. Wait. aunt betty... You had a curl in your hair the day of the fire. What? hmm, if I put in two curls, It'll ally frame my face. But one curl makes more of a statement. One or two? One or two? Betty, get in here! Oh, my god. It was me. Mija, it was an accident. You have to stop beating yourself up. I feel like a terrible person. Ugh, don't worry. I'm coming up with a list Of things you could do to make it up to us. Smokers don't get to make jokes or lists. It's just...
