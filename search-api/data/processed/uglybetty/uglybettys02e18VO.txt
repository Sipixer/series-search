It was traumatic. I can't even think about that day</i> Without getting panic attacks, - And who cares if i play in the game? - Daniel does. He even came down to my deli to recruit me. I guess this softball team is daniel's baby. He loves holding a trophy over his head while people cheer.</i> Well, i just thought it would be something fun for us to do - As a couple. - We're not exactly a couple yet.</i> I told you. I wanna take it slow. We're not exactly friends. No, But we're in an exploratory phase. Oh, okay, explorer. So when do i get to take you out on an official first date? Soon. Well, it better be very soon. - I'm going to italy for a month. - What? What's the big deal? You're the one who said we're not a couple. I said, "exploratory phase."

It's a little smaller than i imagined And completely rewritten. "Natch"? I didn't write "natch." I wrote "naturally." Who says "natch"? Ah, yes. "Natch." I want to be honest with you. The idea for the article was great. The execution, not so much. It was too... safe. "Safe"? Okay. Well, um... Thank you for the constructive criticism, And thank you for the opportunity. Betty, what do you want to be when you grow up? Wh- I... want to be you. You do? Mm-Hmm. I want to own my own magazine like you. Why? Because i love magazines. I just-I always have. Uh, they speak to me. And i wanna do that for other people. I wanna speak to them and touch their lives. Well, i have no doubt That you will achieve whatever you want, But, betty, you're never going to do it by playing safe. You're going to have to start taking some risks, And it's not just with your work, But also with your life. * baby, hurry up, 'cause i can't... * You know, i always thought i hated tater tots, But when i got out of school, i found myself craving them. Well, how about that jell-O with the fruit in it? - Mnh-Mnh. That was gross. - Yeah. Did you bring any? Straight from the fine chefs... Of the p.S. 350 cafeteria. Oh, you are a true romantic, coach. You know, you can call me tony. I like calling you coach. - Yeah? - Mm-Hmm. * i just wanna fall in love * You are a rock, woman. Excuse me? I am far from a rock. - I am one fine gem. - Yeah, well, if you hadn't skipped science class, You would know that it takes a lot of heat To turn a rock into a gem. - It also takes a lot of time. - And pressure. Okay. Enough. I went through a lot this year, - So i wanna take it slow. - Fine. I'll see you saturday. Okay. * baby, i will give you more * * work * * then you do your homework * * work * * get up on the dance floor * * work * * if you do your homework * * work * * baby, i will give you more * * work * * entiendo means i get it * * siempre means that i won't forget it *</i> Hey. Good job on the uniforms. The girls aren't gonna wanna wear flats, though. - I suggest a high-Heeled cleat. - Yeah, well, that sounds practical. - Have you been here all night? - A couple of nights, actually. There's a lot of work to be done - On the madelon de bie presentation. - Yeah, well, you don't have to kill yourself doing it. - Yes, i do. We need the account. - Look, all i'm saying is, - You have a really strong creative director. - No. I told you no wilhelmina. She wants my job. She wants my magazine. She probably even wants my softball team. - I don't trust her. - She isn't the only one you don't seem to be trusting lately. Alexis, what do you expect? You turned your back on me when you gave her a title. - Daniel - I have a presentation to finish. How cute am i in this? Pretend you're a man for a second, - And tell me how hot i look. - You look fine, but this is not working for me. I like the "v," but it is doing nothing for my bustline. Oh, hey, betty. Great piece in "hot flash." You totally captured that old lady voice. - * natch * - * natch * I didn't write that. Oh, hey, amanda. You're in charge of the cheerleading squad For the "mode" softball team, right? See, i really don't want to play on the team. You wanna be the mascot? Um, no to the mascot, But i have pep to spare. Oh, my god. - You are not asking me- - Gasp. I think she is. Please? Well, if you want to be a cheerleader, You have to try out first. Toe touch. Go. Right herkie. Left herkie. Star jump. Jump. Jump.

What is 23? 23 what? Oh, that's the average age of the wealthiest subsector Of the urban demographic we're targeting. See? It's right here on the chart. See? I am confused. Is anyone else confused? Ja. Of course you're confused, because it's confusing.</i> Thorough? Yes. Accurate? Indeed. But it just makes my head hurt. Madelon, we've done a terrible job Appealing to your head. - Perhaps we can appeal to your heart. - No. What daniel is neglecting to say is, This weekend is The "mode" versus "elle" charity softball game. What if we donated the proceeds to engelen van kinderen, The children's charity you cochair in the netherlands? As an expectant mother myself, I care a great deal about the lives of children, Especially the poor and the disadvantaged. And what do you want in return? A 1-Year commitment to 20 pages per issue, At a 30% reduced rate, of course. Goed?</i> Erg goed. Hmm. She made me look like an ass. I have been working on that all week. - She stole the show. - Yeah, but it was my show. Daniel, you know that i hate to say this,</i> But i don't think that witch wilhelmina Is going anywhere anytime soon. Maybe you need to find a way to work with her.</i> Betty, wilhelmina doesn't work with people. She works against them. There she is, Probably bad-Mouthing me already. "Daniel sucks. Daniel's boring. Daniel doesn't know how to do his job." Okay, i'm gonna let you work through this one. I have lunch with gio, So i'll be back when you're done with the voices, 'kay? Oh, betty, Congratulations on your article. Natch. Funny. I didn't even write that. And then mrs. Meade says that my article was too safe. Well, what would've been the risky thing to do? Shorten more words- "Fabu," "brill"? Sounds like you're in a difficult sitch.</i> Just kidding. What are you doing? - I thought we were gonna go grab some lunch. - We're gonna have a little batting lesson. If you're gonna play in that softball game, You need to practice. No. No way. Not doin' it. I'd rather be the mascot.</i> Okay, you don't have to. I mean, if you want to play it safe... Pardon, monsieur. Daniel meade? - Can i help you? - S'il vous plaît.</i> Parlez-Vous le français? Je voudrais parler avec vous.</i> Sorry. I skipped my french classes in school. C'est important, monsieur. Je crois que tu connais ma mère...</i> All right. Betty. Et je suis venu de france. C'est très, très important.</i> Does anyone speak french? You know, it would really help if you kept your eyes open. Gio, i hate this. Do i have to do it? Yes, you have to. Now stop saying no and start saying yes. Focus on the ball. Okay. Aah! I hit it! I hit it! Whoa! Whoa! - You did. That was a great one. - Yes! Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes! - Whoa! - Whoo! - Whoo! You did it. Let's go.

I know this terrific temp, And i'll totally be reachable... Oh, hey. Who's the kid? And why are you wearing eye shadow? He says he's my son. What? Oh, my god. You trumped me. His mother was a model i slept with years ago. She just died. That's terrible. It is, but he's not my son. You know how many times this happened to my father? People just show up, pretend to be related. True. But, daniel, your father did get around a bit. I mean, he managed to father a child after his death. Betty. - Sorry, but you guys are really fertile. - Look, either someone is after my money, Or they're just messing with my head and... And i think i know who it is. So what you're saying is, I researched every woman you slept with Found out which one had an illegitimate child, Waited for the woman to die and then arranged For the child to come on a class trip from europe Just to upset you? You are not gonna beat me here, wilhelmina. You may own a third of the company, But i am still editor-In-Chief of this magazine. You have no moves in this chess game. Daniel, i play chess. You're playing checkers. Either way... You have no moves. Well, that choo choo has gone off the rails, right? I mean, it's not like there's some twisted scheme That you haven't told me about, is there? There is. Oh, my god. You are diva brilliance. Marc... I didn't plan this. Oh, god must truly love us. Just in our time of need, He drops a little french boy into our laps. Go, god. And viva la france.</i> So what are you thinking? Well, daniel clearly doesn't want To acknowledge the child is his, So let's use that to our advantage. Check and mate. Queen me. Oh, marc. Vous êtes plus grand que j'imaginais.</i> Yeah, i still don't speak french. He said you're taller than he imagined. That's nice. Are we almost done here? Yes, we are. We'll have the results back in a couple of weeks. Okay. Great. Excellent. Uh, the day's over. I am outta here. Daniel... what about daniel, jr.? What? I called the school. They're gonna pick him up. Besides, i got three models waiting for me at lotus. - What? You mean, you don't want to spend any time with him? - Betty, i told you. This is a scam. We have to go through the motions, But that kid is not my son. Daniel... What? He doesn't speak english. He doesn't have to. Good evening my little friend. Good evening. I'm sorry your father left you alone. Are you hungry? Would you like to have dinner with us? Oul. - Bon. - Bon.</i> Mom, i think you're being a tease. Shut up.

So what do you think of this coach diaz? Um, i'm going to rome with gio. - What? - Oh, my god. - Aunt betty, you're crazy. - I know. - Betty, how are you gonna afford this? - I've been saving a little, And-And we're gonna do things on the cheap. - And where are you gonna sleep, in the same bed with him? - Dad, we haven't really discussed that part yet. - Well, don't you think you should? - Ay, papi, she's 24. It's not like she's a virgin.</i> - Wait. What? - Hilda. Okay. Uh, i'll get the recap later. Bye. Dad, look, i don't know all the details yet, But it just feels right, and-And when am i ever Gonna get an opportunity to do this again? Ay, dios mio. - Do you support this? - Hey, i would love to go to italy. Gracias. Uh, aunt betty? There's someone at the door for you? Oh, my god. What-What are you doing here? Will you marry me, betty? - Um, i'm- - Shocked? Totally. Betty Henry, why are you doing this to me right now? I am just starting to get over you. Don't. Don't get over me. I'm not over you. I love you, betty. - No. - I love you, and we can be together. - I want you to move to tucson with me. - Wha-What? I've given this a lot of thought. There's no reason not to do it. I know you can be happy there, And i have a friend that works at a magazine. I gave him your resume? He was impressed. And he can give you a job as a writer, And the pay is good, so you can still help out with your family, - And you can visit them, and they can visit you. - Henry- Just say yes. Just say yes. I know this is huge and crazy. Yes. Betty, it would be amazing. I'm going back on monday. I want you to be on that plane with me As my fiancee. Are you out of your mind? - You're gonna miss the opportunity to go to rome? - I thought you didn't want me to go to rome. That was before henry proposed. You're only 24 years old. - You're not getting married. - Papi, why not?</i> - She found true love. He wants to be with her. - She's too young, and it's too far. Well, you left mexico to be with the woman you loved, - And that was much farther, and you were younger. - I was not much younger, and this is totally different.</i> No, it isn't, so when the shoe is on the other foot- - Guys - Shoes, what are you talking about? Shoes? You know what? This is all ridiculous. She's not going to rome with some guy she barely knows, - And she's not getting married and moving to tucson. - She is standing right here.</i> And she's asking for your advice, Not your approval. Good... Because you're not getting any from me. Good morning, fashionistas. For those of you just waking up or just going to bed, We have some breaking news. Just when we thought the meade family drama Couldn't get any juicier, Along comes some freshly squeezed jus d'orange.</i> Daniélmeade is The illegitimate love child of daniel meade And the late hand model lucie chainet, Whose famous fingertips scratched through Many a bare back in some scandalous mid-90s perfume ads. So how did daniel embrace the news? He didn't! He partied the night away at lotus,</i> Promoting this weekend's "Mode"/"elle" charity softball game. - I hope he didn't leave his glove at home. - Oh, no, she di'int!</i> Meanwhile, little orphan danny walked the streets of manhattan, Digging through dumpsters for food. So far, no comment from daniel sr.</i> Papa, can you hear me? - He's got your jawline. - That's all, fashionistas. Stay tuned for more updates.</i> - Mom. - What? There is a resemblance. Hmm? Now why are you fighting this? I have a grandson. I'm very happy about that, and you should be, too. He's not my kid. I don't know how this got out.</i> - I called the school. They were gonna pick him up. - Madelon de bie just pulled out. - What? Why? - Uh, let's see. We got her on the hook with a children's charity, And now it's all over the news that you abandoned your kid. - He's not mine. - Hey, i was on that trip with you in paris. I remember you drooling all over his mother. - "Yeah, i'm gonna go bang the hand model!" - That's very classy, daniel. We need to do some major damage control here. I need you to keep a low profile. We're gonna tell madelon - That you're taking a leave of absence. - Alexis. - Mom, stay out of this. - I can't believe you. When an advertiser threatened to pull out Because you became a woman, i stood by you. - We almost lost this magazine. - Then i guess i'm learning from your mistakes. You slicing ham with those pants? What? Papi, that crease cannot get any sharper.</i> She's behaving like a child. She's trying to figure out what to do with her life. She's too young to know what to do. Is this really about how old she is, Or you not being ready to lose her? Look, i know how difficult it is to find love.</i> And when you find someone, you gotta seize that opportunity. You can't just sit around And act like it's gonna be there the next day, Because sometimes-Boom! It's gone. And then you have nothing. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Where you going? I'm gonna seize my opportunity.</i> Oh, god. Daniel, i just heard about this leave of absence. What does that mean? It means nothing. A couple of weeks. Good time for you to take a vacation. Are you okay? Yeah. It's daniel. Look, daniel, It's gonna take a couple weeks for the results to get back. - So i mean, until then - Betty, i don't need to take a paternity test to know. I'm his father. This is a letter daniel's mother wrote to him before she died. I had it translated. She wanted him to know who his father is And if anything happened to her, to come find me. What am i gonna do? Daniel, you always complained About how cold and distant your father was. You don't have to be that. You can be there for your son. And he just lost his mom, so he really needs you. Betty. Thanks. And in case you thought i'd forgotten about rome, Here is an all-Expense-Paid trip for you and gio. First-Class tickets, five-Star hotels, the works. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Is that a good "oh, god" or a bad "oh, god"? Oh, i'm sorry, daniel. I'm so sorry. It's just that henry showed up last night, And he asked me to marry him and move to tucson. Betty, that's... Uh, how-How is that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do i do? I- I'm the last person you should ask for relationship advice. I know. But you're my friend, and i need to know. I think you should go to rome. Because i shouldn't be with henry? No, because i can't imagine being here without you. I'm a little biased. Sorry. So what are you gonna do? No, no, no. Thank you for being so understanding.</i> Bedankt vaarwel. Is everything okay? That was madelon de bie. It took a lot of finessing on my part, But she's finally back on board Now that daniel's taken a step back. Thank you, wilhelmina. Oh, of course. It's absolutely fine- Me taking care of everything While, uh, daniel's off dealing with his little bastard. I understand now more than anything The importance of family. But to be honest, It's just been a lot easier Getting things done around here by myself. What are you saying? It's just-Alexis, you and i-We had a plan. We were gonna take over the company together. And, of course, i understand why you turned on me. You chose your brother. But you're in charge now. You need to do what's best for the magazine. And that would be getting rid of daniel? Well, that's a little harsh. Just think of it more as a... A reassignment to another position in the meade empire That might be a better fit. If there's one thing i've learned, Family will always be there, alexis. But with daniel running things, i'm not sure "mode" will. Hello, mr. Meade. Thank you for coming. It's nice to meet you. Here is daniél's passport and his document. I can trust you will take good care of him? Betty? Dad. I wanted to talk to you. Oh, my god. It's gorgeous! It's dominican amber.

You were, but then you jumped. And it was okay. I wanted to protect you, But you knew what you wanted to do, and you did it. Dad, i don't know what i want this time. Amor. What do i do? I can't tell you that, mija. I can tell you that i love you, That i'll support you either way. But this is your decision, betty. You can't listen to anyone else.
