Don't really know how you're feeling. - Tyler is not who you think he is. - Well, who is he then? - He's your brother. - So who's the father, huh? Now you tell me there's some little bastard out there. Who could just waltz in here and demand his cut! It's Meade. I want the whole damn company. No more nice Willie! Tyler, I'm Wilhelmina Slater. - They're gone? - Betty, you look great. You may now kiss the bride. - Aah! - Aah! What, are you stepping out on me before our wding? I guess it's a little hard to tell us apart now that I'm not wearing braces. Yeah. Okay, okay. Enough monkey business. Baby, according to "how to plan a wedding in 60 days"... We were supposed to have a wedding photographer, like, last week. "Based on the popular blog." This woman turned her blog into a book. Meanwhile, I haven't even posted in over a moh. Because I've been so busy at work. Well, I hope you haven't been too busy... To plan my bachelorette party this weekend. Hey, I got my party planned... Booze, boobs and a bus to Atlantic city. You're traveling? - Yeah. - Why does he get to travel? I want to travel. Travel is the part that you have a problem with? - Ay, please. Like he's gonna do better than this? - That's right. Anyway, maid of honor, what fun thing are we doing? Well, get ready... Because I have scored us a private after- hours... ooh! Champagne... wow. Tour at the met! Get outta here! That's a good one! - The met! - The met? That would've been the worst bachelorette party ever! Right? I know! I was keeping the real party a surprise. - Oh, okaygood. - You're gonna love it! Shh! See you later. Hey, Justin, you, uh, you want a ride to school? No, sorry. I'm walking with Austin. Justin doesn't walk. He's told me a thousand times, "shoes are for fashion, not function." I don't know. You know, we, uh, we used to be friends. I don't know what's up with him lately. Maybe, uh... Maybe I did something wrong. You're about to be his new stepfather. That's gotta be weird for a kid. You know what? This weekend, you guys go and do something fun together. That's a good idea. And that is my parents in a nutshell. Um... I don't mean to keep harping on this, but you don't have any news tracking down my father, do you? Actually, I do. I- I just learned that. The rehab facility where we met shut down, and, uh, those records can't be retrieved, so we'll never be able to find him. I... I'm... so sorry, Tyler. Oh, it's okay. So I was conceived at a rehab facility. I, uh, guess I was destined to be an alcoholic. I don't think we should joke about that. Have you spoken to Daniel yet? I tried, but... He doesn't want anything to do with me. I hate that you're leaving so soon, and you two never got to know each other. It's fine. I came to meet you, and that part worked out. Ooh! I could take hilda horseback riding. For her bachelorette party. Or, better yet, naked horseback riding. You're welcome. Gross. And ow! Well, I'm out of ideas then. Well, all of your ideas involve nudity. You're welcome. Stop saying that. Oh! An e- mail from the trapeze school. $1,000? Come on. That was my favorite option. This totally sucks! Are you talking to me? No. I was talking to... never mind. Oh. So what sucks? I have to plan the perfect bachelorette party for my sister, and nothing is working out. It's just really disappointing. Oh, well, I know disappointment. My half brother hates me, and I have no hope of finding my biological father. Okay... perspective. Well... if it helps, I've known Daniel for years, and if you just give him time, he'll come around. Oh. If you'll excuse me, I have to go deal with something annoying. I see you. So, uh... what, aryou on team tyr now? No. Daniel, I'm not on team anyone. Tyler is not a bad guy. Put yourself in his shoes. Shoes? More like smelly, old cowboy boots. - Okay, you're 5 years old. - No, you're 5 years old. Someone needs a nap. We'll talk about this later. Fine. But I'm putting you down for team Daniel. As requested, here is some clothing from... The mall. Ugh. Now I'm not one to pry, but you didn't exactly specify what this is all for. It's for an important meeting. That I can't be seen wearing cashmere and furs. Mysterious. Still not prying, but would this meeting have anything to do. With your plan to overthrow the meades? Yes. It involves Claire's recently revealed love child... Tyler. Aw, he's such a rube. And he's so hot. Must he be a part of all this? He's just a pawn... The weak link in the Meade chain. I gain his trust, everything else falls into place. Ow! Willie's being all weird again. And you're being... British. I'm trying to look authentic. For my trip to london with Daniel, but it feels like I'm missing something. A riding crop? A horse? Dignity? Wow. Somebody's jealous. Yeah, I'm jealous! You get to go all the way to london. I have to stay here and figure out who I'm gonna take. As my plus- one to hilda's stupid straight wedding. Why don't you bring your boyfriend? Oh, my God. I totally forgot I had that boyfriend trey. Troy. I like trey better. Or Trevor. We'll talk about it. I'm sure he'll want to weigh in. You're going to the london fashion week, Daniel, really? No, there are some big designers there. You call it "the training bra of fashion weeks." And you're only ever interested in the big, sexy ones, so why are you going? Is this one of those times where you ask me a question. That you already know thanswer to? The answers... you don't need to be there. You're just going to avoid this whole thing with Tyler. - Am I right? You know what? - I hate it when you know me. So send someone in your place and stay here. Reach out to your long- lost half brother. Who traveled across the country to meet you, - who you've been nothing but a jerk to. - Okay, fine, fine. - But who's gonna go to london, Hmm? You? - No, I can't go. I have to stay and plan hilda's bachelorette party. I still have no idea what I'm gonna do. She wants something big and exciting and fun, but with travel. Wait a second. I can't believe it! A bachelorette trip to london! Oh, my gosh! I thought your party was gonna be so lameass! Hey! And it turns out it's gonna be badass! Yeah! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Suck on that, talercio! Suck on it! Oh, my God! We're in london. Ms. suarez, welcome. Oh, you know my name. Of course. We'reery honored to have you here. Oh, my God! You are totally famous here. Oh, please wait. I'd like to, um, tip you. I'm sure I have a few extra pounds in here somewhere. Somewhere? Uh, what about here and here and here? Hey! And how about here? You are workinfor her this week. Can you be nice? Betty! Oh, she looks so elegant! I know! Eyes up, you dozy choob! Hey, watch where you're goin'! Yeah, yeah. Stick it up your fish pipe. There's the drunk I remember. Hi! Oh! Look at you! No braces! Look at you! How's Stuart and the baby? Oh, they're good! But they're at home. So how soon can we get a drink in this mama's hand. And get this hen night started? Well, there's an opening night cocktail party. In, like, 30 minutes. Oh, right- o! Cheerio! Oh, my God. I sound like a local, right? Right. Let's go. Yeah, right? Hilda, you're getting married! These past few months have been the most challenging... Away from home. And my family and my routine. I've actually been slipping up a lot. And I've got to say that. Things can get pretty dark when I drink, but I'm thankful that I can come here for your support. I see a new face in the back. Will you please stand and introduce yourself? Uh, my name is Wilhelmina s., and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Wilhelmina. Hi. You know I love hanging out at your house... Playing video games, watching movies... But... but do you think we should go somewhere else sometime? What, like your house? Like on a date. Is that weird? No. No, not at all. I love it. You know, our first real date. How about tomorrow night? What are we gonna do? I'll surprise you. Hey, what's up, j.? Hey. Hi, Bobby. Um, you know that my mom is in london, right? Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm here. Listen, I'm thinking. We have a special bachelor party for me, huh? Suarez men only. Tomorrow night. All right. Sounds like fun, but Austin and I have plans. But don't let me stop you and grandpa. From, you know, tearing up the clubs. Can you change your plans? This is important. Uh, I don't really think... it's cool. We can do it another time. Hey, thanks, Austin. All right! Tomorrow night, the three amigos versus the big city. Ooh! Big city, look out. Hidy- ho, bitches! Hey, where'd that bag come from? I rifled through your stuff earlier, and it was not in there. The designer had it messengered to me. I could get used to that. Ooh, as the designated bachelorette, I call dibs on the next freebie. So sorry to interrupt, - I just had to tell you, I loved your last show. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ooh! Aah! Okay, that was, like, the third person who's come up to you. Do they think you're judi dench? I'm afraid not. You see, I had a little show here about a month ago, and, uh, well, some people kind of liked it. Oh, come on. Wow. Christina, your dreams came true. That's not what I saw for you. Oh, I really need a break from her. We're gonna go get a drink at the bar. Yep. Here you go, my dear. Oh, my God, Christina, that's Lindsay dunne. Mm- Hmm. He's, like, the most powerful publisher in all of britain. - Oh, my... he's coming this way. - Christina. Mr. dunne, good to see you. This is my good friend Betty suarez. She actually works at "mode" magazine as a features editor. Ms. suarez, a pleasure. No, me. I mean, I am the pleasured one. Betty is a rising star, actually. Uh, and she's clearly very excited to meet you. Oh. Well, I'm flattered. - I'm always on the lookout for a rising star. - Okay. Would you be interested in an opportunity - to do more? - More? What do you mean? Well, one of my fashion magazines, "ultramod," has lost its new york- based columnist. Being that you're familiar with the sce over there, would you have any interest in interviewing? - Oh. - You can still keep your job at "mode." Wow. That would be amazing. Yes. All right then. Call my office and set up a meeting. Aah! Aah! I have my work, which I love, but it cannot fill the void of my estranged family. Thank you for sharing. Okay, everyone. See you next week. Ms. Slater. I had no idea. Ohh. Tyler, please call me Wilhelmina. Okay. Oh, well. I guess my little secret is out. I'd appreciate it. If you would not s a word to Claire or Daniel. Of course. I mean, I- I know how tough it is when you need to talk, and you can't turn to the people around you. Well, thank God we have our sponsors. You do have a sponsor, don't you? Actually, since I've been here, really haven't been able to connect with anybody. Well, don't say another word. Consider Willie your sponsor. Okay. Would you like another scone? No, I can barely eat. I'm so excited to go to these fashion shows. Hilda, a couple years ago, I was lucky to be standing behind a tent pole, and now... I mean, I don't want to get my hopes up... - But I might get a chair! - Ooh! A chair. That means a gift bag, and as your designated bachelorette- your name is already on it. Yay! Okay, we really have to leave. A waiter has just come up to Amanda. And asked her if she wanted bangers and mash. She followed him into the loo! Turns out, it's just food. Okay, bachelorettes, since I can't be with you, I have plann out the perfect day. Itineraries. Maximizes historical sites. Minimizes... Fun. I was going to say, "travel time." They're just suggestions, and I promise, - I will catch up with you as soon as I can. - All right, but, Betty, you better not be late for my party, or I'm gonna be pissed. - Hey. You know that here that means drunk? - That works, too. Mwah. Hey. Oh, Amanda. Take lots of pictures! So how are things going with the meades? I was so touched by what you shared. About getting to know your family. Oh, I'm actually, uh, going out tonight with Daniel. He wants us to get along. That's very Noble of him. What is it? Well... I've just known the meades for a lo time, and they're not the most... Forthcoming. Well, Claire's been totally straight with me. I mean, just this morning she was telling me. About my father- how they met in rehab. And how she's done everything she could. To track him down for me. Tyler, can I be Frank? They're terrified of you. What? Well, it's true. As far as they're concerned, you're just other claim to their empire. Wh... I- I just want to get to know my family. Well, I know that, but I'm not as cynical as the meades. I wouldn't be surprised. If they tried to pay you off just to get rid of you. Oh, come on. They wouldn't do that, would they? I've held my tongue long enough. I do own half this company, too, so it's time we talk about Claire's bastard child. What are you talking about? You think this hayseed crawled out of his corncrib. And came all the way to Manhattan. Just for a family reunion? - Look, I'm no fan of the guy, but I don't think Tyler's after our money. Daniel, are you that naive? Take my advice. Take him out on the town with his new Big Brother, get him through a couple of velvet ropes. And make him feel like a big shot. Then write him a big, fat check, and stick him on the first train back to hicksville. Well, you're probably right. Even the meades would never sink that low. Sugar? Trey, there you are. Hi, trey. It's Troy, and you know I don't like when you pick new names for me. Actually, I didn't know that. You're so complicated, Trevor. I'm sorry. I have been so busy lately. I got this promotion, but you are in luck, because I've got a wedding this Saturday, and you're my date. Actually, I'm seeing someone else now. What? No, you're not. Yes, I am. Do you really care? You haven't called me in, like, two months. I said I was busy. Look, I get it. I know I came across a little stalker- y, and you got freaked out, but you were my first boyfriend. I was excited. You used to sleep on my stoop. Okay, that... that was one time, and that was because you kept saying, "one minute, I'll be right down," and you never... you didn't show. So I'm patient. There are worse traits. Anyway, now I'm with Brian, so... it all worked out. I'm sure you'll find someone, too. Whoa. My ears are still ringing from that place. I couldn't even hear myself think. Yeah, well, hey, we got a great plan "b" though, right? Pizza, beer, great company. Yeahhow about we find something to watch? Good idea. Hey, Justin, you wanna help me pick out a movie? Betty's got a lot of great musicals here. Come on, Justin. Stop texting and join the party. Hey, one sec. Um... I have to take this, but I think I'm just gonna go over to Marc's. So I don't bother you guys. Hey. Hey. I'm here. I'm all yours. Oh. Yay! No more work. Oh. Oh. Well, I might have to do a little bit of work tomorrow. Mm! But who am I to complain? Work is work, right? What are you guys doing? We decided that every time you say "work,"we drink. Okay. I get it! Tonight is about fun, not work. Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Drink! I said it again! Dare! Whoo! Whoo! Ooh, a brave choice. All right, all right, all right. Oh, God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. I want you to... Flash that guy! No! Yes! No! Betty, just do it. Go show him your mayan temple. Go. Oh! No, I can't do that. Yes, you can. Watch. Whoo! U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.! Whoo! See? No. Okay, I am the queen. I declare it. I want you to flash that stranger! Do it. No! Go, go, go! Just go. Hey! Oh, come on, Betty. Okay, fine! I'll do it. Whoo! Whoo! Oh! Suarez! Everyone said, "when you go to london, don't miss Betty's boobs." I'm just glad there wasn't a line. This is... hilarious! Hi, gio. But I didn't get the shot, so... Hi, gio. Let's just get cheech and Chong back out. Yeah, uh, Amanda! Oh, no, no, no. Girls, girls, stop it. Turn around and let everyone have a look! Christina! Enough. Stop. Enough. Oh. Ow. I don't generally do these this often... Or ever. Right. But when in Rome... Oh, wait a minute. You didn't go to Rome with me, did you? You chose what's- his- name... Egg salad. Henry... and to be fair, I really didn't choose either one of you. What are you doing here? Layover. On my way to provence. A food and wine trip. And you? "Mode" sent me for work. Work! Hey, listen, I'd love to catch up, but I want to see the london eye before it closes, and I'm only here for one re night. You want to check it out with me? No, I can't. Um, it's hilda's bachelorette party, and I can't just go, so... Can you just give us... like, two seconds? Two sec... don't... don't go. Okay. What are you doing? Go with him! What? Why? Betty, you are on vacation! You have been all about work since you got here. You've got a really nice guy here. Who has always been crazy about you. Go have an adventure! He does look sort of good, doesn't he? Yeah, and you might have a plus- one for my wedding! Go! Have fun! Okay. Good news. Queen hilda has granted me permission to go. Wow. It's like a club in here. Yeah, actually it used to have a stripper pole, but I guess it was too hard to wear a seat belt. And work the pole at the same time. Look, , I just want you to know, I'm sorry about the way I've been treating you. It's just, uh, kinda freaky to suddenly find out. You have a half brother. Tell me about it. And then... my mom, your dad... That's an image I don't want stuck in my head. Wait. My dad? Yeah, you know, I never got along with hartley, but I shouldn't have taken that out on you. So you know my dad? Know him? He was the biggest pain in my ass for, like, six months. When he was trying to take over Meade. Mom told you all that, I'm sure. I think we're here. You know what? Just hang on a second, all right? I'm gonna go grease the bouncer, make sure we get v.I.P. Treatment. Be right back. Tyler, everything all right? I think Claire might've lied to me about who my father is. Really? I mean, she's been so nice to me since I got here. Why would she do that? Oh, I don't know. But a lie of that magnitude? If you could never forgive her, it would be completely understandable. I'm out with Daniel right now, and... This news... All I can think about is taking a drink. Slipups are inevitable. And it's okay. I certainly know how tempting a perfectly mixed cocktail. Can be. I can... Almost taste it right now. Mmm. It's like. A warm hug going down my throat. What should I do, Wilhelmina? Oh, remember, if you happen to slip up, I am always here for you, because that's what a sponsor's for. Oh, I really love it here. At this one fashion show, they served a sandch. That was bread, butter and french fries. That's disgusting. It was amazing... carbs, fat and carbs. It was a miracle. The miracle is, you still eat like that and look as good as you do. Oh, thank you. You, too. Mmm, it's so nice to actually see london. I've been stuck indoors at fashion shows. Ever since I got here. Yawn. No, not yawn. I really enjoyed it. Double yawn. I'm serious! I saw two lines that were completely innovative, and most of the rest of them were surprisingly on trend. Ooh- ooh! Look at you. You are a "mode"- y robot. You're a mo- bot. I am not a mo- bot. I am Betty. I am a mo- bot. I care about fashion. I am... on trend. Okay, I know what this is. This is you doing your little button- pushy flirty thing. Just to get to me. No, no, I'm not. Yes, you are. You are flirting. I'm not flirting. I am gio. I am flirting. I'm not flirting. It is okay. I am flirting, too. Betty, I'm engaged. I am... What? Is it just me, or is it weird. That you didn't ntion you were engaged right away? Why? You disappointed? Hurts a little you can't have me, doesn't it, suarez? No! It doesn't hurt. I'm just saying I would think it was weird. That you pked up your ex- girlfriend at a bar. And took her on a romantic stroll. What? I did not pick you up. You flashed me. It was a dare, and I was supposed to be flashing a complete stranger. Why are yostill working at "mode"? What? What... what does that have to do with anything? I thought you wanted to write about things that mattered, like that crap you put in your blog. What do you know about my blog? What, you read my blog? Don't get all excited, but, yeah, I've read it. At luast I did until you stopped posting. I know. I'm busy. I'm an editor now. And I'm interviewing. To write a fashion column for another magazine. Wow. That's a job you never dreamed of. Fashion has been good to me, okay? And since I've been doing it for a while, people actually respect me... As hard as that might be for you to believe. And, okay, you know what? The perks are nice. So you've gotten comfortable? I'm not comfortable. Oh, you're comfortable. Stop. Gio, don't. Don't do that thing that you always do, the "I'm gio, I'm always right!" Look, I'm just saying, hey, I'm just saying... "I'm... know everything." I'm just saying, what was supposed to be. A stepping stone for you has completely become your path. It's not my path! It's... everything that I'm doing. I- is just so that one day, I can create the magazine that I want. You sure about that? Because from where I'm standin it seems like. You're scared to focus on what you really care about. And you're getting more and more involved. In something that doesn't even matter to you. You know what, gio? I haven't even seen you in, like, years, and you show up. And you think that in one hour you know my entire life? Well, guess what? You don't. I have to go back to my sister. I think you'll like this place. It's even better than the last one. Thanks. Hey, take it easy. That's 50- year- old single malt. What, so I don't deserve the good stuff? Look... I realize you haven't had it easy, and I want you to know that there is no way. We're gonna send you home empty- handed, okay? What? This is for you. You gotta be kidding me. No, no. I'm happy to do it, Tyler. U- you're actually trying to buy me off, huh? No, I'm trying to help. Hey, what are you doing? All right. Guys, come on. All right. Guys, come on. Let's take it up the street, all right? No, no. We're fine, we're fine. Listen... are you really that afraid of me, huh? What? Think I'm gonna make problems for you, ittle rich boy, huh? Tyler, take it easy. You're missing... what are you... Hey, hey! Wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Tyler, listen... Christina, you know what's really weird? You're, like, a big, fancy designer in london, and I'm a big shot stylist in New York. You're a stylist now? Well, not in the sense that I have any clients, but I do get to combine all of my favorite interests... Criticizing people, shopping and promoting world thinness. Believe it or not, she really is talented. It's true. I am. Christina, this might be the beer and the jager. And the Tequila talking, but I'm really proud of you. Aw! No, you're a big success! Thank you. But, you know, I was really terrified when I left "mode." All of a sudden, I didn't have a safety net. But do you know what it did? It forced me to take a chance on what I really wanted to do. Hey, you're back! Oh, hey! How was your time with gio? It was a lot... of work. Work! Oh, dear. Here, eat this. I can't. I drank so much last night. I don't remember anything after getting back to the pub. No, neither do I. I vaguely remember calling Billy macduff 00 in the morning and telling him. That our first kiss tasted of Sauerkraut. Ugh! Do you not remember? Seeing gio made us have this idea. To start calling up all our exes? Ugh! Doesn't ring a bell. I have to meet Mr. dunne now. Ooh. Are you sure you don't want to stay just one extra day? Sorry. Miss my boys. Oh. Oh. Oh, come on now. We're not gonna get into a big thing here. We're far too good of friends to say good- bye. Mm. Now you go and kick ass. I will. Whew. Hey, just the guy I was looking for. I got a surprise for you. You ready? Three words... I scored two tickets for you and me to see. Miss bootylicious herself tomorrow night. What do you think? Wow. Thas. I- I just can't go with you. What are you talking about? These tickets are unbelievable. I'm talking fifth row! Yeah, it's just Austin and I already got tickets. Um... and we're actually doing homework right now, so I- I can't really talk. Hey, uh, what if I got one more ticket, huh? We could all go together. Look, I changed my plans last night for your baclor party, and I- I don't want to change them again. What's going on here? I mean, I thought we were cool. Are you, uh, going through some teenage rebellion thing or... You mad that I'm marrying your mother? It's not about you, all right? It... I just... I- I can't go. Honestly, I was surprised that she chose denim, seeing as it's an iconically American fabric. But the way she cut it was completely european. Well, Ms. suarez, your materials are impressive. Christina speaks highly of you, and you're obviously passionate about fashion. Yes, I do. I mean, yes, I am. Good. This is the part of the jo that I love... Making someone's dream come true. You are going to have front- row seats. To every show in New York. And access to anyone you want to talk to. Go- getter like you should move up through the ranks in no time. So how does it feel. Ms. suarez? Um, I'm sorry. Uh... N... uh, I can't do this. I'm... I'm sry? Fashion is not my dream. Well, it's an odd time to be mentioning it. Yes, I know. But the last 24 hours have been crazy. I flashed my ex in a bar, and then he called me a "mo- bot." And I thought he was wrong, but now... I think he's right. I'm following. No, you're not. Uh... I'm sorry. I really appreciate this opportunity, but if you read my blog, you will see what I really want to be writing about. And it isn't fashion. Thank you so much foyour time. Yeah, I just don't- I don't get it. You know, he used to like me. Why am I so bad to hang around all of a sudden? There's no explaining teenagers, brother. Well, I- I even offered to take his buddy, too, you know? I don't know why he doesn't want me there. You're trying too hard, Bobby. Justin will come back to you. When he's ready. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Hey, I'm gonna go talk to him. Uh... Hey, uh, you know, I was thinking about the concert. You know, I- I mean- you... you guys can go. Just please don't tell anyone. No, of course not. Not even my mom. All... all right. Yeah, I won't. But, uh, yeah, I think she'd be cool with it. I just don't want her to kw. All right. It's just between us. Okay. Thanks for meeting me. Lucky for you, I try to get to the airport at the last possible minute. Ugh, I hate that. I like to be there two hours ahead of time. To reorganize my carry- on. There she is. There's the suarez I know. Look, I'm sorryabout last nigh. I think that I got a little overdefensive. Because you made a good point. I know I did. I didn't have to say that. - No. That was annoying, sn't it? - Yes. Anyway... I did what you said. I turned down that job. I know it was the right thing to do, but it's still scary. I mean, what if my blog doesn't take off? What then? I mean, maybe I was on the wrong path, but at least it was a path. You know, when you broke up with me, I thought it was me... That I had to change myself... And I went wild. I tried wraps, open- face, all kinds of crazy stuff. But then I finally went back to what was important to me, and that was making sandwics... Bread, meat, bread. And then I met this girl... A Baker who makes the most amazing rustic sourdough. Our business took off, we fell madly in love, all because we pursued our passion. Well... You seem happy. I am. But you were right, too. I was flirting with you a little. Oh, really? Now I didn't mean anything by it. Mm- Hmm. I didn't! It's just our thing. And besides, I know there's only ever been one guy for you. Ugh! Okay, gio. Can we not go down that path again? We were having a nice moment. You'll always hold special place in my heart, b. I can't believe. You and Tyler got arrested for fighting. Are you sure you don't know where he went? Look, someone bailed him out right before you got there. I didn't see who it was. How did this happen? He just went crazy. You should've warned me he was such an ugly drunk. You let him drink? He's an alcoholic! He's in a.A.! Well, how was I supposed to know that? Did he say anything? What did you talk about? I don't know. Um... His mother, his hometown, hartley... What? I told him about his father... How hartley tried to take over the company, how we forced him out. - Oh, God. What is it? I swore to cal. That I would never tell Tyler who his father was. So I made up a story. I told Tyler I met his fath in rehab. Now he knows I lied. Ohh. Mom. What? I'm sorry, okay? It's gonna be all right. I promise, we'll find him. Oh, feeling any better? Yeah. Thanks for bailing me out last night. Well, I told you I would forgive you. You slipped up. I mean, it... it happens to the best of us. Yeah. You were right. They tried to buy me off. They're terrified... That I'm gonna try to take what they've got. Oh, I'm so sorry. My heart is breaking for you. What are you gonna do? What is owed to me... My share in Meade publications. And I will support you any way I can. Marc, I'm back! What happened to you? Everything... Troy broke up with me, I e two slices of pizza, and now I can't stop thinking about him. Oh, my God. You ate pizza? I can't talk about it! Good. 'Cause I have some really big news of my own. I think it's time for me. To make this stylist thing happen for real. I'm quitting "mode." Oh! Good, you're here. I was just dropping off my reviews of the shows. Thank you so much for sending us to london. We had the best time. You can read all about it on my blog. I just posted all the gory details. Gory, huh? Yeah, I sort of dropped the ball on blogging for a while, so I thought I would relaunch with something juicy. How did, uh, things turn out with you and Tyler? Um, kind of blew up in my face, but at least I'm talking to my mom again. Whoa! You flashed gio in a bar? Yep. But in my defense, I had been drinking. And at least now I know. That all of my ex-boyfriend craziness is behind me. Hey, it's Betty! Remember me? Anyway, I'm in london, and I'm thinking about you. Sorry. That was a hiccup, not a burp. Anyway, hilda's getting married, and I was just wondering. If maybe you'd want to come to the wedding as my date.
