So that's group HR sent me, huh? I only talked to them for a little while. I really like Galvin Which one is he? I don't want to do the interview today. I am starting to feel crazy maybe,because you're eating chocolate covered pretzel for breakfast Thanks I almost eat the whole bag See.Which one of those goophers is gonna do that for me Hey,not too long ago, I was one of those goophers All right. Promise me you will pick someone good I promise Good Do you need anything else? Actually, fact checking. I know you... Come on,what kind of editor would I be if I can't do a little fact checking. Add to my file All of it by two o'clock? No problem Wow, that's a lot reading. But I am happy you let me do it. Japanese to English? I look forward to the challenge. Wow, look at that giant pile. I know. It is carrying all those papers Igoring and rising above What's wrong, Betty? Now you are a big fancy editor and you don't even talk to the little people Oh,I am sorry. I couldn't hear you over your flash shirt - Did you just... - Fashion is my best Suarez. Unexpected Unlike you, Betty.I look great in jewel tones. What's the tude? I tried to be nice to you. But since my promotion, all you do is insult you and sabotage me. So I am done with you. I really like the side of her Do you mind? - Sorry. - No no it's my bad. Here, let me help you. I was wondering if you have any feature ideas for the New York issue What? You mean to write a article? Yeah, unless you are too busy... Oh no no I would love to write an article. Actually, I am working on this concept about the unsung heros of New York. People who do the toughest jobs and we can showcase their uniforms for fashion lingo. New York's 10 most thankness jobs. Sounds perfect Really? Wow,thanks.Ok,great Well I will get to work. Oh Matt,I am really glad that we... - you know. - Yeah, me too. Oh hey Matt. I really like your haircut. Just looks so healthy. Make me wanna pull it. haha..Actually,I didn't get a haircut. Ow,wow,that kinda hurt.Thank you. Bye my god,Mandy.You are five minutes away flipping his arms and lying him down on the desk. Hww, you love him Please. He is tainted. Kissing him is like kissing Betty. Betty.yes.Daniel is looking for you. He wants you to meet the new assistant. Ohh,he picked someone. Is it GalvinÂ£Â¿ I don't think so. Hi Are you Daniel's new assistant? Lexi .like sexy Oh I see. I am Betty, like confetti. I am Daniel's older assistant. I am more than happy to help you. I can show you how things work. I know how things work. I am sure you will be fine. Hey Betty. Did you meet Lexi yet? Lexi,like sexy? Yes, we met. - Daniel. - What? What happened to Galvin? Of all the people HR sent over, that's who you picked. Looks like nothing to do...with it. I can't believe you even think that. I am a widower, Betty You certainly didn't pick her because she's friendly Maybe she is intimidated by you. I told her she has some pretty big shoes to fill.hmm She nailed the interview, totally helpful. Let me get that for you. Just cause she's pretty doesn't mean she is not qualified. You'd know judging a book by its cover works both ways. I am sure if you think she is capable, then she will be great. Where the hell have you been? Can I go out to get some frozen yogurt? If you can go a couple weeks not murdering any boyfriends Did you talk to anyone? You know me,just get one frozen yogurt in me, I just tell all my sercret Is this a joke to you?

No. Er, you both so qualified, with some... Just give us the truth. You have voted trumpt to Wilhemina. Right? Because you're a Mead. Or was it simply that I had more potential as an editor. It was a  very hard decision for us to make. Why are you so caring their feelings, Daniel? We tossed a coin. And you got your job, Betty. Because you were tails. You know, I wanted you in this job. The coin-toss was the only way to break through in-path. No, I know. It's just the only way keeping me going was the feeling That I actually deserved this. Betty, wait. You do deserve this. Believe me. Yeah, I know, I know. Good. Look, I have to run to my layout meeting. Are you sure you're gonna be all right? Yeah. Yes. Right. Hi, tails. I'm so happy to be cleared like that.

I will be right back. And now the candader Archie Rodriguez About a certain photo of my girlfriend. And I just want the press stop showing this photo. Ai, this is not my best angle. Everyone is asking me if I want to apologize to the voters. The truth is the only person who deserves an apology Is my girlfriend. She had her privacy invaded And I'm sorry I wasn't more understanding. As for the voters, they have only to accept the fact that My girlfriend is sexy And I will not apologize for that. Archie. I can't believe you did that. Yeah, and we got the latest polls And thanks to your sexy picture, Hilda, I'm more popular than ever I'm in the lead. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! This is fantasitic.

You know, betty, you're a great writer now, I am not exact in the reading mood right now, Could you just give me the summary. Could you read the top? ************* You're sharing your byline with me? In five years of mode, I've never had a byline. Why are you so nice to me? Either one of us could have gotten this promotion and right before daniel told me He had this look on his face And I thought, that's it, you're leaving tomorow. I were sure of it. I mean I'd say I would been happy for you, but I don't know. You would've been happy. Were you just about to hug me? Shut up. no. You were about to hug me! Okay. ha-ha.
