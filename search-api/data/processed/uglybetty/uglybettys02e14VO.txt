Daughter? I'm going to start a magazine- "Hot flash." If i can't marry into the meade family, I will give birth to an heir. We need to find a surrogate we can control. Do we feel pregnant yet? How long am i trapped here for? I'm renee. I'm daniel. Meade. I know. I see you've met my sister. You think it's too early to start planning family vacations? You're a fool, daniel. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. You just really seemed to up your game when betty showed up. What? I don't think i'm the suarez sister you like. Tell me who you're dating. Henry from accounting. There. More. He got charlie pregnant. I know you're leaving in five months, And i know that i'm gonna get my heart broken, But maybe it's worth it. -==Ææàãðüàöô°öüäê·îï×==- ±¾×öä»½ö¹©ñ§ï°½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾</font> -==Ææàãðü×öä»×é==- ·­òë£º¸öèëid  ð£¶ô£º¸öèëid ê±¼äöá£ºâ¬ ±ó</font> ææàãðü×öä»×é×÷æ· -==Http://www.Ragbear.Com==- ³ó å® ±´ µù µú¶þ¼¾ µú14¼¯</font> What is this place? Where am i? You're in the most amazing place ever.</i> Henry. Happy birthday, betty. I don't understand. We're here because you're going to have</i> The best birthday of your life.</i> Good morning. There she is... good morning. The birthday girl. Feliz cumpleaños, mi amor. Thank you, papi. Happy birthday, chica. Oh, i got something for you.</i> What? You want 23 more? Love the bag, aunt betty. Vuitton?</i> No, it's a fake. I got it from some guy Selling off a blanket on 6th avenue. You know, you make it really hard for me To live vicariously through you. So i know you didn't want anything special this year, But maybe before you head off for the poconos, Some birthday pancakes? Daddy, i love your birthday breakfasts,</i> But henry and i want to get an early start. Well, i hope you and henry have a wonderful weekend. Mm. And, uh, don't forget your cupcakes. Oh, i won't. It was nice of daniel to give you the day off. I know. He was great about it, Except he says now i owe him one. Someone has a short memory. Okay, i know you told us not to, but...</i> Aah! A cell phone! Justin, this is- Wait, is this my cell phone?</i> Turn it over. Aah! I love it. Fierce, huh? Very. Don't do that. No? No. No. No. Okay. Uh, guys, i love you. I'll see you sunday night.

Daniel, i know we've had our issues... You tried to ruin my magazine, destroy my family, Marry my father on his deathbed - Some bigger than others, But i never personally wish you any harm. That's why i'm here to warn you about renee. Renee has a history with men. She becomeneedy, erratic, obsessive. It probably has something to do with daddy withholding affection While we were growing up. I mean, i've dealt with it well, but renee on the other hand- Stop. You don't have to say anymore. I don't believe anything you have to say. Stony brook. What? Ask my sister about stony brook If you really want to get to know her. How was i? Excellent. Sincere, but not condescending, Just the right dash of menace And your breasts, of course, look amazing. You've gotten under his pasty, hairless skin, woman. Well, i better. Renee's a loose cannon. I can't have that, not with what i have planned. Oh, god, this bloody window. Oh, is a nice breeze too much to ask for? I bet my sister had it bolted shut. Evil robots don't need oxygen. Oh. Let me help you. Oh, go on, please. Ohh. Ooh. This should freshen things up a wee bit. No candles... ever. Okay. Christina, okay, wait. Repeat, please, And try to enunciate. I'm sayin' there's something goin' on with her, And i am going to find out what it is. With who? Wilhelmi's sister-Renee. She's strange. Like, just now. Like, listen, I tried to light a candle... And she totally freaked out. What? A-A candy? What type of candy? Why were you lighting it? A candle. I can't hear you. Justin bedazzled my cell phone... And i think there's glue in the circuitry. I know. It's a mystery... But i'm gonna find out. Okay, i'll talk to you later. * happy birthday to me * Henry! * birthday girl in the house * I'm ready to get in the car, go on our adventure! I love adventures. Where are we going? Charlie. Charlie. I-I didn't even know you were in town. Well, you know, i've been trying for months to get Into this parenting seminar with harvey karp.

And check this out- She wants to do an ongoing series About extreme adventure for the over-50 set. It only adds $50,000 an issue. You gotta talk to her. No. You wanted to be in charge.

Wow, mom, it's so saucy. I know... And if you look closely, you can see a nipple imprint. I've still got it. So listen, mom, We need to talk. Oh, that sounds ominous. What is it? It's about the budget for "hot flash." Given the current realities of the market, I just-I can't put any more money into the project. You're cutting me off? W- We haven't even launched yet, A- And i still need funding for a staff. I'm sorry. Don't do this me. You're my daughter. I'm also your boss. Ooh. Let me help you with that. I got it. Thank you. Wil said you'd be comin' by. She sure is working you with all this baby stuff. I know, but it's nothing Compared to what she must be going through, Planning for motherhood and all to- Where is she, anyway? Deep tissue massage. Yeah, she skipped the baby c.P.R. Class And made christina go alone. Oh, oh. Of course she did. Well, maybe the massage will help Circulate the ice in her veins. Oh, oops. Did i say that out loud? No, honey, please, it's okay. I know how my sister is. Hmm. So, it is, uh, happy hour. I was just about to make myself a drink. You like chocolatinis? Liquor and chocolate? Oh, gee, i don't know. Bring it. Betty. Mrs. Meade. I'm so sorry. I try to keep up the appearance that i never use the bathroom. I hope you won't think less of me. Oh, um, no. No. I really, really won't. Are you okay? Oh, my own daughter just told me That she doesn't believe in my magazine. Alexis said that? Well, not in so many words, but it was pretty clear. She thinks the magazine is just a fantasy, a pipe dream. So i have decided not to move forward with "hot flash." I'm calling it quits. No. Mrs. Meade, so what if it is a fantasy? That doesn't mean you can't make it come true. Ju-Just today, all of my dreams were crushed, And i-I picked myself up, I utilized my resources, And now things are gonna be even better. Betty, what resources do i have? Everyone i know has turned their back on me. But you're the most resourceful person i know. You can do anything. You're very perky, you know that? I've heard that before. So what dreams of yours were crushed today? Well, it's my birthday... oh. And there was a change in plans, but everything is fine. Henry and i are going to dinner. How do i look? Oh, no, no. I couldn't. Yes, you can. Hey, it's betty. Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i> Hey, betty. I've got some bad news. Charlie's not feeling well, So i'm gonna have to take her to the doctor. Don't go to the restaurant. I'll meet up with you later. Betty, i'm so sorry. Love you. One unheard message. Betty- ...go to the restaurant. I'll meet up with you- I love you. Um, suarez. Reservation for two. So willie really got that girl to eat dog food? Yeah, that girl was her best friend.</i> She called it a loyalty test. Portrait of a mean girl, age 15. Wilhelmina's always been good at getting people to do things They didn't want to do. She still is. Really? Oh, yeah. How so? Well, she practically forced christina to carry this baby So she could get the money to save her husband's life. No! Yes! And when chriina finds out who the sperminator is... i thought it was an anonymous donor. It's bradford meade. No. She stole the sperm from his dead corpse, And when the bastard heir is born, She will finally get her hands on a third of the meade empire.</i> Mm. Oh, i think i'm gonna vomit. Excuse me. Thank you. * quand tu dits des mots d'amour *</i> * des mots comme je t'adore * * i love you more... * Are you ready to order? Um, actually, no, not yet. Or, you know what? Um, i could start with a... The, uh... uh, the-The cheese fondue. That dish is for two people. Oh. Yeah. There will be two of us. Uh, my boyfriend is, uh, on the way. He's coming. It is a lot of cheese. We're hungry. Okay, one cheese fondue for you And your boyfriend. * la la la la la la * Okay. Okay, henry. Thanks for calling. Henry is canceling on betty? Charlie's not feeling well. Yeah, right. Beeyotch. What? You know you guys were thinking it. All right, familia suarez. You know what this means.</i> Betty needs a party. I got the piñata. I'll clear a dance floor. And i'm making the cupcakes. And i was like, "slow your roll, mary-Kate. You just can't call dibs on every hot piece of... " pie. Gotta go. That is so sweet of you. Thank you. Yeah, well, it's for betty. Ha. What? You just reminded me of a really funny story. See, betty's "boyfriend" called earlier, And he is totally blowing her off For their big birthday date tonight. See? Did you give her this message? I'm a receiver, not a giver. Can i have that now? How precious. Did you make it yourself? It's a gift from daniel, "with all his love." Oh, you're not gonna ruin this relationship, wilhelmina, Not unless you want your own dirty laundry out in the open. Whatever are you talking about? I know about bradford's baby, And your plan to g your claws into the meade fortune. Oh, i know about all of it. Mm, you know nothing. She stole the sperm from his dead corpse</i> And when the bastard heir is born,</i> She will finally get her hands</i> On a third of the meade empire.</i> Oh, i think i'm gonna vomit. Last time i checked, sperm-Stealing was illegal. I think this is all daniel's gonna need To go straight to the police, Unless... unless what? Less you leave me and daniel alone. Let me have what i want, and you can have what you want. You really want to do this? Oh, yes. Very well, then. I'm gonna go spend the night at my boyfriend's. Madam- Mademoiselle, please. I'm only 24. Yes, i'm so sorry. See, it has been a while, And it is friday night, And we are very booked. And? There is a couple waiting for this table. It is their anniversary. It's my birthday, And-And my boyfriend- He's not here. We apologize. May i offer you a doggie bag for the cheese? Cheers. Betty. Gio. Whoa. What are you doing here? And why are you in a carriage? Henry left a message with amanda. He can't make it tonight. Charlie. So i'm not trying to take his place or anything, But when i heard you were on your own, I remembered my cousin drives these things for tourists, And i thought, she deserves to have a little fun. So what do you say? Want a ride? I- I don't know, gio. Come on. Once around the block. Fine. Once around the block. All right. Willie, i know i screwed up, But breaking into daniel's apartment, Isn't that a felony? I'm too pretty for prison. They'll pass me around like a collection plate At a catholic church. Stop whining. You owe me. And prison is exactly where i'll end up If they find out how this baby was really conceived. I feel like you'd do well in prison. I would. Hmm. Now relax. You don't have to break in. Don'you think i would have had An extra set of keys made for daniel's apartment? Oh, marc, you underestimate me. I hate myself even more. Okay, willie, i'm going in. But if i don't make it out alive... We'll always have bergdorf's, darling. We all know what it's li to be ignored, Taken for granted, Not valued. That is never going to happen To the staff at "hot flash" magazine Because this isn't just a job. It's a family. Speaking of family, I'd like to introduce you all To my beautiful daughter alexis meade. Hello. Can i talk to you for a sec? Mom, what's going on? I thought i told you there's no money to hire a staff. Relax, darling, i don't need your money Or anyonelse's. I'm using my own resources. Turns out there's a work program For recently released inmates. It's subsidized by the state, so my overhead is minimal. They're prisoners? Ex-Prisoners... like me. Mom, do any of them have any experience? They have life experience, And that's what "hot flash" is all about- Your life just changed. What do you do now? I can't think of a better talent pool. All right, let's get back to work. Whew! Anybody have a fan? It is hot in here. And then the weekend of my 10th birthday, There was this blizzard, So no one could get to the party, And we couldn't leave the house, So we had to eat leftover cake for weeks. Hmm. Well, that's not so bad. Yeah. Whoa. Why are we stopping? Snowflake has to take care of some business. Oh. Sorry. Not quite the birthday you imagined, huh? Eh, it's my own fault. I had thistupid fantasy- Fireworks, epic romance... like romeo and juliet. Oh, you know those two ended up dead in a tomb, right? Yeah, i don't like thinking about that part. All right. Fantasies are fun, but we live in reality. It's not perfect, But it doesn't mean it can't be pretty good. I know. I know, i know, and-And-And it is. I'm lucky, Except for the part where henry's leaving me After his baby's born. It's getting late. I should get home. No. You're not going home. I'm not? Nope. We're heading to central park. We can still catch the end of that show. Betty wants fireworks for her birthday, She's gettin' fireworks. Hello? Hello. Oh, daniel meade, you naughty, naughty boy. What are you doing? Oh, god. I, uh, i'm... I'm... I want you. Excuse me? You, you big, sexy... magazine editor.</i> I want you. I love you. I've always loved you. Stop that. This smells like wilhelmina. No. It smells like the beginning of something beautiful. I'm calling the police. Oh! Well, we'll always have this moment. Ciao. Have you heard from betty? Her phone's not working. Ay. Here comes somebody. Is it her? No, i need more time. This banner is subpar. Ay, just hang it. Who cares?</i> It's not betty. Hi. Hi. Thought you were at the doctor. I- I was. Um, everything's fine. They couldn't find anything wrong. I think charlie was just trying to ruin my night with betty. I can't believe i fell for it. Me, either. But this is your baby we're talking about. What are you gonna do, right? Thanks. Just glad i didn't miss betty's party completely. Is she here? Not yet. Thank you. I don't think we're gonna make it. It sounds like it's almost over. Somebody had to stop for hot chocolate. What? We're gonna make it, okay? What was that? Crap. Think i busted a wheel. I'm gonna try to rig something up. Oh, okay. Well, here, i can help. No, no. No. You stay in the carriage. I don't want you to dirty your dress. Oh-Oh! Betty! Oh, no. You okay? I'm okay. Oh, no. Man, uh... uhh... I think i have a, uh... Napkin. Okay. Thanks. Yeah.

Becausi haven't told you everything. You can. Trust me. All right. Well, it was back in college At stony brook. I had a breakdown, And i went to a treatment facility. Still see a shrink. And, uh... I take these every day. - It was a long time ago, you know, But i guess i'm still a little sensitive about it. Thank you for telling me the truth. Yeah. But if you think for a second That's gonna make me want to be with you any less, You're wrong. Really? Don't take that apartment. Will you move in with me? Oh, hell, yeah. I wonder what mr.

Like i give a tinker's fart about that recording. No one's gonna believe the rantings of a drunken fool. Hey, feelings. Out. And no one's gonna believe a crazy woman, either. Show me. Are you sure those are the right pills? They were the ones in that hideous green bag.</i> What did you replace them with? Your fat-Blockers. They were the only ones that matched. Oh, marc, we want her crazy, not crazy and thin. Oh, right. Well, no matter. Those pills are all that stand Between my sister and the nuthouse.

Papi... There will never be a day when i don't need cupcakes... Or you. Actually, i could really use e of those cupcakes Right about now. Well, i may have a few... dozen Left in the kitchen. Really?
