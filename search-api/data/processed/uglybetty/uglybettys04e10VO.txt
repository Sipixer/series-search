(whirring) dr. Farkas, can you stop that, please? Sorry. It's getting in my nose. Oh. (chuckles) I'm sorry. I, uh, God, you look great. Oh. Thanks. (chuckles) What's--what's different about you? Oh, I don't know. Small changes no bangs. New glasses. Mm-hmm. Better to see me with. (chuckles) Uh, are you still working at the magazine? Yep. But I'm not an assistant anymore. I'm an editor. Good for you. That's--that's great. Mm. And in case you're wondering, I... Am recently single. Oh. I wasn't wondering, But, um, I'm glad to know it. Well, I'm glad you're glad. (chair whirring) Okay, uh, since it's out there, um, What about dinner tonight? I'm a professional. I don't get grossed out by food caught in braces. That's very generous of you, But, um, I have a boyfriend. Oh. Well, I, uh, kind of wish you said that before. (chuckles) I feel like an idiot. No. Come on, d-don't. I--I'm flattered. I hope so because I'm--I'm doing great, Pulling in the high five figures-- Well, mid fives with a little creative accounting, but... Can your new boyfriend compete with that? He's pretty comfortable. So when are my braces coming off? Maybe when you lose the rich guy. (laughs) I'm kidding. I don't know. Soon-ish. L--but is it--is it serious between you two? Yeah, it's serious. Um, "soon-ish"? What does that mean? You know, betty, I can't-- I can't play this game anymore, So I'm--I'm gonna need you to... (clears throat) find a new orthodontist. Or--or maybe your--your boyfriend can pry them off With all of his money. (birds chirping) (grunts) (yawns) Oh, I forgot to tell you what happened in the copy room today. The toner exploded all over marc. I know. I was there, remember? We're together all the time, every day. It's great, isn't it? Yeah. Night. Good night. Mm. (sighs) Hey! Look who stayed here last night. Haven't seen you in ages. Well, I thought it would be nice For matt and I to do our own thing for a change. These were just dropped off. Oh! Ooh. Let's see who they're from. (matt, singsongy) miss you much.</i> Oh! They're from matt. (singsongy) he's been laying it on thick lately. No, he hasn't. He's just been sweet, but... Miss you much. Miss you much. Miss you much.</i> Annoying. I didn't say that. We've just been spending a lot of time together. Watch out, because I have seen this before. Couples start out all lovey-dovey, Attached at the hip. And then as time goes by, they get totally sick of each other. Guys, matt and I are not sick of each other. Miss you much. Miss you much. Miss you much.</i> Miss you mu-- I'm a little sick of that. Yeah, well, see? It's the little things that'll get you. One day matt is saying, "miss you much!" And the next day, pop! Pop! Murder/suicide. I have to go. I love you. (lowers voice) so, hilda, What's going on with your, um, you know? (door opens and closes) You decided to have the baby. You gotta tell papi and justin some time.</i> And what about bobby? He's the father. I don't even know if he should know. I'm just saying, all those rumors in high school About his family being connected-- It's one thing to date a bad y. It is another thing to raise a kid with one. That was a rumor 15 years ago. Bobby is a sweet guy underneath all of that macho stuff. Maybe you should just spend a little bit more time with him, Get to know him. (sighs) It's done. Connor's agreed to give me account numbers, And you'll have your money back. This is fantastic. As soon as we buy hartley out, I can guarantee you'll return to "mode" as co-editor-in-chief With a 50% stake in the company. (flames whoosh) Mm, not so fast. There's still one remaining issue. I will not come back to run the magazine with you As long as this woman is creative director. Well, what can I do? Denise has a 4-year contract. How is that possible? This woman knows absolutely nothing about fashion. Look what she's wearing-- straight out of last month's "lucky" magazine, page 46. She actually thinks emporio armani And giorgio armani are brothers. Ha! Ha! (sighs) Well, maybe that's why she hasn't given an interview yet. She's afraid if she opens her mouth, She'll make a complete fool of herself. If only we knew someone who had connections to the media. Yeah, I know. Oh. Yeah, yeah, right. (indistinct conversations) I missed you last night. Mm. I know. I got the flowers and the card. That was very sweet. Thank you. Guess what? I scored us two tickets to the rangers game tonight. First thousand fans get a commemorative puck. No, I can't. I have that late photo shoot downtown. Oh. But go anyway. Go without me. You can't miss puck night. It won't be much fun without you. Come on. Someone around here will want to go to a hockey game. (chuckles) Okay, maybe not. But go. Bring me back a puck. Well, I guess I'll, uh... (singsongy) miss you much. Have fun. (indistinct conversations) (camera shutter clicks) ohh! What are you doing? I'm documenting your change.</i> My what? Okay, you have been daniel's assistant for a week now, And I can already see it happening right there. I missed one waxing appointment. So what? So what? I have taken your picture every single day this week. Look. (beeping) I was trying something. Oh, my god! (screams) oh, my god. Spooky. You're trans-mexi-fying right before our eyes. (door open) Thank you so much for the ride, bobby. It's elizabeth taylor week on lifetime... (door closes) and I could not miss "butterfield 8." She plays a prostitute who has to pay for her sins, so yeah. Hi! (justin) hi. Kid was screaming at me to run every red light. I almost clipped a nun. Oh! (chuckles) thank you for dropping him off. Yeah, no problem. (train rattling in distance) Hey. What's up? Um, I know that we haven't had, uh, a lot of chances To talk lately, so I was wondering if maybe you wanted To grab a cup of coffee or something. (chuckles) I knew it. You knew what? Justin told me you and archie split. It's 'cause of me, right? Wrong. Come on. I mean, I definitely had something to do with it. No, you definitely had nothing to do with it.</i> You know, the more you tell me that it didn't, The more I know it did. Oh, my god. I'm not gonna argue with you about it, bobby. Do you want to have coffee or not? Yeah, all right. Coffee sounds fun. I'm always up for a little fun with you. No fun. Just coffee. Okay, okay. Nobody's gonna have any fun. We'll just drink coffee. We don't even have to talk. Good. (door closes) So is denise still in the concept meeting? It should be breaking up-- oh, my god. What's-- back! What is wrong? My one-night stand from the bahamas--troy. He works at "mode"! Wow. That must be awkward. Uh, how long do we have to stay like this? Oh, sorry. (gasps) J-- I didn't think he'd be back so soon. His passport accidentall ended up in my bag-- Completely innocent, fully deniable mistake, But now it's like he's some sort of stalker. I knew that was him at my gym and my bank And my backup gym and my-- know what? You're on your own. It's time to start operation "get rid of denise." Denise, hey, good news. I got us an interview on "fashion buzz" tomorrow. Really? Tomorrow? Kinda has to be. Do you know how hard it is to get on "fashion buzz"? Aren't you guys on that, like, every day? Well... (clearthroat) I know it seems that way. Uh, well, I just wish I had more time to prepare. Oh, come on. You're gonna do great. Besides, suzuki is no diane sawyer. Okay. ...Sort of distracting, so if we could just do a couple frames Without it so we have some options--aah! Guess who? Matt? Surprise! Hey! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? What happened to the rangers game, Commemorative puck night? I figured, puck it. We already spent one night apart. I couldn't stand being apart one more minute. (singsongy) missed you much. Okay. Ohh. (camera shutter clicks) Ugh. You make me puke. (singsongy) "miss you much! Miss you much!" (normal voice) how can you miss me much When we spend every day and every night together?! (slurring) you've sucked the life outta me! I had dreams before I met you! You want to know what my dream is?! That you drop dead Maybe then I can miss you much! (glass shatters, flames whoosh) (gasps) Missed you much, too. Sync by ReHelen So your problem is Your boyfriend w to spend time with you? (lowers voice) shh, no. My problem is he wants to spend all of his time with me.</i> I feel like we're gonna start resenting each other. Doesn't he have anything else going on? Well, he used to. I mean, he used to be passionate about all sorts of things-- Sports, painting, and he was really good. I mean, look at this. Matt did that? Yeah! Wow, it's pretty good. I know! Hey, look at you in the window. But why is your hand all blurry? 'cause I'm waving. Cute. He loved painting, but when he came to "mode," He just let it go. Well, maybe you can inspire him, You know, get him back into it again. Hmm. That's a really good idea. You know what? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give him back his passion. (gasps) hi! Aah... We haven't had a chance to talk since I got back. I know. We haven't. (singsongy) okay, bye! Just promise me you'll keep this Saturday night open. My parents are coming down from boston, And they are dying to meet my first boyfriend. Mercy. Actually, u're my first everything. Oh. Ohh. I'm your first? Aren't you, like, 40? (lowers voice) you were so worth the wait. (banging) (knock on door) Look, I know we were supposed to meet at the coffee shop, All right? But I, uh, I got you a little gift. (chuckles) What the hell?! Look, I saw this, and I thought of justin. He can watch "butterfield 8" or whatever On a big screen tv. It's better. This is--is too much. (chuckles) don't worry about it. I-I got a good deal on it. A deal. What kind of a deal-- Like a disappeared from a loading dock kind of a deal? Oh, hey. What kind of thing is that to say? Most people--they would say, "hey, thank you." So you gonna give me one? (train rattling in distance) thank you. (grunts) unh-unh. No, that sounded like it hurt. Give me another one. Come on. Thank you. No, I don't buy it. We're gonna have to work on that. (chuckles) So I would love to get your perspective on this,</i> Denise ludwig, new creative force here at "mode." Everybody's talking about this "recession" And how no one can afford a manicure. So why do people keep spending $500 On the perfect pair of jeans? Suzuki, I love that question, And no one can answer that better Than my favorite designer roberto dipaolo himself. "fashion is a dream you put on in the morning." Can't live without a dream, suzuki. I think that says it all. I shall no longer worry about the fate of this magazine. Cut. Mama needs some powder. Well, we didn't totally stink up the joint. I mean, you were amazing. I had no idea you knew so much about fashion. (lowers voice) oh, I don't. I paid some freshman at f.I.T. Like 40 bucks To pull some quotes. I think he got that one from "lucky." Honestly, I just--I can't get my head arou fashion. You can't? No. It's just dumb. But you know what? It doesn't even matter. I don't care if it's donna karan Or dog food. It's just something to sell. Now that suzuki is he gay? Because I thought I saw him sneaking a peek at my snookie. (man) where's this go? Excuse me. In the next room with the other paintings. Yes? Um, I just read about Your upcoming emerging artists showcase, And I was wondering if you'd be interested In featuring an up and coming painter? What have you done? Oh, me? No, nothing. I'm talking about my boyfriend. He's a painter, and he's very good. He painted this. Interesting. So this was painted by your lover. My boyfriend. Boyfriend? Boring. Well, it's simple. Nice use of perspective. What's this, uh, smudge? Oh, that's me waving. I'm beginning to see the resemblance. Oh, he's quite good, your lover. Yes, my boyfriend is great, And this showcase is perfect for him. He's emerging, he's an artist, And it's exactly the lift he could use right now. Well, unfortunately, I can't commit to anything By just one painting. Oh, no, he has dens more. They're in his storage unit. I could take you there. All right, I'll have a look. But I'm warning you-- your lover better be good. Oh, my lover is good... At painting. It's the same thing with these overpriced rags, you know?</i> I don't care if it's donna karan or dog food,</i> It's just something to sell. In light of denise ludwig's blasphemous interview,</i> I've been pumping my contacts at "mode" for info.</i> Late word into the "fashion buzz" newsroom</i> Is denise has resigned from her post</i> And is returning to her hollywood roots</i> Running a major tv studio. (engine revs)</i> This is a category 5 crap storm. Well, fortunately, wilhelmina is available To step right back in to her old job. Over my dead body. I couldn't have described your body better, claire. What is she doing here? We are not hiring her back. Actually, cal, we don't need your vote anymore. That's right. The stolen meade money has been recovered. It has? We can cut you a check for your investment plus interest By the end of business today. Wait a minute. You two are partners in this, aren't you? You set up that denise video, and now you're trying To push cal out. I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. You don't tell me when to leave. No one does. Well, I was hoping you weren't gonna make this difficult. You don't know what difficult is. But you might learn yet. Mom-- I don't want to hear it. You choose this woman over family? I think that speaks volumes. (sighs) I give you one simple task. Why am I so surprised you frakked it up? You let me deal with my mother. We get her on our side, she'll convince cal to leave. Thanks again for coming to see matt's work. A show would be so amazing, Give him the focus he needs. Um, frances? Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. My focus was drifting because these paintings</i> Just aren't holding it. Really? Well, he's competent enough, But they're so uninspired. He hasn't found his voice yet. Well, no, I mean, keep looking. His voice has to be in here somewhere. (matt humming) That's matt. Um, I really want to keep this a surprise, So can you just be quiet? I'll be right back. (continues humming) Hey, hey, hey. What--what are you doing here? I followed you. What are you doing here? I forgot my cell. Wait, how could you have followed me-- I missed you much! Let's go to lunch. Great. Uh, get your cell phone. Uh-- What are you gonna do if I call you? Uh, why wod you have to call me if you-- Go, go! Okay.</i> (keys jangle) Did you find anything? Yes, the ones in the back are aming-- So full of passion and drama! I think we have an emerging artist here. Great. Awesome. Take whatever you want. We can figure out the details later. Thank you so much! Thank you for what? Thank you so much For... Always being hungry when I am. We're so in tune. I'm starving. Let's go. Ugh, this is unacceptable, marc. I can't wait for dum-dum to make things happen for me. We have to put pressure on claire. (cell phone ringing) Oh! (snorts) It's dum-dum-- uh, I mean daniel. Probably misplaced his beard comb again. Oh, yes, I forgot you're daniel's bootlick now. Go ahead. I'll figure out a way to do it myself. Yes, claire meade was in south dakota.</i> I arranged for the travel myself. Victoria hartley told you about south dakota?</i> She told me her husband got you pregnant.</i> (woman speaking spanish) Mija, this is amazing. There is a picture in the picture. Where did this come from? Bobby stopped by earlier. Bobby talercio gave us this tv? Great. It's probably stolen. Did you get a receipt? Why do we even have to go there? You know his family. They're corrupt. That is a vicious rumor. Nobody was ever convicted. You know, bobby told me over coffee-- wait, wait, wait. You had coffee with him? Yeah, yesterday. It's no big deal. It is a big deal. I don't want you hanging out with him. Well, you can't tell me who I can and can't hang out with. I'm not 17 years old, you know. Then stop acting like it. It's like you're making the same mistakes all over again. Ay, papi, enough.</i> No, no, no. First, you break up with archie, And now you're hangin' out with bobby. What's wrong with bobby? He's a thug. He always was and he always will be. (sighs) (gasps) (gasps) Whoa. (gasps) (laughing) Oh! (grunts) Ooh! Hello, dear. Let's have a little chat, shall we? What was claire doing in south dakota? Ow. You're hurting me. I'm not touching you. . Well, how would I know what she's doing in south dakota? I don't even know where that country is. Look at me. No. Marc told me never to look you directly in the eye. Amanda... It--it is amanda, right? Yeah. Are you happy here? Answering phones, getting coffee-- Don't you want more out of life? Actually, I do want to do more someday, You know, like, in fashion. I could make that happen. You could? Of course. I may not be in charge now, but I will be again, And I could make your dreams come true. Or I could keep you stuck behind that reception desk Until your skin turns the texture Of a weathered louis vuitton overnight bag. So tell me, what was claire doing in south dakota? I won't tell you. I promised mrs. Meade I'd keep her secret. It's a pity, because you're the kind of woman That would appreciate the value of accessorizing. It pulls the whole outfit together. (gasps) Damn you. I am not having this conversation with you again. Why are you still defending him? This company is our legacy. You're letting him destroy it. I mean, all he cares about is his bottom line. Just admit it, daniel. You don't like that cal and I are sleeping together. Oh, mom. And you're letting your emotions cloud your judgment. My judgment? You're the one who's thinking with your... Not with your brain. Cal hartley is a ruthless, amoral monster. That is not true. I have known that man for 30 years. He's a good man, and he cares about this company, And he cares about me. After everything I've been through, I would have hoped that you would allow me This little bit of happiness. Did you get this from betty? "surprise showing of new work From emerging artist matt hartley." (groans) my lunch is emerging from my stomach. (chuckles) we're totally going though, right? You're going to matt's opening? Huh. Could be our second date. I love you. Is it too early to say that? You know what? I don't care. You're my boyfriend, and I... Love you. (grunts) (clears throat) (Owers voice) okay, at is up with that? If I'd known he was a guh-virgin, I never would have taken his delicate flower. This is too much responsibility. I have to dump him. No! He's imprinted on you like a gay duckling. If you don't wean him off you slowly, he'll die. You're right. Best pot stickers in new york. I know. I told you. Hey, look at this-- "emerging artists." Let's check it out. "emerging artists"? Let's go back to my place. Cheesy popcorn and a movie. This will be better. Better than cheesy popcorn? I doubt it. It'll be close. Come on. All right, if it's what you want, I'll do it for you. No, matt. This is not about me. (all) surprise (both chuckle) These are my paintings. These are your paintings? What is this? What did you do? What did you do? Matt, these are--</i> Marvelous! You must be the artist. You know, I-I think there's been some-- I've gotta be honest with you. When I first saw your work, meh. But then I saw these pieces-- The texture, the depth-- The barely concealed hostility. You've got yourself quite a little muse here. Come. People are dying to meet you, And not just people... (singsongy) people! Betty. (sighs) Mija, I... I don't know what to say. Hey, I do. The dude can paint!</i> I did this so that matt would be passionate about his art. But all his art is about me. Well, that's not true. Okay, there is a theme, But look, there's a nice landscape over here With trees and snow. And look. I don't see you here. Why do all the deers have braces? (betty) ugh. I have to go find matt. I'm gonna go have a pomatini. Why don't you ask him about the receipt? Receipt? What's he talking about? Oh, he worries, you know? About the tv, like if it breaks or something, And we have to return it. (chuckles) There's a receipt, right? Don't worry about the receipt, okay? Anything goes wrong with the tv, I'll get you a new one. I'm gonna get a drink. I love it. It reminds me of late peria drusenferd. Oh. Oh, french is so beautiful. That was english. Oui.</i> Hey, betty. Great show. (gasps) Hey, guys, have you seen matt? The real matt or the matt who's a human sacrifice And you're an aztec warrior cutting out his heart? Or the matt who's an astronaut And you're an alien embr bursting out of his chest? (snickers) Okay, I get it. What is that? Oh, this? I bought it. I don't know why, But it just kind of spoke to me. (camera shutter clicks) excuse me. (cell phone beeps) ugh. Troy, where are you? Diyou follow the directions I gave you? Uh-huh. Connecticut. Great. (singsongy) keep going. You're almost here. (beep) poor, poor little duckling. Shut up. We should be going. We don't want to miss matt's big night. You want to explain this to me? Where did you get this? It doesn't matter. You told me you got rid of the baby. And I did, Just not the way we discussed. You lied to me. I'm sorry. I should have told you. But everything's fine. I-I went to south dakota. He's doing very well. What? You saw him? Tell me he doesn't know I'm the father. No, he doesn't. Wh-wh-wh-why would you ask me that? Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because I spent my entire life Building my business and my career, And now you tell me there's some little bastard out there Who could just waltz in here and demand his cut! Cal, he's our son. I already have a son! This is... A fire That I'm gonna have to piss on before I get burned. I just--claire, what were you thinking, That you would just go out And find our long lost little boy And we'd wind up happily ever after? Is that it? You couldn't have just had the abortion? (indistinct conversations) Matt! Do you know how humiliated I am? These paintings are my private thoughts. No one was supposed to see them. They make me look crazy. Well, they make me look like a monster. Is this really how you feel about me? I painted most of them when we were broken up. There are good ones, too. Those aren't selling for quite as much. There's a bidding war On the one of me climbing the empire state building, Holding you in my giant, hairy hand. Look, it is just an outlet, betty. What, you've never felt angry with me? Never secretly thought I was acting like a jerk? No! I mean, yes, of course, everyone feels that, But we don't hang it in a gallery. I didn't hang them in a gallery. You did. Why did you do this? Because I... I wanted to surprise you. I wanted to help you feel passionate about something. I feel passionate... About us. No, matt, About something other than us. We spend every minute of every day together. We wake up together. We go to work together. We eat together. We brush our teeth together. I'm sorry you feel smothered by our relationship. No, that's what I'm saying. And maybe the problem isn't that I have too much passion, It's that you don't feel enough. (door closes) (clink) Mom? I thought you and cal were going to matt's show. We had a change of plans. Okay. Look, I was thinking aut our conversation today About cal. Let's not talk about cal. Believe me, I'd rather not. Just, uh... Wanted to say I'm sorry. I did let it get personal. I meant what I said about meade being a family business, Our family business. I won't let him come bween you and me. Thank you. (mouth full) mmm! Thank you. (chuckles) Oh, my god! Ha you tried these bacon-wrapped thingies? To die! Hilda, you better slow down If you don't want papi to figure out you're eating for two.</i> Shut up! Ow! God! Are you okay? Did you see matt? Well, I tried, but he just freaked out on me. He said I don't have enough passion. That son of a bitch. That's a little strong. He is dead! (bobby) catch you next week. What the hell is your problem?! What are you talking about? First you bring a hot tv to my house, And now you're bribing a cop? What? Whoa, lady. Nobody's bribing nobody. Man, you almost had me. You almost had me convinced That you were actually a decent guy. This is mikey from the neighborhood. Oh, hey. We played cards last night. He took me to the cleaners. I'm st making good on it. That's it. How stupid do you think I am? You know what? Papi was right. Once a thug, always a thug</i> Hey. Hey! No. What's up with you, huh? Why are you all up in my business? I don't know what your business is. I can never tell if you're telling me the truth Or pulling a fast one. So I keep you on your toes. You used to like that. We're not kids anymore, bobby. Fine. Look, what do you want from me? I don't know. Maybe I just want to believe what you're telling me And not drive myself crazy Thinking that every word out of your mouth is a con job. It might make having your baby a little easier. Hey. Hey. Did I hear papi leave?</i> Yep. Left early, won't say a word to me. What about bobby? No, I haven't spoken to him Since he freaked out and took off yesterday. Maybe papi's right. Maybe he's not the right guy.</i> Or maybe it just wasn't the easiest way For him to find out. Yeah, I guess. What aboutatt? You talked to him? No. I left him a message. He didn't call back. I mean, even if he did, I don't know what I'd say. He thinks I'm not passionate enough. Oh, bull! Remember when you were 12 and you thought If you didn't marry a hanson brother You were gonna die? And then in junior high When you found out that eddie garcia was gay? And you wanted to kill yourself. Wait. I didn't tell you... You read my diary? What? That stuff with henry was so hot.</i> Hilda, how could you?! What? I'm your sister. I'm nosy. So sue me. The point is you got plenty of passion. And at least you got a decent guy to focus it on. Well, maybe you do, too. Hey. Hey. Can I come in? It's cold out here. Thanks. Mm-hmm. (door closes) Look, I'm, uh, sorry about last night. It was just a bit of a shock. And I know I haven't given you much reason To believe I'm a good guy, But I'm a good guy. You know? I want to be there for you, For our kid, as much as you'll let me. A little peace offering. Something for the baby. And the receipt's in the bag. Okay? (laughs) Oh, marc. Hide me. Make yourself huge. Huh? And bloat. Bloat. No. (grunts) hi. Sorry I missed you last night. For some reason, I could not follow those directions you gave me. I wound up in a totally scary part of town. I'm lucky I didn't get murdered. Ha ha. Lucky. Got you a present. (clears throat) Unrwear? Matching his and his. We have to talk. Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack. Baby duck. Oh. Listen... Before you say anything, There's, um, something I want to tell you. This is all new to me, marc-- the boyfriend thing. And I can't believe that I hit the jackpot on my first try. Look at you. You're an adonis. You're like a gay hugh jackman. I'm just... Really lucky. I'm sorry. You wanted to say something? Uh, it's just-- I'm going to... Go slip into these. (laughs) Bye. Don't judge. He worships me. We need to talk. Now wait. Before you say anything, I... Owe you an apology. I'm sure you had your reasons for making the decision you did. It's water under the bridge. Thank you, cal. I appreciate that. And now I want you to pack up your office And get the hell out of my building. What? I'm backing daniel and wilhelmina. I want you to take their buyout offer. Claire, now you know I'll do almost anything for you, But when it comes to running my business, I don't like being told what to do... By anyone. In that case, I'll be contacting tyler-- That's our son's name. Tyler. And I'll be providing him proof Of who his biological father is, Along with a breakdown of your corporate holdings And your net worth. Oh, and maybe the name of a paternity lawyer thrown in, Just for good measure. And now, I want you out of this company And... Out of my life. What's that? My diary. This entry is From the day that you killed every single one of my pitches. I called you a cretin, which I think shows a lot of emotion, Because I don't think That's a word people actually use anymore. What are you doing? Two weeks ago when you took me to dinner at cft, I was so happy, I wrote you a sonnet. Why are you showing me this? Cause... I may not put my emotions Up on a 10x10 foot canvas, But that doesn't mean they're not there. These pages are full of all kinds of passion. You had a thing for the hansons? Betty, I was a jerk yesterday. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. I shouldn't have shown your paintings. Bey, you were right. Look, you made me realize That I need to find a better balance in my life. I love you, and I want us to work, So I need to find something to pour myself into To take the pressure off us, and I don't think it's "mode." What do you mean? I'm quitting. Wow. You sure about that? Absolutely. It's not my passion. You know, I need some time alone So I that can find something that inspires me As much as you do. Well, I'm happy for you. Mm. But alone? Does that mean we can't hang out tonight? Yeah, sorry. I've got some big plans. Dinner for one, maybe a movie by myself, Some drinking alone. Sounds nice. Sounds awful. Do you want to come over? Yeah. I'll see you tonight. Mm. (elevator bell dings) down the hallway to the left. Not wasting any time I see. There are trends to be set. Kudos on out-maneuvering hartley. You must have found one mighty big stick To beat that horse with. I know you had something to do with this. Claire, whatever are you talking about?
