eccentric gazillionaire-- And my future sugar daddy-- mwah!-- Saved the company from famine With a generous infusion of cash. Yes, the seemingly preposterous rumors are true-- People are actually eating at "mode." Yikes. (mouth full) what? i like doughnuts. Mmm... chocolate. (hilda) ugh. please don't be one of those "kiss with food in the mouth" couples. that's just gross. It's such a relief that things are finally better at meade. (betty) also, today is our annual performance review. And i think i'm gonna ask for a promotion... To editor. (gasps) all right! Bravo, mija. bravo! plus, you still have your y.e.t.i. final project, So you'll get some job interviews from that, too. so will you. I know, but we were talking about you. wait. you're not leaving "mode," are you? Because that's the only reason why popular girls invite me To get manicures with them. i'm not leaving. It's just good to have options. I mean, she's like manny ramirez last winter. Yeah, i don't know what that means. A free agent? you know, she can leverage offers Against each other, try to get the best-- Yeah, i should really know my audience. welcome to my world. Thanks, ignacio. (chuckles) Oops. Good morning, boss. I'm here for my performance review. Good morning. Right on time, employee, Which leads nicely into... punctuality--excellent. Attitude--excellent. It kills me to say this, but across the board, You... are adequate. (sighs) oh, willie! You have never said that to me before. I want to hug you. dial it back, sister, Or i'll drop you right back down to "subpar." of course. Excellent. initiative-- oh, speaking of, i booked you ten tans To get ready for the summer. We don't want the "post" calling you pasty again. oh. when did they call me pasty? Oh, last june. But you didn't see it because i threw it away. Oh! another example of initiative. I was hoping, in light of my recent adequacy, That we might talk about my... future here. Well, uh, actually, There is something you need to know. A hiring freeze? what does that mean? It was part of the deal we made with hartley. We got to hire back everyone we let go, But until someone leaves... (clears throat) there are no new positions. And everyone just got hired back, So why would they want to leave? I'm so sorry, betty. Look, the thought of losing you absolutely kills me, But i know you have bigger aspirations than... (scoffs) booking my tans. But if an opportunity arises at y.e.t.i., No one will sing your praises louder than i will. (sighs) Thanks so much for helping me with my hair. I'm meeting your father later, and i want to look good. Why? so he can feel worse when you break his heart? I found this. What are you doing going through my mail? What are you doing looking for "nurse educator" positions In chula vista-- A country i've never even heard of?! Chula vista's in california. And i wasn't looking for anything. I just took an informational meeting When i was visiting family. (paper rustles) I never thought anythi would come of it. So you're just gonna, what, you're just gonna leave? no. Ay! come on, i don't know. It's a really good job. It'd be a new challenge, a raise. Ignacio's a really great guy. Well, you gotta tell him what's going on. He deserves to know. You're right. Plus, i have a really big mouth. So if you don't tell him, He might just find out, anyway. (sighs) (wilhelmina) okay, let's run through the bridal issue One last time. If anyone has any notes, i don't care. Oh, cal, what are you doing back? I thought you were in siberia. oh, they had a damn earthquake. As soon as they clear the bodies, i'll be back. Well, if you need any work space, Marc will set you up. actually, i'd rather see what you're doing here. No pressure. Hmm. just looking for something to make me smile. I'm not smiling. Now i'm not saying That you have to change your whole concept, But the wedding dresses aren't popping. Now what if we put... (both mouth words) The cherry 7up antioxidant ad... Between these photos? There. very nice. breathe. i have pictures of all of this. we will rebuild. "cherry pick your antioxidants." See? now that's clever. (chuckles) Excuse me, where do you think you're going? (french accent) uh, i would like a cherry 7up antioxidant. Well, in america, we just say "7up." But it contains vitamin e, a powerful antioxidant. Oh, for god sake, will you talk like a normal person? sit down. Yeah, see, my eye still isn't being drawn to the clothes. I don't know. maybe we have to reshoot. (chuckles) if i may... what? Uh, marc? yes. It--it's not that simple. We've been working on this concept for months. This is a little black wedding dress. My dear friend, reem acra, designed some things personally, As a huge favor. I think it is our best wedding issue as of yet. All right, you don't have to take my ideas. Of course, you did takey money. (claire) are you going to be much longer? I booked this conference room for a "hot flash" meeting. yes, yes, yes, your irritable bowel issue. Yeah, claire, come here. we need another opinion. Now tell me, what do you think of this concept? I like the idea of doing something Other than a white wedding, But black in fashion is just as cliché. In--in europe, they're showing color in their bridal gowns. Maybe we could try that. see, that makes me smile. You know, maybe you can help wilhelmina work up some... New version of this spread, huh? what? I'll clear my calendar. (gasps) Oh, there's something i want to show you on the light board. I think you'll get a kick out of it. okay. Daniel, hey, since i don't have a direct supervisor, I wrote my own performance review. I am "super excellent" in every category. Would you just sign here? oh! Oh, my god. i can't believe this. (romantic instrumental music playing) yes! Oh, i love you. (kisses) i love you so much. Wow... it's just paula abdul yelling at a mailbox. I was hoping for maybe a little chuckle or something. (music warbles and fades) Oh, no, molly. you thought i was... (sighs) i'm sor--i'm sorry. no. It's for the wedding issue, obviously. Oh, no. she definitely thought you were proposing. Yikes. that is really embarrassing. (jodie) and tom, carson and rita Are team three. (laughs) Three! also the number of martinis i had last night After my boyfriend dumped me, but i digress. And team four is marc, betty... And chair. Oh. "chair" is matt. He's not here. he's coming. But he's very invested in all of this. Uh-huh. they say they're invested, And then they go back to their wife. Ugh. can i get a new team? If you like, i could be your partner. Give you a taste of someone with experience. Uh, i'm good with betty and "chair." (chuckles) (door opens and closes) Hey, sorry. She's assigning final projects. where were you? There was this amazing exhibit at the whitney. I just lost track of time. In this bag is the key to your future. Your final assignment is to do a photo shoot And feature article For whatever type of magazine you draw. "music." Hey, you didn't screw it up. cool! Draw again. (paper rustles) "physical sciences." ugh. Which one's our topic? Both. you didn't think i'd make this easy, did you? I like to spice things up. Now... i have some bad news. Due to the number of hiring freezes In the industry this year, Y.e.t.i. will only be able to set up job interviews For three people. That means... only the winning team Will be getting interviews. (people groan) What? that was our only chance of moving up. I'm sorry. This is just the reality you have to deal with. And sometimes reality sucks. Okay. . All right, well, then we're just gonna have to make The best music/physical science magazine ever. Group hug? Oh. ooh! aah! Sync by honeybunny Thx to YYeTs.net for the transcripts. Alright, the physical science and music. Piece of cake. Easy-squeezy. okay, but let's start with the visuals. Because words-- who cares? Well, uh, hmm, astronomy is a physical science. And there's a jazz club not too far from here. We could shoot the musicians playing, uh, telescopes Instead of instruments. okay, yeah, that's something. (snores) that's nothing. We have to do something amazing, like, eye-popping. Oh! u2 on a space shuttle. that definitely doesn't sound easy-squeezy. (gasps) oh, my god, you guys have to come check out This youtube video. some lady called 9-1-1 Because they ran out of chicken nuggets. ooh, i heard about that. Oh, what if we did something at the planetarium? Ooh, and maybe use their laser light show? But how about, Instead of pink floyd, we use somebody current And then we style them '70s glam rock? and--and the article could be about How we search to be connected in this vast universe And music unites us. i have no idea what that means, but it sounded great. You write it. great. and i'll also start working on the logistics. You know, booking a photographer, Getting a caterer, that sort of stuff. and i'll get the band. it's only five degrees Of gay separation from anyone good. (amanda and matt laughing) I'm worried that mr. "short attention span" Over there isn't focused. Oh, don't worry. he heard everything. Is there something you'd like to oversee? sure, sure, i know somebody at the planetarium. I can give her a call. see? all righty, let's talk specifics. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're about to watch a gopher make a dramatic face. (gasps) (dramatic music plays) Great. talk soon. (telephone rings) (betty) i got james boyd to do our shoot. And also, my dad's gonna do our catering. and i can get us The new york hall of science, but only if i act fast. So i'm just gonna go aad and book it, okay? bye. no, wait, marc! But matt has a contact at the planetarium. i know, but-- (telephone rings) oh, hold on. i have another call. Hey. uh, i'm on the phone with betty. Oh, good, so we can play that game where we forget about her And see how long she stays on? (click) Okay, you may not be able to see this Because you've got your love-blinders on, But i don't think we can count on matt. what? Well, one, he's been showing up late to y.e.t.i., and two, He spent last night watching a man build a nest on youtube. We only have four days to put this together, And we can't afford to have anything bringing us down. Marc, that's ridic-- (telephone rings) Oh, hold on. daniel meade's office. hey. (click) look, i know he was acting A little weird last night, but he is just as committed To this as we are. okay, but the "fine dining and autos" group Already had to kick out one of their slackers. what is that supposed to mean? I'm saying it's a dog eat dog world and matt's looking a lot like lunch. I don't know. i-i can't decide on a ring. Molly's not one for something showy, But i cat exactly get her something cheap, right? I don't know. am i crazy for even talking about this? As a mother, i think so, yes. Seeing a son getting ready to marry a dying woman-- I just hate to see you in that much pain. Come on, it's gonna be painful whether we get married or not. If i can make one of molly's biggest dreams come true, I-i can't think of anything better than that. You're absolutely right. Whatever ups and downs your father and i had, And we had an awful lot of both... (chuckles) I always loved him. When the time is right, you give that to molly. (speaking indistinctly) I think the time is right. (betty) daniel... What? why did he just give me the--i hate the-- You, too? (door opens) (speaking indistinctly) Oh, my god, is he... (sighs) Oh. (laughs) (people cheering and applauding) Oh, it's so romantic, right? Now when molly is all losing her hair, Daniel has no choice but to stay by her side. Hilda. What? i wish i had somebody who would love me If i was all bald. hmm. Well, i need to do my e-mail when you're done. y. Hi... hi, papi. Aw, the sympathy "hi." I take it you all know about elena. Has she made up her mind about the job yet? No. I really don't want her to go. Papi, you just have to let her know That she has something worth staying for. yeah. What do you mean? If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it. Beyoncé knows. he is right. you have got to step up your game. (ignacio) i want to step up my game. I ju thought you guys wod have a problem with that. You ren't exactly on board with her in the beginning. Well, we are now. yeah. So... what are we saying? That we want a future with elena? Uh... yeah. Duh. hello. Gracias. Oh, my god. we're getting engaged! (squeals) yay! (ignacio) whoo! (hilda laughs) Oh, my god, you're not gonna believe it! 2-time grammy-award-winning english songbird adele Agreed to do our shoot! oh, my god! that's amazing! You got adele? i love her! I was able to secure it in five degrees. The cute guy from my cardio strip class Was a mall elf with david sedaris, Who lives in the same building as kevin bacon--not gay, But you always need him-- who was playing tennis With rachel maddow-- i hate to admit it, But the lesbians count-- la maddow is a huge adele fan. Voilá, winning y.e.t.i. project! doo doo doo doo doo! yay! Okay, i told adele's people that we were shooting At the planetarium, so don't let me down. actually, uh, it--itell through. What? what? When i called this afternoon, They said they'd booked it for something else. you! (grunts) Marc! you waited until this afternoon? You should've left a message last night, Followed up this morning, sent flowers and then waited Outside their office until they either gave you the planetarium Or had you arrested for stalking! look, i'm-- i'm really sorry. Sidebar! Look, we'll figure something out. it is too late. lives are at stake. We are voting him off the island. He is the weakest link! shh! Auf wiedersehen! that's it! good-bye! he's fired. Um, i-i can hear you, you know. that was the point! This was just for dramatic effect. Do, uh, do you want to fire me, too? No. But, matt, this is really important to us, And i know how capable you are. But for whatever reason, It just seems like you don't care. You're right. You're, uh, absolutely right. I'm gonna, uh... get out of your way. Bye! wait, no, matt! No! Matt, don't go! What's going on? (sighs) i didn't know how to tell you. I've been wanting to tell you for a while now. It's been killing me. but i just feel like... I'm losing my passion for publishing. what? I think i should leave y.e.t.i. Wait, hold on, what happened? You're really good at this, and i thout you loved it. I did, i did. I've just been feeling... drawn to something else. Oh. Uh, well, like what? Art. art? Specifically, i-i want to paint. oil paint. Oh, well, that's sort of out of left field. Actually, i've always been terested in painting. And i just can't stop feeling That maybe i got on the wrong path. There are some night classes i want to take. They start next week. are you freaked out? You seem freaked out. no, no. no, i'm not. i'm fine. it just-- It's just a lot to process, but, you know, If you're passionate about art, then... great. I support you 100%. (chuckles softly) Wow. That is so nice to hear. My family doesn't t-tend to see things the same way. So... we're okay? Yes, of course we're okay. (betty) it's just a little bit confusing. (daniel) publishing can't be the only thing You like about him. no, of course not. i mean, he's sweet and-- And goofy, and his bad jokes make me laugh. And things are just better when he's there. Yeah, well, none of that's changed. Even though he doesn't do the same thing as you, He's still the guy you fell in love with, right? wow, you've gotten all wise since you've been engaged. (laughs) yeah. kinda weird, right? The new york hall of science is now saying no, And judging by the restraining order They sent me this morning, they mean it. well, what are we gonna do? (sighs) we can't just paint stars in your apartment And call it the planetarium. I mean, this is adele, not amy winehouse. (cell phone rings) Wow, betty, that was really funny. thank you. betty suarez. We're never gonna be editors. yeah, of course i can be there today. I'm gonna go kill myself now. thank you. we got the planetaum! Oh, my god, that is great! i just have to go down and sign the contract. Okayi'll-- i'll go with you (wilhelmina) are you out of your mind?! Maybe not. go. go, go. (wilhelmina) oh, her bust looks nonexistent. For god sake, claire, Put your bifocals on. she looks hideous. how insensitive of me. The love of your life stole all your money And fled the continent just to get away from you. So no wonder you don't like a happy wedding dress. she looks like a baboon's ass. She didn't mean that. oh, stop talking to the props, amateur. Would anyone like a nice, warm scone? you might not remember your wedding Because it was 5,000 years ago, But when i married your husband, it was all about class. And this dress has none of it. well, no wonder You prefer to put brides in black dresses, Since you killed your groom at the altar. (whispering) we're gonna get you out of here. Just wait for my cue. (sighs) take off the dress. Don't touch that dress. Don't touch my model. you let go of my model. All right! all right! now! move! move! move! Serpentine, serpentine! you let go! Just get over here! (grunts) (whimpers) Such a shame. Yeah, my goal is to give you the perfect wedding, And, groom, little hint-- "perfect" means whatever she wants. yeah. Understood. what kind of venue did you have in mind? Hotel bora bora, on the beach under the stars. "stars." Outside? what if it rains? groom. Ouide's perfect. Right. and i want it to be like a party. Tacos and margaritas instead of lobster and champagne. And a band with everyone dancing. Is this too much? no. i want you to have whatever you want. Well, it all looks very doable. So what date did you have in mind? We were kind of thinking as soon as possible. Like--like the end of the month. This month? mm-hmm. Mr. meade, a-a wedding like this Would normally take at least eight or nine months. But it is what she wants. Let's just make it happen. Okay. a-absolutely. Hello? Hello? Hello? (richard strauss' "also sprach zarathustra" playing) Hello, betty. Mrs. hartley. What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. So when i heard you needed this space For your y.e.t.i. project, i called my friend bitsy, Who's on the board of the planetarium, Reminded her of a few things i saw At last year's christmas party... (chuckles) and it's yours. wow, um... Why are you doing this for me? I mean, we didn't exactly get off to a great start. Excellent observation. Now don't choke on your adult braces. I'm dimming the lights. We put this together last year... For an intervention the family did for matt. An intervention? (projector clicks) Here's matt at mile 25 of the new york city marathon. Wow. i didn't even know he ran a marathon. He didn't. a marathon is 26.2 miles. Mile 25 is when matt developed a new passion... (click) for karate. Here's matt getting his brown belt. (click) And here he is on his way to develop his new passion... Pottery. (click) and here-- Oh, that's your mushroom cap on my painting. How did that get in there? (click) Ah. here is matt with a cow. i don't get it. He was studying to be a large-animal vet. His dream was to heal an elephant. his dream died. So did tiny. (click) Why are you showing me these? Well, it does seem odd, given th i don't care for you, But in this case, your plucky immigrant zeal Could be a good thing. I want matt back in y.e.t.i. Well, he's pretty passionate about art now. He always starts that way. I don't want matt to be one of those incredibly rich men Who never accomplish anything. I think if he finishes this program, He'll stick with publishing. Of course, i can't tell him that. It has to come from you. Uh, mrs. hartley, I-i really don't feel comfortable doing that. I understand. Well, enjoy the planetarium. I know how important this project is for you And your career. It'd be such a shame if anything went wrong. (marc) wake up and smell the quid pro quo. Of course she's gonna take it away If we don't get matt back in. well, i don't know what to do. On one hand, it seems like i'm using matt To finish the project. not seeing the problem. And then on the other hand, I really do want to help matt finish something. We all do. we want to help him commit. But then on the other hand, I'm only hearing his mother's side of the story. Maybe matt has a whole different story. and now you got three hands, Which in a weird way, balances out your two heads. marc, help me. Okay, look. i don't care about your relationship. What i care about is my future, And if we don't have matt in the group, Then we don't get the planetarium, And then our entire final project is dead. Look, we're out of options at "mode." Just make it work. (elena) it's so nice of you to make me lunch. What's the occasion? since when do i need an occasion to make my girlfriend a meal? Oh! oh, i'm so sorry. it's okay. Oh! smooth, 'nacio. Let me get that. no, it's o-- i'll get it. Are you okay? (sighs) no. I know you're considering that job, but... I love you, elena. And i think we have a future together. At least, i hope we do. (sighs) Will you marry me? Oh, my god. You're leaving me hanging here. If--if it's about the ring, i promise, it's coming. Shut up and kiss me. Is that a "yes"? Yes. (laughs) Yes. Yes, yes. (both laugh) Art books. Wow. Matt, i've been thinking-- And don't hate me for saying this-- But do you think maybe it would be worth it to finish y.e.t.i. Before moving on to the next thing? oh, boy. I mean, there's only one week left, And i really miss having you there. And besides, your art class Doesn't even start till next week, So i just don't see a downside. wow, you sound like my mother. Oh, no, no, i'm--i'm sorry. no, it's okay, it's okay. somehow, coming from you, It doesn't make me want to break things. And maybe i was a little... selfish, Leaving you guys in the lurch like that. So... you'll come back? Well, when you do that cute squinty thing with your eyes, How could i say no? yay! And don't worry. you're nothing like my mother. A little, uh, a little less bouffant. We're going more, um, '70s and '60s, And, you know, some of the aliens are sweating. Can you, uh, take a look before we shoot? uh-huh. Hi. you ready to go? you're really good at this. i'm glad you're back. Me, too. oh, uh, you know, we need to test those lights. I don't want them to interfere. i think they're strobing. Betty, this is dave sheehan, adele's manager. (gasps) oh, my god. hi. I am such a huge fan of adele. We are so happy that she's doing our shoot. Yeah. no. me, too. real happy. whoo. So what is this--some kind of, uh, school project? It's y.e.t.i., the young editors-- whatever. you know, i could kill her for doing this. Okay. Maybe you're getting some lens glare. We're gonna be taking shots from this side of the-- hi. Mom, um, what-- what are you doing here? Well, i just had lunch with bitsy. As usual, hers was liquid. (chuckles) But she said you were here, finishing your y.e.t.i. project. I was sure it was drunken ramblings, but... Here you are. I'm proud of you. I'm just glad that you're-- That you're seeing something through. Now i'm gonna go before i ruin our little mother-son moment. (indistinct conversations) (speaking inaudibly) (whispers) thank you. (indistinct conversations) Betty... Did my mother put you up to this? Wow. (chuckles) hey, you ready for lunch? Hey, perfect timing. Brent was just walking me through the wedding gift guide. Maybe he can give us a few ideas. you guys are getting married? Mm-hmm. that is so great... that you're allowed to do that. You should totally register for this copper-lined cookware. You two will be cooking with these for the next 50 years. That's a long time. oh, please. the first year of marriage flies by... Or so i hear. Anyway, then you'll be having babies. So look at this. Jeanette valois is the "it" artist for nurseries. If you're even thinking about having kids, You should book her right now. This is a mistake. i can't get married. molly. I'm just gonna go grab lunch. Hey... oh, my god. i can't believe i let myself Get caught up in all this. stop. hey. We can do this. Look... You've been able to give me a lot of things, But you can't give me more time. (telephone rings) (sighs) (ring) Hello. No. elena doesn't work here anymore. But i can give her a message. Hang on. (opens drawer and pulls out objects) Okay. Well... I'll be sure to ask her. (hangs up receiver) I can't work like this. I run the top fashion magazine in the world, And claire meade does a dinky insert For menopausal old ladies. My dinky little insert improves "mode's" circulation Every time it runs, and-- shh! Cal, you kept me because i'm the best In the business, and as the best, There are three c's that i avoid... (sighs) Collaborion, compromise and claire. And trust me, i chose the nice "c" there. And what do you have to say? She's absolutely right. And while i think i actually did fix Her bizarr little black wedding dress concept, The spread is never going to get done With both of us working on it, so for the sake of "mode," I'd like to take myself off this project. What game are you playing? No game. Life's too short. So i guess you're offhe project. Well, thank you. Claire, i'd like to have a word with you. I just--i-i-i can't believe that you went behind my back And met with my mother. matt, it wasn't li that. Because it seems to me like you got me to rejoin y.e.t.i. Just so you could have this stupid planetarium. no, matt, i thought that i was helping you. Oh, wait, let me guess, let me guess. She show you the slide show? well, yes. Look, tiny didn't die, okay? My mother was manipulating you. that's what she does. How could you believe her? matt, i'm sorry, But some of what she said actually made sense. You are passionate about a lot of different things. Uh-huh, and maybe i'm that way because i like a challenge. Did that even occur to you? look, i'm not just gonna keep quiet If i think you're making a mistake. god. betty, do you even hear yourself? Not everybody has their life planned out The way that you do. that's not the point! You start things that you d't finish. oh, what, like a y.e.t.i. project? Don't say it like that. you know that this is important to me. And it was important to you until it wasn't. Yeahwell, so i changed my mind. so what? so what? So how's that supposed to make me feel about us? Are you just gonna change your mind someday? Hey! we lost adele. What? her manager heard you two fighting And called this amateur hour. i agreed with him And then offered to give adele a foot massage, Which didn't work, either, so she's gone. well, who are you calling? Jodie. she's my only hope. Hey, jodie... (deepens voice) this is, uh, marc st. james. I was wondering if you wanted to grab a beer And watch straight porn. So you're just gonna leave? yeah, well, i might as well Live up to my reputation for not finishing things. (indistinct conversations) (sighs) Hey, i thought i'd come by to support you, but... It looks like i'm too late. what happened? We lost adele, marc stormed off, And i got into a fight with matt, So there goes my y.e.i. project, My professional future And my rationship. Wow. it actually sounds like you might've had A worse day than i did. Molly canceled our wedding. What? It was too much to get done and not enough time. Oh, betty. I mean, the wedding planner quit. The hotel was booked until the winter. I just--i wanted it to be perfect for her, but... God, if it was up to me, I would just forget about all this stuff And marry her right now. really? Well, why don't you? right here. (laughs) yeah. No, i'm serious. Daniel, we have this ven all night. There's a photographer, wedding gowns at "mode." And tacos are coming. You said molly wanted tacos... and stars. I mean, maybe it's not perfect, but... Maybe "perfect" just looks a little different Than you imagined. what about your y.e.t.i. project? Uh, i don't have a y.e.t.i. project. And this is way more important. I don't know. really? Yes. go. get molly. I can take care of everything else. okay, all right. (woman) do you, molly, take daniel To be your lawfully wedded husband, For richer, for poorer, In sickness and in health, For as long as you both shall live? I do. And do you, daniel, take molly... I don't mean to cast doubt on this lovely ceremony, But is this legally binding? oh, yeah, she was an ordained minister Before she decided to become an actress/model. How perfect is that? (woman) for richer, for poorer... a mother's dream. In sickness and in health, For as long as you both shall live? I do.
