I'm Soy, Betty. You Should Go. Henry, I'm Sorry. I Just Can't See You. Not With The Way Everything Turned Out. The Baby's Yours. You're Going Back To Tucson To Be With Charlie. I Am Not Going Back To Be With Charlie. I Am Going Back To Be A Father To My Child. Maybe We Can Still Do This. Long Distance? It-- That'll Never Work. I Just Think It's Better If We Just Avoid Each Other Until You Leave. So That's It. Just Like That? Yes, I Think That's What's Best. Excuse Me, Do You Mind Not Leaning On Me? Who's Leaning On You? Well, You See, That's None Of Your Concern. People Can Lean On Me All They Want. Okay. No, Not You. Okay, So I'm Here For Five More Months. How Do We Make This Work? When You Need Daniel's Signature, Send Kenny. Okay. What About Meals? I Go To The Cafeteria At 1:00. I Guess I Can Do 12:00. Except For Taco Tuesdays. I'm Always Afraid They're Gonna Run Out, So I Have To Go Early. Okay, Sure. Well, Maybe This Whole Avoidance Thing Will Work. Yeah, We Never Have To See Each Other At All.

(Wilhelmina) Thank You For Joining Us, Daniel. Why Are You In Here? Where Are All The Other Departments? Oh, I Only Invited Ad Sales And Accounting. I Figured It'd Be Easier To Discuss The Advertising Situation In A Smaller, Le Judgmental Group. (Whispering) Excuse Me, Over There To That Chair? Well, That's Very Thoughtful Of You, Wilhelmina, But I Really Don't Have Anything To Hide. I've Been Very Open About This Whole Thing. And If You Could Just Move To That Chair. It's Empty. I Think We All Know Atlantic Attire Pulled Their Advertising From "Mode." (Normal Voice) No, No, No. I Didn't Mean You. I Meant Him. Betty? Please. Oh, You--You Didn't Know? Uh, Once The News Leaked That Atlantic Attire Was Pulling Out, Well, Other Companies Followed. Just How Many Advertisers Are We Talking About? Well, As Of This Morning, Um... 52%. (Low Voice) Your Foot Just Touched My Knee. (Low Voice) Your Knee Just Touched My Foot. Well, Here's The Line. So What's Our Financial Outlook?

Not Bad, Not Bad. Turn. Thank You. You Need To Date. Da? No, I Am Not Ready To Get Involved Again. Who Said Anything About Getting Involved? All You Wanna Do Is Have A Little Bit Of Fun.

Your Opinion Really Matters To Me. Ll, The New One Doesn't Really Say "Classy Fashion Magazine." It's More "Where's Lindsay's Mug Shot?" Oh, And There It Is. Daniel, Wouldn't You Rather Just Keep "Mode" The Way It Is And Go To Your Father And Ask Him For Money? Yeah, But You've Met My Family. My Mother Was Arrested For Murder, And She's The Nice One. Yeah, But Do You Really Want "Mode" Going Out Like <I>This?</I> Oh, Free Laundry Detergent. Yeah, Knock Yourself Out. Thanks. Why Are You Wearing Your Lucky Sweater? It's Not Taco Tuesday.

(Siren Whoops) Who Died? I Get Her Clothes. I'll Get It. Justin. Hey,Hilda. Listen,Justin Took Your Car For A Little Joyride With His Friends. What? I'm Goin' Upstairs. Hey. He Crashed It Into A Tree. No One Was Hurt Except The Car And The Tree. Listen,This One's Between Us. I Know You Been Goin' Through A Lot Lately, But Keep An Eye On Him. I Seen These Things Spiral. Yeah,Yeah. Thanks,Rita. Mm-Hmm. Thanks. All Right,Ladies. Looks Like We're Gonna Have To Wrap Things Up. You Don't Have To Go Home, But You Can't Quilt Here. Will We See You Tomorrow?

Soup's Not Soup Unless It's Hot. Wait,Dad,There's Something I Have To Tell You. It's About The Magazine. No,Alexis. I Can't Let You Do That. Hot Or Cold, Soup Is Soup. I Lost Atlantic Attire, Which Led To A Substantial Advertiser Pullout. How Substantial? 52%, But I Can Explain. Of All The Incompetent-- Hold On,Dad. It's Not His Fault. He Was Protecting Me. Don't Defend Him. Your Brother Has A Long History Of Making Mistakes Around Here And Expecting Everybody Else To Clean Up After Him. You're The Only One I Can Count On To Do Anything Right. And Me,Of Course. Look,I Can Fix This. Just Give Me The Chance. (Bradford,Voice Distorted) I Always Knew Something Like This Wagonna Happen. You've Had Every Opportunity Handed To You. How The Hell Could You Turn Into Such A Screwup? You Are Dead To Me,Alex. Excuse Me. Oh,Boy,It Really Is Date Night. Who Cares? Two Friends Can Have Dinner,Right? No Big Deal. Yeah. What Are You Doing? Oh,Oh, This Is For Me. Sucks To Be You. No,Seriously, Do You Want To Sit Here? No,I'm Fine. Thank You. Thank You. Oh,Look, It's My Date's Bird. Guess He Didn't Make It. I'm Sorry. I'm A Terrible Liar. ???? And You're On A Bowling Team Called The Debitz? No,The Debitz Are Real. It Just Wasn't League Night. Oh. I-I Heard You Were On A Date, And It Made Me Kind Of Crazy. Are You Serious? You Got Jealous? Oh,No,No,No. We Are Not... We're Friends. He Got Another Girl Pregnant. Betty. What? I Can Deal With It. I'm Sure Hcan. Rose For Your Pretty Lady? Oh,No,She's Not My Pretty Lady. I Mean,She's Pretty, Uh,But... He Got Another Girl Pregnant. Oh. Oh. You Know What? Suddenly I'm Not So Hungry. Wait,Betty,Wait. No,We Can Do This. You Mean So Much To Me. Oh,My God, He's Proposing! What? What? No,No. (Man) Champagne For The Happy Couple. No,No. No,No,I'm Not. Wait. I Would,But... I Can't Do This. No,Uh... You Okay? Where Are Ey? Down In The Kitchen. She's Licking Fondue Cheese Off His Fingers. What's Wrong? I Remember Everything. Dad's Been Lying To Me This Whole Time, Acting Like Some Loving Father. He Hates Me. No,He Doesn't. He Just Wanted To Use The Accident As A Way To Start Over With You. I Remember The Accident,Too. It Wasn't Your Fault. What? We Took Dad's Car, And I Had... I'd--I'd Paid Someone To,Um... To Cut The Brakes. What? No,You Didn't. Yes,I Did. He Was Trying To Get Rid Of Me, And So I Was Trying To... What? Kill Him? Oh,God. Alexis,What The Hell Is Wrong With You? I Was Torturing Myself. I Thought <I>I</I> Put You In A Coma. All This Time You Wanted To Murder Our Father? Daniel,I'm Sorry. Please Don't Tell Him. Wouldn't Believe Me Anyway. So You Had A Big Day,Huh? Stealing A Car, Crashing A Car. I Think We Should Talk About It. Are You Serious? Yeah,I Know You Think I Haven't Been Paying Attention To What's Been Going On Lately, And Maybe I Haven't, But That's Gonna Change. Oh,So Now You're Gonna Turn Back Into A Mother? What's That Supposed To Mean? It's Not Exactly A Part-Time Job When You Feel Like It. Oh,No, Get The Hell Back Here. I <I>Am</I> Your Mother. Don't You Forget It. Let Go Of Me. No,Justin,Listen. A Kid Losing His Father-- That Is Not Supposed To Happen. And I Would Do Anything-- Anything In The World If I Could Bring Him Back. But... It's Just You And Me. We're All We've Got. And I'm Getting Scared, Justin, Because I Feel Like We're-- We're Moving Like This. So I Think It's Time We Pull It Together,Yeah? I Mean,I Been Acting Like An 80 Year Old, And You With The... With The Attitude And The Clothes-- That's Not You. I Just Wanted Him To Be Proud Of Me. Oh,Baby,He Was Proud Of You. He <I>Is.</I> Just Exactly, Exactly Like You Are. I Just Miss Him So Much. Oh,Me,Too. But It's Gonna Be Okay. Just Let It Out. We're Gonna Be Okay. Oh. If You Had Told Me When I Woke Up This Morning, That I Would End Up At Your Apartment, I Woulnot Have Believed You. Will You Stop Grinning? You Picked Me. I Didn't Pick You. I Just Wanted To See "Psycho." * You Picked Me Over An Underwear Model * What Is That? That--That Is A Dance You're Never Gonna See Again.
