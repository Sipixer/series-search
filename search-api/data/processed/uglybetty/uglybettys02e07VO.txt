I Can't Start My Own Magazine Until We Bring Down "Mode." Apparently The Dynamic Duo, Danny And The Tranny, Have Gone And Found Some Advertisers To Save This Rag. Please. "Mode" Is Far From Being Out Of The Woods, And Once You Take Over The Whole Company, This Magazine Will Go Down Faster Than A Crack Whore At A Prison Rodeo.

Don't Think I've Forgotten That You Knew About This The Whole Time And Were Covering For Her! Okay,I Think The Important Thing Here Is That We Focus On Betty. You Want Me To Focus On Betty? I'll Focus On Betty. You're Not Seeing Henry Again. Dad,I'm 23 Years Old. You Can't Tell Me Who I Can See. I Can If You're Living In This House! Then Maybe I Shouldn't Be Living In This House. Betty. Hey,There's The Door! Fine! Papi! Ay! Why Is Everyone In This Family So Freakin' Dramatic? (Man) And Today Mayor Bloomberg Gave Posh The Key To The City... Where Does He Get Off Calling Me A Silly Girl? Well,He Says Things. Justin,Go Watch Downstairs. Who Does He Think Has Been Holding This Family Together Ever Since Mom Died? He's Just Scared For You. He Thinks You're Doing Something That's A Little Bit Crazy. Well,You Know What,Hilda? My Entire Life, I've Been The Sensible One. I Never Even Thought That I Would Ever Get A Chance At Real Love. This Might Be It For Me. Don't I Deserve To Do Something A Little Crazy Just Once? (Man) After Posh Rang The Opening Bell, The Dow Soared To New Heights... Ay,Betty,Please. Do You Have To Do This Now? It's His Citizenship Ceremony On Saturday. Yeah,Thanks To Me. Betty,Wait. Justin-- You Know What? If There Was Ever An Argument For Me To Have My Own Tv, This Would Be It. (Lowered Voice) What Do You Mean,"Thanks To You"? (Lowered Voice) How Do You Think Dad Even Got His Visa? The Lawyers? No. The I.N.S.? No. It Was Me.

Well, It Was The Kick I Needed To Get Myself Some Help. But Part Of Me Getting Better Is Making Amends To Those I Hurt, So Here I Am. Yeah, I'm Sorry I Ran Out On You. I Guess It Was Just Easier To Secretly Put Money Aside For Two Years, Hide In A Neighbor's Barn, Then Wait At The Airport For Four Days For A Standby Ticket To New York Than It Was To Speak To My Husband.

So What Exactly Are We Talking About Here? $100,000 For An Experimental Treatment. That's The Reason I'm In New York. And How Are You Gonna Get That Money? I'm Not. Good News Is That In Six Months Time, You Will Be Inheriting My Mom's Spoon Collection. Oh, Stuart. I Have Always Wanted That Spoon Collection... Just Not Like This. Stay In New York. Why? I Don't Know How, But I'm--I'm Gonna Get You The Money, Okay? (Whispers) Yeah. And Then I See Her Bodyguard Leaving Her Room. What Else Could It Be, Right? Um, Yeah, I Mean, That Sounds Suspicious. Did You Hear Anyone Say Anything At All? Do You Know If-- No, No I Don't. I Don't Know Anythg. But, Daniel, If--If You Think That This Is True, Then You Should Go To Your Father And Tell Him Before He Marries That Woman. He Knows How I Feel About Wilhelmina. I Can't Go To Him Without Any Proof. I Just Wish There Was ??? Ah, Don't Worry About It, Betty. It's Not Your Problem. Although, I Think I Am Gonna Go To His Wedding.

No. No, No, No. No. No, This Is About You And Wilhelmina. I Just Need A Few Answers. I've Got A Blank Check For Some Information About... My Checkbook. Oh, Damn It. I Left It On The Dresser. I Could See It Right There. Well, Well, Well. I Thought I Heard A Meeting Of The Minds. Game Over, Wilhelmina. Dwayne Just Told Me Everything Aut You Two. Mm, Nice Try, Daniel. There's Nothing Going On Between Dwayne And I. But For Argument's Sake, Let's Say I Was Enjoying</I> The Pleasure Of This Tall Glass Of Chocolate Milk. I Would Think You'd Run Straight To Your Father, But Oh, Wait, You Can't, And Do You Know Why You Can't? He Has No Proof. Dwayne. I Was Building Up To That. But He's Right. You Have No Oof. I Will See You At The Altar. Can You Believe Him? Suddenly He's The Hottest Guy In The Room, And... (Scoffs) I'm Not Good Enough. Marc, I Got To Be Honest With You. I Do Like His New Suit. But Seriously, He's Only 15% Hotter. Oh, Really? Then Why Is Every Waiter Serving Him Food? Why Is Every Bartender Pouring Him Drinks? Oh, My God, It's Happened. You're Looking Past The Outside And Seeing What's On The Inside.</I> You're Falling For Him. You're Falling For An Average Man. Oh, God. I Am. I'm An Average-Man Lover. What Do I Do? You Accept It. You Are Deeper Than You Think. It's Okay. We All Have Flaws. But I-I Broke Up With Him. Then You Get Out There, And You Do Something Amatic To Show That Fatty How Much You Care. Like, You Run Through The Airport, And You Bust Through Security, And Just As The Doors Of The Plane Are Closing, You Scream At The Top Of Your Lungs, "Cliff!" You Calling Me? Or You Just Go Over There And Talk To Him. (Sighs) I'm Sorry I Said Those Things. And I'm Sorry That I Didn't Tell You About Me And Henry. It's Just... Dad, You're Right. I'm Doing Something Really Stupid. And You're Gonna Keep Doing It, Right? Yeah. And When He Leaves, I'm Gonna Fall Apart. And I Want You To Promise Me You'll Be Here To Pick Me Up. I'm Your Father. Where Else Am I Gonna Be? You're Still Crying? Yeah, First He Became A Citizen, And Now Betty... Just Watch Your Tv. So This Does Mean You're Coming Back Home, Right? Yes. Hilda Told Me What You Did To Make This Happen. Hilda Sucks At Secrets. Daniel's Done So Much For You, Betty. You Can't Betray A Friend For Me. Dad, If I Tell Daniel About Wilhelmina, She'll Try And Do Something To Mess Up Your Citizenship. I'm An American Now. Let Her Try. All Right, People. Let's Get This Over With. I Mean, Let's Get Me Married Off To The Most Wonderful Man In The Whole World. Actually, Ms. Slater, There's Just One Problem. Your Maid Of Honor... We Can't Find Her Anywhere. Oh, Posh Flaked? Oh, Darn. Well, I Guess We'll Have To Go Ahead Without Her. Poor Thing, I Hope She's All Right. All Right, People. Focus On The Joy. Flowers! Hello Anybody Out There? I Think The Door's Locked! This Really Is Major. Dear Friends, We Are Gathered Here Today To Join In Holy Matrimony Wilhelmina Slater And Bradford Meade. I Object! (Gsts Gasp) We Haven't Gotten To That Part Yet. Oh. Oh, I Knew It. I Knew Wilhelmina Was Sleeping With Her Bodyguard. When Did You Find Out? Daniel, It's Not Really Important. Just Go In There And Talk To Your Father And Stop The Wedding! No, No, No,??? I Mean, You're My Only Proof. So Did You Find Out On Your Own? Did Someone Tell You? I Saw Them. Wait, What? When? Um, Four Months Ago When I Went To Wilhelmina's Apartment To Get The Book. Four Months Ago And You Waited Till Now To Tell Me? No, Daniel, It's Not What It Sounds Like. It's Very Complicated-- No. It's Not Complicated. Betty, You Kw I've Been Trying To Find A Way To Open My Father's Eyes About This Woman. But She Was Using Me-- I Don't Want To Hear Your Excuses. Betty, You're The One Person I Always Counted On Being On My Side, And You Betrayed Me. For Wilhelmina? How Could I Ever Trust You Again? Daniel, Please-- Just Stop. I Can't Even Look At You. You're Fired. Do You, Bradford Emerson Meade, Take This Woman, Wilhelmina-- Sorry. Do You-- Do You Need Something? I Really Need To Speak With You. Yes, Just As Soon As He Takes Me As His Lawfully Wedded Wife. Let's Go, Bradford. Really, Dad. It's Important. Just Give Me A Moment. Well, I'll Just Go Ahead And Do My Part While You're Gone. I Do. Oh, No. I-I'm Sorry. It Really Doesn't Work That Way. (Whispers) Do Something. (Normal Voice) Um, Ladies And Gentlemen, While We Wait For The Ceremony To Resume, Perhaps A Song From Our Own Amanda Sommers, Daughter Of The Late, Great Fey Sommers. (Amanda Whispers) What? (Lowered Voice) Your 15 Minutes Are Almost Up. Quincy Jones Is In The Fourth Row. Now Sing, Bitch. Why ?? My... ??? And ? U ??? To Try To Poison This Relationship, Wouldn't You? I've Got To Admit, I Admire Your Tenacity. Look, I Am Not Making This Up. Betty Saw Them Together! Oh, Really? Then How Come Betty's Not Here Telling Me This? She... She's Gone. How Convenient. You're Unbelievable. I Am The Only One Willing To Be Honest With You. Will You At Least Consider The Possibility-- I Am Not Gonna Throw Away Something Based On Some Crazy Accusation Made By Some Assistant. Look At You. You're Sweating, Dad.
