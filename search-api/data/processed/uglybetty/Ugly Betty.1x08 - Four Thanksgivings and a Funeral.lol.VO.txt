Do we have that attorney-client privilege thing? That only works if I'm your lawyer, but for now you've got something stronger than that--my word. Marc booked your flight for paris. You leave tonight at 9:00. I want to see Justin in return. I want to see my son. You need to find whatever it is you're looking for, Daniel. I just know now that it's not me. I think it's time for Fey Sommers to come out of seclusion. Fey? Betty Suarez here. No, Betty Suarez here at home an hour ago. Daniel hasn't left yet. He's doing paperwork. Yeah, well, the lawyer's gonna be here any minute - to go over dad's immigration case. - I know, I know. I'll get home as soon as I can. And what about shopping for Thanksgiving dinner? Hilda, I will get it done. Look, I gotta go. Since I started here, she acts like all of a sudden I don't care about our family. I always do the shopping for Thanksgiving, and then every year my father and I cook the meal together. It's been our tradition since my mother passed away. I'm sorry, you were looking at me and saying things. I wasn't really listening. Never mind. So you've got big plans tomorrow with this new guy you've been seeing? Now what makes you say that? You keep walking past Daniel's office, saying really loudly that you've got big plans with this new guy you've been seeing. Not anymore. Jerk called about an hour ago. Says he has to spend Thanksgiving with his wife and kids. I'm, like, grow a pair. I am so over men. They all suck. Where's Marc? - Hi. - Hi. Hey, what are you still doing here? The high priestess needs her outfit altered for some dinner she's going to tomorrow. Oh, what time do I need to be at your place? Around 3:00. Now is that the time we're actually eating, or is that the time that that delightful little nephew of yours is putting on his production of "Thanksgiving, the musical"? We're eating at 6:00. I'll see you at 6:00, then. Um, the phone stopped ringing a while ago, and it looks like everybody's gone for the holiday. Do you think maybe I could... Oh. Yeah, sure. Okay. You--you haven't, um... seen... Sofia up here today, right? Okay, and there's no calls? Sorry. Oh, no, no, I don't care. I mean, she's got a boyfriend, right? Who she never happened to mention, I might add. I mean, if you're serious about a guy, you'd be talking about him all the time, right? You're always going on and on about that guy Wilbur. Walter. - Daniel, are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. I spent the day waiting by the phone, checking my e-mail every two minutes. It's like I'm this close to splitting a cobb salad with Sarah Jessica Parker and talking about shoes. I really miss that show. So whatcha doing tomorrow? I have to drag my well-toned ass up to Schenectady, eat cranberry sauce in the shape of a can and tell my family all about my girlfriend, who lives up in Canada. You  wanna blow 'em off and hang out? Tempting. What are you thinking? We meet here at 9:00. I bring the champagne, you bring the orange juice, and we watch the parade from Wilhelmina's window. And by "watch the parade," you mean try on couture gowns and xerox our naughty bits? Of course. I am so in. French cuff or no? - No. - I'd go with the cuff. You want to live my life, pay my bills. Ooh, sassy. Uh, Louis from Armani called-- not happy with his placement in the issue. Dr. Levy needs to move your teeth whitening to tuesday, and... oh, Nico said to tell you she's coming in town for Thanksgiving. What? She told me last week she was staying at school. I can't just change my plans at the last minute. I have the Versace party to go to. Ouch! It's a work obligation. I can't shirk my responsibilities just to sit home and have a very Brady Thanksgiving. She'll just have to understand. What are you staring at? Oh... you're gonna cuff that, right? Okay, so don't forget, your dad has a brunch at 2:00 p.m. in the executive dining room. - I'm gonna pass on that. - What? - Slimming. - Thanks, Marc. You have to go. It's your family. Oh, come on. It's not like it's some intimate gathering. My father invites all his editors so everyone can tell him what a genius he is. Oh, and this year, my mother will be fresh out of detox, stealing  the olives out of martini glasses and sucking 'em dry in the janitor's closet. No, thanks. Knock, knock. Oh, am I interrupting something? - Oh, hey. - No. - Betty was just leaving. - Yes, I was. - Bye, Betty. - Bye. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. - Hi. - Hi. So what's new? Met this girl, had some fun. Found out she has a boyfriend she didn't tell me about. Wow, she sounds like a bitch. I'm sorry, Daniel. I didn't know we were gonna do what we did, and things just got out of control. I was actually hoping that we could skip to the part where we move on and we try to be friends? I'd really like to be your friend. Me, too. Friends' hands don't go that low. I'll see you at your father's brunch tomorrow. Oh,  you're going? But you R.S.V.P.'d "no." I mean, not that I checked. Well, I was supposed to go skiing, but now I have to get back here by friday, so whatever. Sounds like fun. You're gonna be there, right? Oh, yeah, I'll be there. I mean, it's my family, right? Thanksgiving without family would be... thursday. Great, 'cause I'm bringing Hunter. And you know, in a weird way, I think you two will really get along. Great, yeah. Hunter. I can't wait to meet him. Hunter. Hun-ter. I can't stop saying his name. I love him already. See you there. Hey, nice turkey. You making one for everybody? So you really invited your ex for Thanksgiving. Look who took her grown up pill. Well, he is Justin's father. Although these days a freakin' Petri dish can be a father. Right? So when did you get divorced, anyway? Oh, no, you have to be married to get divorced. No, this is the classic boy meets girl, boy knocks girl up, boy loses girl's number. Throw in a glass slipper, and you got a hell of a fairy tale. Exactly. I'm home! I'm sorry! Did you go over your case with Leah yet? An hour ago, Betty. I'm sorry. I couldn't get off of work. And you missed my pageant at school. I know, Justin, but there was no one to cover my phones. Well, it was awesome. I was the only pilgrim that could do "jazz hands." "Jazz" what? "Jazz"... "hands." Oh. Well, I wanna hear all about this as soon as I get home from shopping. Oh, hi. You must be Leah. I'm Betty. I'm so sorry-- What did you do? You went to the market? That doesn't exactly sound like a "thank you." Hilda, I told you that I would do the shopping. Well, since she started this new job of hers, - she has no more time anymore. - Yeah, well, I have time. I'm still doing all the cooking with dad tomorrow. Oh, really? And what if they call tomorrow from the office with some fashion emergency? They've lowered the hemlines! Red alert! Wait, you didn't even get the stuff to make the bu√±uelos. Why do you insist on making those every year? No one ever eats them. Last year we had to use them to crack open walnuts. Because mom made them every year, Hilda. It's a tradition. And that was the best turkey they had? No, that is the last turkey they had. You were this close to stuffing a brisket. Oh, I have so much to do. Well, I haven't even started to cook, and I've still gotta go to the airport. All the kids are coming home tomorrow. Tell me about it. We're having our three boys and their girlfriends. I have no idea where we're gonna put these people. Well, we see 'em three times a year. It's worth it. Will you stop looking at me like the ghost of Thanksgiving yet to come? Good night. I see an old woman, all alone... at a Thanksgiving table set for one. Ciao, tesoro, it's Wilhelmina. Yes. Listen, something came up, and I won't be able to make it tomorrow. Nico's coming home. Yes. # Toot, toot, hey, beep, beep # # Toot, toot, hey, beep, beep # # Bad girls # So,  looks like I'm not the only one doing a little last minute Thanksgiving shopping. A carton of cigarettes and a bottle of vodka? You have your traditions. I have mine. So... having some big blowout today? No, Gina, just the family. I thought you would've gone all out this year. I mean, you never know who won't be around next Thanksgiving. What is that supposed to mean? Come on. It's a small neighborhood. People talk. Everyone knows about your pop's immigration problem. You know what? You have no idea what you're talking about. Hey, you wanna keep it quiet, fine. But in the spirit of the holiday, I think I should tell you-- watch out for that lawyer I saw leaving your place last night. Oh, really? And why is that? Leah Stillman is bad news. I know someone who knows someone who knows Donna Spadaro in Astoria. Leah promised to get her custody of her kids, and all she did was steal her money and take off. Yeah, well, Hilda found Leah, and I trust her. Leah's not gonna rip us off. Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Oh, and tell your father I wish him a very happy Thanksgiving. # You bad girl, you sad girl # # You such a dirty bad girl # Transcript : Raceman Subtitles : Willow's Team - What city? - Hi, in Astoria, a Donna Spadaro, please. Hold for number. Shoot, sorry. Never mind. - Hi, Daniel. It's me-- - Betty, I need you now. - Where are you? - I'm at the loft. Hurry. It's an emergency. Hello? What's going on? I gotta go. Daniel just called. He needs me. - It's Thanksgiving. - I know, I know. Unbelievable. What about cooking dinner with dad? Will you tell him I'm sorry? Look, it's the Eva Longoria float. We love you, Eva. What if she has hidden cameras in here? Oh, trust me, if she had hidden cameras in here, I'd have been fired a long time ago. Hey, what's that weird float over there? That's not a float. That's Betty. You called me over here to help you pick out a shirt? This is your big emergency? Would you rather I swallowed a bottle of pills? It took you 45 minutes to get here. I'd be dead already. I left my family on Thanksgiving. I had to cut across the parade route. I almost got run over by those "queer eye" guys riding a giant pilgrim. Okay, that came out wrong. Betty, this is an emergency. I have to sit across from Sofia and her boyfriend at this brunch. I've got to look good. Are you wearing cover-up? I have a pimple, all right? Go away. You know what? I am going away. Good-bye, Daniel. No, no, wait. What about the shirts? And we haven't even talked shoes yet. I know this might come as a surprise to you, but I have a life, too, and a family that counts on me a lot. They already think that I put you in front of them. My dad is in legal problems, my sister may have hired some shady lawyer, and it's up to me to fix it. So I sorry if I don't think that coming over here and helping you pick out a shirt to impress a girl is priority. And can I just say one more thing? No, I don't really want to hear any more-- You're an amazing person, Daniel. Ah,  if you just wanna blurt it out... You're smart, you're handsome, you were voted one of the top ten bachelors in the city - by some magazine. - "Esquire." I cannot believe that Sofia actually has you questioning what a catch you are. Trust me, Hunter is the one who should be nervous about sitting across from you. Thank you, Betty. Go with the purple. Really? I came all the way down here. Okay, no, no, I'll wear the purple. Hey, mom, is it okay if I sit between dad and Christina? I really want to talk to her about Stella McCartney's spring line. Great. I'm sure your father will be very proud. Hilda, what are you doing? Forget the spoon. Get your hands in there and feel it. I'm not feeling it. I just got a manicure. Ay, dios m√≠o. Where's your sister? She's got hands like meat hooks. He's here! Dad's here! He actually showed. How about that? Don't. I guess when we want him to leave, we can just tell him you're pregnant and watch him run. He's good at that. Ancient history, papi, okay? And let's not forget the reason he's here is to give us the money to pay for a lawyer so that you don't get deported. Well, look at you, little man. Hi, dad. What happened to that little shrimp I saw last time I was here? That was, like, a year ago. This is to make up for some lost time. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks. Place never changes. The only thing missing is your old man sleeping in front of the TV. Because the old man is busy cooking dinner. Ignacio. You look good, man. Glad you could make it. Hi. Um, are you Donna Spadaro? You don't know me. I'm Betty Suarez. Yeah? I'm so sorry to be bothering you, but I just wanted to ask you about a lawyer you might have used--a Leah Stillman? Are you from the bar association? I called you people three months ago. No, no, no, no, I was just thinking about hiring her. Don't do it. I was fighting for custody of my kids. She tells me, "no problem. I'll win." Guarantees it. She files some papers, takes all my money, and I never hear from her again. Really? She promised she'd have 'em home with me for Thanksgiving. Hey, cool, a costume. Actually, it's a uniform, man, from the Jets. They're the best. Except for the Giants. Hey, look at this. I got you a helmet and a football. Cool! Mom... Look, I'm the Phantom of the Opera. Hey, look who's here. - Hi, Santos. - Sorry. So word is, you're a big career girl now. Yeah, not that big. Where's Hilda? Hilda! I need to talk to you about-- - Hi, Leah! - Hi. She came over to pick up the rest of the money that Santos brought. Hope they pay you double time for calling you in on a holiday. You know, I should really get going and let you get to your dinner. Oh, okay. I'll get you the rest of the money. Wait! I need to talk to you first. Upstairs. So what-- Oh, so now you're listening to that skank, Gina Gambarro? No, Hilda, I went to the woman's house, and I saw her myself. Well, maybe it's a different Leah. Maybe they got the name wrong. I just think that before we give that woman all of our money-- Well, I just think this is more about the fact that I found Leah - and you didn't. - What?! Oh, yeah, this is all making sense. I found the lawyer, I'm saving dad from being deported, I even helped dad with the cooking. You're not the golden child anymore. You can't deal with it. Hilda,I am just trying to help. Well, maybe we don't need your help. You can't just get involved with the family when it's convenient for you, Betty! So save your guilt for someone who cares. # Ladies and gentlemen-- The Dreams! # # We're your dreamgirls # # Boys, we'll make you happy # # Yeah # # We're your dreamgirls # # Boys, we'll always care # #  We're your dreamgirls # # Dreamgirls will never leave you # # Oh # # And all you have to do is dream # # baby # # We'll be there... # # Dream whoo! # # Dreamers will help # # you through the night # I wish I hadn't given up my lessons. I could have been on Broadway. Oh, well, you did date that chorus boy from "Miss Saigon" for a while. That kind of counts. What's your biggest regret? Drinking a bottle of champagne on an empty stomach. No, seriously. There's gotta be something you wish you hadn't given up. Daniel. Oh, sweetie. Oh, I'm so stupid. I knew what the rules were. I didn't mean for it to happen. I just fell in love with him. Me, too. - What? - What? - Huh? - Nothing. You look pretty. You wanna try on some Armani? How are you doing, mother? Adjusting to life on the outside? I'm on my fourth club soda. I pee every three minutes. Ah, you'll get through it. Hmm. You know, I don't think I've ever been to one of your father's work functions sober. I always thought there were twice as many people. Dad. Daniel. Drinking club soda, too? Very supportive. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. I think it just got a little happier. Hey, you. You must be Hunter. I've heard so much about you. I really like that vest. No, no, I'm Gordon Levine, editor of "Tech Wiz," the 14th floor. Hunter's over there. Man, how are guys like us supposed to score with someone like him around? Desperate times call for desperate measures. Martha, it's Wilhelmina. Oh, hi, Wilhelmina. This is why I should always screen. So, Martha, happy Thanksgiving. Yeah, yeah, you, too. Listen, I only have a second. My guests are arriving, and I still have to hollow out the pumpkins - for the soup course. - Sorry to bother you. - Um, I'm cooking a turkey and-- - You're cooking! Hey, maybe I could run a fashion magazine. It'll be like "Freaky Friday." Well, for your information, I was doing fine until I noticed the bird still had its luggage inside of it. Sorry... you want me to put my hand where? So then we realized, it's not a Halloween costume. He really is a homeless guy. No, and he stole my purse. Yeah, that's funny. So where did you two kids meet, anyway? Aw... on a plane, coming home from Kenya. She was there for a photo shoot, and I was working with the peace corps. He shared his complimentary nuts with me, and then he cried when they showed "Bridget Jones' Diary," and I was hooked. So you worked for the peace corps. Well, I figured there had to be more to life than modeling and racing sports cars. Well, you know. Yeah. Ah. I spent a year setting up this irrigation pump. Seeing these tribal kids' faces when they saw fresh water for the first time... Oh, baby. Yeah, I know what you mean. Once, I helped these kids open up a hydrant on, um, 76th street, and they were just like, "wow." Fey? I saw her just now. She's alive. - What are you talking about? - I saw Fey. No, you didn't. She's dead, Bradford. I can't believe you're doing this to me. I tried to go after her. She just... disappeared. Like some wishful hallucination. Are you okay? He's just had too much to drink. I've got him. Ironic, isn't it? Hilda thinks I'm jealous? Why, because for once she's actually carrying her weight around here? I mean, maybe it is time that the family stopped depending on me for everything. I just asked where I should put my coat. I don't know. Ask Hilda. She knows everything. Run while you can. Not bad. Hello? Anyone home? I'm in the kitchen. The kitchen? What, did you get lost or something? What, are you staying for a month? Laundry. The washing machines at the dorm are skanky. I'll throw in a load later. Okay, happy Thanksgiving. I've gotta run. Wait... run? I'm meeting Sarah and Veronica at the concert. What concert? We're going to see Death Cab For Cutie at the Beacon. That's why I came into the city. Why, what'd you think? Nothing. I figured you'd have plans. I mean, you always have plans. And I do. Of course I do. I have Donatella's Thanksgiving party to go to, which I'm horribly late for. Mom, are you okay? Nico, I'm fine. I just made a little snack in case... well, I'm sure it's not very good, anyway. I'm gonna go change. Hey, come try these on with me. If I keep doing it by myself, then I'm just a freak. You made me think of Daniel. Now I'm depressed. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get depressed. Up, up, up, up, up. Get up, get up, get up. Up, up, up. I'm gonna tell you a secret. Betty makes $50 a week less than I do. Big news. I checked that out her first week here. Okay. Joelle from styles got knocked up-- no idea who the father is. Yeah, okay. I think Wilhelmina's a lesbian. - What? - A big one. What are you talking about? Okay. She gets these calls all the time from this woman on her cell phone, and she always kicks me out whenever she calls, and we're like this. Hell, she even had me bring her her diaphragm to the plaza when she was sleeping with that guy from Texas. So--oh, wait. There goes my lesbian theory. So who is this woman? Oh! My god. The pain is totally gone. - You're amazing! - I told you. So are you ready to get out of here? Oh, how about we burn some of this turkey off and go dancing later on? Well, you know I can't dance. Oh, come on. Take me to that place that I love that you never take me to. I can dance. What? I'm good at dancing. I love dancing. I think the three of us should go dancing. I think that's a great idea. Okay, well, I'm outta here. Happy turkey day. Oh, Leah, thanks again for everything. Now if you need me, I'll be eating a turkey sandwich at my office, getting your papers ready to file for your green card. You really think if we go to court, I'll be okay? I have never lost a single case yet. Oh, really? What about Donna Spadaro? - Betty-- - Excuse me? I'm sorry, Hilda. I cannot just sit here and watch her lie to us. - Leah, I am so sorry-- - No, no, it's okay. So, Betty, what exactly do you know about Donna Spadaro's case? That you couldn't have won her case, because you took her money and you disappeared. It's true that I didn't win that case, because I quit before it ever went to trial. I wasn't interested in letting an alcoholic gain custody of her children. An alcoholic? A week before her court date, Donna Spadaro left her three kids locked in her car in 90-degree heat while she got bombed in a local bar. The money that I stole from her merely covered filing and court costs. But I bet you didn't hear that part, huh? No. I didn't. I'm sorry. Listen, maybe you should find a new lawyer, one that Betty approves of-- No, no, you are the lawyer we want. Betty is on some crazy power trip. This has nothing to do with you. Please, Leah, we need you. Yeah, and you know, you can't have Thanksgiving dinner at the office. Why don't you come back tonight and you have dinner with us? We would love to have you. Well, it sure beats a sandwich. You know what? I-I'd like that. Good. Meet me at the cemetery tonight. I'm going to find out if she's alive, one way or the other. And here was me, afraid that spending the holiday alone with my cat was gonna be depressing. Hilda, it's almost 7:00. Yeah, I know what time it is. Leah said she'd be here. She'll be here. Hello? - It's Daniel. - Of course it is. Well why would you tell her you can dance if you can't dance? No, I can dance. I just didn't know we were coming to this kind of club. You gotta teach me. Daniel, I can't teach you how to salsa on the phone. What am I gonna do? Okay, okay, okay, okay, don't panic. Look, have you ever even tried to mambo? Oh, yeah. Back in prep school we had a big mambo contest every year. The basic idea of salsa is that the man is trying to seduce the woman, and the woman is pushing him away. So take your left foot, and you tap on the first beat. My left foot. Step forward with the same foot... Okay, forward... Rock back on your right, and bring your left to close. Back on my right foot, left to close. And then you just reverse that, - just like that. - On my right foot... - Yeah. - I think I could do that. Look in a mirror. Are you biting your lower lip? No. Yes, you are. Don't do that. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Put... it... down. How does she do that? She's a little bit of a witch. Give or take a letter. Oh, hold on. There you are. - Isn't this place hot? - Oh, yeah. It just kinda makes me wanna tap on the beat with my left foot, rock back on my right. Where's Hunter? He hates it that I dragged him here. Oh, poor guy. - Can't be great at everything, right? - Hey, you, come here. I need a mojito, and then you're next. What the hell was that? You told me you were a lousy dancer. I am. I was this close to making the ballroom dancing finals in Vienna in 1988 and blew it with my paso doble. I stink. I still don't know why the hell we had to do this tonight. Because I start my Christmas shopping tomorrow, and I want to know whether I need to get a gift for Fey. Where the hell's the body? Save the tired tatrics. You think I'm an idiot? You've been working for her the whole time. You don't know what you're talking about. Where is she? She's dead. Have it your way. What the hell? You told someone about this? Mr. Green is a recent hire of mine. To do what? To clean up messes. I just thought I'd reheat the gravy since... What's wrong? I just tried Leah's cell-- twice-- and her office number... all disconnected. Go ahead and say it. "I told you so." Get me the hell out of here. Daniel, we need to talk. What, did Hunter just save an orphan from a burning building? Forget it. I'll read about it in the "post"-- Come on. Move over. You walked out of there so upset. I thought we were gonna try to-- Tell me that doesn't mean anything. I can't-- Tell me, and I'll drive away right now. When we pass by each other in the halls, we can pretend we don't even know each other. Of course you know that meant something. Then what are we doing, Sofia? We're not in fifth grade. Why are you with that guy? Because I love him, and this morning, in his dresser, I found a ring. Is that what you want? - Yeah. - Really? Yes. Don't let my motorcycle and the Gucci sunglasses fool you. I'm an old-fashioned girl. I want the white picket fence and lots of babies, and Hunter offers me that. You... I don't think you're anywhere close to being there. I don't think you know me that well. Are you telling me that you are ready to settle down? Come on, Daniel. This is where you stop me from walking back into that club. What's all this? Well, turns out I don't have to meet my friends for a while. Thought I'd have a snack. You wanna join me? I told you I had plans. Come on. It's Donatella. There's gonna be seven models fighting over a celery stick. Well, I... suppose I have a minute. I can't believe you did all of this. It was nothing. I just-- Mother. Stop. Thank you. So how's everything at that overpriced boarding school you're at? Tell me about your classes. Well, calculus sucks, but psych is pretty cool. Oh, and I have this history teacher-- you can have your headphones in his class, and he... - What are you doing? - I'm making the bu√±uelos. Will you stop with those things? Leah stole our money. We can't even go to the police because we can't tell them dad's illegal. It's still Thanksgiving, Hilda, and we're still a family, and I'm making mom's dessert. I can't believe I was so stupid. I should've checked her out. It could happend to anybody. A lot of people believed her story. We're just so desperate, and I wanted to come through for once, you know? To be the big hero. Well, you can help me finish these. Fine. You know, if anyone's to blame, it's me. - Oh, shut up. - I'm serious. I'm gonna hit you. At least you've been trying to help. I didn't make it to Justin's pageant. I mean, maybe this stupid job isn't worth it. Well, you can't live your life for your family, Betty. You've been taking care of us since mom died, and maybe it's time for us to stop relying on you so much. Well, I like it that you rely on me. Taking care of the family is the one thing I knew I could do. I wasn't ever gonna be the pretty one. Okay, look. Maybe you don't have to take care of everything. Maybe we're stronger than we think. Hell, I put these nails in stuffing today. Big deal. Ay. I'm gonna kick your butt. - I'm not gonna answer that. - It's okay. Tell Daniel I said hi. Here it is. I found it-- her cell phone bill. That's the number! 2:00 a.m. 6:00 in the morning. I can't believe you're doing this. Wilmont Surgical Center. Hi. This is Wilhelmina Slater. Yes, Ms. Slater. I'll put you right through. She's putting me through. - Through to who? - I have no idea. Why are you calling me from the office? She knows we called from the office. Yes? Why did you just hang up on me? I didn't. Well, someone did, and they were calling from your office. Excuse me. Hi, I'm Betty. Somebody called me. Yeah, that was me. He's over there. Is he okay? Well, he was ordering scotch rocks for a while, and then when he started ordering "crotch socks," I figured I'd call someone, so... Yours was the number dialed in his cell the most, so I just figured... Thanks. Hi. Betty. Hey. I wore that purple shirt you picked out for me. Your shirt looks great. Do you wanna get out of here? I didn't tell her what she wanted to hear, Betty. It wasn't a very good Thanksgiving. Yeah. I didn't have a very good Thanksgiving, either. Come on. No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! No! Let me out! Let me out of here! No! Let me out!
