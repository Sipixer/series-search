oh, no! okay, i'm leaving. have fun. behave. okay. hilda, he's a nice guy. give him a chance. - don't. - don't. you're crazy. derek jeter is a good-looking guy. sorry, but he doesn't do it for me. - are you kidding me? that guy gets so much-- - don't be gross. fun. the guy gets so much fun, - you wouldn't believe it. - i like fun. i hate that you have to go to work on a saturday. i know, but until "mode" gets back on its feet, - it's gotta be seven days a week. - you know, when you're gone, - i think i'll take a little hike in prospect park. - whoa, whoa, whoa. no no no no. hey, look, why don't you just hang out? i'll bring you some soup, watch tv, you can stay warm. i have cancer, daniel. it's not like a bowl of soup and a nap, and i'll be over it. look, will you do it for me? please. okay. your meeting with miles foster's at 4:00. wilhelmina's on the way. i put out a spread in the conference room-- cheese, olives, salami-- - not the kind that makes you gassy. - betty, that was once. it was a flue. yeah... i wouldn't risk it. also, great news-- the doctor you want for molly is in town for the rest of the week. - here's his number. - dr. simon? that's fantastic. betty, thank you so much for everything today. - i know you're not getting paid. - oh, stop, daniel. if you need my help, i'm always here. and you get to go meet your boyfriend right now. matt is not my boyfriend. if i've learned one thing from molly's illness, it's that if you have something good, you have to enjoy it. i am enjoying it. i just don't want to put a label on it. you know, what's the point? boyfriend, girlfriend-- - what does that mean? - um, i think it means you're getting serious. daniel, all i'm thinking about right now is going to a hockey game. go, rangers! whoo-hoo! so i learned miles has wall-to-wall meetings - with every editor in town. - well, no surprise. whenever he shoots a cover, issues fly off the newsstands. i know. we get him first, though. we have a good chance. i'm afraid we can't afford him. i know. he costs more than our entire photo budget. well, let's make it tasty. - promise him complete creative control. - yeah, great. make him want us more than we want him? - just make sure you play it cool in there. - i always play it cool. well, right now you've got that upper-lip sweat you get - when you're desperate. - it's water. i just washed my face. if that's what you say. we've got a lot riding on this, so let's make it happen. ??? to have you here in mode. we're such fans of your work. that "brady bunch"-inspired shoot you did with brad and angelina and the six kids--genius. how on earth did you get jennifer aniston to play alice? i don't know what's hip or cool. i just... take pictures. i'm trying to do something that makes me feel happy inside. well, wilhelmina and i would certainly love - to make you feel happy inside. - daniel. sorry. did that sound weird? you know what i mean. yeah, yeah, no worries. this all sounds good. let's do it. and you will have complete creative control - with no editorial interference. - fantastic. and we appreciate you taking a cut in your fee. and it's off. you, uh, you do understand that we're in a bit of a crunch. so i have to suffer? mnh-mnh, sorry. i am a freakin' genius, man. you said it yourself. i can go down the block to "vanity fair," and they'll pay my fee. so listen. you have until friday. if you have the money, i'll sign the contract, and if not... sayonara. we need him. yes, we do. so this is gonna have to come out of our own pocket. wilhelmina, if you want, i can cover this. no, that won't be necessary. i'll cover my half. come on. i have more resources than you. - how about i pay? - how about you worry about your end, and i'll worry about mine, okay? i got this. no problem. hello? matt! hello? matt! hello. oh, good. someone's here. i'm back early. left my bags by the service entrance. if you could go and, uh, bring them in. hi. i'm betty. oh. victoria hartley. i didn't realize you were new. but i'm very good with names. i won't forget. oh, you'll enjoy it here. the first, uh, monday of every month, - i give away my old shoes. - oh, no. um, i'm betty... suarez. i'm dating matt. really?

- yeah, i don't know why i added that details. - it's weird, uh, especially since i have a sister. - what? - no, no, i don't have a sister. it's a bad joke! - so what, were you, like, hiding me from her? no, i was hiding her from you. i-- look, my mom is tricky, betty. she's judgmental and controlling, and no one i date is ever good enough for her. well, then why didn't you just tell me that? moms love me, matt. she'll love me. - she just has to get to know me. - you know, i just didn't want to put you through the victoria hartley taste test. but you have to put me through the victoria hartley taste test. she's your mother. and if my family didn't like the taste of someone i was dating, well, then that would matter. - can we drop the whole taste thing? - yeah, let's. look, i'm just saying, it matters if your mom likes me. it matters for us, you know? when can i meet her again? seriously? yeah. i can handle anything. dinner, lunch, coffee-- i'm really good at coffee. how about a party? she's having this... thing on friday night. - hmm. i didn't get an invitation. - okay! okay, okay. would you like to go to a party with me - at my mother's apartment friday night? - ooh, friday? i think i have an online scrabble tournament. i'm just kidding. yes! let's do it. you're the best, you know that? okay, let's go. i don't want to be late for the game. - keep the change, buddy. - thanks. willie... selling your possessions? isn't that, like, one rung above appearing on a reality show? i have to, marc. it's not just that photographer. running meade costs a fortune. - i can't let daniel leverage me out of the company. - but you're rich. - in certain things-- real estate, clothing, attitude. - mm. but daniel has cash, and i don't. - your taste is extraordinary, ms. slater. - i know. that sable is spectacular. is the lining hand stitched? oh, yes, by a seamstress from paris whose great-great-grandfather was furrier to napoleon. wow. really? - how the hell should i know? - oh. hey, why can't you just ask one of your rich friends for money, like the donald or sumner or martha? and have one of those bitches own me? no way. my money, my equity. wow, you're, like, the world's sexiest economics teacher. marc, if i panic now, i will lose everything. so with a few short-term cutbacks here and at the office, i'll be fine. - ms. slater, may i-- - let's cut the bryn mawr niceties, okay? - do you want my things or not? - we do. don't worry ms. slater, we're very discreet. good. come back on friday with the check for the down payment. oh... for god sake. marc, stop crying. if you'd like, you may try on the sable... one last time. hey, betty, a little bird told me about your fancy dinner - with your rich boyfriend. - oh, was the little bird looking at the calendar - on my desk? - well, what am i supposed to do? you never open up to me anymore. - when we were roomies, we shared everything. - no. amanda, you shared everything. and some of it was weird. you know, b., you are playing this matt thing perfectly. a few more moves, and you will be - in the gold digger hall of fame. - i am not a gold digger. i could care less about matt's money. and... cut, print, oscar. don't change a word. you nailed it. amanda, i really like matt, and he likes me. - and now i just need his mom to like me. - hmm. the show was tragic. but if i know henri, he'll be back on top in no time. excuse me. marc! it's 4:00. i'm sorry, it's time for my afternoon caviar and champagne. i'll have to call you back. good grief. what the hell is this? marc! what is this? it's an almond, and that's seltzer. where is the beluga? where's the krug? we can't afford it with our new office budget. i was worried that you might react this way, - but remember, you said that you wanted to make sacrifices. - you're right, you're right. this is exactly what i was talking about. it's what we need. so, um... almonds, you said? yes. almonds... mmm. is there anything else that i can... do for you? i'm fine. i have everything i need. so... eight years ago, molly was diagnosed. - they didn't catch it early. - yes, i can see the cancer was rather advanced. - that's why the treatment was so aggressive. - but it worked. i mean, look at her. she's healthy. listen, all that matters is her ability to respond to my treatment, and based on what i'm seeing, there's only a small chance, but it is a chance. i'm about to begin work on a new clinical study. i will send the information to your office. you'll let me know what you want to do. - could we have a couple of days to think about it? - molly, no. dr. simon, we don't need to take a few days. we have our answer. we're in. mrs. meade! i was wondering if you could help me with something. oh, you're worried about victoria hartley's party. - daniel told you? - he tells me everything. oh, by the way, hilda should totally go out with that councilman. so, uh, you-- you know mrs. hartley? oh, yes. see, i've never been to anything this fancy. - what do i need to know? - oh, betty, please, you know which fork to use. - outside in. - mm-hmm. and the bread plate is on... - my left. - and the big glass is for... - red wine! - so you're fine. what's the topic? - uh, topic? - all these east side cows always have a topic of conversation they like to introduce during the meal. - last week, mine was the romanov dynasty. - oh, no, i don't know what the topic is. - what if it's something that i know nothing about? - well, do you have the phone number? - yes. - dial it. - uh... - we'll get one of the maids to tell us. oh, that's a great idea. okay. hello, yes, may i please speak to consuela? there's always a consuela. hola, consuela. ¿Como esta? that's all i got. you're up. oh, um... hola, senora. hola. um... me llamo betty suarez. ¿Y queria saber si sabias, uh, el tóPico de discusióN... por la fiesta esta viernes? oh! oh, <i>perfecto!</i> gracias! ha! torture! the topic is torture! isn't that great? that's a little obvious. arianna did torture at her luncheon last year. we waterboarded liz smith. i just read this article in "the new republic" about the ethics of torture. oh, i'm so happy. thank you. i'm so glad. hey, willie, i just got a bulletin from engineering. major fashion news all the tvs need to be turned off. they're doing some sort of test or something. no computers, either. - there's a virus going around or something. - marc, what is going on? nothing, it's just tech stuff. it's completely normal. - don't read any papers tomorrow--bad ink. - don't make me hit you. okay! i got a call from my source at "fashion buzz," and there's a story going around that might have something to do with you. but i've saved the best piece of gossip masquerading as news for last. which fabulous fashion world editor, "mode"-ivated <i>by a recent</i> reversal of fortune, has begun to sell off her clothes willy-nilly? oh, and this tidbit positively slay-ter-ed me. her daily snack is now a healthy combination of food-stamp-friendly nuts and soda water. it's all so delicious... and humiliating. i'd tell you more, but i'm on my way out to a local thrift store to purchase one of wilhelmina slater's former possessions. oops. did i say her name? wilhelmina slater i'm sorry. because you know i'd never mock someone when they're down. i have <i>no</i> idea how it got out. i swear i didn't tell anyone. it's fine, marc. obviously, there's a mole here somewhere. and i promise you, i will find it, and i will have it removed. cancel my calls and meetings. i'm done for the day. - can i get you anything? - no, i'm fine. - willie-- - i said i'm fine. there are some who would argue that under certain circumstances, torture is permissible. but others would say-- ow! justin, that is tight! don't you want to look good for matt's mom? - yes. - well, this is one of those instances where torture is necessary. good luck. elena, that's one too many plates. - remember? betty's leaving. - oh, that's all right. just leave it. - no, i'll take it into the kitchen. - no, no, don't bother. it's no bother. what is going on? hilda, remember how you asked me to let you know when you do that thing with your eyebrows that makes you look like the son of sam? hey, everyone. thanks so much for having me over. hey, archie, great to see you. councilman? - <i>bienvenido, seÑOr.</i> - hey, hey. welcome. here--here, take the wine. - thank you. - it's so good to see you. come on in. - bye, hilda. - unh-unh. i am gonna get you for this. oh, come on, hilda. try and have a good time. archie is great. you deserve a good guy. willie. willie, the auction house people are here to do the pickup. one second. willie? wilhelmina, are you here? hello, marc. you know what? - i am not happy about this. - come on. just give him a chance. i hope you' hungry. because ignacio's been cooking up a storm. well, i can't tell you how good it is to get a home-cooked meal. - really, thank you so much for having me over. - please, you must be always having dinner - oh... - with mayors and governors and princes and bishops-- no, it's more like chinese takeout - alone in my apartment, really. - he's so modest. the man's a celebrity, and he's so modest. papi, he's a queens councilman. he's not justin timberlake. thank you, hilda, for keeping my feet on the ground. you see that? hilda could be good for you. hey. excuse us for a second. stop scowling. i don't like surprises, elena. mom... here's your medication. thank you. - thank you. - enjoy. wow. everything's so fancy. and everyone looks so... perfect. yeah, only 'cause they've had an army of people working on them all afternoon. and you look beautiful. thank you. you look so... - hello, honey. - ah. don't you look handsome? i love that tie on you. - where'd you get it? - you bought it for me. oh. well, aren't i clever? - um, you've met betty. - oh, yes, of course. i'm, uh, i'm so happy that you could make it. and i won't ask you to bring up any of my bags tonight. matthew, don't just stand off to the side. make sure you circulate. edith, i love your new labradoodle. - well, that didn't go so bad. - right, and remember, - you still have "torture" to look forward to. - mm-hmm. - stuffed mushroom? - ooh. i'll be right back. excuse me. hello there. - oh, uh, hi, judge wincroft. - we're right over there. - mmm. - he has an s&m dungeon - in the basement of his weekend house. - hmm. this is great. uh, betty. i'd like you to meet judge wincroft. it's very nice to meet you. matt, i don't know where my mushroom cap went. excuse me. dinner is served. but first, i would like to introduce everyone to the newest piece in the hartley art collection. beginning in december, it will be on display at the louvre. but right now it is here in my living room. oh, my god, is that a mushroom cap? oh, it's ruined. what is an appetizer doing on my painting? actually, miss-- it was me, mom. that's my mushroom cap. i was fooling around, tossing stuff at, uh, mr. randolph. i-i apologize. oh, no, that's fine. if the artist were alive, he'd get a good laugh, but he's dead, which is why it's so valuable. into the dining room, everyone. so unlike matthew to do something like that. i guess you bring out his... playful side. hmm? i'm so sorry. it's okay. don't worry. marc, i thought i would be fine, selling everything... but i'm not. so then don't. but i need the money. why, god? why? what have i done to anger you? i just hate seeing you like this. are you taking a picture of me on your cell phone? no. <i>no.</i> oh! this is killing me as much as it's killing you. do you think i like living without your luxuries? that's just it, marc. they're not just luxuries. these things are who i am. each fur tells a story. each piece of jewelry is a piece of me. it reminds me that i've achieved something, because, damn it, i have. i came from nothing, and i've accomplished something. - but your father was a senator. - oh, shut up. it's the woman from the auction house. what do you want me to tell her? take it. take all of this. do with it what you want. i don't care anymore! just bring me the money! - marc, do you like what you see? - uh-huh. well, get used to it, because starting now, mama is downsizing. not where it counts, baby! all right. so i am gonna run by the office, close the deal with this photographer. then i'm gonna be back with a couple of steaks, bottle of wine. - you and i are gonna celebrate. - have you read about the treatment, daniel? - some of these side effects are rough. - i know, but, i mean, molly, it could work. 10% chance, and considering my history, more like 2%. yeah, but it's still 2%. i mean, come on, think about our future. there is no future, daniel. this, what we have right now, is our future. - don't say that. - i'm dying, daniel. no! i realize that it's so hard for me to understand what it is you're going through. molly, i'm not going anywhere. i'm gonna be right by your side through all of this. i promise. please. i'm sorry, honey. i know how i want to live the rest of my life, - and it's not like this. - molly, don't-- i can't do it. so anyway, this council meeting went on forever, and it was just so hot in there, i actually fell asleep. i mean, i even snored. - you didn't. - well, it could have been embarrassing, but i managed to turn my snore into a "nay." that's hilarious. isn't that hilarious, hilda? really. oh, yeah, that is funny. well, i know i'm gonna hate myself in the morning, but i'm gonna treat myself to one more new potato. this was an incredible meal, ignacio. it was my pleasure, your honor. i just hope we can make a habit of this. - right, hilda? - oh, yes. absolutely. you should just come whenever you want. everybody, please be seated. - are you sure there's nothing i-- - don't worry about it. matthew, i thought it would be fun if we split couples up. - come. i want you back there with me. - um, mom, i want to sit with betty. no, stop. the name cards were placed hours ago. - it's all been settled. - it's okay. ignacio, come help me with dessert. oh, yeah. excuse us. oh, justin. - i'm trying to enjoy my new potato. - mm-hmm. hey. excuse me. so how awkward is this for you? what? no! why would this be awkward? because they're working their butts off trying to fix us up. archie, i'm sorry. honestly, i didn't know. they just sprung this on me. please. it happens all the time. i'm a reasonably attractive man in his 40s with a midlevel government job. i'm a... catch. and you, your eyes have a story that they wish to tell, and i have my whole life, and i listen well. that's a justin timberlake song. oh, i'm so glad you got that, 'cause that would have been really weird. oh! thank you. i'm so pleased you could all be here tonight. there's just so much to talk about, so many interesting things happening. but, um, you know me. i like to stick to one topic, and it's something that has been, uh, much on my mind, because it speaks to how civilized people should live. betty says: torture! what is going to be... the future of opera? opera? you have a thought, betty? i was just so excited to hear the topic. i'm sorry. please go on. oh, no. really, why don't you start us off? everybody, this is, uh, betty suarez. she is a friend of matthew's. please, betty. i'd be fascinated to hear your opinion. the future of opera. go. my experience with opera... is not so vast. so i guess my opinion... is not so... you know, fully... you know, formed... as... as some of you... matt says:mode photo spread "opera" last november gareth pugh carmen aida the ring rigoletto opera is fashion. meaning? meaning that the opera will thrive as any art thrives-- uh, by evolving and embracing new ideas and, of course, by giving its audience a grander, more hopeful version of themselves. that is as succinct and insightful a piece of criticism as i have ever heard. do you mind if i use it in my next column? but what do you mean when you say "fashion"? well, i work at "mode." i love "mode." it's like my bible. you know, and in some respects, what is more archaic than couture dresses? - like opera. - exactly, and eventually, these couture collections have an enormous influence on our modern style. and opera can do the same thing. absolutely right. i saw "don giovanni" on the lawn last year... here you go, councilman. - ah. thank you for the takeout, ignacio. - it was my honor. - who knows? my cooking may be eaten by royalty. - well, i was thinking of leaving a little for my cleaning lady tomorrow. just as good. uh, honey, could you come help me in the kitchen with, uh... - you know. - oh, yeah. the "you know." - that--that thing. uh, good night. - mm-hmm. - excuse us. - thanks again. yeah. subtlety doesn't run in this family's genes, so... i guess according to their plan, this is when i'm supposed to ask you out. yeah. yeah, that's the plan. - well, good night. - whoa, wait a minute. you're gonna disappoint them like that? - my dad cooked you dinner. - hilda, you're great. and nothing would make me happier than to take you out on a real date-- - one that you know about. - that sounds good. okay, guys. i asked her out, and she said yes. - what? oh, my god! - what? what a surprise! - we had no idea! - oh, we're shocked. ay, please. miles, what can i say? we just couldn't live without you. well, listen, i am so sorry about the way our last meeting ended. i just hate getting caught up - in all these messy business details. - and yet you do. - i know. i'm so cute. - so i guess we'll check in next week, - start kicking around a concept? - whatever. i am easy. love to you both. air kiss. air kiss. au revoir. so i see you put your money together. daniel, if we're gonna be partners, we need to be partners all the way. so i did what i had to do. you know... i know you think i'm always looking for a way to muscle u out, but really, i'm not. life is too short. well, how about that. daniel meade is waxing philosophical. just beginning to realize what's most important... because of molly. she's just determined to live life on her own terms, even if it kills her. oh, mrs. hartley. hi. i was just looking at your pictures. - they're great. - oh. mm. so, betty, where did you go to college? - um, queens college. - oh, lovely. and were you the first person in your family to go? yep. yeah, i-i lived at home, and i worked the whole time, but i did it. good for you. that's wonderful. you're ambitious. i can see you're going places. oh, wow. thank you. yes. uh, matthew went to yale. he speaks three languages. uh, he spent a year in rome on a fulbright. - have you heard him play the piano? - nope, not yet, but i can wait to. oh, well, he plays beautifully. he took lessons for years at the turtle bay music school. - do you know it? - no. i haven't heard of it. oh, it's a wonderful place. all the kids study there. so, uh, tell me, what exactly do the two of you have in common? uh, w-well, loads. uh-huh. loads. betty, i have high hopes for my son. he's been given every privilege, and i expect him to take advantage of that. okay. uh, i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. what i'm saying is that, uh, i hope you enjoyed your meal tonight, but i don't think that we'll be seeing you again. you know, if you're, uh, cold, you could just say something. we have, like, 17 fireplaces. your mother just told me that i'm not good enough for you and we don't have a future. i'm leaving. - no, betty, please, please don't go. please. - matt-- what if she's right? - matt, what if it matters that i didn't go to yale? - it <i>doesn't</i> matter. - this is too much for me. - hey, hey, hey. - i am not gonna come between you and your mother. - no, you won't. i'd like have you both in my life. - what, and just keep us apart all the time? - now, betty, please listen. look, i want this relationship to have a future. you have to trust me, all right? don't worry about her. oh, matthew, dessert is ready. - come in after you say good-bye to your friend. - i'm not saying good-bye to her, mom. - oh? - i'm saying good-bye to you. betty and i are leaving. - oh, don't be ridiculous. just come-- - no, i don't know exactly what you said to her, - but i can guess. - matthew-- good night, mother. i'm leaving with my girlfriend. are you okay? of course. why wouldn't i be? no reason. nothing. i just don't want our budget snacks to set off another one of your... episodes. i swear, marc, if you took a picture of me on your cell phone, i will kill you and eat you. but i've arrived at a better place, - and daniel helped me get there. - the boy blunder? how? molly wants to live her life till the day she dies. and damn it, so do i! but what about the cash? what about the equity? i can live without the furs and the jewelry. but to hell if i'm gonna sacrifice everything. i've worked too hard to let it all slip away. so... how are you going to pay for it? i will do whatever i have to do. maybe i'll take out a second mortgage. all i know for sure is, as god is my witness, i will never go without champagne and caviar again. now pass me a bellini, please. and i know it's horrible, - but i'm just so frustrated about it. - because she won't do the treatment? i get what she'saying. i do. it's just... i've done everything right, and for the first time in my adult life, i am really in love, and i don't want to lose it. - and--and this treatment, it could work. - but, daniel-- no, i know, i know i'm not the one with cancer. of course it's her decision, but-- look, she's just trying to give you - the time she does have left. - but i want more. sometimes you can't get more. sometimes you have to take what you get. oh, hold the door! - hi, mrs. meade. - hello, betty. so did you wow victoria hartley with your take on torture? no, not quite. she changed the topic. oh, that old trick. and then she told me that i was completely wrong for her son. ooh. she's really playing by the rich bitch handbook. i keep thinking there's gotta be something i can do - to make her like me. - oh, please, betty. - you're never going to win that woman over. - well, maybe that's true, but i just don't understand why. well, grow up, because not everybody's going to like you. you've just got to suck it up and embrace it. - there's nothing i can do? - hell, yes, there's something you can do. you can throw it right back at her. when one of those silk stocking hags stares me down, do you know what i do? stare back? you got that right. hey. hey, it's cold out. what's going on? you want to live life? we're gonna live life. put on your jacket. we're going hiking. - and tomorrow, we're gonna go to the beach. - but it's freezing. i don't care. look, all i know is every free moment of every free day i have is gonna be spent with you. you want to go traveling? you want to stay home? you want to go to the movies? you want to ride around on the friggin' subway all day? it doesn't matter. all that matters is, i love you, molly, and i'm gonna treasure every moment i have left with you. you got a problem with that? no problem. good. let's go play in the snow. okay. hey, where are you? i'm here. well, hurry up. it's a beautiful day. okay. hi, mrs. hartley. - waiting for my son? - he's on his way down. oh, that's right. matthew's moving back in to his apartment today. i won't apologize for who i am or what i think, betty. well, neither will i. what can i say? my judgments are severe. it's just the way i look at the world. well, i'm sorry for you. but i might be around for a while. hey! hey. - ready to go? - all set. want to get a cab? no, let's walk. it's a nice day. so you play the piano? oh, no.
