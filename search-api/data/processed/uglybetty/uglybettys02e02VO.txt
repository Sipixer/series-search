THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BECOMING A FATHER. YOU KNOW, I COULD WORK MY WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER BE THE BEST ACCOUNTANT, BUT MAYBE I-I CAN BE THE BEST DAD. I THINK YOU WILL BE. LISTEN, THE REASON I'M HERE... UH-HUH. I COULDN'T REALLY FIND A GREAT JOB IN TUCSON, AND THE MEADE HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD COVER ALL THE MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR THE BABY, SO-- OH. SO YOU'RE COMING BACK TO WORK. ONLY IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU, BETTY. IF YOU THINK IT'S A PROBLEM, I'LL TURN DOWN THE JOB, BECAUSE I KNOW, IT--IT MIGHT BE WEIRD. NO! NO? I MEAN "NO" IT'S ????

THIS IS FOR YOU. AAH! WHAT IS THAT? IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S BELOVED DOG HALSTON. NICE TRY, SLICK, BUT YOU'RE NOT STICKING ME WITH THIS GREMLIN. DID I HAPPEN TO MENTION THERE'S A $1,000-A-WEEK ALLOWANCE FOR WHOEVER AGREES TO CARE FOR HIM? OH! OH, YES. (baby talk voice) WHO'S THE LITTLE BABY? SO YOU TOLD ALEXIS ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND FEY? LOOK, SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT MOM ON TV, BUT I AM NOT GONNA BE THE ONE TO TELL ALEXIS YOU DIVORCED MOM TO MARRY WILHELMINA, OR THAT YOU REJECTED YOUR OWN CHILD BECAUSE SHE BECAME A WOMAN. I HAVE NO PROBLEM TELLING ALEXIS THE TRUTH. THEN GREAT. HER ROOM'S RIGHT DOWN THERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY IN LUCIFER'S CHAMBER... BEELZEBUB'S LAIR... THE DEVIL'S RUMPUS ROOM. OOH, LOOK.

WHAT WAS THAT? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. WHAT'S UP, DAD? YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME THAT IN YEARS. WELL, I-I WAS A LITTLE HEADSTRONG WHEN I WAS ALEX. MAYBE ALEXIS CAN HAVE A SOFTER TOUCH. MAYBE I CAN, TOO. OKAY, WILHELMINA'S CONTACTS ARE COMPLETELY REORGANIZED. ALSO, I INVENTORIED ALL THE GOWNS THAT SHE WORE ON THE RED CARPET LAST YEAR AND BOOKED HER TRAVEL TO PARIS FOR THIS SEASON'S COUTURE SHOWS.

I DON'T REMEMBER SANTOS HAVING SUCH GOOD TASTE. You're crazy. HE HAD SUCH AN EYE. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. Sweetheart, um, I know everything holds a memory for you now, BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY? When your mother died, I couldn't let go of any of her things-- HER CLOTHES, HER KEY CHAIN. I EVEN FOUND AN OLD RESTAURANT CHECK FROM PIETRO'S IN BAYSIDE. IT WAS FROM THE NIGHT WE GOT ENGAGED. YOUR MOTHER HAD SAVED IT ALL THOSE YEARS, AND WHEN I SAW IT, I... I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED ALL HER THINGS. I HAD HER HEART. SO I KEPT THE CHECK... AND GOT RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT WHERE IS IT? I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW. I REALLY MISS YOU, <i>PAPI.</i> I MISS U TOO. (telephone beeps) HEY, ???? SORRY I'M LATE, MAMA. I'LL GET THE ENCHILADAS STARTED. MIRTA'S NOT HERE.

MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET THERE ON MY OWN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? FORGET THE VISA. I'LL JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER ANOTHER WAY. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL, I'LL BE ONE. I WANNA GO HOME. WELL, THEN... IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY WAY, I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU. DWAYNE, PLEASE HURRY. I SMELL A BURRITO.

WHAT IS THAT SMELL? I THINK IT'S THAT DOG. IT IS NOT THAT DOG. IT SMELLS LIKE ASS. YEAH, AND WHEN YOU'RE 84, YOU'RE GONNA SMELL LIKE ASS, TOO. LEAVE HALSTON ALONE. HE WAS A GIFT TO ME FROM MY MOTHER. I GET $1,000 A WEEK TO TAKE CARE OF HIM, WHICH MEANS $5 FOR DOG FOOD, AND THE NEW BALENCIAGA BAG FOR ME. (wheezes) (gasps) IS HE SUPPOSED TO TIP OVER LIKE THAT? OH, MY GOD! AMANDA! OH, THERE YOU ARE! IS DANIEL IN HIS OFFICE? I DON'T KNOW WHERE DANIEL IS. I HAVE TO GO TO THE VET! HANG ON, HALSTON. DON'T QUIT ON ME. WELL, IF HE WASN'T AT THE HOSPITAL, THEN WHERE COULD HE BE? JUSTIN, ARE YOU DOING OKAY? CAN'T TALK. LOOKING FOR GUA JUICE. WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH IF WILHELMINA'S BOINKING THE BODYGUARD? BECAUSE DANIEL IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO INCRIMINATE WILHELMINA, AND HE COULD USE THIS-- (gasps) OH! GOOD, YOU'RE BACK. WILHELMINA WANTS TO SEE YOU. OH, UM, OKAY, YEAH, GREAT. I JUST HAVE SOME THINGS THAT I NEED TO FINISH UP, AND I'LL STOP BY HER OFFICE ON THE WAY OUT. NO, YOU WON'T. SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW... ON THE ROOF. THE ROOF? THE ROOF. HELLO? WILHELMINA? I BELIEVE YOU LOST SOMETHING. THANK YOU, MARC. YOU CAN GO NOW. YOU SURPRISE ME, BETTY. STEALING MY KEYS? BREAKING INTO MY APARTMENT? TAKING THE BOOK? GOOD FOR YOU. YOU'RE... GROWING. LOOK, I WAS JUST THERE FOR THE BOOK. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HEAR ANYBODY HAVING SEX. LOOK, DWAYNE AND I ARE DEAR OLD FRIENDS. THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BRADFORD. WHOM YOU LOVE, RIGHT? BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH. WHOM I LOVE MADLY. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER? WILHELMINA, I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MY LOYALTIES ARE WITH DANIEL, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME. IT WAS VERY WONDERFUL TO SEE THE ROOF. THANK YOU. PITY ABOUT YOUR FATHER. WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER? OH, I KNOW THAT HE'S STUCK IN <i>MEXICO.</i> SHAME. MY FATHER IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR. HE HELPS PEOPLE GET THEIR VISAS ALL THE TIME. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? (scoffs) COME ON, GIRL. I AM BLACK. YOU'RE MEXICAN. LET'S NOT TALK AROUND IT LIKE A COUPLE OF DULL WHITE PEOPLE. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOUR OLD MAN COMES HOME. SO LIE TO DANIEL? NOT LIE, JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BETTY, AND GET BACK TO ME BY THE END OF THE DAY. NO PRESSURE. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS. HEY, BETTY. WHAT'S UP, BUDDY? AH! OW. HEY. STILL NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT. HEY, I TALKED TO DAD! OH, UH, YOU OKAY? OKAY? I'M GREAT! IT'S JUST WONDERFUL TO KNOW I HAVE SUCH A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY AT A TIME LIKE THIS. SUPPORTIVE? HE'S TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE ABOUT ME BECOMING THIS... WITH THESE. WILL YOU STOP GRABBING THEM FOR A SECOND? DAD... SAID HE WAS OKAY WITH ALL THIS? WHAT ELSE DID HE TELL YOU? (Justin) AND I GOT THE SEEDLESS GRAPES, A TUB OF RED VINES. THE ONLY THING I COULDN'T FIND WAS THE SCULLY FOODS 100% ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL SOY RICE CAKES. AH, THE RICE CAKE-- THE SCOURGE OF MANY A CELEBRITY ASSISTANT.

SUDDENLY I AM A CAREGIVER. ME. THAT IS SO NOT WHO I AM. 'TIS TRUE. YOU ARE A BIT OF A MONSTER ON THE INSIDE. THIS IS HORRIBLE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'D BE BETTER OFF GETTING RID OF HIM. HOW COULD YOU? DAMN IT. HOW COULD YOU LIE TO ALEXIS LIKE THAT? DID I? I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. WELL, LET'S START WITH HOW YOU DIDN'T TELL HER YOU'D REJECT HER IF SHE GOT A SEX CHANGE. I THINK YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE, "YOU'D BE DEAD TO ME." AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER ABOUT WILHELMINA. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH, DAD. YOU'RE RIGHT, DANIEL. I DIDN'T. I SAW ALEXIS LYING IN THAT BED AND REALIZED I ALMOST LOST MY CHILD... AGAIN. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO START A WHOLE NEW RELATIONSHIP. NO WAY. YOU ARE NOT SCREWING WITH HER HEAD LIKE THIS. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER THE TRUTH, I AM. DANIEL... YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO REWRITE THE PAST. I NEED TO FIX THE MISTAKES I MADE. (Ignacio) MIJA? DAD? YOU ALL RIGHT? DAD, HELME! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YEAH, IT'S AOUGH DECISION. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND GET MY ASS HOME FROM MEXICO. BUT DANIEL'S MY BOSS. OH, YEAH? WELL, DID YOUR BOSS BRING YOU HOME IN A LITTLE BLANKIE FROM THE HOSPITAL? DID YOUR BOSS TEACH YOU HOW TO SWIM? DID YOUR BOSS PULL YOU OFF THE TRACKS SECONDS BEFORE A SUBWAY CAR WAS ABOUT TO CRUSH YOU? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID THAT. I DIDN'T, THE FIRST TWO THINGS WEREN'T IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH. FAMILY, BETTY. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY? I KNOW, <i>PAPI,</i> I KNOW. IT'S JUST... IT'S SO WRONG, AND WE SHOULD JUST TRUST THE SYSTEM, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU'LL GET YOUR VISA ON YOUR OWN. AND ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TELL THE TRUTH I HATE IT THAT I RAISED YOU RIGHT. OOH, THOSE SMELL GOOD. CAN I HAVE SOME? YOU'RE HELPING DANIEL. GET DANIEL TO MAKE YOU ENCHILADAS! HEY, CHRISTINA, I WAS WONDERING... DID YOU KNOW IF, FOR SOME REASON, BETTY MIGHT BE MAD AT ME? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MEAN, YOU DID LEAD HER ON, THEN RACE OFF TO TUCSON, THEN AFTER A FEW WEEKS, ONCE SHE WAS STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER, SUDDENLY POP BACK INTO HER LIFE AGAIN. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. OH, HENRY. SHE'S NOT MAD, SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. WELL, I'M CONFUSED, TOO. I MEAN, I KNOW I HAVE THIS OBLIGATION TO CHARLIE AND I CAN'T WAIT TO BE A DAD, BUT...

IF YOU GET CAUGHT, THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU BACK IN, AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY PACK THOSTRUCKS WITH PEOPLE. YOU COULD DIE. IT'S MY LIFE, BETTY. THIS IS MY DECISION. NO, THESE ARE OUR LIVES, DAD-- YOURS AND MINE AND HILDA'S AND JUSTIN. MIJA, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. I LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT. DAD, PLEASE, JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING YET. I KNOW HOW TO GET YOU HOME.

NO, I MEAN, WHEN EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE, YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON HERE I CAN TRULY TRUST. YEAH. SWEETHEART? I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CAVALLI'S PEOPLE. HE IS DESIGNING YOU A CHARCOAL GRAY, SINGLE BUTTON TUXEDO FOR THE WEDDING. AND HE'S FLYING HIMSELF IN FOR THE FITTING. LISTEN, DARLING, WITH ALEXIS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL, I'M NOT SURE A GIANPARTY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU WANT ME TO CUT DOWN THE SIZE OF THE WEDDING? I WANT TO POSTPONE THE WEDDING. BECAUSE OF ALEXIS? I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HER. WE'RE STARTING TO BOND AGAIN. WELL... ISN'T THAT, UH, WONDERFUL? I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. ALEXIS IS STILL COMING TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT HER MOTHER AND I ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER. I'M AFRAID IT MIGHT BE A BIT MUCH FOR HER TO HEAR THAT I'M MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER ABOUT ME? I WILL, WHEN SHE'S READY. YOU STILL LOVE ME? ALWAYS. UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO CALL CAVALLI AND HAVE HIM POSTPONE HIS TRIP. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! (Hilda) BETTY? BETTY! (laughs) PAPI JUST CALLED! HE GOT HIS VISA! HE'S GONNA BE HOME ON THURSDAY! WOW! COOL. THAT'S--I'M SO HAPPY. YEAH?
