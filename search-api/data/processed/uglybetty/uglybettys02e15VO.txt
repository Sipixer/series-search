hit on all those women? That's how I feel every time I see gio around you. I hate that you feel that way. I just won't see him anymore. Betty! Want a ride? I'm here to warn you about renee. I don't believe anything you have to say. Why are you trying to break up me and daniel? Renee, we both know what happens to you when things get too serious with men. (Renee) this is nothing like stony brook. I had a breakdown. I take these. (Wilhelmina) good job, marc. Those pills are all that stand between my sister and the nuthouse. No candles... ever. it's 2:00 in the morning. That gives us five hours till your next meeting. (Daniel) how can you sound so chipper? We've been up till 2:00 A.M. For the last five nights. I can barely think. Well, I have to be chipper enough for the both of us. And besides, past midnight, "mode" pays to send me home in a town car, which is pretty cool. Do you know they have free btles of water? Yes, and a minibar. Don't touch that. Daniel,I need you sharp at 7:00 A.M. oh, hold on. I have another call. Go ahead. Betty! -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÖÜÄê·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> Daniel isn't home yet,and I'm worried. Hi, renee. Uh, yeah, his meeting went really late, but I have him on the other line right now. Oh, thank god. Put me through. I just have to go over his schedule for tomorrow first. Betty, please. I really need to talk to him. Okay. All right. daniel, uh, you have renee on the line. Hey, baby. Hi, sexy. I'm just lying on the bed... all alone. Are you wearing those new panties I got you? Not anymore. No--oh. Oh. women don't really do this,do they? Yes, they do, and they're usually wearing bikinis and covered in mud. Really? Hi, I'm calling from hilda's beautilities with a glamour opportunity or... a glamour-tunity! Hello? Hello? how manyalls is that? 15. I guess people in queens just don't care about beauty. I need 30 sandwiches before the editorial meeting, or people will forget to eat again, and daniel doesn't want anyone passing out like last year. Excuse me. Thank you, gio.You're the best. No, you are. No, you arE.You are. Okay, okay, okay. I-I'm hanging up now. Bye. I barely got any sleep last night. I'm a wreck. Daniel's been keeping you late every night this weeK. Yeah, but I spent half the night dealing with his girlfriend. So wait, she just calls you in the middle of the night? No, no, first she calls,then she texts. It's been going on for, like, a week. It's definitely getting in the way of my work. Let's not let your hair get in the way, too, huh? I can have this hot mess fixed in two minutes. So what's going on with you and gio? I heard you guys on the phone. It's nothing. So... okay, gio and I are friends again. So what? So... wasn't henry jealous of you guys? (Sighs) yeah, he is,but henry doesn't know that I am talking to gio again. Ooh, drama. Tell mama hilda everything. "Mama hilda"? I'm trying it out. Look, gio is a great guy, and I wanna be his friend,and I don't wanna upset henry. I mean, he has been so swe since charlie showed up. Yeah, but are you sure hiding things from him-- that's the best thing for your relationship? Yes.And besides, charlie is leaving for tucson... today! And I want my last four weeks with henry to be stress-free. Oh, I gotta go.Don't wait up! All right. Just got a call-- your first appointment. Let me see. Let meee. Is this a joke? This says "gina gambarro." So I thought you guys made up. We did... till we didn'T. I might have called her a skank to a few people. Well, she is! Well, apparently she forgives you, because she wants a manicure. Mom, don't we need the business... even skanky business? Oh, daniel. Good morning. Coffee,your notes for your advertising meeting, rachel zoe got pushed to 11:00, and if you rush back after lunch, I'm hang curtains put in your office so you can nap between 2:00 and 2:45, right before christian siriano. You scheduled a nap for me? I need you at your best. Oh, I love you. I know. (Sniffs) mmm. You sme good. Oh, it's viktor & rolf,gift from renee. You know, she's always doing little things for me. Yeah. Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Renee keeps calling me  to schedule fun things for you two to do together. See? That's what I mean. She's thoughtful. Yes, but have you taken a look at how packed your schedule is this week? D you make that? Mm. I have a system. Thing is, she gets mad  every time I tell her that you obviously don't have time for a cooking class or dinner at lupa. I know it's a busy week, betty, but I really like this girl. Can you try and work things out? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Thank you. hi, renee. I'm just concerned,dr. Remus. Renee's behavior this past week has been so erratic. Is it possible her medication's not working anymore, or perhaps she stopped taking her pills? Well, it's possible,but it would take some-- well, what symptoms might I look for to know if she's backsliding? Well, your sister has struggled for years with issues of paranoia... what do you mean he's in a meeting? Well, who's he meeting with? Is he trying to avoid me? No. Why would you even say that? Probably coinciding with a rise in irrational,jealous behavior... I know you can't tell me if there's somebody else. You didn't say anything. There is someone, isn't there? Renee, you didn't even give me a chance to speak. As well, I'd expect you might encounter severe mood swings... no, his afternoon cannot be booked up, because I scheduled his and her massages for us today at bliss. The weekend would be better. Bliss! Usually followed by some kind of emotional crash. Are you... crying? (Crying) no. No. I hesitate to even bring this up,but is there a time we should consider... committing my poor sister? We have a lot of work to do. Oh, that's what that means. It's funny how you take away the tiny movements that create wrinkles and suddenly... (singsongy) poker face. Oh, let's get serious, marc. Right now we only have one problem-- dr. Facial hair in there says he won't commit renee until she is a danger to herself or others. (Normal voice) danger? We don't want to hurt anyone, do we? Of course not, but the sooner this is over with, the better. Well... and your future's at stake, too, marc. Renee knows about bradford's baby and could expose our less-than-legal method of procuring a donor. Well, I switched the pills about a week ago, so the crazy train should be arriving at gare du renee  about, well, now. Okay, well, if it doesn't,I'm gonna have to give her a little push. Schedule a lunch today with my sister at la brulee... consider it lunched. Then go back to my place and keep an eye on christina. Ugh. But she scares me. She's so cranky all the time. Well, then pamper her. Let's not forget... that walking womb is carrying my heir. Oh, don't pout. You haven't the lips for it. I mean,I know I promised daniel I would try and get along with her, but it's gotten worse today. Renee is driving me nuts. Hey, just 'cause you promised you'd be nice doesn't mean you let renee walk all over you. Next time she crosses the line, say something. Oh, uh, well, it looks like we're all set here with the sandwiches. Thank you, gio. Bye. Hi. Uh, hey. Was that gio? What? Oh, yeah. He was dropping off sandwiches or something. Hey, listen, why don't we celebrate tonight? You and I should find a place to have dinner at. Betty, I have to tell you something. It's about charlie. Can I pretend for one second that it's gonna be good news? She had a panic attack at the airport, and her doctor's afraid it might bring on early labor. He doesn't want her to travel. She's staying here? Until the baby's born. Look, I am gonna make this work, I promise. I get it. It's fine. Besides, new york city is a great place to be born-- it's very international,it's got great public transportation. You know what? Um, it's getting really busy around here. I re--I gotta go. Betty, I'M... sorry. and before you know it, bang--he asked me to be mrs. Dr. Goldfarb. Well, that is quite a story. And the best part about elopin' on a cruise is we were already in cancúN. We honeymooned in his time-share. Mm, that is so great. And also, you shouldn't feel bad. Everyone gains weight on a cruise. You're probably not used to seein' designer clothes. Roomier is a look ya pay for. So, gina, what brings you back to the neighborhood? Just wanted to say hello to all my old friends... And I wanted to know how you're doing, of course. Oh, things are great. Got my cosmetology license,I'm running my own business. You are lucky that I could fit you in today. And I have to say,this place is adorable. It kind of reminds me of my closet up in mount kisco. Yeah, well, we did what we could with the space. It hasn't exactly been the easiest year. Oh, that's right. I was so sorry to hear about santos, hilda, but if I've learned anything,it's that a higher power has a plan for all of us. Maybe you're just meant to be alone, and that's okay. Oh, sorry. That's a, um, that's a sensitive part of the nail. All right. I think we are done here. You are so good at this. I think I should come back later and have you do my feet. Oh, and I could bring larry. It'll be fun. Ciao. It's never enough  um, what do you think you're doing? Oh, I'm concerned about daniel's posture, so I found this great alexander technique teacher, but he can only see him this afternoon, so... oh, um, see,daniel's schedule is my job, so please don't touch his calendar. Well, he's my boyfriend,so if I want daniel to do something, you can't stop me, missy. Well, he's not available this afternoon. Sorry. Yes, he is. No, he really isn'T. Let go. You let go. give me back my schedule. what's goin' on? Daniel, I tried.It's not wking. I know you really like this girl, but when it comes to is office, it's her or me. What the hell was that? Isn't it obvious? Your assistant is totally in love with you. -==http://Www.Ragbear.Com==- ³ó Å® ±´ µÙ µÚ¶þ¼¾ µÚ15¼¯ -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é==- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£ºÂ¬ ±ó</font> I can't believe it's never occurred to you before-- the way she follows you around, hanging on your every word. Well, renee, she's my assistant. That's sort of her job, right? It's so sweet how modest you are. What do you mean? You exude mystique... power... sexuality. Frankly, I'm surprised most women don't just tear your clothes off. Well, it's happened. And how many of them have been your assistants? But that doesn't mean that betty is actually-- (gasps) doesn't it? She spends all day around a man most women would only dream of having... going over your schedule,determining where you go... which women you can talk to. No, she does do that-- look, I'm just saying be careful. You know, I've seen this sort of thing happen before, and it can become a problem. Maybe you should ask yourself, is there something you might have said to lead her on? (Daniel) you scheduled a nap for me? Oh, I love you. I know. (Sniffs) mmm, you smell great. Oh, god. I am telling you, there is something weird about renee, and it is not just  that she's been getting in the way of my work. I thought the same thing last week, and then things went strangely quiet around here. I think wilhelmina figured out I was snoopin'. She threw out the baby monitor I was using to listen in. (singsongy) christina! Time for a decadent foot rub. (Whispers) and marc has been creepily nice ever since. oh, go away, you wanker! Well, how long does wilhelmina expect you to be on this leave of absence from "mode," anyway? I'm stuck in here until she's sure the baby's safely on the way. I heard on "the view" that relaxation is good for all those baby-makin' hormones. (Whispers) wait a minute. m-morning sickness! Oh, oh, oh! okay, I'll check on you later! All right. Okay, if you want me to start snooping, I will, but you have got to get onto daniel. See what you can find out, okay? Okay. it is just like you to choose this place afteeverything I went through here. Whatever are you talking about? Oh, my. This was gregory's favorite place, wasn't it? I just realized that. W utterly tasteless of me. I'll be leaving now. No, renee. No, please sit. I want to apologize for how I've acted. I only had your best interests at heart. You see, in the past, daniel has cheated on his girlfriends a lot, kind of indiscriminately, but he really seems to have changed for you. You're just saying all of this because you want to start a fight with me. Haven't we fought enough, renee? You're my sister. I care about you. Then why do you want me to think that daniel cheats? Used to cheat. So there's really no reason for you to be worried or jealous. Well, I'm not worried. And come to think of it,what betteplace than this to toast your joyous future and say good-bye to all those awful memories of gregory larson. Happy birthday. gregory... jealous... larson. There must be a mistake. I-I think you have the wrong table. No candles. No candles. you are a dear. (Betty) daniel? I thought it wasa little too bright in herefor your nap. Oh, you don't have to do that. I'm actually, uh, fine. Oh, don't be silly. It'll be so much better with the lights off. what are you doing? Just trying to help you relax. I need you at your bestthis afternoon. How about a massage? just--just let bettytake care of everything. you smell so good, daniel, like--like muscles and power. I want you. No! I mean, maybe. Um, what i think daniel is trying to sayis that he would really like to see some new,different layout ideas... like, um, in an hour? but good job. Thanks. Did I really just fall asleepin the middle of a meeting? Yes, but it's fine. I think they thought it wassome sort of power move. You're probably just exhausted. You just need some rest. No, no, no! Uh, you don't have to close the shades. Totally awake. I'm--I'm fine. Um, okay. Daniel,now that we're alone... there's something that I've beenmeaning to talk to you about. It's a little personal. Um..how personal? It's about...relationships? Just need a second, okay? Well, I think we're safe. The way renee reactedto those candles,shouldn't take long. Best to keep dr. Remuson speed dial. So sad gucci doesn't makea straitjacket. I get no joyfrom this, marc. Well, that's not true. I get a little joy,but it's tempered with sadness. Well, you're not the onewho's guilty of mur-- (gasps) marc,you really have to be carefulabout mentioning reneeand the "m" word. but since the coast is clear,can I just say it once? (Filtered voice) fine. Murder. Oh, don't forget to changethe locks on my armoire,just in case. Did I hear right thatyou fell asleep in a meeting? Yeah, but, uh, it was kind ofa power move, you know? Okay, you know how importantthis christian siriano meetingis, right? We're competing with "vogue,""bazaar" and "elle" to get his designsin the september issue. He's saidhe's only doing one. Seriously? so he's kind of a diva. I need you at your best,daniel. And look at you. You're all linty. Here. I noticedyou were linty, too. Oh, betty,you don't have to-- oh, don't worry about it. You know I don't mind. So, uh, daniel,that thing I wantedto ask you about earlier-- it's about renee. I mean, I don't know muchabout her, daniel, other than she's crazy about you. What time is that, uh,siriano meeting? Oh, don't worry about it. You've got plenty of time. But seriously, daniel, I mean,how much do youreally know about her? You guys have beenmoving so fast. Okay. I'm lint-free. Thanks. Are you okay?Great. Uh, you know, you never reallytalk about henry anymore. How's--how's he doing? Fine, I guess. Uh, I don'tget to see him that often, what with all the work this week. It's almost like you'remy boyfriend now. (Laughs) oh, hi, christian. Hi, christian. Amanda, um, what would you doif someone had a crush on you, and it started to affectyour ability to do work? Oh, my god. I knew it. Someone has a crush on me. Is it nick pepper? Because he's beenacting really weirdever since we made outthat one time. No, not someonewith a crush on you. Som-someonewith a crush on me. Oh. I get it. Yeah. And I am mostly over you,but I do have a rulethat if I date someone, I get to think about themin the shower sometimes. I'm talking about betty. Wait, you think bettyhas a crush on you? (Gasps) although she ison the rocks with that hot accountantof hers. I heard they werefighting this morning. Wait, they're fighting? Why? Yawn. More baby mama drama. I guess the girlhe got all preg-nasty is waitin' aroundto pop it out, so now triple chinsis into you. What am I gonna do? Daniel,I will tell you this-- when you're lettingsomeone down, it helps to besensitive to their feelings. You weren't alwaysthat way with me. Oh, amanda,I'm sorry. I-I-- anyway. I just always thoughtshe'd end up with that guy gio. He's so patheticallyinto her, always up heredelivering her sandwiches. And give betty enough food,it's just a matter of time before she falls in love. Thanks, amanda. What was thatabout gio and betty? Nothing. He's justtotally in love with her. Oops. You could do better. Wait, this is allabout gina gambarro? Oh, you should've seen herwith her designer earrinand her gucci belt. There wasn't an inch of her thatwasn't covered in brand names. Okay, hilda, pleasedon't tell justin I said this, but none of this stuffactually means anything. Ay, look, all I knowis that as I'm sitting there and she's telling meabout her great life, I'm looking aroundat our little houseand my stupid salonand I'm thinking, what do I haveto show for myself? So gina marriedsome guy for money. So what? You have a wonderful son,a family that loves you. You should notbe jealous of her. She should be jealous of you. That's what I said. That's why I'm here-- to make her jealous. Hilda, this is not healthy. (Sighs) you know, you're oneto talk about jealousy, what with charlie and henryand henry and gio. Oh, come on. That is totally different. Oh, that's right. You still won't tell henrythat you're friends with giobecause that's healthy. you know what? I have a lot of work to do. Bye. (lowers voice) christina, pleasetell me you found something. Betty,wilhelmina was going on about renee and--and locked drawers, so I took a knife and I brokein, and now I need you here. Wait, wait. Slow down. What? Wilhelmina and marchave gone out, and I need helpto go through all these files. There's just too many of them. Why? What's in there? Evidence. You see, wilhelminawas talking about renee, and then she mentionedthe "m" word. (Gasps) the "m" word? Wait, there are a lot of wordsthat start with "M." Murder! hey, henry. What can I do for you? You can stay away from betty. Excuse me? I only havefour weeks left with her. I don't need to be hearingthat you're always around with some crush. "Crush"? I don't know whereyou're getting that from. Just stay away from her,got it? Oh, I see. You wanna fit. All right. Well, let's get it over with. What? Wait.That's not what I meant. It wasn't?No. 'Cause in my neighborhood, when a guy says what you just said, it means he wants a fight. I'll even let youhave the first punch. I'm not gonna hit you. It'll make you feel better. Go ahead. Take a swing, like this. Son of a bitch! I'm sorry. Oh, god. Man, you can hit. I thought you were gonna hit me. Well, I wasn'T. I was just trying to scare you off. I didn't think you were gonna actually hit me. Yeah, neither did I. Here.Put that on there. Sit--sit down. So what's up, henry? Are you really mad at me, or... is this about something else? I'm stuck. I try to be a good boyfriend, and I end up not being the dad I want to be, and I try to be a good father,and I end up hurting betty. I'm just... scared I'm gonna lose her. You know,the one thing I don't get is, if you have four weeks left with her, then what the hell are you doing wasting your time here with me? Henry did what to you? henry punched gio. Really? Good for him. well,what did you do to deserve it? Well, I'm just saying. But look, gio,I'm really busy. I can't talk right now.Can I call you back? ugh. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell henry about gio. I knew something like this would happen. This'll take your mind off it. Come and see the dirt that wilhelmina's got on all these people-- madonna, trent lott,george clooney! Oh, renee's got to be in here somewhere. Ryan seacrest? I don't know why she's sittin' on that. Someone should take him down. What's this? "Rhonda slater." You think maybe they're related? Rhonda--that is renee's real name. Oh, my gosh.Here, here, here. There's a lot of stuff here. Hey, look at this."Stony brook professor dies in fire." Renee was talking to wilhelmina about stony brook. "Professor greg larson died in a house fire on saturday.Arson is suspected." His name is larson,and he died of arson. Unfortunate.It's a picture of renee with professor larson. Ooh. They were lovers.This is gettin' good. nina, I didn't realizeyou'd be coming along, too. Well, darling,the show has me keeping an eye on christian. Where is he, by the way? Fashionably late? Oh, he loves to make an entrance. Winning this contest has really gone to his head. The house of siriano has arrived. Worship me, bitches. Hi, mr. Siriano.Daniel meade. On behalf of "mode,"I'd like to sayhow fierce it isto have you here. Oh, okay, but no one uses that word around me. It's ov. Allow me to apologize for my brother. He didn't know. Hello, ferosha. You're certainly a hot tranny mess,minus the mess, of course. Oh, thanks, I think. Oh, but this placeis a bit boring. Models... work it. You know what couldgive it some drama? What the hell's going on here, daniel? Uh, nothing's going on. We're just kind of in the mile of a meeting here, sweetie. Yeah, I see this. Are these your whores?What? Is this your slut?No. And after everything we've been through, I will not lose you without a fight. Actually, that works. So renee had an affair with her professor. Here, look. What's this? Looks like commitment papers. For a gay wedding.Renee's a lesbian. christina.For a mental institution. Look. "renee slater...involuntarily hospitalized...six years." I have never been so... what the hell is the matter with you? I had to do something to get your attention, daniel. You have been avoiding me. I have called and called,but that betty won't let me through. I have been in meetings. Yeah, with beautiful women.You're surrounded by them. I know your history, daniel. how many times do I have to tell you,there are no other women? there better not be,or I swear to god,I will kill you! Sometimes there's no other word--fierce. look, you tried to warn me. I'm just afraid renee might hurt someone. Oh, daniel,I'm so relieved you called. It must have been such a hard decision for you to make. call dr. Remus. I think daniel will help the doctor over his commitment issues. ?????????????? Didn't you say the other day that she flipped out when you tried to light a candle? I did. One sister's a pyro,the other one's a psycho-- real winnersin this family, eh? All right. Okay, okay, okay. So renee has an affair with professor larson, he dies in a fire,and then she is hospitalized for being a jealous pyromaniac. Renee murdered her boyfriend. Daniel. Hello, "mode" magazine. Amanda, it's betty.I need to talk to daniel. Okay, betty.What is this regarding? Amanda, quit screwing around.It's betty suarez. Oh, that is so weird. We have a girl who works herewith, like,the exact same name. You sound much prettier, though. Look, daniel isn't answering his cell phone. I know he's supposed to be in that meeting with christian siriano, but I really need to talk to him. I think that meeting may have ended. What? Daniel already went home. Oh, no. I scheduled him to go home and take a nap. He probably turned his cell phone off. And he's probably exhausted from that huge fight he had with his girlfriend in the middle of the meeting. What fight? Well, everyone's talking about it. And you know what? I am all for some boyfriend stalking. I mean, who isn't? But that woman was...crazy oh, no. I think renee went off the deep end. I have to go find daniel. sorry I took so long,and, gina, I have to apologize for that outfit this morning. I usually dress down for work. I don't want to intimidate the clientele. It's a little flashy for me. Is it? I have so many clothes like this, I guess I just don't notice. Shouldn't we get started? You can put my pradas anywhere. this shoe doesn't look right. Oh, you know those luxury brands. Everything's handmade, so it's unique, like a snowflake. This isn't a snowflake. It's a snow-fake. Excuse me?This is prada. This is nada. You are pathetic,with your fake-ass hair and your fake-ass clothes. I bet you're not even married. Oh, I am so married. He's out parking the 5 seriesright now. Then he isn't a doctor. Oh, he's a doctor all right. Look.That says "chiropractor." That's not even a real doctor. Sorry I took so long. It's, uh, hard to finda space around here. Honey, i want to leave.But I just found a space. Yeah, why rush off? You and dr. Chiropractorjust got here. Please? I'll do whatever makes you happy. if you get your kicks makin' my wife feel lousy,then I'm sorry. Your life must be pretty sad. renee is,among other things, a borderline personality. Without medication,she'll fixate on a personand become extremely jealous if she thinks she's losing her hold on them. That can manifest itself with violence, specifically,the setting of fires. And you're saying she killed this guy she was seeing--larson. Well, it's a bitmore complicated than that. With my father's intervention,we were able to get renee the help she neededand keep the good slater nameout of the paper. I'm sorry.It's just, I can't believerenee would want to kill me. Well, technically you're right. Renee focuses her angeron a "gatekeeper"-- someone she thinksis keeping her from her lover. Yes, yes, distinctions. What's important is we get renee back into the asylum where she belongs. Wait. What--what did you mean,"trying to keep herfrom her lover"? Well, in larson's case,renee was convinced his secretary wasin love with him, so renee started a fire,hoping to trap her. That larson got caught in itwas just bad luck. As long as she's not worried about another woman, you're fine. Oh, my god. hello? Daniel! Daniel, it's betty.The door is open. Daniel? I wanted to have a specl evening with daniel, but once again,here you are, betty, getting in between us...just like you've been doingall along. Daniel's mine, betty... and I'm not gonna let you have him. Renee, th-this is all a-a terrible misunderstanding. I see how you look at him,how you talk to him. No. No, no. No, I-I talk to him like this,"hi, daniel. It's betty." See? That's normal. Then why are you doing everythingto keep him away from me? You answer his phone. Betty,you control his appointments. I'm his assistant.That is what assistants do. He sleeps  with his assistants! renee,I have a boyfriend-- henry--who I love very, very much. Then why are you spendingall of your days and all of your nights at work with my boyfriend? Uh, maybe because it's, uh,it's a really busy time, or, uh, maybe there are some things that I don't wanna talkto henry about. So you're lying to him?You're a liar. No. No.Henry is leaving for tucson, so I don't really want him to know about gio. Gio? Who's gio?He's this other guy. Henry's a little jealous of him. He punched him.It's complicated. So you have two guys.Isn't that enough? hello?Daniel, it's betty! I'm in your apartment. Renee's crazy.She's trying to kill me! Help me! Hurry! betty.Betty, are you still there? Are you all right? she's got bettyat my apartment. I hope you know, I prayed this day would never come,daniel. I don't care what you have to do,you get us there faster. I really hopeit doesn't come to this, but I know some very good people who would love  to be your assistant... you know,if we're too late. I swear to you,I don't want daniel.
