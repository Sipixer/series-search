### $$$ You Will Be My Prot. But That's Marc's Job. And Now It's Yours. Stuart, What Are You Doing Here? What's Wrong? I Think He's Doing Drugs Again. What? I Was On That Trip With You In Paris. I Remember You Drooling All Over His Mother. Your Son's Grandparents In France Filed A Claim For Custody. I Want To Stay With My Father. I've Made A Decision. Tonight We Are Welcoming Back, As Editor-In-Chief Of "Mode," Daniel Meade. Don't Forget, I Still Own A Third Of This Company. You Would Be Nothing Without That Baby. You Can't Push Me Aside. Um, Is That Light Really Necessary? Sorry, Miss Suarez. That's Okay. Believe Me. No One Wants To Know What Happened To Christina More Than I Do. About That-- Do You Have Any Idea Where Mr. Meade Was Last Night? Um... Do I Know Where <I>Daniel</I> Was Last Night? *** Hi, Dad. Morning, Sweetheart. Are We Gonna Do This Every Morning? Hey, I Miss You At Breakfast, But I'm Sure You're Having A Great Breakfast In Your Own Apartment. (Mouth Full) Mmm. It's Great. I Can't Help It. I Still Worry About You, By Yourself In The Big City. You Think You Have Enough Locks On Your Door? (Normal Voice) I Have Plenty. And I Grew Up In The Big City, Remember? There's No Need To Be So Protective Of--My Umbrella. Why Would I Be Protective Of Your Umbrella? No, I Left My Umbrella Outside My Apartment, And Now It's Gone. Amor, You're Too Trusting. You Leave Your Umbrella Outside Your Apartment, People Will Steal It. I'm Sure Somebody Just Borrowed It. My Neighbors Are Really Nice. It Sounds A Lot Like Your Bike In The Seventh Grade. Okay, Those Guys Totally Said That They Would Bring It Back, And It's Fine If Someone Borrowed My Umbrella, 'Cause I Don't Need It Today Anyway. You Look Different. I'm Wet. Big Improvement. Betty. Good Morning, Daniels. What Is Popping, Shorty? Super Tight. I Am Outtie Five, 'Kay? (Chuckles) Everyone At School Listens To Hip-Hop, So He's Sort Of Been Studying Up. Oh, Well, He Is A Fast Learner. Uh-Huh. All Right, Daniel, Your First Day Back At "Mode"-- Schedule... Thank You. Mail. Oh, That's It? Yep, The Rest Of It Got Forwarded To Alexis, But I'm On It. Don't Worry. Oh, And I Also Thought That I Would Go Do A Dry Cleaning Run For You Since You're Off The Tracksuits. Yay! Great. Oh. Uh, Can You Have My Raincoat Dry-Cleaned While You're At It? (Coughs) Hello, Dusty. Oh, And I Was Supposed To Get My Mom Home Last Night, But I Ended Up Leaving The Party Early, So If Anyone Asks, You Can Just Say, Uh, We Were, Uh, Here Late Packing Up At "Player" Magazine. But We Weren't At "Player." Oh, I Know. I Just Thought It Was The Simplest Explanation. Well, Why Don't You Just Say Where You Really Were? Wouldn't That Be Simpler? Because I Would... Because It's Not A Big Deal. (Claps Hands) People! I Have An Announcement To Make! This Is Urgent! I Have Important News! Wilhelmina Slater Is In The Hospital. (Gasps) It's Okay. She's Only There Because Last Night Her Surrogate, Christina, Fell Down The Stairs And Is Unconscious. (Gasps) What? Don't Worry. The Baby And Wilhelmina Are Fine. Marc! What About Christina? I'm Sure That She's-- You Know What? I Didn't Ask. (Whispers) Christina... (Normal Voice) Hi. It's Betty. Hey, Betty. Are You All Right? What Happened? I Don't Remember. It's--It's A Bit Fuzzy. I Was Leaving The Party. I'd Had An Awful Time. And... I Was At The Top Of The Stairs, And... And--And Then Someone Pushed Me. What? (Large Cat Growls) Mama...??? Rumors Are Swirling Ever Since The Surrogate... (Woman Screams) Carrying Wilhelmina Slater And Bradford Meade's Latent Love Child Fell Down The Stairs. Or Was She <I>Pushed?</I> With Meade In The Balance, Everyone Wants To Know Who Could Have Done Such A Thing-- The Millionaire Playboy, The Tranny C.E.O., The Angry Matriarch Acquitted Of Murder Or Any One Or Wilhelmina's Many Close Frenemies? La Slater Lost No Time In Trying To Help Authorities Find The Culprit. I Will Not Rest Until The Person Who Threatened The Life Of My Unborn Child... (Whispers) And Others. And Others Is Brought To Justice. So I'm Offering A Reward Of $100,000 To Anyone With Information Leading To The Apprehension Of This Monster. This Is A Huge Opportunity. The More They Talk About This, The Less They Talk About The Poor Sales Of My First Issue Of "Mode." (Turns Of Tv) Still, Willie,Doesn't It Worry You A Little, This Whole Situation? Well, Of Course I'm Worried, Marc, But When Someone Gives You Chintz, You Can Do Two Things-- "A," Whine About The Fact That It's An Upholstery Fabric Or "B," Turn It Into A Fabulous Bolero Jacket. Okay, You're A Diabolical Fashion Genius, And I'm Delighted To Be Your First Assistant Again, But Your Baby... And Others Are In The Hospital. I-I-I-I Know They're Okay, But... Marc, You're Right. At The End Of The Day, It's About My Child. Now We'll Have To Make Sure The Press Knows That. We Need Speeches, Vigils, Long Nights At The Hospital With Our Scottish Rent-A-Womb. We'll Have To Make Sure They Don't Forget The Real Victim Here. The Baby. Me. You. (Headset Beeps) Hello. "Mode" Magazine. You'll Have To Call Back. (Beep) Detective Averaimo. I'm Here To Question People About-- I Did It. Excuse Me? And Now You Have To Interrogate Me For, Like, Hours And Hours, And I Do Not Break Easy. (Lowered Voice) I Am Totally Easy. Detective Averaimo, Betty Suarez. We're Gonna Set You Up In The Conference Room. (Normal Voice) Oh, But I'm Guilty. Where Are You Going? Just So You Know, The Victim, Christina Mckinney, Is My Best Friend. Don't Worry, Miss Suarez, We're Taking This Case Very Seriously. The Attempted Murder Of A Woman And Her Unborn Child... Well, If There's Anything Else That I Can Do For You, Please Just Let Me Know. Yeah, Well, You Can Start By Answering A Few Questions. Um, Is That Light Really Necessary? Sorry, Miss Suarez. Do I Know... Where Daniel Was Last Night? Um... You Know, After The Party. I'm Not Really Sure. You See, He Sort Of Asked Me To Say He Was Working Late. If Anyone, You Know, Asked. He Asked You To Lie? Uh... No, No. Uh, Not A Lie. More Of A Small Untruth. (Cell Phone Ringing) Excuse Me. No. I Think I Just Found A Very Promising Lead. He Said "Very Promising Lead," And Then He Circled And Underlined Daniel's Name. It's All My Fault. Speaking Of Which, I've Been Watching A Lot Of Cop Shows Lately, And That Mariska Hargitay Wears Some Amazing Pantsuits. I'm Just Trying To Keep Things Upbeat. Sweetheart, I'm Sure If He Circled And Underlined Daniel's Name, The Detective Had A Pretty Good Reason. Dad, He Only Thinks Daniel's Guilty Because Of Something I Said. It's Not Like Daniel Could Ever Do Something Like That. Well, If Daniel's Innocent, Then He Has Nothing To Worry About, Right? Right. You're Right. I'm Worrying About Nothing. I Better Get Going. Trains Take Forever To Come After 9:00. Okay. Thank You For The Italian Burgers. All Right. Bye. You're Welcome. Let Us Know What Happens. Okay. (Lowered Voice) Hi. Sorry I Missed Supper. I'm Sure You Were Busy. Hey. Listen. We Need To Talk About Me And Coach, Okay? You're The Only One Who Knows, And I Know You're Still Mad At Me. Hilda, I'm Not Mad. I Was Just Surprised Yesterday. I Never Thought You Were The Type Of Person Who'd Do Something Like This. Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait. Wait A Minute. I'm The Same Person. I'm Your Sister. Have A Little Faith. Tony's Marriage Isn't Working, Okay? He Wants To Be With Me. But Getting Out Of A Situation Like That Is A Little Bit Complicated, So That's Why We Were Wondering If Maybe We Could Just <I>Borrow</I> Your Apartment. What? Are You Crazy? No, Hilda. I'm Not Gonna Let You Turn My Apartment Into Some Sort Of Sex Den. Shh. It's Not About Sex. It's About Love. Fine. Then Some Sort Of Love Den. If It Was Just About That, Then We Could Do It In His Car. But That Is No Place To Talk About Whether Or Not We Have A Future Together. Betty, I'm Trying To Figure This Thing Out With Him, You Know? And All We Need Is A Place To Talk. Just Talk. I Promise. I Love You. Thank You, <I>Mami.</I> Well, Before You Talk To Daniel, Could You At Least Handcuff Me? Daniel, I Have To Tell You Something. I Meant To Tell You Yesterday, But I Thought I Should Do It In Person. You See, I Sort Of Might Have Maybe Admitted To The Police That You Asked Me To Lie About Where You Were The Night Of The Party. Wait. Why Would You Do That? I Don't Know! I Am Not A Very Good Liar, And I Didn't Think It Was That Big Of A Deal, And Then He-- Mr. Meade, You Got A Minute? I Was Wondering About Something I Noticed In Your Office. Are These Your Sneakers? Yeah. Uh, Those Are Actually-- They're Bapes. They're... (Clears Throat) One-Of-A-Kind. Nigo Hand-Molded The Soles For Me And Everything. Fancy. Size 11, Huh? Mm-Hmm. I'm Afraid You're Under Arrest. What? Wait. What? The Tread Marks Here Match The Size 11 Shoe Printswe Found In The Stairwell Where Miss Mckinney Was Pushed. Betty, Call My Lawyer. *(Grunts)Um, Right. Okay, I Will. -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://Www.Ragbear.Com==- ³óÅ®±´µÙ µÚÈý¼¾ µÚ3¼¯ -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é==- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£ºÃ»±»Ò§ËÀµÄÂ¬±ó</font> (Claire) $200,000 Bail-- That Almost Seems Cheap. (Alexis) Here Comes The Press. Come On, Guys. Has Anyone Talked To Daniel Jr.? I Don't Want Him To See His Father Like This. I've Already Handled It. I Told Him It's A Meade Thing. See, Grandma Was In Jail Before, And Aunt Alexis May Be In Jail Next. Seriously, Mom. We Have To Come Up With A Plan. I Think Somebody's Framing Daniel, And I Wouldn't Put It Past Wilhelmina. (Betty) Let's Go. (Claire) Thank You, Betty. (Alexis) We Have Nothing To Say At This Time. Thank You. (Claire) Thank You. What The... (Camera Shutters Clicking) Oh. (Woman) Wilhelmina! Surrogate! (Man) Right Over Here. (Woman) Surrogate, Pull The Bandage Down. You're Horrible. Why, Because I Care About The Welfare Of My Unborn Child? (Loudly) That's Right. I Care About The Welfare Of My Poor, Unborn Child. (Man) Good. One More Shot. Because You Are Using Me And The Baby As Some Kind Of Prop For A P.R. Stunt. Ugh. This Pregnancy Has Just Made You Hysterical. Oh. Believe Me. I Understand. It's... (Whispers) Hormones. (Normal Voice) You Just Need A Drink Of Water. Nurse? Nurse, My--My Surrogate Needs Some Water. She's--She's Suffered So Much Already. Please. Won't Anyone Help Me? Can Someone Just Give Her Some Water? All Right! (Gasps) Daniel, Look. I Know This Is My Fault, And I Really Want To Help You Get Out Of It, But You Did Tell Me To Lie About Where You Were Last Night. I Know. It's Complicated. More Complicated Than Attempted Murder? Look, You Just Gotta Believe Me, Betty. You Know Me. I Didn't Push Christina. But Beyond That, The Less I Say, The Better. I Promised Betty We'd Keep It Clean In Here. Oh, That's Too Bad. I'm Feeling Dirty. Coach, What Did I Just Say? Mmm. Seriously, I'm Dirty. Water's Out At Work. Thank You Very Much, New York City Public School System. (Sniffs) Yeah, I Kind Of Need A Shower. Okay, Well, Now I Miss The Sexy Talk. Do You Want To Just Take A Shower Here? Oh. (Chuckles) I'll Go Get Some Ice Cream, And Then When I Come Back, We Can Talk. Talk? Mm-Hmm. When I Say "Talk," I Actually Mean Talk. Oh, Yeah. No. No. I Know Exactly What You Mean. (Laughs) Mm. I'll Be Back. All Right. All Clean, Sexy Ma--Aah! Coach? Papi. (Gasps) Tony. Hilda. Papi, What Are You Doing Here? I-I Was Worried About Betty. I Came To Install Locks. Oh, What'd You Get, Schlage Locks? No, Kwikset. Oh, Yeah, Those Are Good. You're Married? Papi--Papi, It's--It's Not What You Think. I Think I Should Go. I Don't Know Why Daniel Won't Tell Me Where He Was, But I Just Don't Think That He's Capable Of Doing Something Like This. I Mean, It's My Fault He's In This Situation. I Have To Prove That He's Innocent, And You Can Help Me. Well, What Can I Do? I Mean, I've Already Talked To The Police. I Know, But Maybe There's Something That You Forgot Or Something That You Didn't Fully Explain That Could Help Us Find Who Really Pushed You. I... Never Got Around To Telling You What Happened With Stuart. What Happened With Stuart? I S-Saw Him On The Day Of The Party, And... We Fought. You Used Me. You Just Wanted The Money To Buy Drugs. Christina-- Just Get Your Hands Off Me! I'm This Close To Calling Immigration And Having You Deported. (Chuckles) Oh, My God. Christina. Everyone's So Fixated On Who Wants Revenge On Wilhelmina, Nobody's Talking About Who Hates <I>You.</I> I'm Sorry. That Came Out Wrong. What Did The Police Say About Stuart? I Haven't Exactly Told Them About It. (Gasps) (Sighs) God, Betty. This Has Just Been So Awful. I Mean, Do You Think That Stuart Could... Really Have Done This To Me? I Don't Know. But You Can't Keep Something Like This From The Police. Christina, You Have To Tell Them The Truth. I Know. ?? Stuart. Hi. What Are You Doing Here? Well, I Heard Christina Was In The Hospital. I Had To Come And See That She's Okay. Yeah, Uh, It's Just That, Um, They Don't Really Want Anyone In There Who Might Upset Her. She Told You About The Fight, Huh? Nope. Maybe. What Size Shoes Do You Wear? Why? No Reason. Size 14. The Kids At School Used To Call Me "Big Foot." It Was Humiliating. Now Do You Want To Tell Me Why You Need To Know That? Well, The Person Who Pushed Christina Down The Stairs Wore A Size 11. Do You Think I Did It? It Breaks My Heart That You Think I'm Even Capable Of Hurting Christina. I Love Her. Well, What Do You Expect, Stuart? She Gave Up A Lot For You, To Save Your Life, And Now You're Doing Drugs Again? I'm In Pain. The Treatment That Christina Paid For-- It Didn't Work. There's No Cure, So I'm Gonna Die, Okay? I'm Sorry. Uh... I Had No Idea. Are You Going To Tell Her? After What Christina's Done For Me, To Tell Her It Was All For Nothing, How Am I Gonna Do That? After All She's Done For You, She Deserves To Know. This Didn't Work In High School. Why Would It Work Now? What, Are You Stalking Me? A Married Man, Hilda? I Thought You Were Better Than This. Said The Guy Who Had An Affair With Our Mom. No, That Was Totally Differe. Oh, Right, Because You're A Guy, And You Got That Whole Latino Macho Thing Happening. Don't Make This About That. This Is About You. You'd Never Say Anything Like This To Betty. Maybe Because Betty Wouldn't Do Something Like This. Good Afternoon. Hi. I'm Betty Suarez. I'm Daniel Meade's Assistant. I Need The Security Tapes From Two Nights Ago. You Want The Security Tapes, Too? Like, I Said, I Work For Daniel Meade, As In Meade Publications. The Guy They Arrested For Pushing That Pregnant Lady? That's The One. That's Crazy. You Work For A Murderer. Ah. Attempted Murderer, And He Didn't Do It, And You Work For Him, Too. Wow. I Work For A Murderer. I Hadn't Considered That. Right, So If You Give Me The Tapes, And We Can Prove He's Innocent, Then We Won't Work For A Murderer. I Can't Do It. The Morning After Your Boss Tried To Kill That Poor Pregnant Lady, The Tapes Were Gone. What? Well, Do You Know Who Took 'Em? I'll Tell You What I Told The Police And That Little Blonde Girl. Okay. I Have No Idea. Wait. What Little Blonde Girl? So I Asked About The Tapes. So What? I Am Not Splitting Wilhelmina's Reward Money With You. Amanda, I Don't Care About The Reward. I Just Need To Help Daniel. Look, You Know He's Innocent, Too. I Do. Look, Don't Judge Me, Okay? Not That You Ever Really Could In... That. But I Really, Really Need That Reward Money. I'm Having A Little Bit Of A Cash Flow Problem, And I May Or May Not Have Maxed Out A Few Credit Cards. How Many? Like... (Mumbles) 15. 15? (Normal Voice) Shh. I Like Nice Things, Okay? So What? Anyway, I'm Not Talking To My Parents Now, So I'm Kind Of On My Own With This, Not That You'd Care. No, Of Course I Care. Look, Amanda, You Were There The Night Christina Got Pushed, So Why Don't You Just Tell Me What You Remember? Well, It Was Late. That's When I Usually Trythe Credit Card Company's Indian Call Centers. They Are So Much Nicer. Seriously, I Don't Know Why You're Making Such A Big Deal Out Of This, Rahul. Is It A Crime To Purchase Things You Can't Pay For? No. Amanda, Have You Seen The Mustard? I Need It For My Big, Fat Sandwich, Which I'm Always, Like, Eating Around You And Making A Total Mess Of Myself. Y Know. You Always Are, Right? Mm-Hmm. I Do Not Always Eat Sandwiches, And I Wasn't Even There. I'm Just Saying, It Really Does Feel That Way Sometimes. So Anyway, I Was Back At My Desk... Okay, If I Pay My Bill, Then I Can't Pay My Rent, And If I Can't Pay My Rent, Then Where Will You Send My Bill? See? This Is Actually All For You. (High-Pitched Scream) (Gasps) Christina? I Peered Around The Corner, But It Wasn't A Woman. Well, It Was Marc. You Will Rue The Day, Wilhelmina Slater, That You Decided To Cross Marc St. James. I Know All Of Your Plans, And I Will Make You Pay! Actually, I Did Push Christina The Other Night. (Both) What? Oh, It's Not What You Think. God, You People Jump To Conclusions. And You... You'd Think Someone With Your Skin Tone Would Be A Little More Sensitive To Prejudice. Marc, Don't Change The Subject. You Just Said You Pushed Christina, And Amanda Said She Saw You Yelling At Wilhelmina That Night. Oh. That. Well, That Really Wasn't Anything. Then Why Are You Hiding It? I'm Not Hiding It. I Just Don't Want Anyone To Know About It. Marc, That's The Same Thing. Fine! Do You Want To Know What I Was Doing? I'll Show You. (Gasp) You Killed Wilhelmina, And You Stuffed Her! But You Put Her In Tahari? Amanda, It's A Wilhelmina Doll. (Marc) It's A Wilhelmina Mannequin. She Had It Made For Dress Fittings. Now I'm Not Proud Of This, And I Will Deny It If Asked, But Sometimes When I'm Angry At Her, I Will Pull Out The Mannequin Late At Night And... Yell At It. You Will Rue The Day, Wilhelmina Slater, That You Decided To Cross Marc St. James. I Know All Of Your Plans, And I Will Make You Pay. You Slapped Her? Hard Core. Well, I Apologized Afterwards. I Mean, I Know She's Not Real, But She Still Scares Me A Little. Marc, You Still Haven't Explained Exactly Why You Were Angry At Wilhelmina. Oh, I Don't Know. Maybe Because I've Been Loyal To Her For Years, And Then In A Matter Of Days, She Hires This Little Mayan Fireplug And Promotes Her Above Me? Marc, That Again? You May Think That I Lick Willie's Boots Because I Like It, And I Do A Little--They're Fancy-- But There Is A Reason Why I Put Myself Through It. You're Not The Only One Who Wants To Get Ahead In The Magazine World. I Have Dreams, Too. Wow. You Never Mentioned That. Anyway, I Was A Little Worked Up Yelling At The Wilhel-Mannequin, So I Just Wanted To Go Home... But Christina Was Blocking My Way. (Elevator Bell Dings) Excuse Me. (Claire) You. You're Carrying That Thing... For Her! Aah! So That's The Last Time I Saw Christina, With Claire, Who Seemed Pretty Pissed Off At Her Now That I Think About It. Oh, My God. Claire. She Had A Motive, An Opportunity-- Not To Mention, She Totally Murdered My Mom. Kind Of. (Betty) All Right, Mrs. Meade, If You Could Just Tell Us What You Remember. Just So You Know, If I Had Done It, I Would Never Let My Son Take The Blame. Oh, Something You Learned In Prison? There's Two Things They Always Tell You-- Do Your Own Time And Don't Trust The Popo. Mm. Okay. Uh, So What Exactly Were You Doing The Night Of The Launch Party? Well, You Probably Remember Us At The Party, Exchanging Our Usual Pleasantries. You Can't Push Me Aside. Don't You Ever Threaten My Children, Wilhelmina. You Have No Idea The Lengths I Will Go To Protect Them. You're Not Doing A Very Good Job Of Explaining How You're Innocent. Yes, Well, Wilhelmina Has A Way Of Getting Me Worked Up, And That Night, I Found Myself Needing A Little Something To Take The Edge Off. All Right, You Slipped Up. You Had A Drink. So What? That's The Thing. I Can't Have Just One Drink. I Screwed Up, Betty. Wilhelmina Slater. More Like Wilhelmina Slut-Er. Get It? Oh, That's Okay. I'm So Funny. Oh! God. Excuse Me. Oh. You. You're Carrying That Thing For Her! Oh! Hold It--Oh. Ooh. Oh, Mom. Yeah, Right Here On The Sofa. Oh, No. (Groans) Mother, Have You Been Drinking? Maybe. Well, T-The Last One Sort Of Ended Up All Over Me, Really. Thank You, Christina. Yeah. Oh. Thank You. My Mother Has Struggled With This One For A Long Time, But I Can't Really Blame Her. It's Been A Stressful Week For All Of Us. I Was Sort Of Dealing With My Own Problems That Night. You Mean Wilhelmina? Yeah. Wilhelmina? Yeah. Let Me Remind You Of My Position At This Company And Then All Of Yours Before I Say, This Doesn't Go Any Further Than... This... Room. (Gulps) Okay. (Gulps) That's Great. We Understand. I Work Very Hard To Look Poised... But Sometimes Things Slip Through The Cracks. (Betty) Oh, My God. What Did You Find? (Alexis) Facial Hair. (Amanda, Betty And Marc) Facial Hair? I'd Forgotten To Take My Estrogen. I Go To Great Lengths To Maintain The Illusionthat I Was Born A Woman, But I Wasn't. I'll Be Honest. I Didn't Even Notice Christina Leaving. I Guess She Must Have Snuck Out While I Was Helping My Mom. The Rest Of The Night Was Spent Trying To Hail A Taxi And Keep My Mom From Getting Sick On My Brand-New Donna Karan. Wow. I Never Knew Alexis Went Through That Or Claire Or You, Amanda, With Your Credit Cards. (Mouths Words) I Mean, You'd Think There Was An Easy Explanation For These Things, But There Just Isn't. I Know, But After Talking To Everyone, It Really Does Seem Like Daniel Did It. And I'm Genuinely Surprised. No, Daniel Is Innocent. I Know He Is. Maybe Wilhelmina Could Help Us Prove It. Prove What? Prove That Daniel's Innocent. (Whispers) Oh, I Didn't Understand That Part. Christina Was Standing Right Here. Okay, Guys. Go Ahead. Throw The Mannequin Down The Stairs. Hmm. I Don't Want To Be Critical Here, But We Can't Reenact This Crime With That Mannequin. It's Way Too Skinny. So True. We Need Something Heavy That Can Double As A Convincing Pregnant Woman. Guys, Don't Be Ridiculous. I'm Not Gonna Let You Throw Me Down The Stairs. Just Relax. You Won't Break Anything Unless You Tense Up. Marc, I Said Let Me Go! Aah! Are You Guys Crazy? You Could Have Killed Us. Great. Can You Have My Raincoat Dry-Cleaned While You're At It? (Coughs) Hello, Dusty. Oh, My God. Daniel's Coat. Dear, I Was Talking To Barbara Walters' People About Setting Up An Inter-- Well, I-- Everything All Right? Emotional Stress Is Not Good For The Baby. (Voice Breaking) Stuart Came To See Me. His Treatment Didn't Work. And He's Dying. Well, I Suppose That's The Danger Of Experimental Treatments. Can You Just Leave Me On My Own For A Little While? Please. Oh... What Did I Do? Daniel. Hi. I Was Just Looking For Some Paperwork. Nope. It's Not Here. Hey, I'm Glad I Found You. Look, I've Just Been Wanting To Tell You How Much Your Faith In Me Has Meant During This Whole Ordeal. Yeah. Of--Of Course. Something Wrong? No, Nothing's Wrong. Why Would Anything Be Wrong? I Don't Know, Just Kind Of The Way You Said, "Nothing's Wrong," It Kinda Like, You Know, Sounds Like There Is Something Wrong. Nope. Oh, I Gotta Go. Betty? (Gasps) Thank God You're Here. I Don't Know What To Do. Hilda's Having An Affair. Coach Diaz--He's Married. I Know. Wait. What? You Know? Dad! Enough With The Spanish. I Think Daniel Pushed Christina. What? I Found This In His Bag. It's A Security Tape From "Mode" The Night Christina Got Pushed. He Stole It. Do You Think He's Guilty? I Don't Know. I Don't-- I Don't Know What To Think. I Mean, I Spent The Entire Day Trying To Prove That He's Innocent, And All I Found Out Was That Everything Is More Complicated Than I Thought. Betty, This Is Why I Worry About You. I Know, Dad. I Know. You Think I'm Naive. I'm Too Trusting. Is It Really Naive To Want To Believe In People? I Mean, Look At Hilda. Okay, So She Made A Mistake. She's Still A Good Person. And I Would Say The Same Thing About Daniel Right Before I Found This. That's Not Being Naive, <I>Mija.</I> That's Faith. Have You Seen It? No. I Don't Want To Know If I'm Wrong About Daniel. What If You're Right? Ew, Daniel. This Is Dirty... And Awkward. But Why Would He Want To Hide That From The Police? It's Complicated. It's Not <I>That</I> Complicated, Daniel. I've Seen The Tape. Oh, God. Not The-- Yes, And I Saw It With My Dad. Okay, So... The Woman I Was With That Night, That Was Holly, The State Department Liaison Who's Been Helping Me With My Custody Problems? And You're Sleeping With Her? No, No. That--That Happened After She Started Helping Me. It Wasn't Like She Started Helping Me Because We Slept Together, But If It Ever Got Out, I Know That's What It Would Look Like. That's It? That's Why You Couldn't Say Anything? What, Are You Crazy? Daniel, You Were Arrested For Attempted Murder! Yeah, Which I Didn't Commit. Look, I Had To Believe They Were Gonna Find The Real Culprit Eventually. Besides, If They Ever Found Out Where I Really Was That Night, Holly Could Have Lost Her Job, I'd Lose Her Help And I Could Lose Daniel Jr. Forever. He's My Son, Betty. I'm Not Gonna Lose Him Now. I Won't. Oh, My God. Daniel, I Have Never Been More Happy To Find Out About One Of Your Sleazy Affairs. Oh! I Knew You Couldn't Have Pushed Christina. I Believed In You, And I Was Right. Mm! Thank You, Betty. Um, I'm--I'm Sorry To Do This Right Now. I-I'm Late To Pick Up D.J. Right. Okay. Yes. You Should Go. Would You Mind Giving That Coat Back To Alexis? What Do You Mean, Give It Back? She Borrowed It A Couple Days Ago. It Looks Better On Her Anyway. Alexis? I Know You Did It. I Don't Know What You're Talking About, Betty. Daniel's Coat. You Borrowed It. It Had Dust Fsom The Bottom Of The Steps Where Christina Fell. So I Got His Coat Dusty. So What? It Doesn't Mean Anything. What About Your Feet? Excuse M There Are A Lot Of Things You Can Change About Yourself, But Your Shoe Size Isn't One Of Them. Men's Size 11, Just Like Daniel's, Same As The Ones The Police Found At The Bottom Of The Stairs. You Pushed Christina, Alexis. What Do You Want? What You Did To Christina Was Horrible, But Then You Stole Daniel's Shoes And You Wore His Coat? You Framed Your Own Brother, Alexis. I-I Didn't Mean For That To Happen. I Swear. Yeah, Well, That's What It Looks Like. The Night Of The Party, Things Were Bad With Wilhelmina. I Know We've Had Our Differences, Wilhelmina, But We're Going To Have To Find A Way To Work Together. Oh, Spare Me, Alexis. You Stabbed Me In The Back. So Let Me Give You Fair Warning, My Freakishly Tall Girlfriend, You Will Never Be Rid Of Me Thanks To This Baby. I Know All Your Secrets, And When I Get My Chance, You'll Never See It Coming. (Alexis) I Was So Pissed Off That I Broke A Heel. Oh! Brand-New Sergio Rossis, Too. I Knew He Was My Size, So I Went To See If Daniel Might Have A Pair Of Shoes That Fit Me. Then I Saw The Facial Hair. And Right After That... I Know It's Not Right, But At That Moment, I Didn't See Christina. I Saw Someone Else. (Electricity Crackles) You'll Never Be Rid Of Me. She Was Right. As Long As Christina Was Carrying Her Baby, I Would Never Be Rid Of Her. My Mother Passed Out. So I Followed Christina Out Into The Hallway. And I Can't Explain It... But When I Saw Christina Then... All I Could Think Of Was Wilhelmina And Everything She's Put Our Family Through. I Didn't Think. I Just... I Ran To Her Afterward. I Made Sure She Was Still Alive... And Called 9-1-1. I Can't Justify What I Did. And Daniel--I Never, Ever Wanted That To Happen. It Was Insane. I Just Kept Telling Myself, "He's Innocent. It'll Go Away." Oh, God, Betty. If I Could Take It Back, I Would, But I Can't. What Do I Do? Well... No One Else Knows Yet. And I Haven't Told Danielbecause I Know You're A Good Person, Alexis. But Right Now, You're The Only Person Who Can Prove That.
