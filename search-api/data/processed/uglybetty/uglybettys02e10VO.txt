I have a proposition you might be interested in. Motion to terminate wilhelmina slater. All those in favor. (Daniel and alexis) aye. Did you come to clean out your office,wilhelmina? No,daniel. I came to clean out yours. "Slater." We're currently setting up our offices, And there are still positions available. All right. What is this guy's name? I don't know. Something lame,like gio. Tell me who you're dating. Henry from accounting. There. More. He got a girl pregnant. Wow. You are being stupid. I know you're leaving in five months, And i know that i'm gonna get my heart broken, But maybe it's worth it. So let me get this straight. Our father left a video for us. (Alexis) is this a new will? No,no. It's simply a personal message He recorded for the both of you A few weeks before he died. I'll wait outside. Thank you. He must've known he was sick. Well,we'll never know. Alexis,daniel,  i'm sick. Who knows how much time  i have left? Well,obviously,  if you're watching this, I didn't have a lot. Hopefully,you gave me  a proper send-Off. I thought it was nice. Shh. I didn't reveal  who i wanted To run meade publications  in my will, Because i wanted to explain  my decision to you. Is this thing on? (Sighs) typical. Yeah. (Coughs) Running a company  like this Requires a specific type  of leadership. You have to have confidence, Be able to smell blood  in the water. You need to possess  a killer instinct. So after long consideration,  i choose-- (Betty) mr. Meade-- Oh,i'm sorry. I didn't realize  you were in the m-- Oh! Ah,whoopsy-Daisy.  Sorry. Daniel sent me  to deliver this thing...  (coughing) And your assistant  wasn't there. I'm sorry. Come on,betty. It's fine. It's fine. Just  set the camera up and leave.  Okay. Yep,that's right. ±¾×öä»½ö¹©ñ§ï°½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾ Uh,can i get you  anything else? No.  Okay. (Coughs) come on. It is my desire that one  of you become the president And chief fiduciary officer  of meade publications. So i hope  you'll both understand When i tell you That i choose my d-- Is this thing even on? Yes,it's on. It's on. There you go. Wait,what-- What happened? Dad. Oh,learn to work stuff. It's pretty clear he was going to say,"my daughter." No,it's not. He was gonna say, "i choose my daniel." "My daniel?" Who says that? He did all the time. "My daniel this... my daniel that..." Obviously we're not going to be settling this right now. Tomorrow morning we're gonna talk to mom about the trial, Maybe she'll have an opinion on this. Fine. Until then, no one sits behind his desk. Agreed. Tell me again why we're stealing your father's chair. We're not stealing it. We're guarding it. Until we figure out who runs meade, No one sits in it. But couldn't alexis just get another chair And put that behind the desk and sit in that? No--She--That's not... whose side on you on? Yours. I'll guard the chair. The chair is life. The chair is everything. Look,i can run meade just as well as alexis. I can smell blood in the water. You know, i'm a good leader. Of course you are,daniel. There it is! I knew you took it! Run,betty. Come on. Run. Hurry! I'm going. I'm going. Out of my way. Excuse me. Protect that chair! Keep it-- Sorry. Would you grow up,daniel? Hey. Get out of there. That's notyours. You know it is. You get out of there. You get out. You get out. Why are you so strong? What,did they give you super strength When they installed your vagina? Guys,everyone is watching. Now i'm happy to guard the chair Until you talk to your mother and figure it out. Just so you know, They did give me super strength. Betty,you heard my dad call me "my daniel," right? Sure. Oh,the children are cranky today. Did you give them both a time-Out? Exhausting. Milady. Thank you. And mi-Other-Lady. Oh,thank you. Hmm. I have a big surprise for our date tomorrow night. Wear socks... 'Cause they're gonna get knocked off. Oh,a surprise! Oh,the last surprise i got on a date Was the wife knocking on the motel door. I know. He's so sweet. Every single saturday night We make an ice cream sundae bar and we watch old movies. Well,i can't tempt you and henry to come out With stuart and i to this movie premiere For which i have passes. (Gasps) "27 dresses." Shut up! I so want to see this movie. I love romantic comedies. And i love james marsden. I want to bake him naked and eat him for dessert. Okay,you and i have very different points of view Of romantic comedy. Yeah. But we couldn't go anyway. Henry and i are trying to do things That are just the two of us. He's leaving in 17 weeks and 4 days. Wait. Isn't this a leap year? (Gasps) 17 weeks and 5 days! I have to go tell him, give him a kiss! Go on. Go on. Wait! No,no,no. This is all wrong. You call this a cover,kiki? The goal is to make me look five years younger Than i say i am. Be prepared to work through lunch. Why aren't they working? Willie,a word. It's not that anyone minds being abused. It's just that they thought-- And i don't know where they got this-- That they were being paid to be abused. So this is about money? Well... In my day,we worked hard, and we were lucky if we got... (Raises voice) a cheese sandwich and a cup of bad coffee. You were a senator's daughter And went to boarding school in paris. (Normal voice) i've never realized What tiny features you have. Oh. People,i heard there's some grumblings about money. Well,this afternoon, i'm meeting with our investors, And i'm absolutely certain we will have our funding. Then,"slater"... will be a go. You didn't order enough paper clips. Calm down. You're hysterical. You're practically screaming like a woman. Why are you in charge of anything? There's,like, a thousands sticks Of glitter glue and no paper clips. You're gay,right? Only when it comes to you. I shouldn't have to ask the receptionist For a paper clip. Okay,slow down there, spanky. You,my friend, are not the only one Who needs paper clips. What? Metallics are back in this year. That is a misuse of company property. And that... is a misuse of hair gel. How much are you wearing? That's it. You just pissed off the pep. (Whimpers) no! I'm sorry,ma'am, But this thing is not allowed in the building. You can pick it up in the lobby on your way out. Will you walk him? (Chuckles) no. No! You guys are out of paper clips, But there's a butt-Load of glitter glue. I took some for my son. (Lowers voice) did that guy just check out my ass? How much does he make? Ugh,not enough to be worth it, But hey,you're starting to notice Guys check out your ass again. I can't even focus on guys right now. I gotta focus on opening up my salon. Hilda,i said you could make a few color copies, Not ransack the office supplies. No,no,no, they factor that in. Believe me, if i didn't take these, The books wouldn't line up at the end of the year. Look. Check it out. "Hilda's beautilities-- I give good hair." Ooh,that's a little smutty. You might get some of those guys in front of the liquor store. Hey,their money's good. Ay, betty,i got such a good feeling about this salon. When i heard that beauty school burned down And was selling a slightly damaged shampoo sink, I really felt like god was looking out for me. Well, you're gonna be amazing. Oh,and henry's coming by tomorrow With his "time life" books to install the sink. Ay, i still gotta get that thing home. Hey,do you think your little friend With the van could do it? Are you still hating him now or what? Who? Gio? No,we're fine. He'll be happy to do it. Investors! How could they have turned me down? That's not what they said. They just need a few days to think about it. Oh,that means "no." Don't be stupid. "Image problem." I don't have an image problem. Well,you have had some pretty bad press lately. Well,you were fired and pushed into your fianc?S grave. I don't know how to put a positive spin on that. Well,then we're screwed,marc. They're the only investors Willing to launch a new magazine, And they think i have an image problem. Well,then,we change your image. Come on. It's the media age. We can do it overnight. Britney spears shaves something or shows something Or shows something shaved, And it's around the world in seconds. Trust me,lady. I can make you mother teresa with better boobs. It's interesting. You only call me when you need something. When was the last time you went down To my deli and bought a sandwich? Well,gio,that's because every time i come in,you yell, "There she is--The eater." It's cute. It's our thing. Gio,you gotta let me pay you. I don't feel right. Just give my mom a haircut And don't tell her about her bald spot. Um,gio,you can just set the sink down over there. Henry's coming to install it. A man of many talents. Is there anything egg salad can't do? Why is henry egg salad? Because egg salad is a boring sandwich, And gio thinks that henry is boring. Oh,no,henry's not boring. No,look at all the cool stuff you guys do. I mean,your,um, saturday night sundae night. That sounds like fun. It is. It is so much fun. Every weekend, we have a theme topping. Like,last week,we were watching "walk the line"-- You know,about johnny cash-- So he chopped up cashews. (Laughs) It was fun. It was fun. And did you eat it with a reese witherspoon? (Laughs) That's funny. He's funny. Yeah,he's a riot. I'm just kidding, but come on. You and henry,have,like, what,four months left, And this is how you spend a saturday night? Okay,gio, what would you do? If i loved a girl, And i knew i had so little time left with her, Then every night would be a chance to make a memory. Believe me,if there was any ice cream involved, I would be eating it off her stomach. Sexy. Gross. And i'd take her out to montauk, You know, with a bottle of wine, And we'd build a fire and sleep on the beach. Or maybe we'd climb the fire escape To the rooftop of the blue note And listen to music. Maybe we'd just go out dancing. 'Cause,you know,you never feel closer to a woman Than when you're holding her. You know,like,mm, So close that you could feel her breath on your neck. Because love doesn't come around often, And i'd want to make every second count. Man,i love this song. Aw,whoo! Come on,betty. No. Gio. I don't want to dance. Mmm. We have to work. Hilda,we have to work. (Hilda) what? Come on. A little bit of dancing. Come on. Ready? One,two. One,two,mm,mm. There you go. You got it. You got it. (Laughs) oh,hey, you guys are good together. Yeah.

No,it's this,like-- I can't get this pipe to fit. Need some help there? What? No. I got it. Yeah,i see you've got your,um,"time life" books. Yep. Henry uses them all the time. He says they were his best friends growing up. I didn't say it like that. You know,i think where you're going wrong Is you didn't slip the trap nut and washer onto the tailpiece Before you attached the p-Trap. Yes,thank you. Henry,i think you should let gio do it. That p-Trap thingy sounds hard. Hilda,he says he can do it. Yes,i can. There. It's done. Okay. Henry! Uh,you okay? No,no. It's supposed to do that. It says so in the book. Surprise,surprise. The devil donates prada.

The bulls are giving me a wider berth. Okay,mom,we're really happy you're top dog there, But we really need to talk about your hearing. We're thinking you should plead T guilty by reason of insanity. Wait,we said i was gonna tell her that. Mom,hi. We need to sit down with the attorneys and-- Give me that. I'm talking to her. Are we really doing this again? Yes,we are.

Now your father is gone, And i may be gone for a very long time. You two are on your own now, And it is time to grow up. There is a business to be run. This is not the tree house you fought over When you were 12. Work it out. Daniel, let's get real. We both know who dad wanted. (Scoffs) we don't know that. The video got cut off. Then how do you propose we solve this? Lawyers? Arbitrators? What about what mom said? Grow up? That won't work. No. The way we settled the tree house. This is a billion-Dollar company,daniel. We're not gonna choose a president With a paintball war. Well,dad wanted someone with a killer instinct. Forget it. Why? Are you afraid i might win again, Like i did with the tree house? You're on. See what i did here? I mixed a little bit of prep With a little bit of gangsta, And i found an edge where there was none. I don't know. Can i really rock this look? Betty? Um,i like the color.

It will be nice to have someone around the house who's so handy. I mean,when we're not calling henry to--To fix things. Yeah. I'm out. I don't know,hilda. I think he's a little bit of a know-It-All.

As i saito her last night when i rushed to her side,i-- Oh! My hand! Oh,oh,it hurts. I barely-- Now she's going after my other hand. Betty,please. Why do y hate me? What did i ever do to you? Please,betty. Oh,god! Get the monster away from me. Cut. What the hell is going on here? Have you lost your mind, old woman? Did i not mention that "regis and kelly" called? And "the view." They want me. They all want me. Oh,i'm sorry,honey. This feud is huge, And i'm gonna milk it till it's dry. But you don't need this. Are you kidding? That "golden girls" money went right into the nickel slots. Roll it,sweetheart. Oh! Get her away from me! I think she's got a knife. Oh,no! My bunny got wounded. It's collateral damage. I'm sorry,betty. Ugh. So what does all of this mean? Well,essentially, alexis is my boss. I'm going up to my dad's office right now-- Uh,alexis' office-- To sign the contracts. Oh,i'm so sorry,daniel, but you know what? I think i remember your dad calling you "my daniel" once. It was at the christmas party, and... It's okay. No,it's just hard to admit he never trusted me. I guess he knew only alexis had his killer instinct. Oh,but you don't need a killer instinct to be a leader. What about martin luther king or jesus? I mean, you're not as good as them, But you're at least as good as alexis. Yeah,i bet i could run a fashion magazine At least as good as martin luther king. Probably not jesus. Willie,disaster. Jody called me this morning. No one's coming in. They've mutinied. There's no way to replace them Unless we hire children or use prison labor. "Slater's"dead,marc. Have a cup of tea. Dead? No. It's all i've got except for goohair And good clothes,and actually, you know,i'm doing okay. But what about you? How can you be so calm? You've got nothing. Because i've moved on to plan "b." I've been saving it foa rainy day. And by god,it's pouring. (Gasps) what is that? Do you remember after bradford died, I went off to grieve privately? Tell me,doctor, is it true what i' read, That sperm can be removed from a body Up to 48 hours after death and still be viable? Um,that is correct. Yes. Well,i wonder if there's a procedure You'd be willing to do for me. You mean that's... in your freezer? I put a pinkberry in there. It's our future,marc. If i can't marry into the meade family, I will give birth to an heir.
