(man) it's your mother's beloved dog halston. partial retrograde amnesia? the last thing alexis remembers is mom's birthday party two years ago. with alexis still in the hospital, i want to postpone the wedding. your father was a hero. ????? (justin) no, i'm not. it looks like we'll need an intern around the office for the next couple of weeks before school starts. oh, my god! and my dad's ill stuck in mexico. (ignacio) i killed ignacio suarez? ???? let me tell you something about this baby of yours. christina told me about charlie, that she cheated on me. charlie was the only reason we couldn't be together. i want to be with you, betty. henry,'re drunk. (slurs) and you're beautiful. henry, stop. look, this is not how i ever pictured us being together. you're drunk of... wine coolers. "melon and apricot." it's gross. you're right. i'm a terrible person. i had a cigarette, too. why didn't you tell me about charlie and that dentist? i... look, i've wanted to. i just... started thinking that maybe it wasn't the right thing to do. henry, there is a baby involved. which might not be mine. but maybe it is, and i-i can't get my heart broken again. it's like the whole world is telling us we shouldn't be together. we're like melon and apricot. look, i do want to be with you. i do, it's... it's just-- we don't know whose baby it is, and we just have to wait, and i can do that if you can. (daniel) wow. (amanda) yeah. that's it? those are the d.n.a. results. so, uh, h-how many times do you think we... alot, but just remember, if your dad's d.n.a. does match mine, we're only half brother and sister, which means if we did it, like, 20 times, it was only wrong ten. okay, that actually made sense to me. you are so my sister. oh, my god. i can't take it anymore.</i> (gasps) bradford's not my father! you're not my sister? kissing isn't weird at all. it's great. we're not related. we could kiss all we want, right? yeah, we can totally do this. nothing taboo here. (giggles) you know what? why don't we hop in-- daniel, no. i have unresolved issues with you. so just squeeze a boob, because i have to go. oh, my god. this is so humiliating. i've never done this before. try this. it's tomato juice, raw egg and a little bacon grease... a trick i learned in high school. hangover gone by third period. tastes as good as it sounds. sorry we didn't take your shoes off before you went to bed last night, but we could not untie those double knots. i worry about tripping. so you must be dying to call that bitch. charlie? honestly, i'm afraid to. i don't know what i'm gonna do when i hear her voice. i' never been this mad. this is you mad? yeah. i feel like a female orangutan when she's in estrous and a nondominant male tries to mount her. she just bares her fangs and attacks blindly. that story would be more effective if you compared yourself to the male orangutan, and if i knew what estrous was. you hungry? oh! oh. i'm glad you're not mad at me for spilling the beans. he had to find out somehow, right? yeah. so what ???? i don't know. wait, try not to think about it, which is easy, because i have so much to do for this benefit tonight. oh, please, don't talk to me about the black & white ball. i have been gluing crap onto these things for two weeks. glitter came out in my pee yesterday. yeah, but it's all for charity, and it's daniel's favorite event of the year. he gets to go up onstage and present that giant check thingy. yeah, men get excited about things like that, don't they? (bell tinkles) oh, yay! the sandwich guy! i got too excited, right? well, maybe. okay, chicken and cheese special on a baguette. no chicken, no cheese, no baguette. i just sold her a plate of lettuce for 7 bucks. yes, but that's her breakfast, lunch and dinner,</i> so really, it's a bargain. mm. could i please get the turkey sun-dried tomato on a baguette, please? yes! man, i knew you were an eater. oh. thank you... i guess. so you're new. what happened to robert? you know, i think he inherited money... or was arrested. oh. i don't know. there was a lawyer and cash involved. well, welcome. hey, betty. can you get me this for the, uh, benefit tonight? uh, okay, yes. thank you. daniel! the ibot motorized wheelchair? i thought you were supposed to be walking by today no, i still need therapy. i'm still in a lot of pain, betty. thanks. ok, i know that you feel really bad about this whole alexis thing... but do you think maybe your pain could be more emotional than physical? my leg isn't crying, betty. it's hurting. just get me the wheelchair, okay? okay, i'll just add it to my list. oh, and about the check. can you, um, make sure the check is big, but not so big it makes my head look small? okay. and it should be... (clears throat) blue or green. blue. got it. see, 'cause last year, it was beige, and in all the photos, i was kinda washed out. whatever you need. (telephone rings) daniel meade's office. fashion gives back-- once again, it's the "mode" black & white ball</i> benefiting new york children's hospital.</i> yes, the clothes will be fabulous</i> and the kids will be sick. unfortunately, this year, claire meade will not be able</i> to fulfill her usual hostess duties</i> as she's on the lam, which, i understand,</i> is what mario batali is serving as the main course.</i> but in the spirit of black & white, </i> the ball will be presided over by bradford meade</i> and fiancée wilhelmina slater. or should i say ex-fiancée? since apparently, the wedding has been postponed.</i> trouble in paradise? turn it off.</i> ugh. this is so humiliating. my closest friends in the world will be there tonight. can you imagine how happy this is gonna make them? oh! it's just a temporary setback. you'll still have the wedding in a few months. if bradford thinks he loves you now, he'll think he loves you then. the longer we wait, the more time bradford's spawn will have to talk him out of it. (sighs) i'm done, marc. it's over. now you listen to me, lady. the wilhelmina slater i know and occasionally wish i was does not throw in the towel just because the old man she's scamming has suddenly gone all soft for his tramnesiac daughter.</i> you're touching me. it was a risk. oh. i just didn't count on the father/daughter rebonding. i hate that love won out. well, maybe someone should remind daddy's little girl that she hates daddy, and that she spent the last two years trying to bring him down. wait a minute. aah! oh, did i say something smart? i love it when i do that. how are you at photoshop? a-mah-zing. i'm about to rewrite history. this sure beats a 40-ounce. the wedding's postponed. do you know what this means? wilhelmina is losing her grip on bradford. why we gotta talk about him during family time? i made this rum punch out of pomegranate. there ain't no more guava. yoga, please. if i'm ever going to get him back, it's now. i've got to go to that ball tonight. i've got to talk to him. you a wanted felon. cinderella can't go to no ball. she can if it's a masked ball. oh, hey! uh, i'm glad you're still here. there's just a little problem with my sandwich. oh, man. is there a hair? i'm, like, the only one left in my family with a full head. uh, no. it's just that there are only three sun-dried tomatoes. yeah. yeah, i know. i made it. oh, okay. uh, it's just that robert would always put more, so... sorry. i don't know where robert is. i'm not his keeper, okay? but robert didn't know jack about food. a sun-dried tomato is a concentrated flavor. more than three on a sandwich would overwhelm the smoky flavor of the turkey. okay, uh, you know what? i think my turkey can handle it. so could i just please have some more sun-dried tomatoes? nah. it would be wrong. i-i want my sandwich the way i want my sandwich. wow. (chuckles) you know, when i first saw you, i thought, "wow. there goes a girl from the neighborhood. what is she doing here?" now i see you're just like all the other spoiled "mode" girls. no. no, i'm not! you know, i bet before you got here, you didn't even know what a sun-dried tomato was. you just reached into the cart and pulled out whatever had the most cheese. i... i still eat cheese. i mean, how dare he act like he knows who i am? and wh-why do i even have to explain myself? okay, betty, not really sure why you're so upset. sun-dried tomatoes, really? i mean, don't you find them kind of salty and breathy? no, it's not just that. it's... i mean, he was so rude to me. betty, you need to calm down, okay? i mean, go online to that-- that web site you like. you know, the one with the baby ducks who think the cat's their mother? socuteitssick.com-- i love that web site. except one of the baby ducks is missing. all right, what is this guy's name? i don't know. something lame, like gio. come back for what? for a chance to run. hey, papi. have you been watching?</i> señor delgado's in a lot of trouble. do you think they're gonna kill him? let's hope not. (gun cocks) hey, did you book your flight yet? not yet. i just wanted to call and say... i love you all. ay. you're such a nervous flyer.</i> it's gonna be fine. ooh, it is getting good. okay, i'll talk to you later. love you, bye. you see? i'm not such a monster. i let you say good-bye. at least tell me what you want. who are you? (door opens) (man) i think you know my father. ramiro vasquez. it seems you did not kill me after all. uh, no, friday doesn't really help me. i really need to get the wheelchair here tonight. well, this thing can walk and talk. can't you just stick it on the turnpike and give it money for tolls? thank you. okay, so you don't get sarcasm. could you please just hold it for me, and i-i promise i will find a way to-- well, you must be happy um, i'll call you back. why? i just got fired because you went crying to your boss.</i> now i don't have a job. oh, man. i'm gonna have to go back to stealing cable from my neighbor, which i don't feel right about, all because some little "mode" girl wasn't happy with her sandwich. no, look, i wasn't trying to get you fired. i was just-- yeah, well, nonetheless, you did. all right, everybody, that's it for me, but before i go, there is no such thing as fat-free mayo. there's 125 calories of pure fat per tablespoon, and i put two in every sandwich. ooh! see you around, "mode" girl. (marc) nice, betty. you're finally one of us. no. no, i'm not one of you. -==http://www.ragbear.com==- ³óå®±´µù µú¶þ¼¾µú3¼¯</font> -=ææàãðü×öä»×é=- ·­òë£ºð¡°× ð£¶ô£ºð¡°× ê±¼äöá£º¾æäò·¹´ü</font> wilhelmina, you didn't have to go to this much trouble. well, someone's gotta teach you how to be a woman again. (sighs) it's so frustrating. it's like i finally got the sports car i always wanted, but i forgot how torive a stick. or maybe in this case, it's more like an automatic. don't worry. you're not going through th alone. i'm here. that's what best friends are for. it's so crazy. i can't remember our friendship. well, that's why i brought this. all right, all right. girls, come on. off, off. she's a tranny, not a drag queen. let's go. (woman) dr. fishman to radiology.</i> i have pictures of all kinds of fun the two of us had the past year. maybe it'll jog your memory. oh, here we are at fashion week, and that's my birthday. you made me drink something called an irish car bomb. mm. i had a hangover for the first time in 20 years. thank you very much. sorry. i guess a bit of alex must have slipped in there. oh. we square dance? wow. i don't remember any of this. oh, uh, apparently, we love to do-si-do. and here we are... marching for gay rights. so are we... no, no. just political. i really have to go. i need to check on your father. i hope he's gotten out of bed today. well, what's wrong? is he sick? no, no, no. it's... it's--it's nothing. just forget i said anything. besides, bradford would kill me. wilhelmina, you have to tell me. i mean, we're friends, right? best friends. god. i have missed talking to you. look, i'm really worried about your father. he's been devastated since he postponed his wedding. what? he's getting married again? to who? to your... best friend. i'm actually kind of bummed mr. meade's not my father. i mean, he is rich and bald. (gasps) your daddy warbucks fantasy. i don't know why that's so strong. okay, can we forget and focus on your mother and what being fey sommers' daughter can get us? and by "us," i mean you, and by "you," i mean me. think about it-- the invites, the swag. (gasps) you are right. i am freakin' fey sommers' daughter. and... genius idea. your coming-out party is tonight at the black & white ball. yay! (gasps) it is? it's perfect. this was fey's big event. every year, she would arrive in some fabulous red gown and utter her famous lines... (imitates fey) "black & white ball? i guess i didn't get the memo." i can totally do that. and when you arrive holding her ugly mutt, there will be a media feeding frenzy, and i will be right there to feast on whatever scraps are left after they're done with your carcass. nope. too angry. calm down, henry. (marc) hey, grubstink! grubstink! we need our checks early. yeah, i gotta buy me a red dress, grubstank. it's grubstick. (pounds desk) grubstick. got it?</i> it's one of the oldest and most honored names in dutch history, which loosely translates to, "he who gives the fairest price for his bricks." the name is venerated, and i am proud to be a grubstick.</i> did he just get really hot? i've never been more attracted to anyone in my life. charlie, this is henry. call me as soon as you get this. we need to talk. hey, justin. how you doing? okay. been having kind of a tough time lately, huh? i guess. do you know how to play basketball? sure. back at harvard, they used to call me dr. swish. it's just a basketball term. why do you ask? i want to learn how to play. really? basketball? my dad loved it. this was his. come on. let's go shoot some hoops. wait. sandwich guy! oh, man. gio! look, i'm sorry about what happened today, but i just finished talking to your boss, and you can have your job back. wow. that was... that was nice of you. see? i'm not a "mode" girl. a "mode" girl wouldn't have done that. yeah, i guess not, but that's okay. i don't want it back. why? because losing that job was exactly the kick in the butt i needed. it was taking me away from my 5-year plan. what's happening in five years? to start my own place, you know? gio's sandwich depot. 300 seats, a thousand kinds of sandwiches and the world's longest condiment bar. you name it, it's on there. go ahead. name one. um... mustard? of course there's gonna be musrd there. come on. use your imagination. sorry. ???? gio's could be huge. look, i don't know why, but i still feel kind of guilty about getting you fired. you don't have a job. well... something will turn up. hey! (betty) wait! you have a van. we need a van. would you drive me to new jersey to pick up a wheelchair? we'd pay you. sure, i could do that. get in. sauerkraut? don't embarrass yourself. my father left my mom for you? oh, this memory loss must be frustrating. claire is the one that left your father. and you were right there to move in. well, it-- it wasn't like that at all. i was just trying to be there for him-- a shoulder to lean on, someone to bring him soup-- and i never could have predicted that we'd fall in love, but we did. well, if he loves you so much, why'd heall off the wedding? because he loves you more. with the accident and all, he didn't want to upset you. i just hope his... his heart can take it. wilhelmina, wait. that was quite a beating you gave me all those years ago. as i remember, it was to protect rosa from one of your beatings.</i> she was my wife. i had the right. get your feet down, you animal! ay! aah!</i> my cook ran away with my wife. you humiliated me. the only thing that kept me going through the years was the hope that... maybe one day... i could have my revenge. it seems that day has come. so you want me dead? perhaps. but right now, i want my flan. your flan? your best dessert. sometimes i wake up, and i miss my wife. sometimes i miss my flan. you're insane. no. just hungry. you'll make your flan... maybe i spare your life. remember that. all right, you can do this. let's shoot. but you're dribbling with one hand, right? not two. okay. all right, so you wanna step off with your left, bounce it in with your right, okay? all right, one handed. (man) oh, nice, nice. okay, let's try again. maybe lose the bracelets, i don't know. come on, justin. we can do this. you just gotta concentrate. (daniel) one hand, justin.

(turns off radio) that's a really hard song to sing. so tell me, if you're not a "mode" girl, then why do you work there? it's a great opportunity. it's gonna open a lot of doors for me. i want to have a magazine of my own one day. ah. how-- how do you do that? i'm an assistant now, but then i want to be writing for one. you're a writer? mm-hmm. that's cool. what have you written? a lo actually, i practically ran the queens college newspaper, but since i've left, the quality has gone way down. no, i mean lately. uh, well... (sighs) nothing really, but i do have a lot of ideas. good. keeping it all up there. that's how hemingway did it. he was thinking, "what a nice morning," and "the sun also rises" just magically appeared on the page. are you making fun of me? no, no, no. i'm sorry. i just, you know, i hope you're not one of these people who just waits for things to happen. no. i mean, what are you, like, 30 now? i'm 23. all right, you know what? i can take care of myself. how about you worry about driving? okay? (scoffs) you're faking it to meet girls? it's this one girl. she's my new physical therapist. she is just-- she's so totally... smart. look, we don't have to tell your aunt betty, do we? she already thinks i'm a total screwup. i promise i will have a total recovery next week, just as soon as i've had one, uh, really smart conversation with her. deal? you're kind of a dog. i am. you remind me of my dad. now this machine has to come back in pristine condition. you got it? pristine. how do i want it back? don't worry. it'll be perfect. (quietly) i think he wanted you to say "pristine." pristine. now just one second. this... this isn't the ibot we reserved. yeah. nick lachey's people just called. he twisted his ankle in a gyrotonics class. probably didn't stretc anyway, we're giving it to him. but... but... my boss wanted the ibot. yeah, sad story. you're getting this one. (cell phone rings) hello? but that's not fair. (man) yeah. we reserved the ibot. we paid for it, and he's giving us the... tulip? daniel can't ride a tulip. give him a good reason to give it to you. come on. you're a writer. make up a good story. (man) we'll deliver it tomorrow. excuse me. yeah, i'll call you back. sir? um, look, i probably shouldn't even be talking about this, but my boss works for the c.i.a. yeah, and we really need that chair. how could he have believed that crazy story? 'cause it was good. well, i y have borrowed a little of it from "casino royale," but i did put my own spin on it. hells yeah, you did. you know, maybe you are a writer after all. thanks. maybe i am. wait a minute. is this real? am i pinning an endangered species here? if you really want to feel bad, i have a hat made of bald eagle. (singsongy) guess who just called bradford to her bedside. took herong enough. looks like she'll be giving her blessing for this wedding within the hour. perfect. everything is going according to my plan. (gasps) soft. oh! hard. what was that for? square dancing. better than i remember. kill him anyway. this one almost went in, but i touched something gross on the pole. wow, honey. good for you so... this basketball thing-- this is something you're gonna be doing for, um, a little while? yeah. i like it, and i think i'm getting better. (glass shatters) (justin) oh! yeah, definitely. i can see that. wait a minute. wait a minute. i thought daniel was supposed to be in a wheelchair. daniel, it's betty again. we got you your chair, but it's almost 7:00, so you're just gonna have to meet us here. and i've got the lint roller, so i'll just go over you when you get here. (laughs) man. what? you know, i think i know the reason why you don't write. you're too busy de-linting your boss' ass. see, no. i didn't say the "a" word, and my job doesn't just consist of silly little things like that. i have some very important responsibilities. excuse me. what is that? that--the check isn't supposed to be that big, and we asked for it to be blue. how is that gonna look next to daniel's tiny pale head? (laughs) stop laughing at me. and not that it's any of your business, but i will get back to my writing.
