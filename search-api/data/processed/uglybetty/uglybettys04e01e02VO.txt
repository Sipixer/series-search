And we decided we need to reevaluate Your role in the company. - Connor owens.  - You want him alive? As long as I get the money, I really don't care. What are you doing here? I'm sick. It's cancer. The only thing I care about is the time we have left. I'm moving in with Matt. Do you love him? - I do.  - I guess this is good-bye. - What are you saying?  - We're over. you're just walk away? I'm never gonna see you again? My dad offered me a job at "Mode" And I'm gonna take it. I'm your new boss. They were, like, gnarly monster teeth, Like... Like Gollum Or someone from the deep backwoods of England. You're just nervous About your first day as a features editor. That's true. I read a book about dreams That says teeth dreams means you have anxiety... Or menopause, but I don't think that's the case here. When are those things coming off anyway? Soon. The dontist scheduled me for a few months now. Ay, it's about freaking time. Hey, Hilda, do you think you could trim my bangs? - Maybe, but I'm kinda liking the look.  - I kinda can't see. Good morning. - Hi! Justin, my little man.  - First day of school. Justin, what did you dream about last night?

Thanks, mom. please. I figure we gotta break out the labels For your first day of high school. We can't afford college now, but at least you'll be styling. Oh! Oh! Speaking of styling, Betty, straight from Edinburgh! Yeah, Christina asked me To wait to give this to you until today. Oh! Christina. I know. A pantsuit? It's great. But it just...It's not really me. Guys, I gotta go. Wait. Wait. First-day photo op. Come on. Come on. Come on. Squeeze together, freshman and freshwoman. All right, ready? Everybody say "first day"! First day!

"Page six" is a little lighter without you. You have got to stop doing that. I only have so much glassware. Hide. Morning. I come bearing dry-cleaning! With extra plastic for the landfills, Just how you like it. Marc, you could have brought those to the office. I know, but you've been so in and out lately, I didn't know If you were gonna be in today, - And so I just thought I would  - Too many words, Marc. I'll see you at the office. Wait. Can I use your bathroom? No, Marc, you can't use my bathroom. No one uses my bathroom, not even me. What was that? Housekeeper. But I thought we had her deported. Willie, what's going on? You're being weird. And what was that stuff in the news today? Is that true? Marc, how many times have we planted damaging rumors In the news for self-serving reasons? Don't you worry your silky little curls. But I got a message from claire and hartley, - And they want to meet with you tonight.  - Fine. But what if they, you know, and then you have to... Mm? Now not enough words, Marc. What if they fire you? What happens to us? We will blow up that bridge when we get to it. Now if you will excuse me... I am an attractive, intelligent, confident... Associate features editor. Step forward. - Here you go.  - I get my own credit card? Yeah, if you're an editor here, you get one. It's one of the many perks of your new position. But don't get too excited. They put a $100 cap on lunches. Oh, per week? Per lunch, honey. Oh, and if you're here past normal work hours, Of course you have access to the meade town cars, As well as the gym and steam room. And your new ID Badge. Nice picture. It really is. Thank you. I know Mode is a fashion magazine, and that's great. I just think that we could also Be telling stories that matter, you know, Touching people's lives? Yeah, I just like the pictures of the shoes. Yeah. No, the shoes are...The shoes are great. I have plenty of those kinds of ideas, too. You know, I remember checking you in three years ago When you first started working here, and I thought, God, I'll be processing that girl's exit paperwork Within a month. Congratulations. Enjoy your new office. Betty, hi. We've never technically met. I'm Mee-gan. Not Meg-an or May-gan. Mee-gan. I know. I've read everything you've done for "Mode." I think your features are amazing That stuff's gonna have to go. Super cute, but it's policy Editor decor has to be fashion-related. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Um, are we sharing? 'cause I thought she said that this was my office. That's adorable. You thought an associate editor would get her own office. I just want to eat you up. Um, well, this will be fun. We'll be office mates. Yeah. It's more fun not to be. I had my own office, which took four years to get. But I just had to give it to our new boss. I think you might know him. I'm Matt Hartley, your new managing editor. Actually, that's my seat. - Oh, sorry.  - Some of you I know, some of you I don't, And some of you I thought I knew but apparently, I didn't. My role is to be a conduit Between you guys and the editors-in-chief. That means any ideas you guys have For articles or spreads come through me, Because it's all about communication, people. Some of you may have to work on that. All right, we're starting work on our global fashion issue. Betty, why don't you start us off? You're good with beginnings, not so good with endings. Okay, um, global? Uh, well, I've been quite interested In the situation in sub-saharan Africa. Uh, malaria is devastating the continent. The awareness in the United States - Is practically zero  - Uh, malaria? Um, yep. Is there a fashion angle? Yes. I think that there would be a very interesting side story - With African fashion  - Betty's on to something. Malaria comes from mosquitoes. So what if we do an accessories piece on insect jewelry? Uh, yeah. No, that's not what I was gonna say. B-b-b-b-betty. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Insect jewelry had its heyday in the '60s, But lately I've been noticing a fashion trend Back toward bugs and gross things, but pretty. I like it, megan. Run with it. Who's next? Oh, what's up, Fergie? Hi. That's a real pretty, cute shirt you got on. Who makes it? Uh, it's Gucci. Gucci. Gucci. Oh! Oh, man. Next time, don't be so clumsy. - great. I guess everyone has their assignments.  - I don't. I'm really excited to be here. Go, team. Matt. Matt, can we talk? I'm really busy. I know, which is why I've been calling you, But you haven't answered any of my calls. I just there are some things that we need to talk about. Hi, Marc. I haven't seen you all day. Oh, I really have to take this. Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really? Amanda? Oh, Betty, hey. I was just taking inventory. Since Christina's been gone, you never know who's gonna come down here steal things Not me. Oh, I'm just happy to see a friendly face. And I can finally congratulate you on your big promotion. Oh, Amanda, thank you. The first latina supreme court justice... Tell me, Betty, how does that feel? How do your people feel? Amanda, I'm not judge Sotomayor. Bueno. But just promise me You will not overturn Roe v. Wade. Hey, you want to grab some lunch? Sorry, I can't. Marc totally hates you for taking his job, And I still have to figure out how you and I can be friends. Mandy? Get away from me, you bloated troll. Hi, Betty. I've been meaning to tell you-Cute outfit. Already enjoying the perks, I see. Hello, Wilhelmina. It's been a... A rough day. I hope you're not expecting a pep talk. No. No. God, no. Good. Being an editor-- It's more complicated than I imagined. We're really gonna do this? Wake up and smell the aromatherapy, Betty. Being an assistant is boot camp. Being an editor is war. You have your allies, you have your enemies Often times you can't tell which is which. It just sort of feels like I have more enemies than allies right now. Mm, yes, you do. Oh, and by the way-- Malaria, really? Like I would ever put disease-ridden poor people In the pages of this magazine. How did you know about that? I know everything. Well... How does one survive? You look out for yourself. If it means screwing over everyone else? So be it. What if you're not that kind of a person? Well, then you change Or you'll be eaten alive. Ahh. Are you saying that muffins are your secret weapon? Mm-hmm. Food can be very effective. The more I have at my campaign rallies, The higher the spike in my polls. Yeah, but this is "mode." Those people don't exactly eat. Which is why I'm making nonfat, sugar-free, Low-carb blueberry muffins high in antioxidants. It's just to break the ice. You should break the ice with something That you couldn't actually use to break ice. Ay, mija, try some butter. No, dad. No butter. Well, at least add some walnuts, for flavor. Fine. Look, I don't even care if they actually eat them. I just need to get in there and make some allies. I think you should put rat poison In Matt's muffins and be done with it. Hilda. I'm the one who hurt him. He needs time, And I just need to be patient. Are you saying that you want to get back with him? A few weeks ago, they were moving in together. Those feelings don't just go away. What? He's got to forgive me sometime. Dad. Justin! Hey, sweetie! Nice queensboro high sweatshirt. Yeah! Hey, Mr. School spirit. All right. Yay! Thanks. Wait. Oh, oh, oh! Wait. Justin. What happened at school? Was it great? Come on. You're not even gonna tell us a little something? You know, I'm kind of beat, So could we talk about it tomorrow morning? Oh. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. Now I realize that the three of us Have not always been the best of... friends. Well, I suppose I shouldn't have tried to blackmail Claire. But in my defense, it's hardly the worst thing I've done to the woman. Though she really is less of a woman at this point Than something you use to scare crows or children. Uh, there's something we need to tell you, Wilhelmina. But you're not making it any easier. Enough with the dramatic windups. I know you want to fire me, so go ahead and do it. But if you expect me to grovel or apologize, I think you ought to know by now, You're talking to the wrong woman. Good luck. Finding someone else that can do what I do. - Claire? - We want you to stay. I'm sorry. All those face-lifts must have affected your speech. What did you say? We want you to stay on as editor-in-chief of "mode," Reporting to me, of course. You seem surprised, Yet your eyebrows haven't moved at all. Well, this is unexpected. You were right. It was very hard to find someone who can do what you do. Well, I'm sorry for the insults, Claire. You know, old habits. Of course, and for what it's worth, I had a really good one for you about v.d. You'll have to tell me sometime. I look forward to it. Mmm! Que rico. Would you like a muffin to brighten your day? Low fat, low sugar, high antioxidants. Low fat, low sugar, low-everything muffin. I'll save you one. Mmm! Que rico. Hey, Marc. Oh, hi. Betty's waddling around here somewhere. Last I saw, she was tossing carbs around the office With wild abandon. Actually, I was sort of looking for you. Look, I'll take any insect jewelry you've got. Literally everything I've found so far is strictly craft fair. Thanks. Hi. Brought you a muffin-- Made it myself. I'll just save it for later, hmm? Megan, I just want you to know That if you need any help at all on your article, I'm here for you. Research, calls, anything-- Name it, I'm your girl. Oh, my god. That's so sweet. Matt. Matt, I made you a muffin, And I was thinking maybe we could talk, You know, about us. Betty, not at work. Was that my nephew? Sorry. I have to take this. Hello? Hi, Marc. It's Betty. That's a muffin. You can't call a tape dispenser with a muffin. Yes, you can. I just did, and you answered. Bee boo beep! We're sorry. Your call has been disconnected. Marc, I know you hate me, But can't you just answer one simple question? I... Walnuts. Justin was talking to Marc? About what? I don't know why Justin was here talking to Marc. Marc's throat closed up before he could tell me. - Convenient.  - No, not convenient. He was allergic to the walnuts Papi put in my muffins. And he didn't say anything to you before? - I thought you were gonna win him over.  - it didn't work. No one liked my muffins, I don't know why Justin was here, and I'm sorry. Good-bye. I miss him, too. Hi. Hi. How are you doing, Betty? I'm fine. Mm, yes, starting a new job Working for your ex-boyfriend. I can see how that would leave you... Fine. Well, I will be fine. I just need to... Find some allies. And how's that going? Put Marc in the hospital. That was you? Not on purpose. What about Matt? He's just been so cold. It makes me wonder if he ever really had feelings for me - To begin with.  -He wouldn't be here if he didn't. Trust me. I know a thing or two about Hartleys. Well, he doesn't want to talk to me about it, So it really doesn't make a difference. Those feelings are still there. You just have to find a way to bring them out. - What are you doing?  - Jogging in the park. - you're wearing heels.  - Yeah, I gotta get to work later, And my new boss hates it when I'm late. Matt, you don't want to talk about us when we're at work. - We're not at work.  - There's nothing to talk about. I know you're hurt, you're the one who took the job as my boss at "Mode." So? So tell me that had nothing to do with me. Look, what do you want? You want me to tell you I took the job Because I still have feelings for you? Because I don't. Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? - I don't know.  - You kissed me. - I know.  - Why did you kiss me? Because you said you don't have feelings for me. I don't. I don't believe you. Matt, I think you are doing this to hurt me, all because of some stupid moment that meant nothing. I don't know how else to apologize For what happened with Henry. Look, I can't do this. Please. What were you doing at "Mode" the other day? Who told you that? I ran into Naomi Campbell on Roosevelt Boulevard. She said she saw you there. So... What were you talking to Marc about? I spilled low fat dressing on my new shirt. It was ruined. I didn't want to tell you Because you spent so much money on it, So Marc got me another one. Honey, you could have told me that. Anyway, it wasn't that expensive. It was an irregular, So there was something wrong with the stitching. Yeah, I saw that, but I still liked it. You. Such a good kid. Marc! What happened to you yesterday? I'm sorry. I had an allergic reaction, And I had to go to the emergency room. I would have told you about it, but my throat closed shut. Well, in the future, do it on your own time. I need to hydrate. So I've been too scared to ask, But how did the meeting go with Hartley and the hag? They want to keep me on. Well, that's the best news I've heard in days... After, "you're going to live." Oh, please. Daniel can't run this magazine by himself. They're just buying time till they can lure The only other person in the world That can do what I do -- Isabelle Besset, french "Elle." I checked. They've been trading calls. That's not good news. What are we going to do? Oh, I don't know. Oh, stop spritzing. I don't always have a plan, you know. Hello? Marc. I don't want you answering my cell phone anymore. It was just a call from your apartment. Yes. And I would like my privacy respected... Starting now. - She's keeping secrets from me.  - Who? - Wilhelmina. - Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't really listening. She obviously has someone in that apartment That she doesn't want me to know about. Maybe it's a guy she's having a torrid affair with. Now she tells me she's being pushed out of "mode," And she doesn't have a plan. - she expect me believe that - maybe she's running away With the guy she's having a torrid affair with. Maybe I can join them. The only person she ever felt that way about... Oh, my lady gaga. Mandy, you're brilliant. You take that back. I'm beautiful. It's Connor. She's hiding him... In her apartment. And he's already asked her to run away with him once. And now she has no reason to stay. What if she actually does it this time? - If she's out... Then I'm out. - Who? Wilhelmina. I'm sorry. I told you, I wasn't really listening. Start from the beginning. Daniel! Oh, my god! I was just thinking about calling you. Are you back? Are you okay? Sort of. I'm having a bit of an issue here at the airport. So you may be On some terrorist watch list for now, But they're not gonna press charges. Press charges. I should press charges. Betty, they lost my wife. Daniel, weren't you gonna spread her ashes At the Jokhang Temple? I did, but I decided to keep some of the ashes. But then they made me check the urn, And they lost her. They lost half my wife. But they found her. You have the urn. It's okay. Daniel, I know you want to stay at Molly's apartment, but... Is that really the best idea? Look, it's fine. My apartment's on the market. I need a place to stay. Besides, I have to go through her things anyway. All right. If you think it's okay. Enough about me. I want to hear about how things have been going. How's life as an editor? Great. Really great. Good. It's good. You are a bad liar. I know. But I'm not gonna complain about my problems to you. Betty, trust me. It's a relief to hear about somebody else's problems. So he barely speaks to me-- Thank you--and then my pitch Gets turned into something completely different, Which he decides to give to Megan. Wait. I can't believe that spoiled little bastard Gave it to Megan. Did you talk to Wilhelmina or my mom? No. No. I don't have to do that. And it's not just matt, Daniel. It's like everybody hates me. Oh, you can turn that around. maybe it's gonna be like your first year at "mode." Used to make fun of you? They even started that blog about you. You know, the one about your outfits. The one where they took pictures of you every day? You have to know about this. Oh, boy. Oh, my god. They've been doing this since my first day at "mode" And nobody told me? Betty, I just kinda thought you knew. Well, I love that outfit. Yeah, I-I love that one, too. Uh, okay, maybe that one was a mistake. You know what? Don't worry about it. You survived that. You're gonna survive this. How? Well, doing what you always do. Focus on your work, show them you're a team player. I am. I tried to help megan Find a take on her insect jewelry piece. She didn't like any of my ideas. I love that belt. Insect jewelry? So Molly found this in some antique shop a while back. Turns out it's worth a lot of money. "Olivia"? Yeah, it's, uh, Olivia Guillemette. She was big in the '60s, she's kind of a recluse now. But I bet a resourceful writer/editor - Could track her down. - Thank you, Daniel. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I missed you, too, Betty. Did you really have to bookmark that blog? No, that's so cool. I can't believe it. Well, the doctors overseas are always better. Willie, how come you didn't tell me That your daughter was back in town? How much do we love Nico's new nose? Hon-honestly, it took my breath away. Are you Olivia? Shh. You're just in time. Come in quickly or you'll miss it. Hurry up. Quick. Come on. Uh, Willie, I have to ask you a question. - Are you mad at me? - No more than usual. Oh, I just don't understand Why you felt you had to hide Nico from me. I need to know that you still trust me. Don't we have an agreement not to discuss your needs? Yes, of course. It's just... You'd not believe some of the scenarios I came up with About who you were hiding here. At one point, I even thought it was Connor. Well, there is something that I haven't told you. Uh, and it's not about Nico. It's about Connor. I knew it. I knew you knew it. I hired a bounty hunter to track him down So I could take back the money he stole from meade In order to use it to buy out Hartley. But Hartley's got his snout all up in Claire's spanx. He's not gonna sell his shares of meade to you. Well, he won't know it's me. I'll use an intermediary. Oh, Marc... You think this is my first extortion/secret takeover? Please. Right. Of course. So I'm--I'm sorry I left you out of it, sometimes I feel I need to protect you from these things. Oh, well, thank you. But--but no more secrets, right? No more secrets. Promise. Okay. Well, now that Marc knows you're back, People are gonna start to find out. We have to act like everything is normal. You understand? Sweetheart? I'm scared. What are you doing here? I think I'm in trouble. Don't worry. I will take care of everything. I've never seen a butterfly Come out of its cocoon before. Everyone talks about the miracle of birth. I think rebirth is even more of a miracle. Mm. It looks like he's struggling. Oh, he can handle it. I suspect that caterpillars stay in their cocoons A little longer than they really need to. It's gotta be scary To change into a whole new thing. He's so beautiful. But the caterpillar is just... gone. Oh, he's still in there. Other people see the wings And colors. I'll always see the caterpillar. thank you so much for letting me see that. That's amazing. Mm. I think so, too. That's why I invited everybody to watch. Everybody? Mm-hmm. Oh. Unfortunately, I have now got to get everybody Back into their house. I'll need some help. So anyway, the reason I came was to talk to you - About a-a feature that "mode" magazine  - Careful. You don't want to tip over the tarantulas. Ugh. You are correct. I thought that we could focus the feature On your insect jewelry. Shh! It's on your shoulder. A tarantula? A butterfly. Hold very still. I think they're attracted By the color of your clothes. Really? This is kind of tame for me. Mm. All right. Very still. Oh, now... You follow me... Back to the butterfly house. Careful. There you go. Now shake. We did it. They like you. Now what did you want to talk about? These are for you. And here you go. Oh, my god. Olivia? I thought she was dead. Nope, she's alive, and a very fascinating woman Who would make a wonderful subject for your feature. What do you want? Nothing. Are you trying to steal my story? No, I was trying to help. Take it or leave it. Shoot. Here. Thank you. Betty. Those muffins you made were really good. Hello! Hi. There you are. Ah! Betty's younger sister. Oh, oh. Well, thank you for the part of that That complimented me, But watch it for the part That slammed my sister. Yeah? Listen, I came here to thank you - For helping Justin out with the shirt yesterday.  - Oh. Yeah, but I want to pay you for it, all right? Okay. It was $400. What? It was free. I called the design house, Told them it was a Jonas. They sent one right over. Keep your money. Oh... That's good, because, you know, This check bond is so hard. Anyway, thank you so much for helping Justin out. Oh, yeah. Well, it's hard for a kid when He gets pushed around like that. Yeah. Wait. What did you say? Wait. What did you say? Someone's pushing my son around? No. No. Okay, obviously, he didn't want you to know about it, So you have to pretend like I didn't tell you. I'm not pretending anything. If someone is pushing my son around, I need to know. Why--why did he lie to me? Uh, well, because you're his mother. And I speak from experience-- It is really hard for a boy To admit something like that to his mother. No, not Justin. We are like this. Clearly. the next time he comes to you with something like this, I would appreciate it if you sent him right home to me. But... I'm not asking. Okay. But--mm Thanks for inviting me to have lunch with you. It feels so good to have someone to talk to. Trust me. I feel the same way. It's been a rough week. Remember last year when everyone was like, "Change, yay. Obama. Change"? This year, change sucks. Justin, I am so sorry that high school's been rough. Trust me. I know exactly what that feels like. I wish I could do something to help. Are you kidding? You're already doing it. I saw Heidi Klum on the way in. Oh, actually, that was Monica-- Don't ruin my moment. It was Heidi Klum. Heidi looks amazing. Can you believe she's had three children? I know. Hey. Some of us are eating over there. Come join if you want. Is that Meg-an? Mee-gan, yeah. But I'm having lunch with you. Are you kidding? You're so stupid. Why would you not go eat with them? They're the popular table, And you won't get a second invite. Justin, I am not abandoning you. Well, then I'm abandoning you. Bye. Hey, Marc. what are you up to? Is she still here? Is this a... test? What are you talking about? I  want to see if you want to go grab lunch or something. Well, first of all, I had fries last night, So there'll be no lunch today, And 2nd, tu mama just scared the "hey-soos" out of me. My mother? what are you talking about? She was just here, and she was very clear About me not talking to you. So I'm sorry. You probably shouldn't come around anymore. Hasta luego. When you first showed up, I didn't think I would like you. yeah, I could kinda tell. I just thought you'd gotten the job as a courtesy Because you were Daniel's assistant, Not because you were talented. Oh. wow. okay. Look, I take the title "editor" pretty seriously, But I can see, you do, too. Hmm. Thanks, Megan. Hey, skinny bitches... and betty. Emergency meeting in the conference room, Fire in the hole, chippity chop chop chop--All departments. Wait. Amanda, what? Daniel's back. Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for cutting your lunches short. I appreciate all the hard work you've been doing while I've been gone, but I'm back now, and unfortunately, There are some things going on that I just don't like. First of all, the feature piece on insect jewelry-- It was a pitch started from betty. It was taken away from her and given to Megan. I know you're new here, Matt, But that's not the way we do things. So effective immediately, the story goes back to Betty. Sorry, Megan. You have to come up With some ideas of your own. Matt, it's probably a good idea if you did a little legwork, Figure out the dos and don'ts of being a managing editor. Look forward to reading your piece, betty. I'm sure it's gonna be great. Guys. I swear, I did not ask for special treatment. So you didn't mention anything to daniel? Well, I... I mean, I gave him an update. But I didn't ask for the article. Liar! Get the liar who spreads the lies! Go for her fleshy middle! Sorry, betty. I'll just aim for a cankle. I'll aim for the heart. It'll only hurt for the rest of your life. I surrender! Well, boys and girls, Looks like we caught ourselves a meaty one. We're gonna eat good tonight. Who's in the mood for some carnitas? Betty, it did not happen like that at all. Okay, maybe I'm overexaggerating a little, But my glasses did break, look. Ay, then maybe you'll finally get some new ones. What's wrong with these? I've been wearing them since high school. I love these glasses. All I'm saying is, I feel like I'm under attack at work. It's like, Matt, Marc, Megan-- Anyone whose name starts with a "muh." It sounds like Daniel is looking after to you Yeah, and his name starts with a "duh." It feels like things have gotten worse Since Daniel got back. I mean, I was finally starting to fit in. I know his heart was in the right place, But he just came and screwed it all up. Look at it this way-- A few days ago, You were worried you had no allies and no assignments. Now that Daniel's back, you got both. Papi, you are missing the point. No, no, no. You need to tell Daniel to back that truck up, That you can take care of yourself. Hello. Well, he juit lost his wife. I mean, that's a little harsh, no? Okay, well, then you can kiss fitting in at your new job good-bye. So I was at the gates last night, And that dad from "Jon & Kate plus 8" was there-- I think his name's Ben-- Anyway, he was totally hitting on me, of course. And p.s., "plus 8"? More like "plus 4." Um, Blondre the giant is over there. I think she wants to talk to you. I choose to ignore the elderly. O.M.G.! The gates? I was there last night, too. Did you see ben from "jon & kate plus 8"? Oh, so sad-- Old and crazy. Don't worry. It'll all be over soon! Ooh, he's hot. By the way, Serge, that bouncer? Little handsy. - I know. - I kind of liked it. Me, too. Old people usually frighten me, 'cause they remind me of death and all... But I like you. You're like a giant, knobby shade tree. Thanks. Anyway, um, can you tell me Where Daniel Meade's office is? I'm supposed to be his temp. I can do you one better. I can take you to the closet where we can steal clothes. Oh, my god. I worship you. Damn it. Damn it! Betty, hey. How's my favorite associate editor this morning? Um, better than your stapler. And, you know, Daniel, There are a lot of really great editors around here. You probably shouldn't have any favorites. You're right. You are right. So about your meeting yesterday-- Yeah, wasn't that great? I am so stoked to be back. It just feels good to be involved again, you know-- Helping out, helping you. Yeah. Yay. Helping me. So... Ready for your big pitch meeting? I'm sure you're gonna knock it out of the park. Oh, look at that! We are gonna be late. Come on. Um. We? Wait, Daniel. You don't usually go to department pitch meetings. Well, I've been known to make an appearance. Besides, I can't miss your first one, can I? I-I really appreciate you wanting to help me. It's just, I don't want to get a reputation, You know, for being "Daniel's girl." Now wait. Who the hell is calling you "Daniel's girl"? No. No, no one. I just--I just want to keep it that way. You know, people around here can be rough. Yeah, I get it. I mean... Back when my father, sister and mother all worked here, I-I used to worry that people thought I got Preferential treatment, too. Yeah. Yeah, right. It's--that's exactly it. All right, then. I'll keep my distance. Good luck in there. Okay. Glittered cleavage? Really, Marissa? I thought you were better than that. No, I didn't. Go. I can't even look at you. Well, I think we can all agree that the beauty department Really crapped the sheets. Features, I hope you can do better. Well, uh, betty is our newest editor. I'm sure she's dying to pitch. Okay, uh... So I've been doing research on an amazing woman Who does very intricate insect jewelry. Oh, stop. "Elle" did a piece on dragonfly brooches last year. Is someone not doing their homework? People, I want you to think outside the box. Be bolder! Preferably, an original idea, If that's not too much to ask. Now, Betty, for the first time in my life, I want bigger from you. What do you have? You want to hear another idea, which is okay, Because I have a whole bunch of them. Um... Okay, okay. I have to say something. So, what? Uh, mosquito netting, malaria. No, don't say "malaria." Wilhelmina hates malaria. Now I can't get it out of my head! - malaria, malaria. - Betty, we're waiting. Sorry. I just have to, um, organize my notes. Don't say "malaria." don't say "malaria." Don't say... Malaria! Oh, dear god. No! Wait. See, the united nations has this program they promote bed netting to stop the spreading of malaria In third world countries. It's called "nothing but nets." it's very clever, right? You're not gonna stop, are you? What if we got a big designer to make a series of dresses Out of the bed netting material? And--and the u.n. Will let people shoot there - If they promote awareness of one of their initiatives.  - Ok It's a win-win, really. See, we look great, we're promoting a great cause. It's only $10 to buy a net and save a life. I mean I said okay! Don't make me take it back Because the sound of your voice is annoying me. Sorry. All right, I'm done with you. Push all my afternoon meetings to next week. I am going home. And I'm getting a pedicure. Oh! Ah! And a manicure. Ms. Slater? My name is Oscar Castelar. I'm investigating the disappearance of Jonathan Vieja. I believe he's dating your daughter-- Or he was before he disappeared. I'm sorry, Mr. Castelar. Did you say you were with the police? No. I'm a private investigator. Jonathan's family in Madrid hired me to find him. - Well, why didn't they call the police?  - They did. But the American police think he's no longer on U.S. Soil. His family suspects otherwise. That's where I come in. Well, where do I come in? I love to get a chance to ask your daughter some questions About when she last saw Jonathan. I'm not sure we can be of any help. She hasn't seen that boy in quite a while. You'd be surprised, Ms. Slater. Sometimes the smallest detail can blow a case wide open. So how about tomorrow? Hey there. I said, hey there. So what, you're not talking to me now? What gave it away, the not talking part? Hey. I can't believe you told Marc not to talk to me. You're mad at me about that? I should be mad at you. You lied to me. Why didn't you tell me That somebody at school was picking on you? He told you?! It was an accident. But why do I have to hear it from somebody else? What is going on with you? Justin, don't walk away from me. Justin! Sweetie, look, I know how hard high school is. Do you think it's easy being pregnant and go to classes Well, skipping classes. But everybody telling me I was getting fat-- So what? Do you think that has anything to do With what I'm going through? I'm just saying, you can talk to me. I understand. You don't understand me at all. Besides, you hate mosquitoes, we hate mosquitoes-- Everybody wins, except the mosquitoes. Yes, I'll hold. Looks like you're gonna make that u.n. Thing happen. I'm trying. What are you doing? You still have some office decor violations. I thought I'd help out. Don't want you to get written up. I can take care of it. Yes, hi. Really? Oh, well, that's, uh, that's amazing news. Um, yes, we were thinking, uh, sometime next week? Tomorrow? Hi, matt. Are you busy? Look, I know we're not exactly on the best terms-- Given that you hate me and all, But I have an eensy-weensy little problem With the u.n. Shoot. It has to happen tomorrow. - Are you serious?  - Yes. It's the only day they can give us One of the council rooms. I've already called about getting international models, And I spoke to Roberto Dipaolo. he agreed to design the dresses, even with the tight turnaround. Great So he thought he was signing up for something long-term And ended up with something short-term. I can relate. Not one of your best slams, but okay. - Are we done here?  - No. Look, if this is gonna happen by tomorrow, then... I need the help of the entire department. Oh, so... You want me-- Oh, Matt, please don't make this about you and me. This is about what's best for the magazine. You know what? You're right. So betty needs you to drop everything you are working on To help her with what she's working on. As usual, everything is about what betty wants. Thank you for that, Matt. I like to think of this as a team effort. And there's no "i" in team, unless you spell it "t-e-i-m." Anyway, uh, you all know the basic concept-- Malaria, mosquitoes. But we're at a fashion magazine, right? So still happy. There's a lot of work to be done before tomorrow, So expect to be here late. But the good news is, coffee's on me! Betty Suarez. Yeah, is this, uh, Daniel Meade's assistant? Um, nope. Not anymore, actually. Now... Whatever. What's wrong? Is everything okay? Who is this? Building security. I think we may have a situation with Mr. Meade. Stupid... Betty, I Know, it just ...Molly and I were supposed to go on our honeymoon. I just--I have to see That stupid ad everywhere in this city. It just--there it was, right in front of "mode." I-i just--I lost it. you are surrounded by things that remind you of Molly. No, I know, Betty. I-i know. God, how could I have been so s-- Okay, um... Let's maybe not hit things anymore. Look, we can find you another place to stay. No. I don't need another place to stay. Look, I'm sorry you had to bring me home. I apologize. I hadn't seen my temp all day, okay? Daniel, I'm happy to help. Is there anything else I can do? No, nothing. Everything's fine. Besides, you need to go to work. Yeah, um... Well... You probably shouldn't be alone. Um... I could call your mom. No. Look, she just worries. Okay, go. I'm gonna be fine. Daniel, you're crying. No, it's these..... Daniel! Son of a bitch! I haven't been sleeping... At all. Just a little on edge. Yeah, I know. It's just... I'm used to being in the room with someone. And without that... It's--it's pretty quiet. Just give me one second. Betty, betty, where are you? I've got a room full of people here Waiting for you to go over your concept. I'm gonna be a little late. - What, what?!  - Something came up with daniel. Oh, what a shock. You're bailing on something That I thought was important to you--for daniel, of course. I'm not bailing. It's just... His wife died, and he's not doing so well. And I don't think he should be alone, So I'm just gonna work from here, And I'll get there as soon as I can. Betty, this is your concept meeting. Yeah, betty, thanks a bunch. Well, can you just run it? I mean, you know what the concept is. Fine. I guess your new job just can't compete with your old one. Good news. I can stay a little longer. - Oh, Betty, I can't ask you...  - You don't have to ask. "Mode" magazine, please hold. - You hung up on them, right?  - Totally. That felt so good. Thanks so much for letting me do this. It really takes me back. I cannot believe that you were a receptionist, too. Best 20 years of my life. You know, being the face of the company... Deciding who gets to come in and who - Well,you know.  - Yeah. I pretty much run this place. Mm. So why'd you give it up? Oh,I didn't... Exactly. I guess one day,people decided that... You know what? You'll find out. Wait,no. Tell me. There just comes a time when they don't want yours To be the first face that people see anymore. So what do you do then? This. I mean,my life is still the same,hon. I still do as little work as I have to And go out every night,meet people. I'm not worried. Ooh,someone will marry me... Or make me a part of their entourage Or,or,ooh! Uh... Make a reality show about me. It's all good. Ooh,you know what? I gotta tinks... Sorry. I just tried to talk to Justin, And he wasn't saying much. Has he,uh,talked to you yet? No. He says I don't understand him. But Bella Santorini is gonna fix all of that. What are you talking about? I created a fake online profile. Bella friended Justin,and if he accepts, I have my way in. You can't be serious. what am I supposed to do? He doesn't want to talk to me, So I thought this is a good idea. Hilda,this is not a Hilary Duff movie. What? Justin had that Hilary/Haylie period, And maybe I'd watch,too. Those girls are very talented. Well,I... I don't know what to do. We were always so close,you know? And now everything is changing, And it's like I don't know what he needs Or how to help him. That's exactly how I felt when you were a teenager. believe me,you let me know many times and in colorful language That I didn't understand you. - So what did you do? - You don't remember? There were some years you barely talked to me,mija. This is being a parent. I wish I could tell you there was an easy solution. - Well,I can't do this. - Oh,Nico,calm down. I can't calm down,mom! I don't want talk to detective what happened that night You're gonna have to talk to the detective. No,mom. I can't go back there. I don't want to remember it. It was Jonathan. We were on his boat and he.he was yelling at me. - Well,why was he yelling at you?- I don't know! - Well,think. - He just... Sometimes things set him off. But this time was different. He grabbed me and he hit me. He just kept hitting me. I was so scared. I grabbed something to defend myself--anything! And I started hitting him back,again and again. I didn't know what to do. So I...I pushed him. Over the edge. And he didn't come up. Nico,I know it's hard,but we will get through this. And you will never have to relive that night again, Because we will invent a new one. Oh,my god! - I'm sorry. - We are way beyond "sorry" at this point,Betty. Yeah,well,I don't know what else to say. And I am sorry. Look,there's no time. We've got a big problem with Roberto Dipaolo. - He's threatening to walk. - What?! I don't have a problem. Everything is fantastic. And what an honor to be here at the United Nations. Oh. Great. Well,if there is anything you need,just let me know. Oh,of course. Mmm,you are such a darling! Uh,and I love all the...the things going on here. Oh,thank you. Roberto is not happy. Um,he seemed okay No,not happy! Roberto doesn't like to be the bad guy. He hired me to be unhappy for him. So why don't you take me through what you were doing The night of your boyfriend's disappearance? Go ahead,nico. We have no secrets. Well,um,we were both kind of depressed. Jonathan just dumped me. my mom recently lost a child I'm sorry. I didn't know. Yes,but we move on, Which is why Nico and I wanted to spend some "us" time A night where we could just forget about everything else. We started by going to see "the proposal." Oh,did we laugh... And cried. And then we went to serendipity for frozen hot chocolates. Women will do anything to get their chocolate. And then we came home And watched a "Gilmore girls" marathon Until we fell asleep. We're just like that. Except they talk so fast. I swear,they make me dizzy. And I had just stopped being seasick. Seasick? Why were you seasick? We took a water taxi to see the city at night. Yes,I know it sounds like a romantic thing, But we didn't care. Sometimes you just need to Do those kind of things for yourself. Okay. I think I have all that I need for now. I'll be in touch. Thank you,ladies. I did dipaolo's contracts that was what you asked me to do. Okay,great. Well,there's a problem with his rider. There's supposed to be an assortment Of fun-sized chocolates in his greenroom,but apparently-- Betty,you asked me to do his paperwork, - Not go shopping for snacks. - Right. But I thought you would just,you know,do it. Okay,it's darling that you thought this shoot Would somehow come together without you to guide it. I've been guiding it. Of course you have. Some friendly advice from a senior editor-- No one is your friend. If you want something done right, You do it yourself. I could've given you this advice last night While we were working late,but... Where were you again? Okay,you made your point. What is going on here? I wouldn't know. I don't speak russian, And I don't think those two speak any english. Um,ladies,excuse me? Ladies? - where's Suzanne? She's in charge of models. - over there. Suzanne! Now I know you asked her to book international models. - Did you ask her to book interpreters,too? - Inter--what? Um,Olga,no. No hitting! Please,you're gonna tear the dresses. Suzanne! I mean,she was a receptionist just like me, And now the highlight of her day is getting groped - By serge the doorman? - That's the highlight of your day. - I know. - Mandy,look. We've discussed this. When your looks start to go,we are buying you new ones. I know, I know. But it's not just that. I guess I assumed things would always come to me Because I'm pretty. Well,as long as people only look at your left side, They will. But what if they don't,Marc? What if things don't just come to me? What if I have to go to things? I think I want more than this. I can't be a receptionist forever. Oh,my god. This is really huge. what are you gonna do? I'm gonna send the phones to voice mail And go drink my face off. Hey,Marc. Hi. Can I talk to you for a second? That depends on how much finger-wagging and lip-smacking there's going to be. None, unless you keep that up. Stop! Sorry, I'm just... I'm here to talk about Justin. I haven't said a word to him. I know, I know. I need your help. I need you to help me figure out How to get Justin to start talking to me again. Well,that's your first mistake. He only came to me because he wants To talk to someone who understands him. I understand him. He just thinks that I don't. - You're his mom. - So? There are a couple of areas Where... I have an edge. Well,it's just... It's not easy to see your son Going through something so hard, And I want to do something. Well, you care about what happens to him. Not everybody has that. Well, do you think maybe you could talk to him? I mean, if he-- If he comes to you again? - Yeah, I could do that.  - Okay. Oh, uh, just... If it's something really big,maybe you could tell me? Oh. Well, I-I-- Yeah, I could do that. Okay. They are from different countries. Olga's from Georgia, and Tatiana's from Russia. Oh. Okay, so-- So they're fighting Because their countries are at war? She's saying, "that bitch stole my boyfriend." "I will kill you, you insect-ridden whore." Okay, I get the picture. Thank you. - Betty, how's everything going? - Hey! Great! Good! What's going on there? Oh, nothing. They're just hungry. I'm so glad you're here and looking rested. Oh, thank you, again, for last night. Don't mention it. Would you excuse me just one second? Can you tell your friend I have to go back to the nuclear disarmament talks? Maybe turn it a little bit this way - so the stingers...  - Where did that thing come from? This is a photo shoot about malaria. Which is caused by mosquitoes. So why do you want a smiling mosquito? Is he happy because he caused some malaria? This is your concept, Betty...mosquitoes, malaria, But also happy. That's what you said, remember? I didn't say happy mosquitoes! Who wants to see an angry mosquito? Who wants to see a mosquito at all?! You know what? You weren't there at the concept meeting, So don't blame me If you let something slip through the cracks. Matt. you know I was helping Daniel. Exactly. And that is why You have a smiling mosquito at your photo shoot. - You happy now?  - No, I'm not-- Unlike that mosquito. You know what? I don't know why I'm surprised. I mean, this is totally typical of you. You make a big commitment And then just abandon it at the last minute. That is so unfair. We're not even talking about the shoot anymore. Yes, we are! I am supposed to be your boss--me. You should've been here, Not out with Daniel doing whatever. You're not his assistant anymore. And, you know, what were you doing all night, huh? Are you two, uh, sleeping together now, too? I don't know what to do with these girls. Ladies, please! Please! That is expensive! I'm sorry, Mr. Dipaolo. Please don't go. We can fix this. I can get different models. Don't leave! Ladies! I need you to stop right now! Is there anybody here who can help me with these models?! Anybody?! What the hell is going on here?! I can explain. You know what? I don't even know why I asked that question. I don't care. Your shoot is falling apart-- Your shoot for my magazine! It's my magazine, too, Wilhelmina. Well, then start acting like it. You're punching out your employees. Even I know not to do that in public, Daniel. I'm throwing you both out. - What?!  - What?! I'm taking over the shoot. You're both leaving, And we're losing that ridiculous mosquito! That was... That was Betty's idea. You can't throw me out, Wilhelmina. And I'm sure as hell not gonna let you throw Betty Out of her own shoot. - Daniel...  - No, let me finish. You have to understand one thing-- You mess with Betty, You're messing with me. You got it? That goes for every single one of you! Daniel, please stop. We'll leave. What?! She's right. You just assaulted somebody. They could arrest you, so let's just go. - I'm sorry, Wilhelmina. - I am, too. I had hoped that you were changing, But obviously, I was wrong. I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it. Count 'em-- Five motivations! Mind if I join you? Or is "wipeout" something you need to do alone? How's everything at school? Yeah, it's fine. Good. But if it's ever not fine, And you need someone to talk to--not me-- You know, it's fine. I talked to Marc. Yeah. So everything's... Everything's okay. I am sorry That I stuck my nose in your business. It's just... I worry about you. I know. But you're growing up, And I can't tell you who to be friends with, And I can't tell you who to confide in. I just hope that you know That if you ever do need someone to talk to, You can talk to me. Even if I don't... understand you. Okay. You shouldn't have hit Matt like that, you know? Yeah, well, he was being a jerk. Yeah, that might be, But you still shouldn't have punched him. Okay. Then why are you smiling? Fine! I can't help it. He was being a jerk. He deserved it. But it still wasn't the right thing to do. Look, I know. I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. I, I messed up. Daniel, I've been worried about you. Ever since you got back to New York, it's like you're... Angry? Yeah. I am angry. Betty, I'm... I'm so angry at myself. I'm angry I couldn't... Help... Molly. When you told me what was going on at the office, I guess I just thought, finally, I could help someone. - Daniel  - I know I shouldn't have hit Matt, But I'm so tired... Of feeling helpless. I think you need to talk to someone. Look, not, not your family, Maybe not me, just... Just someone. Listen... I think you might have made a mistake. What do you mean? You decided to help me instead of doing your job. You're not my assistant anymore. Things are changing, for both of us. We have to accept that. Well, what if I don't want 'em to change? Well, why don't you want them to change? They could get better. I guess. I just I just don't want to lose who I am. Listen to me. You are not the same person I met three years ago. Betty, you've already changed. But you're still you. So... How does this work now, you and me? We're not "boss" and "assistant" anymore. No. We're friends. Friends. Good morning Good morning. You are not gonna believe it. I made my very first house call. It's like I'm a doctor, you know, but for hair. Aw, man. - Oh, your glasses broke again?  - Yeah. I'll get you some tape. Oh, hey. Do you want me to cut your bangs? No. I think I'm okay. I might try something different. Well, all right. Good morning, Amanda. Something's different. - You got your braces off!  - No, I didn't. Oh, you shaved. Betty. Oh, it's not that funny. Hi, sweetie. Hey, babe. Hey, are you leaving? Yeah, they kind of fired me yesterday, But I just came by to pick up some of my stuff. But you're a temp. You don't have stuff. Well, I do now. Oh, hey, wait. In case you miss it. Thanks. That's, like, the nicest thing anyone's ever gotten me! Hello, "Mode" magazine. No, uh, I don't know where she went. I... I'm sorry that Daniel hit you. Yeah, me, too. And I'm also really sorry That the UN Shoot almost fell apart. I take full responsibility for that, And I promise, it will never happen again. I hope not. You know, Matt, I will always regret what happened between us. I made a mistake, and I can't change it. But I have to move on now. I've worked very hard to get to where I am now, And I'm not about to give up. Oh, and for whatever it's worth, Daniel won't be interfering on my behalf anymore. I can fight my own battles. So, uh, next time, you're gonna hit me? Yeah. No, no, no. It's our pleasure. Nico and I want to get to the bottom of this mystery as much as you do. Thanks. He bought our story. Oh, thank god. That's such a relief. Well, it's a good first step, But we can never let our guard down. That's when you get into trouble. You got a delivery while you were out. I signed for it, so I hope it's nothing illegal. Oh, my gosh! I finally found some fashion-related decor for our office. You're gonna love it. That's fashion-related? Guadalajara Betty, do you want a ride? Actually, I have my own. You know, when you're an editor and you work late, You get your own town car. Not so bad, is it?
