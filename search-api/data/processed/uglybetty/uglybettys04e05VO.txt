your arroz con pollo is dry. It's not meant to be reheated. I'm sure it will still be delicious. I'll see you soon. Love you. Bye. Uh,sorry. Sorry,sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. W-- that's okay. I'm sorry. I-I just came by to say, I really liked your pitch for a "green" issue. Wilhelmina was wrong. It did not "reek of recycled manure. " thank you. And I-I really liked your "get sporty" idea. You were not "nothing but nose hair" while you were pitching it. and I've also been meaning to tell you, I'm really digging your new look. Oh,thanks. I'm sorry,I have to do this. your hair was caught. Thank you. Have a good night. You,too. hey,I thought we were leaving together. Oh,marc,you can't honestly be asking me to stay any later. I'm exhausted. I've been working since 9:00 A.M. Without a break. And by "working," do you mean "gossiping" and "complaining"? Hey,mandy-licious. hey,matty-licious. - are you okay,marc? - Oh,yeah,I'm fine. I just got a piece of corny stuck in my throat. Amanda,listen. Wilhelmina thinks that some of the "real" people we shot for the "real people" column were a little too "real. " so I was wondering if you wouldn't mind staying just for a bit, just to go over pictures. absolutely. No problem. I love staying late. somebody's in a rush to get out of here. Oh,I'm just trying to avoid hartley. Plus,I wanted to meet natalie for this whole group meeting. Oh,yeah. How is that going? Goodactually you know,it's really helping me al with losing molly. That's great. By the way,I've noticed you and matt have been a little chummy lately. Anything you'd care to report? Um,no. Not at the moment. But maybe I'll have some news for you by the time we have our lunch tomorrow. That's right. Uh... our first ever non-professional,just friends lunch. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna lp you go through your rum to find a new assistant, because clearly,you forgot that we even had a lunch. Betty,how could I ever replace you? well,what an unpleasant surprise. Wait,uh,wilhelmina? I want you to know how much I respect all the work you've been doing in tibet. It's a very special country to me because it was very close to molly's heart,so thank you. why the hell was pasty-face hugging me and mumbling something about tibet? Oh,um,that might... be because you're being honored at the annual "style cares" charity event. - Why? - Uh,because-- you-- mm-- - you give a lot of money to orpha in tibet. - When? - Over the past five years. - How? Uh,through,a tax-deductible charitable foundation set up by your accountant and someone. - Who? - Me. But I only did it because your accountant told me to. But the good news is,you don't have to traipse across town to some tired old ballroom for the event because the honore always hosts the event in their own home... so that more money can go to the orphans. And when,exactly,were you going to tell me about all of this? The day before the event,so you'd have less time to hit me. Think of the tiny baby orphans... and your public image. I suppose you do make a good point about my public image. But who the hell would get excited about a charity event? I've been invited to a charity event! And it's at wilhelmina'S. atilhelmina's apartment? How exclusive! Can you steal me something-- like a napkin,an olive,anything? Oh,my god. Look at you. Last year,you had to steal a dress to get in. Now you're totally legit. Well,being an editor has its perks. Well,getting your dinner at the right temperature certainly isn't one of them. Sorry. I'm making this about me. So... who's gonna be your plus one? I don't know. Um... I mean,maybe,I'll... invite matt. What?! Are you crazy? After everything that has happened? Hilda,come on. I know what this sounds like, but things have been going really well between us. And I know that there is still something there. And what better place to start over than a party,huh? I mean,that was-- that was incredible! During that last focus exercise,I got to this place of... I mean,I don't even know how to describe it. - It was... - I know. It-- it was so peaceful! I know. I feel the exact same way. It's like I feel closer to robbie than ever. God! I can't believe I am saying all this. I was such a sour bitch before you knew me. Wait,um,"before"? Oh,you know what really sucks? Once I get back to work, all this stress starts coming in from all sides,and I just... I lose this great feeling I have right now. Oh,hey. You know,if you ever need any help or guidance or whatever... I'm always available. You know that,right? Well,maybe I should just hire you as my personal guru. Oh,please! I could really use the money. you know what? I-I just had a crazy thought. will you be my plus-one? Betty - Hey. - Hey. I'm glad you're here. Actually... there's something I've been meaning to ask you about wilhelmina's party. - Really? - And let-- let me preface my question by saying you really don't have to say yes. In fact,I'd be perfectly fine if you said no, because I'm not really even sure it's a good idea. Matt,I'm sure it's a great idea. All right,then. Would you be okay... - yes. - If I brought a date? Yes. Of course. That'S... great that y-- why wouldn't it be okay for you to bring a date? That's great. Cool,cool. Um... and I'm sure you'll probably be bringing someone,too. - Yep. - Great. Yep. Yes,I'm bringing someone. So... so... now it won't be awkward for either one of us, uh,to see the oer one with another person, 'cause we'll both be there with other people. Yay. hey,look! There's,uh,katie from sales. Yep,there she is. Anyway,I'm glad you're so cool with the whole date thing. Oh,yeah. No,I'm cool with it. I'm more than cool with it. I'm freezing with it. brr! please tell me you did not say that! Well,what was i supposed to say? You shouldn't have said anything. You should've decked him. Hilda,you were right. I don't know why I keep hoping that things are gonna work out between me and matt. - I'm so stupid! - You are not stupid,okay? You were just following your stupid heart. I know it's ridiculous. It's just,I can't help but feel replaced. That is not true! You are one of a kind,betty suarez,and don't you ever forget it. Nobody could ever replace you,okay? Okay. Look,I gotta go I'm meeting daniel. Bye. hey. Betty,hey. I finally replaced you. Meet natalie,my new assistant. -=http://bbs.sfileydy.com=- Proudly Presents</font> -=http://bbs.sfileydy.com=- Sync: Â¿Â¨Â»Ã’ </font> ugly betty 0405</font> You really think it's a good idea to hire someone you met in grief counseling? I mean,doesn't she know all sorts of personal things about you? Won't that be kind of weird? Actually,it's kind of great. I'm super comfortable with her because she knows me so well. You know,it's kind of like I found another you,betty. Well... what kind of office experience does she have? Didn't you say she was a-a massage therapist? Turns out that requires a lot more paperwork than you'd think. Plus,she's so excited to be here. I mean,she got a new haircut and everything. Oh,you did notice. I did. It looks great. Thanks. Can you help me with these phones? I just pressed this button,and there was a really loud squeak. Uh,hey,you know what? Betty,can you give her a quick orientation? Do you mind? No,of course not. wow. You'd be a knockout in that. Is that what you're wearing to wilhelmina's party? no. Some dumb editor is,because only dumb editors get to go to the party. Not that I want to go to a dumb editor party anyway. It's so dumb. Oh,really? Well,that's too bad because I was gonna invite you. But if you think it's dumb-- dumb? Who said it was dumb? No,no,no,no. You're right. Hanging out with a bunch of editors-- it sounds boring. But it would at least be fun if you were there. - It would? - So what do you say? I have to check my calendar. What do you know? I'm free. What time? well,I have to come straight from a meeting, so I'll be late,but you come whenever you want, and find me when you get there. Okay. what? You're going with betty's matt? Isn't that going to break her pudgy little heart? Marc,it's just that matt makes me feel smart and pretty. Can't you just be happy for me? I'm sorry. It's just that I assumed your attraction for baby fartley startearted and ended with his money-filled pockets, but now I see you actually like this guy. I do. I can't help it. He completes me. Oh,mandy! You're having real feelings! now I am happy for you! don't be happy for me. I'm gonna break betty's pudgy little heart. - I hate feelings. - Well... - marc,when did i get so deep? - I don't know. Look,why don't you just t go to the party with matt? That would be the selfless thing to do. no,seriously. You can either tell betty the truth,pray she doesn't show up, or,you know,find some way of cushioning the blow. no,those really are your options. so in order to write your speech for tomorrow, I just need to get a feel for who you are. For example,what inspired you to help tibetan orphans? Marc! Many years ago,ms. Slater embarked on a soul-searching pilgrimage to the tiny village of tawang,high in the himalayas. It was here that she experienced a holy vision, which brought her to this organization,and ultimately... her life's mission. - now holy v-- - bup,bup! Wilhelmina slater's office. Uh,y-- uh,hold on just a minute. It's nico. She sounds upset. Darling,what's wrong? Don't say another word. willie,you're coming back,right? Willie? You've got what you need,right? All righty. Uh,I'll show you how to check the messages. you've reached betty suarez,assistant to daniel meade,editor-in-chief-- greeting deted. Now how do I do a new one with my voice? You have your files backed up,right? - I do. - But it's-- - great. - In the trash. - Okay. - Awesome. I like to keep his messages on this side. Yeah. I'm gonna keep them on this side,so he can grab 'em as he walks by. Well,I think he's pretty used to me handing them to him. Hey,this is convenient,thanks. Betty's Computer Natalie's Computer all right,so that's about it. Well,thank you so much for your help. Ok. Oh! Don't forget this. - Oh,thanks. - Yeah. Like I was never here. Oh,will you-- uh! Daniel meade's office. Can you remind daniel that we have a lunch? - Yeah. Uh-huh. - great. Yeah,no. This is natalie. Yeah,I'm his new assistant. Yeah. Sure. I'm not surei'mhat looking at,detective castelar. Is that a smudge of dirt? It's a thumbprint. In blood. Eh,if you say so. I'm afraid that you're not a terribly good photographer. I found the print on jonathan vieja's boat. It's his blood. The print belongs to your daughter. Well,nico spent a lot of time on that boat. They were dating. I'm not sure what you think that proves. I've worked for jonathan's family before-- covering up his messes. Your ex-boyfriend was not a nice guy,was he? He had a temper-- especially with women. You know,maybe I'm not being clear. I don't think she's lucky. I think she killed him. I think she dumped the body overboard, I think she got some help cleaning up her mess, and I think you missed a spot. Well,if you think I do my own cleaning, you don't know me very well. I'm not the kind of person you'd want as an enemy,mr. Castelar. I've written a number on the back of that picture. I prefer cash. are you actually trying to blackmail me? well,that's adorable. But it doesn't go like that, so get out. mom,what are you doing? You'reot gonna pay him? I will do what I always do. I'll beat him at his own game. But he knows everything. I don't want to go to jail. You won't go to jail! I'll handle this. I know what I'm doing. Ugh! Everyone is talking about this ridic charity event. If you ask me,it sounds like a real snooze-fest. I'm sure a super-fun girl like you isn't going,are you? Of course I'm going. I'm an editor. I was invited. Why wouldn't I be going? Why so upset-y,betty? sorry. I'm just in a really weird place. Daniel just hired a new assistant and matt invited someone else. Did matt say who he was taking?! - No. - Oh. Wait,are you going by yourself? - No! - Oh. - Who are you bringing? - I don't know. Amanda,what's with all the questions? Nothing. I just wanted to ask because... I know some great guys I could set you up with. Oh. Thanks. But,um... I think I'm gonna ask a friend. Maybe we should just hear him O. Mom,the "wit and whimsy" column has been in "mode" for 60 years. I'm not gonna cut it just to make room for ads. I'm sorry. I have to draw the line. Well,maybe you can draw that line somewhere else. You know,I'm putting a lot of money into this company. Of course I do. You rarely waste an opportunity to remind us of that fact. all I'm saying is,it would be nice to see a little return on my investment. You can understand that,can't you,son? Don't call me "son. " Right. You've both made your opinions very clear. Maybe we should all just think this over for a bit. Fine. Let's do that. mm! There you are. And there's natalie. So natalie said how much fun you guys had earlier, so I thought you wouldn't mind if she joined us. Nope. What's to mind? - And for you? - Just an iced tea for me. - You got it. - Yeah,thanks. - Oh,you're not eating? - No,I'm on a special diet. Oh. I mean,sorry,what is that? This is maca-greeny and cheese. - Guess who gave me the recipe. - Um,gloria? Of course. but this is actually good. who's gloria? She's this weird woman from group. Oh,she is not weird,she's eccentric. She wears leg warmers every single day. the point is,she only eats green foods because she thinks they help her phase better. what is-- what's "phase"? Oh,it's this exercise that we do. - Involves breathing. - Yeah,it's-- it's kind of hard to explain. Okay. um,so you were gonna catch us up on things with you and matt,right? oh,yeah. Daniel told me about you guys. You're getting back together or something? Um... uh,no,actually. I don't think that's gonna be haing. Uh,I did think that maybe there was still something there, but apparently,he didn't, because he's taking someone else to wilhelmina's party. Oh,I'm sorry. No. I mean,thanks,but it's fine. Anyway,I was thinking-- you know how I used to always be your plus one at work events? Well,how do you feel about being mine thi this time? Actually,um,I was already gonna bring someone... oh. Right. Of course. Duh. I mean,you're the new me,huh? - Yeah. - But you can totally come and hang with us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,yeah. Yeah,that would be fun. This is. The writers finished a draft of your speech. I think it's appropriately faux-modest,yet preachy. You should probably take a look at it,though. Ugh,I don'tare. Are you okay,willie? I was worried when you raced out of here this morning. Everything is fine. But I ed you to do some research. See what dirt you can dig up on this-- no. Willie,please. I'm sorry,but I can'T. I took this job because I wanted to be a fashion editor, not blackmailer or a digger of dirt or-- fond as I am of ascots and monocles-- a junior detective. I'm sorry. I can't spend one more moment of my life scrounging around in dumpsters, looking for horrible information on people. Enough is enough. I-I can't do it anymore. I'm sorry. Nico killed her boyfriend. I covered it up. This detective is blackmailing me,and I don't have the money. I need to find out something on this guy or we both go to jail. Uh,I'll get right on it. amanda,hey! I'm going to wilhelmina's party. - You found a friend? - No. - You found a date? - No. - You found your dad? - No. You're setting me up. - I'm taking you up on your offer. - No! Okay. And then four pages of minis-- we're calling it "the thigh's the limit," and that's february. Great. Um,but where's the "wit and whimsy" column? I was told that column was being cut. No,it's not being cut. I was very specific about that. Well,that's the message I got from your mother. What? I don't care if he's in a meeting. Oh,my god! oh,my god. Daniel! I should have told you before about cal and me. I don't want to hear about it. But you deserve to know. We were involved before. It was a long time ago,when your father and I were going through a particularly-- no,wait,. Are you saying you had an affair with him? Please,I'm trying to-- stop! Okay? Don't talk to me. I told you,you should have let him go. That's easy for you to say,but I'm not that kind of a parent. Maybe we just don'tthink the same when it comes to our kids. You know,maybe it's better that things didn't work out with ours. Why would you say something like that? You have no idea how hard that was for me. I'm sorry. finally! Everybody's here already. spicy little tamale. these are all your friends? Yep. And they're all here to meet you. Well... amanda... you said it was a mixer. Instead,it's a bunch of guys and me. God,would you stop talking about matt already! What? ! Who said anything about matt? Betty,he has moved on. You don't need him anymore. Just get it together! - What? - Betty? Hey,it's,uh,it's andy. Andy,my favorite barista. you gave me a free cookie with my coffee the other day, and I never got to thank you,so... - thanks. - Yeah,yeah. No,happy to do it. I-- c-can I get you a drink or some chips or-- um,yeah,sure. I'll have some wine. Great. hi. I'm here about the ad you put in craigslist-- shh! Shut up about that! We're all friends here,okay? Friends! what's your name? oh,I j-- I can't get that image out of my head! My mother and-- and him? What I-- what is that thing called after the soldiers go through the war? - Post-traumatic stress disorder? - That's it. Okay,you've been writing an angry e-mail to your mother for over two hours. Mm-hmm. So? Remember in group when bennett was talking about "brain-drainers"? You know,people who create unnecessary drama? You know,look,don't get me wrong. I've only been here for a day,but... I've sn a lot of drama. I mean,your mom,this guy hartley,betty... now wait a second. Hartley,yeah. My mom,maybe. But not betty. No way. Well,you know,she just seems a little needy. you know,when she asked you to go to that party with her and you said no and she acted like she was fine with it? She wasn't fine with it. Yeah,but her ex-boyfriend asked someone else to the party. Yeah,drama. I don't want to seem harsh,but isn't this what you were complaining about-- all this stress coming at you and ruining your clarity? I don't think it's coming from you. Actually,I've only ever been to mexico one time. And were all the women as beautiful and voluptuous as you? oh,wow. I don't even know how to answer that. Um... Uh,will you excuse me just one second? Amanda... this is gonna sound really weird, but your friend is putting your stuff in his bag. Oh,no,that's just... joe. He's kind of a klepto. It's totally cool. hey,are you into me or not? 'Cause if you're not,I'm gonna answer this other ad. - Okay,jerry,you're a little drunk. - Did you just say "other ad"? - Okay,get out of here. - Did he just say "other ad"? I do not know what he was babbling about. I think he probably a little jealous that you are so into dean. - Andy! - Same thing wait,th is your craigslist ad,right? What? ! No,no! "Hombres,are you into plus-size chicas? "! Amanda! You did this? ! Way to stick to the plan,guys. okay,everybody calm down. Why don't you come over here, eat some more dip and we can all just talk a little? Look,guys,I'm sorry. I don't know why she thought it was a good idea to bring you all here, but I can't do this,so bye. Okay,this is what we're gonna do-- we're just gonna go to a couple bars, - maybe see who's cruising the high line. - Amanda,just give it up! - wait,wait,wait,betty. - she wasn't that big anyway. mrs. Meade? Betty,I need your help. All right,marc. Tell me what we are doing here. Well,it turns out your dirty P. I. Is of the corrupt,b-grade,bridge-and-tunnel variety, and somehow got himself married off to a hoagie franchise heiress. - He has hoagie money? - Mm-hmm. What's,uh,what's he blackmailing me for? Well,princessunchmeat keeps him on a very short leash, so she wouldn't appreciate photos of her keeping him on an even shorter leash. Who the hell are y? We're looking for castelar. He's in there. I'll take it from here. She may want this. Hey,natalie? Where's daniel? I really need to talk to him. uh,he should be back any minute, but,uh,we're leaving for a group meeting, so I doubt he'll have time to talk. Well,he'll have tmake time. This is pretty important. - So is this meeting. - Daniel,hey. Uh,look,um,I just got off the phone with your mom. I think you should talk to her. She's really upset. She called you. Of course. Look,uh... I don't know why she's trying to involve you, but I'd really rather not talk about it right now. Daniel. Your mother's really hurting. I thinshe just wants you to hear her out. No offense,but maybe we should just let daniel work out his own problems. Um,no offense,but maybe you should just butt out and let daniel answer forimself,okay? Betty,you're being incredibly rude. Natalie's just trying to help me. She's my friend. Yeah,so are we. Daniel,your mom needs you right now. But,no. Instead you're listening to your new friend natalie? Is this like when I asked you to go to the party 'cause I can't stand to be there alone with matt, and,no,you're taking your new friend natalie? Okay,stop it. I don't know what's going on with you. I don't need this drama in my life,okay? that was really brave. bite me,baby. Oh,yeah. I hope you' enjoying this. Oh,yeah,baby,yeah. This is a different class of shoe than you're used to,detective. Smile! hey! Who the hell are you? ***** yes,I am. No. I mean,no,no,no,I'm not. Oh,hell! Did my wife send you? Aw. Oh,no. marc,this is not the man who's blackmailing me. But this is detective castelar. oh,damn it! Of course he didn't use his real name. He stole this man's identity 'cause he knew I'd try something like this. I should've seen it coming. So who's blackmailing you? been looking for you. were so good with your mother this morning. I almost believed you actually killed me. Thank you. I know she has the money,yet she still refused to pay you. We've got to amp this up-- give her a reason to pay. Jonathan,trust me. I know just how to play her. what do you want,amanda? Betty,please don't hang up. I feel so bad about what happened. Yeah,so do I. well,I just thought you'd have a better chanceat a love connection if we placed an adfor your special needs. Please don't be mad at me. I'm not mad. I know that inyour own warped,potentiallylife-threatening w, you're just tryingto be a good friend. Yeah. Totally. Hey,that guy andyleft his number if you want togive him a call. I'm not interested. I decided I'm not going. Really? Mm-hmm. Look,I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. What do you mean,you're not going to the party? Hilda,it's fine. It's not like anyone'sgonna miss me anyway. Daniel's off with hisnew best friend natalie and... and,and,and,what,betty? And,yes,hilda,matt is stillgoing with someone else,and it still sucks. I can'tjust walk in there alone. Yes,you can. It's so julia roberts from"my best friend's wedding. " I love that for you. Betty,why are youholding on so hard to matt? He has clearly moved on. Why don't you? I don't know. It's just,everything's changing so fast. Things are weirdwith daniel at work, and I just really thought thatmatt and I could he a future. I just wish one thingcould stay the same. Well,we're not going anywhere. So can't that beenough for you for a while? No. what am I doing? I've worked too hardto let someone else stop me from having fun at this party-- - a party i was invited to. - There you go! So what if I'm alone? Yeah,who cares? I deserve this,and I'm going. Oh... I forgot to get a dress. Oh,I got it! Mom,remember when you put ona ttle weight last spring? remember when I did what? - Let's not pretend. - Oh,no. I need scissors,threadand the dresyou wore to archie's fund-raiser.

I hope you realize how manychildren you've helped. yes. I'm all about the children. Are you okay,willie? No,I'm not okay,and it's all your fault. You broughtthis into my house-- this ridiculous spectacle! And l these people throwinginsane amounts of money on childrenI don't even know! And I can't evenafford to save my own child. Marc,what am I supposed to do? I thought I could handle it,but I can'T. Well,I can. I'm turning myself in. Oh,don't be ridiculous. No daughter of mineis going to prison. I'll have him killed. Okay. okay. You're not turning yourself in, and you,you're not killinganyone. What's with this family? Mama,we have no choice. If you can't pay,then I needto do this to save us both. ms. Slater?

Wait,he's here with that girl? How could heehere with that girl when he's supposed tobe here with... you? It's fine. Amanda,don't-- don't look so sad. It's-- it's not even as hard asI thought it was gonna be,so... really? 'Cause if I were you,I'd be devastated. anyway. Uh,what was that really hardthing you wanted to tell me? Nothing. Just,um... you look really pretty. That's not hard. That's nice. Well,it was hard for me. are youstill angry with me? I wasn't angry. I'm justsensitive about... our past. Sometimes,I think I made mistake. You were married,I was married. It's sad,but... that child hadno place in this world. people always ask mehow I got involved with an organization that helpstibetan refugee children. They usually say I'm in itfor the tax break,which I am. but the real reason-- my heart goes out tothose motherless children. They have no oneto fight for them,and that'swhat a mother does. Shnever gives upon her child. I will not rest untilI've raised enough money to help every one of those kidsget wh they need to survive. Because that'S... that's what I would dofor my own child. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. hi. Natalie,I believeI owe you an apology. I'm very glad daniel has found someone thathe can trust and rely on. I hopewe can be friends. I'd like that. uh... um,uh,I should get this. I'll let you two have a minute. Thank you for saying that. I'm sorry about the waywe left things yesterday. I didn't realize how weirdit was gonna be for you to watch someone take over yourold job,butet it. I do. If it's any consolation,it's pretty weird for me,too. Right. Well... I know thatyou're going through somethingreally difficult,daniel. I'm just glad that youdon't have to do it alone. Thanks. Excuse me. Of course. Here you go. **** I told you,we had to do this work thing. don't worry,I will get him back there. here you go. I'll take one,please. Hey,amanda,you made it. I'm glad you got in.

Yeah,I just didn'tthink it wasair that none of the support staffgot invited. I mean,you guys deserveto have fun,too,right? Right. Is one of those for me? no. Yes,hello. Uh,I-I wonderif you might help me. Outlook Adoption Agency I gave my son upfor adoption many years ago. I want to find him now. - hey. - Oh,hello. you look like a manon a mission.
