I was going for something new,you know-- well,don'T. I don't want any embarrassments at your debut. - Fix it by tomorrow night. - Coconut shell buttons?

Why would you keep the one connection we haveto mom away from us? It was your mother's idea,betty. Your grandmother hated me. - Why? - I was a cook. It was better her daughter staywith a husband who beat her than to be with me. The night we left,your grandmother said if rosa walkedout the door with me, she was dead to her. So they--they just never spoketo each other again? Your mother tried. She sent letters,pictures of you girls. They'd alwayscome back unopened. Tio,we're gonna be late for your appointment. Go.Go. It's about your visa. We'll talk about this later,okay? I wanna meet her. I don'T. She sounds like a monster. Hilda,she's our grandmother. Why do you want to meet someonewho doesn't want to meet you?

So far,I'm very impressed. We're showing someof tavares' best designs later. They are,like,so good. And the greasy pawsare on the prada. Hey,you know what'd be fun?Um,get me a drink. - Oh,sure. - Thank you. you werejust dee-smissed. Turns outhe's a mean gay. So what?You're a mean gay,too. Yes,but not to you. Um,yesterday you told memy head was too big for my neck. That wasconstructive criticism. - Well,what am I supposed to do about it? - I don't know. As a friend,my jobis only to point things out. oh,my god. Oh,my god. Oh,my god. wow. Well,just wow. It looks like"brad" is back. any preference for how we makeyour old man disappear?

I won't see youafter the lobby. So how farto this outlet mall? Clara saidit's about 2 miles north. Well,I better finda wedding dress there,because so farI have nothing.

You know,you were a lot smarterbefore you got engaged. Amanda,baby,they love my stuff! well,I'd hug you,but my greasy pawsmight ruin your shirt. Oh,I'm sorry about that. It's just that it's sucha big night for me,baby. then lose this jacket. What is thisstill doing here? I like it.It's one of my best. Coconut shell'sare the next big thing. But wilhelmina hates them.They make her eyes bleed. Listen,if you wantto get ahead in this business,you do not cross her. What would I dowithout you,huh? Come here. really? I think we're close. Aunt mirta said she livedright outside villanueva in a little blue house. - I hope it's still blue. - Well,I just want to go home. And to be honest,that quesadilla isn't sitting so well. Oh,really? Because usually,when you buy cheese cookedon a bus,it's pretty good. Betty,what are you hoping to get out of this? Hilda,I don't know. But afterwhat the curandera said and--and us finding outabout grandma, I just feel likeI'm supposed to meet her. Well,good luck,because I don'tthink she wants to meet us. - It is him. - What? Henry! Betty--ow! Wait! Wait,henry! Henry,wait! Betty! What the hellis going on with you? It was him,hilda. I saw it.It was henry. Henry? Out here? - Honey,you are hallucinating. - Oh,no.

Oh... are you kidding? When we first met,you couldn'tkeep your eyes off of me. Okay,that was beforeyou got your veneers. You had that dark tooth.I couldn't look away. - Big head! - Dark tooth! - Nicole bitchie. - Nelly ripa. It's sad and pathetic,mandy.He's gay. No,he's not. What? He's just pretending to be to get ahead in the fashion world. He's straight,and we aretotally seeing each other. O.M.G.,He's pretending to be gay? Well,that's a new twist on an old standard. Marc,you cannottell anyone. mandy,you're with another guywho's keeping you a secret. It's like danielall over again. No,this is not daniel. You are fabulous,amanda. Why do you think you don'tdeserve a real relationship? Come outof the closet,sweetie. I promise,it's better. It's okay.I know what I'm doing. Daniel,what the hellare you doing with jordan? Well,so far,just making out,but by later tonight I hope-- stay away from her. Oh,I love this. you're jealous. Finally,I get the one thingyou can't have. You know I guess you probablyshould have thought of that before you gave awaythe family jewels. Daniel. Daniel! What is going onwith you? You've neverseen me win before. Alex,this is me winning. I can't believeyou made me walk all this way in these shoes. My feet hurt,betty. - There's gotta be a bus soon. - Well,let's just forget it. Let's just live here,get jobs,watch our asses grow.

Betty,just give it up. you know,I'm gonna go askthat man over there selling dirty fruit. - You want some fruit? - No. Yes. You look like you could usea shot of tequila. Or two. Hola.Um... Do you know if there is a blue house near here? excuse me. - Henry! - betty,where are you going? Henry,wait! Hey,handsome. I'm giving you a ticket,'cause you aresmokin' indoors. Oh,my god. Mr.Meade. I'm so sorry.I had no idea. It's fine,marc.Thank you. you owe me. think of it as takinga bullet for the team. If he doesn't feel good abouthimself,he doesn't move on. If he doesn't move on,I don't move up. I'm sorry,I didn't mean to stare. I think your earis oozing. Oh... thank you. henry! missing branches... the blue house. hello? Hi,um... yolanda salazar? Hola.

I don't even knowwhat's going on yet. You're gonnaget hurt,jordy. Daniel's not in thisfor the right reasons. He's angry and he's tryingto get back at me. This is all about me. Of course it's about you. It has always beenabout you. It's probably whyI'm attracted to daniel. He's the closestI'll ever get to being with you. What do you want me to do? I want you to dowhat you should have done two years ago-- have the gutsto say good-bye. Good-bye,jordan. hey,I,uh,thinkI'm gonna go. What do you want me to do,walk you to the door? Good night,girlina. I think she's gota thing for you. Yeah,she would sleep atthe foot of my bed if I let her. Sad little hags always wantwhat they can't have. Oh,really? Well,apparently,that sad little hag can have it and has, in ways that are too disgustingto even think about. You could've had a realrelationship with that woman,and you would havebeen lucky, because she is one of the nicest,easiest girls around. - Marc...okay,maybe she's not nice. - Shut up! - What's the lesbiantalking about? - I don't know. Open your eyes,people.He's straight. As straight as the creaseon an old man's jeans. well,this ismy very first public "inning," and while it's interesting,I don't see how it's relevant. it isn'T. The one thing we are in the fashion industryis tolerant. If you look like that,you're in. The only important thingis the design. Well,then,should we startwith some of his favorites? I'm sorry to barge inlike this. I didn't meanto disturb you. Is it okayif I just...  s? I just...I wanna say good-bye. Rosa. My daughter!You've come back. no,no. No,no,no,I'm not rosa.

I will. you should have stayed a littlewhile longer at the party.It did geta little more interesting. I'm sorry,willie.I couldn't do it. I was a fool to think I could ever bebrad meade again. You know,I remember brad. He ran this placewhen I started. Plenty of women in the buildingwanted him. However,there was one womanwho wasn't interested. Me. I thought bradwas a fool, but bradgrew into bradford-- a strong,wise,sexy man-- a man who's ruinedall other men for me. Here's to starting over. Mm,that feels good.

I'm getting marriedin,like,a minute, and everythingis so freaking hard. I-I got no hall booked,I can't find a wedding dress-- it seems like all the signs aretelling you to not get married. Well,I'm not really a girlwho believes in signs. Too bad,because there is a reason why you cannot findthat dress. There is a reason why youwere brought here... to me. I know what you're doing,antonio. what?Who can blame me,eh? But am I right? Tell me,hilda,why is everything so hard? Hilda! - I found the house! - You did? Grandma gave me this.It was mom'S.
