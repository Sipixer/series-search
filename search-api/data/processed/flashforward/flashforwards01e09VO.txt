- I have to end this call now. My daughter's alive. She saw something she shouldn't have... and got in trouble with Jericho. The second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive,</i> they'll kill me. N.S.A. sent back a new rendering of Suspect Zero. - What's on his hand? - A ring? This morning, I was thinking  committing suicide. - My God. - Everything's changed for me now. - Who's she ? - <i>She was in my vision.</i> In my flash-forward, I saw this symbol. - It's a letter. - What's it mean? "Believe." See there, there... - and there. - It's metastasized. To the liver. No sign of it in the lungs or bones? We hoped this treatment would have stopped the growth. It doesn't seem to have had an effect. What about hormone therapy? You're stage four. It's not likely to do much except make you feel lousy. I... I feel all right now. That's not atypical for this type of cancer. I'm gonna be straight. We're running out of options. We could try another round of chemo. I have patients at this point who have gotten into clinical trials. How long have I got? Come on! What are you doin', man? Didn't you see me? I'm talking to you. What are you doing? No! Come on! All right. Come on! What are you, nuts? You made your point! This is a Cherry'63 T-Bird! I want to report a hit and run. He's still hitting me! You made your point! All right. Okay. It's all right. You are so dead, man. You hear me? You're dead! "Believe" Dr. Varley, she's oozing an awful lot. What was her platelet count, hemoglobin and coags preop? I'm sorry. Her platelets were... Platelets 80,000, hemoglobin 10.5. - Looks like a cirrhotic to me. - Is she a drinker, Dr. Varley? Sorry... Come on, Bryce. Maneesh, I'm gonna need some F.F.P. and 2 units of packed red blood cells as soon as you can get 'em. She's oozing everywhere we cut. Send a D.I.C. panel and hang a banana bag with two grams of mag. Dr. Benford, I'm sorry. You need to think seriously about whether or not you're committed to this profession. I don't know where I belong. I'm not a very good doctor. I never have been, really. It wasn't what you wanted? I don't know what I want. I just... did it. And now I'm here. Have you told your family, your colleagues about your illness? My family's been through enough, Dr. Flemming. With my dad dying of lung cancer for three years...</i> It was a nightmare. What about your colleagues? - Surely they would understand. - I don't want their pity. Pity ? You need support. That's what's gonna get you through this. Nothing is gonna get me through this. My diagnosis is terminal. You don't know what the future holds. None of us do, really. Your job is to take care of yourself to try and have the best life you can for as long as you can. Live each day doing what feels right. You're really here. Pleased to meet you. Hajimemashite. Please speak more slowly. Yukkuri hanashite kudasai. What's your name? O namae wa nan desu ka? I love you. Suki desu. Please sit down. Okakekudasai. How are you feeling today? Gokigen ikada desu ka? I hope you are well... Can you give me the directions? I am lost. Michi ni mayotte imasu. Who are you? Anata wa dare desu ka? What do you want? Nani o omotome desu ka? Hey, how is Tracy? She's... She's pretty shut down. Terrified Jericho's gonna come and find her. I've been looking into that for you. Unfortunately, private military contractors like Jericho and Blackwater are harder to break into than Fort Knox. - That's what I was afraid of. - <i>But this outfit's headquartered</i> in Santa Monica, right in our own backyard, working out of the Burroughs Foundation for International Peace... Some kind of think tank. - Think tank? - Yep. It's gonna take a higher security clearance than I have to get much beyond that. Hold on a sec. Livvie, your phone's ringing. - Can you get it? - I gotta go.</i> I'll put out some more feelers, all right? Who is it? Who was it? What is this? It's this weird text I got. Who sent it? I have no idea. Do you... figured you... you wouldn't mention it? You already told me about the drinking. Before I got a chance to bring it up. Since we talked about it, that didn't seem like such a big deal. I gotta get dressed. - Nice job with that tension pneumo. - Thanks. You okay? You look sick. - I'm okay. - Come here. I'm all right. You're not febrile, but you're really pale. Go home. Cynthia will cover your shift. I'm gonna be okay. I just need a minute. Come here. Come sit. - You look terrible. - I'm just tired. Graphia says you almost passed out during grand rounds last week. - What's going on? - It's nothing. - We don't need to do that. - Come on. Why do you have a central line? It's for the chemo. Chemo? I have... renal cell carcinoma. Stage four. How long have you known? About a year. Had my kidney out just before I started here. This is why you tried to kill yourself... I was terrified. I didn't think that I could face the prospect of dying. I didn't want to put my family through that. I can't believe you... have been going through this alone. I can't believe I didn't see it. It hasn't been that bad so far. It's rough for a few days after chemo, but then I bounce back. Anyway, since the blackout, things are different now. I'm gonna be okay. I've got something to live for. It's hot. I forgot the cheese. I don't need the cheese. This smells great. When I was in the military, this crazy staff sergeant in my detail made the best food I ever threw a lip on. What? I can't do this. Do what? Have you drinking here. It's just a glass of wine. Doesn't matter. A glass of wine... or a fifth of vodka... It just doesn't work for me. Come on, Dad. Relax. I'm not asking you to drink. That's not the point. I can't be in the same room as it. You understand that? After everything I've been through, I can't have a glass of wine? I'm 24 years old, and I've been through hell. I can't have a drink? Baby, I'm not talking about what you can or can't do. I'm telling you... what I can't do. This is good. Fine. I'll go somewhere else. The NSA's digital forensics team uncovered this symbol on Suspect Zero's ring. Alpha. And it could mean anything... The angle of attack in aerodynamics, the brightest star in a constellation. Alpha is the beginning of everything. If we can enhance the ring so well, why can't we see his face? We tried to rebuild that image from all the various camera angles that we got. But in one, his skin was all blown out. In another, it was a raking profile and so on. The ring was much easier. It has hard edges and a reflective surface. We captured still images as the hand moved. We replaced pixels and then built a 3-D model of it. Frankly, we were hoping the NSA would provide us an analysis of the ring that was a little more substantial. To tell you the truth, I'm a little uncomfortable talking in this particular group. Uncomfortable? Look, Mrs. Levy, we don't have time to play games. I'll be blunt, Mr. Wedeck. One of the members of your Mosaic task force has been red-flagged by the NSA. What? Who? A couple of months ago, our wiretapping program intercepted a phone call whose origins had been professionally concealed to a bureau cell phone. Whose phone? Agent Noh's. Since when do you guys wiretap the FBI? Homeland Security is the number one priority. - Homeland Security... - Wait a minute. Maybe it's the call... your call from the woman. - About your murder. - Right. Are you saying that you have a recording of that call? How do I get it? I'm sorry. It's classified SIGINT... signals intelligence. The woman who made that call told me I was gonna be murdered on March 15th. I'm running out of time, so if you have any information on who that was or why I'm going to be killed... - I'm not authorized to give... - Come on! Call whoever you need to call to make it happen then! How about that, Ms. Levy? Let me make a call. Benjwa... doko... Desu ka Los Angeles? You just said "Where is the toilet, Los Angeles?" Let me see that book a sec. It's so cool you're learning a language for someone you haven't even met. But I am gonna meet her. I know it. I'm hearing myself, and I sound crazy. But it's a good kind of crazy. Love crazy. You think? Hey. - Didn't see you there. - Yeah, I came in late. Yeah? What's up? I'm really struggling, Aaron. Things were going great at home, or better at least. Then this thing happened. Someone sent Olivia a text, telling her I was drinking in my flash-forward. Who would do that? I don't know. I only told two people. It's kind of freaking me out, you know? That's weird. You trying to say something to me, Mark? Like I said, I only told two people. Do you know how many hours I've spent listening to your crap, your doubt, your self-pity? - I thought you were my sponsor. - That's right. That doesn't mean I'm your punching bag. I think I have the right to ask you if you're communicating with my wife behind my back. You son of a bitch. After all the time we've known each other, you think I would do that? - I don't know what to think anymore. - You don't know. Don't know. Here's some food for thought. Why don't you get a new sponsor? Someone you can really trust. - Got it. - What? Demetri's phone call. I'm taking it down to audio forensics right now. - Can I ask you something? - What? Did you send Olivia a text? Your wife? - Why would I send your wife a text? - Well, someone did. Telling her I was drunk in my flash-forward. You're one of only two people I've told. So? So as... I recall you were pretty pissed that I was drinking and... the implications that had for our investigation. Oh, I see. You were thinking I was... so angry and so petty that I'd run out and text your wife about it? Get out of my office, Benford. I don't wanna see your face right now. Your accent is really improving, Dr. Varley. If nothing else, I'll come out of this having learned a second language. So how's the search for your young woman? Well, no response to my Mosaic posting yet, but I did finish my drawing. You wanna see it? She's quite beautiful. I was thinking about posting it on the web. At least you know where she likes to eat. What do you mean? Sushi Arahida. It's a restaurant in Tsukuba. Not that far from Tokyo. I taught at the university there. Is it possible there's more than one restaurant with this name in... Tsukuba? I doubt it, not with this same logo. It's a little, tiny place. She's probably a local. Ms. Kondo, in my flash-forward, I was sitting in a Japanese restaurant. Maybe it's this Sushi Arahida. - Maybe. - Thank you! Do you have a minute? Listen, maybe it's none of my business, but I made a few calls, did a little bit of research and there really are some good options out there. - I appreciate... - A friend from medical school, who's running an experimental trial with Trifectumab out of M.D. Anderson in Houston. So I made a call, and you're in. - Thank you. - No. You kidding? It's the least I can do. Here. I've read about Trifectumab. I'm not sure about the side effects, though. We're talking about your life. Now's not the time to be conservative. Dr. Benford, thank you. But you don't understand. Because of my flash-forward, I know that I have something to live for. I can't take a drug that might kill me or make me sicker. You're only gonna hear me say this once. Maybe the reason you're alive in your flash-forward is because you're gonna take this drug and get better. Don't give up on me. Please. Come here. Go to Houston. You need a couple of days, take a couple of days. There is no delicate way to say this,</i> but on March 15, 2010, you are going to be murdered. It's even worse hearing it a second time. We've analyzed the ambient noise, and we've come up with a potential lead. - What kind of a lead? - Listen to this. There is no delicate way... Now, I stripped away everything but the background noise. - We found... - You found cheesy electronic music. Not just any cheesy electronic music, my friend. It's the <i>Symphony of Lights</i>, the world's largest outdoor light and music show. Plays every night, in Hong Kong Harbour. Wanna take a little trip? I'm sorry, but I just can't send you to China after that C.I.A. idiot accused them of causing the blackout. Relations between us are tense enough as it is. Look, I want to solve Demetri's potential murder as much as anyone, but even if she made the call from Hong Kong, - there's nothing to say that... - She concealed the origins of her call. That alone makes her a suspect. We have to find out who she is and what she knows. I promise you, I'll have our legats guy in Asia track her down, but I need you here. You're not going to Hong Kong. End of story. We're going. What? Hong Kong. Wedeck's gonna be pissed. He'll get over it. I'm sorry. Is this your daughter, Is this your daughter? Is this your sister? They told me at the restaurant, that she lived here. Please, I came all the way from Los Angeles. Is this Keiko? Do you know Keiko? Keiko, please. I'm such an idiot. I travel more than 5,000 miles because of a T-shirt? - <i>What was I thinking?</i> - That you were going to find the woman. - But I didn't. - <i>Now you know her name.</i> - That's something. - <i>I don't know if it's her real name.</i> I went to the university. I went back to the restaurant. No one can tell me anything. I don't know how long I can wait, Nicole.</i> Maybe you're just trying to rush things that can't be rushed.</i> Sometimes, you just gotta be patient. Isn't that how love works? Maybe, I misinterpreted the whole thing. Maybe it's just... Some kind of fantasy. And a really good way to run away from my life.</i> Bryce, come home. Come home. Can I come in? What do you want? To talk. - I was out of line. - Yeah, you were. I've been a little stressed. You think you're the only one who's dealing with issues? Of course I don't. I know you're dealing with Tracy... You have no idea, so why don't you just shut the hell up? Tracy's back, but she's not the person she used to be. That person is dead. - Aaron... - No, you... You don't get it. She's broken, angry, scared. She drinks herself to sleep, every night. She's a messed up alcoholic. And I'm to blame... for all of it. She enlisted because she wanted to be just like me. And now she drinks. Just like me. There's not a damn thing that I can do about it. Look, we've crossed a line here... for better or worse. I don't think I can be your sponsor anymore. Sorry. But I could really use a friend. You got it. Welcome to Los Angeles.
