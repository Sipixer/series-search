Someone, please! Please! Demetri! Demetri! "No More Good Days" Good morning, Los Angeles. It's 7:00, and it looks like it's gonna be another beautiful day.</i> We're looking at light clouds and highs in the mid 70s today.</i> Keep that umbrella handy because we've got a chance of sprinkles later...</i> {\YOU'RE A CRAPPY HUSBAND I HATE YOU} I hate you, too. Babe, don't forget to look at the garage door. It's acting up again. Already forgotten. Bye. Just because I'm a squirrel doesn't mean I like acorns.</i> Smells good. Here you go, my princess. Te ayudo. - Hey, Hector. - <i>Buenos dias.</i> Hey, Nicole. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Don't worry. Olivia's working the late shift at the hospital tonight. - You can stay an extra hour or two? - No problem. - I've got studying to do. - You're a saint. Hey, this is Bryce. You know what to do.</i> Bryce, it's Olivia. You weren't around yesterday. You better have a damn good reason why. You call me immediately. I'm worried about you. {\3 MISSED CALLS DR OLIVIA BENFORD} My daughter Tracy was 5'5", 118 pounds. But... when the marines shipped her body back from Afghanistan... Sorry. Her remains... They weighed 37. Only reason I knew it was her at all was because they DNA'd what was left. So... I took a drink that night. You call Amanda yet? - Yeah, we're talking. - You're talking? Really? That's kind a weird because she told Olivia she never heard from you. I'm your sponsor. I'm the one who's supposed to be riding you, not the other way around. All right. I'm getting around to it. Come on, Aaron. Just call. She's cool. - Nurses freak me out, man. - It's a date. - She's not giving you a friggin' enema. - How do you know that's not my thing? - What's wrong? - I thought I heard Charlie. Charlie's asleep. - This is so wrong. - Which is why you love it. As soon as we're done, you have to get out of here. All right, well, stop talking and get to work. So then we get to the subject of the first dance, right? I'm sorry, but Zoey picks one of the corniest songs of all time... "Islands in the Stream." The old Kenny Rogers/Dolly Parton duet. Okay, and we used to sing it when we did karaoke, but that was when we were, like, really drunk, you know? I put up with it because we were dating, and that's what you do. But my friends will be there, my family. I cannot dance to "Islands in the Stream." I will never live it down. You don't care about any of this, do you? I do. I do care. I'm riveted. I'm fascinated. But, what do you want me to say, don't marry her? Don't marry her. The odds are against you anyway. That's good. Thank you. You're still married. I'm surprised Olivia didn't leave me a long time ago. Me, too, buddy. So what'd you guys dance to? I can't even remember. He's a holy terror. Terrible twos at one year. - You're lucky you have a girl. - Are you kidding me? You only have to worry about one penis. I gotta worry about all of them. Here we go. Showtime. Khalid, Omar, unknown female going mobile in a black S.U.V. You're on point. They should hit you in 20 seconds.</i> FBI. Janis Hawk. It's Benford. Get Wedeck. Suspects are on the move. Three weeks. Finally getting interesting. - Mark, I'm putting you on speaker. - What do you got? Khalid, Omar and an unidentified Caucasian woman. We're e-mailing you pictures right now. Who is she? That's the "unidentified" part, sweetheart. Get this to Digital Forensics and run it by I.C.E. They made us. They're on the move. Holy! Come on! Get some backup! Get some backup now! - All right, all right. - Suspects fleeing west on 6th! Black Escalade, license plate 8, "Queen," "Robin," 7-2-2, "Young." We need L.A.P.D. and air support now! - Drop! Car! - Calm down! - Car! - Shut up! - What are you laughing at? - I don't know. Never done this before. We need help! Please help me! - Dr. Benford, what happened? - I don't know. I lost consciousness. You okay? Nicole? - What happened? - I blacked out. Help! Demetri! Demetri! Calm down. All right, sir. Okay. Try to calm down. Look out! Mark! Over here! Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. We were driving, right? - I blacked out. - Me, too. Help me! - All right, move aside. Move aside. - Sorry. Excuse me. - Stay calm. We got you. - Yeah, got him. Get back! This thing could blow. All right, we gotta call this in! We gotta call 911. Trust me, they know. Try the office. See if they can tell us what the hell happened. Somebody! They're not moving! Help! Help! Please! Help! I need some help! Please, somebody! Help! Help! Just hold on! I'm a doctor! I'll be right there! Crap. Charlie! Are you okay? I had a bad dream. I dreamt there were no more good days. Can't get my family. - That's our SUV. - That's what I was thinkin'. Help me! Can you hear me? Go this way! Get up and move it around! Hands up! Hands up! I got her. Get out. Come on. Get out. Get out! We know you were planning an attack. What did you do? - Tell me! - Take it easy. We know about the suitcase. - Did you set it off? Answer me! - I blacked out. I was somewhere else. There was a storm. The horses were scared. What are you talking about? - What are you talking... - Calm down! Does this look like a dirty bomb to you? We don't know what this is. - Maybe they weren't even involved. - Are you guys cops? FBI. It's okay. - What happened? - I don't know. It's gotta be the big one. I mean, look. Look at this mess. - It's gotta be. - When's help getting here? Look, until emergency services arrive, we need to stay calm and help whoever we can, all right? - They ain't comin'. - What? I just heard on my radio, some guy in San Diego. They're dealing with the same thing. It's more than just L.A., man. Sit down. You move, I shoot. I can't get through to Zoey. What about Olivia? - No. - Listen, Zoey's in Seattle right now. But Olivia's close by, right? Hospital's 2 miles. You can make it on foot. - No, I can't just leave... - We can do nothing here right now. Okay? Go check on your family. Go! Help me! Look out! Move! Watch out! Look out, man! Hey! Son of a... There are thousands and thousands of injured people waiting for emergency... All we know for certain is that everyone on the planet seemed to have blacked out at exactly the same time. ... Confirming that the blackout was a worldwide phenomenon. Officials are...</i> Fire services and police services are completely overwhelmed at this time.</i> ... En este momento. My God. It's the whole world. ... Information as to the cause of the blackout.</i> Hospitals are overflowing. Fire services and police services are completely overwhelmed... Livy! Livy, I'm here. - Oh, thank God! I got ahold of you. - What about Charlie? Is she okay? She's fine. Nicole called. She can stay put till one of us gets home. - And you're all right? - <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i> We were in the middle of surgery and we all lost consciousness. Everyone. Patient died while we were out. I'm downtown right now. Same thing. So what? Everyone there blacked out? Yeah. We thought it was the hospital, but Corrie got a call from her mother in Chicago. Same thing happened there. Looks like it was global. Global? That's impossible. Oh, I love you, but, babe, I gotta go. All right, I love you. Livy? 8-year-old boy. Pede versus car, plowed straight through a fence at a school. - Head injury... - Dr. Benford! Bryce, where were you? Go get into your scrubs. Meet me in E.R. Okay, let's get him into trauma. You're gonna be okay, honey. I know, Olivia. How did you know my name? - What have we heard from Washington? - Same. Everyone's gathering intel. CIA, Homeland Security. Our various legats offices overseas. Nobody knows anything. - How's he doing? - He's taking a turn for the worse. I got no breath sounds on the left, possible punctured lung. He needs a left chest tube stat. We don't release the pressure soon, his heart will stop from beating. Sats dropping. - What is this? Worldwide phenomenon. - Near as we can tell. Every people losing consciousness at exactly the same moment. And for the same duration... 2 minutes, 17 seconds. How is that even possible? Where the hell is that chest tube tray? I need it <i>now!</i> We got no pulse. Blood pressure's 40. What are we gonna do? - Come on, sweetie. Hang in there. - Pulse ox 90. Pulse ox 80. We're dropping! - We're losing him! - No pulse. No pulse. Blood pressure's dropping. So we've eliminated nuclear launches, EMPs and chemical agents. A natural phenomena then? NASA's checking into more exotic explanations... Solar flares, gamma bursts, that kind of thing. But so far they've come up empty. What about the Vatican? Has the Pope chimed in yet? Let's get this chest tube in. Sats improving, B.P.'s normalizing. Pleur-evac. Doing great, buddy. Doing real good. Let's get him into the C.T. scanner, check out that head injury. Bryce, you close him up. Nice job. But you're not off the hook. I still wanna know where you were yesterday. We need to wrap our heads around the scope of this thing. It's now been four hours since the blackout. You shut off the consciousness of the entire human race for two minutes. What would the death toll be? How many cars collided? We have planes down at L.A.X. How many more across the country? Around the world? F.A.A.'s reporting 877 aircraft down in the United States alone. Air Force Two was one of 'em. The veep was on board. What about hospitals? Operations? Births that were in process. People probably died walking up a flight of stairs. Global projections are pretty staggering. What about the blackouts themselves, sir? What about them? Well, we've been saying people have been blacking out, but... that wasn't my experience. For me, it was... more like a dream, only more vivid than that. One second, I was in a car. The next... - I was somewhere else. - Yeah, the same thing happened to me. During the blackout, people seem to have experienced some kind of... hallucination. Except that mine didn't <i>feel</i> like a hallucination. - What's your point? - I didn't just lose consciousness. It felt more like my... consciousness went somewhere else. Like I was having a memory, only it... it wasn't of the past. It was of the future. I was in my office. It was night. It was 10:00 on the hour. I was looking out into the atrium, and I happened to see the date... April 29, 2010, about half a year from now. Hold on. April 29th? I saw the same date. It was on the news. Same for me, April 29th, 10:00 P.M. So you're saying what, everyone's consciousness just jumped forward six months to... April 29th? Crazy as that sounds, yeah. Sit down. Sit down! J.T., could you give me a hand? Thanks. We didn't do this. Even if you didn't, you were still planning on killing thousands of people. So stay still... and shut up. - You get ahold of Zoey? - Yeah, she's all right. - Mark, hey. You got a sec? - Sure. There may be a way to corroborate what we were talking about in there. - What do you mean? - Well, in my flash-forward, it was April 30th, 6:00 A.M., but I was in London, which is 8 hours ahead of the west coast, so it makes sense. Wait, "flash-forward"? What are we talking about here? I'll explain later. Tell me what you saw. I was having a meeting with our liaison at New Scotland Yard. I remember we were interrupted because... this bird just crashed into the window. The point is, I had a vision of Fiona Banks. Let's see if she had a vision of me. Inspector Banks. Fiona, this is Al Gough, FBI. I'm here with my colleagues in L.A. My God. I know why you're calling. You want to know what I saw. We all do. - <i>We were in my office.</i> - What was the date? - <i>April 30th.</i> - What time? I don't know. 6:00 in the morning. Don't ask me why it was so early. Something to do with the Rutherford case.</i> - Yes, and something interrupted us. - <i>Yes, a bird.</i> It flew at the window, broke its neck. So our visions were the same. When the worldwide blackout occurred earlier today,</i> people were undergoing brain scans at that exact moment.</i> So like MRIs or PET scans? That kind of thing?</i> Exactly. And in each of these cases, the hippocampus,</i> that's the memory center of the brain, was actively engaged</i> for the entire 2 minutes and 17 seconds.</i> These thought patterns are consistent with a waking experience.</i> People were not asleep. They were not dreaming.</i> So what did they experienced? By all appearances, memories of events that haven't occurred yet.</i> So everyone saw the future. But did they see the same future? - <i>Are these accounts consistent?</i> - <i>Well, they certainly seem to be.</i> Hundreds of thousands of people were watching news broadcasts,</i> reading newspapers, and their details seem to be the same...</i> Senator Glenway will be facing ethics charges.</i> The Dow will be on an upswing. There'll be food riots in Ghana and the list goes on.</i> A remarkably concise series of events are starting to come together</i> from that day. It's like a grand mosaic is being filled in.</i> Everyone on earth... Mosaic. That was the name of the investigation I was working on in my vision. It had to do with what caused all this. So, did you see anything in your vision that was helpful? Photographs, names, people of interest. If this really was the future we all saw, then I guess maybe they will be leads, but none of them - make any sense to me right now. - Anything else? - No, that was it. - What about you? What did you see? Nothing. I blacked out like everybody else and woke up on the road. What about our person of interest? Do we think she's involved? She's a dead end, if you ask me, and clueless as the rest of us. Well, circle back on it anyway. We're grasping at straws at this point. - Janis, you wanna share what you saw? - Yeah, I was... getting a prenatal sonogram. The baby was about 17 weeks, and it was a little girl. It was totally bizarre. But I'm obviously not pregnant. I don't even have a boyfriend. And you, sir? I was in a meeting. And I happened to glance down at the paper. Sports page. The Rays rallied from 3 runs down to sweep the Sox at Fenway. And there's another story. Kobe Bryant tore his ligament in his knee. Out for the season. We should start writing these stories down. The "Post" has a circulation of a million? A million. How many other people were reading it too? We gotta start comparing stories. It's not just the "Post." It's all the other news outlets. 7 billion people caught a glimpse of the future. Maybe just one of them knows why this happened... - How do we compare 7 billion stories? - You create a web site. People can log on and post what they saw and cross-reference their visions. We can piggyback on that and search for patterns. - That's what I was already doing. - What do you mean? Mosaic. All those leads I was running down. We should start following up on 'em now. Assuming your vision is even accurate, the investigation doesn't exist yet. But it <i>could.</i> It will. In my flash-forward, I was investigating what caused all this. I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening and... those people, the places I saw on the board... They were part of this puzzle... Mosaic. Look, I'm certain of it. Fine. We'll set up interagency task force. And as far as this office is concerned, you three, you own this. This is kind of insane. We're running point on this because he had - a vision of us running point on this? - You find that funny? - We don't even know... - It's the only lead we have. - We don't have anything right now. - It works for me! The whole world's on pins and needles, people. Air traffic's been grounded. People scared to leave their homes, Martial law's across half this country. Priority number one... Finding out what caused this. Priority number two is figuring out whether or not it'll happen again. You got it? Yes, sir. Good. I'm out. Okay, my psychic friend, - what do you got? - I remember a name... D. Gibbons. - Gibbons. - That's right. Yeah. What else you got? There was a photograph here of a doll. The doll was burned. The head was melted. There was a bullet casing nearby. Something about Baltimore. A hand. Baltimore... No. No, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. A... A "blue hand." - That's what it said. - What the hell does that mean? I have no idea. Just put it up. No. Wait. Here, in the center. This is gonna sound stupid, but I was wearing one of those... friendship bracelets. You know, like kids make. Okay, that's good. What else? What else? That's it. Those are all the leads I can remember. What about your state of mind? What were you doing? I was... chambering a round. I was scared to death. - You were scared to death in here? - Yeah. The office was empty, but... Someone was coming for me. They were wearing masks. They wanted to kill me because of what I knew. One of 'em had a... tattoo. How many D. Gibbons there are in the world? - Maybe thousands. - Have Janis compile a list. Not a hell of a lot to go on yet. At least you remember something. What do you mean? Everybody saw something. Everybody had some kind of a vision. I didn't see a damn thing, Mark. Maybe it means you'll be sleeping six months from now. Then why wasn't I dreaming? Look, I never remember my dreams. Stop, all right? We're both thinking the same thing, so let's just say it. What if I didn't see anything because six months from now... I'm gonna be dead? Mr. Benford? Are you all right? Yeah. How's Charlie? She's fine. She's sleeping. I was watching the news all day. They say it happened everywhere. It's gonna be okay. Is that what they're saying at the FBI? Do you have inside information? I wish we did. So then you don't know it's gonna be okay. I think God did this. Why? To punish us. Still no luck finding his parents? Well, his mother died on the 405. Father's name is Lloyd Simcoe. He works at Stanford. But, no one's been able to locate him yet. So even if the kid pulls through, he could still wind up an orphan. You saved his life today. You chalk that up as a victory. I'm trying, but after a day like today... What about you? How are you staying so zen through all this? Who says I am? You wanna know why I wasn't at work yesterday? I've been going through some really heavy things recently. I don't want to get into it now. But the... the point is... This morning, I was out on the Venice Pier, and... And I was thinking about committing suicide. - Oh, my God! - It's okay. I'm... I'm okay. I saw a glimpse of my future, and... I was alive. You know, and everything's changed for me now. Whatever I was thinking about doing obviously wasn't meant to happen. It's like a sign from God or something. You know, these visions were a gift. Don't you think? A gift? I don't know. Not for me. Why? What did you see? I saw the end of my marriage. I was drinking again, in my flash-forward. And in my head, I... I know it wasn't just a one-time thing. I was full-fledged drinking again. All the anxiety, shame. It was all back. Just because you saw that doesn't mean it's gonna happen. Even if this future stuff <i>is</i> real, maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Maybe because you saw it, you can change it. Ghost of Christmas future crap. What if I can't? People relapse. I did. You pick yourself up again. Olivia said she'd... She'd leave me if I slip again. - She made that clear. - Then don't slip. Until you see something that corroborates these visions, it's all fantasy. The future is still up in the air. You're a terrible sponsor. You know that? What do you want me to say, Mark? You're not the only one this... this has happened to, you know? I've got the opposite problem. What do you mean? Tracy was killed in Afghanistan. - And you were at the funeral, right? - Right. But in my flash-forward, she's alive. Doesn't make any sense. They I.D.'d her remains. I know. I can't explain it, but... It <i>was</i> her. I'm... I'm certain of it. And if she's out there somewhere, she needs me. For two years, I've been putting her to rest. Now... I don't know what to think. I'm confused. I'm... hopeful. And I'm angry that I'm hopeful. You're worried... your future's gonna come true. I'm worried mine won't. - You fixed the garage door. - It was a slow day. Do you remember our song? The one we danced to at our wedding. Etta James, "At Last." Right. What did you see? I was at the office. Working on a case. It was... It was this. What caused the flash-forward. I got the sense I was in danger. Then... - Then it ended. - Nothing else? No, that was it. What about you? Babe? - I don't want to talk about it. - Why? 'Cause it was too upsetting. I need to hear it, whatever it was. No, you don't. Come on. What did you see? You know what? Just... let it go. What did you see? I was with another man. Who? I don't know. I've never seen him before. He was downstairs. I don't know who he was, and yet my vision I had all these... intense. Feelings for him. I... Hey, honey. I don't understand, Mark. I would never cheat on you. I wouldn't betray you. I wouldn't... Just because we saw these things doesn't mean they're gonna happen. - Dylan! - I'm sorry. You are? His father Lloyd Simcoe. - How is he? - He'll be fine. His attending physician, will be here in the morning. She can fill you in on some the details. I'll wait for her. Daddy? What are you doing up, sweetie? It's after midnight. I had a bad dream. Come here. You wanna talk about it? Why was Mommy crying? She was just scared. It's gonna be okay. Are you scared? No, honey. I'm fine. - What do you have there in your hand? - Something I made for you. I want you to have it. Take it, Daddy. Do you want me to help you put it on? Sure. There you go. I'm still at work, babe. They got us working late. I'm watching it right now. If this is the song you want, you got it, baby. Let's talk about the future when you get home. You have to see this. Gotta go. I love you, too. What's up? So as far as we know, every single person on the entire planet lost consciousness at the exact same period of time, right? - Right. - So I started cycling through a bunch of surveillance cameras for the last five hours because I was curious to see what they recorded. I looked at hundreds of 'em. I checked every major city, even web cams in other countries and they all show the exact same thing. At 11:00 A.M., people start dropping like flies. And then 2 minutes and 17 seconds later, they start to come to. And then I saw this. This was in Detroit. - What am I looking at? - Hang on a second. Look right there. - No way. - Yeah.
