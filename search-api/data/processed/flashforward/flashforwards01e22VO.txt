I've been keeping a secret from you. Keiko... she's in Los Angeles. Keiko Arahida. Your mom has posted your bail. This ring is a quantum entanglement device. This little thing prevents people from blacking out? - Hellinger wants to help you. - Who? Our boss. You're going to die, but your daughter's gonna be better off when you're gone. They had me install a software. I can find out who made it and where it came from. You get me into NLAP. I'll tell you who caused the blackout. Janis, this guy has been lying to us about everything. Now you want to take him to NLAP? How the hell do you trust this guy? - Her heart has stopped beating. - She's gone. You do the math. You're both part of the equation. I cannot be in that house with you tonight. At 10:00 P.M., you have to here with me. On April 29th, I'm gonna be on a bender. So why not start now? Today's the day daddy's a die. Why are we stopping, mom? 'Cause we're just gonna sit here for a while. Look! That one's shaped a star. Look at that, mom. Flight number 37... I'm looking for a Keiko Arahida. I believe she's being held here. Was. She was released an hour ago. - Did she say where she was going? - Not in English. Do you have a phone number for her? There's gotta be some sort of intake file, right? You got a warrant, officer? Listen, this Keiko... I've never met her. But I saw her in my flash-forward. I started drawing her. I have 20 canvases in my house of her. She was wearing this t-shirt of a Sushi restaurant just outside of Tokyo. So I flew to Japan. I flew to Japan because of a t-shirt. But I didn't find her. I didn't find her, and I thought that was my only shot. I know that she's here in L.A., and now maybe you have a phone number. She changed my life just because I saw her. That was really your flash-forward? It was. That's amazing. Because in my flash-forward... I had $100 in my pocket, and I couldn't figure out for the life of me how it got there. This isn't right. I saw her alive. So did you. I saw her. - A pulse? - Yes. Very faint. Stay with me, Trace. I'm begging you. Stay strong. Stay with me, Tracy. Stay with me. Just live, and we'll wind up where we're supposed to be. That's it... The La Honda access point. This is mile 6 of the accelerator's 10-mile length. We get in there, I can get to the mainframe, find the software Hellinger's men had me install, and use it to destroy them. You'll use it to help us identify them. Right. That's the deal. One of us needs to get this device close to the security guard's access card. Then it'll transmit its code to my cell phone. We'll just get the rig close to the security guard that we're trying to completely avoid. That sounds simple. Good stuff, Simon. This is gonna get us inside the gate. This is gonna get us inside everything. I know you don't trust him. I trust you. If you're here, I'm here. - What's the matter? What's going on? - I don't know. Something's not right. I think I did it back in my apartment. - We're going to the hospital. - We have to do this tonight. We're not gonna get a second chance. The FBI's not gonna let him near that machine. Catching whoever is behind the blackout is more important than anything else. I need you to do this. Please. Do it for me. Don't tell me I won't regret doing this. I already do. Let's go. -= Blackout Team =- Saison 1 - Episode 22 -= Future Shock =- Your snapping on Hellinger like that... I take some responsibility. - I let it happen. - What the hell are you talking about? We were so focused on finding when the next blackout is, I haven't seen what's been going on with you. I've been meaning to talk to you about your priorities lately. Sir, we've found two bombs in the FBI with timers.</i> - <i>There are probably more.</i> - Call in the bomb squad. I'm on my way. Guess you're coming with me. Hands on the wheel. Hands on the wheel. Get out of the car slow. Slow! - I need help! - Ma'am, what are you doing here? What's taking so long? She has to get the reader closer. Trying to find Pacific State Hospital... - on Old La Honda. - Ma'am? - Come on! - That looked real. She was hurting. I need an ambulance at La Honda access point. He's getting her to a hospital. Come on. We should be home now. It's almost 10:00. We're not. So then... things can change? What are you doing here? Sweetie, why don't you take Dylan to the car and go get him a juice box? Come on, Dylan. How did you find us? Actually... my people called your people. The bodyguards? In my flash-forward, I think I was on the verge of figuring out something crucial, but I think for that to happen, I have to be at your house. I have to recreate those conditions. Why don't you let yourself in? You recreate all conditions you want. Listen to me. You're part of it... you and Charlie. It's like Gabriel said. You're part of the puzzle. - How, exactly? - I don't know. I just know that you are. This is bigger than you and me. We can't stop it. I've tried. - Mark pushed me away to save... - No, I can't push you away. Don't you understand? I can't do this alone. You should. You're part of the equation, and I cannot do it without you. What are you doing here? - Did you find her? - They just released her. I got a contact number for her. It's the restaurant where I saw her in my flash-forward. Turns out it's in L.A. It's all coming true for you. Look, Bryce, I... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. She flew all the way across the Pacific Ocean to meet you, and I... I tried to keep you apart. I'm sorry. This whole thing is my fault. I'm sorry. I've been ignoring the truth, the feelings that I had. I know it sounds crazy, but I love her. This whole thing with her was meant to be. I put these on this morning without a second thought. It wasn't until half an hour ago that I realized this is what I was wearing in my flash-forward. I gotta go. You should go. All liquids, gels and aerosols must be in 3-ounce or smaller containers.</i> Hear me out. Wait. Whoever put those bombs in there is targeting something specific. So we need to figure out what. So help me, all the glorious choirs of heaven, if you step out of this car, I will have your head on a plate. I'm gonna send over a driver. Stay in the car. You need a friend, so I tracked him down for you. Someone to keep you company while you wait. Aaron, it's Mark. Where are you? I'm okay, but I talked to Wedeck, and I need to know what's going on with you.</i> I don't know. I just kind of lost it. And then... And then I started to drink. You know... Sometimes what happens in the world makes us forget it's all up to us. We have choices...</i> you, me... You choose what's next, you'll wind up right where you're supposed to be.</i> Take care of yourself, Mark. Been celebrating? A little. Had to get back to the office, though. Loose ends. There's nothing to see up there, Mark. It's a fool's errand. Last time I listened to you, I took my eyes off the prize. Not gonna happen again. I have to go. Got a little errand to run. - Can I see it? - Come on. It's upstairs. I want cookies after. - Dylan, that's not how we ask. - It's okay. Mi casa es su casa. - My house is your house, too. - It's my house, too. So... 9:33. 27 minutes till your epiphany. I think I'd better get to work. All right. So how does this work? We just take our positions at 10:00, wait for your breakthrough? I think I'll keep my shirt on this time. What the hell? - I don't know. - Open this door. - I don't know what happened. - Now, Simon! - I don't know what happened. - I knew you'd try to pull something, you sociopathic, lying son... You're welcome. Come on in. - Your friend asked you to trust me. - Janis wanted me to help you. I do not trust you. This is the last piece of leverage I have left. And now you have it. Let's get to work. Shall we? Confirming devices on floors 5, 6 and 10, over.</i> You got a det time? Affirmative. 36 minutes and counting.</i> Copy that. Any update? Bombs. We've located them on at least 5 floors. This is bigger than Hellinger. Yeah. He's just a link in the chain. They're coming after Mosaic. Are you about to do what I think you're about to do? Your chances of making it are not good. I need you to do something for me. If they're coming after Mosaic, Lloyd Simcoe is not safe, either. Now I've got this covered. I'll secure Simcoe. - You can find him at... - Your house. It's what I saw. It's... It's where I'm going, right? Right. Lock it down. You should know I also saw myself telling another agent you were dead. Lloyd Simcoe's key. We need him alive. Same goes for you. I'll keep that in mind. Mom, come here! My God. He got into your lipstick and just started writing. It's the formula in my flash-forward. This is what I saw. How is that possible? I always assumed I'd written it. I guess Dylan must have memorized it this afternoon. Is he in trouble? Can we get cookies now? Sure. Charlie, why don't you take Dylan downstairs show him where they are? I will, but he already knows. Come on, Dylan. What is this? What does it mean? This equation somehow links the QED, the blueprints and the flash-forward all together. But it's a math problem, right? How would it possibly tie all those things together? It's the tachyon constant. It's the greatest mystery in all of quantum physics. And now I have to solve it. Right now. Evacuate the entire building! Clear, blue team! Clear! I've been waiting for you. I'm really happy to see you. Everything's gonna be okay. That's what we saw, right? I haven't felt her move in 3 hours. We're gonna get you an ultrasound. Ready. He's where? He's in the building with the bombs. Where I left my car keys. We've got 23 minutes until the building goes. We've gotta get him. The answers will come. You sound so certain. At 10:00 P.M., the answers will come. Because they will. It's not a matter of equations. It's not about the 2 of us just... physically being here. It's about this moment. Right here. I've fought it and resisted it, and yet here it is. It happened. The future happened. All of it? - Somebody means business. - Yeah, you got that right. You want up or down? Down. Go for it. I got you covered. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. I'm sorry. You can't come in. Please. I'm supposed to meet a woman here. I learned Japanese. Thank you. Try a different street, please. When I can get to one. I mean, the traffic's nuts. I need to go. Thank you. All right, everybody. It's almost 10:00.</i> 5 more minutes till we catch up to our future!</i> You installed the software. Now you can't find the file? I'm just not seeing it yet. - Beer? - Beer? Helps me cogitate. You know, Janis is gonna be okay. How do you know? She saw it in her flash-forward. All right let's get going. Someone could walk in here any second. It's almost 10:00. I'm supposed to send Lloyd a text. What is that, math? It's an equation for a damped 1-dimensional wave. It was Lloyd's e-mail signature for years. A damped wave. He used to call it his "tearful good-bye." That's cute. Is that physics humor? I'm supposed to send him something. He saw it. An inside joke for an inside joke. 4, 3, 2, 1! It's 10:00, everybody! It's the text from Simon. A wave. Good God. I have to make a call. - It's me. - <i>Did you crack it?</i> The constant I've been looking for, it isn't a number. It's a wave. If I plug the wave into the blueprint equation, I get an interval,</i> which if added to the previous blackout, tells us... Tells us what, Lloyd? As precisely as I can tell, the next blackout is sometime in April 2010, which means it's in the next 2 days. Are you still there? April? April 2010? The baby's fine. Good heartbeat. But... it's a boy. It's a boy? You disappointed? Just surprised. Future is like that. We're almost through this thing. Finally go back to the way things used to be, where the only stuff we see is what's right in front of us. Welcome to the future. Who did this? The strings are different. They moved. Make it look right. You make it look right. April... Black... Out. "T." "T." "E." "N." "F." "O. U." "R." "T." "E." "E." "N." P.M. April 29th. 10:14. The blackout, it's in 12 minutes. The command system won't let me access it. What was it you said earlier? Now the only thing we can see is what's right in front of us? Whoever did this may have copied the entire mainframe, created some kind of clone. - So what you're looking at is a... - A fake, designed to prevent me from getting in. They knew I'd be back. Remember me? Now all I have to do is backdoor into my archived account, compare the system, - compare the code... - I don't understand a thing. - You got it? - Downloading it for you now. I don't know who you work for, Mr. Hellinger, but whoever they are, they won't be very happy that you didn't prevent this... Not at all. Done. Whatever you'll need to track the bastards is in here. Sweetie, go. Go play with Dylan. Mark Benford is dead. He ran into the building. Doesn't have a chance. Are you okay? Careful. What happened? You went off the road into the lake. I wasn't even sure you were with us. Then I pulled you out of the car, and you started fighting me. Come on. You must be freezing. Here. There. It's okay. It's okay. In my flash-forward, I saw myself saving you. And all these months... I thought maybe I failed. I'm really happy that I didn't. You saw me? An ambulance is on its way, okay? My name's Ed. What? What is it? Someone's accessing the mainframe from outside. - What does that mean? - It's a different command system originating off-site. They have control. Commencing activation sequence. What have you done, Simon? Get away from there. Put your hands up! Now! You lying. I didn't do this, Demetri, not then and certainly not now! I'm going to let them do this to me. I won't let them turn me into a monster, to use my machine, my mind. Millions of people, Demetri, millions of people don't deserve to die. You want to stop me? You want to stop me, trying to shut this machine? Then you're going to have to shoot me. It's Mark. You're still in the building? Get the hell out now! The next blackout, I figured it out, Stan. It's gonna be at 10:14 P.M. Pacific tonight. Call the White House, EBS, NTSB, everyone. This place is about to go in three minutes. Move now! Make the call, Stan. Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck. Put me through to the White House now. Credible information that another global blackout</i> will hit in minutes. Livy, listen very carefully. The next blackout's about to happen. Take Charlie, get her somewhere safe. It's gonna happen in about two minutes.</i> Tell her I love her. I love you both. Please be safe, Mark. Good-bye, Livy. "President Segovia has issued an evacuation order "in light of credible reports that another global blackout will hit. "He's urging immediate steps to be taken "to ensure public safety and is appealing for calm." You might want to put that ring on. You know what? I didn't see my future the last time around. I'm not gonna miss it this time. You want it? I've seen my future. This is it... right now. What did you see? You might want to sit down for this one. Ready? - Hang on! - I am! Just hang on! Charlie, what is it?
