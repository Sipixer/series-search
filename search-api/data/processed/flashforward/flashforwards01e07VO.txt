The man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was in our living room, and I sure as hell didn't bring him into our lives. You did! All the old patterns are back, Mark. It's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore. I had a vision of Fiona Banks. Let's see if she had a vision of me. I know why you're calling. It's to do with the Rutherford case. You've been acting weird for a couple of weeks yourself. "Blue Hand"... It's a clue from Mark's board. Dear Celia, I don't know your last name, and I don't know where you live,</i> but I know you have two young boys, twins, I believe. And I know you didn't have a flash-forward.</i> I understand how terrifying that is and how powerless you must be feeling.</i> But I want you to know that you are not alone.</i> E-mailing your other girlfriend? No, we broke up. This is just porn. I'm in pre-trial conference all day, so unreachable, but don't forget, - we need to sign off on the proofs. - Proofs? - For the wedding invitations. - Right. Bet you 20 bucks they spell my name wrong. Bet you $100 they got mine wrong. They say couples with commonly misspelled names are the most successful. Really? Meet me at the printers at 6:00. - Can't you just pick one? - I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. I'm just saying you have great taste. I don't... need to be there. Kick ass today. I might be home late tonight. I'm covering the E.R. for Sally again. - I tried to get out of it. - You don't have to explain. It's hard 'cause Crosby's out of town, so there is no one else. You don't have to explain. I trust you. Good. I trust you, too. It's like everything I say comes out wrong. Everything. Even when we're good, it's tense. Things have changed for everybody. It's a new world. I miss the old one then. Really? When you used to crash on my couch playing "Madden" till 4:00 am? Don't you mean futon and kicking your ass until 4:00 am? - What? - What? I said it. You didn't kick anything. You were... cheating. That's what you were doing. What you call cheating I call finding a way to change the game, my friend. - How's Hawk doing? - She's out of the woods. Should be back to work in a few weeks. These three had to do with her shooting? We followed the hand stamp from the guy who shot Janis, led us to the house where we found these guys. The Blue Hand stamp? - I'm sensing a theme. - You want to share? The contact ring, residue patterns and bullet trajectories are consistent with self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Self-inflicted? You think this is some kind of suicide pact? Had to be. But then who arranged the bodies and covered them with the sheets? All had alcohol in their systems. She had ecstasy and heroin. Who are these people? Jason Martinez, 37. Married, two children. This is Diana Davis. Still looking for next of kin, And Ian Rutherford, 25. British national reported missing from a cargo vessel docked in Long Beach. Your Rutherford case? Here we go. Season 1 Episode 07 The Gift</i> - Hey, Aaron. - What's up, Jack? There's a guy waiting for you inside. Says he served with Tracy. - How can I help you? - You're Aaron Stark? Corporal Mike Willingham. I wanted to talk to you for a while, but... but I've been mixed up, trying to get a job, a place to live. It's tough re-adjusting to civilian life. With the way things are now, You just gotta hope it gets better. Sorry to bother you at work, but I promised Tracy that if anything ever happened to her, I'd give you this. How did you find me? I'll always find you, kiddo. I think right now, you need this more than I do.</i> I hadn't seen this knife since Tracy deployed four years ago, but somehow... Now I understand how in my flash-forward, - I was giving it back to her. - She said it was a good luck charm. Maybe there's something to that. For two years, I've had to listen to people telling me to move on, to accept what happened to her. But I always knew I'd see her again. Now you showing up here... It's all happening, isn't it? It's all happening. Why do a copy machine salesman, a librarian and a Scottish journalist decide to get together to shoot themselves? Because print is dead? Say hello to your vision. You all know Fiona Banks, MI6, fresh off the plane from London. Nice to meet you again. For the first time. Nice to meet you. Suicide seems a little low-incident for MI6. Ian Rutherford was reported missing off a cargo ship two weeks ago. The British embassy was notified. I saw the report and came here because... 'Cause you knew you'd be working on this case from your flash-forward. That's all well and good, but what do we got? When I found out all 3 vics committed suicide. I cross-referenced their visions on Mosaic. Turns out they're all ghosts. So people who didn't see anything, that's what they call themselves. So none of them had visions and now they're all dead. Am I the only one who finds that disturbing? No, you're not. Here. Check this out. It's a ghost web site. It's where they connect with each other, find out about upcoming events. Anchorage, Buenos Aires, Dubai... It's happening everywhere. "The Blue Hand. No limits. No fear. "A place where ghosts can gather to embrace the inevitable." You've got to be kidding me. - A death club? - Like a book club, with bullets. Whatever it is, the guy who shot Janis is a part of it. We need to find these people, figure out who they are and shut them down. The next meeting in LA is being hosted by a guy named... Raynaud. Dr. Maurice Raynaud. When is the meeting? Tonight, go downtown and check the time. Tonight, go downtown and check the time. Ian Blaine Rutherford. Born in Edinburgh, 1984. Father's an aviation mechanic. Mother... Works in a factory, makes cell phone components. I've already seen that file. Yes, of course. Sorry. I just... I never expected to be working on this case so soon. The dominos seem to be falling into place. It's funny. I don't remember anything from the actual dossier other than his name. I just remember you. And the bird. When it hit the window... I felt my heart skip a beat. Then you had the phone call. Excuse me for a moment. After you left, I looked out onto the ledge. I went over. I wanted to help it. If only to end its pain. But I couldn't. That was the worst part. There was nothing I could do to stop it. What was your phone call about? It was my attorney. Why were you speaking to an attorney? Did something happen? I killed her. No, everything was fine. I'm working downtown tonight. Thought I might stop by that bakery on Grand, on the way back, pick us up some of those cinnamon rolls. Or not. You don't have any idea why I'm mad, do you? The printers? Our invitations? My God. I'm so sorry. Work was so crazy. We got a lead on the guy who shot Janis and now we're going to this club. You're not the only one who had a crazy day. I've been cranking out motions in limine all afternoon but somehow - made it to the printers anyway. - You're right. I should have been there. I'm really sorry. It's not about the invitations. It's about you and me and the fact that you've been... checked out ever since I got home from Seattle. I've been slammed since the blackout. Since the blackout. That's been your excuse for everything. Yeah, no, why you are late coming home, why you don't talking, why you shut your computer every time I walk in the room. - It's like I don't even exist. - That's unfair. What's unfair is being in love with someone who treats you like a stranger. That's unfair. And I don't want you to apologize. I don't. I want you to want to be here. Talk to me. Just be honest about whatever's going on. - You want me to be honest. - Yes. The more you jump down my throat, the less I want to be here. How's that for honesty? - Is he qualified? - No, I think... Thanks for having me. Not at all. We always need volunteers. There's a lot of menial tasks. A lot of charts to be filed and blood to be run to the lab. - It's not glamorous. - I'm not looking for glamour. Aren't you supposed to be at that conference? Yes, but lab's lost the coags on our spider girl, the O.R. is trying to bump our appy, and volvulus guy is leaving the AMA to see his kid in this ice capades thing. So redraw the coags, tell the OR no, and I'll talk to skater dad. - Bryce, do you know Nicole? - Yeah. I think we met at your christmas party last year. Hi. Nicole's volunteering here. He'll show you the lay of the land. I will catch you later. - Thanks. - What's "volvulus"? Twisted gut. You pre-med? No, I'm just volunteering, helping people, you know. Ma'am, slow down. I'm sorry. We don't understand you. Arigato. Sweet peas symbolize good-bye in japanese culture. It's considered a bad omen to give it to the sick. Is that a cardigan? What? I was going for Average Joe. Back off, Dem. That jacket? Ridiculous. Says the FBI agent in a police T-shirt. Good going. What? "Go downtown, check the time." We're here for the meeting. At Dr. Raynaud's invitation. Who's gonna play? Play? Who is going to play? I get it. No bullets. Good gag. Your ticket... in. Welcome to the Blue Hand, gentlemen. You got a death wish? You could have been killed. Not today. That was a real bullet in that gun. You know that, right? Unlike the rest of these people, I know I'm gonna be alive in six months. I've seen it. So bullet or no bullet, there's no way I was gonna die tonight. Hey. What can I get you? Could you get us to talk to Raynaud? Is he here? You guys first-timers? No. Maybe. The Raynaud changes at each gathering. And where is tonight's Raynaud? He's around. You'll know him when you see him. What you got? - It was on my board. - <i>Another piece of the puzzle.</i> So what do we do here? Anything you want. No limits. No fear. There's something for everybody. Hi. Hey. - I need to talk to you about... - I don't think we should be doing any of the... Me first? Okay. Fine. I really just came by to say thank you for everything you've done for Dylan. He did all the hard work himself. You saved his life... And in doing that... you saved mine as well. The very last thing that I would want to do, is ruin yours. - I don't think we should be... - I understand. I understand that this is very awkward. So please just let me be perfectly clear. Nothing is going to happen between us. - No, I know that. - I would never... do anything to come between you and your husband, despite what we may have seen or experienced. Good. Okay, good. Dylan and I are gonna move back to the bay area as soon as they approve the hospital transfer. Good. Good. That's... That's good. You must be anxious to... - get back to work. - Right. And I should go. Listen, thank you so much for everything again. I'll do everything I can to push that transfer through. - Great. Thanks. - Just excuse me. Thank you. Where did you learn how to speak Japanese? My dad was stationed in Okinawa when I was little, and I picked it up. When we moved back, I took it in school. Can I show you something? Just for a second. In my flash-forward, I saw this symbol behind her. Who's the woman? I have no idea. I was hoping that if I could figure out what the symbol meant, then I might be able to find her. I know it's an Asian character, but nobody seems to recognize it. They didn't see it because it wasn't finished. You have a pen? Yeah, a pencil. - May I? - Please. There. It's kanji. It's a Japanese letter. Kanji. What's it mean? "Believe." Mr. Stark? Mike. What are you doing here? Sorry to bother you again. I just... didn't feel right leaving things the way we did earlier. I'm not sure I understand. It's just... You seemed so happy. I didn't know how to tell you, but I think you deserve to know the truth. Truth about what? About what you saw... in your vision with Tracy. It's not possible. What are you talking about? I was with her in the humvee. Blind Father, this is Hit Man 2 requesting backup. Put Oscar Mike, pursuing Hajis heading north, about two clicks away from checkpoint Victor Tango. Over. Damn! Who the hell are these guys? - Those aren't Hajis. - Back up! Back up! Those are Jericho! We got to get out! Move! Burro, burro! We're gonna get waxed! - Get out! - Look out! Come on! Tracy! I'm sorry, sir. When I went back to check on her... I had to run. I had to. But I saw her die. I saw her die. This is pathetic. What have they got to lose, man? Doesn't matter if it's tonight or next month. They're dead anyway. Blue hands. They represent a portal, a gateway from one understanding to another. The blue hand marks a surrender to the inevitable. Raynaud. Here we go. You got me? - Get down! - Everybody get down! Give me my gun! Get down! Everybody down! - Get my gun! - Now! Now! - I want to... - Turn around! I want this to end. Not today. Not... today. Dr. Maurice Raynaud discovered Raynaud's phenomenon, also known as... blue hands. Died 1881. Guess it does beat your real name. Jeff Slingerland. I'm saying that right? Says here you taught American history at South Fairfax High. Teacher of the Year'08. Then the blackout happens and you turn into Friedrich Nietzsche. Why is that, Jeff? Or do you prefer Dr. Raynaud? You know what Nietzsche said. "If you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you." Is that the kind of optimism that comes from not having a vision? I had a vision. A bottomless pit of darkness and indifference, infinite in its nothingness, as if I never existed at all and I never would again. These people who didn't have a vision "these ghosts". Where do you Raynauds find them? We don't find them. You do. There's no better place to go than your Mosaic site. Couldn't do it without you. Do you see this guy? One of your fellow blue hands, shot and nearly killed an FBI agent. Start talking or I'm gonna charge you as an accomplice after the fact. Throw me in prison. I don't care. It's all mapped out. Don't you understand? The script for this conversation has already been written. Whatever you've all seen... is gonna happen. What if you're wrong? What if April 29th comes and goes, you're still alive? What then? You can run and you can hide, but you can't escape what's coming. No one can. Heading out? Yes, back to my luxury suite. They still putting visiting agents up at those crappy hotels by the airport? Now you're just rubbing it in. You ever try dirty rice? Dirty rice? What, you mean like, eating it off the floor? No, it's a cajun dish. It's my favorite. My mom makes it for me when I go home at the holidays. If I might try and make a batch of it tonight. If you're feeling hungry at all That's sweet of you. That really is, but I'm jet-lagged. I understand. I'd be tired, too. I've been thinking about our bird. - What if you taped the window? - How do you mean? Well, if you cover the window, - the bird might not crash into it. - It's a nice thought. I think it'll probably just crash into a different window. Maybe. But it's worth a shot. Can't accuse him of sugarcoating things. That guy makes Marilyn Manson look like Mr. Rogers. Everybody deals with it differently, I guess. - I'm sorry, I... - It's all right. At least I don't have to deal with the uncertainty. It is the one good thing about knowing the exact date of your murder. Gives you time to prepare. So what's gonna happen? March 15th comes around, you're just gonna pack it in? Come on, man. Say your good-byes, have a nice farewell dinner? - I'll deal with it the way I choose... - By fighting it. - That's what we're doing here. - Wake up, would you please? Wake up! D. Gibbons. The the doll factory. 137 <i>sekunden</i>. The Blue Hand. It's all come true. - Listen, it doesn't mean that you're... - Mark, look around you. Look around, man. Raynaud was right. It's all happening, every single day. There's no way out. There's nothing you I or anyone can do to escape what's coming. Give me 20 bucks for it. All is printed behind this tome. This is magic beyond all comprehension.</i> It searches with power and imaginary.</i> It seems that cosmic energies not meant for the mortal men.</i> They stay crumbled and resent the shattering omnipotence.</i> Okay, I'm tired, you're tired. It's time for bed. - Mommy! Please? - That's all right. I got it. Five minutes. Five. - I love you. - I love you too. Sleep well. Good night. Daddy, Are you sad? No, baby. Daddy's happy. Got you something. I'm not really hungry, but thanks. I really do love you. You know that, right? I know I've... I've been distant lately, but I... Didn't know how to tell you... And what to tell you. I didn't know what to do. About? About my flash-forward. I told you I saw myself on the beach at our wedding. That was a lie. I didn't see anything, Only darkness. Nothingness. I didn't have a flash-forward, because I'm gonna be dead. Tonight, I met all these people just like me. No visions. No hope. They were just... waiting to die. I don't wanna be like that. I don't wanna be like that. I wanna be here with you. I know what I saw. The beach. Our wedding. I know you were there. You gotta know how much I wanted that. I wanted to marry you, have a baby with you, grow old with you. It was a mistake. You just made a mistake. - There's no way of knowing for sure... - Zoey, I'm sure. I'm sure. Listen to me. I love you. I love you. You are the life that I wanted. Then let's "have" that life. We can have that life. You didn't want to give up hope. Then don't. We have two conflicting visions. We can choose... which one we wanna believe in. I choose hope. You're right. Thanks for coming out. - Is everything all right, sir? - Everything's fine. That's why I called you out, actually. I thought you might be upset with me, for... telling you what I told you. I've spent the last few weeks tortured by what I saw, up and down, living in limbo. But your story, what you told me... You've finally given me some peace. And I was hoping maybe I could return the favor. You won't be the first screwed up vet this place has hired. Thank you. No, thank you. You're a real artist. You could totally sell these. Thanks. I'd give 'em away for nothing if somebody could help me find her. Thanks. You don't remember her name or where she lives? Just, I remember the images... But I just can't put them together. You remember how you felt about her? - You have to find her, Bryce. - How? She could be anywhere. Look at your paintings. Look at her. It's Japan. It has to be. Do you have any idea how many people live in Japan? Put your story up on Mosaic. Even if she doesn't see it, someone she knows might. It's worth a shot. - Morning, guys. - Morning. - You coming to the meeting? - You two go ahead. Demetri? I left something on your desk. Can you make sure it gets into the right hands? See you later. We've got this Raynaud guy in custody. Now what? He's still refusing to name names, give us an idea of who's in charge. My sense is this people aren't killers... Just lost, aggressive nihilists. Your sense? You've gotta do better than that. You can break any perp. You've just gotta change your approach. Raynaud's different. Can't threaten him with anything. He's got nothing to lose. He has seen his future, and it is bleak. He doesn't even know how it's gonna happen. It could be... a fall, a fight, a shooting, a car accident. The possibilities are infinite. The guy's walking on eggshells every minute of the day, just waiting for the hammer to drop. Al, I just got off the phone with hospital.</i> They took her off life support an hour ago.</i> I'm sorry, Al. She's gone. Every day, he wakes up wondering if today is the day... If today is the day his future's finally gonna catch up with him. What's gonna happen to her children? It looks like the kids will have to be placed in foster care.</i> Those two boys are orphans... Because of me? No, Celia's death was an accident, okay?</i> - <i>It could've happened to anyone.</i> - But it didn't. It was my fault. I killed her. - The change in... - Stop. Stop! Al! Talk to us! Just talk to us. We can fix this. We can find her. We can find Celia. We can protect her. Anything you need, we can find a way to make it happen. - Come on, Al. - It can happen anytime, anywhere. - I don't even know how it happens. - Al, listen to me. You're alive six months from now. You saw it. Man, you saw it! But if I'm not here... - Come on, get down. - If I'm not here... - It means we can change things. - Al, please get down. What I saw... I killed her. What you saw... doesn't have to play out that way. What are you talking about? I found a way to change the game. Al, listen to me. Celia's death was an accident.</i> A terrible, random accident. There's nothing you could've done to avoid this.</i> "Dear Celia, "I don't know your last name, "and I don't know where you live, "but I know you have two young boys...</i> "Twins, I believe. "And I know you didn't have a flash-forward.</i> "I understand how terrifying that is "and how powerless you must be feeling.</i> "But I want you to know "that you are not alone "and that your situation "is not as hopeless as you think. "Our paths were meant to cross, "I didn't know how. "I didn't know when. "But things have changed now. "Things are no longer going to unfold as I had feared.</i> "My gift to you "is release from that dread... "From the feeling that you're no longer in control.</i> "We will never meet. "I will never know you. "So live your life. "Live every day. "And know that the future
