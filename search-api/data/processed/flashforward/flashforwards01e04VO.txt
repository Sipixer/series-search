why this was happening. You were planning an attack. Tell me what happened! We didn't do this. You were still planning on killing thousands of people. I think God did this to punish us. I'm a little at sea in dealing with Dylan's condition. He's autistic. This man means nothing to me. I'm not gonna cheat on you. On March 15th, 2010, you are going to be murdered. It's okay, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine, okay? What we're gonna do is on one, two, three, you're gonna take a big breath with me, okay? One, two, three. I wish I could have saved more people. I reached the surface, did the Australian crawl to the shore, and then I walked home. And then I realized that the whole world had blacked out. That was two weeks ago. This is the first time you've seen a doctor? Yeah, didn't need one till now. - Well, Mr. Ned, I... - You can call me "Edward." - Edward. - Wait, you know. Call me "Ned." My friends call me Ned. - Ned Ned? - Yes, yes. How did you stay so calm? I don't know. I just was. It says here that triage gave your morphine for your pain. - Does that mean... - They should call that stuff "mor-fine" 'cause that's how I'm feeling for the first time since the crash. - Why didn't you come in sooner? - It didn't start off so bad. I thought I'd maybe just bruised my spleen or somethin'. Okay, Mr. Ned... Ned. Whatever. I think with your low blood count and your pain, we should keep you in for observation and a CT scan. It's all gravy, Dr. Benford. Truly. Okay, good. Now after the blackout, - do you remember what... - Your flash-forward. What did you see? Not where I was goin'. You really wanna know? I was rocking leather pants. I've never rocked leather pants. It's always been one of my top three fears, along with clowns and escalators. But there I was, rocking out at this bar that I've always wanted to go to but I've never gone to because I thought I'd be too nervous, that I'd be... Well, too nervous. But it wasn't that way. I was happy. I was at peace. And I was black. Wait, you were... black in six months? Like Oprah. You know, African-American. Black. Okay, Mr. Ned. We'll see you later, Mr. Ned. 1x04 - Black Swan So they're your parents, you should be the one to tell them that we moved up the wedding. Though I'm sure a free to trip to Hawaii still won't make up for the fact that I'm not Korean. Right. Okay, where have you been for the last 20 minutes? I'm fine. It's just work stuff. Work stuff. I've been trying to trace a call from... an informant. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm here. Speaking of work, can I ask you something work-related? Are you guys gitmo-ing a suspect downtown? Some blonde, arrested the day of the blackout. Bin Laden in Prada? I can't confirm or deny this, Zo. I think you just did, sweetie. But professionally, if the bureau's violating someone's due process, that's uncool. But personally, if that woman has anything to do with the blackout, I really hope you're getting all Dick Cheney on her ass to find out what she knows. Ladies and gentlemen... As Eggbert, I would like to egg-xpress my desire for you to eat oatmeal this morning. - You're silly, daddy. - Silly? - Can I get a "cluck cluck"? - Cluck cluck! Cluck cluck. Thank you muchly. I believe you know my mum. Eggbert! You really are the Shakespeare of cheesy dad humor. You could play, too. You could be <i>ze</i> french toast. Ze toast of love. Good morning. - Hey, mommy. - Hi, sweetie. So guess who's picking you up from school this morning? - Nicole? - That's right. Nicole. She missed you. She's ready to start babysitting again. - Yeah, Nicole is coming. - Yeah, Nicole is coming back. Thanks for breakfast. First time in a while, I've been out acting like a normal person. I know what you mean. You want an ice cream or something? Where was that place Tracy used to take you when you were little? They turned it into a giant juice when I was a freshman. She spent all the money she made babysitting you buying you milkshakes. I should get going. It's my first day back at the Benfords', so I don't want to be late. Mark told me you went AWOL. I'm sorry, Aaron. You got me that job with them, and I totally screwed it up. If that were true, they wouldn't have asked you to come back. Nicole, you're not alone. Everyone's freaked out by this. But I think we have to surrender to a higher power and have faith that whatever we saw, we saw for a reason. So make Cowbell Lady NPO. We'll take her to the OR if she spikes again. And, what happened to the scan we... Come on. Come on! What did the scan show on our bus crash guy? Yeah. Ned? I can't stop thinking about that guy. I mean, how does somebody possibly go from being Caucasian to African-American? I mean, if that's the vision that he saw in his future, then I guess Bryce, I need you in the present. Here. Now. You know, patient care, doctoring, CT scan. Still don't have it. ER's got a bunch of traumas. They keep bumping Ned from the scanner. So I ran into Dr. Flemming earlier. - Who? - Blythe Flemming, the psychiatrist you're supposed to be following up with every week? Well, it's just, you know, I've had my rounds and... Come on. Less than a month ago, you were standing on a pier with a gun. - I know how it sounds, but trust me... - If you wanna keep working here, you need to follow up with psych twice a week. Got it? Excuse me! Bollocks. Hey, honey. Sorry. You know what? That Simcoe kid is awfully tuned out. I wanna transfer him to physical therapy. But he's on IV antibiotics. - Just as soon as you can, okay? - Yeah. And I need that scan of Ned's, so wheel him to the scanner yourself if you have to. You wanna go to Somalia now? Last week, you talked me into flying you to Germany - because of an index card. - And it paid off. You found out some crows died in Somalia 18 years ago. You know your definition of paid off is a little different than mine. If a blackout had happened before, that'd be major. I agree, which kind of makes you wonder why we haven't heard of it before. - Evidence Stan. There's evidence. - Last I checked, all you've got is a footnote in a CDC funding request. I've been working with Mark on trying to get satellite photos of the region from '91 out of Langley. They've been giving us the runaround, so... Maybe the CIA's just a little busy these days to dig through satellite intel from last decade. Guys, I get it. Germany didn't exactly work out and you're trying to stretch a single into a triple. I get it. But going to war with the CIA is not the way to do it. Remember that hacker we busted? You know, the one who broke in the DOD's network, trying to take our overseas drones for a joyride? - Mr. Cheeto Dust? - Yeah, that's him. Don't you think he'd find Langley's mainframe a delightful challenge? Yeah, he'd find it delightful. It's illegal. Spying on your own country? - More than some procedural jujitsu. - Talking about a federal offense. Yeah. You're right. Where's Demetri? He brought that hot blonde terrorist over from holding. - He's questioning her now. - Why? I don't know. 'Cause she's hot? I'll repeat what I've said many times. My name is Alda Hertzog, and I'm an honest businessperson. We caught you doing business on the day of the blackout. Remember? With known terrorists, selling them weaponized nuclear material. Then charge me with a crime. You can't hold me here indefinitely. You're right. You should call your embassy and complain. Which embassy is that by the way? We wanna know 'cause... we wanna get you the right phone card. I'm truly flattered that you still feel the need to talk to me after all that's happened. But I've done nothing wrong. It's my associates who you want. Honey, your associates died on the day of the blackout. They were super dead. So you wanna give me somebody else? Customer Choice restaurant group. It's in Indio. Town comes up a bunch of times in wiretaps, but we never found out the significance. Customer Choice restaurant group. That's all I have for you today. You're running out of time for this to continue being a civil conversation. Really, Agent Noh? Here I thought you were the one running out of time. What'd you say? You really should get out there before it's too late. I'm not getting this. Instead of following up on the Somalia lead, you wanna reopen the dirty bomb case? We never closed it. And Somalia is not a lead. It's an urban myth, at best. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, we have a material witness... In a weapons deal. That broke on the day of the blackout. So maybe it's not as sexy as dead poultry in Africa, but you gotta admit the timing's a little hinky here. - It's a coincidence! - So what if it is? It is a legit lead on a terrorism investigation, which is kind of what we do around here. Agreed. Send me a postcard from Indio. What the hell's the matter with you? I just want to be an FBI agent today. All right? Life is short. Thank you, for putting up with me. Hi, Mr. Simcoe. I'm afraid I'm the annoying parent who always wants a thousand details. I'd like to apologize for that. I can tell it makes you uncomfortable. No, it doesn't. Doesn't make me uncomfortable at all. Sorry about the little outburst this morning... the tantrum in the hallway. The... unidentified flying meal tray. It's his autism. I don't know what to say to him when he's like that. Sometimes, you can't say anything. You just have to be there. Thanks. Thank you. Unfortunately, I haven't really been there since our separation. You know, work picked up and... Well, I barely know him. Well, you're here now. It's what counts. - A good night's sleep might help. - Well, despite the luxury of two rigid plastic chairs in Dylan's room, the Sandman has proven a bit elusive. You shouldn't be sleeping in his room every night. Well, actually, the... police brought me the keys to his mother's house. I just can't bring myself to go there for some reason. You should try. Maybe being in Dylan's room, around his things... It might give you some sense of who he is. Too much time in the hospital is not good for anyone, Mr. Simcoe. You hang in there. Hey, Dr. B., I got that scan that you wanted. I was just gonna grab a veggie dog while it prints out. Transfer Dylan Simcoe to physical therapy. - But I thought... - P.T. can handle the antibiotics. Just transfer him. I don't understand what all this is about. Welcome to my world. This restaurant came up in a confidential investigation. We need the names and addresses of every employee. The list, please. Thank you. Burgers, waffle fries. That's all we do. For now at least. We're going to be adding frozen yogurt in the future. So this place is owned by Customer Choice restaurant group? This place is Customer Choice restaurant group. We're not quite a group yet. Would you give me and Agent Noh a moment, please? Sure. Somebody get some burgers for these FBI guys, please! I can't believe I didn't want to come here today. I mean, the intel... They're adding frozen yogurt! Freeze! - Go left. I'll take right. - Gotcha. Come on. Give me your hand! You got him! Shut up! - Where you running, man? - Get up. Get up! We were just coming in for a burger. On your knees! Get on your knees! I heard what you're being. FBI can be biting my ass! Yellowcake uranium, Mark. Black market nuclear material. Do you think we should leave it, go back to your office - and stare at your bulletin board? - You don't be wanting this. Yellowcake. It's the type of strain, the type of weed he's slingin'! It's the sickest strain 'round. In my flash-forward, I'm driving pimping ride. 19-inch rims. I must be going to be Scarface of pot. You can't be fighting fate. Shut up! Truth hurts, pig! - Get off of me! - What are you doing?! - Burning his mouth! - I'm talking about today, about you! Racin' around, looking for someone to shoot! Just drop your crap - and do your job! - I'm doing something! I'm not sitting on my ass, waiting for clues to appear in my dreams! Give it a rest. This isn't about what I saw. It's about what you did! March 15th. Three shots to the chest. I'm not just gonna die. I'm gonna be murdered. How'd you find out? Anonymous call. The woman said she read it in an intelligence briefing. That's all she gave me. Mark, I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I thought maybe I could find who's gonna kill me or get a lead on them. I don't know, but... Why would you think there's anything out here? Alda said I was running out of time. That was it? Damn, Alda's a pro. She knows you're vulnerable, and she pulled a number on you. All I can hear is the clock ticking. Every day. - What am I supposed to do? - Somehow... you get past the fear and you fight. - How? - You know what I saw. I'm staring at the Mosaic board, and men are coming in to kill me. We are partners. If they're coming to kill me, they're probably after you too or gonna be. It's the future, Mark. - Why do you think you can stop it? - Because we saw it. We can use what we saw to stop what we saw. Demetri, we can solve your murder before it happens. That's why I wanna put everything we have on Mosaic. For you. For me. For everybody. Now can we get out of here? We can. Excuse me. Hey, Mr. Simcoe. Stepping out for a bit? Just... following some advice. I think you left this in Dylan's room. Thanks. She's beautiful. Your girlfriend? - We haven't actually met. - <i>Coming up soon,</i> a Glendale postal worker uses the Mosaic web site</i> to meet the police officer he believes</i> is going to save his life in the coming months.</i> You won't wanna miss this.  It's incredible, isn't it? A temporal anomaly in global consciousness. Yeah, I think that qualifies. So what'd you see? I guess this is the new "How's the weather?" Alright, then... Why not? I was in a house... Not my own house. I got a call from someone. I don't know who it was, but it was urgent. Dylan was nearby, maybe in another room. I heard a woman's voice... - <i>Honey.</i> - I turned towards it... And it was over. I never saw her face. But I knew that we were together... That she was important to me somehow. I know what you mean. Thank you. Excuse me... One second. I'm sorry. Dr. Benford! Dr. B. - Ned's CT. - Great. Big hematoma. Blood's been gathering around the liver since the bus crash. Ned's lucky he showed up in time. No, it's not luck. I mean, he was alive in his vision. - So clearly he made it to the hospital. - Enough about visions. No, Dr. Benford, it's relevant data. It's not data. It's not data any more than the dream I had last night. Look, I don't understand how you can ignore something that even the most skeptical people in the world - think might be real. - I'm not ignoring the flash-forwards. I'm just not bringing them into the practice of medicine. Now consent Mr. Ned for surgery and meet me in the OR. With any surgery, there's a risk of infection, blood loss, drug allergy and even death, Ned. It's all gravy. It's okay if you've got questions or if you're worried. - This is a major surgery. - I get it. You're telling me I need some sort of drug allergy-death surgery. I'm cool with it. I know it sounds weird, but... Some kind of change is happening. I don't feel nervous or afraid of like anything. All that worrying all the time... It's just, like, kept me from being... the me I'm supposed to be. Six months from now, I see myself, and I'm like, this invincible, fearless black guy, like Shaft or Bryant Gumbel. And knowing that... It's already changed me. Yes, Rabbi Hirscholtz. 15 in the last 2 weeks. Four on Sunday, actually. I didn't leave the cemetery until after sundown. Bye. Sorry. I'm so sorry about everything. It's been so busy with everything. How can I help you? I'm sor... I keep crickets. Oh, really... I really like the way they sound. So, Paige, you were saying? Paige is my sister. I'm Nicole. I only come on Christmas and sometimes on Easter. But that's gonna change. I wanna help out. I wanna start doing some volunteer work, - in the morning, before I have work... - That's great! But as far as volunteer work goes, we are full up. In a crisis like this, people, they really wanna... People need to help. Why don't you tell me what this is all about? How do I atone for something I haven't done yet? In my flash-forward, I felt like I was being... punished. Do you think... Do you think God made this happen? You know, it's really hard to believe that there's not a divine hand involved somehow. Tell you what. This, right here, is Audrey Ridgeway's phone number. She is the volunteer coordinator. I hope she can help. Here's a T-shirt. Bye. - Where's Ned? - OR took him. - When? - 10, 15 minutes ago. What's wrong? Call the OR. We're about to kill our patient. We can't operate. I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't make sense of it. But now I've got it. Ned has Addison's disease. Surgery could kill him. In the bus crash, he was calm in the face of an insane disaster. And again today, he spoke about his flash-forward. - Please. - And again he mentioned he was weirdly calm and black. You better scrub if you want in. If he's got Addison's, his body is making melanin compounds instead of adrenaline. That's why his skin is going to get dark. I know what  it is. Without adrenaline, his body can't mount a proper stress response. That's why he's so serene in the face of this surgery. - Without the stress hormones, his body will be unable - to adapt to surgery. - No, without surgery, he'll die. And he'll die. Listen. You're not listening to me. In his vision, he saw... Enough about visions! - He needs hydro cortisone. - I'm not administering a potentially harmful drug because a patient had a freaky dream. They are not dreams. I don't know what you saw, and I don't care. But it is affecting your professional judgment, and it needs to stop. How about your professional judgment? - Excuse me? - Come on, Dr. Benford. You know why you don't want to believe in your flashforward. You said it yourself. You saw the end of your marriage. You are so out of line, doctor. And you sticking your head in the sand is gonna end up killing our patient. You know what's gonna kill him? Wasting time arguing because he's lying on that table continuing to bleed. That's not from a Magic 8-ball or a Ouija board or some kind of vision. Right here, right now, that's real. Don't bother scrubbing in. Retract the duct a little more laterally. - Suction. - Anyone make it to grand rounds today? This guy from Yale says he can enhance memory of the flash-forwards - using a calcineurin antagonist. - Yeah, I was there. Pretty cool. Irrigation, please. BP's 78 over 54. - Stay clear of the hepatic artery. - 800 ccs out. - Systolic's in freefall. - Must be another bleeder somewhere. Or some kind of fluid shift. Get another unit on the rapid infuser. - Tributary's ligated. - Run of 6. 100 of lido right away. - He's in V-TAC. No pulse. - Damn it. - Code cart and a mig of epi. Let's go! - Lido's in. Where's the cart? You're charged for 360. Clear. No change. Going again. Clear. Come on. - Fourth epi's in. - Chase it with lido. - He's had five rounds. - Amiodarone then. - This makes no sense. - This makes no sense at all. 100 migs of hydrocortisone. I.V. push. He's got adrenal crisis. Addison's disease. - Nobody bothered to tell me this? - He hasn't been diagnosed yet. It would explain the lack of response to fluids and pressors. Exactly. Compression? Holding. Normal sinus. Good carotid. Nice catch, Dr. Benford. Let's close him up. What do you know about Agent Noh's murder? His murder? Something funny about that? Just that I knew he didn't have a flash-forward. I had no idea he was gonna be murdered... Till now. How did you know he didn't see anything? Because your partner posted it on the Internet. Because everyone in this office knows. Any particular reason why you felt the need to waste the time of the agents investigating the blackout? In all likelihood, nothing I tell you will be the truth. So why persist in asking? Asking questions is my job. So let's start with a simple one. What do you know about the blackout? That's not a simple question. All right. You've ever been to Somalia? I can't say I've had the pleasure. What about Detroit? Utah? You're wasting your energy on what caused the blackout, who's responsible. You're ignoring the most profound question of all... Why? Do you know what a black swan is? It's a metaphor used to describe a high-impact event. Something so rare it's beyond the normal realm of human expectation. It comes from the 17th century when scientists assumed that all swans were white. They were wrong. Fascinating. "There's a room. A small boy enters with a candle." - What is this, a bedtime story? - It's a Sufi parable. The man in the room, referring to the candle, asks... "Tell me where this light comes from." And the boy blows out the candle and replies, "If you tell me where this light went, I'll tell you where it comes from." Cute. Your partner is right about one thing. I commune with some very dangerous people. I'm friends with those willing to don suicide vests, in the name of ideology. I know when a man is willing to sacrifice anything for his cause. And you're not that kind of man, Agent Benford. Even if you were to start asking the right questions. You're not willing to do what it takes to get the answers. You're that little boy, Agent Benford... Alone in the dark. Hey, Al. Hey, man. Remember that hacker... Mr. Cheeto Dust? Give him a call. You sure? Is Somalia really that important? It's time I got out of the dark. Addison's disease? Who's Addison? He was the guy who discovered the condition. It's a hormonal imbalance that makes surgery very dangerous. But luckily, Dr. Benford realized it in time and gave you the medication that saved your life. - Thanks, Dr. Varley. - We should thank you. Your flash-forward helped us piece it together. If you hadn't told us what you saw, you might have died on the table. It's pretty cool. I wasn't afraid, because I didn't need to be afraid. The future saved me. Ned's crit is stable. Look, about earlier. I was completely out of line. But you were also right. I just didn't want to see what was going on with Ned, 'cause of what's going on with me. Look, I get it. It's what's happening with me. That's what made me believe him. Bryce, I haven't pushed you 'cause you didn't want to talk about the... Me standing on the pier with a gun to my head? I just want you to know that I'm here... if you want to talk. Thanks, Dr. B. - I'm gonna be all right. - You really think you're just okay now? I know I am. The future saved me. Dr. Benford? I need you to sign the discharge on the rollerblade guy so I can roll him on out of here. Dylan Simcoe's white count spiked to 19. Here's his CVC. He was transferred, physical therapy. Can you give it to his attending? - The chief transferred him back. - What? PT said they couldn't handle the antibiotics, so the chief put him back on your service. Are you okay, Dr. Benford? Yeah. Fine. Charlie's just upstairs changing into her PJs. All right. We did some finger painting, and she's all done with her homework, and we kicked around a soccer ball, too. - And she had ants on a log for a snack. - And how are you doing? I feel bad for disappearing on you. Everybody disappeared for a while. Some people aren't even back yet. I guess I'm just trying to figure out why you guys didn't fire me. Nicole, you're part of the family. What's the matter? You want to talk about what happened? You can, you know. I saw someone drowning me. What? I saw someone drowning me... in my flash-forward. I saw someone drowning me and I don't understand, but I felt like I deserved what was happening. Like I had done something wrong and there's no other way out. I saw the man's face who was doing it. He pushed me back down and... then I was just gone. What did I do that... - I think I deserved getting killed? - You don't know exactly what you saw - or even how you felt. - What kind of person doesn't care - they're being murdered? - Nicole, I've known you a long time. You didn't do anything wrong, and you won't. Tomorrow, I'm gonna have a detective friend of mine from the LAPD come talk to you. We're not gonna let anything bad happen. I'm gonna do whatever I have to... to make sure you're safe. All right? That person you think you saw, That person you're worried you might be, that's not you. Do you think you could try to believe that? Yeah. I can try. Good. - Hey, daddy. - Hey! Come here, you. Moons Over Miami. You in? - I'm in. - All right. Let's get started. - Are you staying? - You know what? I have to go. She's staying. Breakfast for dinner? Can't beat that. - Come on. Please? - Sounds great. Get cracking the eggs, Professor. - Can I have a bowl, please? - One bowl coming right up. - That's silly. - Here we go. Do you want the coin back? Say the magic words then. - Not again. - Are you ready? See you tomorrow, Dr. Benford. Good night, Deb. There you go. Do it again! Just once more! I think my junior magician has to get his strength up before the next trick. How about some dinner? I'll be right back. You're the eye of newt soup, right? All right. Chicken, it is. We need to talk. I can't right now. I'm truly sorry about that, Lloyd, but talking to me is just one of those little inconveniences you're going to have to put up with. Now that we're responsible
