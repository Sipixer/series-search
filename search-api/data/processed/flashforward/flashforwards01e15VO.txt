in advanced computing equipment. He also seems to have a penchant for chess. The man you call D. Gibbons, his real name is Dyson Frost. Hello, Demetri. My name is Dyson Frost.</i> Got your attention, didn't I? In my flash-forward, I saw this symbol. I remember the images, but I just can't put them together. Your have to find her. Our entire investigation hinges on what's in your head. I'm here to make sure you don't lose it before april 29th. - We went to Utah. - Officer down! D. Gibbons knew we were coming. You unearthed the Somalia photos. 5 minutes later, we're getting shot at. Whoever we're investigating knows what we're doing before we do it. We have 'em all. You're forgetting what we saw... The part where we're not together. Hey, honey! I want to go away with you and with Charlie. I just want to get away from all of this. Yes or no? I'm sorry. I was in surgery. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Oh, god. What happened? - I ran into a bullet. Babe, I'm serious. 6 inches this way, this bullet's in your heart. I know. I'm not sure I can handle this anymore. Livy, I was an F.B.I. agent when you married me. But it is different now. We have a daughter. I mean, if something happens to you, I don't wanna... Look, I get that this is who you are. But it's different. I mean, I've got to know that our family comes first. Something's gotta change. Wedeck offered me a position on the DHS counterterrorism task force. It's an improvement? It's surveillance. Two guys in a car eating burritos, listening to phone calls in farsi. I'll be out of the line of fire. My biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol. You're gonna hate that. But I can take it. What I can't take is losing you and Charlie. Our family will always come first. I promise. So, if you need anything, I'll be staying at the Wedecks'. I'm sorry. I have no idea how to do this. Neither do I. She's been in there 20 minutes. I'll call you tonight. Are you my new partner? If you are, I insist you change your clothes. Can't catch bad guys in pajamas. Where are you going? I'm just going to the Wedecks' for a little while. How long is a little while? I hope it's not very long at all. What's this? You lost your bracelet. It'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home. Let me put it back on. Come here. I love you so much, Charlie-bear. -= Blackout Team =- Season 1 Episode 15 -= Queen Sacrifice =- If you're watching this message in 2010,</i> that means the global blackout was successful.</i> That also means we've had a near miss in Pigeon, Utah.</i> How do I know all this? Because I myself have had hundreds of flash-forwards.</i> In nearly all of my futures, I end up dying on march 15th... Like you, Demetri. So if you managed to find this tape in Somalia,</i> it would seem our fates are on a collision course, and the possible outcomes of the game</i> are rapidly narrowing. As for the endgame, the next move is Mark Benford's. That's Dyson Frost? And it's genuine? It's legit. Degradation rate in the tape plus the date of production makes it authentic. The only explanation, however implausible, is that Frost flashed-forward from 1991 to our present and saw us in Somalia. Then in 1991, he makes a tape he knows we'd find. That's a 19-year flash-forward. And march 15th, the day he dies in his future, is the date I'm supposed to be murdered. Maybe that's the collision course he's talking about. Dem, Frost talks about narrowing outcomes, another indication that what people see in their flash-forwards... are only possibilities. - Could be warning us. - Warning us about what? There's gonna be another blackout. What? How? When? We have to assume that's Agent Benford's next move... to find out and to prevent it. So let's make it a good one. Find Dyson Frost... yesterday. This is magnificent work. Master circuits built from basic sketches I designed when I was 13. When you finish patting yourself on the back, can we get to work? I had to go to a lot of trouble to get all this, not to mention that basement. Yes, I know, the missing digit. A terrible loss. You find anything in those documents we got in Somalia? A couple of things. There were several references to tachyonic dark matter. In '91? How is that possible? The theoretical basis existed. - But the experiment failed. - Because they needed us. Clearly, you're missing the silver ling. The blackout. We're off the hook. Not our fault. Frost flash-forwarded in '91 using technology that we did not develop. Flosso said our NLAP experiments amplified the blackout. We can't dodge that. - Find anything else interesting? - I saw this formula in my flash-forward. Written on a mirror. It's the exact inverse of some of our early NLAP computations. I don't know, maybe a process to reverse the blackout? You're working on blackout protection in your flash-forward? I don't know, but it was this formula, and there was... There was more of it written on the mirror, and the two of them are combined somehow. We need the other formula that you saw on the Benfords' mirror. Go see your girlfriend. Ticktock. Nothing. I ran face recognition software on every available database. Since frost faked his death in 1990, there is not one record, - not one sighting of this guy. Nothing. - He's a thorough guy... Likes complex things like chess. He's also got an arrogant streak. Likes people to know when he's winning. I've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre-'90. Frost placed third in an amateur league in '87. And the guy he beat lives in San Francisco. His name is Ian McKinnon. McKinnon was the reigning champion until frost beat him in an upset. So I traced him and then I gave him a call. But when I mentioned Frost, - he hung up. - Let's travel. We need to get to San Francisco and talk to him, right? Yeah. But first, there's something else. This is Frost's final tournament against McKinnon. He uses a very risky play called the queen sacrifice. Looks like a total hail mary, but it's one of the most effective plays in the game. So what? He knew we would see these games. It's another message from 1991. Tournament game sheets. Each of his moves takes either two or four seconds. Never more, never less. In the three games, he made 50 moves, after which he resigned. So this is a code of some kind. Wait. Is this... This is morse code. 2-second moves are dots. 4-second moves are dashes. There are 50 moves, so 50 characters. - This is jumbles of letters here. - Not letters. Numbers in morse code have five dots or dashes. 50 divided by 5 is 10 digits. Is it a phone number? Prepaid cell. He really did know the future. Well done. Leave a message.</i> Dyson Frost? This is Agent Benford. It's your move. Now we're traveling. In english, please. I know you like halibut. Some just came in this morning. No, thank you. I ate some cereal. That's not enough. You need protein. You are kind, but I can't. It's too much money. I want a new beginning. And new love. Some miso soup, a little rice? Not today. Come here often? I'm beginning to feel like a regular. Don't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward? Bryce, you're my friend. You're crazy if you think I'm gonna let you alone. I appreciate what you're doing, but... I don't want you to see me like this. Is this about your pride? - A little bit, yeah. - Hello, it's me. You've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother. I think we've both seen behind the curtain. Besides, the chemo's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours. So tonight let's have some fun. Let's do it. But I'm buying dinner. You call SFPD? What do you think? - Help you guys? - Special Agent Benford. Agent Noh. Detective John Smith. Yes, that's my real name. - What do you need? - What happened here? Some guy from the chess club took two in the back of the head. Don't tell me. Ian McKinnon? Yeah, Ian McKinnon. Person of interest? Not anymore. Ian McKinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the '80s, and now he's dead. He was our best lead on Frost, but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation. San Francisco bureau is handling the follow-up, but I'm not expecting much. How long between when you first made contact and time of death? Eight hours tops. There's only one conclusion. The leak we've been tracking, that's compromised the security of the whole mosaic investigation is inside the bureau. Not just the bureau. Inside our office. I've been ordered to give full agency support, fresh pair of eyes, all the rest of that crap. You got a play? My dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing. He'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water and watch the fish float to the top. It was ugly, but it worked. Game on. Just don't forget who your friends are. What's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy. - Step away from your desk. - What the hell is going on here? Everyone's required to assemble in the conference room. On whose authorization? Sorry, assistant director Wedeck. Orders. - Whose orders? - I'm not at liberty to say. That's not part of the task force agreement. No calls, and I'll need your cell phone, please. - Don't touch me. - Sir, your phone. What's going on? Someone lose their keys? Simon Campos? You're in there also. I'm not really an employee. I'm more of a visitor. What is this? I've not had my coffee yet. What's this about? Judging from the way our offices are being torn apart, I'd say an inter-agency task force has been formed, and is looking for a leak. We can't just look for the leak on our own? I think the point is, one of us is a mole. And Mark? Apparently already vetted. This office has been swept. * You are the sunshine of my life * * Girl * * Forever you're stay in my heart * * You are the apple * Tweezers. There's your leak. Get out. It's voice-activated. When your office is swept for bugs at 4:00 AM the sweepers don't make any sound. No sound, no transmission. You've vetted the sweepers? Since the blackout, all techs have been agency-contracted. Blind assignments. That's how you do security. They just don't know about the singing. So who has access to your office, Mark? Everyone in that room. Time to light the fuse. Ladies and gentlemen, as you may have deduced, we're closing in on a leak inside the FBI that is hampering the mosaic investigation. Now, anyone want to confess? Then it's the hard road. You'll be first, Agent Noh, as you were part of the failed attempt to contact Ian McKinnon. You got anything to say about this? We have to do this. Vogel, you're a son of a bitch. You know that? True as that may be, I'm working with agent Benford today. I was with you the whole time in San Francisco. - You're not the mole. - Who then? - Someone in that room. - If you don't think I'm the mole, - what the hell am I doing in here? - He has to think I suspect everyone. Even you. How long are we gonna be stuck in here? Good question. They've got their whole procedure to go through. Re-vet contact histories, bureau records, computers. That could take days. They're gonna want to vet all of our personal files. Not if they don't have passwords. - You didn't give up your passwords? - Not to my personal files, no. Something on your computer you don't want people to see? No, I mean, nothing that's sensitive. I'm clean. It's porn. Agent Curdy, downloading naked cheerleaders on F.B.I. time? It's nothing like that. It's... It's just an R.P.G. What? It's an R.P.G. It's a role-playing game. I play "Warlocks of Avalon" online. I'm a 7th level druid. My name is "Argothic." You have any special powers? Cape of invisibility, lightning hammer, elixir of life, healing. - That's impressive. - Yeah, it's cool. You're next. Vreede. Can I borrow that cape? There any reason we can't get back to work, do something useful? Vogel found a micro-transmitter... In that key. You want to be useful? Tell me who put that in my office. You think it was one of us? That's the working theory. "M"... For "Mark." Nice touch. - Unless it was you, Marcie. - Can you shut up for five minutes? - Want some sugar? - I don't use sugar. We're with you. You know that. Thanks. But we're close. We'll get him. Good thing the fate of the planet doesn't rely on Benford finding the mole. Son of a bitch! Excuse me! Koreatown's further west. No. I'm not Korean. I'm Japanese. Either way, you gotta get on the bus. - You want this car to do that? - That's the idea. I look? You look? You look like you don't belong here, and you don't belong under the car. Hydraulics or nitrogen air bags? Hydraulics. Could be fracture in cylinder. I can help. Maybe I surprise you, yes? Okay, ninja girl. But if you break my axle, I'm coming after you. Thank you. This is really screwing with my trust issues. You know that? You've been through a lot, Janis. I took a bullet, Mark. And I'm seriously a suspect? You have to admit that getting shot and living makes for a perfect cover. Screw you, Vogel. I'm sure there's a reason, but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks in the weeks since the blackout. - 13 in all. - So? In the three previous years at the Bureau, you've taken precisely... Two. You know what I saw in my flash-forward. I've been going to a fertility clinic. You only had eight visits. - We checked. - So what? So I went out to go buy some shoes. - Come on, Mark. - Where were you? What is it, Janis? Ever since the shooting, I've been looking at everyone differently. Suspicious. Just checking up. - And you found something? - Does he have to be here for this? Marcie has a brother. - We know about him. - There's another one... A half brother. He's very sick. He's dying in Missouri in a full care facility. It's expensive. Marcie didn't name him in any of her applications. Those absences? I went off-site to look into some things. - You never mentioned this before. - I was waiting. For what? - I was seeing if she did something. - Marcie's paying for this care? There was a deposit made to an account for $50,000 three months ago... Anonymous. Okay, Janis. Thanks. I don't know anything for sure. I'm just trying to help. - You've done the right thing. - It doesn't feel like it. You trust her? You know what? Being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore. It's gonna rain. But we're together. We're having a girl's day. I don't want to have a girl's day. I want daddy to be here. Daddy wants to be here, too. Then why isn't he? Here's the thing, sweetie. Daddy and I love each other very much. But most of all, we love you. And we're always gonna be a family. That's never gonna change. I promise. Come on. Let's go for a ride. Let's do it. - Can I ride the ferris wheel? - You want to go on the ferris wheel? I went through Marcie's background. She did declare her brother in her initial application. Janis said she didn't. The original vetting records were at a regional field office. When they were routed to DC, an entirely separate file was created. It was easy to miss. You okay? I moved out of the house. Olivia and me... we're... I don't know. I moved out. Sorry. Is this about what you saw in your flash-forward? Partly that, partly what she saw. Is there anything I can do? But Marcie's still a suspect, so keep digging. All right. Tell your future. - Can we do that again? - No, my love. Let'go. Let's go. - Can we go again? - No, sweetie. Why are you following us? Because it's my job. I'm special agent Danforth Crowley. Your husband assigned me to be your security detail. Your safety is his number one priority. You don't know much english, so I know you don't have a work visa. I can try to get you paid off the books. That's your first job. Client wants more horsepower, so we've been trying to remap the ECU. My guys only work on carbureted engines, so for them it's like... Japanese. German. You said you were some big-time engineer back in Japan. Maybe you can figure this out. It is no problem. Yo, Emil. You didn't tell us about a masseuse. Listen up. Cut the music. I got something to say. This is Keiko. She works here now. She's part of the family. Treat her with respect, or we're gonna have a problem. Everyone get that? I'll take that as a yes. Get to work. Hey, it's me. I just wanted to thank you for that security detail. It scared the hell out of me, but I guess it helps. Charlie misses you. Anyway, I'm at the hospital, so call me if you... We need to talk. I swear I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't absolutely necessary. You literally have the world's worst timing. I've heard that before. What do you want, Lloyd? I need to know exactly what you saw in your flash-forward. I wrote a formula on your bedroom mirror, and I think it relates somehow to the global blackout, but what I saw was incomplete. Did you see it? I did. Part of it. I've to make a call. After a while, I got up from the bed. Then I noticed something was written on the mirror. It was written in lipstick. Most of it was indecipherable, but I did recognize this. Halothane. It's an anesthetic. Quantum physics and anesthetics... That's what Mark and I were working on in our flash-forward. I thought QED meant quantum electrodynamics. But we were... Building a quantum entanglement device. Good. That clears that up. - I've to be getting on with my rounds. - Of course. I don't want you to think... I'm harassing you. No, I know. You're just trying to save the world. Good-bye. So you come here every single night just in case this guy shows up? And during the daytime. I know. I know. But it's the only way I can find him. All right. I respect that. You saw your fate, and now you're doing your thing. When I saw my future, it was the best day of my life. It was the first day I let myself want what was in my heart. So like you say, I am doing my thing. Can I ask, what did you see? Something different than you. Let's leave it at that. You are kind to give me a job. We're lucky to have you. Thank you, Emil. You ever tried sea urchin? No. Is it good? It's like eating somebody's thyroid. I'm sure Keiko loves it. If she's the woman you love with in your vision, you have to it eat with her. This could be a problem. What if sushi's her favorite food, and that's all she ever wants to eat? Suddenly she's a Mogwai. You're being ridiculous. A what? Never mind. - What's a mogwai? - I'm not explaining it to you. Justify your metaphor, young lady. Mogwai... You know, <i>Gizmo...</i> The furry creatures that turn into gremlins if you don't feed 'em right. They had dietary restrictions. Forget it. It's a very nerdy metaphor. Just shut up and read the menu. I don't know. I'm just not feeling sushi tonight. I am. I guess I can have teriyaki. You're kind of a spoiled brat. I never noticed - that about you before. - How dare you? I have cancer. All right. What do you want to do? I'm sorry... I don't know why... I just did that. I know why I did that, but... It's, you're thinking about another woman. You can't just kiss me... In little Tokyo, - no less. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. It's just... You're great. Honest mistake. Just buy me a burger, and we'll call it even. Deal. - Good morning, Keiko. - Morning. Too much sake? Next time we have tequila. How's it going? This car will go very fast. We need a little more horsepower. We're not trying to launch it into space, - you know? - Immigration! I.C.E. Nobody move! - Hands behind your heads! - Do what I do. Hands behind your head! Now! Do it now! You Emil Gutierrez? You're under arrest for employment of undocumented workers. What's your name? Do you have an I-9? I-9? Surprise, surprise. Load 'em into the van. Let's go. It's me. Listen, I had a great time last night... and I'm sorry about kissing you. Actually, I'm not. I'm glad. So... Anyway... They've been in there 36 hours. Got anything? All of marcie's background has been gone through by vogel's people already... Financials, phone records, background checks up the wazoo. I'm doing surveillance tagging right now. This surveillance tech isgood. Wait. Go back. Go back there. How many times does she have coffee? She has coffee most of the time. Why? She doesn't use sugar. Give me time stamps for every time she put sugar in her coffee. Each of these time stamps corresponds to a day a key piece of information was leaked. Look at that. No one knew about the pigeon, Utah, trip... Crap! Or the Somali intel that triggered the attack in Washington. Every time she put sugar in her coffee, she was signaling her handlers. Marcie, what you doing? Down! Everybody down! - Go! - Cut her off at the stairs! Hold fire, hold fire. Get her out of here. It looks like you were right, Janis. I wish I wasn't. - You could have let me in on it. - I couldn't say anything. - Orders. - You told Demetri. It was discretionary. I need people in that room. So I was manipulated for the greater good. Queen sacrifice... Frost's play. - How'd you know about that? - We all have our ways, Mark. Agent Benford. Dyson Frost. Don't speak. Just listen. I haven't come forward since all your leads end up dead.</i> But now that your mole problem has been fixed,</i> I look forward to meeting you. I'll be in touch.</i> You were quite the hero today. I like a woman who knows how to handle a firearm. Fanca drink? I'm not really your type. I think you'd be surprised to learn exactly what my type is. I reviewed your uncle Teddy's autopsy x-rays. The CPR you gave him was quite aggressive. Could have even been the cause of his death. Yeah, I... can be quite a tiger. You murdered him to send a message. Message received. I should have known. A double plant. Two moles, in case one is caught brilliant. And not one person in the office would suspect it's you. Not one.
