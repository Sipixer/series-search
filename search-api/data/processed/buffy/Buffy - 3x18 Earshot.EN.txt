We want to take Angel's soul away. The Mayor's built this town for demons and, come graduation day, he's gettin' paid. - Think we missed anything? - We know all she knows. You played me! - I know you only did what I asked. - I never wanted it to go that far. You demons can't resist a run-and-stumble, can you? One down. One gone. - Scabby demon got away? - Scabby demon number two got away. Scabby demon number one, big check in the slay column. I don't like this no-mouth thing. It's disquieting. Well, no mouth means no teeth. Unless they have them somewhere else. Morning, girls. We've been researching the Mayor's forthcoming Ascension. - It's pretty riveting stuff. - What do we know? What don't we know? - Tell her, Giles. - Based on the date, graduation day,... ..and the Mayor being impervious to harm, I've cross-referenced... He's a cross-referencing fool. ..and eliminated several possibilities. It's not the ritual flaying of the demon Azorath, nor the... I don't know what's going to happen. - That was kind of an anticlimax. - We don't know anything? - The Faith-Angel thing was for nothing? - No. If nothing else, Angel's charade has brought Faith's treachery into the open. And this information about the Ascension will prove useful, eventually. I just need to put it together. Terribly sorry. I was detained. Official Council business. Mr Giles, you were speaking? I was filling Buffy in on my progress on the research of Ascension. Oh. And what took up the rest of the minute? Touch√©. Of course my work is unofficial. I'm sure, however, with the resources of the Council at your disposal, you will have something to add. Well, I am pleased to state, with certainty, that the demon Azorath will not in any way be... involved in... I'm sure we'll find out more soon. The demon Azorath? So, have you talked to Angel lately? Not really. Seeing him bad, even pretend bad... and with Faith... He only kissed her for the greater good. I know. But to the naked eye it looked like fun. Or maybe it wasn't. Maybe he wasn't even tempted. - I just wish I could be sure. - As always, I advise you to ask. Like he'd tell me? Hogan! - Great game, man. - Thanks. Hogan Martin thinks he's so hot. Like we should be awed because he can put a ball in a net. - Hey, Xander. - He said my name. He knows my name. - Hey, Willow. - Hi. Look. I can't make it to the study session after school today. - Can we do it fifth period? - OK. Did you finish the reading? - Most of it. - Percy...! - I'll finish it at lunch. - That's my little trooper. What are you doing to him? I heard him complete a sentence. It had a clause and everything. - Watching the game? - Wouldn't miss it. See ya, Hogan. Ladies. You're going? I didn't know you liked basketball. I didn't either, but I've started getting into it. Especially now we're in the championships. Too bad you're patrolling. We're all goin'. Oz, Xander, everybody. Great. Everybody who isn't currently Buffy. - You touched one of the demons? - A good touch, not a bad touch. Anyway, it's been itching like crazy. No big. Just another problem for the good people at Lubriderm, right? Is this the demon in question? In the disgusting flesh. - What? - It says it can infect the host. Infect? Oh, infect the host with "an aspect of the demon". - That's all it says. - "An aspect of the demon"? - It is rather terse, isn't it? - You mean, like a part of it? There could be any number of explanations. A new fabric softener can cause irritation. In any case, I would advise not to attempt to track the one that got away. Let's minimise your exposure. Part of the demon. I hope it's not the outside part. H-O-G-A-N! It's Hogan! Go, Hogan! Is it me, or is this really lame? I usually enjoy lameness and this is leavin' me cold. According to Freddy's latest editorial: "At the pep rally, pseudo-prostitutes provoke men into a sexual frenzy, which, when thwarted, results in pointless athletic competition." - And the downside being? - The school paper is edging on depressing. - Have you guys noticed that? - I always go straight to the obits. - What are you doin', Buffy? - Nothing. Checking for horns. You know, Buffy... I don't even think Giles is right about you becoming like a demon. I mean, he's totally burnt, you know? Dealing with Faith and this Ascension thing. Between you and me, he's not doing his best work. What if he is right? I'm gonna grow this demon part and we don't know what it is. I mean, it could be claws or scales... - What? - Was it a boy demon? T-O-M! It's Tom! Go, Tom! - They really are very good. - Their spelling's improved. You know, Oz, I look at all this beauty, all these healthy young women, and I wonder why I ever wasted my time on Cordelia. Look at her. She's no better-looking than the rest. - None of them are really my... - Oh, my God! He's lookin' at her. He's got his filthy adult Pierce-Brosnany eyes all over my Cordy. You're a very complex man, aren't you? It's just I'm scared, Will. There's this thing in me and I can't find it. I can't stop it. What if it changes me? I mean, not just the way I look. All of a sudden, I could be something that's not me. Oh, sorry. They spelled Percy and I have to show support. He's needy. But I heard you what you were saying. And I would be frightened too, but I'm sure you're gonna be OK. Still got a mouth. Sorry. That's OK. I didn't see you, so I should have known you were there. - What are you doing here? - It's a dangerous time, you know. With Faith. Yeah. Faith. She, well... Faith, what can you say about her? I just want to make sure that you're... you know, OK. That you're safe. And the fact that you're right here. Does that mean Faith's around? Are you tracking me or are you tracking her? I'm tracking you. Something's bothering you. A lot of things. The most recent being this demon. Actually, two. I touched one of them and now I'm gonna get a big case of the bumpies or a tail. "Aspect of the demon." - You know the drill. - By rumour. But that doesn't mean anything. I mean, sometimes demons, they exaggerate their power. Demon hype. Maybe not. I spend all my time in the dark here anyway. It's not like I'd be at a game, with my friends, where someone could see me in my new monster part. I won't let anything happen to you if I can help it. No matter what, I'll always be with you. I'll love you, even if you're covered with slime. I liked everything until that part. - Right at the buzzer. Three points for the win. - It was intense. For a minute I thought you'd make an expression. I felt one comin' on, I won't lie. I've never seen anyone jump like Hogan. They should call him The Jumper. Or a name that isn't an article of women's clothing. Hey, remember when the... Hm, quietness. We either lost or we won and you don't want me to feel bad. Yeah, it wasn't really a good game. Tall hoops, but then, tall guys. What's the point? - Pretty dull. - Are you crazy? It was an incredible game. I've never cheered so hard in my life. I still have knee marks on my back. From the pyramid. Yeah, well, I still bet patrolling was way better, cos... wow, important. Well, I thought I saw a four-legged demon. But it was just a dog. - A weredog? - Regular. - Tough luck. - Yeah. - I wonder if they've kissed, - It really bugs you, huh? - What? - Cordelia and Wesley, smooching. Man, you read my mind. Whoa, there. You watch where you're going now. I'm sorry, Mr Beech. I will. Students, if we could just get rid of all the students, When I'm a gillionaire and you're flippin' burgers, who's the loser? Maybe I'll take French, I said, How hard can it be? French babies learn it, Idiot, I swear, some day my pants are going to fall right off, Buffy's so beautiful, I mean, look at that body, God, I'd love to shove her against that locker right now and just... ooh! Is this the thing? The aspect thing? Because it is way better than a tail. I have a hard time as it is finding jeans that fit. Buffy, slow down. I'm not even convinced that this is genuine mind-reading. You're most likely projecting your... When I walked in, you thought: "Look at her shoes. If a fashion magazine told her to, she'd wear cats strapped to her feet." I... The demons are telepathic! That's why they don't need mouths, - Of course. The demons are telepathic. - I know. You just told me. That's why they don't need mouths. And you should have known. - This is astounding. - I was in the hallway. The principal has "Walk Like an Egyptian" in his head. And the boys of this school are seriously disturbed. It's weird, but Giles, think about it. Think about what I could do. It could be very useful. You could anticipate your opponent's every move. - Turn his plans against him. - Oh, way better than that! - Jealousy. - Buffy. Right. Very good. - I knew that, - That's the tool Iago uses to undo Othello. But what's his motivation? What reason does Iago give for destroying his superior officer? Cassio has my place, 'twixt my sheets he's done my office, He was passed over for promotion. Cassio was picked instead. And people were saying that Othello slept with his wife. Buffy did the reading? Buffy understood the reading? When did she study? Was I supposed to study? Miss Murray's kinda hot, I was gonna say Cassio, - I hate her, - Any other reason? - Race! - Good, Nancy. Can't overlook that. Look at them scrambling for the teacher's praise like pigeons for old bread crusts, Will, who's that guy? It's Freddy Iverson. He writes those editorials for the school paper. He's sardonic. Bread crusts, that's deep, I should write that down, Is there something else at work here? Well, he sort of admits himself that his motives are... spurious? He does things because he enjoys them. It's like... he's not really a person. He's the dark half of Othello himself. Buffy. Really... Very astute. I said something quite like that in my dissertation. I know. I mean, I agree. With that. And doesn't that also explain Othello's readiness to believe Iago? Within seconds, he turns on Desdemona. He believes that she's been unfaithful. We're all like that. We all have our little internal Iagos, that tell us our husbands or our girlfriends, or whatever, don't really love us. We can never really see what's in someone's heart. Oh, sorry. Sorry about the daytime. I just ducked out of school and... that's when they have it! You look good. I mean, I know I saw you last night, but... sometimes things can change real quick. I mean, really quickly. Listen to me, I'm talking like Faith. You know, not that she was so bad to have around. You know, before the evil. You know, I think she was hurting a lot. And some people, protective-type people might be drawn to that, I guess. - Well, the thing about Faith... - You can't get into my mind. How did you... Why not? It's like the mirror. The thoughts are there, but they create no reflection in you. You got your aspect of the demon. Yeah. Giles doesn't know how long it's gonna last. - But it's OK. A little headachy, but... - You don't have to play games with me. Ever. - You're not exactly here's-what-I'm-thinkin'. - So ask me. - But that would have made sense. - What do you want to know? Faith? How I felt kissing her? Pretending to have no soul? Watching you suffer? - Well, since you bring it up... - I hated hurting you. More than I can stand. Look, the thing about Faith... I'd understand. She has that whole bad-girl thing workin' for her. Kissing her meant nothing. I don't want a bad girl. I've done that before. I've lived a long time, Buffy. And I'm past that. I've been with dozens of girls like her. More. - Oh, this honesty stuff is fun! - And there's no comparison. In 243 years, I've loved exactly one person. Who? It is me, right? Next time, just ask. OK. Buffy, careful with this gift. A lot of things that seem strong and good and powerful - they can be painful. Like, say... immortality? Exactly. I'm dying to get rid of that. Funny. I'm a funny guy. She can read our minds? Our every impulse and fantasy? - Every one. - Oh, God, I don't see what this has to do with me, Well, I think it's great. I mean, you enjoy your other slayer powers. It'll be fun. Did you see Nancy's face in class today? Yeah, She's hardly even human any more, How can I be her friend now? She doesn't need me, - No, I do need you. - OK. What are you talking about? Because you are so creepy right now. I think there must be some precedents for occurrences such as this. I'll research it. Can you give me a hand? Of course. Where should we start? I am my thoughts, if they exist in her, Buffy contains all that is me, and she becomes me, I cease to exist, What am I gonna do? I think about sex all the time, Sex, Help! Four times five is thirty, Five times six is thirty-two, Naked girls, Naked women, Naked Buffy, Oh, stop me! - God, Xander, is that all you think about? - Actually... Bye. Xander has just illustrated something. Chances are, you're all going to be thinking whatever you least want Buffy to hear. It's a question of mental discipline. - He's right. - Look at Cordelia! No, don't look at Cordelia, She's a student, Oh, I am bad, I'm a bad, bad man, Excuse me. - What's it like, Buffy? - I don't know. I mean, it's a little weird, but... Look, please don't think I don't need you, because I do. And I want to share this with you. It's like all these doors are opening to all these worlds and I can walk right inside. No one else exists either, Buffy is all of us, We think, therefore she is, She knows so much, She knows what Oz is thinking, I never do, Soon she'll know him better than I do, - No, don't think that. - I can't help it, Buffy. I'm sorry. I just can't. If you don't need me, I'm going to follow the redhead. I guess I won't be writing Winning Friends through telepathy, Whatever, I wonder when I can go? Whatever. Can I go? Excuse me, can you hear me thinking in here? I could go out into the hall. You know what? You stay. I'm getting a headache. I'll go. She is so hot, - I hate my body, - ..I'll scream from boredom, - No one'll ever love me, - What if I never get breasts? I can't believe the test is today, - I have the worst... - Get rid of the students! It's that easy, - He has the cutest butt, - I hate her, Here. It's happened before. A man in Ecuador. Quite recently. - Can we contact him? - I'd say not. - He can't communicate with anyone. - Dead? No, he's in complete isolation. The power. He can't shut it off. It's gotta get better, Please, tell me it gets better, I hate school, Am I normal? Are you through with the mashed potatoes? She doesn't even know I'm here, Come on, come on! She has the sweetest face I ever saw, If I stand in just the right place... The test is today, This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all, - She's really nuts, - I hate being here, She touched me! - I think she's waking up, - Oh, thank God, - I'm cold, - Are you all right? I told them not to move you. They probably severed your spinal cord. I'm OK. No, really. I'm OK. Listen. There's a killer in the cafeteria. See? I've been saying for years the lunch lady will do us all in with that mulligan stew. - What the hell's a mulligan? - Someone was thinking it. "This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all." I have to find them. Did you recognise a voice? - No. - Boy or girl? I don't know. I mean, it was hardly human. It was so full of anger and pain. - Count. - No, I have to find them. Are you sure they meant it? Who hasn't idly thought about takin' out the whole place with a semiautomatic? - I said idly. - I know the difference. He... she... whoever, they meant it. They're gonna do it. - She looks so tired, - How horrible, - I'm not getting any warmer, - I bet it was Hogan, Shut up! I'm sorry, I... just... Could you guys not think so loud? - Or so much? - You should go home. I'll take you home. Yeah, OK. No. I need you to go to the cafeteria. Make a list of everyone who's there. - We have to find the killer. - We'll do it. A list of all the students. Yeah. Nancy was there, and she's scary. Oh, teachers too. Mr Beech, he thought something about getting rid of all the students. I can't shut it out, Giles. It's like this invasion of my head. It's like there are these strangers walking around in there. Look at this. I can't even be around people any more. Not that they're clamouring to be near me anyway. Even you. I'm sorry, Buffy. It's hard for all of us. But Wesley and I are looking for a way to help. But I'll be OK, right? I mean, even if you can't get rid of it? You'll be fine. I promise. Hit doesn't go away, she'll go insane, I think we have everyone that was in the cafeteria. I'll do some computer work. Match it against FBI mass-murderer profiles. See if maybe we can rule some people out. I'm having trouble with the fact that one of us will gun everybody down for no reason. Because that never happens in American high schools! - It's almost trendy at this point. - Besides which, Sunnydale High? The centre of evil and all that? Let's get to work. We have till lunch time tomorrow. We hope. There. You look better already. - Thanks, Mom. - I'm just going to get you another pillow. - I really don't need one. - But you need another blanket. Mom, I'm fine. How about some soup? - Chicken and stars? - Mom, please, just come sit with me? I've... I've got laundry. Why are you... You had sex with Giles? - It was the candy. We were teenagers. - On the hood of a police car? I'll be downstairs. You feel better. Twice? OK, I've taken our list and narrowed it down to a dozen suspects. Here are your assignments. - I was hoping there'd be assignments. - I think I should work with Wesley. You have no shame. Like shame is something to be proud of? Be quiet. Sorry, but this is important. OK, talk to everyone on your list. And use the sample questions. Today, people. Oh, write neatly and label your work sheets. Fantasies are fun. Aren't they, Jonathan? I guess. We all have fantasies where we're powerful and respected. Where people pay attention to us. Maybe. But sometimes the fantasy isn't enough, is it, Jonathan? Sometimes we have to make it so people don't ignore us. Make them pay attention. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? You want me to pay attention? - For the yearbook? - Personality profiles. Can you ask it again? Sure. Do you ever feel you've created a false persona - the guy who does everything right? - How much of a strain does it put on you? - Uh, wow. I guess... Moderate strain? Is that a good answer? I wanna get this right. Yeah, that's good. Hi, Mr Beech. I was wondering. Were you planning on killing people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the yearbook. OK, so turn-offs include smoking, insensitive men and Birkenstocks. Now, your idea of the perfect romantic evening. Candy, let's start with you. Freddy? I should have just quit, Look at him smiling like he thinks I don't know about her, - I can't believe I'm getting away with this, - One more drink, that'll do it, Seems to be coming along all right. Buffy's being driven mad, we have no proof this will work, and it requires the heart of the second demon, which we have no idea how to get. - Negative thinking doesn't solve problems. - Who is going to get the demon heart? Burk. Do I often imagine classmates are spying on me or otherwise acting suspiciously? - Right. - Not till just now. What? Talk louder, dude. I'm just saying it's gotta be frustrating. Having the secret. You gotta be kinda filling up with resentment. Unexpressed rage just waiting to burst out? - Today at lunch? - What secret? Being gay? Man, I'm out. I'm so out I've got my grandma fixin' me up with guys. That's... nice. But it sounds like you're having a rough time with it? Look... Just do it. - That Freddy Iverson that does the paper... - He's gay? No, dude. But I bet he'd put in like a coming-out announcement for you. Something tasteful. Freddy? - He's the only one we couldn't find? - Freddy Iverson. The newspaper guy? But we can't figure out it's him without the work sheet. We do have this. Today's editorial, titled "Big Game Draws Mindless Braindead Mob." Does he mention the cheerleaders? Because we were on. I can't stand this. I keep wondering if I'm hurting her with my thoughts. You're not. Not any more. She can't pick one thought out of the din. I got it. - No. - I'm gonna help ya. Giles! Angel. Thank God. Are you all right? Do you hear thoughts? No. Did you find the killer? Oh, hey, Oz. You got me. - What are you gonna do, hold me down? - You'd better believe it, buster. You can't threaten a big murder without getting us pretty darn ticked. Murder? What murder? You're not here about the review? - The review? - Yeah. Last Thursday. "Dingoes Ate My Baby play as if they had Polish sausages taped to their fingers." Sorry, man. No, it's fair. I get a lot of hate mail, and I thought you were delivering some personally. If you find any announcements about me... - Xander, we have to figure this out. - We have no shot. It could be anyone. We lose. We still have a few minutes. You're OK! Can you hear thoughts? - Just when I wasn't thinkin' about sex. - OK, here's the new plan. We're going to get Snyder to evacuate the school. "By tomorrow, you'll all know what I've done. I'm sure you understand that I had to do it, and that although death is never easy, it's the only way." God! Doesn't anyone write in to praise the cheerleaders? - We are so unsung. - Jonathan. Oh! I had him in my grasp. - Slippery weasel. - Split up. Find him. Jonathan? Are you in here? Jonathan! Jello. I could have done that. Get away from me. OK, Jonathan, do you wanna point that somewhere else? Don't you try and stop me. No. No stopping. Just here for the view. Hey, look. City Hall. Go away. - Never gonna happen. - You think I won't use this? - I don't know, Jonathan. I just... - Stop doin' that. Doing what? Stop saying my name like we're friends. We're not friends. You all think I'm an idiot. A short idiot. I don't. I don't think about you much at all. Nobody here really does. Bugs you, doesn't it? You have all this pain and all these feelings, and nobody's really paying attention. You think I just want attention? No, I think you're up in the clock tower with a rifle because you want to blend in! Believe it or not, Jonathan, I understand about the pain. Oh, right. Because the burden of being beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler! You know what? I was wrong. You are an idiot. My life happens to, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than I can handle. And it's not just mine. Every person down there is ignoring your pain because they're too busy with their own. Beautiful ones, popular ones, the guys that pick on you... Everyone. If you could hear what they were feeling. The loneliness, the confusion. It looks quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening. You know I could have taken that by now? I know. I'd rather do it this way. I just wanted it to stop. Yeah, well, mass murder? Not recommended for that kind of pain. And prison is like school, only instead of noogies... - What are you talking about? - Actions having consequences. That stuff. I wouldn't ever hurt anybody. I came up here to kill myself, Rat poison! Step away from the food. - OK, let's calm down. - Vermin. You're all vermin. You come in here and you eat and you eat filth. I don't see this being settled with logic. - So you're feeling better about Angel? - Well, we talked. Then he ripped out the heart of a demon and fed it to me. Then we talked some more. See? That's how it should work. - Morning. - Hi, Giles. I'll go to the yearbook office to give them the murderer profiles. They're really a good read. - Bye. - See ya. - How are you? - Lovin' the quiet. Nobody in here but me. - Jonathan, how's he? - Pretty crappy. His parents are freaking, he got suspended, and toting a piece - not winning him a place with the in-crowd. But I think he's dealing. It was good of you to check on him. Well, it's nice to be able to help someone in a non-slaying capacity. Except he's starting to get that look, like he's gonna ask me to prom. - It'd probably boost his self-esteem if you... - What am I? St Buffy? He's like three feet tall.
