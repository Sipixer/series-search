# So don't forget me # I'll say it, replay it Passion, It lies in all of us.... ..sleeping, waiting, And though unwanted, unbidden.... ..it will stir, open its jaws... ..and howl, # I'm on my knees to pray # You'd think I learn by now # There's never an easy way # I'll get through somehow It speaks to us.... ..guides us, Passion rules us all... ..and we obey, What other choice do we have? - He was in my room. - Who? Angel. He was in my room last night. - Are you sure? - Positive. When I woke up, I found a picture he'd left me on my pillow. - A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy. - I thought vampires had to be invited in. Yes, but once you've invited them in, then they're always welcome. There may be a lesson for you gals about inviting strange men into your bedrooms. Oh, God! I invited him in my car once. That means he can come into my car whenever he wants. You're doomed to having to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they want. And those guys never chip in for gas. There has to be some sort of spell to reverse the invitation. Like a barrier - a "no shoes, no pulse, no service" thing? - Yeah, that works for a car, too? - Yes, well, I can check on my... Hello? Have you ever heard of knocking? We're supposed to get some books. - On Stalin. - Does this look like a Barnes & Noble? - This is the school library, Xander. - Since when? Uh, yes. Third row, historical biographies. Thanks. What? Oh... Hey, did you say that was the...? Hello? So, Angel has decided to step up his harassment of you. By sneaking in her room and leaving stuff at night? Why doesn't he just slit her throat or strangle her while she's sleeping or cut her heart out? I'm trying to help. Yes. Look, it's classic battle strategy to throw one's opponent off his game. He's just trying to provoke you. To taunt you. To goad you into some mishap of some sort. The nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah approach to battle. Yes. Once more you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest form. Angel once told me that when he was obsessed with Drusilla,... ..the first thing he did was to kill her family. - Your mom... - I know. I have to tell her something. - The truth? - No, you can't do that. The more people who know, the more it cheapens it for us. I've gotta tell her something. Giles, Angel has access to my house and I'm not always there. - I can't protect her. - I told you, I will find a spell. - What about until you find a spell? - You are welcome to ride with me in my car. Buffy, I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you keep a level head. That's easy for you to say. You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom. I know how hard this is for you. OK, I don't. But as the Slayer, you don't have the luxury of being a slave to your passions. You mustn't let Angel get to you, no matter how provocative he may be. So what you're basically saying is just ignore him and maybe he'll go away? - Precisely. - How come Buffy doesn't get a snotty... .."once again you boil it down to the simplest form" thing? Watcher's pet! I need your sample spreadsheets by the end of the week. And I want both a paper printout and a copy on disk. Thank you. - Willow. - Yes? Uh, I might be a little late tomorrow. Do you think you could cover my class till I show? Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure! - Cool. - Wait. What if they don't recognise my authority? What if they try to convince me that you always let them leave early? - What if there's a fire drill? Or a fire?! - Willow... you're gonna be fine. - And I'll try not to be too late, OK? - OK, good. Earlier is good. Will I have the power to assign detention? Or make 'em run laps? - Hey, Will. - Hey, Buffy. Rupert. I thought I might take in a class. I could use someone who knows where they are. Sorry. I have to talk to her. Teachers are to be respected, even if they're only filling in,... ..because otherwise chaos could ensue. How have you been? Uh, not so good, actually. Since Angel lost his soul, he's regained his sense of whimsy. - That sounds bad. - He's been in Buffy's bedroom. I need to drum up a spell to keep him out of the house. This might help. I've been doin' a little reading since Angel changed. - I don't think you have that one. - Thank you. So how's Buffy doing? How do you think? - I know you feel betrayed. - Yes, that's a side effect of betrayal. Rupert... I was raised by the people that Angel hurt the most. My duty to them was the first thing I was ever taught. I didn't come here to hurt anyone. And I lied to you because I thought it was the right thing to do. I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know I was gonna fall in love with you. Oh, God... Is it too late to take that back? Do you want to? I just wanna be right with you. I don't expect more. I just want so badly to make all this up to you. I understand. But I'm not the one you need to make it up to. Thank you for the book. OK... What's wrong? - It's nothing. - Come on, you can tell me anything, I've read all the parenting books. You cannot surprise me. Do you remember that guy Angel? Angel? The, um... the college boy who was tutoring you in history? Right. He... I... Oh, God. Um... We're sort of dating. Were dating. Going through a serious "off again" phase right now. Don't tell me. He's changed? He's not the same guy you fell for? In a nutshell. Anyway, since he changed, he's been kinda following me around. - He's having trouble letting go. - Buffy, has he done anything? No! No, it's not like that. He's just been hanging around. A lot. Just sending me notes, that kind of thing. I just don't wanna see him right now. I mean, If he shows up, I'll talk to him. Just... ..don't invite him in. I agree with Giles. You need to just try and not let him get to you. Angel's only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid. I swear, men can be such jerks sometimes. Dead or alive. I just hope Giles can find a keep-out spell soon, I know I'll sleep easier when I can... sleep easier. I'm sure he will. He's, like, Book Man. Until then, try and keep happy thoughts and... And what? Willow? Willow? Thanks for having me over, Buffy. Especially on a school night an' all. No problem. Hey, sorry about your fish. It's OK. We hadn't really had time to bond yet. Although, for the first time, I'm glad my parents didn't let me have a puppy. It's so weird. Every time something like this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy I knew. Well, sort of, except... Except what? You're still the only thing he thinks about. I brought something for you. Poor thing. She's an orphan. Her owner died... ..without a fight. Do you like her? Mm? I brought her especially for you, to cheer you up. And I've named her Sunshine. Open wide. Come on, love. You need to eat something to keep your strength up. Now... open up for Mommy! I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru! Why not? She already bathes you, carries you around and changes you like a child. Why, Angel, where have you been? The sun is almost up and it can be so hurtful. - We were worried. - No, we weren't. You must forgive Spike. He's just a bit testy tonight. Doesn't get out much any more. Well, maybe next time I'll bring you with me, Spike. It might be handy to have you around if I ever need a good parking space. Have you forgotten you're a bloody guest in my bloody home? And as a guest, if there's anything I can do for you,... ..any responsibility I can assume while you're spinning your wheels... - Anything I'm not already doing, that is. - That's enough! You two boys... ..fighting over me an' all... ..makes a girl feel... - Dru, what is it, pet? - The air... ..it worries. Someone, an old enemy, is seeking help. Help to destroy our happy home. Welcome. How may I serve you today? Love potion? Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful... I need an orb of Thesulah. You're in the trade! Sorry about the spiel, but around Valentine's Day... ..I get a lot of tourists shopping for love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers. Sad fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay the rent around here. - So how'd you hear about us? - My Uncle Enyos told me about you. So you're Janna, then. I'm sorry to hear about your uncle. - Thank you. - He was a good customer. Well, there you go. One Thesulan orb: spirit vault for the rituals of the undead. I don't get many calls for those lately. Sold a couple as New Age paperweights last year. I just love those New Agers. They helped to send my youngest to college. By the way, you do know the transliteration annals for the Ritual of the Undead were lost? Without the annals, the text is gibberish. And without a translated text, the orbs of Thesulah are pretty much useless. I know. I mentioned it because I have a policy of no refunds. It's OK. I'm working on a computer program... ..to translate the Romanian to English based on a random sampling of the text. Ugh! I don't like computers. - They give me the willies. - Well, thank you. You're welcome. By the way, not that it's any of my business,... ..but what are you planning on conjuring up if you can decipher the text? - A present for a friend of mine. - Really? What are you gonna give him? His soul. Good morning. What did you two do last night? We had kind of a "pyjama party sleepover with weapons" thing. I don't suppose you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment? I have to go. I have to teach in five minutes. I have to arrive early to glare disapprovingly at the stragglers. Oh, darn. She's here. Five hours of lesson planning yesterday down the drain. You know what? I'll see you in class. - Hey. - Hi. Is there something that...? Did you want something? Look, I know you feel badly about what happened and I just wanted to say... Good. Keep it up. - Don't worry, I will. - Wait. He misses you. He doesn't say anything to me, but I know he does. And I don't want him to be lonely. I don't want anyone to. Buffy, you know that if I have a chance to make this up... We're good here. Let's just leave it. It was here somewhere. Oh, that's it. Could you hang those up? Thank you. Buffy. So how was your night? Sleepless, but no human fatalities. I found a ritual to revoke the invitation to... to vampires. Thank goodness! I actually had to talk my grandmother into switching cars last night. The ritual's fairly basic. It's the recitation of a few rhyming couplets,... ..burning of moss herbs, sprinkling of holy water... - All stuff I have in my house. - Hanging crosses... - I'll have a hard time explaining this to Dad. - You really think it'll bother him? Ira Rosenberg's only daughter nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall? I have to go to Xander's house just to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas, - I see your point. - It is worthwhile... ..to see him do the Snoopy dance! Willow, are you aware that there are no fish in your aquarium? Cordelia, we've already done your car. - Call it a night, if you want. - Right. Thanks. And you know I'd do the same for you if you had a social life. This must be for you. It's for you. Mom. Mrs Summers, I need to talk to you. You're Angel. - Did Buffy tell you about us? - She wants you to leave her alone. - Oh, I can't. I can't do that. - You're scaring her. You have to help me. Joyce, I need to be with her. You can convince her. You have to convince her. Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone. You have to talk to her for me. Tell her I need her. Please, look, I just want to get inside, OK? You don't understand, Joyce. I'll die without Buffy. She'll die without me. - Are you threatening her? - Please! Why is she doing this to me? I'm calling the police, now. I haven't been able to sleep since the night we made love. I need her. I know you understand. Just leave us alone. "..verbis consensus recisus est, " Sorry, Angel. I've changed the locks. Hello? Hey. - You're working late. - Special project. I spoke to Buffy today. Yes? She said you missed me. Well, she's... a meddlesome girl. Rupert... OK, I don't want to say anything if I'm wrong, but I may have some news. I need to finish up here. Could I see you later? Yes, yes... You could stop by my house. OK. Good. Sorry, honey. We're closed. - What do you want? - Miss Sunshine tells me you had a visitor. But she worries. She wants to know what you and the mean teacher talked about. Come on. Come on. That's it. It's gonna work! This... will work. Angel. - How did you get in here? - I was invited. The sign in front of the school: "Formatia trans sicere educatorum, " "Enter all ye who seek knowledge." What can I say? I'm a knowledge seeker. Angel, I've got good news. I heard. You went shopping at the local boogedy-boogedy store. The orb of Thesulah. If memory serves, this is supposed to summon a person's soul... ..from the ether. Store it until it can be transferred. You know what I hate most about these things? They're so damn fragile. Must be that shoddy, gypsy craftsmanship, huh? I'm amazed how much the world has changed in just two and a half centuries. It's a miracle to me. You put the secrets to restoring my soul in here! It comes out here! "The Ritual of Restoration." Wow. This... This brings back memories. - Wait, that's your... - My cure? No, thanks. Been there, done that... Déjà vu just isn't what it used to be. Boy, isn't this my lucky day? The computer... ..and the pages. Looks like I get to kill two birds... ..with one stone. The teacher... makes... three. Oh, good. I need to work up an appetite first. Sorry, Jenny. This is where you get off. I never get tired of doing that. - Willow. Good evening. - Hi. Come on in. - Here's the book. - Right. I should do my apartment tonight. - Did the ritual go all right? - Yeah, it went fine. Well, it went fine until Angel showed up and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had... Well, you know. That they had... you know. - You do know, right? - Oh! Yes, yes, sorry. Oh, good. Because I just realised that, being a librarian, maybe you didn't know. No, thank you. I got it. You would have been proud of her, though. She totally kept her cool. OK, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by. Well, do you... Perhaps I should intervene on Buffy's behalf with her mother? Maybe say something? Sure. Like, what would you say? - You will tell Buffy I dropped by? - You bet. That stuff with the Latin and the herbs, he's just real superstitious. - We just thought if... - Was he the first? No, wait. I don't want to know. I don't think I want to. Yeah, he was the first. I mean, the only. - He's older than you. - I know. Too old, Buffy. And he's obviously not very stable. I really wish... I just thought you would show more judgement. He wasn't like this before. Are you in love with him? - I was. - Were you careful? - Mom, this is no time... - Don't "Mom" me!. You can't get out of this. You had sex with a boy you didn't even tell me you were dating! - I made a mistake. - Don't just say that to shut me up... - ..because I think you really did. - I know that! - I can't tell you everything. - How about anything? Buffy, you can shut me out of your life. I am used to that. But don't expect me to ever stop caring about you, because it's never gonna happen. I love you more than anything in the world. That would be your cue to roll your eyes and tell me I'm grossing you out. You're not. Oh, well... I guess that was "the talk". So how'd it go? I don't know. It was my first. Hello? Jenny? It's me. # Sei mia # V'aspettan gli amici # Già mi mandi via? # Vorrei dir, ma non oso # Di'! # O soave fanciulla # O dolce viso di mite circonfuso alba lunar # In te ravviso # Il sogno ch'io vorrei sempre sognar! # Ah, tu sol comandi, amor! # Le dolcezze estreme # Tu sol comandi, amor! Mr Giles, I need to ask you to come with us. Just to answer a few questions. Of course. Yes. Procedure. I need to make a phone call,... ..if that's all right? Passion is the source of our finest moments: ..the joy of love.... ..the clarity of hatred... ..and the ecstasy of grief, Giles? Really? No... No! - Where's Giles? - No luck. By the time I got to the station, he'd left. They just wanted to ask some questions. - Will you drive us to Giles' house? - Of course. Don't you think he wants to be left alone? I'm not worried about what he wants. I'm worried about what he's gonna do. Hello? Giles? I guess Giles had a big night planned tonight. Giles didn't set this up. Angel did. This is the wrapping for the gift. Oh, man. Poor Giles. - All his weapons are gone. - But I thought he kept them at the library. No, those are his everyday weapons. These were his good weapons, the ones he breaks out when company comes to visit. - So he's not here? - Then where is he? - He'll go to wherever Angel is. - That means the factory, right? - So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel. - It's about time somebody did. - Xander! - Sorry, but I hated Angel long before you did. I deserve something for not saying "I told you so" before now. If Giles wants to go after the fiend that murdered his girlfriend,... ..I say "Faster, pussycat. Kill, kill!" - You're right. - Thank you. Only one thing wrong with Giles' revenge scenario. - And what's that? - It's gonna get him killed. Are you insane? We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds. But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul. What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. Because this new, improved one is not playing with a full sack. I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke. But his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer. Don't worry, Roller Boy. I've got everything under control. Whatever happened to wooden stakes? Uh-uh. No fair going into the ring unless he tags you first. All right. You've had your fun. But you know what it's time for now? My fun! Gonna let your old man just burn? Why did you come here? This wasn't your fight! Are you trying to get yourself killed? You can't leave me! I can't do this alone. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear, If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace.... ..but we would be hollow: ..empty rooms, shuttered and dank, Without passion.... ..we'd be truly dead, In my years as... Watcher,... ..I've buried too many people,... ..but Jenny was the first I've loved. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you,... ..for her,... ..when I had the chance. I wasn't ready, But I think I finally am, Hi. Principal Snyder asked me to fill in for Ms Calendar... ..until the new computer-science teacher arrives. So, I'm just gonna stick to the lesson plan she left.
