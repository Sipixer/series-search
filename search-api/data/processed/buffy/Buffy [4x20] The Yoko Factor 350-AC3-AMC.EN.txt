Helping an HST escape is a court-martial offence. - You'll make matters worse. - Talk later. Stealthy escape now. Buffy. I leave now, I can't ever come back. Spike, come with me. You're going to help me with my problem. I'm going to help you with yours. - You have to be with the person you love. - I am. It's complicated because of Tara. Are you freaked? I have to tell you some stuff about my past. And it's not all stuff you’re gonna like. And on "Angel": You didn't think I'd find you, did you? - This won't happen. - You'll stop me? - Don't. - Faith, go. Don't you move a... I have someone in my life now, that I love. You don't know me now, so don't come here with your new life and expect me to do things your way. Go home. - And the men? - These are exceptional boys. Their capture ratio just keeps increasing. They're keeping it together. Morale's a problem. The death of Professor Walsh, the escape of the prototype... Controlling the HSTs is getting harder. We have overcrowding in the containment areas. - Quite a mess. - It's not my mess, sir. I'm just holding the fort while you figure out what you wanna do with the place. This incident with Finn was unfortunate. Fell in with a bad crowd. Frankly, I don't think he was ever the soldier you all hoped he was. - Boy thinks too much. - Nevertheless, we want him back. - The government's invested... - We'll catch up to him. My feeling is he won't stray too far from the girl. Yes... Buffy Summers. Our data banks don’t have much on her. She's just a girl. She's a lot more than that. - The Slayer's dangerous. - Yes. She makes things interesting. No. See, you're not getting it, Mr Bits. You're gonna be interestingly dead. Little Miss Tiny bollockses up the plans of every would-be unstoppable bad-ass who sets foot in this town. I just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, the Slayer's gonna be right in the thick of it. - You ready for that? - I'm counting on it. - Two slayers. - That's right. - And you killed them both? - Yeah. - I killed the hell out of them. - Yet you fear this one? Watch it, mate. I don't fear anything, just know my enemies. Do you? Then why haven't you killed this slayer yet? Because. Stinking rotten luck is why. On top of that, now I've got this buggering chip up my head. Yes. Your behaviour-modification circuitry. I know what you feel. - Not likely. - You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal, pure in its ferocity, unable to actualise the urges within. Clinging to one truth. Like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosed glass. That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitably it will break free and savage the land again. I will make you whole again. Make you savage. Wow. I mean, yeah. I get why the demons all fall in line with you. You're like Tony Robbins, if he was a big, scary Frankenstein-looking... You're exactly like Tony Robbins. I will restore you to what you once were, when I have the Slayer how and where I want her. Easier said. She's crafty, her and her little friends. - Friends? - There's your... What do you call it? Variable. The Slayer's got pals. You want even odds in a fight? You don't want the Slayerettes about. Take them away from her. Now, there's a plan. Working solo, she won't have a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins. Plus, it'll make her miserable. And I never get tired of that. Yeah. Leave 'em to me. You can't hurt them. What can you do to make sure they're out of the picture? Not a blessed thing. They're gonna do it for me. Know if she's back yet? LA Woman? Haven't heard from her. She'll probably come here first thing, though. Who's your buddy? So you don't have to be GI Joe while your civvies are gettin' washed. Try those on. You'll feel like a new man. Would this man have a bright red nose and big, floppy feet? - I'm sorry. That's the cabin fever talking. - But as post-apocalypse splendour goes... - I've done wonders with the place. - Yeah. Still, the sooner Buffy gets back, the better I'll feel. You and me both, big guy. I take it you're not an Angel fan either? Well, it's not like I hate the guy. Just, you know, the guts part of him. Can't blame you. But to be fair, it's not him you hate. It's the curse. Right? What did Buffy tell you? About Angel? Everything. More than I wanted to know sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He killed people. She cured him. He left. - Interesting little curse. - One moment's happiness. - What do you mean? - You know, it's his trigger. Angel's an OK guy, if he's mopy and sad and brooding, but you give him even one second of pure, real pleasure... - And that sets him off? - Only in a kill-your-friends kind of way. And you know what makes Angel happiest? I'll give you a hint. It's not crème brûlée. Buffy. Sex with Buffy. She kind of left that part out? Yeah, she did. That explains a lot of things that I wish weren't explained. That's all ancient history. She went running to LA to bone up on her history. No. I'm sure it's boneless. She just needs to make sure everything's OK. She's probably back already. Maybe. You'll feel a lot better when you see her. I guess we'll see. lf I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? Well, I must be travelling on now There's too many places I've got to see And if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same Cos I'm as free as a bird now... For someone who's got "watcher" on his résumé, you might wanna cast an eye to the front door every now and again. What do you want? Knew I left one. - Buffy around? - Why? I need to speak to the lady of the house. Be a pet and give her a message. Tell her I might have something she might want. And what might that something be? Information. Highly classified. Not cheap word-on-the-street prattle. I'm talking about the good stuff. Thrill me. It's nothing I know. Think I'd come running over saying, "I've got a secret, beat me till I talk"? There's files in the Initiative. I'm pretty sure I know where. - Files? - Yeah. Secrets. Mission statements. Design schematics. All of Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots of tidbits about... - Adam. - Well, yeah. Say someone was to risk his life and limb... Limb, anyway, to obtain said files. It might be worth a little something. At this point a cynical person might think that you were offering just what we need when we need it most. That person'd be right, Rupert. Supply and demand. - And it won't be cheap this time. - What do you want? A year's supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merry bushels of cash and, most important, a guarantee that I'm not to be in any way slain. Done. With a smile and a nod from you? Sorry. Not close to good enough. This deal's with the Slayer. - I'll tell her. - You'll tell her? Great comfort, that. What makes you think she'll listen to you? Because. - Very convincing. - I'm her watcher. I think you're neglecting the past tense there, Rupert. Besides, she barely listened to you when you were in charge. - I've seen the way she treats you. - Yes? And how's that? Very much like a retired librarian. I've got what she wants as long as she has what I want. Spread the word. She knows where to find me. I'll think about it. I keep thinking "OK, that's the cutest thing ever." And then she does something cuter and completely resets the whole scale. - Did you see her yawn earlier? - Yes. I thought I was gonna die. - I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico. - We've got to get her a real name. It's so cool that she's ours. Yours. That she's yours is cool. She can be ours if you want. You still need an elective. How about sophomore-level psychology? Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh. Maybe something fun like drama. I could be dramatic. You cannot have more catnip. You have a catnip problem. Definitely drama. I haven't even dealt with the housing situation yet. Have you done anything? I hear there's some off-campus places that are cool for groups to go in on. I just figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again. We haven't really talked about it. I used to assume we'd be roomies through grad school, well into little-old-ladyhood. You know, cheatin' at bingo together and forgettin' to take our pills. But? But I don't know. It hardly feels like we're roomies now. She's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too. I guess I should ask her. - Riley. - I got a little tired of sitting around waiting. - So... - You joined the circus? Xander took my clothes to clean 'em. Left me these. Does he hate me in some way I don't know about yet? I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform. Is it OK for you to be here? You tell me. I just meant with the government branch hunting you down and all. I'm good. It took me a while, but I patched into their frequency. - Can't sneak up on a guy if he's listening in. - You're the sneakiest. Why they hired me. You OK? Yeah. I just... - Angel kind of upset me. - How? - It's not that interesting. - Got my attention. He just spun my head a little. You don't wanna talk about it. Deconstructing Angel can wait. Right now I just wanna get out there and patrol and find Adam. We can talk about it later. It's the pants, isn't it? It's OK. I couldn't take me seriously in these either. Riley, it's not that big a deal. Why don't I get out of your face? You had a long trip. - You don't have to go. - It's OK. Besides, I have to recharge them every two hours or they go dead on me. OK. Here. You should've saved the ensemble from last time. - I'm not a clothing delivery service. - He is, kind of. He did Riley yesterday. Hello. This is just swell. Gotta say, liking this quite a lot. Kinda changes the balance of power... Come on. You gotta be kidding. That chip in your head means you can't even point a gun? How humiliating. Doesn't work anyway. It's a fake. - Not even a decorative gun? - Give it up for American chipmanship. It doesn't work? What about self-defence? I'm taking a risk here, you know. Can I tell you how much I really don't care? Attitude. See how far that'll take you in boot camp. I hope you get one of those tough-as-nails drill sergeants who's only hard on the men to keep them alive when the bullets start flying. - I love that stuff. - Boot camp? Yeah, like, I'd go there. What, you changed your mind? Not gonna join? - You're joining the army? - OK. One: Ow. Two: Where'd you get that idea? Three: Ow. - I'm not joining the army. - Good. Stopped that nonsense just in time. I was never... Who'd you hear this from? Your girlie mates were talking. Something about being all you can be. Or all you can be. You know, having a laugh. Figured you were signin' up. Have you got anything larger in the toy-gun line? Can you believe this? Like I'm some sort of useless lunk. It happens I'm good at a lot of things. I help out with all kinds of stuff. I have skills and stratagems. I'm very... Help me out. - He's a Viking in the sack. - Terrific. You didn't have these cleaned. This is so like them, lately. It's all about them and the college life. You know what college is? It's high school only without the actual going to class. High school was kinda like that, too. The point is, I'm working hard to make a living. It's nothing but a huge joke to them. "Xander got fired from Starbucks. Xander got fired from that phone-sex line." - They look down on you. - And they hate you. - But they don't look down on me. - It was just a laugh. There's no need to go insane over it. - Is anybody talking to you? - Sir, no, sir. - Don't shoot. - Give me a reason not to. - You're killing humans now? - Not yet. Beating you senseless should do. I can have a patrol here in under a minute. Here's the plan. You go your way, I'll go mine. - I'm checking out that cave. - My orders exactly. - Alone? - We're spread a little thin, so yeah. - Family's tearing apart. - Family? What kind of family are you? Corleones? Weren't until you showed up. What? No girls in the club? You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's had? A big head on that skinny body. No. You're just the first to get him to commit treason. Riley had a career. He had a future till he met you, and yeah, I got a problem with that. A future? A future doing what? Illegal experiments? Torture? Murder? - So killing someone isn't a problem for you? - Less and less. Get the hell out before l... Touch me and you'll see what slayer strength is like. - I think it's about time you showed me, then. - Yes. I think that would be interesting. Get out of here. I'm not moving. - Thank you. - Go. Get out. No. - I think I lost the buggers. - Any luck with the disk? I took what they had. Should be something useful on one of 'em. - Hope so. - What are we looking for? - Anything about Adam. - Any problems getting in and out? No. A couple of them made me on the way out, but I took care of 'em. Gave them a good running-away-from, did you? Yeah. When do I get paid? When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful. I could've gone straight to the Slayer, you know. I let you pretend you're in charge. Now you need Red's permission to finish the deal? As soon as we see what's on the disks. - It looks like gibberish. - Gibberish? - They're encrypted. - Wonderful. Can you fix 'em? Crack a government encryption code on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie. You're not exactly the whiz these days either. God, I'm never gonna get paid. - I am a whiz. - She is a whiz. If ever a whiz there was. I just need some time. No. I just heard you weren't... Your mates said you weren't playing with computers so much. Into the new thing. - What new thing? - You know, you two. - The whole Wicca thing. - They were talking about that? Can we get back to business? I've got a deal at stake. - What did they say? - That it's a phase. You'll get over it. What? Who said that? Was it Buffy? Cos, you know what she means by... No, she was defending you cos Xander said you were just being trendy. - Trendy? - I don't know what they were going on about. A person wants to be a witch, that's their business. - I knew Buffy was freaked. - You should talk to her. I'm sure... Pressing business, ladies. Don't wanna get sidetracked. Still got your monsters to fight. Cell capacity maxed out three days ago, sir. At this pace, there'll be nowhere to contain the hostiles. They're animals. We pack 'em in until we're out of room, then we pack 'em in some more. - They'll start tearing each other apart, sir. - I have no problem with that scenario. Backup. Request immediate backup. Over. They're tearing us apart over here. Two men down. Come out of nowhere. Mayday. Repeat. Mayday. Immediate backup. We're in the alley behind the school building. Where the hell is... Back. Fallback. It's coming. Riley Finn. I know you? We have a friend in common. Angel. Welcoming committee your idea? The way I heard it, you were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you? Don't push me, boy. Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy that would make you lose your soul? That'd be between me and her. - Where do you think you're going? - To see an old girlfriend. - You think I'll let that happen? - Think you can stop me? I surely do. - Angel. - Hi. Can I come in? I guess. I need a little more than that. Come in. - You're hurt. - You too. I'll live. Wanna tell me who ran your face into a doorknob? Not really. It's not world-in-peril stuff. Let me guess. You thought of something else really hurtful to say and couldn't use the phone because the funniest part is the look on my face... Buffy, please. I really don't have a lot of time. What's going on? I told you you weren't coming near her. You've got to be kidding me. This is why you came? No. This was an accident. Running your car into a tree is an accident. Running your fist into a face is a plan. - Please explain this to me. - Put that gun down. It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinkin' not. He attacked four of my men, Buffy. He's up to his old tricks. - He won't hurt anybody. Tell him. - Might hurt you. - Please try. - Some threat. You can barely stand. - Trigger finger feels OK. - You actually sleep with this guy? OK, stop it! That is enough! I see one more display of testosterone poisoning and I'll put you both in hospital. Anybody think I'm exaggerating? He started... Riley. I'm sorry. Just wanted to know that you were safe. I need to talk to Angel for a minute. - What? - Riley, please. I'm not leaving this room. I mean it. I'm not movin' a muscle. OK. I come to see you, to help you, and you treat me like I'm just your ex. - Technically... - Shut up. Then you order me out of your city. Then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend? I would really like to know: what the hell are you trying to do? I was trying to make things better. - It's goin' pretty good, don't you think? - Swell. I couldn't leave it like that. The way I spoke to you. I came to apologise. I had no right. And Riley? I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in the middle. He wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt. Put yourself in his place. I get it. You weren't entirely wrong, what you said in LA. We don't live in each other's worlds any more. I had no right to barge in on yours and make judgments. I'm still sorry. Thank you. And next time I'll apologise by phone. Things are pretty tense around here. - They really are. - Can I do anything? Honestly? I think the best thing you can do right now is... OK. It means a lot that you came. - Riley? - Yeah? I don't like him. Thank you. Now that was fun. You were successful? - Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too. - You're sure? I feel it in my bones. Call it "the Yoko Factor". Don't tell me you've never heard of the Beatles? I have. I like "Helter Skelter". What a surprise. The point is, they were once a real powerful group. It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world. When they broke up, everyone blamed Yoko. But the group split itself apart. She just happened to be there. You know how it is with kids. They go off to college and grow apart. The way of the world. So you separated the Slayer from her friends. I'm pleased. Since we've got all our ducks in a row and not talking to each other, I guess it's time for the grand plan. The one where I get the chipectomy? You got everything you need? No. There's one more thing. How bad are you hurt? Don't know yet. Night's still young. Riley, I have to tell you something. - Figured. - Maybe you wanna sit down. I'm fine. - Riley, l... - Wait. Me first. Buffy... I feel like we've gotten really close. At least, I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel or your relationship with him. But all I ask is, if you’re gonna break my heart, do it fast. What? - You think that Angel and l... - Didn't you? No. Of course not. How can you even ask me that? - I don't know. Xander said... - Xander? - He's the deadest man in Deadonia. - No. It's not his fault. I prodded, and he explained how Angel went bad. The trigger. After that, I went a little nuts. On the one hand, I should believe in us. But, on the other, sometimes things happen between exes and when I saw he was bad... He's not bad. Seriously? That's a good day? There you go. Even when he's good, he's all Mr Billowy-Coat King of Pain. - Girls really like that... - Riley, stop. See? Nuts. Have I ever given you any reason to feel that you can't trust me? No. Then why with the crazy? Because I'm so in love with you I can't think straight. Tell me about it. Riley. I still have to tell you something. - And there's no easy way to... - Just say it. Forrest is dead. I'm so sorry. There was a fight. Adam killed him. I barely got away. I know there's nothing that I can say that's gonna make this better. But we will find this thing and destroy it. I have to go. - Are you sure? - I have to go now. It's still encrypted. Willow's working really hard on it. OK. How long before you uncrypt it? Hours. Days, maybe. Anyone suggesting months would not be accused of crazy talk. Whatever happened to Latin? At least when that made no sense, the Church approved. I can't wait around, Will. The disk is no good to me unless you crack it soon. We worked really hard getting that. - Xander delivered clothing. - Church-approved. Sorry, you guys. We're on a clock here. Adam was at that cave, so maybe he was there for a reason. I could go back, scope it out, track him if I have to. Right. Then maybe you'll get lucky and he'll still be there. He can rip your arms off for you. Buffy, you can't go back alone. You never train with me. He'll kick your arse. - Giles. - Sorry. Was it a bit honest? Terribly sorry. So she doesn't go alone. Giles, weapons all around. You're not going, Xander. You'd get hurt. OK, you and Willow do the superpower thing. I'll putt around the Batcave with Alfred here. No, I am no Alfred, sir. No, you forget. Alfred had a job. Willow is not going either. I'm doing it alone. Great. And then, when you have your new "no arms", we can say "It's a good thing we didn't get in the way of that." Maybe we can help in other ways. Want some new fighting pants, Buff? - You guys, this isn't helping. - Wow. We're already in the way. We're good at this. I'm so good you might have to ship me off to the army to get me out of the way. - The army? - You didn't know I knew, did ya? - You two talking about me behind my back. - Us talking about you? How about you telling Riley every last detail of my life with Angel? Besides, when is there any "us two"? You two are the two who are "the two". I'm the other one. But maybe that all changes when I'm doing sit-ups over at Fort Dix? Fort Dix? - Are you drunk? - Yes. Quite a bit, actually. Stop it. - This is stupid. - Stupid? You finally had the guts to say it to my face. I didn't say you were stupid. So stop being an idiot and let me fix this. OK, I need you. I need both of you, all the time. Just not now. - Adam is very dangerous. - Wait. How do you need me, really? You're good with the computer stuff, usually. - And there's the witch stuff. - "Witch stuff"? - What exactly do you mean by "witch stuff"? - You guys, what is happening? This is crazy. No, it's not. It's all finally making perfect sense. I'm not going to miss a moment of it. You think this'll go on for a while? Hard to say. - Nice bathroom. - Like the tile. If I did join the army, I'd be great. You know why? I might get a job that couldn't be done by a Border collie. - That's it. I'm going to bed. - You'd do wonderful in the army. Think the umbilical cord between you and Anya could stretch that far? I knew it. I knew you hated her. I'm not the one being judgmental here. - I'll leave that to you and Buffy. - Judgmental? If I was any more open-minded about the choices you make my brain would fall out. And superior. Don't forget that. You may be better than us. It doesn't mean you can be superior. You guys, stop this. What happened to you today? It's not today. Buffy, things have been wrong for a while. - Don't you see that? - What do you mean, wrong? They certainly haven't been right, since Tara. We have to face it. You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend. No. It was bad before that. Since you two went off to college and forgot about me. Just left me in the basement to... Tara's your girlfriend? - Bloody hell. - Enough. All I know is, you wanna help, right? Be part of the team? - I don't... - No, you said you wanted to go. So let's go. All of us. We'll go to the cave with you two attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoe. Maybe that's the secret way to kill Adam. - Buffy... - Is that it? Is that how you can help? You're not answering me. How can you possibly help? So I guess I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One and her friends. If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on.
