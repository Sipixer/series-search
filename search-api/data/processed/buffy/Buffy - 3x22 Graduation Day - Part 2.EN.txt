I want my life to be with you. - I don't. - I can't believe you're breaking up with me. Angel. It's poison. I can feel it. The only way to cure this thing is to drain the blood of a slayer. Angel needs to drain a slayer, then I'll bring him one. You killed me. There's nobody here, sir. No. No, she'd take the fight outside. My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up. We have to find them. Put everyone on it. Do it now. - But, sir, the Ascension. - Find them! Faith's a good girl. She can take anything they'll throw at her. She's gonna be all right. She'll be all right. She'll be all right. - Any word from Buffy? - Not yet. Your coffee, brewed from the finest Colombian lighter fluid. Thank you. Horrible. - Aren't you supposed to be drinking tea? - Tea is soothing. I wish to be tense. OK. But you're destroying a perfectly good cultural stereotype here. Look through the Kippler volumes. Any reference to the demon Olvikan - powers, weaknesses, hat size. - There's got to be something. - Still battin' zero? But I mean... in cricket? - Cordy, what's up? - I demand an explanation. - For what? - Wesley. Inbreeding? So very funny. Any minute I'm sure to laugh. He just called. He could hardly speak, he was so upset. He said there was something about a fight. And he's leaving the county. Should I assay remorse? Just tell me what's going on. Buffy's quit the Council. She'll not be working with Wesley from now on. - But he's her watcher. - Buffy no longer needs a watcher. Well, does he have to leave the county? You got fired and you still hang around like a big loser. Why can't he? Cordelia, we're trying to stop a massacre here. Wanna give us a hand? Sure. It's just such a Buffy thing to do. She's always thinking of herself. You're awake. You've been watching over me? Well, we've been takin' turns. I thought... I thought I'd never see you again. I can't leave you. I was wrong. I need you. You mean you need Buffy. - Willow? - Yes! Right! Willow. - Where is she? - She'll be back soon. Any change? - He's delirious. He thought I was Buffy. - You too, huh? I hope she gets here soon. She'd better. Yeah. I feel so... I feel so guilty. Guilty? Well, things are so terrible and everything's coming apart, and I'm just... In some ways, this is the best night of my life. The best. I just checked on him just now. We were watching. Did you find Faith? You didn't... She's not here? How is he? He comes in and out. I think the pain is less now. Would you guys... I'd like to be alone with him. Of course. We'll try to find another cure. Thanks. Buffy. It's you? It's me. I didn't wanna go without seeing you. - Angel, I can cure you. - It's OK. - I'm ready. - Angel, listen to me. Sit up. You're gonna live. You have to live. - What way? - Drink. Drink me. - No. - It's the only way. - Get away. - It'll save you. - It'll kill you. - Maybe not. Not if you don't take it all. You can't ask me to do this. I won't let you die. I can't. Angel, the blood of a slayer is the only cure. Faith. I tried. I killed her. Then it's over. It is never over. I won't let you die. Drink. Please. Buffy? I need some help! She's lost a lot of blood. - What happened? - She needs blood. - Stay calm. - Something bit her. She needs a transfusion. - You found her? Was she conscious? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Sure. I need a type. Get her on two lines of Ringer's lactate and watch for hypovolemic shock. - What happened? - Something bit her. I don't know what. - OK. I need a rabies shot. Any allergies? - No. Just... Just help her. You two been doing drugs? You want her to live, you have to be straight with me. She's clean. All right. Wait outside. Let us work. A phone? Right out there. The bones are set and the damage to the kidneys is repairable. But the head trauma. It's... Well, it's simply too severe. You know, it's a wonder she's alive at all with the blood loss. I'm sorry, sir, but there's almost no chance that she's ever gonna regain consciousness. It's your day. We have another young girl with blood loss. Dr Powell wants you to assist on a cutdown. I'll be right there. Oh, my God. Sir, no! Somebody call Security! Don't do that. I will. I'll do that and worse. - Murderous fiend. See what she did to Faith? - Hadn't made plans to weep over that one. I'd get set for some weeping, if I were you. I'd get set for a world of pain. Misery loves company. I wanna share that with you and your whore. Well, looks like somebody's been eating his spinach. That's OK, folks. It's all right. The show is not over, but there will be a short intermission. Don't wanna miss the second act. All kinds of excitement. I'll be there. - How is she? - She's fine. - She's asleep. - You seem all right, too. Yeah. - What happened? - She was fine. Did Faith...? Faith's out of the picture. Buffy put her in a coma. And? Buffy cured me. Made me... You fed off her? Yes. - How much? - She's gonna be fine. She won't be a vampire? No. She didn't feed off me. It's good to know that when things look grim, you'll feed off the girl who loves you to save your own ass. You'd better go. We'll watch over her. - I don't want to... - The sun'll be up soon. - I'm gonna miss him when he leaves town. - Let's find out how Buffy's doing. Who's gonna look after him? It's a she. And aren't these things supposed to take care of themselves? A higher power guiding us? I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant. There's something I'm supposed to be doing. Oh, yeah. Miles to go. Little Miss Muffet counting down from 130. Great. Riddles. Sorry. It's my head. A lot of new stuff. They're never gonna fix this, are they? What about you? Scar tissue. It fades. It all fades. You want another deal? Human weakness. It never goes away. Even his. Is this your mind or mine? Beats me. Gettin' towards that time. - How are you gonna fit all this stuff? - Not gonna. - It's yours. - I can't use all of this. Just take what you need. You ready? Buffy. - Are you OK? - How do you feel? - Is Angel here? - He had to go. It got kinda sunny. - Get him. Get everyone. - What exactly is up? - Buffy, you sure you're all right? - I'm ready. Ready for what? War. That's the basic plan. So, am I crazy? - Well, crazy is such a strong word. - Let's not rule it out, though. - You don't think it can be done? - I didn't say that. I might, but not yet. I don't think it's possible to come up with a crazier plan. We attack the Mayor with hummus. - I stand corrected. - Just keeping things in perspective. Thank you. My point, however, is, crazy or not, it's pretty much the only plan. Besides, it's Buffy's. And she's slay gal. You know, Little Miss Likes To Fight. So... I think there was a yea vote buried in there somewhere. I'm gonna need every single one of you on board. Especially you, Xander. You're sort of the key figure here. Key? Me? OK, pride, humility. And here's the mind-numbing fear. What do I have to do? Remember any training from when you became soldier guy? - Rocket launcher? - Rocket launcher not gonna do it. It took a volcano to kill one of these things last time. Buffy... All this is rather dependent on your being able to control the Mayor. Faith told me to play on his human weakness. Faith told you? Was that before or after you put her in a coma? After. - His weakness? - Right. Which is? You know, I do all this planning, I'm in charge here even though I'm really not at my best... Well, let's... Let's think. Angel, you hung with him the most. Was there something he's afraid of? Well, he's not crazy about germs. Of course, that's it. We'll attack him with germs. Great. We'll corner him and sneeze on him. No. No, we'll get a container of Ebola virus and... Or it doesn't even have to be real. We can just get a box that says "Ebola" on it and chase him. - With the box. - I'm leaning towards the hummus offensive. - He'll never see it comin'. - Faith. - Faith? - At the hospital he was grieving. Seriously crazed, and not just in a homicidal, "I wanna be a demon" way. - She's his weak link. - Faith. - I can work that. - You haven't an enormous amount of time. Hey, it's Mr States The Obvious. The Council is not welcome here. I have no time for orders. If I need someone to scream like a woman, I'll call. I'm not here for the Council. Just tell me how I can help. That is so classy. Isn't he just so classy? It's a start. So there is something I can do... besides scream like a woman. There's plenty. There's chores for everyone. - OK, this is how... - ..it's gonna lay out. The transformation should begin at exactly 3:28. I'll just be finishing my speech. You know, it's too bad you fellas are gonna miss that cos it speaks to every one of us. Heck, I've been working on it for a hundred years. Better be good. They'll try to run, of course, and that's when I need you boys in flanking position. - But, sir, the sun. - Not a problem. "Darkness will follow. The day becomes night." - An eclipse. - Standard procedure for an ascension. - That puts me back in the game. - Yeah, it does. You and Xander are gonna have to work together now, OK? - I'm still key guy, right? - Right. Great. Then Angel, in his non-key-guy capacity, can work with me. - What fun. - Key guy still talking. Oh, good, start bickering. That's gonna work great for us. You guys are like little old ladies. You'll come up through the sewers here. The important thing is containment. I'll need to feed. It's crucial in the first few minutes to sustain the change. What does that mean? No snacking. I see blood on your lips, it's a visit to the woodshed for you boys. Kill. Don't feed. - How are we on volcano detail? - We can work it out. - Fun with Chemistry, - Xander said he can get the materials. - Who's gonna stoke it up? - You feel up to it? I suppose it should be I. Strangely fitting in a grotesque fashion. OK, guys, start reaching out. Giles, weapons, weapons, weapons. - What about you? - There's something I need to get. Remember: fast and brutal. It's gonna be a new world come nightfall. Don't wanna weaken now. And, boys, let's watch the swearing. - Harmony, I need to talk to you for a sec. - You mean in front of other people? - Are they serious? I'm gonna look stupid. - Percy. - Do I look stupid in this? Be honest. - You look great. You got a sec? - Cordelia. - Yes. - You know that when this is over... - Yes? Well, should we prevail, I'll be going back to England. I know. With Buffy no longer working for the Council, there's really no place for me here. I guess not. No... reason to stay. - No. - No. No... cause to hope that... - I might be needed. - Needed. - Or wanted. - Wanted. - Good luck in England. - Thank you. I'll drop you a line sometime. That'd be neat. Put these with the others. Don't touch anything. - What do we do then? - Nothing. Just relax. Have a good time. OK. OK, it's clear. Let's move. I guess that's it. Won't be long now. - You nervous? - Only in a terrified way. - We're gonna make it through this. - Are you sure? - I sound pretty sure, don't I? - Yeah. Then I must be sure. Is that just a comforting way of not answering the question? How long till graduation? A little while. - Did you get what you needed? - Yeah, I did. - This isn't gonna be enough. - Giles is on it. How are you? I heal fast. Like you. - So, are we sure everyone's good... - I'm not gonna say goodbye. When we get through this, I'm just gonna go. You can understand? There's just too much to... Congratulations to the class of 1999. You all proved more or less adequate. This is a time of celebration, so sit still and be quiet. Spit out that gum. Please welcome our distinguished guest speaker, Richard Wilkins III. I saw that gesture. You see me after graduation. Am I late? Shall we fight? Well! What a day this is. Special day. Today is our centennial. The 100th anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale. And I know what that means to all you kids. Not a darn thing. Cos today something much more important happens. Today you all graduate from high school. Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over. What's 100 years of history compared to that? My God. He's gonna do the entire speech. Man, just ascend already. Evil. ..whether you like it or not. It's been a long road getting here for you, for Sunnydale. There's been achievement, joy, good times. And there's been grief. There's been loss. Some people who should be here today aren't. But we are. Journey's end. And what is a journey? Is it just distance travelled? Time spent? No. It's what happens on the way. It's the things that shape you. At the end of the journey you're not the same. Today is about change. Graduation doesn't just mean your circumstances change. It means you do. You ascend, to a higher level. Nothing will ever be the same. Nothing. And so, as we look back on... on the events that have brought us to this day... Come on. ..we... we must all... It has begun. My destiny. It's a little sooner than I expected. I had this whole section on civic pride. But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish. Now! Flame units! First wave! Fire! Go! Go! Go! This is simply unacceptable. - Xander? - Bowmen! Fire! - Fall back! - Fire! This is not orderly. This is not disciplined. You're on my campus, buddy. When I say I want quiet, I mean... Fall back! Get back! - Go. - Good luck. - Xander, take him down! - Everyone, hand-to-hand! Go! Go! Go! Move! Move! Get the kids! Right flank, close in! Close! Justin, Doug, you guys are the right flank. Get some help here. You remember this? I took it from Faith. Stuck it in her gut. Just slid in her like she was butter. You wanna get it back from me, Dick? Well, gosh. If I could just get something for the pain? It's rather a lot of pain, actually. Aspirin, anyone? Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious. - Got off pretty cheap considering. - It seems like we did. He made it through the fight. I guess maybe he... he took off after. - You all right? - I'm tired. I should imagine so. It's quite a couple of days. I haven't processed everything yet. My brain isn't really functioning on the higher levels. It's pretty much fire: bad, tree: pretty. Understandable. Well, when it's working again, congratulate it on a good campaign. - You did very well. - Thank you. I will. I ferreted this out of the wreckage. It may not interest you, but... I'd say you earned it. There's a certain dramatic irony attached to all this. A synchronicity that borders on predestination, one might say. Fire: bad, tree: pretty. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I'll go and attend to Wesley. See if he's still... whimpering. Well, that was the most fun you can have without having any fun. What about the part where we kicked some demon ass? I didn't hate that. Hear, hear. You guys wanna take off? I think we've pretty much done everything we can. I'm for it. Are you OK? Yeah. I'm OK. - I could use a little sleep, though. - Yeah. If someone could just wake me when it's time to go to college, that'd be great. Guys, take a moment to deal with this. We survived. It was a hell of a battle. Not the battle. High school. We're taking a moment.
