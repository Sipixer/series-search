- That must be Angel. - Who warned her about all the vampires? The brethren of his order would bring the Anointed to the Master. Who's that? The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer. Welcome, my friend. In every generation, there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer. Zachary didn't return from the hunt last night. The Slayer. Zachary was strong and he was careful. But still the Slayer takes him, as she has taken so many of my family. It wears thin. - Collin, what would you do about it? - I'd annihilate her. - Out of the mouths of babes... - Let me do it, Master. - Let me kill her for you. - You have a personal interest in this. - I don't get to have any fun. - I will send the Three. The Three? Let's go. Get it. Come on, get it right there. I got it. Free drink, please. The Fumigation Party. It's an annual tradition. The closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches. It's a lot of fun. What's it like where you are? I'm sorry. I was just... thinking about things. - So, we're talking about a guy? - Not exactly a guy. For us to have a conversation about a guy, there'd have to be a guy to talk about. - Is that a sentence? - You lack a guy. I do. Which is fine with me most of the time, but... What about Angel? Angel? Could just see him in a relationship. "Hi, honey, you're in grave danger. I'll see ya next month." He's not around much, it's true. When he is around, it's like the lights dim everywhere else. You know? Oh, yeah. Hey, Annie! Dino! Just leaving. Please get your extreme oafishness off my $200 shoes. - I was just... - Leaving, before Annie's boyfriend - squashes you like a bug? - So you noticed. Thanks for understanding. I don't know what everyone's saying. That outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker. Boy, Cordelia's a regular breath of vile air. What are you vixens up to? Just sitting here watching our barren lives pass us by. Look. A cockroach. Let's stop this crazy whirligig of fun. I'm dizzy. Now I'm infecting those nearest and dear to me. I'm gonna call it a night. - Don't go. - Yeah, it's early. We could... dance. Rain check? Good night. Want a free drink? It's late, I'm tired and I don't wanna play games. Show yourself. OK. Nice. OK. Look, I really don't wanna fight all three of you unless I have to. Good dogs don't... bite. Look out! Run! Get in! Come on! No! It's all right. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited. I've never put it to the test. I'll go get some bandages. Take yourjacket and your shirt off. Nice tattoo. Lucky you came along. How did you happen to come along? I live nearby. I was just out walking. So, you weren't following me? - I just had this feeling you were. - Why would I do that? You tell me. You're the mystery guy that appears out of nowhere. I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight, but... if you are hanging around, I'd like to know why. - Maybe I like you. - Maybe? - Honey, what are you doing? - There's a lot of weird people out at night. I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. You must be beat. - I am. It's a little gallery, but you've no idea... - Then go to bed. - I can bring you some hot tea. - That's sweet. What'd you do? Can't a daughterjust be concerned about her mother? - Hi. - Hi. OK. Angel, this is my mom. Mom, this is Angel. - We ran into each other on the way home. - Nice to meet you. - What do you do, Angel? - He's a student. First year at community college. He's helping with my history. - You know I've been toiling there. - It's a little late for tutoring. I'm gonna go to bed. And Buffy? I'll say good night and do the same. It was nice to meet you. Good night. We'll hook up soon and do that study thing. - I don't wanna get you in any more trouble. - And I don't wanna get you dead. They could still be out there. So... Two of us. One bed. That doesn't work. Why don't you take the bed? You're wounded. - I'll take the floor. - No... - Believe me, I've had worse. - OK. Why don't you see if the Fang Gang is still loitering and keep your back turned while I change? I don't see them. You know, I'm the Chosen One. It's my job to fight guys like that. - What's your excuse? - Somebody has to. Well, what does your family think of your career choice? They're dead. Was it vampires? It was. - I'm sorry. - It was a long while ago. So, this is a vengeance gig for you? You even look pretty when you go to sleep. Well, when I wake up, it's an entirely different story. Here. Sleep tight. Angel? Do you snore? I don't know. It's been a long time since anybody's been in a position to let me know. He spent the night? In your room? In your bed? - Not in my bed. By my bed. - That is so romantic. Did you... I mean did he...? Perfect gentleman. Wake up and smell the seduction. It's the oldest trick in the book. What? Saving my life? Getting slashed in the ribs? Duh! Guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I once drank a gallon of Gatorade without taking a breath. It was pretty impressive. Although later there was an ick factor. Can we steer this riveting conversation back to what happened earlier in the evening? You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires. - Did they look like this? - Yeah. What's with the uniforms? It seems you encountered the Three. - Warrior vampires. Very proud and strong. - How is it you always know this stuff? You always know what's going on. I never know. - You weren't here until six researching it. - No. I was sleeping. Obviously you're hurting the Master very much. He wouldn't send the Three forjust anyone. We must step up our training with weapons. Stay at my house until these samurai guys are history. What? Don't worry about Angel. We'll tell him to get out of town fast. You're not in immediate jeopardy. The Master will send someone else, but, in the meantime, the Three having failed will offer their own lives in penance. We failed in our duty, and now our lives belong to you. Pay attention, child. You are the Anointed and there is much you must learn. With power comes responsibility. True, they did fail. But also true, we who walk at night share a common bond. The taking of a life - I'm not talking about humans, of course - is a serious matter. So, you would spare them? I am weary, and their deaths will bring me little joy. Of course sometimes a little is enough. Cool. Crossbow. Check out these babies. Goodbye, stakes. Hello, flying fatality. - What can I shoot? - Nothing. The crossbow comes later. You must first become proficient with the basic tools of combat. Now, let's begin with the quarterstaff, which incidentally will require countless hours of vigorous training. - I speak from experience. - Giles, 20th century? - I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck. - You never know who you will be fighting. These traditions have been handed down through the ages. You show me good, steady progress with the quarterstaff and in due course we'll discuss the crossbow. Put on your pads. I'm not gonna need pads to fight you. We'll see about that. En garde! Good. Let's move on to the crossbow. Angel? I brought you some dinner. It's a little plateless. Sorry. So. What did you do all day? I read a little. And just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I... My diary? You read my diary? That is not OK. A diary is like a person's most private place. You don't know what I was writing about. Hunk can mean a lot of things. Bad things. And when I said your eyes are penetrating, I meant... bulgy. Buffy... A doesn't stand for Angel. It stands for Achmed, a foreign exchange student. That fantasy part has nothing to do with you. Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up. I watched her. I didn't read it. I swear. I did a lot of thinking today. I really can't be around you. - Because when I am... - Hey, no big. Water... over the bridge. ..all I can think about is how badly I wanna kiss you. Kiss me? I'm older than you, and this can't ever... I better go. How much older? - I should... - Go, you said... What? What's wrong? Buffy, what happened? Nothing. I saw a shadow. - Angel's a vampire? - I can't believe this is happening. One minute we were kissing and the next minute... - Can a vampire ever be a good person? - A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, memories, even personality of who it took over, but it's still a demon at the core. There is no halfway. So that'd be a no? Then what was he doing? Why was he good to me? Was it all some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense. All right, you have a problem and it's not a small one. Let's take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively. Angel's a vampire. You're a slayer. I think it's obvious what you have to do. - It is a slayer's duty. - I know you have feelings for this guy. But you're not in love with him, right? In love with a vampire? Are you out of your mind? What? Not vampire. How could you love an umpire? Everyone hates 'em. Where did you get that dress? This is a one-of-a-kind Todd Oldham. Do you know how much this dress cost? Is this a knockoff? It's a cheesy knockoff. This is what happens when you sign free trade agreements. We think we have problems. - Who's here? - A friend. Hi. It's been a while. - A lifetime. - Or two, but who's counting? What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look? Last time I saw you, it was kimonos. And last time I saw you, it wasn't high-school girls. Don't you like? Remember Budapest? Turn of the century? - You were a bad boy during that earthquake. - You did some damage yourself. Is there anything better than a natural disaster? The panic. The people lost in the streets. It's like picking fruit off the vine. Nice. You're living above ground. Like one of them. You and your new friend are attacking us. Like one of them. But guess what, precious? You're not one of them. - Are you? - No. But I'm not exactly one of you, either. Is that what you tell yourself these days? You're not exactly living off quiche. You and I both know what you hunger for, what you need. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's who we are. It's what makes eternal life worth living. You can only suppress your real nature for so long. I can feel it brewing inside of you. I hope I'm around when it explodes. - Maybe you don't wanna be. - I'm not afraid of you. I bet she is, though. Or maybe I'm underestimating her. Talk to her. Tell her about the curse. Maybe she'll come around. And if she still doesn't trust you, you know where I'll be. Here's something at last. - Can you please warn us before you do that? - There's nothing about Angel, but it's been ages since I've read the diaries of any of the watchers before me. How embarrassing when you thought he had read your diary, but he hadn't, but then he felt the same way... - I'm listening. - There's mention some 200 years ago in Ireland of Angelus, the one with the angelic face. They got that right. I'm not saying anything. I have nothing to say. Does this Angel have a tattoo behind his right shoulder? Yeah. It's a bird or something. Now I'm saying something. You saw him naked? - Angel's been around for a while. - Not long for a vampire. 240 years or so. 240. Well, he said he was older. Angelus leaves Ireland, wreaks havoc in Europe for several decades and then about 80 years ago the most curious thing happens. He comes to America, shuns other vampires and lives alone. There's no... no record of him hunting here. So he is a good vampire. I mean, on a scale of one to ten. Ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night and one being someone who's... not. I say that there's no record. But vampires hunt and kill. It's what they do. - Fish swim. Birds fly. - He could've fed on me. He didn't. Question: 100 years or so before he came to our shores. What was he like then? Like all of them. A vicious, violent animal. Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three. How can my children learn if I do everything for them? - You've gotta let me take care of the Slayer. - You're giving me orders now. OK. We'll just do nothing while she takes us out one by one. Do I sense a plan, Darla? Share. - Angel kills her and comes back to the fold. - Angel. He was the most vicious creature I ever met. - I miss him. - So do I. - Why would he kill her if he feels for her? - To keep her from killing him. You see? How we all work together for the common good? That's how a family is supposed to function. OK, so let's review. Reconstruction began when? Buffy? Reconstruction. Reconstruction began after the... construction, which was shoddy, so they had to reconstruct. After the destruction of the Civil War. Right. Civil War. During which Angel was already 100 and change. Are we gonna talk about boys or are we gonna help you pass history? Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander's gonna grab me and kiss me right on the lips. If you want Xander, speak up, girl. No. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and sweaty palms. OK, so here's something I gotta know. When Angel kissed you... I mean, before he turned into... How was it? Unbelievable. And it is kinda novel how he'll stay young and handsome for ever. Although you'll still get wrinkly and die and... What about the children? - I'll be quiet now. - No, it's OK. I need to hear this. I need to get over him, so I can... So that you can... Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer and he's a... vampire. God, I can't. He's never done anything to hurt me. OK, I need to stop thinking about this. OK, give it another half an hour and maybe something will sink in. Then I'm going home for some major moping. OK. The era of the Congressional Reconstruction, usually called Radical... - Hello? - Hi, I'm Darla. - A friend of Buffy's. - Nice to meet you. She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a study date? No, I thought she was studying with Willow. She is. Willow's the Civil War expert. I was supposed to help her with the War of Independence. My family kinda goes back to those days. She'll be home soon. Would you like to come in and wait? It's very nice of you to invite me into your home. You're welcome. I've been wrestling with the IRS all night. - Would you like something to eat? - Yes. I would. Let's see what we have. Do you feel like something little or something big? Something big. - Let her go. - I just had a little. There's plenty more. Aren't you hungry for something warm after all this time? Come on, Angel. Just say yes. Welcome home. Hey. I'm home. You're not welcome here. You come near us and I'll kill you. Mom? Mom, can you hear me? Yes. I need an ambulance. 1630 Robello Drive. My mother cut herself. She lost a lot of blood. Please, please hurry. - Mom? - Buffy. - My God. - What happened? Angel. - Do you remember anything, Mom? - Just... Your friend came over. - I was gonna make a snack. - My friend? I guess I slipped and cut my neck on... The doctor said it looked like a barbecue fork. We don't have a barbecue fork. Are you another doctor? No. Mom, this is Mr Giles. The librarian from your school. What's he doing here? I just came to pay my respects. Wish you a speedy recovery. Boy, the teachers really do care in this town. Get some rest now. She's gonna be OK. They gave her some iron. Her blood count was a little... A little low. It presents itself like mild anaemia. You were lucky you got to her as soon as you did. Lucky? Stupid. - Buff, it's not your fault. - No? I invited him into my home. Even after I knew who and what he was. And I didn't do anything about it. Because I had feelings for him. Because I cared about him. If you care about somebody, you care about them. You can't change that by... Killing them? Maybe not. But I think it's a start. - We'll keep an eye on your mom. - Buffy. You can't stop me. The Three found me near the Bronze. So did he. He lives nearby. This is no ordinary vampire. If there is such a thing. Now, he knows you. He's faced the Three. I think this is gonna take more than a stake. So do I. She's out hunting you right now. She wants to kill you. - Leave me alone. - What did you think? Did you think she would understand? That she would look at your face, your true face, and give you a kiss? For 100 years you've not had a moment's peace because you will not accept who you are. That's all you have to do. Accept it. Don't let her hunt you down. Don't whimper and mewl like a mangy human. Kill. Feed. Live. All right. - What do you want? - I want it finished. That's good. You're hurting me. That's good, too. She talks about you all the time. It's important teachers make an impression. She makes quite an impression herself. I know she's having trouble with history. Is it too difficult for her, or is she not applying herself? She lives very much in the now. History, of course, is very much about then. But there's no reason... She's studying with Willow. She's studying with Darla. She is trying. Darla? I don't believe I know... Her friend who came over tonight. Darla came tonight. She's the friend you mentioned earlier? I must have frightened her half to death when I fainted. - Someone should make sure she's all right. - Yes, someone should. Right away. I'll do it. That school is amazing. We have a problem. I know you're there. And I know what you are. - Do you? I'm just an animal, right? - You're not an animal. Animals I like. Let's get it done. Come on. Don't go soft on me now. - A little wide. - Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it ajoke? To make me feel for you and then... I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before. It feels good, doesn't it? It feels simple. I invited you into my home and you attacked my family. Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends. And their friends' children. For 100 years, I offered an ugly death to everyone I met. And I did it with a song in my heart. - What changed? - I fed on a girl about your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post, but a favourite among her clan. - Her clan? - The Romany. Gypsies. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul. They were out of boils and blinding torment? When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body but not your soul. That's gone. No conscience, no remorse. It's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done, and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day. So, you started with my mom? - I didn't bite her. - Why didn't you say something? But I wanted to. I can walk like a man, but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight. Go ahead. Not as easy as it looks. Sure it is. - We're near the Bronze. What now? - Keep looking for her. I have a question. What if she's fighting Angel and his friends? What the heck are we gonna do about it? Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is? - Bad hair on top of that outfit? - To love someone who used to love you. You guys were involved? For several generations. You've been around since Columbus. You are bound to pile up a few ex's. You're older than him, right? You are looking a little worn around the eyes. I made him. There was a time when we shared everything. Wasn't there, Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for 1,000 years. But you threw that away because of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick. And you'll always be sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die. - You don't think I came alone, do you? - I know I didn't. Scary. Scarier. Don't worry. Bullets can't kill vampires. It can hurt them like hell, but... Did you just hear...? So many body parts. So few bullets. Let's begin with the kneecaps. No fun dancing without them. Close, but no heart. We need to distract her. Fast. Buffy, Angel didn't attack your mom. It was Darla. Come on, Buffy. Take it like a man. Angel? Forget her. How dare you. She was my favourite. For 400 years. She was weak. We don't need her. I'll bring you the Slayer. But to lose her to Angel. He was to have sat at my right hand come the day. - And now... - They're all against you. But soon you shall rise, and when you do, we'll kill them all. The Post-Fumigation Party. How's it different to the Pre-Fumigation Party? Much hardier cockroaches. So, no word from Angel? I swear, though, in his way I feel like he's still watching me. Well, in a way he sort of is. In the way of that he's right over there. I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened. I'm just gonna look this way. I just wanted to see if you were OK and your mother. We're both good. You? If I can go a while without getting shot or stabbed, I'll be all right. - Look, this can't... - Ever be anything. I know. For one thing, you're 224 years older than I am. I just gotta... I gotta walk away from this. I know. Me, too. One of us has to go here. I know. - What's going on? - Nothing. Well, as long as they're not kissing. You OK? - It's just... - Painful. I know.
