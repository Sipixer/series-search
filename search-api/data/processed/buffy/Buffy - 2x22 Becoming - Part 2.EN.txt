- Xander! - Get her out of here! Wait. Just see if he's OK! Plea... - You don't understand. - Keep your mouth shut, missy. - But I didn't do anything. - Why is that hard to believe? - In there! You know this girl? - Buffy Summers. - If there's trouble, she's behind it. - You stupid little troll. You have no idea. - Attitude problems. Serious. - I just wanna know if my friends are OK. All right, that's enough. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can... Stop! Get down! We have a fugitive on foot at the high school. Homicide suspect. Female. Blonde. Approximately 16 years old. Suspect is very dangerous. Xander! Oh! I was worried. I didn't know if you were OK. The cops... Yeah... I heard 'em chase you out. I was just comin' out of it. - Souvenir. - What about the others? Are they OK? OK. That was about equal parts protecting me and copping a feel, right? What is it? The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up any time, but, um... ..the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is. I never should have let her try to do that curse. Angel must have known. - Where are her parents? - With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're... they're getting on a plane back. Does Oz know? Oh, man...! I didn't even think. I'll... I'll call him. Hey. - How is she? The doctor told me that... - Yeah. We're, uh, still waiting. - Are you OK? - I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realised nobody was chasing me. - Not too brave. - It was the right thing to do. - Did Giles keep up with you? - I didn't see Giles. - You mean he's not in the hospital? - No. Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. - You had me worried. - What do you want? I wanna torture you. I used to love it and it's been a long time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even have chain saws. Oh, yeah. Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you are. I performed the ritual, said all the right phrases... Blood on my hand. Got nothing - big doughnut hole for my troubles. I figure you know the ritual. You're up on these things. You could probably... ..tell me what I'm doing wrong. But honestly, I sort of hope you don't. Cos I really wanna torture you. No, it's impossible. There's been some terrible mistake. You have no idea where your daughter is? She was going to her friend Willow's house. Maybe she slept over. - Is that Willow Rosenberg? - Yes. - Second victim. - What? Your daughter has a history of violence, doesn't she, Ms Summers? Well... You call us, OK? If she decides to stop by. Be best she just comes in. Giles? Giles? I don't think he's here. - Who are you? - Whistler. - What are you doing here? - Waitin' for you. - Why? - Cos I... I need a date to the prom. I have had a really bad day, OK? If you have information, I am grateful. Crack jokes, I'll wear your ribcage as a hat. Hello to the imagery! Very nice. It wasn't supposed to go down like this. Nobody saw you coming. I figured this for Angel's big day. But I thought he was here to stop Acathla. Not to bring him forth. Then you two made with the smoochies, and now he's a creep again. And what are you gonna do? - Or what are you prepared to do? - Whatever I have to. Maybe I should ask what are you prepared to give up? You have nothing useful to tell me. What are you? A demon sent to even the score between good and evil? Wow! Good guess. Why not get off your immortal ass and fight evil? I'm sick and tired of doing it myself. In the end you're always by yourself. You're all you've got. That's the point. - Spare me. - The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. You gotta know how to use it! Hold it right there! Put your hands on your head. Do it! Hello, cutie. Ugh! Will you hold on a second?! Hey! White flag here. I quit. Let me clear this up. We're mortal enemies - no time-outs. You wanna go a round, I'll have a gay old time. If you want to stop Angel,... - ..we'll have to play this a bit differently. - What do you mean? I'm talking about your ex, pet. I'm talking about putting him in the bloody ground. This has gotta be the lamest trick you guys have ever thought up! He's got your watcher. - Right now, he's probably torturing him. - What do you want? I told you. I want to stop Angel. - I want to save the world. - You do remember that you're a vampire? We like to talk big, vampires do. "I'm going to destroy the world." It's just tough-guy talk. Struttin' around with your friends over a pint of blood. The truth is, I like this world. You've got dog racing, Manchester United,... ..and you've got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then, someone comes along with the vision. With a real... passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye Piccadilly, farewell Leicester bloody Square. You know what I'm saying? OK, fine. You're not down with Angel. Why would you ever come to me? I want Dru back. I want it like it was before he came back. - The way she acts around him. - You're pathetic. - I lost a friend tonight. I may lose more. - I wasn't in on that raiding party. Earth may be sucked into Hell, and you want help cos your girlfriend's a big ho? - Let me take this opportunity to not care. - I can't fight them both alone. Nor can you. - I hate you. - And I'm all you've got. All right. Talk. - I just need to kill this guy. - Ahem! - Oh, right. - Let's get inside. - Do you want some coffee? - I don't wanna leave. She might, uh... - I'll get it. - Thanks. Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up. I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know? And who am I gonna call every night... ..and talk about everything we did all day? You're my best friend. You've always... I love you. Willow? Oz? Oz? I'm here. She's just starting to wake up. - Hey, baby. - Hi. I'm gonna go get a doctor. How're you feelin'? My head... feels big. Is it big? No, it's head-sized. Is everybody else OK? Rupert, buddy,... ..I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed. How you holdin' up? Never... better! Glad to hear it. Now,... ..tell me when it hurts. Buffy? Where have you been? Are you OK? The police were here. I've been looking for you. - Let's go inside. I can explain. - Who is this man? Who are you? - Are you OK? - Mom. I'm OK. Terrible things have happened. What were you doing? - Your mom doesn't know? - Know what? That I'm, uh... in a band. A rock band, with Spike here. - Right. She plays the... triangle. - Drums. Drums, yeah. She's hell on the old skins. - Mm. And, uh, what do you do? - Well, I sing. You know what? Why don't we go inside, and we can talk about this? I'm not sure how I feel about this. - One of Angel's boys. - Yeah, probably watching me. Or you. - He won't get a chance to tattle on us now. - Buffy,... ..what is going on? Mom,... ..I'm a vampire slayer. I'm OK, Buffy. Really. I mean, I don't feel good, but... ..I'm awake and I know my name and who's president and how many fingers. So, they don't think my brain got mushed at all. - Thank God. I'm so sorry I can't be there. - I know, I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel. Don't be. It just wasn't meant to be. I know I'm never gonna get him back the way he was. It just makes it easier. I guess. Any luck finding Giles? Yep. I got a lucky break. - What? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Xander? Angel and the others are holed up outside town. Remember that funky-looking mansion? On Crawford Street, sure. That makes sense. What's the drill? - I'm gonna hit it come daybreak. - Need backup? No. You stay there. I'm covered. Do you, um... - Do you think Giles is still alive? - I think he is. I just wish he was here to tell me what to do. Have we met? Er... You hit me with an axe one time. Remember, er, "Get the hell away from my daughter"? So, do you live here in town? - Is Willow all right? - Yeah, she's fine. - All right, talk. What's the deal? - Simple. You let me and Dru skip town, I help you kill Angel. - Angel, your boyfriend? - Forget Drusilla. She doesn't walk. - There's no deal without Dru. - She killed Kendra. Dru bagged a slayer?! She didn't tell me! Hey, good for her. - Though not from your perspective. - I can't believe I invited you into my house. - So, you didn't kill that girl? - Of course not. - Did she explode like that man out there? - She was a slayer, Mom. Like what you are? Look... this deal works only one way. Full stop. Me and Dru, for Angel. - Are you sure you're a vampire slayer? - I'll take her out of the county. You'll never hear from us again, I bloody well hope. Fine. Get back to the mansion, make sure Giles is all right. - I mean, have you tried not being a slayer? - Mom! Be ready to back me up when I make my move. If Giles dies,... ..she dies. It's because you didn't have a strong father figure. It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it. - We should call the police. - No! - Now we know you're innocent... - You thought I was guilty? - Jeez, feelin' the love in this room(!) - No, I didn't think that. It's just... - ..now we have proof. - We have my word, Mom, not proof. - Look, I am sure that they will understand. - Get them involved, you'll get them killed. - You're not gonna hurt them, are you? - I'm a slayer, not a postal worker. Cops can't fight demons. I have to do it. - Do what? Buffy, what is happening? - Just have another drink. Don't you talk to me that way! You don't dump this on me and pretend it's nothing! - I'm sorry, I don't have time for this. - No, I am tired of "I don't have time" or... .."You wouldn't understand". I am your mother. You make time to explain yourself. - I told you. I'm a vampire slayer. - Well, I just don't accept that! Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences... How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing? - Well, it stops now! - No, it doesn't stop! It never stops! Do... do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs watching TV, or gossipping about boys, or... ..God, even studying! But I have to save the world. Again! - No, this is insane. Buffy, you need help. - I'm not crazy! - What I need is for you to chill. I have to go. - No. I am not letting you out of this house. - You can't stop me. - Oh yes, I... You walk out of this house, don't even think about coming back! Buffy's going for the big showdown. I wish we could help. You know, without dying. - I don't see how. - I wanna try again. - Try what? - The curse. We never got to finish it. - Maybe we can restore Angel's soul. - I don't like it. It's messing with powerful magic. You're weak. - I'm OK. - You don't look OK. Does she? You should listen to him. The hair, it's so flat. And the lips... - Could we stay on topic here, honey? - What? - It's not a good idea. - There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face? You've seen it before - you know what it means. This can help Buffy. If we turn Angel back soon enough,... ..we can stop him from ever awakening Acathla. OK. I missed out on some stuff, didn't I? Because... ..this is all making the kind of sense that's... not. Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll fill you in. Sure. I'll drive. Xander, go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can stall. - But I... - Resolve face. Be careful. You know, I can stop the pain. You've been very brave... but it's over. You've given enough. Now let me make it stop. Please. Just tell me what I need to know. In order to... ..to be worthy,... ..you must perform the ritual... ..in a tutu. Pillock! - Someone get the chain saw. - Now, now, don't let's lose our temper. Keep out of it, Sit 'n' Spin. Look, you cut him up, you'll never get your answers. - Since when did you become level-headed? - About the time you became pig-headed. Hurt him, you'll never destroy the world. I don't fancy spending the next month getting librarian out of the carpet. - There are other ways. - Enlighten me. Drusilla? Sweetheart? Do you want to play a game? You do know this is a crime scene, don't you? But then, you're a criminal, so that pretty much works out. You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out. In case you haven't noticed, the police of Sunnydale are deeply stupid. It doesn't matter anyway. Whatever they find,... ..you've proved too much of a liability for this school. These are the moments you savour. You wish time would stop, so that you could live them over and over again. You're expelled. You never got a single date in high school, did you? Your point being? It's Snyder. Tell the mayor I have good news. Is that better? Poor thing. Let's see what's inside. Of course. Look at me. Be... in me. Mmm... See with your heart. Jenny...! I thought I'd lost you. I'll never leave you. - We have to get out of here. - No, no, no, no, no. Slowly. It can't be you. Did you tell Angel? About the ritual? No. We have to get... him away from Acathla. - Why? Is he close to figuring it out? - Later. Tell me what to do. It's all right. We'll be together. Finally. We'll have everything we never got to have. Never got to feel. Just tell me what to do. We have to get Angel away from Acathla. Angel himself? - He's the key? - His... his blood. He... he mustn't... Blood. Of course. The blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open up the door. My blood. My life. - OK, kill him. - But what if he's lying? Yeah. Good point. All right, don't kill him. You know, I kinda like having you watch my back. It's kinda like old times. Er, Drusilla? - Honey? - We are finished here, ducks. Sorry. I was in the moment. Whistler. What did you mean, "The sword isn't enough?" Raidin' an Englishman's fridge is like dating a nun. - You're never gonna get the good stuff. - Tell me how to use it. Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it. One blow will send 'em both back to Hell. But I strongly suggest that you get there before that happens. - The faster you kill Angel, the easier for you. - Don't worry about me. - It's all on the line here, kid. - I can deal. I got nothin' left to lose. Wrong, kid. You got one more thing. - Xander? - The cavalry's here. The cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock, but it's here. - That's better. - You're not here to fight. Get Giles out and run like hell. Understood? I can't protect you. I'm gonna be killing. - You know, that's a new look for you. - It's a present for Angel. Willow, uh... she told me to tell you... Tell me what? Kick his ass. Acathla, mundatus sum, Pro te necavi, Sanguinem meum pro te effundam.... ..quo me dignum... ..esse demonstram, - Are we ready? - Stinky herbs are go! Did I mention I didn't take Latin? You don't have to understand it. You just say it. - I hope. - Right. Now, Acathla,... ..you will be free. And so will we all. - Hello, lover. - I don't have time for you, - You don't have a lot of time left. - Coming on kinda strong, aren't ya? You're playing some deep odds. Do you think you can take us all on? No. I don't. Painful, isn't it? I don't wanna hurt you, baby. That doesn't mean I won't. Quod perditum est... ..invenietur, Not dead, nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum, I call. Giles! Giles?! Xander? - Can you walk? - You're not real. - Sure I'm real. - It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I want. Then why would they make you see me? Oh, right. Let's go. Come on... Come on. Ooh! Here he comes. Gods, bind him, cast his heart... ..from the... evil... realm. - You almost made it, Buff. - It's not over yet. My boy, Acathla here, is about to wake up. You're going to Hell. Save me a seat. In return,... ..I call on... - Willow? - Are you OK? Is this a good thing? Hey... speak English! Sorry, baby. I wish there was another way. God, he's gonna kill her. That's everything, huh? No weapons,... ..no friends... no hope. Take all that away... and what's left? Me. Buffy? What's going on? Where are we? I... I don't remember. Angel? You're hurt. Oh, Buffy! God... I feel like I haven't seen you in months. Oh, God, everything's so muddled, I... Oh, Buffy. - What's happenin'? Don't worry about it. - I love you. - I love you. Close your eyes. Buffy? # The winter here's cold # And bitter # It's chilled us to the bone # We haven't seen the sun for weeks # Too long, too far from home # I feel just like I'm sinking - Buffy? - # And I claw for solid ground # I'm pulled down by the undertow # I never thought I could feel so low # Oh darkness, I feel like letting go # Hall of the strength and all of the courage # Come and lift me from this place Willow, are you sure you should be out of bed? - Look who's talking. - Yes. - Any word? - You guys haven't seen her, either? - No. - But the world didn't end, cos... check it out. Well, we, er... we went back to the mansion. It... it was empty. Erm... and Acathla was... was dormant. I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me. Plus, the orb did that cool glow thing. Maybe it wasn't in time. Maybe she had to kill him before the cure worked. Then she'd wanna be alone. Or maybe Angel was saved and they want to be alone together. - Perhaps. - Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later. - We still have school. - Yeah. She'll be here in a while. # Everything we say and do # Hurts us all the more # It's just that we stayed # Too long # In the same old sickly skin # I'm pulled down by the undertow # I never thought I could feel so low # Oh darkness, I feel like letting go # Hall of the strength and all of the courage # Come and lift me from this place # I know I could love you much better than this
