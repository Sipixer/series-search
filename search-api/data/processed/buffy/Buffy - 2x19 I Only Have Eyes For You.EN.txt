# It # The language is an annoying necessity # And I depend on all the regular things # Got a list tattooed on my memory # Of how our tryst should unfold Hey. I'm Ben. We had Algebra II together last year? I'm sorry, I pretty much repress anything math-related. Miss Jackson? Second period? You sat in the seat three over and one behind. Oh! I remember now. It's the one with the desks, chalkboards and pencils, right? - That's the one. - Like a steel trap. So, I was wonderin', you know the dance tomorrow night? - Are you goin'? - The Sadie Hawkins thing? - The deal where the girls ask the boys? - Yeah. And I thought maybe, you know, if you're free, you might ask me. Oh, gosh... - I... - Don't worry... No, you seem like a really great guy. It's... me, I... I'm not seeing anybody. - Ever again, actually. - Oh. That's... that's too bad. OK, well, I better... Sorry. # I'm falling from the opposite # What good is it? # Fight the map with no key attached # My heart's enlarged and I charge Hey. You're bailin'? Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to patrol, and then sack it. You've been doing that a lot - patrolling and sacking. In fact, you've kind of been "All work and no play Buffy". I play. I have big fun. I came here tonight, didn't I? You came, you saw, you... rejected. You mean that guy? I'm just not in date mode right now. - Maybe you need to date to get in date mode. - I don't think I'm ready for that, Will. You're thinking too much. Maybe you need to be impulsive. Impulsive? Remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him, he lost his soul,... ..now he's gone for ever and the demon with his face kills my friends. My next impulsive decision will be my choice of dentures. OK, the Angel thing went badly - I'm on board with that - but that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice. Come back here! We're not finished! - You don't care any more, is that it? - It doesn't matter what I feel! Then tell me you don't love me. Say it! Will that help? Is that what you need to hear? I don't. I don't! Now let me go. No! A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody. Love is for ever. I'm not afraid to use it. I swear! - If I can't be with you... - Hey! Oh, my God! Don't walk away from me, bitch! - What happened? - What happened?! You just went OJ on your girlfriend. This is nuts. I-I... I don't know why I got so mad. - Because you're a jerk? - He's not. - We weren't fighting a few minutes ago. - We weren't. I swear to God. Then why'd you have a gun? I don't... I don't know. I don't even know where I got it. I don't see any gun. I'm sure you know why I asked you here. - To thank me? - That's right, I wanna thank you. What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem and disorder? I don't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend. Ask him. Ask the janitor. People can be coerced, Summers. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK, I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of the puzzle. I'm gonna look at the pieces carefully and rationally,... ..and I'm gonna keep looking until I know exactly how this is all your fault. Mr Snyder, Crandle's chained himself to the snack machine, Pathetic little no-life vegan. Not so fast, missy. I'm not done with you yet. You stink of lies. So, for next time read the chapters on information grouping and binary coding. I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool. If you find multi-stacked conversions and primary-number clusters a big hoot! Giles! I made them laugh. Did you hear? - I did the joke thing! - Yes, yes, so it seems. I mean, erm... er... you did indeed. Good... good show. I just stopped by to... to see if you needed any assistance,... ..but you seem to have things quite under control. Well, I had... good lesson plans. Ms Calendar had them on her computer. Yes, yes, she was very, erm... dedicated. And I found a bunch of files and Internet sites on paganism and magic and stuff. - Oh? - Yes. It's really interesting. And, uh... I found this in her drawer. She told me it was a rose quartz. And it has healing powers. I thought she'd want you to have it. Oh, thank you, Willow, that's erm... ..that's very thoughtful of you. Before 1935, the New Deal focused on revitalising stricken business... ..and agricultural communities. It also tried to regulate the nation's financial hierarchy... ..to avoid another disaster like the 1929 stock market crash. Don't forget your assignments are due on Friday, class. I told Miss Hall we'd go help decorate the gym. Who are you taking? - David said yes. - Oh, you're kidding! He's so dreamy! Thank you. Thank you, James. How are you enjoying that book I loaned you? - The Hemingway. - I like it. Very much. It's honest. Yes, it's, um... ..it's based on a true story, actually. He fell in love with his... ..hours,... ..child... labour... ..and collective bargaining. - Oh, my God! - Did you see what he wrote? I'm telling you, something weird is going on. "Something weird is going on" - isn't that our school motto? Pretty much. But I don't know. This time... it bugs me. I don't wanna pooh-pooh your wiggins, but a domestic dispute,... ..a little case of chalkboard Tourette's? All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to me. Xander, what happened? Did Cordelia win another round in the broom closet? You're just a big bucket of funny, Will! I'll have you know I was just accosted by some kind of, um... locker monster. - Loch Ness Monster? - Locker monster, he said. Not a monster, an arm that came out of the locker. When we opened it again - nothing. Right after Buffy's teacher did a freaky channelling thing in class. Ooh! Sounds like paranormal phenomena. - A ghost? Cool! - Oh, no, no. No. No cool. This was no wimpy chain rattler. This was "I'm dead, and I won't take it any more." Despite the Xander-speak, an accurate definition of a poltergeist. I defined something? Accurately? - Guess I'm done with the book learning. - So we have some bad boo on our hands? - Yes. - Why is it here? Does it wanna scare people? He doesn't know exactly what he wants. That's the trouble. See, many times the spirit is plagued by all manner of worldly troubles. Being dead, it has no way to... to make its peace. So, it lashes out, growing ever more... confused, ever more... - ..angry. - So it's a normal teenager. Only dead. What can we do? Is there any way to stop it? The only tried and true way is to work out what unresolved issues keep it here... ..and, erm... resolve them. - Fabulous! We're Dr Laura for the deceased. - Only if we can find out who the spirit is. Or was. - Working late, Miss Frank? - I let myself get behind. Is it OK to walk here, George? It is George, right? - Yes, ma'am. Go ahead. - Thanks. Have a nice evening. - You, too. Drive safe. Oh, Miss Frank? - Yes? You can't make me disappear when you say it's over. There's no way we can be together. No way people will ever understand. Accept it. Is that what this is about? What other people think? No! I just want you to be able to have some kind of a normal life. - We can never have that. Don't you see? - I don't give a damn about a normal life. I'm going crazy not seeing you. - I think about you every minute. - I know... but... But it's over. It has to be. Come back here! We're not finished yet! - You don't care any more? Is that it? - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter what I feel. - Then tell me you don't love me. Say it! Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? I don't. I don't! - Now let me go. - No. A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody. Love is for ever. I'm not afraid to use it, If I can't be with you... Don't walk away from me, bitch! I need you, Jenny. Don't! Don't do that, dammit! Don't talk to me like... - What's going on? - What's going on?! You just shot a woman. And this,... ..this is the garden. Wow! Look. Jasmine. - Night-blooming. - Like us. Oh, Angel... it's fairyland. It's paradise. Big windows, lovely gardens. It'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us. If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go. Take a stand, man. Well, our old place was just fine till you went and had it burned down. Things change, Spikey. You gotta roll with the punches. Well, actually, you pretty much got that part down, haven't you? Very funny, mate. What can I say? I just love to see you smile, buddy! Yeah... you're a giver. It was just like the couple Buffy encountered - the janitor remembered everything. He knew he'd killed this poor woman, but he had no idea why. Well, they... they had no intimate relationship. - What about the gun? Did you find it? - No. No. No, the police, everybody, we searched high and low. - I think it's clear what's happening. - Fill me in, then. Cos I've read the book, seen the movie, and I'm still fuzzy about it all. It's Jenny. - What? - You think she's the ghost? Don't you see? She... she died here under tragic circumstances, and now she's trapped. But... what about the gun? I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms Calendar. That's insignificant. It's the violence of the thing that matters. I don't know. These fights these couples keep having, it's sort of... specific. She's right. It's a pattern that doesn't fit with the way she died. Yes, well, I, er... I appreciate your thoughts on the matter. In fact, I... ..well, I encourage you to always, er... challenge me when you feel it's appropriate. You should never be cowed by authority. Except in this instance, when I am right and you are wrong. This is freaky. I don't remember ever seeing Giles be this weird. He's usually "Investigate things from every boring angle" guy. Now he's "I cling on to my one lame idea" guy. What gives? He misses her. He can't think. - Just a little more fallout from my love life. - OK, but this ghost stuff is something else. I'll do a crosscheck on shootings at the school. We need alternate ghost theories. What do we know? Dog spit is cleaner than human. - Besides that? - Oh, boy! We know plenty. A student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance. The rumour was they had an affair, and she tried to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and shot himself. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost. It is one of those two? - It all fits: the gun, the Sadie Hawkins Dance. - Which is tonight. Why have we never heard about this before? When did it happen? 1955. How did you know? Here's the new strangeness. I dreamt about this woman, Grace Newman, the other day. - Her and this guy. - James Stanley? He's the one. He did it. Your dreams are getting wicked accurate, Buff. You haven't seen me come across some big cash? Or possibly knowing the love of a woman? In a full body sense? He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her. Sicko. He looks so normal on this picture. He was smart, too. He made the honour roll. - Smart? - He killed a person and himself. Pretty much two of the dumbest things you could do. I know, but... Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them? Sure I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer and should pay for it. - With his life? - No, he should be doing 60 years in prison,... ..making special friends with Roscoe the weightlifter. Yikes! The quality of mercy is not Buffy. Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers? Well, considering how violent it is, I'm gonna say his. That tracks. I've been browsing on some of Ms Calendar's pagan sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with him, and we can find out what he wants. Who cares? We need to shut him down before another innocent guy kills a nice girl... ..and then blows his brains out in the music room. OK! Who's hungry? Next, please. Move along. I hope you're not going to the dance tonight, cos I'm organising a boycott. Do you realise that the girls have to ask the guys? And pay and everything? - Whose genius idea was that? - Obviously some hairy-legged feminist. Really? We need to nip this thing in the bud. Otherwise, things are going to get scary. They're everywhere! Perfect. I'm gonna be scarred and swollen. Why didn't they just kill me? - Schoolboy pranks? - Never sell. - The sewer got backed up. - I can probably make that one fly. - This is getting out of hand. People talk. - You'll take care of it. I'm doing all I can, but you people have to realise... - What's going on here? - Backed-up sewer line. Same thing happened in San Diego just last week. We're on a Hellmouth. Sooner or later... people will figure that out. The city council was told you could handle this job. If you feel that you can't, perhaps you'd like to take that up... with the Mayor. I'll handle it. I will. Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap that plan. Buffy was right. The time for touchy-feely communication has passed. I've done some homework and found out the only solution is the final solution. Nuke the school? - I like that. - Not quite. Exorcism. Are you crazy? I saw that movie. Even the priest died! - What's the deal? - OK. See here, the balcony? That's where the original teacher died back in 1955, and that teacher last night. That's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from. - We need to create a Mangus tripod. - A what? One person chants here on the hot spot. And the other three chant in other places around the school, forming a triangle. It's supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm. Well, I'll take the hot spot. If there's trouble, that's where it'll be. This ghost, this James guy, is fixating on you, Buffy. The dreams, the yearbook... You sure you can handle it? Well, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am. OK, we have our places. We chant and light candles at midnight exactly. Any questions? Yeah. What if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work? Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all scapulars. OK. So we can flip the ghost over when it turns a nice golden brown? Scapular, not spatula! Um... you wear it around your neck for protection. I have to wear this? It smells like grandpa breath. I didn't have a lot of time. I had to use sulphur. Stinky, but effective. OK, let's do this. This will be a piece of cake. Maybe I'll sleep underground. Dig myself a little burrow. What about your pretty dress, sweet? It'll get all dirty. - Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do. - You know, I'm suddenly likin' this plan. Fortunately, nobody cares what you like... mate. Oh, yeah? Let's ask Dru. There's a gate! - It's opening! - Incoming! I love when she does this. - What gate, pet? What do you see? - It's black. It wants her. - Wants who? - The Slayer. It's time, Angel. She's ready for you now. She's... dancing. - Dancing with death. - Big deal. He won't do anything. Our man Angel here likes to talk, but he's not much for action. All hat and no cattle. I don't know about that. I think this whole Slayer thing has run its course. I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere. - Really? - Oh, yeah! What, with you being Special Needs Boy, I figure I should stick close to home. You and Dru can always use another pair of hands. God! What are you doing here? - You're not supposed to be inside. - What about you? Erm, er... I'm, I'm trying to, er... I think I may be close to, er... contacting Jenny. - What's that smell? - It's my scapular. - Ah, right. Did you use sulphur? - Yeah. That's clever. Well, er... run along then. There may be some, er... paranormal phenomena if I contact her. You don't want to be in the line of fire. OK. Night. # My love must be a kind of blind love # I can't see anyone but you Oh, yeah, baby! It's snake-a-licious in here. # The moon may # Be high # But I can't see a thing # In the sky # I only... - Giles! - Willow! Giles! Giles! - Where are you?! - Please! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Stop! - Just calm down. Get out! - Are you all right? - Giles... Jenny could never be this mean. I know. It's... it's not her, is it? I'm sorry. Oh, God. Oh! Careful up here! I shall confront and expel all evil... I shall totally confront and expel all evil... ..out of marrow and bone... ..out of house and home - never to come here again. Oh, my God! You all right? Get back! Check it. I'd say school's out for good. The good news is... none of you girls were shot. We've established, based on all the parallels and... Buffy's visions,... - ..that it's James' spirit. - So what do we do, Giles? About James. He's reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance when he killed Miss Newman. It's, it's common enough for a spirit to do this - to... recreate a, a tragedy. Hey! If Sunnydale High shuts down for ever, do we automatically graduate? But why? What does he want? - Actually, that's an interesting point. - He's, he's trying to... ..resolve the issues keeping him in limbo. What those are, I'm not... He wants forgiveness. Yes... I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's doomed to kill his Miss Newman over and over and over again, and... - ..forgiveness is impossible. - Good. He doesn't deserve it. To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's not done because people deserve it. - It's done because they need it. - No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion,... ..and that's not something you forgive - no matter why he did what he did. No matter if he knows now it was wrong and selfish and stupid. It is just something he's gonna have to live with. He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead. OK. Overidentify much? I need you, So what do we do next? Do we go in again? Er, not now. No, the, er... ..the spirit is too angry - too, too powerful. No, we have to work out... exactly how and... and if this thing can be defeated. Hey, Buffy, are you...? Oh, God... Giles! She went back. So, what now? Not even a mega-vat of Raid's gonna do the trick here. I don't get it. Is she trying to be a big loner hero? No. I believe she's under the spirit's thrall. He's, he's calling her. But why? James needs her to re-enact what happened on the night he killed Miss Newman. He wants to change things, make... make a happy ending. But it can't ever happen! It always ends the same,... ..which means Buffy just went in there to get shot, Giles. Yes. But the school's deserted. There's no way for James to... ..to play his part. There's no man inside for him to possess. So Buffy should be safe until we find a way to get her out. In theory, yeah. Fun fact about wasps. They have no taste for the undead. Hey, not that a sting would do me any damage. It's just... tonight's special. I wanted to look my best for you. You're the only one. The only person I can talk to. Gosh, Buff. That's really pathetic. You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over. Actually... I can. In fact,... ..I just want you to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that. I don't give a damn about a normal life! I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute. I know. But it's over. It has to be! Come back here! We're not finished! You don't care any more? Is that it? It doesn't matter what I feel. Then tell me you don't love me! Say it! Is that what you need to hear? Will that help? I don't. - I don't. Now let me go. - No! A person doesn't just wake up and stop loving somebody! Love is for ever. I'm not afraid to use it, I swear! If I can't be with you... Oh, my God! - Don't walk away from me... - ..bitch! Stop it! Stop it! Don't make me! All right. Just... You know you don't wanna do this. Let's both... ..just calm down. Now give me the gun. Don't! Don't do that, dammit! Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid... James. # My love must be a kind of blind love # I can't see anyone but you - Grace! - Don't do this. - But... but I killed you. - It was an accident. It wasn't your fault. - It is my fault. How could I... - Hush. I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped loving you, but I never did. I loved you with my last breath. Shh... No more tears. Angel. Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp. - Yep. School can open again tomorrow. - Explain to me again how that's a good thing. I'm drawing a blank. - Are you feeling any better? - James picked me. I guess... I guess I was the one he could relate to. He was so sad. Well,... - ..they can both rest now. - I still... Part of me just doesn't understand why she would forgive him. Does it matter? No. I guess not. You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated. I'm the one who was freakin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you. What was it? A demon? - Love! - Poor Angel. Let's go. I need a real vile kill before sunup to wipe this crap out of my system. Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler. Want to come, pet? No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels,... ..but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light.
