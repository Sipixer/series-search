Well, I had to, reverend. You're my number 1 fan. Oh, you bet. What's the secret? No. Don't. Ice cream! Courtney! Come on. You gotta be kidding me! Can we go with Spencer and get donuts? Oh. Sure. But just one. - OK. You want to go? - Yeah. Let's go. Ice cream? Yeah. It's in the batter. It's an old family secret. Oh, from your lips to God's ears. See you next sunday. I can't believe... Hey, dad. You want to play catch? Uh, sure if it's still light out when I get back. Yeah. Do you really have to go into the office again? It's 3 sundays in a row. Honey, I have 6 hours worth of numbers to crunch and a 9 am deadline. So... - I know. - I know. Somebody's got to pay for this beautiful house, right? Be back as soon as I can. Promise. I'm going to color a picture for you, daddy. And I can't wait to see it, punkin. - I love you. - Love you, too. - See you later. - Bye. Hey, honey. What's up? Would you mind stopping by Rigo's and picking me up some milk for tomorrow? Sure. Anything else? Kids can you turn that down, please? Mommy's on the phone. Hey, do you want the big one or the little one? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis, what happened? Dennis, pick up the phone. Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me Kat? Kathy? Sean? Courtney? Courtney?! Hey, come here babe. Come here. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Tell mommy I'm OK. All right? Tell mom... Tell... She can't hear you, bro? She can't see you either. You're dead. We both are. No. Come here. Shot my ass good. Look at all that blood. This can't be happening. See ya in hell, amigo. I see we're awake. - Where am I? - County general. Where's my family? Your family? You don't have a family. Unless you count the ones you slaughtered. Where am I? Kathleen! - Courtney! - Settle down Brodigan. Synchro : -Lou-, SilverArrow, mpm Fear Itself Season 01 Episode 03 Mr. Brodigan, I'm your, uh, court-appointed attorney. John Meere. I just have a few forms for your review before we get started. Listen to me. My name's not Richard Brodigan. I'm Dennis Mahoney. And I'm a v. p. in the mortgage trust department at first world savings bank. As I was saying, you need to sign these forms. They say I'll be representing you on 26 counts of capital murder. - 19 counts of kidnapping... - No. 19 counts of unlawful restraint - and false imprisonment. - No. No. I'm not this man. Saying this is not you? - Ice cream! - You wanna play catch? I was driving my car. Driving my car. There was an accident. There was an accident, and I was in the emergency room. What happened? I must of... What? Died. I must have died. And when I woke up, I was... I wasn't in my own body. I was in this body. Brodigan's body. I know it... It sounds crazy. All things considered, I would say spiritual transmigration is stunningly crappy defense. Richard... Please, don't call me that. OK. Dennis. Look, county sheriff jumped the gun. They've been under intense pressure to make an arrest in this case. And... as of now, all they have on you is a single shoeprint and the testimony of a 3 year old eyewitness. Everything else is circumstantial. - I'm innocent. - Good. Fine. You're innocent. But you got baggage. The d.a.'s gonna move to include your juvenile record into evidence. Try to establish a pattern that speaks to motive. What juvenile record? You murdered your entire family when you were 12. - Mother. Father. 2 sisters. - No. You need to focus. If we can alibi you for even one of the abductions, I'm trying to tell you we can beat this thing. Now please, Richard. I need you to sign these forms so I can begin to help you. My name is not Richard Brodigan! I am not the family man! My name is Mahoney! I have a wife. Her name is Kathleen. - I'm trying... - ... I have 2 children. Please! Check it out! Check the hospital records! Everything I'm telling you is true! You're the big, bad family man, huh? Genuine celebrity. Actually I'm a little disappointed. I thought you'd be taller, scarier. You're a real bad man, huh? They say you've been shot, stabbed. You just keep on coming. So what are you, family man? Indestructible? Personally, I don't believe it. I think you feel pain. Huh, you weenie. Just like everybody else. - Listen, I don't belong in here. - Shut up! My God! Don't you feel anything? Freak. Inmate, hands through the slot. You've got a visitor, family man. - My lawyer? - No. Personal. Sit. What the hell? Who are you? You know who I am, Dennis? We met in the emergency room. Remember, amigo? Brodigan. I want to be able to tell you that I'm sorry for the way that things turned out for you, but... it's God's will. You gotta accept that. You're wearing my suit? I didn't think you'd mind... Under the circumstances. You got some nice stuff in your closet. Not... my style, but... I'll get used to it. You were in my house? - My family? What have you done? - Easy, Dennis. I swear to God, if you touch my family... I'm not gonna hurt 'em. I would never hurt them. They're a beautiful family. You don't know how lucky you are... Your wife, your kids. They love you. Everyone... They look up to you. - Even people at the bank. - You've been to my job. You can't just take over. We'll see. I'm gonna come back here regular. I'm gonna teach you... Help you... How to get along on the inside. And you are gonna teach me how to get along on the outside. You're crazy. I'm not gonna help you. OK. But I'm the only connection to your family... That you're ever gonna have. You want me to go? I know it sucks for you. You're innocent. But even if they kill you... You get your redemption. Me? This is my chance at redemption. Understand? So... I'm gonna come back in a couple of days. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna take care of... our family. I'm gonna protect them. And I am gonna love them... Just like you would. Good times. Did you check out the things I told you? We have a serious problem. What? Did you check with the hospital? - They found the tapes. - What tapes? In the storage locker you rented in Cleveland. Videotapes of you raping, torturing, and murdering the victims. Entire families, one by one. I gotta get out of here. If you trust me and you work with me, I can possibly save your life. We have one hail mary play. And that's to plead you out to a life sentence in exchange for cooperation with the state. - What kind of cooperation? - A full confession. And they want to know what you did with the bodies. A full confession? I have no idea! I don't know about any bodies. I didn't kill anybody! Please just hear my out, OK. Just check out the names. I gave you the facts and the details. If it doesn't check out, i'll drop everything. And I'll do it your way. I promise. I promise. Come on sleepyhead. You're gonna be late for church. Church? Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I am found come on, sing. Was blind, but now I see. It's so good to have you back, Dennis. - We said a prayer for you. - Ah, just a little bump on the head. So we can count on you for the big pancake breakfast? Sure. I love pancakes. Dennis, he means to make them. Not to eat them. Hey! Excuse me. - Where are you going with my kids? - What are you doing? This punk was taking off with our kids. That's Spencer. He was taking them for donuts. I'm sorry. What is wrong with you? I told you. I just didn't recognize the kid. - You've known him since he was 2. - I know. Wh... what, Dennis? There... there are people out there. Bad people who are waiting for the moment when you're distracted. Just one moment. That's all they need to take your kids. - My kids? - Our kids. That's all it takes. - Well, I had my eye on them. - No. You didn't. You can't. No one can. Not all the time. And that is where they get their edge. Now you think about someone taking your kids, what once? Twice a day? That's all he thinks about. Every minute of every day. And the only time he's not thinking about it is when he's already got 'em. 'cause then he's thinking of all the horrible things he's gonna do to them. Sorry. Just... Ever since the accident... I'm so scared of losing you. As long as you're here with us, we're fine. Hello? - Who's this? - Me, punkin. It's your daddy. Daddy? God... Yeah baby. It's me. - I love you so much. - Here, honey. I got it. Hello? Kathy. It's Dennis. You gotta listen to me. The man in your house is not me. You gotta pack the kids and get out. What's going on? It's that man again. Who is this? You son of a bitch! You need to stop calling this number, or I'm gonna contact the police. What a loon. Don't worry. I'll have the number changed. It's all good. What the hell is your problem? You're wondering why there's no other prisoners in here? 'cause we want you all for ourselves. One of the people that you killed was named Cherie Davenport. Remember her? Pretty little blond. She was my fiance. - You don't understand. - You shut up! You shut up! She was out having dinner with her parents! I couldn't make it because I had to work late! And then we got the call. And I was the first one on the scene! And there was so much blood! It wasn't me. You son of a... Let go. Let go! - I'm not afraid of you. - Yes, you are. Don't try calling the house again. I changed the number. This isn't gonna work. What do you want me to do about it? You want me to turn myself in? Hey officer, this isn't Richard Brodigan. I am. I'm just trapped in the wrong guy's body. You think they're gonna buy that? You think that's gonna work? Come here. Come here. You can run. I got stocks, bonds. You can cash everything out. - Go anywhere in the world. - Well, who's gonna take care of Kathy - and the kids? - They can take care of themselves. No, Dennis. They can't. They need me. They're my responsibility. I'm not gonna abandon them the way my father abandoned me. Besides... who's gonna help Sean... with his batting? Someone's gotta make that kid an all star. And Kathy... To be honest, I've never been... with a woman like that before. She... seems... so shy. But... you get a couple of drinks in... - Don't even... don't you... - Sorry. It's uncalled for. Forgive me. I'll tell you what. Gotta give it to you. I don't know how you do that job, man. That... That... That... boss of yours. - Gerald. - Yeah. I mean, he's always... on me. And I go over... and over the audit reports. And it's never... ever... good enough. - You're right. - Right. You're totally right. Gerald can be a real turd sometimes. The trick is to use his template and it's all boilerplate. Hum, you get sally to fill out the blanks from the monthlies. - She can do that? - Yeah. It's part of her job. See? This is what I'm talking about. We can help each other. Yeah. Sure we can. I gotta go. It's Courtney's school play tomorrow. She's a bumblebee. You... You should see the costume. She's such... a cute kid. So affectionate. Ah, listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm just going on. Ah, tell you what. - I'll bring you some video. - Video? Yeah. Of the play. Gonna be late. Can't keep the old ball and chain waiting. Here's the situation, Brodigan. The F.B.I.'s all over my ass because they want yours. Just so happens the crimes you committed were in my jurisdiction. So I can keep them at bay for a while. But... - not forever. - But I didn't do... Just let me finish. I need to wrap this investigation up quickly. People in my county... deserve closure. That means a proper burial of their kin. For once in your life, do the right thing. Confess your crimes. Tell me where the bodies are. In return... I'll personally go to the D.A. and do my best to get you life. The alternative... is not nearly as attractive. - I'm not the one who did it. - Don't tell me you're innocent. It insults my intelligence. My offer is only good until end of day tomorrow. I'll go out for a while. Oh, yeah. She's leaving. No son of mine is gonna play ball with a glove like that. We just got him that last christmas. This mitt's OK, dad. Really. No. No. It's garbage. You need a real mitt so you won't drop so many balls. You're embarrassing. Right? What the hell? - What are you doing? - That's my spot. We can find another spot. No. He can find another one. That one's mine. Back in the car. Back in the car. Hi. - What's your problem? - Oh, you stole my spot. Your spot? You kidding me? - Move your car. - Or what? Oh, my God! Dennis! - Honey. - Don't touch me! Can I have some more scabetti? Spaghetti. Sure, baby. Seany, are you excited about the museum tomorrow? Yeah. We're gonna see dinosaurs and... What? - Do you want some dinner? - No. I don't want some dinner. Just go make me some toast or something. - Are you sure? I have... - I'm sure. Just make me some toast. And you... Stop playing with this thing at the table. What's your problem? I hate you! Sit down! Eat your dinner. Eat your dinner. What are all staring at? There. One big happy family. You seem distracted. I was just expecting another visitor. That's all. Oh, really. Who? Did you check out those things I told you? Yeah. As a matter of fact I did. Dennis Mahoney. Married. Wife, Kathleen. Reside at the address you gave me. - Has two kids - And everything else? Checked out. Names, birthdates, social security number. The colleges he attended. And yes, he was admitted to the emergency room at approximately the same time as you. Motor vehicle accident. - See I told ya. - Doesn't prove anything. Come on. How am I supposed to know all these things unless I was telling you the truth? This is Dennis Mahoney. Unless if you're willing to stop screwing me around and work with me, - then I can't help you. - But you just told me... I know about the visits. Dennis Mahoney's been here to visit you half a dozen times since you've been incarcerated. What? You didn't think it was public record? People can walk in and out of here without signing in? Showing some i.d.? No. I mean, what's that have to do with anything. It has to do with the fact that he's obviously been feeding you his - personal information. - That... That... That's stupid! - Why would anybody do that? - I don't know, Richard. Why don't you tell me? He's your friend. I want to win this for you. But you got to get on board. When you're ready to deal with reality, call me. Hey! What time is it? - What's it matter to you? - What time are visiting hours over? They ended an hour ago. Shut the hell up. Stand back from the door. I said stand back! Where the hell are you?
