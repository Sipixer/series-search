Well, someone's got to do something. Where's our daddy ? I don't know, tim. You know, if you cared, you'd be out there. Marching into those mountains in the middle of that storm ? Only a fool would do that. Well, with the weather, the sheriff isn't looking either, so you tell me what's being done. Look at you. You're not even dressed for the weather. Where's your gear ? Where's your sense, derek ? You can't tell me what to do. I can, and I am. This isn't even your ranch. Yeah. You aren't our daddy. You just work for him. Won't have a thing to do with it. Making your mama sick with worry, wandering into those mountains, you and your dad both. - Think that's a good idea, son ? - Whatever. Leave it. Just leave it. I'll ride out there again. Go on, get inside. Take your brother. You know he needs looking after. Come on. Helena ? What's going on ? Your son just put me on notice. I'm headed back out there. The storm's still bad, rowdy. Just going to check the foothills. I'll be back tonight. Grady had no businesses leading that hunting party. He may own this land. He don't spend time on it. He's no rider. He don't know weather. He's no rider ? Like you ? When we were little, we played cowboy all the time. He thinks 'cause he owns this spread, he's a real one, but he ain'T. Grady's still playing. In these parts, that will get you killed. I know. I'm worried. But I can't help but think that... Grady ? What ? Oh, my god. Stay here. The kids ! Grady ! Dad ! Dad ! Eddie bear ! Help ! It's grady ! - Grady ! - Grady ! It's me. Rowdy. - It's ok. - Dad ! - It's ok ! - Dad ! We got you. See, I told you. I told you he'd come back. He's ok ! You're going to be ok. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Fear Itself Season01 Episode08 Skin & Bones</font> Did you see his fingers ? And his ears ? That's frostbite, tim. He was up there over a week in the cold. I want him to be better. Look. I know you don't understand the way things are right now. It's not your fault. But this is serious, tim. We got to be ready for whatever happens, and it might not be good. Is he going to die ? I don't know. I don't know. How is he ? Alive, which seems like a small miracle, if you ask me. - He was out there 10 days ? - Yeah. - And he's the only one who came back ? - Right. How do you suppose he survived all this time ? He must have found something to eat out there, but he's lost a lot of weight. Well, is he going to be ok ? Well, we need to keep him hydrated, and he's got to eat something. Make sure he rests, and I'll be back in about 2 days to check on him. Ok ? Did he... did he say anything ? Yes, he did. Says he's hungry. Need a hand ? You need a hand with that ? No. Where's your brother ? I don't know. Derek ! You need to keep an eye on tim. This has been extra hard on him. Where do you get off telling me what to do ? You're not my dad. I'm just telling you 'cause it needs saying. Where do you get off telling me anything ? My dad had to buy this ranch for you to run 'cause you screwed up everything you've ever touched. He's taken a loss on it every year just so you have a place to live. You got a mouth on you, boy. Yeah. So do you. Maybe you should keep it off my mother. You should be inside helping your mother instead of trying to pick a fight with me when all I do is keep this place from falling apart. Be a whole lot easier if my dad just died, wouldn't it ? You don't know what you think you know, kid. Helena... derek would love to carry that tray up to his dad. Is that so, derek, honey ? Yes, mom. I'd love to. - Then you hang up that jacket when you come back down. - Yeah. You know, something's not right with grady. He doesn't even look like himself. It's...it's... it's in his eyes. It's like his... it's like he's somebody else. He's been through hell, is all. If he wasn't still frozen right now, I'd go upstairs, and I'd strangle the life out of him. Dad ! Derek ? Honey, what happened ? He did it, mom. Well, honey, your father's very sick. You have to help him with these things. You can't just set the tray down on top of him. Mom, he knocked the tray out of my hand. What's the matter with him ? Grady ? Baby, are you awake ? You... what is it ? What can I get you ? Taste good. Eddie bear ! - Eddie bear ! - What ? See anything ? We heard the commotion, then it stopped. Is that chestnut ? Ah, damn it ! What would have done this ? Maybe it was a grizzly. Maybe it wasn'T. Look, everybody knows that I run things around here, and with chuck and jasper still missing, it's just me and eddie bear. I think you should drive on out here and take a look for yourself. "Maybe thursday," huh ? Sure don't want to put you out, gordon. Come in. - You find anything ? - Nope. - But I'd like to talk to grady. - All right. I still haven't told him about the mare. No sense getting him riled up. I'd say he already knows. Eddie. How is he ? Well, I heard him pacing around last night, so I came upstairs to sit with him and calm him down. Do me a favor... wait for me downstairs. You, too. So, what you got to say for yourself ? You look scared. Should I be ? When I was a boy, my uncle went missing. 2 weeks it was, lost in the mountains. When he came back, he didn't look right... not at all. How did he look, eddie ? He looked... like you. I've seen what happened to my uncle's family when he came back... torn apart. Well... that's not what's tearing apart the edlund family now, is it, eddie bear ? You've been around. What do you think ? Whatever it is, you best let it go, grady. Whatever it is that's eating you, if you don't let it go, it will devour you. It already has ! Now, you better put that big, bad knife away now, eddie. No one's going to take kindly to a bitter, old indian slitting the throat of a well-appointed ranch owner from the city, now, are they ? You've been good to this place, eddie. I'd be sorry if it was your undoing. You expect me to believe that my brother, who almost died, hasn't strength even to get out of bed, killed a horse in the middle of the night with his own bare hands ? Horse ain't the only thing he killed. He's a whole lot stronger than you think. Ever hear of the windigo ? Sounds familiar. Spirit of the lonely places, a hateful thing that lives in the cold winds of the high mountains. Gets inside people when they're weak, starving. What the hell you talking about, eddie bear ? My uncle... lived on the res all his life, had a rage in him, felt like his people had been wronged. When he got lost up in that mountain, the windigo got inside, took control of his spirit. When he came back, he weren't the same. And then, livestock started going missing. People started going missing. The word got out. The sheriff showed up and gunned him down. That's when I left the res for good. You don't really believe your uncle had a ghost inside him. Don't matter what you call it. It's a madness. It's fierce. Its hunger can't be satisfied. It's an anger can't be settled. It's the windigo. Seen it in my uncle. Now, I see it in grady. Baby... Grady. Baby. Wh... wh-where am I ? What... what happened ? You're at home, and I have no idea what happened. You're going to have to tell us. What's the last thing you remember before waking up here ? We... we got lost. Turned all around. Had to hole up in a shallow cave to stay warm. There was more and more wind, and then, it snowed. Chuck and billy went for help. Never came back. It was just me... and jasper in the cave. I couldn't even keep a fire lit. And then, I remember... a voice. At my ear and in my head. I'll save you. Just let me... in. That's what the voice said. Y-you just have To eat... You know, jasper was... so weak by then... I couldn't help him. I had to eat. I had to. Well... I... I guess I'll tell the kids that you're feeling better. They'll be so happy... The kids. Why don't you just lie down, honey ? I mean, we should call dr. Morgan. Oh, I don't need a doctor. I feel fine. Baby, please, go back to bed. Let her go. Or what ? Don't make me answer that question. You all right ? What's happening to him ? Please... go back to bed, brother. Where are the boys ? Make it stop. Make it stop ! Please, make it stop ! - Tim !We got to... - no ! - We got to go ! - No ! Come on, boys. Out of there. Go, boys ! What's on your mind, eddie bear ? I'm sorry to say, you should have shot him. You know it's got to be done. - No ! - He's insane ! I'd get the boys out of here. Get them to my trailer. I'm not leaving my dad, all right ? I'm not leaving him ! You think that's your father up there ? Well it's not. - Rowdy ! - What ? What do you want me to say ? I'd say get out of here now ! It's not safe. Derek. - What's going on, mom ? - Honey, did you see him ? That's not grady anymore. Something happened to him in those mountains. Come on. Let's go. Right now ! Go. Go with them. Make sure they make it to the trailer. - Could be... By now. - All right. Go up. See if he's there. I'll flush him out if he's not gone already. You get him on the porch, I'll get a clean shot at him. Ok. I'm pretty handy with a hatchet. See who gets him first. It's ok. It's ok. He's coming back. Nothing. Ain't seen neither one of them. I'm headed back. Take it. I'm not going to kill my father. You love your mother and your brother ? - Obviously... - then shut up and take it. I'm going to be out there. You need to protect them. Take it. Rowdy, you going back there, you're going to need that gun. I'll get another one from the rack. No ! No, you can't hurt him ! He's just sick. He's not bad. - Keys to the truck. - Stay. Rowdy ! If I don't come back... tell the boys the truth for me when the time's right. He'll eat... you all... Grady ! Who do you think you're fooling ? Get up out of that bed. Can'T. Too sick. You killed eddie bear ! Had to. Had to do it. I'm so... hungry. I can't help it, rowdy. Please... help me... brother. I don't know how to help you. Well... that works out just fine for you, then, doesn't it ? What's that supposed to mean ? You've always wanted to get rid of me. No. You got it wrong, brother. So you could have... everything I worked for. That's not how it is. Everything... I care about. Well, I hope you're happy now... brother. Forgive me, grady. It's over. Up, up, up. We got to get out of here ! Up. Up ! - Now ? - Now ! Get in there. Go. Derek, give me the gun. Stay back. Get all the way back. Please, grady. Please go away. Don't do it, helena. No, baby. Don't do it. Where's rowdy ? Just... just put the gun down. What'd you do with him ? I will tell you what happened, just put the gun down. No. Helena. I brought dinner ! Get out a nice-sized cooking pot. Why are you doing this ? Do it. Fill it with a couple of quarts of water. Start the stove. Do you even know what you're doing ? Here's an onion and a carrot. Are you still in there, baby ? Stove, please ! Bring it to a rolling boil. You were today. When you look in my eyes, I could see you. You're not gone completely. I want my husband back. Well... we need to have a family meeting. Oh, god, grady. You and me, the kids. Where are the little buggers, anyway ? Well, as soon as we've had a bite to eat, we'll go find them. I wonder if they're still hiding in the barn. You let it in, now you tell it to get out. Cut it up. What ? Cut it up ! And cook it. No. It's just meat. - No ! - Do it ! All right, all right, all right, all right. All right, I'll do it. That's better. Oh, god. Oh, god. Nice-sized chunks, please. Into the pot. We must tidy up for dinner. Soup's on. I've worked up quite an appetite. How about you, helena ? Bowl. Another. Well, you haven't even eaten that. For you. It's all for you. Another for you ! - But...but I'm not hungry. - Eat ! You said for me to cook. I cooked, I did it. Now sit down. Now. Eat. Look, I'm eating. Your beloved rowdy. My brother. You know, when I was up in those mountains, lost, thinking about all I had to live for... you, the boys. My brother. I could feel a rage growing up inside of me. A rage that would not let me die. A rage inside. And I let it in. You did this to me. You and my own brother. You hit me. Put my mother down, you bastard ! Mom ! Mom, are you ok ? Don't worry about me. Go help your brother. No, mom, it's...it's deep. It's deep. - Ok. Go help your brother. - No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Don't die, please. - I'm fine. - Don't die. - I'm fine. - I'm fine. I'm fine. - Mom. I'm fine. Tim. Tim. Tim. Come out, boy. Let him go. - Oh, glad you're here. - Don'T. We should be together. All of us... your mother, rowdy, you, and tim, inside of me, to make me stronger. Daddy, let him go, please. "Daddy" ? I'm not your daddy. Didn't your mother tell you that ? Tim ? Tim, get up. Get up, get up ! Come on. Come on. What are we gonna do now ? Listen to me. Mom's hurt bad, ok ? We have to get her to the doctor. I have the keys to rowdy's truck. No, uncle rowdy said we're never allowed to use his truck ever. Uncle rowdy is dead, tim. He's dead. And he's not our uncle, don't you get it ? I'm sorry. I don't mean to ask so many questions, it's just... I know, I know.Me, too. Look, we got to get mom and get moving, ok ? Derek. It's over, boys. Derek ! No ! No ! Derek ! No. Get your hands off my kids. Derek. Derek. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
