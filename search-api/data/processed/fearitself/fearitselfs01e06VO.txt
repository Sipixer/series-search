Excuse us. We have more news on that blaze at Compton Chemical </i> which broke out just past 10 P.M. There's no indication what started the fire,</i> but we have learned that some 3 dozen workers are injured</i> and at least 10 people have been killed.</i> A spokesman for the fire department tells me</i> they hope to have the fire contained in the next few hours.</i> In the meantime, they are asking people to avoid the east side of town...</i> I'm sorry I haven't really been there for you. It's OK. I'm fine, really. I'm OK. Remember when you used to cry whenever my mother would pick me up from your place? Yeah. I was 4 years old. Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying. We've been friends for a long time. And... I know we've drifted apart. But I love you. You're like a sister to me. And I promise I'm gonna try and... you are the only real friend left in my life. - Don't say that. - It's true. I mean, look around. Do you really think I fit in with that crowd in there? - Who cares if you don't fit in? - I've never fit in anywhere. Those girls in there are wearing masks. They don't even know who they are. You do. You're unique. You're special. But guys are attracted to women like that... I don't know, women who don't really have... any real feelings that might complicate a relationship and that somehow can always smile, regardless of what is tearing them up inside. - What are you saying? - I don't know. I'm just saying that you're the only person that really likes me for me. And I cannot even tell you how much I love you for that. I'm sure I'm not the only person here that likes you. I'm gonna go find James. The exposure to the ash is hazardous and...</i> - James... - Helen, it's... - What is going on? - Helen, is that you? What? James, I can't hear you. - <i>I can't make out what you're saying.</i> - Chrissy told me to come - <i>to visit.</i> - If you can hear me, - <i>don't go anywhere near them.</i> - What? You have to stay inside your apartment. - James, I can't hear you. - Helen... What? I can't understand what you're saying. James, I said I'm coming over. Listen... There's something wrong with the phone. God, I love you. I... tried calling you. I thought you said - you were gonna call before. - Yeah. My phone died. Sorry. I'm sorry. My... I'm sorry! My cell phone sucks. I suck, OK? I got busy, and then... and then I was late, and that's why I didn't call you. But look, I promise I'm not avoiding you. OK? - You OK? - What? - Are you OK? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You don't look OK. - I'm fine. - All right. Let's get that drink. Come on. Can we... So, I'm sorry. I just really don't like dancing. It's fine. - Eddie was telling me... - Really? What did... What did he have to say? He was just talking about relationships. What would he know about relationships? Has he ever been in one? He wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about, you know, me and you. Really? And I know that it hasn't really been that long, but... but you're just... one of the few people that really understands me. You're not that complicated. I love you. I know, I said it. It's out there, I love you. You do? Look, I know I've been outside of myself, but... Look. You say that I never take chances. What was that? I'll be back. We're gonna make it... I promise you. We'll make it. Wait! We've got to hide. Yes. Wait! You can't leave me. I can't do this without you. You have to be strong. I'm so sorry. Nothing to be sorry for. We've had a good life. It's not fair that it ends this way. We can't choose the way we leave this earth. But I can make sure that you don't become one of them. Oh, God, my angel. Do it quickly, Richard. Get away! What did you do? Get away from us. You did this! It was you! You did this to my wife! You did this to her! It was you... all the time, you! You did it! You did this! I know what you did. I know what you did. 4! 3! 2! 1! Happy new year! Happy new year. Have you seen James? Come with me. I want to tell you something. Action news has just learned from police that despite earlier reports</i> from the fire at Compton Chemical, there is no evidence of fatalities.</i> No one, it seems, has died. However, we just spoke to an eye witness who told us he saw</i> 3 horribly disfigured plant... What do you think is going on? Beats the hell out of me. A spokes person for compton chemical is calling that report...</i> Anyway, back to James. Have you seen him at all? He was somewhere over there. He could be anywhere. I don't know. I'm gonna go find him. Why don't you just forget about James? Because I told him... I told him that I loved him. - You what? - You said that he loved me... - No, I... I never said he loved you. - Yes, you did. I said that I knew how he felt about you, but... damn it. James doesn't love you. What? I just couldn't stand to see you hurting like that. Like what? - What are you talking about? - You really don't get it? No. Stop playing games with me. Before you say anything, just please hear me out. James wants someone who's like everyone else. But you... thank God... you're so different. Just stop it. Oh, my God. Dozens of reports of infected people savagely attacking victims</i> with the intent to kill... in some cases, to eat. Avoid contact with these people at all costs...</i> - <i>Do you read?</i> - Officer? - <i>Are you there, officer Greenwood?</i> - Officer? My God, I need your help. OK, we gotta get out of the city. - Officer? Officer? - And go where? I don't know. Someplace away from these freaks. Help me! No! If you're just joining us now, again, dozens of reports of infected people savagely attacking</i> victims with the intent to kill, in some cases, to eat.</i> Repeat. Avoid direct contact with these people at all costs...</i> Again... - But will you listen to me, please? - No, I can't, I can't. Don't walk away. Helen, wait! - Where is James? - Helen... Where is James? - Oh, James! - What? Helen, please... James! - What? - Oh, my God. What are you shouting at? Oh, my God! Helen, wait! Looks like the power is out... again. Don't be mad at me. Oh, man. You are wasted. Listen. Hopefully, you don't remember, but I... You OK? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Helen, breathe! Hold on. Hold on. What are you doing here? What happened to you? She's one of them. She's one of them... and has been all night. I can't make out what you're saying. Get away! You did this! Please. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
