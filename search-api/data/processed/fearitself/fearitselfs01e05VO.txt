Transcript : Synchro : SilverArrow, -Lou-, mpm Season 1 Episode 5 - Doesn't even know how to play. - And I tried... - All right, now. Let's see who's here. - Bernard Taylor. - Right here, boss. - Steve Proctor. - Yo. - Sean Longway. - Yeah, here. - Danny Bannerman. - Here, Sergeant. Yep, she's here all right, Sarge. Oh, man. Check this out, Sarge. She's got the latest issue of death dance. "For all your horror needs." - Give it back. - Back off. Back off. Back off. - You got it all over me. - Let's take a look in here. Death dance? What kinda sense does that make? 'Bout as much sense as officer Stephen King over here. Freakin' boot. It's bad enough we have to have a chick watchin' our backs. - That's enough. - She's not a chick. She's goth cop. And you better watch out, or she'll suck your blood. Yeah, she sucks, all right. Now, what do you say we cut the wisecracking and get back to work. She's only been here 3 months, and she's already busted more knuckleheads than any two of you combined. - Steinwitz. - Yo. - Mattingley. - Yeah. All right, Taylor, Proctor, Longway, check your call sheets. There's an updated list of the stolen vehicle models. Check your list. Keep your eyes open. One more thing before I let you guys go. We have a special overnight guest staying upstairs in our holding cell. His name is Dwayne Mellor, and he's... an eater. He's a what? An eater. Eater? Over the last 2 years... Mellor has killed over 30 people in 5 different states. In each case, took the victims home, usually killing the males outright, keeping the females alive for days, sometimes weeks... playing with them, torturing them, and eventually... eating them. The feds will be here in the morning to take him off our hands. Report's right here in case anyone's interested. All right. That's it for tonight. You're holdin' down the fort. I'll see you in the mornin'. Hey, Sarge, that guy, he really ate those people?{\Serge?} That's what the report says. 32 of 'em to be exact. He got hungry, he'd... carve a little meat off the bodies and throw it in a frying pan. They found intestines and other body parts in the fridge wrapped up in plastic bags. Leftovers, huh? You think that's weird? Wait'll you hear about the wardrobe they found hanging in his closet custom made... from the skin of his victims... supposedly taken while they were still alive. Hey, that's like that, Silence of the lamb guy, right? - Hannibal Lecter. - Yes, I ate his liver... with some fava beans and a nice chianti. Actually it was Buffalo Bill who skinned his victims in silence of the lambs. Hannibal Lecter just liked to eat human flesh. - Who asked you? I was just trying to keep the facts straight. Nothin' worse than a horror movie geek. What's that on your shirt? - Fine. - I don't know, Sergeant. - Get it cleaned up. - Sorry, Sergeant. You know, it's never easy being a boot. Being a female boot... even harder. Just keep doin' what you're doin'. Make it through your year of probation, you'll be a cop and they'll respect you. They might not like you... but they'll respect you. - I will. Thanks, Sarge. - Good. Because if you don't... they might feed you to Mellor. Have a good night. Hey, I wanna ask you. Sarge, do you know that half - of Bannerman's arrests are cita... - Hey, Sarge. You mind if I take a look at that report? Pretty gory stuff. Don't let it spook you. Don't worry. I'm used to this kind of thing. Yeah. You know, Hannibal the cannibal is make-believe. This guy isn't. Marty, wait up. - Goin' to check up on the prisoner? - Yeah. I'm gonna go see if he's hungry. You wanna come see for yourself? I'll be up in a little bit. I have to go change my shirt. Oh, yeah. Listen, sorry about that. You're not worried about bein' alone with us here tonight, are you? - Should I be? - Nah, course not. I mean, we're the good guys, right? Bastards. Please. I'll do anything. Please. Please don't. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. My God. Oh my G... Hello? Did you hear that? - Hear what? - I was downstairs, and I thought I heard something. A crash, like, something fell, - and then the lights flickered. - No. Didn't hear a thing. What kind of pizza is that? Pancreas, large intestine. Very funny. You know we're not supposed... to eat in here because of the rats. Well, if you don't tell the rats, I won't. You want some? No, thanks. So I was reading the report on Mellor. I didn't know he was cajun. Yeah? So what? So it struck me as kind of odd. I've never heard of a cajun serial killer. That's 'cause he's an eater, not just a serial killer, OK? There's a big difference. Can you believe he made lampshades out of human skin and bowls out of human skulls? I know. That's pretty damn creative, right? - No, it's pretty damn sick. - Pretty damn resourceful if you ask me. You know, down on the bayou, the cajun, they use every part of their kill. They'll take a big, ol'fat gator, they'll eat all the flesh. They'll take the hide. They'll use it for shelter and for clothing, take the bones, use 'em as utensils, weapons. I think Mellor's doin' the exact same thing. He's just doin' it with human beings, that's all. That's even sicker. Waste not, want not. - Is there any coffee? - I'll go make a fresh pot in a minute. - Want me to do it? - No, no. I'll do it. Let me finish my supper here. So what did you think when you saw Mellor? - What do you mean, what'd I think? - Come on, Steinwitz. What's he like? What do you mean? Does he have, like, horns or a tail, - somethin' like that? - No. I mean... What's he like? How does he talk? How does he look? He looks hungry. How am I supposed to know what he talks like? He didn't make a peep when I was up there. You're so interested, why don't you go talk to him yourself? I'm sure he'd love to see a pretty, young thing like you. Didn't your parents ever teach you any manners? My parents were murdered when I was 10 years old. Marty, I'm... I'm sorry. I did...I didn't know. My parents weren't murdered. They live down in Florida. They're all fat and tan. I'm just playin' with you. I swear I don't know what the heck's gotten into you tonight. Sergeant one to central. He's not breathing. You need anything? - Do you want anything? - How about a plate of liver and some eyeball risotto? - You scared the hell out of me. - Here you go. Service with a smile? - Is it good? - Thanks. Special blend. You seen Mattingley? No, not since he came up here to watch the prisoner, no. Would you check him out? Guy's out like a light. So... you ever, ever wonder why he does it? Kill people? And eat them. I mean, that's the thing, right? It's... - It's the eating people. - Maybe he gets a thrill out of it. A thrill. Yeah, you know, like some kind of sexual turn-on. Why don't you go ask him? I mean, I'm sure he's agreeing with everything you're saying. You listening to us? - You ever wonder what it tastes like? - What? I mean human flesh. Same as any other meat, I guess. You know, I think it's the power. What is? You know, that gets him off. I think it's... I think it's the power that, uh, gives him the edge. - How you figure? - I mean, there's an old voodoo saying that says that if you cut a man's heart out and then you eat it before it stops beating, not only do you gain his strength, but you also gain his spirit. So you're telling me this... What? What was that? - What is it? - I thought I heard somethin'. Maybe it's Mattingley. No, it's not Mattingley. I told you I thought I heard something earlier. Wait here. Everything OK? Come on. No more games. Damn it. Up and die on us? I ain't so sure you wanna be doin' that. I'm not sure you wanna do that at all. Where have you been? Didn't you hear me calling you? If I'd've heard you, I'd have answered. Someone left the cell unlocked. - Not me. - Marty thought he heard something - downstairs. - Wasn't anything. What? I just spoke to Marty. He told me to tell you, it wasn't anything. - Then what was the noise that he heard? - I don't know. The wind, a rat. Who the hell knows, who the hell cares? Stop bein' such a... woman. You just saw Marty downstairs? What's he doing now? He didn't say. I tell you, this whole thing is really startin' to give me the creeps. What whole thing is that? What's so funny? What? It's you. You guys are doing this on purpose. You're... You are tryin' to mess with my head. - How you figure? - I see what you guys are trying to do. What exactly are we tryin' to do, boot? Nothing. Forget it. You want another cup of coffee? - How did you know I already had coffee? - What's that? Speak up! Do you want another cup of coffee, or what? Did Marty just ask me if I wanted coffee? Marty's not here. How could he ask you if you want a cup... - I thought I heard his voice. - That was me. - I asked if you wanted a coffee. - That wasn't your voice. - What's wrong with you? - Tell you what's wrong with me. How 'bout we're holed up in here with some wacko who eats people for a hobby, the guy up and dies on us while he's in our custody. - How is that gonna look in the morning? - He's just sleepin', that's all. I'm telling you, he's dead. I have been watching him. Where you goin'? I'm going to tell Steinwitz we have a problem. Hey, Marty, we got a problem upstairs. Hey, you hear me, Marty? We got a big problem. OK, guys, very funny. Damn it, guys, this isn't funny anymore. What the hell's the matter with you? You know, the phone lines are down. - What's goin' on, Bannerman? - He's out. - Who's out? - The eater. - Listen, let's calm down. - He's out. He's loose in the station. - How? - He killed Mattingley and now he's disguised as... as Marty. - Marty Steinwitz? - Before that, he was Mattingley. Listen, I don't know what you been smokin' and boot but you... Listen to me, damn it. He's taken their appearance. I know it sounds insane, but he has. - How's that possible? - How the hell should I know? Steinwitz said... Steinwitz said that there's this old voodoo legend that if you cut outa person's heart and ate it before it stopped beating, that you wouldn't only gain the person's strength, but their spirit, too. Maybe this guy gets it all, not just their strength, but the hair, and the face, the body, everything. Like some kind of shape-shifter? So you're saying he assumes the identity of whoever he eats. I know it sounds insane, but yes. So wait. He broke out of his holding cell and ate Mattingley and Steinwitz? {\All I know is}- I know that they're never together. - Together? They're never in the same room at the same time. When Mattingley came into the holding cell, he sat the exact same way that Steinwitz had sat just a few minutes before... and you know all this because Steinwitz and Mattingley sat the same exact way and they were never in the same room at the same time? Mattingley's body is stuffed underneath a desk. His heart is ripped right out of his chest. I swear to God, Sarge. OK. You believe me? Let's just say I believe you believe and leave it at that. Either way, We've gotta go check this thing out. What do we do now? Go up and look inside that cage. You hear something? You see anything? Nothin'. It's comin'from the holding room. Let's wait for backup before we go in there. If Steinwitz needs our help, we can't leave him. Wait for me. Take a look. He ate his heart. Freeze! Don't move. What the hell? Gotta be. Check his face, Bannerman. I don't like this. You're one hell of a cop. J'ai faim. Il faut que je mange. What the hell are you doin'? It's me, Marty. What's gotten into you tonight? - You're not Marty. - I'm not? Then who the hell am I? You're Mellor. You're the damn eater. That's right, darlin'. And you know us Cajuns. We don't eat to live. We live to eat. Oh, come on. I didn't think you scared so easily. I thought you were used to this kind of stuff. Come on, pretty lady. Aren't you tired of playin' this game. Let me eat your heart out. I guess Marty never taught you the code. You had it figured out all along, didn't you? Well, it was fun while it lasted. I can't let you go. Can't let me go. How cute. Such a trouper, right to the very end. You see, I particularly like it when my prey is frightened. Relax. It only hurt a little while. Woman! No more games! I'm tired of playin' with you. Come here. Time to eat. RAT POISON KILLER POWDER You bitch!
