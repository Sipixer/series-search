to go to prison?</i> The kind of guy who leaves his brother all alone</i> and his friends with nothing to jump for?</i> Well, that's me. And for the next two years, my name is Inmate #28301-016. I survived my first night in prison, but I was terrified wondering what the next 729 days had in store.</i> But I was hoping I'd be okay since I had my good friend Ralph with me to watch my back.</i> Come on. Out of your bunk, hands off junk. Season 1 - Episodes 1 and 2 My Name is Inmate 28301-016 Subtitles by Loky and Jarick Transcript by swsub.com Hey, buddy, if you're reading this, by now you know I'm long gone.</i> I had to get out of this godforsaken hellhole.</i> I would have taken you, but I got hungry last night</i> and I ate the other melon. Sorry about that.</i> Your buddy, Ralph. PS: I made mouth hole in the melon for you if you get my drift!</i> Rock and roll! Turns out Ralph paroled himself and left me with a broken water melon head and a lot of explaing to do.</i> Escape attempt! Cell block seven! Lockdown! Since there was a hole in my cell, I was moved to general population.</i> So lent from sharing a private cell with my childhood friend</i> to joining a two-year slumber party with murderers and rapists.</i> I'd been to county lockup plenty of times, but</i> never been to prison. And prison life took some getting used to.</i> A typical day in prison can be broken down into several activities.</i> First, you wake up and make sure nothing's happened </i> to your two most important things. Next, you head over to the mess hall for breakfast.</i> You going to eat your steak? Then you spend most of your day trying not to get too bored.</i> Seven. Three. Five. Six. Two. Nine. Nice. Finally, it's time for bed. And that's the hardest time of all because</i> then you're alone with just your thoughts.</i> The only thing that breaks the routine is when one prisoner tries to kill another. If you're lucky, you're not the victim. Lockdown! But no matter what, you still get punished.</i> And everyone gets searched. Thoroughly searched. Not surprisingly, prison was turning out to be a miserable place.</i> But the one bright spot was visiting day when I got to see my friends.</i> Some friends I got to see more of than others.</i> You don't realize what you're doing to them coming in dressed like that. I don't like to change at work. There's a new girl who steals your pants and then sells them back to you at unreasonable prices. What do you got there? Oh, I'm not ready yet, Earl. You go ahead, Darnell. Here you go, Earl. Sometimes incarcerated people use their time to get closer with God. Those are some books I found to be helpful on my journey to find religion. Holy Bible. The Torah. Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. So where's Joy? She's feeling guilty about you going to prison. She didn't want to come empty-handed. I give up. I am just not crafty. What's the matter? This damn glass portrait of Earl. I just can't make it give off his angelic essence. I even stole half this glass from a church window. I like it. It looks like Earl'd look if he was made out of glass. Does it matter if you like it? Were you the hero that sacrificed your freedom to save me from prison having to pee in front of a woman named Trudy? This is not good enough for Earl. I hate it! I'll get the broom. She'll come visit once the search for the church window thief dies down. There's a lot of heat right now. It could be a while. They were Lutherans. Everybody quiet. It's my turn. First question: Where do we hide the toothpaste? Behind the mirror. The bathroom mirror. Pulls open from the left. A secret compartment. Your visiting time is over. Thanks for coming. No. Darnell talked the whole time. I hardly got to ask any of my questions. Earl, how do you set the alarm clock? And what's our apartment number again? I miss you. I would have worried more about how Randy was gonna make it on his own,</i> but I was more worried how I was gonna survive.</i> When you're the new guy in prison, everyone sizes you up.</i> And they test you daily. One thing I do know is you can't let people think you're a punk.</i> And I'd always heard the best way to earn respect in prison</i> is to walk u to the biggest guy and punch him as hard as you can.</i> Unfortunately, the closer I got, the bigger he seemed,</i> and I lost my nerve. The problem is, the gangs in prison are divided up like my dad's sock drawer,</i> by color. I was too white to join the Latino gang, the Asian gang or the Black gang. And not white enough to join the Albino gang.</i> I'm telling you, we got to take back the shady part of the yard. So I went with the only gang that might take me, the white supremacists.</i> Which meant unlearning what every after-school special had taught me:</i> don't be yourself. Hey, who else thinks the Civil War ain't over, it's just halftime? I'm just saying, I don't see why I have to shave my head. Hate's is in your heart, not in your hair. Forget it. I'm out. Geez, you'd think the superior race wouldn't be so threatened by new ideas? I had just about given up hope of finding a gang to join when</i> finally I saw a crowd I thought I could hang with,</i> the old-timers. The one group that had obviously figured out how to survive in prison.</i> Come on. You can't put me all in. You only got one cashew. Hey, guys, got room for one more? Sure thing, young man. Take a seat. I'm Charlie, this is Whisky Pete, Philadelphia Mike, John and Skinny John and old Dirty Neck. That sure is one dirty neck. I'm Skinny John, you jackass. They might not have been the toughest gang,</i> but they were a gang and they had figured out how survive, and that made me feel safer.</i> Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Mae West. That's easy. I'd take Greta Garbo for a milkshake, Mae West to the drive-in, and I'd kill Judy Garland. Who would you take to the drive-in? No, that's okay, you guys play. Don't you like broads? No, I love broads. You don't like talking about killing broads? I don't know. It just seems kinda creepy 'cause all those broads e dead. Was there a plane crash or something? How long have you guys been in here? And then realized the reason they let me in their gang wasn't for my survival,</i> it was for theirs. You're not taking our nuts anymore, you big palooka! We got us some young blood now! Get him, Earl! Pistachio? You like it? I used up all my felt. It's amazing. These are all scenes from my life? It's like a straight version of one of those AIDS quilts. Thank you, Joy, I won't forget this. That's when I got chicken pox, and you were... off banging Darnell. I was trying to be accurate. You hate it. I knew you'd hate it. I don't hate it. I said it was nice. No, I see how it is. I mean, you like me feeling guilty. No matter how many of the kids' coats I cut up for you, we'll never be even because you like holding this over my head, don't you? Well, bravo, you son of a bitch! Do I have time for a question right now? You wait your damn turn, you stupid yeti. Would you tell your brother to stop calling me asking me what time it is? Dumbass already lost his job. That's cause no one will show me how to set this thing. I'm not a scientist. What's your question? Can I borrow money for the vending machine? You're the one with access to the bank account. The bank closes at 5:00. My clock always says it's 12:00 AM. You want some change? Go fetch. I swear that boy's not going to survive without you. He keeps carrying one of your old shirts cause he misses your smell. Yeah, he seems to be having a little trouble letting go. How'd you sleep last night? It was scary out here. I saw a possum. Wait a second... if you want things to be even with us, how about you let him move in with you, keep an eye on him for me? Oh, no. On the way over here, he got his hand stuck in the tape deck... I can't put up with that crap. Come on, Joy, you said you wanted to even the score. I mean, this could really help. All right. I'll do it. Can you throw more money on the floor? I want to get myself a nice, cold drink. You know what? This might be fun. Now that I knew Randy would looked out for,</i> I could get back to figuring out how to look out for myself.</i> Sonny was a guy I used to play Beer Can Tag with back in the day.</i> I got you, Earl. Ain't no use running, fool! I know where your ma pas your house! After that, Sonny just disappeared. Everybody's always asking what happened to you. I mean... for the first couple weeks anyway then you know, life goes on. I can't believe you got two years for hitting a cop with an beer can. Yeah, well, I also kind of wrestled the cop's gun away and drove around with him in the trunk of his car for a few hours. It was crazy day. How come this is the first time I've seen you? Because this is the first time I wanted you see me. Turns out, Sonny figured out another way to survive in prison... be invisible.</i> And he agreed to teach me how to do it. I learned things like two fat guys on a bench didn't have to be scary,</i> They could also be a nice. shady place to hide and play cards.</i> And if you didn't mind scorching hot water and wrinkled feet,</i> you could hide out in the showers practically alI day.</i> And if you could deal with not chewing your food and a little indigestion,</i> you don't have to spit on your lunch so no one will take it from you.</i> You press the "setime" button to set the time. And you press the "set alarm" button to set the alarm. "Set the time" to set the time "Set the alarm" to set the alarm. Why didn't you tell me it rimes? There you go. Have a good night. If you need anything, we'll be right back there. If possible, could you try not to need anything for the next 20 minutes or so? We're going to go... balance the checkbook. No, wait. Earl usually talks to me till I fall asleep. The checkbook. I've got to transfer some funds, baby. I'll be right in. You go sharpen your pencil. You know we're not really balancing the checkbook? You got three minutes or else he finishes without me. - What do you want to talk about? - Time travel. Horses. - All right, horses. - No, no, ... Seahorses. Seahorses in space... travel. No. Time travel. So, you got a girl waiting for you on the outside? Well, I was starting to see this deaf lawyer lady, but once I got into prison, we decided to star seeing other people. That's a better deal for her. I figured that out, but it was after I'd already agreed. - Sorry, man. - No problem. You're new here, right? Want candy bar? - Really? Thanks - No! Walk away. Walk away. What part of "stay invisible" don't you understand? - It was just a candy bar. - "Just a candy bar"? You almost just fell for the oldest prison scam there is. He wants you to owe him something. Today he "gives" you a Snickers bar. Tomorrow, he's going to expect a Zagnut bar. Do you know where to get a Zagnut bar? Damn. 'Cause I owe a guy one. I don't know if they make them anymore. Some guy gave me a candy bar once, a real maniac, now I owe him a favor. In prison, a favor can get you killed. So trust me, do not owe anybody anything and stay invisible. You might make it out of here in one piece. Oh, crap. - What's wrong? - That's Glen Shipy. I know him. When I knew Glen, he was a Camden Scout. Even though you only had to wear uniform if you were going to a meeting,</i> Glen was so proud, he wore it every day. The regular scouts left Camden County years before</i> when a local militia group got caught using the scouts to round up aliens.</i> So, in Camden, we had Camden outs, and back when I was an amateur criminal, I often used them as accomplices.</i> So what happened was, I lost my key I need to get in there so I could get my TV and VCR and anything else expensive I happen to see. If I boost you up through the window, will you open the door for me? The Camden Scout motto is "Always be helpful". It's got my neskerchief! Seems like that guy should be on your list. He is. I think he's number one hundred and something. - Do you think he still remembers you? - I don't plan to find out. I'd never turned my back on someone on my list before.</i> It just wasn't like me. But I realized that if I was going to survive in prison,</i> I wasn't going to be able to be like myself.</i> The fat guys are on the move. Get ready to hitch a ride. I see you, Earl Hickey! Lockdown! I'm coming for you, Earl. I am going to rip off your ears, shove them up your butt just so you can hear me kicking your ass! When they want you to cool off, they put you in the Hot Box,</i> which doesn't make much sense, but neither than put violent criminals together</i> and expecting them not to break the rules.</i> Where are you, Earl Hickey? I'm gonna find you! I'm gonna track you down and wear your pelt! I see you! You're hiding behind the fat guy! Now you're hiding behind the skinny guy. That doesn't even make sense. Sonny had ratted me out, and I wanted to know why.</i> II'm sorry, I'm sorry. Remember I told you I owed some guy a Zagnut bar? - Well, Glen is the guy. - I should kick your ass. Look. You're making a scene. Invisible. Invisible. Inwisible. Invisible? You blew that for me. - Now Glen can see me clear as day. - Yeah, but I'm still invisible. Come on, please. Okay, look. I'm trying to stay calm with this here. What are we gonna do about this? Son of a bitch. Lockdown! All I would have had to do was stay away from Glen...</i> but as it turned out, Karma had a different plan.</i> - You're a dead man, Earl Hickey! - Holy Moses! I'm gonna kill you, Earl. I'm going to rip off your face and wear it to the Ugly Ball. That's scary and hurtful, Glen. You're a dead man. My Uncle Roger once had a pet pig. Mostly it was an okay animal, but when it got mad you just had to stand back and let it squeal.</i> So I decided to handle Glen the same way.</i> I'm going to wear you like a puppet on my fist and then get in a punch fight with a man made of razor blades! While I was trying to keep from getting killed by Glen,</i> Joy was trying to keep Randy from getting killed by Randy.</i> What the hell are you doing? You almost walked out in front of that truck. I don't look where I'm going. It's kind of my thing. But just let me know if I'm about to walk into something... like Earl does. Although she was discovering that he took more care of than she expected.</i> It's so beautiful. That thing zaps bugs. What do you think it's going to do to your finger? Yeah, you're right. For the love of God, pick something. I'm sorry, I usually just order what Earl gets. Well, Randy, I talked to the prison, and they said Earl was having duck "à l'orange" and caviar pie. I think the guy was being facetis. But we don't have it anyway, so it doesn't matter. We may not know what Earl would order, but we could find out what "Little Earl" would order. Stop it! He is getting way too dependent on that thing. "Grilled cheese looks pretty good, Randy." And after two days, the only thing keeping Joy from killing Randy was...</i> the promise she made to me. All right, fine! I'll warn you if you're about to walk into something. Don't walk. Okay, walk. Go... I feel like I'm praying Frogger. Turns out, Glen had a little bit more stamina than Uncle Roger's pig.</i> Probably 'cause Glen didn't smoke. I'm gonna yank out your skeleton, like a cartoon bear eating a fish and use it to beat your soul! I'm going to stick a broom down your throat, flip you upside-down, take you to the barber, sweep up all the dirty hair. I'm gonna rip off your skin, and wear it like a track suit. Then I'm gonna roll around in broken glass and then put you back in it. I'm gonna rip off your hands and put them where your feet go, rip off your feet and put them where your hands go. I'm going to point at you, and I'm gonna laugh. But eventually, even tar-free lungs wear themselves out. I'm gonna rip out your hair... put it in a jar... I don't know... Mail it to the Pope... with a salmon. First I'd like to say that I'm impressed with... the creative ways you thought of killing me. That one with my heart as a cue ball and... apes playing pool? Scary. But are you sure you got the right guy? I mean, I vaguely remember hearing about you falling in a window and, maybe, I don't know, something about a dog or something. Something about a dog? There were two of them attacking me! They fought over my body! That's when I found out the dog attack was just the beginning.</i> Glen was arrested for breaking and entering,</i> burglary, and vandalism. And when the police dog broke a tooth on in a shin bone,</i> he was also charged with assaulting an officer.</i> That stupid judge sent me to juvie for six months. Got in a fight, got more time. Got in another fight, slimed a guard, tried to escape, got out, stole something, went back in, got out, robbed a mini mall, threw rocks at the mayor. If I think about it, everything I did was your fault. I don't know if you can really blame me for everything, I mean, personal choice seems to... I will twist your yam-sack like a balloon animal! You know, on second thought, I can see how you could connect the dots like that. Look, how about I do something to make us even? Like, uh... I hear you like candy bars. I got some people on the outside who could track down a... a Zagnuts. Make me a shiv. A shiv like a knife? Or like an ice pick, or an axe, or a cheese slicer. Surprise me. Generally, I tried not to break rules in order to cross things off my list,</i> but I wasn't as worried about my list as I was about surviving.</i> And besides, I wasn't me anymore. I was prisoner number 28301-016. Okay. A shiv it is. What, Randy? Do you know if that TV show Riptide is gonna be on tonight?</i> I swear to God, Darnell, I can't keep living like this. That show hasn't been on for 20 years! Then what's the show I'm thinking of? You know, the one with the monkey? - I think he means B. J. and the Bear. - Don't you dare tell him that. Once he knows, he'll start telling us about every episode. Oh, wait. I think it's B. J. and the Bear.</i> Damn it. Remember the one where they were driving</i> that semi together? Okay, that's it. This ends now. Push. Why would B. J. name his monkey "Bear"? Because BJ was a huge Alabama fan and he named him after the coach "Bear" Bryant. You happy? Now listen, we gotta talk. As you know, I promised Earl I would take care of you... - And I really appreciate it, Joy. - Not done yet. But after the last few days, I've realized something. You're not just dumb, you're broken. Like a daddy long-legs after the kids pull his legs off. It's just a little, vibrating ball that can't do nothing for itself. That's you. - I'm a spider ball? - Yeah. And you're a burden to your brother. Now I could babysit you for 2 years, but when Earl gets out of prison, you wouldn't be any better. And you don't want to be an albacore around your brother's neck, do you? Is this because I peed on the kids? It was the middle of the night. I took a wrong turn. It's because of a lot of things, Randy. Like... that dumb look you got on your face all the time. Or the fact that... you think there's a left sock and a right sock. But don't you worry. We're going to work everything out... starting with this late-night talking. You can't breathe because of your deviated septum, can you? I saw that on MASH. Night. Since it was my first time in the cage, I got out before Glen, who, from what I heard,</i> seemed to spend more time in there than his cell.</i> To survive in prison, I needed to stay invisible.</i> But I also needed to get Glen a shiv. I was familiar with the different types of shivs.</i> There was the sharpened toothbrush, the razor comb... There was the Tighty-Whitey-Mighty-Fighty,</i> somehow made out of underwear... There was even one made out of soap.</i> But the one made out of soap had its downside.</i> I decided I was gonna make Glen's with an arm from a pair of glasses.</i> I was going to call it "The Peeper Reaper".</i> How about you? Would you hate Martin Luther King more if he'd been Indian? Okay, yeah. I'd hate him more if he'd been Indian. Unless he was Cherokee. A Cherokee once saved my black grandpa from drowning. I was relieved when, a couple days later,</i> Glen got out of the hot box. Mostly cause I wanted him out of my life.</i> But also because, when you hide a shiv in your pants for two days,</i> you can't help but have a few mishaps. You got it? Nice. Thanks. I made it out of a pair of glasses. Sharpened it on the asphalt, then I wrapped one of my socks around it for a handle. You could stab all day and not get a blister. I hoped Karma would understand. I had no choice but to give Glen that shiv.</i> Lockdown! She didn't. After Glen stabbed me, I realized two things...</i> UntiI I did my list item right, Karma wasn't going to let me be invisible...</i> and prison health care sucks. Okay, you're done. There may be some shiv left in the bone, if your arm turns black, tell a guard. That was quite a shiv. Thank you. Wow, that Glen's got the worst luck. Excuse me? Every year when he's up for parole, somebody pisses him off and he breaks one of the big seven. The big seven? Things that keep you from getting out: Stabbing, burning, biting, strangling, eye gouging, scalping and taking a poop in the urinal. Wait, so he messes up right before parole every time? Why would he do that? You know what I figured out about prison? There are a lot of guys in here without clearly thought-out plans. Glen didn't want to get out of prison, and I wanted to know why. And finally, after hours of wandering, a fat guy walked by the hot box so I could ask.</i> Hey, Glen. You got a minute? What the hell do you want?! Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush, Glen. I think you've been blowing your parole on purpose, and I want to know why. Look, just hear me out before you kill me. So I took the plunge and did what I should have done the first time I saw Glen...</i> I told him all about my list, and how he was on it. And how, if I was going to be right with Karma,</i> I had to do something better than a shiv to make it up to him.</i> You really got a list of bad things you make up for? I even helped a whole town of circus freaks. Damn it. I'm not supposed to call them "freaks". "Irregular-Americans." I don't give a sand-covered cat's crap if you know. - I'm blowing parole. - Why? Because life on the outside ain't no good for me no more. Glen told me how when he first got into juvie</i> he was so worried about surviving, he changed the way he was and did things to make himself look as tough as he could.</i> Like getting tattoos before he even knew what cuss words were.</i> And after years of changing himself, he was so believable as a badass, it's how people on the outside saw him, too.</i> Can I help you? I'm looking for a job. Please don't hurt me. I don't want to die. My pin number's 8-4-3-2. Even when he was doing something good like going back to the liquor store to tell them how they'd given him too much change,</i> people still judged him on how he looked.</i> It didn't take long before a badass criminal</i> was the only way Glen saw himself. So that's how he acted. Every time he got out, he'd take one look at himself and do the same thing.</i> Again, and again, and again. Until he decided to stop wasting everyone's time</i> and just stay in prison. My God, Glen, I feel terrible. All this stuff is my fault. It's my fault you got locked up, and it's my fault you're afraid to get out. I'm afraid of no man! Afraid to get out. I said afraid to get out. Oh, yeah, well, that's true. The next day Glen got out of the box, and I had a chance to tell him</i> I wanted to do something to help him live on the outside again.</i> I want to do something to help you live on the outside again. That'd be cool. Something big. I mean... I practically took your life. I always wanted to go to Mars. Smaller, something smaller. I'm out of stamps. Okay, something between stamps and Mars. Something important to you. Maybe something you cared about before you became a criminal. I know. My Camden Scout badges. Camden Scout badges? How's that going to help you? If I hadn't gone to juvie, I would have been the first kid in Camden to get a... an honor sash. I was only two badges away. God, I miss being a Camden Scout. My neckerchief fluttering in the morning breeze. Sneaking upstairs during meetings to smell the scoutmaster's daughter's shoes. The knots, Earl. The knots I could tie. It was the second time Glen asked me to do something for him.</i> But from the look in his eyes, I knew it was the first time I was going to do it right.</i> All right, I'm in. Where do we start? I need my archeology badge. We could dig in the west yard. Just have talk to those guys over there. They control it. The albinos? And I need my natural science badge. That's bug collecting. That should be easy. The barracks are... most of them are infested. Just got to make deals with the gangs that control them. Looking around that yard, I knew I was in trouble.</i> Not only was I going to lose my last bit of invisibility,</i> I was going to have to make deals with the most dangerous people in the place.</i> If Karma was planning on killing me, I was hoping she'd so it quick.</i> I was about to go against everything Sonny had taught me.</i> Owing favors would make you the most visible you could become,</i> And I was about to owe a lot of them. - Excuse me. - What do you want, Hawaiian Tropics? I'm helping a guy get his archeology badge for Camden Scouts. Nerd. Yeah, anyway, we need someplace to dig, and I hear this is the best spot. So I guess what I'm saying is... I need a favor. We want umbrellas. Eight of them. While I was putting my faith in Karma to keep me safe,</i> Joy was putting her faith in a different power, tough love.</i> He's gotta learn to think on his own, make his own choices. Tough love, Darnell, tough love. Joy had a lot of faults, but she did have a natural gift for teaching.</i> And while Randy may have been a slow learner,</i> Joy kept after him... teaching him things he should have learned a long time ago,</i> like the clothes you find in the gutter might be free,</i> but, well, they're probably not disease free.</i> Or how to make his brain and his belly communicate better.</i> I'll have the chicken. No, wait... the crab claws. How's the tuna salad? Not as good as the chicken salad, but better than getting smacked in the neck with a big-ass rubber band. Choose, dummy! God... think for yourself. Take the crab claws. I'll have what the puppet's having. And eventually all that pain turned into some gain.</i> You stopped! Did you do that on purpose or on accident? Don't you lie to me. On purpose. My brain told my feet to stop and they did. My brain never been smarter than my feet before. I'm proud of you, Randy. Now if we can stop walking around with your brother's shirt like a giant-headed, hillbilly Linus, you'll be fixed. I was having success, too. Although I knew every deal I made was another favor I owed.</i> I need some spoons to dig with. - Escape? - Archeology. I don't know that word. But you know spoons though, right? Okay, you got it, but I need a favor. I want you to get everyone out of this prison for an entire day so I can have this place to myself. Okay, I'll work on that. And, with every favor I asked, I felt a little less safe. I'm going to need some brushes to clean off whatever we find when we dig for archeology. You got it. But I'm going to need you to take care of my dog Simon. And if you lose him, I'll kill you. And every favor I asked meant another scary prisoner knew I existed. So far, we've already collected lice and hookworms. Word on the yard is, you have maggots. Yeah, but they're cleaning the dead flesh out of my back wound. So you can take 'em, but then you got to clean the dead flesh out of my back wound. Pretty soon we had everything we need. For his archeology badge, we stumbled on the spot where, in the old days,</i> the guards played a game they called "kick the prisoner in the face. "</i> Save the molars. We could use them to make dice. For his natural science badge, we'd collect lice, hookworms and maggots.</i> All we needed now were some roaches. Okay, hit it. Okay, light's on. And the thing I thought would be the hardest</i> turned out to be the easiest. Excuse me. For those of you who don't know me yet I'm helping a guy get some badges. Does anyone here happen to be a scoutmaster? And just like that, Glen got his last two badges</i> and was finally awarded his honor sash. And when the parole board heard hat a change he'd made in himself,</i> they finally gave him his parole. And Glen was happy to be out. But while people were no longer afraid of him,</i> they still judged him by the way he looked.</i> Check out this dude in the scout uniform. Be prepared... to never get laid. Glen thought about going back to his old stealing ways...</i> but for the first time, the way other people saw him didn't matter as much.</i> What mattered was how he saw himself. Prison debts are bad, so it was nice knowing I had paid mine to Glen.</i> It would have been nicer if there weren't a ton of other convicts I owed favors to now.</i> Yeah, I know, I know. I got to get everybody out of here for a day. I'm trying to organize a huge field trip to the Aquarium. They haven't called me back. You got rid of Glen. That's a start, right? One guy down, 1,200 to go? Don't worry about it. That Glen was causing all those stupid lockdowns. Making me crazier than my mom before I chopped her up. Anyway... thanks for getting him out of here. You don't owe me anything. Man, thanks for the peace and quiet. You don't have to keep taking care of Simon. We're square. Aren't you going to give him back to me? Oh, right. You're so big. What's that man been feeding you? The next two years were going to be hard,</i> but now I knew I couldn't survive them by doing the same thing Glen had...</i> letting prison turn me into someone I wouldn't recognize.</i> I realized that no matter how scared I get,</i> if I'm going to survive in prison I have to do it as myself.
