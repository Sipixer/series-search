r comes out. Since the riots of last year they left here us to rot. They figured we would just destourselves, but instead we've thrived. How about we work together,you know,help each other out? You're on your own. akGet me out of this! Yowant tYoknow ere she is,find a way to get me out of this! Mauz..Mari. We can assist you should you ever decide, say,to break out of here. This conversation's over. We'rtrying to dohis the easy way Think you can do me a favor? We have a lot to discuss,Lincoln. Specifically,your b,. b How are wew ing with the transfer? You got to stay. What are you talking about? Dad,I'm so sorry. They got me and Sara. You got a week to find this Whistler guy. Otherwise,they,uh,both die. Where you from up there,bro? Chicago. Michael Jordan. Yeah. You meet him? It's a big city. Oh,yeah,big city. Thanks for saving me a spot. Hey! Ejected! You ever have sex with blond cheerleader? Yeah,sure. You're the man,bro. How long's the water been out? Since riots last year. Government blame us. They say,"Screw you,you break it." No water. Gracias. Real quick. There's an inmate here named James Whistler. I'm looking for him. Welcome to club. Everybody looking for him. Why's that? He killed the mayor of Panama City's son. In bar fight. Mayor not happy. Hey,hey. So where is he now? Disappear. Some say he might even escape. Hey. Hey! "I don't have no money. I don't have no money," that's all I hear from you, you know that? But then I see you with this,huh? Life must be good,eh? Look,I'm-I'm hungry,okay? You worry about me being hungry. Hey,hey,hey,hey,come on. Come on! But you eat all the time. Okay,I can see you up there. Hequilo! There's gonna be more water. When?! I said there will be more water. Later,bro. Go. Spare a little? I need some information. Absolutely. You slipped this note in my pocket yesterday. Why? My memory's a little foggy on account of this thirst. Yeah,it's starting to come back to me now. A little more agua there. The note. This guy gave me some rat meat in exchange for putting that in your pocket and the pocket of the guy you were set to fight. Why? He's nuts,that's why. Anybody who can live down in those sewers doesn't have all his faculties. Where in the sewers? Whistler! Whistler. My name is Michael Scofield. I was sent to get you out of here. I'm going to assume they told you I was coming. Or that someone was coming. Whistler. Last chance. I'm not coming down here again. You're here to get me out of Sona. Are you surprised? It's just that it's gonna be a bit difficult getting me out of this hole. Seeing as if I go above ground and another inmate spots me, I'm a dead man. -TThere's a,there's a slight misunderstanding that I have with the mayor... You know what? It's none of my business. I'll come back and get you when the time is right. I may not make it that long. That's your problem,my friend. I've got problems of my own. So you work for these people? The ones that want me out of Sona. Lookjust stay put. As loI'll be back.knows you're here,y Why do they want me out of here so badlyso can you at least tell me that? Is this the part where you etend re innocent? Just a pawn in all this? If they told you anything about me before you came here, you'd know that to be true. I just want to know what they want with me. Stay put. In an effort to save some time,I'm gonna have to insist that we just skip right past all the threats I know you're prepared to layout. Should anything happen to Sara to LJ, you will scour the Earth and hunte down and rip my heart from my chest and bup,bup,bup. I absolutely know how you feel, as would I,okay? So that's done. On to business. Did you brother get the message? Good. You and I will meet here every day. I'll want a full report of the prior day's progress. When I call your cell phone,answer. Don't ask me stupid questions. Don't waste my time. Get a plan together. Execute it. LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler. Are we clear? I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive. OX Fine. I can do that,next. Why us? I'll answer that question so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work. There's a political spotlight on Whistler due to the nature of his crime. Ras,bribes,what have you, are not an option. We have to go in through  door,so to speak. This can't be done in a week. You have a week. That's it. Are we clear? What's your name? Susan B. Anthony. I'm assuming you weren't born by immaculate conception. You're right,Lincoln. Family trees being what they are, moms,dads,brothers,sisters. Anything happens to my son or Sara, I'm not coming after you,Susan. Get to work. His man knocks over the water! Now,didn't you see how Lechero just walked away?! He doesn't care about us! He doesn't give a damn! Living like a king up there! (speaking gibberish) Come out,what are you,afraid?! Come on! Lechero,come out! Por favor. Por favor. Vete. Vete,perro. Why you so interested about that guy down there? No reason. Then why you whispering,college boy? Why don't you lower your voice already? What's in it for me? I'm sorry. Do you have any other friends in here besides me? I'm it. Friends don't t friends go hungry and thirsty All right. All right. and damn near half-naked. I said "all right;" I'll take care of it! When? When I can. What's the big deal? Why's he hiding? Who's he hiding from? Mayor get message to Lechero saying if Whistler guy gets killed here in Sona, whoever kills him gets to go to court, gets to see a judge. Judge friendly with mayor. Kill him,and-and then you get to get out of here and be free? That's what Lechero say. This'll stay between me and you. If your friend wanted you to know,why didn't he tell you? 'Cause... 'cause you and I are friends now. Unless you want to be enemies. Fries. Good. Me,too. Sucre? Sucre,get me out of here,please. Where's Maricruz? Yeah. Yeah,Maricruz-- she's good,she's okay, but-but I'm not telling you anything until you get me out of here. Tell me where she is right now! You shoot me,you'll end up inside this hellhole. WA I'm done. I don't care anymore. I can only guess she's dead by now, so you're dying with her. (gun cocks) I never had her! At that house in Mexico, I chased your aunt and Maricruz off. I told them I'd lock 'em up for accessory if they didn't hightail it. I swear to God. And the crucifix? I ripped it off Maricruz before she ran. There was no phone in that dump,so I knew you wouldn't be able to call from t road to... to make sure I wasn't lying. I-I conned you. So... She's picking grapes. I have no idea. Now,just lower the barrel. Put the gun down. Now,I came clean with you and helped you out, right,buddy? Soou got to return the favor. Call my mom in Joliet-- Edna Bellick. She's listed. Sucre? I never la a hand on Maricruz. I would never do that! Sucre,help me,please! Sucre,help me! Help me! Hey. Hey. You find Whistler? Yeah. What's his story? I don't know,and maybe it's better that way,huh? I just got to get him out of here,right? Come on,man,come on. We got to keep moving,we got to keep moving. What's the next play? Whistler got a note out on a dead body yesterday. I don't know what it means or who it's for. But we need all the leverage we can get, and,uh... I need some money. ne'sver brok out leale wi a  thisweeko pl i so... u tell theseple,veit is thatook Sara and  nhew... you tellm I get it, and m going  do everytng I can. I'm going to break this guy out of here, or I'm going to die trying. And if it's the latter, then that should count for something,rightg, That's got to count for something. You tell them that. I will. Tell them. I'd trade places with you in a second. I know. Whistler? You're not safe here. I can take you someplace that is. Fhmhm Sucre? Linc! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Michael's locked up. For what? I don't know. I'm sorting it through. (sighs) I could use your help. We're in a... we're in a bad spot. UhI feel for you, man, b I to my cousin Peteye Mariuz.I st talked d he told me e's back or in Chicago. Hey, youe still wanted in Chicago, remember? I'll figure meing out. All right.
