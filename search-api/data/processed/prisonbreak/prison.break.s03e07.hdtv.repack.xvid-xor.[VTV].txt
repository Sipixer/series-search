This man... this man is no friend of mine! What happened to your girlfriend has nothing... Her name was Sara! And she was a good person. And she'd still be alive if it wasn't for you. So it's revenge, eh, b? An eye for an eye? Once you make such a declaration there's no going back. There's nothing to go back to. Good. Then we have a fight. Now, both of you, go and assign your belongings, and pray to whatever god is yours. Come back here in 15 minutes. Fight, fight, fight, fight... fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight fight... You need anymore help? You've done more than enough. Here, take that, man. It's not a lot, but it's enough to get you started. Oh, no, no, I can't take this. I did this because I wanted to help you guys. Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket, do whatever, just get out of here. Thanks. I'm going to get so gas, okay? I'll meet you in the front. All right. Good luck. You too. Is she coming with you to do the exchange? Yeah. You think that's a good idea? I mean, what if something goes wrong and she gets hurt? I need some incentive just in case Whistler doesn't want to go quietly. You think any of this is going to go down quiet? They're just going to give you LJ just like that? Doesn't matter what I think. I know what these people are capable of. I'm not going to gamble with my son's life. Maybe you don't have to. Alex. Alex. Yeah. We'll be arriving at the courthouse in about 15 minutes. Then the hearing will begin shortly. All and all this whole thing will be done within the hour. Good. That sounds good. So with this deal... what specifically are they expecting from me? They need to knoeverything. About the President, about the company. They want to confirm that you have viable incriminating information and that you can be a cooperative witness. If I cooperate fully... I won't just be incriminating them. You're worried about all those skeletons in your closet, but you have full immunity. Everything will be fine. All you have to do is tell the truth. Stay calm. Better knuckle up. Look, I don't know what you're thinking, but killing me is not going to solve your problem. Relax. I'm not going to kill you. Then what the hell was all that about?! You want to make it out of here without being seen, you need a diversion. Now we have one. You're off your head. Do you know that? They're waiting... We don't have time for this. It's almost 3:00, and that means the tower guard should be drugged by now. At 3:13, the sun's going to hit the other guard tower. We'll have the cover we need. It's now or never. Listen, Michael, I, uh... I meant what I said about Sara. If I were you I wouldn'tention that name again. We're getting out of here now, and then I'm trading you for my nephew. And then I'm going to find out who's responsible for taking her life... and I'm taking theirs. Listen, Scofield... Not now. I just... please. I heard you out there in the yard. Is that true about Sara? Yes. That's not... I mean it's... What'd she...? I'm sorry, Michael. I mean it. She was a good person. I'm sorry. Is something wrong? If anyone asks, just tell them your fuel pump's leaking, all right? No, no, no, I'm going to the beach with you. No. I need you to keep a lookout. When they get here I'll call you, all right? If everything works out today, you and me-- we're both going to get what we want. Stay here. Sorry about that. That's okay. I know you're just doing your job. I bet you're as ready for this t over with as I am. Hey, you know, once we get out of Panama, me and my dad and my uncle we're going to open up a scuba shop somewhere. Build a house on the beach... Lovely. go swimming every day. I never lived by the ocean... You can stop. I always wanted to, you know? I get it. You're a human being wi dreams, plans for the future, all that. Whether you see it isn't up to me anymore. It's in your uncle's hands now. So let's just hope that he does his job. What are you waiting for? Where's Mahone? He's gone. What, just like that? Why? I mean, how? How about we worry a little bit more about us, huh? You know, he got out of here kind of suddenly. How do we know he's not ratting us out right now? Sullins. When did this happen? Are you sure? Yeah. I'll handle it. Something wrong? A couple of the Panamanians might have gotten cold feet. Exactly how cold? They just need some convincing. It's nothing to worry about. It's all gonna work out. Meantime, we're gonna take you to a hotel room. Up until an hour ago, this was a done deal. So... what's happening? Relax. This is still your best bet. Unless someone's offering you a "get out of Sona free" card. Now, remember, we'll only have four minutes of cover, so once you hit the ground you run straight to the fence. Don't look up, don't look back, don't say a word. What if they see us? If someone yells stop, you stop. That's it? That's it. It's time. Where's Sammy? I dont know, Patron So, who goes first? Right now my life isn't worth a damn without yours. If this doesn't go as planned, the first guy through that window's gonna get shot. That guy can't be you. I'll go. I got it. Come on, come on, come on. This is it. Five... four... three... two... one. The glare. Where's the glare? I don't know. Come on This is it. Someone's coming. Good luck. You, too. We're losing the light. Go back.  Go back! Go back! Come on! Come on! That was our only chance. Damn it! Find out where they are. Do you hear 'em out there? They're waiting for us. It's only a matter of time. I know. Come on. The damn thing's not coming off! Hey, gringos! Come out and play. Come on! Come on! Nowhere to hide, malditos! Gringos! Come out and play! We've got to go. They can't find us here. But what about this? Stash it! Come on! Come on! . Go. Where are you off to, Backra? Where you boys been? The bathroom? This has all been a terrible mistake. Has it been? We've, uh, we've worked it out. There's no need to take this any further. You clearly don't understand I can't have your foolishness spread in this place. I gave you every chance to pull out. Please. We know the rules! Two men go in, one man comes out! Now, this quarrel must be settled. Let's go. Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What are you gentlemen waiting for? You two don't make this more interesting, I will. Sorry, mate-- if only one of us is getting out... How's it look? They got LJ in the back of the van. He seem all right to you? Yeah, I think so. All right, how many people they got? She's got a driver and a bodyguard-- that's it. All right. You know I appreciate you hanging around, man Hey, we started this together, bro. Let's finish it that way. Come on, Michael. Where are you? What you doing here? You're supposed to be keeping watch. Just checking, making sure everything is all right. They're running a bit late, that's all. So, what's the plan? You gonna swim out, wait for the police to pass, and... meet with a boat somewhere? Something like that. And then what? You know what, you need to get back to the car... Don't move. I'm impressed. You've actually got the guts to look me in the eye as you stab me in the back. What are you going to do, shoot me? Don't. I can't let you hand over James to those people. You need to think about what you're doing. I have! Every since you told me what they did to Sara. When they get here, James and I, we're leaving. Where to? I don't know. Somewhere they won't find us. So, this whole time, you played me. Like you've been playing me. Bringing me here to be your lookout? But it's okay. We were both here doing what we had to for the people we love. You do this, you may as well be shooting my son yourself. I'm sorry. They should be out by now. Any sign? All quiet. How much longer do youant to give them? I know you wanted to live by an ocean your whole life. Sad to think the closest you'll get is being buried under one. You're not gonna kill me. Oh? You need me. You already killed Sara. Anything happens to me, you're out of bargaining chips. If Michael doesn't get Whistler out today, I won't need to bargain anymore. You'll all be dead. Hurtdo? Hurtdo?Where you at? Hey,Roldan. Better send someone to check on Hurtado in Tower One. He is not answering his radio and I don't have a visual. Confirmed. We'll send a couple men over. Kick him in the junk, Scofield! What are you looking for, boy! There are no draws here! If this isn't finished by one of you, I'm coming down to finish both of you. Hurtdo? What are you doing over there? What, are you sleeping on the job? No, I don't know what happened. End it. God! God forgive me. They should have been here by now. Maybe they get out. They should be on their way. They didn't make it. So what do we do now? I don't care what you do, but I'm taking the car. What? What the hell's going on? Put your hands up on your head! You come down here. Now! We are going to find out who is behind this. What? Were you going to let me know what the hell's going on? Lincoln? I'm here. Good. Where are they? They're in the car with me. I heard the alarm. They were long gone before that thing went off. Well, if they had such a head start, why are you so far behind? Listen, do you want me to talk to your drive? I want you to put Whistler on the phone. What? Put him on. He's in the trunk. But, if you feel that strongly about it, I can pull over and you two can have a Nice little talk. If we're real lucky, maybe some cops will swing by. I'm sure they'd like a word, too. You know what? Just get LJ ready. Whoever tried to escape assaulted one of my men. And, as you know, any attempt on the life of a Panamanian soldier warrants the death penalty. This attempt was made from cell #212. And if memory serves, that cell belongs to members of your crew, no? You. You are one of the Milkman's boys. Is it your cell? I'm going to take that as a yes. I thought we were compadres, you and I. I let you run your business, have your whores. When you asked me for your own per Sona l supply of water when the lumbing went down, did I not provide it? When you asked me to get rid of the phones, make them contraband, so you could control the trade in here, did I not comply? I do all this for you. And in exchange, you were to do one thing for me. Keep these men in line! Maybe we just backed the wrong horse. Perhaps there is another in here better suited for the job. Good luck, Bredda. You know none of us tried to break out of that cell. I do. Then you must know there's only one guy here foolish enough to try. Nice to see you back in form. Thanks. Any news from Sullins? He's working on it. It doesn't matter what people say. What do they say? You know people, how they talk. About? The men, the ones they say you killed. Is it true? Because, if it is, you can talk to about it. Is that a fact? Yes. You can trust me. So let me get this straight. Sullins sends you to be good cop? That's not what this is. There never was a deal, was there? Sullins just wants me to confess so hcan bring me up on more charges back in the States. The deal is legit. The hearing was supposed to be an hour after we left the prison, and I'm still waiting. So why don't you just come clean, Felicia, huh? For old times' sake? How about it? How about you do me the same courtesy, Alex? I'm not blind. My brother was a user. I can smell the stuff a mile away. Don't you accuse me of being the one who's hiding something. Hey, I just got confirmation from the radio. The guards took a head count and they secured the perimeter. No one made it out of there today. Sucre, what's going on? Looks like they're packing up. Whatever you do don't let them take LJ, all right? Linc? Linc? Sucre? Get the hell out of here now. Look out! Dad! Let her go Drop it or I swear to God I'll put a bullet in her head! Now you let him go! You let him go now! Dad! LJ, I'm going to get you out of this, I promise. You sure you want to make promises to your son you can't keep? Watch your mouth. I'll let you in on a little secret. When you choose this line of work, you know it's all going to come down to a moment like this. So kill me. Let him go. Let him go! Kill him. Kill him. Dad! It doesn't matter what you do to me. The operation failed. So put your gun down, Linc. Kill him. Dad! No! No Give me one more shot. To do what? Let me find out what happened in Sona. Let me talk to Michael. We can still get Whistler. We can make this happen. We can make this happen. We... We can do this. Put him in the van. Sucre! You all right? What happened? Body bags. Look, what happened out there... Happened out there. It's over. All right then. Right, just so you know, I wouldn't have gone through with it. Lucky for us, we'll never have to find out. So what do we do now? You know where are you, boy? Well, I'm no doctor, You but I'm just guessingboy. your mother had a little bit too much to drink one night Keep talking and you're going to be next. How you want it, brother? Fast or slow? ke to handle this one myself. Do you have children, Mr. Scofield? Maybe someday. That's very optimistic for a man in your position. Myself, I have five. Three boys, two girls. Now I used to tell them a story-- I believe in your country they call it, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." You know it? Well, then you know the moral of that story is even when liars tell the truth, they can never be believed. But your life's on the line, boy. Are you trying to break out of this prison, Mr. Scofield? No. Are you trying to break out of this prison? We both know that's not possible. Answer me! What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me the truth. I want to hear it. You want a reason to kill me. No, boy... I have good reason to kill you. Because of you, it's no longer possible for me to effectively govern this prison. Justified or not, the men no longer ha faith in me. That leaves only one thing for me to do to guarantee my survival. You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield. And you're taking me with you. Well, I've got some good news and I've got some better news. Let's start with the good. Panamanians are back on board. And the better news? You're going to get to have a really Nice sleep on that bed. I thought that I... After the hearing I was going to be on a plane back to the U.S. You said... I did, and you will be, but it's just too late to do the hearing now. We'll get to it first thing tomorrow. Tomorrow morning? Sounds about right. Please... is there something, is there anything that we can do to help speed things up? When a genie grants you a wish you don't really tell him to make it snappy. This hearing needs to happen today. The hearing needs... needs to happen right now! Listen to you. You know, you are unbelievable. I have dropped everything to come down her and drag your sorry ass out of that hellhole... You don't understand. I've made you a deal. I can't... I can't wait. I can't wait. You know, I am so glad I have made this trip to help your esteemed colleague. I am just tickled. Cuff him. Is that necessary? Cuff him. I'm sorry. I can't wait. Hey, have you seen Whistler? No. I spent my whole career trying to keep bad people behind bars. Like somehow by doing my job I was making the world a better place. And then... then you hear about what happened to someone like Sara. Damn if it doesn't seem like there's more bad people out there than in here. I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed. If I give them more time now, I may as well hand them a condom and a cigarette to go with it. You know, I came all the way down here. The least you could do is offer me an opinion. I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here. And I thought you needed to be out in seven days. I need to know how this delay is going to affect things. Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible. Oh, well, thank you, James, but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence. And what would? Your ass on a plane. Four more days. If I'm out of here by then, I can still do it. Trust me. It'll be fine. I'll let the brothers know. Gretchen.
