I want an update. Still no sign of them. nothing on the coast. I think they may have gone back into the jungle. The jungle? you asked me to send men to the beach! Capitan... Just a moment, general. General, I think we have to call the coast guard. Come on! You all right? My legs are starting to cramp. You gotta hold on, buddy. We're not gonna last out here too long, Michael. Where's your friend, Michael? Sucre's not just gonna abandon us out here, all right? He'll show, he'll show. The coast guard is launching four vessels... They've been in the water this whole time. They're probably at the bottom of the ocean by now. Well, look it here! A drunk and disorderlyke we warrant for jorge rivera.han Failure to pay child support. You're not going anywhere. Once we're done processing you, then you can go. Until then, sit tight. I should have heard something by now. I've lost all damn track of them.

People might die because of this. Take off your pants. Excuse me, ser? I said take off your pants. If I knew you boys partied in Sona like this, I never would have tried to escape. One cell phone. One wallet. And some change. There were some papers. A boat-rental agreement. I need them. I'll check the drawer. Take them down. Come on, now, hombre. There's no need to refry my beans.
