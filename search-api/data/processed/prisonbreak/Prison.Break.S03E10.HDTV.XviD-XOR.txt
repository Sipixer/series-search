You gonna do this or not? Yes, but once we're out, I consider you collateral. Lincoln causes as many Problems as he solves. He needs to get out of his own way, and I think You can assist him. I stay one step ahead, And you get 50 grand. What happened? She came up to me just like you said And offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back. So we stick to the plan, right? Yeah. cool. I found a passport. who's Gary Miller? I've been working on a way for us to be together. James, how-how can I believe you? Hocan I believe anything anymore? We got a way out of this? We need some kind of support brace for thtunnel. Or what? or the whole thing collapses, and we're buried alive. No more excuses. Papa's dead because of this yankee. I'll kill him myself if I have to, all right? He survived the box. So what? The guards went after Scofield. Scofield won. He's a folk hero now. Look, I want Scofield dead as much as you, But not at the cost of an uprising. Mail call. Who's that? That's my son. Bagwell gave the okay. the coast is clear. We gotta go. I didn't think I'd see you again. Once someone goes into the box, it's... It was a misunderstanding. They wanted to talk to you about the helicopters, right? What helicopters? Were you really trying to escape? I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you. Just so you know, Bagwell's coming with us. You were gone. He had something we needed. I didn't have a choice. Fine. So what's the new plan? Did you tell him? Yeah. I am coming with you. Okay by me. Everyone hear that? you hear that, lawman? But you're staying up here. Maybe I didn't enunciate myself. The work downstairs requires two hands. Hey. we need somebody to stay outside in case Sammy returns. I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff. The bracing's gonna be tricky. Unless the tunnel gets the proper support, It's all going to come down on our heads. We should have the materials for the braces, But we'll need a a saw to cut tto size. and a hammer. Can you help us out? Yeah. I can do that. Two days. And if not? Two days. Guillermo should have everything we need. You know where he is, right? I think it's, uh... It's down this corridor on the left. Halfway down. cell 40. Down the corridor on the left. Cell 40. okeydoke. Are you lost already, Teodoro? No. But you are. This is my room now. You're done in here. If you had gone after Scofield today, All would have been forgiven. This is suicide. Shut up, old man! I'll take my chances. You think you can run sona? You couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other, But I still keep you by my side. I'll let you walk out of here Out of respect for what you were. Come on! Get the hell out of here! All of you ready to do this? Until Lechero gets back, We should start looking for pieces About four feet in length. I'm running things now! Anyone got problem with that... ...come get it! Good. First order of business, A case of rum to the man who brings me Michael Scofield! Don't worry. We'll be there with all the cash. Okay? gracias. Osberto. that's who you want to talk to. This guy on the up-and-up? The guy I was running things into sona for arranged this, So it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal. so, yes. Osberto doesn't speak english, though, So how do you want to work it? I need to meet with Susan. I'll take Sofia. she can translate for me. Don't worry about it. So when I meet with Susan, what do you want me to tell her? Tell her whatever you think she wants to hear. Just buy us enough time to do our thing, all right? Home stretch, papi. Listen, man. I want to thank you for everything. Oh, linc, please. when we get home, I got your back-- Whatever you need, whatever you want. That won't be necessary. When I'm back home, I'm a saint. I'm not even jaywalking. Osberto. don't forget. Osberto. Scofield steps outside that tunnel, he's a dead man. Far as I can tell, we have two options. We can invite Sammy on the escape... He can go to hell. Which brings us to option number two. You wouldn't last a second in there with Sammy. Would you? Then I guess we'll just have to outsource. I felt sorry for the guy, But you don't chicken-foot an ex-delta force And expect to make it out alive. You're delta force? like Chuck Norris? Norris? he wouldn't have made it through boot camp. Excuse me a second. I see you're making friends. Hey, once you get the hang of it, This place ain't so rough. Yeah. too bad. Too bad what? You were right. we got A little plan going on. but, you know, if you're putting down roots... No, no. you were saying...? We're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours. Not through Scofield. You heard the town crier. College boy's life is barely worth a case of booze. Hence our current conversation. I know how you got your cherry yesterday, Daubing your wraps in acetone, Smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes. You do the same thing to Sammy, and you're in. Chicken-foot Sammy? Chicken-foot Sammy. It's all riding on you, champ. Here you get it. Thank you. This shouldn't take long. What are you getting? Supplies. for? I don't want to get caught flat-footed again. You know no.what that means? Well, these people obviously have a plan. We're gonna need one, too. Does that plan include screwing over James? Is it James or gary Miller? Whatever his name is, there's a part of me That doesn't want to believe he works for them... Cause he's The man I loved, The man who went to prison for me, The man who was going to take me to my first trip to paris. I haven't turned my back to that man. Do I have your word that he's gonna be all right? Yeah. now get in. Do I have your word?! Yeah, you got my word. Now get in. Ed, we'll be in contact soon. Sales are through the roof! Hope you're working on your putting...Gary You know what st found out? That "Sucre" means "sugar." Yeah. So every time I say your name, I'm calling you "sugar." Basically. I like that. Look, I don't have a lot of information. Which, I guess, that's good ws for you, right? You care to elaborate? Lincoln isn't cooking anything up. He's still planning on exchanging Whistler for lj. He hasn't been talking about running any games. And did he become an eagle scout last night, too? Lady, he got the message. he knows he doest have A choice, he has to play it straight. Look, I could have come up here and made something up Just to get paid, but... I'm not trying to get on your bad side either. You know what? I believe you. So, I'll call you if anything comes up. Whoa, whoa! what am i, a toothless crack whore? Sit down. I keep my promises. The people I work for, they don't like To deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky. Cashier's check payable to cash. same thing. Half now and half when you're done. Keep your ears open, sugar. Alex, come on! Hold it steady! I am! I am! I'm gonna need a little help here! Come on. I got it. I said I got it. Thittle piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight? All right, Let go, let go. So, how many more are we gonna need Before we get to the top? 20 maybe. That gets us to no-man's land. then what? Helicopter'd be nice. I was supposed to kill you. Oh, so you're not a fisherman? They threatened to come after my family If I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter, But I didn't. I'm so grateful. So what happened to your family? I don't know. maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here. Well, it's a crazy world, isn't it? We all agreen that. And we have a lot of work to do. Where the hell is Lechero? Is everything set? huh? Is everything set? Yeah, noblemo. Excuse me, sir. Do we come to you if we need the chicken foot? Tiger pants. Who you got a beef with? I don't know his name. some caribbean guy. Stole my wallet a while back. Better think long and hard Before you say another word, eh? He's got this fruity little mustache And this ly-ass vest. Please, I'm beggin' ya. In the ring. 15 minutes. I never thought I'd say this, But I envy you, Brad. I've wanted To shank that little calypso kid Ever since I first met him. I'm not a violent guy by nature, But if a man makes me walk around in my grunts for two days... Yeah, that's great. just don't take too long to finish him off, okay? The sooner he's dead, the sooner we can get on the escape. No games. I'm in. You're in. No, no, no. what's wrong? We got to call off the fight. No, that's an impossibility. No, no, no, You don't understand! There's got to be more acetone around here. No, that's it! I can't go against Sammy straight up! I'm a dead man! If you don't kill him, we are all dead. This isn't the best neighborhood. I've been in a lot worse. Just stick close. Osberto? Si. You want to do this? iene el dinero? Yeah, yeah, I got it. onde esta? "where is the money?" I want to see the product. Primero el dinero. "money first." Show me the stuff. El dinero! Lincoln, please, let's get out of here. Tell him to stop wasting my time. No. Tell him. Oh, my god! Big? it's grande? Si. Ask him how do I trigger it by remote. Boom. "dial one-one, send." One-one, send? Adios. Adios. Buena suerte. Why didn't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb? You never d have come otherwise. We need that saw. You know, uh, I am a fisherman. I am. I'm just maybe A little bit more connected than I've let on. I think this is gonna work. Yeah. You know, I run charters, just like I said... I have for years. Then one day, that brunette, Gretchen well, she asked me If I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation, right? And, uh, well, with the money she was offering, I had a pretty good idea she wasn't Just trawling for salmon. So you two have history. Yeah. and she's Been an absolute nightmare in my life Ever since that first job. Alex, I need a wedge. Wedge. Look, I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em. I have to figure outhese coordinates And I have to take them back there. Quit embarrassing yourself. What? We're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up. This? No. all right, good. you work for the company. And when you break out of here, you're gonna do whatever The company asks you to do, Period. well, they're using me Just like they're g you. Good, I'm glad you shared that with me. So why don't we go back to work? how's that sound? Let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want, huh? But if one of them tries to use it on us... You don't have to fight that guy. It's my farewell tour. The rest of those pieces are no good. We're going to need those tools, Michael. I guess we'll just have to wait. That book of yours-- it's just a bunch Of coordinates in there, right? Among other things. So you wouldn't mind. It's just a bunch of, uh, numbers and dates. "gate." Gate netting company. That's where I rent my trammels. "stampede." That's my buddy's cape islander. And this is important to us how? It's important because I'm being accused Of being someone I'm not. and I don't want Scofield ditching me Once it's time to leave... he's not ditching anybody. If he could have gotten rid of anybody, He would have gotten rid of me. And if he tries to leave the city He knows that we're gonna turn him in before he gets out Of the city. I'm going upstairs to find Lechero and his equipment. I'm with Alex. Do you mind? Sounds like someone's up there. If Lechero gets stranded up there, We're not getting out of here. So when you think it's safe, Or it feels like It's safe, we got to go, we got to go up. We've been talking about chickenfooting Sammy for months. No one had the courage. Do you have any paint thinner? Paint thinner? Shoe polish, Lighter fluid, glue? There you are, champ. It's time. stomp his face, Brad! You know, this has all been one big misunderstanding. I wasn't talking about Sammy. It was... that's him. That's the guy I was talking about. Yeah, I don't see no "fruity moustache," And where's his "ugly-ass vest," Brad? Don't worry, you stand a real chance of winning this one. You cannot just hide out all day. What else can I do, huh? I've ruledhese men for a year with blood. You don't think those men want to take the head of the man Who wore the crown? be that as it may, Bellick is about to lose his head to Sammy. You may not want to hear this, But once that happens, we are both very much Aware that Scofield is gonna start Getting curious about where the hell you are. He's going to come crawling out of his hole And right into Sammy's arms, And then he and our escape Are gone forever. Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick... Wait. we get the tools and we come straight back. Come on Hey. You guys want to watch the fight? You know, chill out. I'll get you a beer. You like that? You like that? Stop it. Scofield! Scofield's in there. It's locked. open the door. I don't have the combination. I said... Open it now. Do it. We can't. We can't. Open it now. I don't have the combination. I've got your man out here. If you don't open the door, He's the one who's going to pay the price. I need him alive! You saw those guys. what do you think they've got planned? All of you is trying my patience. What do you suggest, Alex? Let's be ready for them. Time's up. You want another one? Then you better be persuasive. Michael. Don't open the door! He's got a gu...! Are you going to tell me what it's for? no. Because you think I might tell James? Because you don't need to know. Hey. It's going to be all right. How'd it go? good. I told her what she wanted to hear, Just like you told me. That it? yeah. Cool. listen, I want you to call her up, Tell her you've got some information. Make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right? Okay. is everything okay? Yeah. why? She looks upset. I'll call you later. Got something down here we can use, Michael. If they come through that door... You hit 'em right here. Go ahead, take it. Go ahead. It'll puncture the heart. You were hiding Scofield in your room? Look at you-- the power make you mad already. Come along, Norman. Let's go. What is so urgent? Lincoln bought a gun. I... I asked him what he planned on doing with it, But he wouldn't answer. So I just... I just thought you might want to know. If anything changes, I'll get back to you, okay? You ow, the other day When you and lincoln had your little spat in the lobby And you-- all distraught and jilted-- Went across the street to the bar, A cynic might think that was staged. I'm a cynic, sugar. You're high, sugar. If it's any comfort, you guys almost pulled it off. The puerto rican and the gorilla-- You really had me scrambling there for a minute. Hey, if you don't want my help, fine, I'm out, okay? It's a little thing called a tracing number-- On the check I gave you. Apparently your extensive expertise In banking Failed you that day. You promptly wired all 25 k To maricruz delgado In chicago At 123 please don't hurt me lane. I swear to god, if something happens to her... If what?! What, jackass?! You're going to go back there and you're going to get me Some real information, Or Maricruz and her head are going to part ways. Get out of my car. Now. Hey, Blanco. I got your good buddy Lechero here. Why don't you give it the secret knock so he knows it's you, huh? The combination. What makes you think I have the combination? Just do what he says. huh? How many times you gonna pull that little thing out? As many times as I feel necessary. What, you think it make you look strong? All it does is magnify your weakness. Funny, I'm feeling pretty Secu right about now. Now, the combination, old man. we're not asking again. Sammy! I'm opening the door. Michael, do not open the... Drop 'em! Drop them, I sai Now move! You're escaping with him? I was gonna tell you all about this, bredda. It just never camep, eh? Take it. It's yours. The tunnel, The escape plan, everything. We can go together. I'm taking everything you t. But you ain't going nowhere. How you finishing up this hole? Promise me you'll take Whistler with you. You making demands on me? Hu I understand... Why you're going to kill me, But he's done nothing wrong. I'll tell you everything you need to know, Just take him with you. You need him. He's the only one who figured this one out. Don't you worry, I'll take care of yoriend. All right. First, you need to keep building braces To support the tunnel as you go. How you do that? Whistler can show you how. Look like you just Make some wood squares from these boxes here. Like I said, Whistler can show you. How much further to the surface? Not far. Can't be more than ten feet. Impressive, Blanco. Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it. How long is this going to set us back? What's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at A giant sinkhole out in no man's land. Michael? We're good. Yeah. We're good. Back in business. I'm in. For what, getting your ass kicked? I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops. You're in, champ. Okay, you need to stay here. I got to get something, all right? Don't move. Can you get home from here? Yeah, I'm two blocks away. If he doesn't take you, I will. Here. Use this. Thanks. Right there. You know, for all the times you wanted me To prove I was a fisherman, I should have been asking if you were a real engineer. That could've been one of us buried down there. I'll do bett next time. I'm gonna go back down and try to salvage some of those braces. Yeah, I'll go with you. Never gets any easier. Scofield, visita. Scofield, visita. All the side jobs I do at Sona for three years. I save all of my money. It's $173. If you're really leaving, it's yours. Take me with you. Please? I don't want to be here anymore. You don't want any part of this. You got a plan or are we back to square one? I have a plan. good, 'cause I got something cooking on tutside. I ain't walking into a buzzsaw again. How you dealing with the animals in here? Actually, it's starting to feel like home. Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this? Why? Sofia found a passport in one of the apartments he kept. Name's Gary Miller.
