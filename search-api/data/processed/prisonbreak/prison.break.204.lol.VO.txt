The dredging of the river under Scofield's apartment bore some fruit. Found a hard drive under the river bed. Serial numbers match an order that scofield put in with Dell a few months before he was incarcerated. They've recovered about 12% of the data so far. And this is helping us how? Blood tests came back. B- Negative all over that crash site. - Scofield and burrows are both... - B- negative. I know. - I'll reach out to the media. - How about don't? If it gets out that the guy who... Who masterminded this whole thing is possibly dead, and the other six cons are gonna get their guards up even more. It is our policy... Excuse me! It is our policy not to announce deaths until they're confirmed! We've got an exploding car and a blood match. Well, then do more tests. - On what? - On the bumper. I don't know. I don't care.

Here, yo, slow down. - We're doing, like, 65 in a 60... - Yo, slow down. All right, dad. Yo, we can't be having that, man. Tickets are, like, 200 bones. Yeah. I never thought I'd say this, Scofield but I thank god for the day you walked into Fox River. And out of it. It's gonna be okay. I don't want to hear from you right now. You told me nothing would happen. You promised me. That's one pissed off commie you got on your hands there, scofield. Didn't your mama tell you how to treat a lady? Or was she a whore like this one? Linc! Got a problem there, Burrows? We only need one of you to take us to the money. Remember that. Let's go, buddy. Let's go. I'd been really drunk at the wedding speech. And this was the first time that we'd spoken since then. And it was cleansing. It was really cleansing. Thank you. Good share, Ralph. Well, we're out of time. Unless there are any burning desires... Actually, I'd like to... You know, if there's time. Of course. I'm Lance, and I'm an addict. Hi, Lance. My, uh, mother died of M.S. Last week. She just... Gave out.

All right, everybody, face the wall and look straight ahead! Eyes front. How was your flight? Bumpy. Everything is ready? We got a container ship down at the navy yard. The captain's one of ours.

That's right. All right, everybody out. That way, come on. Careful. Don't touch me. Just relax. You know, I believed everything you told me, and I did everything you asked. I risked my life for you. For what? For $10,000, I risked my life? And this entire time, you've had $5 million just waiting there. You're a bastard, Michael. For all the aggravation, I hope you got to hit that a few times, scofield. We're going to wait it out in that shack. Keep moving, come on. Come on. Fantasia, get going. I need to talk to you...alone. What do you want? To ruin his life like he's ruined mine. Where you coming from? Me? I was just hitting the head, boss. What's your name? Clyde. Clyde May. You got any id, Mr. May? I don't, uh...

That is, in between rides, anyhow. Ain't much of a bag to be hitchhiking with. I travel light. And you're just hoofing it out here in the middle of nowhere? I do have the right to see a little bit of the country I lost my hand for, don't I? Why don't you tell me what this is all about, officer. We got a vehicle here without a driver, and at present, you're the only driver without a vehicle. Hell, is that what this is all about? Why didn't you say so? Dirty hippie kid dropping a deuce in the facilities. Came in with that car not two minutes ago. Check it out. What were you, army? Hell no. Corps. Well, then. Semper fi, brother. What outfit were you? 196th. 196th? Never heard of it. Where they out of? Hey, sarge! What the hell, man? I didn't do nothing. Found these in his knapsack, after he said he had no car. What? Semper fi, brother. Semper fi. Stop stressing, it doesn't do any good. Maybe you ought to start stressing, if they're going to put a bullet in our heads. They need us. They need us to get that money. I admire your optimism. She's rolling, man. I can feel it. So you want to ruin scofield's life. Well, get in line. What are you really looking for? Same as you... Money. Money? You want money? Ten grand, how's that sound? We do it right now, right there on those floorboards. Not in a thousand years. Beat it then. You got nothing else I need. Typical man. I'm talking about millions of dollars, and you'd piss it away for sex. That's right. And I was hoping you wouldn't let Michael outsmart you, too. Scofield ain't outsmarting no one. You think that tire went flat by accident? What are you offering? I can find out where the money is. He trusts me. What do you want? My fair share. You find out where that money is, your fair share is $200,000. Out of five million? It's not even... I got the gun, girl. You're lucky you're a partner at all. I'll be right back. Fibonacci's in D.C. Yeah, and he's in Denver, Atlanta, Miami... No, no, no. This time, it's for real. He's testifying again. He's in Washington right now. The Globe Hotel, room 116. Is this information any good? It's from New Jersey. Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute. Get the car. Look at this room, John. Look. We can be a family again. But you want to risk it all, disrespect us, and for what, for vengeance? - He betrayed me. - I don't care. He betrayed us. I'm sorry you... Will never understand what happens... When you're in prison. But you could go back to pris... I swear to god... I'd rather die than go back. There's no going back, never, ever again. Christ saved you, John. Don't turn your back on him. Don't turn your back on us. I... I don't know, about 20 miles from Gunnison. He's coming, I have to go. Who was that? Nobody, it's just my father. Hey, listen. Do you mind if we stop at the next motel? It's only like 4:00? Yeah, but we've been driving forever. It's cool, I'll drive. I really just want to stop. - But if we get on the road now... - Scott! It's my car, and I'm tired of being in it, okay? All right. You heard about the call coming in? Can you believe it? Of all the players in this thing,</i> it's the rat that could give us our first collar. Come on. You guys need to use the can, hold it. If you need to tinkle, sweet pea, I'll watch you any time. Sit down. Hands behind your back. Took your time. It takes time to gain a man's confidence. You're right. He'll bite on anything I say. You just tell me where we trap him, and I'll tell him that's where the money is. Hey, you're the guy from the gas station, right? I'm the guy who was having car trouble. Seems to be purring along now, huh? Yeah. Water pump. 200 bucks for this heap. Well, they'll get you. Look, I-I hope I'm not out of line, but I heard you telling the cop back there about your hand. My old man was killed in 'nam when I was a kid, so I have the utmost respect for our servicemen. Just serving my country. A lot of us are grateful for it. Listen, if you need a ride or something... Well, to be honest with you, my... My dogs are kind of barking. Well, all right. Jerry Curtin. Clyde. Clyde May. My kid Danny's riding shotgun. I hope you don't mind sitting in the back. Hi. I'm Danielle. Hi, yourself. What do you want? I need to use the bathroom. Again? I have a small bladder. That ain't all you got. Get up. Well? They plan to trap you. The big one- he's got friends in Utah. Criminals. A town called Panguitch. They grow drugs on the farm there. They'll tell you that's where the money is, but no money. Just old friends with guns, waiting for you. Easy enough. We take a pass on Panguitch. Where's the money really? I'll find out soon enough. But $200,000 was old price for this information. I want a new price. She's trying to renegotiate. If it wasn't for me, you'd be face down in a marijuana farm. One third. It's gonna take a lot more than information if you want a million-six, sweet pea. Such as? You know. Piece of that can anytime I want it. Is that it? Aren't you gonna slap me? I've slept with men for a lot less, trust me. And what happened to "never in a 1,000 years? " That was negotiating. So. Deal? Deal. We got a $150,000 here, John. With Vittorio's place in Solanas, we'll be able to live off the interest. Where's your father? Everything all right, boss? Yeah. Let's get this over with... So I can get back to my family. She'll get it done. Nika and I have come too far together. When money's on the line, you trust no one. Sometimes you have to. Not if you want to survive, you don't. You really don't trust anyone, do you? Can you blame me after all that's happened? No, I mean before that. Before prison. Every time I trusted someone, I got burned. Every time I got close to someone, I got screwed. I know better, and so should you. That's right, the lotus motel. I don't know the number. I can't talk anymore; I have to go. Oh, check it. I- I know this might be a little forward and all, but... Let me ask you something. You got a man? I mean, a boyfriend? What am I thinking? You're mormon... I'm not mormon. You think all girls from Utah are mormons? They are, aren't they? Well, yo, hey. Yo, then you can party, right? When I land, I want 12 armed agents waiting for me on the ground. Tell them I want to go straight to the motel from the airstrip. You got it. I was an ass before. I apologize. A little bit. - It's all right. - Here you go. I was a huge ass. I apologize. I'm not going to argue with you. Well, I mean, what were the odds that you were actually a doctor? All right, fair enough. They're probably not good, but... And I should not have interrupted you, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. Well, then, apologies accepted. I recommend the blueberry pie. Blueberry pie it is. Hey, there, Danny. Hey. Sure is nice of your daddy to buy me a room for the night. Yeah, he's always helping out with vets and stuff. Good man. But I was wishing we could have kept going on toward Utah. Lots of light left in the day, lots of road to go. When dad's back acts up, we stop. Young miss? That's kind of insulting, isn't it? I mean, you're a grown woman. But adults are always trying to infantilize girls your age, treat you like children. No duh. My dad won't let me get earrings, and I'm 14. You see? That's what I'm saying. You are more than perfectly capable of... - Of making your own decisions... - Tell my dad that. Yeah, but he won't want to hear it, right? Because he wants to keep you as a baby. Right? Even though you're... You're more than old enough to choose how you wanna dress, or... accessorize. - What are you doing? - Just in need of a friend, - No. No. I'm telling my dad. - that's all... Wait! She's got it all wrong. Go wait outside. You and I are gonna work this out. Jerry... You really don't want to do this. Thing I like about you is your determination. I've got family in Kladno that have been waiting for me to send for them. They know what kind of work you're in? They think I work at Starbuck's. How stupid do you think I am? My daddy always said,"fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and I put you in the ground. " Any more games, and I stop the hooker's air, understand? Thanks for the dance, sweet pea. You bitch! Fooled you. I carried it; the cons can change it. Oh, you really suck, Bellick, you know that? Roll 'em. Let's go. Put your hands behind your back. Thank you. You're as stupid as the prison doc, you know that? Ignore him. He conned her, too. Made her think he loved her, and look what she got. An overdose and a shot at 30 years inside. What are you talking about? Guess you haven't been reading the papers, have you, college boy? Cops found your girlfriend- fish-belly white, garglin' her own puke. Shut up. But what do you care, a long as she left the door open for you? Shut up! Hit a sore spot, didn't I? Dad... It really is like the best pie I've ever had. You know what it needs though... Some crack. No, I mean, you know, not a lot. A pinch. - A pinch of crack? - A pinch of crack. A pinch of crack, a dollop of smack. That's good pie. That's so wrong. No? I'm sorry. Hello. Sara... It's me. What do you want? I don't have time to talk. And there's every chance they're listening to this call right now, But there's a lot I want to say. Please don't hang up on me. I don't... I don't want to talk to you. I heard about... I heard about what happened. I want you to know that... I want you to know how sorry I am... For everything. Sorry's not going to do me a whole lot of good with what I'm up against right now. Listen... Anyone with any ties to me and my brother is in danger now. I have no ties to you and your brother anymore. There is a way I can protect you. It's already in your possession. What are you talking about? I was real, Sara. You and me... It's real. Michael? Michael? How long to the motel? Approximately ten minutes, sir. Let's make it five? Yo, I haven't taken a shower like that in forever! Where are you going? I was going to surprise you. Surprise me how? I was going to get some tequila and limes. All right, well, hold up- No, no. No, it'll only take a minute. Stay here and relax. You seem kind of nervous. I do? Yeah, you're sweating. Maybe I am nervous. Trust me, girl, you got nothing to worry about, all right? I'm one of the good guys. You seem like it. Hang on tight. I had the manager unlock the door. Gotcha. If you're looking for the rat, John... Fibonacci's 2,000 miles from here. Who are you? Local cops or feds? Feds, John, only roll out the best for a man of your stature. I deserve to know who turned on me. Tell me. The man was facing a RICO rap. He did not want to go to prison. I'm sure you can appreciate that, knowing what you know about the place now. Whatever you're thinking about doing, John... Don't. You are going back to Fox River today, or the morgue... That's your call. Coming out. Weapons comes out first, John. Forgive me. Yeah, I'm coming out. Easy, John. Easy. We got a weapon, right hand. These are serious men here. They have instructions to shoot at the first sign of aggression. Please. I'm asking you, respectfully. Drop the weapon, kneel and put your hands on your head. I kneel only to God. I don't see him here. John! I think I screwed up. My dad's an Air Force colonel. Total nazi. One of those nightmare overprotective dads. Yeah? Well, I called him. Told him I was traveling with you. I told him that we were staying in the same hotel room. Girl. What? You got to learn how to lie, girl. What you thinking? Yeah, I- for some reason I don't know how. He was mad enough when I told him I was staying in a hotel room with a guy, - That was one thing... - Yeah, yeah. But when I told him I was staying in a hotel with a guy that... I maybe sort of liked... He lost it. Wait. Wait, what? Is that okay? At least let us take you into town. No. If I'm seen with you, it's a lot of trouble for me. I can walk, it's only a mile. We never would've made it this far without you. But now you're crossing the border. Without me. You can't go where we're going. It's not a life for you. Then that's it then. It's over for good. Thank you. Be safe. Good luck. I loved you, Michael. And I thought I was going to get that back, but you just used me. - That's not true. - I deserve more than this. I deserve more than just being the girl that you call when you need something. You really think you're gonna find the money in Utah? I don't care about the money in Utah! I don't want any more crime. I turn you in, I get $200,000. Legal money. You're the policemen's problem now. Nika... Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you! No, you won't. Good luck to you. Hey. H.Q. called. They're asking why you didn't intercept Abruzzi when he was walking towards the motel. The man was a mob boss. The right move was to get him trapped. They're saying the way you played it, there was only one possible outcome. H.Q. has a problem with the way I do things, they can pick up a gun and follow me into the field next time. Scofield always knew the rat was the key to Abruzzi. We just put it out on the wire and Abruzzi bit. Speaking of Scofield... The crash was staged. Pig blood. Smart kid. The problem with being that clever is that sooner or later, you end up getting too clever for your own good.
