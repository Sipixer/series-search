We have an issue. Good afternoon to you,too, Andy. I've been reviewing your roster From the northeast division, And apparently two of your top buyers Don't have valid social security numbers. Care to explain that? When I'm about to make a sale to a client, "is the client being helped?" And,"are we gettin' paid?" There's a reason Why I was the top Seller in the northeast. I Don't get hung up on the details. And what you're saying is... There might be a typo or two in my reports, But I'm pretty sure those checks cleared. Fair enough. You've had a busy morning, Frank. Unlawful entry, resisting arrest. It's not even lunchtime. You're trying to put the fear of god into me. Mission accomplished. Listen,sergeant, I know a decent amount about the justice system, Enough to know that if you wanted to, You could drop this whole thing and... It would save a lot of trouble for everybody,huh? What kind of phone is this? It's a,a japanese brand. Off market. What about the ankle monitor you're wearing? I've been on the straight and narrow, And it's due to come off in a couple of Days. Press your fingers in the ink. I had two grand go up in smoke because of a bum Gate. I mean,i got a little upset for a second. You know what I mean? Who wouldn't? Let's talk about this. Should we talk about how you punched an officer first? Or how you tried to flee the scene? Pick a felony. Take him to the holding cell. What do you mean he got arrested? W-what happened? It's a long story, But we need you to get Mahone and the device out. Can you do that? What,what do you think, That every Time you guys screw up, I can just magically make things disappear? We ain't interested in your excuses. Can you do it or not? Lincoln,y-you know what? I'll call you back. Excuse me. Who are you? What is this? I'm Brian. I work in the it department. We were getting some registry inconsistencies On the server, so... I'm just running a few routine spot checks. So you just barge in here without asking? I have level two clearance. See? It's what I do. I go into people's offices, I fix their computers. I just figured it was better To do it when you weren't here. Well,you know what? You got to go. Don't come back in here. Sure thing. You're all set. So what's the word? Self's on it. On it,as in he's getting Mahone out? He said he'd handle it. What's there to handle? Self yanked us all out of prison for way bigger charges. Getting Mahone out should be easy,shouldn't it? Yeah. Let's concentrate on finding the next cardholder. As soon as we get the device back,we'll move forward. Would you please walk us through what we know so far? Sure. Howard Scuderi runs Agrisow, Which is the world's largest agricultural conglomerate. It actually has huge holdings in Laos, Which,given the current inflation, Means that they are making money hand over fist. "my friends are playing at the park." Sweetheart,why Don't you go play in your room For a little bit,okay? How are you feeling? Better. I,i made you a sandwich. Thank you. Um,you never explained what happened. My car broke down in the middle of the desert,and,uh... There was no one around for miles, And my cell phone was dead, So I walked here. Hey,do you still have that owl That I sent from germany? Yeah. I need to see it. Okay. Thank you. Oh,my god,gretchen! Is that,is that, that a real gun? It is. You Don't work for the irs? I Don't. Who do you work for? As of now? Myself. He attended Touro Law School in Long Island. He spent the next 18 years Bouncing around the D.O.J. And D.O.D. Before being dumped On the doorstep of homeland in '02. Come in. General. What did you find out? I tried accessing Self's user account, But he has a tricky firewall system in place. There's no easy way to get past it, Not without... Drawing attention. So we still Don't know why he's interested in me. Well,uh... Maybe if you gave me more Time. I'll look into it. Look,he's important to me. Okay,he's doing a job for me. Yeah,well, your ci punched One of my officers in the face. I understand... You're lucky he's not being charged with worse. I apologize for him. Okay? Look,i-i'm asking for a favor here, Okay,from one badge to another. When was the last Time you looked at your badge? 'cause I'm pretty sure mine says "issued by the city of Los angeles," Not the federal government, So unless you get a court order that... Hey,hey! You want to go that route? You want to get smart? Huh? Want to get detained at the Guadalajara Airport When you're coming back from visiting your nana? How does that sound? Huh? You ever hear of a No-fly List? That's what my badge could do. Okay? Want to see what else it could do? I was starting to worry. Sign these. Yeah. These aren't release papers. Well,i need you to sign that So I can collect your personal... They're gonna run my prints, and once they... You punched a cop. Yeah,trying to save the mission. Keep your voice down. Okay? I did the best I could do. You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device. You... You want me to give up the one thing That makes me valuable to the team. Yeah,you knew the deal when you came on board. Okay,we all sacrificed a lot to get this far. You want to flush it down the toilet Because you made a bad move? Got it. Self got the device. Mahone's still in jail. But Mahone-- he-he's part of the team. Was. Look,i feel just as bad About his kid as everyone else, But we can't blow this mission on one person. Oh,yeah? So if I get popped tomorrow, You guys are just going to forget about me? Yeah. Hey,listen. An assassin is trying to hunt us down,okay? And that t-bag character is out in the wind With the keys to the castle. We got enough problems Without having to worry about this guy's ass in jail. You shut up. Okay. Alex has an alias, but if they run his prints, They're gonna find out that he's... Not if-- Whenthey run his prints, they're going To figure out who he is And that he's not in a supermax like he's supposed to be, And then they're gonna realize we're not... Michael. Linc's right. We Don't have a choice. We move forward with the plan. Agent Self. I'm an associate of general Krantz. Word has gotten back to the general That you've been pulling information on him. Why is that,mr. Self? I'm homeland security. It's my job to protect people Who make attractive terrorist targets-- People in upper ranks of military, People like Krantz. Is there a particular threat I should know about? Maybe you can debrief me on the situation. What's your division? You want to give me your clearance level? I'm a... Hired contractor. Right. Well,i usually Don't make a habit of giving civilians Who corner me in underground parking structures Classified information. Okay? So if the general has a problem, he can call me. Is there something else you want to say to me? I think we got off on the wrong foot. I'm just here to give you a little friendly advice. What's that? The general-- he likes his privacy. That's all. Yes,so that was Wyatt. I gotta tell you, I'm not a big fan Of almost catching a bullet in my head. Well,now you know what it's like. So,how well do you know Mahone? I know he wants to take down the Company Just as much as we do. You also realize He's a major liability. I mean, If Wyatt could find me, he could find Mahone. And then people... So get him out. I told you I can't. But I can get to him. I mean,he can be touched. I Don't know,maybe Mahone is a stand-up guy. Or maybe he likes to run his mouth To work an angle, I'm not sure. But if need be, I can get rid of that angle. I can eliminate that threat. That's not an option. Oh,yes it is. Okay,because if a choice has to be made Between him or us.... Hey,frank. Got some good news. Oh,yeah, what's that? I can cut you a break. As easy as that? Spoke with the manager down at the racetrack. Said you were spotted with another male caucasian About ten years your junior. That sound about right? Here come the cops. I have no idea What you're talking about. What was it? The two of you were gonna go in there,rob the vault? Grab as much cash and get out? Someone has to be lookout. I'll take care of it. Go! Look. Maybe you got a wife to get home to. Family. If you're willing To give me the name of your accomplice I think we can change your charges. I thought we worked together,you know. Help each other out. You're on your own. You holler if you change your mind. All right,let's talk about the fifth cardholder. The general is requiring All the cardholders to have their cards on them at all Times, So Scuderi will have his card,too. Now,scuderi has major security around his house. Big fence, lots of guard dogs. Where are the documents? These are from the county surveyor's office. It shows the layout of his property, And its proximity to every other house on his street. He has-- surprise,surprise-- A top of the line electronic alarm system That will alert him If there's a breach in the structure. If we cut the power-- the alarm goes off. If we double the power With a voltage spike The alarm system, in order to protect itself Against an overload, will shut itself down. And that's how we're getting in. Then what? Look,i know what the score is. It's every man for himself. You get left behind you get locked up. Tough titties. Now,i signed on the dotted line Like everyone else and I want to know exactly What I'm doing on this job. I'm with Bellick on this one. You know,maybe We should have a plan for when the cops get here 'cause if Mahone squeals They're gonna come real quick. He's a fed-- how many deals Do you think this guy's made in his life? You think he's just gonna tuck tail between his... Shut up. Look,we can sit here and debate What Mahone is or is not gonna do for the rest of the Day, We cannot break him out of a police station. One... Two... Three,four,five,six-- No. Too big. Eight by ten. This is the lowest gauge I could get. It's perfect. Cool. I guess,uh... I guess we're gonna leave him in jail. Is that a statement or a question? It's just if something happens to Alex-- If,uh,if the Company finds him... If the roles were reversed and you were the one locked up, You really think Alex would risk it all to get you out? I mean,i Don't know. I think he'd finish what he started. I think he'd bring the Company down. Can I help you with something? Yes,i-i'm here to see Frank Zwan. I'm a family friend. I'm afraid you can't see him right now. He's about to be transferred for his arraignment. Actually,i'd like to be there... For moral support. Hello? Michael. Alex,look,i'm sorry. He found me. Wyatt-- he showed up at the station house Where they're holding me. I Don't know how he did it. I Don't know how he figured it out. Let me call agent Self. No,michael,listen... No,maybe he can get you moved. It's-it's over for me. It's Done. It's-- and I'm not gonna say anything about anything. But you need to promise me something,okay? Okay,what? Promise me... That you will get to Wyatt And you'll kill the son of a bitch. And then you'll call Pam And you'll tell her that he's gone. All right. I promise. Okay. Okay. All right. You ready to go? Michael? I'm his wife. I'm sorry, I'm-i'm still in shock. I'll be down this afternoon. Thank you. Who are you? I just have some things I need to take care of. You Don't need to worry. You have this...
