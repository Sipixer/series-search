I'm not the brother you remember. I've changed. And I am gonna do something that a lot of people are gonna think is horrible. And you just remember the brother you grew up with. She's not here. - Yeah? - Sara, the ship is leaving. I'm already on board. Love you. Why are you telling me this now ? If I had to it all over again, I'd do it different, you know ? Collar bone and rotator cuff. Six inches to the right, you're dead. You've come so far. - How much further would I've to go? - Well you're lucky. For this you only have to go to Panama. - He found him. - Where ? He just boarded a plane to Panama City. What the hell's he doing in Panama ? You like wigs ? For the right money, I like anything. What about the goldfinch thing ? There is a message from Sucre. Still running, huh ? Says the Bag still has the bag. "He's in Panama City at the Fin Del Camino Hotel. "If you're there and want to help put that bird back in the cage, "let me know. Sucre." See you soon. One thing's for sure, you're just as pretty as advertised. Prettier, even. You got to help me, please. You say a word, I'm gonna cut your throat out ! - Pam, it's me. - Cam's napping. Yeah ? How's he doing ? Good, it was his first day back at school.</i> - That's great. - Where are you ? I'm, out of the country. Is everything all right ? Remember how I always said that the day would come... ... and I'd be done ? Leave the Bureau and... never look back? Yes. Today's that day. I have one more thing to do, and once I do it, everything is going to fall into place. And I, I'll be done. I hope you mean it. If I didn't have this job hanging over me anymore, if I were free... I need to know. I'm not saying no. I will make this right, I swear to God. And you and me and Cam... I have to go. I never stopped loving you, Pam... - ever. - <i>Just be safe, Alex.</i> You're in position ? - Yeah. - I'll be there in ten minutes. Got it. Anyway... What's wrong ? Come on. Move in. I love it. Mr. Above It All down here trying to sniff out that $5 million just like the rest of us riff-raff. See ? You ain't no better than me. I want T-Bag locked up. It's the only reason I'm here. Dudley Freakin' Do-Right ? - I didn't know you were gonna be here. - What are you talking about ? You e-mailed me. You said T-Bag was here. It's on the Web site. What ? No. I didn't write anything on the Web site... to you or anybody else. Is T-Bag in that hotel ? Yeah, a couple feds staking it out across the street. Well, you're gonna help us get it then. Maybe you missed the part about the feds. I don't care. I didn't travel 2,000 miles down the diarrhea trail to get to this backward-ass country to not get my $5 million ! Well, that's too bad 'cause this is looking more and more like a setup. Well, then get that little college boy brain of yours to work then. And if you don't think I'm serious, just ask your old cellie here what length I'll go to. He's got Maricruz locked away somewhere. You're gonna help him get the money or she's dead. Yeah, I'm a big jerk, Scofield. Shame on me. I'm in no position to ask you for anything. I need your help, <i>papi,</i> I do. Are you in or what ? Subtitles : www.swsub.com Get the gun off me. - I asked you a question. - I said get the gun off me or I walk. All right, you'll get your $5 million. You get Maricruz, and I get T-Bag. Win, win, win. But you got to do exactly what I say. Thank you, bro. All right, Einstein, what you thinking ? And it's the third day of testimony in the trial of Dr. Sara Tancredi,</i> daughter of the late governor Frank Tancredi.</i> So far, pundits feel the prosecution is well on its way</i> to meeting its burden of proof and getting a conviction on all counts. Defense counsel, you may proceed. Your Honor, at this time I ask this tape be marked "Defense Exhibit'D.'" Objection. Your Honor, this tape is the very propaganda that M. Scofield and L. Burrows released to the media that was summarily debunked. - The jury still has a right to hear it. - The tape is hearsay. - Unavailable witness exception. - The witness is only unavailable because he's a fugitive on the run. Be that as it may, his statement on this tape exonerates Dr. Tancredi. Your Honor... The tape is allowed. The State's objection will be noted in the record. Much blame has been placed on another innocent person</i> Dr. Sara Tancredi. She had nothing to do with our escape. Sara, if you're listening, I know I can't ask you for another chance,</i> I only hope by now you've found your safe haven.</i> The trial of the late Governor Tancredi's daughter,</i> Dr. Sara Tancredi continues today in Cook County. Dr. Tancredi, whose medical license has been suspended</i> pending the outcome of the trial, is facing multiple counts ranging from aiding...</i> I'm gonna kill him. And go right back to prison. I don't care. Once we get the money and he tells me where Maricruz is, I'm gonna kill him. If you find Maricruz you're going to marry Maricruz and live happily ever after. Yeah, after I sink a knife in Bellick's chest. Bellick and T-Bag will get theirs, trust me. Didn't Fox River teach you anything, man? 'Cause the same rules apply out here. It doesn't make a difference if you're guilty or innocent. It's who survives. You're not that guy. That son of a bitch took my girl, locked her up somewhere. I am that guy now, Michael. Look at me. The only reason I'm not five miles away from here right now is because I want to help you find Maricruz, not kill Bellick. And if that's your game, I'm gone. Believe me, I understand the impulse to pull the trigger. But if we lose ourselves, we lose everything. It's been a week. I don't know where she is. - I'm scared. - We'll find her. We'll find her. What the hell's this? Now, if you start acting like a cowboy this whole thing's going south real fast, remember that. Here we go. You're not going to like how this ends, Lincoln. I'm giving you a chance. Right now. Just... back away, all right? Just back away. The son of a bitch, you killed my dad? You're done. Those bullet holes don't heal too good, do they, Mahone? Toss me the handcuffs. Hand them over or I swear to God I'll blow your head clean off. Americans? - Yeah. - Oh, thank, God. Do you know where the Cathedral Guadalupe is? Never heard of it. I was supposed to meet my old lady half an hour ago. - That's great. - You can't miss it, but I missed it. I was wondering you had maybe a travel guide or something on you? Why don't you just keep on walking, pal? Well, excuse me for thinking I could ask for a little help from some fellow Americans. Listen, beat it. So how we doing gentlemen? Sucre, the gun. Come on. Get in the alley. It is a global problem. 48% of North American lakes are eutrophic. It's 53% in Europe... - Kristine. - Yeah? It's your brother, Paul. What, what's going on? Hello. He's in this building right here. We got to move. Let's see your I.D. Feds? No, if these guys were, they'd be after T-Bag. You guys Company? Come on, Sucre, let's wrap these numb nuts up. What are you guys doing here? What do you want? I don't like this. Something's up. Come on, Sucre, let's move it. Now, let's go, come on. Let's go, Michael. We know you're in here, Bagwell! Three to one... do the math. Okay, okay, I don't want any trouble. Slide the gun over. We can work something out, boys. Slide the gun over. Where's the money? Who called the cops? You got three seconds, hillbilly. One... In there! Get it. You want it, you get it. We don't have time for this, Bellick. Nothing stupid now. You're not playing a game. Open it. Sucre, move your ass! Freeze, Bagwell! Get the money! You want the girl, get the money! Don't. Don't. We can work something out. Move. Sucre, come on. Theodore Bagwell, he's the one you want for that dead chick in there. Anybody speak English? I didn't do it! I swear to God I didn't do it! No, please, please! We can do a little divvying right here, then we'll go - our separate ways. - Sucre, I want you to get us a car. What's going on? What's the plan? I said, get us a car. Looks like you've made some friends lately. I don't follow. That little set-up back there, just a little out of your league. Looked almost professional. Let's say that's the case. What's it worth to you to find out? Because I <i>am</i> in possession of some information that you might need, pretty. Okay. Tell me what you know. Maybe I'll let you walk... without the money. Yeah? Yeah. You're gonna let me traipse on out of here? Depends on the information. Who's pulling your strings? You know, I got a hunch you're speaking with a forked tongue, pretty. So I'm gonna tell you what, we go someplace public with a car waiting for me to leave, and <i>then...</i> then I'll tell you. Deal? Oh, my God. That is only the second time... a weapon has ever jammed on me. First time was during training for Gulf One. As soon as it happened, the commanding officer, he got in my face and he said, "Son, a weapon jam on the battlefield, you might as well call that suicide." Kristine, I've... done things... Damn. Damn. I love you, Paul, whatever it is that got you here. And there's a way out, believe me. My... My entire adult life, I've followed orders... uh, and I did terrible things, because I thought they were right, and... it turns out I did those things in service of nothing. So that's what I'm left with... Nothing. You have me. Yeah, okay. And you have a clean slate. Anything. Everything. It's available to you starting right now. - The things I've done, Kristine... - Undo them. There's always a way. Maybe that gun jammed for a reason. Come here. Don't let your pride get in the way now, pretty. Save it. Locking me up ain't gonna help your situation none. I <i>have</i> information. What's the plan? We're gonna take him to the embassy, we're gonna make sure he's deported, then we'll go looking for Bellick, all right? Meanwhile, I want you to ride in the back with him. I'm telling you, you are being penny-wise and pound-foolish. Get in the car. I'll tell her about the offer. - Well? - 12 years. No. The jury heard Michael's tape. They heard a convicted felon lie for a woman that he clearly cares for. He's got no credibility. Sara, we need to take a hard look at what they're offering. Due respect, Marty, we aren't going to prison, I am. They've made it very clear that they want somebody to hang for this, and unfortunately, you're the only one they've got in their grasp. There's no avoiding it. This is the plea agreement. We can walk you through it if you'd like. 12 years? He didn't answer. I certainly hope your brother makes it back to that boat. And if he doesn't? You should see yourself. You look like you're hanging in there by a thread. I just want this over with. Then you should never have come down here. In case you hadn't noticed, me and my brother don't quit for no one. Thank God for that. Because it's guys that are accused of things like you are that keeps guys like me in business. Kept... guys like me in business, rather. It's gonna end bad for you, man. Couple of things in this world I'm good at. One of them's looking into a man's eye and knowing when he's beat. How far to the embassy? Just hang in there, buddy. And then what? We're gonna turn him in. And how do we not get busted? Before we get there, I'll pull over. We'll hog-tie him with duct tape, and we'll dump him out, and hit the road, and I'll call the cops, tell 'em where we left him. Then how we get to Bellick? Don't worry, we'll find him. Y'all ain't getting within a mile of Bellick. Nobody asked you. He's got a point, though, Michael. Just keep the gun on him, okay? I mean, if Bellick's locked up, what's good the money going to be to us? Buddy, we'll fix it. My girl's life is on the line here. Sucre, you better pull it together. Easy. Easy. Buddy, you're gonna be all right. Go get the money. Please. Quick. Get the money. Pressure. Presión. What exactly is it that you want, Pretty? I'm turning you in. Is that it? Really? It ain't about the money? 'Cause, if it is, you can tell me. Ain't nobody here but us cons. You can walk or get dragged. But it's up to you. No. See, when you had the gun on me, I afforded you a certain respect. But here? Well, the scales are tipped back my way. So I'm going to spell out the present options. Either we split this money, and you can go get your legs tattooed or whatever the hell it is you want, or they're gonna find your corpse slumped over that there chair with your pants down around your ankles, 'cause it's been a long time coming, Pretty. Well, I got my answer. Whenever you're done yakking. Bring it, bitch. Who are you fooling? You ain't gonna kill me, Mr. Michelangelo. You ain't got it in you, so how would you just let me do the killing? All right. Thank you. Okay, Sara. Now, here's how the plea is going to go down. The judge is going to need you to allocute to the charges. He's going to ask you if you intentionally left the door open. - You will say yes. - Right. Then he's going to ask you if you gave support and comfort to Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows since the escape. You'll say yes. And then the sentence will be immediately handed down. The prosecution is asking that you do your time in a maximum security facility. I think the judge is going to agree to that. With good behavior, how many years of my sentence can I expect to serve? On a 12-year sentence? You'll do nine years. I'll be out before I'm 40. I'm sorry, Sara. Are you ready for this? What? A very credible witness has just came forward, and he's willing to testify. He'll corroborate everything you've said about this conspiracy. Who? Help! Do you speak English? Good. I need to... I need to get in contact with every hospital in the Panama City area. A friend of mine was... A friend of mine was in a car accident. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to call you back. I'm sorry, Michael. What's wrong? Hello, Michael. If you touch my brother, you're a dead man. Oh, please. You don't have to worry about that. When it comes right down to it, he's just like you. He has a heart that won't kill a man. Give me the handcuffs or I swear to God I'll blow your head clean off. What do you want, Alex? I'll tell you exactly what I want. But first things first. When the authorities captured Bagwell today, the money was nowhere to be found. Now, I can only assume that <i>you've</i> got the money aboard the Christina Rose, right now.</i> It's an amazing plan, Michael. Take the money, take the boat, disappear forever. But you... are not the only one that needs to disappear. You still there? Yeah, I'm still here. Good. Cause I'm going to say this, and I'm going to say this once. Bring me the money, bring me the boat. You are out of your mind. Not really. We both have something the other person needs.
