You can't kill. I will get you. This is... in case you run into trouble down the road. Lincoln, he really wants to see you and your brother. He hasn't seen Michael since he was ten years old. Let's go. Michael never met your grandfather. Dad. - I got Burrows. - Take care of them. I think there's a part of me that enjoys this. It feels to me like chasing a high. And I should know better by now. Hi, Sara. Hey, what is this? It's for my... blood pressure. Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man. No deals. You just crapped out your last bargaining chip, pal. Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen? This is the Tribune police. This is the Tribune police. Make yourself known. Hey, you're in luck. Had a case in back. Excellent. Fishing reel oil. And you want the whole case? Whole case. And the GPS? And the GPS. Must do quite a bit of fishing. Yeah, a lot of fishing... not a whole lot of catching. $96.23. I'm just going to take the reel oil. - Thank you. - Thank you. You have to pay for that. Just take it. Please, don't hurt me. Please. You have to pay for that. The vault. Open it. One for the team. I wasn't going for me, I was going for my daughter. Give Anna her papa's love. I'm going cut your throat out. I loved you, Michael. You just used me. Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly white, gargling her own puke. And what do you care? As long as she left the door open. I feel very fortunate to have met you. I'm sorry, Henry. It's about corporate interests taking over the government... buying elections, fighting wars... People dying so they can turn a profit. We're trying to stop it. What are you, a bunch of spies? Just a handful of senators, congressmen, people like me that once worked for the company. People willing to expose the President for what she is... A shill working for these corporations. We bring her down, we bring them down. What's it got to do with me? Because the way we're going to bring her down is also what we're going to use to set you free. About a week ago, we finally got a break. An NSA analyst sympathetic to our cause finally worked his way up and got clearance into the Echelon program. E- mails, cell phone calls all across this country, if it's transmitted, it goes through Echelon. It's catalogued, interpreted, and then stored for Homeland Security. Nothing is missed by them. Nothing. Including, by accident, for a few months after 9-11... the White House. The analyst got his hands on a phone conversation the president had with Terrence Steadman... two weeks after you supposedly killed him. Now, the analyst tried to get this information out of the building... but it turns out, someone else was snooping, too. Someone else wanted answers about the president. Aldo and Lincoln want to be left alone. Sure, I understand. 24 hours later, Tancredi is dead, the analyst is missing, and the White House Echelon tapes have been deleted from the mainframe. The tape is still out there. And judging by how hard they're going after Sara Tancredi, I'm pretty sure they think she has it. And I think they're right. She's the key to this whole thing, Lincoln. Transcript: www.sadgeezer.com Sync by www.sub-way.fr I would imagine that you're feeling slightly betrayed right now. I understand. As you can see, hi, my name is not Lance, and I'm not an addict. There is one thing about me that should mean a great deal to you right now. That is I am reasonable. If you tell me what you know, you get to go. Then maybe when this is all behind us, we get to grab a piece of pie for old times' sake. I don't know where Michael is. This is not about Michael, this is about your father. He left washington with something that didn't belong to him. We need it back. And you killed him for it. I didn't, no, for what that's worth. But I hope that his death properly illustrates the magnitude of the situation that we're in right now. So, where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. Sara, there's a next step involved in this, and you don't want to experience that. I swear to God I don't know what you're talking about. My father didn't give me anything. I don't know what you're talking about. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? This is my first time. In a long time. Are you aware of the nature of your sins? The nature? I'm not really sure. Deep down inside your heart, you know. Righteousness, maybe. Believing the ends justify the means. What are those ends? Saving someone's life. And the means? I've broken just about every law you can name. But it's not just what I've done. It's what others have done... because I let them. Because I was doing what I thought was right. I should have known better this time. This time? When I was a kid... I watched a man bleed out and die. And I was glad... because he deserved it. Life is only for God to give and take, my son. Suddenly, there is this dark space inside of me. And I knew it was wrong. But here I am. There is a way to stop this. Surrender your will to God. If I surrender now, I lose everything that I love. But do you lose your soul in the process? Well, we all have our crosses to bear. You okay? This is never gonna stop. They're gonna keep coming after us. Lincoln, don't. Is it done? You are. Lincoln Burrows. Your man's dead. Just like anyone else you send to take out my son. We want you. This isn't about L. J. There's a very simple way for all of this to end. I'll tell you how it's going to end. Me staring in your dead eye with my hand around your throat. You don't even know who I am. How much further? Right here is good. Alright, you got it. - Thanks for the ride. - No problem. Agent Mahone. Bill Kim. I'm here to pick you up. I called Kellerman. He's busy right now. Does anyone else know you're here? Good. Can you open the gate? And I need a new vehicle. There's something you should know about me. I don't like being out in the field. I only do so when there's been a screwup. I'm out in the field, Alex. Then why don't you open the gate? You can hurry back to D. C. before your shoes get dirty. We have a lead as to where Burrows will be meeting up with his brother. It's a place he referred to as "Bolshoi Booze." Does that mean anything to you? Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos on Scofield's body. What does it mean? I don't know yet. You'll need to figure it out within the next couple of hours. If Scofield and Burrows cross the border, they'll be out of your jurisdiction, and you'll be of no further value to us. Open the gate. So you can do what? I want to hear it. Straight from the mouth of the guy who's supposed to be our closer. I'll get Scofield and Burrows... and all of the rest of them. And then me and you and Kellerman, we're going to part ways. I just hope you're properly motivated. 'Cause as long as you do your job, we'll forget about Shales. And then you can go back to Colorado and visit your son. Cameron. He's five, right? Don't you ever mention his name again. There he is. That's what I wanted to hear. You cracking, Alex. A lot of people are relying on you. Jane will take care of it. You can trust her. I know this is hard, but it will work out. You have my word. Thank you. Be careful. Listen... I know. Jane's gonna look after you. I don't even know her. She's all right. She's been working for dad for a while. I'll see you soon, I promise. Isn't that the same thing your dad told you? Yeah, but I mean it. What now? Hey, it's me. Just call me when you get this, okay? It's important. They're numbers. Is that my payment? Medical nitroglycerine? As promised. You have no idea how hard it is to get this kind of grade. Even with my contacts. It's time for your end of the deal. Where's that plane gonna be? They call me a couple of hours before with the drop-off point. It keeps the DEA off our backs. Since it's going to be a while, you might want to stay out of the sun. Is there a problem? They're my cousins. Now, after your father accessed this information, he made three calls from his cell phone, all to you. What did he tell you? Just that he was coming back to Chicago. Good. You're being honest. Good. Now, there's a half an hour between when your father landed and when he got home that is unaccounted for. I know you stopped by his office. Did you see him there? The last time I saw my father, he was dead in his study. Did your father have anyone give you anything? Do you think that I'm just withholding information because I like hanging out with you? If I knew something, I would tell you. I don't. I don't know anything about any of this. Really? Then why did you give your father the file on Lincoln Burrows? Why did you open the door for Scofield and help him escape? Why did Scofield send you those coded notes? Why did you come to New Mexico to meet him? Don't try to float a babe-in-the-woods routine by me. It's really going to piss me off, so... come on. You're okay. Look, Sara. We're going to have to come to an understanding. You know that, right? Yeah, you were right; they are coordinates.</i> Plug them into your GPS. They'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert. It's in the middle of nowhere, basically. Thanks. Yeah, no problem. Sir, who are you meeting?</i> What the hell is he doing? He's keeping us out of the loop, that's what he's doing. I'm constantly running from the law with a bad heart... Mexico, where I'm from has got a lot of great things, but... health care ain't one of them. You all right? You look a little nervous. I don't do this every day. I just want to get the information on that plane and, uh... move on. Is that it? That's it. 'Cause I know who you are. You don't have to worry... we can't go within 100 feet of a federal marshal to collect the reward, 'cause we got U. S. and mexican warrants on our heads. But this plane to Panama... Sit down. This is all for your brother? I got four brothers, two in prison. Accept a call? Yes. But break them out? Loco. My brother gave me a baseball mitt for my 14th birthday. I owed him. You're a better man than I am. Time will tell. Shouldn't they have called by now... about the plane? You know, I... I have a question. I thought that these came in glass vials, not plastic. I thought so, too, but the guy I bought it from said he packed it in plastic for transportation over long distances to prevent a fire or an explosion. Really? I never heard of that. What's going on? We're going to do a little quality control test. It's the best available. We got time. For the last time, some black male, early 20s, jumped me from behind. I didn't get a good look at his face. The assailant attacked you from behind? That's what I just said. Yet he managed to make contact square on your forehead. - That's right. - With what? A boomerang? Why don't you tell me what happened? Look, I'm a retired correctional officer out of Illinois. How about showing some professional courtesy, honey? This is Roy Geary. Leave a message. You thieving son of a bitch. You better get down on your knees and pray to god that I don't find you, because, if I do, mark my words, I'm going to gut you bow to stern. President Reynolds was in Tallahassee, Florida,</i> early this morning, attending a $5,000-a-plate breakfast fund-raiser for senator Martin Kleinhenz, who's running for reelection. Later this afternoon, her press conference was derailed when a reporter asked her to comment on Lincoln Burrows' escape from custody. She declined. It's become clear in her first month in office</i> that she cannot separate herself from this manhunt.</i> And as long as it continues... pundits say that questions about Burrows will contin...</i> Ladies. Let's get this party started. The last 30 years, I've hated you. You walked out on me. You haven't even seen Michael. I've seen him before. Not in the papers, dad. Been trying to work out what kind of man abandons his family. Now I'm doing the same damn thing. You'll see him again. I'll make sure of it. How much further? About three hours. It's gonna be a few minutes. My brother should be here soon. Maybe I should go outside and make sure he can see me. That's a good idea. I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it. Ernesto, por favor. Bueno, te veo. Was that the call? Yes, it was. About the plane? Como se llamas? Agua con azucar. Sugar water. You just made a big mistake, blanquito. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay? I'm not a chemist. The guy I bought it from swore it was medical nitro. We both got screwed. But only one of us is gonna pay for it. Look, I just want to get out of here, and you want your payment. My brother's gonna be here soon. We'll work something out. Just name your price. I already named my price. You didn't come through. When's your brother getting here? You were planning on turning us in the whole time, weren't you? When's he supposed to meet you here?! Sueltalo. Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him. Let him go, or I'll shoot you. - Suelta la pistola. - Ey, no estoy jugando.</i> Sueltala, cabron! Quieto! - Where is it? - My father didn't give me anything. Who you risking your life for? Lincoln Burrows. Street thug. And why is that your concern? I mean, is there somewhere in the hippocratic oath where it says, "I pledge to risk my life for those who don't care about mine"? 'Cause they don't care about yours. Burrows and Michael Scofield just used you. Are you that surprised that there are people in the world who will stand up to people like you? Are you that far gone? That's cute. Sad, but cute. A Cleveland what? Don't worry, I'll talk you through it. And we got a glass coffee table right here. Hell no. I'll do it for a thousand. $500. $1,000. $750. All right. What the hell? Leave. You know, it's amazing what you can pick up at an army-navy store. All that torture stuff, that was Bellick's idea. And if you ask me, he took the whole thing way too far. Listen, why don't I just give you half the money, and we call it a day? All right, 60-40. Come on, T, we can deal. Where's the plane going to land? Kiss my ass, cobarde. What are we going to do? I don't know. We're not going to get across the border on the ground. Without that plane, we're screwed. He's losing too much blood. He'll never make it like this. He should have thought before he tried to kill us. We got to take him to a hospital, or else he'll die. Please. The plane, and we'll let you go. Dicelo. Dicelo todo. Dicelo ahora! Finley road... off of highway 8, - there's an airstrip there. - There, okay? - Now let us go. - Let's go. Michael, let's go. Please. Michael, let's go. Don't do this, please don't do this. Let's go. If we were bleeding he would have not lifted a finger, you know that. He was gonna kill us both. - Let's go. - No, that's not true. Michael, we're going to get to that plane... Let's go now, please. Please don't do this, okay?! Callate! Don't listen to him! I care about you. This is not what I wanted, Sara. What's going on with Sara? Has she told you anything? Don't go anywhere. Not yet. I trust you've been... persuasive. Yes, absolutely. Then kill her. Well, she knows something. You disobey me, you are done. Do you understand me? Put her in the ground, Paul. Let's go. Hold still. We're doing it wrong. Let's get out of here. He's gonna call the cops, or go get his buddies... he's not going to make it. We'll call them when we get safe. Let's go, Michael, let's go! Thank you. You got to get him to a hospital right away. Wait. Wait. Hey, man... forget Finley road. The plane is going to stop at the seven mile marker on route 4 at sunset. It's going to stop for five minutes. Then it's going to go to Oaxaca, Mexico. If you miss it, you're out of luck. He bled out on the way over. Any id? Yeah, Roy Geary, just an out-of-stater. You know him? He's a friend of mine. - Mr. Bellick? - Yeah. You mind answering a few more questions? It's Pam. What's going on? I just wanted to say hey. Well... are you all right? You said it was important. I know things got kind of ugly toward the... you know, the end. I got ugly. But I want you to know that, that there were circumstances that, uh... it was better that you and Cameron that you were not with me. Why are you telling me this now? If I had to do it all over again... I'd do it different. We'd still be a family. I'd give anything for that. I just wanted you to know. What's going on? Nothing. I just wanted to call to say that I was, uh... that I'm sorry about everything. Where are you right now? I can come get you. Wouldn't that be nice, huh? No, I'm serious. Where are you? One more thing. If you hear anything in the media... What? What are you talking about? I love you. Give Cam a kiss for me, okay? Well... I'm glad I told you about this place. I'm glad I figured out how to work a GPS. Could you make it a little more difficult next time? I owe you one. No, we're even. But we got to leave. Hey, buddy. How are you doing? - Where's LJ? - Safe. - The money? - I'll tell you later; we got to go. I brought someone. Dad? We've met before. This is happening right now, okay? Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. You wouldn't? Really? Are you that stupid? Are you that stupid?! Because now you're going to die! You're going to die, and all you had to do is tell me what your father gave you. I know my options. I can not tell you and die, or I can tell you and still die. No. Wrong. Come on, smarten up! For once in your life. Please. Go to hell. Drowning is horrific... don't get me wrong... but once you give in and let the water come into your lungs, there's a certain euphoria... I hear.
