without hurting anyone. I got an idea. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. Is your electricity out? Those cons are in one of these towns and couldn't have gone further than 64 miles in any direction. I want everything you've got in that perimeter. Well, to be honest... I was expecting to brief the president. You report to me now. Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address, are the charges facing your daughter.</i> Good to meet you, sir. Sara, do you remember that guy that I met with you in your apartment?</i> I want you to stay away from him. - What are you talking about? - I found out some other things too. Where is that? It's Holland. It's beautiful. And gas up the car. We'll meet you right back here in an hour. Put your hands behind your head and drop to your knees. Oh, God! Don't say a word, you old whore or I'm gonna cut your throat out. You try that again, I'll pry those vocal chords right out of your throat. She's coming up. What is she doing? She's coming up here. Stay there, stay there. Mom, you home? Stay here. Stay... Stay quiet. Mom? It's okay, it's okay! Back away and put your hands up. - Just go easy. - Go nothing. She ain't the one carrying the cards here. Back away and put your hands up. I put my hand up, I'll take her jugular with it. I don't want anyone to do anything stupid, okay? Don't move. Let's be civil. Stop. Relax. Free to go. Guy at the garden center said Burrows was strong as a gorilla. It was 1:00pm when they tangled it up. The guy IDed both of them. Scofield, Burrows. No doubt about it in his mind. Of course, given that was 1:00pm, those two could be 300 miles from here by now. You have a half a dozen picks, shovels and power tools missing from that store. They're here and they're digging. Five million dollars buried somewhere beneath the streets of Tooele. You really believe that? They believe that, and that's the important thing. They could be anywhere now. We don't have the units to go door-to-door. We won't need them. He's gonna tell us where to look. Transript: www.1000fr.com BLinda Synch: www.sub-way.fr So funny, I was just about to text you. - Today's your lucky day. - Is it? Yeah, my Aunt Maxine finally gave me her famous chocolate chip cookie recipe and if you're free tonight, I'd love for you to be my guinea pig. I can't. Not tonight. Come on. You sound just like Daniel. "Not tonight." - Not tonight. - You know what? If you don't mind, I've actually gotta go. Are you okay? I mean, your cart's empty. I'm good. Thanks. Just gotta go. Sara. This is going wrong in every possible way. This is stupid, man. We cannot do this. Hat's over the wall now. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I mean we committed. It's time to go get the hat. We don't have a choice. Yeah, we do. We can walk right up out of here right now, man. And then what? We are already in the house. Those women are bound. We have already committed this crime. We leave, it ain't gonna change any of that. Why couldn't it be just be a silo in the middle of a field with no one around? We'll figure it out. We can get the money another way. Yeah, maybe I can rob another bank. You know what Charles once said to me? He said there's no such thing as an ex-con. Because I used to think there was a way we could wipe the slate clean, make up for everything we've done. The hat's over the wall, Linc. For everyone. "Sorry" isn't gonna mean anything to you right now, but I want to say it anyway. This wasn't supposed to happen. One or two hours tops and we'll be out of here, and you have my word, no one will harm you. Keep your eyes open, okay? Nothing happens to them. Nothing. The doctor is suspicious. She should be. She was on the line with the governor when you walked up. You were listening. Both lines are tapped. We're not rookies. Did her father tell her what he found? Not over the phone. But he knows who you are, and so does she. Seeing how she was supposed to lead you to Scofield and to Burrows, it looks like we're back to square one. Not necessarily. There are other people they care about. The kid. L.J. In terms of the governor... Burrows' kid, Paul. Focus. Governor Tancredi's office. Please hold. Hey, is, is my father in please? Just a second. - Hey, Bruce. - Hi, Sara. I'm trying to get a hold of Dad. I need to reach him on his cell. He actually just landed. Wiil be home soon. I don't know if he's going to be in much of a mood to talk, though. Why? Your father got a call from the White House. They withdrew his nomination. What? I talked to him two hours ago. He didn't say anything about that. It just happened. According to them, his confirmation was going to be a problem. We had the votes, right? Super majority. Okay. So... President Reynolds pulled the plug on a sure thing in order to start over from scratch? How often does something like that happen in politics? Never. Since when did we become kidnappers? It ain't right. Well, we can buy a conscience tomorrow. Yeah, well, yeah. Closing your eyes ain't gonna make it go away. I'll take five minutes of a situation I can control over 50 years of one I can't any day. Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill. What's it like being with the African persuasion anyhow? You shut the hell up. Hit me a nerve. Why don't you get down in that hole and dig, man? Yeah. How about you backin' up, dark fella? You're a long way away from home, trailer park. I can put you in that hole, and nobody would ever hear you scream. Knock it off. We have security expert Marc Bruni with us who will explain</i> how other prisons are ensuring that they are not victimized</i> by the next Fox River Eight. Should be the Fox River Seven now that Abruzzi's taken his dirt nap. God rest the man's soul, of course. Speaking of numbers, we're short one. Kid's taken a long time to fill that gas tank up. Leaned on him in every way I can think of. He's... he's not talking. Are you Catholic? Are you Catholic? Not much good in it. Lot of guilt. But the one good thing is confession. Whatever you got eating at you, you just... give it up. Feels good, I have to say. Guess it's letting it out. Letting another human being hear it. I ain't got nothin' to say to you, man. What if I told you something? A secret nobody else knows. Oscar Shales... Guy I was chasing a few years back. Smart as hell. I... kept just missing him. It became kind of a game, like, chess. Would've almost been fun if it weren't for the fact that he was killing people all along the way. Bodies kept stacking up, and I started to feel that it was because of me. Because I couldn't do my job. Because I wasn't smart enough. Never did catch him, but I did lose him. I saw things when I would drive at night: bodies... nightmares to the point that I couldn't sleep. It... was a complete break from reality. That's what these little guys are for. To keep me in the game. So now you know. Now it's off my chest. Ought to try it sometime. Like I said before... I ain't gonna tell you nothin'. You know where those guys are. If you're looking for a rat, you got the wrong guy, man. Nah, I'm just trying to spare you some guilt. Bagwell was free less than 24 hours before he killed his first victim. If you don't tell me where he is now, he's gonna kill again, and that blood is gonna be on your conscience and nobody else's. Confession might not be such a bad thing, huh? - He just arrived, L.J. - That's impossible. I- I don't have a meeting scheduled with my lawyer. He's a court-appointed public defender in Illinois. I doubt he would come to Arizona without calling me. Let's go. Yeah. We're all set in Arizona with the Burrows kid.</i> Good. The kid's as good as gone. What'd you say the name of that lawyer was? Didn't give it to me. Gave it to the warden. Then I want to talk to the warden. Hey, you hear me? After. Hello, L.J. What do you want? They didn't tell you why I came here? I'm an ADA here in Mohave County. I'm here to serve you with these. What are those? Your release papers. - Hey. - Ms. Tancredi. - Is my dad in? - In his study. Great. Thank you. Dad? Help! I need my pill. Please, I need my pill. What? I need my pills. - Forget it. - No, you don't understand. I need them. They're for my baby. They're Metformin to prevent a miscarriage. Please. They're in the drawer in the kitchen. That one right there. - How many? - Two. And water. Please. You know I got to put the gag back on. Wait, before you do, I just have one more question. You seem like a really good guy. Why are you doing this? I'm not a good guy. ...and these changes, do you really think they'll help keep predators</i> like Theodore Bagwell safely behind bars?</i> Picture makes me look like a sociopath. I'm not joking with you, trailer park. Now, get in here and dig! I am incapable, thanks to all y'all. Just remember that my X marked the spot! You remember that. We got a bigger issue. The kid. How long's it been since he left? An hour and a half, could be. Hour and a half to fill a tank of gas? That ain't right. There's been a breaking development in the double homicide prosecution</i> of Lincoln Burrows Jr. Due to the sudden disappearance of crucial blood and...</i> Hey, Linc, I didn't know you had a boy. ...itself, the Cook County District Attorney's Office</i> had no choice but to drop all charges against the 16-year-old.</i> Burrows is scheduled to be released from the Klipton Detention Center</i> in Kingman, Arizona, where he's currently being held,</i> tomorrow morning. Keys to the car, where are they? Just hold on, okay? You can't do this. Linc. We are five minutes away in there. We've been five minutes for four hours. Just give me some time. Be patient. You think I care about the money? I'm doing what's necessary! You're afraid to fail, you're afraid this big plan of yours ain't gonna work out. You want to get caught proving you can pull this thing off, be my guest. L.J's out there, I'm gonna get him. We have come 1,500 miles across the country. We have made it this far. Then I guess this is where we part ways. Any word of how the interrogation's going?</i> Nah, the kid's still stonewalling, but we've got confirmation on Patoshik. His prints were all over that old lady's house. So he leaves the cash and the jewelry. The only thing he steals is a ten-dollar oil painting. What the hell does he want with that? Is there something I can help you with? What? No. You know, it'd be a little easier if you used the cart for all that stuff. I'm just... I wanted to... see if it'd all fit in the bag. What happened to your knee there? Motorcycle accident. So, uh... you don't move around too well, then, do you? Not really. That's good. You can still come with me. No, I can... I can do this. And if you can't? Then we still meet up - exactly where we planned. - Bolshee Booze. - Bolshoi. - Bolshoi. L.J's gonna be with me. You remember how to get there? Have I forgotten? Thursday night, 6:00. It's our last shot. If we're... If we do this right, we're gone, forever. Lot of ground to cover in three days. Lot of ground. Yeah. All right. Take care. They'll be gunning for you. They'll get you any way they can, so... Yep. Tell L.J... Tell him I said there'll be a surfboard with his name on it. Nice. Bolshoi Booze. Three days. Keep your head down. Ms. Tancredi... Hi. I just wanted to let you know that the ME, she's finished her preliminary examination of the body. She found no signs of foul play. I know it's a shock, but we've also spoken to the detail guard stationed outside and he didn't see anyone other than your father enter or exit the mansion since he came back from Washington. My father is not a suicidal man. Look, is there any extended family I should call? I'm an only child. My mother passed away. Could I have a moment, please? Yeah. That's a hell of a good deal, son. I mean, we're talking no additional time on your sentence for the escape. You want it in writing, I'll put it in writing. We will put you up at Club Fed and you'll spend your days playing racquetball with stockbrokers and lawyers. 4 years from now, you'll be out on the street, 22 years old with a clean slate and your whole life ahead of you, and no blood on your hands. Okay? There's a woman in the house. If you guys show up... it's just gonna turn her into a hostage. T- Bag... he ain't coming out alive. And he's gonna take her with him. Let me worry about that. No, hell, no. The only way that that woman comes out free is if someone shows up on that porch that they trust. Being you? Being me. You like... You like jerk... you like jerky? You like jerky. What were you in for? I don't want to talk, lady. I'm a prisoner in my own house. Least you could offer me is a little conversation. All right. Just let me know when I hit it. Murder? Rape? Kidnapping? Sexual abuse? Child sexual abuse? Aggravated robbery. How long were you doing? Five years. How much longer did you have left to serve? 18 months. Why on earth would you break out of prison with...? What's her name? It doesn't matter. So what, she was running away with another man? - Maybe you should have let her go... - She's having my baby. How far along is she? I don't wanna talk about it. I'm two months. I just had my first trimester sonogram on Tuesday. 10-5 Dispatch to all units. Has she shown you pictures of...? Transporting David Apolskis in F.B.I custody. Stand by.</i> Yo, this is going to take all day. We need more manpower. You know, standing around jabbering ain't gonna get the dirt out of that ground. All right, that's it! Son of a bitch! Now what? - We gotta roll. - Why? They got Tweener. It was on the radio. Nice knowing y'all. Did they say anything about where we are? I'm not hanging around to find out. Well, maybe you should. Maybe you should. Maybe we all should. Let's go over this again. None of them are armed? With guns? No. Bagwell had a screwdriver or something. - Do we really need this, man? - Yeah. In case you decide to do something stupid like tip them off. You know what's out there? Holland. I'm going to live in a windmill. All we need is a raft. I'm going to build it. I'll start with this... no, this stick. Charles Westmoreland, God bless you and your wrinkled old sack. It's all here. I owe you a profound thanks, pretty. A couple days from now, I'm gonna be walking down the streets of Bangkok with a million US in my pocket. That's about 40 million baht in the local currency. What the hell is up with you and Thailand? Black market surgery, anonymous transplant donors, "he's" dressed like "she"... what's there not to like? Are you really going to try to replace that hand? Body ain't takin' to this one. - Unbelievable. - All right, let's move. You know, that hand ain't gonna be white. - What? - The new one. Even if you get down there, it ain't gonna be white. Hey, Johnny KKK over here is gonna have an Asian hand. No mistakes. Let's get them clean. I need to know if I can trust him. They're escaping. Not man, let me out here, like... We had a deal, remember? Now walk. - Scott... - I don't got much time, all right. I had to tell you something. What you did for me that day at the motel... ...ain't nobody in my life has been to bat for me like that. And I lied to you. My name isn't Scott. My name is Dave. - Dave Apolskis. - Get down! Get Down! Now! And I just... I wanted you to know. I'll be writing you. And I sure as hell hope that you write back. Can I help you? I'm sorry. Do I know you? Contractor. We got some electrical issues. No, you can't help me. Excuse me. Is there a problem? Ms. Owens is not home. Yeah, well, I'm supposed to drive her to the club... She already went to the club. Yeah, she came out, said she was going to the club. She got into her car and left. I don't know what else to tell you. Yeah. Okay, thanks. He's gone. We got to get out of here. 'Cause once he gets to the club, he's gonna find out she's not there. Then he's going to be back. Know what? You were right. It does feel good to get stuff off your chest. I'm sorry I had to play you like that, bro. Yo, what's up? Come on. It's gonna be a long drive. Stretch your legs. All right. Kellerman. I thought you were going to deal with the L.J. Burrows situation.</i> Oh, I did. Then why is he being released from custody tomorrow? In and of itself, the kid is useless to us. His only value is in who comes looking for him. More importantly, though, Governor Tancredi... not part of our plan. Last time I checked, you left no shortage of bodies in your wake. No, I did what I had to do to get Caroline where she is. Now that she's there, let's not draw any more attention than we have to. You think getting to the top is the hard part?</i> She's a hundred times more visible, has a hundred times more enemies. Anyone who knows anything has got to be dealt with.</i> If someone is a liability, they go. Tancredi was becoming a liability. So is his daughter. Wait. What? Sara? Good bye, Paul. You walk out that door with those guys right now, and it's only a matter of time before you get caught. You realize that, don't you? You're not just gonna be dealing with escape charges, but assault, unlawful imprisonment, kidnapping... - I don't need to hear this right now. - Oh, no, you do. How much longer do you really think you can stay ahead of the cops? Look, if you turn yourself in, I will testify at the sentencing. I will say that you cooperated. That can make a huge difference. - Shut up. - Be smart. You have a baby on the way. Do you want to be around for its second birthday - or its 22nd? - Shut up. If you didn't wanna hear me out, if you didn't wanna hear that you're making a mistake, you would've gagged me again... Calla-te! Fernando! Time to go! You can still do the right thing, Fernando. Look-a-here. Look-a-here. Pocket change. In case you want to tip the valet when you're at the Ritz. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, boy. Where's Sucre? Right here. What are you doing? Drop the bag. No one's going anywhere. Just so you know, man, I'm not gonna roll on those guys. It ain't gonna happen, so... if that's what this is about... We were talking about confession earlier. And... I think I owe you an apology because I lied to you... ...about Oscar Shales. Smart-ass just kept pushing it, and I... I snapped. Right there. That's where I put the bullet in him. I don't care about none of this. Mistake about that is forensics will tell the whole tale. Powder burns. The gun was right against his head. Sir... We should go back to... That's what's good about confession, you know, 'cause you say something, you get it off your chest and... it just goes out there into the whole world. And I'm so sorry about this, kid, because I really hope you understand.
