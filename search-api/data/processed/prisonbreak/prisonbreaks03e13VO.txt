What did you do back, uh, in the states? I-I'm in sort of a transitional period right now. In between jobs. Sorry to hear that. yeah, we've all been there. I'm sure something will come up before long. I'm hoping it's right around the corner. you won't be needing this anymore. what's this for? you're gonna give me some real information on michael scofield. Or it's gonna be your funeral. I don't know where he is. I don't know how to reach him, I swear. Well, which one is it gonna be, papi? Hello, gretchen. Where's whistler? Over my right shoulder. You know, you're the first to ever break out of sona? Where are they? Bring them out. I've worked with a lot of intelligent people in this business, michael, but you... maybe you wouldn't have to worry about the company trying to kill you if you were on their side. They certainly pay well. There they are. Give me whistler and I will give you lj. If you move, you're dead. -It for hand-off. -Roger that. -What the hell is he doing? -I've lost him. This is not the point of the exchange. This is just a confirmation that everyone's still alive. They're alive.Let's trade. You'll get a call in five minutes telling you where to go next. And when the exchange is over and lj is safe, you and I are gonna spend some quality time. When the exchange is over, you better run for your life. open it. remove the tarp. i think i would have noticed it. someone had climbed on my truck... do i have to repeat everything i say to you? remove the damn tarp.or we;ll impound the truck. it;s fertilizer. just get out of here. go. -gracias, papa. -One more stop. there's a storm brewing out there in the yard. you tell them...come in.I'm not scared. Well, I am. You might want to put that down. oh, teodoro.You're the last one I'd expect to see at my side. I take offense, patron. I've had many foot-washers. Many men have come in with sheep's clothing,only to let the wolf come out. I am not trying to hurt you.I am trying to save you. Save me?I'm gonna die here. Your life is in jeopardy just being with me. Not necessarily. As I was being escorted back inside today, one of the guards offered us a chance to buy our freedom. If a guard spoke to you,he was lying.It's impossible to get out. maybe you've been too busy dying to notice,but there's a new colonel outside those gates. Little suzy sona ain't playing so hard to get no more.She has her price. And we gonna need some money. No.No. Then you will die in here. -michael. -The lobby of the museum of antiquities. Why? Because that's where whistler is. You're overthinking things. I've seen it too many times before. The first plan goes to hell and then you start tap-dancing, and, trust me, it always ends badly. You have five minutes. Unbelievable. You know what to do. -What's so funny? -You. Thinking you can outsmart my uncle. Walk. metal detectors. And here I thought we were building a circle of trust. Come to the southwest corner of the first floor. Fine. But that's it. No more stops on your guided tour. If I don't walk out of here with whistler, I'm gonna snap lj's neck. And yes, I can do it. Here we go. Is everyone in position? Roger that. Last bottle of rum. Good-bye, patron. How much do they want? 50,000. No. We're not in tijuana haggling over a blanket. We're talking about your life. Even if I could... find the money, who could I trust to bring it in? There is one person. How do you know james? You're working my last nerve.Move your ass. Relax. Everybody stays cool and we will all walk out of here. As soon as we get lj, you get whistler. But lj comes to us first. Go ahead. Lj. Thank god, you're safe. What about the coordinates? You said first thing you would do once you had whistler was to get the rest of the coordinates. Is she serious? I'll give her exactly what she wants when we get out of here. But darling, it's not safe.We need to go. I want to see them. Sofia, come on. Let's get outta here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sofia. You wrote those numbers on a piece of paper. I gave her half at sona.I promised to give her the other half now. I know what I said, and we'll discuss it later.Come on. Welcome to the real world. I'm sick of jumping through hoops to keep your princess in a bubble. -It is time to go. -This is between us. Where are the coordinates, susan? There are no coordinates. Sofia. Come on. Sofia. Sofia. James. Stop kidding yourself. It's time to leave. And what the hell are you still doing here? If I were you and I couldn't bring weapons inside, I'd have agents at every exit ready to shoot as soon as we stepped outside. Well,then it really doesn't matter what exit you take,does it? I'm gonna go out that door. Maybe you should take that door. Actually,that door is locked in the event of an emergency. What emergency? This one. we're all walking out of here. together. that's very dramatic,calling the cops on yourself. You must really want to go back to sona. They're not looking for a con,gretchen,they're looking for a thief. Whatever I told you,it was always to protect you. You'll understand,if you just let me explain. Lie down all this because I knew michael scofield? Tell me where he is. I don't know! Lie down now! even if I knew... yes? All right. It'll be here shortlY. now that we have the money,how do we get it to the guard? We don'T. What do you mean,we don't? We-we-we were supposed to bribe the guard-- that was the plan! This is the plan. This is business. And you,of all people,should understand. Help me hold him down. What the hell you talking about? Do it. Do it! Teodoro... teodoro... teodoro... It's just a matter of time,anyway. but from one thief to another... out of respect,make it quick. If you don't fight me,I will. adios,homey. over here. Whistler: What's the problem? I found this in his pocket. Would you care to explain this? I've got no idea what it is. It's plastic. It's from the gift ship. Now,if you'll excuse us. What? - Stay where you are. - Why? Where is your identification? sofia! We need an ambulance at the Museum of Antiquities sofia! Dad,dad... you can't do this. You can't do thi the cops are gonna start asking questions. We gotta go. ******** What are you gonna do,james? You go back there,you'll get arrested,and that won't do any of us any good. I ought to kill you right now for what you've done to her! Enough! I did what I had to do to get you out,period! You remember what's at stake,james. We're moving. stop the van. I can't leave her. She already left you. Lj: Dad! ****** Dad,you've got to go!

Lechero... he's... - he's really... - Yeah. How do you want me to give you this? The guards,they won't let me in anymore. I only want what I asked for. Hold on to the rest for a few days. If you were to consider leaving with all that,well... I just want you to know I'd be very cross with you. I've been known to have a bit of a temper problem... when betrayed. No. A deal's a deal. You've done so much for me. You have my word. Wait. no,no. It's okay. I'll wait for you. ACANDI.COLOMBIA You ready? iBiONVENIDO LUIS! My angel I'm all right Where is michael scofield? Where is michael scofield? This isn't working A few minutes more--- Pull him out of there Toss him inside If it's him... you're gonna find out where they are,or i'm gonna answer it myself, so they can hear you scream when I blow your head off. hello? Sucre. Thank god. When you didn't show up at the boat,I... I'm really sorry about that,papi. I got into a little bit of trouble here at work. Michael: Are you all right? Yeah. Where are you? You guys get lj? Yeah. He...he's fine. What about linc? Is he okay? He's fine. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. It all worked out. I'm about to catch the bus,papi. Take care. Kill me if you want. Wrong,papi. You're gonna wish we had. Lechero is dead! T-bag: Lechero is dead! I come before you now to bury the man... not to praise him, for there is nothing praiseworthy about his rule here. Having one of our own dictate to us? Well,that's just not the natural order. All cons are equal! I have the last remnants... of lechero's cruel empire in my hand. An empire which I willingly participated in and witnessed first-hand. Money... made off of your backs and off the backs of your family! It's yours. And I'm here to tell you,I'm giving it back. Welcome home,papi. T-bag! T-bag!..... We're all equal We are all equal she's gonna be okay. Good. uncle mike,um... I wanted*****but... I found this in the room where sara and I were held. I thought you might want to have it. I'm sorry. Thanks. How's sofia doing? - She's good. - Good. The cops will be leaving soon. - You can go up and see her,then. - Good. She wanted me to tell you something. She said there's something in her apartment underneath her bed. Something about whistler. I'm not interested. What is it? Michael,this is over. It's done. I said,"what is it?" You're late. And you owe him for my drinks. Give us a minute? It's a nice tip. She handles the money. You in? She'd better be able to handle a lot more than that. Because if she has done what you think she has-- sara-- ... she's the weak link. And he will find her. And then scofield will find you... and me. And I'm not paying for your mess. Are you in or are you out? I'm in. - linc? - Yeah. I need your gun. Thanks. "Jason lief." You heard of this guy? SURVEILLANCE REPORT No,but if he's important to whistler,he's important to me. Whoa,slow down,michael. I get to whistler,I get to gretchen. No,no,no,no. This is the one chance you,me and lj have of sticking toge... they killed sara,linc. I'm sorry about that. You know... listen,man,I... I did everything I could,you know. Everything. I know you did. But I gotta go. thanks. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:ÌÇÌÇ ÈâÈâ</font>
