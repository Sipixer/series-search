Maybe you'd like something a little bit more exciting,huh? Like Attica. My neighbors are renovating their apartment. One of the workmen left his radio on. Hip-hop is not conducive to sleep. Whoa,are you allowed to put that many men in one cell? Cut the warden a little slack,okay,Bones? There was a riot. The cell doors open automatically in a fire. The guards had to subdue the inmates so the firefighters could do their jobs. Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa. You stay close.Okay? A lot of these animals haven't seen a real woman since Reagan was president. Body's in here. You sure this is Howard Epps? This was his cell. Why not keep him on death row? We don't have one. He was transferred to Bayview so he could be closer to he courthouse for his trial. The victim is male. Approximately 30 years of age. He matches Epps general size and build. Contortion indicates a painful death. Well,after killing four teenage girls that we know about- it's just what the doctor ordered. It seems as if someone threw accelerant on him, lit him on fire. Hey,look,any idea who would want him dead? All the inmates hated him. Once the fire started,it was chaos. Could have been anyone. Booth... this is the wrist I broke. - So? - So,this break is fresh. So,Bones- they break in a fire,right? Yes,but... there's no sign of a prior break. This man's wrist was slammed against a hard edge within the last few hours. What are you saying? This is not Howard Epps. That's impossible. Look,all your prisoners- are they accounted for? They are if this is Epps. What about the guards? They've all reported in. - Whoa... - What now "whoa"? This dye from the tattoo survived the fire. DC Fire Department. He was a firefighter. You're saying the fireman comes in to save Epps, but Epps kills him,takes his uniform, and sets him on fire. And walks right out the front door. Son of a bitch. Lock this place down now. Yeah,it's Booth. Listen,I need you to close off a 30 mile radius of the Bayview Federal Penitentiary. Howard Epps escaped. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> Sync: YTET-???? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Bones Season 2 Episode 12 ks short,don't you think? Is that important? You were supposed to say no. But you are short. And the article describes you as robotic. And wildly intelligent. Did you really call me "The heart of the operation"? Yeah. That was before you called me "short. " Hey,Zack called you short. I think you're just the right height. Yeah? Short men have better leverage. I'm feeling uncomfortable. Any answers? Hope you enjoyed your 15 minutes of fame,people, 'cause we have a psycho on the loose so it's back to work. I photograph well. Okay,so what have we got? The accelerant was distilled alcohol. Fractures are consistent with Dr. Brennan's theory. The victim's wrist was broken to match Epps injury. A blow to the head rendered him unconscious. He was then set on fire. If there was ever anyone who should be in Gitmo... I agree. But he's not,he's out. And that means more victims unless we stop him first. Which we will do,or they'll be another article written about us that won't be so kind. Where's Dr. Brennan? She and Booth are talking to Epps's wife. I.D. the remains. I'm no longer involved in Howard's life. That's hard to believe,being his wife and all. Ex-wife. The judge signed my divorce papers last month. Why didn't it work out exactly? Was it a lack of quality time or all the women he bludgeoned to death? I thought I could help Howard,but he used me. I haven't had any contact with him in over six months. Well,I'd like to place you in protective custody until we find him. That won't be necessary. Mrs. Epps,the women in Howard's life don't tend to live very long. I appreciate your concern,Dr. Brennan, but I've changed jobs,apartments. We found you. Howard could,too. I have a new life... and a new boyfriend. Raymond's a good man. If he found out... We all have secrets in our past,Mrs. Epps. Admittedly not as bizarre as yours, but you shouldn't risk your life to tell your boyfriend the truth. Howard's interest is in young blonde girls. I'm not even his type. If he contacts you... I'll call. Wait,you can't let her go. She's not safe. I can't force her to take protection,all right? I'll have the local police,you know, drive by her house every couple hours, make sure she's safe. And you know what,you're not safe either. But I'm not unhinged. I can take care of myself. You and Epps- okay,it's personal. You're everything that he hates. What is that exactly? Well,you know,you're a smart,strong,confident woman. And you figured him out,you made him feel powerless. So he's going to want to prove that you're weak and inferior. So,you are not to go out on your own ever. Hey,did the wife give you anything? Chills. I need you to double security here at the lab. You think Epps is going to come after Brennan? I can't rule anything out when it comes to Epps. I'll take care of it. Look,I don't want you to be alone either. Are you inviting me over? I'm just thinkinthat everyone should just stay here at the lab. Leave it to a serial killer to spoil the mood. Whatever security you think is enough... You double it,Camille. I'm glad you're on my side,Seeley. The burn victim is Donald Kent,a decorated firefighter. Epps would appreciate the irony. Kent was still alive when he was set on fire. How many victims does that make? Seven... that we know of. And they aren't just young blonde women anymore. No,they aren't. He's such a monster. He's killed from behind bars and new victims keep turning up, and now he's out. We will find him,Ange. We're ready this time. I'm not. Look,I have some sick days coming. And I was thinking that since Epps makes me sick,that... We need you,Ange. Hodgins certainly does. That was low. I know. Did it work? How do you deal with the fear? I... have this. Oh,my... That... that think is huge. Whoa,wow,that's like movie huge. Where the hell did you get that? - The mall. - The mall? Yeah,it's pretty big,right? Bigger than the one you have. Excuse me,it's not the size,that matters, it's how you use it. Well,I think size is pretty important. The point is that you shouldn't have a gun in the first place. If you do have one,bigger is always better. You're not helping. Right,yeah,this does seem like a private conversation. Yeah,private. Okay,you know,people see you with that, the next thing you know everyone in this place is going to start packing. This is America- get used to it. Brennan. I'd forgotten how nice it was to breathe fresh air. We will find you,Howard. We'll see. I can't tell you how nice it is to be out of that stupid orange jumpsuit. I mean,I have a IQ of 180,for God's sake, and they had me dressed like a pumpkin. You burned a man alive. Means to an end. Everything is a means to an end,Dr. Brennan. I thought it was just women you were after. I felt the need to grow as a human being. What is it you want? You must want something or you wouldn't be calling. Yes. I want you to know that everything that happens from here on in is your fault. What's going to happen,Howard? I can't answer all of your questions. Use your head,Dr. Brennan. Use your head. Okay,we got it. He's in a pay phone at Water Street and 23rd. Bus stop. Three different lines. They run through here. I want you to check every bus stop. See if there are any witnesses- bring them to me. Booth,Epps left us sething. What is that? It's bone. Shaved down by a rough sandpaper. Hodgins found mica grit. I'll tell you this. If Epps comes near Angela,I'll kill him. What about the rest of us? Everyone will be fine. Cam increased security. And you have the big gun. Tough to keep that one a secret. Beautiful woman with a weapon? Very Guns And Ammo summer issue. I'm gonna concentrate on my work now. Osteon count places the victim's age as mid-30s. I'll run amelogenin and nuclear DNA tests to get sex and race. I got the chemical breakdown. The powders in the bone are organic. A mixture of cardamom,tamarind and kokam. - Spices? - Yeah. Bone wasn't cooked. Why would he add spices to it? Epps like puzzles. The spices are a message. Angela! Oh,my god! What happened? A heart. Definitely human. Adult. DNA can give us sex. He's killed two people today. That's if this heart's from the same victim as the bone dust. What is that? It's a D.C. Sentinel article about the lab. Every line is blacked out except for one. "Dr. Hodgins called Angela 'The heart of the operation. '" Son of a bitch. You'll have to stay in here,Angela. How did this even get in here? I thought that there was security. So did I. I'll take care of it. He's coming after me through my friends. What? He told me whatever happened would be my fault. Then we'll make sure nothing else happens. There are cut marks on both sides of the inferior vena cava and connecting arteries. The heart was cut out using shears or scissors. Package was delivered by a bike messenger. He said a man matching Howard Epps's description approached him on L Street,paid cash. He's just playing with us. Not for long. How's Angela? Angry. She sisted on helping me,which worked out well. She realized the present Epps gave us was a recipe. - Wait,the heart? - No,the ingredients in the vial. After he ground up the bone,Epps mixed it with spices. The cardamom,tamarind and kokam which are all used in making curries. Indian food. Epps's wife. The last address we had for her was in Little India over a curry restaurant. You know,I could have the Bureau pull your license. Yeah,I and could assign Zack as your forensic anthropologist. Place hasn't been rented since she moved. It's just not logical. Playing games with us? It's just going to lead us right to him. Wait. If the lights are off,then why is the refrigerator working? Just stand back. ????????? ?????just above the shoulders. The jagged marks on the bone indicate that Epps used some kind of saw to decapitate her. No sign of blunt-force trauma to the skull, Epps's usual M.O. No clear cause of death. Without the rest of her body, we can't know for sure how she died. I'm seeing some kind of white powder in her hair. Hodgins can tell us what it is. Why just leave her head? To get us all involved. I mean,the less we have to work with, the more we're all drawn in. Epps told me to use my head. Everything he says is a clue. Could it be inside the head? It's too early to tell. What do you mean,"Too early," okay? All we do is just cut open the damn head and find out what's inside. But there are protocols,Booth. Yeah,and I'm sure Epps is really concerned about the protocols. This is my autopsy. We're gonna do it by the book. That means surface exam,followed by X rays, after which I will open the skull. Sorry,I'm just a little anxious to get the little gerbil back in his cage,that's all. Okay,that's terrifically disturbing. What? Massive blood aspiration to the soft tissue of the neck. Meaning? Caroline Epps was alive when Howard cut her head off. Now he's torturing his victims. So let's torture him. How? Bring his mother in. I thought Epps hated his mother. His FBI profiler believes he was emotionally attached to her. Prison log show that he wrote to her almost every day. - That's sick. - But helpful. I mean,if he feels responsible,for his mother being in jail, we could knock him off his game. What's that smell? It's mold. It grows in the fat creases of morbidly obese people. What is this about? Did you bring me here to make fun of me? I merely stated a fact,Mrs. Epps. You need to lose weight. Obesity also causes diabetes,heart damage,liver failure, not to mention the wear it puts on your joints. I have a glandular condition. A little compassion and understanding, that's what I really need. Why am I here? We found some drugs at your place. Those are my pills. My doctor gave them to me. I need my medicine. Well,you know,they're not properly labeled. This could take us a few days to sort this out with your doctor. We're looking for Howard,Mrs. Epps. Howard's in jail. I haven't seen him or talked to him in years. Howard escaped yesterday. Oh,dear Lord. I tried to raise a good son. Tried to keep him pure like the Good Book says. I don't know what happened. He was such a sweet child. Howard- he wrote to you all the time. He wants me to understand. Wants me to forgive him. Says he's still my little boy. But I don't answer. Your son murdered his wife yesterday; beheaded her. And you want to blame me? You made your son bathe in ammonia. The women he would go out with,they were loose. Not the right kind for a God-fearing son. I wanted him to wash their scent off. Is there anything else that you can tell us that might help us find your son before he kills again? It's not my fault what he did. Yeah,okay. Uh,that's all for now. We'll have an agent escort you back to your cell. Um,of course,you have the right to an attorney. I should have been harder on him. Beat him more regular. But I'm a nice person. Too nice. What's my problem? Too nice. Marianne Epps is clearly a bad mother. You think? But a lot of people have bad mothers and they don't grow up to be serial killers, which is why I don't put much stock in psychology. Listen,Bones,I don't care how you explain it,all right? The guy,he's an animal. He's got no conscience. I don't know how one draws moral distinctions between killers. Listen,Bones,there are crimes of passion,all right? Crimes committed out of desperation, which are usually followed by remorse, or an acknowledgment of human failing. The key word here is "human. " The reasons for killing someone are unimportant. The life that's taken is all that matters. You can't blame yourself here. It's me he's after. Angela and everyone else,they shouldn't be involved. It's not your fault,all right? It's all Epps,which is why I'm going to take this little bastard down. Booth. Booth,we're being followed. Mm-hmm,that's right. Two agents all the time,at a very discreet distance. See,I don't care how big your gun is,all right? Booth. Something was inserted in Caroline's ear. Epps made an incision in Caroline's left ear canal, inserted a token for a kid's ride from a place called Hillside Park. Oh,... My son plays there every day after school. Parker comes here every day at 4:00 with his nanny. Rose,Rose,Rose,where's Parker? On the merry-go-round. He was just there. Parker! Parker! Parker!Parker! Parker? Parker?! Parker? Parker! Parker? Parker! Booth! Parker? Parker! Parker! Daddy! Hey,come here. Oh,my... All right. Look,a man bought me ice cream. That was my favorite! I'll buy you another one,okay? Just listen to me. What did this man look like? A man. Said he was your friend. What did he say to you? Did he say anything else to you,Parker? To use my napkin. Booth. My name is Parker,Ask me how I can solve this case All right,what else did he tell you? Nothing. He was just nice. Okay,just listen to me,Parker,all right? This man is trying to hurt Daddy's friends,okay? So I need you to think. What else did he say to you? I didn't do anything wrong. He said he was your friend. You never talk to strangers,okay? You never! I'm sorry,buddy. It's okay,all right? I'm sorry. What's going on,Mr. Booth? It's just an investigation going on,okay,Rose? I have these agents take you and Parker home and keep you safe,all right? I'm sorry. It's okay. No. I didn't say anything. You've been in here every ten minutes since they left. I will let you know when I'm finished. I could take the head and X-ray it. Then you could finish... No. We have these protocols for a reason. Saroyan. Have you opened the head yet? I just finished telling Zack... Listen,Epps went after my kid,Cam. Parker. You know there's something there- he told us. It's something we need. He wants us to find it. You're upset. Of course I'm upset! Listen,I know there are protocols, but he could've killed my son. Get me the number two saw. I found some bruising to the back of her head. I'm gonna cut below it so I don't disturb the area. I hate this part. Me,too. Dr. Saroyan! Protocol! ??? Unknown hazardous material. We need an emergency medical team at the autopsy lab,A.S.A.P. - What happened? - I don't know,I don't know Dr. Saroyan! Her heart rate is erratic. There's clotting in the kidneys. - How bad is that? - Bad enough? But what worries us more is the lung damage. The toxin's caused edema. What does that mean? I don't know what that means. Fluid build-up. Essentially,she's drowning. I'm sorry. If she has family nearby,you'll want to send for them. Yeah,C-Cam's got a lot of family. How much time does she have? Send for her family. Zack saw everything. - How close was he? - A few feet. And he's fine,so it's probably not a toxic gas. Zack says it was some kind of powder, which means there could be traces on her clothing. Just work fast,okay,Hodgins? Just work fast. Considering the relationship between you and Cam,I... I'd like to say the right thing,Booth. I don't know what it is. Usually,I...I'd ask you or Angela. You just said it. Thanks. Can't find any traces of powder on Cam's clothing. - Did you search electrostatically? - Yes. - You're sure it was a powder? - Yes. - It had to be a gas. - If it were a gas,I'd be in the hospital with Cam. No particles on her clothing. Zack,it had to be a gas. It wasn't. Are we having an argument? - Of course. - Why? Because Cam's dying,and I should be with Angela, and because there are no particles. - On the clothing. - That's right. What about in the glass parts still left in the head? I'm not angry at you anymore. Hey. Welcome back. Why can't I breathe? Your saw,it,um...hit some kind of poison, but,uh...you're gonna be all right. - Zack? - Oh,he's fine. 'Kay,everyone... everyone's good. I'm-I'm...I'm so sorry,you know, that I put so much pressure on you to hurry. I didn't,uh... Mm-mm.Not your fault. Epps... did this to me. Hey.Your family's coming. Oh,... And I thought poison...was my biggest problem. You look exhausted. What have you got? Ok,This is an X ray of Caroline's head. These are shards of glass. Very fragile. What was it? I think it was a glass capsule... filled with a poisonous powder. Epps inserted it after she was dead Probably up the nose. And when the saw blade hit it,it exploded. Hodgins has some of the shards now. He'll figure out what the poison is. If I were Epps,I would've made it something that changes composition after prolonged exposure to air. Let's hope he's not as smart as you. I'm gonna go sit with Cam for a while. Brennan. So,who'd I get? Epps. If you're talking about the bulb in Caroline's head... we removed it. How'd you get it in there without breaking it? I saw the emergency vehicles. I know I got someone. They may not be dead yet,but they will be soon. Sorry. You missed this time. If you don't admit to who it was, then I can't give you the hint to save their life. Okay,then,it was nice talking to you. Wait.Wait. Yes,Dr. Brennan? Dr. Saroyan. She tried to remove the bulb with forceps. It was too fragile. It snapped. Yes,that's exactly what happened. Now will you tell me the poison? The body knows what the head can't say. roline's body or your mother's body? My mother? Yes,we have her in custody- didn't you know? On what charges? What poison,Howard? You had no right. My mother's not part of this. You tell me about the poison, and I will tell you about your mother. You don't run the game. I run the game. You're gonna be sorry. Cell phone,downtown. There's a team on its way. He's already gone. Hey. Hodgins find the poison? Not yet. How's Cam? She's worse. She can't breathe on her own. Uh... Bones, I really need you to find out what she inhaled. - Epps called and... left me a clue. - What is it? He said "The body knows what the head can't say. " - Caroline's body. - I think so. Yes. You were right,he was pretty upset when he found out that we had his mother. You told him? That's good. Make the bastard sweat. He said we'd be sorry. I'll call you as soon as we have something to go on. Bones... I'm c-coming with you,all right? Hold on,all right? This is gonna take all of us. If I put too small a sample into the photoelectric aerosol sensor, then I'll both lose the sample and not get an accurate response. I estimate that there's about one-ten-thousandth of a gram on this shard. We're not getting enough. Not to mention the particles themselves are extremely small, about 1.6 micrometers in diameter. Hey,what's the poison? I don't know yet. Well,what-what do you know? It's none of the common poisons: arsenic,cyanide,mercuric chloride. Let's start bytelling the hospital  what it isn't,then,okay? What was in Caroline Epps's hair? The white powder? Just common plaster dust. There was also a very small amount of sodium hydrosulphide in her ear. Great. Put those two things together,what do we have? Dry-walling and... Uh... uh,leather goods? Great. I'll look through the evidence and see if I can find those two things. Booth. What? I'm sorry,man. Without more material,it's just... No,it's... you're both doing a great job. Now it's up to me to find Caroline Epps's body. Booth. What? We've endowed Epps with intelligence he does not have. His clues are unsophisticated word games. Yeah? Uh,"My name is Parker. Ask me how I can solve this case. " I already asked Parker- he doesn't know anything. It doesn't have to be your son. It can be something else named Parker. Something to do with leather goods or drywall. Do a Boolean search. Okay,right,you don't know what that is. Boolean is... I won't explain; I'll just do it. I am walking out of here. You try and stop me again,I will shoot both of you. Mmm... What? I really need him to come back. Booth! Whatever you got better be worth dying for. Uh... There's a Parker & Parker Leather Goods owned by the Parker brothers on Parker Street in the town of Parker just outside of Arlington. That's a lot of Parkers. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Grab your boss and let's get going. Come on. Clear! Okay. Uh,uh,uh. How do we even know that's Caroline's body there? It it isn't,it'll still be a clue. Okay,let me do this,all right? Jam all the frequencies. If he's got a remote detonator,it ain't gonna work now. No sign of trip wires. There it is on her stomach,the poison just like Epps said. - I'll just... - No,Zack! No. Don't hesitate. Put your palm on the stomach and press down. What? That was a pressure trigger. The body is booby-trapped. Everybody out! Roger that. Egress. Let's go. What do I do? Don't be scared. I'm not scared. I- I just need to know what to do Out.I want to help him. Out. Now! Zack,uh... This,uh... This is gonna hurt. You or me? Mostly you. Okay,on three, I want you to jump back as high as you can. I'm not a good jumper. Be a good counter. I am a good counter. Ready? On three. One... One... Two... Two... Three... The explosion occurred as FBI agents searched the shop for escaped serial killer Howard Epps. At least one pson was killed in the blast. Dr. Zack Addy,a forensic anthropologist who was working with the FBI,died at the scene. Special Agent Seeley Booth remains in critical condition. Okay,that's creepy. Zack dead and me in critical condition,right? Why? It's not true. Let's just hope Epps buys it. You going to be all right? My doctor said most of my injuries didn't come from the explosion. but from being slammed into the floor. Apparently you're extremely strong. Did you have to be ||so rough on him? It was a bomb. I was being,you know,heroic. I was heroic,too. Yes,you were. Somebody saved somebody,that's all I'm saying. I got the poison. Which is good,because Caroline's body was blown to pieces. That was good thinking,you know,you keeping your wits. But what I did was... I guess if you have to explain to yourself why you're a hero, I guess you're not really a hero. What the hell are you? You're not a bacterial protein or a non-opioid analgesiac. You're not a neurotoxin or a heavy metal. You act like chloromethane, but Zack said that there was no sweet smell when the powder was released. Are you talking to the evidence? Just working through this as systematically as possible. You know,when this whole thing is over, I am moving to a doorman building, I'm getting an unlisted number and I am hiring a full-time bodyguard named Knuckles. Don't get paranoid. That's funny,coming from a conspiracy theorist. Of course,Methyl bromide. I'll call the hospital. Methyl bromide mixed with plaster dust. That's what made it so hard to isolate. Well,what's the treatment? Racemic epinephrine. I called the hospital. They're starting an IV. Shouldn't you be there for that? Priorities in life,man. One,be there when someone you love comes back from the brink of death. Two,catch the serial killer. Everything after that is basically unimportant. I'm gonna go see Cam at the hospital and you're gonna go home and get some sleep. Why can't I go home? Didn't you just hear what they said on the news? You're dead. What about Epps? I got an entire surveillance team outside your house watching you. Why does everyone question me? I'm the hero. Why is it taking so long? It's not.She's responding. - Camille? - Seeley. - Don't call me Seeley. - Don't call me Camille. How are you feeling,babe? Like I got poisoned by a disembodied head full of plaster dust. Plaster dust. Everything is secure. Agent Holtz will stay in the hallway, and there'll be another agent in the lobby. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Check the apartment next door. Dead end. You won't let me shoot him,will you? You knew he was gonna be here,didn't you? It's the only scenario that made sense. Oh. Were you heading for the balcony,Howie? Hope you can fly 'cause that's about a 50-foot drop,right? Yeah. How did you know? Plaster dust in the poison. Renovations to the apartment next door. You're not all that smart,it turns out. One minute. All I want is one minute alone with you. Fine with me. Don't provoke the lunatic,all right? You got nowhere to go. I'm not going back to jail. You see,that's really not your decision,Howie. Put your hands up. Drop the crowbar. I'm in the line of fire,Bones. You're not getting away,Howard. Look who the killer is now,Agent Booth. Can I have a little help here,Bones? I got nothing but dead weight here. Help me. Sorry,I can't reach. Grab the railing. You're gonna drop me anyway. Just get it over with. You son of a bitch. Are you saying you don't want me dead? Yeah,I'm not you. Oh,really? You're not thinking of the world with me still in it? Going after Dr. Brennan. Your son. Unit on the ground saw what happened. So did the sniper across the street. You tried to save him. Yeah. No one could have helped him. Yeah. You can take off now,Booth. The department might want to assign you a shrink, on-the-job death like that. You didn't have your full strength. Your wrist was hurt from pulling Zack away from the explosion. My wrist wasn't hurt,Bones. I wish you'd let me shoot him. No,you don't. Oh,Parker,I'll put you... No,Daddy,I don't want to get on. Up. Up. There you go. Hi. How'd you know I was here? Saturday morning. How's Parker? Yeah,I'm afraid I freaked him out the other day. He's really scared of this place. Now I... I gotta put that right. That's you all over. Putting things right. Cam gets released from the hospital today? Yeah. What? You know,what happened to Cam happened because... we had a personal relationship. "Had"? Yeah. People who work in high-risk situations, they can't be involved...romantically because it...leads to... things like what happened. High-risk situations. Every single day,it's with us. There's this line,and we can't cross it. You know what I'm saying? Yes.I understand.
