Mr. Addy, your dissertation is entitled... "Analysis of Bone Trauma." When viewed in cross section, the pressure and force... exerted by the weapon can be assessed. Obtaining the cross section will compromise the original bone. My technique preserves bone surface morphology... through the use of polyvinyl replication. A transparent positive is made by covering the impression... with an aqueous solution of synthetic polymer. Hey, Bones. Come on. We got a body. Went up like a Roman candle. - Hey, Zack. How's it going? - So far, they don't like me. - Shocker. Let's go. - <i>[Brennan] I'm in the middle of something.</i> You know, real-life murder and mutilation versus academic claptrap, no contest. - Sorry. No offense. - This committee can carry on without you, Dr. Brennan. - Zack, just answer the questions. - [Booth] Yeah. [Booth] Okay, come on. Next question? How do you expect anyone to take you seriously... as a working forensic anthropologist... when you look the way you do? What? - <i>[Brennan] Male, middle-aged.</i> - <i>What was with Zack back there?</i> Defending his dissertation. Last step before he gets his doctorate. I think these are what's left of his intestines. - Is he gonna make it? - No. He's very dead. [Chuckles] - I mean Zack. - Ah, 50-50. - He's a stoolie. - Zack? Our victim. No, he's a rat, a snitch. - What makes you say that? - His guts got spilled. - <i>You know, spill your guts.</i> - <i>Very literal.</i> Hung up there like a scarecrow on a rooftop of a hotel used to house witnesses. It's a warning. There's something jammed down his trachea. [Zack] I rectified their erroneous assumptions concerning polyvinyl replication. You corrected them? - Only when they were wrong. - [Chuckles] Are the remains ready for X-ray? Yes. Maybe we'll get lucky and I.D. the poor bastard that way. Oh, wejust got lucky. "My name is Garrett Delaney." There's something metallic here. This is gonna turn out to be some freaky, weird ritualistic thing, isn't it? Oh, man, I hope so. Christopher Columbus. - Where's Dr. Brennan? - Her brother came for a visit. Dad called you? You're sure it was him? He said, " You and your sister are in danger," and he hung up. I spend half my time with a sniper-trained F.B.I. agent. I feel safe. Tempe, I know someone is watching me. - What's your evidence? - I can feel it on the back of my neck. You spend some time in jail, you develop a sixth sense. - Maybe you should stay with me for a few days. - Tempe, I have work. - I have Amy and the girls. - What about your sixth sense? - Hey! - What? You can't not believe in something one second... - <i>and then use it against me in the next.</i> - It's a long drive. You could start fresh tomorrow. And I've got... cold beer in the fridge. Don't drink the Moroccan beer. Tastes like ear wax. How you doing, Russell? - Okay, Booth. You? Good? - Yeah. Good. I still make him nervous, don't I? Come on. Let's go. Why do I always feel like you're abducting me? [Booth] Yeah. It turns out our corpse is a former F.B.I. agent. Garrett Delaney, he left the F.B.I. about 15 years ago. He's now head of security of some big K Street lobbyist. So why'd he end up a human torch? That's what we're here to find out. His place is much better than yours. Ten times better. I told you he left public service. He makes, uh, more money than I. So that's all your dad said, huh? - <i>Is you're in danger?</i> - Yes. - And Russ's sixth sense agrees. - What are you doing? I've been practicing some of the black ops stuff you taught me. Let me show you. Every F.B.I. agent in the country is looking for my father. Maybe he's trying to scare us off. Six months without a break in the case, he ain't gonna be nervous. - Now let me show you. - My dad's a career criminal. Just because he says that Russ is in danger doesn't mean it's the truth. Let me show you how it's done, okay? [Kicks Door] Oh. He might've gotten it right this time. [Brennan] Russ. These are all pictures of Russ. Me at work, me and Amy. This was the day before yesterday. Dad was right. Somebody's watching. - This is worse than watching. - What do you mean? - This is hunting. - Hunting? As in kill. You see these? Right here. These are ranges. He's picking out a spot from which to shoot at you. - So what do I do now? - The hunter's dead. The hunt is over, right? - Anyone else know you're here? - Only Amy. Great. Call Amy and tell her if anyone calls looking for you... she doesn't know where you're at. You should stay with me until we find out why Delaney intended to kill you. - How are you gonna do that? - By figuring out who killed him. [Angela] This is the paper that was pulled from Delaney's throat. It was dated, signed, and initialed at the bottom ofboth sides of the page. February 1978. It looks like a cop's notebook. - That makes sense except... - <i>[Typing]</i> "I will not put an innocent man in prison just because he is a political threat. Marvin Beckett hasn't broken any law." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Marvin Beckett? Back in the '60s, Marvin Beckett was a civil rights activist. He made his bones protesting... African American overrepresentation in the Vietnam War. - In '78, he was sent to prison for life. - Why? He killed an F.B.I. agent named Gus Harper. - Wait. Augustus Harper? - Yeah. You know the case? "A ugust Harp." Look. Augustus Harper. Oh, wow. This means Delaney's murder has something to do... with Marvin Beckett going to prison. Oh, when you're good, you are very, very good. 1970s, Ohio. There is a task force made up of F.B.I., state police, and local cops. It goes bad. Starts taking a cut from the same bank robbers they're supposed to be catching. Then they conspire to plan a stack of stolen money on Marvin Beckett. Well, then this young agent, right, Harper, okay? He decides he can't live with that and decides to blow the whistle. - I can read. - The same guy who's gonna blow the whistle on them... for framing Marvin Beckett then gets murdered by Marvin Beckett? Come on. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. - Who else knows about this? - Us and you. That's it. - Let's keep it that way. - Hey, I've seen this movie. - I get killed on the way home. - Then don't go home. [Chuckles] You serious? Thirty years ago, I was married to Gus Harper for exactly eight months. I'm not sure I can help you. What about the contents of the note? What do you people want? The truth. The last time the F.B.I. came to talk to me... they told me to keep my mouth shut... or you won't get your husband's death benefits. Your husband is a good man. And he tried to do the right thing. And he ended up dead. I can't let that stand. The F.B.I. murdered Gus. Then they had a state funeral for him... complete with the grieving widow as a centerpiece. Is this your husband's handwriting? Yes. He was compiling evidence. - And there was more? - <i>There was a diary...</i> a dozen audiotapes, field notes. - And where did Gus keep it? - Safety-deposit box. Can you tell us where that safety-deposit box was? Ohio First Savings and Loan in Dayton. Excuse me one moment. My parents robbed that exact bank... just days after Gus Harper was killed. They were looking for that evidence. That has to be why Delaney was stalking Russ. Go home. I have a few more questions for Barbara Harper, okay? You go home and you be with your brother, all right? Okay. Okay. - You think it's Delaney? - <i>[Zack] Definitely.</i> I hope to keep working here when I receive my doctorate. We'd all like that. What did she mean when she said, " How do you expect anyone to take you seriously?" It's a comment on... your deportment. Dr. Brennan doesn't care about deportment. That's true. But if you work here, you won't be Brennan's grad student anymore. You'll be a full-blown forensic anthropologist. Cam will be your boss. In your opinion, does deportment matter to Cam? Let's just say that Cam's not the kind of woman you catch... with crusties in the corner ofher eye. Haley's six, and Emma's eight. Tempe? I'm sorry. Preoccupied. Tempe, if I play my cards right... these little girls are gonna be your nieces in the next couple months. The least you can do is memorize their names. - They're cute. - Haley has lung trouble. They're trying to figure it out. You ever deal with an H.M. O? - If it's money, Russ, I can help. - <i>No, forget it.</i> If I'm gonna become these little girls' daddy, I gotta man up for the job. - <i>[Knocking]</i> - That's not rational. I'm a good mechanic. I'll take care of my own. Gus Harper's service history. Okay? Graduated top half of his class in Quantico. He was assigned to theJoint State-Federal Bank Robbery Task Force. Right there. - The victim. - Back when he was Special Agent Delaney supervising Gus Harper. - The guy that was hunting me? - <i>That's right.</i> Okay, here's a list of the bank robbers with their F.B.I. code names. [Brennan] Dad's code name was Columbus. Yeah. Lewis, Clark... Magellan, Cook, Columbus. All named after explorers. That's Mom and Dad. - Every one of these people are deceased. - Except for Dad. Delaney was killed to send a message to the F.B.I. This Columbus coin was found in the victim's mouth. Columbus shot a man in the head... hung him from a pole... gutted him, and set him on fire. And Columbus is our father. [Russ] Dad had it under control. - I mean, for 15 years everything was fine until... - Until what? Dad left you a message. He said, "Stop looking." You didn't. So this is my fault? Well, consequences aren't the same as fault. My parole officer is very philosophical. Well, all we have is a voice tape of Dad saying, "Back off"... and a little silver dolphin that I found at Mom's grave. That's as far as the investigation has gone. - According to Booth. - What? Booth and I are partners. Tempe, he's F.B.I. You aren't. You're the daughter of a career criminal and the sister of a loser on parole. What? I wouldn't let anyone else call you a loser, Russ. What makes you think you're allowed? I love you too. What you're asking is the kind of thing that destroys careers. From the time I was a little girl, I dreamed of putting bad men in jail. Put that back. Which is why I became an Assistant United States Attorney. - You don't have to help me. - Of course I have to help you! Marvin Beckett is still a hero to a lot of African Americans. Some of us never believed he killed this F.B.I. boy. Now you buy me breakfast, tell me you found a way to clear his name... release him out of wrongful incarceration after 30 years? I cannot walk away, which you already know! - Maybe you should have some more coffee. - Of course I want more coffee. - We have to come up with our plan of attack. - I was thinking Judge Moran... We should exhume Gus Harper. See if your genius scientist partner... can ascertain whether he died in the manner the F.B.I. said he died 30 years ago. - Moran's got a long... - No. We want Kemper. - "Hang 'em High" Kemper? - I'm ruining my career, I'm doing it my way, understand? Now, take a doughnut hole. I'm offering. Thanks. This was lodged in Garrett Delaney's sinus cavity. .22 caliber. These dimples indicate that the bullet ricocheted around inside the cranium. Are you worried about your doctorate? No. Dr. Grayson touched me with an open hand on the shoulder. You mean inappropriately? No. I read a book on body language. Apparently in our culture, when an older male lays an open hand on a younger male... it conveys approval. But if he bumps younger male with a closed fist, it conveys doubt. Dr. Grayson went like this, not like this. Like this. Not like this. Dr. Grayson is elderly and arthritic. Perhaps he simply needed help getting to his feet like this. Dr. Brennan, visitors in your office. Tempe, this is a friend of Dad's. Father Coulter is Toby Coulter, train trestle guy. Oh, yeah. I remember that story. When Dad and his friend accidentally blew up a train trestle. Come on. How do you accidentally blow up a train trestle? Well, we were hired by a farmer to dynamite the ice offhis stock pond. We get this competition going who's gonna slide the dynamite... farther across the ice before it blows. You know it's a federal offense to blow up a train trestle, Father. I mean, even if it is accidental. Father Toby Coulter, meet my partner, Seeley Booth. - Careful. He's F.B.I. - Ooh. Well, I'm innocent. It was Max's toss that brought the trestle down. Max Keenan's best friend grows up to be a priest. I'm sure your people have that fact on file somewhere. Tempe, Father Coulter has a message from Dad. It's a private message. Come to my office. She's just gonna tell Agent Booth anyway. Might as well let him listen. "Back off." That's the message. - <i>He said you'd understand.</i> - <i>[Booth] Where'd you see him?</i> - In confession. - We're not Catholic. Oh, the sanctity of the confessional is extended to all. Um, did he ever call you on your cell phone, Father? Two days ago. - <i>Can I see your phone?</i> - You want to trace the call? Yeah. So, uh, Max Keenan, he come to you for absolution? Well, I'm sure you know the requirements for confession. Contrition and intent not to repeat the sin. And Max doesn't have either. And as a priest, I failed him. I never was able to get him to walk the straight and narrow. Is there anything else you can tell us? Well, he was angry. He felt his hand had been forced. Where can we reach you, Father? Father Coulter's staying at St. Augustine Seminary... for the next few days before heading back to Ohio. Here, Father. Your father loves you. Is that part of Dad's message? That's a personal observation. [Booth] Delaney's murder, the threats on Russ's life... this is all happening now because of a little metal dolphin... we found on your mother's grave. F.B.I. field unit in Denver traced it to a local artist in Mead, Colorado. Who identified Dad as the buyer. But Delaney left the F.B.I. 15 years ago. - And somebody told him about your dad. - And didn't tell you? - They're part of the conspiracy. - You must be annoyed. You know what? I am. And I don't like finding out... there's a dirty F.B.I. agent in this building. Here's what I think happened. Delaney goes to your father. He asks him to hand over the evidence. He doesn't do it, he kills you or Russ. Dad calls Russ to warn him. And then kills Delaney. Guts him, burns him, leaves a calling card. Don't mess with Max Keenan's kids. Am I supposed to like that? No, Bones. I'll take a stand-up crook over a crooked cop any day of the week. Booth, I got us a meet with thejudge. Let's go. And you better get back to your lab in case we're successful. - I just find it best to do what she says. - Okay. You want to exhume the young F.B.I. agent that Marvin Beckett murdered? That's correct, Your Honor. - That is a big, noisy mess in the making. - <i>[Door Opens]</i> The F.B.I. has credible evidence that the homicide case against Marvin Beckett was manufactured. Assistant United States Attorney Dan Burridge arguing against this writ, Judge Kemper. - On behalf of... - The F.B.I. - I thought you were F.B. I? - I am, Your Honor. I told you. A big, noisy mess. All right. Let's hear your argument, Mr. Burridge. This is a precipitant exhumation in a highly inflammatory case. The evidence to which Miss Julian alludes has not been authenticated. It has been authenticated by theJeffersonian Institution. The F.B.I. would like to do their own in-house analysis before proceeding. Of course they would. They're the ones who did the framing 30 years ago. - I take exception to that. - <i>Why? You weren't even born 30 years ago.</i> - Judge... - Not like me and Judge Kemper... who got to see firsthand what Marvin Beckett was really like. Miss Julian, did you bring this to me because I knew Marvin Beckett personally? Did you? I wasn't aware of that, Your Honor. Were you aware of that, Agent Booth? We'd like to do this slowly and carefully, Judge. That's all. And we want to exhume Gus Harper so we can make sure... he was murdered in exactly the way the damn F.B. I... said he was murdered, Your Honor. [Saroyan] As mandated by the writ of exhumation byJudge Theodore Kemper... of the D.C. Federal Judicial District... I, Dr. Camille Saroyan, will be performing an autopsy... of Special Agent Augustus Donald Harper... under the auspices of theJeffersonian Institution. Date of death: June 25, 1978. Date of internment: July 2, 1978. Date of exhumation: that would be today. Also present at the post-exhumation autopsy is Dr. Temperance Brennan. The original autopsy in 1978 found that Agent Harper... was killed when he was shot three times at close range... by a.38 Colt Detective Special revolver. Two shots to the chest, one piercing the heart. The other, the left lung. The third, a shot to the frontal bone. - What? - That bullet hole in the head, that's from a.38. - Just like the coroner said. - I can already tell these two holes... are from something a whole lot bigger than a snub-nosed revolver. Something more like a rifle that a sniper would use. Zack, you'd better get a full set of X-rays before Dr. Saroyan reopens. We're gonna conduct this one like the whole world is watching. - Hey, Russ. - Okay, I'm here. What's up? You know, you're an idiot, Russ. I like you, but you're a real idiot. - <i>What'd I do?</i> - I got a call from your parole officer today. Why? Why? Because you crossed state lines without informing him. I just told him you were aiding in an F.B.I. investigation. Thanks. You're slipping, aren't ya? Look, I want to marry Amy and raise her kids. One of them is sick. That costs money. I'm a felon on parole. I work part-time as a mechanic. You tell me what job am I gonna get that lets me be the man I need to be to raise a family? You got this sick little girl depending on you. I get that. But you go back inside and you cross that line, you're not helping anyone out. - <i>[Gunshot]</i> - <i>[Woman Screams]</i> Everybody down! [People Shouting, Gasping] [Woman On TV] Civil rights activist and convicted murderer Marvin Beckett... was released today when a second autopsy... on his alleged victim, F.B.I. Agent Gus Harper... revealed inconsistencies with details of Mr. Beckett's trial back in 1979. [Coulter] What kind of inconsistencies? You have your confidences to keep, Father. I have mine. Well, it's over, right? I mean, now that it's out, there's no reason to kill Russ. You know, the men behind this, they don't care about Marvin Beckett. - <i>They care about being exposed.</i> - Lucky you were together. - <i>Why were you together?</i> - Oh, you know, a man's gotta eat. To think that some people still refuse to believe in guardian angels. Booth! - Who's that? - <i>[Booth] Deputy Director Kirby.</i> My boss's boss's boss. - You're what's known as a real pain in the ass, Agent Booth. - Yes, sir. I just had my testicles handed to me... by the attorney general of the United States of America. He wanted to know why this Marvin Beckett issue... wasn't done slowly and carefully with greater forethought and tact. - <i>You know what I told him?</i> - No, sir. I told him I did not know. Sir, I had to do it the way I did it because the F.B. I... Not your decision, Booth. You're suspended without pay. Gun, I.D., security card, please. Sir, I'm entitled to the reading of the charges against me. The charges against you... are that I was pissed upon from a very great height! You're out of here in 10 minutes. Can they do that? Just kick you out without any warning? The two guys standing behind me with the guns seemed to think so. As you can see, Harper's ribs and sternum were practically obliterated... by the two shots to his torso. Zack, Booth got fired. - Suspended, not fired. - Suspended's F.B.I. speak for fired. Do you know what hurts the most? They took the car. I got no wheels. The bullets themselves were removed from the body. - But Hodgins found some very small fragments. - Copper, lead, polymer. I mean, this is a conspiracy, baby. Guys, what we're dealing with here is that Booth won't be working with us anymore. Well, I got my own gun. It's just, God, why did they have to take the company car? I assume that the only way Booth can get his car back... would be to solve the case on his own and that we'd help. Oh, no. No, no. I can't let you guys do that. Anyone who wants to help Booth, raise their hands. All right, I reverse engineered to find the most likely design of the bullets. After the bullet spread, lead pellets were released like buckshot. Wait a second. That's a homemade round invented back in the '70s. - We're talking a military-issue M-40 A-1 sniper rifle. - Nice. Dude, what you call being a conspiracy theorist, I call being well-informed. Wait. Gus Harper was murdered by a military sniper? - Who makes his own rounds. - Maybe we could compare it to the bullet that grazed Russ. I'm a civilian. We don't have access to that round. Maybe Caroline can help us. [Booth] You still have a job? Not for long. I'm on performance review. None of the F.B.I. members of the Bank Robbery Task Force had sniper training in the '70s. I need to know who else was on that task force. Local... - Booth! Booth! I got it figured out. - State cops, A.T.F. And if any of'em had sniper training. Once you find out, you keep your head down. Task force, sniper training, '70s, duck. Got it. - I figured out a way to solve the case and get your job back. - Wow. That'd be great. We need my father to give us the rest of the evidence he stole from that safety-deposit box. - Great. - I'll drive. Dr. Saroyan, when I get my doctorate, I'd like to work here. Zack, you are an excellent scientist. But an important part of thejob is appearing as an expert witness in court. - Ooh. - "Ooh," what? Jurors have to take you seriously. And frankly... you look like a weekend fill-in at a college radio station. Truth hurts, dude. Learn from it and grow. [Chuckles] You weren't able to find Max by tracing him through the cell phone call he made to me? Call came over the Internet. It was untraceable. Well, Max always did things his way. Guess your being a priest didn't have much of an affect on him. Son, I spent my whole life trying to turn Max's life toJesus. He knows exactly one Bible verse. Numbers 35: 19. "The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer. When he meeteth him, he shall slay him." - What's that mean? - That's the law of the jungle. Father Coulter, if my father makes contact with you again... please tell him he needs to trust me. His way got my mother murdered and almost got Russ killed. - It's time he tried my way. - He won't contact me again. - Well, how do you know? - Ask him. He put me under surveillance. If a parish priest can figure out the F.B.I. is watching him... so can an experienced fugitive like your father. I need a makeover. [Sighs] Zack, I am a big believer in people being themselves. You're actually kind of cute. Yes. I've been told that many times. Usually followed by the word "but." In this case, "But no one takes you seriously." I need help, Angela. So, what do I do first? Lose the floppy hair. [Groans] - Why are you mad at me? - [Sighs] I need a gun. No, you don't. You got me. I'm your gun. You want equipment? Here. Have these. All right? New division of labor. I shoot 'em, you cuff'em. Why didn't you tell me you had Father Coulter under surveillance? It is my job to find your dad and put him in prison. - And you don't think I'll help. - <i>He's your father.</i> I really don't think I should have to ask you to help. He abandoned me, Booth. And that's the best thing you can say about him. Your father lives by a certain code. And part of that code is defending his family by whatever means necessary. You mean killing people and setting their corpses on fire? - "Any means necessary" sort of covers that. - You respect him? I'm just saying in his world, he's a very honorable man. That's ridiculous. There's only one world. It's this one. Would that be the one world where you're mad at me for trying to catch your father? - Or the other world where you actually want him caught? - Neither. - You have to pick one. - Either. Both. Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth... I thought you'd like to meet the reason we're all losing our jobs and getting shot at. This is Mr. Marvin Beckett. - I wanted to thank you personally. - You're welcome, Mr. Beckett. Thirty years ago, crooked agents put me in jail for something I did not do. I did not kill the young F.B.I. agent. I did not steal the money. And I thank you for proving it to the world. That's why I'm here to tell you to your face, to assure you... I did not do those things. You freed an innocent man. And in return, I must warn you... the people that did this to me aren't just a bunch of corrupt cops. They serve masters of much greater influence. You're looking to bring their world down around their ears. They will strike at you. Watch yourselves. Here's your list of snipers from the decade of disco. This time I'm advising you. Duck. - Anyone you know? - Yeah. The A.T.F. rep on the task force was a marine sniper, Robert Kirby. F.B.I. Deputy Director Robert Kirby? That just suspended you? Call your brother, tell him to get out of the house. - <i>Tell him to get out now.</i> - Why? What's going on? Seconds after Caroline got this list, Kirby knew about it. He's not answering. I don't understand, Booth. It's not us that Kirby is afraid of. It's your father. The only way to strike at him is to go through you or Russ. - <i>Kirby was the one that took a shot at Russ.</i> - No answer. - Russ? - Hello? - All right, just stay back. - Russ? - There's no sign of a break-in. I'll check the back. Russ? - <i>Russ?</i> Oh, my God. - Booth? - <i>What?</i> - <i>Russ.</i> - Just take it easy, all right? We don't know that for sure. That's too much blood. Nobody could survive that... that much blood loss. Nobody. All right. Okay. It's all right. Oh, my God. It's against the law us not calling in a murder. It wasn't a murder. It was a bloodstain. That much blood, it's mur... it's murder. We call it in, the next thing is we find ourselves under arrest. That had to be Russ's blood. You got a sample, right? We'll check the D.N.A. at the lab. Until then, who's the one who always says, "Don't jump to conclusions"? Right? Yeah, you're right. Thanks. I wish you wouldn't keep letting me hug you when I get scared. Hey, when I get scared, I'll hug you. We'll call it even. - <i>Results?</i> - The blood's not Russ's. - Even you can't do a D.N.A. test that fast. - Didn't have to. Both Brennan and her brother are "O" type blood, as was the mother. The blood sample you brought me was "AB." - Therefore... - Okay, let's go tell Bones. I just saw her. She's on her way to see the priest. - Why? - He said he had something for her. She can't be going places without me. Not when it's open season on Brennans. - [Cell Phone Rings] - Bones? [Caroline] Not even close, <i>chéri.</i> We need to talk. Well, first, I want to tell you that your brother... is, uh, with his father. You mean... with God? No, his earthly father... your father. - Are you certain? - Saw it with my own eyes. Oh, thank God. Which I use only as a figure of speech. Well, you have to start somewhere. You know, you're... you're very much like him. I'm... I'm nothing like my father. Black and white. The two of you, you always saw the world in black and white. Your mother wasn't like that. Either is Russell. All right, go. I was clearing out my desk when my phone rings. And it's this F.B.I. agent named Carlson. Yeah. He heads up a surveillance unit. He tells me you and Booth are wasting my time with this damn priest. I tell him, " You better mind your mushy mouth." I gotta find Bones, keep her from getting killed. Father Coulter is 90 years old... confined to bed with Alzheimer's in a convalescent home out there at the seminary. Which does not much sound like the priest you told me about. Your father, he talked about, uh... when you were four and your brother was nine. And... And he hid behind this door and he jumped out at you. - You know what? Just give me the keys to your car. - My car? Boo! He hollers, "Boo!" And you... you had this doll. - Had this string in the back for talking. - Chatty Cathy. Wham! You took that doll. And you wound up. And you hit your brother so hard you knocked him flat as a pancake. I said to your mother, " No one will ever jump out at that girl again." And your mother said, "Just like you, Max. She's just like you." Hair color, plastic surgery... colored contact lenses, chin and cheek implants... 15 years older. Still, I should have seen it. - [Tires Screech] - [Horn Honks] - [Line Ringing] - Come on, Bones. Pick up. Pick up! - This is Dr. Temperance Brennan. Leave a message. - Damn it. Russ knew it was you all along? Yeah. You talk to Russ, but not to me? You know, to tell you the truth... you do better without me and Russ does worse. - Take this. - I'm not religious. No. We're gonna play this your way. Please. This is Gus Harper's journal. There's a key there that's to a safety-deposit box. In that safety-deposit box is all the evidence. Why didn't you give it to them back in 1978? Because your mother took one look at it and said... "If you turn this over to them, they will kill us and our kids." They got Mom anyway. - There's not a day that goes by that my heart is not broken. - <i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i> Dad, come on! I gotta go. Wait. I can't let you go. Oh, I love you too. No. I mean, I can't let you go. - I'm sorry. - [Moans] I must be getting old. I let you get the drop on me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just can't let you get away. I'm sorry. Listen to me. If you find somebody that you can trust, you hang on to him. Remember that. - <i>Dad, let's go!</i> - I'm proud of you. I love you. Dad, get in. You take care of her. - F.B.I. Stop or I'll shoot. - Booth. Booth. Booth. Oh. Right. Did he really have to hit the car? I wasn't gonna chase him. You okay? # [Indie Rock] # [Continues] # [Ends] - What's this? - Zack's doctorate. I'd like to recommend him for a job. I can't put him in front of a jury. I'm sorry. I'll put in a good word in Pure Research. That way, he can come visit once in a while. - Visit? - <i>Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins...</i> I'd like to present your colleague. Dr. Zachary Uriah Addy. [Chuckles] Look at you. - All grown up. - <i>[Saroyan] Wow.</i> Very impressive. I can learn how to be effective in front of juries. Zack can learn anything. All right, he's hired. Who am I to break up this team? - Lunch is on me, Dr. Addy. Anywhere you want to go. - The diner. - Anywhere, I said. - I like the diner. Hey, do me a favor, Uriah. Need a little time to adjust to your fascist haircut. Let's go. Congratulations, Dr. Addy. Thank you, Dr. Brennan. [Angela] Zack, congratulations. - <i>[Hodgins] Congratulations.</i> - <i>Hear, hear!</i> [Hodgins] It's about time, man. Congratulations. [Saroyan] You should be proud of yourself. What happened? Well, the attorney general took one look at the, uh, evidence your father provided. And, you know, he reinstated me. I'm glad. Listen. We, uh, found another burned body. Same place, same setup. - Kirby? - I'm pretty sure. It was Kirby's blood in your apartment. Dad's still trying to warn people. Leave me and Russ alone. Uh, Russ, he's safe with your father. They're warning people to stay away from you. You know what? I'm sorry that you had to go through it again. Watching your family drive off, you know, leaving you behind. - I'm sorry. - My father is... is... He's your dad. And he loves you. You know, I'm just... I'm just one of those people who doesn't get to be in a family. That's... Listen, Bones. Hey, there's more than one kind of family. - Well, Zack got the job, right? - Come in and congratulate him. Nah. He's your squints. Not my squints. No. Booth, we are all of us your squints. Do me a favor and pat Zack on the shoulder with an open hand. What? Why?
