so he's motivated.</i> I'd be surprised if another agent doesn't already have an offer. What's that smell? Probably the neighbors. I hear they love to barbecue. It's a very friendly neighborhood. Now, the master bedroom has been beautifully redone, with coffered ceilings and all-new carpeting. You ask me, it's to die for. I'm sorry, he was supposed to clean up. That's a foot. Oh, my God! Crap. I thought your grandfather lived in a nursing home. It's a retirement community, not a prison. He can leave when he wants. It's nice he wants to stay with you for a while. Did something happen in the nursing home? If I tell you, you're just gonna read into it all sorts of stuff. I won't. He slugged a nurse. Male nurse. Actually, that's pretty straightforward. Hostile, aggressive, antisocial behavior... He wanted to smoke a cigar in his room. A cigar? - That's interesting. - No. He's a tough guy, that's all. Shrimp. Hey, Pops. How you doing? - "Shrimp"? - I imagine Booth used to be shorter. Bring it over! How you doing? I'm fine. Come on over, Pops. Nice place. The ptomaine come with the food, or do you have to order it on the side? This here's Dr. Temperance Brennan. - Very nice to meet you, Mr. Booth. - Well, you weren't kidding. - What did you tell him? - Nothing. - You can give her hand back now. - All right. You can call me Hank, sweetheart. - Okay, Hank. - And who's this, a friend of Parker's? No, this here is Dr. Sweets. A doctor? I don't think so. - No, it is. - It's true. Where'd you get your MD, in a Cracker Jack box? So, what do you got on? I'm ready for some action. I figured we'd play some dominoes, then after that, maybe go... Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry, Pops. Yeah. OK, on our way. Got a case. - Good. I can help. I was an MP. - No, you can't come. I'll tell you what, why don't you meet me back at the apartment? All right. All right, I'll call a cab. No. Sweets here, he'll... he'll give you a ride. - Okay, Pops? - It was nice to meet you, Hank. - Sure. - See ya, Pops. Bang. So, shall we go? You got room on your bicycle for my bag? Are you sure you can handle him? He must have been in a nursing home for a reason. Pops, he had triple- bypass surgery about, well, I'd say three months ago. He didn't want to be on his own. If he wants to be with me now, that's cool. - What if he wants to make it permanent. - It's family. Nothing trumps family, just remember that, okay? All right, let's go. Open up. - After you, Bones. - Thank you. This wouldn't've happened if I had been here. She told me to move out. Said the place would look better. Let me handle this. I'm Katie Selnick. I'm the real estate agent. And this is Howard Fileman; he's the owner of the house. I know that this is a really bad time, but it is a buyer's market, so if you... Show a little a compassion, all right? I need a list of everyone who had access to the house. - Including real estate agents, clients. - That's an awfully long list. You better start getting to work there. Please stay there, thank you. Whoever this was burned to ash overnight. Give me some space, please. Back up. So, nothing else burn? Nothing else. Maybe it was the candle here in the cake. Everyone freeze! This hand is <i>very</i> fragile, especially the phalanges. Any motion may cause the rest of it to just fall apart. Okay, we're frozen now, Bones. What can we do? I need some kind of spray adhesive, like hairspray? - She must have some. - I'll go get some. It would be best if you didn't lift your feet when you moved. Careful. There appear to be wounds on this hand. But... we won't know what weapon caused them if I don't stabilize the ash. - Can I move now? - Gently. What are we talking about here, spontaneous combustion? - There's no such thing. - Electrical currents in your body, they start sparking, and then before you know it, flame on! Well, that's absurd. Really? Then what happened? I have... absolutely no idea. Exactly. Spontaneous combustion. Bones - Season 5 Episode 08 "The Foot in the Foreclosure" Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas, Dark_Chii Subtitle: AÂ²S Team --==All-about-Subs.fr==- - I think Booth was on to something. - What, spontaneous combustion? Well, the so-called instances of spontaneous combustion can actually be explained by a phenomenon known as the "wick effect." Okay, here's the classic example. Heavy set guy passes out from booze holding a lit cigarette. He drops the cigarette onto his pajamas. The fire melts his belly fat. The fat soaks into the bedding, creating what is essentially a slow-burning human candle, the pajamas being the wick. Fat burns in, not out, which explains why nothing else caught on fire. Based on the position of the body, the victim was either unconscious or dead when the fire started. People who die at a fire show signs of motion, trying to get away from the flames. This person never moved. Tox screen from the tissue on the foot showed no signs of drugs or alcohol. So, the victim was killed before the fire even started. - So you met Booth's granddad? - I think Booth wants him to move in. That's a big step. Well, Hank raised Booth after his father left. - Seeley'do anything for him. - Booth is a good man. Well, well. Showing a little interest in the personal lives of your coworkers there? No. I just meant that... Well, I had a... grandparent who lived with us when I was young. And yes, I am. Too often we don't appreciate the elderly until they're gone. I just find Agent Booth's actions to be commendable and moving. You're moved? Yes, I'm moved. And now I'm not. Based on the markers, I say we're looking at a female. The victim had Haglund's Deformity. Very good, Dr. Edison. Haglund's Deformity? It's a bony enlargement on the heel that's caused by wearing ill-fitting high-heel shoes. Judging by the micro-fractures and remodeling to the tarsus and the metatarsus, the victim also had plantar fasciitis. There were also elevated levels of leptin in the tox screen. Taken together, that means the victim was probably obese. So we have to I.D. a pile of ash based on only the fact that it's a... fat lady? It's quite a challenge, I agree. This orange goo looks like melted polymers... Can I grab a sample here? Just be careful of bone fragments. - So, what does he call his grandfather? - Pops. Called mine Gramps. Agent Booth, this is Officer David Poe, third district. Sorry to disturb you, sir. - What's up, Officer Poe? - I'm here with your grandfather, sir. - Excuse me? - I'm fine, Seeley... This cop just pinched me for nothing. We're at Takoma Park. - I think he could use a ride home. - Well, wha... Is he hurt? Is he okay? He was a little bit confused and disoriented. Wait a minute! Seeley, I'm fine. I just took a subway to see my friend Willie Lewis. I mention him to you? We were in the 82nd together. I remember, Pops. Well, the son of a bitch up and died on me. They had the funeral three weeks ago, and nobody even told me. I took a walk to clear my head, and... well, I... I got turned around. Okay, listen, listen, Pops, just... I'm coming to get you, okay? - You're working. - It's okay, it's okay, Pop. Just put me back on with the cop. Here. Hi. Mrs. Selnick. Hold on. I have a list of some of the people who had access to the house. Some? I'll get more, but I was showing a house. The market is horrible; I haven't made a sale in... A woman is dead, that doesn't bother you at all? I know it should. My therapist says I'm afraid to feel. You really should be afraid of going to jail for obstructing investigation. I want those names by tomorrow. Tomorrow. I'm on my way, Officer Poe. Tomorrow. The wounds appear to be defensive, but this section of hand is too fragile to take a mold. Well, I'm making a 3-D rendering, which is essentially a virtual mold. Booth must be cute with his grandfather? Well, his grandfather calls him Shrimp. Booth seems to like it, which I don't understand. Well, it's because it makes him feel loved, like when he actually was a shrimp. So the moniker is a sign of affection. Very good, Brennan. You never had a nickname? Just what Booth calls me, just... just Bones. The orange glob of goo? Polyethylene tere phthalate Right. It's polyester. It's a perfect wick. She had to have been wearing it when she was lit. - Let me see that. - There's not enough residue for it to be a coat or pajamas or anything. What about a vest? Yeah. I mean, it could be. I think I know this color. The computer can match the exact shade of color for us. This is the Palettone color wheel. When a corporation wants to standardize their logo, they have Palettone create a color for them. This particular shade of orange is known as... PriceCo Blossom Orange. This is the color of the vest the employees wear. The victim worked at PriceCo. I'll tell Booth. Just got to make one stop, okay? It's about the murder? It's not gonna take long. - You're sure you're all right? - Will you stop asking me that. You never got lost? Just because I'm maturing, people think I'm going senile. All right, all right. Okay, just asking. You remember when I taught you how to pitch? - You thought I was too old then, too. - You had the best sinker I ever saw. - I could never get that one right. - Your fastball could smoke mine. Glad you're here, Pops. Yeah. And don't worry. If you ever need a little privacy with the bone doctor, - I'll make myself scarce. - OK, thanks. But there's nothing going on between us. - You gay? - What? No. She's a keeper. You should listen to me. I warned you about Rebecca being a waste of time, didn't I? I can take care of my own love life. I don't think so. Well, I got to get a book light. Now, I won't get in your way. All right, listen, Pops, do me a favor. Why don't you just stand right here at the entrance, right underneath this big sign, OK? I got to go find the manager. Well, go! Keep America safe. Don't wander off. Stay right here. Excuse me. Where would I find electrical tape? Let's see. I think... I think, I think I can help you find it. This way. Meg Tracy has been AWOL since Tuesday. Never called. Not like her. - Would you have an employee photo? - Sure. Did she do something? I don't want to get dragged into anything. Something may have happened to her. Maybe you heard complaints about me. But it's from those slackers and deadbeats who don't do their job. I keep my nose clean. - The photo? - I'll get her whole file. Just leave me out of it. Kitchen and bath, right down there. Pops, what are you doing? You don't work here. - Why are you wearing that vest? - Three people said I was a good greeter, so I got a vest. We got to go. Let's go. Take the vest off. - My shift's not over. - You don't... you're not on a shift. - Will you... - You think this is the break room? - Because I'll fire you. - Slow down. This here is my grandfather, all right? He's just a big fan of the store. He's always wanted to work here, but not today. We got to get this file back to Bones, okay? Thanks. - I quit. - Yeah, he... he quits. Come on. Where would I find fertilizer for Azaleas? Aisle four. This woman's a size four, tops. She must have recently lost a significant amount of weight. Her doctor confirmed that she had been treated for both the micro-fractures we found in the foot and the Haglund's Deformity. But on her last visit with him, she weighed 234 pounds. Baby had back. I'm sorry, I don't know where that came from. The doctor's X-rays of the foot match ours. It's Meg Tracy. If Meg was thin, why so much ash? Because there was someone else in bed with Meg. Two people died in that fire. Given the amount of ash and bone, these remains represent approximately 380 pounds of human. We know Meg Tracy weighed about 120, which puts our second victim at 260. This is part of the mental eminence. Judging by the angle of the jaw fragment, - second victim was male. - A super-sized male. So the cake on the table was probably his. I still don't have nearly enough to give you a face. I'm still working on these inorganics. I'll separate the male and female bone fragments, see if they share any injuries. We're still assembling evidence, analyzing the bones and constructing 3-D imagery. They got lighter fluid and presto logs over at PriceCo. They could burn somebody up. - There's no evidence of an accelerant. - Yet. That manager over there that yelled at me, I saw the look in her eyes. I was an MP, you know. This is a little bit more complicated than arresting some drunk soldiers who just wandered off base. I don't think so. - Did I take these blue pills? - Yeah, you took the yellow pills, too. I feel like a damn chemistry experiment. They didn't have this stuff 50 years ago and everybody was fine. Actually, medicine has increased life expectancy quite a bit since 1959. 50 years ago, you'd probably be dead. I like her. She's real. She's got balls. Ovaries, actually. All right, you got a pair of steel ovaries. - Thank you. - Will you two please... Always so proper. Will you loosen up? He's skittish when the subject of sex comes up. - I'm not. - Maybe I didn't give him enough information when he was a kid. I'll come in right now. All right. - What's going on? - They brought in Meg Tracy's roommate for questioning. I should go talk to her. Sorry. Go. We'll play dominoes later. You'll lose. You wish. I love that kid. I'm more proud of him than anybody in the world. I think he feels the same way. He had no one else when his father walked out. He was lucky to have you. I never had the nerve to tell him that it was my fault. What was? Well, if I was a better man, maybe I could have figured something else out. But when I saw my son hitting Seeley, beating that little kid, that was it. I said, "Get out. "You don't deserve to be a father. Get out!" He never came back. So I was left with the two boys. You are a good man, Hank. I didn't know what else to do. He was beating my grandson. When the time is right, you'll tell him. And if he... if he needs it, you'll hold him. I wondered why Meg hadn't come back to the apartment. I tried to call. You're sure it's Meg? I'm afraid so. - How long have you been roommates? - Three years. We were weight loss buddies. This year, the loser paid for the other one to go to Hawaii. Incentive, you know. I lost. Obviously. You paid for Meg's trip? Meg lost over 100 pounds. I lost six. How did she die? Well, we're still working on cause of death. She was with a man. Do you happen to know who... Meg was dating? No one special. I would've known. She used to meet different guys at Club Jiggle. Club Jiggle? For thin people who... let's say they appreciate people my size. I went myself a couple times, but it was too freaky. These skinny guys saying they wanted to fondle my cankles and eat brisket out of my navel. Skeeved me out. Brisket? Right, that's a whole another world, I guess. Where you were the night of the tenth? There was a big house party. I was there until after 2:00 a.m. Can you do me a favor and just... you know, write down the names of people who could verify that they saw you at the party there? Am I a suspect? You can get the second victim's height from bone fragments? When subjected to intense heat, the long bones warp, crack and contract in predictable ways. Based on the figures that Clark gave me, I was able to partially reconstruct a male fibula. The amount of bone shrinkage from heat exposure was about 20%. Which allows you to calculate height. That's brilliant. We know our victim was approximately 260 pounds. Yeah, but based on the fibula, he was five-five. Five-five, 260. That's a start. I'll tell Booth. Meg may have been participating in a feeder and eater fetish. Her roommate said the guys at the club wanted to eat brisket out of her navel. That would make sense. Fetishes are common in all sexually repressive societies like ours. Yeah, feeders and eaters are a subcategory of fat fetishism that involves an obese person, or an eater, and a feeder that derives sexual pleasure out of the gaining and fondling of body fat. That would explain the, uh, the cake next to the bed. Which I'm probably never gonna want to eat again. Hank said you love cake. Well, I usually do. Wait, are we staying on point here? We were discussing cake, weren't we? He's making you grilled cheese tonight. - Really? - Yes. I'm invited. How is it going with your grandfather? I know it can be very stressful to be responsible for someone who's elderly. It's fine. He does take a lot of medication, so he has health issues. - You have to stay on top of that. - He took care of me when I was sick, - I can take care of him. - It's not gonna be easy for him to build a new life here at his age. And he's got a history of aggressive behavior, right? If he wants to talk, I'd be happy... Sorry, we were talking about murder. Meg Tracy, fondling of fat. Of course. So why would Meg go back to the club if she wasn't fat anymore? Meg lived for many years as an obese woman. Her obsession with food is not something that would just go away. She would have to struggle with it every day. So you're saying that she missed overeating so much that she fed other people in order to feed herself? - Yes, exactly. - So the eater became a feeder and somehow it got her killed. Pops has been making grilled cheese for a long time. I had these about three times a week. - Amazing, right? - Very good. I learned how to make these during the Battle of Incheon. American cheese reminded us of home. We kept fighting. Come on. Dig in, Bones. This is real food here. - We should get to the club, Booth. - Bones is right. We got a lot of people to interrogate. Sure. Amazing. - What channel's the fishing channel on? - 135. You're out of your Coumadin, Hank. I forgot. So many pills. These pills are important. If you forget to take them, you could get clots, have a heart attack or a stroke. - I don't think so. - When was the last time you took them? I don't know. A few days ago. We have to go get this refilled. He should take them right away. I'm fine. No, no. You're coming with us. I'm gonna make sure you take them in front of me. All right? Come on. The center of the palm has some kind of injury. Brennan suspects it's defensive. There was a cake next to them. Could the injury be caused by a knife? No, it's not a knife. See, the markings are jagged. It doesn't indicate any recognizable weapon. By filling in the injury, I can make a virtual mold of the injured area. It's a nose. Killed by a nose? That'd be a first. I'll see if I can match any possible weapons. Maybe something old. So, you took it? Took the pill? I took it. You saw me. I got you a pill box that has a compartment for each day's pills. - That way you won't forget. - I won't forget. - So where are we going? - Well, we're going to go to a... It's an unusual spot. It's where... - What would be the PC word for "fat"? - There's nothing wrong with big women. Your grandma had some jam in her jelly. - All right, Pop. - Being overweight wasn't stigmatized. During the middle ages in Italy, the wealthy and influential members of society were called Popolo Grosse, meaning, literally, "fat people". Is she always like this? She always has the facts, Pops. Always. Go on a game show. You'd clean up. I tell her that all the time, but you know, she's already loaded. She's got talent, charm, beauty, money. And you're just friends? I didn't raise you very well. - Freaky. - Listen. We want you to stick close. I don't want you disappearing into one of those women. They seem quite happy. They haven't seen their blood sugar levels. Hi, baby. You're not with the celery stick? No. I mean, yes. Yeah. My body mass index is within the accepted medical norms. - You don't know what you're missing. - All right, listen. We're gonna go talk to the bartender. You gonna be okay? - Will you stop asking me that? - All right. Come on. - Is there a problem? - Just want to ask you a few questions. - You recognize this girl? - Yeah. Meg. She's been coming here for years. She just lost a bunch weight. - Guess she switched sides. - Did you ever see her with a man, approximately five, five, 260 pounds? Is Meg all right? She's dead. That might help, you know, jog your memory a little bit. Yeah. Sure. Let's see. There was one guy. Yes? Glasses? - I don't know. You tell us. - Big, of course. And short. Meg bought him a bacon burger and some cake. The guy loved cake, just like Meg used to. She must've fed him six pieces, devil's food. Right. Great. Do you got a name? Sorry. - Did he kill her? - Well, he's dead, too. He had a goatee. Wait... Hugo. She called him Hugo. - Hugo. Great. Thank you. - Sure. Sorry about Meg. We should see if there are any Hugos on the real estate agent's list. - She hasn't given me the list yet. - Maybe she had a reason not to. That's exactly what I was thinking. Look at that. They like him. You know, he never had any problems with the ladies. - We should get him home. - No. Let's just... give him a second there. He's having a good time, right? No rush. Mr. Fileman, I didn't expect to see you here. Katie said she was gonna see you and suggested I come along. Did you bring the list of people who had access to the house? - Yes, I did. - Right. What's he doing here? He can't sell his house as long as it's a crime scene. Neither can you. That was nasty. - But it's true. - Look, the bank is threatening to foreclose, like this is my fault. I can't lose my house before I have a chance to sell. Katie said you could help. I'm sorry, but it's an active crime scene. My wife and I built that house together. After she died, I couldn't get any work. 21 years as a master carpenter, you know? Means nothing. How is that fair? If you could just sign a request for a stay of foreclosure for unforeseen circumstances, like a government investigation. I brought the form, Agent Booth. This isn't a very long list. Not a very good market. Hugo Tucker. Hugo Tucker. Tucker. Would he happen to have been, overweight, goatee, glasses, by any chance? I think so. He looked at the house a few times. - Thought he was gonna make an offer. - I remember him. He really loved the custom work I'd done. Nice man. Well, he's probably the other victim. Oh, God. Is that going to delay things more? I'll see what I can do. I've pulled all the teeth we found in the ashes. These incisors and molars, they match the X-rays that were sent over from Hugo's dentist. So it's him. Any markers on the fragments that could help Angela I.D. a weapon? All the bone damage I've found so far is a result of the fire. The heat causes the bones to break apart into small crescent shapes like this. Or they'll show a crisscross pattern like this. - Have you gone through them all? - I'm still looking. Excellent. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised yesterday that you felt relaxed enough to talk about your grandfather. I'm human, you know? I just believe in working at work. I realize that. I love him very much. But... I should have the discipline to keep it to myself. Of course. Then, carry on. He never got to see what I became. What I do, it's for him. I'm sure he'd be very proud. Go Tucker. Single. Glasses and goatee. Signed in at the open house. I talked to his roommate. No enemies. No debt. There's no reason {\why somebody would}to want him dead. Jealousy. What if Meg had a boyfriend? - Roommate said there was no one. - I don't like that real estate lady. I thought you didn't like to go by your gut. I was just trying it out. It's not satisfying. Right. Hank? Why is he calling you? For dinner. Tonight at 7:00. We'll play dominoes after. Tell him he doesn't have to. Booth says that you don't have to make dinner. He says, "Shut up and don't be late". All right. Thanks. Bye. He said he's going to teach me how to kick your ass. That'll be the day. I don't think so. I don't like that real estate agent. What if she was sleeping with Hugo? Give me that. All right? Listen, Pops, okay? We're trying to work here. Not Pops, but I'm interested to know what's going on. Nothing special. What is it? So, this was melted onto one of the bed springs. - What is that? - It's a Slim Ring. One more time. What is that? It's a gastric banding device that actually limits the amount of food a person's stomach can hold at one time. A surgical means of losing weight. That's how she lost 100 pounds in such a short time. - So much for will power. - It has a serial number. Exactly. I talked to the doctor who did the operation. It turns out that the Ring was not registered to Meg Tracy, but to her roommate, Stephanie Stevens. Meg used her roommate's insurance. Bet Stephanie was pretty mad. Especially if she wanted to get the same procedure herself and now couldn't. But mad enough to kill? I've seen people killed for a lot less, believe me. God. Is he all right? I'm on my way. A fire in my place. Pops was cooking on the stove and... Thanks. Thanks for everything. It's that stupid stove. - Who has a stove like that? - You left a dish towel on the stove. I don't think so. Now, you could've been hurt. You could've been killed. I always used to make dinner for you. I've done it more than a million times. It's that damn stove. All right. I won't be long. I just have to question a suspect. I don't need a baby-sitter, you know. And I do mean "baby." Why can't I stay here with Temperance? I have work at the lab. Perhaps you can teach Sweets to play dominoes? - Great idea. - I already know. I don't think he'd have a chance. You don't know who you're messing with. Bring it on, old man. Those are fightin' words, pop. Thanks, Sweets. See you later, Hank. You know, what happened to me could have happened to anybody. I know. Just because I'm carrying a few extra years, doesn't mean I can't take care of myself. I know. Smart ass. - I go first. - All right. I know. Thanks for coming in. He really wanted to see you. Are you sure you don't need me? I'll interrogate her roommate, and if I get anything, I'll call you. I'm sorry. I guess he needs more than I can give right now. I should take a leave of absence. Can you afford to do that? You have a son to take care of, too. Pops will think I don't love him. Really? I should go. We know that Meg used your insurance card for the surgery. What? - That's why I got turned down? - You didn't know? I went in for a routine checkup, and my insurance declined payment. They said I'd exceeded my annual limit. I thought it was a mistake. That's how she lost the weight? That bitch! You're saying that she stole your insurance card? Well, no, I, I let her use my card, but not for that. She was sick. She didn't have any insurance. - You know that's a crime, right? - Isn't it a crime when your roommate screws you out of medical coverage? - You're not answering my question. - She cheated on our bet. I paid for her trip to Hawaii. I can't believe this. You were at the party when Meg was killed, correct? We talked to those people off the list that you gave us, and that was an awfully big party. Enough for you to disappear, and no one could really tell, if you'd gone or if you'd left. They didn't know. You're never gonna believe me, so now I have to pay for a lawyer, too. Have you found anything, Dr. Edison? All of these bone fragments are scarred with markers from the fire. But these two, a piece of the parietal and occipital, seem to show evidence of being fractured. Definitely could have been made by the pointed object Angela's trying to identify. Look at this. Residue along the edge of the fracture? It's a resin. Resin consists of terpenes and phenolic compounds. It's wood. He was struck with a weapon made out of wood. Teak, to be exact. The bed is teak. The wounds on Megs hand were clearly defensive so she couldn't have accidentally hit her hand. And the blows were sufficient to render them unconscious. The finials. The what? The decorative knobs that go on top of the posts. They're missing. The rest of the bed was carved, which means the finials must have been carved, too. This is the real estate agent's virtual tour of Howard's house. Look, we have finials. The reason why the image looked like a nose is because it was a nose. The victim was beaten with one of these heads. Wait. That's Howard Fileman, the homeowner. He said he was a master carpenter. So the other one was probably his wife. It's a match. So it wasn't about who was having sex, but about where they were having sex. He carved this bed for him and his wife. It was a symbol. Meg and Hugo both had roommates. The house was cheaper than a hotel. Howard catches Meg and Hugo having sex in his bed. Weird cake sex. He kills them, sets the bed on fire and then leaves with the busts. That's so sweet. And it's horrible, too. It's mainly horrible. I'll tell Booth. Howard might still have the finials. We'll pull tissue from them. He'll still have them. I guarantee it. It's all he has left of her. I went back to sleep in our bed. I used to stare at her face up on the bedpost and pretend she was next to me. But I found them. It wasn't right. I don't know why you got takeout. I could have cooked dinner. Right. Try this one here, it's chicken. You'll love it. I don't think so. Doesn't look like chicken to me. I'll try it anyway. I got you a fork 'cause I know how much you hate chopsticks, all right? Good job. Listen, there's something I gotta tell ya. I know. This isn't chicken. I already told you that. But there's something I want to say to you first. I can't tell you how much it means to me to be here with you, to share your life. To see what a good man you've turned out to be. Shut up, shut up. This gooey crap isn't easy for me. Now, listen, I don't want you to think I don't love ya. But I've gotta go back. What? To the place. They need me. Ronald called. He's got no one to fish with. And Margaret needs my help with the crocheting. You crochet, Pops? That's what we call sex. And let's face it, your appliances stink. What about the orderlies? Ah, don't worry about them. They're used to being hit by me. You're really sure that this is what you want? I already called them. They know I'm coming. Maybe you and your friends, you can give me a ride? You'll call, right, Pop? I'll call, you'll call, we'll visit. We'll be sick of each other. I'll miss ya, Hank. Of course you will. Shrimp, can you give us a minute? Sure, Pops. You remember what I told ya. I remember. He's big and strong, but he's gonna need someone. Everyone needs someone. Don't be scared. Scared of what? I'm not scared of anything. It all goes by so fast, you don't want any regrets. I don't understand. Yes, you do. Give me a hug. It's your turn. - What'd he say to you? - None of your business. Now listen. You remember. It's all in there. Everything you need to know. You just do what it tells ya. I love ya, Pops. I love you. Okay, now I can't breathe! All right. All right then. What'd he say to you? Nothing. Just saying good-bye. You? Me? Nothing. "Be a good boy." Stuff like that. We should go. - I like that thing around your neck. - What? That thing that you're wearing around your neck. It looks really good. You've seen it before. I don't think so. Thanks.
