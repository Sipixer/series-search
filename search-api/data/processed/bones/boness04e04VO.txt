Okay, well, one of the most beautiful man-made things. Mom says the Mona Lisa. Look, all due respect to your mom, buddy, but a perfectly thrown spiral is way better than any of that stuff, OK, so let me show you to do this. Put your hand up here like that, spread your fingers wide. - My hand's too small. - It'll grow, all right? Okay, hand there to steady the ball. Lift it up to your ear. No, your ear, not your chin, silly. All right... - What's it saying? - It's saying, "Throw your old man a deep pass for a touchdown," hey! What? What you got? There's a bird's nest. - Where? - There. Cool? You want me to lift you up so you can see inside? - How about I knock it down with... - No, no, Don't do that, you don't want to do that. That's somebody's home, OK, buddy? Something could be alive in there, OK? You want me to boost you up so you can see? - Sure. - Ready? - Yeah. - One, two, three, and up. - What do you see? - Higher. - Okay. - I see something. If it's an egg, don't touch it, because if the mommy bird comes back... - It's not an egg. - What is it? It's somebody's finger. He pulled the finger out of a bird's nest. Did he completely freak out? Booth said Parker wanted to put it in his pocket and take it home. When it comes to boys, that "snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails" thing is pretty accurate. - You have a son? - I have four. Mr. Starret is my oldest grad student. - Can you get a fingerprint? - Not enough flesh. There are scrapes on the bone and a jagged appearance here where it was severed. It was probably chewed off by a wild animal. The sticky stuff on the finger turns out to be sap from a flowering Japanese cherry. I know you from somewhere. Right. I sold you a vintage '50s hot rod back in the mid-'90s. You were clean, shaven back then. Because I was a kid. But you drove a hot rod, Hodgins? No, I did not. The lemon he sold me broke down after a week. Body parts in park, mystery needs solving. The nest was made by Corvus brachyrhynchos the American Crow. A crow will seldom stray more than 12 miles from its nest. There's a spectacular copse of Japanese flowering cherry at the Jefferson Memorial. - How do you know? - Career number two: parks supervisor. The Jefferson Memorial is eight miles from where Parker found the finger. Good work, guys. I'd say "King of the lab," but... That just depresses me. Don't ask. - A human finger? - Yes, a human finger, all right? Look, is my son gonna be suffering from some kind of post-traumatic stress, you know, like suppressed feelings, memories, all that hooey? Well, a child's brain can't process death as an end. You know, that's why we tell children that their deceased loved ones are looking down on us from heaven. - Which they are. - Yeah. It's an excellent coping technique. You know, Grandma isn't worm food, she's simply moved on to a better place. - Which she did. - Yeah. Parker looks good to me. So. You talk to him? "Hi, Parker. I'm Dr. Sweets, "I'm a psychologist, I'm here to talk to you about the finger that you found." - Great. Could you do that? - No, That could introduce issues that don't currently exist. Just call me if he displays any symptoms of distress. Okay. Any symptoms of distress. Like? Killing cats? Yeah. Sure. When I was five years old, I went next door to visit our neighbor, Mrs. Walkey, and she was dead, sitting at the kitchen table. - And I'm all right. - You spend your life with skeletons. It's just a matter of time. He's just a kid. He's gonna realize he had a dead finger in his hand, he's gonna freak out. You afraid you're gonna get in trouble with Rebecca? There's a chance that he might not say anything to her. - So, yes. - Agent Booth? - Yeah. - We found something. Okay. What have you got? Oh, it's an opossum. Eating a body. - Should I shoot it? - No. No, no, no. Opossums are scared of humans. Here. Shoo, shoo, shoo! Shoo, shoo! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go. Shoo, shoo. Come on. Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. Yeah. They're terrified. A number of body parts are missing. We'll have to grid the vicinity. Okay, we'll re-calibrate the search, and will call this ground zero. Fanny pack. PDA clip. Well, if you can identify this person, I can subpoena the PDA's contents. Partial skull. Look at that. The possum's dead. I got it. The victim was poisoned. The possum ate the victim, got poisoned and died. That's it. A stressed-out opossum can go into a false sleep, lasting up to four hours. The possum was faking it? Yeah. There it goes. - You should go get him. - What do I look like, Ranger Rick? He could have evidence in his digestive tract. - Come on, Bones. - Booth, evidence. - Fine, I'll go get your possum. - Opossum. - Possum. - Opossum. Bones - Season 04 Episode 04 "The Finger in the Nest" Synchro: ShalimarFox, Icefreak Subtitle: AÂ²S Team --==All-about-Subs.fr==-- The sternal rib end indicates the victim was between 35 and 40 years old. Length of the long bones suggests he was between - Five foot-eight and five-ten. - He? Bone density and skull indicators suggest male. Time of death... Approximately four days ago. Lividity indicates that he died somewhere else and was then dumped. Deep puncture wounds to the trachea pierced the jugular. He bled to death. I'll make an impression of the wound, see if we can't specify a murder weapon. First we look for particulates. Bull penis. Beg your pardon? The fanny pack had dandruff-sized flakes of bull penis in it. Why are you spying on me? Could it be because I'm the dupe of an organ of the shadowy forces that secretly run this country? You got the dupe part right. Freeze-dried bovine phallus. You know where to find me if you wish to discuss anything. Yeah... The problem isn't finding you, it's avoiding you. Okay. The skull was badly mangled, so I was only able to construct a partial, but I cross-checked physiological markers against the missing persons database, and it yielded three possibilities. Robert Sanchez, 24... Too young. Michael Minden, former basketball coach, thirty-nine. Too tall. That leaves Dr. Seth Elliot, veterinarian, 37. - Any objections to Dr. Elliot? - He falls into the parameters. Plus, Dog-trainers use freeze-dried bull penises as rewards. He was a veterinarian. How do you know the bull penis stuff? He's middle-aged and he's held every possible job. Four boys, seven dogs, 14 guinea pigs, one reticulated python... You get the point. I got it. Oh, God. I've always hated that fanny pack. That's blood on it, isn't it? What happened? Mrs. Elliot, when did you last speak with your husband? Ex-husband. On Thursday, we made arrangements for Seth to pick up Brando. We have joint custody. And Brando is...? - Your cat. - That's a dog, Booth. I... Thank you. So... - Seth Elliot never picked up Fido? - Brando. The dog? Seth's dead, isn't he? I'm afraid so. May I hold your dog while you cry? He's so compact. Brando adored Seth. So did I. Wow, not so many ex-wives speak so fondly of their former husbands. I never wanted to divorce Seth. Then why did you? You know, Seth had a serious gambling problem. He would either lose our car payment, or he would come home with diamond earrings And when he lost our house, filing for divorce was supposed to be a wake-up call. And he never woke up. No. Listen, do you have the, bookie's name? No. Ask Karen. - Who's Karen? - Who's Karen? I've been Dr. Elliot's assistant, receptionist, whatever, for, like, eight months. Murder? His remains were found in the Jefferson Memorial Park. Oh, my God. Poor Seth. I don't know what'll happen to this place now. Was it doing well? We made barely enough to pay the rent, cover his salary, mine and... and the kid who sweeps up. So, no. Not very well. Seth didn't tell me everything, but I could sense he was under a lot of pressure. He tossed and turned all night. So you slept together? He's divorced. I'm single. There's nothing enervating about it. Oh, for future reference, that word doesn't mean what you think. Look, are you aware that Dr. Elliot had a gambling problem? That was Seth's one fault. We'd like to talk to his bookie, if you know where he is. I don't think that's how Seth gambled. - How did he gamble? - Online poker. Mostly. Can you think of anything else? Just after I started here, Seth caught a guy stealing drugs. He wrestled him to the ground, called the cops. Everyone said Seth was a hero. - What kind of drugs? - Ketamine. It's an animal tranquilizer. And the guy went to prison. Do you think he killed Seth for revenge? You know, thank you for your help. We're sorry for your loss. Come on, Bones. Without Seth, I'm paralyzed. I don't know how I'll find the energy to go on. Now that is what "enervating" means. - Bones. - What? Okay, Tucker Payne. He was found guilty of stealing drugs from Dr. Elliot's vet clinic, sentenced to two years and he was paroled one month ago. I'll have the drug thief's parole officer bring him in for questioning. - Brennan. - Dr. Brennan, Hodgins found saliva. - Where? - On the victim. But why was Hodgins looking for saliva? I wasn't looking for saliva. I found it. Giant difference. Oh! Easy, pal. Watch your tone. I don't care about tone, I just care about results. Dr. Hodgins was looking for particulates on the mandible and vertebrae that might lead to a murder weapon when he found saliva. There was enough saliva in the wounds to run a DNA profile. It had to be the possum, right? The puncture wounds indicate something larger. - Hey, who's that? - A fraudulent used car salesman. Booth, meet Mr. Starret. I ran the standard eight nuclear markers for canids... What is that, like some kind of a bug? - Not a bug, Agent Booth. - Canis lupus familiaris. See how annoying that interrupting know it all used-car salesman thing can be? I mean, I'm sorry, what is a can-ass... Familiar-ass...? Domestic dog. Seth Elliot was killed by a dog with filed teeth. Tucker Felix Payne. You really must hate your parents for naming you that. It's a good name. Felix means "lucky." Assault, possession of various restricted weapons, various drug offenses. You don't seem so lucky. You should see the stuff they didn't get me on. Was it good luck that you got taken down by a veterinarian? I was so high I could've been taken down by a florist. Yeah. The vet is dead. You get paroled, vet turns up murdered. You see where I'm going with this? Make your dog bark? You told me to bring Schatzi so you could hear him bark? Schatzi? It means "treasure" in German. Yeah, I want to hear Schatzi bark. Gib Laut! I can't see its teeth. Want to show me his teeth? Why do you file its teeth down to points? I'm a drug dealer. You people catch me with a gun, I go away forever. - Schatzi your choice of weapon? - Never had to use him yet. - Were you really going to shoot my dog? - I got nothing against your dog. I was going to shoot you. See, I'm going to take your dog. Man, you got a warrant for my dog? That's cold. Per your instructions, I Microsiled the lethal bite mark. - See here? - An irregularity in the wound track. Yes. I took an impression of Schatzi's bite. Who's Schatzi? Drug dealer's dog. Sei jetzt sch n brav! He responds to German commands. Very intimidating. The dog that killed Dr. Elliot has a pronounced crack in its canine tooth, and the neighboring bicuspid shows a slab fracture. - Very distinct. - So Schatzi's not our killer? Schatzi is innocent. Hey, Hodgins. City police found the vet's car. A forensics crew is going through it now. Booth wanted me to make sure they didn't screw things up. Hey, deal with it. I hope you find something 'cause this puppy's innocent. Yeah, well, we're finding gobs of dried blood. It's a vet's vehicle, could be from one of his patients. - It's not. - Don't listen to him. You'll end up buying this blood soaked heap for three times its value. I worked as a vet's assistant in college when I was studying to be an EMT. We were as careful with blood as any human doctor. You ever think this vet didn't live up to your high standards? Most likely, the car was used to transport the victim's body, - and then dumped. - That does make more sense. I found a... Excuse me. The crack FBI team found a prescription bottle of erythromycin. That's not an animal drug. That's a macrolide antibiotic used for a number of conditions. Including acne and STDs. Four boys. Maybe we got lucky, and the bad guy dropped his prescription. Bottle reads "Donald Timmons." We should track him down. That is an absolutely wonderful idea. That could only have sprung from the time-tempered mind of a man with your life's experience ripping off unsuspecting car enthusiasts. I feel better. You treat everyone like crap. Look at that pit? Muscles like cantaloupes. Is that why we're not getting out? No, it's the country, Bones. They got a different way of doing things. - You're afraid of the dog. - No, I'm not. What you do in the country is you sit in your car and you wait. It's rural-polite. - Parker had a nightmare. - About severed fingers? No. It was a singing frog. I don't see the connection, but then I'm one of those people who thinks if you dream about a bana, it's probably just a bana. He's acting up in school, he's talking back to his mom, - he's not flushing the toilet. - He's a boy. Okay. Yeah. I get it. You saw a whole lady's corpse when you were a little girl, and you were fine. Yes. Although, for some reason that I do not understand, I kept staging my own death. Pretending that I drowned in the bathtub, faking electrical shock. It really freaked my parents out. And then, once, when Russ found me hanging, he had to go see the school psychologist. But otherwise you were fine? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Do you dream about banas a lot? Why? Can we get out of the car now? Quiet. Don Timmons? Why you just waiting in the car? Gladys wouldn't hurt you. FBI Special Agent Booth. This here is my associate, Dr. Brennan. - Do you know Dr. Seth Elliot? - Sure, I do. Went to high school with him. He's my vet. Why? He was murdered. Oh, man. Hey, Robbie. Hey, Robbie! What's up? Seth died. - What happened? - This is the FBI. They say he got murdered. This is my boy Robbie. He used to work for Seth part-time. Can you think of a reason why Dr. Elliot's car would be full of blood? No. No. It's not like he ran an animal ambulance or something. You ever ride in his car, Mr. Timmons? No. Never. Why? When it's bagged like that, it means it's evidence, Dad. It's not his. It's mine. Dad, it's a murder investigation. They don't care about insurance. I'm too old to be on my dad's insurance. He got the prescription under your name? But that's fraud. That's working around a system that doesn't care about people like us. Listen, I'm the father. Robbie shouldn't be held responsible. How about you? You been in Dr. Elliot's car recently? Last... last time was on the weekend. We did a gelding over at Danny Oliver's place. What about Tuesday night? Where were you? I was at my tutor's. I'm trying to get my GED. Hi. Robbie's going to go to medical school if it kills both of us. I was kind of thinking I'd be a vet. Yeah. Well, that's a good backup if you crap out on medical school. We're going to need the tutor's name, address, all that stuff. It's Andrew Hopp. He'll vouch for Robbie. Gladys is a very nice animal. Yeah. Dad really trained her great. Gladys, come. Sit. Lay down. What? That's impressive. No sense in owning a dog if you can't control it. - Gladys' teeth are not filed. - What? Dr. Elliot was killed by a dog with sharpened teeth. Bones, what are you doing? Enough playing with the dog. What? Seth was murdered by a dog? The murder was a human being. The murder weapon was a dog. Back to this, are we ? You staring at me? Well, I have concerns, Dr. Hodgins. About me? Yeah, you seem to have completely abandoned your paranoid conspiracy theories. I'm not a trained psychologist, like you, but that sounds like a good thing. Dr. Saroyan, I've found something important I need to show you. Conspiracy was the central idea around which you organized your sense of self. Also, I can't help but note that you're not paying quite so much attention to your personal appearance. Less paranoid and less vain. Again, that sounds like a good thing. These kind of changes in a man's life indicate intense distress. Would you like to discuss this with me? I'd rather drive a motorcycle full speed into a bridge abutment. Do you... Do you often entertain suicidal thoughts? No, I'm more homicidal in nature. Pretty sure you're not saying that in earnest, but as a way to keep me at arm's length. I'm here. What's up? Oh, do you mind? I have work to do. You need to talk about these things, Dr. Hodgins. If not with me, then with someone else. Dr. Saroyan. What have you got? I found some particulates that the geniuses at FBI forensics missed. From the victim's car? Crushed exoskeletons of copepods and other crustaceans. Yeah, I don't know what it means either. So, you called me over here to...? Make Sweets go away. Not an appropriate use of your boss, Dr. Hodgins. It worked, didn't it? Thanks for coming in to the Jeffersonian, Dr. Hopp. I'm not a doctor yet. I'm only a third year medical student. So, you tutor Robbie Timmons? Yeah, twice a week... Here's a complete record of our meetings. I'll take that. Thanks. So, you do a little, uh, needlepoint on the side? It's used to practice suturing. Next year, we use actual corpses. So, what is, uh, Robbie like? He's a good kid... He's never going to be what his dad wants, but he tries hard. I'm sorry, I have to run. I got a class. Did you ever meet Dr. Elliot? The vet that Robbie worked for? The one who got murdered? Yeah, yeah. I take it you didn't like him, huh? Uh, I was raised not to speak ill of the dead. Yeah, well, I was raised to ask questions like that, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist. I met him maybe twice, and I'm pretty sure he was tweaking. - What's that? - He's a meth addict. I'm just not sure Seth Elliot was the best role model for Robbie Timmons. Did Robbie Timmons' father know? No way. Old Don's a pretty straight arrow. Robbie's his main project, so... Thanks for coming in. Thanks for letting me see this place. It's legendary. It's dogfighting. I hate this job, so I'm quitting to go run a gallery in Dubai. Oh, it's just disgusting. We got the subpoena to download Dr. Elliot's PDA records from the server. These were on his PDA? Time-stamped the day of his death. Fighting pit, spectators. A rape stand used to restrain uncooperative females. The smaller cages are for bait... Small animals used as rewards for the winners. They teach you that in anthropology school? Pitting animals against each other is a common pastime in evolving cultures, where violence is more commonplace and animal life has no value. To men. No value to men. - Yes, it's always men. - Here we go again. Okay, you two, don't get all, you know, Xena: Princess Warrior, on me. I guess we know now where Elliot liked to do his gambling. Wait, Ange, go back. Right there, can you magnify that? What, that blob? There's something familiar. It's Gladys' ball. - Who's Gladys? - Could be enough to get a warrant if the judge had a glass of wine or two at lunch. Dubai, people. I'm going to go sell Inuit art to gazillionaires. Sweets, you got a minute for me and Parker here? There you are, actually right here in my office without an appointment or... Hi, Parker, I'm Dr. Sweets. His face doesn't look like a baby's behind. Look, okay, he's having nightmares. He's not eating. He doesn't want to go to school, and suddenly, he's afraid of meteors. Giant flaming rocks from outer space? Who wouldn't be afraid? You know, I can still hear you. Okay, hum, hum, okay, got it? Hum. I know all this is connected to him finding that finger. I'm not some radio advice hack who performs diagnoses over the phone. This is exactly why I brought him here in person... Cure him. No, it doesn't really work that way. Therapy with a child is... I thought I was going to run out of breath. I'm going to run out of breath when I run upstairs and get that warrant from that senile judge. Ten, 15 minutes? Is that good enough time? Bye, have fun. Are you my babysitter? Parker... that is exactly what I am. The judge said no. Gladys' ball wasn't enough for a warrant. Why? Because over two million of them were sold last year. Well, we did our best. Next case. We need evidence that the Timmons place is used for dogfighting. All right, well, I found crustaceous material in the victim's car. It's an antifungal treatment used on Astroturf. That doesn't link us with dogfighting either. Yeah, it does. All right, here we go. Brennan said that this was the dogfighting ring. So it's Astroturf? If this Astroturf cleaning stuff was delivered to the Timmons place, that should get us a warrant. You're a genius. No, you're the genius. Okay, people, what we're looking for is evidence of a dogfighting operation. Mr. Millan, thank you so much for coming. - I hope I can help. - I've seen you on TV. Thank you. No, I only stated a fact... There's nothing inherently complimentary about being on television. She's happy you're here and so am I. - What's going on here?! - You know what? Serve them this warrant, tell we're looking for Astroturf. - So where do we look first? - Start with the larger outbuildings. You don't hurt the ones you love. You don't send the ones you love to their death for entertainment. You must really hate these guys. I really do. What is it? He said that the dogs fight to their death, so... We should have expected this. It's a mass grave. These seem to be all dog bones, but there's other stuff, too. Some trash, betting slips. We'll send it back to the Jeffersonian. See if we can trace the betting slips. Find these people and charge them. Yes, that would make me feel a bit better if we did that. Agent Booth, we found something. Dogfighting ring, the Astroturf. It's just like the pictures on Elliot's PDA. Find any dogs? Yes, quite a few, in fact. Down. - How does he do that? - He's a dog whisper. You didn't do anything. Dogfighting ring, there remains of a dozen dead dogs. And you're gonna tell me all that happened a hundred yards from your house and you had no idea what was going on? I never go to the barn. I, uh, I ran an ad. Numbered company. Don't tell me. They pay cash, and you never met the tenant. That's right. As far as I know, they use it for storage. How involved was Dr. Elliot? I have no idea what you're talking about. He owe you money or maybe you just wanted a bigger cut. Let me go or get me my lawyer. Whatever happened, you know what? Four days ago, you snapped. You had one of your trained dogs attack him. Four days ago? I'm a driller, Agent Booth. I dig wells mostly, some pylon holes. Four days ago I was at an auger seminar in Chicago. Can you corroborate that? Airplane tickets, hotel receipts, about 60 eyewitnesses. I'm kind of the life of the party at those things. I know how to organize a good time. Just like you know how to organize a dogfighting ring. I don't know anything about what goes on down at that barn. Hey, stop that now. Could I see your teeth, please? That's not how you do it. Sss. Down. Down. No, it's not a match. That mold you made, it's like Cinderella's slipper. That story never made sense to me, but yes. Hey, stop that now. It's not as easy as it looks. Down. - It's a match. - Are you positive? This is the killer dog, yes. I'm sorry, buddy. So sorry, buddy. Should I be looking out for anything in particular? Yeah, flashy crap you can sell to a gullible kid. I didn't sell you that car, you bought it. You saw those horizontal scallops and you just had to have it. I suggested that you look under the hood, but all you did was sit behind the wheel and make vroom-vroom noises. I was 20 years old. All these years later you're still blaming me? You're not 20 anymore, Dr. Hodgins, so cut it out. You know... I'm sorry. I just... I've just been having a lot of problems recently. I'm sorry to hear that. My best friend who used to work here with me, he got himself into a lot of trouble. I really miss the guy. Dr. Hodgins... You know, Angela? She and I, we were engaged to be married, and... That went south, too. That's a lot to bear... Especially if you feel responsible. Yeah, I do. I do feel responsible. You shouldn't be talking to me. Of course not. I'm sorry. What I mean is, I'm not the right person for you to confide in. This is my last day here. I leave for a dig in Arizona tomorrow. There are people around here who seem to like you very much. People who are concerned for your happiness. What's this? It's a computer chip. Pet owners have them embedded in their animals in case of theft or loss. But... you knew that, didn't you? I got a message that you have something to tell me about Parker. You we're right. Parker is traumatized. It has nothing to do with the finger in the nest. He has a girl problem. Girl? He's six. The girl, her name's Stephanie Clyde. She's somewhat large. Likes to pick him up and carry him around. Carry him under her arm? Like a pet monkey. He doesn't know what to do. He says you told him never to hit girls. I told him never to hit anyone. You know, unless it was for self-defense. She, uh, carries him around? Like a monkey At recess, she thinks he's cute. What about the finger? Parker actually wishes that you'd let him have the finger so he could show it to Stephanie and maybe make her barf. Why doesn't he just run away? Well, when I suggested that, he told me very proudly that his father never ran away from anything. Proudly? - He said that? - I think you know what to do. We've all had our Stephanie Clydes, right? No one's ever carried me around like a monkey, especially a girl. Of course not, me neither. This is exactly where the microchip would be embedded. Ten digits. FBI can use it to track down Ripley's owner. If it's his microchip. - Ripley? - According to The American Veterinary Identification Device database, - his owners brought him here. - To be put to sleep. It's true. Do you know why? Why? Because they didn't know when they bought him that he'd get so big. You didn't euthanize Ripley? Seth couldn' The dog was completely healthy. - Instead, he found Ripley a new home. - Where? That I don't know. Ripley ended up at a dogfighting facility run by Don Timmons. No, Seth devoted his life to saving dogs. He simply wouldn't do that. Not on purpose. Hey, Bones, Don Timmons' alibi checked out. He was in Chicago... What are you doing? I'm just going through the case to see if I missed anything. The dog should be, you know, in the cage. - He killed Seth Elliot. - Well, it's not his fault. He's actually a very nice dog, aren't you? He reminds me of you. Me? He's got warm and reassuring brown eyes, and he's capable of great violence. Hey, great. Thanks a million. Wait, Booth, look at this cruelty. They send dogs into fight, to die or be hurt, and then they stitch them back up and they send them out to fight again. We've been assuming it's been Seth Elliot doctoring these dogs. - Well, he was a vet. - But look... Common suture stitch. See here how it's uneven in the same way. - And there's an "X" at the end. - So? It's distinctive. And I've seen it before. Common suture, uneven... "X" at the end. Same thing. It's like a fingerprint. The thread is green nylon. You better believe we'll match it. Stitching up wounded animals isn't a crime. What's going on? Just everybody shut up, and we'll be fine. - Everyone, this is Ripley. - He killed Dr. Elliot. None of us ever saw that dog before. We can tie Andy here to all of these wounded animals and to Ripley. Is that that guy from TV who talks to dogs? You see, we want to know who sicced Ripley here on Seth Elliot. We don't need you. We know you were in Chicago. Would you mind clapping like this? - No, we won't do that. - Do it, Robbie. - What? - You're not his master. Do it. It's not him. Look at that. He's waiting for your command. Maybe my dog killed Dr. Elliot, but that doesn't mean I made him do it. Ripley's a good dog. He wouldn't attack unless he was ordered. Tell these people what you know about Seth Elliot. I- I saw it. Andy told Ripley to attack because he saw Dr. Elliot taking pictures of the dogfighting. I don't know how to do this. Mostly you just tell me what's on your mind. Mostly on my mind is I hate everyone. Everyone? To varying degrees, but, um... yeah, yeah, everyone. Angela... the most. Because we, you know, had something great and... And now it's dirt. Zack... for being such an idiot. Brennan for bringing us all together. Cam for making us efficient. Booth for giving us a mission. You for pick, pick, picking at me. Should I go on? No, no, I get the point. I just hate everyone. So, what? Intense therapy, heavy medication? No. I'm good with the hate. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I am. You're doing fine. I hate everyone. You're coping. It's a coping technique. Coping's good. Did you get your degree on the Internet? Let me see your diploma. You're working. You're living a life of purpose. You haven't turned your back on your friends. Except I hate them all. You're independently wealthy, right? You don't have to work. And yet you choose to stay with the people you hate. Which makes me completely nuts. No, you've replaced one way of seeing the world-- paranoia... With another: misanthropy. Soon you'll replace misanthropy with something nicer, but for now, temporarily? I'm satisfied with your coping technique. My coping technique of hate? Correct. So... Are you, like, my therapist now, or...? No, we work together. Great. See ya at work. Robbie Timmons gave a statement. Andrew Hopp set the dog on Seth Elliot. Apparently Elliot was furious when he found out the dog he'd given to Timmons was used in dogfighting. Dr. Elliot took all the photos to turn into the police. Andrew Hopp would have lost his main source of income. He would have been forced to leave medical school. What about the people in the dogfighting ring? Don't worry about it. We'll round them up. So... - What do you got there? - I've decided to adopt Ripley. - Bones... - I've already contacted a dog walker and a doggie day care place, and my dad will take him when I leave town. I got a little tag. See? Ripley Brennan. He was put down. - What? - I'm sorry. He killed someone, and they had to put him down. It wasn't Ripley's fault. People made him do what he did. I know. I'm sorry. You can tell he's a good-natured dog. They put him down? Damn it. Bones, I'm sorry. What are they going to do with his remains? Can I do that? You sure? Yeah. You dug it. So did Sweets help you with Parker? I told Parker that it's... best just to walk away sometimes. What, sometimes? Isn't it always better to walk away?

I don't know if that was the right thing to say, but... You're a very good father. So, do you want to say something? I feel that this dog, Ripley, paid a price that was unfair. It's not my fault. - Why are you talking to me? - You're the only one here. Talk to the universe... or God or Ripley. I don't believe in God. God spelled backwards is "dog." And Ripley is dead. Plus, he's a dog, with, you know... limited vocabulary skills. Bones, just... Speak from your heart. On behalf of humankind, universe, I'd like to apologize for what happened to Ripley. He was born a cute little puppy... and then the people who adopted him wanted to kill him because they were too stupid to realize that he would grow into a big dog. That's good. Ripley was a good dog. He didn't want to fight. But he did it to please his master. He didn't want to attack a human being, but he did it to please his master. You know, it wasn't Ripley's fault that his master was cruel and selfish. Like all dogs, Ripley only saw the good in people. Dogs are like that. People should take a lesson. - Is that enough? - Yeah. As much as any good dog... hey... could hope for. Even with limited
