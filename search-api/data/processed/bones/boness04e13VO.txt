Move the puck, Wendell! Move it! Move the puck! Up here, Booth. Up here! Back on D. Pick 'em up, on D, pick 'em up. Go, Booth! Go, Booth! Go, Booth! Kill 'em, Booth! - What did he do that for? - It's what Booth does. Keeps the other team honest. He's what you call an enforcer. What, like law enforcement? - Yeah, okay. - Well, let's go with that. Oh, what was that? What about the cross-check? Ref, are you blind? Pass it! I'm open! Pass it! I'm open! Pick him off! That was a cheap shot, Carlson. Yeah, you guys suck. That's 24 Blue, two minutes for charging. - For what? - What about the cross... Get in the box! Come on, man. It's hockey. Club hockey, and some of us have to go work in the morning, OK, pal? - Enough. Let's go. - Carlson, calm down! Skate away. Go in the box. Go on, get in there and sit down. Sit down, crybaby. Let's go. So, this is punitive, right? To be sent to this little area here? Keep your head up next time, number 12. Keep your head up. Yeah, yeah, I'll be waiting. Come on! It's called a penalty box, you know, send in. Yeah, Booth committed a penalty when he checked the big guy when he didn't have the puck. Stay with him, Paul. There's a hit right there, Ref, that you missed again. Booth seems quite anxious to get out of the disciplinary box. Yeah, I've never seen him this agitated before. Open man! - That's not good, right? - No. Go, Booth! Wendell might get a basket! Elbow, Ref! Elbow! - Is Wendell okay? - That can't be legal. It definitely is not. Come on, what are you doing, Carlson? Want to go? Come on, come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go. You're a dirty player, Carlson. You don't take shots at my guys. You got that? Ends here. OK, Carlson? Ends here. - Booth seems to be winning. - Well, it's Booth I'm worried about. No more. I'm gonna have to call a game misconduct on that one. You get up off the ice, we'll finish this in the parking lot. Come on. If you did your job, I wouldn't have to do it for you. He's hitting my guys. Son of a bitch. Get up. You all right? - Oh, did I score, man? - Oh, yeah. Yeah... Come on. I do not know how I feel about this. It's very primal. I like it! It just a little too much. - Come on, team. - All right, come on, let's focus. So, you still seeing double? Only when I open more than one eye. Your hand's busted. Yeah, well, you know, guy left his helmet on. Hey, you two all right? - What? - Want to wait outside? Your hand might be broken. - Do you want me to look at it? - It's OK. Wait outside please. It's a men's locker room, Bones. There comes a time in ice fishing when it's time for the father to turn the drilling over to his son. Man, this is a great day. You give me a beer, let me run the augur. You're 18, Leo. You start drilling holes, it's safety first. - You got me? - Yeah. Nothing I'm saying here applies only to ice augurs. You get me? - All right. - Good. You know, that way, you don't fall through the ice and die, or get a disease, - or get pregnant. - Dad, come on. - Okay. Go ahead. - All right. That a boy. Keep her perpendicular. Once you get it in a little bit, you can speed her up, let her rip. All right, let her rip. Dad, she... she's bleeding. - I... she's bleeding. - Pull out. Pull out. Oh, I hope that's fish. You better go wait in the truck. What do you think there, Bones? I would surmise that the body went into the lake before it froze, then the lake froze, then the body floated up and became attached to the bottom of the ice. I meant, was he murdered? Maybe. Could have been an accident or a suicide, except... - You shouldn't do that. - It itches, okay? Yeah, well, except for what? Trauma to the left maxillary orbit suggests violence. - It's kind of gross, what you're doing. - Gross? You got your finger in some guy's maxillary orbit. I don't think there's anything else to be learned here, so let's get this Popsicle back to the lab. Hey, look at that. Bones, you made a joke. Well, I can be quite amusing. Wait a second. You aren't wearing any gloves. Bones, I... Remember that guy I punched out last month during my hockey game? Yes. When you broke your hand. That's him. I'm a suspect. Here. Bones - Season 04 Episode 13 "The Fire in Ice" Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak Subtitle: AÂ²S Team --==All-about-Subs.fr==-- Given that Agent Booth is currently the prime suspect in this murder... - We don't know it's a murder. - Look at that, I'm the prime suspect. Agent Payton Perotta here will be working with Dr. Brennan. I won't work the case without Booth. In that case, I invite Agent Booth's continued participation. In the background as an advisor. Agent Payton Perotta has earned bachelors degrees in both forensic science and criminology. Well, anything short of a doctorate is virtually useless at my level. - How would you like to proceed? - Well, it's pretty obvious. We definitely want to interrogate the primary suspect, right? Yeah. Based on decomp, I'd put time of death at about five days prior to freezing. Local cops say the lake froze over 3 weeks ago. Aside from some dormant anopheles mosquito larvae, whatever the water from the lake tells us, it'll be through a microscope. If Booth is a suspect, then I should be, too. This guy scrambled my brains. Your alibi is that you were seeing double and being taken care of by your mother. I'll get on the fluid samples you took from the lungs and esophagus. Could be the vic was drowned somewhere else and then dumped in the lake. No. Drowning's not the way Booth would kill someone. Not that I actually suspect Booth. At all. Quit staring at me. In the course of the game, the victim and I exchanged blows. - Who initiated the fight? - It was hockey. - So, it was spontaneous combustion? - The guy hit two of my players. - The ref... he didn't catch that. - And that made you angry? Not angry enough, you know, to chase him down after the game and kill him. Where did you go after the game? Bones drove me and Wendell to the hospital. So, no alibi that night or the next? Bones and I are just partners. Okay. Now you're answering questions I had no intention of asking. Is it your contention that, your argument with the victim was constrained to the ice? That is my contention. 'Cause I have a-a witness who stated you told Carlson, and I quote, "You get up off that ice, and we'll settle this out in the parking lot." Trash talking. Let me cut to the chase here. - Did you kill Pete Carlson? - No. - Did you dump his body in the lake? - No, I did not, Agent Perotta. Do you feel that your experience as the child of an abusive alcoholic has made you more prone to violence? Excuse me. What the hell are you doing? It's part of my job to assist the interrogating agent. You know I didn't murder anyone. What you're doing now is you're studying me. - That's part of our agreement, too. - You have a question for me, you ask me yourself. Don't use her. All right, okay, two questions. One: am I picking up some sexual tension between you and Agent Perotta? How the hell do I know what you're picking up? Two: underneath your affable exterior is a deep reservoir of rage. My question is, do you always have that under control? You know, if I didn't, you'd be dead right now instead of just wincing. - I'm not wincing. - Don't ever bring my old man up again. Rats. I winced. So... Do you have any more questions? Thank you. Yeah. - You work out much? - Yeah, I'm pretty consistent. You look like you take excellent care of yourself. Okay, this is useless. Both patellas are fractured. - As though he'd fallen to his knees? - Yeah, with a great deal of force. - During a hockey game? - No, not if he wore pads. I believe that this is the cause of death. Penetration of the lachrymal sac here, deep into the inferior orbital fissure. Yeah, I would have thought a small caliber bullet, but... No sign of bullet fragments. Yeah. This is Pete's apartment. He wasn't the best housekeeper. Ms. Withers, was Mr. Carlson up to date on his rent? Good question. Great start. Yes. Mostly. 500 bucks short. He didn't need much. He was a big kid at heart. Poor Pete. What he really loved was hockey. I wouldn't be surprised if that's why he joined the volunteer fire department. I even got him this necklace. Crossed hockey sticks. - You attended his games? - Oh, all of them. - Yeah. - You were a couple? It looks like someone went through all of his belongings and then left them on the floor. It always looked like that. The car outside with the flat tires, is that his? Yeah, somebody slashed the tires just before he disappeared. Why didn't you report him missing? I thought maybe... I thought he was staying with someone else. There's a lot of bills here. "Final notice, past due..." Looks like he couldn't afford to feed his fish, either. "Albie, Thursday, 11:00 p.m." Do you know who Albie is? I don't know. This is blood. It's a hockey jersey. Hockey players bleed sometimes when they play the game. Ms. Withers, how bad were his financial problems? Well, a couple days before Pete disappeared, he asked me for $2,000. Did he say what for? He liked me. You know? He was one of these guys, he... he didn't say much, but he could be real sweet. And a man borrows money from a woman, it means there's a bond of trust, I don't understand your reasoning. I do. It's definitely... a bond of trust. You're absolutely right. We're terribly sorry for your loss. - Is that our victim? - Yes. The last of the tissue samples. Wendell can clean the skeleton now and you can do your thing. You still think cause of death was a projectile through the left eye? Yes, but since we found no bullet, nor any indication of gunpowder residue in the wound, we're stumped as to what kind of projectile. The alveolus around the incisor is cracked, the socket caked with blood. This is a recent loss. He was a hockey player. So basically, we're talking about gladiators. And I love it. Perhaps the sight of males battling stimulates the part of your brain which has so far failed to find a suitable mate. And thank God you're here. The water I found in the victim's esophagus, not from the lake. Lake water is microorganism infested. Water in his throat, deionized brine water. He was killed, then dumped in the ocean then dumped in the lake? Deionized brine water freezes clear. It contains an antifreezing agent, which I know sounds counterintuitive... Ice rinks. Kind of jumped my punch line there, Dr. B. But, yes. We should see what rinks are closest to the lake. It's the one Booth played at. I find it interesting that the evidence keeps pointing toward Booth. Pete Carlson was murdered? He's indestructible. Not so indestructible. This guy took him down a few notches. Made him stay down, too. It was the heat of the game. Your guy crossed the line. He was our enforcer. Took the job real serious. Whoever got Pete must've got a drop on him. - Pete wouldn't go easy. - You mind my asking why nobody reported him missing? The night after you flattened Pete, we go up against the State Police. Then Pete gets into a beef with a big State Police left-winger. 'Cause you handed him his ass on a platter, Pete maybe had something to prove that night. You got a name? - Hey, Alex?! - Yo! Come here! The fuzz player that Pete got into it with his last game, remember his name? Yeah, Lou Herrin, number five. He took Herrin down with a cheap shot. He got tossed out the rest of season. Any chance that Pete and this guy, continued their fight off the ice? - People threaten. - Yeah, but nobody carries through. Yeah, keep it on the ice, right? If I were you, I would talk to Chloe. - Who's Chloe? - Chloe Bratton. Chloe's a puck bunny. Here and Pete put in some quality mattress time before he dumped here. Well, mattress really isn't, Chloe's style. - No offense. - None taken. I favor backseats myself. I can't believe Pete's gone. - How long ago did you two break up? - Break up? We didn't break up. - His teammates think you did. - No, we had this on-again/off-again thing. It was casual. No biggie. You didn't mind that he slept with different women? I wouldn't have minded if he did, but I happen to know he didn't. Well, I happen to know that he did. - Right. - Who? It doesn't matter, does it? Given that your relationship was so, casual? - You slashed his tires, right? - Agent... - No. - We can prove you did it, so here's the deal: you tell us the truth from now on, and we won't charge you with vandalism and obstruction of justice. Let's try it again. You slashed... Yes. Of course. Let's try this again. You slashed his tires, didn't you? Yes. I mean, he was sleeping with someone else. I got passions that take over sometimes. You know how it is when the guy you give yourself to just goes off with someone else. Who's... Albie? Albie? Albie runs this poker game in back of a Chinese food joint off I Street. Probably why Pete was broke all the time. So, who'd you say Pete was sleeping with? I think we've got enough information for today, Ms. Bratton. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Thanks. - Any luck with the murder weapon? - Yes. We are certain it is not a screwdriver. The blood on the victim's jersey was all his own. The rib cage has been bruised. - It has? - Yes. See this vague pattern of bone bruising? Yeah, it extends from the right clavicle through anterior ribs four through eight. He was struck repeatedly. Like, by a hockey stick? - During the game maybe? - Not during. The, padding would prevent that kind of bruising. I'll take a closer look. I can't believe I missed that. No, I can't believe you missed that, either. I was signaling you to encourage Wendell by saying anyone could've missed that, but... You should have said so. Booth says I stink at nonverbal communication. She said in the back. Just don't be pulling your gun until you go through the kitchen, or Mama-san there is going to hit the panic button. Okay, just... So you're ready to risk a gun fight with your weapon in the wrong hand? - I don't have a wrong hand. - I'm curious. When you shoot with your left hand, does it feel like somebody else is shooting? - What do we do now? - Okay, FBI. Okay, I'd reach for my badge right now, but... - Drop your weapons, please. - "Please"? The FBI does not say "please." Okay, look. I really don't care about the illegal gambling. I just want to talk to a guy named Albie about a guy named Pete Carlson. I'm Albie. First rule: don't kill the people who owe you money. All you get then is trouble and no money. How much money did Carlson owe you? Okay, so you got your operation shut down and moved out, because I can have my guys here in about what, three minutes to mop that back room up? Pete carlson was not a bad player most of the time, but... You know, every once in a while... He got brave and lost everything? - Gamble a bit yourself, do you? - I'm reformed. Tell me, when was the last time carlson got brave? Last month. But he paid up in full a couple days later. Cash? Little garish, don't you think? I don't know where pete got it, but it covered his debt. I'm going to have to take this. If I didn't intend to give it to you, you'd never have seen it. Okay, you gave me the time I needed to move my operation I gave you evidence. I call us square. You decide to get back into the game, you look me up. Right. Yeah. We gonna call this in? No point. Like the woman said, she's moved on. Hodgins confirmed that the traces of rink water in the victim's esophagus came from this rink. How did rink ice get into his throat? He was beaten, then a sharp instrument was thrust into his eye. There should be... blood stains. You're going to scan the ice with one little wand? I'll call in an fbi forensics team. - We'll have the whole place searched. - No need. All you need is black light, right? - Yes. - Right? I got a great idea, just stay here. It's very slippery, don't move. Ready? How's that, huh? Nice. Gonna work? Well, I see some... flecks of blood. No we're looking for something bigger than these... small specs and spots. The victim was stabbed in the eye. We're looking for a pretty significant puddle. Two guys get into a beef, then they put their street clothes on and then come back here on the ice to duke it out? No. - Booth? - Yeah? My god. This is going to turn out to be where pete carlson was murdered. This is all the ice from the crime scene, including the scrapings from the zamboni. We should be able to get enough dna out of this to confirm the blood is Carlson's. Human tooth. It's hockey. That zamboni probably had a hundred teeth in there. Looks like we found where the tooth fairy winters. - Did you find a match yet? - Just started. Cam says it's definitely the victim's blood. I haven't found the murder weapon. I know, I still haven't identified the nylon polymer I found on the victim's shirt. So, I've looked at, like, a thousand photos of those blood patterns at the rink. - And tons from the apartment. - Why, what are you looking for? Here's a blood pattern at the rink. The body was dragged in that direction. The body was dragged that way, but what are those drops over there? - What drops? - Those drops right there. They parallel the dragging body. And... They aren't smeared. These parallel drops aren't from the victim. They're from whoever dragged him across the ice. Well, that means we have to check for more than just pete's dna. Too bad we can't question the fish. What killed those fish? Not eating for three weeks. If that happened, they would eat each other. Grab your coat. We're going on a field trip. And tell cam to check the rink samples to find out if there was a second source of dna. I'm not really a big fan of this... barking out orders stuff. Agent Booth, it's come to the attention of the deputy director that you are a viable suspect in a murder case. Right, okay, and he wants you to make sure - that I'm not viable. - That's correct. Come on, sweets, you know I didn't kill anyone, so... You know, put that in shrink talk and... write out your little form and send it in. Yes, of course, but to do that, I need to ask you some questions. Great. Shoot. I saw you in that game. You beat another man to the ice. It's hockey. I was protecting my teammate. - You broke your hand on his helmet. - It's hockey. Okay, you never played, did you? Oh, I'd run track and cross country and did some wrestling and ch... - Chess! Checkers? - No. - Didn't say that. - You know what? Then you know nothing... It's about teams, okay? And teamwork. Obviously you don't know anything about that, You joined the army. You became a sniper. You joined the fbi. Do you see the the binding element in those choices? It's violence. Or the love of uniforms. You ever think that? Agent Booth, I believe that you are ready to confront the fact that the violence you may have suffered in childhood - Has followed you into adulthood. - Fill out the form. Not now! Hiya, sweets. If you're about finished here, Booth, in accordance with the warrant you made me get, Pete Carlson's phone records are here. I'm the one that decides when we're done here. Of course you are, cherie, no offense intended. I'll be delivering the phone records to agent perotta. I thought I'd do that in your office. Thanks, cherie. We're done. Well, we are done but that was just a coincidence. Sweets, I've killed but I've never murdered before. Look up the difference in your little black book there, okay? This is legal, right? Absolutely. Okay. None of them look nibbled on. They should've gone at each other like a peruvian soccer team stranded in the andes. Then they all died at the same time. I don't see what this is going to tell us. How they died. No, no, I mean about the case. If brennan were here, she'd smack your face. Her philosophy is we find out the facts about everything, then see how it fits together. Photo opportunity. Pete made eight calls right after the game to the same number. Lou herrin. Who's that? A sergeant in the state cops. He exchanged blows with the victim the night that he died. Make it official. Question the cop. Let's get some leverage on the guy first. Put him at the murder scene, get a warrant to test his dna. Here we go. Get a warrant for this, Ms. Julian, get a warrant for that. You need grounds for a warrant, cherie. Don't they teach that at quantico anymore? What grounds have you got for that warrant? None! Nothing! You're just wishing. I know how to get some blood out of this herrin. - Legally? - Yeah, of course legally. How? It's a big game tonight, right? And sometimes during a game... People bleed. - I don't like it. - Then you don't have to show up. - What are you doing, man? - What does it look like I'm doing? You think that's a good idea? You got a couple of weeks on that cast. Considering I can't play with a cast, then yeah, it's a great idea. You clear about the plan? Somebody bleeds, I collect a sample, put it in a bag, - pass it off to Dr. Brennan. - Lou herrin, number five, he's our prime suspect. And I gotta make him bleed. You've worked with Booth for a while now, right? Is he the kind of guy that... you know, I... Is he... flirty? Flirty? Would you say he twinkles his eyes at all women? Twinkly eyes actually result when the pupils dilate very wide which is an unconscious result of intense interest or sexual attraction. So, no, he doesn't twinkle at everyone? No. All right. Is that the guy? That's him. Lou herrin, number five. You think he even knows how to bleed? Just keep your head up, all right? Come on, you should've called that. Pass it up! Keep your head up, herrin. What's your problem? I got a little chip, all right? Just play your hockey, pal. This guy's hard to get mad. He's maybe the only one who hasn't shed a drop. Stay out of my face! Keep your head up, huh! Take a warning, pal. I think I'm finally getting to this guy. Hope you survive it! Taking a little break? Luc Robitaille? Seeley Booth. Right. Let's go, let's play. Right. You're the greatest left-winger of all time. And you're the best player on your team. For what that's worth. All right, let's go. Come on, let's play. Here we go. Come on, show me something! Hey, come on, move, move! Move, move, let's go! Wait a second. I can't play hockey with you. I gotta solve a murder. You know, Booth... it's not about the blood. It's our best forensic clue. Forget the blood. - Then what? - You know what makes a team. Look at the team. It's about what brings a team together. The team. Look at the team. All right, let's go, one on one. Let's see what you got. Come on, b. Geez, ugh. I thought I could get by you there, you know? You'll never get by me. Right. Now, listen, Booth, you're not your father, okay? You protect the ones you care about, on the ice and off the ice. That's who you are. You're not your father. - you're not your father. - Booth? - You're not your father. - Booth? Bones, what are you doing on the ice? I get nervous when you fall down and don't get up. Come up here. - Up you go, buddy. - Come on. Don't worry, I got the blood. - Good work, Bones. - But I'm Bones. Smells like fish in here. Yep. It's the victim's goldfish. They died of ammonia poisoning. - How did that happen? - I don't know. Maybe the victim washed his aquarium with window cleaner? I don't know. How are things with you and roxie? Uh, good... Good. Taking it slow, you know. Letting things unfold in a... - Are you seeing anybody? - I, um... Actually went out on a date last night. - I'm glad to hear that. - Any little twinge there? Definitely a little twinge, yeah, but... Despite the twinge, I'm glad you're back in the saddle. Oh, I'm not back in the saddle exactly. It was just a first date. Barely got out of the barn. You saw the victim's apartment, right? Yes... Yeah. Yeah, it was a pigsty. I don't think that guy cleaned anything. Not with ammonia. Not with anything. I came as soon as I heard Booth had a brain injury. - What part of your head hurts? - The part above my shoulders. The doctor said he has a concussion. He shouldn't fall asleep. Otherwise, not serious. - Tell him about the hallucination. - You hallucinated? Luc robitaille gave me advice. You got advice on a murder case from... What did he say? He said, "don't worry about the... The player's blood." Very interesting. Lucky Luc told me to look in a different direction. - That's interesting. - Stop saying that... Just stop. Preliminary dna tests show that the blood mixed in with the victim's did not belong to lou herrin. Lucky luc was right. All that means is that you got your brains scrambled for nothing. Lucky luc is never wrong. This hallucination could be Booth's subconscious speaking to him through the voice and image of someone that he idolizes. Like a modern version of a vision quest? You know what, hallucination or not... lucky luc, he told me something about myself that... He told me something. I'd be very interested in knowing what he said. Lucky for me, you're never gonna find out because Bones is gonna drive me home and get me soup. There has got to be some reason these fish died of ammonia poison. Last time I did this, I ended up in juvie hall over the weekend. - What? - What? Nothing. Buried treasure. What do we do now? Find out why the hell he was hiding jewelery in a fish tank. Have any of you ever heard of something called "chain of evidence"? Why didn't you go with these two idiots to the victim's home? - Please don't call my people idiots. - We're not idiots. - I feel like an idiot. - You don't speak right now. Neither of you. It's a crime scene. My people are very often at crime scenes, it's what we do. No, it's not. You've got it in your heads that you're crime scene types. This is Booth's fault for indulging your fantasies. You are not crime scene types. You are lab rats. No chain of evidence was broken. When Dr. Hodgins and mr. Bray found the items, they immediately called me. I called Booth, and when his head hurt too much to talk to me, I called agent perotta. - What? - A photograph of dead fish led them to this. I think that kind of brilliance is worth it. You've been taken hostage by the squints, agent perotta. Turns out these items were reported destroyed in a fire. The victim was a fireman. The fbi could check to see if the firedawgs put out that fire. Stole from the fire, cleaned off with ammonia. Hidden in the aquarium, killed the fish. Okay. Now you are straying out of your territory. No, they got it right. The bracelet agents Booth and perotta recovered from the victim's loan shark was reported destroyed by that same fire. My people were right. Your people? We're Booth's people. They're on the firedawgs, but they also played on the same high school team. What brings them together? I'm back. Hey, what brings them together? What brings the team together? So, I got the soup from the place. And, yes, I told mama that it was for you especially. It's all about the team there. It's all... - what are you doing? - It's all about the team there. Bones, it's all about the team there. These four guys... they all played hockey together in high school, and now... they all play together as a team. They're all firemen? They all worked the jewelry store fire. One of these three guys is the murderer. According to Mr. Lucky? It's luc, okay? It is... It... It's not Mr. Lucky. It is luc robitaille. Left wing. Great shot. Luc robitaille... He's one of the best left wings of all time. What is this? It's a lace puller. Why? I think it might be the murder weapon. We want to discuss the jewelry store fire. - I want a lawyer. - What for, alex? We didn't do anything wrong. None of us did. What about pete? He break some kind of fireman code, something like that? Something like that. I've got nothing to say about any of this. I want a lawyer. We know carlson was beaten with a hockey stick, after which a lace puller entered his brain through his eye and killed him. What about your dream, ed? You were gonna play for the nhl, right? "Local player scouted by the nhl." Look at that one. Oh, this one's good, too. "Fralic's hat trick wins game." I got injured. This injury would end any chance of a career in professional hockey. What does that have to do with anything? I got hurt, now I sell siding, and I play hockey on the weekends. Why you got to rub his face in the past? Who ruined you? Pete carlson. It was pete. You knew about the stolen jewelry. How many of you were there the night he was killed? None of us. Nobody here had anything to do with that. We have the hockey stick, the murder weapon and dna. It's only a matter of time. Yeah. What? It was me. I asked to meet pete on the ice after everybody left. I told him to give back the stolen jewelry, and he said to me... he said to me that I was a... A coward. That I didn't do anything to him back in the day when he wrecked my life and I wouldn't do anything to him now. Well, he was wrong. I'm not positive this is a good idea. Oh, I got you! I got you. Stay up here. Okay, it's all right. Here we go, one more. You know what, I got to stay up all night, so who better to keep me company than you? You and me skating is saving you from slipping into a coma? Oh, easy, Bones. Now i'm gonna go down. I have a lot of natural athletic ability. Yeah, natural. I can... I can see that. Real smooth and natural. That's it. Well done. That agent perotta, she really... enjoyed working with us. Yeah. But, um... you're the only fbi agent I want to work with. Will you tell me what the lucky luciano told you? He's not an italian opera singer. Why do you always say that wrong? You do it on purpose, don't you? I would like to know what he said. He said that I'm not like my old man. He said I'm made of better stuff. I don't know your old man, your father, but... I think you're made of very, very good stuff. Hey, you know what? Forget about agent perotta, all right? Nothing's gonna change between me and you. Well, entropy is a natural force that pulls everything apart at a subatomic level. Everything changes. - Not everything, Bones. - Don't. You're gonna make me fall. I'm never gonna make you fall. I'm always here.
