Hell, no. But we're gonna need an I.D. ASAP. Could be dealing with a group that's acquired nuclear material. - It's actually glowing? - Oh, yes. I'll need a video link with my lab. Excuse me, Major. The reactor at Kensington is secure. All transports carrying radioactive material have been halted. Dr. Brennan's gonna need a video linkup to theJeffersonian. As soon as possible. The rain's really slowed things up. All right, thanks. See, uh, bodies, they don't usually glow. Yeah, well, that's why we're taking all these precautions. All right, this is potassium iodide. These are your suits. - Pills? - Yeah. It helps... the thyroid block the absorption of radiation. [Siren Wailing In Distance] You know, Angela turned down Hodgins again. - What? - Hodgins proposed. - Angela turned him down. - You really wanna talk about that now? Why not? There's been no confirmation of danger yet. It's just, you know, weird, you know, talking about, uh, marriage... when we're, you know, trying to avoid radiation poisoning. No, what's weird is Angela thinking about marriage at all. [Booth] People fall in love, and they get married. That's what people do. I thought you didn't want to talk about it. I'm just saying, you believe in love, don't you? I believe that dopamine and norepinephrine simulate euphoria... because of certain biological triggers... like scent, symmetrical features... - Symmetrical features? - Yes. It's an indication of a good breeder. You appear to be a very good breeder. [Chuckles] How long have you two been going out? - What? We're not... - We're... - We're partners. That's it. - We're partners. Huh. Me and my partner talk baseball. You might not want to admit it, Bones... but there are some things like love that just can't be measured in your lab. [Geiger Counter Clicking] Oh, what's that mean? Three hundred millirems. Oh, that's perfectly normal. If we get a reading of 3,000 or more, then we worry. It could be a weapon. - Nuclear? - The suits would be useless against that. - Oh, great. Thanks. - Body's in there. [Rats Squeaking] - Anybody getting an increase? - <i>[Man] All clear. It doesn't make sense.</i> [Flies Buzzing] Female, mid-20s... early 30s, Caucasian. Looks like she's been there a while. No, probably not that long. Rats and weasels work pretty quickly. - There's no radiation in here. - <i>[Booth] Then why the hell is it glowing?</i> I don't know, but it's your problem now. All right, guys. We're out of here. Multiple stab wounds. Why is she glowing? I have no idea. No idea at all. [Brennan] Nicks on the ribs and hemorrhaging in the adjacent intercostal muscles... are consistent with stabbing. Repeated stabbing. Someone was angry. Incise cuts on the left radius and ulna are congruent with defensive injuries. Still no answer for the luminescent bones? It's not like we get a human lightbulb in here every day. I've got mature first instar <i>Phaenicia sericata</i> about to molt. Indicates she's been dead approximately 48 hours. I gotta take more scrapings from the bones to analyze for luminescence. You can scrape this area. [Clears Throat] Okay, squint squad, why does she look like a glowstick? Why does everyone think my job is so easy? Wow. You weren't kidding. If we twirl her around, we can pretend we're at a rave. - What's the good word, Hodgins? - Hey, I am not a party trick. - Are you okay? - The bones probably remind him of Waitomo Cave. - Not true. - I've been there. In New Zealand. It's filled with tiny glowing worms. And in the darkness, it looks like thousands of stars. Very romantic. Yes. That's where he was going to take Angela for their honeymoon. If she'd said yes, which she didn't. Okay, look, people, Angela and I are cool, okay? But she's complicated. I will figure her out, though, just like these electric bones. Let's just go back to work, okay? - <i>[Saroyan] All right.</i> - <i>[Booth] Okay.</i> Nice bracelet. Do you need the left hand? No. Too fleshy and no stab wounds. Just how I like 'em. [Booth] Oh, God. What are you doing? Plugging a dike or something? The left hand was lodged under the body. A lack of exposure preserved some of the dermis. - We might be able to get a print. - <i>From that?</i> It's all... shriveled. Can you pour fabric softener? Yeah, sure. My mom used to use this stuff. I didn't know it was so, uh, scientific. - Say when. - That's good. - Do you think Hodgins is okay? - No. Not at all. Well, they seem to be jumping each other like rabbits. - Well, he wants more. - How sweet. - Oh, you think all a man wants is sex? - No, of course not. Beer too. Chips, salsa... Oh, come on, Cam. I mean, when we were together... you didn't think that we could... you know... Get married? No. Nah. Nah, me neither. I mean, but wasn't there a moment, just a moment where you felt... Whoa! Look at that! It's a finger again! Huh! You know what I felt, Seeley? I felt... satisfied. Very satisfied. And grateful that I had my own place, my own single life. And you were too. Why are we even talking about this? [Exhales] - Check this out. - [Beeping] Whoa. One perfect fingerprint. Unbelievable. All from fabric softener. Rehydrates dried tissue and fights static cling. Eh, geez. <i>Puffy</i> soft, huh? Twenty-one loads. Look at that. [Beeping] Okay. Carly Victor, 29. Carly Victor? - Do you know her? - Yeah. She's that celebrity chef. [Brennan] Carly's Table over on Calvert. Chef would explain the cuts to her left hand and the burns. All right, this is her MySpace page. Wait a second. Is that the place with the famous mac and cheese? - Yeah. It's, like, impossible to get into. - Totally impossible. - You too? - Well, mac and cheese, that's God's best handiwork. She puts leeks in it and... and little bits of pancetta. - It was delicious. - How'd you get in? I'm a best-selling author, Booth. I get in anywhere. I took Sully. - Did he have... - He said it was the best he ever ate. Why are all those pictures on her page? It's friends, different communities she's joined... blogs, her husband, cooking videos. Lot ofknives in the kitchen. Easy grab for one of these, uh, friends to stab her. Why don't you check the pages and see if anyone had a problem with her. I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill Carly. [Woman Chattering On Monitor] She came out to see if we were enjoying our meal. We talked for a while. I was... [Chattering] supposed to go back and see her next week. Are you okay, honey? Yeah. I'm just used to victims being strangers. - We're prepping the chicken. - [Beeps] [Carly On Monitor] That's how it is. That's how it gets the mostjuicy. And so... We should tell her husband, Booth. [Booth] Sure. # [Background: World] Welcome to Carly's Table. Do you have a reservation? - Like that's possible. - Oh, Dr. Brennan. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. We're very crowded tonight, so you might have to wait a few minutes. You can walk in here without a reservation? - We need to talk to Dan. - Carly's husband. - Oh, just a moment. - She knows he's Carly's husband. Bones, Bones, Bones. Mac and cheese! - Mac and cheese! - Booth! - Wow. That's amazing. - <i>[Woman] Dan, the truffles were awesome.</i> - <i>We'd love to tell Carly.</i> - Uh, she's a little slammed right now... but I'll be sure to pass on the compliments, all right? All right, take care. - So, Carly's in the kitchen? - Yeah. She's back there 24/7. You have to drag her out. Dr. Brennan, right? Yes. This is my partner, Special Agent Seeley Booth. - Hi. - We know she's not back there, Dan. I just can't imagine that she's... she's gone. I'm so sorry, Dan. When was the last time you saw her? Friday night. A lot of the restaurants around here have been getting robbed... so Carly didn't want to leave the cash here. She and Abby took the cash and drove it to the A. T.M. - Who's Abby? - <i>Abby Singer.</i> She and her boyfriend Ben are our business partners. Well, they're our friends first. Abby organizes Carly's endorsements. I mean, it's... it's not Abby as well, is it? No, we... we only... We only found Carly. Has Ben heard from Abby? Ben's, uh... He's in the guard. [Sniffles] And, um, he's been gone for the weekend. He should be back in a couple hours. Help me understand something here, Dan. Your wife disappears and you don't report her missing? She would take these spur-of-the-moment trips to Atlantic City... - with Abby to kind of blow off steam. - She wouldn't tell you first? No. She wouldn't tell me 'cause she didn't want me to say no. - Listen. What... What kind of car did they leave in? - She, um... [Sniffles] She had an old Volvo. Abby did. The picture was taken just before we opened. [Sniffles] I'll get a search team on it. [Beeping] You find anything? Yeah. Jealous chefs... vicious critics... fans that were a little too in love with her. Fame is creepy. They say chefs are the new rock stars. Huh. They do deal with knives and fire and food. It's pretty sexy. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Well, then tonight, I'll take a knife and fire... and make you an orgasmic grilled cheese sandwich. Oh, suddenly I am starving. [Footsteps Approaching] Oh, good Lord. You have to stop mounting each other in the office. Doesn't marriage destroy sex? Please, Angela, say yes. - We were working. - You were working <i>it.</i> A little professionalism would be nice, people. I found some organic material in a cut on her left hand. Need to know what it is. - I'm on it. - And you? Anything? Yeah. I found out how to make braised beef. - I found out that Carly loved sushi. I found out that... - <i>[Hodgins] Oh, my God!</i> Sushi. Yes. That is it. You are brilliant. You're my muse. Check out all the sushi restaurants on her site. - At least he didn't jump you. - True. [Booth] So you were with the reserves all weekend? Yeah. Fort Eustis, survival training. You're sure Carly was murdered? - Yes. - Isn't there anything I could be doing? Helping you look for Abby? I mean, I can't just sit here. We're doing everything we can to find her. You're looking for whoever's been robbing the other restaurants? Mm-hmm. We don't have a description yet. That's all. Why didn't Dan report them missing? Well, he said that they would take off sometimes, go to Atlantic City. Yeah, but still. The restaurant was booming. I mean, he should've known that she wouldn't just leave. Listen, do you, uh... You and Dan, you havin' problems? What? No. No, he just doesn't think sometimes. I mean, we're not in school anymore. I just would've done something. That's all. Look, here's Abby's picture if you need it. Just find Abby. Please. The sushi got me thinking. P. phosphoreum... a bacteria that grows in seafood. - A luminescent bacteria? - Exactly. <i>Vibrio</i> bacteria. Which, when catalyzed by luciferase, causes the bones to glow. So if the knife that was used to stab Carly contained <i>P. phosphoreum...</i> it would've entered her bloodstream. And it would be left on the bones as the tissue decomposed and was stripped by the rats. Seafood. So that narrows it down... to every restaurant in the area. No. The tissue Cam found, it's "uni"...sea urchin. A specialty in one of Carly's favorite sushi restaurants. Carly's blog mentions an old friend... who's the chef at a sushi restaurant. "Sushiguy23." How imaginative. "Executive chef at Sushi Beat Restaurant." [Angela] And when we link to his page... - <i>[Brennan] That's Carly.</i> - <i>[Saroyan] With Sushiguy.</i> [Angela] Yeah, and his knife. [People Speaking Japanese] [Shouting In Japanese] - Can you believe this place? - Yeah. Fresh toro today. They've cherry-picked the most marketable elements of a very complex and vibrant culture... and then repackaged them to turn a profit. - It's awful. - Yeah, well, so is murder, okay? So just stay focused. [Shouting In Japanese] Hey, Ernie. Have a minute? I guess. Can I get you anything? - No. We're just here to ask... - Well, sure. I mean, if you have some of that, uh, fresh toro left, that would be great. What? Might as well eat lunch while we're here. You and Carly Victor were high school sweethearts, right? Why? What's going on? Uh, when was the last time you saw her? Uh, Thursday of last week. - What? Something happen to her? - Do you serve sea urchin? Uni, yeah. It's one of my specialties. You want some? - No. - Sure. Is this about Dan? Did Dan find out she was with me? - Why? What's going on between you and Carly? - Nothing. We reconnected on MySpace. She wanted to learn aboutJapanese cuisine, so I was teaching her how to make sushi. Secretly? Why? Because Dan hated Japanese food? Because he's so jealous. Everybody loved Carly. It drove him crazy. Carly even left him once. Why'd she go back? Delicious. Thank you. What's going on? Is Carly okay? Carly's dead. Dan? That son of a bitch. We don't know who it was. But she was stabbed, Ernie... and we found bacteria associated with sea urchin in her system. It can only enter the body through the bloodstream. What? You think I killed her? Why would I kill Carly? - Well, that's more his area. - You love her. She says that she'll leave Dan. She doesn't. You get mad. She's got the fishy virus. You got all those fishy knives. Wait, wait. Last time Carly was here, she cut herself. And I wanted her to get stitches, but she wouldn't. I'd like to borrow your knives, Ernie... and compare them to the injuries we found on Carly. You know, a lot of people have knives like mine. Are you saying no? Because that really wouldn't look too good. Can I get a spicy tuna roll? I fed the measurements of the knives into the computer... angles of the blades, thickness... and compared it to the injuries we found on the bones. None of them match the damage evident on the cortical surface of the ribs... - or the defensive wounds. - <i>[Angela] No.</i> But we do have one match... this knife... and the cut on her left hand. The knife they used when preparing the uni. That must be how it entered her bloodstream. Sushiguy23 was telling the truth. So he's not the murderer. We can still eat at the restaurant. What? Booth said the toro was fantastic. Are you still torturing Hodgins? - He loves it. - Just tell him no. Put him out of his misery. - What if I wanna say yes? - You get married? Sometimes your brain just shuts off because you're in love. One can't logically base a decision on momentary happiness. Haven't you ever just looked at a guy and said "screw it"? Well, maybe not the best choice of words, okay, but... Like when you were with Sully. - Don't you regret letting him go? - I made a decision. Regrets serve no real purpose. If you want to be impulsive, why don't you just say yes? Because I've also got you in my head... telling me that marriage will hobble my personal and legal freedoms. - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> - You're a very difficult best friend to have. Brennan. I'll grab my things. Ernie's story checked out. Carly took out a restraining order on Dan... and Dan took out a two-million-dollar life insurance policy on her. - See? Marriage, it... - Oh, just go. I'm going. You guys had to shut down, huh? Yeah. Carly's without Carly doesn't make much sense. Yeah. That's gotta be rough. I mean, you know, absorbing that kind of hit financially. Look, man, his wife was murdered, and my girlfriend's missing. - Money is the last thing on our minds. - Yeah, right, right. Yeah. I understand. It's just, I mean, here you guys arejust pouring over the books. Most of our staff live paycheck to paycheck. - <i>You know? We have to pay them.</i> - Where's the other knife? I don't know. It's been missing for years. Carly actually got it as a gift from the first chef that she worked for. Mmm. Or maybe it's just been missing... - since you found out about Carly and Ernie Summers. - Ernie Summers? The sushi guy? - I'd like to take this set of knives. - Sure. - No. - Hey, relax, man. Just let them take the knives. These bastards cannot come in here and start accusing me. Carly was meeting up with Ernie secretly. You assumed the worst. - It's not true. - Confronted her. One thing led to another. - Carly was involved with him? - Maybe Abby heard you fighting and tried to get in the middle. You son of a bitch! [Grunts] She got caught up in the middle. - Get off of me! - I'd back down if I were you. He shot a clown once. - You're good? - Yes, I'm good. [Booth] We know about the restraining order and your drinking. What'd you do, Dan? Nothing. Okay? We had some problems. - I went into rehab. - You were drinking last week, Dan, before I left. - A couple glasses of wine, okay? The stress of everything. - Carly? - Yes, and Carly. - Why didn't you tell us about that insurance policy? - That was Ben's idea. - This restaurant would be worth nothing without Carly. We have investors. We had to protect them. But if you had a problem with Carly, I mean... You wouldn't need the restaurant. You'd still get your payday. Take the knives. - Take anything you want. - You son of a bitch. You think I... - Where's Abby? - For God sakes, are you people crazy? - [Rings] - Booth. I loved Abby. I love Carly. It was... Thanks. Helicopter spotted Abby's car. [Police Radio Chatter] - Tell him to stay back. - You should wait here until we can determine... - if she's in the car and if she's alive. - You find her? - <i>No one's in the vehicle, sir.</i> - How about the trunk? - I haven't checked yet. - Get me a crowbar. Come on. She's alive. - Get an air evac here right away! - <i>[Man] I'll call it in!</i> Hang on, baby, please. You're gonna be all right. I don't understand. Why wasn't Abby killed too? - Funny, but I haven't found a written confession yet. - Yeah. But she's a witness. Blood traces on the dashboard where the vinyl split. Lots of blood on the seat, floor mats. Looks like Carly was definitely killed inside the car. Maybe whoever did this saw what he'd done and lost the stomach for it when it came to Abby. Hello. Possible semen and vaginal contributions. Because this wasn't nasty enough. Ooh! Smells like a urinal. She was locked up for 36 hours. I tell you, all she was worried about was surviving. Sorry. I forgot you were buried. Look, if this is too difficult, Hodgins... If I can help lock up this bastard that did this... at least someone gets justice, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. - <i>[Saroyan] What is it?</i> - Ah. Unidentified particulates... the two sweetest words that I know. I don't even want to think about your pillow talk with Angela. [Angela] The missing knife from the set... is an eight-inch, hollow-edge utility knife. But sharp or dull, it couldn't have made those injuries you found. - So the edge was even sharper. - Yeah. How much can you <i>magnify</i> the cut to that rib? I can go about 600 times before degrading the image. [Brennan] Most blades are irregular and pitted so they show on the bone. This is a knife without imperfections on its edge. Do you really think her husband killed her? I mean, it makes sense he would spare Abby. I don't think I'm the person... to ask about psychology of relationships. Mmm. You know, when I said before that... you were the difficult friend inside my head... it's not necessarily a bad thing. Yeah, I know... that sharing a strong emotional attachment with another human being... can be a good thing. But there seems to be a disconnect between my mind and... You know, I... I shouldn't have brought up Sully before. I'm sorry. It's just... if a relationship seems more than casual... I feel that I need to posit the potential problems... - probabilities of success and failure, or... - You get scared. But I miss so much, don't I? I want to say no, but... yeah. You do. And so does whoever you're keeping yourself from. I compared the hairline fracture on Carly's skull to the damaged dashboard. The fracture was the result of her head smashing into it. Hemorrhaging indicates it was antemortem. These white shards were found in the trunk and some were caught on her socks. F.B.I. techs also found similar shards in the old house. I'm running a chemical analysis, but I'd say this is some kind of ceramic. What? Like pottery? Actually, ceramics are used in everything from semiconductors to medical implants. - This is a very hard ceramic. It's probably eight Mohs. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What's that mean? That it was most likely used for industrial applications. - Do... Mmm. - <i>What?</i> No. I'm not gonna ask you again. - About the ceramic stuff? - No. Angela. No more. I'm done. Oh. You're done with Angela? No. But... Hey, I fell in love with a free spirit... and if getting married makes her feel trapped or something... then I'm... I'm just gonna have to deal with it. - Right. So you don't want to get married anymore. - Sure, I do. You know what? This whole ceramics stuff was making more sense to me. But Angela doesn't. And I don't want to drive her away like you did with Rebecca. Whoa. I did not drive Rebecca away. - We both agreed it wasn't right. - After you asked and she said no. Well, when you say it like that, it's... If it had been right, it wouldn't matter if you were married or not, would it? Because you'd have a life together. Great. Then why not get married? Because then we wouldn't be able to be together. - See, this is all coming so clear now. - Not really. - You put on that macho front, but inside you understand. - I don't understand. That which the mind can't grasp... I'm trying to catch a murderer, but you seem to have gone way past that. It means a lot, knowing you get it, man. Most guys... not secure enough to admit that. - Hmm. I have a headache. - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> Booth. Yeah. I'm on my way. Abby just... woke up. I need you to figure out what that stuff is. Okay. Um, it's so much easier just to fight and shoot guns. Bones, she's awake. We're going. Uh, we had a lot of cash. There had been robberies. Carly wanted to take the money to the A. T.M. Her and Dan fought about it. But Carly always did what she wanted. He ran outside yelling. I... I didn't want to get in the middle of it. You're... You're sure? She was stabbed? - Yes. - What happened when you got in the car? We didn't suspect anything. He must've been hiding in the backseat. Did you get a look at him? No. He was wearing a mask. I panicked. I, um... I tried to get out of the car. And... And he must've hit me, uh... 'cause the next thing I remember... is waking up in the dark. And, uh, I... I thought I'd been buried alive. Do you have any idea what that feels like? Actually, I was buried alive in a car just a few months ago with a colleague. - We were able to use the air bag cannis... - Bones. It's a rhetorical question. I tried to fight. - It's not your fault. - Was it... Did she suffer? It was very quick. The, uh... The four of us were planning on taking a vacation together... after the cookbook came out. We're sorry. I took a second look at Carly's cervical vertebrae. The damage matches an acceleration flexion-extension neck injury. - Whiplash. - Abby's car stops suddenly. Carly doesn't have her seat belt on. She's propelled forward... slamming her head into the dashboard... - <i>and injuring her neck.</i> - Exactly. What about what you found in the backseat? The vaginal secretions are consistent with Carly's D.N.A. - So she was raped before she was killed? - Any match on the semen? I ran the seminal D.N.A. through CODIS and the military database. - I found a match. - [Beeping] Ben Michaelson. Abby's boyfriend? It would explain why he spared Abby. Carly's husband said Ben was with the reserves when Carly was killed. I wonder how hard it is to sneak off base. He wasn't on base. He was alone in the woods doing survival training. He could go rape and kill Carly... and no one would even find out he left. You spoke to Captain Gerard? Why didn't you just talk to me? Your reserve unit spent last weekend reviewing survival skills. Yeah. We were each dropped off at isolated locations... and given rudimentary supply and navigation kits. So basically, you were alone for two days. No one to corroborate your whereabouts. What are you saying? You spent two tours in Iraq. The captain says you're one of his best men. Someone as well trained as you would've easily been able to leave your assigned location... and return to your rendezvous point with no one the wiser. - But I didn't. - See, first I was wondering... why would a carjacker kill one of his victims... and let the other victim stay alive? That doesn't make sense. Hey, unless... - maybe there's no carjacker. - Wait. Do you actually think that I... The insurance money would've given you over half a million dollars. You've killed before. I mean, in the service... - some guys, they're just numb to it. - Wait, this is insane. Then again, killing your meal ticket is one thing. And then killing your girlfriend, that's another. - So you locked Abby in the trunk. - No. - See, the one thing I don't understand... the rape. - Yeah. - What? - We have your D.N.A. from the backseat of the car. [Brennan] Yours and Carly's. So what was it then? Did you get turned on thinking about killing her? I want a lawyer. I'll bet you do. [Booth] You know we'll get him, Bones. All right? Don't worry. We do this all the time. You know, I should be used to it. - It shouldn't bother me. - No, it should. Was she, uh, really gonna teach you how to cook? Yeah. I've always understood the basics of cooking, the physics of it... but Carly said she was going to show me what it was really about. To her, she said that it was a way of... Well, she said "loving," but then, she was prone to hyperbole. Well, hey, I mean, that's what family dinners are all about, right? Those are some of my, uh... my best memories. I'm not as cold as everyone thinks, Booth. Okay, that was a leap. Just because I think marriage is an antiquated ritual... doesn't mean that I don't want Angela and Hodgins to be happy. I have an appreciation and a need... for emotional and physical intercourse, just like you. Yeah. Sure. I mean, okay. Good for you with that. - Did I make you uncomfortable? - No. Not at all. I just wanna focus. Let's just focus on the... on the case. I did make you uncomfortable. Listen, Abby, I know it's hard for you to go through this again... but do you remember hearing the carjacker's voice? - I... I must have. - Close your eyes for me, okay? I want you to try and hear that voice again. Can you do that for me? Does it sound familiar? Someone you might know? What are you saying? - We're just asking, Abby. - Why? Ben's story that night, it might not check out. What are you talking about? Ben would ne... We're like a family. It's not Ben. Abby, it's just a question we have to ask. Do you remember the car making a sudden stop? No. But I... I was unconscious in the trunk. - Could that be how she broke her wrist? - Possibly. Or when she was dragged or thrown into the trunk. Abby, may I have permission to review your medical records? They could help us identify Carly's killer. But do you think it might really be Ben? It's just a possibility we have to pursue. That's all. Okay. Thanks. I did it! I found the murder weapon! Or what's left of it anyway. I used the G.C. mass spectrometer to analyze the ceramic shards in the car. The murder weapon was a ceramic bowl? It's not just the bowl that's ceramic. The knife is too. Booth mentioned that companies are sending her their products to endorse. - Wait. A ceramic knife? - <i>Uh-huh.</i> - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> - Brennan. The murder weapon was a ceramic knife. Hodgins found the murder weapon. [Hodgins On Speakerphone] Zirconium oxide...supersharp and easy to shatter. In this case, you shatter it into a million pieces... no one knows it's a knife, except me, of course. Using Angela's program, I matched the wounds to the blade. Either that trunk was packed with invisible pillows... - or Abby's lying to us. - [Booth] Why? - Booth? - Yeah, Booth. Talk to me, squints... as close to English as possible. According to the medical report, Abby's got bumps and bruises, yes... but they aren't at all consistent with the way... she would've been thrown around in that trunk. She should've had more broken bones. Is there any evidence of Carly being raped? - None that I found. - Me either. But the wounds on the ribs... the directionality of impact was left to right. - Of course. - <i>[Angela] It fits the scenario I was working out.</i> - So obvious! - English, remember? Okay? - <i>[Booth] How does Ben figure into all this?</i> - He doesn't. The injuries fit if Abby was driving when the sudden stop occurred. - Abby? - Yes, Abby. - <i>[Booth] Why Abby?</i> - Look, I'm Abby. You're Carly. - Why am I always the murder victim? - Sit. - Zack's always the murder victim. - Mmm. I'm just driving along. I undo Carly's seat belt, slam on the brakes. She goes flying into the dash. Go. Go. Fly into the dash. The concussion disorients me. - Okay, don't overdo it, sport. - Okay, what are we missing here? The Stooges? Abby's scaphoid fracture was right to left... which means she could've received that break while stabbing Carly. Yes! [Grunting] - I was wearing a punk bracelet, lots of metal. - <i>[Hodgins] Uh-huh.</i> - That could easily fracture the scaphoid. - [Groans] Oh, okay. Look, we know that Ben had sex with Carly in the backseat of that car. But you didn't find any evidence of rape. So the sex they had was consensual. This part will be left up to the imagination. And since there's no way to pinpoint the time the sexual activity took place... Ben and Carly were having an affair. And they did it in Abby's car? No wonder she was pissed. Abby is in charge of, uh... of all the equipment Carly is sent for endorsement... so she knows about the knife. So Abby kills Carly. Yes! Abby kills Carly, pulls her out of the car. - Oh, boy. - Drags her into the old stone house. - I don't think this is necessary. - Destroys the murder weapon... leaving us little tiny shards to find. Drives the car into the ravine where she expects it'll be found quickly. And locks herself in the trunk. Wow. But there was no hikers in the area to find her... because she didn't count on the rain. Let's go back, Booth. [Siren Wailing] # [Soft Rock] [No Audible Dialogue] # [Continues] [Crying]
