- There's a photocopy. Last time I read from photocopies, the defence lawyer told the jury I was winging it. - Ready. Chop-chop! - I can't find my original notes. - Photocopy them. - Last time the defence lawyer told the jury... It was a ploy, it failed. Let's go. - I found glass and pollen. What do you want? - Pollen. - Perhaps you could swing by Archaeology... - No swinging. Her height makes no sense and her spine length is wacky. Calculate the height off the femur and assume the fire shrunk her spine. You shouldn't talk about other cases on court day. You'll get confused. - One question. Assyrian, Hittite or Egyptian... - What's up? Buttercup. If you sign off the tissue markers, Angela can finish the face. - Why did you say "buttercup"? - It's amusing rhyming linguistically. This is the latest Jane Doe from limbo. I have a rhyming linguini - see you later, alligator. Please don't refer to bone storage as limbo. There are thousands of remains waiting to be identified. Limbo seems appropriate. - No sign of foul play. - If you've time for this, you've time for me. Tissue depth of the cheek bones and jaw line looks a little deep, otherwise... Out of limbo, back on earth and on our way to court. - Temperance. - David. What are you doing here? - She has to get to court. - Booth, nice to see you, especially when I'm not in custody. I read your manuscript. I couldn't wait to tell you how great it is. - Thank you. Really? - You read her manuscript? Her second novel - <i>Bone Free</i>. - It's like <i>Born Free</i> except no lions. - Yuck on the title. Am I in it? - No. - Definitely. - We have to get to court. - Hope you have your original notes... - Told you, Booth! - No, Bones! We don't have time! Three minutes! I'll wait for you in the car. - So, are you two... - Yeah, sort of. Is that a problem? Yeah. Bones is very literal, so in future, no jokey advice on court day. Is something wrong? - What's this? - Zack's Jane Doe. He said that you OK'd the tissue markers. No, that can't be right. That can't possibly be right. You did it wrong. It's a mistake, Angela. All right, fine. Sweetie, I'll turn it off. The artefact bag from your Jane Doe, do you have it? Yes. I also have three bags of soil samples from where the remains were buried. Any of you see Bones? We're due in court, like, hello, now. What? This. Totally freaked her out. (Zack) My theory - caffeine intolerance. Yeah, you're gonna want to take Dr Brennan off the witness list today. No, she can't make it into court. Thanks. - What's going on? - That... is Christine Brennan. Good God. You just found Bones' mother. - I have to miss court. - I know. I remember this belt buckle. I borrowed it without asking. First day of high school. My father had it specially made for my mother because she loved dolphins. Bones... I'm sorry. I always knew that for my parents to disappear like that, they... they had to be dead. I thought that when it was confirmed, I'd feel relief. - But... - It's still bad news. - You have the file, Zack? - Jane Doe, number 129, 09/98. - Where was she found? - Bones. What does it say? "In September of 1998, a grave-digging crew at the Sunset Memories cemetery in Salisbury, Pennsylvania, uncovered human remains in a completely advanced stage of decomposition." - Is it from a grave? - No, it appears somebody dug a hole at the edge of the cemetery and plopped the body in there. - <i>(Booth)</i> Zack! - Sorry. "The local coroner found no obvious evidence of foul play and sent the remains, a few artefacts and soil samples to the Jeffersonian, hoping we could identify her." Your mother's been here as long as you have. - <i>(Booth)</i> Zack. - Sorry. But they both got here in 1998. Dr Brennan. Miss Montenegro has volunteered to drive you home. Temperance. Go home. (knock at door) - It's after midnight. - I was driving by, I saw the lights. Thought you might like some Wong Foo's. - You saw my lights from the road? - That is correct. All right. After you gave me your parents' file, I did some poking around. You worked on it? There wasrt much I could do. There was no evidence, no clearjurisdiction. Listen, Bones. Finding your mother's remains means I can open an official FBI case. I mean, for the first time, a real investigation can occur. Three days after my parents disappeared, they found our car at a rest stop 1,000 miles from where we lived in Chicago. I found it in an impound lot in Jersey. I'm having it trucked to the Jeffersonian. They kept it all those years? Well, nobody claimed it. Your father was a high-school teacher. He had no trouble with anyone at work. - Your mother, that's a... different matter. - She was a book-keeper. She was a witness for the prosecution, twice, on evasion charges. That gives motive. Then there's your brother. - Russ. The brother who deserted me. - He's on parole. He ran a chop shop, processing stolen cars for parts. Figures. He says that you blame him for your parents' disappearance. - You talked to Russ? - I called him. Just asked him a few routine questions. He didn't give me much. We're gonna find out what happened to your mom, OK? Adipocere and decomp residues in the soil indicate the body was buried for five years. That's congruent with pH in the soil, climate and degree of decomp. No, seven years. It should be seven years. I'm still going through the soil samples, but something may allow me to be more specific. She was buried near Christmas 1991. - I need the room. - The whole lab? For what? It's a cop way of saying "Get lost". - What? - When you gave me the file on your parents, I looked back into their lives three to four years before they disappeared. Jobs, friends. Then I looked back a little further and I found out that... Christine Brennan didn't exist before 1978. What are you telling me? That this woman isn't my mother? I was born in 1976. Obviously my mother existed. Do you know the most common way of creating an identity? Getting the birth certificate of someone deceased who was born the same year you were and... take over that identity. I found one Matthew Brennan, born and died 1948. You understand? I don't know what it means. I don't know what any of it means. It means that your parents werert... who you thought they were. It means that they were living under... assumed identities. (man) Every minute this is down, I'm losing money. You want faster work, grab yourself a cup of coffee. Let me alone, man. - Are you licensed for this job? - You're a cop. - You know who recognises cops? - Other cops. And crooks. I talked to you a couple of months ago on the phone. I'm Booth. Are you going to ask me some more questions about my childhood? - You found my mother? - Your sister did the ID. - What about Dad? - No. - What do you want? - You remember being anyone else besides... - Russ Brennan? - No. - You wouldn't lie to me, would you? - Cops always think I'm lying. - I want you to come to DC and help with this. - I got ajob, man. An alternative is I just cite you for performing unlicensed repairs on heavy equipment. Get your parole revoked. Tell you what... You give me a call when you get into town. Oh, if you ask me, this... this thing here is beyond hope. Look at that. It works. I'll see you soon. - What is it? - A clump of cellulose. Came from the soil samples at the burial site, - from the same depth as her bones. - You said you had a giant problem. - I used the laser scanning microscope. - Which one is that? Looks like an espresso machine. It showed this is mass-produced cardboard. Electron dispersion spectroscopy indicates the cardboard is coated with unsaturated monomers... Hodgins. What's the giant problem? It's a movie ticket. A little UV analysis, some guesswork, I get <i>The Fugitive.</i> So what? You don't like Brennars mom's taste in movies? The Fugitive was the third top grossing film of 1993. Brennars parents disappeared in December of 1991. Yet Mom's going to Harrison Ford movies two years later. Oh, God. This <i>is</i> giant. What do I do? Pretend I never found this? - <i>(Hodgins)</i> Dr Brennan. - Yes. Did you find something in the soil? Yeah, uh... This was in the soil samples alongside your mother's remains. - A movie ticket? - Rialto Theater, 9pm show of <i>The Fugitive</i>. - September 22nd, 1993. - How did it get there? Either your mother had it when she was buried, or it was buried with her. - Either way, it dates the burial. - No, that's impossible. My mother disappeared in 1991. It's possible Mom was buried somewhere else, then moved. - No, that's not possible. - Maybe it is. We decided to tell you the truth. And this is the truth. - You all right? - I'm pretty sure I found cause of death. - Zack. - Yes, Dr Brennan? See the discolouration on the inside of the skull? Left side. Extending from the coronal suture. Crossing the superior and inferior temporal lines to the squamosal suture. Subdural haematoma. Whoo. A big one. - Dr Brennan. - Probably fatal. There are no indications of a blow to the outer skull. Scan the outside of the skull, look for histological changes, microscopic modelling. - I don't want to talk to him. - Bones. Bones... All right, Zack, if this guy moves, shoot him with a tranquilliser dart. I don't actually have a tranquilliser gun. Hey, Bones. Come on. My mother died of a subdural haematoma. Bleeding in the brain. - You want to proceed rationally? - Chances are... the subdural haematoma was caused by a blow to the head. You got the how, now let's get the who. You just told me that your mother was murdered. I mean, who better to help us than your brother? Mom loved dolphins. This was mine. My favourite marble. What was she doing with that? - Where did Booth find you? - It's not hard for the FBI to find a parolee. - I didn't ask how, I asked where. - Morehead City, North Carolina. I call every year on your birthday. You never pick up. Take a hint. - Could I have this, please? - It's evidence. - Of what? It's a kid's marble. - It's the rules. I can't let you have it. Same old Tempe. Never met a rule won'th breaking. Same old Russ. On parole. I might send Russ in to describe some people to you. OK. What people? - People a seven-year-old might remember. - That's a little vague there, Booth. The drawing - that's important. I trust your instincts. - When it comes to men? - Ha-ha. When it comes to suspects. Why do you think that Bones asked her boyfriend... to read her book, and not me? Maybe because there was just too much of me in the story. - She was embarrassed. You think? Maybe... - <i>(phone rings)</i> Booth. Yeah. I'm on my way. Thanks. The family carjust arrived. - Are we looking for anything in particular? - Treat it like a brand-new crime scene. Tear through the whole car, treat it and go through it with a fine-tooth comb. That's our old car. The name of my school is scraped off. Woodside Elementary. They said they didn't find anything. There was a bloodstain, front seat, passenger side. Guys, everybody. I need space, now. - What, now? - Yeah, now. Take five, everybody. Twice in two days. I had NCIC database check for a married couple who disappeared in 1978. Meet Max and Ruth Keenan. - <i>(Russ)</i> That's Mom and Dad all right. - The NCIC database? That's... criminals. My parents were on the list of federal offenders? How do you like that? Guess a criminal nature runs in the family. You were seven years old, Russ. Old enough to remember. What is your real name? - What is my real name? - Bones, it's here in the file. No! No! I want him to tell me. What is my real name, Russ? My name was Kyle. Your name was Joy. You are not my brother. - Bones. - No! He lied about that. What else are you lying about? What else are you not telling us? At first, I thought the worst thing was that they were... missing. Except dead means no more hope. My mother was alive for almost two years after they disappeared. - She abandoned me. - You don't know that. You finally got to slap Russ. You've been wanting to do that for years. I worshipped him, you know? God, he was so cool. Everyone knew I was Russ Brennars little sister. I wasrt cool or pretty, so being his sister... You know that game Marco Polo? I'd be sitting in class and I'd hear out the window, "Marco". It'd be Russ, checking in on me and letting everyone know that I was his little sister. Did you "Polo"? Yeah, sometimes it would be the only word I said all day. Polo. Then Mom and Dad disappeared and... Russ took off. Suddenly, no one cared where I was. I miss that. Someone caring where I am all the time. Bones! Bones, are you up there? Come on, let's go. Chop-chop! I found the agent that was assigned to your parents' case. I was the FBI liaison in a bank robbery task force working out of Cincinnati in the '70s. Secret service, state police, ATF, all of us after a pretty bad bunch of armed robbers working Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa... You know, excuse me. Am I to understand that I'm addressing the family of one of these robbers? Max and Ruth Keenars children. Max and Ruth. Yeah. They never really belonged in that crew. - Why? - They worked smart. Specialised in safe deposit boxes, no guns. They'd either con their way in or case out the place, break back in on the weekend. Took their time. We never got a handle on the size of their scores. - Why? - People keep jewellery and cash in the boxes. And stuff they don't want to report stolen. None of us understood why stand-up criminals like Max and Ruth would join this Midwest strong-arm crew. Links to white supremacists, real dedication to firearms and violence. Ajob went bad. Two innocent bystanders were killed, one trooper, seven wounded. - When was that? - July 4th, 1978. - Never caught 'em? - Not us. No. A few years later, one of 'em turned State's evidence for an FBI agent out of Louisville. Sent the rest to jail. My understanding is they're all dead. Our parents were bank robbers? Who morphed into a high-school science teacher and a book-keeper? Their particular brand of safety deposit break-ins stopped. At the time, I figured the strong-arm crew killed them for their cut. - Agent Booth, we found blood in the car. - We expected that. Yeah, but here's the wrinkle. We got blood from two separate individuals. These two DNA charts are from the blood in the car. These are from Dr Brennan and Russ. These three match and this one does not. - These three people are related? - This is Mom, me and Russ. But this chart - a male, but it's definitely not your father. OK, so we'll run it through CODIS and the Convicted Offender Index, see what pops up. So you describe someone to me and I draw them. That's the drill. - Who do I describe? - I don't know yet. Booth put us together so I could charm you into telling me the truth. Trust me. I got no more truth. Your sister is my best friend. So when she says you can't be trusted, I trust her. This is you being charming? - Does Tempe really hate me that much? - Russ, she loves you. It would be easier if she hated you. Hate is a lot easier to deal with than love. Especially disappointed love. You know what's ironic? Tempe doesn't trust me because I kept a promise. What promise? Seven years old, Dad and me in the back yard. This was in Ohio. My dad tells me, "You're not Kyle any more." "Forget about Kyle. You're Russ." He says, "If you ever tell anyone, the police, anyone, you'll be killing your mother and your sister." "Swear," he says. "You swear on your baby sister's life you won't tell." He makes me say my new name 100 times. "Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan." He says it with me. "Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan." Around that time, when Kyle became Russ, maybe you saw someone, maybe you saw someone who scared you. Someone who scared you because you had instincts. The instincts of a frightened kid. Was there someone like that? Yeah. A man came to the house one day. My dad said if I ever saw this guy again, to grab my sister and hide. Well, when you're ready, you'll describe that man to me. All right. If you keep bringing Chinese food in the middle of the night, we'll both get fat. - I know what you've been thinking. - I doubt it. You've been thinking that your family is made up of liars and criminals. And that makes you feel Ionely. - There's a story here we don't know yet. - Like what? Bones, "don't know" means it's a mystery. What were your parents like? My parents... My dad, he, uh... he drove Thuds and Phantoms in Vietnam. Those are fighterjets. After that, he was a barber in Philadelphia. My mom, she wrote jingles for a local advertising agency. So they didn't go out at night after you were asleep and rob banks? Listen, Bones, you know... Parents have secret lives. If they didn't, they wouldn't be parents. It is a little late for Chinese, isn't it? Thanks for the meal. See you tomorrow. - Dr Brennan, is it morning? - No, I couldn't sleep. Why are you still here? We're all here. No one's leaving until we figure out what happened to your mother. Thank you. Don't thank me. I'm failing. I've gone over the skull and found no evidence of remodelling, which makes no sense because any wound that results in a subdural haematoma that big should leave a mark on the living bone. What if the subdural haematoma started out much smaller? - And grew over time? - Over the course of, say, a year. That might explain the gap between the time she got an injury and the time she was buried. Then the blow itself might not have left a mark on the bone. Show me the surface of the skull directly above the centre of the haematoma. 100 times magnification. Go to 500. - See here? - Microscopic fractures on the osteons. And is that the result of bleeding into the interstitial spaces? I can map the fractured osteons. That might lead us to the weapon. - I'm awake. - Yeah. I can see that. - Got a break on the DNA in the car. - You know who it is? Not exactly. It's a closed file. Whoever it is is in the Witness Protection. I'll make a request. - What if he had a face? - Who's that? Someone your dad pointed out to Russ when he was seven. Somebody he's still afraid of. I'm gonna play hardball with Witness Protection. If they don't cooperate, I'll put his face in the paper. - Wouldrt you get in trouble for that? - Well, we'll find out. You know what? Sometimes, he is just... whoo! What? This is the pattern of fractured osteons. - A blow from the front that grazed the skull. - A bullet? There'd have been particulates left by a bullet fired from short range. I isolated the most fractured osteons and this pattern emerges. - It looks like the business end of a tyre iron. - No, the size is wrong. It's too small. The weapon was actually chasing the skull when it landed. I believe she was pulled away, so most of the force was lost, leaving a slight impression. Bones. I got what I need from Witness Protection. Let's go for a drive. Everybody. Thank you. I... Thank you. OK, Bones, just listen to me. This guy McVicar, he might be a pig farmer now, but he used to be a mechanic with ties in the strong-arm crew your parents ran away from. - A mechanic like Russ? - Not like Russ. Russ fixes things. This guy, he used to kill people. - Can I help you, folks? - Yeah. Put your hands up. - Do it. - <i>(Bones)</i> Booth! Check him for a gun. What's going on? - He's got a.45. - .45? Check his ankle. - He's got a.38. - .38. I'm always right. - I'm FBI. I know who you are. - Steve Beers, pig farmer. Vince McVicar, the pig farmer, huh? You wanna talk to Vince McVicar, you do it through the federal marshals. Then I'd have to tell 'em about a pig farmer who carries two concealed weapons. Three. .22 in the small of his back. - .22. I'm always right. - No, you're not. I am. Bones, will you put the gun down? What do you want? I'm Ruth Keenars daughter. Joy? You're Joy Keenan? Yeah. I can see that. - We found your blood in the car. - You hurt people. You bashed in their heads. They never proved that, or I wouldn't be here. We know how it works, Vince. You rat out your crew, everybody loses interest in a few old murders. - My mother was hit on the head. - Yeah, I know. I was there. - 32 stitches. - She fought back, huh? Ruthie fought back, all right. - But not against me. - Then against whom? Your father. Why did he attack you? - Think about it a second, all right? - You and my... my mother? Me and Ruthie ran off together. Max caught us pulling into a motel outside of Champaign, Illinois. We were nuts about each other, Ruthie and me. - Crazy in love. - Let's just skip that part, OK? - He hit Ruthie first. - With what? Tyre iron. Hit my arm, caught me a roundhouse to the head. Lights out, baby. I came to, Ruthie and Max were gone. Never saw neither of 'em again. If you ask me, Max killed Ruthie, buried her somewhere and vanished. Our plan, once we set up, most likely in Florida, was to bring you down. Your father is a hard man, Joy. My name is Brennan. I'm Dr... I'm Dr Temperance Brennan. I work at the Jeffersonian Institution. I'm a forensic anthropologist. I specialise in identif... in identifying... in identifying people who nobody knows who they are. My father was a science teacher and my mother was a book-keeper. My brother... I have a brother. I'm Dr Temperance Brennan. I know who you are. Hey, I know. It's OK. Shh. It's gonna be all right. - No way Dad hits Mom. No way. - If he caught them together... - No way Mom cheats on Dad. No way. - McVicar lies the way you guys drink water. He killed people then he snitched to save his own ass. - You don't believe him? - No, I don't. Give me one piece of evidence that doesn't back up his story. - Sticker on your parents' car was scraped off. - What does that prove? The only reason to do that would be to keep you guys hidden and safe. - From McVicar? - He did hits for the crew that they ran out on. - What else? - There's a story that tracks for me, but without evidence, it's just a story. Tell us. Your parents go out Christmas shopping, they spot McVicar, the hit man. They lead him away from your home. Scrape off the name of the school so he can't trace it to me and Russ. - He takes out your dad. - And Mom gets away with a head wound? She leaves the car 1,000 miles away, but she can never go back to see you guys because the crew is still looking for her. - It's just a story. - Fits the evidence. The weapons that McVicar had on him, they're a violation of his agreement with Witness Protection. I'm gonna take him into custody, get a warrant, search his farm. - For what? - McVicar liked to bash in people's heads. Maybe we'll get lucky and match the weapon he used. - It's unlikely. - In that case, we'll still ruin his day. Tempe, that theory explains why Mom never came back for you before she died. - What's your excuse, Russ? - You're the one that left me. You... you needed someone to blame, you chose me. - I was 15 years old. - I was 19! My parents were gone, my sister hated me. Everyone's telling me she should be in care. - You didn't even ask me. - I tried, Temperance. You wouldn't talk to me! You wouldn't be talking if Mom's bones hadrt shown up. And I kept trying. Every year. Every year on your birthday. You're the one that gave up! You turned your back on me and you made yourself a new family. What's going on? The FBI delivered these tools and weapons from the pig farm guy. We went through them to see if any matched the mark on your mom's skull. We got 20 hammers, a dozen hatchets. Man loves his blunt instruments. Seven tyre irons. None of them match the wound, even allowing for shrinkage. It was 15 years ago. Even if McVicar killed my mother, what are the chances he hung on to the exact weapon? It's always like this with McVicar. Some mook is found with his forehead bashed in and the FBI goes in, collects about 40 hammers, and nothing matches. - Always the forehead? - That's his signature kill. Yeah. Not that anyone could ever prove it. You said guys like McVicar get comfortable with a way of killing. - Yeah. - Where did McVicar grow up? He grew up a farm kid in Iowa. Why? How do you slaughter a pig? - Why's he here? - He gets nervous. We're getting close. Found this in the barn. This is a spring-Ioaded captive bolt stunner. The animal's restrained, it's pressed to the forehead. Who could use this on a human being? Who could use this on a pig? It's the perfect dodge. Blood, flesh can all be explained. - I think I just became a vegetarian. - What do you think? Yeah. Same shape as a tyre iron, but smaller. This could be a match. Before you decide anything, we should talk. I'd call that nervous. Wouldrt you? There's no way to prove that's the weapon that killed your mother or anyone else. You'd be surprised at what she can prove. - I need to speak to you alone. - Forget it. - Booth, it's all right. It's all right. - No. No. You got two ways to look at this. One is you score a private chat. Second is you attack her and I'll drill you through the forehead. - How could I possibly attack her? - I'll decide what is and isn't an attack, like, say, a hiccup. Booth. Come on. - You killed my mother. - It would be hard to convince ajury. I'm pretty persuasive. I'll put you away. Here's the thing, Joy. Two people know what really happened that night. Me and your father. - You killed him before you attacked my mom. - Then how did I get this scar on my head? You got a choice, Joy. Drop the bolt stunner down the well and you'll know what happened. You put me in front of ajury, not only will you fail to convict, but... you'll never know the truth. You can't live with that, Joy. You can't live not knowing. I found out what happened to my mother. I'll find out what happened to my father too. - We're done. - You'll never know what happened your dad! - Why are you letting me drive? - It's a reward for totally pissing off a hit man. - Oh, can I read your book? - After it's come out. - Not before? - No. What? I let you drive. - Just let it go. - Where are we going? I'd like to make up for a little lost time. I'm gonna go get a funnel cake, OK? I have something for you. Thanks, Tempe. Russ. You were right. You were only 19, but at the time... I didn't understand what that meant. Sometimes people need to explain things to me, I guess. Then... you have to let them talk to you. If you could maybe come back and stay a couple of days longer? Please? At my place, I mean. Marco. Polo. - Anybody thirsty? - Is it too early for a beer? I gotta go. I'm picking up Parker for the weekend. I'll take one. - You have a boy? - Yeah. The woman I'm seeing, she's got two daughters. Nice. Girls are nice. - To us. - Whoever the hell we are. To what we're becoming. New message recorded today. 3pm. (man) Temperance, you have to stop looking. You have to stop looking for me right now. This is bigger and worse than you know. Please. Stop now. Who's that? That was my father.
