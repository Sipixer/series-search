I mean Baltimore. Yeah, I've given several lectures to the Baltimore Homicide Division. What's wrong with your mouth ? - I got a tooth situation. - Well, go to a dentist. All right, I will if it doesn't get any better. - Ow ! Man ! - Are you afraid of the dentist ? - I'm not afraid. - Welcome to Balmer. This is, uh, actually a federal flood abatement project, which is why we called you. K-9 unit was using it for an exercise, and one of the cadaver dogs went berserk. When they dug up the cement... No, that's concrete. Cement is an ingredient in concrete. Yeah, that's a real important distinction to make at this juncture. So, what do we got, Bones, huh ? Do your thing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing ? No, I can't see enough of the skull, the tibia, the pubis. Nothing. Nothing. Wait a second. Nothing. Oh, sorry about that. We drove all the way here so you could just tell me nothing ? All right, so what do you, what do you want to, uh, get the whole slab of cement... Concrete. ...concrete, whatever... shipped back to the Jeffersonian ? Abso... Sex ? The mandible suggests male, and the tibia suggests he was between five six and six feet tall. Waffle-soled training shoes and a track suit. - You know who wears track suits ? - Athletes ? No. Huge tubs of lard or retired people. And rap stars. The teeth suggest early middle age. So not a retiree. Uh, calcified holes with radial fractures in the left clavicle and scapula are consistent with ballistic damage. - He was shot to death ? - And stabbed. But neither killed him. The wounds healed. Shot, stabbed, but lived to die another day ? Rap star. There is a small hole in the back of the cranium. Get the skull out first, establish cause of death, then give Angela something to work with to ID the guy. Where is Angela ? I'm really not good at this kind of thing. You know, I don't... I don't get the significance. One year ago today, you buried your mother. You laid her to rest. Here. You're marking the anniversary. Angela, I simply don't believe my mother retained sentience beyond death. Well, part of you is made up of your mother, right ? In a manner of speaking. So, honor that part of yourself. Visualize a memory of her. See what it brings up. I have very few distinct memories of my mother. I'll wait in the car. Hiya, honey. I was hoping you might show up. I don't... I don't want to talk to you. We're standing here in front of your mother's grave. Obviously, you've come for some kind of answer. Maybe I can... provide 'em. You're a killer. You burn people. Yeah, I'd like to report a sighting of Max Keenan at Eternal Spring Memorial Gardens. He's a wanted fugitive. I love you. Yes, I'm sure. Because he's my father. "Bones" Season 02 Episode 18 ... your dad at all before you called the cops ? No. Why would I ? Well, I mean, I haven't seen my dad in a long time, and if I had the opportunity to talk... Ow ! Â­ Go to a dentist. Oh, I will if it doesn't get any better. Based on decomposition of the track suit, Hodgins is estimating a postmortem interval of two years. Based on bone deterioration, I like three years. Well, what killed him ? The victim was dead shortly after this hole was punched into his skull. Too small for a projectile. No radiating stress lines. A slow entry, a piercing wound. Like a-a screwdriver ? Nail gun ? Ice pick ? Yeah, something along those lines. Oh. Cold steel to the brain... would that kill him ? Depending how far it penetrated. Yeah, it's Booth. I need, um, all murders in which a penetrating wound to the back of the head figured. Great. Thanks. Don't freak out. Oh ! You broke into my house ? That is not acceptable. This, uh, little device here... it jams cell phone frequencies. That is illegal. Unfortunately, illegal is what I do best. I'm not staying. I just want you to do something for me. I want you to take a look at my rap sheet. - Why ? - Why ? Because I want a chance to talk to you... actually talk to you... without you calling in the 82nd Airborne. How is reading your police record going to change my mind ? Just do it. I think our victim was killed by Ice Pick. Angela did a facial reconstruction of Cement Head. Concrete Head, you mean. No, Cement Head... it's got a nicer ring. So, I ran it through IntelPlus and got a match. William Raymond "Billy Ray" McKenna. West Virginia. "Assault, manslaughter, kidnapping, torture...." This here... This here is, uh, Hugh Kennedy. Uh, I think he killed Cement Head. Why ? Well, West Virginia, likes to use an ice pick on his victims, plus Ice Pick and Cement Head were both employed by a regional crime boss in West Virginia named... Gallagher. Well, what are we going to call him ? Gallagher. But he runs most of the, uh, prostitutes, strippers, gambling, bootlegging, meth, extortion in West Virginia. Five years ago, the West Virginia State Police began pressuring Gallagher's criminal operation, making a lot of arrests. Including Ice Pick and Cement Head. Cement Head goes to jail. - Ice Pick ? - Out on bail, babe. You say that like it means something. Oh, I talked to the officer in charge, and he said that Ice Pick wouldn't say anything, so they punished him by letting him out on bail. How is bail punishment ? 'Cause it makes Gallagher think that Ice Pick cooperated with the cops. You know, it's criminal psychology, Bones. You know, you wouldn't get it. Just read. Just continue reading there, will you ? "Half a million dollar bond. "Kennedy jumped bail. "Killed in a car accident while fleeing a Bail Fugitive Recovery agent." Bounty Hunter. "Car burned the remains to ashes." All they got was a severed leg. They didn't actually get Ice Pick's body. So, are we going to talk to the bounty hunter ? No, I am. You're gonna make sure that that severed leg actually belonged to Ice Pick. Well, someone kept the leg ? The severed leg was frozen as evidence. So, you think Ice Pick might still be alive ? As a friend of mine likes to say, "Don't jump to conclusions until all the evidence is in." If the facts are in, then it's not jumping to conclusions, so I never said that. I never said that the friend is you, okay ? Does it have to be completely thawed for you to examine ? No. My interest lies only in the femur. I need to get some tissue for DNA testing. I'm the bounty hunter you want to talk to. Veleska Miller. You want to know about Kennedy's leg ? Anything you want to tell me outside the official report, that's great. Sure. How it smelled, his body cooking over the fire. Otherwise, I stand by the record. How'd you find him ? Tip from someone I know who provides documents to fugitives. Tailed him, he made me, took off. Boom ! Found his leg about 30 yards from the vehicle. And you saw him burn ? Yeah. Why ? That's it ? That's it. I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping you'd keep me here a while, ask me some dumb-ass federal questions, check me out. How's about I buy you a nice breakfast, huh ? Guy like you must be going crazy in the FBI. What kind of guy is that, exactly ? I'm a bounty hunter, sport. I read people fast, or I die. You are not standard government issue. Take a walk on the wild side. I have more fun, fewer rules, and a lot of money. Yeah. You make a compelling case. Booth. Coroner's report said Kennedy's leg was severed in the car accident. We don't call him Kennedy. We call him Ice Pick. Hold on for one second. Sorry. Yeah. Aah. Listen, I got the, uh, bounty hunter here. She was an eyewitness to the crash. Saw him incinerated. Tell Booth that Ice Pick's femur is sliced cleanly at 90 degrees. I can hear you, Bones. Okay ? It's a speakerphone. Look, amputation like that could happen in a bad wreck, right, Cam ? Yes. Well, there are kerf marks. She's seeing evidence of a saw, Booth. Look, I know what kerf marks are. Booth should arrest the bounty hunter. I can hear you, Bones. What am I gonna arrest her for, huh ? For lying, for perjury. For aiding in a cover-up. If she's there with you, just detain her. Okay. Hey, look at that, huh ? DNA is a match. West Virginia state troopers got a DNA sample at Ice Pick's arrest. This is definitely his leg. Was she pretty ? Ice Pick is a male. I mean the bounty hunter who gave Booth the slip. You know, she didn't get away because she was pretty. She was a she ? No, she was a... Oh... What's wrong with your mouth ? I'm guessing the anterior molar on the left side is infected. The leg was surgically amputated. Go to a dentist. He's afraid of the dentist. These kerf marks are consistent with a type of wire saw used to remove horns from heifers. Ah, so... Ice Pick and this bounty hunter set up a car accident with a dummy victim so everyone stops looking for him. Two years later he kills Con... Cement Head. She hoodwinked you 'cause she was hot. All right, look, you know what ? She wasn't hot. In fact, she looked like a man. The amputation was probably performed by a livestock veterinarian. Hey, Bones, I've got that other thing you want to discuss. Oh, let's... go to my office so we don't disturb Cam. Booth ? Yeah ? Livestock amputation. That is one tough, determined old criminal. Be careful. You know, I was going through your father's crim... Shh ! ... criminal record and he was right about one thing. You know, he never ended anyone's life who didn't have it coming to them. He's a sociopath. Well, maybe, but at least he aimed in the right direction. - Ow ! - Let me take a look at your tooth. All right, just... Go easy. You promise ? Okay. All right. Open up. You know, What ? In the Old West, he would have been considered a hero. Yeah, well, the Old was a time of chaos and violence that, anthropologically speaking, our country is still Ow ! trying to recover from. Yeah, I was right. Anterior molar on the left side, it's infected. You know, your father never killed any hardworking, tax-paying citizens or honest cops. Ow ! You still think that society should forgive him ? All I'm saying is if I have an opportunity to arrest him, I will. But you know who maybe should forgive him ? His daughter. Oh, look at that. The small town crime boss is here. Let's go have a little chat with him, shall we ? Billy Ray McKenna shortly before he became Cement Head. I like nicknames. They are universal mnemonic devices. Why are we doing this ? Don't we know that cause of death was brain scrambling due to an ice pick ? The technical term is "pithing." And it's not how he died. It entered the medullary pyramids, and beveling on the entry site suggests it was... I don't believe there's an English word that adequately describes... Wiggling. Up and down is wiggling. Okay... wiggled, thus paralyzing the victim and causing some difficulty breathing. But he would live for upwards of several hours. Smart. Very little blood spilled. How did the victim die ? This is the bad part. It appears that the concrete was poured over him while he was still alive. Oh... These chunks of concrete are in the shape of... a sinus cavity, bronchial tubes, plus a kind of a hollow around the middle finger. You said he was paralyzed. Well, if the ice pick was inserted and then waggled... ... it would affect the median nerve and the T1 nerve roots. Which control the flexor carpi radialis. Anterior palm, thumb, index and middle fingers. But if it was... Wiggled. ... the victim would lose the ability to move the ring and pinky fingers. We think he wiggled instead of waggled. Because he could still move his middle finger. It's a terrible way to die. Our conclusion is that he was trying to swim to the surface using only his middle finger. The last time I saw Billy Ray McKenna he was "So long, suckering" me from his F-150 and heading off on a well-earned vacation. Well-earned by torturing a journalist who was talking too much. Well, I resent your inference. Get him my, uh... whatcha call it ? Tax papers, employment records. Did I get that right ? Not quite. You resent his implication. He's implying that you're a criminal. You're taking inference with hisimplication. Have at it. According to this, Mr. Lightner is your flight instructor. That is correct. I have wide-ranging enterprises. Clark here is helpful in getting me where I got to get. And William Raymond McKenna is down as a media liaison. Yep, by breaking journalists' fingers. You know, you never asked me about, uh, Billy Ray McKenna there, big dog. Well, I assume, big dog, that, uh, Billy Ray is deceased. Why ? He was a valued employee. Disappears for three years, I got to assume the worst. His body was found encased in concrete. Tell you what, we're gonna claim his remains. We'll bury him proper. Where'd you send him on vacation ? - Canada. - Canada ? Was it the Mounties that found Billy Ray encased in cement ? - Concrete. - Hmm ? Not cement. It's a common error. Baltimore Police. - Is Baltimore on the way to Canada ? - Well, the most efficient route is up through Detroit, but Billy Ray, hell, he loved Vermont so. Do you have any idea who might want to kill Mr. McKenna ? Oh, hell, yeah. He, uh... - Well, how would you put it ? - Aggressive. - Yeah. - Both socially and sexually. How about Hugh Kennedy ? Hugh Kennedy. Yeah, handy with the ice pick. According to this, you hired him as a "Liquor License Consultant on a per case basis." Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember. Taciturn type. Very dour. Right. In jail for murder once, manslaughter twice, and suspect in four unsolved murders, all involving ice picks. You know, good old Hugh did not put none of that on his rÃ Ãum ? If I recall, Mr. Kennedy was killed in a car accident fleeing a bail enforcement officer. Got burned up. Well... you guys look us up if you're ever in western West Virginia. We're at Snackie's Roadhouse and Grill. Where the 119 hits the 64. I'll make a note of that. 119 hits the... 64. 64. Hey, T, look. Snickerdoodles. What do... Oh, come on, you used to love them. When you were a little girl. I got a message for you from your brother. What message ? Uh, he says, um... He says "hi." Have you turned Russ into a criminal, too ? Hey, I haven't committed a crime in over 15 years. I'm straight. Except for killing, gutting, and burning the deputy director of the FBI. He was trying to kill Russ, and then he was going after you. It is not a crime to protect your family. Some fathers do it without killing. Did, uh... you and Booth take a look at my, uh, rap sheet ? Yes. And ? He'll arrest you if he has the chance. What else ? So the snickerdoodles. Come on. You don't remember ? You loved them as a little girl. I don't remember. I'd come home, and then you'd be jumping around. You were five or six years old and you'd say, "Come on, why don't you put on the trying song ? Put on the trying song !" The trying song ? It was my favorite song. I used to sing it. It was, uh... by Poco. The band. Hugh Kennedy ? Bad guy, but he's dead. About five years ago in a car crash in West Virginia. Recent evidence suggests otherwise. How do you know him ? Well, him and his ice pick were pretty famous in some circles. I've got to go. - Now ? - Yeah. You speed-dialed Booth. He's been listening to everything and the... the SWAT team's on its way. I mean, I'm just guessing. But there is something I do want to say to you. Mom ? It's not about Mom, it's about you and it's about stuff that she wanted you to know. She never got the chance to tell you. Hey, Booth, there's a couple of things that you should know about this guy, Kennedy. He's got an addiction to model airplanes. Try some of these again. You'll love them. Wait, Dad... What's... What's the second thing ? Mmm, he's wily. You be careful, okay ? Did you get that ? I've got to tell you, you were right, Zack. Every model airplane freak from Baltimore is here. We prefer the term "pilots." Yeah, okay. So you're into this stuff, too, huh ? Yeah, forensic anthropology is only one of my doctorates. The other is in applied engineering. I'm extremely adept at practical aeronautics. Do you see Ice Pick ? A lot of these guys are kind of old. You know, they're wearing those, uh... those sunglasses that wrap around their heads. Well, how many of them only have one leg ? Well, half of them are sitting down. Okay, how am I going to get them to stand up ? Crashes bring everyone to their feet. W... uh, shoot down one of the planes. That's great, and the next thing you know, I'm being evaluated by my shrink again. That's not going to happen. Drive onto the field. What ? Put your car where they like to land. Everyone will stand up and yell at you. This better work. Okay, just stay with me here. Oops. Look at that, huh ? It seems to be working. Ha, ha. Oh, they're mad. Do you see him ? They're all wearing long pants. I mean, how can I tell if any of them are wearing a prosthetic ? The prosthetic will cause a slightly unnatural alignment of the spine, which will result in a compensating adjustment of... Booth, the instinct will be for these men to step toward you. One man will be standing perfectly still. Okay. Yep, I got him. Sorry. I apologize. Just passing through. Afternoon. Anybody asking after me ? Nope. What the hell ? I'm gonna need his room number. Maybe I can help you. What did you hit me with ? Huh ? Only reason I ask is my tooth doesn't hurt anymore. You know, you're the first guy that got the drop on me in ten years. I used to get that a lot. Can I ask you a question ? As long as you answer one for me, then. Huh ? What's your story ? Billy Ray got in the back of my cab. Don't know which one of us was bigger surprised, but it must have been Billy Ray 'cause he's the one ended up dead. Hey, what's your question ? How you people find him under all that cement ? A dog. - Dog, huh ? - Yeah. So why am I not dead ? I never killed nobody for fun. It was my job. And I'm retired. Now, listen. I know you fellas get in trouble if you lose your gun. I'm taking the bullets, though, if you don't mind. Oh. - Well, what about me ? - Settle down. What ? Settle down, relax. Someone'll find you. You have a good day now. I just want to talk about your mother. Booth is missing. It's been over 18 hours. He tried to take down Hugh Kennedy by himself ? He's only got one leg and he's old. Yeah, you know how he got old ? By being fast and paranoid. He cut off his own leg. Booth is tough. What does the FBI say ? Nothing. Yeah, "need to know," right ? Mm-hmm. I want to do something, but I don't... I don't know what. Are you asking ? You'd help find the man who's going to put you in jail ? Well, Booth will... will do the best he can, I'll do the best I can, and we'll see how it works out when we get there. W-Where did he find Kennedy ? Baltimore. I'm afraid that's not Hugh Kennedy. What's that called when they wrap a sausage in a pancake ? Pigs in a blanket. Pigs in a blanket. Now how'd you get here ? How'd you get here ? Billy Ray was killed by an ice pick in Baltimore. We asked around. Was it Hugh Kennedy that bundled you up in a carpet ? Look, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation with civilians, all right ? So just cut me out of here. Hey, what are you doing with my gun ? Put that down. Okay, time to step out of your comfort zone, people. What comfort zone ? We've stopped working. I'd like to start again. We process evidence. There's no more evidence for us to process. He's right. We process, Booth interprets. I'd like to give it a try. Yeah, we suck at interpretation. We absolutely blow. Um, what do you want us to do ? Work what we know. McKenna was probably killed by Kennedy. Booth ran afoul of Kennedy. I'm with you. I'm with you, not ahead of you. Okay, is there any forensic evidence on our victim that might lead to Kennedy and Booth ? Yeah, I mean, I've finished the inventory on McKenna's tracksuit. There were flakes of tobacco, fibers from the upholstery of a Crown Victoria, popcorn, chocolate, a host of other wool and cotton threads. Okay, what does that tell us ? That the man was a pig ? All right, look, there were also cellulose fibers consistent with newsprint, gum from a number of different mouths. Uh, he had dried chunks of human mucous, a half dozen filaments of nylon consistent with women's hosiery. Oh ! Uh, Kennedy was a transvestite. Keep going. The rest was just waxy buildup from soap or upholstery cleaner. Let's assume all this adds up to a place. Crime scene. Close your eyes and imagine the smell of all those things. Tobacco, snot, gum, popcorn, a lot of clothing, chocolate... A porno movie theater ! You can't smoke at the movies. I don't know about porno. Upholstery cleaner, Crown Victoria... I got it. A taxi cab. McKenna was killed in a taxi cab. Yes. Where are you going ? To tell the FBI they're looking for a one-legged cabbie in Baltimore. You know, you guys, it's not like we all know each other off the field, so... But you know a man with a prosthetic leg ? Uh... yeah, I've seen him around. We need his name. No, honey, he'd be using a fake name. No, we need to know where he lives. Well, maybe he's listed under his fake name. He's too careful for that. He drives a cab. How do you know that ? My associates are very good, Dad. Can I ask a question ? Do you guys have any, like, official I.D. or anything ? - I can have the FBI here in 20 minutes. - No, no, no. - Screw the FBI. - No, no, no ! Hold on ! Easy ! Take it easy, pal. - Where does he live ? - I don't know ! - Dad ! - No ! All right, all right ! Halton Inn on Decatur. - No, no, no ! - Dad, he told us ! Are you lying to me ? Because if you are, I'll know it ! Halton Inn on Decatur, just past the tracks. Easy. Wha... ? ! What's that all about ? Thank you. You're welcome. Your dad's a psycho, by the way. You have no idea. Do you have a one-legged old man staying here ? Give me 40 bucks. Room number, please. Dad ! I... I have money. Dad, look out ! Who is she ? I don't think she's going to tell us. Come on, help me ! Pull ! Pull ! Hey. Hey, listen to me. I like you. But if you make another move on me, I will hurt you. You understand ? If her name's Veleska, she's the same bounty hunter who brought in Kennedy's leg. How'd you find him ? It's not that hard to find a one-legged, old, white hit man in Baltimore. Why is she after him ? She has to make sure that Kennedy stays gone. I helped a wanted fugitive evade arrest. I'm not going to jail. What have you got ? It's a left anterior molar. It's Booth's tooth. Where's Booth ? Temperance, honey ! Kennedy has Booth, Dad. He's got Booth ! Okay. Perhaps he didn't see Kennedy. Yeah ? How'd you come to that thought ? Well, Kennedy would have left him with an ice pick protruding from his head. Just one simple question, big dog. Did you see Kennedy ? Well, we could get our own ice pick. Make it look like Kennedy killed him. You know we can't let you live, right ? You've been struck and restrained. Technically, kidnapping a federal agent is as bad as murdering him these days. How would you like to kill him ? First, I got to know for sure if Kennedy is dead or alive. Good luck with that one, big dog. Oh, big dog. I suppose we could do that thing that McKenna used to do, but I'd need a blowtorch and a sharpened screwdriver. Just tell us. Woof. Cute. Oh ! - Must be his kid. - Yeah. Head like a anvil. I hurt my hand. All right. I'm gonna let you take a look at your sweet boy, consign his face into your memory, and then I'm gonna ask you which one of your eyes you like best. Definitely Booth's tooth. I knew it. Brennan... You're not alone in this. I know I'm not alone. We all want to find Booth. I know. This is one of those times when I have no idea what's happening. Brennan, wait. - I have to go, Ange. - What's going on ? I've got to find Booth. I'm coming with you. No. I can't fight or shoot a gun, but if something bad happens, I can spit with deadly accuracy. Thanks, but no. Why can't you tell me ? By definition, I can't tell you. All right, all right, Hodgins is outside in his fastest car. It's Italian. One call and he follows you everywhere. Angela... All right, you're after a crazy, old, ice pick hit man who has Booth. You need help. Look at my face. Do you really see me backing down ? I... I already have help, Ange. From who ? From someone worse than Kennedy. Are you serious ? Don't say it. - You're father is helping you ? - I have to go. Dad ! Was it Booth's tooth ? Yes. Stop that. What are you doing ? Well, we have to know for sure if Kennedy is alive or dead. I mean, what if she and her friends took Booth ? If this bothers you, maybe you should go. No, alpha male, man of action... I... I get it. Now, tell us. Okay... okay... Kennedy is alive. I was chasing him for the bail. He was smarter than me, and he gave me a choice: help him fake his death or die myself. Where'd you get the body ? We stole some dead old geezer from a mortuary in Charleston. Where is my partner ? When I got here, no one was here. I swear. What do we do with her ? The room is paid for through the end of the week. Kennedy does not have Booth. How do you know ? He's only got one leg. So ? Well, so he's retired. He's like me. He just... he just wants to disappear. Then who's got Booth ? Well, there's only one other significant player in all this. What am I going to do with you when I get to the lab ? I'll just take a nap here in the car. Awfully exciting day for an old guy like me. Booth is being held by Melvin Gallagher. That's a leap. How do you know ? Can we just go with this, please ? Of course not. Obviously, Brennan found out from her father... - who is a wanted fugitive. - Ange ! Now that I can go with. We need to figure out where Gallagher is holding Booth. Has anybody noticed that every time there's a panic situation, all eyes turn to Hodgins ? It's okay. What's he supposed to do ? Shoes. Shoes ? Gallagher said the last time he saw McKenna he was leaving for vacation after a tough night at work. You think Gallagher might have a place he takes people for that sort of thing ? Let me go over Cement Head's shoes... see what they tell us. Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone. It's a solvent. See if it has any specialized uses. Also chromic MEK and chromic acid are both used to prepare metals. Prepare metals for what ? Coating... painting mostly. Electroplating. I'm seeing micro-thin deposits of aluminum here. Shavings ? No, it's more anodized... vapor deposition. Gallagher flies everywhere ? An aluminum propeller requires a coating that could withstand between ten and 20 tons of centrifugal force. Preferably anodized. These are Gallagher's tax returns. We're looking for the purchase of any machine that could be used for anodization. What, like a copier, or... ? Oh, that's so cute, but no. Look for the words "lamination, electroplating." "Alloy membranes, catalytic bed reactor..." "A serial thermal processor." "Vacuum pyrolysis." "D-330 Vacuum plating processor" ? Yeah, that's it. That's it. Yes, this is Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian. I just received a call from Agent Booth that he's being held at... the Purdue Airfield in Oakville, Virginia. Send backup, I'm going in. You just lied your ass off to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That is so hot. If you lie really still, you may not die. I need your car. Max Keenan, you're under arrest. Not if I get the keys. They're in the ignition. Well, it's not like I actually gave him the keys. Why didn't you just... just tell them about Kennedy ? Well, I needed to give you time to find me. I've been tortured worse. So, uh, you hear anything from your old man ? He left my car in the garage. He'll be back. How do you know ? Max Keenan does not strike me as the kind of guy who, uh, leaves things undone. Next time he shows up, what do I do ? Do I call you ? Do I knock him on the head ? What's my obligation ? Well, if I were you, Bones, I'd want to know what he has to tell you about your mother. But, uh... that's just me. There's, uh, this old song. It's called "Keep on Trying." Yeah, Poco. You know it ? Yeah, what about it ? It's a good old song, right ?
