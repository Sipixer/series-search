walked on the beach, chilled... Oh, you chilled in Darfur? - You chilled in Darfur? - In North Carolina. I changed my vacation plans to spend time with my brother. Russ and I talked about it, and we really want to find Dad. Just so you know, the F.B.I.'s gonna find your father no matter what you want. My brother and I don't want the F.B.I. to back-burner the search. [Tires Screeching] Is it okay to go on two wheels like that? Only when making very sharp turns at high speeds. Okay, Bones, why don't you have a little, uh, you know, faith in me, okay? I'm not gonna back-burner the case, all right? I'm gonna find your father. - My brother said you'd say that. - You really keep saying "my brother" a lot. Well, I lost Russ for 15 years. I like the sound of it. - My brother. - <i>[Siren Continues]</i> What's with the siren? Why are you driving like a maniac? [Siren Stops] [Men Shouting, Chattering] A little bit. [Booth] Two passenger cars off the tracks, one on the side. Gonna be fatalities. Stan, I need some gauze. Danny, if you don't find... the owner of this in the next 10 minutes, he'll bleed to death starting... - [Beeps] - now. - Seeley. - Camille. - Don't call me Camille. - Don't call me Seeley. Dr. Brennan, Dr. Saroyan. You two know each other, right? - No. - No. - Uh-oh. - <i>Dr. Brennan...</i> I'd like you to check out the automobile this train hit. - It's probably what caused the derailment. - [Booth] Accidental? N.T.S.B. guy says the train struck the car at least 200 yards from the nearest access. - Deliberate? - Eight minutes, Steve! Probably suicide. Why are you still here, Dr. Brennan? Because I'm not a coroner, and I don't work for you. Well, you got that half right. Found him, Cam! Still breathing! Thanks, Steve! All right. Every survivor's one less person for me to autopsy. [Exhales] You look good out of your suit, Seeley. But then you always did. Yeah, that's... It's great to have you back in D.C., Camille. One minute she was holding a severed arm. The next, she's hitting on you. No, she wasn't hitting on me. And you know what? She <i>is</i> your boss, Bones. No. Goodman's my boss. May I approach? - All yours, Dr. Brandon. - Brennan. Dr. Brennan. - You want to guess my name? - No. There are thousands of you in D.C. and only one of me. You know what? While you were away, Goodman decided... there should be a head of Forensics at theJeffersonian. - It never occurred to you to check in, huh? - Why didn't Goodman hire me? - <i>[Booth] My guess? People skills.</i> - <i>I have people skills.</i> All right. That firefighter's name is Nelson. This is at least the fourth time you've met him. Odds are Cam knows his kids' names after meeting him once. A lot of jewelry, male. Thigh bone suggests he was tall. I.D. bracelet. It's good-quality gold. Slightly melted. Too melted for a regular car fire. Do you see a skull? Hey, Bones. I'm not looking for a skull. Burn damage on the body is more intense than I'd expect from a car fire... even if the fuel tank ruptured and was absolutely full at the time of impact. Do you see anything on this car that isn't ruptured? - Booth, three deaths in the first-class car. - Oh, homicide. That makes it <i>my</i> case. - One of them's a senator. - That makes a difference? Facts of life, Bones. [Police Radio Chatter] Apparently, Cam is autopsying a senator. [Hodgins] A senator? We're movin' up in the world. - They have a past. - Cam and the senator? Cam and Booth. Look how she touches his arm when he laughs. You touch my arm when <i>I laugh. No. No, you touch me. It's a big difference. Okay, what do we got? Male, 40s. Approximately 6 foot 7. Right-handed. Six foot 7? Athlete in his youth. Right shoulder is worn from a repetitive motion. - Baseball pitcher maybe. - More like, um... [Booth, Zack] Basketball. Six foot 7. It makes sense. Every bone in his body is broken. Dude, he got hit by a train. "W-A-R." It's all I can make out of one name. And then "Love, Brianna." - Dude! - You're saying "dude" way too much. Forties, 6 foot 7, W-A-R, Brianna. This is Warren Lynch. - [Brennan, Zack] Who's Warren Lynch? - No way. Warren Lynch? Lynchpin International, Warren Lynch? - Yeah. - I am not telling the press... that Warren Lynch killed Senator Paula Davis... - before we're completely certain. - <i>[Brennan] I know Senator Davis.</i> I signed a book for her to give to her daughter. Man, I love Paula Davis. She could've been president. Warren Lynch and Senator Davis killed in one accident? No way it's a coincidence. Hey, Hodgepodge, all engines reverse. First we <i>identify</i> beyond the shadow of a doubt, then we get paranoid. I'm cool. As long as paranoia's on the schedule somewhere. - It wasn't suicide. - Jagged edges to the breaks... small fragments, lack of circular... or radiating fractures or adherent spurs. What does that mean? This man was dead for several hours before the train hit him. [Saroyan] We are tighter than a nun's knees on this one. No press, no conjecture with anyone outside this room. - Why? - <i>Because we are gonna find...</i> the details of Senator Davis's death... without giving Oliver Stone or Michael Moore any ideas. Are we assuming Senator Davis's death was a coincidence? You wanna kill someone, planting yourself in front of a train probably not the best idea. But too early to make any assumptions. [Sighs] I am a diuretic seagull, people. Everything goes through me. 10:00 a.m., here, tomorrow. "Zackaroni," your turn to bring the doughnuts. Zackaroni? Cam noticed that I eat macaroni and cheese every day at lunch. - Every single day? - Yep. You should be okay with Dr. Saroyan getting the head of Forensics job. Why is that? Because you are a strictly rubber to the road, hardball scientist. You're not a flesh-pressing, ink-stained, policy-making "wanktard." - What are her qualifications? - Chief Coroner of New York for two years. Assistant Federal Coroner before that. - How am I doing? - Very well. Impressive. - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> - <i>Brennan.</i> We were discussing her mother's case. - Fine. - I'll be there in 15 minutes. Yes. Good, Dr. Brennan. We'll chat later. [Chuckles] It's a very interesting case. Brennan identified skeletal remains as her mother's... killed by a blow to the head. Initial suspect was her father. But in the end, we arrested... a pig farmer/hit man in witness protection. - Added wrinkle, Brennan gets a call... - Dr. Hodgins? You're chattering me to death 'cause you hope I'll forget you called me a wanktard. It's a made-up word. No meaning. My name is Lisa Supac, and I am the Assistant U.S. Attorney attached to this case. I'd like to hear first from the National Transportation and Safety Board. - Mr. Hobbes? - Thank you. At 8:04 this evening, a high-speed commuter train struck a private vehicle. The front car derailed, killing three people, including Senator Paula Davis. Preliminary indications show that the car was placed there purposely. Dr. Brennan, was theJeffersonian... able to confirm that the driver of the car was Warren Lynch? Dental records and physical characteristics established that. - Yes. - The vehicle was registered to Mr. Lynch. We'll <i>verify</i> that the jewelry found on his body was his. - Plus, we have this. - [Beeps] [Supac] Aphotograph from the carpool lane? At 1:56 this afternoon, Mr. Lynch drove illegally in the diamond lane on l-270. Our good old Maryland State Police cameras... they caught the infraction. This is definitely the vehicle found on the tracks. Nobody saw or heard from Warren Lynch after this photo was taken. You can't honestly expect anyone to believe... that Warren Lynch committed suicide by driving into a train. Daniel Burrows, Security and Exchange Commission. We were about to lay charges against Mr. Lynch... that would not only wipe him out financially but send him to prison for several years. I heard rumors. But for a man like Lynch to kill himself... Mr. Lynch did not commit suicide. Dr. Brennan's examination shows that he was dead for at least six hours... before the train struck his car. - Dead how? - I don't know that yet. But can we assume that it was foul play? When it becomes public knowledge that Warren Lynch is dead... stock in Lynchpin International's gonna plummet. Well, it sucks for the people who invested in Lynchpin, but otherwise... That's a motive for murder. How is losing money a motive? [Burrows] It's called shorting the stock. Basically you bet that the share price is gonna fall. And when it does, you collect. - How much we talking? - Tens, maybe hundreds, of millions. [Woman] Yes, these are Warren's things. I bought him the I.D. bracelet on our first anniversary. [Booth] "Casu consulto." - What does that mean? - Accidentally on purpose. - Why do you know things like this? - It was my husband's motto. Mr. Lynch wrote about it in his autobiography. He played basketball in college. Made it all the way to the national championships. Warren was a high scorer, but a player on the other team locked him out of the key. Warren injured the opposing player, sent him to the hospital... and made it look completely inadvertent. "Accidentally on purpose." He wrote this about himself as if it were a good thing? Well, you don't become Warren Lynch by playing by the rules. I'm still his wife. So this all comes to me now, correct? Still his wife, Mrs. Lynch? Were you and Mr. Lynch having marital problems? Warren and I were separating. - Why? - Infidelity. Hmm. On whose part? I found out that Warren was seeing someone. - Only <i>someone</i> turned out to be... - Some dozen. Hmm. I'm gonna need a list. When Brianna confronted Warren, he had a private investigator look into her activities. I admit, he didn't come up dry. - Private investigator's name? - Rick Turco. He was one of Lynch's all-purpose, go-to, dirty-work fixer. Yeah. I'm familiar with Rick Turco. Thank you for your cooperation. Cheating spouse who stands to inherit it all. Corrupt business practices. And Turco, the private dick. Where do we start? Two types of glass were embedded in what was left of Lynch. - We'll start with glass. - Tempered automotive safety glass and silicate. Tempered glass came from the car windows. What about the other? It's 70% amorphous silicon dioxide. - What's that? - It's a common domestic container. Oh. Like a jar. Why can't we just say a jar? - Anything new, Zackaroni? - Zackaroni? The victim's left shoulder and elbow were badly dislocated postmortem. You mean between the time he died and the time he got hit by the train? [Brennan] Blood flow was nonexistent when the dislocation occurred. Okay. You guys do this stuff, and I'll start on Turco. - What's that? - A private investigator. Turco's an affliction. I'll set up a meeting and call you. You shouldn't call me Zackaroni. Yeah. I knew that the moment I said it. I'm going to get a bone mineral density reading. You didn't actually want the job, did you? I don't even know what the job is. Well, Goodman will explain his decision. Goodman appointed Dr. Saroyan while I was on vacation... then took a two-month sabbatical to avoid me. - That explains a lot. - All right. You know, I think... it's because you are very task-oriented. Zack? Task-oriented is a euphemism for lacking overall perspective. Oh, no. No. Yeah. Yeah. A little. Like, when's my birthday? I can get the computer to remind me about birthdays. [Sighs] That's one of a gajillion examples. You could tell me the other gajillion minus one. What do you see, Zack? Uh, bone loss. Lack ofbone density suggests that Warren Lynch was much older than his 40s. But the other indicators of age... epiphyseal rings, cranial sutures... all disagree. Age doesn't explain the ossification of cartilage where the ribs meet the sternum. - Well, what does explain it? - <i>[Brennan] Opiates.</i> Warren Lynch was a heroin addict. Agent Booth, I'm a private investigator. My greatest asset is my discretion. Brianna Lynch already told us that you work for her husband. Well, Miss Lynch is welcome to say whatever she likes. That client confidentiality routine no longer exists when the client is dead. That's not the assurance I give my very demanding, very high profile clients. Till death do us not part. Yeah. How would your very demanding, very high profile clients feel... if they found out that you procured heroin for Warren Lynch? [Exhales] What? Warren Lynch was a heroin addict. I'm gonna open up a drug investigation on <i>you,</i> Mr. Turco. Once the press gets wind of that, your very high profile clients... will find some other unprincipled Mr. Fix It. Warren Lynch was a junkie? - What's your evidence? - Bones? Well, so what does all this mean? - Sum it up for the man, Bones. - Warren Lynch suffered declining bone mass... due to long-term abuse of his hypothalamic pituitary gonadal access. Nothing says junkie like your gonads' access, Ricky. I had no idea. And I certainly never procured any heroin for him. Warren Lynch sure as hell wasn't trolling for $10 hits in Lincoln Heights. Come on, Agent Booth. You know my rep. I'm a sin eater. I make problems go away. You mean like when Lynch's wife found out that he was sleeping with other women? - Oh. - [Sighs] All right. Anything I say, strictest confidence, correct? Hmm. Warren Lynch brought me in to deal with a blackmailer. Warren Lynch was being blackmailed? - By one of his girlfriends? - That would be my assumption, yes. I paid 'em off before. But this was a much bigger deal. More serious. - Had to be the heroin, right? - How'd it play out? I negotiated the payment down from a mil to a quarter million, paid 'em off. - That was three days ago. - How? - Dead drop at Rock Creek Park. - And you have no idea who it was? Well, I had a phone call. I traced it back. It dead-ended on a stolen cell phone. You did a good job. Given your heroin bombshell, I went back to what tissue remained... and found traces of laudanine and reticuline... alkaloids found in the opium poppy. I'd like Angela to do a facial reconstruction. Confirm my finding? - It's handy having a pathologist right in the building. - To turn opium into heroin... it's exposed to hot acetic anhydride, which produces 18 neutral impurities. The ratio of these impurities indicates the heroin's origin. In this case, Mexico. Mexican heroin is very common. I... I wonder if there's anything we can do to narrow it down further. - Gas chromatography... - [Beeping] shows there was also fentanyl in the heroin. What's that? This reminds me of when you interviewed me to be your grad student. She knows what fentanyl is. It's a narcotic which boosts the effects of the heroin. According to Metro cops... 14 addicts O.D.'d this week off this one shipment. - Have you told Booth? - I'll leave that to you. How'd I do? I thought she did quite well. You said you had something else to show me. [Zack] In a car fire, gasoline vapor ignites at 280 degrees Celsius... and rises to a flame temperature of 2,200 degrees. [Hodgins] If the gas tank were full at the time of impact... the fire should have burned for approximately 20 minutes without intervention. Tell me that's not a real skeleton. No. We made him out of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. And Spam. Twenty minutes now! That's still a significant amount of Spam. And according to the fire department report... the car burned for 40 minutes, and it still took four minutes to put out. - Which means there was extra fuel. - And the extra glass you found? - Five-gallon mason jars. - <i>[Zack] Six of them.</i> - Filled with gasoline. - Yeah, or moonshine. Why does the whole lab smell like a luau? Zack and Hodgins are proving that there was extra accelerant in Lynch's vehicle. - Using what medium? - Artificial bone covered with Spam. Turn this off. - Why wasn't I told about this? - [Chuckles] I encourage independent inquiry. Your encouragement does not signify my authorization. If it happens again, I will take action. And I'm from New York, which means that I will take New York action. Am I clear? - Not at all. - I'm from Michigan. Dr. Saroyan means she'll make us watch musical theater. Wrong New York. I'm more from the "get mugged in broad daylight" tradition. This is not a high school science fair. This is theJeffersonian Institute. Unauthorized experiments in Forensics will get you fired. But we're Hodgepodge and Zackaroni. - And they work for me. - What I'd really like to do is enjoy a meeting of the minds. But if you insist on an organizational pyramid... I will be at the top. [Booth] Spam? [Brennan] They're mason jars filled with gasoline in the backseat... intended to break when the train hit. - Wow. And they got this with Spam? - Yeah, Spam. Hmm. And Cam, she got all bent out of shape. She wants to authorize all experiments. Great. You know, Zack and Hodgins... they do an experiment with fake bones and Spam. - What is your Spam fixation? - A defense lawyer hears Spam... he makes a joke, and the jury laughs. And everything we get from theJeffersonian is framed as <i>goofy</i> science, you know... from a bunch of squints with no connection to the real world. - That wouldn't happen. - Really? And the time you dropped the dead monkey down the elevator shaft? That was to show... Okay, I take your point. Cam's goal is a successful prosecution in a court of law. - Same as mine and yours. - No. You're all about finding the truth. Okay, your words say good, but your tone says bad. - So it's confusing. - Cam knows that too much truth... - is just as bad as too little. - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> Okay? Which is why she got the job. Booth. Angela says that you and Cam had a sexual relationship. Does that affect your view of her? Patch me through. Wildly out of line. Just so you know that. - When? - Hmm. - Did you get the doer? - Personal prerogative... - is at the heart of scientific inquiry. - Bones. - [Sighs] - Thanks for the notification. What? The man who was charged with murdering your mother... The pig farmer, Vince McVicar. He was killed. - Today at the Alexandria Federal Holding Facility. - [Sighs] [Sighs] I don't... He was the only connection to my father. His trial was gonna be my... How am I ever gonna find out what really happened? [Saroyan] That's not Warren Lynch. - How accurate is this thing? - [Brennan] It's not the machine that's accurate. It's Angela, and she's good. That is not Warren Lynch. Hey, Zack provided a skull, and this is the face that goes with it. Could it be the wrong skull? Zack doesn't make that kind of mistake. He's also very good. - What about the dental records? - I'll check 'em for tampering. - But you're certain that the body in the car... - Is not Warren Lynch. - Absolutely certain. - All right. [Supac] The man in the car was not Warren Lynch? No. This was the man behind the wheel. - You had dental records. - <i>Well, somebody digitized...</i> Lynch's dental X-rays and then refilmed them... utilizing authentic alphanumeric bar codes. - The records were expertly faked. - Where the hell is Warren Lynch? I've informed the F.B.I. that they might want to start looking for him. In the meantime, we're moving to I.D. this guy. Mistakes like this cannot happen when the case concerns a dead senator. Miss Montenegro uncovered a fraud. That's the opposite of a mistake. Save it for the press conference, Dr. Saroyan. Thank you. Hey, if you'd made a mistake, I'd have thrown you to the wolves. [Booth] Metro cops hinted the guy pushing the Mexican heroin... laced with fentanyl is Eddie Bean... young guy, baldy-headed, 5'5", 145 pounds. You know, if drugs were legalized... they could be dispensed from clean, safe, controlled outlets... by trained personnel... not in alleyways by criminals. Yeah, right. - Hey, that's our guy. Let's go. - Oh, no, no. Shh. What we gotta do is we gotta wait until he deals. Catch him in the act. - We wait? For how long? - However long it takes. What do we do while we wait? This is a stakeout. We converse. Well, I tried to initiate conversation on the drug war but... Oh, God, fine. You know what? Let's just talk about something we're not gonna argue about. [Sighs] - Been out to your mother's grave? - Not since the funeral. - Really? - Why would I? - Well, to connect. - She's dead. Fine. You know what? Forget it. Dead. As in gone from this world. [Man Shouting, Indistinct] Excuse me. I'm curious. Um, do you talk to the headstone? I mean, what do you... What do you say? It looks like I'm talking to the headstone. But what I'm really saying is that... Forget about where the words are aimed. What I say is that... I remember them. They can't hear you... because they're dead. My mouth moves, words come out... but none seem to get across the drawbridge... to the princess I know who awaits within. We're on! What princess? - Hey! Oh, hey, Eddie. - What the hell? What are you doing, Eddie? [Grunts] Pockets. Watch out for needles. Don't you have to read him his rights before you strangle him? - Empty. - I had to hold his throat closed... so he wouldn't swallow the evidence. All right. If you bite me... I will squeeze your little pinhead off. - [Groaning] - [Gagging] Okay. Oh, easy. - [Grunts] There it is! - You shouldn't swallow heroin. It's dangerous. - [Groaning] - Okay. Eddie. Eddie... Eddie. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Hey, Eddie. I'm gonna ask you a question, okay? You answer, you walk away. All right? - You don't answer... - You book me. I get sick. - I know the drill. - No. If you don't answer... I'm gonna cram this back down your throat without the protection. All right, you sold some of this crap to a tall guy, over six and a half feet tall. - Show him, Bones. - What? - Show him. - Oh, um... - Like that tall. - Uh, nobody I know. [Grunts] Here. Come on, eat it. Eat. - That's it. Get it in there. That's it. - [Coughing, Choking] - Ray! - Ray? - Ray! Ray Stewart. - Tell me about Ray, huh? Everybody knows him down here. He's a longtime skel. When was the last time you saw him? He bought a stick of dynamite about three days ago. I feel I should alert you. There's an additive in this heroin that causes overdoses. - Well... - Thanks. - Hey, where'd you find her? - Museum. - <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i> - Oh. - We should warn the addicts. - Yeah. Like they do on a pack of cigarettes. When? Thanks. - What? - They found Warren Lynch. Mr. Lynch was thrown from a speeding car. It's a minor miracle he survived. It may be because he was already unconscious at the time. - Unconscious? - <i>Yes.</i> Badly beaten. Internal bleeding, broken ribs... both legs, some spinal damage, broken pelvis. - When can we talk to him? - Anytime you want... as long as you don't expect a response. This man has severe brain damage. Off the record, he's not going to wake up. Best case scenario, he spends the rest of his life hooked up to feeding tubes. This is one of the richest men in the country. Most of the time, that might mean something. Not now. Dr. Lawrence, this man holds the key... to how and why Senator Paula Davis died. I'm sorry. Anything that man has in his head, it's going to stay there. Excuse me. After Zack nagged me a hundred times... It's important for us to explain how the victim's shoulder and elbow were dislocated. [Angela] And I re-created the most likely sequence. [Bones Popping] - Ouch! - The victim was dead when this happened. He didn't feel it. Run it again. Looks like he was putting his jacket on. Corpses don't usually do that. These injuries occurred when the corpse was forced into a jacket. - Yeah. Most likely by two people. - Yeah. In a big hurry. They had a train to meet. - You got anything on the H.O.V. lane photograph? - Yeah. It was relatively easy to get the license plate numbers from these two cars. Yeah, well, I'll check 'em out. But there was another car. - In the next lane. - How do you know that? - Well, rich guys keep their cars shiny. - [Beeping] Adjusting for the diffraction oflight caused by the curve... It's a Navigator. But get this. [Beeping] I don't know if that's of any use to you. Yeah. It's of use. Booth, do either of these count as experiments? 'Cause if they do, we could both get fired... by your old sweetheart. [Chuckles] You know, you just quit telling Bones... - who you think I've slept with. - <i>[Angela] Think?</i> What do you mean, think? [Saroyan] Two people forced the corpse into a jacket. That's excellent work. - Who's that? - I think it's Rick Turco. Means Turco's probably the last person to see Lynch before he fell off the radar. Angela and Zack are scared that this counts as an experiment... and you are gonna fire them. Ah, I am getting through. Why did you take this job, Camille? - Why shouldn't I, Seeley? - Because it's basically herding cats... and you're a dog person. - Dogs herd cats. - Dogs don't do that. - Chase 'em up trees, whatever. - Seriously, Cam. Why did you take this job? [Clicks Tongue] These are titanium rib clippers from Germany. My last job, used bolt cutters from Home Depot. These are much, much nicer. This autopsy table has downdraft ventilation. No rotting corpse smell, Seeley. My last table didn't even have a drain. Think about that a second. Leaky corpse, no drain. So you took this job for better equipment? I've spent my whole professional life in basement rooms with no windows. Now I'm in theJeffersonian Institute. - What? - Gotta ask. - You <i>so</i> do not. - Or did you take this job because of... [Laughing] Oh, my God. The ego. [Mock Chuckling] Say it. Nothing to do with you. - I need Bones this afternoon. - Okay. It's about her mother's murder and her father's disappearance. - Plus, she dedicated her book to you, so... - It's a legitimate case, Cam. I know. I read the file. - Why hasn't she confronted me? - About what? About me being parachuted in over her head. - Finds me intimidating, right? - [Chuckling] Hey, I intimidate people. Yeah. Bones doesn't intimidate. Then what? You've seen the way she stares at human remains before she makes a decision. - Yes. - You're human remains... and she hasn't made a decision yet. How do I help her make the right decision? Go for the truth. Take care of her people. Oh, and I like the whole intimidation thing. I think it's cute. I got no reason to lie. I'm facing life at least. Probably gonna get executed. - What did you do? - Mr. Downs killed his entire family. I killed your friend... 'cause he cut in the cafeteria line and snagged the last orange juice. Broke off a sharpened toothbrush in his jugular. - Mr. Downs, the man you killed... - McVicar? He's not my friend. He killed my mother. - You come to tell me thanks? - <i>No.</i> McVicar was my last chance to find out some things. McVicar might've known something about my father. I can't ask my father because he left a message... on my answering machine telling me to stop looking for him. [Guard In Distance] Move 'em out. I'll tell you what. Maybe... Iook at McVicar's murder as a second message from Max... one that he didn't use the phone for. We never mentioned my father's name was Max. - I'm done. - Did you perform a hit for Max Keenan? - You performed a hit for Max Keenan. - Take it as a sign from God. [Door Buzzes] How am I gonna tell Russ our father ordered the death of another human being? If he did that, and I'm not saying it happened that way... then your father took down the man who murdered his wife. Good people don't have other people murdered. Good people don't even know how. Your father buried your mother in a pair of new shoes in the cemetery... with her dolphin belt buckle that reminded her of you... because you both love dolphins. This does not make him a good man. People can be more than one thing. We were at a dead end. Okay? Now we're not. Okay? We know that your father got to Mitchell Downs, persuaded him to kill McVicar. We find out how he did that... we're that much closer to finding out what happened to your old man. I mean, that's if you still want to find him. - I do. - Okay. Silver lining. # [Soft Rock] # [Continues] # [Ends] - Warren Lynch was in on it. - Where'd that come from? He had his own dolphin. That "N.C., lots of A's," national championship ring. - His own dolphin. - All the rest of his jewelry... was removed and placed on the dead man... his $ 10,000 watch, his I.D. band from his wife, his two other rings. But not the championship ring. - That's good, Bones. - The only reason they wouldn't rip it off his hands is... Because Lynch was calling the shots. And I know exactly who was in on it. [Chuckling] So Warren Lynch and I conspired... to disappear him for a few days... so that we could profit from shorting Lynchpin stock, huh? - Well, you know, that's my thinking. - [Laughing] [Turco On Speaker] Then dressed a junkie in Warren's clothes... planted him in front of a train and... Wait. Did I murder the junkie? No. Bones said you probably found him dead. But what I think is that you and Lynch... intended a white-collar crime, but a senator died. [Turco On Speaker, Laughing] Then I got all hinky... and tossed Warren out of the car at 80 miles an hour. [Chuckling] Is that a confession? Nah. Nah. Just gettin' it straight. You know, as a professional investigator myself... I have to point out that blackmailers make much better suspects. Well, Lynchpin has no record of a quarter-million-dollar payout three days ago. Well, there's not exactly a column for blackmail payouts in the corporate books. If I'd only agreed to the full payout... Lynch might've never been taken by those animals. Hey, let's play a little show-and-tell, huh? 'Cause we can put you with Lynch moments before he fell off the radar. That's maybe me before he fell off the radar. We worked together. [Chuckles] You got nothin'. Booth. - Do that lying thing. - Could you be more specific? We tell him Lynch woke up and gave a statement incriminating him. - Turco knows the lying thing. - Tell him Lynch said something only Lynch could say. Oh, great idea, except for the "only Lynch could say" part. - [Gulps] The ring? - Ah, he'll ask for specifics of the conversations. - I gotta cut him loose. - What... He's gonna get away with it? Well, you know, that happens sometimes, Bones. That's that brown little smelly part of the job. Shoulder and elbow. The junkie's shoulder and elbow... were dislocated when they forced him into Lynch's jacket. - We don't know if Lynch was there for that. - It took two people. It was him. Come on, Booth. The part of you with the big gambling problem must love this idea. Right there. Mm-hmm. That's the reason you didn't get Cam's job. Oh, two against one. That's unfair. - Warren Lynch woke up. - Ah, and he's talking, right? Huh? Is he pointing his finger straight at me? - That's correct. - What's he saying? He let you take all of his jewelry except his championship ring. No. I asked, what did he say, in words. Hey, unless I'm under arrest, I'm leaving, folks. Mr. Lynch said it was difficult getting his jacket onto the corpse. Rigor mortis. You have a train to meet. You're in a hurry. And the sound of the shoulder popping. [Bones Popping] Then the elbow, like knuckles popping... [Popping] only louder. Sickening. Turco will admit to helping Warren Lynch place a dead body... in Mr. Lynch's car and rigging it to burn... with the intent of moving the market. Everything else, including placing it on the tracks... he says Lynch did on his own. - He's lying. - There's a small matter of proving that in court. - What's the maximum sentence on those charges? - Ten years. He killed three people. - <i>And put one in a coma.</i> - But Lynch deserves to be in a coma, so it doesn't count. Look. Turco puts all the blame on Lynch. He does 10 years... and he gets all the money from shorting the stock. It's 10 years or nothing. I can only work with what I'm given... and the forensic work on this was not good enough. - What? - <i>You were fooled by fake dental records...</i> you baked some Spam. [Saroyan] What did you want us to do? - Your jobs. - Hey! You want us to do <i>your</i> job. My people gave you all the evidence you need... to fry Turco with any reasonable jury. - Forensically... - We gave you everything you needed to arrest Turco. - Arrest is not a conviction. - <i>We gave you enough to reject his plea bargain...</i> and indict him in the wrongful death of a senator. - Indictment is not a conviction. - You accept that plea bargain, the investigation stops. Indict him. Give us time to give you what you need. If you accept this plea, you don't deserve to be a federal prosecutor. - Dr. Saroyan... - Yeah, it's scary. The whole country will be watching, and you don't want to go with less than a sure thing. But you put my people on the stand as expert witnesses, and that's a sure thing. - [Together] Not Zack. - <i>[Saroyan] You tell the story of what happened...</i> using the evidence these people provided. If you have any ability as a prosecutor, you'll win the case. - Are you finished? - No, Miss Supac. In the future, when you have problems with my team... you register them with me in private, not by grandstanding in a public forum. [Brennan] Okay, um... I'm starting to see why she got the job. [Booth] Well, looks like your brother was here. I never understood the idea of bringing flowers. Just for once, Bones, do what people do. Okay? See how it feels. Come on. That's it. I'm gonna go stand over here while you, uh, you know, talk to your mom. I told you, I don't do... that. Mmm. Mom, it's me, Temperance. [Scoffs] I have questions, but you can't answer them. No offense, but I don't think... there's anything here of you but your bones so... [Scoffs, Chuckles] I can't believe I'm doing this. Was Dad a good man or... a bad man? He had someone killed. Had him murdered and... [Whimpers] What's the truth? Do I... Do I keep looking, or do I let it go like he asked? Who's he protecting, himself? Or me and... Russ? [Exhales, Sighs] Booth, I asked the questions... and guess what. - No answer. - Well, maybe if you weren't standing... right on top of her, took a step to the left, showed a little respect. Sometimes it takes a while to get an answer, okay? Just leave the flowers. I get answers at a lab. You get them from people. Nobody gets answers from a slab of stone. Yeah? I see an answer in the stone. You buried your mother as Christine Brennan... the woman that you knew as your mother... and not by her real name, Ruth Keenan. That tells me who <i>you</i> are. - What do you got? - A dolphin. # [Soft Rock] - What does that tell you? - What does that tell <i>you?</i> My father was here. Because he loves your mother... and grieves her loss, and he came here to talk to her. You're tainting evidence. It's not that kind of evidence, Bones. It's evidence of something else... something that can't be tainted. # [Continues] It's beautiful.
