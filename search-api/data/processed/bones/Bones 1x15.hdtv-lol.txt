Oh! I startled you? Yeah, I was just chatting with a friend online. Sorry. But we have a new delivery. Top priority. Sounds like a good friend? Yes, it's fascinating how interest and intimacy can be cultivated online. So you've never met this friend? I have done enough googling to schedule dinner. You said there is a... delivery? The bones washed ashore on Chesapeake Bay. Judging from the algae, he's been fish food for quite a while. They ate her both tibiae. Remains show evidence of bullet wounds Which would explain why he has all those holes in him. Looks as though they weren't made by a .32. Maybe a .38. Heard you might need a face? The FBI's pretty certain this is James Cugini. They're looking for evidence that could lead them to the killer. Wow, Jimmy Cugini! I don't know who that is. It's a mob boss. He disappeared 6 years ago after his daughter's dance recital. Cement shoes! Pretty trite. Why mess with the classics? Did they find any of the bullets? No. Oh, the mafia are quite good at this. Should we really be involved in mob stuff? I mean, they're really into the whole killing thing. I can provide you with the job description, if you've forgotten what we do here, Dr. Hodgins. After you clean them up, Zach, I want you to X-ray the bones for any bullet fragments. Be very careful cleaning the exit and entrance wounds. I want to recover any markings the bullet left as it passed through the bone. Yeah, I could have them ready about 8 tonight. I -- can't work tonight. Somewhere around early morning's fine. You have a date tonight? It's not a date. It's a meal. With a man? Did you meet him on the website I told you about? You're dating online? Well, it's a practical way of objectively examining a potential partner without all the game-playing. That comes later if it works out. Hi, I'm Angela. Special Agent Jamie Kenton. Dr Brennan? Hey. You two know each other? I was at the Bureau when Booth took his coffee ***. Apparently, they're both the world's greatest FBI agents. That's right. Kenton's worked in the Cugini case. He's one of the original investigators. This is Brennan's brain trust. The victim is over here. So what if your computer date's a psycho? Only about a billion people date online. I have. Whatever happened to seeing someone across a crowded room, eyes meeting, that old black magic gets you in its spell? There is no such thing as magic. Oh, it is magic. Are you here for a reason? Because Agent Kenton is handling this. You have some remains to look at. Yeah, I'm already looking at them. No, not the Cugini case, Kenton will babysit him. These are fresh. But I was told that our friend in the cement shoes has precedence. That was before we found someone tortured and ripped apart by dogs. 90% of flesh is missing because of mutilation and post-mortem ?anthropo?phagy caused by canine scavenging. They have to stay here? Wait and see if you need them. No, not now. Ask them to save the excrement for Hodgins. Throw these dogs out of here! Lucky Hodgins. Where are the eyes? Gone. Gouged out? Yes. You can see the scrapings in the orbital cavities. Much rougher than the knife scarring. It was done with a different weapon. Son of a bitch. You seen this before.00:04:18.8:Yeah. 3 years ago, we found a 17 year old girl in a tool shed, bound, slashed, eyes gouged out. Nothing for her parents to identify. Suspect was Kevin Hollings. Everything pointed to him, but we couldn't get the hard evidence, so the DA refused to prosecute. It's twisted, Bones. It's like a game to him. He used dogs before? No. He's making the killings more elaborate. I think he's testing us. Until he goes too far and gets caught, isn't that the expected pathology? Yeah. Well, I can determine the kind of weapons, time of death, Hodgins might find something useful on the dogs. Brennan. Just working. Bag that. Yeah, of course. I'm starving. 7:30? OK. Yess. I'll meet you there. OK. Bye. My reservation just got pushed, so I have a few extra minutes. Oh, few extra minutes. Great. What? Nothing. You disapprove. I said "Great". With attitude. Don't go overboard with psychology. It's not your thing. Look, I am an adult, Booth. I see men, I go out with them, on occasion I sleep with them. Hey, that's cool. But you don't even know who this guy is that you're meeting. I have trekked through Tibet avoiding the Chinese army. I think I can handle meeting someone for dinner. Fine. You know what? You have fun with Dick431 or whatever his handle is. Yeah. I will. Good. Thanks. Fine. Good. Victim is female, late teens -- mid twenties. Knife marks on the bone. Evidence of deep cuts, probably to open up the flesh, make it... more appetizing for the dogs. David! Hi! Yeah, I'm here. Well, I guess I'm two doors down. No, I know. The traffic on the Beltway can be brutal. OK. Bye. I need enlargements of the supraorbital notch. Have you examined the dogs' excrement? I'm doing the fecal flotation now. Never get to say that a lot. Check for fibres the FBI might have missed, as well as... You've already told him. Twice. Are you sure you don't want a drink? You know, it won't be difficult for someone to encode a secure data strip and plant it on an ID card with a cracked digitally encoded authentication data and sneak in here. That is possible. Are you two going to help or not? You know, Booth's pissed that you came here. He had more questions for you at the scene. He just doesn't want to come here because he has to park in the structure. I need her face as quickly as you can. Zack, these bullet wounds haven't been cleaned! I worked on them for hours, Dr Brennan. Then that wasn't long enough, was it? I'm sorry, but... You take a sinus probe, you put a little cotton swab on the end of it, you dip it in water and you dab it inside the wound until it's clean. The Sixtine Chapel took 13 years to clean properly. I didn't think we had that kind of time. Bones, what the hell are you doing? Working. Why does everyone find that so odd? Why? I don't know why. Because maybe an hour ago someone tried to kill you? I don't think it's a good idea for you to continue to work these cases. This is what I do, Booth. Look, whoever killed these victims wants to make sure you don't finish your investigation. Hundreds of criminals would like me to stop what I do. Are you suggesting that I just give up my career? Just be reasonable! Fine. Logic suggests that the shooter is involved in one of these cases. So I should find out who killed them before he tries to shoot me again. Did forensics recover the bullets that were meant for me? Ballistics is running tests on them right now. And have you picked up the suspect in the young woman's murder? Hollings. I don't want to spook him until we have got enough evidence. But I got guys watching him. Did you get a list of women missing age... 18-25, yes, they're on your server. Bones, everyone is doing their job. OK, I'll see if any of them match the victim. What about the Romano family? Hodgins said they were feuding with the Cuginis. Kenton is pulling all the files on the case and all mob activity 6 years ago. Bones, there is one other person we have to look at. Your date. I spoke with him, Booth. He was in his car in traffic. And why would he want to kill me? Why would somebody want to kill your victim over there? Look, Bones, I know it's hard for you to admit that you might be wrong about something. But I really don't care about your feelings right now. I'm more concerned with your life. So, to bring your date in for interrogation, grab your coat. I'm working. Bones, I'm not letting you out of my sight until I find out who is trying to kill you. Temperance! David! Someone shot at you? Yeah. Oh my god. I know. What can I do? Excuse me, I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth. I'll be asking the questions. Wanna sit down? Sure. I mean, I didn't see anything. When I got to the restaurant I saw all the cops, but I had no idea that it had to do with you. You're an investment banker, good-looking guy, but you have to find your women online. Excuse me? Don't you find any women at work? Well, she was online too, and she's a great-looking doctor. Your picture doesn't do you justice, by the way. Thank you. Yours either. I-- The resolution must not be really good online. Bones-- Oh, he's a Luddite. Hey! That's someone who is afraid of technology. I know what a Luddite is. So, you're saying that you were stuck in traffic.Â´ What, you think that I shot at her? I'm a fundraiser for the Brady campaign against gun violence. Do you think I tried to kill you? He has to do this. Yeah, I have to do this. So what time did you leave work? About 6:45. Any witnesses? Yeah. My assistant Margaret Jensen, the client that I was with, the valet that saw me pull out of the parking garage. I mean, unless they're all suspects too. We'll be talking to everyone. Check traffic report. It was a mess. He did. You did. What? Do I have to get an attorney? Just stay close, in case we need you for anything else. Yeah, sure. Anything I can do to help. So, this whole... you know, online thing. How long does it last? 'Cause if it's just the way that, you know-- ****** that's pretty low. You know, one of my partners met his wife online. You're kidding. No. They've been married for five years. That doesn't mean it's not creepy. OK. I'm sorry. Did I miss something? 'Cause I don't want to get in the way of anything between you. What? Oh, no. - No. No. Well then, maybe we could reschedule that? - No. Sure. Great. I think someone who needs this room. Let's go. Uh, yeah, sure. I'll email you. Stay safe. - She will. He's nice, don't you think? Yeah, he's nice. As a suspect! What... Hello? Hey. The victim is Penny Hamilton, 19. She was a student at American who disappeared walking back to her dorm. She was about to go to Haiti to work at a medical clinic. Booth is going to think this is his fault. He knew her? The killer has done this before. Booth couldn't get the evidence he needed. The guy promised Booth he never would. Where is Booth, anyway? I thought he wasn't going to let you out of his sight. I gave him the positive ID on Cugini. He's calling it in to Kenton. So how do you like David? It's not often you can interrogate a guy on the first date. I like him. Booth still doesn't approve, but I told him to mind his own business. Hey. Booth is a big, strong, hot guy who wants to save your life. I mean, you actually have a knight in shining FBI standard-issue body armour. So cut him some slack. Kenton heard the Romanos were pissed that they reopened the investigation. When they get pissed, they shoot. I've cleaned the bones, Dr Brennan. You could eat off them. Is this her? Yeah. Nice work, Zack. You can see some of the markings left on the bone where the bullet passed through. I can? Yes. Here and here on the outer compact bone. Do you think you could use a computer to recreate the complete imprint the bullet left? I don't know if I have enough here to work with. What are you getting at? After it's discharged, every bullet has a distinct pattern etched into it from the barrel of the gun, right? That same pattern would be etched into the bone, as it passes through. If we can recover that pattern, we can reverse-engineer the bullet. Then you will be able to tell which weapon was used. Make, model, the whole shitbag. I've never heard of that technique. It's a theory I've been working on. I thought this would be a good time to test it. Great. Knock yourself out. All right, anything more about the girl? The knife marks were made by a non-serrated blade, consistent with a pocket knife, like this one. I found additional knife marks on C5, indicating that the throat was slashed. And about her eyes? The groove in the eye sockets doesn't match anything on the knife. And Hodges is playing with dog poop, so everyone's got something to do. Let's go. What? Kenton is putting together everything he's got on Cugini's disappearance. I'm probably more valuable here. No, your definitely more valuable alive. Right? I'm not leaving you alone. Come on! If it's so dangerous here, why are you leaving us? Big strong guy like you, huh? You'll be able to take care of yourself. Worked undercover with the Romanos for 2 years. Never got very high in the organization. I left when I thought my cover was being blown. Do you think someone from the Romanos did this? They have to be. Hard to tell who, though. They use a lot of different guys for a job like this. This is Frank Lombardi. He's been seen in the area. Suspected of killing more than 25 people. Shooting mostly, though he likes the occasional garroting. So you think they tried to do away with the good Doctor here? You know, they're trying to look more legit. They don't want any ancient history re-surfacing. Bad for business. But you don't know it's them. I still have my sources. They tell me the Romanos know you work in this case, and they know you're the best. I recommend you walk away. Is that why you brought me here? To scare me into giving up? I want you to get real. These people you're dealing with... We don't know who we're dealing with. It could be them, it could be Hollings... No, no. Serial killers, they follow a pattern. They don't bind and torture and this, they're picking people off with a high-powered rifle. You said Hollings promised no one would ever find enough to get him. Maybe he knows that I can. Either way, too dangerous. You almost caught a bullet in the skull. I can give you answers, Booth. I can help you get Hollings. You really want me to walk away because it's dangerous? Sorry, man, I tried. Any more back from Ballistics on the bullets that were meant for me? Yeah, it's a military issue. ***Colt*** DR-15. Brennan. Fasciola hepatica. It's a parasite found in beef liver. I found their eggs in the dog excrement. The dogs were strays. They were starving. Someone must have lured them to the scene with liver scraps, because there was no evidence of any liver found at the scene. So if we find any traces of the parasite, we can tie them to the dogs. It's possible. I also found out that the cut marks on her bones showed that the pocket knife hat a nick in the blade. OK. Thanks. Agent Booth? Long time no see. Hollings. Wondering if we could take a look around your place. Do you have a warrant? No, but you enjoy being cooperative, if I remember. Come in. Please. It must be Dr Brennan? I heard about the incident the other night. You must have had quite a fright. Don't play with her, Hollings. I hope you don't think I was being insensitive. Maybe you tell me what you're looking for, and I could help? We just want to look around, that's all. Be my guest. Could I open this? Of course. Is this about the girl they found the other night? Terrible thing. You don't think I'm involved in this one too, do you, Agent Booth? Blades are clean. No nicks. I guarantee you that whatever you're looking for, you're not going to find it here. What we need might be locked up someplace. Wow. Dozens of keys here. Tens of thousands. Maybe we'll just take them down to the Bureau, look through them. That's a private collection. I'm afraid without cause or a warrant... Oh, you see, I do have cause. See this key here? It's from a federal building. It says, "Do not duplicate". And the other one looks like it was used in a burglary just around the corner. And-- oh, since you did allow us in your home... This is very rude, Agent Booth. I open my home to you and let this... Before anything is removed, we should photograph everything. How he's arranged the items in the room could be very important. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to call my attorney. Game's not so fun though, is it, Hollings? I have a court date tomorrow morning at 10. You had no right to confiscate his collection. Oh, there were burglaries in the area. Those keys, they could give us some answers. My client can't be tied to any of those burglaries. You're probably right, you see, but I have a job to do, man. Mr Hollings here has always been so understanding with that in the past. Oh, I do understand. I've given you a statement, explained where I got the keys... And since you haven't charged him with anything... Yeah. But I'm really looking forward to charging him with this. Look at that. I imagine it must be very frustrating when you can't solve a crime. My client is a respected researcher with Whitley Chemical. He hasn't missed a day of work in the past two weeks. Unless you have evidence to hold him... Can't stop looking at it, can you, Hollings. What does it do to you? Does it make you hot? That the psycho? He's brilliant. He knew we were looking for a pocket knife, so he left one in plain sight. The wrong one. If you don't find anything concrete, he walks again, right? I don't know if Booth could live with that. Those keys have to lead somewhere. Here are the files we had on all those suspects. People we knew worked for the Romanos 6 years ago. You got physical descriptions, blood types, everything we had. Might come in handy to find any more evidence on the body. Thanks. After we recreate the bullet, we can track the angle of entry based on height and ... I don't get it. You don't have the physical round that was shot. I'm trying to make one, based on the wounds. Could give us the murder weapon. Sweet! If it works. You can't hold him. You let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. Sure. I can and I will. You're fishing. No judge is going to let you keep that collection, Agent Booth. You have to know that. We'll have it back by tomorrow. Nice try. We got the keys on pretty shaky ground. The judges can release them in less than 18 hours, unless we can find something tangible. So Bones thought maybe you could help. I don't see how. I'm an archaeologist. She told me you could look at it as though it was some kind of historical site. I suppose that's a reasonable assumption. A person's environment as a reflection of who he is. ***, very smart, enjoys the game, feels like he's untouchable... The room is centered around this chair. You can see how he's surrounded back and sides by the bulk of the keys. If this were an innocent collection, he'd be facing it. But in this configuration, he's displaying it. A guy like this, you know, his kill surprises. We are searching through these keys now, to see if we can match them to a storage locker or another apartment, but there's just too many of them. Mayan rulers kept souvenirs of their kills. They called the display a <i>tzompantli</i>. It was believed that it showed their strength and power and would strike fear into anyone who saw it. He's a loner. Yes. But this gave him enough power and security that he let you into his home. He's right-handed, correct? Yeah, right. Well, the bulk of the keys are on his right side. Those with the greatest value to him would be in reach. They hold his power. I would look at any of the keys in the containers on his right side, over here. I thought it could be a saw blade of some kind. I compared the damage with these. But the crenulations form a regular pattern. They don't match what we see in the orbital cavities. What if she was struggling? Lack of haemorrhage in the surrounding eye tissues suggests she was already dead before the eyes were removed. We need to look for something smaller, maybe a surgical instrument. The concrete used to sink Cugini is composed of class F fly ash instead of Portland cement, which is very exciting. Not yet. Each concrete company has its own unique mixture. Certain building codes have to be met, but after that it's up to each company. These people were cutting corners by using fly ash, which is much cheaper. Tapford Construction. 6 years ago, it was owned by Carlo Romano. Romano doesn't seem very worried. Yeah, that's hubris. Good word! Thank you. He won't seem so smug after we talk to him. I got the names of everyone of his employees from his construction companies 6 years ago, pulling sales invoices. Can be a lot of stuff to sort through. Hodgins is going to try and see if there is any ***scan*** or fingernail in the concrete to pull DNA from. That's another remote possibility. Booth. Yeah. Judge ordered release of Hollings' possesions. There's no grounds to hold him. How many keys have they made it through? Well, the lab had to match key types, *** numbers, cross-reference to logs, compare to crenulations... To crenulations? They've even been through the first 500, Bones, so I don't think... There is no lock. Those keys don't open anything. What are you talking about? The crenulations, the grooves, carved into the bone around the victim's eyes-- they were irregular, like-- like the grooves of a key. Bones, how many keys do you need? Well, car, house, lab, morgue -- I need a lot of keys. Grooves? He must have used a key to gouge out the eyes. And he kept it near him, in his apartment. That was his souvenir. How much longer can you keep the keys here confiscated? He's on his way to reclaim them right now. So you have at least a half an hour, maybe more? At least. OK, so tell Forensics to forget about matching them to any locks. Have them image each key and send this to Zack so he can find the key that matches the grooves on the bone. That shouldn't take long. Image keys, send to Zack. Right. She's good, huh? Told ya. Romano didn't give us anything, so I should probably be back at the lab. No, your squints can handle that. You haven't slept in over a day. You need to get some rest. I'll sleep on the couch. You-- think you're staying here with me? Yeah! Nice place by the way, Bones. No, I'm locked in here, Booth, I'll be fine! Hey, look. I want you to stay away from your windows, too. A sniper has a clear shot from any of the surrounding buildings. I could've just stayed at the lab. The security's tight there. And you would've worked, you would've gotten tired, you would've been more vulnerable when you did go out. Trust me, this is the best. So-- Where's the TV? I had one, but it broke. I'm-- I mostly just read and listen to music... So let's listen to some music, ah? Music! What do we got? Bones? Uh, world music. *** ***shock*** Tibetan throat singers! Rock on. That's-- mostly for work. *** ***, ***cat powell***... Oh oh, all right, look at this! Man, that's a lot of jazz! Wow! I'd think all that free-form stuff would be a little bit too unpredictable for you. No, I love it! The artist has to live within a set tonal structure and trust his own instincts to find his way out of an infinite maze of musical possibilities, and the great ones do. What? No, nothing. I-- I just never expected that you would-- you know. That I would love music? Well, I don't usually get to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I thought... Nah, I didn't mean to make you self-conscious. Whoa, what's this? Ha! What is it? Nice. Booth! How did that get there? Oh, please! Everybody loves Foreigner. Hot blooded! Talk about a guilty pleasure. Brennan! David, hi! I'm fine, thanks. Booth, yeah. I'm still under lockdown until we solve these crimes. Yes. Foreigner. OK, sure, I'll talk to you tomorrow. OK, thanks for calling. Bye. I hope you didn't think... No. No, 'cause I-- I wouldn't want to ruin the thing for you. Not a problem. Hey, you got a soda? Juice? Yeah, in my fridge. I'll get it. No, no. You know what, I'm not your guest. You don't have to wait on me. I'll get it. You want anything? That's OK. Oh, there are some glasses in the cupboard to the right of the fridge. Kenton is on his way over. You have to promise me that you're going to stay with him. I will. Did they gather all the evidence from the explosion? Yes. You sure? Yes. Booth, I was there. They were very thorough. And I was very annoying. Sorry, Booth. It should be me lying in that bed. I'm fine, you know. I don't even know if I have to stay here. You got blown up. I've been through worse. You have burns, lacerations, 2 broken ribs, greenstick fracture of the clavicle... OK, I got blown up. Can you-- can you hand me one of the puddings? Oh, man. Thanks, Bones. Look at that. You know-- On your X-rays, there's a history of multiple fractures on your feet consistent with beating. It's a common method of torture in the Middle East. Beating the soles of the feet with pipes or hoses... I know. And there are indications of injuries sustained while you were shielding someone. How the hell can you tell something like that? The scarring shows that the ribcage spread in such a way that... Yeah. OK. That buddy of mine-- he lost his weapon, and I... I tried. He didn't make it. You know, you shouldn't be looking at my X-rays. I'm sorry. Hey. Yeah. You look like crap. A little bit more of this pudding and I'll be just fine. Stick with her. If you want me to. Don't you think I should be consulted? No. And keep her close. Don't worry. Could have been you. Yes, Zack, I know. The only reason he survived was that he was reaching for the glass. I know. Can we change the subject? Let's talk revenge. Bloodlust. The cathartic release we're looking for can only be achieved when we successfully gather enough evidence to neutralize the person or persons responsible for putting Booth in the hospital. Neutralize can mean either kill or arrest. Yes, it can mean either. I don't get it. What exactly are you doing? I'm using a digital enhancement program to fill in the missing markings made by the bullet while it passed through the bone. Impressed? I have so many more tricks. There's no ring. Single or gay? Gay? Why would you say gay? Brokeback, baby. Gotta ask. Not gay. Angela... We'll talk later. So you'd match a digital replica of the bullet with any recovered bullets the FBI has? Yes, so we can cross-reference crimes, suspects, weapons... Amazing. I just finished working with forensics at the FBI, analyzing the chemical composition of the explosives. The isotopes in the sulphure are like a fingerprint. It is a perfect match to the sulphure manufactured by the chemical company Hollings works for. FBI! Go! Go! Show yourself! Clear! He took off. He marked the same part of town we found the other victim. Gone after someone else. I want all this back. Brennan. We found the key. FBI said Hollings never returned to claim them. It matches the bone damage exactly. And it's definitely one of Hollings' keys. Yes. Hodgins tried to retrieve DNA from it, but he says it was dipped in some kind of chemical bath to remove anything organic. Good work. Maybe you should come in now, Dr Brennan. I'll be fine, Zack. Any luck with the bullet? You want to go back to the lab till we get any other news? You're safer there. Actually, Zack, I'll see you in a few minutes. He's got the ball again... Hey. Why are you here? Is Brennan all right? Sure. Yeah, no, she's with your compadre. I just came by to see how you are. Oh. Pudding! I still remember this stuff from when I got my appendix out. Yeah. It's as good as you remember. The key fit? Yeah. And they found a map of the neighborhood where the other body was found, and some more keys. A map? We didn't catch that before? I guess not. Or maybe your killer is getting sloppy. That's not like him. It isn't like him to use explosives either. People change. That's a wonderful thing about life. I hope we get him before he gets Brennan. Can I have this one? You OK? Uh? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just thinking. People don't really change. We like to believe they do, but they don't. You think he knew that it's the mob guys were after? I'm just thinking, the things-- they don't make sense. You're feeling something a little more devious. Like a frame-up? I like it. Very conspiratorial. Things are just too neat. Hollings would never leave a map there. Go with me on this: Mob guys know you're closing in and want to throw you off by making it look like the psycho. These guys have been involved in conspiracies a lot more complicated than this. They set up Lee Harvey Oswald, worked with the CIA to kill Castro, forget about what they did to Marilyn Monroe! Someone planted that evidence so that we'd find it. Someone who knew what we were up to. Someone at the lab works for the mob! I can see it. There's not much difference between a corrupt corporate government and organized crime. You're right. Excuse me? The only way that this could unfold is if someone on the inside was orchestrating things. People never tell me I'm right. They only say I'm crazy. Love you, man. What the hell are you doing? You're driving. Cool. Yeah. OK, make sure there's backup. Spotted someone taking a woman into those old abandoned buildings off Hunter Blvd. I'll drop you off at the... No, I'm coming. Booth said it was pointless to argue. He's a smart man, Booth. I'll just call Zack. I think I know how to complete the bullet. Even if we have only one side, if we can approximate the spin as it was fired... You really are the best. It's too bad. He worked for the FBI *** *** get information. Kenton was working organized crime at the same time that Cugini was killed. He was the only one who knew the details of both investigations, so he takes what he knows about Hollings to throw suspicions off himself. Maybe that nurse was right to be pissed that you were leaving. You don't seem good, Booth. Not if it weren't a toy car. Yeah. Listen to me, Bobby. Let's get some units out there now. I want to know about any activity in the abandoned buildings on that map. Brennan's not picking up her cellphone. Kenton, he never call for backup or surveillance or anything. Jesus. How could I be so stupid. I mean, everything pointed to him. Hey, it is not your fault. How could it not be my fault? It was my job to protect her. Instead, I handed her over to him. This sort crime you just gotta let slide. A death like Cugini is just something that's an internal issue. Doesn't affect anyone else. You killed Cugini? You don't get rich working for the FBI. When I was undercover, the Romanos were very good to me. And you accept their generosity, you have no choice but to do what they ask. Is that how you live with yourself, you take choice out of the equation? It's no different than Booth taking out someone from the other side when he was a sniper in the Gulf. That was a war. His actions saved lives. You don't think hitting *** Cugini ended a street war? So my death, how do you justify it now? The Bureau keeps a shell from every weapon it issues. You match that slug, it points to my weapon and I go down. The Romanos make sure I don't talk. Uh, at least I'm dying for a good reason. You know, maybe you're wrong. I mean, Hollings is missing, right? Convenient, huh? Kenton'd plant the lead so that we'd find her and go after Hollings, who we would never find. Because he's dead? Because he's dead. That conspiracy thing is a lot more intense when you're in the middle of it. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK, an agent talked to a witness who saw a couple go into a building off the North 23rd. Just "a" building? Oh yeah, that's really specific. Crackheads aren't that detail-oriented. Step on it, come on. They are not gonna find Hollings. You know, he used to slit their throat like they were cattle. Told me he used the key to unlock the soul behind their eyes. That was one sick bastard the world ain't gonna miss. We used thermal imagery to *** activity that was inside the buildings. A crack house, a couple squatters. ***squads*** moving here next He hears noise, he could freak out and kill her. We gotta be careful. There's no "we", Booth. I'm going with you. You can barely stand. I said I'm going with you! Give me my gun. Give me that vest for Booth! Wear this. Yeah. You know what? You can come too. Put that on and stay back. I can do that. I'm sorry. Really am. Maybe you shouldn't *** I'm not like him, though. The things I have to do to you... You'll be gone first. You'll never know a thing. I never expected anyone to find out. It's OK. I'm here. It's all over. I'm right here. All right. It's all over. How'd you get out of the hospital?

Yeah, I guess. You know-- I let you down, Bones. I'm sorry. You saved my life. Yeah, but you know, I shouldn't have gone down like that. What a pair. Brennan. Um-- I'm leaving right now. David. We're finally having our dinner. Yeah, I figured you didn't dress up for me. You sure you don't want anything? Nah, I'll be fine. I was gonna-- slip around TV here. OK. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Have a good night. Thanks. [from The Fly] We'll finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne. I have rescheduled. - Finish?      - No, not quite. I-- My head starts. [from The Grapes of Wrath] the one big soul that belongs to everybody. We'll watch TV if you like. - Then... Sure. - Then what, Tom? Then it don't matter. I'll be all around in the dark. I'll be everywhere, wherever you can look. - Bones -- arm -- thanks. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat... I'll be there.
