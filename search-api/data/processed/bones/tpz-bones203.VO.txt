[Police Radio Chatter] [Coughing] Holy Mother of God! Mmm! Geez! [Brennan] Booth, what do we have here? [Hodgins] Bet I know. That's... [Sniffing] lasagna... fishy rotten cat food, and vulcanized rubber. Excellent olfactory talent, Hodgins. - What happened? - Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Guy tried to beat the light. He got T-boned. - What was the semi carrying? - Aquarium sand. But that's not... No natural gas or propane? No explosion? No fire? - No corrosive chemicals. - What do you need me for? [Saroyan] You might want to prepare yourself. - Or not. - <i>[Booth] Oh, man.</i> Okay, how bad does, uh, garbage gotta stink to cover the smell of a dead body? I think the victim was a minor. Okay. Well, then if you agree, then this falls under F.B.I. jurisdiction. It's a male. Yes. An adolescent. Flatworms, necrophagous flies and beetles. Yeah, he's been garbage for about three weeks. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. Fractures to the cranium, sphenoid, and occipital regions. Neck's broken. And the femur is shattered. From the garbage truck flipping over? No. This damage is more congruent with a fall. - What do you got? - It's organic. Whatever it is, he brought it with him from the crime scene. - How much of this are you gonna need? - The whole disgusting shebang. - [Groans] Everything? - Everything. [Mumbles] He was wrapped in a shroud? Angela's analyzing the stains on the cloth... while Hodgins figures out what they're made of. No finger pads left for prints. How are we on dental records? F.B.I. 's on it. Multiple shards of leaded glass embedded in the remaining tissue. Massive contusions congruent with a swan dive onto a hard surface. And take a look at the upper spine. Weighted impact against the, uh, scapula and clavicle. - He was struck? - Yes, but not hard enough to kill. Private garbage hauler. They aren't real strict about their routes. Driver says he can't be sure where he picked the victim up. - No visible tats or track marks. - You sound surprised. Well, it's pretty obvious, Bones. It's either a junkie or a hustler. Why make that assumption? Not many kids from the suburbs end up riding in garbage trucks. - Fun factoid from the front lines. - <i>[Angela] Hey, guys.</i> Want to see something cool? I assume you're all familiar with the Shroud ofTurin. Image of Christ's face on the inside a burial cloth. Right. Booth's a good Catholic boy. - It was revealed to be a hoax. - [Booth] It wasn't a hoax. [Chuckles] Okay. Whatever you want to believe. This is no hoax. On the fabric covering John Doe's skull... there are tissue stains around the eye sockets, the nose, and the mouth. This is essentially a photo negative ofhis features. Are you saying you have enough to assemble a face? - [Computer Beeping] - I call it the Shroud of Montenegro. I used computer tomography... to create X-ray slices of the underlying facial architecture. Selective laser centering allowed me to map unimprinted areas. Skin tone and hair color were extrapolated based on Dr. Saroyan's data. I'm no expert, but he sure doesn't look like a street kid. I'm running our facial reconstruction... through the Center for Missing and Exploited Person database. - That's a lot of missing kids. - <i>[Brennan] These arejust the locals.</i> - <i>[Booth] Let's hope we don't</i> have to go national. - <i>[Saroyan] Narrow the search...</i> to street kids in the foster system. Why? Because statistically, that's where this boy comes from. It's far too early to start narrowing our focus. Runaways, street kids, foster system. Dr. Saroyan's the boss. I've autopsied a lot of dead kids... car accidents, drug overdoses, drownings. Fine. It's a broad search. Kid in a Dumpster... it's a runaway, street kid or foster system. Cam's right, Bones. Got it. Dylan Crane, 17. This is why I was appointed this job, Dr. Brennan... to streamline the process. - Honor student from a nice neighborhood in Alexandria. - Oops. He disappeared three weeks ago with his girlfriend, Kelly Morris... who is in the foster system. Good. There we go. I guess your first move is to find Kelly Morris. No, the first move is to inform the Cranes that we just found their son. - Are you positive? - We don't need to <i>identify</i> him? To make sure, I mean? I need to see my son. You understand? Mr. and Mrs. Crane, I realize this is very hard. But the reason why we asked you to come to theJeffersonian... I'm a forensic anthropologist. I don't understand the significance of that. I'm called in when a victim is too decomposed to <i>identify.</i> Oh, God. I was able to <i>identify</i> Dylan beyond the shadow of a doubt. - <i>I'm sorry.</i> - That's Dylan. - How did he die? - He fell... from a height of approximately 50 feet. Suicide? Is there any reason to believe that your son was despondent? Dylan? No. He was a smart, happy kid. Problems at school? You know, uh, spending too much time on the Internet? Anything like that? His whole life centered around this girl that he was seeing. Was this Kelly Morris? Yes. I suppose you read the missing persons report. So you know Kelly's in a foster situation? Have you seen her since Dylan disappeared? - No. - To be honest, we were hoping they ran away together. - Why would they do that? - We told Dylan to stop seeing her. Why? Dylan met her at Harbor Plaza where the street kids hang out. Dylan was getting ready to go to M.I.T. She's already dropped out ofhigh school. The life we provided didn't prepare him for a girl like Kelly. - You mean a foster child? - Bones. Whatever happened to my son, it happened because of Kelly. We're going to find her, and we're going to talk to her. Dr. Brennan, I can see that you think that we're being hard on Kelly. But my son... My son was a good kid with his whole life ahead of him. Kelly Morris's foster mother's gonna meet us in my office. Okay. She says Kelly took off a couple weeks ago with most of her belongings. [Sighs] You okay, Bones? I was a foster child. Yeah, I know. Did people always assume the worst of <i>me?</i> [Sighs] You know, I know that you hate psychology. But those people... They just lost their son. They need to blame someone. [Woman] Poor Dylan. He was a good kid. He was a good influence on Kelly. Trying to get her back into school. And he was good to Alex. Treated him just like a little brother. To the best of your knowledge, were Kelly and Dylan sexually active? Oh, I know they were. I'm afraid I caught them in Kelly's bedroom. And I had to forbid Kelly to bring Dylan into the house after that. - Why? - It's the rules. They're underage, and Kelly's a ward of the state. And I knew that it might force Dylan and Kelly to find other places to be together. You know, to feed into their own, uh, Romeo and Juliet fantasy. But Alex lives in the house, too, and he's only 12. - Kelly and her brother, are they close? - Very close. Their parents were killed in a hotel fire four years ago. They had no family. They were put into the system. I've had them for a little over a year. That's a pretty good run for a foster kid... especially a brother and a sister who want to be together. Yes. What? I'm not certain how much longer I can keep the both of them. I have diabetes. And I don't have the energy that I used to. And Kelly is a real handful. I've asked Children's Services to look for alternatives. - Did Kelly know? - Yes. I told her. [Boy] Did they find Kelly or not? No, Alex. But they found Dylan. Is he all right? I'm-I'm afraid not. Dylan is dead. Do you know where Kelly is, Alex? - No. - Kelly could be in danger. I don't know where she is. She hasn't called me or anything. Do you think she's dead too? No. Mm-mmm. You know, I'm gonna find your sister... and I'm gonna bring her back here to you. Really? Mmm, absolutely. This is the F.B.I., buddy. Were you lying to the boy? Do you really think Kelly Morris is still alive? - I don't know. - You don't know if she's alive? I don't know if I was lying. I really don't have a read on the sister yet. I mean, was she a bad guy? Was she a victim? Do you have a read on Dylan Crane? Oh, yeah. He had that whole adolescent savior complex thing going on big time. - Savior complex? - Yeah, teenage boys love nothing more... than the idea of saving the damsel in distress. - How do you know? - Well, 'cause I was, you know... I was a teenage boy. Hey. D.N.A. from the tissue under the victim's fingernail. Female. And there's nail polish in the gouges on his arm. It wasn't necessarily from the murder. They were sexually active. She might've scratched him. Nope. Hodgins also found oxidized iron in the scratches. - Oxidized iron. What's that? - [Saroyan, Brennan] Rust. - Why didn't you just say rust? - Well, <i>she</i> said it. The same oxidized iron found on the victim's upper back and shoulder. Probably left behind by the weapon that struck him. - So he was hit with what, a rusty pipe? - That's a reasonable assumption. Oh, so Dylan tells the girlfriend they're breaking up. - She whacks him across the carotid with a pipe. - Pushes him out the window. - Exactly. - What? What's with the stink eye? It's just a theory. There was cheap nail polish in the box of Kelly's belongings. You should see if there's a match. Find some hair. Match the D.N.A. on that. - Then get started on the, uh, murder weapon. - Yeah. Where you going? I thought before we arrest Kelly Morris for murder... based solely on the fact that she's a foster kid... we might want to find the place where Dylan Crane actually died. Point of fact, the pipe, if that's even what it was, was not the murder weapon. The evidence, if anybody cares, shows that Dylan Crane died from a fall. [Whistles] No compression fractures to the ulna or phalanges. So his arms weren't outstretched or across his face. Which means he wasn't bracing for impact. Suggesting he was unconscious before he went out the window. Perhaps from being struck by the rusty pipe? - [Grunts] Don't you start. - Start what? - We don't know what he was struck with yet. - I analyzed the impact damage... and the weapon was a cylinder approximately two inches in diameter. That, plus the oxidation residue, suggests, in the vernacular, a rusty pipe. Good. If you tell me that, I get it. It's empirical, not guesswork. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Romeo and Juliet, act 2, scene 2... the quote considered to most aptly describe the central conflict of the play... which I totally do not understand. The flower in Dylan's hand was a <i>Rosea calyx...</i> a rosebud. You do <i>not</i> smell like a rose. I've been sifting through two tons of garbage, which you should ask me about. Ask what exactly? Poultry skin loaded with garlic and chives, red beets... empty imported vodka bottles, and traces of osetra fish eggs. Put 'em together and where are we? Anyone? Booth should check the garbage truck route for a Russian restaurant. - <i>[Vehicles Passing]</i> - Whoa, okay. Horrible area. But on the upside, only one Russian restaurant and no Starbucks. You know, no one we've talked to has recognized either Kelly or Dylan. - Hey, we could ask them. - Why? Because they share the same unique sociocultural identifiers as Kelly Morris. - You mean like teenagers? - Yeah, exactly. No, you know what? They will melt away before we get half a sentence out. - Right. You just watch. - Okay. But, hey, you know, what do I know? - I've only been working the streets my whole career. - <i>Excuse me?</i> Excuse me? Hello. - Hi. I'm an anthropologist. I'm not a cop. - That's most definitely a cop. Thank you. See? They're very cooperative, aren't they? - Booth, please... - There they go. Oh, excuse me. Wait, wait, wait. Will you just take a look at these pictures and tell me if you recognize anyone? Give me five bucks, and I'll tell you. - Five bucks. - Booth, please. Here you go. So who is it? It's his sister. But hold it this way, right? 'Cause the only time anyone ever sees his sister is on her back. Yeah. I'm assuming this isn't your sister? - No, it is! - Okay, I'd like my money back. [Booth] Well, there they go. Bye. Mm-hmm. That really worked, now, didn't it, huh? Great. They just took my money for nothing. Well, you know, that's because they're exploited, you know, misunderstood. [Booth] Oh, you gotta be kidding me, huh? - I mean, they could at least wait until my back is turned, right? - What? - <i>F.B.I. Hands in the air.</i> - Cops! There's no problem here! No problem at all. Katie! I'll cover you. Go see what they're dealing, Bones. I hate this part where you stand with a gun and I have to do the looking. Bones, I got you covered. Just go. What are you selling? What do they got there, Bones? What do you got, huh? Ibuprofen, uh, multivitamin. I think these are sandwiches. And condoms. [Man] Franny and I have been doing this for years. [Franny] Sandwiches, clothing, vitamins. Some basic hygiene supplies for homeless kids. - You must be really embarrassed. - Hey, you know what? It was suspicious behavior, all right? And besides, it's not like they're... Are you social workers? - Nope. - They aren't social workers. - They're good Samaritans. - Well, I apologized, okay? Do you know how long it takes to gain trust around here? Make a scene like this, and these kids won't talk to us for weeks. Oh, good. Maybe you could do us a favor in return. Show him the picture. We're looking for someone. A girl. - Dylan and Kelly. - Yeah. That's right. - We haven't seen 'em around here in a couple of weeks. - Dylan is dead. We found him in a garbage truck that services this area. - My God. What happened? - That's what we're trying to figure out. Warehouse. Yep. Come with us. - What is this place? - A squat. Every one of these old factories houses junkies and squatters. Yeah, and kids with nowhere else to go. What'd this building used to be? - Plumbing supply, I think. - Pipes. Bones. Dylan, right? It's obviously a kind of shrine. It's something the kids do for each other when somebody dies. Still could be traces of Dylan's blood on the concrete. I'll call the crime scene unit. - Tell them to start on the fifth floor. - Why? Because the injuries show that's how far he fell. - <i>[Glass Shatters]</i> - [Boy Grunts] Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! That's Dylan's school jacket! We're not gonna hurt you! [Groans] Okay. I hurt you a little bit... but that's only because you ran. You can't ask me nothing without a social worker present. I know my rights. I'm not questioning you. We're just... We're talking, okay? Here, want some gum? Yeah, like that's gonna make me trust you. You know, I'm just asking your name. - <i>[Man] Sergeant Roberts is up top.</i> - "C." - Does that stand for anything? - Carter. I'm not saying if that's my first or my last name. - Why'd you run? - Because this lady was chasing me. - Because you ran. - Yeah. It's a brain twister. You know, that sweatshirt you're wearing belongs to a kid by the name of Dylan Crane. - Never heard of him. - Where'd you get it? I'm done with the hoodie. You guys can have it. What's with the names on the inside of your forearm there? What does that mean? Guys I killed. It's a list of foster homes. Ones that threw him out. Sometimes getting thrown out's the best... It's the best thing that can happen. I know. You were in the system? Booth, the sunglasses? They're the same ones that Dylan was wearing in the photograph. These, huh? Top of the line. How can you afford these? You don't want to know. Can I go now? No. Child Services is on the way. I tell you something, you let me go? - Try me. - You want to know what happened to Dylan and Kelly? Check out the sandwich pervs. Fran Duncan's clean. Great record in the community. But Kevin Duncan? The kid got it right. I mean, he's a perv. Inside three times on "solicitation of minor" charges. - Boys or girls? - Girls. He's a traditionalist. [Sighs] So, he went after Kelly. The white knight from the suburbs steps in, gets conked with a pipe... - and tossed out the window. - And Kelly goes into hiding. Unless he got her too. So what do you want to do next? Hmm. That's up to Cam, isn't it? No, Bones, I asked you. What do you want to do? I think... I think we shouldn't close off any avenue of investigation. We stay on all the evidence and see where it leads us. Like we did before Cam. Okay. Do you have a list like Carter? Of foster families that didn't work out? Yeah. We all did. - I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe. - Oh. You know, they say with foster kids, they're really hard on themselves. They? Yeah, experts, psychologists, like that. Apparently, foster kids feel so alone in this mean world... they lose that knack of trusting other people. You mean at work? Uh, everywhere. You know, weight of the world. It's... It's profound. They say that they have a hard time letting themselves off the hook. They... They grow up with control issues. - Are you telling me something, Booth? - <i>No.</i> I'm just saying it's something to keep in consideration when we catch up with Kelly Morris. Okay. If you decide to take some other wisdom out of it, none of my business. How Cam and I get along is none of your business. Yeah, right. Which I just said. Said just then... None of my business. [Computer Beeping] Is there anything I can do? Hey, this schematic is great, Angela. All the pipes are numbered and located. Meanwhile, I have hundreds of rust samples... and I've covered, mmm, maybe a quarter of the crime scene. - [Groans] - Yeah. On the good side, that is definitely the window Dylan Crane exited as he fell. Leaded glass is a match. It's a strange place for two people in love to end up. What? A forensics lab? No. A squat in an abandoned pipe factory. Right. Yes. Right. What were <i>you</i> talking about? - Just Cam and Booth, you know, of course. - Oh, yeah. - Given their... their history. - Mmm. Tension, party of two. Great. Great. [Groans] Okay. All my mistakes were made before I met Fran. Then I fell in love. Love changes everything. - Your wife know about these mistakes? - Of course. We have no secrets. I got counseling. I'm still in counseling. I'm out there on the street making amends every day. Passing out sandwiches and aspirin and condoms to street kids? Yeah. I have no direct contact with the kids. Fran does. I make the sandwiches. I drive. Insure my wife's safety. That's a tough part of town. And your past is all in the past? No. That's with me every day. Yeah. Miranda Tyler, Susan Price, Laura Costello. All these girls say that you traded sandwiches for sex in the past six months. Well, they're street kids. They lie. - Yeah. - <i>These girls came on to me.</i> And they wanted money. When I rejected them, they got angry. We catch up to Kelly Morris, is she gonna say the same thing? Hairbrush from Kelly's room provided her D.N.A. The nail polish from her room also matches... the nail polish we found in the scratch marks on the victim's arm. It doesn't mean she pushed him out that window. lfhe finds it, and it matches the rust found in the scratch marks... - then we can tie Kelly to the weapon. - Oh, young love. You pour your soul out to some pimple-faced jock... with a great body and the emotional maturity of an 11 -year-old... only to get your heart broken in the back of a red Camaro. - Remember that first slow dance? - Oh, God. - Some horrible power ballad. - Oh, that special boy with a pipe in his pocket. Oh, God. Lewis Cole. Mmm. He was a drummer. He had this hair. It was... Wait. Excuse me? Marching to the beat of a different drummer here. I'd like Hodgins to <i>identify</i> the species of rose found in Dylan Crane's hand. - What can that possibly tell us? - I won't know until he identifies it. I'd prefer he keep looking for the pipe. It could have Kevin Dylan's D.N.A. on it. Which will prove only that Kevin Duncan struck Dylan, not that he killed him. - I want Hodgins on that rose. - It's my call. No. [Sighs] I can't work like this. Are you telling me I should start looking for your replacement? Dr. Saroyan, I don't want to be overly dramatic or anything. But if you lose Brennan, you lose us all. - Really? - Really. And Booth too. In the interests of this investigation, I'm going to defer to you, Dr. Brennan. - Thank you. - Thank you. But I will start the search for your replacement. - <i>[Man] Agent Booth?</i> - Yeah? This young man says he has information he won't tell anyone but you. All right. Thanks, I got it. Come on in, Alex. Have a seat. [Sighs] - You want a Coke or anything? - No. - You a big shot? - [Scoffs] Uh, yeah. Look at that, huh? Special Agent <i>in Charge</i> Seeley Booth. - So how'd you get here? - Bus. - Kelly called me on the phone. - What'd she say? That she's okay. And that we'll be together... soon. Did she say where she was? Did she know about Dylan? About being dead? Yeah. She couldn't stop crying about it. She had to hang up. I think she's lying. I think she's never coming back. [Sniffles] Hey, it's okay, Alex. All right? Everything's gonna be okay. [Crying] I think I'm all alone now. No. Hey, look. Hey, man, you're never gonna be alone, okay? All right, we know for certain that Kelly is alive. And I promise. We're gonna find your sister. Okay? All right. Let's get out of here. I'll give you a ride home. - I got your call. - It was urgent. Why didn't you answer? I was busy. What's so important? - Kevin Duncan. - Single gunshot wound to the chest. You're just in time for the autopsy. Feeling queasy, Zack? I'm not used to bodies looking so much like actual human beings. [Saw Whirring] - <i>[Bone Cracking]</i> - [Groans] Since this man was just killed and there's plenty of flesh... how is my presence beneficial? [Bone Cracking] The number six rib. The bullet passed through his vital organs and lodged in the rear curvature. Get it out. So, you're thinking the perv kills Romeo and Juliet kills the pervert. Street-smart kid like Kelly Morris would have no trouble getting a gun. Mm-hmm. Booth, if Dr. Brennan were to quit... - What? - If she were to leave theJeffersonian... Well, the squints would flee this institution like the French army. - And you? - Well, I do as I'm ordered. [Scoffs] No, you don't, Seeley. Okay, here we go. What's going on, Camille? What if I fired her? What would you do? I'm with Bones, Cam. All the way. Don't doubt it for a second. Meet the English Alba Rose. Climbing varietal. Nonexistent in the United States. Some say it was the rose by any other name Shakespeare wrote about. And we give a rat's ass because? It's what Dylan Crane was clutching in his cold, dead hand. So, what? He was killed by Hamlet? Wrong play. It's more likely he paid a visit to the rose wing of the United States Botanic Garden. When it comes to bugs, slime, crud, and compost, you're the man. - [Chuckles] - <i>Look, Cam.</i> Maybe you just got off on the wrong foot with this case with Brennan... because, uh, she was a foster kid. Oh. [Sighs] Why didn't she tell me? She doesn't do that. [Clears Throat] Excuse me. Oh, by the way, I didn't just tell you that. [Hodgins] United States Botanic Garden falls under the supervision... - of the Architect of the Capitol. - I really don't care. The architect is also responsible... for maintaining the grounds of the United States Capitol. You seen either of these two kids? It's open every day of the year to the citizens of these United States. Which way to the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> roses? It's over there where Kelly Morris is standing. Oh, Bones was right. Okay, go distract her. - Well, hey. Why me? - Well, because apparently I look like a cop. - What do I look like? - What are you? My straight man? Go. Hey. The United States Botanic Garden falls under... the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. - Get away from me, perv. - Hello, Kelly. F.B.I. Not a perv. It's okay. It's okay. We're just here to help. Not gonna hurt you. Just gotta talk about what happened to Dylan. Dylan's dead. Were you there when Dylan died? Was I there? Who do you think killed him? - Why'd you kill Dylan, Kelly? - Agent Booth. She already admitted to the murder, Ms. Child. Actually, I believe she asked "Who do you think killed him?" - It's an ambiguous question. - Oh, I killed him. I did it. Because he broke a promise to me. The promise to stay with you? He tossed me a couple hundred bucks and told me he was going to college... that we couldn't see each other anymore. - What'd you do? - I pushed him out a window. It was kind of an accident, right? What do you call it? A crime of passion? - You pushed him out the window? - Yes. And he was conscious at the time? Yeah. He screamed, okay? - What then? - I ran away. No. Kelly, you didn't. You went down to the alley, and you wrapped Dylan in linen. And then you put a rose from the Botanic Garden in his hand. The <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> rose. You know, it's a strange thing to do right after you murder someone. Well, I'm pretty screwed up. Didn't you hear? Someone shot Kevin Duncan. - <i>He's dead.</i> - The sandwich guy? We were thinking that the two deaths were connected. [Sighs] Fine. Yeah, I killed him too. - She killed him too. - I'd prefer that we not pursue this line of questioning. [Register Beeping] - Well, she confessed. - She got it wrong. She forgot about the pipe. - She said they fought. - She's lying. [Sighs] You know, I'm just trying to think of a situation so bad... where a girl would confess to murder to try and get out of it. - Agent Booth. Dr. Brennan. - Mrs. Duncan. You want to sit down? Have a cup of coffee? No, thank you. I'm sorry for your loss. - Did Kelly Morris kill Dylan? - Well, she confessed. And now you think she killed my husband as well? It's very possible. I'd believe that before I believed she killed Dylan. Kelly shouldn't take the blame. You'll find one bullet missing. You're confessing to your husband's murder? He used me to get close to young girls. I don't know how many through the years. Frances Duncan, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... Thank you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be... Pick up the gun. Ballistics confirm that the bullet that killed Kevin Duncan came from Fran Duncan's gun. - Case closed? - On Kevin Duncan, definitely. Since Kelly Morris has confessed... - No. She didn't do it. - What evidence do you have of that? How about this? Specimen 268... "right corner of the room" schematic. - You are good. - Oh, you have no idea. Are you having a moment? Well, how does finding the pipe prove that Kelly Morris is lying? How does her confession not include the murder weapon? Now for the last time, the pipe is not the murder weapon. Dylan Crane died from a 50-foot fall. Can you run the scenario through your magic holographic crystal ball thingy? Too many variables. But I have another idea. Okay. Booth, you're Dylan Crane. - Okay, you know what? I'm out the door. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Cam? - Kelly Morris. Right. - Okay, I feel stupid. - Okay, you two. You are young. You are in love. You're about to break up. But this is very tragic. It's very emotionally fraught. Kelly Morris says she argued with Dylan and pushed him out the window. She pushed him, then tried to save him by grabbing his arm? That would explain the fingernail polish and the scratch. But... Not the oxidized iron. Kelly would've had to strike him with the pipe from behind... and then drive him through the glass. But she said that they were arguing face-to-face. - <i>He would've seen her coming.</i> - <i>That means there had to be a third person.</i> Someone who snuck up behind him. - Guys, I need a Kevin Duncan. - I'll do it. Kelly already called me a perv, so I have my motivation. So Kevin strikes Dylan with the pipe. - Careful. - Which moves him forward. Kelly grabs the pipe away from him. But Dylan is losing consciousness. He didn't have to throw Dylan out the window. He could've simply pushed him. - Easy. - Kelly grabs his arm. - <i>[Brennan] To save him.</i> - Which would put fingernails and rust in the wound. But she can't hold him, and he falls. [Glass Shatters] - Oh! - Well, that theory explains the physical evidence. Except why would Kelly confess to murder to protect Kevin Duncan? - She's afraid of him. - But she knows he's dead. Guys, there's only two people in this world... that Kelly Morris would cover for. One of them went out that window. - We know you didn't kill Dylan. - I did too. Kelly, I don't want you to admit to anything more. No. You didn't. We can prove there was a third person there... the third person that hit Dylan with a pipe... and... when you took away the pipe... pushed him through the glass. No, it was just me. I hit him with the pipe. I pushed him through the glass. - No. You grabbed his arm. You tried to save him. - No. Dylan made you feel like you weren't alone in this world, right? He was sweet to you. He took so much weight off your shoulders. He was good to Alex. And when Dylan said that you'd be together always, you believed him. Yes. Yes, I believed him. And when Suzanne couldn't take care of both you and Alex... you had an idea. Run away with Dylan. Maybe Suzanne will keep Alex... and everybody would be happy. Dylan loved me. I know. But I didn't tell Alex. He just... [Sniffles] He just... He thought that Dylan was trying to take me away from him forever. I... I did it all wrong. It's not... It's not Alex's fault. It's my fault. [Crying] Kelly, you're 15 years old. This is not your fault. The weight of the world is not on your shoulders. And we can't let you pay for what Alex did. - [Sniffles] - <i># [Pop Ballad]</i> # [Continues] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't tell them. They just... They just knew. It's okay. [Sniffles] Sorry about Dylan. # [Continues] # [Continues] # [Fades] You were right about the pipe. You were right about the rose. Could I sit for a moment? I wish you'd eat some of these fries. Save me from myself. They're really good with garlic mayonnaise. - We have a problem. - Uh-huh. - Do you see a solution? - It's not completely my fault. I was a foster child. And apparently... Booth says that... Booth says that I have... Well, something about control issues and the weight of the world. [Chuckles] That sounds like Booth. I think he meant that... if I'm going to share responsibility for these cases... I'm going to have to learn to stop controlling everything too. Does that make sense? Psychology's not... I really... I really hate psychology. Not everyone's brain works as fast as yours. I have to mull sometimes. A-Are you familiar with that concept? Yes. I just always thought it was a waste of time. [Chuckles] I'm in charge. But out of respect for you, I could extend... - Did you ever play Monopoly? - No. Well, they have this thing called a"get out of jail free" card. Think of it as a free pass to <i>defy</i> me. No explanation needed. No recriminations. No repercussions. Well, how... How many would I get? - One a week. - Five per case. Three per week. Booth told you I was a foster kid, didn't he? Okay, yes, he did, but he did it with a good heart. And I'd really appreciate it if you didn't let him know. Please. He's gonna know that you told me the second he sees us together. It's true. He's awful like that. He reads people the way that you read pathology reports or I read bones. Oh, God, I know. I hate him. Well, I don't really. I know. Me either. - I will take you up on this. - Please help me.
