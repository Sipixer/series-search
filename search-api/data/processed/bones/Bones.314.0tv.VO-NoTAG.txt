So let's hear it for the beautiful and persistent Emma Von Helberg! All right, up next, another checker box regular. The smooth and smoky voice of Chris Calabasa. Should've left that song in the shower. Couldn't listen to you butcher it again. All right, Chris. Bastard took my tune. Play "Piano Man." That's original. Every bone appears to be broken. Bless you. Thank you. Pelvic fragments suggest it's a male. - Are you okay? - Thank you, fine. Just... particles from the cut grass are causing his mast cells to release inflammatory mediators. - It's just allergies, Bones. - Yeah, that's what I said. Given the degree of decomp, he's been dead a couple of weeks. Body dump? Lividity's indeterminate. How does a former sniper have a grass allergy? I mean, wouldn't a sneeze give away your position? Bones, okay, I worked in the desert it was sand, not grass. It's the crunching that got my attention. Well, did you see the body before it crunched? It's not my fault. You know, Johnson grass is eight feet high and dense. It's like driving in the dark. You must've been driving fast. I had an internet date. I wanted to get home to shower. She's probably still waiting for me at the Falafel place. You know, Johnson grass lets off a ton of pollen, man. Your eyes could swell up. If your throat closes... Allergies, okay? I'm fine. You didn't by any chance see a head, did you? - The head's missing? - I don't see it or any skull fragments. Sorry. Well, I've got some brain matter here, so he had to have a head at some point. Found it. Oh, my date's not gonna believe this. The blade must've severed just below the C-5 vertebra and the force of the impact propelled the head into the grille. So, presumably, he was killed, decapitated and mulched. Could it get any worse for this guy? Bones Season 3 Episode 14 The Wannabe in the Weeds" Transcript: <i>swsub.com</i> Sync: <i>ShalimarFox</i> Subtitle: <i>AÂ²S Team</i> --==All-about-Subs.fr==-- The bones are dense with a high degree of robusticity. That's consistent with his musculature. The guy was built. He was probably an athlete. I bet he was hot. Yeah, well, now he's really not. I think he had a cold. Looks like it was a pretty bad one. No, I found traces of tea and honey in his stomach and the remains of a throat lozenge. Victim's watch. It's totally cool. Measures heart rate, calories burned, speed, distance. Jock-I rest my case. It's bad enough going to the gym without getting yelled at by a watch. My regime is easily completed in my apartment. Treadmill for 30 minutes, a hundred sit-ups, push-ups and leg lifts and 20 minutes of free weights. I'm deceptively strong. I'm deceived. Odontology got a match. Tommy Sour. He was reported missing two weeks ago. I hear someone in there. Hey, break down the door. It hurts my shoulder when I break down the door. What is that annoying noise? You don't just walk in... I'm sorry, I had my earplugs in. - Can I help you with something? - Fbi. Special Agent Booth. This here is dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian. - You reported Tommy Sour missing? - Yeah. A couple weeks ago. He lives in the unit next door. Can we come in? Excuse the mess. I have a show in a month. You're influenced by the neo-expressionists. No, don't even look at that. That is crap. There it goes again. I can't focus. That alarm has been beeping every two minutes ever since Tommy went missing. - Yeah, you know what? That is annoying. - Yes. It's why I've got the earplugs. The cops showed up, I asked them to unplug it. They didn't. - Maybe you guys could. - Mr. Matthews, Tommy Sour is dead. Oh, God. Before he went missing, was there anything unusual about his behavior? I didn't know him all that well. You reported him missing Yeah, well, his mail started piling up on his front door, and then that damn alarm clock... it's driving me crazy. This sculpture is very impressive. Yeah, it's from my pre-alarm clock period. What about strangers? Any new faces around here? Oh, wait, yeah. Fat Pam. - Excuse me? - She was one of Tommy's clients. I thought you didn't know him that well? Well, he was my neighbor. If we took the garbage out, we saw each other, we'd talk a little bit. You know what it's like. Anyway, Tommy was Fat Pam's trainer at, Valera Wellness. - Must you call her "fat" Pam? - That's what he called her. It's not like Tommy was the nicest guy who ever lived. She wasn't really all that fat even. You mean overweight. Fat is a deposit found beneath the skin. It consists of lipids. Okay, sure. Pam just wasn't one of those fitness robots that Tommy would spend his time with. She started following Tommy home from the gym. And she'd sit out on the curb and watch his place. And then about a month ago, she showed up middle of the night, started banging on his door. Oh, was she angry? She was wearing a teddy and heels, so I'm thinking "angry" wasn't her prime emotion. You're implying that she was sexually stimulated. So, were they... you know... did they...? Did they have sexual intercourse? If they did, it was through a locked door. So... no? - Very good, Bones. OK, let's go. - Why are you clapping? Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Maybe you could go turn the alarm off or just shoot it. C-5 just under the hyoid. Seems to be shaved on its front. Shaved? Yes, like with a cheese slicer. Must mean someone slit his throat. This doesn't look like it was caused by a knife. There are no serrations, even microscopic. What, then? A cheese slicer seems illogical under the circumstances. I'll start looking for alternatives. These people are just trying to get healthy, Bones. That's all. There is a fine line between health and vanity. Well, this obsession with physical perfection clouds a society's moral vision. You are ogling that woman. - What? No, I'm not. I'm just... - Yes, you are. I'm-I'm just... admiring her routine. Hi, I'm the wellness center's manager, Dr. Jason. I understand you're with the FBI. Special Agent booth. This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan. We're here about Tommy Sour. - He in trouble? - He's dead. That explains why he's not returning my calls. You don't seem too upset about that. Tommy was my most popular trainer. Since he disappeared, I've had to deal with a lot of angry clients. You're with the FBI, that means Tommy was murdered? Look, you wouldn't happen to know a woman, a client... of his, Pam? Some people referred to her as Fat Pam. I know who you mean. Pam Nunan. She booked two-hour sessions, paid in cash. Perfect client until... Until? Until she fell in love with Tommy. Then she started to freak him out. - How so? - Said she was "too handsy." She'd rub up against him, even invited him on a Caribbean cruise. Would you happen to have Ms. Nunan's address? Sure. - Booth. - Yeah? That does not help the investigation. He's such a cutie, isn't he? Tommy is such a wonderful person, big heart and so devoted. You brought a photo album? You said you wanted to talk about Tommy, I figured you'd like to see pictures. Those pictures are... they... they are taken from quite a distance, Pam. He's so shy. It's one of the things I love about him. We understand that Tommy was your personal trainer. He was so much more than that. Before I met tommy, I was so down on myself. But, Tommy... He's such a sweetheart. Does Tommy share your affection? Why do you ask it like that? Because I don't look like a scarecrow? Like her? Hey. Wha... what are you coming after me for? Do-do I look like a scarecrow? Well, you... I think you look good. Thank you. Like Tommy, you see me for who I really am, not scrawny. What...? I am not scrawny. My body mass index is well within normal limits. Could we talk about Tommy, please? If he didn't love me, why would he want to marry me? Marry you? He was gonna marry you? Tommy's my life. And I'm his. Whatever you think he's done, I know he didn't do it. We're not worried about what he did. It's what you might have done. Tommy is dead. She has body image issues, which are not congruent with her actual appearance. She's someone who's slightly large, who believes she's a very large woman who can convince people she's only slightly large. And the way people treat her convinces her that she's right. That's interesting. See, you're only pretending it's intesting. It means very little to you. That's true. You have an irrational prejudice against psychology, probably because of emotions that are too complicated for you to deal with. And I poke and I prod at them, which makes them... real... and painful. And yet I feel no pain, just a sort of... disinterest. So why don't you take your powers of observation... focus them on her. All right. She's sorting her trail mix. - Does that mean something? - She's nervous. She's trying to control a situation that's out of her control. Or she's just bored; she's been waiting almost an hour. Sorry to have kept you waiting. I didn't kill Tommy; I loved him. What's this? I got bored. Been here over an hour. I believe that you loved Tommy. Thank you, Agent Booth, I did. But I don't believe that he loved you back. `Cause I'm not anorexic? - Ms. Nunan... - Call me Pam. Pam... you were stalking him, and he was avoiding you. If he didn't love me, why would he give me this for Christmas? "P-A-M." Do you know what that spells? - "Pam." - That's right. What did you give him before he gave you that bracelet? Ah... excellent question. - Why does that matter? - Just curious. A $1,000 gift certificate to the music center. He loved music. A thousand dollars. That's generous. A way to obligate him, try and force an emotional connection. It's extremely passive-aggressive. So do you think she killed him? Well... there's no question that she's deluded. I mean, if she truly believed that he was gonna marry her, then she was setting herself up for a tragic ending. Tragic? Well, one way to ensure that he didn't leave her... would be to kill him. Tommy had a beautiful voice. He dreamed of being a professional singer, and I wanted to support him. I did everything for him. He was mine. Tommy was mine, no matter what anyone thought. When did you find him? Last night, he had been dead for two weeks. I've been in Florida. Left last month; just got back two days ago. I was with mom and daddy planning the wedding. The wedding with Tommy. Of course, silly. I'm just gonna need you to, write down your parents'number in Florida so I can confirm your whereabouts. Thanks. Who's gonna love me now? I'm sorry. - No, no, no, don't touch her. - Why? Thank you, Agent Booth. The pathology is clear she's possessive and immoral. Her emotional connections are forged through manipulation and delusion. Once a connection that tenuous breaks... So she killed Tommy Sour? I can't say that, of course, but... she is a dangerous person. Thank you. Well... her story checks out. She was in Florida when he was killed. Her parents are devastated that their future son-in-law, who they never met, will no longer be her love monkey. Well, Dr. Sweets still thinks that she's a killer. Dangerous. - I think she's dangerous. - I agree. Thank you, Agent Booth. All those gifts and taking pictures from a distance and showing up in the middle of the night in... a nightie it's all very dangerous. Mocking will not change my opinion. I've been mocked many, many times before. That... came out wrong. Yeah, that's great, Sweets. Appreciate your help, but you know what, she has an alibi. See ya. Well... just be cautious of her, okay? - She's not stable. - Great. Thank you. Oh. And remember, our session on tuesday is at 4:00. Trust exercises. You're going to be there. See ya. I got your page. Vic's tox report just came back. There were trace amounts of THC in his bloodstream. That's why you paged me, because our victim smoked marijuana? No. Check out the monitor. His blood was infected with a bacterium. E. Coli, and given the concentration in his blood, I'd say the infection occurred within hours of his death. - What was the source? - I'm getting there. The CDC tracks all E. Coli outbreaks, and apparently, the last E. Coli ground zero was in Virginia at the checker box restaurant in Alexandria. The culprit: tainted raw honey the same kind I found in Tommy Sour's stomach. Finally! I mean, one more show tune, and I was gonna start shooting. He has excellent projection. I heard him while I was parking. Yeah. Okay, I talked to some of the patrons here. Open Mike night is every monday and tuesday. Actually, some of these people think this stuff is good. What's open Mike Night? It's, you know, cabaret meets karaoke you know, singers who want to get discovered. Will you please be quiet? Based on the E. Coli in Tommy's blood, he definitely was here shortly before he was killed. Pammy said he was musical. Gotta find my corner This guy is not bad. - You're kidding me. - No. I love his enthusiasm. Dude. Do I need to get the manager? Dude, actually, you know what, that would be great. Why don't you... point him out to us? Up next, the smooth and smoky Chris Calabasa. Excuse me? Agent Booth, FBI. Oh, come on, I told you guys everything I know. I bought the raw honey from a company out of Maryland. I gave the CDC guy the bill of sale and the remaining honey - What else you want from me? - No. We're not here about the E. Coli. We need to speak with you about Tommy Sour. We believe he was murdered. Murdered? Were you friends? Well, he was good for business, talented. Showed up at every open mike night since day one. When I didn't see him around, I figured... he got a paying gig, you know? Anything unusual about his final performance? No. Everybody loved him, like always. Everybody thinks they're the next Kelly Clarkson. - Yeah, you got that right. - Who's Kelly Clarkson? American Idol, "because of you." Because of me? Never mind, okay? Just stay here, not up there. So, did he have any enemies? Yeah. You're listening to him right now. There was a talent scout here that night. Tommy stole his song. Chris had to default to "Piano Man." That hurts! When Chris finished singing, he pulled Tommy aside, and they started shoving each other. I told them to take it outside. They disappeared into the parking lot. Then what? I don't know. I never saw Tommy again. Oh, love is lovelier the second time around... Tommy Sour was a jerk. He'd fill the joint with his fitness groupies who'd hoot and holler even when he sang off-key, they'd talk through the other acts. You know what that does to a singer's self-esteem? I imagine it'd be quite disheartening given your need for acclaim. - Bones... - What? It's a primal human need, the foundation for royalty... You know, you're just gonna confuse him. Go on. Tommy thought he was gonna make it big. He showed me a check he wrote for a million bucks, said he'd be cashing it by Christmas. Well, was he any good? Last month he had some dude videotape his set. It's up on his MySpace page you can check it for yourself. This guy is good. Like a friendly home Thank you, Paula. Can we just... focus here? So, the night Tommy was killed, the two of you got into an argument over a song? Not just a song, my song. "Far away" by Nickelback. Tommy knew that I was saving that for scout night. - That make you a little angry? - I didn't kill the guy. We went outside, I vented, and Tommy took off. That was it you just said, "good-bye, see you later"? I came back inside... I wanted to introduce myself to the talent scout. He's back again, you can ask him yourself. Yeah, you know what? I think I will. Stay here. Is this guy a star, or what? Oh, love's more comfortable You his agent? No, I'm just a fan. You know, a fan of the music. - So, what label are you with? - I'm an independent. Ah, you know, me and my roommate, we had a band in college. We weren't half bad. I mean, all the guys, they'd sit in the front there. What are you doing all the way in the back? - What's it to you? - What are you drinking? Excuse me. Hey! What the hell is this, doodles? Everything OK here? What do you say we step outside? Come on. I want to know why you're impersonating a talent scout. I don't know what you're talk... answer the question, or I'll arrest you right now for fraud. - But I... - Wait a second, I get it. You two are working together. You knew that if there was a talent scout in the audience, more singers would show up at Open Mike Night. You sell more booze, you make more money. I-I just started the rumor. I asked Mitch to wear a suit, take some notes. I didn't do anything wrong it was just a job. Just a job, right? Give Tommy the idea that he was gonna get his own contract. - I didn't hurt anybody. - You lied to them. You exploited their need for attention that's cruel. - I am not going down for your crap. - I get it. Tommy figures it all out, there's an argument, it escalates, he confronts you. No. No. I swear it. Tommy knew nothing about Mitch; no one did. You pull this scam again, and I swear I'll arrest both of you for conspiracy, fraud and misrepresentation, you got me? Yes. Sir. Come on. And don't even think about leaving town, 'cause both of you are under investigation for murder. They are? No, I just don't like them. - How's it coming, Zack? - I'm still looking. The shaving was wafer thin and conformed to the curvature of the... I need the bones, man. As do I, Hodgins. I need to swab the ligature furrows for elemental analysis... Did you know that I sang, too? - What? - As a child. You? My parents felt that singing lessons would help integrate me socially. - Really? - Yes. I was quite good. I received acclaim and a new stature amongst the parents of my peers. What about your actual peers? My mother said they were jealous and not to worry about it. Jealous of your singing? Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm trying, Zack, but I just... I can't see it. That was... great. That was... great. Thank you. I should get back to work now. Listen, Pavarotti, I need the C-5 vertebra, the hyoid and the temporal bone. We need a weapon. And by ID'ing the particulates in the wounds, I can give you more to go on. Thanks for the concert. Is there something you need? No. Oh, no, I'm-I'm just doing my... just... Thanks. I get it when a college kid wants to be a rock star, but half of those singers were over 30. Do they really think they're going to be famous? The need to stand out from the crowd is innate. It's obnoxious. You were the best sniper when you were in the army. I was just doing my job. OK? Well. And that set you apart from the others. Bones, we're talking about singing some nightmarish broadway songs. No, it doesn't matter. Whoever is best has the status and power. And becomes a superior mate. Yeah, I tell you, some of those people are not gonna be mating, that's for sure. But they will have the power and prestige. You enjoy it because you are a superb agent. - You think? - Yeah, of course. Since I am the best in my field, it would be self-destructive for me to work with someone who's beneath me. Oh. Okay, well, that's good. 'Cause, you know, I have to be honest, here... sometimes I think that you feel that you're better than me. - Objectively I'm more intelligent... - There you go. ... In certain areas. And in others, I understand my limitations and I... admire your expertise. You admire me? In certain areas of expertise. Well, I admire your expertise. You know, the whole science thing. Thank you. I'm an author, too. I know. Best selling and that also gives me elevated status. Here comes the ego. No, I'm not saying that society is correct to elevate me. I'm not saying that i deserve the elevation. I'm just saying that it occurs. Society should elevate scholars and teachers, not actors and athletes. Yeah, what about cops? Very important. Yeah, this is Agent Booth. It's Pam... Pam Nunan. How can I help you, Miss Nunan? - Are you available to meet? - I'm sorry, how did you get my number? Your office patched me through. I said I was your mother. Yeah, Dr. Brennan and I can meet with you. No... just you. Well, if it's relevant to the case, Miss Nunan, I think it'd be important that Dr. Brennan... I can be at your office in a half hour, but you have to meet me alone. I'm sorry, is this about Tommy? What else would it be about, Agent Booth? Okay. A half an hour. What did she want? She wants to see me without you. Did she say why? Probably you make her feel uncomfortable. How so? Well, because you're you and... - You're a well-adjusted woman. - And a best-selling author. I was on the New York times list for 18 weeks, and I won the ed... Right this way. I really appreciate you seeing me. It's my job. That's precious. It's your job... - You said you had information about... - Hockey fan! I have that same print in my office. And it's Pam. I have season tickets to the capitals. We should go sometime. Ms. Nunan, about the case... Seeley, please: Pam. I need to ask you something. Usually I ask the questions. Are you dating Dr. Brennan? No. She's my partner. I see. Your nephew? - That's my son. - You're married? I'm not. Listen, I-I'm kinda busy here, Miss Nunan... I brought you something. - Okay. - I know you've got a thing for socks. - How did you...? - I noticed 'em last time. On the outside, you're this big, tough FBI guy, but really you're just like me... unpredictable, like Tommy was. - Please. - I know. We shouldn't talk about our old flames, especially when we're just getting to know each other. Miss Nunan, you said you had information about Tommy Sour's murder. Really? I have faith you'll find out who killed him. And Tommy wouldn't want me to grieve forever. Look at all these commendations. You're really great at your job, aren't you? It's one of the reasons'm drawn to you. Ma'am, this is way inappropriate... "Ma'am..." that is so cute. I can't wait to tell my mom you just said that. Well, bye for now. What are you watching? Dr. Sweets found Tommy Sour's MySpace video. He's got an okay voice, but he's trying a bit hard, don't you think? Yeah, there are two types of performers. Presentational singers crave attention it's ego-driven. And the representational singer wants the audience to feel. It's about evoking a cathartic experience. - He's showing off. - Presentational. Easy on the eyes, easy to forget. One-hit wonder at best. Like chumbawamba. Chumba what-a? "Tubthumbing." Oh, come on. Are you serious? It's a great song. It's anthemic. So this is all simple psychology to you? People's actions are motivated by their need. When we discover our needs, we discover who we are. So, yes. No, society makes us who we are, not psychology. Society shapes our actions. Culture compels us, not some toilet training mishap. - I'm just gonna break you two up. - You're giving me a headache. You keep this fighting up, no one's getting dessert. We're not fighting. It's just a collegial debate, right? Right. How'd it go with Pam? Wait, you saw her again? What's the big deal, Sweets? She just gave me a pair of socks. - What...? It's not funny. - It's not funny. Then why did I laugh? Pam Nunan controls your emotional agenda through seeming vulnerability, followed by generosity. It's classic manipulation. Then I'll just mail the socks back. Look. Tommy was about to release a CD. "I can't do better than you." I wonder if Pam thought that was meant for her. Yeah, she probably saw secret messages in all of his songs. Until I was 13, I wanted to be the next Cyndi Lauper. I'd say you're kidding, but I don't think you know how to kid. The other girls and I referred to her as "rad." My mother said that I sang just as well. - As well as Cyndi Lauper? - Yes. Mothers do that. It's healthy. No, this wasn't just flattery. My mother told me that I sang "girls just want to have fun" better than she did. It was an expression of affection, Dr. Brennan, not an objective evaluation of your abilities. Well, I think you're wrong. Okay, then, go ahead. Belt it out. - No, absolutely not. - Come on. Give us a few bars. - Come on! - I can't just bust into song. I have to have music and... an appropriate atmosphere of frivolity. Diva! Forensic genius, best-selling author, better than Cyndi Lauper... Wait, look. Freeze the video. Look at him. Tommy's singing to the woman next to him. The one who shushed us. Look, his corrugator muscles are furrowed, his lips are tight. Teeth clenched, his mentalis is crinkled. - The corrugator muscles are... - We know. I don't know. I don't know that. He appears to be very angry, like "get out of my way" angry. He plays the guitar. Yeah. That's how Tommy died. The guitar string could definitely be the murder weapon. - Because it cut the cheese? - Because the exemplar wound approximates the tool marks on the victim's C-5. Yeah, he knew that, he just wanted to say "cut the cheese." Okay, Hodgins, you are the guitar player; Zack, you are Tommy. Reenactment. Fascinating. Not for me. I'm always the one that gets killed. Dude, you're the singer. Singer was the vic here. Tommy was strangled from behind with a wire or guitar string. And the guitar string was pulled tight. Slicing his throat and trachea. Of course. As he lost consciousness, he fell forward. Fracturing his chin. Wait a second. He was a big guy. According to your scenario, he was passive. Nothing in the data suggests that he fought back. Wait a second. Tommy was, he was high. He was toasted. That could have dulled his reflexes. This also explains the shaving of the vertebra. A guitar string would slice a wafer-thin sliver of bone as Tommy dropped to the ground. Amazing. Tommy Sour was strangled, Dax, possibly with a guitar string. Now, I know that you didn't like him singing to your girl. What the hell you talking about? My girl's in Texas. - Look at that. - That's Helen. We perform together. You know, she's married? To someone else? - Why do you look so angry? - 'CauseTommy was a son of a bitch. Look, I'm feeling a little paranoid in here, like I'm being persecuted. Persecuted? Really? Maybe `cause you're feeling a little guilty? A couple of years ago, I introduced Tommy to my trainer Jason. Jason runs a wellness center. He needed personal trainers, and Tommy was a trainer. Jason? As in Jason Bergman? - Yeah, that's right, man. You know him? - Yeah, we've met. Tommy and Jason wanted to open up a place together, one they owned. So they went out, and they got a loan. Tommy stole the money, 50 grand, man. Tommy used the money to produce his own cd. High-end musicians, arrangements, publicity, the works. So that's why I'm harboring the negative vibes, dude. Yeah, I can only imagine how Jason feels. So I contacted the bank. Dr. Jason's on the hook for the full amount of the loan. Which we conveniently forgot when we spoke to him before. All right, Bones... You're looking for Dr. Jason? He didn't come today. I've been calling him, his cell isn't on. - Is that unusual? - This place is his whole life. You could call him day or night, he'd always answer. Great, thanks. Yeah, hi. It's Agent Booth. I need a bolo for a Dr. Jason Bergman, wanted for first-degree murder. Oh, Dr. Hodgins. Dr. B, what's up? Did you swab the C-5 vertebra for elemental trace? I swabbed the C-5 vertebra, the hyoid and the temporal bone. Analyzing the particulates now. I'll need your results as soon as possible. Okay, I'm on it. How'd it go with guitar guy? Booth doesn't think it's him; no motive. But the wound. It's definitely a wire or metal string of some kind, but not from him. Booth suspects the manager of the wellness center. So you're looking for some wire used in a gym or by a physical therapist. Yes. Assuming that it was a crime of passion, the killer would have used something handy. Brennan. Okay, I'll meet you there. I need those results. Right away. I quit my job, decided to move out of town. So what? Officer pulled you over on the interstate in Ohio You've been traveling nonstop since yesterday morning. Is that a crime? Maybe. We know about the small business loan. Then you also know that I'm the last person in the world that would want Tommy dead. With him out of the picture, I'm responsible for the whole nut. - What? The nut? - 50 grand. I couldn't see another way out. So you thought you could hide from the bank. I'm not married. I got no close family, so, yeah, I thought I could disappear. Just fall off the grid. You hear about it all the time. I think you were pissed and you just snapped. That place was everything to you. Tommy ruined it for you. So, you ruined him. You know what I think, Agent Booth? I think motive without evidence is like riding a stationary bike you get nowhere fast. Like right now? Dr. Bergman, did you use any wires or wire-like instruments at the gym or in your chiropractic practice? Any further questions will have to go through a lawyer. - Hodgins. - Sorry to barge in. Oh, no, you can't just barge in here! There was elemental evidence on the vertebra. - You wanted to know asap. - What's the evidence? It's phyllosilicate minerals and aluminum oxides. - Oh. - Yeah. - What? English? - It's clay. Very good. - I have nothing to do with clay. - No, you're totally gonna be cleared. You can't say that. This is my place. And there was silver particulates embedded in the composite. - On his vertebra? - Yeah. There's a company called clay global which infuses sculpting clay with silver powder. They sell direct via the internet. And get this, they recently shipped a package of the clay to the other unit of our victim's duplex. A warrant? Search my place? He can read. I'm the one who reported Tommy missing. - Why would I be hiding anything? - Because you killed Tommy, and you reported him missing to cover your own ass. No, no. Hey, excuse me. - What are you doing? - Oh, are you asking because you have an interest in forensics, Mr. Matthews? What? This clay-cutting wire is consistent with the object used to kill Tommy Sour. I'm testing it for blood. Just look at. There's no blood on it. If the liquid turns blue, it means this wire came in contact with human blood. - Wait. - Guess what. You are under arrest for the murder of Tommy Sour. Wait. You don't understand, OK? I didn't want to, but the noise was... - The noise? - Yeah, you hear it. The alarm clock. These walls are so thin, and I needed to work, to concentrate for my show. And Tommy would just sing at the top of his lungs day and night. He never ever shut up. I begged him to lower his voice, to sing quietly, but he didn't care. And that gives you the right to strangle him into silence? No, I was just trying to scare him.
