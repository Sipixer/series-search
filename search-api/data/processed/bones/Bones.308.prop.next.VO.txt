you asked me to come out here instead of her. No, Bones' feelings, they don't get hurt. - She's not like you. - Like me? A girl. Yeah, the word you're looking for would be "woman," who, incidentally, makes more money than you. - Touchy. - What can I say? - I'm just a girl with feelings. - Listen, construction crew they found the body this afternoon. Key word here is "body." As in still meaty. Male, middle-aged. Bones, she usually... kneels next to the remains. These are designer pants. And my bodies are always so much gushier than Dr. Brennan's. I'm just saying. Looks like a stab wound to the middle of the chest. Naked, wrapped in plastic. Bite marks to the face and extremities. Looks like rats. Rats. Looks like he might have been kneecapped. Mob thing, maybe? What's that? Some kind of gem stone. This blow through the sternum would have been fatal. Dealt by a double-edged blade. So we know our killer is strong. Based on the rate of decomp, I'd say he's been dead three days. - Probably dumped Friday night. - The gem stone is jade. - I'm narrowing down the exact type now. - Grit from the wounds. Hey, grit to you, open book to me. The injuries to the knees aren't from baseball bats or bullets. Zack is right. The victim's patellas were removed surgically. King of the Lab. Dr. Brennan? Yes? Amy Hollister. I'm your brother's girlfriend? Of course. Please come in. Would you like something to drink? No, no, I-I'm sorry, I... I don't have a lot of time. Do you know where Russ is? Amy, I haven't seen Russ in months. I have two little girls, well, you know, and... The youngest one, that's Hayley, she's not doing too good. Cystic fibrosis. Russ mentioned that she had lung problems. Well, her breathing's real bad and... now her liver. And... she keeps asking for Russ. I'm... going to give you the... phone number of Dr. Leo Goetz. He's the premiere authority on cystic fibrosis in the country. I can't afford that. Oh, no, Amy... Leo and I are friends. He'd do it for me as a favor, no charge. I'm going to give him a call, tell him to expect you. I... I don't know what to say. - Thank you. - And as for Russ... I think you're be better off talking to Dad. I understand. Thank you for your time. The knees. Bones S03E07 "The Knight on the Grid" Transcript: swsub.com Sync: IceFre@k --==All-about-Subs.fr==-- Somebody sent you human kneecaps in the mail? That is like ugh. Zack says they match our victim. Look, we're dusting the envelope for prints. It was sent somewhere from the D.C. area. - These patellas are unusually worn. - Worn from what? It's hard to say definitively, but I'd say the man did a lot of kneeling. Wait a minute, I've seen that before. That symbol looks familiar. Like it's from some kind of seal. Hey, look, Bones, you are gonna, you know, stay with a friend, - check into a hotel, right? - She can stay with me. - Great. - Thank you. No. Why? Mr. Kneecaps has your home address. I can't freak out every time somebody Googles me. Cam? She goes nowhere alone. - Cam? Don't listen to him. - Who are you more afraid of, me or her? So this is what it's like to be a kindergarten teacher. Fascinating interpersonal interaction. Dr. Sweets. I... Oh, my... that is gross. Yeah, it's an autopsy room. It's no place for therapists. What do you want? You and Dr. Brennan missed our session this morning. Maybe because somebody sent body parts to Bones in the mail. Oh, my God. I've identified the murder weapon. Oh, that was quick. Tapered inch and a half wide with both a hilt and a quillon. The cannelure is also quite distinctive. That's the Gormogon knife. The serial killer? Which is why the symbol looked so familiar. I've seen it on a tapestry in the vault. So this is the famous bank vault where the violinist was murdered and eaten? We transported everything from the bank here to the Jeffersonian. So, if you touch anything, Sweets, you put it back exactly the way it was. Oh, awesome. The Widow's Son sculpture. It's complete silver skeleton which is replaced piece by piece with the bones from murder victims. Then all of the relics, including that skeleton, can be traced to the Gormogons. A 17th century anti-Masonic group. Supposed to be extinct. How many victims? Oh, the statue contains the bones of at least five five unidentified victims plus the violinist. That is the actual violinist's pinky. Well, obviously Gormogon sent you his kneecaps to continue his work. We are not fitting those kneecaps onto this skeleton. Mark my words: you'll find something special about those kneecaps. Okay, this tapestry here is off somehow. Off? Don't look at me. My idea of art is a half-naked woman on the side of a van. That's interesting. No, it's not interesting, Sweets, because it was a joke. Okay, what's the matter? Russ's girlfriend, Amy, came to see me. Her daughter's sick. She's looking for Russ. I told her that my dad might know where he is. Your brother is a wanted fugitive, he's a material witness in your - Dad's murder trial. - Amy knows that. He's not gonna come back just because your niece has a cough. Technically, she's not my niece and it's not a cough. It's cystic fibrosis. Missing persons sent over dental records from middle-aged men. I checked them against the victim. - You get a hit? - Father Douglas Cooper. Vicar General to the Archbishop of Washington D. C. Okay, Sweets was right about the kneecaps. This guy would have been a world-class kneeler. Saying that someone is a whiz at psychology is like saying they're good at mind reading. It's a series of lucky guesses. I'm bringing Sweets in on the case. - You make fun of him all the time. - Only when he messes with our heads. He was right about the knees. Zack, shouldn't you be figuring out what was used to excise the kneecaps? Yes, Dr. Brennan. What? You just dismissed Zack. No, I didn't. Oh, don't get me wrong, I, I liked it. Thank you for coming in, Archbishop Wallace. You found my Vicar General? Yes, your Holiness. Monsignor. Or Steve. So, how did Doug die? - Well, Steve... - Bones! - He said to call him Steve. - Monsignor. Father Cooper was stabbed to death. As a part of a series of cannibalistic murders. A series of cannibalistic murders? We're still trying to find out what they have in common. Doug Cooper was a, a quiet man. He'd been on sabbatical for the past six months. - He was writing a book. - About? The history of early Christianity. Its ties to paganism. Esoteric stuff. Somebody ate Doug? Just a part of him. A lovely, decent man, humble, dedicated to serving others. Unfortunate choice of words, given that someone ate him. Just a part of him. There's too much evil in the world. God forgive me, but... sometimes I wonder if I'm little more than a Band-Aid. Amen, Monsignor. Amen. Thanks, Steve. Angela identified the red-haired figure on the tapestry. Barabbas. A murder and rapist who was condemned to death in New Testament Jerusalem. The Gormogons believed that the descendents of Barabbas started the first secret societies. To the Gormogons, Barabbas is an enduring symbol of all that is backwards upside-down, or inside out. So if you find his figure on a Gormogon relic... It's a sign to interpret it backwards or in a mirror or upside-down. The numbers on the tapestry are a simple alpha-numeric code. Each number corresponds with a letter. Civitas capitolium. Which means "Capitol City." D. C. was laid out according to Masonic symbols. Now, notice the Pentagram here over the White House? And you see the compass and the square. The point of the compass is over the U. S. Capitol building. But here's where Angela's Barabbas thing really kicks in. The presence of Barabbas on this means backwards and upside-down. When the compass is inverted, it points to some very interesting landmarks. The bank... where we found the vault. The place where Father Cooper's body was dumped. The highway overpass off of which Gavin Nichols's head was thrown. What's there? It's an old mansion that's now a nursing home. And this... falls very precisely... - What's that? - A mausoleum at Silver Hill Cemetery. You want to look inside? Hell, yeah, I do. This mausoleum is abandonned here since the 1800. It's paid for by a trust. As far as the Director of the Cemetery knows, - no one's been out here for a century. - This better be good. Look, "Pater Mortvvs." That means dead father. You know Latin? Dude. Alter boy. You got a key? Yeah, brought my own. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? - Can I do it? - No. You don't let me play with your bugs. Ah, great. Another one. this one's completely made of bone. Hi. How's Hayley doing? Dr. Goetz is a Godsend. I don't know how to thank you. Oh, Hayley, sweetie, that's Dr. Brennan. Temperance. Another doctor? Oh, not that kind. Temperance is Russ's sister. Couldn't you call him and tell him to come home? It's complicated. Here, eat your Jell-O, sweetie. I tried to get into the jail to see your father. They wouldn't let me in. They said I'm not a relative. Amy, Russ is a fugitive. The minute he comes back to D. C., they'll toss him in jail. Well, how would anyone know? Well, I work with the FBI. You don't have to be in this. All you have to do is ask your father to get a message to Russ. You look my baby in the face and tell her she can't see her father because you're mad at yours. What have we got? So far, I've identified 18 different victims, and I'm not done. All bones show cannibalism indicators. This tibia appears to be over 50 years old. You mean the victim's over 50? What I mean is, the victim was killed over 50 years ago. That would suggest that Gormogon's, what, a- a minimum of 70 years old? The teeth marks on this bone do not match Gormogon's teeth. My God. We have another cannibal out there? An old one? The gemstone you found in Father Cooper's chest is violet jade. The dirt contains sepiolite. And we're happy about this because? Both violet jade and sepiolite are found only in a certain region of Turkey. The Anatolia region, to be exact. Legendary site of the Garden of Eden. And this comes from the vault. Guess what? It's the same stuff. Run the new dentals against the NCIC database. What do you want me to do? Be on the lookout for a face-eating cannibal who uses a walker? There's my girl. I... I brought you a coffee cake, but they... they took it from me. Oh, well, I'm not into coffee cake. These days, all my... meals are prepared by men in hairnets. I'm glad you came. While I was waiting, I was thinking about all the places that I've been that were worse than prison. El Salvador, for example, and that two weeks I spent in a shipping container. Disney World. You hated Disney World. I thought I was always able to keep that from you kids. No. I was six, Russ was ten. It was pouring rain. Mickey sneezed so hard, his head popped off. I think I like prison better. Dad, I'm here about Russ. He's fine. You don't have to worry about Russ. The woman he lived with, the-the kids he was raising... they need him home. Russ sends Amy and the girls money every month. The younger child, Hayley, is... really sick. She's asking for him. How sick? I'm here, Dad. I am asking you to tell Russ. Let him make up his own mind what to do. If he comes back to D. C., Russ is going to end up in here with me. He won't do that. He's scared to death of jail. He'll come if you ask him to. You look more like your mother every day. I've got to go. Well, come back soon. And thanks for the coffee cake. I found the same symbol that was mailed to Dr. Brennan - on this tapestry. - It looks like a bunch of Tarot cards. The Architect, The Martyr, The Orator, The Musician, The Bishop, The Corruptor... - That's it. - What? Gavin Nichols. The musician. Father Cooper was a bishop. He's doing it in order? - What's next? - The Corruptor. So, the next victim is a corruptor. So, let's call up every porn kingpin and drug dealer in the country. Tell them to look out for a lunatic with a napkin in his collar holding a knife and fork. Dude, you're being way too literal. These icons extend from the 1600s. A corruptor would mean a heretic, like, say, a pretender to the throne. What are you doing here? You left a message that you wanted to see me. Not see. Talk. On the telephone. Interesting what people say unwittingly. I'm totally into the Gormogon file, and it's my opinion, you're looking for a duo. How did you get the file? You gave him the case file? Time out, okay? He came up with the whole duo thing. We found another Widow's Son skeleton. This one's complete. The teeth marks suggest two cannibals. Really? That's awesome! It's like the Sith Lords, man. There's always only two of them. Did you justStar Warsus? In the parlance of the 17th century, it's a master and apprentice situation. Each master must create one of these sculptures while training an apprentice. When it's complete, the master retires, the apprentice becomes a master, starts his own project. So, Gormogon used to be the apprentice? Now he's the master. How does me saying no translate to bringing Sweets in? All right, get this. Both victims lost their fathers at a young age. Widow's sons. Coincidence? I think not. Also, two months ago, we arrested Gormogon's apprentice. Yeah. He killed himself. Point of investigation. How do masters find their apprentices? Not on Craig's List. I checked. I bet you two free sessions that the master has access to at-risk children. Kid's got chops. Well, anything else? Yeah. It must be killing him that you have this. This is like his whole reason for living. You might be able to find some way to use that. Wait till you hear this. Father Cooper took a trip to Turkey last year. The Anatolian region? Gavin Nichols was on the same trip. The bishop and the musician. What about a corruptor? Trip was arranged by a lobbyist. - Is that too literal? - A lobbyist? Oh, that's a total pretender to the throne. This is how we roll, right, guys? Bones, you got time to talk to a lobbyist? You think my life is in danger because I went to Turkey? Two of the men you traveled with are dead. Their faces were eaten off. This is Washington D. C. People have their faces eaten off all the time. Mr. Porter, are you a member of any fraternal order? We know you're a member of the Knights of Columbus. Says so right here on your resume. We know you went to Turkey with the Knights to visit the mythical site of the Garden of Eden. And you think that there's a cannibal out there who has something against a group of civic-minded men who do good works in their community? Look, the guy we're after... He thinks that the Knights of Columbus is an evil secret society. That's crazy. - I think he's finally catching on. - Your life is in danger. Why me? I mean, there were 40 guys on that trip. How old were you when your father died? Six. What does that have to do with anything? You lost your father, and you're a corrupter. Okay. You want to talk to me, you do it through my lawyer. All right, listen, Mr. Porter, we are just trying to help here. The FBI is investigating influence peddling. I am one of your targets. Someone eating the faces off the Knights of Columbus... - How stupid do you think I am? - Right now? Very, very stupid. Okay. Bones, you didn't have to call him corrupt. - Why? - Why, because, obviously, he is. Agent Booth? There's someone here to see you. Where's Hayley? Russ. You came to the FBI? That was the deal. This just keeps getting better. All right. Russ Brennan, you're under arrest. - Come on. You know the drill. - You lied? - You told Dad Booth wouldn't arrest me. - No, I never said that. I should have known better than to trust anyone in this family. - I swear. - I want to see my step daughter. Hi, honey. Russ, I knew you'd come! Here, come here, look who's here. Making funny faces? Thank you for coming, Russ. Thank you, Booth. Oh, this never happened. Don't thank me. As far as the Bureau is concerned, I caught him here 15 minutes from now. Thank you, Booth. Just don't tell anyone. You told Russ I said Booth wouldn't arrest him. Look, I couldn't turn him over to you. That just puts you in a quandary with Booth. - I did it this way for you. - Dad! What, Booth busted him? That hard ass. Brennan. Dr. Brennan, it's me, Zack. I found something in the Gormogon vault I think you should see. What are you being such a hard ass on my kid for, Booth? - Who's that? - Nobody. It's not Booth. You know, it's-it's bad enough that nobody can trust you, but now you're making it so Russ and I can't trust each other, either. He came back! He hugged his little girl, okay? So far, things are working out great! I'm here foryou, and a lot of dads aren't. That's true, Dad. What's going on, Zack? Why don't you turn the light on? I was down here helping Angela decode when I noticed the mirrors. What mirrors? Put these on so you can see where you're going. This better be good. I'm surprised no one noticed the mirrors before. They're everywhere. Different kinds, different sizes, placed seemingly at random around the vault. But I have an overdeveloped sense of spatial reasoning. As a result, things that appear random to some people appear deliberate to me. Zack, just get on with it. Watch this. Want to see where it ends? - Yeah. - Yes. From that spot, you'd be able to see every corner of the vault. I don't get it. What does it mean? Gormogon has been watching us this whole time. Bones, Tech guys, they did a sensor sweep. That eye is broadcasting a signal both audio and video. It's white light activated, it probably wasn't triggered by Zack's laser. - What do we do? - Exactly what Sweets said. Use it against Gormogon. - How? - Haven't got a clue. If we fooled him into thinking that we're transferring the sculpture, he might try to grab it. No. No, if he wants it as much as Sweets says, then he'll try to steal it. No. Why not? Because I didn't think of it. Look, it's a great idea, but if you're gonna sell it, you're gonna have to put Father Cooper's kneecaps in the silver skeleton. I do this under extreme protest. The truck will be here any minute. Who knows about this? Just you and me, Bones. Not even the driver knows what we're transporting. The MRI at Bethesda will tell us if Gormogon hid anything within the bones. Like what? I don't know. That's why we need the MRI at Bethesda. What? You don't have to scream, I'm right here. Right. Okay. Are you done? We're kind of on a schedule. Yes. I'm done. Now we can load it onto a truck and take it to Bethesda. All right, everybody keep their distance. I don't want to spook this guy. - I have a question. - No, you can't drive. We're undercover, and I'm the taxi driver. Passengers don't sit in the front seat. You're not a passenger, okay. You're a trainee. And I'm training you how to drive a taxicab. All units be advised. I got a motorcycle with no plates. Easy. - Get down! - What? Why? Don't move. Put your arm underneath my shoulder. Come on, you ready? On three. One, two, three. I'm okay, I'm okay. You just get over here. Paramedics are on their way. He knew who we were because I was sitting up front. No, it was because of your bad acting, that's what it was. - What, back at the vault? I was good. - No, you were loud. - That's what they call overacting. - You shouldn't have shushed me, that's how he knew. - Who's got the motorcycle? - Nobody. We lost the follow car. Damn it! - Wait, what about the truck? - It's fine. Wait a second, he knew the truck was a decoy. He wasn't trying to get the skeleton back. He was trying to kill us. What? Oh, all right, easy. I got it. What is that? It's a human tooth. He put human teeth in his bomb for shrapnel. Bones, he was trying to kill us because... we know his next target, the Corruptor, that lobbyist. - Wait... Wait, I want to come. - Stay right there! No, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just a flesh wound. You believe me now? He ran downstairs. He had a knife. He had a knife. It's over. Drop him! - Put the kid down. - Put me down! Put him down. It's okay, it's all right. It's all right, it's over, okay? The Gormogons started out as good guys, you know. In the 1600, the malignant manipulations of secret societies like the Illuminati, the Carbonari, the Masons, the Tong, were starting to be felt. The Gormogons championed the ideal that humanity should be free of these pernicious influences. Good guys. So, you feel sympathy for Gormogon? There are secret societies working today. It's naive to think otherwise. You think I'm paranoid. Yeah. The question is: How paranoid? Zack says that there are over 30 victims represented by the skeleton created by Gormogon and his master, and his master, who has got to be in his 80s. And we know that there are seven in the one created by Gormogon and his dead apprentice, including the violinist and the priest. Now, my point of view. he's going after the Knights of Columbus. Gormogon is nuts. Dr. Sweets? Dead apprentice. Gormogon needs a new apprentice. He may have already found one. We're looking for a kid in his teens. Tempe, what happened to you? I got blown up. Russ, I never told Dad that you should turn yourself in to Booth. If I'd come to you, you would've told Booth anyway. - What do you mean, blown up? - It's a case, Russ. It's my job. We're trying to put a bad guy away. You mean in here. With other bad guys like me. And Dad. There are levels of bad guy, Russ. And you're not even on the first level. Why do I feel like you just called me a sissy? I wanted you to hear it from me, Russ. Dad lied. I never told him it was safe to come back. I had to come back, Tempe. - For Hayley. - Yes. But they are gonna put me away after my parole hearing. It's not just that you violated parole. They think you know something about Dad's murder case. I don't! Nobody believes anybody in this family. What... maybe I'm just like him, right? - A liar? Not worthy of trust. - No, don't say that. I am just like him. I am. I had a family, I left them. You haven't killed anyone. That's the most reassuring that you can be? "Hey, Russ, congratulations on never killing anyone." Being reassuring has never been my strong suit. Levels of bad, right? And I'm a sissy. It's a good thing, Russ. Thanks for helping Hayley. I love that little girl like she was my own. You believe that, don't you? Yeah, Russ. I believe that. Normal person gets blown to hell, they go home, pour a glass of wine, watch TV. Caroline, it think it should be worth something that Russ turned himself in. Bumping into Booth at the hospital is not the same as turning himself in. That's not what happened. It's what Booth says happened. No, Russ turned himself in, but I convinced Booth to let him go see Hayley at the hospital. I did not hear that. Russ turned himself in, but I convinced Booth to let him go see Hayley at the hospital. Do I have this straight? You're a genius? An honest to goodness, dyed-in-the-wool genius? Yes. Dr. Brennan, I like you, on and off, but your brother is a material witness in my murder case. I cannot recommend that he be set free. Please? Oh, well. Now that you said please. - Are you being sarcastic? - Yes! Best I can do is arrange for you to speak at your brother's parole hearing. Looking the way you do, maybe the judge will feel sorry and let him go. These are the marks left by Gormogon's teeth. I reverse engineered a dental set. So this is what the front plate of Gormogon's teeth looks like top and bottom, from incisor to incisor. Okay. These are the teeth from the bomb. It's a match. It was Gormogon's tooth lodged in my shoulder. The tooth found in your shoulder was chipped. In fact, all of the teeth we found, almost a full set, were chipped. Due to the explosion? No, these marks here were made by common, hardware store pliers. He pulled out his own teeth? I don't know. Certainly they were removed with pliers. That's what happened, Zack. Gormogon pulled out all his teeth, one by one, with pliers, and put them in a bomb. Booth was right. He meant to kill us. I was photographing the skeleton in preparation for taking it apart, when I noticed this on a rib. "1026." What is it? It's a number. - No, Zack, Cam meant what does it mean? - Is it code? It could be an ordinal indexed automata. I could start a solution, but it would extend into infinity. And how long would that take? Forever. Obviously. How's about that alpha-numeric business? "J. B.F." Meaningless. No, wait a minute. - I got it. - What? He's an artist. He's finished something. I mean, it's terrible, but, to him, this is a piece of art. It's a signature. 1026 is a number, not a name. No, I'm telling you, this is a signature. The vault is like a museum of the Gormogons, right? An archive. Then why don't we just look in Safety Deposit Box 1026? 'Cause they're all rigged to blow up when you open them. Oh, I solved that one. In my head, while having my Cuppa Soup. What I'm doing is smothering the phosphorus with argon, thus giving Booth time to reach in with tongs to remove whatever's inside the box before it ignites. Why me? Obviously because you have the fastest reflexes. - Fine, you can pull the tray. - Fine. Exactly how far back should I be standing? Ready? Door! Tray! Lid! Tongs! Did Booth get it? Yes, Zack, can't you see? Not for another three to five minutes. It's a key with a bar code on it. You called me to the FBI because you found a key to my office? We accessed the information contained in the bar code. It came up as the key to your office in the Social Services building. That's not the key to my office. Room 1026, Municipal Department of Social Services. Nobody's used a key like that since the 70s. It was before my time. Wait a second, has that office always belonged to Social Services? Yes, back then, it was dealing with foster care and group homes. Booth, Sweets is right. That would be a great place to recruit disturbed boys. Recruit for what? It's just that that man that was in that office is a bit of a legend. He helped a lot of kids find their way. What was his name? Arthur Graves. He's retired now. He wouldn't happen to live in a nursing home that used to be a mansion? Mr. Graves has been here for five years. In a wheelchair for the last four. Sweet guy, a little particular about what he eats. You have no idea. I beg your pardon? What's wrong with Mr. Graves? Alzheimer's. The last few months, he's gotten pretty bad. Is he lucid? He comes and goes. Hey, Arthur, some nice people are here to see you. Hey, Mr. Graves. FBI Special Agent Seely Booth. Listen, we got a court order here to get a dental imprint from you. Mr. Graves, I'm not going to hurt you. I just need you to bite down on this for me. Sorry. He's not like that usually. - I think you may have frightened him. - How'd he lose his teeth? They'd all been pulled when he got here. - Does he have any regular visitors? - There used to be a man. He drove a motorcycle. - I believe he may have been a nephew. - We know who you are. - We know what you did. - All right, Bones, it's okay. Let's go. We'll check out his case files. See what kids he could've recruited. Come on. Let's go. While I'm here, I'm gonna get a court order to monitor Arthur Graves' visitors. Just in case "Gargonzola" decides to come back and visit his old master. You're doing that Gorgonzola thing on purpose, aren't you? Hi, Temperance. Hi. If that's who I think it is, I can't really be friendly. I understand, I'll just wait over here. Here. That's for you. Hayley's feeling better. She even wanted to come. Please tell her thank you. Agent Booth? - The Judge will see you now. - Great. In chambers. Why in chambers? Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan has already proven himself a flight risk. He is attached to his family. - The same family he abandoned? - Temporarily. When his little girl needed him, he returned without any regard for himself. You're his parole officer. We're all here because you're the one who violated him. Only because it's the law, Ms. Julian. I have a lot of faith in Russ Brennan. Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan not only broke his parole by fleeing the region, he is a material witness in an upcoming murder trial. That is a totally different issue that has nothing to do with this hearing. This isn't a hearing. It's an informal meeting to decide whether there will be a hearing. Can I say something? That is a slippery slope, Judge Watkins. - Can I? - No. But you said this was informal. I'm still the Judge and I get to make those decisions. Agent Booth, what are your thoughts? - I got nothing to say, Judge. - Booth, please! I got a phone call from the Archbishop of D. C. 15 minutes ago. He promises to take a personal interest in Mr. Brennan's rehabilitation. For God's sake, why? Also a psychiatrist, Dr. Lance Sweets, who says he believes Mr. Brennan will not flee the jurisdiction again. Plus, a parole officer who is recommending against revoking parole. Why should I ignore all that? Because Ms. Davis will simply send Russ Brennan home. That is not my intention. It's not? Mr. Brennan should be punished. Punished how? 30 days in county jail. - What? - That's nothing. Seems pretty harsh from where I sit. Also 18 months should be added to his parole, and he should be forced to wear electronic monitoring. That is slightly more than nothing, but only slightly. I will register your opinion, Ms. Julian, but that's my ruling. If I had a gavel, I'd bang it, but how about the last one out just slams the door? I want you to consider what side you're on. Bishops and psychiatrists and bleeding heart parole officers, that's what's wrong with the justice system in this country. Russ, you've got to go with the marshals. Thank you again. I didn't do anything again. - You should thank him, too. - Why? - He saved Russ. - I didn't do anything, okay. Russ... time to go. Okay, here's the thing, Russ. All right, you run again, you disappoint that woman and her kids, and you break your sister's heart, I will... Do something terrible. I got it. Yeah, I hope you do. All yours, boys. Hey, Booth.
