- Anything else? What are you doing? I'm trying to buy back your love because I've been working so much. You get some bad ideas in your head these days, don't you, Sarah? It's the bionics, isn't it? They've changed me. Turned me into this thing. We think Sarah Corvus might be working with Anthony Anthros. - Will's father? - He escaped from prison. He tried to sell bionics to the highest bidder. Am I ticking time bomb too? I guess I just want to know the truth. About everything. I don't like secrets, Jaime. You're not gonna kill me twice, are you? And we all know that if your training is worth a damn, I should be able to take this crowbar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanly possible-- This is what you call studying at Rachel's house? - Who the hell is she? - Nobody. - Jaime, stop! - You lied to me! You looked me right in the face and you lied. You're a piece of work, you know that? This is the thanks I get for buying you those $1,000 jeans? What the hell is wrong with you? You're 15 years old. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm living my life, Jaime. It's none of your business. Oh, yes, it is my business. Hey, do you know she's 15 years old? You could go to jail! - You said you were 18. - Shut up! We're going home. - What did you do to my toe? - It's my toe. And why does it hurt? What happened to the self-healing anthrocytes? Well, you're an early prototype, Jaime. As time goes on, we're gonna discover countless imperfections. That's so not reassuring. And you're giving me the creeps. You keep staring at it. Do you have a foot fetish? Actually, no, Jaime, I do not. I'm pretty much just a simple boob man. - You did this surveilling your sister? - She lied right to my face. Just looked at me and lied. "I'm going to Rachel's house." Well, that's what teenagers do. They lie. They get tattoos. They have wild sex, and then knock off liquor stores. Okay, your toe is screwed. I'm gonna have to shock that thing into submission. Now this shouldn't hurt at all. On three. One. - You suck! - Here's what I think. You cannot begrudge a teenage girl the opportunity to make out in parked cars with older guys. It's the lying. Isn't this righteous indignation just a tiny bit hypocritical considering you're a $50 million weapon leading a double life? That's mean. Look, I don't really care so much about what she does. I know she's gonna make stupid mistakes and all that. I just don't want her to lie to me because then I can't help her. Huh, that sounds good. Tell her that. Check it out. Good as new. - You're a genius. - Yeah. Let's keep this between us, okay? - Sure thing. - Thanks. I'll see you, and I'll raise you all in. Everything. That's a lot of coin. You know, people say that men take all the risks. I'm here to tell you it isn't true. You all turn out to be a bunch of scared little boys. It's disappointing. It really is. Sarah, put your hands on your head. I guess the fun's over. This is my boyfriend. It's an on again off again sort of thing. You know how it is. I kill all those people. He shot me in the head. Our friends call us the Bickersons. Isn't that right, honey? But you know what they say. At the end of the day the most important thing in the world... is love. I knew the game was fixed. I'm sorry. - You owe me $27,269.31 for the toe. - How'd you find out about that? Your bionics represent the most advanced form of biotechnology known to man. It was developed to protect the human race, not spy on your delinquent sister. You know, I find your whole proprietary attitude about my body to be deeply inappropriate. How's the toe? Take a look at this. My name is Mark Stevens. I'm an american doctor working in Paraguay. I'm being held against my will. They say that they will kill me unless-- A group that calls themselves "the sons of the red sand" took Stevens in Ciudad Del Este two days ago. They claim he's CIA. Is he? He's american. That's enough for them. He's got some incredibly sensitive information. And they're gonna behead him in 48 hours unless the CIA admits he's theirs, which they won't. - So why is this our problem? - You mean besides the fact he's an american who could get his head chopped off? I mean, why isn't the military sending someone in? Paraguay never passed any anti-terrorism laws. They're not about to let the U.S. mount an operation on their soil. - But we can? - The two of you can. Anything that looks like special ops is out. But an american couple moving about the city? I want to help this guy, but I don't think I can fly off to Paraguay right now. Becca-- Becca will be watched 24/7 by a surveillance team. Okay, I'm in. Just-- what am I gonna tell Becca? You'll think of something. Ah... the eggs! You were cooking? Who are you making breakfast for? - You. - Why are you making me breakfast? About last night. I just want to clear the air. I was-- Fine. Look, I'm sorry I lied to you. Yeah, I mean, I shouldn't have done it. It was dumb. Besides, that guy's a creep anyway. I mean, usually those internet chat room guys, you know, they turn out to be reasonably cool. Oh, my god! I'm kidding. God, you think I'm retarded? - No, I don't think you're retarded. - Yeah, you do. So what's going on with you? Um, well, Carly invited me up to Napa to celebrate her getting into law school. - Oh, well, that should be fun. - Yeah. - We land on an airstrip. - An airstrip? - Is that different from an airport? - Well, yeah, it's dirt. I have an asset in place, a local cop. He's gonna help us locate Stevens when we get there. How can you land a 747 on a dirt runway? No, it's not a 747. It's a little gulfstream. - Really? - You okay with that? Yeah, I'm good. Um, do you have any anti-anxiety meds? Sedatives? Anything in that area? Hi, Jaime. How's it going? You look great. How's Becca? Stevens is running out of time. We have to go now. Jonas will take care of her. Okay? We're almost done. I'm just getting started. Stop-- Let him go, Sarah. Take him to the infirmary. - You're not helping yourself. - Reflexes. Your reflexes were recalibrated through sensory neurons with your original surgery. That was hostility. You noticed. A girl likes to be noticed. Let's cut to the chase. You're having hand tremors, night sweats, anxiety, paranoia. Even paranoids have enemies. The bottom line is the medicine Anthros gave you barely gave you any relief. The truth is it probably made you worse. Are you're gonna fix me? My hero. Isn't that what you want? From you? I want nothing. Kill me or let me go. You know, I tried that once before. It didn't work. - This time I thought I'd help. - You don't know how. Will was working on an upgrade. I want Anthony Anthros. You tell me where he is, you get your life back. - You're full of crap, Jonas. - And you're getting worse. Who made me this way? You're a liar, Jonas! A liar playing God! My contact has a very good idea where Stevens is being held. Uh-huh. He's gonna meet us there. Hook us up with some transportation when we-- - You okay? - I'm scared of flying. I couldn't find any drugs, and I think getting wasted before a mission is a bad idea. I just think, you know, a hunk of metal in the sky. Counterintuitive. Okay. Let's talk about something else. Okay. I'm upset because I keep lying to my sister about my job. You're protecting her. You're not lying. If she knew the truth about you putting your life on the line, I don't think she would be able to handle that. I don't think I buy that. I think everybody should know the truth. No, the world just doesn't work like that, Jaime. But then how can you have trust? Trust and full disclosure is not the same thing. You trust me right? Relatively speaking. But what do you know about me, hmm? What have I disclosed? This is supposed to make me feel better? All you need to know is that we're a team and that I have your back. - Isn't that enough? - Thank you. Easy, tiger! Easy, easy! That's your bionic hand. That's your bionic hand. - Sorry. - Okay. We must hurry. No one can know we've met. Remember, Paraguay is a complicated place. We have no laws against terrorism. And this group has legitimate business interests. Kidnap and ransom is legitimate? All the perimeter doors are alarmed. The only other access is through the venting system. But it's blocked by an exhaust fan. It'll take your head off before they will. Thanks. We'll keep that in mind. If they catch you, I don't know you. My police won't help you. My opinion, for what little it's worth, this is suicide. But you americans know all there is to know about handling these foreign situations, yes? He's an optimist. Okay, we get in, we get him, we get out. Sure, easy. There wasn't supposed to be an alarm. Just get us in. - You know how to disarm it? - Stevens' life is ticking away. Just do it. Trust me. You're a machine. Don't think about it. Even if it's not real, it's still attached. I'd like to keep it that way. Give me a second. See? Matter over mind. What now? Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? I suggest you follow my lead or you'll be shot. You told me I could trust you. Beauty is supposed to be the mark God sets upon virtue. And are you God in that homily? She got less virtue than she bargained for. Look, I know you don't want to believe this, but every step of the way she had no bigger supporter than me. So why make her your enemy? She needs help. Will came up with a fix before he was killed. Swap out the nerve bundles, infuse new anthrocytes. - So what are you waiting for? - She knows where Anthros is. He's been giving her treatment. Maybe if you fixed her, she'd talk. Chicken, egg. Be her friend, Jae. You want to help her? Help her help herself. - At least we're together. - You're out of your mind. We're about to be executed. No, they'll want to make an example out of us to Stevens, or they'll want to make an example out of him for us. Either way, that gets us to him. I need you to lose the fear and go bionic. If I told you what I was going to do, you would've backed out-- Friends of yours? I believe, Dr. Stevens, that you don't believe what will happen to you if you don't decode the contents of your flash drive. Which is nothing compared to what will happen to her. Please, I'm working as fast as I can. Perhaps you need a little inspiration. Wait, it's a multi-level asymmetric encryption! It's gonna take time. Allah akbar. Now would be a good time, Jaime. Jaime, now! - Jonas says he can help you. - And he's got every reason to lie. He's also a man of self-interest. You're valuable to him. He's playing you. Getting off watching this dance. Or you're playing me. I want you to know you can trust me. I want you back. We all want something back. Even if Jonas could help me, I don't trust him. Do you trust me? Bring me proof that Jonas is telling the truth. That they made advancements they can use to fix me. I might remember where he can find Anthros. Take this rope. We'll tie him and take him. Take the rope, tie his hands up. We gotta move. What are you gonna do to him? No worse than what he was going do to you. You want answers, right? Then when you're done, take him down to the fan room. What about you and Stevens? What about me? He stays. What are you talking about? - You deciphered the flash drive. - I was stalling. - You read it! - What was on the flash drive? Tell me. You. Blueprints, materials, everything there is to know about bionics. If you know what was on that drive, then you know who gave it to me. To decipher, not to read. This doesn't make any sense. We came here to save him. - And we would have. - I'm not gonna say anything. Yeah, until you're caught, tortured, or your brother is taken. They put a machete to a pretty girl's neck, you were gonna give it up. - I was trying to save you. - Take him down to the fan room. So you're just gonna kill him, is that it? Jaime, go. Go! Damn it! Far end of the building, fan room, I'll meet you there, go. You let him go, he talks, you're in the crosshairs. A target for people to catch and dissect. You won't last a month. Then I won't. Are you okay? You've been hit. Go through. Thank you. - What you did back there. - It was stupid. I'm gonna get us both killed. I have no plan. You know that, right? There'll be supplies in here for your wound. - We can't stop. - No, you can't keep going. Can you get the lock? Can you see what numbers to push? Your eye, can you tell what numbers? 2569. These are usually four digit codes. That gives us 24 combinations. Let's try it in reverse. Highest probability. All right. Who gave you the flash drive? I have a contact. A voice on the phone. When he needs help, he tells me where to pick things up. What about the terrorists? Do you know who hired them? I assumed it was just them. Somebody tipped 'em off to what I was doing. Okay, your body's in shock. You really are a doctor? It's not just a cover? Yale medical school. Two-year residency at Walter Reed. Specialty in espionage? I was always kind of a savant with word games and puzzles. How many words can you make out of the letters in yoo-hoo, that kind of thing. I was showing off one day at Walter Reed and a CIA guy recruited me. You don't feel that? How bad? The human response to a foreign object is to repel it and fight it like an infection. But you... ... Aren't human? You have anthrocytes. The files say they're designed to keep your body from rejecting the bionics. So they work to incorporate what's foreign and not repel it. Doesn't sound so bad. The anthrocytes are moving the bullet. It could damage other organs. I need to take it out. Now. - She could be dead. - No, she's not. She's still green. It was your idea to send her in, Jonas. And you nearly got her executed! You know the risk involved better than anyone, buddy. No, willingly surrendering a $50 million bionic woman is not in my play book. Well, it got us inside to get Stevens and the flash drive. You don't have the flash drive, and you don't have Jaime. Well, how about I get off the phone so I can go and find her? You better. And Antonio? You treat her like she's expendable again, I won't be this nice. Do not tell me how to do my job. I'm gonna go and get your girl back. Carly? - What are you doing here? - Nice to see you too. Seriously, what are you doing here? Is everything okay? Yeah, I just borrowed these from Jaime. - She home? - No, she's in Napa... with you. Excuse me? Exactly. - What are you looking for? - What you promised Sarah. Proof of Will's upgrades. You told me to get her trust. - I'm trying to get her trust. - You didn't trust me. There's nothing here. No files at all. - What is going on, Jonas? - I don't know. So you lied to me? I told you Will was working on fixes, not that I had them. Apparently, the files are on a flash drive in Paraguay. How? I don't think we knew Will as well as we thought. Ah, damn it! Sorry. Not what you want to be hearing from your surgeon. How you holding up? I've been sitting here thinking about all the lies I've been told. All the lies I've been telling, even to myself. How do you make peace with it? You don't. You do what you can. Sometimes you pay a price. Three years ago, a lie I deciphered lead to a bombing raid in Iraq. 87 civilians killed. - Another 113 injured. - I'm sorry. So I came to triple border... to atone. Doctoring people who have nothing. What about the CIA? Occasionally they ask a favor. But now I only succeed at deciphering those things that I can live with. If you had told the terrorists what you knew about me, they might've let you go. Yeah, and I'd have given them the technology to do what? And then who would they have sold it to? Do the files say why it does that? - It stops after a few minutes? - Yeah. What? It's your bionic interface... failing... and being reset. It keeps happening. It's inherent in the system. And? The anthrocytes function like an anti-rejection drug. But over time, they become fatigued. So they'll replace them? On the flash drive, it talked about a five-year projection. Until what? Bionic systems cease to function. What does that mean? What does that mean? You're gonna die. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. So that's where we're starting. With horses? Mr. Ed won't drink, you grab him by the mane, force him under. Hold him there long enough, he'll swallow. The point is to interpret the saying. You do know your horses. You and your sister had one when you were little. Am I right? And Anne named it Coco? Whatever happened to Coco? People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Or have sex without curtains. Me, I like throwing stones. Wakes people up. You're caught between a rock and a hard place. Now you're just trying to be funny. Actually, I'm just trying to do my job, which as much as I don't like it, means trying to understand you. I'm messed up, honey. See, now we're getting somewhere. Does that make you all warm and cuddly inside? You should know I don't do warm and cuddly. You're caught between a rock and a hard place. Well, we both know how that ends, don't we? Three. Three? You can make three words out of yoo-hoo. Oh, yoo, and ooh. Actually, nine. You know, what I said-- I'm sorry. No, it's good to hear the truth for once. - He's coming. - Who? Quick. Around the back. Here. Hold on to this. Wait here. - Wait, what are you-- - Just do it. There is no fix, is there? Jonas is predictable, if nothing else. Tell me you love me. I love you. Let him go! Stand down, stand down! Sarah, stop. Seriously, is that the psychological way of talking me down? - Let Jae go. - And you'll what? Help me? - Where is he? - Gone. - Jaime, where is he? - You were gonna kill him. - I was just doing my job. - You kept me completely in the dark. Sometimes that's what the job requires. I refuse to believe that killing an innocent person could ever make things right. Yeah, well, that information on the flash drive could save you. What we were doing here was for you. You think because I cost $50 million, my life is worth more than his? Oh, we can talk about that later. Give him up now. No. No! Stevens is what we call collateral damage. Killing him saves you. Maybe one day you'll understand that. You want Stevens... you're gonna have to get through me. And this time you'll have to do it without a crowbar. I find this inappropriate workplace behavior. Now who's being inappropriate? You don't want to fight me. You know what I'm capable of. Uh-huh, yeah. Just because you're a machine doesn't mean you can't be beat. That hurt? Yep. You've gotta get out of here-- She took that pen from the tech. The one with the multi-fractured hands. - She figured you'd never help. - The point is moot. She's gone. So is Will's flash drive. Seems Jaime and Antonio had a misunderstanding. That can be dangerous. Hmm, Antonio's doctor can attest to that. So if--if Will's work is gone, then what? Sarah's gonna die? I wouldn't want to be in her shoes. I have never been snowboarding. That seems insane to me now. I can't believe I've lived my whole life never having done that. My friends all head up to snow together. Usually in February. You should come. Oh, you know. Can't plan that far in advance. Like to live in the moment, huh? Go for it. See it, want it, take it. Never look back at the carnage. Exactly. Life's too short. You have no idea. What do you say you and I get out of here? Okay. Five years? Listen, five years is a lifetime in technology, Jaime, it's generations. You didn't think I had a right to know? Yeah, I just didn't want to tell you. I wanted to protect you from-- No, stop. This is my life. You will not treat me like this. I'm entitled to know you will not lie to me. It's disgusting. You're right. You're right, I'm sorry. - My sister. - We will find a way to fix this. Jaime, look at me. I will fix this. I'll fix this. - Hey. - Hey. - How was your trip? - Good. Yeah, you have fun with Carly? Yeah, we hung out. It was cool-- Are you, like, having an affair with a married man or something? - What? - Carly dropped off your shoes. God, you know, I mean, you're just like dad. You make these big pronouncements, but I can't even trust a word you say. And you think that I'm the liar? Look, what is going on, Jaime? Just tell me, okay? I need to know. I deserve to know. I can't. I love you the most. Remember when mom used to say that? Yeah. Only she'd say it so we could both hear. Now I love you the most. And I want to tell you everything. But I can't, I-- Trust... it's supposed to be a two-way street. Yeah, I know, and it sucks. But you have to trust me, Becca. My new job is-- it's complicated. I just... I need to know that you're never gonna leave me. I will never leave you.
