We don't know where it is now, but we do know where it was. Gîza, 3,000 BC. That's Katep and his brother Salatis. Nice. We got a little problem here. We alter this time line and the future is already different. We brought you here because of what had been recorded on the tape in that camera. I'm part ofa team called SG-1. And we havejust travelled back in time 5,000 years. Look at this as a way to change everything. We're supposed to be a team. We save the world. - It was exactly where you said. - If anybody should go, it's us. You only have this Stargate cos ofus. - I'm aware of that. - I'm a linguist. Your team may need one. What if something goes wrong with the gate? Neither of you have had any military training whatsoever. Have either one of you ever even fired a weapon of any kind? Unless you count launching a rocket. Look, I'm sorry. Your expertise may be needed sometime in the future, but for now... Can I ask who is going? I don't understand. What made you change your mind? Hi, Jack. - That's Colonel, Major. - You're retired. - I was. - I take it you two know each other. - We served together a long time ago. - It wasn't that long ago. Major Kawalski was assigned to assemble the team to go through the Stargate. You knew I couldn't say no if he was involved. You don't owe me anything. Admit it, you gotta be curious. Travelling to a different planet, through a wormhole? - I know I am. - Sir, what are they still doing here? I'm not sure. Airmen, please escort... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We were all on that tape. That tape had nothing to do with it. Jack O'Neill's one of the best I've served with. You may not care that this time line is a result of tampering with the past, but you have to acknowledge that the tape said the planet is enemy territory. An enemy that is way more advanced than us, technologically. - What's your point? - You're walking into an alien situation, outmanned and outgunned. Do we have a choice? We could only activate the lights and the dialling computer, but, according to the tape, you have the gene that can make this ship fly. And travel through time. Presumably, you don't have to do that if you don't want to. Hm. - What do I do? - Sit down. - Now what? - You're supposed to be able to fly this. With your mind. - Try not to think about the past. - Or the future. - You so have to let us go with you. - Please. Put those on. How come we have to wear these and you don't? OK, people. Let me remind you. This mission's recon only. Do not engage the enemy. I'm allowing the use of this ship because of the tactical advantage it provides you. Under no circumstances is it to be used to travel through time. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Never in my life would I have imagined giving that order. Are you absolutely certain about them, Colonel? No, sir. Good luck, and Godspeed. All aboard. Hey, watch this. Oh, by the way, you do have the address to get us back home, correct? - Yeah. - Good. Dial it up. I give this no more than a fifty-fifty chance of working. According to the tape, it worked for eight years. Wow. I'm certainly glad it's not me going through that... thing. Any idea what to expect? Not really. According to the tape, we're going to be demolecularised, transmitted 2,000 light years through subspace, and then rematerialised on the other side. I did not need to know that. OK. Gateship one. You're go for launch. - Gateship? - It's a ship that goes through the gate... All right. What? It's a ship that goes through the gate, a gateship. I thought it was clever. - Well, that was cool. - I didn't feel anything. - Doesn't feel like we're pulling any Gs. - This thing must have inertial dampeners. - Any enemy troops on the way through? - No. But that doesn't mean we weren't detected. Is that a city? I'm gonna set her down in those trees. I thought the reason we brought this ship was so we didn't have to walk. You can't just fly into an alien city. This is stealth recon, meaning undetected. - Meaning shut up! - Sorry. Donner, Mansfield, guard the ship. Bosworth, you're with us. Move out. Why did we have to park so far away? Seriously, why did we bring them? I don't know. I guess I had a gut feeling. Like Peru? All right, that didn't work out so well. - Sierra Leone? Uganda? - All right, look. Maybe the better question here is why did you invite me on this dog and pony? Let's just say I prefer my gut instinct over yours. What's with the...? Aw, sh... Hello? Anybody there? We're all here. - Where are we? - It looks like a prison cell. - Anyone seen my glasses? - I think they must have taken them. Why would they do that? - Teal'c. - From the tape? If you know my name, then you know enough to fear me. - I know this might sound a little crazy... - Who are you? Hi. Uh... We're... we're from the Tauri. We call it Earth. You see, we found this tape from the past. Apparently, we're part of a team. The four of us, not the two of them. We're called SG-1. We used a time device to go to the past. We screwed up and changed the future. You're not supposed to be still Apophis' First Prime. The Jaffa are supposed to be free. We know that you think that the Goa'uld are false gods. That wasn't necessary. Speak such blasphemy again, I will kill you. Look... I know this is a lot to throw at you all at one time, and you gotta put up a little show for the boys here, but the fact is... - we know the truth. - See, it's all on the tape. You have to see it. It's... It's in the... It's in the camera that you took from the bag that you took from me. If you bring it to me, I can show you how it works and we can... we could go... and see it over at... wherever you wanna go. Kneel before your god. Kneeling. - Who are you? - Name's Daniel Jackson. If you give me my eyeglasses, I could see... - He claims he's of the Tauri. - You weren't supposed to tell him that. The Tauri have no Chaapa-ai. Oh, sorry, I guess I was wrong. I'm sure your information is correct. I'm usually quite wrong. Quite unreliable, actually. To be honest with you, I'm insane. Speak. Bring him. I think there is much you can tell me. If you wanna know about the early settlers of Mesopotamia, I am an expert. Agh! It's been over an hour. Maybe you shouldn't have said anything. All I said was, "This is gonna sound a little crazy". While there are obvious similarities, our time line is different from the one in which Teal'c came to believe that the Goa'uld were false gods. Are you saying this guy might not turn? - It's possible. - And you're telling me this now? This one is strong. Leave us. You will tell me all that you know. What's goin' on? Show me. Uh... Teal'c, you should say something. The Jaffa are free. False god that he is, Apophis is long dead. A new medicine, tretonin, has liberated us from our dependence upon symbiotes. The Jaffa have risen up as brothers and sisters and defeated the Goa'uld. - What trickery is this? - It's not a trick. You have a son, Rya'c, who is now married, and a strong leader among the newly formed Jaffa nation. Ifthese things have not come to pass, you must believe the present you now live in exists only because the past has been mistakenly altered. It must be restored. Please. You have to help us. The reason we came here was to get you, so we could go back in time and fix things. That's not true. We just wanna get out of here. If you can help us, we'll do our best to help you. I cannot free you. What about our weapons, our vests? Can you get us those? Easy, easy! Get outta here. Pissants! - I didn't tell them anything. - Good. How are you feeling? - Not so good, really. - Sorry. - Maybe this will make you feel better. - Agh! How did you...? Teal'c. He brought us the camera. I showed him the tape. - I don't think he can be trusted. - He gave us our weapons. It's a start. He's gonna meet us on the way back to the ship. Safety off, point and shoot. Not at me. - I don't really like guns. - Neither do I. - What about explosives? - Those I like better. - Cover. - Let's go. - Airman, this is O'Neill. - We were starting to worry. We're on our way. ETA, ten minutes. - We gotta get goin' here. - We got a battalion on our ass. What the hell was that? Shoot him, Jack. Let's shoot him and get the hell outta here. - Why did you do that? - He was a Goa'uld. Apophis implanted him with a symbiote to gain access to the knowledge in his mind. - How do you know? - I could sense it. Your friend did not give in to torture. - He's lying. - Why would he lie, Kawalski? If he wanted us dead, why aren't we surrounded by Jaffa now? We will be if we don't get the hell out of here now, and I'm not taking him with us. Apophis has ordered a fleet of Ha'tak vessels to the Tauri. - He's sending ships to Earth? - The symbiote planted in Daniel Jackson was a spy intended to accompany you. Apophis now knows what Daniel Jackson knew. He knows that you came in a ship. He knows that the Tauri is a threat. How the hell do we know you're not a spy? His eyes glowed. He's dead. Go, go! - Kawalski! - Go! Start it up! - Kawalski's been hit! - Go. Are you injured? No. I've just never seen anyone killed before. Daniel and Kawalski. Oh, my God. You've been shot. - It will heal. - All right. We've got some problems here. - Gliders. - I can't shake 'em either. The gate will be well guarded. You know something? I don't think we're gonna make it to the gate. There is a way out. Was there a Stargate on this planet 5,000 years ago? I believe so. I think you did it. - What has he done? - I think we just travelled back in time. Check it out. Dial Earth. - This is definitely Ancient Egypt. - The Ha'tak vessels bore the mark of Ra. He ruled on Earth during this period. It is likely we were detected exiting the Chaapa-ai. Well... there's no ships on our tail. But I think we'll skedaddle anyway. You saying you're on board with trying to fix the past? Well, we did kind of screw up our time line, didn't we? The only way to stop the invasion on Earth is to make sure it never happens. Yeah, remind me how we do that again. All right. Here's the plan. We make contact with the locals. - And then? - That's all I got so far. - Any idea what time it is exactly? - Three o'clock. Sorry, I meant what year? You and Daniel said there was some kind of a failed rebellion. In 2995 BC. BC? - Colonel. - Kidding. And call me Jack, will you? Hey! It's all right, folks. We come in peace, nothing to be afraid of. I doubt they speak English. - Hello. - He does. - Yes, I am Katep. - I am Jack. O'Neill. Colonel Carter and Teal'c. - How do you know...? - Come with me. Ra's patrols come often. They must not see you, especially you. Please, come. Please. - How do you know who we are? - This is not the first time we have met. - You knew the other SG-1 team. - Five years ago you came. You were witness to the death of my brother at the hands of Ra. After you were trapped here, we planned an uprising together. - So much for causality. - Ra is still here. We have seen his ship. Our first attempt at gathering forces for the rebellion did not go well. We had to expose ourselves to those who proved still loyal to Ra. You were captured and executed long before the plan could be finished. Really? - All of us? - All but one. This can't be a good sign. - Why's that? - Where am I? - Ancient Egypt. - No, I mean the me from your time line. I killed you. - Why? - You were a Goa'uld spy. - A good reason. - It was horrible. - I'm sure. Why are you here? - Yes, excellent question. - You don't know? - I thought I did there, for a while. And then I realised I didn't. - I know why I'm here. - Good. Let's start there. - We came back in time to get a ZPM. - Right. It was buried with the tape. Why is it so important? I think you were about to explain it, but the batteries on the camera ran out. Long story. Why don't you take a seat? Basically, we got trapped here because you didn't want to affect the time line. But, ultimately, you and you couldn't stand the idea of living out your lives under Ra's rule without doing anything. We remembered there was a rebellion here. That's how the gate got buried, so we figured what difference does it make if we're involved or not. Unfortunately, we never got to execute the plan. - We heard. - Yes, we tried to do too much too fast. Since then, Katep and I have been building up an underground movement. I assume things don't go well cos if you're here, the future still needs fixing. - Something like that. - We didn't just see the tape. We saw the tablet. What tablet? The one you haven't written yet, and put where the Stargate was supposed to be. - Supposed to be? - In our time line, the rebellion works. Ra ends up leaving and Earth is freed, but Ra takes the Stargate with him. - OK, that's a problem. - Yes. The gate is never found at Gîza, and none of us join the Stargate programme. But you left a tablet in an obscure Egyptian dialect, telling us the rebellion date and where to find the second Stargate in Antarctica. Good for me. So you're here to make sure Ra doesn't take this Stargate. - It's a plan. - They're near! They're near! - Jaffa. - We must hide. Where? In here. Sweet. Kree, lok nel. We've got secret stores of weapons in several positions throughout the region. - How many troops? - Couple of thousand. That's not the issue. According to you, my account of history says we win. We need to make sure that the gate stays here and gets buried. - We'll have to steal it and hide it from Ra. - It's in the open, close to his ship. Holding such a position against a Ha'tak would be virtually impossible, - even for a short period of time. - Also, the gate is heavy. And we also have a ship. Yes, but, you see, the ship fits in the gate, not the other way around. There has to be a way that we can cable the gate to the ship, fly it out. But we still gotta get close to it without being detected. That's easy. The ship has a cloaking device. It makes it invisible. - You're telling me this now? - I was sure I mentioned it on the tape. If we time our approach to coordinate with the uprising, we may yet have a chance. We need to test the cloak. We took a lot of damage coming out of Chulak. - Because we didn't know about the cloak. - I was sure I mentioned it. They are gone. You ever wonder what your life is gonna be like in the future? It won't really be my life, will it? No, but still. I've led such a small and unimportant existence, I can't ever imagine being a hero who saves the planet. Well, we do have a time machine. We could go check it out. No way. We have already screwed up enough. Once we're done with the gate, we need to destroy the ship. - Seriously? - Absolutely. You mean we have to stay here? I wonder if the future me has a boyfriend? - So what do I do? - Um... Try thinking invisible. OK. How do we know if it's working? Nope. Your strategy is good. But it does not work well as a distraction in our plan to steal the Chaapa-ai. - We know this plan works. If we alter it... - We may fail. With this plan, the uprising succeeds and Ra leaves. And Ra takes the Chaapa-ai. If we are to be successful in keeping Ra from taking the Chaapa-ai, we must focus the efforts of the rebellion on distracting him from it. Trust me. - How's it going? - I've never seen this kind of technology. You're supposed to be a genius. That's why I brought you along. I'm working on it. I think the power relay was overloaded. I may be able to reroute the circuit to the control interface. What? It's just a little weird, hearing that kind of stuff come out of someone so... - So what? - Hot. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. It's just... You're not the kind of guy that I usually attract. - No? - No. God. Wow. - This is kind of awkward. - Yeah, it's gettin' there. I'm kind of attracted to Daniel. What? Really? Sorry. No, that's OK. No problem there. It's just, you know... First impressions, I kind of thought he was... Never mind. Carter, how's it going in there? - I think I'm almost there. - That's good. We're about to have some company. They have a patrol on its way here. Try it. Nothing's happening. Hey, guys. We got a little problem here. Carter, forget it. I'm just gonna take off. God. - Now that's not working. - Oh, boy. Try the cloak now. Did it work? Apparently. Shek nok, cree! What? Go, go, go, go. Get down. Whoa. - This could be a problem. - You think? If they penetrate the hull and hit the engines, the blast could feed... - Carter! - We could explode! - Daniel, Teal'c. - We're almost there. Oh, boy. - This doesn't look good. - Indeed. It is ironic. It started cos Sam didn't want to take the jumper from the Jaffa patrol. - God! - Look, if we don't make it... Wait a minute! You said you liked Daniel. I lied. I just wanted to get to know you better. See, usually I'm a very cautious person and I tend to think things... Jaffa! Hear me. Ra is not a god. You can live free. - Ka kek, shol'va! - I don't think he bought it. Relinquish your weapons and surrender. Kal tek trey lo tonak. Yeah, I thought you'd say that. Shal tek! Sam and Jack, it's all clear. You can come out now. In a minute. I can fix that. Jack, you should say something. College football is played on Saturdays, pro on Sundays. And there are no fish in my pond... at all, where I fish. I think that covers it for me. Is that correct? - If it is, we don't do anything? - Nothing we did affected the time line. - But we didn't do anything. - Not yet. Apparently we were going to, two weeks from now, but now we don't have to. Excellent. That's it. I like it. - I'm gonna get this to the lab for analysis. - No. I'll take it. There's a whole room full of geeks up there just dying to get their hands on this. You've got packing to do. - This is great. - I told you. I can't believe we didn't do it years ago. Yes, well... Let's not dwell. Didn't that tape say there were no fish in your pond?
