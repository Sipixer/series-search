the ultraviolent story of Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar staring Vincent Chase in a fat suit and bad makeup that makes him look like the lovechild of Jiminy Glick and a case of twinkies. Now at last year's Cannes film festival</i> Medellin <i>from wunderkind director Billy Walsh</i> was all the buzz until people actually saw it</i> at the now legendary Hindenburg of a screening</i> which I myself attended. Now I usually try to keep my opinions to myself</i> until we actually review a film on this show,</i> but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob.</i> I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some.</i> This is the silliest thing to come out of South America</i> since the musical Evita. It's overacted,</i> it's underdirected, it's paced like a snail.</i> - <i>Did I mention it's long too?</i> - <i>You did. It is.</i> The year is young, but this is a good bet</i> for my top 10 of the year's worst.</i> And by the way, Vince, Al Pacino called.</i> He wants his Scarface accent back. It's a real disappointment for me because I had Vinnie Chase</i> on my list of stars to watch in 2005.</i> I think I'm gonna have him on my list of stars to watch fade in 2008.</i> - Suck it, dickbag! - <i>With a budget I cannot imagine,</i> is a straight to dvd release, if you can believe it.</i> It can be found at-- Sorry, E. It's okay. Not like I wasn't expecting it. Still, once you hear it coming out of their mouths on tv about you personally, it stinks. I remember crying myself to sleep when Roger Ebert singled out my performance in <i>License to Drive</i> as the end of the golden age of cinema. Oh, baby, fuck critics. What do they know?</i> Nothing, baby. Nothing. Will you mind telling me when someone else is in the room? - <i>Sorry, E.</i> - That's okay. I just like to know you're there. How's France? It's lovely. When are we gonna see you again three dimensionally? - <i>Soon, I hope.</i> - Not soon enough. Oh, baby. I Miss you, baby. I Miss you too, baby. I'm gonna talk to E for a second. I'll check back in after I wash up. Okay, baby. I love you.</i> I love you. - <i>Chirp.</i> - Tweet. What? Like you never had a long-distance relationship? Not one with bird noises. Whatever. I'm gonna get some sleep. I need my beauty rest. I'm shooting the <i>Five Towns</i> poster tomorrow. Unless you want to pound some whiskey and talk. Nah, I'm fine. I just hope Vince is okay though. Poor baby bro. Are we ever gonna get to use the bed? Come on, honey. There's nothing wrong with the hammock. Hey, Ari. Fuck Richard Roeper. - Michael phillips is a dick. - Yup. - I liked Gene Siskel. - Whatever. Give me something good, Lloyd. First draft of my letter to one Richard E. Roeper reviewing him personally-- His clothes, his hair, his nasally midwestern twang. - Screw Chicago and-- - Attention everyone, please! Listen up. No one mention Richard Roeper again. Not today, not ever. By doing so, you are simply announcing that on Sunday nights instead of doing your job reading scripts, you're watching tv. the next person to mention Richard Roeper will be fired. And, Lloyd, you will also be fired if you don't answer the fucking phone! Ari Gold's office. - I liked <i>Medellin</i>, Ari. - Then you're a fucking idiot. Carl Urtz on one. Everybody get to work! Carl, my man. How you doing? I saw your trailer last night. Very very scary stuff. Makes <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i> look like <i>Free Willy</i>. I saw Roeper last night. Fuck Richard Roeper. You know, I went to college with him.</i> When we was pledging we used to tie beer cans around his nuts and make him walk across campus. I think last night was payback. - I've been thinking about Vince. - Oh yeah? For <i>Danger Beach</i>. I thought you had Emile Hirsch. No, we don't. Have you read it? - Despite the title. - It's a working title. Listen, I read it. It's good. It's good. - I want to sit down with Vince. - He's in mexico. Yeah, I heard he's hiding out on the beach somewhere, huh? Think again. He's doing improvised readings with Cuaron and Del Toro till something pops. I'm not messing around, Ari. I want Vince for this movie. Carl, if you think you can get Vinnie Chase, the star of the highest grossing movie of all time, at a cut rate just 'cause you think he's in a rut-- Ari, I love Vince. I've always loved Vince. How many things did he turn me down on? - One or two. - <i>Six, but who's counting?</i> I'll pay his full rate. - Is this an offer, Carl? - As soon as I sit down with him. Listen, I gotta go to Greece on Wednesday, which means I need to see him tomorrow at The Grill for lunch. See if you can make it happen. I'll do what I can. Get E on the phone right fucking now. The murphy group. Can I help you? Just one second, please. Just don't tell him the script sucked like you did last time. Yeah, but it's not funny. 'Cause it's <i>Cold case</i>. It's not supposed to be funny. - Leave the comedy for the stand-up. - All right. A Mr. Ari Gold's on the phone. Tell him I'll call him back. You trust me? Soon as I get a job, then I'll trust you. It's been three months, you've had four screen tests. You're gonna get a job soon. You got to tell my mom this. She's the one killing me. Mr. Gold says it's urgent. Will you put him through, please? Sorry, Charley. Well well well, long time no hear. You got Bea Arthur answering the phones for you? - I'm in a meeting. What do you want? - Ah, yes. The Murphy group doubling in size the past five months to two clients. - I have three clients. - You do? I mean, I thought I was your only client. Besides the guy on the wall. You're the only one that matters, Charley. - What do you want, Ari? - To bring our boy back from the abyss. - How are you planning on doing that? - Already in motion. We got an offer. - <i>You got an offer? For what?</i> - Danger Beach. - I thought it was Emile Hirsch. - No, Vincent Chase is doing it. Wow, you really are in the business. You read it? Oh yeah, I read it. I liked it, except for the dumb title. It's a working title. - Are they gonna pay him? - Wow, all about the money these days. Makes me proud and yet a little sad that you've lost that prepubescent boyish charm. Yeah, they're gonna offer him his full quote. Come on. That's unbelievable! Well, start believing and start breaking out your best travel agenting skills because we need him here by lunchtime tomorrow to have a meeting with Carl Urtz. What kind of meeting? Carl wants to see if his eyes are still as blue as ever. - So do we have an offer or a meeting? - We have an offer pending a meeting. An offer pending a meeting is not a fucking offer, Ari. How long have you been in this town, Opie? An offer pending a meeting is what you get when you make a shit movie and haven't been seen this side of the border in six months. We're living in a post <i>Medellin</i> world. But amazingly enough, if Vince shows up with all of his limbs intact and doesn't have some sort of seizure in front of Urtz, we are back in the game. Okay, you'll call? Hey, I've got to roll, man. Yeah, Ari. I'll call, I'll call. Good luck, Charley. What luck? You got to take me. I don't have a car. You've been in LA six months and you don't have a car? I can't afford a car, all right? Get me a job, then I can get a car. Let's go. We gonna outdo last year's poster, Johnny? You know it, son. You know it. So I told the mofo nobody upstages Johnny Chase. Okay, perfect. That's perfect. Johnny, switch partners with Ron and take Linda now. No problem. Beautiful, I love it. Okay, spin her again. As you wish. Could <i>Dancing With the Stars</i> be next for us? Beautiful, beautiful. Okay, now some more serious stuff. Everyone just give me a left side pose. Beautiful. Lovely. Lovely. Everyone give me a right side pose. Johnny, you want to turn to the right? - Uh, no, not really. - Oh god, here we go. - Why not? - 'Cause actually, I don't go right. - What do you mean? - I mean I don't go right. It's my bad side. Everyone knows that. - I didn't know that. - Have you ever seen the show? No. But I'm in Europe a lot. Well, we've done 54 episodes and I've never gone right. Even if we do 500 more I never will. Come on. Let's just get this done. Let him shoot you without a padded bra, Linda, - then I'll let him shoot my right side. - I really don't see the issue. You don't see this right here? Maybe we should call the producers. Maybe we should. Okay, people, let's take a break. Go ahead, call the producers. What, is this guy threatening me? They know. Eddie Burns knows. Everyone knows. Shooting me from the right makes me look... Freakish. - The life, huh? - Oh yeah. - Anyone hungry? - Getting there. Could we make it to the beach-side fiesta? When you put it like that, who could say no? Yo, Vin. It's the real world calling. - Ma? - E. - Really? - Should I answer it? Yeah. Yo, E, what's up? How's your office? Any of your wannabes touching my shit?</i> Your office has remained untouched. And I'm sure it will continue to be. Let me talk to Vince. Not if you're gonna rain on our parade of pussy. - Put him on the phone, Turtle. - <i>Vin, talk to E.</i> - Yo, E. How goes it? - <i>Great.</i> We got a project for you. No hello? No how are you? Sorry about that. How are you? - <i>How do I sound?</i> - You sound good. - I am. - <i>Good.</i> - How are you? - I'm good. Good. - What you got? - A cool genre movie. The producer wants you. Could you come back and meet him? Sure. Send the script, we'll set up a meeting. - It's got to be tomorrow. - Tomorrow? What's the rush? I'd have to leave right now. You can't leave before the fiesta. - I can't leave now. - It's a really good script. - Yeah, what is it? - It's called <i>Danger Beach</i>. - It's called <i>Danger beach</i>? - Sounds stupid. - It's a working title. - What do you think, girls? Should I do a movie called <i>Danger beach</i>? - Don't think so. - Nobody here likes it. - It's a working title. - Yeah? Well it's not working for me. - I'm getting hungry. - <i>Vince, you got to trust me.</i> I do trust you, E. And I love you and I Miss you.</i> But I'm not going back right now. Not on a day like this. Not when Maria's cooking. She cooks like you wouldn't believe. - Hey, I cook good things too. - Course you do. I got to go. I'm being rude. - Okay, I'll talk to you later, E. - Bye. Later, sucker. Look, man. Don't worry. I'll carry the Murphy group. What do you mean he's not coming back? I mean, you want me to say it in Spanish? Why do I have 300 clients and you have two and you don't seem to care that one of them is retiring in his prime? What is it you think I can do, Ari? - You two have a little rift? - What? Playing the <i>Medellin</i> blame game? Let it go like a bad piece of pussy. Just forget that you smelled it and move on. If he passes on this thing now, he might as well be Cat Stevens doing butterfly strokes in the Caspian Sea searching for Mohammed. 'cause that's how he's gonna be viewed in this town. I spoke to him. I know him better than you. He's not coming back. Then we're going to him. Drama's the only one who knows where he is. Call Drama and meet me at the Van Nuys airport in 40 minutes. Really? Are you supplying the plane? That's how much I care. - How'd it go? - Shitty. - I'm sorry, buddy. - No, man, I let you down. You didn't. We'll get 'em next time. Don't worry. - Do me a favor though? - What's up? Drive me to the airport. Take my car for the night. Shit, fuck the audition. Let's roll. You see what I'm talking about, right, babe? I look awful from this side. I wouldn't say awful, but I see what you're saying.</i> - You're the only one who gets me. - <i>Just let them shoot you how they want</i> and if it doesn't look good they won't use it.</i> Baby, I love your naiveté, but you don't get this town. You've got to cover your own ass 'cause no one else will. They can say what they want, but I know the reason I got recast for the <i>Models Inc.</i> pilot was because the director kept shooting me from the right side. That's why test scores said teenage girls were scared of me. But how can anyone be scared of you? Shit. Who is it? It's Tommy. They got Ben Silverman coming down from his office. You better get your ass out here now. Jesus, the network chairman is coming down right now. - <i>Just do what he says, Johnny.</i> - I can't do that, baby. I struggled for 20 years to get to where I am. I'm not gonna let them force me to looking stupid again. I won't do it, no way. Tommy, thanks. But you tell Silverman I'm not doing it. Not for him, not for no one. Johnny, you have me so worried. Hold on one second, baby. One second. I need to know exactly where you sent Vince to in mexico. No go. It's a hideaway. Vince said nobody gets to go unless he says so. - He's coming. - I can't talk right now. It's an emergency. An emergency? Is baby bro in trouble? Yeah, kind of. I'm on my way. Baby, I've got to fly. Vince is in trouble. I'll call you back in two minutes, okay? - Tweet. - Chirp. - Johnny Chase. - Mr. Chairman. Shoot me any way you want. I've got to get to Mexico. Fucking waste of time. I could use another shot if you guys are gonna do this. Boss, the plane. The plane. How many times you gonna do that joke, Turtle? Till it don't get a laugh, baby. Come on, Carol, that was funny, right? Fresh air. - Oh my God. - Jesus. - Look at you. - E, what's up, bud? - Nice suit. - I love it. Good to see you. You must be really desperate to come running down here. Listen, the producer Carl Urtz, six for six. I know Carl. He makes 'em for cheap and they make big bucks. It's a perfect way to come back strong, on a movie the genre already has a built-in audience. Is there any kind of role in this movie? One that requires me to act? The same kind of role Shia Labeouf had in <i>Disturbia</i>. You look scared a few times, smile so girls want to fuck you and laugh your way all the way to the next <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. Sounds challenging. Listen, we need to get the 18-25-year-olds back. The ones that have forgotten you exist. They've forgotten that I exist? Don't take it personally, bro. The whole country's on meth. - So what do you think, Vince? - I don't know. I don't feel like running back right now for a non-challenging career move. We're having a good time here. Even Turtle's getting laid. Yeah, a lot. It's vacation pussy. Anyone can get that. You see these girls back in the states, they won't even look your way. I think you're arguing against our point there, Drama. Look, we are desperate. We haven't had an offer in six months. - You guys are starting to sound alike. - Starting to look alike too. Vinnie, listen. What happens if another offer doesn't come in? It may not. What then? What if one doesn't? You think I'm gonna suffer? Come on. Look at this place. I live like a king for $79 a day. I got great food, fantastic women, and I wake up every morning with a big fat smile on my face. Look at you guys. Fighting the rat race. Wearing uncomfortable shoes. Angry all the time. Life is not all about making money and movies. At least mine isn't. Ari, it's siesta time. It's time to chill. We'll talk about it over dinner. - We're not staying for dinner. - I know. You should stay. The food's real good. But know if you do stay, you guys are sharing the hammock. Vince, can I talk to you alone for a second? Is it gonna be another one of your famous pep talks? Call it what you want. Two seconds, come on. Excuse me, ladies. You really want to go out on the bottom? - Bottom? - Yeah. Medellin sucked and the whole world knows it. You disappear now that's all people are gonna remember you for. When did I ever care about what people think? All right, maybe you can go out like this, but I can't. I'm the one that found <i>Medellin</i>. I got to spend the rest of my life thinking I ruined my best friend's career 'cause I couldn't make it good? I know how good you are, Vince, and I know you got big things ahead of you. You've done everything for me, but you've got to do one more thing. Help me let you get back to where you were supposed to be. Then you can retire on any beach you want and you won't have to worry about me killing myself. That's a pep talk? All right, E. I'll go for you. Thank you. Hey, Ari, get the plane ready. We're going home. Wait wait wait, I need an hour. Carol, I'm leaving tonight, baby. You need to shave. - My face feels weird. - I feel you, bro. I felt like an amputee when I played that high school swimmer with alopecia back on "7th heaven." Vince with alopecia would still look better than you. This script is not that bad. Stop reading and driving before you kill us. Sorry, I picked it up this morning and I couldn't put it down. It is good. You were right. - Real dumb title though. - Real dumb. Reminds me of a Hitchcock movie. What do you guys think of <i>M Is For Amnesia</i>? I think the tropical sun melted your brain. - No good, Vin? - No good, Turtle. - What about <i>High Tide</i>? - I like that. - It's pretty good, actually. - See? I have a purpose here. What's yours, Drama? It's my day off. Get off my ass. - There he is. - What are you doing here? - Moral support. - I told you I don't need any. - Well, I'm here just in case. - It'll be fine. Tear it up, baby bro. Tear it up. You're back, Vin. This is what you losers do all these years? You wait? Sometimes when I'm alone I do that. I'm going back to the office. - Later. - I got girl on girl too, Ari. Will you roll up the window, you idiot? Look, Vincent Chase. - I thought he was dead. - Only till he's alive again. - Oh Jesus - - What? - So, Mexico, huh? - It was phenomenal. I'm more of a Caribbean guy myself. Lot of history. So, <i>Danger beach</i>. I have to say, I read it on the plane and it is really really good. - You sound surprised. - The title threw me at first. But, it's a unique story and this character is better than I've seen in a long time. Fantastic. And you know we're working on the title now. What do you think about <i>High Tide</i>? High Tide. I like that. I like that a lot. - Hi, Carl. - - It's got a-- Adam. Nice to see you. You know Vinnie Chase. - I do. I used to represent Johnny. - Oh yeah, that's right. - Crazy running into you here. - Indeed. Always good to see you, Adam. Guess I'll talk to you soon. I guess so. He seems angry. He's an agent. They're all pricks. Ari gold's office. Really? Interesting. - Adam Davies calling. - For me? If you need a kidney, Adam, I'm not willing to donate. But I'm willing to watch you slowly die if you're looking for that. - You lost your touch, Ari. - Oh yeah? How's that? Urtz doesn't want Vince. You were set up. He was just trying to force me to close Emile Hirsch</i> at $2 million less than I wanted. Explain to your client that you dragged him back here for nothing. - I'm gonna skull-fuck you, Davies! - You just did, Ari. - What did he want? - Fuck you, Yoko. Get E on the phone. - I will beat Carl Urtz's ass. - Will you calm down? No, no calm. Let's go to his house and beat him in front of his kids. I know where he lives. I used to drive him home from softball. I still see him at the rub and tug every now and then. - You have a girlfriend. - I go there for facials, asshole. - Come on, let's go kill Urtz. - Guys, will you stop it? I appreciate the backing but no one's killing Urtz, all right? You should kill me 'cause it's my fault again. Shut up. You couldn't have seen this coming. Nobody could have. And you didn't push me into "Medellin." We did it together. - Well, thanks. I appreciate that. - Although you did approve the makeup. The guy said it was gonna look good on film. How am I supposed to know? It didn't. Oh boy. So what now? Back to Mexico? - Are you out of your mind? - I'm not going out like this. I thought you don't care what people think? - I care a little. - You're gonna be bigger than ever. You're gonna take back the throne. If I made it back, so can you, baby bro. Thanks, Johnny. It's right here. Kill the lights. Kill 'em. - What are we gonna do? - I'm gonna golf, you're gonna caddy. Five iron. The maserati, really? It is nice. - What are you, the godfather?
