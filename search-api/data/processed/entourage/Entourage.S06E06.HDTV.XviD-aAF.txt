- Because you know my uncle doesn't like you! You know what he'll do! Let me worry about your uncle. You just worry about me. Don't look, turtle. It's gonna be over soon. Oh, jesus. You know when they say a guy can never bang his girl again After he watches her give birth? That is what this is like. Okay, and cut! Cut the rain. Beautiful. I want to do a lighting change. We'll pick this up in 30.</i> You're gonna do more takes? I'm sorry. I just thought you had it. All right, everybody. We've got 30 minutes. - Hey! - How was that? - Fantastic. - That wasn't so bad, right? That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Stop it. Eww! It's like you just kissed me.

You just kissed me again. - You're gonna get hit, drama. - Go ahead.</i> Don't break your hand on my pythons. - Yo! - Yo, e, where you been? - You missed everything. - Sorry, rough night. Why? What happened? Where can I get some coffee? You called ashley sloan and you weren't even in mid-fuck? Oh, that's the worst. That's why I always stick with "yeah, baby!" Whose name would you accidentally call out? Vince's? - So how'd you cover? - I told her she was hearing things. - Jesus. - I bet she took that well. - Yeah, she left. - Who wouldn't? - Why didn't you chase after her? - 'Cause he loves sloan. - Ah. - Why else would a sober man Who isn't about to come do something so stupid? I was distracted thinking about the job. I wasn't expecting an offer to come so fast Or how vince would feel about it. Hey, don't blame me. I feel fine. I think you knew you wanted the job. You just didn't want to be sloan's bitch. He's already vince's bitch. It suits him. I appreciate that, turtle... from one bitch to another. I am no longer a bitch. After today, I am a college man... If I could focus. Relax, turtle. Your girl is in good hands. Just send her back as untainted as possible. I've gotta go. Yo, e. Do you want to hang before your meeting with murray - Or should I go with turtle? - Nah, I think I'm gonna go talk to ashley. - You mean sloan. - Funny. - So what are you going to say to her? - I don't know yet. - Let me give you some advice. - Oh, please do, drama. I know you like to think of yourself as honest abe and all, But in this situation, lie like a mattress. What are you doing, buddy? I'm waking you up with my mind. Good work. - What time is it? - It's late. Shoot. Daddy, you almost said shit. Baby. Baby, please. I'm sorry. What do I got to do for you to forgive me? - Not get me a car. - It's nice, though, isn't it? - It's insulting. - Baby, I ache. I haven't been able to look left in days. I can't work. I can't sleep. - It's cold down there. - Oh, what a shame. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you. Listen, from here on I swear If one of my friends so much as jerks off You're gonna be the first to know. - I appreciate that. - So you forgive me? - I'm thinking about it. - When I was in college I got drunk and passed out. Mike young teabagged me and took a picture of it. I've never told anyone. Where's the picture? I've offered millions for it and been turned down. - I forgive you. - So I can get back in bed? I just made that bed. I'll remake it. Come here and punish me. It is a very nice car. - Oh. - What are you guys doing? Um, daddy lost his contact lens. - We're looking for it. I think it's over here. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. You guys are gross. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I come in for a second? - I was actually just about to run out. - I just need one second. - Okay. I wish you would've called. I've got just a million things to do. - Well, I just wanted to apologize. - For what? - Well, I'm sorry I called you sloan. - Oh, you did call me sloan? - I thought I was hearing things. - Well, you weren't, so... 'cause that's what you told me last night... that I was hearing things. I know what I told you. It was embarrassing enough that you said it, But you made it worse when you tried to convince me that you didn't. Well, I'm sorry. - Why were you thinking about her? - I don't know. Probably because she called the day before. Well, why did she call? What did she want? I have no idea. You were right there. You heard the whole thing. I heard your side. I really hate being put in a position - To be a jealous freak. - You're not. - But I just want to know. - What do you want to know?</i> Have you been with her since you've been with me? - Have I been with her? - Have you slept with her, eric? - Come on. - What?!

I don't know. - I don't know if I could ever... - andrew! There was a time when marlo made you smile. Remember that time. Remind her of it.

Andrew, go home. You have no other options. Hey, ashley. It's me again. Listen, I'm freaking out a little bit. I just... I don't really under... Understand where you went. Would you call me, please? Eric, fuck off! I think my girlfriend just told me to fuck off. - Ouch, bro. - Yeah.</i> Hey, eric, did you meet the incomparable steve nash? - We were just getting acquainted. - How are you doing?

Your parking. - Murray, always a pleasure. - Indeed. - Eric, good luck with your girl. - Thanks, buddy. - Let me show you around. - Steve nash, huh? We represent a lot of athletes. - You like football? - You kidding? I love football. Maybe I'll take you to the super bowl this year. - How's that sound? - Sounds great. Come on, you're an actor. Why so shy? Put the camera away, please. God, I'm creating art here. Are you not an artist? I don't do nudity. Well, what if I get a friend over here and then she can tape for us? Uh, no. - Two friends? I can do it. - Still no. You know what? I've got to get this. I've got to get this. Yo, johnny. No. - I lost her, bro. - What do you mean? I was at the commissary watching them eat and they somehow slipped away. She has to do the scene. I'm sure she'll be right back. Yeah, well, I hope so. She's not in her trailer. Hey, jimmy, did you see jamie? I want to run lines before we shoot. She's with coakley. He just called to see if we could push her an hour. - And you said yes? - Why wouldn't I?</i> - Because the guy's a predator. - Why would I care?</i> Jesus christ. This is bad, bro. This is really bad. Uh, what? Christ, it's turtle. Tell him I'll meet him at the car in 20 minutes. - I'm not answering it. - You got to answer the phone, johnny. Hang on. Yo, turtle. All good, all good. - Class good? - Yeah.</i> You sound weird. Everything okay? No no, all good. I just tried jamie. She didn't pick up. I was gonna grab vince and roll back over. No need to do that. Well, I'm gonna do it anyway, weirdo. See you in a bit. Vince. Vince! - Oh shit. Hello? - Don't stop. - Johnny. - We're ready for you, drama.</i> - I'm coming, I'm coming. - Johnny, what did turtle say?</i> He said he needs an hour. Go find something to do. - Uh, okay. - Later.</i> Later. Maybe you should call one of those friends of yours. You know, eric, I really like you. Sloan knows a good thing when she sees one. - Yeah, well... - It's a pity you two aren't still together. We're friends though. We both moved on. How does the new girl feel about your friend putting you up for a job? - She doesn't know. - Trust me, I've been married four times. It's only a matter of time before she finds out. She won't be thrilled. Well, truth is, I'm not really thrilled About my ex-girlfriendputting mr a job either. Well, get over it 'cause all she did was tell me about you. I've done my research and I like you. That's how I work. So what else? Murray, this place is amazing. I mean, this is exactly what I've been looking for... A place with people to bounce ideas off of, Resources, somewhere to feel like I really exist in this town. - And your concern is? - That this is about vince. - You're very insecure. - Not usually. Look, I want vince. Who doesn't? But my business was not built on talent 'cause talent comes and goes. This place was built on the people who work in this office.</i> - So if vince fired me? - You think he would?</i> Well, he has before. The pitfalls of having one client. It's not a great situation. Which is exactly why you need to be here Where they'll be multiple vinces. And should one tell you to fuck off You'd have nothing more than a bad day. I'm worth more than 90% of my clients, eric. Here's my offer. Well, uh... Yeah, I mean, I make more than this now. If vince fired you, you'd make nothing. Here you'd still make that. It's pretty good. And you do good, it'll get better. You want to be a part of something? Yeah, I do. Good, start Monday. - I'm gonna kill it for you, murray. - I have no doubt. Now go home and find out what you did to your girlfriend. Thanks. I'll see you on Monday. - Standby! - You know coakley banged my old girl, right?</i> - Shut up. - I'm serious. Rachel. - Ready to try another take? - Yeah yeah yeah, let's do it. - I don't remember any rachel. - Yeah, this was years ago. I was devastated over it. Didn't really recover till I got this show, Which was dan's way of apologizing. He didn't make me... Would you stop talking about this? This is an important episode for me. Okay, let's roll cameras. Yeah yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Sound rolling, scene 23, take 6. Okay, and background action. Action! Her uncle don't got nothing on me. He's some loudmouthed, wide-bellied... Line! What's that line again? Jesus christ. Let's cut. Uh, johnny, that's like six takes. What's the problem? I'm just having a hard time focusing. Want me to get you some ritalin? No no, I got it. Let's go again. Yeah, let's do it right away. Right away, come on. You really worried about what he's doing with jamie? Hell yeah, he's worried. And he should be. Shut up, brandon. You don't know anything. Okay, let's roll camera. - Okay. - I know it hurt when I lost my girl. Probably would have hurt even more if I lost my best friend's girl. Sound rolling, scene 23, take 7. And action! - I'll be right back! - Drama! I need a ride to studio 8. No, man. I'm sorry, I have to wait for mr. Busfield. - Talent first. - Sorry. So am I. Seriously, come on. Yo, drama. Drama! Hello, mr. Chase. Can I help you? - Where's coakley? - In a meeting.</i> He doesn't want to be disturbed. Me neither, but it's my lot in life. What are you doing here, john? Uh, where's jamie? Uh... Would you give us a second, please? What, do you have some kind of self-destructive career death wish? I just want to know where she is. She should be back on set. I finished with her 20 minutes ago. Did you fuck her, dan? - What? - Did you fuck her? You hitting that, john? No, but my boy is. Which means you better not be. Oh, careful, johnny. You are not a good enough actor to threaten your boss. Yeah well, I'm a good enough friend. - Keep that in mind. - Relax. I didn't fuck her. But I'm going to. 'cause all I can think about now Is how sweet it would be to ram tony soprano's daughter from behind... Big mistake, john. I can have you killed. - Yeah? By who? - The writers. Move out the way, dead man walking. Ashley. I see you in there. Would you just please open up and tell me what I did? What do you want from me, eric? I just want to know why you're mad at me. Because you're a liar and I hate liars. I haven't even seen you since we left. How could I have lied? - It doesn't matter. - Please, I'm sure I can explain.</i> Yeah, I'm sure you can too, And I'd rather not set myself up to look like an idiot again. Ashley, come on. Fine, tell me again what's going on with you and sloan.</i> What? Nothing. Tell me when was the last time you saw her. Where is this coming from? She called you. Said she saw you yesterday. You fucking lied to me and I fucked you after you did. I didn't lie to you. You asked me if I'd been with her and I haven't. Yes, I saw her yesterday by chance. She put me up for this job which is why I'm considering not taking it. But I haven't been with her. I swear on my mother. Yeah, I knew you'd have an explanation. - You're smooth like that. - Smooth? I'm not smooth. Ashley, nobody's ever called me smooth. Please. Eric, just forget whatever this situation may Or may not be and admit you still have feelings for her. - Come on. - Don't be like every other jerk in this town. Here's your one chance to clear it all with me And let me think of you in a good light. Ashley, look, I like you a lot. Do you still have feelings for her? Just answer me truthfully, please.
