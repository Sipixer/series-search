I'M CUTE, DRAMA. ASK ANYBODY. TURTLE, FUNNY GUYS GET GIRLS AND SHE WENT HOME WITH HIM - 'CAUSE SETH ROGEN'S FUNNY. - HE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING YET TO SHOW HE WAS FUNNY. HE'S SO UGLY SHE KNEW HE HAD TO BE FUNNY. - HOW WOULD SHE KNOW THAT? - BECAUSE HE WAS STARRING IN THE MOVIE. IF HE WASN'T FUNNY, THERE'S NO WAY SOMEONE THAT UGLY COULD STAR IN A MOVIE. YOU KNOW, IN SOME ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. - NOT TO ME IT DOESN'T. - WHY DO YOU KEEP WATCHING THIS MOVIE - IF IT BUGS YOU SO MUCH? - HIS UGLINESS IS ODDLY FASCINATING-- ESPECIALLY IN BLU-RAY. IT PISSES ME OFF. IT PISSES YOU OFF?

KLEIN. - WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD? - YOU'RE GONNA KILL LLOYD - AND I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU. - A WIFE SWAP TONIGHT. - HOW'S THE MISSUS LOOKING THESE DAYS? - SHE'S OKAY BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT LIZZIE GRANT. THE JUNIOR AGENT WITH THE GREAT ASS. - SHE OFFERING IT UP? - NO, BUT SHE HAS TWO BIG U.T.A. SHOW RUNNERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW AGENCY. ANDREW, YOU'RE TV. I'M EVERYTHING ELSE. JUST SIT DOWN SO THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE GUY WITH THE "S" ON HIS CHEST. - FIVE MINUTES, OKAY? - DONE. LET'S TALK ABOUT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS-- ARE YOU PUMPED FOR TONIGHT? THIS IS NOT THE NEW "90210" PREMIERE. THIS IS SCORSESE. I AM PUMPED INDEED! OH, A LITTLE HEAD'S UP, THE WIFE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO COME. WHAT?  WHY NOT? THIS IS A COUPLE'S THING. MY WIFE IS VERY EXCITED. - AS WAS I. - WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITH YOU? - WHAT IF YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE MARLOW? - OF COURSE SHE WILL! NO, MARLOW'S A LITTLE INTIMIDATED BY THIS SIDE OF THE HILL. SHE'S STILL A VALLEY GIRL AT HEART. ANDREW, MY MAN, LIGHTEN UP. MY WIFE WILL LOVE HER, TRUST ME. AND WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER AFTER THIS, WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM, AND WE GET TO KEEP ALL OUR MONEY. - OKAY? - OKAY. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO HER. - Drama: YOU'RE JUST DUMB DUMB DUMB. - WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE? THE SECOND YOU HEARD THE "F" WORD COME OUT OF HER MOUTH - YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER TO TAKE A HIKE. - I WANT HER THERE. - AS YOUR FRIEND? - YES. - BULL-SHIT. - I'M WITH THESE GUYS. - WHY ARE YOU TORTURING YOURSELF? - I'M NOT TORTURING MYSELF.

HEY, BOYS, GOOD TO SEE YOU. - I WILL GRAB YOUR SUITS. - THANKS, KELLY. LOOKING GOOD, KEL, LOOKING REAL GOOD! - ( E laughs ) - WHAT? - YOU'RE CREEPY. - ARE YOU KIDDING? SHE LOVES ME. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER EYES BULGE WHEN THE TAILOR WAS MEASURING MY INSEAM. - WHY DON'T YOU INVITE HER? - MAYBE. HER OR YOUR HAND-- TOUGH DECISION. THE TOUGH PART IS I LOVE BEING SOLO AT PREMIERES. E, DITCH THE BUDDY. WE'LL SCOUR FOR PUSSY TOGETHER, BRING 'EM BACK TO YOUR PLACE. DRAMA, I MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE SO YOU AND I NEVER HAVE TO BRING GIRLS BACK TO THE SAME PLACE AGAIN. - YOUR LOSS. - Turtle: WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE GUARANTEED TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT? I MEAN, ALREADY PLANNED AND WITH A NAME ATTACHED. - I'M TAKING SARA. - Turtle: OH, FROM SATURDAY? UH, NO, SORRY, LISA FROM FRIDAY. - SINCE WHEN? - SINCE JUST NOW. I GUESS YOU REALLY ARE THE SEVENTH WHEEL, DRAMA. NO, FORGET THAT. HEY, KELLY, YOU WANT TO GO TO MY BABY BROTHER'S PREMIERE TONIGHT? - SCORSESE'S "GATSBY." - UH, YEAH. - YEAH, OKAY. - GREAT. - GREAT. - ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SHE LOVES ME. I'D BETTER GET SOME RUBBERS. SERIOUSLY, ARI, WHY ARE YOU PUSHING ME TO HAVE A DATE WITH THIS WOMAN? IT'S NOT A DATE. IT'S A MANI-PEDI. I PLANNED A VERY LOVELY WELCOME-TO-THE-AGENCY DINNER FOR THEM WHEN YOU HIRED ANDREW AND SHE CANCELED. TWICE. MAYBE MRS. KLEIN DOESN'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME. - ANDREW THINKS THAT SHE'S INTIMIDATED BY YOU. - WHY WOULD SHE BE? BECAUSE SHE'S VERY INSECURE. AND, HONEY, LOOK AT YOU. I MEAN, YOU MAKE CONFIDENT PEOPLE INSECURE. - THAT IS SO SAD. - I KNOW IT'S SAD, BUT HAVE PITY ON THE POOR WOMAN. - WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU? - BECAUSE... ANDREW IS ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING ONE OF MY BIGGEST EARNERS AND I LIKE HIM. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A NICE COUPLE WE CAN HANG WITH? WE HANG WITH PLENTY OF NICE COUPLES. WE HANG WITH PLENTY OF YOUR FRIENDS AND THEIR HUSBANDS. - YOU DON'T LIKE THEM? - I HATE THEM. - MAYBE YOU'RE THE PROBLEM, ARI. - WHY DO I HAVE TO FIGHT WITH YOU ON THIS? - HAVING A COUPLE I ENJOY WILL BENEFIT BOTH YOU AND ME. - REALLY?  HOW SO? IMAGINE I COULD SPEND THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TIME WITH YOU IN THE MOST FOCUSED AND BEST MOOD POSSIBLE WITHOUT US PRETENDING WE HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER. - ALL RIGHT, FINE. - FINE YOU'LL DO IT? - YOU'LL CALL HER? - YES, I WILL CALL HER. THAT'S SO GREAT, BABY. I GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK. - NEED SOME CASH. - I AM NOT A HOOKER. OH, BUT WHAT A GOOD ONE YOU WOULD BE. I LOVE YOU. FUN LUNCH, DARLING. - YOU HAVE LESS TO EAT. - I JUST MOVED IN. I'VE BEEN WITH YOU TOOLS ALL DAY LONG. US TOOLS WILL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY NOW THAT MY WORK HERE IS DONE. - DID YOU REALLY NEED TO USE MY BATHROOM? - I REALLY DID. - I HAVEN'T EVEN USED IT YET. - DON'T BE SUCH A PRISS. - HELLO! - Turtle: WHOA, I LIKE YOUR NEIGHBORS. - HEY, ASHLEY. - Drama: THAT'S NO NEIGHBOR. THAT'S THAT GIRL FROM THAT PARTY ON BEECHWOOD LAST WEEK-- BLUE DRESS, 34B RACK. - HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? - GOOD EYES. - DON'T STARE, JOHNNY. - Eric: SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? - I TOLD YOU I WAS BRINGING YOU A HOUSEWARMING GIFT. - THAT'S RIGHT-- 3:00. - OH, I CAN COME BACK. - OH NO NO NO. OH, OKAY. HI GUYS. - HI THERE. - HELLO. GUYS, THIS IS ASHLEY. All: HI. UM, SO HERE. IT'S JUST A PLANT. OH, THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT. THANKS. WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE YOUR FRIENDS HERE, - SO I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY. - NO NO, PLEASE, HANG OUT. NO, I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK ANYWAY, REALLY. BUT, LISTEN, ANY CHANCE THAT YOU CAME ACROSS THAT BRACELET WHILE YOU WERE UNPACKING? YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOOKED FOR IT, I COULDN'T FIND IT. - I'M SORRY. - DAMN. WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE? IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. - WE WILL SEARCH HIGH AND LOW. - THANKS. UM, SO, ERIC, DO YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT? UH, YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY VINCE'S BIG PREMIERE TONIGHT. OH, RIGHT RIGHT! THAT SHOULD BE GREAT. - IT SHOULD BE. - YEAH. - ( clears throat ) - OKAY-- WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, I'LL CALL YOU. I'LL CALL YOU LATER AND IF YOUR BRACELET TURNS UP, - I'LL LET YOU KNOW, OKAY? - OH, OKAY. OKAY, WELL, BYE. - OKAY. - SEE YOU LATER. - SEE YOU. - AHEM. - BYE. - BYE-BYE! - SEE YOU. - BYE. GOD, E, ARE YOU AWKWARD! - ( laughing ) - I TOTALLY FORGOT SHE WAS COMING. NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I THINK I'D EVER SEE YOU KICK A LITTLE CUTIE OUT THE DOOR LIKE THAT. - I DIDN'T KICK HER OUT. - SHE WAS BEGGING FOR A TICKET. AND A RIDE ON THE TINY E EXPRESS. - WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE HER A TICKET? - DO WE EVEN HAVE ANY LEFT? WE GOT PLENTY. YOU WANT ME TO GRAB HER? SHE'S CUTE. - NO, I DON'T WANT HER THERE. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO GET THE WRONG IDEAS. - WHAT IDEAS? - LIKE THAT YOU LOVE SLOAN? - ( laughter ) NO, IDEAS LIKE I DON'T WANT HER TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND, WHICH I DON'T! BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND. - YOU REALLY LIKE BEING SINGLE? - YES! MR. RELATIONSHIP'S GOING TO STICK TO THAT STATEMENT? AW, COME ON. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE'S ENJOYING PLAYING THE FIELD. - HE'S ENTITLED. - HE IS, AND IF HE WERE NORMAL I'D BUY IT, BUT HE'S NOT, SO I DON'T. YEAH, ME EITHER. SLOAN TELLS HIM SHE WANTS TO GET BACK TOGETHER ET AND THE FIELD IS SHUT DOWN! SHE WON'T, SO I GUESS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW. YEAH, BUT IF SHE DID, WOULD YOU WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER? SHE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS, SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? WHY DID SHE PUSH YOU TO GET YOUR OWN PLACE IF SHE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS? - BECAUSE SHE'S THOUGHTFUL. - I THINK SHE'S SENDING MIXED SIGNALS. WHICH ISN'T GOOD FOR A FRAGILE SENSITIVE MIND LIKE E'S. YEAH, AND SHE DID TRY AND GET HIM DRUNK THE OTHER NIGHT. SO WHAT? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? NOTHING HAPPENED. - Turtle: MAYBE SHE WANTED IT TO. - SHE'S TESTING YOU, E. - AND YOU'RE FAILING MISERABLY. - Others: MM-HMM. - DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET READY? - TAKES ME TWO MINUTES. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, COME ON. - LET'S GO. - ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. - PEACE. - LOOK, IF YOU'RE REALLY DONE WITH THAT, DO YOU MIND IF I GOBBLE IT UP? - ( Turtle groans ) - A) YOU'RE DISGUSTING. B) YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER GRANDFATHER. - Turtle: GREAT GRANDFATHER. - I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. WAKE UP, TOTO. YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. - JESUS, ARI, YOU STARTLED ME. - YOU LOOK HALF DEAD. - I'M AT LUNCH. - STARVING YOURSELF ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE. - I'M ONLY WILLING TO POWER WALK AND WHO HAS THE TIME?15 LBS? --( phone ringing ) ARI GOLD'S OFFICE. OH, MRS. GOLD, HI. I'M OKAY. WEAK, BUT SURVIVING. - JUST A SECOND. - HOW'D IT GO, BABY? - I hate that bitch. - WHAT? SHE'S ABRASIVE, OBNOXIOUS. SHE IS NASTY. ANDREW KLEIN'S READY AND HEADING TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM. - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. - WELL, DON'T-- BECAUSE IT'S A JOKE! - ( ladies laughing ) - WHAT? - WE LOVE EACH OTHER, ARI. - SAY HI.

ARI, YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD? JUST THAT YOUR SCRIPT IS FANTASTIC, YOU ARE STARS AND WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO BE A PART OF THIS AGENCY. - OKAY. - THAT'S A QUICK SELL IF I EVER HEARD ONE. LISTEN, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE MY ABRUPTNESS, BUT THIS IS A WIN-WIN SITUATION, - AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME WITH SMALL TALK. - THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. WE ENJOYED IT. ESPECIALLY EVERYTHING LIZZIE SAID. AHH, SHE'S A SMART ONE, THIS GIRL. WOULD YOU GENTLEMEN BE INTERESTED IN TICKETS TO SCORSESE'S "GATSBY" TONIGHT? I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO VINNIE CHASE FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT JUMP INTO FEATURES. - Both: YEAH. - THAT'D BE GREAT. ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

ARI, WHAT-- NO! MY WIFE IS OUT RIGHT NOW BUTTERING UP YOUR WIFE - SO WE CAN LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. - WHY? - BECAUSE I ASKED HER TO! - YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. ANDREW, YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE YOUR LIFESTYLE AND YOUR CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL. YOU THROW IT AWAY ON SOME 22-YEAR-OLD, YOU'RE GONNA BE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT HERPES. - SHE'S 26. - OH, JESUS CHRIST! GET IT TOGETHER-- QUICKLY. 20 LBS, LLOYD! - ( rap music playing ) - ( laughter ) - WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE? TELL THEM TO LEAVE ME ALONE! - LEAVE HIM ALONE, DRAMA! I'M JUST SAYING THIS IS YOUR COMING-OUT PARTY. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE REALLY GONNA BE PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER - AND YOU'RE WEARING SNEAKERS! - I THINK HE LOOKS COOL AND HANDSOME. I THINK HE LOOKS BLOATED! I BEGGED HIM TO SEE MY COLONIC GUY. UNLIKE YOU, I DON'T LIKE GUYS STICKING STUFF UP MY ASS. OH, THIS IS GONNA BE A GREAT NIGHT! - Turtle: TOTALLY. - I'M SORRY, BUT, E, IF I KNEW YOU DIDN'T HAVE A DATE, I COULD HAVE TOTALLY FOUND A FRIEND FOR YOU. OR YOU COULD HAVE WENT WITH HIM. I'M SURE YOU WOULD'VE ENJOYED IT MORE THAN YOUR CURRENT DATE. - I CAN BE BOTH THEIR DATES. - SORRY, KEL, JOHNNY DON'T ROLL LIKE THAT. I SAY THE MORE THE MERRIER.
