It's time for you to wake up and tell me why you think this is a holiday inn. God. I didn't sleep last night at all. I'm in a daze. I'm sorry I'm in your office, but my couch sucks. - Are you on drugs? - Drugs?! - Coke, dust, smack-- - ari, no! No, I took a sleeping pill. - Or maybe two. - Why didn't youor  take it?

I'll bet he's observing us right now. He's gonna come in and grade us on our vigilance. What do you think turtle's face in a bong'll earn us? An "a" for calmness under pressure. I'm not gonna have to walk around with a giant dude from now on, am I? Ari says we gotta listen to this guy, so whatever it takes. He's all about following orders nowadays. - Hardy-har-har. - Well, it worked for him. He listened to his long-lost love And now he's got a sweet house and a swanky job. - Yeah, but he lost ashley. - Oooh, I miss ashley. - She was spunky. - He should call her. - Ashley or sloan? - Either.

So you use no alarm system at all? Just our trusty attack dog. Well, we'd better reinforce the windows. - With what? - Steel frame around the edges, Bulletproof glass. I don't want anything coming through these. - Nothing gets in, nothing gets out. - What if there's a fire?</i> Get a hose. Vince, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna turn this house into fort knox-- Armored windows, hi-res cameras and around-the-clock Vip otection from the finest trained predators on god's planet. - Is all this really necessary? - Is it really necessary To waste my time with stupid questions? That's not nice. Is that nice? I'm talking a real multilayered security system. We have a specific threat. We have an individual who's already crossed the line. You'll have three to five men stationed here in the house And two will follow you wherever you go. - How much is this gonna cost? - I take a $100,000 retainer And then I'll put together the budget for getting your full system put in place. - Jesus. - Wow. There's 600 grand sitting in your driveway. Tell me what's worth more-- your cars or your head? - I'm not gonna fire him! - Then I will. On what grounds? That he wore his pajamas to work? On the grounds that he is a distraction and a mess. He's having some domestic disturbances. Christ, how many have you had? - Show some sympathy. - I have zero for him, - And zero for you. - I don't need any. Oh yes, you do. Because your failed experiment from the valley is a complete bust. Everybody knows it and look at you! You're still hanging on for dear life! Listen, has the collagen seeped into your brainstem, babs? He is not a bust. He is killing it for us. He is just about to sign aaron sorkin. I've been hearing that for two months now. - Well, today is the day he's coming in. - Bullshit. He's on the books. Go check.

There's no answer. - Did you call his house? - No, ari, I didn't call his house! - Don't get snide with me.

I haven't been hiding it. --Since I did, I didn't think she'd go and get a possible boyfriend. You had a possible girlfriend. I know, and I liked her and I'm not with her because of sloan.

He said he had the keys to my kingdom. He was going to bring me ideas. I was going to hear them. I'm confident I can relay those ideas to you right now. - Mr. Gold! - I'm in the middle of a meeting. - Are you kidding me? - The meeting's over.</i> - I'm just flirting with her. - This is an emergency. - Andrew klein is on the phone. - Oh good, where is he?

Well, what's the point to this? - The point to what? - This!</i> First you want to be friends, then you don't want to be friends, Now you want friendly cocktails. You don't know what you want And I don't want to fuck it up with a girl that I kinda like. - I'm sorry about that, man. Sorry. - E! E! I am doing the best I can. I do miss you, but I just need time.

The young one from the premiere? - She's 24. - Yeah. So that's it? Yeah, I guess it is. Aaron, you didn't really need to come down here.

I could have directed years ago if I wanted to-- He-- he-- he has more actually. You have more, Right, andrew? Uh... Act as if you have faith And faith shall be given to you. - Jesus, that's pathetic. - No, he's quoting me. It's "the west wing," the assassination episode. I had a lot more of your quotes written down And I had a lot of amazing ideas, brilliant ideas, But I couldn't get into my house. My wife wouldn't let me get them. I blew that chance. I blew my marriage, and if I blow this with you, I've blown my career too. I'm sorry, aaron. I drove into my own house for you, aaron, My own... Under-insured overpriced beverly hills motherfucking home. I took my car and I put it in gear And I drove right into my own goddamn living room. For you. Who else would do that? - I'm sorry. - I had a rough divorce too. I get it. We'll give it a shot. - Really? - Yeah, but if he ever calls me, I'm gone. - Oh, don't you dare. - What?  I have to get it. - Why? - Because it could be vince. Vince is a big boy. Come on, I need my eric fix. Listen, vince has a stalker and something might have happened. - Seriously? - Yes. Yo, everything cool? Mmm, yeah, totally. You still with sloan? We're going a little stir-crazy. We're gonna take big yoni out for some fun. - I'm at ashley's. - Ashley's-- how?</i> She's great.
