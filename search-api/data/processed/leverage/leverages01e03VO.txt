LOCAL COPS THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. LOCAL COPS DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A CHECK FOR $2 MILLION. IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T -- OH, NATE, THAT'S PATHETIC. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE COMPLICATED LITTLE GAMES THAT YOU LIKE TO PLAY.

I CALLED MY HEDGE-FUND BUDDIES UP. AND WE'RE GONNA FORM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, ONLY WITH HORSES AND NOT STOCKS. MODERNIZE THE SPORT SO GUYS LIKE BOB GIBSON WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM WHEN NEW YORK MONEY COMES TO TOWN. SO YOU DO ME A FAVOR. HERE'S HOW I CAN HELP YOU. YOU EITHER JOIN THE REVOLUTION OR YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY. SEE YA. GREAT NEWS. NOT ONLY IS FOSS NOT OUT OF THE HORSE BUSINESS, HE'S BRINGING IN MORE MONEY AND MORE PARTNERS. CAUGHT THAT. WORKING ON IT. YOU'RE WORKING ON IT? YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD A PLAN. HE JUST SAID HE'S WORKING ON IT. RIGHT, BUT YOU CONVINCED MY DAD THAT THINGS WERE GONNA BE OKAY. THINGS HAVE ONLY GOTTEN WORSE.

NO LETTERS -- NOTHING! ELIOT, WHAT KIND OF A PERSON DOES THAT? WHAT -- WHAT REASONABLE JUSTIFICATION COULD YOU HAVE FOR JUST DROPPING OFF THE PLANET, HUH? Tell us what you did with the monkey! Where is it? Where is the monkey?! I WAS WORKING. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. HEY, JUST LISTEN TO ME JUST FOR A -- - OH, DON'T START WITH YOUR STUFF. - OH, DON'T. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS. STOP. COME HERE. WHAT ABOUT THAT THING YOU DID IN -- IN KAZAKHSTAN? NO, STERLING KNOWS ABOUT THAT ONE. AND YOU'RE SURE THIS ISN'T ABOUT STICKING IT TO YOUR OLD RIVAL? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH PUTTING THE REST OF US AT RISK. NO, LISTEN, YOU KNOW, STERLING IS GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO TAKE US DOWN, ALL RIGHT? AND HE'S GONNA TAKE WILLIE WITH HIM. SO I-I'M JUST TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME PLAN THAT HE DOESN'T SEE A MILE AWAY - WITH A BLINDFOLD ON. - SAME THING WITH A ZEBRA. - THEY BITE AND THEY NEVER LET GO. - NO, NO, NO, NO. - ???IN THE JUNGLE - HOLD UP.

NOW, ALL THAT INFORMATION IS LINKED ON NUMBERS TO MICROCHIPS IN THE HORSE'S NECK. NOW, WE'LL LINK BALTIMORE'S MICROCHIP NUMBER TO A FAKE HORSE WITH A GREAT BLOODLINE. THEN WE'LL DISGUISE THE WHITE STRIPE ON HIS FACE - WITH SOME PAINT. - NO, NO. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. HIS LUNGS ARE STILL MESSED UP FROM THE FIRE. WELL, HE CAN STILL RUN. HE CAN RUN, BUT FOSS IS GONNA SEE HOW SLOW HE IS. THAT PAINT THING -- THAT'S NOT GONNA HOLD UP IF HE GETS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SCAN THE CHIP. UH... AHH. WELL, WE NEED TO FIND A HORSE THAT CAN RUN LIKE A CHAMPION. WHAT ABOUT THAT HORSE FROM THE OTHER DAY? KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN? KENTUCKY THUNDER? THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN A YEAR LATER, KILLS EVERY SINGLE HORSE. 600 THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSES DEAD, AND NOBODY MAKES ONE CENT ON THE INSURANCE PAYOUTS. THAT IS THE REAL TRAGEDY, MY FRIEND. THEY DIDN'T KILL 600 HORSES. THEY KILLED 599. WHAT? THAT'S THE SURVIVING HORSE. Come on. THAT TIME BEATS EVERY DERBY WINNER IN THE LAST DECADE. HIS NAME'S FEI KUAI, BORN SEPTEMBER 15th.

NATHAN FORD IS A COMMON CRIMINAL. OH. "COMMON"? WELL, THAT'S JUST HURTFUL. I SPOKE TO MY CLIENT TONIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I TOLD HIM? I DON'T THINK YOU TOLD HIM ANYTHING. 'CAUSE IF YOU HAD PROOF THAT FOSS STARTED THE FIRE, YOU'D BE GONE ALREADY. I DON'T THINK YOU'D RISK A $2 MILLION PAYOUT JUST TO STICK IT TO ME. NO, I THINK YOU PROBABLY DID WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO. YOU GAVE YOUR CLIENT JUST ENOUGH ROPE, JUST ENOUGH TO HANG HIMSELF. AM I RIGHT? THIS TIME, NATE... I THINK THERE'S JUST ENOUGH ROPE FOR TWO. THERE'S NO WAY TO FAKE THE NUMBERS ON THAT CHIP. YOU FAKED IT BEFORE. NO, NO, NO. I FAKED THE INFORMATION ON THE DATABASE. OKAY, NOW, WHEN FOSS SCANS THAT CHIP, IF IT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBER THAT SHOWED UP BEFORE -- OH, WE'RE SCREWED. BASICALLY. NOW, EITHER WE CUT THE CHIP OUT OF THE HORSE AND INSERT IT INTO ANOTHER ONE -- OR WE DELIVER KENTUCKY THUNDER. NO, WE'RE NOT A LIBRARY. WE CAN'T JUST TAKE HORSES IN AND OUT AS WE LIKE. KENTUCKY THUNDER'S GONE. WHAT? RACING? WORSE. STUD FARM. - OH. - NO, NO.NO, NO, NO. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET FOSS TO WRITE A $12 MILLION CHECK FOR AN EMPTY HORSE TRAILER.

WE GOT TO GET THIS HORSE. OK, LISTEN. I AM NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE THE REST OF THE TEAM BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE TO YOUR HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEART. IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN OH, AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING TO STERLING? YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING TO THE WORLD EVERY TIME WE HELP SOMEBODY OUT? WE'RE ALL TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING, JUST BEING HERE WITH YOU. IF IT GETS TOO CLOSE, I WILL PULL THE PLUG AND YOU AND YOU WILL WALK AWAY. AND THAT WILL BE THAT. AND YOU -- WHO DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO PROVE TO? MYSELF... YOU ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH. CAN YOU HACK IT? HACK A LOCK? NICE. YOU STILL REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I DO, DO YOU? PARKER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO IN THROUGH THE AIR DUCT, DROP DOWN, AND LET US IN. BUT THE HORSES ARE IN THERE. NO, NO, NO. THERE'S A BACK ROOM. - THERE WON'T BE ANY HORSES IN THERE. - WE NEED YOU TO DO THIS. I NEED YOU TO DO THIS. PLEASE. LOOKS LIKE PARKER'S GONNA HAVE TO CRAWL THROUGH THE AIR DUCT AGAIN. GOD FORBID ANYONE ELSE WOULD LEARN HOW TO FREAKIN' CRAWL ON THEIR STOMACH THROUGH A TINY SPACE. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, PEOPLE. Parker, you realize that we can still hear you. AIMEE... I'VE FOUND KENTUCKY THUNDER. - He's a really, really big horse. - OH, I'M SO SORRY. UH, YEAH, SOMETIMES THEY KEEP HIM IN THERE BEFORE HE GETS TEASED. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A STALL WITH A HORSE THAT'S ABOUT TO BE TEASED! WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, PARKER. Parker, hurry up! SEE, YOU'RE NOT DEAD. GOOD. DON'T BE SILLY. HORSES ARE MUCH LESS MURDEROUS THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. ALAN, WHEN I MET YOU AT THE RACES THE OTHER DAY, I SAID TO MYSELF, "KITTY, NOW, THIS IS A MAN WHO IS GOING TO TAKE YOU PLACES." ARE WE GOING THE RIGHT WAY? DARLIN', I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THESE STABLES. WE'RE JUST TAKING A LITTLE SHORTCUT. STERLING'S GONNA MEET US HERE, AND A FEW INVESTORS ARE COMING, TOO.

BECAUSE I LOST BALTIMORE IN A POKER GAME. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST BOUGHT HIM BACK. AND YOU TRIED TO INSURE HIM FOR $12 MILLION. IN THE PREVIOUS CLAIM, YOU INSURED THIS VERY SAME HORSE FOR $200,000. THAT'S INSURANCE FRAUD. I'M GONNA HAVE TO DENY YOUR CLAIM ON THE FIRE. I THINK YOU OWE THESE GENTLEMEN AN EXPLANATION. I THINK HE OWES US $10 MILLION. WHOA! WAIT! HOLD ON! LET ME JUST -- THIS IS NOT HA-- THIS ISN'T -- WE'RE GONNA -- WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY BACK. DON'T "WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY BACK." YOU'RE ON THE HOOK FOR FRAUD. YOU'LL PAY THE DEBT. $10 MILLION IS ALL I HAVE LEFT. WE'LL SETTLE FOR THAT. LOOKS GOOD. ALL RIGHT. AND, UH... WE GOT YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CASH TO GET YOUR STABLE GOING. $12 MILLION MORE WILL BE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. AND HERE IS... YOUR FIRST HORSE. THIS IS LEGAL? ABSOLUTELY. THE FRAUD INVALIDATES THE SECOND SALE. OWNERSHIP REVERTS BACK TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER -- ME -- AND I'M GIVING HIM TO YOU. I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. NEXT HORSE I GET, I'M NAMING HIM MR. FORD. MR. FORD. WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING A LITTLE MONEY ON MR. FORD. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. ELIOT, ELIOT? YEAH, UH, COU-- CAN I -- COULD YOU GIVE ME, UH -- YEAH, YEAH. JUST -- YEAH. SO... I WAS WRONG. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE. WRONG ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY? YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE THE KIND TO SETTLE DOWN, BUT, UH, I'M GLAD YOU FOUND A FAMILY. TH-- THOSE GUYS? I'M JUST SORRY IT COULDN'T BE ME. * LIVING WITH ME, IT AIN'T EASY * * WELL, I DO IT EVERY DAY * AND SOMETIMES EVEN I * I WANT TO RUN AWAY * BUT THERE YOU ARE * YOU'RE TRYING TO PLEASE ME * AND YOU STAND YOUR GROUND * THAT'S MORE THAN I DESERVE NICE MOVE WITH THE TOURISTS AND THE CAMERA. DID YOU HAVE TO HIDE IN HARDISON'S TRUNK ALL WEEK TO PULL THAT OFF? YOUR CRACK TEAM HANDED ME THAT ONE. A LITTLE SLOPPY, LETTING HER HAVE BATHROOM BREAKS. AND BRINGING KENTUCKY THUNDER'S TRAINER -- WELL, THAT WRAPPED THINGS UP NICELY FOR US. MADE YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT, BUT HELPED US OUT. AND THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU HAD FOSS SIGN HELPED ME SAVE THE COMPANY A PILE OF MONEY IN THE PAYOUT. AND YOU KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE JUST HOW MUCH THEY HATE TO WRITE A CHECK. LOOK... IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SON. NO ONE'S DENYING THAT. SUFFERING DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE YOU A HERO. I NEVER CLAIMED TO BE. YOU JUST THINK YOU'RE ABOVE THE LAW. OH, NO. I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS I PICK UP WHERE THE LAW LEAVES OFF. I'M NOT GONNA BE SO NICE NEXT TIME. NEITHER WILL I. Translated by
