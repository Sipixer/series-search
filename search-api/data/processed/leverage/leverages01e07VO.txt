sync:Óêäì@frs</font> - Thanks - I'll see you. Why does he have to do his business here? What? Doesn't he have a parking lot he can go to? ??? You're cut is 35%. That's what we agreed to. I'm about to bring his check. Like he's gonna pay. Ray, i don't like leaving you alone with this guy. I'll be fine. I'll see you at home. I'm glad we had this little sit-Down, Because i feel i understand your position now. What did you do?! What did you do?! Not me. You. No! What?! No! Look, he came at you. It's self-Defense. This guy's a killer. You're a citizen. It's open-And-Shut. Police! Police! Open that door! Nick, i can't risk it! I got a wife and a little girl! You paid for this place with my money! You owe me! ??? Now...we're square. And we'll take care of your family, okay? Let us in! Open this door! This isn't for negotiation, ray. ??? That was five years ago. Ray still has 10 more years left on his sentence. It's all right, teresa. Can i get you anything? What's going on? - Client meeting. - I can see that. I thought i pick the clients. Who is that crying? That's teresa palermo. Her husband owed money to the mob, And he took the fall for a murder the boss committed. She's a friend of sophie's. I see. Stick around, hardison. We're gonna have a meeting later about how things work around here. This is probably a bad time to talk about christmas, huh? Hey, nate, this is my friend -- Ms. Palermo. Yes. Hardison brought me up to speed. Go on. Please, continue. Well, after it happened, I told my husband to tell the truth. You know, we'd go in the program, start over. But he said it was better like this. That we'd have a cushion. What a joke. Moscone never gave us a dime. We lost the restaurant, our house. Then a couple weeks ago, i saw this in our local paper. Moscone has a big wedding planned for his daughter -- His princess -- While my daughter Only knows her father From the other side of bulletproof glass. It's not right. No. No, it's -- It's not right. But, you know, uh, we're not detectives. And if you want to prove your husband's innocence, There are plenty of agencies i could recommend. Don't you think i tried that? This is nicky moscone we're talking about. They all laughed. Yeah, i think, um, What nate is -- Is trying to say is -- Is what exactly is it that you want from us? The note on the restaurant -- $765,000. I want what moscone promised us -- No more, no less. If i could get the restaurant back, It would give my husband something to look forward to. - Otherwise -- - Yeah. Well, we will discuss it and get back to you. I understand. Thank you. Where did my daughter go? I think she was with parker. Go! 6 seconds! Give it up! Good job. They have nowhere else to turn. Yeah, well, you know, her husband should have thought of that Before he got in bed with nicky moscone. It's mob stuff. It's not the kind of case we take. I disagree. Well, if you disagree and you feel strongly about it, Why don't you write her a check? Maybe i will, if it comes to that. Oh, wow. I really thought you'd get this, nate. Teresa doesn't want to just get paid. She wants the man who destroyed her family to pay. You know, if it doesn't come from him, If he's not hurt by it in some way, Then there's -- There's no justice. Just take the mob out of it. What? Take the mob out of it? Hear me out. Isn't this just a breach of contract? These guys had a deal, right? And your boy, ray, he lived up to his end, But moscone didn't. And for that, there's not a court of law in this world this lady can go to. Which is exactly the kind of case we take. Oh, come on. I don't -- Why teresa? I don't know. Well, her man's gone to jail for 15 years, And she's waiting for him... for 15 years. Do you have any idea how hard it is... to wait for someone? Yeah, okay.Yeah, okay, Let's go rob nicky moscone -- A guy who kills people and lives in our city. Yeah, let's do that. Typical mob mcmansion. They've got the hideous gates, Infinity pool, statues everywhere. How are we gonna handle surveillance? We can't. That thing's a fortress, man. I clocked four armed guards, A tikva security system. That thing's israeli-Made. It's used to protect their military bases. It's unhackable. Oh, and then there's the fbi parked around the corner. Fbi? Where? You see that crappy van that says "plumber"? Did you say "plumber"? That's their cover? Oh, that is so cute. It's like it's 1978 all over again. Listen, you can't just walk into a place like that blind. Oh, yeah, that's true. If we can't get our surveillance the usual way, We'll just have to, you know, borrow somebody else's. Yes? Relax. We're with the bureau. Howdy. Special agent thomas. This is special agent hagen. She's fresh out of quantico. I'm showing her all the hot spots, you know. Uh-Huh. Oh, by the way, We got your memo. We're moving it up the chain. What? Hey. G-Great. Thanks. Well, come on in. Sorry about the heat... and the smell. Huh. How did he know that? Oh, the field guys are always sending memos. They just need validation. This is really the front line in the war on terror... the terror of organized crime. Wow, is this vest lining kevlar? Uh...no. It -- It's rayon. ??? Yeah, it breathes better than kevlar. But i have it in my locker. I wish i could give you a sample, But the bug we planted in moscone's barbecue Is pretty spotty. - The bug? - Yes, sir.</i> - Singular? - Absolutely. Good -- Good work. Good work. You know what? I'm kind of into this. - May i? - Please. ??? ...do any kind of investigations. - Do you have any snacks? - Uh, yeah. I've got a-A meat stick, if you want it. But, um... well, it's half-Eaten. Oh, okay, i see what the problem is here. You're bumping into baby-Monitor frequency. Oh, yeah. Yeah, i thought i heard some crying. ??? See if that clears it up. Yeah. Great. I saw some rubber gloves. What do you do with those? Oh, actually -- We've just been kind of blowing them up and playing volleyball. But, uh, yeah. If we need to... ??? All right. All right. Thanks. Uh, yeah. I got it! There. Oh, yeah. Nice. Thanks for the tour. Come back anytime. All right. Stay strong, brother. - Will. - The shake-Up is coming. Long overdue. You, i... i'll watch for you. I'm the coffee. You're the cream. She smells like jasmine. ??? Okay, i found the server with the moscone surveillance files. Room 718. All you have to do is rip them on my flash drive and run. I don't have to type anything, right? No, just plug it in. It does the rest. All right, 'cause you know i just learned The photoshop thing you told me. I-I know. Baby steps. So i just plug it in. Now, audio files, they can take a little while to run, But, uh, the servers are pretty loud, So that should give you some cover. It's tapes. Wha-- Hold, wait. Did you -- You just say "tapes"? I just said "tapes"! Cassette tapes? Your little thing -- It's not gonna work. But at least you ain't got to type nothing. Hardison, how am i supposed to get out of the fbi offices With a boxful of surveillance tapes, huh? Punch somebody. Oh, i'm gonna punch somebody. ??? - You're welcome. - Was that so hard? Why couldn't you have just done that off the bat? How was it? You try listening to 74-Straight hours Of surveillance of the mob... on a walkman. Okay, what did you learn? Well, first of all, uh, how great "jersey boys" is there. ??? No, what did you learn about where moscone keeps his money? He keeps it in offshore accounts under his wife's name, heather, To protect it from the feds. Can you break the codes? The codes? The codes to the cayman bank and trust, where the cali cartel And the african dictators keep all their dirty money? The ones that moscone changes anytime he damn well pleases? Like, it's -- Come on. Dude, are you kidding me? You know, you're -- You're very negative lately. - Yeah. - And the sass? It doesn't -- Doesn't help. Where -- Where does moscone keep the liquid assets? Okay, i took a number of the daily deliveries His capos make to the house, And i cross-Referenced them with his declared income and his spending habits. I'd say he's got at least $2 million stashed right here. So we're back to the beginning. Um, all we need is a -- Is a way in, right? This guy. I could hit one of the bagmen before they get in. Roll the dice on a big payout. Or we could tunnel from the neighbors. What's going on here? What's -- Uh, he's just putting up a tent For moscone's daughter's wedding. It's happening this weekend. There's a lots of conversations between him and the wife about that. Let's hear one. I am overwhelmed! I need help!</i> Overwhelmed?! You're the one who wanted this huge fiasco!</i> No, no. No. For your daughter.</i> I told you, i don't want people in my house.</i> Yeah, unless it's your skank yoga instructor, by the way.</i> ??? It's a bit like an opera, isn't it? You mean 'cause i want to run away. Well, now, if that isn't an invitation, I don't know what is. Don't walk away from me. I don't see what the problem is. Well, it says, "the bride and groom release a dozen white doves." Yeah? Oh, it just seems like a little bit much, don't you think? It's your wedding, maria. It's a memory. Okay? A precious, precious memory. Mrs. Moscone? Ruby holden -- Peerless events. Your wedding planner. What? I didn't hire a wedding plan-- Oh, your husband hired me. He didn't tell you? He said something about you being...overwhelmed. Oh, well, uh, ms., uh... you can call me ruby. Ruby -- That's cute. How shall i put this? Uh, everyone i've hired for this wedding -- The caterer, the florist, the band -- Is a frigging moron. But i'm gonna have to live with it because the wedding is two days away. And, frankly, i don't see how you can come in And magically fix everything. What are you -- Mary poppins? Well, i do have a little help. Sophie. Where are we at? Huh? I don't know, nate. I think you need to ask yourself that question. You called me, remember? And now we're working together every day. I don't know what you want. And to ask me that dressed like a vicar... you're a very strange man. No, no, no. I meant where are we at with finding the money? Oh. Well, parker says there are no wall safes upstairs. And i'm still looking. Okay, well, keep me posted every 15 minutes. I don't want to miss anything. How are we doing? How's the search? I haven't started yet. Okay, you know, i haven't gotten one answer i was looking for today. What is it that you're doing? What's going on? I'm cutting onion... deveining shrimp, uh, pan-Searing some scallops. I've got 200 people i got to feed, all right? Back off. Okay, okay. Hmm. What, you think the only thing i know how to do is bust heads? No -- Well, yeah. Look, hold a knife like this, cuts through an onion. Hold a knife like this, Cuts through, like, eight yakuza in 4 seconds. Screams, carnage. People are like knives. Everything is in context. Okay, hors d'oeuvres. Yes, ma'am -- Stuffed mushrooms, Pine nuts, kiss of basil, some sun-Dried tomatoes, And... the finishing touch... lemon juice. Does this look like a food court? Does it? I want high-End food -- High-End! What are you... ?? Hey. Just -- Just find the money. That's why we're here -- To find the money. I saw a bunch of people go in the house. You get anything? No, damn sprinkler's on. Imagine if we had bugs planted all over the house. Yeah. They're so far from where i'm sitting. I just think your college friends would prefer to sit somewhere in the back. Heather? Was that you screaming my name? Oh, yes, yes. We're looking at the dresses for the bridal party, And i wanted your opinion. You look lovely. You don't think it makes me look fat? Oh, definitely. I mean, why do you think i had to let out the waist? To make you look less skinny? She... she didn't mean that. Oh, suck it up, cindy. You'll be fine. Actually, i could not agree more. Finally, someone around here who knows what they're talking about. Now much do you weigh, anyway? ??? I checked the library and the maid's room. No sign of the money. Now, we need to focus. We only have one day left before we -- Oh, reverend. Reverend, come in. I'm having a drink with my son-In-Law to-Be. Thanks again for doing this on such short notice. The pastor from my church back in kansas doesn't travel much anymore. Yeah, and the local clergy bowed out Because of certain misconceptions about my business. Oh, well, i'm very happy to do it. No, thank you. No. - Come on. - Okay. Weddings can be stressful. I should really be going. Got to rest up for the big day. Got the bachelor party to go to? No, that was last weekend, remember? We went whale watching. Whale watching. You know what i did before you got here, reverend? I offered him 200 grand to disappear. Yeah, i was gonna eat everything -- The tent, the food, everything. He wouldn't take it. Well, maybe he's not interested in money. Or maybe it wasn't enough. If there's a man without a price, i haven't met him yet, reverend. Not very christian of me, i know. Oh, you and i have more in common than you think. I doubt that. Uh, nick -- Oh, excuse me, father. Uh, our friend from brooklyn's on the line. Um, i've got to take this, reverend. Oh, yes. Of course. Thank you for the drink. What? Hardison, office phone. Get the feed. Well, you tell that bastard</i> If he wants that money so bad, I'll give it to him at the reception, huh?</i> And he better bring maria one hell of a gift.</i> Okay, that means the deal is going down at the wedding, Probably involving all of moscone's available cash. So, basically, we go in. We've got to find the money. Then we've got to get it out under the noses of 200 hungry guests. While we run the wedding? Hey, we find the money, we get out before it starts. You know, i swear, i never understood the lengths people go with these things. I mean, the endless -- You know, The dresses and the endless toasts and the crying. And -- And, you know, it's just -- It's unbelievable to me. And everyone has a role to play, right? And the bride and groom at the end of the day, They go home with a pile of cash. And if you really think about it, The whole thing is just a giant, giant con. Well...aren't you romantic. Yo No way in hell i could ever imagine getting married. I mean, it's just -- It's just a piece of paper. I take it you've never been married. -No. -Ever come close? No. What was her name? It was a girl i grew up with. But anyway,she married somebody else, so... hot damn,what did you do? What did i do? I liberated croatia. Oh, see, now, me,i would have just got fat and started up a comic-Book shop. That's you and me right there. Whoa, uh... it's okay. Here. Zip. Now, i know that you're in charge of the bridesmaids' dresses, But why are you wearing one? A bridesmaid's dress is like an all-Access pass at a wedding. Plus, i kind of said something, and the maid of honor cried. And sophie said i should make it up to her. By looking much, much better in the same dress? Yeah, you let me know how that goes. Hmm, you really think i look good? And now you're perfect. ??I am overwhelmed! Yeah, well, i don't care where you put the trucks, As long as they're not visible from the house. Hold on,i've got to take this. Yeah -- Hold -- Not now. Not now! It's in the screening room. The screening room. Who left mud -- Lourdes, why is there mud on the floor?! Oh. Yeah, i'm listening. Everybody stop what they're doing. Meet me at the southwest corner now. I'll be right down. What is it, sweetheart? What's wrong? What's wrong? Everything. Adam and i wanted something small. But heather said dad needed this to wine and dine his business people. But now i realize,it's all about her! Like your feelings don't matter. Like you don't even exist. Yes. I'm gonna tell you something, and i want you to listen to me, Okay, 'cause i learned this the hard way. Do not put your faith in a man. I know -- What? -Men don't communicate, -So what do we do? We project onto them about us and our lives together. It's all rubbish. We don't know what they want. You want to know what they're thinking about When they're off staring into space, looking all romantic? The job. It's all about work to them. That's all they care about. Yeah, my advice... do not put your faith in a man. What is it? I got bacon on. The butcher is here. Does he have the baby lamb chops? No.The butcher of kiev. Think he'll recognize you? I kill you! Yeah,i think he'd remember me. Okay, well how is it that we know how good "jersey boys" is, ??But we missed this somehow? Whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Tone it down, brother. Okay, first of all, the sass? -It's not helpful. -But you were listening to the tapes. How did we miss this? Why are y'all looking at me? Okay, look,the guest list didn't raise any red flags with the feds. Looks like steve and scott miller arrived. There sure are a lot millers at this wedding. Okay, listen, we have a world-Class killer here who's going to i.D. Eliot, And we are not prepared for this at all. So i am gonna pull the plug. I want everyone to meet me at the van in two minutes. Man. I'm staying. I'm sorry. You're -- You're what? I'm staying. You're staying? Sophie, sophie, it's the butcher of kiev. Have you ever been to kiev? The cake-Maker of kiev would whup all our ass. This is the butcher. Uh-Huh. Is this about fear of the russian mob,or fear of intimacy? Oh, my god. Listen, i made a promise to my friend teresa and i'm not gonna let her down. And that bride in there -- What's her name -- I'm not gonna let her down, either. So you guys can go. I'm staying. I'll do this by myself if i have to. Okay, fine. Sophie, hardison, parker,find the money. Eliot,stay away from the butcher. Uh, me... i have a wedding to officiate. And so, what do our readings today tell us about marriage? Well, it's a union. It's a holy bond. It's a wonderful institution we have in which two people fall deeply in love. It's a covenant. It's a contract. What do we know about contracts? Well, we know they're pretty lousy vehicles for making people happy, I'll tell you that for free. One party feels they're getting the short end of the stick. And, uh, before you know it, people start to lawyer up. And, well, try telling that to someone who thinks marriage is a sacred bond and a covenant. I mean, you might as well explain baseball to a dog. But at least a dog will bring the ball back to you, And you can pat it on its head. ?? Downstairs is clear. That leaves one place where the money could be stashed -- The screening room. Go. These peaches aren't gonna poach themselves, parker. Sorry, emeril. -What was that? -You heard me. Yeah. I'll show you. Bam! I mean, what is marriage? I mean, is it running around rooftops in paris? I don't think so. No. It's pushing a cart around the home depot. We're good. We're good, pal. It's pushing a cart around home depot. That's what it is. It's hard work. Hard, hard, hard, hard work, people. I mean, i mean, you know,some people don't understand how hard a real relationship can be. And some people should consider that other people, You know, they don't -- Maybe they need a little time, You know, before they start dating some people again And -- And -- And start committing and -- And -- And And -- And -- And... but...but luckily, luckily, luckily, Adam and maria -- They don't have such problems. No, because, you know, maria, despite all the fear, And doubt that life brings, Adam, when he looks at you,maria, You know, he knows that you have made him a better man, A better version of himself. And now that he's known you, he can never go back. And, maria, you know that, when you look at adam, Yes, you know you've made him a better man And that he should probably just give up and agree with you. Well, i would like to now pronounce you, uh, man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Um... moscone is leaving. The deal is going down now. I have a meeting tomorrow morning in london and the jet is idling. G4? Do i look like a hockey player? Global express. Eliot, i got the boss and sergei in the dining room. Where are they going? The screening room. Parker, you got the money? Not yet. All right, they're on their way. Get out now. Not an option. In my day,no one would do business at their daughter's wedding. I have deals going on in three different continents right now. I take payments 24/7. The days of credit are over. Well, the ports of long beach have been good to us. My unions got some fat homeland security contracts. And this -- This is just the tip of the iceberg. What?! Where is my money? It was in there! I put the money in myself! Look, get that gun out of my face before i call my guys. Do it. I tell my crew to start shooting everyone in the tent. Starting with the bride. Money gone. Sergei not happy. Yeah, keep a lid on things until i figure out what happened. What's going on? Somebody beat us to the money. They set up moscone to hand sergei an empty briefcase. Who? It's in the screening room. The screening room. Go get me heather's phone. I've got money overseas. This is just a cash-Flow issue. It's business! I didn't do anything when you shot my brother like a dog in that restaurant. -What did you do?! -Not me. You. Nobody wanted a war. But now you cheat us on a payout? I have a green light. Your brother, huh? Look, it was a mistake, okay? Eliot, get to the screening room right now. It burns! Cut him off. ?? ?? Why would heather give up all this just for a bag of money? Well, she didn't. The russians have the money. She just told them where to find it. So the empty briefcase was the excuse sergei needed to kill moscone. The guy's been waiting five years, climbing up the ranks. She gets the fat offshore accounts her husband put in her name. This is the -- You know, the big score. There's no messy divorce, but she's not...here. And... okay. I'll go find her. Yeah. Now i kill you. I can get your money with one phone call. Global economy never waits. Oh! Ooh, you're not the deejay. I was supposed to meet him in here.Shh. Hey,the father of the bride! He's in here! Everybody's been looking for you. You're in so much trouble. Come on, party's in full swing. He's in here! One word,everyone dies. After you. When i look at maria and adam, I feel such a whirlwind of emotions. ?? First of all,i know that she has found her one, true love. Adam is such a great person,such a big -- Uh, hey, hey. Hey, girl. Let's give it up for the maid of honor. You are working the hell out of that dress. Mmm, good god. Um, and now let's give it up for the man that made all of this happen, Moscone, big papa,the duke of the docks, The sultan of sanitation, my man, mr. Nick moscone! Watch out, brother. -Personal space.Appreciate it. -?? It's, uh -- It's time for the father-Daughter dance. So do your thing. Keep dancing. Keep two-Stepping. Now i kill you! ?? It's the lemon juice. You just kill a guy with an appetizer? I don't know. Maybe. ??Ride's here. It's about time. How did you get away from sergei in the screening room? I pretended i was drunk and that we were meeting down there to have sex. Put it in the trunk. This car? Do it. Hardison, we've got to end the wedding now. Get adam and maria out immediately. Hey, people,what's happening? I just got word that there's a storm brewing in the rockies, So if these kids want to make it to kansas by tomorrow, They got to go. Oh, yeah, yeah, look, hey, hey, hey, hey. If y'all don't want them driving through golf-Ball-Sized hail, Let's give them a good send-Off, come on, people. How are you doing? I'm sorry this day didn't work out the way you wanted. It did. You're a dead man. Do you think you scare me reverend? No, i don't think i do. But i think that mr. Moscone's friends here might put the fear of god into you. If you're looking for your people, they're in the kitchen. Please, excuse me. Certainly. Exactly what denomination are you, reverend? I -- Excuse me. ?? Okay, yeah. Where's heather? I got her. Hey, you miserable shrew. You are never gonna bother those kids again. Ever. And you better start brushing up on your russian 'Cause your husband's about to discover you're the one who sold him out. You're not mary poppins. You're a bitch. Ow! That hurt! Nate, i lost her. -Where's my wife? -Your wife -- She's gone. Where's the cash? Yeah,where's teresa's money? Oh, nate, what have you done this time? Ah. Wait for it. Yeah, yeah, i need all new codes for cayman bank and trust, Account number 7187931768. You know all those offshore accounts that moscone has, You know,the ones in heather's name? Well, now that she's blown town, Guess who's on the phone changing the passwords. Can you do anything with those? Oh, i can do everything with them. Wait, wait, wait. I-I still don't understand. What happened to the cash? Oh, the cash. Well... ?? Put it in the trunk. -This car? -Do it. Don't spend it all in one place. So, padre, a wedding's just a big con, huh? I never said there was anything wrong with that. Let's go. This is pretty good, man. Thanks, man. I squeeze, like, fresh lemon juice on it. Cool. Cool. Did you clear out moscone's accounts? I left him five dollars for socks. Meet me at the car. Reverend. Did you find your wife? No. And you know what? Good riddance. On the day my daughter takes her vows, That woman broke her vows to me. I can't think of anything lower than that. "Give, and it shall be given to you. "For whatever measure you deal to others, It will be dealt to you in return." People who break their promises get what's coming to them,mr. Moscone. Thanks, reverend. That makes me feel better. Sure. Please. Take it. Oh, i appreciate it, reverend, but i'm a busy guy. Well, you never know when you might find the time. Surprise!Surprise! Surprise!Surprise! What the -- It's all yours. What?I don't know what to say. Give me a hug. -Oh, my gosh. -Come. Come sit down. I wish ray were here to see this. Wait for it. Huh? Moscone's arrest casts new light on the murder of russian hit man anatoli sirosky, A murder l.A. Restaurant owner raymond palermo was convicted of five years ago. Mr. Palermo's attorneys are already filing appeals. -I thought you couldn't. -How? I didn't do anything when you shot my brother like a dog in that restaurant. Your brother, huh? Look, it was a mistake. Okay? -All right! -Hey! Daddy's coming home. Hot plates! Hot plates! Hey, come on, now! Make some room. Make a little room there. welcome to www.1000fr.Com I said i had a toast. I've got a toast. Cheers. Cheers. Coming home. Coming home. Daddy's coming home.
