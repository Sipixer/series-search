BACK IN COLLEGE, JOE GOT BUSTED ON A SMALL POT CHARGE. NOTHING MAJOR, JUST TYPICAL, STUPID KID STUFF. RIGHT, RIGHT -- BUT IT DISQUALIFIED YOU FROM ADOPTION AGENCIES IN THE STATES, RIGHT? - AND KOREA AND CHINA AND GUATEMALA. - MM. IRINA WAS THE FIRST ONE TO TELL US THAT IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE. -ALL SHE NEEDED WAS... - MONEY. "ADMINISTRATIVE FEES" -- THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLED IT. MM-HMM. AFTER A FEW MONTHS, WE GOT SUSPICIOUS, SO WE FLEW OUT THERE. WE TOLD HER WE'D GO TO THE AUTHORITIES. THAT'S WHEN SHE INTRODUCED US TO LUKA. AFTER THAT, WE GAVE IRINA EVERYTHING SHE WANTED. HOW MUCH MONEY DID SHE TAKE FROM YOU? $120,000. WE HAD TO TAKE A SECOND MORTGAGE OUT ON THE HOUSE. WELL, WE CAN GET THE MONEY BACK. WE DON'T WANT THE MONEY. ALL WE WANT IS LUKA. RIGHT. SO IRINA LET LUKA STAY WITH THE MORTONS FOR A WEEK. THAT'S WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOY AFTERWARDS? DON'T KNOW. A CAR CAME ALONG, PICKED HIM UP, TOOK HIM AWAY. - ARE WE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS, HUH? - SWIPING A KID? YEAH, WELL -- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT WAS A LESBIAN BAR? OKAY, LISTEN -- MONEY, JEWELS, PAINTINGS -- THOSE WE STEAL. BUT A LITTLE BOY? WE HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T GONNA HELP BECAUSE THEY WENT OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. AND OVER THERE, IT'S THE WILD WEST. NO RECORDS, NO PAPER TRAILS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND ONE ORPHAN. HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW THIS KID IS AN ORPHAN? SEE HIM POCKETING THOSE COOKIES? HE'S HOARDING FOOD. THAT BAG ON THE TABLE -- HE KEEPS HIS ESSENTIALS LIGHT AND PORTABLE. HE KNOWS HE'S GONNA BE TAKEN AWAY AT ANY MOMENT. AND THERE, WHEN SHE GOES TO TOUCH HIM, HE FLINCHES. HE'S EXPECTING...

OKAY, SO, YOU'RE LOOKING TO ADOPT A KID, RIGHT? YOU LOG ON TO A LEGITIMATE ADOPTION WEBSITE. YOU FOLLOW ONE OF THE LINKS ON THE SIDE, IT LEADS YOU TO IRINA. NOW, SHE JUST SHOWS YOU A BUNCH OF PICTURES, STRINGS YOU ALONG A LITTLE BIT, AND SHE HITS YOU UP FOR SOME MONEY. YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE THE "SPANISH PRISONER" SCAM. AND THEN SHE HOOKS YOU UNTIL SHE BLEEDS YOU DRY. YEAH, BUT HOW DOES SHE GET THE KIDS? AFTER THE WAR, THERE WAS, WHAT, 100,000 ORPHANS IN SERBIA. SHE COULD BE GETTING THEM FROM ANYWHERE. WHERE'S IRINA NOW? WELL, SHE CLOSED HER OFFICE IN BELGRADE AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH THE MORTONS. HOWEVER...

THIS IS WHAT HE EXPECTS ME TO DO, FETCH SCRIPTS AND WATER? NO. IT'S A TRUST THING. HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH THE GAME PLAN. YEAH, YEAH. I GET IT -- WE'RE A TEAM. A LITTLE MORE THAN A TEAM. I'M JUST SAYING. HARDISON? LET'S GO, MAN. DO YOU HAVE IT? AW, NOT YET. UH, SOPHIE, SOPHIE, WE NEED THAT SCENE. ARE YOU FINISHED WITH IT YET? IT'S IN THE BOX ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. SOPHIE. ARE YOU -- SERIOUSLY, SOPHIE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TWO-PAGE SCENE BETWEEN IRINA AND A BOY. THAT'S STILL THE HEART OF IT. "THE HEART OF IT"? THERE'S LIKE 10 PAGES HERE! YOU HAVE A STUNT. YOU HAVE SPECIAL EFFECTS. "SISTER MAGDA CROSSES AND GETS A LOAF OF BREAD." WAIT, WHO'S SISTER MAGDA? TELL ME YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. OF COURSE YOU NEED THE NUN! YOU CAN'T GIVE IRINA THE DEATH SCENE. WHAT? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT -- WHAT DEATH SCENE? IN THE SECOND ACT. - BUT THE THING IS, YOU -- - WHAT?

SO, DURING THE NATO BOMBING RUNS IN THE '90s, GUNRUNNERS, THEY USED TO STORE THEIR WEAPONS IN HOSPITALS, ORPHANAGES, ANYWHERE THEY KNEW WOULDN'T BE TARGETED. YEAH, SO, NOW INSTEAD OF EVADING BOMBS, THEY'RE DUCKING THE POLICE. IT'S THE SAME STRATEGY. AND WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION SCAM? OH, FRINGE BENEFIT. YOU TAKE A BUILDING FILLED WITH ORPHANS, A BUNCH OF KIDS NOBODY CARES ABOUT, WHY NOT USE THEM TO MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH? NICOLAS SELLS HIS GUNS, AND IRINA GETS A LITTLE SIDELINE. A MODERN-DAY WORKING COUPLE. I RAN HUMPTY AND DUMPTY THROUGH THE USUAL DATABASES. CHECHEN SEPARATISTS. SERIOUSLY BAD DUDES. AFTER READING THEIR BIOS, I DON'T THINK I'M EVER GONNA SLEEP AGAIN. NEVER TELL A CHECHEN HIS SISTER HAS A NICE SMILE. TRUST ME. I RAN THIS THROUGH A TRANSLATION PROGRAM. THEY'RE INSPECTING THE MERCHANDISE. THEY'RE BRINGING THE MONEY TOMORROW. WELL, NONE OF THIS AFFECTS OUR ORIGINAL PLAN. IRINA IS BRINGING LUKA TO THE SET HERE TOMORROW. SO WE GRAB HIM AND WE CLEAR OUT. AND NICOLAS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE PICTURE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ORPHANS? LISTEN, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED. NO, NO, NO. I ALREADY TALKED TO PARKER ABOUT IT. - AND I SAID WALK AWAY. - YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT. WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM THERE. IT IS TOO RISKY. THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE GUNS, MANPOWER, POTENTIAL HOSTAGES. WHAT DO WEAVE? WE HAVE A -- A PROP TRUCK. THAT'S IT. WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE WILL GO HOME, WE WILL FIGURE THIS THING OUT, DO SOME RESEARCH, MAKE A REAL PLAN, AND WE WILL COME BACK. WE'LL COME BACK. BUT RIGHT NOW, THE FOCUS HAS TO BE ON LUKA... TO RESCUE LUKA. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW. I KNOW. HE IS PERFECT. GONNA BE GREAT. OKAY. ??? OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCENE. COME ALONG.
