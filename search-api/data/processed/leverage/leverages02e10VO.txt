High-dose supplements. They give them out at the factory. They work... 15-hour days. So they give them vitamins to keep their energy up... also instead of meal breaks. Sweatshop. The owners of the factory, the Pans, helped her come over to the states six months ago. I want to ask you something. Is Florence here... You can just tell me... It's... Is she here illegally? No, the Pans are very careful. They provide work papers, keep everything just on this side of legal. But once the women are here, they make them work off the cost of their passage. Right, which, takes years because, my guess is they pay them well below minimum wage. And they know because of the language barrier, no one's going to complain. She's afraid if she causes trouble, she'll lose her job. All she wants is to earn enough money to bring her parents over. Now, what about your office? What do you guys do? How come you can't fix this? We're an immigrant-advocacy network. We can provide counsel, but without a formal complaint, we can't do anything. Okay. Well, we can. Now, does... You understand, right? Thank you, Mr. Ford. Yes. Yes. Of course. It's gonna be all right. She's not here, so I... So, what do we have planned for Florence Ong? We're gonna get her enough money to take care of her and get her parents to America. That's not a very big payoff. I want to give you an easy one to start. Why are you here? Sophie said you always meet the clients with her, so I thought... That's something I did with Sophie. The rich and powerful, they take what they want. We steal it back for you. And sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys. We provide... leverage. Season 2 Episode 10 The Runway Job He says he's cool with her, but you know how he is. The way she introduced herself... that was a smooth con. Yeah, but it didn't exactly build trust. Look, we didn't get along when we first started. Eliot, how long did it take before you trusted me? Eliot, you do trust me, don't you? That's not the point, Sophie. If Nate doesn't like this chick, then it's not gonna work. Which is why you've got to get him on board. You need a grifter. The last time one of you tried to grift... you wound up kidnapped by russians. That's this brother right here. We still can't let that go? Listen to me. Tara Cole is the best. I wouldn't have sent her if i didn't trust her. And I know you're gonna love her. So just give her a chance. She is hot. - Very hot. - Hot. Warm? Cold? Why are we staring? Yeah, I'm not saying you should throw her at him. Get him on board. He doesn't always know what's good for him. He doesn't do anything about it. He just lets it walk straight out the door and... like all the way to Europe? Just do it for me. So I don't have to worry about you. Touchdown. I just miss you. - Okay, run it. - Gloria and Russell Pan. Self-made millionaires. They built their fortune off a company that produces cheap knockoffs of the latest fashions. The bargain bin has been very good to the Pans. They got nice car, big house in Brookline. Gloria works the factory floor. She designs all the clothes. Russell, he handles all the accounting and works with the partners in China. Okay, Gloria designs the clothes. Does she have any training? She did a correspondence course with a fashion school. And she subscribes to all the magazines... vogue, instyle, fashion & style. She submitted to "project runway." Last year? Last three years. That's our way in. We're gonna sell Gloria Pan... her dream. Yeah, no, I get it. I mean, the word "con" comes from "confidence," right? So we got to build her confidence, make her think she's the greatest designer. - There you go. - How? How? We need a Caprina. What does that... So he just says things and then walks away? Yeah. You're gonna have to get used to that. Come on, Russell, let's go. "Caprina. Hottest designer in the world." Fabulous look! Over here, over here! This? Don't you love it? It's by Caprina. This? Don't you love it? It's by caprina.</i> Fabulous look! This? Don't you love it? It's by Caprina?</i> So there you have it. Like everyone else, we can't wait to see what surprises Caprina has in store for her highly anticipated fashion show at new England's fashion week. It's Caprina's sketchbook. No designer would be without it. Great. Tell me about fashion week. The big designers use it to launch their new collections, but it's mainly showcases for rising stars. The investors are always looking for the next big thing. Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, Andre V... they all got their start at fashion week. What? Is that mascara? You got on guyliner. And the leather pants? What the... This is... listen... This is fashion-y. If you're Steven Seagal. Don't. Don't. Not everybody can rock the scarf. I was gonna say "Steven Tyler," but "Seagal" works. It's a bold choice, man. I respect it. Tell me this looks eggplant to you! I like the purple, but I need something that will hold up to ruching, yeah? Something, this perhaps! Did you invite Marcel to the show? You know how touchy he gets. Excuse me, is this your... Grazie! My designs, my dreams! For a designer, this is sacred. I know. You are artiste, too? Yes. Yes, I am. I'm Gloria Pan. And can I say, I'm a great admirer. So kind. I'm sure your work is, wonderful, too. May I? Really? Please. So lovely! Such bold use of buckles! I call it "pilgrim chic." Who are you with? Gucci? Dior? I'm independent. We must go. We must talk more. Come to the run-through for my show. I insist. Julian, tick tock. You mean fashion week? Of course. That is why I am in town. That is why all the designers are in town. And bring your sketches. There are people you must meet. Ciao, bella! Okay, she's on the hook. Great. Let's go steal a fashion show. "Steal a fash... " does he always talk like that? You're on comms. You do know I can hear you. Am I all clear? 12 channels, 120 assistants. My logic filter's telling me the traffic is being directed by somebody named Kerry. Go. Oh, yeah, Kerry, this is Leon from parking. It seems there's a George Armani here who's very upset because his parking space is misspelled. What? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Okay, Parker, you're up. Hey, you! Yeah, you. The models are out of menthol, and the green-room water is cold, not room temperature. And that's my problem how? Were you at the morning update? Because I think Kerry will be very interested in who was and was not at that mandatory meeting. Kerry? Mandatory? This morning? Accessing printer. Tell me you have a new guest list. Kerry printed it out in the meeting! I didn't even see this. Listen. Maybe Kerry doesn't have to know about this? Yeah, see... Just this once. Thank you. Hi. Passes, please, for Caprina. How you doing? Fine. All right. Right here. Preenie, preenie. You have outdone yourself once again. The fall line is going to be fantastic. No, the hair... not up! Not up. Loose. In curls. Up, it looks like someone is squeezing your forehead for juice. Baby, get us the exclusive. Look... 12 pages, september issue. - How does that sound? - It sounds like you. - I want to talk about how you make... - No, I don't like to talk money. Yes, but you know I do. Glenda! Come, come. - Gloria. Gloria Pan. - Of course. This is Nigel Marshall Thorn, editor of fashion & style magazine. And this crass little capitalist is Jacques Bouvier, my sponsor. Glenda here is quite the artiste herself. Show Nigel your sketchbook. What is wrong? What? What? My young designer, who is going to be at the newcomer showcase at the end of fashion week... - arrested. - Drugs in the car? No, hooker in the hotel. He was to be my great discovery. I don't know what to do. I... you know... What that boy could do with a buckle. Ms. Pan's designs are not bad. - I'm gonna have to cancel the tv crews. - I do have experience in the business. And the reality program was going to come and do it, as well. No, Jacques... Puppy, stop babbling for a second and listen to Nigel, you could introduce her at the showcase! Her? - You must be joking. - No, look. Think of what a coup it would be? Out of the ashes of scandal, Jacques Bouvier discovers a diamond in the rough. But... she's so old. Tragically so, but Gloria Vanderbilt didn't sell her first pair of jeans until she was 40... But people eat these stories. They do. They eat 'em up. No, I know... Look, the publicity would be worth millions. Yeah, I understand, but... I don't know. It's so... Do you have more? Yes, the rest are on my computer at work. - If you'd like to come to my office... - I must be out of my mind, but I must get something up on this designer showcase. Let's see what Gloria Pan-dervilt has to offer, yeah. Go, go, go. So, good lines. I like very much the lines of the crossover into the... It gives a flow. Come give me a hug. Do you know why? Because you are going to be... the feature designer at the newcomer showcase. The models are already booked. but I'm a little concerned because we're gonna have to put a rush on the garment creation, - which is very expensive. - What's going on? These people are going to put on my first show, - at fashion week. - They're what? I don't think your designs are ready for that. Gloria, listen to me. Can we discuss this first? So, who do you think will be there? Everyone will be there. I can guarantee you all the top houses will be there. And I guarantee you'll have a deal before the end of the show. Do you realize what this means? Your designs will be in magazines, on tv shows, at the oscars! I'm gonna have to talk to my funding partners, about all this. And I'm a little worried because they may take a long time deciding, and, you know, we have such little time. So how much do you need? - Yeah, $50,000. - $200,000. I think what Caprina means is that, eventually, it will be $200,000 we need, but right now, 50's fine. But, of course, having the funds all at once will make things go smoother. 50, cherie, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's just too exciting. Are you crazy? - Shut up, Russell. - You don't even know these people! You'll have to forgive Russell. He doesn't understand the artistic process. - Few people do. - This is from the business account. What are our partners gonna say? How should I know? That's your area. Why don't you go check on the floor? Tick tock. Yeah, tick tock. Julian, sweetheart. Let me move some funds around. I'll call you later and then get you the other $150,000 if you really need it. You won't regret this. Ciao. Goodbye. All right. - What the hell was that? - I just got you a bigger payout. But her husband's about to pop. Now, we should have slow-played her. On this team, you got to follow my lead. Well, maybe if you communicated with actual sentences instead of slogans and code! I'm quitting. I don't need this crap. You're not quitting, Tara. At least Eliot's a professional. Hardison's, you know, warming up. - Even Parker seems okay with me. - Parker showed feelings? A feeling. It seemed like a human one, but it's hard to tell. - Where are you? - Uzbekistan. I love Tashkent! I know, right? Especially in the springtime. Tara, you have to ask Nate about that time on the russian border when he... Let me tell you something. Nate Ford is arrogant, he's condescending, he just doesn't listen! Nate's having trouble communicating? I'm shocked. Yeah, I really, really do not need this. Just give it some time, Tara. You owe me. All right, fine. But if he pulls this man-of-mystery crap again, I'm gonna kick his ass. And the whole "I'm sexy because I'm broken" thing only goes so far. I know, right? Wait, what? - Gotta go. - What do you mean, "sexy"? There you are. Yes, just where you left me since I couldn't join in any reindeer games. Did you, get a call from Gloria? - No, why? - I did. How would they even keep score, the reindeer? Play it, Hardison. Hello, Mr. Bouvier? I have the rest of the money for you.</i> Please meet me at... "Meet me at." Only two places make sense. Her house or the factory. Eliot, I need you to go to the Pans' factory. Right now? I got to be honest with you. I think she's gonna comeback to fashion week, okay? I got a sense about these things. Yeah, nice try, Eliot. The factory. Hardison, check and see if she moved those funds. Also check her car's GPS. Parker and I are gonna take the house. - Wait, where are you going? - Gloria's gonna expect me. Right now, you're an unknown. I don't need another one in the field. Earbud. Earbud. Thank you. Reindeer. I guess they could make marks in the snow, but what kind of math would they use? On task, Parker. Move! What do we know? - Someone targeted the Pans. - I'm with you on that. And the silver sedan that pulled out right before the explosion? It belonged to the Pans. I recognized it. So, either they got away, or the people who did this got away in the Pans' car, and the Pans... didn't. Already on it. The Pans' car just got on the i-95 heading south. Okay, I need to see who's in the car. Can you get me a visual? A visual? Do I look like I have a helicopter? A simple yes or no. Well, I might be able to get you a photo off a traffic camera, but, I mean, I would have to time it just right, based on the car's rate of speed. Listen to me, a car is driving 80 miles an hour. How long does it take to get to a camera mile away? Seventh-grade algebra, Hardison. Listen, the husband said that they had partners. 45 seconds. What? That's the answer... 45 seconds. Nate, I got bank statements here listing sunbright holdings as a joint account holder - with the Pans... - Wait, show me that. - Great. - <i>What's she doing there?</i> Wait, tell Nate I know this corporate id prefix! It's from Shanghai! They pick up. You don't have to yell. Just tell him. I'm looking at the footage our camera caught at the Pans' house right before the explosion. Sending now. Who's planting that bomb? Eliot! Tara! Get out of there! - What? - We gotta go. We gotta go. Nate, I got three guys here... armed with cleavers. That's the signature of the triad. - The triads. We're a minute away. - The chinese triads? They control the global counterfeit-clothing market. Worth billions to them... even more than narcotics. So we didn't take money from the Pans. We took money from the triads. And the last person holding their cash was Eliot. This way. Cleavers. I haven't done that in a while. All right, listen. These rows are narrow. Okay? They're gonna have to come one at a time. Stay close. - You're telling me what to do? - Don't... Wait. What are you... Please! Please, please! I don't want to die. Please! Nate, I just got a shot of the Pans' car. Gloria is traveling solo. I guess Russell didn't make it out. Poor bastard got blown to bits. All right. Russell Pan handles the finances. Did we do a full background check on Russell Pan? You stay out here in case this goes south, be the getaway car. Of course we did. Driver's license, birth certificate, hospital records, business records... he's Russell Pan. But did we make sure that Russell Pan isn't anybody else, as well? Hell. Admit it. You kind of like me now. Guys, I just got a hit on an interpol database. Russell Pan's face matches a one Nicholas Chow. Chinese national. Works for the sun yee on triad. Counterfeit clothing, black market, he's known for burying his enemies alive. This is a bad dude. You got to be kidding me. And there's something else. I don't think Russell's dead. He was there when they were planting that bomb. No kidding. Good to see you again. Hello. Guns. Last time... I saw you, we were here for a business meeting with your wife. This is all a big misunderstanding. That cow of a wife gave you something of mine... $50,000 US. Yes, this was for a show, this was a business... For 20 years, I carried her. I brought over the cheap labor from China. I supplied the asian markets. All she had to do was copy the fashions. But, no, you sold the woman on a ridiculous dream. So I had to get rid of her. Now, I am responsible to my superiors for that money. Where is it? Sit tight. Tell Chow or Pan... Pot, Skillet... whatever his name is, that his money's on the way. It'll be there in 15 minutes. Well... We don't have the money. The money's gone. We spent it on the vendors for Gloria's show. Did you not hear what I just said? I'm on my way with the money. Yeah, and there's no reason to do anything or go anywhere because the money's gone. Wait, wait! Now, wait, listen to me one second before you... What if i was able to give you something worth much more than the $50,000? What if I was able to give you the designs for next fall's collections today? Yeah, that's right. You could get your factories churning out the knockoffs way before the competition. This would be worth millions to you in additional revenue... millions! And how are you going to do this? We have access to the fashion week shows. I mean I can get Julian to steal a major designer's designs. So I let you go, you run to the police, and I get nothing. - No deal. - You can keep me as collaral. Wait. No. This is not necessary. We're not going to go to the police. We have no evidence. I mean, you're gonna hunt us down anyway. We'll keep the woman. You bring us the designs, or... we'll kill her. You have one hour. I'm telling you, get him what he wants. It's just 50 grand. That's what this is about? 5-0. Capisce? 5-0. Julian, come. Come on, let's go. You could've just given Russell the money. If we'd given the money, we would have gone back to the client with nothing. Because that's what it's about... a chance to run a con on the triads on the fly. You put Tara's life in danger to take down a bigger target. It's one thing for Florence and those other women to owe money to some local sweatshop. You want them in debt to the triads the rest of their lives? You wouldn't have left Sophie there. I know what I'm doing. I got it under control. We got less than an hour. We need some designer's plans. - We got to get... - Hold. I got... There's one show left today... Andre V. He has a hip-hop couture line. Great. Perfect. Go get those plans. Wait, wait. What are we doing? We are gonna make Gloria Pan's dreams come true. Maybe I wanted to meet Andre V. Did nobody think of that? Selfish. - Three minutes till the show, Parker. - I know. - Three minutes. - I got it. Kerry, I've got it. I need you to re-freaking-lax! IDs, please. How am i supposed to find soy candles at such a short notice? Farmers' market! I need to double-check your IDs. You know what? Kerry sent us, okay? There was a security breach earlier. No exceptions. The only thing that gets in are models and clothes. I left my ID at the desk. - I'll help you get it. - Thank you. Only thing getting in are models and clothes. - How about this one? - That's a shirt. I know, but at least you can move in it. These clothes are totally impractical. There's no range of motion, limited concealment options, and this reflective material would set off a motion detector a mile away. It's a fashion show! It's not thieves-r-us. Fine. How about this? The a-line drape of the empire waist is nice, but... the neckline's a little weak. If you ask me. What? I date a lot of models. Lot of private fashion shows, if you know what I mean. Yes, yes. But most of the dresses ended up on the ground. Yep, I get it. You're a guy. - Means they were naked. - Seriously? I'm just saying. How you doing? What is that? What is this atrocity on my model? I don't know who did this, but it certainly was not me. This is not my dress. This is not an Andre V dress. I do not design halloween costumes. And what is with this makeup? Sweetie, you are lovely, but you look like you just came from clown school. I asked for blue. You gave me red! This is terrible. What do I have to do to get the correct color? And you... you! - You're incomplete! You are incomplete! - What? Boys and girls, incomplete model on deck! - Wait. - Incomplete model on deck! That is an emergency! Sit down! Sit! Incomplete model on deck here! Nose. Eyes. Chin. Hair. Go. Go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! The cheekbones. Perfection. Perfect... Wonderful. Okay, let's go. - Go! Go! Go! - What? Faster! Go! Go! And graceful, please! You're not running a marathon. Don't even think of coming back here! Find your face! Find your face! Oh, my heavens! My show! How we doing, Parker? All clear. Grab the drive. Oh, my show. Models, everyone, the show must go on. In the spirit of fashion, the show must go on. You... models... get out there! Look pretty! Get out there now! Go! You must have a lot of trust in your friends, although they don't seem worthy of such devotion... especially the one in charge... Bouvier. Yeah, I agree. I don't trust him. And neither should you. Why not? Because he's not who he says he is. His name is Nathan Ford. And he's a con man. He's a thief. He's gonna try and play you. Why are you telling me this? You and I both know when he gets back here you're gonna kill us. Okay, but what if... I told you I had a better way to fix your problems? They're all there... Courtesy of Andre V. Yes, they are. Thank you, Andre V. Files are compressed. They're easy to e-mail. All right. If this thing starts coming off the rails, don't wait. Call us in. Yeah. Chow is primed. I can handle him. I'm not talking about him. She's a pro. She knows what to do. Here... Here are the designs! There you are. - Andre V. Right. The real deal. - Yes, the real deal, yeah. Our factories will be working off of these by tomorrow. Yes, you will become very, very wealthy. So we are done, yeah? We're done, yes? No. The police are looking for someone who broke into Andre V's computer. They're on their way here now. But... - how would they know this? - Because I called them... and I told them a con man named Nathan Ford just tried to sell me a bunch of stolen designs. Well... What if I told you I had a better way to fix your problems? Okay. Tell me. You tell the cops he showed up just before someone tried to kill your wife. A grifter who comes into her life just before he takes your money and your house explodes? You get the designs, he takes the heat. No bodies to clean up. Nate's the fall guy, and you walk away clean. I knew I couldn't trust you. You've donenothing to earn my trust. I made you a member of my team. Your team? Please. You get off putting everybody's lives in danger so the great Nate Ford can come in and save the day. That's your rush. - They'll never believe your story. - No? You're in my factory. You're pretending to be someone you're not. Besides, your prints are all over the drive. Detectives, this is the man I called you about. - They're in his jacket pocket. - Hands on your head, please. - Sir, are you Russell Pan? - Yes. Yes, I am. Aka Nicholas Chow? From Interpol's most wanted list? So you blew up your house to kill your wife? - All right. Get him out of here. - Come on, let's go. I got a couple questions for you, too. Listen. Check my inside pocket. What? I've been working fashion week. Been undercover for six months. Listen, you can take Chow. You've got enough for attempted murder, conspiracy, arson, whatever. - Here, make it look good. Walk me out. - All right. Sure. - Make it look real. - You got it. All right, you guys. Clear the door. Yes, sir. We might want to destroy this. Russell didn't actually transmit the designs to the triad factories? Designs, yes, but probably not the ones they wanted. Our factories will be working off of these by tomorrow. It was a simple switch. You just put an auto-run instruction file on the drive to show a set of designs for the startup and a different set for the e-mail. Yeah, too bad gloria had to retire before her collection was released? I have a feeling she might find a way to stay involved in the clothing business. Here's more clothes, Mrs. Pan! Keep up! Okay, no earpiece. How did you tell Nate you were gonna run the cop scam? It's just 50 grand. That's what this is about. 5-0. Capisce? 5-0? The cops? That's all it took? Some people just know how to communicate. I just finally learned how to speak his language. Cryptic clues, slogans, and code. Here's $50,000. That should be enough to get your parents to the states. And when they get here, they'll have decent jobs waiting for them. She wants to know how you're able to do all this. Well, you know, once the Pans dropped out of the picture, the factory went into receivership. We were able to convince the courts to keep it running under the guidance of a legally appointed administrator. Speaking of which, how is it going there, madam administrator? It's been very good. Everyone's realizing they now get a say in setting their conditions and hours. But I think they're adapting to the new rules pretty quickly. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Well... Here. That's your cut. And... I'm gonna give you your earbud back. And, listen, you know, I'll try, because Sophie sent you, try... to communicate... better. Thank you. And for what it's worth, Sophie was right. You guys are the best I've ever seen. I know. But no one in the world is as good as you think you are. - <i>Rough day?</i> - We got through it okay. - <i>Barely, from what I heard.</i> - Yeah, well Listen, Nate, I sent her, so... so even if you don't trust her, you should trust me by now. She was never in any real danger, so... Really? So would you have made the same play if it were me?</i> Yeah, probably. - No. - <i>Nate, what are you doing?</i> What am I doing? I'm doing my job, Sophie! The one that you talked me back into doing when I was sitting on this couch! The same one that you walked out on. So don't call me from London or Paris or wherever you are and start telling me, you know, how to run my crew!
