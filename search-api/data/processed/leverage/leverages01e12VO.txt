MY WING AT THE MUSEUM OPENS THIS WEEK. LITTLE CELEBRATION FOR THE FUND-RAISERS. YEAH, BLOOD MONEY BUYS THE BEST ART. I HEARD A RUMOR THAT YOU'D -- I'M HERE TO SELL YOU SOMETHING, IAN. I DON'T NEED ANYTHING, NATE. YOU'RE LYING. LYING TO YOU WOULD NOT BE WORTH MY TIME. PORTIA? PORTIA, THIS IS NATHAN FORD. HE USED TO WORK FOR ME. THIS IS PORTIA delDUCCIO FROM THE VATICAN MUSEUM. BUONA SERA, SIGNORE FORD. HELLO? TWO WEEKS EARLIER WHERE IS EVERYBODY? ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON? IAN BLACKPOOLE. C.E.O. OF I.Y.S. INSURANCE. MILLIONAIRE, FAMOUS ART COLLECTOR. WHO TWO YEARS AGO, REFUSED THE CLAIM FOR YOUR SON'S TREATMENT, -LEADING TO HIS -- -ENOUGH! OH. DRUNK AGAIN? ARE WE STILL UNCLEAR? I'M A FUNCTIONING ALCOHOLIC, YOU KNOW? AND THE TRICK IS NOT TO GET HUNG UP ON THE "ALCOHOLIC." BUT CELEBRATE THE "FUNCTIONING" PART OF THE SENTENCE. YOU'RE GETTING WORSE. THIS -- THIS IS MESSING YOU UP, MAN. WE CAN'T KEEP WATCHING YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF. IS THIS MY INTERVENTION? ARE MY BAGS PACKED AND IN THE CAR, READY TO TAKE ME TO REHAB? YOU DON'T NEED REHAB, NATE. YOU NEED REVENGE. PORTIA HERE IS NEGOTIATING FOR A LOAN FOR SOME OF THE VATICAN COLLECTION TO MY WING. IAN HAS THE MOST WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF RENAISSANCE ART I'VE SEEN OUTSIDE OFROMA. WELL, HIS COLLECTION'S GONNA BE BETTER THAN ROME'S IF HE WRITES ME A CHECK. WHERE'S YOUR ART EXPERT? THERE IS, UH, PROFESSOR SINCLAIR. YEAH, YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT I... YOU WANT I CALL HIM OVER? NO. NO, NOT YET. COME ON. FOLLOW ME. MY RESTORATION VAULT. OH. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? HE'S FOUND THE SECOND DAVID. OH! MICHELANGELO'S DAVID. THE MOST FAMOUS STATUE IN THE WORLD. SCULPTED BETWEEN 1501 AND 1504, COMMISSIONED BY THE CITY OF FLORENCE. LIKE ALL SCULPTORS, MICHELANGELO MADE SMALL SCALE MODELS, OR, WELL, WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN AS MAQUETTES, FIRST. I- I KNOW ALL THIS. NO, NO, NO. SEE, WHILE YOU ARE WELL-VERSED IN DEAD-GUY ART, I MYSELF AM NOT. MY ENTIRE CRIMINAL CAREER IS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY BUILT AFTER 1981. SO I AM RIVETED. QUITE SO. PLEASE, DO GO ON. HE FAMOUSLY MADE TWO MODELS FOR THE STATUE, CLAY-FIRED, THEN BRONZED, IDENTICAL. OVER THE LAST 400 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD, LOST, STOLEN, REDISCOVERED DOZENS OF TIMES. WHO HAS THEM NOW? WELL, THE SECOND DAVID WAS STOLEN FROM THE VATICAN 10 YEARS AGO. AND, WELL, IT'S NEVER BEEN FOUND. AND THE FIRST DAVID... ...WELL... THIS WAY. I'M GIVING YOU A SNEAK PREVIEW. AND NOW THE MAIN ATTRACTION. RANDOMIZED LASER GRID REPEATS EVERY FIVE MINUTES. SERIOUS SECURITY. THIS IS AN OLD VAULT THAT I CONVERTED -- 4- INCH STEEL BEHIND THESE PLASTER WALLS. INFRARED DETECTION. VIBRATION DETECTION. AND... ...THE FIRST DAVID. MAN, AM I GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO BREAK IN THERE. THAT IS ONE SICK SECURITY SYSTEM. WHAT, WITH OUR TOOLS? GIVE ME THREE DAYS OF PREP, IT'D BE LIKE TAKING DIAMONDS FROM THE FRENCH NATIONAL BANK. THAT'S LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY. I GOT IT. A VERY EASY THING TO DO. GOT...IT. OH, LOOK, LITTLE BUDDY. THAT'S YOUR NEW HOME! CAN YOU PLEASE NOT PLAY WITH THE LITTLE NAKED MAN? -PLEASE. -I'M NOT. WE SELL BLACKPOOLE A FAKE SECOND DAVID. YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO INSURE IT WITH I.Y.S. THEN WE LET HIM PUT IT ON DISPLAY IN HIS MUSEUM. AND WHEN IT'S DISCOVERED AS A FAKE, HIS OWN COMPANY, I.Y.S., ACCUSES BLACKPOOLE OF FRAUD. HE LOSES HIS COMPANY. HE LOSES HIS MONEY. HIS REPUTATION'S RUINED. NOBODY WILL EVER WORK WITH THIS GUY AGAIN. ONLY ONE PROBLEM. HE IS NOT GONNA BUY THE FAKE DAVID UNTIL HE HAS IT VERIFIED BY AN EXPERT. THAT'S RIGHT. BY ONE OF US. AND HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE THAT? THE LONDON EXAMINER, DATED JUST THREE DAYS AGO. IT LOOKS GENUINE. $8 MILLION. I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LIQUID. SO SELL SOMETHING. SECOND DAVID WILL BE IN THE COUNTRY TOMORROW AND TOMORROW ONLY. YOU IN OR OUT? 'CAUSE I HAVE A CANADIAN OILMAN THAT WANTS TO SLAP SOMETHING ON HIS MANTELPIECE. -OILMAN? -YES. WE'RE TALKING A MISSING MICHEL ANGELO. IT'S PRACTICALLY THE HOLY GRAIL. ARE YOU IN OR OUT? YOU MUST RETURN THIS ITEM TO THE VATICAN MUSEUM IMMEDIATELY. LISTEN, LADY, THE SHEIKH WHO OWNS THIS PIECE DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE POPE, THE VAT-- ANYTHING. SO, OF COURSE, YOU COULD PAY,YOU KNOW, FIVE TIMES THE GOING RATE. -LOOK, PORTIA, LET ME BUY IT. -HERE WE GO. I'LL BUY IT, AND THEN AFTER MY DEATH, I'LL DONATE IT TO THE VATICAN. I MEAN, LET'S NOT GIVE THAT HEATHEN A DIME MORE THAN HE NEEDS. I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT THE HEATHEN ISN'T ME. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS OUT OF THE PAPERS. OF COURSE. I WANT OUR EXPERT, PROFESSOR SINCLAIR, TO DO THE VERIFICATION. NO ONE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM CAN KNOW WE'RE CUTTING THIS DEAL. AGREED. ELIOT. Eliot. WHAT? GIVE ME A SECOND. I'M HITTING IT OFF HERE. Bring her along. IT'LL HELP SELL THE CHARACTER, BUT NOW -- DO IT NOW. NATE. WHY DID YOU COME TO ME? WELL, I KNEW YOU'D PAY THE BEST PRICE. RENAISSANCE ART IS YOUR LIFE. GUILT WAS A BONUS. -YOU HATE ME. -YEAH. OF COURSE I HATE YOU. I MEAN, WHAT -- WHAT? YOU THINK IWANTTO BE HERE? I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, ALL RIGHT?! I'M DRUNK, I'M BROKE, I'M LIVING OUT OF MY CAR, I JUST WANT THE PAYCHECK, AND AT THIS POINT, I DON'T CARE WHERE IT COMES FROM. NATE? MAGGIE. YOU GUYS -- YOU KNOW EACH OTHER? OF COURSE. MAGGIE IS NATE'S EX-WIFE. WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE? GUYS, GUYS, S- STAY IN CHARACTER. NATE FORD. HI. ADAM SINCLAIR. YEAH, MAGGIE HERE IS, UH, MY EX-WIFE. YEAH. CAUGHT THAT. THAT'S A MIGHTY FINE GRIP YOU HAVE THERE, MR. FORD. SIGNORA FORD? COLLINS. I USE MY MAIDEN NAME. OH.SCUSI. DO YOU MIND IF I BORROW PROFESSOR SINCLAIR FOR A MOMENT? YES, UH, WE MUST TALK WITH MR. BLACKPOOLE. -GRAZIE. -OF COURSE. MAGGIE WHICH CONVERSATION DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO? THAT'S WHAT STEREO WAS INVENTED FOR. Why are you working for him? I'm not. I'M UNDER CONTRACT WITH THIS MUSEUM. I'M JUST HELPING HIM SET UP HIS EXHIBIT. NATE, I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE. I HAD NO IDEA THINGS WERE SO AWFUL FOR YOU. OH, NO, NO. IT'S -- IN CHARACTER, NATE. IN -- IN CHARACTER. THINGS GOT ROUGH. IT'S VERY HARD. YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME. I- I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU MONEY. SHE'S PRETTY. THEY MET WHILE HE WORKED FOR ME. MAGGIE'S AN ART EXPERT -- HELPED HIM TRACK DOWN FRAUD. QUITE A GLORIOUS PAIR FOR A WHILE -- VERY NICK AND NORA. LOOKS REAL. THERE'S A TECHNIQUE THAT MICHELANGELO USES WHEN HE WORKS WITH CLAY, AND... I MEAN, I'D OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT, BUT, YES, SIR. I DON'T NEED MONEY! -I -- -Nate! ...NEED MONEY. I MEAN, I JUST NEED THIS DEAL. WELL, THEN, LET'S GO GET IT. WHAT'S NATE HERE FOR? IT'S AN ART SALE, BUT PRIVATE. I'LL VERIFY THE ART. SCUSI. NO. WE AGREED -- -NO OUTSIDE PEOPLE. -NO, NO, NO. NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I- I'VE BEEN A LITTLE HESITANT. NO OFFENSE, BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL. BUT YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW MY REPUTATION. IF MY PRESENCE WILL HELP YOU CLOSE THE DEAL, THEN I'M IN. AGREED. MY ONE CONDITION. MAGGIE EXAMINES THE SCULPTURE, OR I WALK. AGREED. GREAT. I'll get some drinks. WE'LL CELEBRATE. I'LL, UH, I'LL HELP YOU, SIGNORE FORD. Now, Nate... IS MAGGIE A VERYGOOD ART INSPECTOR? -YEAH, SHE'S THE BEST. -NO, NO, NO, WE CAN'T LET YOUR EX-WIFE ANYWHERE NEAR OUR LITTLE NAKED MAN. WE HAVE TO SHOW HER THE REAL THING. WE HAVE TO STEAL THE FIRST DAVID RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN SHOW IT TO MAGGIE TOMORROW AS THE SECOND DAVID. THAT'S TOO RISKY. BLACKPOOLE KNOWS OUR FACES. WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET HIM ON THE HOOK LIKE THIS AGAIN. YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT WE CAN FOOL MAGGIE WITH A FAKE? NO. SHE'S TOO SMART AND TOO EXPERIENCED. WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER, THERE WAS NOBODY BETTER. A SIMPLE "NO" WITHOUT THE CHEERLEADING WOULD HAVE DONE. THIS DOES COMPLICATE THINGS. ALL RIGHT. WELL, ONE CRIS AT A TIME. -PARKER, GET IN HERE. -NO, NO. NATE, WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY PREP. WE DON'T HAVE OUR TOOLS. YOU WANT ME TO BREAK INTO A SECURE STORAGE FACILITY WITH WHATEVER I CAN SCROUNGE UP AT THE BUFFET TABLE? PRETTY MUCH, YEAH. COOL. I THINK SOPHIE LEFT SOME DRESSES IN HERE. I'LL GO, TOO. I, UH, I GOT A WHITE SHIRT. I CAN GO WAITSTAFF. GLASS OF ICE, PLEASE. I NEED A BIG ROLL OF ALUMINUM FOIL. UH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA JUST -- I'M GONNA WRAP UP SOME OF THESE SHRIMP FOR TOMORROW. -BREAKFAST JAMBALAYA, YOU KNOW. -ALL RIGHT. I GOT IT. NOW WHAT? I need dark eye shadow. I ASSUME SHE'S TALKING TO YOU. SCUSI. I MUST GO POWDER MY NOSE. DOOR'S GOT A SILENT ALARM. YOU SHOULD HIDE. WE SHOULD PRETEND TO MAKE OUT. MAKE WHAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT -- A LITTLE BIT -- OKA-- OH.

IS MY BREATH FUNKY? WHICH ONE OF YOU DID SHE KISS? T-1300 MAKASHITA. WE GOT ABOUT 10 SECONDS, EVEN IN THE BLIND SPOT, BEFORE IT PICKS UP OUR BODY HEAT. STICK YOUR GUM IN HERE. HA HA! GOTCHA. YEAH, CAN'T PICK UP OUR HEAT THROUGH THE ICE. NICE. PARKER, PARKER, WHAT ARE YOU -- NO, NO, NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS SYSTEM RESETS IN LIKE FIVE MINUTES. YOU KNOW WHAT? OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IF YOU SET OFF THE LASERS, I'M RUNNING LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL. I PRAY YOU CAN KEEP UP -- JUST SAYING. WHAT ARE YOU -- PARK-- S-- YOU'RE BENDING THE BEAMS BACK. SWEET. YOU DID NOT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS ON THE WAY IN FROM THE VAN. SOME PEOPLE DO CROSSWORDS. We're almost done. I JUST WISH WE COULD TALK WITHOUT IT BEING SO HARD. Nate, did you hear me? I just said we're almost done. YEAH! I HEAR YOU ALREADY! I'M SORRY. OH, NO, NO, NO. I -- I JUST -- I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT I STILL CARE. -NO, I-I WAS -- -CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, I MEAN.

UH, YEAH? LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER. GREAT. I'M SORRY YOUR WIFE GAVE ME HER PHONE NUMBER. - DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. -IT WAS ONLY TO COORDINATE -WHERE WE WERE GONNA GO. -NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. WE JUST STOLE AN $8 MILLION STATUE ON, LIKE, OUR DAY OFF! YEAH, AND WE'RE GIVING IT BACK. TECHNICALLY, WE'RE SELLING IT BACK. DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY? I MEAN, LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT, HUH? WHAT IF BOTH OF BLACKPOOLE'S STATUES WERE FAKE, RIGHT? IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE FOR HIM. THE DAVID HE'S HAD ON DISPLAY FOR YEARS, INSURED AND VERIFIED BY I.Y.S. WAIT, EVERY SALE HE'S MADE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS WOULD HAVE TO BE AUDITED. HE WOULDN'T JUST LOSE HIS COMPANY. HIS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD SUE HIM. THIS GUY WOULD TOTALLY BE RUINED. I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. THAT AIN'T GOOD. I KNOW THAT VOICE. THAT'S THE VOICE YOU USE ON A MARK. I CAN THINK OF A DOZEN OTHER TIMES AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS LANDS IN OUR LAPS. -WE TAKE IT! -YOU DON'T CON US. YOU DON'T CON YOUR OWN TEAM. YOU'RE JUST GETTING COLD FEET BECAUSE YOUR EX-WIFE COULD BLOW IT FOR US! OH, MAGGIE -- -MAGGIE WOULDN'T. -MAGGIE, WHO WORKS FOR THE MAN WHO LET YOUR SON DIE? SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT! SHE DOESN'T KNOW! SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT I.Y.S... AND BLACKPOOLE DENIED SAM'S TREATMENT. HOW CAN SHE NOT KNOW? SHE DOESN'T KNOW... BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER. SHE PITIES ME. DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT? YOU'RE LYING TO HER, NATE. YOU'RE NOT WHO SHE THINKS YOU ARE. SHE THINKS I'M A DRUNK -- MAYBE EVEN A CRIMINAL. YOU'RE STILL AN HONEST MAN, NATE. IT'S THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S GONE CROOKED. DO YOU WANT TO WALK AWAY? HOW MANY OTHER KIDS DIED JUST LIKE SAM BECAUSE THIS BASTARD PUT HIS PROFITS ABOVE THEIR TREATMENT? HOW MANY? AND IT'S NOT JUST ME AND SAM. I MEAN, THAT IS WHAT I KEEP TELLING MYSELF. ALWAYS YOUR FATAL FLAW. YOU THINK TOO MUCH. THERE'S THAT VOICE AGAIN. HARDISON. THREE MINUTES BEFORE THEY ARRIVE. Gotcha, boss. NO. WHOA. WHOA. WHERE IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I- I'M SORRY? YOU ARE THE PILOT FOR THIS PLANE, RIGHT? YEAH, UH, RIGHT. WELL, THEN, GET BACK ON THAT BIRD. WE GOT WORK TO DO. UH, WORK? W- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SPOT INSPECTION. FAA. NOW, LOOK, I WANT TO SEE THIS PLANE'S TCAS, VRSM, AND 8.1 FM SPACING IN OPERATION TO MAKE SURE IT'S FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW FAA REGULATIONS. NEW REGULATIONS? -PILOT UNAWARE OF LATEST REGULATIONS. -OH, THE NEW REGULATIONS.OF COURSE. PLEASE, COME THIS WAY. I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT UP. OH, NO, NO. IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL. I DON'T NEED TO GO UP. JUST TAXI ME AROUND THE BUILDING. TAXI? I THOUGHT YOU NEED TO GET UP IN THE AIR. UNCOMFORTABLE WITH BLACK AUTHORITY FIGURES. SIR, PLEASE DON'T WRITE THAT. OH, I WILL WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR MA IF I FEEL LIKE IT. THIS WAY, PLEASE. IT'S IN ORDER. I-I PROMISE. THIS WAY. IT'S OKAY. FAA -- HE'S A HARD-ASS. ** LET'S GO. WE'RE UP. -HEY. -HELLO. -ADAM. -** AN INTERESTING PLACE TO MEET. NATHAN FORD? YEAH? I'VE GOT A CALL HERE FROM FLIGHT 7- TANGO-8-2, INBOUND FROM DUBAI. THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOUR PARTY'S HERE. YES, WE'RE ALL HERE. WHERE ARE THEY? THEY'RE JUST PULLING IN NOW. AS-SALAAMU ALAYKUM. ALAYKUM AS-SALAAMU. I'M ONLY CLEARED FOR REFUELING. WE MUST RESOLVE THIS BEFORE YOUR CUSTOMS MEN REALIZE I'VE GOTTEN OFF THE PLANE. WHY ARE YOU SELLING THIS? I HAVE CERTAIN DEBTS MY FATHER DOES NOT APPROVE OF. THERE ARE VERY SHARP CARD PLAYERS IN LONDON. IT IS FROM MY FATHER'S COLLECTION. IT WILL NOT BE MISSED. AND IF IT IS, UH... MY SECURITY WILL FIND SOME GUILTY PARTY TO BLAME. THEY ARE VERY EFFICIENT THAT WAY. IAN? I SAY YES. I MEAN, THERE WILL BE OTHER TESTS REQUIRED, BUT... MAGGIE? IT'S A DEAD RINGER FOR THE FIRST DAVID YOU OWN, CAST OFF THE SAME MOLD. IT'S REAL. WHERE'D THE GIRL GO? MAGGIE, WHAT YOU DID BACK THERE -- WAS SO MUCH FUN. WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN. IT WAS JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, WHEN I'D HELP YOU GET YOUR STOLEN ART BACK. IT FELT... FAMILIAR. CALL ME. No. PORTIA! GOOD NEWS, HUH? WHEN THE VATICAN LEARNED ABOUT YOUR GENEROUS OFFER TO DONATE THE DAVID AFTER YOUR DEATH, THEY AGREED TO LEND EVERYTHING YOU REQUESTED FOR YOUR EXHIBITION. OH, YOU WON'T REGRET THIS, PORTIA. WITH THE TWO DAVIDS AS THE CENTERPIECE FOR MY EXHIBIT, THIS IS GONNA BE THE FINEST COLLECTION EVER SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC. I CAN HONESTLY SAY I CANNOT WAIT. FEEL BETTER? ACTUALLY, YEAH. WAS THAT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY? HE WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED A HANDSHAKE. AND IT FELT GOOD. HARDISON, WHERE ARE YOU? HALFWAY HOME ALREADY, NATE. You got it? I'VE GOT THE MONEY RIGHT HERE. I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE. NATE, WE'RE BLOWN. W-- THAT RIB'S BROKEN. HE SAID YOU'D BE TOUGHER THAN THIS. LET'S GO. TAKE HIM. THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT. YOU GETTING TIRED, BOY? BETTER KEEP THAT LEFT UP. YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED. HELLO, PARKER. JIM STERLING. WHY WON'T YOU GO DOWN? THAT RIB'S BROKEN. NATE, WE'RE BLOWN. WE'RE BLOWN. Nate... ELIOT, WHAT'S GOING ON? TALK TO ME, ELIOT. Hello, Nate. LOVE THIS TECHNOLOGY. WHAT DO YOU WANT, STERLING? Well, first, let's see how many birds WE HAVE IN HAND. YOU KNOW THIS IS PARKER'S. NOW, ALEC HARDISON? ACCOUNTED FOR, MR. STERLING. AND WE HAVE THE CASH, TOO. Marvelous. MR. SPENCER? HEY, STERLING. I GOT SOME DENTAL WORK WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. WHAT DO YOU SAY ME AND YOU HOOK UP SO I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU? SEEMS THAT MR. QUINN WAS NOT QUITE AS EFFECTIVE AS PROMISED. STILL, TWO BIRDS IN THE HAND ARE WORTH THREE IN THE BUSH. Eliot, stay low. STERLING, WHAT DO YOU WANT? TELL YOU WHAT -- WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME IN THE PLACE WHERE WE USED TO GO FOR A DRINK AFTER WORK? I'LL COME ALONE. I PROMISE. DO YOU REMBER WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS? AFTER WORK, WE USED TO COME UP HERE, HAVE A DRINK, WATCH THE SUN SET. WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS, STERLING. SO THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION WOULD BE NO, THEN. WHAT DO YOU WANT? A TRADE. -NO. -COME ON. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I JUST WANT THE SECOND DAVID. WELL, YOU GOT IT. IT'S ON THE TRUCK. PARKER COULDN'T MAKE THE SWITCH. NOT THE FIRST DAVID, THE SECOND DAVID. 10 YEARS AGO, I WAS THE INVESTIGATOR WHEN IT WENT MISSING FROM THE VATICAN. -I WANT IT. -WELL, I DON'T HAVE IT. OF COURSE YOU DO. JUST ASK YOURSELF ONE QUESTION. WHO CAME UP WITH THE PLAN TO BREAK IAN BLACKPOOLE? I KNEW YOU'D COME AFTER BLACKPOOLE EVENTUALLY. YOU HAD TO. AND WHEN YOU DID, I KNEW THAT THE WAY IN WOULD HAVE TO BE THE FIRST DAVID. SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RESIST. IT'S HOW SHE THINKS. IT'S HOW YOU THINK. AND I KNOW HOW YOU THINK. COME ON, JENNY. MAKE IT OFFICIAL. IT'S THE NAME SHE WAS USING BACK THEN. MIGHT BE HER REAL NAME FOR ALL I KNOW. I'VE NO IDEA. I STOLE THE SECOND DAVID 10 YEARS AGO. I STILL HAVE IT. SEE? THERE YOU GO. WASN'T SO HARD, WAS IT? ALL RIGHT, I WANT THE SECOND DAVID HERE, THIS SPOT, NO TRICKS, END OF DAY. I'LL BRING IT. NO. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DON'T TRUST THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER. SO, YOU WILL GO MEET MY MEN AT YOUR OFFICES, WHERE I KNOW YOU'LL BE SAFE AND SOUND, AND SOPHIE WILL BRING ME THE SECOND DAVID, WHICH I WILL EXCHANGE FOR PARKER. AFTER ALL, SHE STOLE IT. HOW ELSE IS SHE GONNA LEARN? HOW MUCH IS IN HERE? AS MUCH AS I NEED. WHEN YOU FOUND ME IN CHICAGO, I TOLD YOU I'D BECOME AN HONEST CITIZEN. I WAS JUST AN HONEST CITIZEN... WITH A VERY GOOD RETIREMENT PLAN. SO WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT NIGHT? OH, WHEN YOU WERE STANDING NEXT TO YOUR EX-WIFE? YOU WERE IN NO CONDITION -- YEAH, SO, THIS WHOLE SCAM TO BURN IAN WAS BASICALLY TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THE FIRST DAVID, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, JENNY? DON'T YOU DARE PRETEND THIS HAS BEEN A SELFLESS CRUSADE ON YOUR PART! IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE THAT YOU SET UP OUR OFFICES IN THE SAME CITY AS BLACKPOOLE. YOU KNEW ONE DAY YOU'D GO AFTER HIM AND YOU'D USE US. YES. WELL, I WAS RIGHT, WASN'T I? THAT IS THE VOICE YOU USE FOR A MARK. I MEANT IT, NATE. GOING AFTER BLACKPOOLE. I WANTED TO HURT HIM -- FOR THE WAY HE'D HURT YOU. BUT I'M A THIEF. AND STEALING BOTH DAVIDS... ...NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT, NOT IN 400 YEARS. AND THERE IT WAS IN FRONT OF ME, AND... AND STEALING THE FIRST DAVID HELPED YOU, AND IT WAS... I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS LIKE IT WAS MEANT TO BE. -WE'RE BOTH ADDICTS. -WE'RE ALL ADDICTS, NATE. WE'RE ALL ADDICTED TO OUR PASTS. DON'T TELL ME YOU WEREN'T TEMPTED WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO MAGGIE. YOU WANTED TO FEEL HOW IT USED TO FEEL. YOU STILL THINK OF US AS JUST CRIMINALS. THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PART OF YOU THAT THINKS YOU'RE BETTER THAN US. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? WE DO THIS. STERLING KNOWS US. HE KNOWS HOW WE THINK. SO WE THINK LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE IT, STERLING. PARKER COMES TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOF. WE CIRCLE HER. YOU GET TO THE DAVID WHEN I GET TO THE DOOR. PARKER COMES TO ME, AND WE'RE GONE. WE'VE GOT HIM. BOYS. YEAH, HE'S HERE. Put him on. OKAY. TELL YOUR GUYS TO CUT HARDISON LOOSE, LET SOPHIE AND PARKER GO. OF COURSE. YEAH. KEEP THEM BOTH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. LET'S DO THIS. YOU GO FIRST. YOU KNOW HE'S GOT GUYS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, RIGHT? OF COURSE. CAREFUL! CAREFUL! I CAN REPLACE YOU. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. EASY. PERFECT. FOUR GUYS? SIX GUYS? SEE, HE'S GOOD, BUT HE'S NOT THAT GOOD. SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET US OUT OF THIS? I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO GET US OFF THIS ROOF. AND THEN I ASKED MYSELF... "WHAT WOULD PARKER DO?" WITH A COUPLE BROKEN RIBS AND A CONCUSSION, I DON'T THINK ELIOT CAN TAKE OUT SIX GUYS. YOU KNOW, BUT THEN I THOUGHT, "WHAT WOULD HARDISON DO?" WHAT'S GOING ON? GEARY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? Sterling... I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN HONORABLE MAN. I'M CATCHING THIEVES. THERE'S NOTHING MORE HONORABLE. NATE, WE'RE DONE HERE. HARDISON! WAIT, ELIOT. ELIOT, COME ON. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, MAN. BRING IT OUT. COME ON. THIS IS JUST WEIRD. I PAINTED THIS. ALL RIGHT. THIS ISN'T A TOTAL LOSS. FOUR OF THE BEST THIEVES IN THE WORLD JUST LEFT ME A PAPER TRAIL A MILE LONG. GET A TEAM UP HERE. PULL EVERY FILE. SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE POLICE? YOU'RE FIRED. DUST THE WHOLE PLACE FOR FINGERPRINTS, OKAY? I WANT A FORENSIC COMPUTER SP-- HEY, STERLING. GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. RUN. RUN! MAYBE HE WAS BLUFFING. THAT'S THE FUNNY THING ABOUT CON MEN. THEY DON'T BLUFF. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. I GO DELIVER UNTO MY BOSS, WHO IS A VERY, VERY RICH MAN, THE OBJECT OF HIS FONDEST DESIRE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I MOVE INTO A STARTLINGLY LARGE OFFICE. HEY, WAIT. W- WHAT ABOUT FORD? WHAT ABOUT HIM? HIS COVER'S BLOWN. FACES OF HIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SENT TO EVERY LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE STATE. WE'VE TAKEN THEIR MONEY, THEIR BASE OF OPERATIONS, AND NOW NATE FORD WILL NEVER, EVER GET HIS REVENGE. THEY WILL DO THE ONLY SMART THING TO DO. THEY'LL SCATTER. THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS. THEY KNOW WHEN THE GAME'S UP.
