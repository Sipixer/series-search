Before we conclude this meeting, I want to introduce to you the newest vice president of i.Y.S. Insurance, James sterling. All of you know jim sterling as our chief investigator, The man who recovered a michelangelo that was stolen from me three months ago. But that's not the reason he's standing here now. It certainly didn't hurt. Leverage s01 e13 That's right. Yeah, i'm at the museum. I'll be home around 6:00. Uh-Huh. capture:frm@ïä·ç sync:frs@»¨ </font> Uh, no, no. I'll, uh, i'll fix them something to eat when i get home. www.1000fr.Com presents So, what i'm proposing is that we both insure And secure our clients' art -- Ourpersonnel,ourtechnology. No more writing multimillion-Dollar checks Because some museum guard took a nap under the picasso. The showcase will be my wing of the museum. Every painting there will be either mine or belong to a high-Profile client of i.Y.S. A perfect show of faith. Thank you for your vote of confidence. So, what do you think? Corner office. I don't know what to say. How about, uh... Something like, "i'm more comfortable in enclosed spaces"? - Let's take a look over here. - Okay. You know, i think you'd fit through that window if you're traveling fast enough. Last time i saw you, you were selling me something. It's a nice team you had, by the way. Uh, portia -- Was that her name? Oh, i mean sophie. Yes. Yes, thank you. I got out of sales. - So, what are you in now? - Theft. Yeah, i'm going to rob the two davids gallery on opening day. Nice wet bar. Aren't you gonna call the, uh, police? Of course not. You're a sick man, nathan. You still blame me for the death of your son. You turned down the insurance claim for the treatment that would've saved him. It's our policy to say no to all claims until they've been fully investigated. Stalled -- Fully stalled. I don't let my personal feelings affect policy. Yourpolicy. This company never automatically turned down claims until you came along. I have a responsibility to my shareholders. - People lost their homes! Children died! - No exceptions. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Get out. You're gonna mess thisup. - You're gonna mess meup. - I was here first. - I was here first! What are you doing? - Damn it hardison! - This is my spot. You go! I'm gonna make you an offer. One time only. You resign as c.E.O., you donate all your assets to charity, And i will not rob the museum. - All my assets? - Yeah. How generous. We're done here. Yeah, i've got some errands, too. Rope, masks...knockout gas! - Be seeing you, sterling. - Nate. Behind you. - What? What?! - Behind you! - What? - Hey! ??? Hey! Hey. Just wait. Hey! Are you seeing this? Could we get some security over to the blackpoole gallery? Help me. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. Do i know you? Lo siento. No habla ingles. Perdon.Le conozco? Of course she bloody speaks spanish. ???? Hey. All right, check one floor up. I think i saw another guy dressed just like this one. - Got it.Let's go. - Move! I'm gonna kick your butt. - Stand over there! - I'm gonna kick your butt. Oh! W- Where did you -- Run now. Talk later. - What? - Let's go. Need a ride? Hardison, what is this? Yeah, well, since sterling blew our covers, i had to find a new safe house. Lay low. This is your idea of laying low? - Hey, don't break nothing. - There's nothing to break. Who ripped out the toilets? This was an i.R.S. Foreclosure. I got it cheap. I.R.S. Doesn't take toilets. They do when they're solid gold. This used to be m.C. Hammer's place. I guess youcan touch this --With a swat team and a federal warrant. What? See that? We're a mess. Yep. How'd you know we'd be there? Last week before the exhibit opens, security almost in place, But not fully staffed. Best time to case the joint. Plus, i did chase all of you at one point or another. Is she in on this? "She" can hear you, okay? Wait a minute. There is no "this," eliot. Sophie did come back for me. Wouldn't have had to if she wouldn't have lied to you. No calls for three months. I don't need you people. ??? ??A certain job with horses where i backed your play, actually. I don't care! You don't con your crew! Glen-Reeder security system here. And that's not the worst of it. The davids are under bulletproof glass on a motion-Detector pad. - Really? - Mm-Hmm. Environmentally sealed, kept at a constant temperature and humidity in the case. I saw them working on the airflow. You can get past the motion detectors, okay? I have a link to their security system and the video feed. Guard rotation's too heavy for a day grab, And at night they got two standing guards. Why'd you come back? We agreed to scatter for six months. All of you -- Allof you -- Made an amateur move being there. It's too hard to leave a job undone. It's like an itch. I put a lot of work into us, into that office. It was like my second home. I blew up my second home. As annoying as you people are, I quit this crew when i quit this crew. Nobody makes me leave. I just -- I really wanted to hurt sterling. Well, he's taking over security for the gallery. So if we work together -- If we work together, We can kill two birds with one stone -- Break blackpoole and humiliate sterling. No, no. Sterling, he knows our game, man, okay? It's going to be twice as hard to steal those statues. Oh, no, no. It'll be four times as hard. They know we're coming. And how do they know that? I went to their office and told them. Oh, nate. We all want to hurt these guys, right? They humiliated us. But taunting them? The -- The response is going to be... Biblical. That's what i'm counting on. Hey, i think the roof's the way in. But it looks like they've rigged alarm sensors to the skylights. - I can get around those. - Really? And end up on one of the new 20 cameras they got down there From our last little trip to the basement? That was fun. - Yeah. Could we talk about that? - Talk about what? You know, none of this takes into account any new security measures That sterling might have added since nate made his little playdate. Where's the air coming from? The statues are in a sealed case, Kept at a constant humidity and temperature. Air moves in and out. How? All right, from what i saw, The airflow to the museum passes through the base of the display, right? Hollow base underneath the statues, so what's underneath the base? The restoration room. It's like a maze of rooms down there -- Airflow control, heating, storage. How'd we miss that? Grifter, hitter, hacker, thief. You were all trying to solve your version of the crime Instead of just trying to... solve the crime. There was a reason we worked together. Yeah...was. Okay, we need access to that restoration room. We need somebody on the inside. We can't run a con. They know our faces. What about maggie? Exactly. I mean, most of the museum people aren't gonna recognize us, But maggie --She works down there. No -- What about maggie? She's inside. - You just said that.She just said -- - No, wait.No, hold -- Listen. Listen, i get -- I get it. Just have eliot call her as dr. Sinclair. We won't play her. He'll just feel her out. Have eliot...feel out my wife? Feelout. Ex,nate -- Ex-Wife. Okay, look, you always have a plan "b," right? So, fine. Without maggie, what's the plan "b"? I'm sorry. These allergies -- They're just killing me this year. So, we moved the sarcophagus from the egyptian room to the lecture hall. It still needs to be validated. Ah. Jim. This is dr. Lloyd, director of the museum. And you know maggie. Mr. Sterling will be taking over all the security for blackpoole gallery. I want that floor to ceiling, all four floors. You know, we, uh, we have security. - Hmm? - Oh, hey, doc. Absolutely terrifying. Every painting in this gallery belongs to either me or a client of i.Y.S., And i'll do whatever necessary to protect it. Dr. Lloyd, this is no longer a museum. It's a vault with visiting hours. Mr. Blackpoole...you know, i-I'd just like to add that our security Has years of experience.... in fact the fbi was just here. Hello? Hey, maggie, how you doing? Dr. Sinclair. Adam. What a nice surprise. Ease into it. Don't rush her. Yeah. Listen, i'm in --I'm back in los angeles for a while. You know, i had to ask her out 10 times efore we even got a coffee -- Coffee? I would love to. Yeah. What time? In an hour? I -- Yeah, i would love to. Let me write down where you want to go. I know exactly where that place is at. All right. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah --All right -- No. She probably just really wants some hot coffee. - Shut up! - It's not like a date. Are you kidding me? You're fixing your hair? Because i'm playing the professor sinclair dude! Thank you. You come here a lot? No. I just wanted to see you. That's a date. Did we really need to put a button cam on eliot? Safety issue. We're not gonna talk about art all afternoon, are we? - No. - Good. It's all my ex-Husband ever wanted to talk about. And that was so tedious. Listen...i want to thank you. I haven't dated a lot since my marriage broke up. I'm sorry to hear that. No, don't be. He was obsessive, perfectionist, controlling. Organized! She used to say i was organized. And punctual. He must have had some good qualities. No, not even in bed. Every night was prom night. You know what i mean? But worst of all... ...he completely forgot that i gave him that same button camera for christmas three years ago. I can explain. - Did it occur to you that... - I feel used. You lied to me, nate. I don't know why i'm surprised. It's going great. We can tell. - Maggie! Maggie! - And to think i felt sorry for you -- That whole sob story about being broke and sleeping in your car and a drunk. Was!Was broke.Was sleeping in the car. The drunk thing, not quite in the past tense. What is all this, nate? This -- Them... Maggie, we help people. You break the law. No -- Pick up where the law leaves off. Wow. You are not the same man i married. - Uh, what -- - So, who does this help? Blackpoole's a bastard, nate. He was a bastard when you worked for him. What's changed? Just help me understand. I have to tell you something, mag. Please. What? Mag...when sam was in stage iv, I found a treatment that would've helped him. And i went to ian to pay for it... and he wouldn't. - He wouldn't? - He wouldn't. I told him we had mortgaged the house, sold the car, that we were broke, And he still wouldn't pay the claim. 20 years at that company, and they wouldn't help save our son. Why didn't you tell me this? I work with these people, nate. I am friendly with them. You just let me walk around like an idiot.???? ???? Why have you just been carrying this around all this time? I didn't want you to hate me, maggie. Why would i hate you? I do. If i had ever seen you look at me the way i looked at myself in the mirror, I would've blown my damn brains out. No!! No!! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. When eliot spencer worked here as a security guard under a fake name, He gave a real cellphone number as a reference. Look who just got a call from that number. Oh, maggie. What a shame. ???With any luck, they'll never know what hit 'em. And that --That's the plan. You actually expect this to work? No, no, you're supposed to say,"wow. That's just crazy enough to work." Incredibly, chance does seem to bend itself to his bizarre machinations. That's his superpower. Okay, um...now, do you have what we need? I have to check museum inventory. Oh. Easy. This is confidential. You're not reading my e-Mails, are you? No. No. He won't --Here. This is the only thing big enough for what you need. Great. Okay. Now, how soon can you get that in the restoration room? That's not my department. You have to convince the museum director, darien lloyd, to pull it from the display. Okay. - Nate? - Hmm? You just can't make somebody do what you want them to do. That's -- That's what we do. I mean... You're adorable. Maggie, it won't fall out. Just pretend it's not there. Yeah, just forget my ex-Husband's voice in my head, Telling me what he thinks i should do. I'm in therapy to solve this problem. Uh...i -- Sorry. Um, okay, parker's on her approach, so i want you -- So nobody else finds it annoying when you nag them in the middle of these things? Why don't i run this one, nate? Yeah. I don't nag. You know, i just have, you know, a clear big-Picture viewpoint. Actually, you know what? We did kind of liked the way sophie ran the last one. Yeah. Yeah. Up until the point where she got us caught, but other than that... Yeah, all right. Fine, fine. You're in therapy? How come you didn't -- None of that. No. No. Hey, i will cut you off. What did parker switch his allergy medication with? Pollen -- Ragweed mostly. And dextroamphetamines. Oh! - Oh, i'm so sorry. - Oh, i'm so sorry. Did i step on your glasses? - No, no, no, it's okay. - Okay, good. Okay, why don't you run up to him? Being just a little bit out of breath, it changes the speech rhythms, Makes it harder to detect a lie. Lloyd! See? Like that right there. It's informative. You learn and you con. You forgot this in my office. I -- When was that? Five minutes ago. I showed the designs for the two davids exhibit. You signed off on the benches. You okay? Good. Now steer him towards me. Don't tell him. Just give him half an idea. Let him complete it. I'll bring you the rest of the plans after your thing in the egyptian room. I have a thing in the egyptian room? Roll that back. That's parker. Stay on dr. Collins. - Dr. Lloyd's there, too. - Stay on dr. Collins. Ahlan biki,director lloyd. Dr. Rahman of the cairo museum. I was -- I was so worried that i had the wrong day. Oh, no, no. I - I don't have an appointment. Oh, yes, i do. Oh, dear, that, um --No, that doesn't sound good at all. I've had it for weeks. Well, i've confirmed the markings, and i concur --Definitely fourth dynasty. The sarcophagus of pharaoh menkaure. Everything's blurry. I'm so relieved to finally meet someone Who's got the good sense to ignore all that silly, silly curse business. Say what? Well, i'll certify the authenticity as you requested. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you. Um... So, oh, goodbye, then. And, well, i-I recommend you -- You see a doctor about that cough. It does seem to be going to your chest. It's just allergies. Okay, he's just checked all the places The sarcophagus was stored before it hit the museum. Okay. What's he found? Oh. Well, looky here. Dr. Ernst volk, university of berlin -- Dead. Dr. Schliemann, london museum -- Dead. Oh. Oh, and also the three guys that actually discovered the tomb. Eliot, what does that say? - It says "dead." - D- E-D -- Dead, baby. - D- E-A-D. - D- E-A-D. I- I know how to --I was throwing a little style on it, Just a little bit, a little style. I know how to spell "dead," damn it. I can steal a bank, i can spell "dead." Wrap it up now, maggie. You're doing great. There you are. - Can you just sign these? - Sure. Hey, uh, maggie... ...you don't believe in curses, do you? You know, mummy's curses, unexplained deaths around sarcophaguses? Don't be silly. Everyone knows it's a fungus. What? Aspergillus flavus --Found on egyptian artifacts. Gets in the eyes and nose, infection spreads, And the next thing you know --Another death from the curse. So, uh, what are the symptoms? Congestion, memory loss, blurry vision. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Seal it up. Seal it up. It's a good idea. I just, um --Just -- Just give me a moment. You need something? I was just trying to make myself useful. Yeah, well, last time you tried that, we had to blow up the office. That's not fair. - I was just getting used to it. - What? Having an office? Being part of a team. Look, i didn't mean --You know, it wasn't supposed to go down like that. What's going on? Sophie here was just trying to apologize. No, i wasn't. She tried that with me earlier. She kind of sucks at it. A little bit. Oh, did she give you the speech about how we're thieves And about how this is what thieves do and if we were in her shoes, We'd have done the same thing? No, i think she was just getting to that part. ?? I wasn't apologizing. I... That's the problem. I just wanted to see if...we... We were all okay with each other. Okay. There it is. - I forgive you. - Apology accepted. No, i wasn't --Unh-Unh. You -- I didn't... Oh, no, no. Just -- Uh, left a little bit. Line this end up with the vermeer. Careful. Watch the floor. Right in front of the rembrandt so it's lit up by the skylight. And now, for the first time in 400 years, The two davids are reunited. I would like to express my gratitude to the museum staff And, of course, our fund-Raisers and all of you For the opportunity of presenting michelangelo... Pictures have been distributed. We're scanning every guest that comes into the museum. Eliot spencer. Eliot spencer --Wanted in five countries, including myanmar, Which is offering a half-Million-Dollar bounty on his head. Bringing spencer to justice and getting paid for it? It's icing on the cake. Parker. Parker -- Wanted in nine countries, including brazil and yemen. Tough choice. I'll have to flip a coin. How about sophie devereaux? England, france, spain, luxembourg -- Europe, basically. France. Wonderful shopping... ...horrifying prisons. Alec hardison. Well, he better not show his face in iceland. Perfect. I'll drop him off on my way to france. Nathan ford. Oh, i have something special planned for him. No, no, no. It's nathan ford. Well, well, well. What the hell are you doing here? Well, i bought a ticket. It's open to the public. - I don't think -- - Of course. Enjoy yourself. You heard him. Conspiracy to commit robbery is what -- Five years? Catching him in the act -- 20. Pull guys off the galleries. Follow nate ford. - Where are you going? - To scratch an itch. You know, i have a museum to run. - Did anything happen here? - No. Dr. Collins was asking you something. You were working on something. No, she didn't. I... - I moved a mummy. - Why? No reason. - Come on! Come on! - ??? Look at this! Directly under the davids. Out of the sight lines of the cameras. They're gonna drill right up and through the display base. Who? Who? Whoever's hiding in that sarcophagus.??? That's...a mummy. - I think you set something off. - Yeah. I can't see them! Sterling, get this thing open! You two, open this up. We can't. Homeland security. What? An unnamed gas has been released in a public space. We have to evacuate the building. Evacuate??? - It's federal protocol. - We're not gonna evacuate. It's federal protocol for a chemical attack! Did you say chemical attack? There is no chemical attack. It's a robbery. It's a robbery! Robbery! Fine! Bloody hell! All right. All security personnel, evacuate the building immediately. Evacuate the building immediately! You can't leave. We don't even know if they're in there. We have no choice. What the hell is going on here? They've already stolen them. They're using the crowd to smuggle them out with the fakes! Nobody move until i've confiscated all the statues! Excuse me, sir. I thought we were evacuating. We are. Keep them moving. We've got to get out. All right, geary, corral them outside. Everybody, hand your statues to the men in the black suits. Fine. Do whatever you need to do now. At least we got everyone out of the building. He got everyone out of the building. They triggered the door locks. Geary. Geary, where's ford? We have an alarm on the roof! Up on the roof. Let's go to work. - You got him? - I got all of them. Just a panic. The fire department's here. This is your idea of control? This is your last chance, maggie. Come clean. I don't know what you're talking about. Two davids. Thank god. Got you, nate. Yes. That was the whole point. Power's back up in about 15 seconds. What do you mean? You know -- All that chasing me around. "Don't let nate ford near the two davids. ""How is nate ford gonna get the two davids?" I wasn't the mastermind on this one, sterling. I'm the bait. Three, two, one. No! T- The room was locked! Sometimes the classics really are the best. They were masterpieces! They're worth -- $150 million. The vermeer, caravaggio, two van eycks -- At least. We need to call the police. Yes, he's right. We really should call the police. No, not the police. - What do you mean? - No, i'm responsible! All the paintings in this room -- They were my responsibility. No, they were all loaned to me... Oh, well done. Every single masterpiece in this room is insured by i.Y.S. That's a $150 million payout. Now, what do you think your board of directors are gonna do When they realize that you've lost the company $150 million? - Clear the room. - Where are they? Clear the room! Come on. Are you here to kill me, ian? Here's how it's gonna go, sterling. I'm all ears. No, you talk to me, not to him. You talk to me. Every single painting will be returned to i.Y.S. The moment ian blackpoole is stripped of his position And all his assets in the company. Also, his policy of denying every claim --That ends. Extortion. I prefer to call it "oversight." Last time i saw you, you were selling me something. I got out of sales. So, what are you in now? Theft. Yeah, i'm going to rob the two davids gallery on opening day. Well, aren't you gonna call the police? Of course not. When the owners of these paintings Realize that ian knew there was gonna be a theft, But didn't call the police, Well, they're gonna sue the hell out of him, aren't they? But if the company, in good faith... Returns their paintings? They might not fire you if you give them blackpoole. No. Sterling, you work for me. I.Y.S. Is my company. Can't let personal feelings affect policy. You have a responsibility to shareholders. No exceptions. I have lost my only son. Do you really think you scare me? Huh? Maggie! Will -- You understand -- Screw therapy. That felt really good. Of course, you know your entire plan depended on me Being a self-Serving, utter bastard. Hmm. Yeah, that's a stretch. I'll call you when it's done. You do that. Where are you going? Where's he going?! - Will you stop now? - I don't know. - Interesting. - Hmm? You admitting you don't know something. It's done. Blackpoole's out. - Time to return the artwork? - I think so. Eliot and hardison Will replace the floor panel, seal the hole -- No one will ever know what happened. We'll move the artwork into the loading dock, Make it look like someone from the outside dropped it off. You are not the man i married. Well, what do you think of this version? I don't love him, but i might like him a little more. Thank you...all of you. You surprised me. We had a good run. It's a good time to move on. I'm going somewhere...else. A fresh start. We made a difference. Remember that. Where you going? Let's see how hard you look.
