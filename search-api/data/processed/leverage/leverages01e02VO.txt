HE SAYS THAT THE CASTLEMAN CONTRACTORS SPOOKED AND STARTED FIRING. 5.56 NATO ROUNDS... MIXED IN WITH SOME 9 MILLS FROM THE SUBMACHINE GUNS. INSURGENTS WOULD HAVE USED AK-47 WITH 7.62 AMMO -- HAS MORE OF A "CRACK." CONTRACTORS SHOT THEM UP, ALL RIGHT. YOU I.D.'d THE WEAPON FROM THE GUNSHOT SOUND. IT HAS A VERY DISTINCTIVE SOUND. CASTLEMAN SECURITY IS HARD-CORE, FOLKS, A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY. THEY GOT FAT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS EVERYWHERE WE GOT TROOPS. THAT'S CHARLES DUFORT, C.E.O. HE'S VERY PARANOID AND VERY PROFESSIONAL. I WANT TO GET THIS CLEAR RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A PRIVATE ARMY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING ON. THEY GOT THEIR OWN INTEL ASSETS. THEY GOT A LOT OF TRIGGER-PULLERS. YES, AND LOBBYISTS IN EVERY OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THE PROBLEM WITH A COVER-UP IS ALL THE PAPERWORK IT TAKES TO KEEP THE LIES STRAIGHT. INTERNAL E-MAILS, MEMOS. EXACTLY. - SO... - LET'S GO TO WORK. SO, WE STEAL THE EVIDENCE AND THREATEN TO EXPOSE THEM. - BLACKMAIL. - AH, YES... BUT JUST ENOUGH BLACKMAIL TO PAY FOR PERRY'S REHAB -- MAYBE A COUPLE OF MILLION MORE IN DAMAGES. NEVER HOLD UP IN COURT. AH, BUT THAT'S WHY CORPORAL PERRY IS LUCKY. HE DOESN'T HAVE LAWYERS. HE HAS THIEVES. HARDISON. NEXT TIME, I WEAR THE SUIT. Dufort's here. I'll make contact. SEE WHAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT OF HIM. PARKER, HARDISON, TIME TO HIT HIS OFFICE. I-I GOT TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE. I-I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING. WHAT? I JUST REMEMBERED GRAVITY... AND THE SQUISHINESS OF ALL MY MANLY BITS. I DESIGNED THIS RIG MYSELF. THE LINE IS CARBON FIBER, FIVE-POINT HARNESS. WEIGHT SUPPORT HERE, HERE, AND HERE, AUTOBRAKING RESISTANCE ON THE MAIN PULLEY BACK HERE. OKAY. OKAY. C-COOL. SO IT'S TESTED? NOT YET. NOT Y-- WELL, WHEN THE HELL WAS YOU GONNA TEST IT? OHH! YOU BIG BABY. SERIOUSLY? SERIOUSLY? OKAY, HARDISON, PARKER, GUARD SWEEPS ARE EVERY 10 MINUTES. THAT MEANS YOU GOT 9 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS. I'M WORKING ON IT. CASTLEMAN IS GONNA BE VERY HAPPY WITH THE NEW APPROPRIATIONS BILL. - PARDON ME, CONGRESSMAN. - YES. LILY McREADY. I'M WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THEY'RE A LONDON-BASED DEFENSE CONTRACTOR. - CHARLES DUFORT. - OH. EXECUTIVE ORDERS DOESN'T WORK FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. YET. PERHAPS WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. YES, WELL, UM, IT WAS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. NOW, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME. YOU'RE NOT POACHING, ARE YOU? APPROPRIATIONS BILL 718. THOSE ARE OUR DEFENSE CONTRACTS. DON'T EVEN BOTHER. MR. DUFORT, SURELY THERE'S ENOUGH WAR TO GO AROUND. I RATHER LIKE YOU. HARDISON, HARDISON, WHAT'S ... WHAT'S THIS BILL THEY ARE TALKING ABUOT? YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK, BUT THIS MAN HAS AN RFID SECURITY-CARD READER ON HIS POWER SUPPLY, SO I'M A LITTLE BUSY. OOH, OLD-SCHOOL. I FOUND A SAFE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS. IT'S VOICE-ACTIVATED. ALL RIGHT, WELL, ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME. UR, SOPHIE, I'M GOING IN. WE NEED TO GET AN RFID CARD TO ELIOT. MY COMPANY'S FOCUSED ON MEETING SENATORS, BUT I'M THINKING CONGRESSMEN. YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT CONGRESSMEN? 50, 100 GRAND WELL SPENT WILL GET ONE ELECTED. BUT THEN, ONCE THEY'RE IN, THE INCUMBENCY RATE IS OVER 95%. SO YOU CAN GET, ON AN AVERAGE, 18, 20 YEARS OF USE OUT OF ONE OF THEM. IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES, BUYING A UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS A CORPORATION CAN MAKE. OHH, I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT. I'M A PROFESSIONAL CRIMINAL, AND I FIND THAT DISTURBING. ??? WELL,??? NO, OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT IS TOO HARSH A WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. WE JUST HELP THEM ALONG. IT WAS A ?? ?? ??? - ?? - ??? ??? SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO GET OUT AND WASH. OH?? OH, THIS IS THE FIRST DAY I'VE WORN IT. THANK YOU. LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET SOMEONE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT. EXCUSE ME. - YEAH, GARCON? - YES, MA'AM? COULD YOU, UH, COULD YOU POSSIBLY HELP US? - WE'VE GOT A LITTLE STAIN ON THIS JACKET. - ??OH LOOK AT THAT. - LET ME TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR YOU. - ?? - IF YOU ?? - LET ME, UH, KEEP THIS. A MAN IN MY POSITION SHOULDN'T FORGET HIS WALLET. THAT'S EMBARRASSING. THANK YOU. HERE YOU GO, SIR. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. THERE'S NO MAGNETIC STRIP. IT'S A LITTLE RADIO FREQUENCY. JUST... JUST PUT IT UP NEXT TO THE PHONE THAT I GAVE YOU. I'M IN. PARKER, WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE VOICE LOCK? I'VE BEEN SAMPLING DUFORT'S SPEECH, BUT I STILL NEED A FEW MORE SOUNDS. How many? OH, I ONLY NEED THE SOUNDS "PUH," "TUH," "OOH," "UH," "EH," "OH," "AH," "KUH," "AY," "EFF." AH, ONLY THOSE. ELIOT? I'M ON IT. HELLO. HELLO. - OOH. - MMM. APPETIZER, SIR? SURE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? I'VE GOT THE PâTES D'ESCARGOT AVEC BEURRE D'ARGENTINE... AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE OLD DUCK, KIND OF GREASY. I GUESS I'LL HAVE THE FIRST ONE. BUT OF COURSE. WELL? MAY I HAVE SOME? THE GREASY DUCK? OOH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I WOULDN'T HAVE THE GREASY DUCK. NO, I WOULDN'T SUGGEST IT. NO, THE OTHER ONE! THE PâTES D'ESCARGOT WITH THE BEURRE ARGENTINE! EXCELLENT CHOICE. PRETTY GOOD. YOU GOT MOST OF THEM. OKAY, NOW ALL I NEED IS "EFF," "UH," AND "KUH." THIS IS SHRIMP! ??? IT'S SHRIMP, YOU STUPID FU-- OHH! THERE THEY ARE. REALLY LOUD, TOO. OKAY, SOPHIE, START THE WALKAWAY. I was wondering, could I drop by your office? Anytime. Where are you going? PLAYING A HUNCH. ALL RIGHT, WELL, PLAY IT FAST. HARDISON, WHAT DO YOU GOT? YOU GOT THREE MINUTES. TOO MUCH. I GOT ALL OF PERRY'S MEDICAL RECORDS. ??SURE, THAT'S -- THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL, BUT I'VE GOT PSYCH EVALUATIONS, HIGH-SCHOOL RECORDS. THEY'RE READING HIS E-MAILS. TAPPING HIS PHONES. I'VE GOT SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS OF PERRY HERE FROM THE HOSPITAL YESTERDAY. WHY ARE THEY SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY WATCHING OUR GUY? I MEAN, THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SHOOTING WERE DONE MONTHS AGO. SEE THOSE GUYS? PRIVATE CONTRACTORS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHOOTING. THE COVER-UP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOOTING. IT'S ABOUT THE TRUCKS. CONGRESSMAN. UH, YES? YOUR SUPPORT ON THE NEXT APPROPRIATIONS BILL WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. WE'VE ALREADY EARMARKED THE NO-BID CONTRACTS FOR CASTLEMAN. - THEY DESERVE IT. - NOBODY'S PERFECT. LOOK AT ALL THE TROUBLE THEY HAD WITH THAT SHOOTING IN NAJAF. I'M SORRY? I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THAT SORT OF NEWS. I JUST REVIEW THE CONTRACTS. OF COURSE. EXCUSE ME. PARKER, HARDISON, BUG OUT, GO BACK TO THE OFFICE. WE'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. YOU NEED TO TALK?? THE SHOOTING WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. PERRY ISN'T A VICTIM. HE'S A WITNESS. CASTLEMAN STRIKE YOU AS THE KIND OF COMPANY THAT WOUEP A WITNESS ALIVE? HE'S NOT IN HIS DAMN ROOM. I'M CHECKING ALL THE CORRIDORS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE EXTERIOR DOORS. SORRY, DOC, I KNOW IT'S CLOSED, BUT -- MR. FORD? WE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE NOW. WHY? CASTLEMAN. - ??? - SOPHIE DEVEREAUX. OOH! - ???HERE WE GO. - WATCH THOSE HANDS, MR. PERRY. I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR. I'M NOT BLIND. LET'S GO. IT AIN'T GETTING CLEAR. I CAN'T FIND -- EXCUSE ME, DO YOU WORK ON THIS FLOOR? I, UH -- WHAT FLOOR IS THIS? I'M IN ORTHOPEDICS, SO -- HEY! HEY! GET THE ELEVATOR! MR. FORD! HELLO. AAH! GO! WE GOT ALL THIS STUFF ONE OF THE CASTLEMAN HITTERS. ??? THIS IS A SUICIDE NOTE. THIS GUN IS REGISTERED IN ROBERT PERRY'S NAME. THE BILL OF SALE BELONGS TO A SHOP A MILE FROM HIS HOUSE. I GOT PERRY SQUARED AWAY IN A SAFE HOUSE. PLAYTIME'S OVER, NATE. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THEY COME AFTER US. THE TALL ONE, THE WAY HE USED THEúKNIFE -- EX-MARINE, PROBABLY FORCE RECON. YOU I.D.'d A GUY OFF HIS KNIFE-FIGHTITYLE? IT'S A VERY DISTINCTIVE STYLE. THAT'S FOR LATER. I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR AN THIS. WHAT I DID BEFORE, NO GOT HURT. STOLE PAINTINGS FOR A LIVING. I NEVER HURT ANYBODY. I ACTUALLY HURT PEOPLE, SO... NATE, IF ANYTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED -- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS CALLED ME. YOU... YOU REMEMBER? YOU BEGGED ME TO RUN THE CREW, AGREED TO PLAY BY MY RULES. NOW, WALK OUT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. WALK OUT ANY DAY IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. IT'S SIMPLE. WE FINISH THIS ONE. JUST ONE. HOW DO WE HIT 'EM? CONGRESSMAN JENKINS. HE'S OUR IN. HE LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND TOLD ME HE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE SHOOTING. SO? LOOKED ME IN THE EYE? ???THEY'RE NOT LOOKING ME IN THE EYE. MEN ONLY REALLY LOOK A WOMAN IN THE EYE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THE EFFORT TO LIE TO HER. WELL, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT. NOTED AND FILED. ALL RIGHT, JENKINS IS DUFORT'S PET CONGRESSMAN. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM TO BIT THE BEST WAY TO GET TWO PEOPLE TO REVEAL A SECRET -- GET THEM TO TURN ON EACH OTHER. MAY I PUT THAT AWAY FOR YOU? THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A QUESTION. WASHINGTON,DC CONGRESSMAN JENKINS. OH, UM. EXECUTIVE ORDERS, THE EUROPEAN COMPANY, FROM THE FUND-RAISER, RIGHT? THAT'?RIGHT. I REMEMBER YOU FROM THE FUND-RAISER. PLEASE.(Los Angeles) TOM ABRAMS. YOU CAN CALL ME TOMMY. YOU DON'T WORK FOR CONGRESSMAN JES, DO YOU? I DO NOT. NO, I WORK FOR CONGRESSMAN CALLOwAY, FROM UPS. WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS ON THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL AHE UD STATES IN THEIR FOREIGN OPERATIONS IF THEY KNOW THAT EUROPEAN COMPANIES ARE GONNA REAP SOME OF THE BENEFITS. SOME HELP IN THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- I SUPPORT AMERICAN COMPANIES. - LIKE CASTLEMAN? - LIKE CASTLEMAN. AND THEY SUPPORT, UH, THE COUNTRY. WELL, I'M HERE BECAUSE CONGRESSMAN CALLOWAY WANTED ME TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE'S OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS NOW THAT CONGRESSMAN JENKINS HAS GONE SOFT ON YOU. JENKINS AL DELIVERS. JENKINS TOLD MY BOSS, TO HIS FACE... THAT HE'S TIRED OF COVERING FOR YOU. WE'VE BACKED HIM FOR YEARS. WELL, JES WANTED MY BOSS TO MEET THIS WOMAN FROM A BRITISH COMPANY -- EH...UH.... EXECUTIVE ORDERS. I DIDN'T PICK YOU AT RANDOM, CONGRESSMAN. CASTLEMAN CAN BE A FICKLE FRIEND. RUMOR HAS IT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME FRESH BLOOD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. IF YOUR EARMARKS AND YOUR NO-BID CONTRACTS ARE STILL IN THAT APPROPRIATIONS BILL, ??? BUT IF THEY'RE NOT, WELL, CONGRESSMAN CALLOWAY WOULD BE OPEN TO ENJOYING THE SAME FAVORS THAT JENKINS HAS ENJOYED FOR ALL THESE YEARS. BUT OF COURSE, JENKINS HAS NEW FRIENDS NOW. YOU SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR THE SIGNS, CONGRESSMAN -- MISSED PHONE CALLS... NO MORE LITTLE FAVORS. THOSE ARE THE SAME SIGNS THAT YOUR WIFE IS CHEATING ON YOU. THAT'S RIGHT. AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS? PLAY THE FIELD. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING, TOMMY. PLEASURE. CONGRESSMAN JENKINS IS VERY CAREFUL. IRECT BRIBES, BUT HE'S RENOVATING HIS HOUSE, AND SO FAR, HE'S RECEIVED OVER $600,000 WORTH OF WORK FOR A LITTLE OVER 50 GRAND. CASTLEMAN OWNS THE CONTRACTING COMPANY, HUH? I MEAN, HE'S GOING THROUGH LIKE THREE SHELL COMPANIES, BUT, YEAH. THIS MAN LOVES HIS HOUSE. JUST CHECK OUT HIS WEB-BROWSING HABITS. LOOK HERE. YOU SEE, THE MAN SPTHREE WEEKS PICKING OUT THE PERFECT MAHOGANY WOOD PANELS. THIS SITE IS LIKE WOOD PORN. IS HIS HOUSE FINISHED? NOT EVEN CLOSE. CAN I OWR PHONE? HELlo. YES. I'D LIKE TO CANCEL DELIVERY ON SOME MAHOGANY WOOD PANELING, PLEASE. - ?? - THE JENKINS HOUSE, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT, DO ME A FA MAN. JUST GO AHEAD AND CANCEL THE WHOLE ORDER. YES, SIR. WHAT'S HE DOING? YANKING THE CONGRESSMAN'S CHAIN. AHA! PARKER STARTED HER RUN YET? JUST NOW. YOU KNOW, I STILL THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME TO JUST HACK THE BILL IN THE PRINTER QUEUE. NO, NO. NO COMPUTERS, NO. A BILL IS PUT INTO A WOODEN BOX ON THE CONGRESSIONAL FLOOR CALLED THE HOPPER. A WOODEN -- WHOA, WHOA. A WOODEN -- A WOODEN BOX? - A WOODEN BOX. - woOD? OH, WE CAN PUT A MAN ON THE MOON, BUT ALL OUR LAWS GO INTO A WOODEN BOX. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS, WE NEED TO GET DUFORT TO BELIEVE THAT JENKINS IS ABANDONING HIM, THAT JENKINS SUBMITTED THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL THAT DOE HAVE ANY OF THE USUAL COntRACTS FOR CASTLEMAN, WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO PUT OUR OWN PAGES INTO THE BILL. THAT MEANS THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE COULD GET AT IT WO-- AHH! OKAY. - ??? - ?? I MEAN, BREAK A LAW, EVERYBODY'S DONE THAT. - MY MAMA'S DONE THAT. - UH-HUH. BUT STEAL A LAW... OH, SHE'S GONNA BE A LEGEND, BABY. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED. - IT'S IN. UHH! - GO AHEAD, GIRL. SEXINESS, UHH! I LIKE IT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO EASE UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. - I'M JUST SAYING, - YEAH. BETWEEN ME AND YOU. NEVER LEAVES THE ROOM. HI, SO, HOW WASHINGTON? WELL, VILLAINS, CON MEN, WOLVES IN CHEEP'S CLOTHING. I FELT RIGHT AT HOME. THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING. LISTEN TO THEM. ??This is your contractor's problem. Oh, please. Let's not pretend. You pulled all our earmarks from the appropriations... THERE'S ABOUT AN HOUR OF THIS, BUT HERE'S THE HIGH POINT. Somebody screwed up. I've always been there for you. I called Manila. I cleared customs for you in Los Angeles. And that was a risk! NOW, AFTER THAT, THERE'S -- IT'S -- WELL, WHATEVER YOU CALL THE "RICH GUYS ON TELEPHONES" VERSION OF MAKEUP SEX. BUT NOW WE KNOW, CASTN MAKES A THOUSAND SHIPMENTS A MONTH. BUT ONE SHIPPED THROMANILA, RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING, LINKED TO PHONE RECORDS OM THE CONGRESSMAN. THEIR SHIPMENTS COME THROUGH HERE. NOW, SOMEWHERE IN THIS MADNESS IS CONTAINER 541. IT'S CURRENTLY SITTING AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. WHAT'S IN IT? NO IDEA, BUT IT'S MOVING IN TWO DAYS... HEADING TO THE MAIN CASTLEMAN STORAGE FACILITY IN KANSAS. NOW, THAT -- THAT'S WHY THEY TRIED TO HIT PERRY, RIGHT THERE, THAT'S IT. YEAH, WANTED TO TIE UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS BEFORE THEY TUCK THIS ONE AWAY AT HOME BASE. WHAT DO YOU SHIP IN A CRATE FROM IRAQ? OH, BOY. SOMETHING WORTH KILLING FOR. Port of Los Angeles HOW'S SECURITY? DOCKYARD ENTRANCE IS NO PROBLEM. THERE IT IS. IT'S 541. HOLD UP, RAMBO. OKAY, NO LASERS. NO MOTION DETECTORS. NO VIBRATIONS, NO -- WHOOPS. WHAT "WHOOPS"? THERE'S A WEBCAM. I'M PICKING UP ITS BROADCAST ON MY PHONE. I SEE IT, UP ON THAT POLE. I JUST HAVE TO SPOOF THE I.P. ADDRESS AND OVERLAY A DIGITAL DUPLICATE ON THE Wi-Fi AND -- - OR THAT. - LET'S GO. COME ON. I'M SORRY IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY FOR YOU TO PUNCH. I'M SURE THAT ALLY FRUSTRATES YOU. POSITION ONE, WHAT'S YOUR STATUS? ???Just done walking the perimeter. COPY THAT. I'M ON MY WAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IN THERE? ARTIFACTS FROM BAGHDAD MUSEUMS, MAYBE SOME FROM THE SADDAM PALACES. NO, I BET IT'S WEAPONS. A LOT OF BACK-ALLEY ARMS-DEALING GOING ON IN A WAR ZONE. MONEY'S GOOD, TOO. HEY! LINE OF SIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE AWAY FROM THAT CONTAINER. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE WEBCAM. GET SOME MEN UP THEREp AND FIX THAT WEBCAM. I WANT IT WORKING IN AN HOUR. MOVE. OKAY. THAT'S WORTH KILLING FOR. ULTRAVIOLET CHECKS OUT, PAPER CHECKS OUT. THE WATERMARKS, THE INK, IT ALL CHECKS OUt. THERE'S A WHOLE CONTAINER OF IT, FROM IRAQ OF ALL PLACES. IT'S GOT TO BE COUNTERFEIT. NO, IT'S REAL. IT FEELS(zEAL. HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON? YOU AND HARDISON? WHAT IS IT, LIKE A CREEPY CONTEST? I DON'T KNOW, WHAT IS IT, $200, $300 MILLION IN U.S. CURRENCY. WHAT'S IT DOING IN IRAQ? WE SENT IT THERE. WHAT? BEGINNING OF THE IRAQ WAR, MY OLD COMPANY HELPED INSURE THE LARGEST CURRENCY TRANSFER IN HISTORY. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS IN 1s, 5s, AND 20s, ALL CASH, SENT TO IRAQ FOR RECONSTRUCTION. BRIBES. AS NEEDED. $9 BILLION WENT MISSING. WAIT. BILLION WITH A "B"? $9 BILLION OF U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY JUST... DISAPPEARED? CASTLEMAN GETS A CUT OF THE BOOTY. THE DAY THEY GO TO MOVE IT, REAL SOLDIERS, THEY SEE THE TRANSFER. ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS SPOOKS, STARTS SHOOTING. YEAH, BUT CORPORAL PERRY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. BUT CASTLEMAN'S A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY. WHY WOULD THEY EVEN CARE ABOUT THIS CASH? BECAUSE IT'S CASH. YOU KNOW, MONEY IS MONEY. THAT'S ONE THING. CASH IS A WHOLE OTHER THING. FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE ECONOMY, THERE'S ONLY ABOUT $500 IN CASH FOR EVERY AMERICAN, THAT'S IT. UNTRACEABLE SMALL BILLS -- PERFECT FOR SLUSH FUNDS, OR, UM... IMPROVEMENTS FOR A U.S. CONGRESSMAN. SMALL-TIME DONORS, YOU KNOw, FOR RE-ELECTION. NO ELECTROTRAIL. IT'S MONEY-LAUNDERING. HOW SO? ALL RIGHT, WELL, CASTLEMAN USES THE ILLEGAL CASH TO RE-ELECT HIS CONGRESSMAN. CONGRESSMAN GETS HIM NO-BID CONTRACTS FOR GOVERNMENT JOBS. AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT... ...PAYS FOR HIS SERVICES WITH LEGAL MONEY. AND THERE'S THE CIRCLE RIGHT THERE. THEY TURNED THE ENTIRE U.S. GOVERNMENT INTO A MONEY-LAUNDERING SCAM. - THAT'S RIGHT. - ???I'M IMPRESSED. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS, EVER -- THAt IS JUST WAY TOO MUCH MONEY TO STEAL. NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA STEAL IT. YOU DON'T REMEMBER? YOU'RE THE GOOD GUYS NOW. YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK. Port of Los Angeles CHECK THE PERIMETER. START YOUR ROUNDS.
