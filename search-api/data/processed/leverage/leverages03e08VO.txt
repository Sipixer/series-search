According to the reports, the driver is a school teacher from Massachusetts,</i> not exactly our typical car jacker. We've no confirmation on... Wait a minute. Something's happening.</i> Driver, pull over! Pull over now! Season 3 Episode 8 The Boost Job - You're making a mistake. - Sir, step away from the vehicule. - Step away from the vehicle! - It's a misunderstanding. - Face down on the ground! - I didn't steal the truck! - It's a misunderstanding. - All the way down! All the way! This is my truck. I didn't steal it. I paid for it, all right? Hold on. Can we just talk for a second? I didn't steal the truck! The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys. We provide leverage! I mean, if it wasn't my truck, why was I making all those car payments? Let me ask you something, why'd you run? I know. I shouldn't have. But I panicked. - But I didn't do anything wrong. - You bought it used? Yeah, from Penzer's a few months ago for my landscaping business. You can't really get by on just a teacher's pay these days, not with a family. And how did you find out it was stolen? I went to a job in Nashua and the "check engine" light came on, so I took it to a mechanic, and he tells me that the truck's onboard computer spit out a fishy vehicle identification number. So the vin number was reported as stolen. I figured it was a mix-up and took off. Next thing I know, I'm the poster boy for "America's most wanted". I appreciate you bailing me out, Mr. Ford. But what do I do now? The cops seized the truck. The bank says I still have to make good on the loan. The school suspended me because of the pending criminal charges. I keep thinking: "How did this all happen?" It's called car cloning. Thieves steal a vehicle then go to another state, where they find a car of the same make and model and use its vin number. Then, using those numbers, they register the stolen vehicle in the first state. And since each state runs its own vin database, the hot car comes up clean. Now, Paul Mantlo, he had the bad luck of wandering from Massachusetts into new Hampshire, where the vin was copied. - And of buying a stolen car. - Where'd he get the car? Duke Penzer, he's a former race car driver. He parlayed some minor success on the lower circuits to start his own used-car dealership out in Payden, Massachusetts. Hi, folks. I'm Duke Penzer. In my racing days, old Veronica here never let me down.</i> You come on down to the finish line at Penzer automotive,</i> and we'll make sure we don't let you down.</i> He still runs laps on the weekends. He tries to keep up his image. I checked out some of his prices, and they're sick. 20%, 25% below blue book. It's easy to offer great deals when your inventory's stolen. How's he getting the cars? He's not nicking them himself. - Good question. I haven't found... - He's the distributor. The suppliers are probably a car-theft ring. That way, cops trace a hot car to him, he can say he got it from someone who's long gone. Besides, the scam falls between state jurisdictions, so... I was a car thief. That's how I know. All right. So, Penzer is a big fish in a small pond. We need to muddy up the waters. Hardison, you get us a base? Art's Auto Sales. A little mom-and-pop shop down the road from Penzer's. It's run by Art and Joy Bauer. Been in the community for decades, but Penzer's running them out of business. They're on the verge of bankruptcy. It gets awfully wet this time of year in Payden, doesn't it? And chilly. Don't you think the Bauers need a little sun and fun? Little R&R? Which is why, on behalf of the American auto dealers association, we'd like to honor you, the Bauers, with this lifetime achievement award. As part of this prize, you'll receive an all-expenses-paid trip to Tahiti! Say Hawaii. The tahitian reservation systems are for crap. I mean Hawaii! For two whole weeks... - <i>10 days.</i> - 10 days. Do you know what's going on? But since we've already laid off the staff, at this point, shutting down for a couple of weeks will actually save us money. I'll pack my speedo. All right, we're in. Now what? Now? Start your engines. Ladies and gentlemen, Payden, Massachusetts' very own Duke Penzer</i> now coming into pit row. 1 min 10.36. Not too bad considering I got loose in turn three. - Still a track record. - Not exactly. What are you talking about? That was faster than my last run. Both times were just beaten. Somebody beat my record? Who? What was his time? - He beat your record by 15 seconds. - What? That's impossible! It is? I meant 1.5 seconds. - Sorry. I must've read that wrong. - You think? That was one of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride! Hey, there, junior. What's with the jammies? What do you got in that thing? A supercharger? Hell, I don't know. My guys just picked this up somewhere. I just figured I'd kick the tires. What's that? A matchbox car? What do you think, darling? I think I want to go now. Go? We just got here. I'm asking you if you think I should buy these wheels. - Veronica's not for sale. - "Veronica"? So Betty was the fast one. Who knew? - Look, mister... - Lucas. A.J. Lucas. I don't know who you think you are... I think I'm the guy that just broke your track record, if I'm not mistaken. One good time trial don't make you a racer. Let's do it, kid. Let's mix it up. Let's go! You and me, right now. But I'll tell you what. We're gonna do it old school. I win, I get your car. You win, you get my car. Plus... other considerations. I doubt you could handle either. Green flag... 15. Excuse me. - Yes, Mr. Penzer? - Run along, Todd. I changed the compression on the pistons and opened up the valves. Should get about another 75 hp. I think the left bank is running a little lean. I tweaked that. Head looks good on the flux. You'll get a better burn on your fuel. How's the rest of your research coming? Good. I found out a bunch of the local thieves work for a guy named Lefty. - You know how to find him? - Got some ideas. When we're done here, that'll be your priority... infiltrate their gang. All right. Now, look, man, I just installed this. You punch it to release an oxidized chemical into the engine. It's my own little mix. It's kind of like nitrous but three times the kick. It's gonna turn your manifold into pudding, so don't use it too soon. Hey, man, I'm serious. Don't mess my car up. You know, we still got to find a way to slow down Penzer. I got you covered... EMP cannon. It emits a focused electromagnetic pulse that'll knock out all the electronics in his car for 30 minutes. This chick is toast. I installed one next to your rear exhaust. It's the only place where it wouldn't affect your car as well. You show me how to trigger it. You don't. I do. I'll hit him from right here. All I need you to do... is get in front of Penzer, line up so I can get a clear shot. He'll just think he stalled. 30 minutes, his car is good as new. All right. Let's do it. You didn't get that? "This chick is toast"? It's "Ghostbusters". I don't listen to you. "Don't cross the streams"? It's classic. Push the car, man. That all you got? - You got to get in front of him. - I know that, Hardison! I'm trying! What's going on here? Come on! I'll send my guys to pick up the car. Rookie mistake. All right. The mark is primed. Hardison, Parker, go find this Lefty. Everyone else, let's go steal us some cars. Where the hell is everybody? This place ought to be hopping. - They're all at art's. - Art's? - They've got new management. - Comfy? - But it's the playoffs. - It is about to be the layoffs. Here. I checked them out on the way in. He's raffling off my car? But on the bright side, at least Mr. Carey's still here. Great. We got Carey doing his weekly looky-loo. - We need paying customers. - Yes. - Todd? - Yes, sir? Is this... a raffle ticket? Yeah, it is. - It's mine. - Unbelievable! Get off of Facebook! Look at this. There's no way he's making money. Prices are only part of it. He's got a new salesperson who's unstoppable. Who? - Wait. I know her. - She was at the track. All right, Sophie. You're up. Look. She's going after Mr. Carey now. - Hi, there. - That ought to cool her off. Before you say anything, I don't need any help. I'm just looking. Of course. I'm not gonna bother you. I just have one little question. Atkins or south beach? What? What diet are you on? 'Cause I can see your... your belt is cinched too tight and your shirt is a size too big. You've lost what, five, six pounds recently? Seven, actually. Seven! Congratulations. That is quite an achievement. Thank you. That requires so much discipline, you know? Denying yourself all that sweet food, all those tasty treats... Now, you see her touch the car when she says "sweet" and "tasty"? She's making him link those values to the car. Neurolinguistic programming. I couldn't do it. I can't deny myself such pleasure. You know, for me, life is about seizing opportunities, you know? Live life to the fullest. Drink too much wine. Skinny-dip in the ocean. Make love in a hammock. Do you know why... Just as an example. Why driving this car is like making love to a beautiful woman? Because I've never done either before in my life? What? A cute guy like you? Now is your chance. Just take a look. Who knows where it might lead? If Sophie did this full time, the auto industry's troubles would disappear. - Is he signing a contract? - I think he is. I think he's crying. There's the stall-out king himself. How you doing? Whatever. I came back here to buy Veronica. Sorry, I'm not gonna give back my trophy. - I'll give you $150,000 for her. - Please. How about $300,000? $300,000? That's ridiculous! - Be reasonable. - <i>Claro que si. Uno momento, por favor.</i> - What is it, Skeeter? - Mr. Lucas, you should take this call. - It's our foreign friends. - All right. - <i>Uno momento.</i> - Come here. Si? - I need you to sign off on this paper. - Not now, honey. I'm busy. The customer's ready to write the check. Now, did I hire you to look pretty or ask stupid questions? Come on, now. Move on. Si. He stole my baby. I think I know how to steal his. Could've done without the ass slap. Yeah, just trying to sell the bit. Sorry. Hardison, Parker, ball's in your court. So, you stole this car? Exactly how is this gonna get us Lefty's attention? Car thieves are territorial. You bring a car like this to a local chop shop, every boost in town knows there's a new player. Also this is Lefty's car. Yo, my man. Heard you're the man to see about chopping a car. Maybe. You jacked this car? - This car? - Yeah. How much? Give me a minute. Hello, Lefty. Shouldn't be long now. So... Car thief... How'd that happen? Started when I was about 12. I met this kid Kelly in foster system. He was about four or five years older. Taught me how to make a slim Jim, how to use a jiggler key, you know. What happened to Kelly? We boosted a bait car. He saw the cops coming and ran. I never saw it coming. He left you behind? Never looked back. Spent six months in Juvie and never saw Kelly again. All right. Here we go. - So, how is this going down? - They're gonna want us off their turf. Wehave to convince them they need us. It's not gonna be easy, - and they might shoot you a little. - What? - You are spectacular. - I beg your pardon. As a salesman. 20 years in this business, I've never seen a better closer, miss... Bacich. Katie Bacich. Thank you, Mr. Penzer. Please, call me Duke. Yes. Spectacular. Why don't you let me buy you a drink? I know the best spot in town. - Mr. Penzer... - Duke. Duke, do me a favor. Don't sell a salesman. I know when I'm being set up for a pitch. Maybe so. But don't you want to know what I'm selling? You picked the wrong car to boost. No, we didn't. Lefty. Who are you? - I'm Danielle. This is major. - What's up? - We want to join your crew. - We're full up. You need us. We stole your car, didn't we? That? Anybody can steal that. But nobody's dumb enough to do it. Can anyone steal a car that uses a laser-cut rolling-code transponder key? Impossible. Those systems are unboostable. We can do it... In under two minutes. All right. Show me you can steal an unstealable car. Two minutes, or else. Two minutes. Don't break the window or crack the steering column. All right. Do your thing. I have no idea how to break into this car. What? It's new tech. Screwdriver and a coat hanger ain't gonna cut it. Once we get in, I could probably start it, but we got to get in. And what, we get... How are we gonna get in, Parker? - Me? No. - You can hack anything with a battery. You now have one minute and 30 seconds. Look, you can do this. - What's the hardware behind this door? - The latch mechanism is connected to an actuator. Send electrical signal to the actuator, door unlocks. - So the chip controls the signal. - That's what you need the remote code. I can send an rf signal, but you said rolling code, so that means billions of combinations. Ignore the distractions. It's the first rule of the boost. All right, look, I can't crack the code, but I may be able to confuse the receiver. I got it! I got it. I got it. All right. 15 seconds. Transponder-equipped cars have backdoor startup sequences, an override. It's like a cheat code for a video game, so it should work. Assuming they haven't changed the sequence since I last did this. I forgot how much fun this is. Not bad. All right. Bring this to my shop, and we'll talk. Keep an eye on them. So this is the best spot in town. Absolutely. This is the winner's circle. Which is why I want you to come to work for me. I've already got a job. I'll double your salary. That's very generous, but I'm not looking... you're a tool to him. Me? I'm looking to build something. And for that, I need a partner. Once he's gone, I'll let you run that shop. But you got to do something for me. Tell me about his setup. - How can he offer those deals? - <i>Don't get too specific.</i> Let him fill in the blanks. He works with... Alternative suppliers. Fleet sales? Suppliers with... minimal costs. He's selling hot cars. Good. He's figured out the first part of the equation. - Eliot, give him the rest. - <i>Yeah, making the call now.</i> Hello, officer? Yes, ma'am. I'd like to report some unsavory characters wandering around downtown. They had tattoos, and I think they were wearing gang colors, and I'm pretty sure they were speaking Spanish. Yeah, I saw them walking around down by Penzer's auto. Yes, ma'am. Chop shop, quick and dirty sales. There's gonna be one, or two guys in here cutting up their latest catch. We're gonna need a bigger boat. What's going on? Trying to find out. Stand by. Got to scan for alarm tracking systems. Don't want cops zeroing in on a radio signal we miss. It's clean. Follow me. You see, selling cars doesn't have to be some grubby little... Son of a... this is terrible. Let me get my phone. I'll call the police. Don't call the police. I don't need a bunch of deputy dawgs snooping around here. What? You're working the same scam as A.J. - You're just like him. - No. I am nothing like him! It's Duke. Get me Lefty. Phone! Over here is your traditional chop shop. We can strip a car and get its parts to anywhere in the country in 24 hours. They do vin cloning over here. Clean a hot car and get it a full set of papers in an hour. What's that over there? You know how everyone keeps their registration and insurance in the glove box? We take those and use them for identity theft. Girls don't boost cars. At least that's what these guys keep telling me. But you... you kicked ass. That thing you did with your phone? Can you teach me that? Let's just go by the computers... - Nate, did you get all that? - Yes, I did. It's a mall of crime. Yes, I know. But the plan does not change. Why don't we just call the cops? We've got more than enough to bust these guys. These guys are too careful. They'd scatter before the cops got there. Besides, closing down the shop won't nail Penzer. No, we stick to our plan. No, we catch them red-handed planning something big. Sophie, did Penzer put 2 and 2 together yet?</i> Doing the math now. No. Shut up! Shut up! I just want to know who did this. We picked up a call on the police scanner earlier... some gangbangers causing trouble near you. Gangbangers? Speaking Spanish. Mr. Lucas, I think you should take this call. Uno momento. It's Lucas. He's working with the Latins. Running the boost? The only crew who can move that kind of volume are the Salvadorans, but they're Florida. They're branching out, you idiot. You mean the Salvadorans are here? Yes, they're here. They're probably clearing a path for Lucas - and keeping an eye on him. - <i>He's crazy.</i> Salvadorans are brutal. Yeah. Yeah, they are. If Lucas were to, say... I don't know... lose one of their shipments, they probably wouldn't be too happy about that, would they? Gotcha. Your boss did this. - A.J. is a jerk, but he wouldn't... - The question is, do you want to work for somebody who does this... Or do you want to work for someone who's bringing modern business principles to the game. - What are you talking about? - Diversified products, marketing metrics, on line opportunities... that is what I'm bringing to the table. I'm not talking about stickup men and strung-out joyriders. I'm taking this business to the next level. I want to see your operation. All right. First thing tomorrow. And all you got to do is tell me when Lucas' next shipment comes in. Tomorrow morning at the docks... nine cars, top end and very hot. Now... Let's go finish that drink. Exactly how is that gonna help you order pizzas better? Slide. Don't stab. Feel it catch on the lock rod. Forget them. Just tune out the distractions. Work the problem. This model has a weakness. Here. Short out the posts on the solenoid. Thanks. Ignore those idiots, okay? They've been sucking exhaust fumes for too long. They're not bad. They just don't want me screwing up on a real boost. I don't know where I'd go if they didn't let me hang out with them. Josie. Josie Marvin. Here. These might help. Listen up! We've got a top order tomorrow morning down at the docks... nine cars. So I'm gonna need all hands on deck. Even you, shorty. Nate, the hook is set. All right. Go and get me some bait. Listen to me. Don't go on the boost tomorrow. Call in sick, sleep in late, don't show up. Are you a cop? But trust me, you don't want to be there. They're all going down. And stay away from the shop, too. I don't understand... These guys don't care about you. They're not your family. Tell me exactly what she said. Tell that this boost was trouble. And to stay clear of here. And then those two just showed up out of nowhere? But they know how to boost. This can't be a coincidence. It's Lucas. - He's setting me up. - You want us to call it off? We can turn this around. Go down to the docks early, surprise them. Pack up the shop, they're expecting to trap us here. - Where should we take the cars, then? - Bring 'em to my lot. And the new guys? Kill them. Dump them down by the docks. Wait. What? You don't need to do that. Just kick them out. "Just kick them out"? - This isn't a tree house, sweetheart. - No, but you don't... shut up! Do me a favor. Grow a pair. This is business. Lefty should be hitting the shipment in about an hour. Hour and a half. He called to push back our time. Well, that'll give Eliot more time to offload the cars. It'll also give you more time to bring Penzer down to Lefty's. - And once he's there, we call the cops. - And we catch Penzer, Lefty, and the crew with the stolen cars. By which point, we'll have already done the blow-off. Let's go. Get out of the truck. Back away from the cars. Don't want to damage the merchandise. Toss us the keys. You want 'em? Get him! He went that way! Go! Come on! Hustle! Get him! Where is he? He's gone. We got the cars. Good, good. They clean? Checking them now. Once they're done, I'll bring them to the lot. Guys will stay to handle the other loose ends. Great. I got something here I'm gonna need you to handle. Thank you. So I'm anxious to see this operation of yours. Of course. Wait, wait. Where is everybody? Cars aren't even here. Where are you? Something's not right. - Go! - Nate, we're blown! What? All right, Parker, Hardison, hold tight. Eliot? Sophie, you got to get out of there. Excuse me. I just have to use the ladies room. Sit down. Sophie, I'm on my way. - <i>Parker, Hardison, I need your help.</i> - Well, handle it. Now? All right. I'll be right there. You stay put. You got nowhere to hide. Time's up. "Nate," is it? Let's go. I don't know who you people are, and I don't care. I've spent my whole life beating pissants like you. Sit down! Now, we're all just gonna sit here and wait for my associate, 'cause he's much better at the... Mechanical stuff. Great rescue. What's so funny? Nate and Sophie. There's got to be another car around here somewhere. Get in! Shotgun. Get in the back! Nate, we're on our way. Be there in 10. Cars are here. Shop's closed up. Kip and the boys are mopping up down at the dock. Great. Take these two with you. Quietly. Don't want to attract a lot of attention with all the hot cars on the lot. Don't worry. We scanned them. No signals coming out of them. Let's go! Get up! Shall we? I was trying to help you. You weren't supposed to tell them. I didn't know that, I didn't think they'd try to kill you. Wait. Hold up. You told her? I should've known. You're a menace, Parker. She deserved a chance! - Nate's gonna kill you. - I'm gonna kill you. Stop whining! I got hit by a car! "I got hit by a car." Get over it! I'm gonna kill her. Nobody's gonna kill anybody. - Seriously, Nate's gonna kill you. - Who are you people? We're the good guys! - Stall. - What? Stall! You are such an idiot! I can't believe I ever listened to you! We're in this again! - It wasn't me! - What are you yapping about? Nobody asked you! Damn it! Parker, where'd you learn to drive? Before I stole cars, I was a getaway driver. Before? You started stealing cars when you were 12. Pull to the side of the road! Pull over!</i> Get out of the way, you old bat! Get out of the way, you old bat! This is what I get for trusting a drunk! No, not again! Nobody asked you... I'm the one that ends up paying for it every time! What the hell? Lefty. Take them inside. Put them in the office. Keep them quiet. I'll take care of this. Damn it! Officers! Just a little, small snafu. It's all under control now. - Those vehicles belong to you? - Yes, they do. Came in this morning. Perhaps I could interest you in a deal. - These are yours? - Yeah. Is there a problem? Yes, there is. According to the massive number of alarm tracking system signals we're receiving, all these cars are stolen. What? Don't worry. We scanned them. No signals coming out. I just aim this thing at them and zap them? Yeah, man. They'll be good as dead for half an hour. There's got to be a huge mistake. I just took delivery of that shipment this morning. You know what? The guy you want is right inside. Come on. Slide over! What's up, man? Check all the cars in this lot. Who knows what else is going on here? Come on. Sir. Please be calm. It'll be a lot easier for both of us. Come on. I don't get it. I've never seen cops respond so fast to an alarm tracking signal. How'd you know they'd get here so quickly? Let's just say the owners of those vehicles were highly motivated. Maz, how come you didn't comm us when those wannabe thugs attacked? 'Cause your little zapper thing fried my ear bud. Told you to take it out before you used it. I was also underwater. - I should work on that. - Yeah. Eliot, here. Make sure you bring this back with us. The Bauers are gonna have a little bump in business when they get back. - I could've done without the knee. - Just selling the bit. She almost got us killed. She thought she was doing the right thing, which means she actually thought about what the right thing might be, which is huge for Parker. Just go easy on her, will you? I need you to help me. With Penzer's arrest, all the charges against you have been dropped. And here. Penzer's racecar - worth about $150,000, maybe more to a collector. I can't repay this. No, no. There's no need for that. But, that could go toward maybe jump-starting your landscaping business, and... you might want to consider maybe hiring some new help. She's a quick study, and she's eager to work. Thanks again. All right. - Have you ever done any landscaping? - Not really, but like she said, I'm a fast learner, so... - We'll see ya. - Okay. Thanks. - Well, you know, she's not a bad kid. - No, she isn't. She's just got to be around the right people. Yeah. Don't we all? You saw me take down that guy, right? - The little guy? Yeah. - He wasn't little. He's pretty... He had big shoulders. I want to say thank you. Thank you, by the way. Why? For the car. Any time you want to borrow it, it's yours, man. It's fast.
