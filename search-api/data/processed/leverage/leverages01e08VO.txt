In the water to ashley's death. Because of her pre-Existing condition. She had a thyroid condition. But that had nothing to do with her lungs, her heart. And they found these... masses in her chest, And... Our doctor testified, But genogrow trotted out all these experts... Who were paid to say exactly what haldeman wanted them to. It's not about the money. I mean, people like haldeman, They need to know that they can't get away with this. They need to pay. The problem is, our attorney doesn't think we can win. Burden of proof. You need evidence that genogrow knew What could happen If the fertilizer was leaked into the water supply. We've been trying to get access to their research reports, But their lawyers keep stonewalling. Trade secrets, they said. Means they're hiding something. Means there's a smoking gun. And we are gonna find it. www.1000fr.Com present capture:frm@·ëîµ sync:frm@°®ð¦µäñû¾¦</font> Bonsoir. La soir?E est ici, non? Excuse me? Ze rave party is here? I'm afraid you're in the wrong place, miss. This is an office building -- You know, where people come to work? I work hard ze dance floor. I'm sure you do. I don't understand. My pgs c'est ne marche pas. Is -- How you say is, Is broken. - You help mich?Le? - Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. C'est completement cass?. Nothing. There is no signal. Allen haldeman, c.E.O. 30th floor. You see? You know, i used to work with ham radios - When i was a kid. - Ah, bon? You are good with your hands, i think. Oui. You are my hero. They're locked down -- Security timer. We need a key card. And i hate to say it, But you know who we could really use -- Don't even say his name. I don't want it spoken aloud. Target's on the 30th floor. You don't really expect us to -- Great. Another key card. I'm gonna kill him. Not if i get to him first. Okay, parker. Let's try. Go! Yeah, buddy! Damn it! Got it. Corner office. So, we're looking for some kind of paper trail? Safety studies, research data Anything that proves they knew the fertilizer was unsafe prior to releasing it. Come on, come on. I'm going as fast as i can, okay? This thing's taking forever to boot up. Hello? Hey, hey, hey! Hey, guys. W- What's up? Where are you? I'm at the office. What happened -- There was a thing -- M- My electricity went out. I swear, when i see you -- My electricity, man -- You're not listening. I'm out of options at this point. We got company. What? Okay, i'm hacking into their security system. Visual range in 10 seconds. Nine I'm in. I'm in. - Eight...seven... - ???? Six... five... Parker! - ...Four... - ??? - I know. I know. - ...three... - Guys? - ...two... It's haldeman. We're gonna get slammed once those epa subpoenas are executed. If i don't do something now, i'm gonna lose the company. It's all on that caymans flight. All the assets, everything. Yes, the 1209. Takes off in an hour. Look, i need someone i can trust to keep an eye on this for me. So i need to know... Are you that guy? Good. Good. Hardison, you get all that? Assets and a flight to the caymans? He's liquidating. Firewalling. He's gonna bankrupt the agricultural division. If that part of the company ceases to exist, It'll become a mess of creditors. Wiping out any chance our clients have At winning the civil suit. We got to get on that plane. Boss, he said it leaves in an hour, And the airport's clear across town. Even if traffic's good, we're still -- These people killed a kid, all right? They killed abunch of kids. There's no way in hell we're gonna let them get away with it. We are going to get on that flight. All right. So, what are we waiting for? How does she do this? I don't even ask anymore. Don't bother with the stairs. I got you a ride down. Is, um, how you say, um... is far from here? Far from -- No. Not very far at all. See, this is us right here. - And my house -- - Your house? Hardison, we need those tickets. I'm working on it. All right, i got two seats in first class. Okay, sophie and i will take those. What i.D.S have you got on you? Let's see... We got, peter davison, Sylvester mccoy, and i have a tom baker. Yeah.I have a baker. Sarah jane. Perfect. I now pronounce you man and wife. Now go on and kiss that bride. And now for you, eliot. Hardison, i don't need a ticket. I got an air marshal badge. What if there's already a marshal on the plane? There's only one air marshal per every 100 flights. I know that's good for us, but i so wish i didn't know that. One authority figure's good. Two's better. Parker, you're about to get a day job. Hello? Hi, yeah, sorry to bother you, ma'am, But i'm calling from the westchester animal control. We just got a felis catus in here by the name of fidget. Oh, my god -- Fidget! Is he all right? Yes, he's fine, ma'am. He's fine. But you might want to get down here quick as you can. We can only hold unclaimed animals for a certain amount of time before... ...you know. Okay, i'll, uh, i'll be right there. Just keep an eye on him, okay? I'm on my way! I'm sorry! I'm in a rush -- Kitty emergency. How did you both know there'd be an extra uniform in the bag? Everyone knows flight attendants are required to carry extra uniforms In case they get called to work unexpectedly. Or if something happens to the one that they're already wearing. How does "everyone" know that? - Worked airport security. - Slept with a flight attendant. What? We needed luggage. Lost and found. You didn't check the bag first? We were in a bit of a hurry. Yeah. Cuffs are his. Whip's mine. Second honeymoon. Let's see what we can learn about nathan ford today. Online poker? Online chess? Sudoku. Crossword. What... Damn. Somebody needs to get laid. Hardison. What's up? Yeah? Are you in my chair? N- No, i -- I'm not -- I'm not in your -- I'm at a desk -- Mydesk -- In my office, W- Waiting on your call So you can tell me what i can do to help you A- And the team, boss. What's up? - You can stop now. - Appreciate it. I need you to go back to genogrow. What for? The assets are on the plane. We grab the money, give it to the client. They don't even need to go ahead with the lawsuit. We are taking this company down. Not this lawsuit, not the epa -- Us. And i need you to finish what we started. Find the smoking gun. I'm on it. - And, hardison? - Yeah? Don't forget to turn off my computer. Well, how in the hell... ??? Thank you. There's, um, there's two in here. That's my husband. ??? I'm in coach. Hey. Sorry i'm late. Who are you? Where's becky? She got promoted. Did you not get the e-Mail? She got promoted? She only started a few months ago. She must really know how to pick 'em. A few more layovers,and she'll be piloting one of these things, huh? Okay, so, um... If we're gonna play "happy family," We should, you know, really get our background straight. Let's keep it simple -- Use our own backstory. Our wedding day is the day we met. Which means we've been married for - 8 years. - 10 years. You don't remember when we met. No, of course i do. I was just rounding it off. By subtracting two years? Is this gonna be a thing? A couple of years. Place the mask over your mouth and nose and breath normally. In the event of a water landing, Your seat cushion can be used as a flotation device. But let's face it, If this thing goes down in the water, More than likely the impact will kill you. Please take a moment to locate the nearest emergency exits. Because if this plane's on fire, You're gonna want to get out quick. Jet fuel burns at over 1,000 degrees. That's hot, folks. All right, nate. We're here. Now what? Yeah, well, First we have to figure out What we're looking for and who's got it. Then we have to steal it And get it off the plane without anyone noticing. And we have to do that before the plane lands in... 51/2 hours. So... Business as usual, then. ?????? ??????? Would you like a drink, ma'am? Nothing for me, thanks. Anything for you, sir Yes. Some orange juice. And a splash of vodka Excuse me What? I was just hoping that i could get a ginger ale. Yeah, i'll get to you in a minute. It's just that i have a nervous stomach, So if you wouldn't mind... There's a system. I'm not feeling very well If you're gonna hurl, use this. Okay. Hi, there. ?????? Why can we still hear her, anyway? I thought these things would stop working once We were in the air. You're welcome. And if you're curious, I hacked it from the plane's wi-Fi connection And piggybacked our signal onto it. The comms will work as long as you guys stay on this side of the atmosphere. Hardison, where are you? About to head in. What's your plan? Do you need parker to walk you through -- Don't worry about it. I got this. Hola, se?Or. Tengo los koi. Los pescados que me diste -- D?Nde los ponga? - What? - Muy, muyexpensive. You know, fish -- Muerte, muerte, mi muerte. The fish, man -- Sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle. And, you know, i go. I go. Gracias. Gracias. Hey, just make sure you check in with the receptionist! - What? - Nothing.It's just... I could've sworn i saw a maintenance guy get in that elevator. A- A maintenance guy? Wow. Real nice. I bet you think we all look alike. That's not what i meant. You know what -- If i have to go to one more of those damn sensitivity seminars, I know who i'm blaming. No, no, no. I know who i'm blaming. - It's not what i meant. - I blame you! You! This is impossible. It could be anyone. Not anyone. We can rule out the elderly, anyone with kids, everyone under 25. I count 14 possibles here in coach. Yeah, and six more in first class. If haldeman's entrusting his assets to a courier, I'm guessing he's gonna pay for the extra leg room. So we should focus on carry-On. No one checks bags full of cash. Might not be cash. What's it gonna be, parker? Gold bars? They don't exactly travel well. No, parker's right. We could be looking at traveler's checks or bearer bonds - Anything that packs light. - Got it. Can i help you with something? Watch the movie. Excuse me. Could i have a ginger ale, please? You've already had two. I know. It's just -- It's like a placebo effect. It's not really working, But it makes you feel better anyway. Yeah? So, when's that supposed to kick in? Look. Flying isn't really all that scary when you think about it. I mean, there are a lot more likely ways to die than on a plane Car crash, house fire, electrocution, drowning, Autoerotic asphyxiation. I mean, the fact is, death haunts us every day. No matter where we are. - I'm sorry. - Are you okay? A little bit of turbulence there. Yeah. A little bit. I know i got you -- Got you all rumpled. I'm fine. I'm really fine. I'm not so good on planes. Me neither. - Here's your bag. - Thank you so much. You know what that reminded me of? Yes -- Paris. What? It wasn't paris. It was tuscany. Are you sure? No, i could've sworn it was paris. It was tuscany. It's a thing now, isn't it? Yeah. ???? ??? Let me tell you I have been working my butt off on this account. But steve -- No, He's just sitting back, waiting for me to fail. So he can swoop in and save the day. I swear, it's like he's a rogue and i'm a mage And we're part of the same guild, But secretly, he's at work with the alliance to undermine us. - For the horde. - For the horde. You play "world of warcraft?" You kidding? Did you get the new expansion pack? Woman, i was up all night. Now, look, i mean "burning crusade" was great, But this new one is mind-Blowing. Hardison. You bailed on the job Because you were up all night playing a game? First off, "game" is hardly adequate, okay? Have you even gotten into haldeman's office, Or have you found a way to screw that up, too? I'll figure something out. You can't skate by on talent and luck forever. The meeting's starting, sir. What meeting? See, the world is a 24/7/365 process-Centric marketplace. I'm talking e-Commerce, e- Vector, e-Management. But genogrow? I mean, frankly, I'm a little concerned about our future. And i'm not the only one. Am i right, frank? Right on, brother. People, it is time for us to repurpose, rescale, reconceptualize. Okay, we will take this company And turn it into an assertively dominant catalyst for change. Let's make tactical supply chains sexy again, people. Who's with me? My man. You're a believer. You are a believer, sir. I like -- Y- You all right, dave? Seafood burrito -- It was a bad call. Steve, my man, you know what? Can you take over for me? I appreciate that. Thank you. Everybody, i'm gonna just handle that. I'm gonna be back after...steve. Well, come on, steve. I don't have all day. Right. Hatbox full of euros, Pouch of uncut diamonds, and a stolen stradivarius. Now, i've never lifted one of those. - Parker... - This is insane. Between the four of us, We've found millions of dollars of merchandise. None of it belongs to genogrow. Cayman islands -- Thieves holiday. Go for the tan, stay for the tax shelter. Haldeman's not the only bad guy doing business there. Guys, i got something. I've been cross-Checking the flight's passenger manifest With genogrow's company roster. I got two hits Dan erlick, head of security, ex-Navy seal. Been with the company the last six years. And marissa devins, an accountant. She's only been with the company about 10 months. Weird thing is, they're not seated together. I mean, erlick is in first class, The accountant's in coach. Well, it could just be a coincidence They're on the same flight. Then how come both seats were paid for by the same corporate credit card At the exact same time? Divide and conquer. Okay, erlick's in first class. Sophie and i will take him. Seems likely he's our guy. Parker, stay with the accountant, just in case. Nate, can we at least take the diamonds? Sophie... Sending their photos to your phones now. Okay. - Is there a problem? - No. - Oh, hey. - Wow, thank you. So, how you feeling? - A little bit better. - Good. So, uh, if you hate flying, why do it? Oh, this isn't by choice. This is a business trip. To the caymans? Wow. Who's picking up the tab? Genogrow industries. Yeah, i think i heard someone else on board Saying they worked there -- A dan something. I don't know. They didn't tell me anyone else was going. But again, nobody tells me anything. If i was important to you, you'd remember. They're just stupid details! It doesn't mean you're not important! Don't yell at me. - It just means - I just don't think you... Oh, yeah, go on. Yeah, walk away. Like you always do. - You okay? - Yeah. Sorry about that. Let me buy you a drink. No, no, no. I shouldn't. Well, maybe just a glass of what you're having. Was that your husband? For now, anyway. Dan erlick. Nice to meet you, dan erlick. Nice to meet you. I hacked into erlick's phone records. And he did call haldeman right before takeoff, So your theory fits. But? But it's this accountant that's got me curious. I'm standing outside her office right now. I think this woman knows more than she's supposed to. You know, when we heard that haldeman had assets on the plane, We assumed it was currency. But what if it wasn't? What if it was a person? Okay, but... then that means... That marissa devins is the asset they're liquidating. - I think??? - No way. That woman's already paranoid-Crazy. We tell her there's a bounty on her head, And she's gonna lose it. I think she has a right to know. Anyway, if haldeman's going to this much trouble, Then she must have something -- Some information that could help us help our client. She's our smoking gun. Okay. Tell her. - Don't say i didn't warn you. - No, not you  eliot. He's got a badge -- Makes the story more credible. How much longer do you think it's gonna be? I mean, i know it's only been three hours, But maybe there's a strong tailwind. - Feels like we're going awfully fast. - Excuse me, ma'am. I'm a u.S. Air marshal. Could you come with me, please? - Okay. - Thank you. Sir, this is first class. You're not -- Excuse me. I need you to tell me about genogrow. Your boss is a mr. Allen haldeman, right? And he sent you on this trip? Yeah, a-After i noticed some accounting irregularities In our agricultural chemistry division. What kind of irregularities? Safety studies One of the new fertilizers that the company launched last year. See, the checks were cut, But there was never any confirmation That the studies were actually completed. And some of the payments to the researchers Were -- Well, abnormally large. And you brought this up with haldeman? And you brought this up with haldeman? He assured me it was a process error. That's why i'm here -- To audit the offshore accounts and then correct it. Hush money. What? Ms. Devins, those payments were not made in error. They were bribes. He was trying to pay offthe researchers so they would not testify. What are you talking about? - What the hell is going on here? - The guy in 1d wants to kill you. Ginger ale? Just -- So it's a hit. How does it lay out? If i was gonna do it, I'd have two guys on the ground at the gate, One guy on the plane to make sure she gets off. Well, i think it's time you introduce yourself?????? It was just an opinion. You don't need to jump down my throat. You can't knock down an idea without offering alternatives. I don't know, steve. I got to go with cheryl on this one. I mean, genetically engineered tomatoes that's one thing. - But carrot on the cob? - Yeah. That's gonna scare some people, brother. Thank you, dave. It's nice to know at least someone around here respects me.</i> Is this about that conference in omaha? Hardison? It was an accident, and i totally apologized. Yeah, boss? I want haldeman's hard drive. Grab it and get out of there. I barely got him out of his office the first time. How am i supposed to -- - Loser! - You seemed to like it at the time. Just do it. Do not fool yourself. I would never -- G-Guys whoa, guys. Let's not fight. Especially not on my birthday. Oh, my god! It's your birthday? No one told us. - Happy birthday, dave. - Thank you. Happy birthday. Marissa, you're being very brave. - You think so? - Yes. Oh, good. There's no need to look so worried. We're gonna take good care of you. Thank you. Why don't we, um... Why don't we stretch our legs, huh? Take a -- Take a little walk. - Okay. - Relax. Nice, deep breaths. You do not want to go in there.</i> Yeah? Yeah. Feeling a bit better? - And this is you? - Yeah. - Good. Strap in. - Okay. Everything is gonna be just fine. Okay. Maybe not. I found haldeman's laptop. You know what? He has a hidden compartment right up under his desk. It's actually it's pretty cool. It's right up under Hardison! Okay, um, i accessed his e-Mails. A few hours ago, He made a stop payment on a fund transfer... To dan erlick. Erlick? The guy we just took out? The guy eliot just took out? And that's not all. I ran some back trace on a few phone calls haldeman made. Any guesses to who? How about someone in the caymans? Bingo. Erlick's his head of security. No reason why haldeman should be talking to these guys directly. Unless... marissa devins is not the only one on that hit list. Haldeman is gonna take out both of them.</i> Getting rid of the evidence And the guy in charge of covering it up.</i> Erlick's a pro. He had a ceramic knife. If anything was going down, He'd sniff 'em out when he saw them coming. How would they do it? Easiest way -- Take 'em out in transit. You mean bring down the plane they're on? You mean bring down the plane we're on?</i> Yeah. I'm usa air marshal. I need you guys to return to your seat, please. Immidintly thank you. There's no way. There's no way haldeman would go this far. Billions of dollars, decades of jail time. Look, if you're right about this, We got to get this plane on the ground right now. - We have to tell the pilots. - No, no, no, no. N-Not now, no. We have to understand what we're dealing with here. How would you get a bomb on the plane? Cargo hold, Post-Screening in erlick's bag or the accountant's luggage. Okay, parker, i -- Parker, i need you -- All right, we got to talk to erlick now. Geez! Hey! When i knock people out, they tend to stay knocked out. Luggage tags. What are you doing? Medical emergency. Passenger left their asthma inhaler in a checked bag. ??????? I don't understand. Why do you need to know what kind of bag i have? Are you sure? It's red with white flowers. I'm looking right at it. There's nothing in it. Same as erlick's. Hey, parker. You got your phone on you? Yeah. Why? Okay, now, is there anything that looks like a computer interface, Hooked up to the plane's electrical system? Yeah, i think so. Okay, good, good. Now i need you to find the usb port on the control panel And connect the phone to it using an a.V. Adapter. Where am i supposed to find an adapter? Look around. ????? What are you doing? Well, i'm just remote-Accessing a plane's electrical system from 3,000 miles away. You know what -- If you were a geek, You would be really turned on right now. I'm just saying. - Huh? - "Huh" what? O-Okay. I'm reading an electrical spike. Parker, do you see anything around That could be interfering with the signal? There's something. Looks like it's tapping into one of the conduits. Where are you exactly? Radio air-Traffic control. Let 'em know we're on schedule. Might get in early if this tailwind keeps up. Parker, the device you found -- Is it anywhere near an orange box? Yeah. Oh, god. They tapped into the black box. No, no, it's not black. It's orange. Yeah, the black boxes -- They're orange. Makes them easier to find in the debris. They've hacked into the flight's computer, Which means they have access to the system Which means they can spoof the black-Box data all at the same time. Crash the plane without anyone knowing it was sabotaged. Exactly. Guys... - Gentlemen -- - What are you doing?! This area's off-Limits! Listen to me! I'm a u.S. Air marshal, okay? This is tom baker. He's an engineer. He's a consultant for the tsa. Autopilot's disengaged itself! We're losing altitude! Listen -- Someone has hacked into the navigation system. They're trying to bring the plane down. Hardison, we need you! I don't-I-I don't know, nate. I don't -- I mean, i-I can override the software attack, But that means we would have to restart The flight's electrical system, which i have no idea how to do, Because my knowledge of aeronautical engineering is kind of limited to What i can pull off of google in the next two minutes. And, brother, i don't -- I mean -- Listen to me! You can do this! I trust you! No matter how many times you goof off or screw up, You always come through in the clutch. You're the only guy i can count on in a situation like this. You know what?¡Ìyou... You're right. You're right. I got this. Yes! Yes! Yes, you can! You're right. You're -- I'm the man. I'm the man. I got this. I'm gonna do this. Then do it already! Okay, um... parker, parker... Can you sever all the wires between the device and the black box? I think so. Yoke's nonresponsive. It's like stirring cement. - We need to reset now. - Not yet! No! Not yet! Not yet! On my mark. Okay. ???? ?????? 10,000 feet and dropping fast. Parker,as soon as the code stops cycling, Sever the last wire. 9,000. 8,000. Parker, my code is in the flight computer. Pull the clip! ?? Nate, reset... Now! Okay, now! Flight computer's clean. ????? 5,000 feet. 4,000. 3,500! Dive's too steep. We're gonna have to set down. Find me a runway. Right there! Sophie? - Yes? - You okay? Yeah. You? Ask me again in 10 minutes. You're gonna remember this one, aren't you? Yeah. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on. Baby! Unh! "A" to the geek! Smooth! Too smooth! Lord, i was so scared, i wanted to cry, call my mama. Y'all cool? - Yes,cool. - Family. All right. Hey, i want marissa off the plane now.</i> Hardison, your guy's about to find out the smoking gun isn't dead. Get out of there. I have the attitude problem?</i> No, brother, no, you got the attitude problem, okay?</i> I gave my heart and my soul to this damn company,</i> And this is how you repay me?</i> And on my birthday! He was always so thoughtful. I never liked that guy. You guys almost died trying to help me. I wish i could help you,</i> But all the evidence was in my office, And haldeman took it all. He didn't take it all. You promised me this would be taken care of! Adi,my brothers. I wish there was some way i could pay you back For everything you've done. Well, there is something you could do.</i> Testify. Genogrow c.E.O. Allen haldeman Was indicted on conspiracy and attempted-Murder charges today,</i> After a grand jury heard testimony from an inside source.</i> Man, i love it when a plan comes together. What? I said i was sorry. Hey, look, it all worked out okay. I mean, i was 3,000 miles away</i> And still managed to save all y'all lives. You're welcome! Ungrateful... Well, it took 10 years, But we got our first crash landing. 10 years. Thanks for getting it right this time. You were right. 10 years ago, i saw you the first time. You were swiping a degas from a collection in prague. I saw you. You saw me. I ran. You chased. Then, two years later, I caught up with you in damascus. Caught you, i should say.</i> You turned around... introduced yourself. And that's when i met sophie devereaux.</i> It'll be eight years next month. Well played. Thank you. I still don't understand how you can mix up paris and tuscany.
