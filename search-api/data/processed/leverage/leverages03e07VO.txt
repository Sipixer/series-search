experiment... - What's the last one? - Conclusion. Ms. Salazar, I'm here on behalf of the internal revenue service - to collect on your delinquent taxes. - I don't understand. I'm on a payment plan. I just spoke with my account manager last week. You didn't get the notice? That agreement has been canceled. That agreement has been canceled. - What? Mom? - Go to your room, Lydia. We'll put a lien on your house. We have the right to do that. I-s that what you want? What? No! I told you, I am paying it. What do you want from me? Give me a credit card. I'll make this all go away. Or I come back with the sheriff, and we lock you out. Tonight. Your choice. Here. When I contacted the IRS, they said they never received the money. But someone maxed out my credit card. If it wasn't the IRS, then who? Probably the same people who have been, targeting taxpayers all over Boston. - You're not alone, Clara. - Well, it isn't just the money. This man humiliated me. He scared my daughter. We're gonna find out who did this, and get your money back. I promise. Mr. Ford, I play by the rules. After I got laid off, I was paying off my debt a little at a time, and I could still put food on the table every night. What do I tell my daughter now? You tell her the same thing you tell her every day. Don't give up. The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys. We provide leverage! Look, all I'm saying is, is I don't understand why we can't have a couple of days off in between jobs. We just spent 10 days in Juarez. What's the matter? You don't like the pinatas? No time off, all right? We got a lot of work to do. Hardison, run it. The first rule of crime is follow the money. Ms. Salazar's money ran through 3 different shell companies before it ended up with this guy. Hugh Whitman. He runs a big debt collection agency right outside of Boston called financial support associates. It makes sense. He's got bill collectors already on his payroll. He just sends them after people that owe back taxes. He keeps the money. But the names of those people, they're not public. So how does he know who to target? Whitman worked for the IRS for 20 years. He probably had a friend leak him a list. I got it! I got it! We steal the list. We need a way in. What did you find out about Whitman on the Internet? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? He's not on the net. At all. Which is strange because his company deals with such high tech. They do this thing where they spoof your caller I. D to make it seem like your grandma calling, when it's really one - of their bill collectors. Sweet. - Go back to the money. You said Whitman routed money through three different shell companies, right? - Where is it now? - Somewhere in the boondocks at a bank called Turner Creek. It's under an account named "patriot limited." There's no ties to Whitman, and that's why the cops can't touch him. Good. We can work with that. I want a two-pronged attack. One team is gonna go convince Whitman his money isn't safe there at the bank. - Me and Hardison got the bank. - We're doing what, now? After you have spooked Whitman, Sophie, you go and hook him with a new place to stash his cash. Questions? I'll fix it. We can fix it. We'll fix it. It's okay. I don't know what you're complaining about. I got us the bank. We're in, we're out, and we get to go throw a worm in the water. All so you can go fishing in the woods. I don't see why I had to come. Because it'll be good for you. When's the last time you've been outdoors? Did you see that mosquito? That thing had a beak, man. What's that smell? It's fresh air. I don't like it. Who's in charge here? - How can I help you? - I'll tell you how you can help us. This is Agent Brody, I'm Agent Quint, with the criminal investigation unit of the IRS. what can I do for you? We need the records of all the accounts in the name of patriot limited. Of course. Right this way. I'll get them for you. Have a seat here. We don't get many folks way out here. Why don't you just have a seat and I'll bring that account right up? Mr. Whitman, my name is Colette Madison. We have some mutual friends over at the IRS. Go ahead TS MANQUANT With human resources. It's about your account at Turner Creek bank. I don't have an account at Turner Creek bank. No, but patriot limited does. And that's you. May I? Who are you? Think of me as a matchmaker. I bring together parties who can benefit each other. For a fee, of course. - I don't need your help. - Unfortunately, you do. I'm here to tell you that your money isn't safe at Turner Creek bank anymore. Not now. It's urgent. Good timing, Sophie. Now, Eliot and Hardison should be finishing up</i> - <i>at the bank right about now.</i> - Come on. - What? - Just got a call from one of our men at the bank. There are two agents from the IRS asking about your accounts. You call Chester. Tell him to get rid of them. They're there already, aren't they? How did you know? I told you. I have friends at the IRS. They're on to you, Mr. Whitman. If you know my former department at the IRS, then you probably know Charlie Dean. How is the old boy? Now, that must be Whitman's source inside the IRS. - we need Hardison. - No, we don't. I want you to tell him that the last time you saw Charles was at his funeral. Haven't you heard? I'm so sorry. It was a beautiful service. All right. You have my attention, Ms. Madison. If my bank isn't safe, what is? I want to introduce you to someone who runs an alternative financial institution. How'd you know that? Do you know when I'm gonna die? Do you? What? You think that was enough to spook Whitman? Don't know. Comms and mobiles don't work up here, we have to call Nate from a land line. Yeah, you can use the phone at the bait shop while I tackle us up. We'll grab something to eat. Come on! Look at me. I look like somebody eats at a bait shop? You fellas are gonna want to come with me. - Excuse you? - Make any sudden moves and my boys will blow your heads right off. 12. This van is old. I bet if we rush that door, - we could pop the lock. You ready? - Shut up. I'm trying to get us out of here. What are you doing? I'm drawing a map, Hardison. Mr. Whitman, welcome to your new bank. You're kidding me, right? Come with me. Come on, ladies! Let's kick it up a notch! That's right! Let's make this a party! Come on, girls. You've got cats at home that can pedal faster than that! That's it for me. I'm done. I've got to go. Yeah, is this the manager? All right, listen. This is Oscar, from corporate. We've spoken before. You know that new, ladies gym that's, down there on 14th street? Yeah, they're poaching your members over there at your place. They offering a free membership to anyone who breaks their contract with you. So what I need you to do right now is go down there and get the skinny on what's going on. Go! Go now! What's going on? Where'd everybody go? Hugh Whitman, Vic Pellington. He's the owner. Come on in. Have a seat. What do you think of our operation we got here? Well, it's a low-rent gym for housewives. - Doesn't look like a bank to me. - No, that's true. Yeah. One of them is... is nothing. But you get five of these places, - it's a money-laundering machine. - Vic owns 25 images franchises. He sells interests to discerning businessmen like yourself looking to hide the source of their income. That only works when you have customers to explain the cash flow. This place is empty. That's the beauty of the health-club industry, because 80% of the people, they pay the membership but they never come. Have a seat. We have all these names... Name after name of these members - that never come in in our databank. - Give Vic your money to wash and he just adds names to the membership roster. Your dirty money becomes clean profit. - So she gets a finder's fee? - She does. - What about you? - My rake is 15%. Yeah, but with that, what you get is you get detailed papers that show that you're an investor in images for over a year. You get board-meeting minutes. It's all on the up. - Okay, what's the catch? - The only catch is that I need an answer now, today, because... I got one slot left, okay, and you're not the only bidder. All right, I'm gonna want to look at what you think are detailed records. Yeah. Sure. I got... I'm very intimate with the tax code, Vic. I used to be district manager with the internal revenue service. That's cool. Internal revenue service. Taking money from hard-working Americans and shipping it straight to China. You smell that? Smell of death? Yes, I do. Look, that's not even real. Right? See, I make those up from a little... Turner Creek minutemen. Anti-government militia, huh? Anti-government freedom fighters. They say the war is coming, tax man, but it's already begun. What do you call a man who takes your property, enriches your adversaries, and deprives you of your liberty? Your enemy. Consider yourselves casualties of war. It ain't gonna happen, Bubba. - I got one standing and one kneeling. - Make it work. Hold up, man! Can I at least get a cigarette? - What? - Can I get a cigarette? As an enemy combatant, I'm entitled to one last cigarette according to Geneva convention article 89, paragraph 3, subsection K. Are we combatants or not? Give the man a cigarette. Those menthol lights? Come on, now. Go on. Take your time. It's over there, man. - For God's sake, Brandon! - For God's sake Brandon! Come on! Fire! - You see that? That's called a plan! - What plan, man? Smoke cigarettes and die? - This way! - Come on! Get those dogs! Get those dogs over here! Now! Yes, hello, Mr. Wallach? This is Alexandra from F.S.A. I'm calling about the outstanding balance you have with... Amherst... Amherst oncology center? It looks like we got disconnected. Delete. Delete. Parker, why aren't you in Whitman's office yet? 'Cause it's my first day at work. On my way now. What you mean, stop? Why we stop running? Listen to me. The van was averaging 45 miles an hour, right? We were in there for 22 minutes. We took two turns off the highway. That's 17 miles north of town. We need to go South. That's South. - Says you and what compass? - This compass, man! Some of us were born with good direction! How about some sense? That's uphill. Running downhill is faster. That's proven science. One, two, three. - Damn it! Again? - You got a tell, man. If I were a super-secret government document, where would I hide? Guys, I found the list, but that's not all I found. I found guns. Geez. Sorry, I... go ahead. I got to take this call. What?! Looks like he's stealing from the taxpayers to buy weapons.</i> And flags. Flags? What kind of flags? White with a green tree inside a blue shield</i> with a star and a ribbon around it. It says "<i>ense petit placidam, sub libertate quietem.</i>" "By the sword we seek peace, but only under liberty." That's from the Massachusetts state flag. The tree, that's from the original colonial flag. - So he's a historian. - With an arsenal. No wonder we can't find anything about this guy online. He's got a <i>little secret. I'm gonna try something.</i> I'm so sorry. The local council wants to up handicap ramps all over the parking lot. Next thing you know, we're gonna have to put braille in the, on the free weights. It's getting to be ridiculous, these people. Is that your yellow hummer over there ? - That it is. - Boy, that's a sweet ride, huh? - Well-made machine. - Yeah, a beauty. She's nice. I appreciate a man who buys American, I'll tell you that. Used to work for the government myself. I'm going back a few years, but, back then, we all believed in the same principles. It's true. It's true. Yeah, the system, it's broken down. - It certainly is. - Whatever happened to "by the people, for the people," huh? I spent 20 years with the IRS. You think after all that time and all that money I collected, any of it went to protect the interest of real Americans? No. We just hand it off to other agencies. They dole it out to welfare cheats and border jumpers and whatever black-hole programs keep the incumbents in office. Yeah, taxpayers these days... They're a bunch of sheep. Just blind followers who don't even realize their liberty is under constant assault by the government that they've elected. - It's pathetic. - Preaching to the choir. That money that, the IRS is looking for in that bank? I told you. It's not mine. It belongs to the revolution. And it's coming. That's why you got to act fast, Hugh. You've got those, those IRS agents snooping around. I wouldn't worry about them. I had them taken care of. I've got to get back to my office. Why don't you meet me there with your records, and I will try to give you an answer today. Pleasure to meet you. Parker, have you talked to Eliot or Hardison today? They could be out of range, or... Or in a lot of trouble. I don't like it, Nate. Eliot and Hardison should have checked in by now. - We should call the police. - Tell them what? Two of our friends are impersonating IRS agents at a bank? Whitman said, "I took care of them." Parker and I will find the boys. You go close Whitman. Wait. We've got to get them off our scent. - What's that? - Just rub it on you! It's skunkweed. It'll get the dogs off our scent! - Rub it on your damn body! - I can taste the smell in my mouth. It's strong. Put it on you, man! All right. High five. A high five for morale! - What the hell, man? - I know what I'm doing! Gangrene, man! Gangrene! You know what? We wouldn't even be in this mess if you ain't wanted to go fishing! I could have taken you down to mama's fish shack and got you a catfish, two pieces, and a biscuit for $5.99. But instead you got us out here with trigger-happy Joes trying to fish us! And he's all too happy to shoot himself a Negro! So it's a black thing now? Is that it? They're hunting me, too? Damn Skippy, it's a black thing! Who they try to shoot first, Eliot? Who got punched first, Eliot? - Me! I'm about tired of this redneck... - Damn it, Hardison! - Damn it, Eliot! - I know what I'm doing. - I've done this before. - This, right here? - In the woods, handcuffed to a man? - I have, okay? - It was easier last time, though. - Why? 'Cause he was already dead. Good boy. This way. What do you got? I've got a map... part of a map. I don't know what it means. What if Eliot and Hardison have already... Let's go in here. Hardison and Eliot, they need us to stay calm, show me what you got, and, we'll figure out how to save them. Guys! Eliot, Hardison! Can you hear me? Wait. Stop. Nate? You're breaking up, man! We're in the woods. We're approximately 17 miles from the bank. - Damn it. Can you hear him? - No, man. It's cloud cover. Day like this, we got to bounce our signal off a radio tower. How do we do that? Get a clear view of the sky. Okay. Here it is. That's Whitman's militia camp. It doesn't show where. Now, Eliot said they were 17 miles from the bank. Let's get... It's got to be in here somewhere. From the bank... to here. Right there. It's same creek, isn't it? Yeah, no paved roads. No people for miles. In the middle of nowhere. - <i>Nate? Can you hear me?</i> - Hardison? Are you okay? Can't talk very loud. These militia guys are following us, and they're armed and I'm pretty sure we pissed them off. Listen... now, there are railroad tracks a mile and a half west of the camp. Can you get there? Sure. But what if there's no train? There will be. We're gonna steal you one. Your records are very thorough. Very impressive. I do have some questions about the profit sharing, however. The nuts and bolts are really Vic's forte. Where is he? - I thought he was coming with you. - He's here. He's on a conference call. Money laundering... it isn't all champagne and helicopters, is it? Excuse me. Hate being away from the job. I love collecting money. Okay, Nate. I'm in. Let's go steal a...! What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna </i>call your station. You're gonna patch me through to the department of transportation. Now, use the company's caller-I.D. spoofing software</i> to make my call look like it's coming from Fitchburg.</i> Okay. You're on. Massdot, this is Bev. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm walking my dogs out here in Fitchburg. It like you got a problem on your track. A bunch of rocks blocking the way. Are you sure? I haven't heard anything about a rockslide. Yeah, am I sure? Listen, I'm sending you a picture on my celly right now. Yes, sir. We'll do our best. - <i>It's a big problem.</i> - We'll try to... Please hold, sir. - Massdot, this is Bev. - Is this the train department? You got to send someone out to Fitchburg. Please hold, ma'am. We got rocks! Rocks on the tracks! Yeah. Big rocks! Hey, Gary, I got to re-route the northbound Barrington. We got a rockslide. Eliot, Hardison, a train on the way. It's coming from Pennsylvania. It's a produce train carrying beets. I'll take that as a good sign. Like I said, I still have a few questions. But we do see the world the same way. And that counts for something. God! Come on, man! I hate beets. Let's go! Come on! So? Do we have a deal? You will have a check by the end of business day. To the revolution. All right, Sophie. Good work. The train is on its way to pick up the boys.</i> We're home free. He did it, man! He actually did it! He stole it! How's your train-jumping skills? I ain't no hobo, but I can hold my own. All right. Don't move! Put your hands up! Man, what do you want us to do? You're the ones that put this on us. - All right, go down. - Why you always twist it. - Not like that! - Re-phrase that! Go under. Why you always telling me to go down, Eliot? I'm not saying it like that! - Just hold on a minute! - Shut up! - Can we get a minute? - The man has a gun. - Go under. Go! - Twist it this way. Geez! - Look, man... - it ain't that hard. - It's not that hard. - He's so difficult. Shut up! Let me tell you something... You're time's up! We get new recruits every day. You can't stop what we have planned. No one can. Come on, man. Let's go. All right. Wait. We got to get on this train. No. What'd you smell in that camp? - What? I don't... - What were you smelling at the camp? - We got to get on this train right now! - What were you smelling? Fertilizer. And molasses. You can reduce the molasses down and use it as an oil for a fertilizer bomb? I've seen it in Lebanon. It's better than kerosene. So a fertilizer bomb and a van. That's what the little hillbilly was crying about. We get on this train? We get back there, we call the FBI. They clear everybody out. Was the bomb mixed already? Is it stable? They got to use it within the next 48 hours. We call the FBI. Maybe they make it, maybe they don't. What happens then? We're watching a building blow up on the news, children, firemen scattered everywhere? I say we go back down there, and we stop them. I say we whup some hillbilly ass. We're gonna get bloody on this one. All right. Come on, man. I'm gonna grab his walkie-talkie. You get his shoelaces, and you get his belt. I'm getting this. What do you say we lose about 180 pounds? How's the new girl doing? Nate, we've lost contact with Eliot and Hardison again. They're probably on the train. All right, but what about Sophie? When's she getting Whitman's check? Get me Whitman. Excuse me. Sir, we have a problem. I see. No, I'll take care of things on this end. I have to get to the bank and get my money. There's no telling what those idiots out there are liable to do. Our cover's blown. The revolution's starting early. Our cover's blown. The revolution's starting early.</i> They're locking the building down. I'm gonna try and stall Owens. If I can make the elevator think there's a fire, the doors won't open. All right. Good. I'll find us a way out. If Whitman is spooked, he's gonna go for his money.</i> So we have to get to the bank before he does. Eliot, Hardison, can you hear me? Where are you on the train?</i> Yeah, Nate, that didn't happen. What do you mean it didn't happen? What... you're not on the train? Don't worry about it. You're telling me you're gonna go toe- to-toe with these people without a plan?</i> We got a plan. It's called C.W.A. Can of whup ass. Take the stairwell to the first floor. There are too many eyes in the lobby. - We're using the emergency exit. - On my way. Come on! Nate, it worked. The elevators are on automatic emergency protocol. They're all headed to the ground floor. What the hell? - Did you get them? - I'm on it, sir. Get it done. I'm holding you personally responsible. How are we gonna get out without being seen? - We can't hack the security system. - I think of something more direct. Go! Stop them! Stop them! God! - You feeling confident? - Not really. Good. 'Cause overconfidence will kill you faster than a bullet any day. - Fear's good. - I have fear. And doubt. And really serious regrets. I should be fine. All right. Get ready, then. Science. It works. Don't make any sudden movement. Move. I need to make a withdrawal. Right now. Mr. Whitman. Yes, of course. Take a seat. Good work, Tommy. Where you gonna put the van, Chester? An office building? A preschool? A church? A soldier knows there are casualties in every war. See, that's the difference between a real soldier and this little Halloween outfit you got going on. You'd kill to protect your rights. A real soldier? He'd die protecting somebody else's. - Yeah, come on. - Wait. I never did get that cigarette. Kill them. I tell you, man. I think I know where your cigarette's at. - I think I saw it right over there. - Right there? Whitman's gone. You all right? High five. For morale. Yo, incoming. Go! Chester! Chester, what the hell happened here? What the hell's going on? Never mind. Never mind. There's too much heat on the organization right now. I have to get out of town. I want you take them to a safe house. Give me the keys to your truck. Come on! Hurry up! Next time I steal you a train, get on it. You're not gonna rain on my parade today, Nate. I made a bomb. Out of a menthol light. It's over there, man. For God's sake, Brandon! You got a radio? - What frequency are they on? - Seven seven two. I will be in touch with further instructions when it's safer. - All right? - <i>All units move in.</i> - What's that? - <i>We have a GPS location of the camp.</i> ATF airborne is incoming. ATF? That's the feds. - The feds are coming! - Be advised. We have a cooperating witness on the site. Apprehend, but do not injure Hugh Whitman. What? - Guys, hold it. Wait a minute. - I should have known... Once a government man, always a government man. Wait, I gave you training. I gave you equipment. I handle the money. Let's see the money. Here. There! Wait a minute. This was straight from the bank. Who knew a Sedan could hit 140? Parker, you are never to get behind the wheel of a car again, okay? Never. Wait... Hey, guys, I'm a fellow patriot! The evidence you were gonna sell to the feds for your freedom? What? Chester, think! This only hangs me! We're being played. We're being set up. - The money must be back at the bank. - You ain't lying about one thing. We need to hide out. So let's go into town and get our money, Whitman. And maybe we don't shoot you. Move it. All right! Move it! Give me the keys! Hey, you know, I'm starting to enjoy the outdoors. Hey, are you seriously gonna let them get away with this? Eliot, I stole you a train. Have a little faith. - What's going on, Whitman? - I don't know. They were just in here. Hello? Hello? Hands in the air. Don't move. FBI! Let me see your hands! Get 'em up! Get down! Get on the ground! That's not my case. It got switched. Are these the stolen papers you mentioned? You! Internal IRS documents. Mr. Whitman, you and your men are under arrest. Wait a minute! You got to listen to me! That woman isn't who she says she is! She's a con artist! We get that all the time. It's all one big conspiracy. Yeah, you better run a psych eval on that one? I'm trying to tell you. And that guy! He's part of it, too! I'm telling you! Why don't you listen to me?! Listen! Mr. Ford, I don't know what to say. Thank you. All of you. I know you've been out of work for a little while. Do you think you could help us find the names on this list and help them get their, uh, their money back? It's only a part-time job, but I think you'll find it really rewarding. I'll drive. No. No, no, no. I'll drive. Reel it in slow. I know how to do it, man. I heard you. - See, you lost it. - There's no talking in... That was the beauty of fishing! You're tense. It's a delicate sport. You need to be delicate. You got it! It's just not the same.
