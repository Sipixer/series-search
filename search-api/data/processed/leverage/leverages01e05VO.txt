I have enough experience to know it is never as easy as it sounds. Then pose your ass the ground! We can not let the local cops manage the situation. We must take control. We must be the police. How it happened for you, Judge? Beautiful car. This is annoying. It is not a bank braque without an exit strategy. These two deserve getting caught. 42 seconds. What? Pointing to the bank. A guard who has never used his gun before, 2 cameras outside, 1 inside, 1 and 50 years of safe, the combination of which is the date of birth of the wife of the manager. Entry, exit, 42 seconds.

On returning from a small territorial skirmish. A patrol was attacked by xmagnun. Xmagnun of? I thought it was an urban legend. You are nice ... - It was what, Sheriff? - It is not really inside, therefore it is unclear the number of robbers, or hostages, and what they want. And your intervention?

I should be able ... override the timer. I can try if you want. What will they do? Good question. I have never seen robbers try inflate their booty once surrounded the bank. In general, they seek a way out. This would help ... You listen? This would help, this would be news on these people, Learn how to negotiate with them, here and now. It is already over. I hacked the security system. I can see the robber. I look in the basis for identifying facial linked to the NSA and the FBI. If these types are known, sooner rather quickly. It was fast. These guys should be sought. Mistake. The oldest is a soldier. Derrick Clark. Officer in the Navy for 20 years. Retired recently. It does not ... It does not make any sense. Why this type braquerait it a bank? I go to his accounts. Derrick emptied all accounts this morning, he distributors ceiling until withdrawal - his credit cards. - Who withdrew </ i> all his money in the bank, and returned to fly? You say? What?

Yes, exactly what I suggest. </ i> But we'll do that without our grill cover. Who are you talking about? I may be blunt, Nate, but your income is 2 steps from "Boss Hogg" in a bank surrounded by cops. It is not easy. But not impossible, if has the best thief in the world. Parker, you have already pointed a bank robbery in progress? There is a 1st time at all. The bank was built before 1980, before computers. So the door of filing greater.

There are a lot of money. Yes, I know. The life of my wife is of land where the money goes. I understand. Sometimes the bad guys are only kind that remains. Listen, you have filled in a dirty mess. Let me help you? Judge, I think they're serious saying not to speak. So we should remain sat without speaking. Do what they want. It's better like that. Listen to me. You want the money? I.

You are in cahoots. It has nothing to do with them. I have everything. You four, you conspired against me. This setting is not real? It's just a scam to take my money! And it is a good plan. If this old Carl disappeared with the money you knew that I would have continued and even hunted. But if money is stolen during a robbery, - You could have you learned. - Wrong. They just try to help us. My wife has been removed. The money is for ransom. A ransom? Really? Did you not find anything better? You must be an idiot to believe such a story! - It tells you the truth. - Shut up! Fasten it all! Drop your weapon or I get all four. Please. He must go to the hospital. This is not about to happen. Nobody leaves here ... before I get my money. Where's my damn suitcase? Not here. That, I can see it. No, I mean not in the building. Come on.

It landed not in my city - From thinking with my money. - A man was injured. - We must let him go. - I said, nobody out. - He's bleeding. - Shut up! Everyone! Shut up! I try to think. If you are out the case of the bank, you have an accomplice outside. You tell him how? And I jumped from the roof with a parachute on the hood of an armored and neutralized the guards. The robbers. Yes, that's what I said. The shooting was accidental. There were no injuries, but one of the hostages was a scratch. They relax when they have what they want. Where are those damned pizza, elsewhere? It is not good. You have your guy when I have my money It's really not good. Back. - This is what I think? - I'm afraid. Nate is looking bad way. Should we <i> retrieves the briefcase. </ i> I'm working. Sophie is how? The ball went through. It did not hit the artery. At least that. It could have been worse. Worse than me shoot and reveal who we are? You're not going to stick responsible. It would not be there, if t'étais out with the money. - I can handle. - I know. And take care of myself. I do from a lease, well before you meet. - You understand. - Yes, I understood. What's the plan? The plan? Where I have a hole 3 cm in the shoulder? The plan? I swung a long time ago. No matter now. - We can communicate. - Yes, it is deaf. - Hardison, Parker, and Eliot ... - They are all alone. We did not request it. This rogue is not full of surprises? Where are you going, old owl? Where do you ... What stinks and shouts a girl? Good answer. Stay in the car. Who are you? That must be the cavalry. Ready? A few more minutes. Hurry up. The pizzas are there. Let the ambulance take him. We remain on. And abandon my advantage? Listen. Everything will be fine for her. Everything will be fine. Your accomplices ... they are good? The best. Everything is my fault. I never had attend these types. Finally, if something ... Mom arrives ... Dad, I'm ... really sorry. I'm the FBI agent Leonard. Here pizza requested. Nothing was ordered. Be addressed, Judge. My old, just open the door. Come on. I think you expect that. We can give you something else? Anything that would help to unblock the situation? Wait. I am not ... Sir, you were given what you want. If you let the hostages go, - We can talk about that. - You will not understand. - It is these four ... - Look at me. I understand. This seems a situation - Without hope. - What are you doing? But nobody else may be injured. You're one of them, right? - Now! - Here we go! - Drop the gun, your honor. - Bill is not what you think. Sir, gently drop the weapon. No. You are wrong! I'm the hero! What you doing? You work for me! If you need money Roy, you could ask for a loan. I did not need a loan, I have lots of money, but ... The pizza? - Where is the box of pizza? - You understand what he says? Because it makes no sense. It's my money! They have my money back! - Damn, what are you talking about? - It was in my suitcase! This case? Crystal? What have you filled, Roy? It is not for me. Everything makes sense now. That would explain the behavior irrational, nervousness, and ... irritability. Shut up. You're not even the FBI. Paranoid hallucinations, outbreaks of violence. Listen to me. It is one of them. It is complicit. Complice what? With whom? With it! And these two, there! These two people. Stand back, please. Ready? Parés! It is not too early. Undress yourself. Hurry! - Michael. - Mom! It is comforting, but it can not wait for my infusion of morphine? Sorry. It happened like that. He became furious madman, as if he was missing. He waved his gun. You've seen "Dog Day Afternoon"? Well write it all. Carl thought it could return to reason, but the judge kept Roy not to tell him to shut up. He was trying to be the hero, but Roy did not see it that way. He was shot once it was lifted. Coldly. That's ridiculous. This was not even there! Fred. Come. Tell them the truth. First, is Frank. And it happened exactly as they said. They lie. They all lie. If you do not believe me, look at the records. Good idea. Good service, Roy. It was all on tape. He made it, idiot. We must take him to the hospital. Not so <i> I would not have my money. </ i> A doctor would not been a bad idea. Come on, Bill. - You know me. - Yes, I know you. That's the problem. Bill, listen to me. These people are trying to trap me. - They had this plan from the beginning. - You're really a geek. The power of geeks, baby. Courage! It was very courageous, enter here, like that, disarmed. Tell me, all the guys FBI of balls as big? Take care of yourself, another team arrives to the report. Come on, guys, we move. Let's go. Here we go! The FBI is there to do the report. - Got an idea of what ... - Do with. Members of the FBI, can you help me? Look at this. Our two local dealers sought. It's incredible. Damn, it is good! Thank you, Parker. Forget it. It was an excellent performance. I think I played well When I shouted after people. This is a good start. It must make money the family Delgado. Keep quiet.
