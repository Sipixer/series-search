Eat paint, ladies. Get off! Warren, you are such a loser! Push off! Is that supposed to be frightening? Transcript: evarin - Synchro: MNk - You're late. - Yeah. Hey-hey! - Are you all right? - I got you a coffee. That's lovely of you. I'm sorry, Caroline, but I can't stay. Oh, that's a pity. Work again? You must be the busiest student I've ever met. It's crazy right now. I have to do this presentation... about zoology. It's really boring stuff. I'm sorry. Connor. Come here. Come here. Try me. I'm interested in animals. Yeah? I really wanna stay. I have to run. I'm sorry, Caroline. I am. You're sweet. Am I? Thanks for the coffee. It's really... quite hot. I'll text you. - I burned my tongue. - Get in the car. How's your boyfriend? Fiance. Fine, thanks. Just waiting for Connor. Be here in a minute. Sorry. Would you put me in the driving seat? Meet the Anomaly Detection Device or ADD for short. Probably not the best acronym. Breathe. Sorry. This is a fully integrated graphic representation of the radio communications matrix, networking the UK's transmitters. Congratulations. Your very own Sat Nav. I believe you can get them dashboard size nowadays. This watches over the UK 24, so... - What is that? - That is just a demo. When a real anomaly appears it can alert us within seconds. - Good one. - Thank you very much. Here's one I made earlier. It's a palm-held detector. It's a short wave radio receiver with a range of 100 metres. I was hoping for something more compact. It's a prototype. We can work on it. Tried beaming up with it yet? Are you here to help? This is a serious piece of kit - when I iron out the kinks. Technical question. - Is the detector online now? - It is. So it should pick up every new anomaly? - Yeah. - So... Why have I just been told we have a new creature attack? I've seen enough, Abby. Zip up the boy. Claw marks everywhere. He's been ripped to shreds. If I was at the zoo I'd say it was a lion. - The bones were gnawed. - Alright. Big cat, then. No radio interference. No magnetic field. No sign of an anomaly. You know, I checked. I doublechecked every chip and circuit board. It's working. If there was an anomaly, it'd have shown up. - Stake my life on it. - May have to. Maybe he has a point. Perhaps there is another explanation. We get 1,000s of sightings each year, - pumas, leopards, lynxes. - Yeah. None big enough to do this damage. From a private zoo? Find out if anything's been reported. - Everything OK? - Yeah, yeah. - If it is just an ordinary big cat. - Yes? If it's a normal explanation, the ADD would be off the hook, right? Maybe. Valerie Irwin, did you find the body? No. I'm Deputy Park Manager. - No, a guest. He called the police. - Who did you tell? My managing director Peter Campbell. No press? No friends? Keep it that way. This is all under wraps for now. Are you the police? Do you know where the man who found him is? I put him in a hospitality suite. - He's shocked. - I'm sure. Whenever you're ready. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was? I didn't. After you. Are you insane? This is peak season. Do you have any idea how much money we're talking about? I'm Peter. Hope you're having a great holiday. A big cat just mauled one of your guests to death. Are you sure? - Did you see it? - Not yet. This conversation isn't over. Hi, I'm Peter. Keep smiling. - You have to evacuate this place. - He's right. When I want your opinion I'll ask for it. What if I close and nothing happens? It'll cost millions in compensation. We don't want to create panic. How about we shut the paintballing area, keep the rest open? How's that sound? I can live with that. Keep smiling. If you say "big cat" out loud again, I'll sue you. - I want to kill him. - Evacuate and we have media meltdown. How do I keep a lid on that? What if the press find an anomaly here? This animal will kill again. It's inevitable. Perhaps, but running that risk is the lesser of two evils. If we keep this open, people will die. It's your job to see they don't, mine's to protect the integrity of this op. At any cost? Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the noise will keep the predator away. You have to spoil everything, don't you? - I saw that. Come on. - That's not fair. She was doing it as well. These people shouldn't be here. - Cutter. - Stephen. I've a trail on a farm west of the paintball area.</i> I'm there. Abby, let's go. Connor, if you see anything suspicious, call me. What do I do if I do see something? Talk it to death? Here are the keys to the gun cases. Only as a last resort. Got it? Loud and clear. Stephen, did you see anything? Fresh tracks. It's doubled back on us. Back towards the park? Looks that way. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Cutter? - Connor. There's a creature here. I'm going after it. Out of the way. Please get out of the way. Out of the way. Get out of the park. Move! Move. Move. Quickly. Move out of the way. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Don't shoot. You. You, you shot me! You shot me. Look! Look at that. - You all right? - Do I look all right? You shot me! I'm calling the police. I could have been killed. Won't do you any good. I've spoken to them. They won't be taking action. What do I tell everyone? How about a silly stunt that went wrong? You must let us pay for a new costume. If you'll excuse me I have a train to catch. I have to be at head office to explain why our guests were shot at. It was an accident. Guys! - It's Jenny. - What? The farm Stephen saw belongs to Michael West. Get this. He used to import exotic animals. Lost his licence three years ago for illegally bringing in lion cubs. Tell her I'm on my way. He's on his way. - She said she'll meet you there. - Why is she coming? Doesn't trust you with the public. Why is that funny? What do you want? I'm from The James Lester Animal Foundation. You've probably heard of us. No. Never mind. We had a bit of bad luck, had to have a lion put down. - I heard you could help us replace it. - I'm not in that game. You're not feeding chickens with all that meat. - What's in the barn? - Leave now. Not till you show me what's in the barn. - I'm warning you. - Mr West. Jenny Lewis. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry about my colleague. I said it was a dirty trick. - Trick? - Trying to catch you out. We're from the Ministry. We had a report you might have gone back into animal importing. That's rubbish. So it won't bother you showing us what's in the barn. It's dogs. That's all. I love dogs. Couldn't have a quick peek, eh? You'd better stay back. Unbelievable. I'm breeding them for pets. - Pets? - Guard dogs. Thank you, Mr West. Sorry to have bothered you. You're a flirt. What? - You were flirting with him. - I was just being friendly. - Your way wasn't exactly working. - I don't have the eyelashes for it. Listen, you do the creatures, I'll do the people. Deal? - What are these? - Heat-sensitive cameras. The creature knows this territory well. It just made a kill here. It will come back. It's nocturnal. It's senses are sharper than ours. I shouldn't have to say this, but be careful. Any questions? - Can I have a gun? - Take a wild guess. - No? - Good guess. If you're worried, stay close to Abby. I was trying to protect people today. I think you'd have done exactly the same thing. Maybe without shooting the guy in the lion costume. The sun was in my eyes. I'm not talking about it again. Though you do look really hot through these. It's infrared, not X-ray. It's Valerie. I know who you are. What are you doing here? My van. The engine just cut out. I didn't know what to do. Where do you live? When you catch this animal what will you do to it? I don't know. - Kill it I suppose. - I hope not. Tell me something. Why the secrecy? No police. No press. - Why is this such a special case? - I can't talk about it. Sorry. Mystery man. That's me. Look, Valerie, I'd love to tell you more. There are things happening. Things we're trying to keep under control. Things you've done? I can't say anymore. Help me! Please! What was that? Oh, my God! Stay here. Oh, my God! Hello? Can I help you? Is anyone there?</i> - I told you to stay in the car. - Is it here? Go back to the car. Drive home. Please... don't leave me alone. Come on. - Can't you get it any clearer? - I'm working on it. You have no right to hold me or keep my photos. You want to help, right? A man was just killed. I know. I saw it. Unbelievable. That creature! No-one knows exactly what happened yet. Are you being serious? It's all in the photos. I'll be rich! The photos are classified. We'll need your SD card. This is a four gig ultra fast. How can I make your life better? - I'm sorry? - Kenny, isn't it? - Yeah. - I used to be a trainspotter. I come from a long line of them. Wonderful hobby. - It's more than just a hobby. - I understand. Every man has his passion. If you could just... help me out, I will get you VIP access to the train depot of your choice. You can do that? You'd be amazed at what I can do. I want to see the UFM1 Track Inspection Vehicle. Done. Thank you. You can go now. Thanks. You're a real piece of work! Thank you. I'll take that as a compliment. Guys, I think we might have a problem. It's a smilodon, better known as a sabre-toothed cat. Fast. Elegant. A real natural-born killer. Please tell me what's going on. I know you want to. Look, we're the good guys, Valerie. At least I think we are. Just go inside and get some sleep. If we lay a second trap there, we've got the whole area covered. Take Connor with you. - Got it fixed. - What? The van. It seems to be OK now. What are you doing here? Working out where to lay traps. We'll leave the place looking as good as new. - You should look by the railway. - It won't stay there. Too many people. Valerie. What's wrong? This shouldn't be happening. None of it. Let her go. She's been through quite a lot. Abby, whoa! Stop! Stop digging! Hey, come on! Come on! Come on! Savaged. - He's virtually cut in half. - How long's he been there? I don't know. A week, a month. If it's been there that long the anomaly formed before ADD started, which would mean nothing's wrong with it. One problem. The tiger didn't dig a trench and bury his body. Someone knows and has been protecting it. West. What? Jenny needed someone to pin an escaped lion story on. She said this man West fitted the bill. She wanted to create a cover story for the press. She left half an hour ago. Better stay here in case it comes back. Go. I'll be fine. I tell the police I had a lion here? I need someone to blame, and I'm afraid you're my only candidate. No. I won't be stitched up. I'm sorry. Did I make a mistake? You mean you're not breeding dogs to fight? Admit the lion's yours and I'll give you time to get rid of the dogs before I call the police. Deal? I'm sick of you people. Always harassing me, taking away my livelihood. Put the gun down. We both know you're not a violent man. I won't be pushed around anymore. - Mr West! - Get in! Give me the gun. Are you OK? I'm fine. Shot in, my best coat! The sabre tooth, - is it here? - Sabre tooth?! What are you on about? If he's acting, he deserves an oscar. He's no idea what we're on about. If he didn't bury the body, who did? Happy now? Oh, yeah! Valerie! It's all right. It's all right. I won't let them hurt you. Valerie? Hello? Valerie. Stephen, it's Valerie. She's hiding the sabre tooth. I'm at her house. We'd better find her fast. That's Valerie's car. - Where's she going? - Maybe she's letting it loose. Not if I can help it. Hold on. - Don't shoot me. - Where's Valerie. She said the clutch need fixing. You gave me a fright there. - Valerie, what are you doing? - What am I doing? What about you? Don't tell me you're not responsible for all this. - What? - You people... with all your mysteries and secrets! I knew who you were from the first minute. You created him in some horrible genetic experiment. He escaped and you've come to take him back. I won't let you. - That's not how it is. - Please don't lie to me. I'm not stupid. I'm gonna take him somewhere safe and tell everyone what you've done. And say you... you buried your boyfriend after your pet killed him? That was an accident. Dave got careless. He didn't know how to handle him. - And you do? - He trusts me. I'm the closest thing to a mother he's ever had. I went into my garage one day and he was just somehow magically there. A tiny cub. Frightened. Alone. Half dead. - I had to look after him. - I can understand that. You've done very well, Valerie, but you have to give him up now. So you can torture him? But you don't call it that. You call it research. No. That's not what's going on. Do you think I can't see how special he is? How unusual? You created him, and now you want to destroy him. I care about that animal, too, but he doesn't belong here and you can't help him. But I can. You don't care about him or you'd tell the truth. I'm telling you the truth. You have to trust me, Valerie. It's OK. It's OK. Come on. Help me. Please. It's too late. I'm sorry. I didn't want any of this to happen, but I can't abandon him now. No. If he kills me, - he's probably gonna kill you, too. - He'd never hurt me. Don't hurt him! Valerie, stay away. Stay away! You're safe with me. Safe. Valerie! It should never have happened. We could have saved her. I tried. How many more Valeries are there gonna be before we start telling people what's going on? You said something to her. Something that made her think we were to blame. No. I didn't say anything. But I wish I had. Sadly the creature died... while being taken back to the Ark. Heart attack. Probably induced by shock. What?! How's that possible? It was a perfectly healthy animal. Don't know. Maybe Abby... overestimated the tranquilliser dosage. Don't, don't, don't you dare! Abby knows exactly what she's doing. I mean... I want to do my own postmortem. Well, the creature's been destroyed. We have to be aware of the risk of disease. Sorry. Now if you forgive me I'm gonna go home. This whole experience has been totally exhausting for me. Right. That is it. This machine is officially double, triple-checked. - Demonstrations prove nothing. - It's not a demonstration. That's a real anomaly. Yes! It's working, it's actually working! What are we doing standing around here? A good point. I can't. I've a date with Caroline. Yeah? Is she pretty? Bummer. Your payment. I think you'll find it's all there. - It's not enough. - It's what we agreed. You havn't got that little creepy Connor trunk put his tongue in your mouth. Sometime you have to take one for the team. But it worth my sympathy. It's OK, I suppose. Stay close to him and find out anything you can.
