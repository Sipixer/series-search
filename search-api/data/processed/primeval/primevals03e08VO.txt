Was that really necessary? My car. My rules. I hate it when you pull rank. I hate sitting in the back. - You sat in front last time. - Who keeps count? Connor does. You lot! - Friendly round here. - You can't go in there! So where's this anomaly? The anomaly? It's in that garage. Seen anything unusual? No. You'd think someone would have noticed. He's in here somewhere. Right. Let's split up and find him. I'd evacuate the immediate area till we know what we're dealing with. Guys. It's here. - What is it? - Some kind of animal secretion. - Creature incursion. - What kind of creature? One that excretes goo. Right... It's reassuring. Let's find it. Be careful though. Nice. {\pos(112,170)}<i>La <font color="#FA1600">Prime Team</font> vous présente:</i> {\pos(202,230)} Saison 3 Épisode 8 Bon épisode ;) - I don't like insects. - It's all right now. No. I really, really don't like insects. Any idea? I'll have to do a full autopsy. I think it's some kind of ant. You know, in most fights with ants I'd fancy my chances, but this! This is a serious ant. Nothing like it in the fossil records. Whatever it is or was I don't want another one via the anomaly. I'm on it. Oi. What are you doing? That's my job. You're not the only one who can press a few buttons. I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that. Really? There you go. - Beginner's luck. - Maybe. But I didn't want to risk any more of those things. Listen, you don't have to feel bad. Me? Terrified of being trapped in a shopping centre with brain-eating zombies. Eek! Can you imagine? But that's unlikely to happen, isn't it, Connor? I'm trying to work with you, woman. Help me out. Seriously, you're fine. You're safe. Nothing's coming through there. Don't worry. Come on, guys. - Everything OK? - Fine. - Have you been in my bag? - I thought I heard your phone ring. It's my stuff. Keep out. Weird-looking phone. It's a satnav. - For work. - Right. So you can get from the penguins to the puffins without getting lost. Yeah. Something like that. Bluff Your Way in Mandarin! I'm going to a private reception with the Chinese ambassador. Cool. Can I be your plus one? I'll take that as a no. I wouldn't know what to eat without the numbers on the menu. Have you seen my invitation? It was here on the table. I said, "Have you seen my invitation?" It was just here. Maybe it's in your jacket. Nancy! Give me that. Give me that. I can't find my jacket now. - What's that noise? - What noise? A squeaking noise. Can't hear anything. Drop it. - What are you gonna do? - Twist. Seven. Come on. What's that? I'd better report this. See you later, Jack. What's happening at the zoo today? - The usual. - What's the usual? - You never talk about it. - Later. What? Don't look at me like that. It fell out... sort of. This is a conspiracy, isn't it? You two are in this together. Tell me what she's up to or I take it. Don't say I didn't give you a chance. - What do you think? - Fantastic. What is it? This is my calibrated laser refractor. - Come again? - It's a mechanical arm that rotates the artefact through every angle in the spectrum. And sooner or later the angles are aligned perfectly - and it'll reproduce the hologram. - OK, well... Let's get on with it then. OK. Cool. Is that it? That's it. It's actually quite boring. So it's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it will work. Then I'll finally be able to finish the work Carter started. I wonder what Abby's up to. I've got more to - Clear off. Go on. Right. The insect creature is derived from Hymenoptera, the same family as ants, bees, sawflies, and wasps. So this thing can sting? In this case the sting has evolved into an ovipositor. That's a relief. Isn't it? It uses it to lay eggs inside a host. Human beings would do very nicely. That's rank. - Nasty. - There was something else. I found very high levels of selenium in it. It's a chemical like sulphur. That's weird cos when I cleaned the artefact the dirt was registering high levels of selenium as well. You say that bug and artefact are from the same place. It's possible. Then the artefact is from the future? Which means that the future could be just the other side of the anomaly. You finish up here. Give Becker's men a call. Tell them we're on our way. Now I'm confused... - What are you doing on this phone? - You don't work at a zoo. You work in motor racing? You could have told me! I am your brother. - You stole my detector. - Serves you right for lying to me. What's that? Hold on. - Oh, my God! They're dead. - Dead? Who's dead? Jack, calm down. Tell me what's happening. There's no sign of him. He's gone through the anomaly. - I have to find him. - Abby, I'm sure he's OK. - What was he doing here? - I don't know. He stole my detector. It's your responsibility to keep that safe. What've you doing? He went in my bag. - This will take time to fix. - What happened? It's been run over by a car. We'll get him back, OK? I promise. - Stay here and get that fixed. - No. I'll stay with Abby. I can probably figure all of this out. The backup's on the truck. It needs resetting and synchronising. This isn't some school trip! We have to wait for backup. You wait if you want. - You all right? - Yeah. Don't step backwards. Where are we? The future. Our future? How many years away? I don't know. It's hard to say. Look at these cars. They could have been there for centuries. Or maybe not. Look, all we have to do is find the kid and get out of here. What's happened here? Where is everyone? Concentrate on the job. He can't have gone far. Unless he spooked. He'll be somewhere nearby. He's not an idiot. Well... Look. There. The car! Up there. Come on, guys. Well done! You've just alerted every predator for miles. I didn't have much choice, did I, Abigail? - What are you talking about? - Predators. They're... We don't know how they evolved or when, but... they're intelligent, quick, and really mean. It's a case of we kill them or they kill us. Why are we whispering? They locate their prey using echolocation. - They see sound. - Great. If those things got loose, humanity never stood a chance. That's it! We go back. We need backup. He could be injured. We can't leave him here with those creatures. It's her brother. We stay. You're supposed to make the tough decisions, Danny. I just did. And you, you calm down. - You await my signal. - OK. You do know he's almost certainly dead, don't you? She needs to find out herself. In her shoes I'd feel exactly the same way. Let's do this. Right. - And that was a baby, right? - Yeah. This is insanity. Let me see. Sorry. I don't think it's too deep. Where's Abby? Quick. Get in! Let me tell you this one more time. Getting ourselves killed will not help your brother! We need a fully armed search and rescue unit. Having more firepower gives a better chance of saving Jack. Fact. Danny's right. - You, too? - I'm just trying to be sensible. You've always hated him, haven't you? You'd be happy if he was dead. Hey! You! Go. Next time don't leave it so long. Help! Help. Somebody, help! Help! - I didn't ask for your help. - Well, you've got it. He's the only family I've got. I have to help him. Listen, I'll make you a deal. We go to the car. If Jack's there, great. If not, we go back, get support and start again. I will not give up on him, I promise. OK. Is Jack in the car? No. Help! Help! - Listen. - Help! Help! Yes! It's Jack. I'm down here. Is anyone there? Jack, you have to keep quiet. You've got to get me out of here. There's disgusting things. What are they? Horrible and slimey. - They sting. - He's OK. Guys. I'm going to go down. You stay with them. OK. Thank you. Who are you? You've got to get me out of here. - I need you to stay calm. - How am I supposed to stay calm? - Get over here. - I can't. My leg's trapped. - It stinks of paraffin. - Who cares what it smells like? What is that? It's a kind of maggot. Let me see that leg. We're gonna do this together. Count of three. Yeah? Yeah. One, two, three. Jack's down there. We have to climb. All right? What's happening to me? - Just shut up and climb. - I don't think I can. - It's my arm. - What? I think I've broken it. My ribs hurt. Connor, we're gonna need a rope. OK. This is gonna hurt. I suggest, if you wanna live, you keep quiet, all right? OK. Take him up. Becker. - I can't hold it. - Take the gun. Connor, get him out of here. Guys. Get him up here. Whatever happens just get them out of here. Good luck. - What's going on? - Come on! - Don't leave me here. - Just hang tight. You coward! Have you got him? - Abby! - Come on! Get him out of here. There's something coming up. - Run! - What is it? Trust me, you don't want to know. Go! Go! Come on. Let's go! Come on! Come here! Get in. Be quiet. Especially you. That should do it. I hope. Genius, Sarah. Becker? He tried to save us. Are you OK? I'm in agony. If you'd told me the truth, I wouldn't be here. Where are we? How come it took you so long to get here? I was terrified. Becker sacrificed himself to save you, and that's all you can say? - Keep that kid away from me. - Who's Becker? The man who took on a pack of killers to save you. - So? - So?! So what? He's dead, and it's your fault! You stupid, selfish - I thought you were dead. Come here. Sorry. I'm sorry. Can we go home? That might be the tricky part. Get down. Get down. Here are our options. We try and make a run for it, and they tear us to bits. We hold out here as long as we can. And they tear us to bits. I never said they were good options. This is it. - What's going on? - It's the fire. It's smoking them out. That'll keep them busy. We've got a chance. We're gonna go now. OK, go! Don't stop till you get to the anomaly. Whatever happens don't stop. Danny! Move! Go! Oh, no! Sarah must have closed it. Becker! Go! Go! Lock it now! Are you all right? Does that hurt? Abby, what just happened? If I told you Becker would have to kill you. He's already looking for an excuse. Maybe one day, just not now. That's the last time I do work experience with you. Don't ever frighten me like that again. I think it's time I moved out. - Are you sure? - Living with you is dangerous. Good decision. There's something I need to tell you about Connor. Private. Why are you staring at me? Jack told me what you did. Whatever it is there's a reasonable explanation for it. He told me about gambling Rex and you getting him back. You could have made Jack look really bad, but you didn't. Why not? I knew how much you loved him. I didn't want you to be hurt. Sorry. Even after I said those horrible and unfair things about you hating him, you still kept quiet You did all that for me. Abby, I - I want... I mean... I feel that we... I want to - Connor. Shut up. Yes, sir. I'll tell him. Let's get out of here. It's definitely Captain Wilder. You didn't recognise the girl? No. - No other signs of humanity? - No. I think we can be fairly confident Christine Johnson's involved. Fairly. And? There was an anomaly alert a few months ago at her headquarters. She said it was nothing. False alarm. You think she has access to an anomaly? And a cloaking device, which is why we don't pick it up. - What is she up to? - I don't know. But I'll find out. No, no. I need to handle this through official channels. - I mean it, Danny. No freelancing. - Allright... Look, I've got to... - You've got something on your... - Yeah, thanks. Is she injured? Nothing physical. But she was in shock. We gave her something to make her sleep. She had this. I'll keep this. Put that back. We don't want to upset her unless we have to. I want to know the minute she wakes up. *** SPOILERS!! *** Johnson's military. We can't go in on a hunch that she has some mysterious woman from the future. You tried to run. Why? I'll show you. - Oh, my God! - I'm guessing that's the bull. Keep the bull away, the anomaly's closed. - What is that thing?
