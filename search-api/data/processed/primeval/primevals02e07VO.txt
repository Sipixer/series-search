You'd better pray she hasn't hurt him. Where the hell is Stephen? Cutter knows about the conspiracy. Lester's the traitor. Cutter can't see that. Come with me. Are you still in love with her? I said who sent you? Leek. It was Leek. Why would Leek try and kill me? It's done. I planted the virus. Leek won't know a thing about it until it turns round and bites him. I wondered who was gonna come and... I was hoping it was gonna be you. Why are you so interested in these things? Primeval Series 2 Episode 7 Series Finale All those creatures. Why are they here? What are they going to do with them? Well, I could guess, but what's the point? It's gonna be OK. Helen's not interested in you. She's your wife. You should have kept her under control. You know what I mean. I hope your fiance knows you're such an old-fashioned girl. For your information, I don't have a fiance any more. Why, what happened? This job. Yeah. He thought I'd met someone else. Couldn't very well tell him it wasn't another man, so much as a... something-asaurus. Anyway, the truth of the matter is I've been feeling... ..different recently. Can we discuss this another time? I didn't start it. We do have other things to worry about. Imminent death, for example. It's OK. We're not gonna die. Helen's a lot of things, but she's not a killer. You really think she's in charge here? Yeah. Leek doesn't have the wit to do this on his own. He's seen what I can do, yet he still belittles me. It's your own fault, Oliver. You're too good at being insignificant. You won't forget our deal? Nothing happens to Nick. Er... I'd like to go home now. I don't want to be involved in anything...like this. Caroline. You leave her out of it. She's nothing to do with this. What? As someone really smart, you can be amazingly thick sometimes. A girl like Caroline falling for a shambling, adolescent mess like you. No, I don't think so. I paid her to pick you up. You see... people like me and you... ...we don't get the pretty girls, Connor. We're the nerds... the losers... the uncool. Speak for yourself. I do all right with women. What? I do. I'm just... I'm choosy. Where's Rex? Who cares? I do. Now tell me. I'm gonna enjoy this, Caroline. Don't wanna hurt you, Abby. Don't flatter yourself. You've got to stop this. Why? I think it's very entertaining. You are a sad little man, aren't you, Leek? Fine. I'll stop it. Guys£¬could we just - That's enough. Stop. Stop. Thanks, Connor. I didn't do it for you. Lorraine, you're sure there are no messages? No, sir. And there's been no anomaly alert? Where is everybody? None of them are responding to their mobiles. Leek is planning something and I want to know what it is! I'm in position. Whatever Leek's planning to do with those creatures Helen will have her own agenda. She always does. Lester says she's mad. No. She's extraordinary. Extraordinary? She tried to kill you. No, no, no. That was Leek. Bombs aren't Helen's style. But hostage-taking is. Well, she must have her reasons. God. Anyone would think you're still in love with the woman. Yeah. Probably am. Not so much to do with love or hate any more. It goes much deeper than that. We shared something that was unique. We connected. And there's nothing I can do about it. OK, then. Let me out of here now. Hey, do you mind? Mate! Do you wanna turn down the music? Mate. Hey. Are you gonna turn it down or am I gonna have to come over there and turn it down for you? What do you want? Listen, Stephen, this is no time for sulking. People are dying... right now and many more will die unless YOU do something. Look... Look, we need you. There's been an attack at a beach. We think it's a Silurian Scorpion. I can't get hold of Cutter. How can I trust you? Why shouldn't you trust me? Look, we haven't got time for this. All right, tell me what's going on. If I help you, I do it alone. - You're going to need backup. - No. If I so much catch sight of one of your men, I'm out. It's time we talked. What about? Fascinating. The same as Claudia in every external detail. Eyes, hair. In all visible ways she's the same woman. And yet she's completely different. Back off. A little more aggressive perhaps than the original. Claudia Brown becomes Jenny Lewis, a new person with a new identity. Interesting. As though nature allows only so much variation. Listen, you can still save yourself. Help us, and I'll make sure Lester goes easy on you. I think you'd be happier with your friends. Nick, you're with me. Where have they taken Jenny? Well, she's quite safe. - So are the others. - Yeah? So what's all this about? A fresh start, Nick. A new and better future. Abby, Connor. - How are you? Are you OK? - Yeah I'm fine. How's Cutter? He's OK. He's fine. And how are you? I'm all right. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's all very touching. Now if you don't mind... You wanted answers. Oh, my God. The world changed in a new direction once before. Your friend Jenny proves that if we can control the anomalies we can make it happen again. - Doesn't that excite you?  - No. I don't want to change the world, Helen. I happen to think it's rather beautiful just the way it is. Do you know what happens when we interfere? The damage we can cause. We can't damage the future, Nick. We can only alter it. It can't hurt you. Not unless Leek orders it to. The neural clamp overrides its instincts. You gave this technology to Leek? And you found it in the future. I discovered a lot of things. You can too if you want. Come on. I'll take you to Leek. Let me go, please. I...I won't say anything. You didn't know? You're just in time for dinner. Of course they'd prefer to hunt for their own food. But it's amazing how quickly they can be trained. Rex! If it's me you really want to talk to... why don't you just let the others go? The last time the world changed, it was an accident. But we can repeat that accident as an experiment under controlled conditions. So what do you want to do is, you want to change the present just to see what happens in the future? I knew you'd understand. What happens if you destroy the human race during this experiment? Then we bring it back again. I'm going to wake up soon. I know I am. This is just a dream. Stop snivelling, for goodness sake. Come on. Be nice. I knew there was something fake about her. The way she was all so lovey-dovey, and never even let you kiss her. She did, actually. Just never when you were around. Well, couldn't you tell she was faking it? Never mind. I hate myself for what I did to you. I was greedy and stupid. I'm sorry. You know I think this is why the anomalies first appeared, Nick. So that we can help create the future! No, everything, everything in nature is the result of random selection. Now if we start to disrupt that perfect balance then life just begins to unravel. I disagree. Let's see who's right. What's he doing here? I invited him. Well, never mind. I wanted him to see this anyway. Give away our location and your friends die. Is it Cutter? I'm afraid not. But Cutter is here with me and so are the others. They're fine... - for now. - It's only a matter of time until we track you down, Leek. If you don't... Listen to me. An hour ago I released a Silurian Scorpion into a well-known holiday resort. I can tell from your face it's already made an impact. I've positioned another dozen creatures in similar locations. Go on. Call off the search or I shall let them go one by one. What is it you really want, Leek? Is it money? I'll be in touch. What about the scorpion? That's your problem. I want every available person out looking for those creatures. And if Stephen calls for backup... Make sure he gets it immediately. It's done. Come and get it whenever you like. Money? Money! Is that what this is all about? The anomalies are unstoppable now. And in the future money will not mean very much but knowledge and power will. And I intend to be very, very powerful. You knew all of this and yet you still helped him. I need the right environment to conduct my research. What? What's going on? What's happening? What's happening? Nothing good. I underestimated you, Oliver. You're...you're a lot smarter than I gave you credit for. I know. How did you figure out that we'd rigged the anomaly detector? Oh, it wasn't difficult to see you'd found my Spyware. After that all I needed to do was remotely upload a modification from my laptop. Simple, really. Well, I never saw that coming. No, of course you didn't. But if you think that paying me compliments... ...is gonna buy your friends any more time... I'm afraid you're mistaken. What's going on? I think the Americans call it dinner theatre. I've got to get out. Let me out! No! We have to stick together. It'll pick off any stragglers first. Stay together. Don't worry guys, Cutter will get us out of this. Well, he better do soon. Stop this! All right. You've had your nasty little joke. Who said anything about a joke? Stop this. Now. You do not give me orders! No-one does. Abby? What are you doing? I know this creature. It's the one that killed Valerie. I thought Leek said it was dead. Well, it looks pretty well to me. It has to decide if I'm dangerous. Then what? Then it eats me. It's done. - Both parts? - Both parts. Leek won't know a thing about this until it turns round and bites him. Cutter, that's pathetic. I just patch my laptop up to the mainframe and I still have complete control over... COMPUTER: "Warning. Warning. System breach." Don't bother. Connor planted a virus in the detector. You downloaded it to your laptop when you hacked in. In a couple of minutes, the whole system's gonna be paralysed. "Security failure imminent. Security system disabled." Abby! Get out of there. Oh, no, what about Cutter? He'd want us to go. We've got to get up to ground level. "Warning. Animal containment facility offline." "Warning. Warning. Animal containment facility offline." You see, Nick? We still make a good team. We're not a team. I'm handing you over to Lester. No, you won't do that. I heard what you said in the cell. I know you still love me. Don't flatter yourself. I said exactly what you wanted to hear. You knew the cell was bugged. I thought it might be Leek's style. So I thought I'd put on a little performance, just in case. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean it. I don't believe you. I don't care. Now, get in front of me before I shoot you. I don't think you'll do that, Nick. Helen. "Warning. Warning. Warning. Mainframe contacting external network. Upload of data files commencing." What's going on? The detector's networked to an external mainframe. Well, stop it! I can't. Are we being sabotaged? I don't think so. It's sending us information. Come on! Right this way! It's OK. Scutosaurus. - We need to hit it!  - What? Hit it! Wait, wait. I'll take that, thank you. Right, come on. (Heartbeat slow down) I've had enough of this. Where have you been? "Listen, Stephen, there isn't much time." Lester kidnapped me. "I got away but I need you to come and get me." Kidnapped? Nick and the others are dead. "Lester had them killed." Stephen... Listen. Stephen, listen "Lester's gonna call you. Whatever he says, it's a trap." I'm going to tell you where I am, and then throw your mobile away. They can trace you with it. Which direction now? Any ideas? OK This way, then. Wait. Wait... It's Rex! It's Rex! Rex! Rex! Rex, Turn around! I can feel a draught. Not our most pressing problem now. We really don't have time for this! Fresh air. Connor! It's Rex. He's found a ventilation shaft to the surface. Come on. You first, Abby. Where did you learn to shoot like that? Most of my friends liked Pony Club. I preferred clay pigeons. Brilliant. Brilliant. Wait! Oh, my God, it's Rex, he's been hit. Rex! Is he all right? I think so. Come on. I got him in here. The least I can do is get him out. Will he be OK? He'll be fine. Thank you. Guys, we've got to get hold of Lester. Clearly a design fault. I'll have to correct that in the others. What others? I wouldn't bother trying to escape. They'll rip you to pieces before you could blink. My very own Praetorian guard. They'll make me untouchable. You really think you can keep them locked up for long? Properly chipped they're no more dangerous than a car or an aeroplane. A machine, designed for human use. No, that's not how it's gonna work, Oliver. Because one day they're gonna escape. And then when they do, they're gonna kill all of us. You're looking at the end of the human race. I'd love to stand around, discuss your apocalyptic fantasies all day, Professor... but unfortunately... I've got work to do. Now, in a few minutes, the mainframe will have eliminated the virus. Unfortunately, your friends have escaped. Lester will soon know where I am. But... I have you! And I don't think he'll attack me. I wouldn't bet on that. What is this place? I don't know. Lester's people brought me here. What happened to Cutter? There are creatures here, Stephen. He was killed. You saw it? Where's Lester? Oh, he's too powerful, Stephen. We can't stay here. I've been thinking. We should find another anomaly wait on the other side until it's safe. We have to confront him. Stephen, we have to go. He killed my friends. You've had your chance to surrender, Leek. I still have 12 creatures out there. One command from me and there'll be absolute chaos. Cutter didn't tell you? That clever little virus of his sent us the contents of your hard disk. We found names, locations, all sorts of useful stuff. We're just mopping up the last of your menagerie now. Oh, and Jenny just phoned. You have... oh, just a few minutes before we join you. Now, if you don't mind, I think there's some snooker on the other channel. Have you ever seen... A man torn in half on live TV, Lester? Call a halt to your men Or I shall order these creatures to dismantle Professor Cutter... joint by joint. The government does not negotiate with hostage-takers. 30 seconds, then they kill him. Your choice. James, don't do it. I'm not important. Ten... Unfortunately, I agree with Professor Cutter. Eight, Seven, six, five... No individual's life is more important than the protection of the public. Four, three, two, one... What have you done? They're gonna kill us all! No! Switch that off. There's no time. Forget about Lester, it's too late. Finish this now, Helen. You said he was dead. What have you done? Not you, too? Don't tell me you knew about this. Oh, I have never seen this place before in my life. I told you the truth! Lester brought me here. You ask her, ask her about what she really wanted to do. Go on, ask her about Leek, ask her about how many people were gonna die. He's trying to trick you. I so badly wanted to believe in you. But it doesn't put you in the right! Stephen, there's a whole army of predators in here. If any of them make it above ground, there's gonna be nobody left. Now, if you want to help people, we have to do this. They're too powerful, Nick. Nothing you can do. Well, you're gonna have to think of something or we're all gonna die. Now, you brought them here. You know them. The siren. The creatures associate the sound with food. They'll come back to the cage room whenever it sounds. If we can lock them in with the predators, they'll destroy each other. Come on, then. It's working. Let's get out of here. I'll seal the door. Nothing will get out. Stephen, shoot it! The creatures are almost here. Come on, Nick! We can't close the door! Or otherwise they're gonna get back out. We can only do that from in there now. The control is on the other side. Whoever does it gets locked in. One of us has got to go back in. I'll do it. You'll never make it out. Get out of here. Just remember, Lester's not the enemy. Nick, please! Stephen! Sorry, mate. I'm doing this one. No! Open the door! Open it! Can't do it, Nick. Can't take the risk. Stephen, open the door! Tell Abby and Connor... ..to stay out of trouble. Connor... I just wanted to say...sorry. I was thinking that... Well, you...you have my number. Drink? Another time, then. Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. Cutter! Had a call from the ARC. New anomaly. Better get going. Sorry. Bad timing. Cutter! Are you coming? Sure. Be patient, Stephen.
