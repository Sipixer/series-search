fine until he began complaining of a foul taste in his mouth and feeling dizzy. -Bad taste in his mouth? -Right before the dizziness. So he goes to get a drink of water, and ten minutes later, he's on the floor of the men's room. He stopped breathing. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:FRM@´ó±¦ Sync:FRS@33</font> Apparently, she started complaining about some sort of bad taste in her mouth. Then she started getting dizzy, and I'm thinking it's maybe some sort of poison? This is like classic "SLUDGE" syndrome. Hey, take her back. I'll check the poisons index. Checking symptoms right now. I'm connecting to the poisons index. Symptoms include salivation... Lacrimation... With loss of bladder and bowel control. Hey, we got a poison cluster here! No question about it. Test came back positive for anthrax. It's the real thing. An entire school for rock musicians. My dad would have an aneurysm. He used to yell at Bon Jovi on the TV. Well, he'd have loved Beethoven. Long hair, dressed like a tramp. Loved to throw food and trash furniture. Has no one been back here since, uh... -since they evacuated? -No. Uh, not here, not the victim's home, his workplace, or the bus he rode to work this morning. Yeah, well, an anthrax scare will do that. Well, we're five miles away from the White House. You can't blame Homeland Security for getting jumpy. Speaking of which, shouldn't we have masks on? If you like. Hood! Look, a friend of mine is a world expert on the Ebola virus. And, uh, they flew in a patient-- chartered aircraft, private airstrip, whole runway under quarantine. The crew were wearing full-body spacesuits. She met them at the airport,wearing street clothes and a pair of kitchen gloves. Disease is not the weapon. Fear is the weapon. You know there's a band called Anthrax. I'm more of a Cradle of Filth man, myself. You're joking, right? You see this? The students repair their own instruments. So...? -Dr. Hood? -Agent Young? Special Agent In Charge, Joe Brennan. I'm, uh, leading this case for the Joint Terrorism Task Force. I'm the one who called you in for the science consult. Hmm. Word at the Bureau is that, uh, you have yet to be stumped. So, uh, your perfect record going to remain intact? I'm not really one for statistics. Can you tell me, is your, um, anthrax victim a drummer? Yeah. Yeah, he was. Uh, how did you know that? Well, anthrax is caused by a bacterium that lives on, uh, grazing animals, and these, um... These drums are covered in... ...goat skin. You see, if you scrape off an infected skin to replace it, chances are, you're going to inhale some of the spores. That's why imported skins are inspected and licensed. I suspect the person you need to find is the person that made this drum, because he used a hide that was not inspected. So we're safe here? As long as you promise me you're not going to play the drums. I'm sorry, Agent Brennan, but, uh, I'm going to have to take Dr. Hood to Philadelphia. Yeah. No problem. I'll have the, uh,lab boys remove this drum right away. So, what's in Philadelphia? Trouble. You ever hear of the Toxic Exposure Surillance System? Yeah. It's a real-time database of poison victims. They keep a track of events that cluster in time and location. Well, that was Felix on the phone. They flagged a pattern just under two hours ago. People dropping all over Philadelphia with identical symptoms. The mystery lies in the timing and the complete absence of any connection between the victims. And we don't believe in coincidences, do we? Well, to quote Mr. Ian Fleming, "Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. "The third time, it's enemy action." Happenstance? Is that even a word? @@@You are... You are a loud one. Hey, Mrs. Wilson. Hey, is anything wrong? I-I was fine when I left the house this morning. I had to stop and sit down. I've got a taste like I ate something bad. Why don't you go home if you don't feel good? Oh, no. I'd rather be here. I'm not one of those people who live alone because they like it. Oh, here, let me take that, honey. -Oh, you sure? -Yeah. The Sanduskys are coming into town today, picking up Otis at 3:00, so I'm going to get him ready to go home. He's gonna miss Winston when he leaves. That's for sure. You should have seen the noise these two were making this morning when they were playing. Yes. Isn't that... Mrs. Wilson! Mrs. Wilson! Mrs. Wilson!Somebody help! I'm thinking organophosphate poisoning. I'm treating with atropine and PAM-2 chloride. Now, my first thought was it might be some kind of nerve agent, but it's way too slow. Which branch of the military did you serve in, Dr. Lieber? The Army. Who told you? Nerve agent would never be a civilian doctor's first diagnosis. Well, I don't know of any nerve agent that makes a patient explode. Technically, it was a fireball, not an explosion. But you're right. Five new cases, including the exploding woman. They all live in different parts of town, and they all work in different parts of town. They all dropped in different parts of town. If there is a link, it hasn't shown up yet. Can we talk to any of them? Well, not if they're all intubated and sedated like mine. Okay, let's, uh, put everything together and see what we've got. You-You can't move them. Not the people. Just the clothes and effects. Get a hold of Felix. Tell him to collect everything, see if he can find somewhere close by where we can work. Got it. Who is he? Agent Lee, advance scouting and support. No. Him. You know, there's that moment at the beginning of every disaster when it's like a genie flying out of a bottle. You get one chance to grab it by its neck before it's out of reach and out of control. He's the guy who does that. SLUDGE. Go ahead and curse for real, Hood. It helps. Just let it out. I've heard worse. It's hilarious. That's an acronym for the symptoms. Salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea. Okay, I get it. All the patients are affected the same way. I mean, organophosphate poisoning's not uncommon. It comes from exposure to pesticides or fertilizer. But it's usually chronic and low dose. It's not acute. And not five cases all at once. No. So, the question is, why would all these victims be exposed to a high dose? Sarin gas, maybe? Yeah, well, that's the right kind of thinking, 'cause it does affect the, uh, central nervous system, but I think the doctor's right. It's too slow-acting to be a nerve agent. Maybe there's some other way the poison could be weaponized. Or maybe it was just an accidental release. We have to get more facts before we can make a picture. I was prepping to work onsite security for the big G-8 summit in D.C. when I got the call about this. I was really hoping I could meet the president. I'm sure he'll be disappointed. The G-8's this week? Don't you watch the news? Only when there's no cartoons on. All right, then. Each bag contains the clothes and effects of one patient. You used gloves to handle everything? Yeah, just like you said. Well, if it is poison, there could be some traces on the clothes. If it was poison, shouldn't the blood tests have picked that up? You test for specific things. It's like a Catch 22. You need to have an idea of what you're looking for so you can choose the right test to find it. Yeah, well, in this case, um, it could be any number of factors. Snake venom, uh, pesticides. Even some of the new, uh, Alzheimer's drugs,in high enough doses. Do any of those things ever cause a person to explode? No, not really. It could be something new. You need anything else? yeah, a map. Of? Philadelphia, suburbs. I'm on it. Hey, Felix, nice work collecting up all the evidence and improvising a work space so quickly. Maybe next time... Hey, Felix? Nice work. You know, back in the '90s, I heard of, uh, certain governments who'd try to take down their enemies by using poisoned clothing. That's one designer label you'd want to avoid. There was one who was a civil rights worker,European lady. Checked into this big corporate hotel, and there was this pretty fancy bathrobe waiting for her in her closet. So, she puts it on, wears it for about an hour, and she nearly died. Did she explode? No. Most deaths from acute O.P. poisoning, um, happen through muscle paralysis. Nice. Yeah, everything closes up, and you end up asphyxiating, but even a small amount is enough to damage you for life. So even if our victims respond to treatment, they could still wind up damaged? Yeah. We have to get on top of this pretty quickly. The sooner we find out what's happening, the sooner we can help them. This is Rachel. Thanks for letting us know. Mrs. Wilson-- the fireball victim-- she just died. Well, I hate to say it, but with 80% burns, her chances were never very good. Now... I guess we better start looking through their stuff, see what kind of picture emerges. Who lived where, who was married, who used nicotine gum. Does leave a bad taste in your mouth. Yeah, what we're looking for really is, uh, things the victims had in common. A place, a habit, guilty secret. That's the kind of thing that's going to help us find our poison. Okay. Mrs. Wilson was a widow on a fixed income. Brown eyes, organ donor, member of the Philadelphia Free Library, and she worked part-time at a doggy day care. Hood. It's nothing. Whatever caused the fireball was consumed in the flames. Okay, Ames, let's go over the agenda. First we pick up your poor sick brother from school, then we get to go to work with Mommy. -Cool. -And we get to ride the train. And guess what? You might get to watch the movie with the other kids today. Awesome. I need your cell phones, your wallets, and the Medic Alert bracelet. Anything they can use to identify you. Does anyone have a 20 on Andre? Okay, if he's not here in 15 minutes, we go without him. You know, what we're about to do... demands absolute discipline. Does everyone understand that? 'Cause any deviation from the plan will not be tolerated... and will be dealt with by me... putting a bullet into your head. Now, if anyone is feeling nervous, having second thoughts, if anyone wants to back out... sorry, it's too damn late. Okay, 986 River Street and 74 West Norwich. Norwich. 856 North Columbus and 2843 Eureka Terrace. Eureka. Last one woke up at 8209 Cyers Lane and went down at 4413 East 61st Street. I love Post-its. One of the best inventions of the 20th century. What do you think, Hood? Yeah, I, I kind of like the fact that you can stick them onto anything. @@@ About this. Oh... yeah. The yellow flags are the victims' homes, and the red ones show the places wherthey fell. No pattern. Exactly. No pattern can be, uh... quite significant. Sometimes it's a matter of... looking for what isn't there. Anyone see any car keys? -No. -No. Me neither. Everyone here lived on one end of town and worked on the other. So if we, uh, if we just draw a line from every home to every workplace... ...what do we get? A messed-up map. I'll buy you an atlas. Subways. There's more than one subway pass here. And tokens. Well... I'll bet that everyone here used the transit system at some point in the morning. They would have passed each other roundabout here in the center of town. Oh, wow, City Hall station. That's the busiest stop on the whole Philly subway system. We have to speak to someone who knows about the Philadelphia... Let me get that for you, Doc. No, I got it. Call the Philadelphia Police Department. Have them alert the SWAT team. Can I tell them what they'll be dealing with? I don't know yet. Could be a leak or a spill. Could be snakes on a train. Okay, baby doll, Mommy's got one last thing to do. Hi, if you're calling about temporary employment, I'm sorry, but we have everyone we need for the next event, but please leave your name and number and we'll put you on our list. Thank you for calling the Broad Street Theater. Great! Bingo! We're done, baby. You want to read out the signs as we pass by? Remember, we have to get off at City Hall. This is going to be such a fun day. Captain Ashton? Yeah, but you can call me Clark. Hi, I'm Special Agent Rachel Young. This is my colleague Dr. Jacob Hood. -Hi. -Dr. Hood,Agent Young. So, what can I help the FBI with today? We're investigating several cases of poisoning in the city in the last 24 hours. Only connection we have between the victims is this subway station. We get close to 60,000 people through this station every day, so if all your victims met, chances are it was here. Can we narrow it down? That's pretty much impossible with all these trains and so many ways through. But nothing weird happened here today, no incidents? No, sir, just a normal day. Still I'm gonna have to ask you to evacuate the station, please. Keep the trains running through, just don't have them stop. I can't just do that. Sure, you can. You're going to have to give me some grounds here. Multiple poison victims on your watch, Captain Ashton, and whatever happened to them happened right here, so lock everything down and give Dr. Hood the cooperation he needs. Okay? Full station's gotta be evacuated... Now what? Let's get Felix down here. We need another set of boots on the ground. Are you going to watch the movie? Are you going to sing along with the songs? -Uh-huh. -Uh-huh. City Hall! Goody. The 15th Street and City Hall interchange is temporarily closed. We apologize for the inconvenience. All clear, platform one. Platform four, all clear. South lobby has been evacuated. Rachel? Rachel? -This button to talk. -Oh, I knew that. Rachel? Can you hear me? Rachel? Okay, for the purposes of our little reenactment-- oh. Rachel? Sorry. For the purposes of our little reenactment, um, you are going to be our lawyer Philip Roxner. Philip's wife says he left home at 8:10 for the 8:25 train, which arrived here at... Um... 8:54. 8:54. So start walking... now, please. Rachel, you follow the signs for the Market-Frankford Westbound. Felix. I can see it coming. You...are Claudia Spinoza,our second victim. I knew it. You'll be headed to Broad Street via Lombard South. Start walking... now, please. I am Claudia Spinoza, headed to Broad Street via Lombard, pushing my way through a dense and reckless crowd. What are you trying to do? Well, I'm trying to recreate two of the victims' journeys in real time, so if their paths cross, we'll see where. Then what? Then we'll... look at what happened on that spot. They're not going to meet up. What about there? No. She's way ahead of him. She'll be gone through there. She's trying to say something. Rachel, remember,you can hear me, but I can't hear you. Hey, voice of God, you fold a map like a girl. But I can read your lips. Felix. I can see it coming. You...are Claudia Spinoza, I knew it. You'll be headed to Broad Street via Lombard South. Start walking... now, please. I am Claudia Spinoza, headed to Broad Street via Lombard, pushing my way through a dense and reckless crowd. What are you trying to do? Well, I'm trying to recreate two of the victims' journeys in real time, so if their paths cross, we'll see where. Then what? Then we'll...look at what happened on that spot. They're not going to meet up. What about there? No. She's way ahead of him. She'll be gone through there. She's trying to say something. Rachel, remember, you can hear me, but I can't hear you. Hey, voice of God, you fold a map like a girl. But I can read your lips. You lip read? Hold on. What if they don't follow the signs? Say what? Well, normal people-- when they take the same journey every day, they learn the short cuts, don't they? I mean, uh, across the wrong platform, up the down escalator. The path they take is called the desire line. Felix? Change of plan. Um, how do you feel about backing up and going down the left, down that corridor? Ignore that sign. Go up the escalator. Make a left. Okay, I think we wasted about 20 seconds doing that. - Think you can make up the time? - Yeah Here we go. Come on. Got it. There. So, that spot... 8:57 this morning. Young guy with the backpack... rewind that. Okay, forward. Slow it. - Freeze. - He just bumped into everybody. They all got sprayed with something. Okay, forward. Philip, the lawyer... Mike, the meat packer. Claudia Spinoza. And there's our Mrs. Wilson. Bless her soul. Can you stay with him? The guy with the backpack. - Okay, he's trying to make a call. - Cell service down here is spotty. Most phones work on the platforms, but not in the tunnels. Next. - Where'd he go? - He was right behind that ball guy. He couldn't have just disappeared. What turns an organophosphate from a poison into an explosive? You talking to me? No. I'm just... Sulfur. Where would, uh, our dog owner, Mrs. Wilson, encounter sulfur? My mom puts a piece of rock sulfur in her little Yorkie's water bowl. People say it keeps the fleas away. - Huh. - Hood, what? That's interesting. What is it? Felix moves out, his mother gets a Yorkie. Hey. Threw up, huh? Yeah. - What did you trade your snack for? - Nothing. Darren. Betty Chong asked me to share her ice cream. Ah. And tough guys don't have milk allergies, huh? No. That Betty Chong... she must be really something. - Come on. - Trust me. She is. Okay, now, right here is about where you saw him last. Okay, standing by, Doc. Losing you from camera...now. Peekaboo, I see you. Back on camera, Doc. Rachel What's through here? It's an old fallout shelter. We use them for storage now. - I can get through there. - No. Can you open this for us? Rachel. What's this? One of the old civil defense rooms. Please. It's been here since the Cuban Missile Crisis. They used it to store water... medical supplies. Whoa, Rachel. What is it? Nothing good. Dr. Hood is with a hazard team from the fire department. We alerted Homeland Security. We closed a tunnel and two exits and are rerouting people to Dilworth Plaza. As long as we keep the two contaminated rooms completely separate from the station, we should be okay to reopen. Okay, sir. I'll keep you posted. - The director? - Yep. He ask about me? How I'm doing with the job, anything like that? Oh, yeah... you were at the top of his agenda. Excuse me. Agent Young. How am I supposed to know if I'm doing my job well? You're still here. In the canisters are the two precursors of a binary nerve weapon. One's an ordinary, uh, sulfur compound. The other is a phosphonite called Agent QL. You mix those two together, they make a lot of heat, but they also make, uh, VX nerve gas. Now, if the reaction goes out of control, the whole mess turns into a fireball. Now, VX nerve gas was outlawed, uh... international convention around '93. So, how does a kid like that get his hands on the precursors? Well, after it was outlawed, there was a lot of it lying around waiting to be destroyed. Guess it wasn't that difficult to get a hold of a canister or two. As to how and why he got hold of it, that's not really my department. Found this in the John Doe's mouth. He tried to swallow it. As he was dying? He really didn't want us to find it. It's a phone number. If you're calling about temporary employment, I'm sorry, but we have everyone we need for the next event. But please, leave your name and number, and we'll put you on our list. Thank you for calling... What kind of suicide bomber worries about his job prospects? I don't understand, Hood. I thought the government destroyed all our chemical weapons. They're still working on it. You know what they did in the 1960s? They'd take big old freighters, and they'd fill them up with VX warheads. They'd sail them out in the middle of the sea, and then they'd sink the entire boat with the weapons on board. Dumping all that stuff in the sea... it sounds like a recipe for making Godzilla. Yeah. Well, Hedorah. What? Godzilla was, uh, the product of atomic radiation. Hedorah is the pollution monster. Oh. You know what? "Hedorah" is Japanese for "sludge." Same as the syndrome. - Salivation, lacrimation... - Got it. Ooh. Bingo. FBI got a fingerprint match on our John Doe. Cross-referenced it with MI6 and Interpol. He's a Belgian born exchange student by the name of Andre Balvaux. Not on any terrorist watch lists, but he was in the Belgian army and he has a history of mental illness. Couple of violent episodes. That's why his prints are on file. Hello, everyone. Hi, I'm so sorry to keep you all waiting. Really, I apologize. Please don't worry about it. Just give me two minutes. I just have to get my kids situated, so... come on inside. Why was Mrs. Wilson was burned rather than poisoned? 'Cause she was wearing gloves. Took longer to reach her skin. When the raw sulfate she was working with hit the phosphonite on her clothing, it's flashpoint. I don't know why I didn't think of it earlier. When it's all so obvious. Uh Do you mind? - Has that been decontaminated? - Yes, ma'am. - We'll get it back to you later. - Alright. Voicemail. Where the hell are you? We're ready to go. If we screw this up 'cause there's only five of us, it's your fault. He's not alone. He's part of a team. The number he tried to swallow is for the Broad Street Theater. It's a movie house three blocks away. They do events and things. Anything special on today? Family sing-along: Wizard Of Oz. The subway was never the target. He was on his way to the target. Okay, guys. You know the rules. You don't leave this room unless it's with me or someone you know. - Got it? - Got it. You better open a window. He's farting. I need four volunteers to hand out song sheets at the doors. Great. The rest of you will show people to reserved seating. Three-quarters of the theater tickets are for general admission, so it shouldn't get too crazy. And, also, if anybody gives you any problems-- the children or any of the adults-- - Don't try to handle it yourself. - Time is soon Come to me. That's why I'm here. We have preschoolers coming. The theater is sold out. It's going to be a lot of people. FBI, ma'am. Please move your kids quickly and quietly across the street. Let's go. - So come down and get yourself sheet. - Ma'am? Hello? - Are you in charge here? - Yes, I am. Special Agent Rachel Young, with the FBI. Move! Move! Ma'am get down! Ashton's been hit. Stay here. Don't move. My kids! - Freeze! Put your weapons down! - Don't shoot! I surrender! Put your weapons down and hands where I can see them. Hey! Freeze! Freeze! Hood, are you ok? Move in and secure their weapons. Put your hands behind your back. It's okay, guys. See this? Your mom send me. - Make it tight. - You okay? No sweat. How you doing, captain? - I'm all right. - Rachel? I found this. I think it's some kind of statement to the press. Extremists... but not from the Middle East. European and American converts. Easier to blend in. I think the plan was to take these kids hostage and release a statement to the G-8 politicians demanding the release of all Holy Warriors in Western custody, or else. Avoid the high security of the capital, go for a soft target in a nearby town. Let's go, kids. Let's go. Oh! Take me instead. Why should I do that? Because I can show you the way out. You don't recognize any of them? - Uh, no. - ok, these all to take your statements Rachel... Excuse me. - Yeah? - So we got three people here, we got a body inside. He said five. - Who did? - The English guy. On the voicemail. He said, "If we screw this up 'cause we only had five, it's your fault." Felix! Emergency exit. Yeah - Stay here! - Don't go anywhere, I'll be back. You think that was smart? You guys okay? He's got our mom! You stay here. There! Oh, boy. Where the hell are they? Hello? This is Jacob Hood. Um, I just wanted to tell you-- whoever you are, it's over. I'm a Holy Warrior. It's not over yet. Holy, really? How do you work that out? Huh? You were just trying to kill a lot of innocent people, innocent children-- just to get the attention of a bunch of G-8 politicians. How many innocent Muslim children have been slaughtered by those same politicians? I don't want to debate politics with you. Just let your hostage go. When I'm free and clear...not before. I don't believe you. Tough. FBI-- out of the way! Get out of here! Move! Move! - It's on me! It's hot! - Don't touch it! Don't touch it. - Stay right here. - Oh, what are you doing? Oh! Get away! FBI, get away! Move! Move! FBI! Out of the way! Sorry. Move! Move! This is chlorine bleach. Neutralizes the VX. - What's that? - VX nerve gas. - Oh! - Don't worry! Close your eyes. - This needs to come off. - Okay. - No, wait. - Not over the head. Let me do it. Drop your weapon! Move! Move! Move! Clear! Clear! Federal agents! Move! Move! Clear! Freeze! Federal agents! Drop your weapon! There are two of us covering you with a five-round revolver. How many bullets do you think you have left? I only need one. Don't touch him. So, Agent Young, what's the protocol here? Am I supposed to turn in my weapon or...? You've never done this before. Before today I never fired a shot outside of the range. How do you feel? Not exactly sure. No amount of training can prepare you for pulling the trigger that first time in a real situation. It's a heavy responsibility. But you saved a lot of lives today, Felix. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Oh, sweeties! Oh, hey, come here, honey. - Oh, I love you. - We missed you. I missed you, too. - Brave woman. - Yep. Speaking of brave, Agent Lee did a hell of a job today.
