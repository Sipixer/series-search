refuses to stop. WOMAN 25, copy. Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Forgive them, Father, for what they've done. My God. That makes 19 of them, sir. 19 containers... 19 fetuses. Is this the last one? Yeah. Hey, there's a guy from Washington, DC in the evidence tent. Sorry. Who did you say you work for? I didn't. What the hell's going on here? Do you have a badge? I'm Detective McNeil. I'm in charge of this case. Sorry. But you came up on him too quick. Good morning. I'm Dr. Jacob Hood. Special science advisor to the FBI. And that's Special Agent Rachel Young. Science advisor? Yeah, I was appointed to investigate crimes and crises of a scientific nature. What you found here certainly falls under that category, wouldn't you say? You. Out. You mean the 19 dead babies and 19 graves that didn't dig themselves. That's not accurate; what you've got here is 19 terminated fetuses. You drink milk from a carton? Why? The barcode on the carton is the same principle as a DNA profile. DNA is a personal barcode. Each one is different, therefore unique. Now, this... is the profile of the 12-week-old fetus that was thrown from the truck last night. And this is a profile of the first one you dug up. Spot the difference. I dare you. I can't. Of course you can't. Because they're identical. All 19 of them. Do you know anything about cloning? Remember Dolly the sheep? Yeah. Well, this abomination is what happens when you try it with human beings. -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Eleventh.Hour µÚ1¼¾µÚ1¼¯</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- Ê±¼äÖá£º£Ò£Á£Ù£Å£Ó&²ËÖíÖí</font> ???? What's he need you for? Dr. Hood is a high-priority asset. He's a brilliant biophysicist, but he spends most of his time in his head, so I have to watch his back. About a year ago, some radical group had his car bombed. You want to see him blush, ask him where the shrapnel is. You see, he's got this annoying habit of telling the truth, and the truth hurts a lot of people's pockets. And no, I'm not free for dinner. It's in the eyes, Detective McNeil. David? David? David? Has anyone seen my son? David? The judge told you to leave us alone. It's a free country, Kelly. I can move to any city I want to, just like you did. Kid's got a right to see his dad, you know? Not after what you did to me. Let go of my son. Wait for Mommy over there, okay? Well... I notice you've been keeping busy. I'm taking care of us, which is more than you ever did. Don't say that, and then walk away from me! Hey, you leave her alone! Should I call the police? This guy you arrested is not a microbiologist, by any chance, is he? He's an unemployed security guard. No priors. He said that someone was paying him to incinerate the containers; then once he found out what was in them, he couldn't bring himself to do it. How come you don't know who's behind all this cloning stuff? You seem to know everything else. There's someone we've been chasing for a long time, and his first attempts at human cloning were in Eastern Europe, then South America. Both failed. Now I believe he's come here. The question is, why? So, what's next? Can you recommend a good hotel? Kelly? It's Mrs. Muller. I've come to get you. Kelly, can I come in? I trusted you people. That's why I'm here. Your own personal nurse. Let me help you. Please. Hi. So, I'm gonna charge Sanders with accessory to murder. That will get him talking. A judge will ask why. Technically, a fetus is medical waste. It's not murder. What, so I've got nothing? Breathe, McNeil. You got a crime here, a big crime. I wouldn't be here if you didn't. Implanting a woman with an embryo created by any means other than fertilization is illegal. Yeah, but it's not murder, which means I've wasted too much time already. Tell me you didn't just say wasted. Anything that helps us, Detective, call me. He's just doing his job. 19 fetuses. You know what that means? 19 mothers. How do you keep them all quiet? Is the baby okay? Please tell me. Kelly, in a minute. I just keep thinking about that childless couple, and it would break their hearts if I lost this baby. That's a nice thought, Kelly. Keep that thought. What is it? What's wrong? It's the placenta. It's lying a little low and blocking the entrance to the womb. Is that bad? You just relax. Nature has a way of making things right. If something did go wrong, I would still get the money, wouldn't I? That childless couple you're so concerned about are not a charity, Kelly. I need that money, Doctor. I need to get away from here. From people. We should send her home. She's got grade three previa. She's also got the most viable fetus we've ever seen. More reason to have her in a hospital under constant supervision. For a doctor, you can be amazingly stupid. She should be delivered. It's too early. Besides, the baby might not survive. At least the girl would. She's a time bomb. You want to risk that? With great risks come great rewards. I don't want another dead mother on my conscience. If she goes into labor, she will die. Hello, Will. Do I know you? We need to have a talk. Cops never charged me. Who the hell are you? By nature, a deeply sensitive person. But she's not. Get lost. Sugar rush. Wait. Wait. You can't do this to me. It's time to clear your conscience, Will. I know you're a man of faith, and we both know, at the heart of faith... lies the truth. Jesus knows my heart, and he forgives me. Does he? Okay, let's ask him. Look at him, Will. Look at the nails in his hands, in his feet, the wound in his side. You telling me you'd let that suffering continue? Answer me! Please let me go. Ask his forgiveness, and he will forgive you if you truly repent. Now, tell the truth. Who paid you to get rid of the containers? Can you please stop this? He knows the secrets of your heart, Will. Cleanse yourself, Will. Tell him. It was a woman. I didn't know her name. You lie to me, you're lying to him. I burned the first one 'cause she said it was medical waste. It was easy money. I didn't think. Easy money means restless nights. You must have a name. I don't know her name. Liar! I looked inside the second one and I wished I hadn't. But it was too late. My soul was dark. God must forgive me, though. Yoknow what I think, Will? I think you're a waste of God's time. Let's go. Geppetto. She talked to somebody on the phone called Geppetto. There's where they treated the girls. I worked here as a night guard till they shut the place down. You don't see divine intervention at hand, man? The woman asked me to drive the girls here. Then she gives me something, says I should burn it. I look anyway. I praise God for choosing me to give them a decent burial. It's a shame he didn't choose you to tell the cops instead. How did they keep this quiet? Cash. Lots of cash. A traveling clinic. Is this where the woman treated the girls? Her and a man. Sharp guy- a... doctor. Geppetto? No, that's who they call after they were finished with the girl. Well, this is stage two. This is where they implanted the embryos, but this isn't where the actual cloning would take place. That would require a real lab. Liquid nitrogen. Westec Veterinary Services- for the transporting of bovine semen. They're hardly going to label it "Frozen clone embryos: handle with love. " This was just a cover. You got your panic button? I think so. Freeze! FBI! Hey! Hood! What was that? What? That, with the arms? I got the license plate. Why do I bother? I guess they won't be coming back here for a while. Ow. This place was set up just to... monitor the pregnancies and terminate the failures. Any obstetrician, along with a half decent nurse, could do that, but stage three, the birth- that's when you need the scientist. Geppetto. What? Wood, where are we going now? To see a vet. What if I told you that someone not far from here is close to cloning a human being? Is that supposed to shock me? What was your title again? Dr. Hood is fine. Well, Dr. Hood, some people think it's already been done. Not by you, right? We found this in a... makeshift delivery room. And so you presumed we're cloning people? I'm flattered. We're the largest biological distribution company on the West Coast. We ship hundreds of samples from around the world every day. And you're asking me to trace a label? That was a waste of time. In science, a negative result is just as important as a positive one. "And when the king returned to his castle, "he found that his trusted servant had made him a beautiful... " ..."a beautiful coat filled with all kinds of... " Oh! Oh, David, honey. Oh, give Mommy a second while... while this pain goes away. Okay? Yes. Dr. Hayward? Kelly. Can I meet you at the warehouse? No. Y- Y-You can't do that. Oh! Then I have to go to the hospital. No, uh, Kelly, um, if you go to the hospital, Social Services will take David away from you. Do you want that? But I'm bleeding really badly. No hospitals. Understand? Can I buy you a drink? Before you disturb me, you should know I'm filling out this paperwork because I shot at a man today. Why? Because he disturbed me. Okay. Thanks. Why does the name Geppetto sound so familiar? You mean apart from being Pinocchio's dad? Right. You know, I never understood that story. An old wood-carver wants a son so badly that he makes one of his own? Get a wife, why don't you? Weird. Rachel. Hmm? You are brilliant. I know. Why? Why am I brilliant? I kept asking myself, "Why choose to do the embryo implanting here?" But he didn't choose, you see. That decision was made for him, for Geppetto. He who pays the piper calls the tune. Somebody right here in Seattle wants their son back from the dead. Excuse me. Local publications, 2005, please. Why 2005? The first fetus was found 18 months ago. Whatever we're looking for must have happened before then. Give Mommy her phone, please. I'm calling 911. Look for families who have lost a son. What makes you think we'll find it here? Whoever fronts Geppetto has got to be wealthy. Cloning is a very expensive business. The poor die in silence, the rich die public. That's the way it's always been, so keep looking. For what? The small ads under "Human Cloning"? What's your name? Can you hear me? Laura. Laura's my name. Laura, how long have you been bleeding? Not long. Mom! David! Mom! David! Just relax. Social Service is taking care of him. No! No! Mom! I think I've found him. A needle in a haystack. How many needles try to commit suicide three times after they've lost a loved one? Why can't we go visit this man, Mr. Gifford? Because it's late. Keep your panic button handy, please, and use your cover name if... If I want to order in myroom. Good night. Good night. What is your cover name? Mr. Smith. Jones. Mr. Jones. I'll be right down. What do you got? The car that tried to run over your guy was rented by a Dr. Sidney Hayward, an obstetrician. Can you trace him? Already did; he's gone. What do you mean "gone"? Struck off the medical registrar two years ago. Drink? No. His house was put into foreclosure and the IRS froze his bank accounts. Ah. I owe you one, okay? So how long you been with the doctor? Uh, it was supposed to be two months and... You know, I looked you up. FBI Executive Protection Detail. That's, uh, pretty cool. Sure you don't want a nightcap? I said I owe you one. I never said I'd give you one. Sidney Hayward- erratic driver and baby doctor. What did he do, run off with a patient? Does it matter? Give me a doctor with a steady hand over one with a steady home anytime. But you don't think he's our Geppetto, do you? No. To clone anything requires skill and knowledge way beyond this guy's capabilities. Well, how do you know he doesn't have those capabilities? Because to clone anything... takes science stroked gently with artistic hands. You got a pair of tweezers? Yeah. Not to keep. Now, imagine this is a woman's egg. Well, the seed inside it is her nucleus that contains her unique DNA. Now, if you want to make a clone, the first thing you do is get rid of the nucleus. Believe it or not, I use those. Then, you replace it with the nucleus of any cell of the person you want to clone. Original egg, new DNA in the nucleus. So, next, you shock it with a little jolt of electricity. Don't say Frankenstein. The electricity fools the egg into thinking it's been fertilized. Within a week, it's making stem cells, which then grow into the person of your choice. You place these inside the womb of your carrier. Next, you hire a disgraced and penniless gynecologist, like Hayward, to bring in the harvest. Cannibal. McNEIL: We've been monitoring city hospital maternity wards</i> for any suspicious activity. We got a call on the radio about a girl who was admitted to intensive care with her four-year-old son. Hospital child care was looking after the boy when she just goes in and grabbed him and then just vanished. Apparently, she's in bad shape. And pregnant, right? Right. The bleeding's not her biggest problem. Her placenta is covering the exit of her womb. Placenta previa. If this girl's contractions start with this condition, she could die. Can we go home, Mommy? Not just yet, sweetie. We're wasting precious time. We should go and see this man. Let the cops find the girl first. See if she leads us back to Gifford. Right now you need to get some rest. We'll go first thing in the morning. But this is the only lead we've got. He's a name in a newspaper, not a lead. You don't know if this girl's involved with Geppetto, and you want to go bang on some billionaire's door in the middle of the night with no real justification? Don't push me, Hood. I won't let you wear me down like you did the others before me. I have never failed at any assignment, and I don't intend to start now. Settled. If you need me, I'll be right down the hall. WOMAN It can literally turn back the clock on aging skin. Its special deep-penetration formula acts to reduce lines... Lies. Do you suffer from male-patterned baldness? Not anymore. Renewgent 12 is guaranteed to grow new hair... More lies. You got a nice, uh, 18-year-old single malt? Okay. No ice. Hood? Hood?! Oh, crap. I must have sat on it. Drink? We shouldn't be doing this. It's a blind risk factor for you. Based on what, a hunch? Once upon a time, gravity was just a hunch. Mr. Gifford, I'm Dr. Jacob Hood. This is Rachel Young. What can I do for you? We're here about your late son, Gabriel. Meningitis is a terrible disease. Maybe it wouldn't be if they did some more research. Is Mrs. Gifford at home? Losing a child has repercussions. My wife left. Would you say life is precious? Where did that come from? It's just a question. Can you answer? Hood. See, there's a pregnant girl out there, Kelly, and she's going to lose her life because she's too scared to get medical help, so... is life precious, Mr. Gifford? I think you should leave now. I suppose you don't know who Dr. Sidney Hayward is? Do you? Where is she? Where's Kelly? That girl is somebody's mother, and if she dies, she'll be missed by her own son. Don't you dare try to teach me about grief. And if you don't leave, I'm calling the police. We'll save you the call. Guys like him can lie all day day long and never get tired of it. Let's try... this. You stole his telephone? It was just lying there. Now this'll work as long as we stay 100 feet from the phone base. There was a brochure for Westec Veterinarian services on the table, and in about 30 seconds, he's gonna make a panic call. Why are you calling us? Someone named Jacob Hood just left my house. He knows. I'm telling Geppetto to cut this girl loose. You can't do that. Why not? Because she'll die. And her baby has the best chance of a live birth yet. Now, calm down while we go check on the girl. Kelly? Kelly? Kelly, it's me. I brought Dr. Hayward for you. The contractions have started. He'll take care of you. No. I want a hospital now! McNEIL: Kelly Frost, 20 years old. She has a criminal record? Yeah, assault. Her ex used to treat her like a punching bag. When she got sick of it, she fought back. And what do you know. He pressed charges. We've got a problem. A big problem. Girl needs an emergency C-section. Oh, my God. Wait. Geppetto wants to be present at the birth. I've made that call already. If we don't do this right now, they're both going to die. Whatever it takes. There's a clinic on Bainbridge Island. It's been closed only a few months, but it's still fully equipped. I can use it, but we're gonna need cash up front. Consider it done. And Gifford, you know we're only talking viable here. Nobody's promising perfect. Who are you? You must have the wrong apartment. Where's Kelly? I don't know any Kelly. All right. Kelly?! Kelly?! David, can you tell Daddy where Mommy went? The man took her. What man? Do you know? Uh-uh? All right, can somebody please tell me what the hell's going on here?! Can you talk? Who are you? ...you! Right. Abusive ex-boyfriend. Who did this? Some woman did this. Can you get me an ambulance? Please? Where's Kelly? I don't know. Agh! Okay, okay. Just pull this out of my neck. It's not a good idea. That's your external jugular vein. Scissors are actually slowing the blood flow. Pull those out, you'll be dead in minutes. Best if you stay calm. Where's my mommy? It's okay. I need you to help me save a life. But it could mean your job. Would I be doing this in the name of science or the law? How about in the name of good? Geppetto will be here soon. Hayward? We could save ourselves. Give them Geppetto. I agree. Make the call. Mr. Gifford? You know what today is, Mr. Gifford? Yes. It's my son's new birthday. No. Today is the first day of you accepting Gabriel is dead. Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this? How many false hopes? You won't stop this. In an hour, I'm gonna have my reborn son in my hands again. You can't believe that. You ever lost a child? How could you possibly know what I'm going through? Two years ago my wife died. I nursed her till her last breath. Every day, I'd look for some... little sign. Helped me to believe she might get better. There isn't a day that passes... when I don't wish she was back. It's not the same. One of you dies first. That's sad. But that's the deal. When my son died, my life was over! It's called grief. It's natural. I want him back. What you're doing is only making your pain intolerable. What could be worse than my son dying? Your son dying over and over again. That's not possible. You want to see Gabriel again? Do you? Behold... your son. Now, even if he'd survived the genetic mutation, even if he'd been perfect in every sense, this would never have been the boy you knew. This would have been some other... different child. Gabriel is not the product of his DNA. He's the sum of every day you spent with him. Every meal his mother cooked for him. Every story you read him. Every ball you threw for him to catch. I'm sorry you had to find out this way, that Gabriel's soul... is so much more than just its constituent chemical parts. I don't know what's going to happen to the baby the girl is carrying, and she is that. She's just a girl. And she will die unless you help me. So where is Kelly? What happened? Somebody asked me to come in here and help. Do you know this girl? Kelly. Her name is Kelly. Do you know CPR? Of course. Get the air bag. She's lost a lot of blood. Find a refrigerator, O negative. Do it. You a doctor? I was. More oxygen. Squeeze until you see the chest inflate. What about the baby? She lost him a long time ago. "Him"? How'd you know that? You're Geppetto. You'll have to take over now, if you want to save her. So you just walk away? Every scientific experiment requires sacrifice. She's not an experiment. She's a human being. You should care. Playing God has its disadvantages. Nice to finally meet you, Dr. Hood. Come on, Kelly! Hood! Rachel, I need your help. Cops are on their way. Oh, God... Come on, Kelly! Come back for David! Come back for David, Kelly. Come on. Hood. So thank you, again, for everything. You're gonna be okay. The doctor said I can't have kids anymore. All the more love for the one you have. You take care. You, too. No sign of Geppetto. But, uh, Lea's in custody and talking. Yes? Hello? Okay. Gotta go. There's a situation. What kind of situation? A delicate one.
