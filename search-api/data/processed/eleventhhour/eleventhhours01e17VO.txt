- Smile, smile for us. - Right here! Hailey. Right here! Hi, Hailey, over here! Hey, hey, wait, what are you doing? She's mine! No! Stop it!??? ??? - Help her! - Help her! - Oh, my God, - what did he do? Hey, welcome to Fashion Week. You're looking at one of two sudden and unexplained violent outbursts that took place in the last 24 hours. NYPD's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Division tested for airborne toxins, but no luck. Uh, any connection between the acts of violence? Not really. Model got her spine snapped by a security guard, and here a photographer was beating her agent to death until the agent decided to stick a pen in his neck. - Who is she? - Hailey Vaughn. Hailey Vaughn, cover of Vogue,Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition. Okay, that Hailey Vaughn. Okay, anyone involved have a history of any priors? No, all upstanding. law-abiding citizens. It's like they all just snapped. ??? - Hey. - If it's not airborne, what do you think? I don'know. As far as toxins go, around here, my first bet would be cocaine and appletinis. We'll check everything from inside and out. Do our own testing. - I'm on it. - Okay. ??? Nothing glamorous about this. People live for this stuff, huh? Bright lights, red carpets. And I imagine they want to die for it. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:FRM@·ëÎµ Sync:FRS@ÓîÒâ</font> eleventh hour s01ep17 Anything consistent? Nothing yet. The same face powder in the dressing room of that designer's party and in the salon, but not in the red carpet. And we got the same bottled water at both incident sites, but so far, it's tested clean. So proximity is still our only link. Okay. Well, designer clothes and designer drugs are not total strangers. You got anything from the tox reports? Not yet. They're still working on it. Going as fast as they can. Okay, well, let's start with the living. So, buddy, what happened last night? I checked your files. There's nothing bad in there. I don't get it. Me neither. Seriously, you seem like a standup guy. They hired you to stop dudes like you. I blanked. I swear. Something... something... something happened. Yeah, I got that part. What was it about that model? You guys have a little history going on? Rob and I were just walking into the show, and then the next thing you know, this fight broke out. Can I ask you something really personal? Were you dating either of these guys? No, the photographer, I've never even seen him before, and Rob, my agent, was... always really professional. I've always been totally professional. All right, now I tell you something that stays with you and me, all right? 'Cause I think I know what went down because I felt that way before. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I used to be a bouncer at a strip joint. No kidding? Yeah, it was just like you said, always professional. Always about the work. And it just creeps up on you slowly... all that skin. And all of a sudden, one day with no warning, you just snap! That's exactlyhat this was like... from what I remember. I wasn't myself. It's all a blur, but... I just know, me and that girl-- we had a connection. You and that fine model had a connection? Are you on medication? I'm using new stuff all the time: lipsticks, moisturizers, whatever. Companies just send me free stuff. Lucky you. What about food? Did you eat or drink anything different? Champagne on the way over. You know, to take the edge off. Right. I wish I had taken something. I mean, I wish I had that excuse. I didn't want to hurt that girl. God... what have I done? Hey, Rex, hi. Um£¬ I was just calling to say what's up. So, what's up? Oh, and to say again how much fun I had at dinner a couple weeks back. I hope your sudden call wasn't bad news. Um, maybe next time we can catch a movie. Rock on. Oh, I so forgot. This is Gretchen Morris calling. Rock on! Hi. Am I interrupting something? Uh, no, I was just lost in thought. Can I help you? Yes, we're investigating the death of Robert Beltram. We understand he has a partner? He did. Shall we talk in my office? How long were you and Robert Beltran partners? Business? Eight. We were married almost six. Married? We didn't know. I'm sorry. Different last names. And in this business, you don' advertise your personal relationships unless you crave attention. Can I ask was your marriage a happy one? The first couple of years, yes. But then the agency started doing so well, it required so much of our attention. Careful what you wish for, right? One of your models, Hailey Vaughn... Any idea why he would have gotten involved in a fistfight over her? Robert was just being a good agent. He is... was protective of his clients. If they think you don't care, they'll jump ship to someone who does. But dying for them? No. Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask such a mundane question, but, um, was your husband using anything unusual, out of the ordinary? I just mean like different soap or, uh, medition? Was he eating anything unusual? Not that I know of, but, uh, fashion week's a crazy time. We really hadn't seen much of each other lately. We had made plans to get away after the madness was over. What are you thinking? I'm thinking she's hiding something. Well, if you really want to know someone... talk to her assistant. Oh, rats! Hi. Uh, can I help you? Miss Vaughn. I brought you your mail. Thanks, Tim. Tom. Sorry. Tom. I usually just get it myself. Not today. I caught that perfume of yours when you just come in. You smell... incredible. Thanks. Got to go. What are you doing? Maybe you should invite me in. Yeah, no, uh, he was a great boss. The best. And you made all his appointments? I even scheduled his phone calls to his mom. Did he change his behavior in any way? I mean, start going out more, join a gym? Hmm-mm. No. Gretchen. You seem like the kind of girl who really cares. So, why don't you tell us what you've been dying to tell us. If Miss Delgado finds out, it'll break her heart. She's not going to find out. At least, not from us. Robert had a lot of, uh, meetings lately with one client. Late-night meetings. Which client? Hailey Vaughn. The model he was with the night he died. Nobody leaves their door open in New York. Hood. Don't move. She was so beautiful. I don't know why I did it. I don't know. Wait a second. Excuse me. What's that mark? It's on both wrists, actually, and her neck. We should be able to tell you what that is after autopsy. Search turned up no drugs, no paraphernalia. But I did find a couple items that look like they've just been opened. What's that? It's a promotional box of perfume. It says "Touchant" under the name. Touchant's a high-end perfume manufacturer. Rachel, you wear perfume sometimes, don't you? Sometimes. How do you put it on? Uh... like every other girl. Here, here, here. ???? ??? Agency. Rex?! Hi, hi. How are you? You were in Seattle? Really? Wow. God, I'm sorry. Is he feeling better? Good. Yeah... I'm great. Tomorrow night? Yeah. Sure. What time? Okay. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Yes! Smells like Paris in here, doesn't it? Yeah... Definitely. Of course, perfume is one of the most ancient of art forms. The three wise men brought frankincense and myrrh to Jesus. Before that, the Egyptians entombed their pharaohs with aromatics. But it was created to cover bad smells, right? It was also created to ward off things like the plague. Yes, yes... This is one of our chemists. This is Renny Boyle. Uh, yes. But, of course, today, most fragrances are used to flavor foods. 60%, actually. Less than 10% is perfume. But this, of course, is where the true art still lies. And the regulations stop. Excuse me? You don't have to list ingredients on perfume. So, you can put anything you want in there? Pretty much. Recently, they found very high estrogen levels in a body lotion. They had to take it off the market because it was causing cancer. Yes, yes, but here, we use only the purest of ingredients. Now, for example, our newest fragrance has over 650 different ingredients and very few of them are synthetic. That would be, uh, "Fervor." Yes. Where did you get that? That's the promotional package that went out to all of Scent 100. Scent 100? Uh, yes, I'm sorry. It's a list of 100 of the fashion industry's most elite. We sent out a very limited release of the fragrance. It, uh, creates anticipation. So, um, Hailey Vaughn would have been on the list. Yes, that's right, yeah. She was one of very few, just a handful omodels on that list. Very lucky girl. Hailey Vaughn is dead, sir. I see. Well, then, I think that you better speak to our attorney. There's nothing dangerous about our perfume. Oh, well, maybe not to the person that wears it. But what about the person that smells it? We'll also need the list of 100 people, so we can recall the boxes as a safety measure. Seems a little premature at this point. We don't want to cause unnecessary panic. Are you worried about the public or your company's bottom line? We can get a court order if we need to. I am pretty sure you don't have enough for that. I am absolutely certain that this is an unfortunate misunderstanding. I am the primary nose here at Touchant. No ingredient goes into one of our perfumes without my knowledge. Okay, it's taken me two years. It's taken me hundreds of clinical tests to perfect this scent. Good. Then you won't mind one more test. Fine. I will have Renny draw up a sample of Fervor. Is that it? Almost. If we do find anything dangerous in the sample, your company will be our primary suspect. Thanks for your help. Kristopher. If there is anything to this, you will take the fall and you will take it alone. Hey, Agent Young's at the coroner's office. Extra pair of hands. Felix, could you do me a favor? Could you please write down a couple of things for me on the board, - Sure. -if you don't mind? Thanks. Uh-huh. Okay. Vanilla. - Vanilla. - Um... Honeysuckle. Jalapeño pepper. It's a perfume recipe. Civet musk... What's that? Civet? It's kind of, um, half cat, half fox. And they use the musk in perfume to make, uh, make it evaporate slower. Makes the odor last longer. You know, they also use beaver glands and whale fat in perfume, too. Not so much. Not anymore. I mean, aside from the whole endangered species thing, there's a fear that if the animals is diseased, it could carry on in humans. So, technically, if diseased oil is in the perfume, that could cause people to go nuts. I mean, that's what I'm thinking, yeah. I'll run another test for contaminants while we, uh, break down the rest of the perfume's ingredients. - How many more we got? - Uh, 650-something. I should write these smaller. You wanted to see me? Yes, Renny. The police that were here earlier, do you have any idea why? They weren't police. They were FBI. And they have a crazy idea that our perfume is making people violent. Which is completely unfounded, right? Right? All the proper tests have been run, haven't they? I have done everything you have asked me to do. I always have. Then there's nothing to worry about, is there? If you say so, sir. May I go back to work now? Yes. It's open. Good evening. Evening. Sit on the bed, please. I'd like you to indulge me. That's what I'm here for. Put on that perfume, please. Not bad. I'm glad you like it. All right, let's begin. Final autopsy reports. Found the same skin pigmentation marks on Hailey and the runway model. It all points to the perfume being the common denominator. What are you thinking, Hood? He's using pheromones. Pheromones-- that's what gives people the hots for each other, right? Well, yeah. Only a select few. I mean, pheromones, they use gene typing, which is like blood typing, which means only certain pheromones attract certain people. Whoa, whoa, whoa. So I might dig somebody and you might not based on the way they smell? Then there actually is something to chemistry between people. Well, that would explain why only certain people are becoming violent. Okay. But it's more than that. He's got to be using it in conjunction with something else. We just don't know what yet. I know you want me. I'm only here for you. Quiet, please. Quiet. Trying to concentrate. Okay. I have another appointment, and, um, this is getting all too weird. Sit down. Sit. Sit down. - Sit! - No! - Get off! - You are not... - Get off me. - going anywhere. We'll get the book after they tag it. Meantime, they can run ballistics on the bullet. Looks like she carried the gun in her purse. ??? Weapon was a.22. What's her name? Lyla. Thank you. Lyla? Hi, my name's Jacob. Jacob Hood. I'm not a cop. I'm a scientist. And, um... I think I know what happened. Listen, I know that he attacked you first. Can I ask you a question, please? Did he make you wear perfume? Yes. Can you show me, do you have marks on your wrists? Okay. He was gonna kill me. I didn't know what else to do. I understand. He was just sitting there, writing all this stuff in a notebook. And then... Why did he do this to me? He was conducting an experiment, and it went out of hand. So I was some kind of guinea pig? No, he was. So what is this? Um, this is something I found in the perfume in the hotel room-- the real perfume. All right, bring on the fancy science, Doc. I can handle it. It's a neurotransmitter molecule. Little less fancy. It's like a, um, instant messenger for the brain. There's about 300 of them. And they tell us, uh, what to think and feel and how to act. We only really know what about half of them do. And what do we think this one does? Well, we think this one makes people crazy. Okay. Well, why wasn't this one in the sample that Merced gave us? Because the perfume Merced created was clean. Do we think that someone else put it in the promotional packages? That's what I'm getting from his notes. After we visited him, he was worried there was something wrong with his masterpiece, so he decided to test it himself. The hooker? That's right. Merced was innocent. So who put the hots in the perfume? We did a patent search on the base elements of your Fervor perfume. It turns out, there was a patent challenge. Your chemist Renny Boyle claims to have invented it in his own time. Renny's the lab tech who gave you the sample. - The clean sample? - More like a cleaned-up sample. Think it was fake. Then he's liable for the violence. - It's looking that way. - But why? It doesn't make sense. This is a multimillion-dollar company, isn't it? $50 million a year, actually. Well, we need to talk with Renny, find out how he came up with the formula, if we want to contain it. He's not here; he called in sick. His computer's been wiped completely clean. I'll put out an APB on Renny. The marks. The marks on the skin-- that must be the key. Do you run clinical trials here? Yes. We have a whole line of cosmetics. That's what we need to look at right now. Here's the rest of the results from the self-tanning lotion trials, but the formula is missing. Okay, okay. How do you effect a color change, a pigmentation change in the skin? One way, the simple way, is a colorless sugar interacts withthe dead skin cells. But you could... you could go directly through the brain. Affect the neurons in the body that tell the skin to get darker. Like the neurotransmitter you were talking about. Exactly. So this is some kind of side effect from a self-tanning lotion Touchant was developing? Could be. According to this subject, "Great tan. But I felt energetic and aroused." "This isn't suntan lotion. It's ber-love potion." Well... okay. Well, my guess is he discovered it by accident, but mixed it up with pheromones deliberately. That would increase the effect of both of them, lower the inhibitions, increase the sex drive. Which then lead to violent urges. You know what I think? This could have been marketed as the world's first scientifically-proven aphrodisiac if it hadn't been for the violent side effect. We need to round up the rest of the perfume boxes right away. I need those 100 names. Yeah, NYPD's going house-to-house and person-to-person going through that Scent 100 list. We got almost all the boxes accounted for. Soon as I'm done here, I'm jumping on the task force that's tracking down Renny Boyle. That's good work, Felix. Thank you. Listen, you do something else for me? I want you to get through to the New York CBRNE, and ask them to get access to as much cerulenin as possible. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Serena Williams? What? Cerulenin. It's an FAS inhibitor. It'll block the melanocortin receptors of the perfume. An antidote? Just in case, okay? I appreciate you coming here yourselves. - Red box, right? - That's right. I haven't been through my mail, but I think I saw my assistant with it this morning. It should be at Gretchen's desk. The mail's here. Not the perfume? I don't know where it could be. I'll need your assistant's phone number. She's not answering. Aren't you going to answer it? No. I don't recognize the number. Usually someone trying to sell you something you don't need. I know exactly what you mean. These people-- they never give up. So, uh... 21's a fancy club, huh? You have a big date, huh? Sort of. A pretty girl like you-- I bet you have a lot of dates. Oh, well, that's nice of you to say, but, um... it's kind of personal. Come on. I bet your voicemail's overflowing with guys just dying to get close to you, huh? Can you just drive, please? For you, anything. Where are you going? Um, the restaurant's not this way. Don't worry. Don't worry. I know a shortcut. Pull over. Will you pull over, please? By the way... ??? Come on. Come on. She's still not answering. ???? What are we looking for exactly? Renny calling a taxi. Renny buying a plane ticket online. Anything that tells us where he is. He just came in this office, didn't he? What is he doing? Can you find that footage? Right there. Freeze that. What is that? What's he got there? - "You have been cordially invited..." - It's an invitation... to tonight's fashion show. - Agent Young? - Yes. Officer, do you have what we need to track Gretchen Morris? Portable GPS is set up. We have her number. It's Felix. Hey. Yes, so I'm headed to the Dior show. I think Renny's got a grand finale planned for fashion week. Did you call for backup? Yeah, meet me there. You find Gretchen? Working on it. Her signal's stationary. Just a few blocks from here. The, uh, designer wanted me to tell you that you should be wearing this. What is it? It's called Fervor by Touchant. - May I? - Yeah. It's going to be the season's hottest fragrance. Mm, I like it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Wait till you see the reaction on the crowd when they smell it. It's going to be like nothing in this world. No cab driver. No Gretchen. Her phone's here, but she's not. Now how do we find Gretchen? Dogs. Dogs can track the scent. Officer, call for a K-9 unit. Please... please don't hurt me. I would never hurt you. Shh. Why would I hurt you? You smell so good. Shh. It's okay. Gretchen! ??? ??? Gretchen! Gretchen! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. ??? What are you doing? She's mine. Felix. We found Gretchen. Yeah, that's great news. We still haven't found Renny yet. Man, this place is packed. Hey, Doc, some of these people are acting real strange. I think the models are wearing the perfume! Do you have the antidote? - Yeah, yeah, I got it. - I'll be right there. ???? ??? ???? FBI. Get down! Get down on your knees now! Nine years I have given my life to Touchant without even so much as a parking space. I created Fervor. It should be mine. Cuff him. You just try and stop it. Dr. Hood, should we evacuate this place? It's too late. We have to somehow get the antidote into the atmosphere. What's wrong with everyone? Excuse me. Do you know the source of these smoke jets? - Around back. - Thank you. Okay, pour it in. - A lot? - All of it.???? Okay, Okay. Okay, turn it on full blast. It's working, Felix. I don't know about you, Doc. I think I'm going to give up on the cologne for a while. Is that what you call that stuff you wear? Hey, my mama gives me that every birthday. That's very nice of her. So what do you think? It's New York City. Agent Young's 20 blocks away. - Cab it? Subway? - Let's walk. We could do with the fresh air. I hear that. He's not answering. I don't blame him. I've been stood up a few times. It's not a nice feeling. What's his name? Rex. Can you dial his number again? ??? Hi, Rex. This is Special Agent Young of the FBI. The girl you were meeting tonight-- Gretchen, she's been helping us with a case. She'll tell you all about it when you call her. Who knows? Maybe that will do the trick. I don't know. I'm starting to think there's no such thing as chemistry. Well... I know for a fact there is.
