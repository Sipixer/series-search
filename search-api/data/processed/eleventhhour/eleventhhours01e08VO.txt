Help! Thanks, Uncle Jacob! That's okay. Ah. You've had this since we were kids. Remember that? You practically slept with it. Yo, birthday boy. Come here. Oh! I got something for you. What could that be? Wow! Thanks. Do you want to go play? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on. What? So,Jake, speaking of chemistry. You and the lovely Rachel? Strictly professional. Well, of course she is. Ooh! Look, all I'm saying is that is he is dragging you around by those shiny big handcuffs, well, at least tn, I would understand why you took the job. You know, some people might think that special science advisor to the FBI is a kind of cool job. You're my big brother. You're cool no matter who you work for, even if it is the man. What you doing, Uncle Jacob? I was wondering. What do you think happens if I put this into that? Shall we see? -No. -Oh, go on. Wow! Awesome! How'd that happen? Well, I'm not really sure, but I think you might find the answer... on page 29. Sorry, guys, but we've got to go. No. Why? A Tulsa State College student just died of the bends. The bends? Second this month. In Oklahoma? Thought only scuba divers got the bends. That's right. And Oklahoma's 500 miles from the nearest ocean, so I guess they weren't scuba diving. It gets better. One of the victims couldn't even swim. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:FRM@·ëÎµ Sync:FRS@wdysai</font> ELEVENTH HOUR S01E08 Tulsa International Airport TULSA, OKLAHOMA Here's our latest victim: Tara Bingham. She died a few hours after getting off this plane. You see this, Rachel? It's nitrogen in her heart and lungs and liver. It's caused by rapid decompression. It's, uh... It's basically... It's bubbles. It's like this, uh, ginger ale. You think this is a fizzy drink, right? - Mm-hmm. - Right now, there's no bubbles in it. Why? 'Cause the top is keeping the ginger ale under pressure. The gas is dissolved in the liquid. All you need is a sudden drop in pressure. And you get the bends. Nice work. Sorry I made a bit of a mess there. Excuse me? Were you the attendant on this flight? - Yes. - Oh. Can you tell me did anyone complain about pressure on their, um, ears or head? No. There's something she's not telling us. O2, go! ??? See, if there had been rapid decompression, that would have happened... but it didn't. So I don't think the plane's our suspect. Okay, back to square one. So we'll have to start with Tara Bingham. a victim from the plane. She has a sister who also goes to Tulsa State College. Mm? Maybe we can get some details from her. Told you. Is there something you want to tell us? Right before her seizure, she was in the galley with a guy. They were... Making a sandwich? What? Joining the Mile High Club. Who was the guy? In the gospel group. 21C. Wade Earlham. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mile High Club. Do they really use that expression? Don't knock it till you tried it, Rachel. But it's actually six miles, not one. Way to go, Hood. I'm impressed. Special Agent Young, Dr. Hood, I'm Blake Miller, Tulsa State College's Head of Security. And a former FBI agent. I've read your file. Why the change of career? Uh, less stress, more stability. Besides, I-I used to play football here. I found out that the first victim, Tom Cassidy, stayed on campus during the break and moved into a new apartment. That's about it. He didn't go anywhere or do anything that would cause a pressure change. We'd like to talk to Tara Bingham's sister, Vivian, and to Wade Earlham. Yeah, they're probably over at Tara's memorial. ??? Right here. ?? - Hello. - Hi. This is Dr. Hood. I'm Special Agent Rachel Young. Very sorry about what happened to your sister. Looks like a lot of people loved her. Loving Tara wasn't difficult. She was always fun, you know? A happy person. We just want to know what happened to Tara. We're trying to piece together the days before she died. We know she was at the choir competition in Reno with her boyfriend, Wade Earlham. Actually, we were hoping he might be here. No. Um, Wade hasn't left his dorm room since Tara... Thank you. We spent the whole time in Reno just studying. She had her psych paper, and I prepped for my calculus final. But we even pulled two all-nighters. Dragged our tired butts to the rehearsals and the concert. I'm Phi Beta Kappa. And she was... Um, she was on track to be in next year for sure. Well, you definitely get a 4.0 in lying. I... I-I don't know what you're talking about. Zolpidem. Prescription's in your name. You filled it last week. There should be 30 pills. I count ten. And people abusing sleeping pills are usually trying to come down 'cause they're wired on some other drug. Look, Tara and I were in love. I mean... But doing drugs, having sex on airplanes. That doesn't really go with the whole Phi Beta Kappa, choir thing. You know about that? Now, Wade, we need to find out what happened to Tara before it happens to someone else. If you cared about her like you said you did, then you'd help us. I... Oh, s... Sorry. Bought 'em in Reno. The guy said that they're brand-new, just synthesized. And he told me that they made sex incredible. Yeah, but probably not worth dying for. I don't recognize this symbol. He called it Pearl. Do you think that those pills killed Tara? Well, if they did-- and that's still an "if"-- then, you'll be in danger, too. Need to get you under medical supervision. Can we get him to the college clinic, please? ??? We need to get to the morgue immediately. Why? Well, I don't think bubbles hang around long in corpses. Bubbles in bodies are always nitrogen. What you're proposing is medically impossible. Not impossible. Unprecedented. Now, Wade said that Pearl made sex incredible. And you think it made an excess of nitric oxide in the blood? And nitric oxide is...? Uh, it's the body's natural chemical signal, and, uh, opens up the arteries and floods the tissues with blood. I'll be damned. The bubbles in Tara Bingham are nitric oxide. ??? Producing so much nitric oxide, it overwhelmed Tara's blood. Making bubbles, which became the bends. Just like the ginger ale, but without the pressure change. Exactly. Well, we have a new recreational drug, and it's a killer. Let's find out what it's made of. You play like a six-year-old. If I dedicated one tenth as much time to this game as you do, I'd kick your sorry ass. You know what? I'm going out for a run. Yeah, if I dedicated one tenth the amount of time that you spend working out, then I'd whoop your sorry ass. Then tag along. Man, for real. When was the last time you broke a sweat, man, since you grew hair on your little chest? Hey, well, look, I prefer brain sweat. All right, that's it. You're coming with me, or this Xbox goes to charity. Hey, it's just two miles, if you can handle it. - Can you handle it? - Yeah, I can handle it. - Can you handle it? - I can handle it! All right, you know, screw that. Let's do... ten miles. Nah, man, we got team film to watch tonight. Texas runs this spread offense. It's super-hard to read, so I got to study up on it. Not worried about that. But I do smell... Smell that? Ooh! Smells like cotton candy or something. - It's the...The Cotton Bowl, baby! - The Cotton Bowl, baby! First time in Tulsa history. - Yes, baby! Aah! - Are you ready? Come on. I'm-I'm all ready. Right on, man. You're doing great. I got to get back, though. No, no. One more lap. Whoever loses does laundry for a month. Isaac. Come on, man. You all right? Isaac. Hey, what's wrong? Help! Isaac. Stay with me. Come on, come on. Help! Help! ??? ?? ??? Come on. Let's get him stable. Easy, easy. Now, push two more migs Lorazepam. ??? ?? ??? ??? Get him into a pressure chamber! What are you doing here? FBI. We were notified you have a patient with bends-like seizures. Get him into a pressure chamber. Hopefully, we'll shrink the bubbles and we can stop his seizures. This is a land-locked state. We don't have a pressure chamber. ??? This is Special Agent Rachel Young. I need to find a decompression chamber ASAP. No, Florida is too far. Look into Texas: Galveston, Port Arthur. Get it here now. ?? ??? Pressure stopped the seires. Well, I wish it were that simple. We've ruled out pressure change as a cause. This is just a temporary solution. If Isaac's body keeps on making bubbles, we're gonna have to keep on lowering the pressure. There's only so low we can go before the pressure kills him. So, how do we stop Pearl from churning out nitric oxide? We don't. Pearl isn't our problem. Just got the chem analysis back. Uh... crystalline solid disaccharide? It's table sugar. Pearl is a total fake. Common narcotics scam. Right. Dealer seeks out a na ve mark like Wade, takes his money, leaves him with a dud. Well, the clinic's releasing him. At least he's out of danger. Yeah. That leaves us at zero. The victims have to have something more in common. Studying. Xbox, sleeping and more Xbox. Isaac's sort of been in that routine since our folks died. What happened? Drunk driver. He walked away without a scratch. Dr. Hood... Isaac is all I've got, so I need you to be straight with me. What's gonna happen to him? Well, Isaac's suffering from somethinge've never seen before, so I honestly can't tell you, but we are doing everything we can to find out what it is. Other than the run you took, had he changed his routine in any way? No. Let's go. Go ahead, Lawrence. Right there. He can hear you. Just talk. Hey, bro. Shouldn't you be at practice? Come on, with you in there like that? What kind of brother you think I am? Isaac... It's not your fault, bro. Or maybe it is. Maybe you owe me front row seats at the Cotton Bowl. Lawrence, go play. Mom and Dad would have wanted you to. Yeah. Take care of him. We'll do everything we can. So, Lawrence Richmond is a big football star. So it would seem. You play any sports in college? Um... throwing the occasional Frisbee count as a sport? It's kind of a sport, I guess. Yeah, well, my dad didn't think so. He was a high school football coach, so, naturally, he wanted a jock and wound up with me. Well, we have that in common. Really, how so? My dad wanted a son to follow in his legendary FBI agent footsteps, and instead, he got me. So, anything you need, we'll have it brought in. Oh, and the, uh, Coast Guard guys hooked us up with this. Thanks, Agent Miller. Blake. Right, Blake. Hood? What are you thinking? Hi, um... I was thinking, uh, there's another connection here. Tara collapsed after... sex. Isaac Richmond after jogging. And Tom Cassidy collapsed moving heavy furniture into an apartment. That's it-- physical exertion? But that doesn't cause nitric oxide bubbles, does it? No, but maybe the physical exertion triggered what did cause the bubbles. I thought exercise was supposed to be good for you. Yeah, but exercise can sometimes worsen a viral infection. Do you mind if I, uh... Yeah. Right here. Thank you. Um, Isaac? Uh, yeah, it's, uh, Jacob Hood. Yeah. I want to ask you a question. Have you had a cold recently? No. I've been fine. I got a flu shot and everything. All three victims got flu shots. So, you think this flu shot vaccine was mutated to make nitric oxide? Crazy amounts of nitric oxide. Here's what we have left over. Thank you. Um, I got to ask you. What you're talking about... that's a theory, right? You sound like the administration. Worried about liability, too? Of course not. It's just, we gave out over 4,000 of these flu shots. We'll need all those records. Coach says take it easy, all right? Rest up for the big game. How's the knee? It's still bugging me. Yeah... so let me help. Little shot of cortisone might help that. Nah, man, I'm good. Yeah, why leave it to chance? Hear there's a couple pro scouts coming to this game. All right. You're right, man. Lawrence... you know you're single-handedly lifting TSC out of the second tier, right? Cotton Bowl. ?? Here you go. Just make sure you don't forget about us when you go pro. All right? ??? What are you doing, man? You crazy coming anywhere near here? Well, look, Ellis... we got to delay phase two. What are you talking about? I thought you said we were good to go. New and improved, you said. You, uh... you didn't start, did you? You let me worry about that. Hey, why do you want to delay? The FBI's on campus, Ellis. They're asking questions. Smart questions. We dropped Isaac down to 300 feet because the seizurescame back... just like you predicted. It's not a time I want to be right. They're all normal. Whatever's causing the bubbles, it's definitely not the flu vaccine. But something's making enough nitric oxide to kill them. Rachel, Dr. Hood. Dr. Cogan asked me to give you this virology report on 3 victims' blood. Thanks. It is a virus. It's just not the flu. There's not even a trace of actual flu vaccine in tara's blood work. Meaning someone switched the flu vaccine with...something else? Pretty big mistake. Unless it wasn't a mistake. You're saying this was intentional? I'm saying it was murder. Thanks for letting us access your genetics lab, Dr. Ruscillo. What exactly are we looking at here? Bioterrorism? Well, we don't know yet, but, um, two students are dead; one's fighting for his life as we speak, so we have to decode this DNA. And we need on everyone who administered flu shots. You're reading my mind. Okay. Better bring me up to speed here, Dr. Hood. Healthy students get injected with that. It's dormant for a couple of weeks; then the student exercises. All of a sudden, there's enough nitric oxide in their blood to kill them. Are you familiar with gene therapy? Yeah, take DNA, piggyback it onto a virus. Catch a cold, cure a genetic problem. Didn't they do it with, uh, hemophiliacs, give them the gene that clots blood? Exactly. This is the virus for gene therapies targeted at muscles. Yeah, that's all the student volunteers who administered flu shots. Clean files on all of them. Four of them took genetics courses, but that's no big thing since they worked in student health. We'll question them all in the morning, starting with those four. Yeah. - Tougdetail? - Mmm. Fascinating detail. I mean, - Hood is... - Very smart. Yes. Very smart. But, you know, you're not so bad yourself. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. Creative. Intuitive. Pretty. I knew you were going to say that. You did? Intuitive. Yeah. Nice. No, I was, I was talking about the... the detail, you know? The grind. The road. The endless hotel beds and, you know, rental cars. Mmm. It's all a blur. No, it's... it's hard when I get back to my real life. You know? Yeah. I hear you. I mean, uh, no, that's, that's what ended my marriage. Part of the reason why I wound up here. How are we supposed to have relationships in this job? Well, I guess you, you take what you can get and be thankful. That makes us sound despere. Not me. I'm a civilian now. I, I have a, a car. - Oh, right. - And an apartment. Your own bed. Yeah. It's nice. Must be nice. Text message from Hood. Yeah. I can't bear this. Much lower, the pressure's going to kill him. If only there was some way to take the DNA out. Adding genes is the new biomedical revolution. Removing them we just don't know how to do yet. Yeah, I know. - Hey. - Hey. Did you identify your carbonating DNA? We did. It's two genes. One gene makes nitric oxide... The other one acts like a control knob, turning on the nitric oxide in response to lactic acid. That's what you get when you exercise, right? Exactly. I think this is a gene dope giving athlete and improve them. But with this gene-doping, there was a design flaw, which made it deadly. Caused when the virus migrated. If you get a flu in your nose, it's a cold. Get in your lungs, it's pneumonia. This gene took a detour and ended up in the arteries. Should have been in the muscles. Making superior athletes. Like a steroid. Better than that. See, the thing with gene-doping as opposed to steroids, it should be undetectable. Those athletes out there-- they want to transform themselves into Greek gods. Having something like this in your muscles, like having an extra pair of legs. Wait. Am I crazy? Or was one of our four flu shot volunteers a sports medicine major? Do you remember this guy? Dylan Petraneck. The guy who had access to the flu shots at the medical center. But it doesn't make sense. None of the ctims were athletes. Why dope them? How you holding up, Viv? Okay, I guess. I just... I just miss sister is all. I know. Listen, Viv. There's something I got to tell you. Life at 800 feet underwater-- not so bad. I think I'm going to enlist on a Navy submarine when I get out of here. You will get out. Isaac, you do know that, right? Absolutely. I'm just glad I'm me in here and not my brother. Neither of you should be in there. I know, but... my brother's talented-- special. I checked you out. You're an American Engineering Club scholar. Most people here don't even know what that is. Well, they should. It's pretty impressive. What, maybe 20 students in the country get that scholarship? Twelve. Exactly. They go on to make buildings tall and bridges safe. And may not be as glamorous as other jobs, but doesn't mean it's less important. Thanks. How you holding up? Not so good. I'll-I'll be better tomorrow though. I'll have someone roll up a TV to this porthole so we can watch my brother kick ass on that field. Isaac... hang in there, okay? Dylan Petraneck. FBI. Open up! Petraneck! Blake. Check this out. Lawrence Richmond-- Isaac's brother. Vivian Bingham-- Tara's sister. Andrew Cassidy... brother of the first victim. Son of a bitch. I'm going to call Hood. Yeah? Hood. All of the victims have siblings who are athletes. Similar genetics, similar results. They're guinea pigs. Dylan's testing his gene-dope? Right, on someone more disposable to them than an hlete. A regular student, no one notices if something goes wrong. But a star athlete, under constant scrutiny, that's a different matter. Siblings have the closest blood relations. Makes sense. I'll call you back. Get this, Our victims were test subjects for Dylan's deadly gene-dope. Unwitting test subjects. Isaac thinks he got a flu shot. But did the athletes know? Well, at least one of them did. Take a look at that. "Olympic Diver's Dreams Die in Steroid Scandal." Tara's sister, Vivian. Already busted for doping. Along comes the promise of an undetectable gene-dope? Irresistible. She greenlights the test on Tara. And ends up sacrificing her in the process. You! You told me it was harmless! Dylan said it was! We had to make sure it didn't show up on any tests before we gave it to you! But it killed her, Ellis. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Those FBI people need to know this. because I've got to tell them. No, you are not telling anybody, okay. You made a choice, Vivian! You did! You jumped at our offer. Confirmed that it's undetectable, so that you could keep doping without risking your scholarship, your Olympic bid. You told it would be safe! I thought it would be! Okay! Honestly, Viv, if I could give you your gene-dope and your scholarship and your sister and an Olympic gold medal all without any risk, I would. But I'm not a miracle worker. And if you go squealing-- your scholarship is the least of our problems. If I had thought that there would be any risk... It's not like I wanted her to die either. Okay? We'll get through this. Together. i'm worring the press under 900 feet under the water, Agent Young??. it's close 2 maximum.??? it was a gene-dope that killed my sister Tara. ??? viv come on, i did this for you. Ellis brockton and dylan petraneck are the ringleader. Un-send. and delete. I had a feeling she knew what happened to her sister. And this confirms it. Yeah, I think you're right. This isn't grief. This is guilt. This is screwed up, Ellis. Viv's dead. Uh, the feds searched my apartment. - Now they're looking for me. - Relax. Okay? Listen to me. We'll say that Viv planted the stuff in your apartment. I'll hack her e-mail again, send out a new and improved suicide note. She can take credit for all this. We play this right, it'll all look like athletes testing their siblings with gene-dope they want for themselves. Nobody'll know where they got it. We can regroup, improve the product, and try it somewhere else. All right? You, you really think this will work? You think Viv's way is a better option? - Huh? - No. Teams win all the time on Hail Marys, Dylan. This is our Hail Mary. Is he going to die? I don't know, Lawrence. I'm working with the school's top geneticist to undo what's been done to him. How much do you want to win this season, Lawrence? Enough to take a performance- enhancing drug regimen? What are you talking about? An undetectable gene-dope. Maybe you agreed to test it on your brother. Maybe you thought it wouldn't hurt him. Football's all you got, isn't it? You win, everything changes for the better. Stop winning, you're just another college jock who doesn't quite have what it takes to go pro. You're wrong. Isaac is all I got. Yeah, all right. We just picked up Petraneck at a bus station. He was trying to sneak out of town. No, I don't... I don't know what that is. Even though we found it at your apartment? Someone must have planted it in my apartment. I'll tell you what. Why don't we try it out on you - and we'll find out exactly what it does, huh? - No. No! All right, all right. - You sure? - All right. Some of the jocks-- they wanted me to test the gene-dope on their brothers and sisters so they wouldn't get caught if it didn't work. Including Lawrence Richmond? Then why'd you test it on his brother Isaac? Lawrence was our meal ticket. The closest thing to a superstar TSC's got. If I could bring it to him fully tested, if my dope made him into one of the very best, there'd be no limit. Next stop: other co pros even. And no limit to how much money you would have made either. It wasn't just about the money. It's about science. I'm a scientist. But your gene-dope didn't work, did it, Dylan? Three people are dead because of it, and Isaac Richmond is dying as we speak. We never, uh, wanted anyone to get hurt. We? Who's "we," Dylan? Or would you rather just sit in a cell alone? It's up to you. Sit in a cell. Sit in a cell. That's it. Dr. Ruscillo, couldn't we... make a new gene that would sit in the...artery cells and trick the control-knob gene into thinking the lactic acid was low? And stops the gene-dope from producing nitric oxide. I don't see why not. It's just... - adding a gene. - Mm-hmm. All right, Dylan. I'm gonna ask you one last time. Who's "we"? He's the only one who ever believed in me, believed in my work. Give me a name. Ellis stop! FBI! Ellis Brockton, you are under arrest. Are you sure about this? Don't have time to be sure. put in the oxygene it would take him 5 mins to equalize the chambers. I've got him at a thousand fe, Dr. Hood, 'cause right now that's the only way we can keep him alive. But a healthy person should not be doing this. I'm well aware of the risks, Officer. Thank you. When I've got you down to depth, you can twist that lever and go to the next chamber. Just get me down there quickly, please. Lawrence. You can't play. What are you talking about? Listen to me. Listen to me! You've been injected with the same thing Isaac has. Ellis Brockton confessed that he gave you a shot of cortisone. - Yeah... - But it wasn't cortisone. What? They tested it on your brother first to see what would happen to you. Now... if u have a seizure out there we might not have time to get you to a pressure chamber. You could die. Or I could make it. Man, y'all, y'all dot understand. I feel strong, man. Man, this game is my future, man! No, you don't understand. All right, you go out on that field, you may not have a future. - Rachel? - HOOD. You with Lawrence? Yeah, yeah.We got him. Who is this? Lawrence, It's me, bro. I'm better. I'm better. I'm coming to see you, bro. Yeah, man, I'm... I'm coming. They're doing well. Oh, they're doing awesome, especially Lawrence. Thanks to you, he should be able to keep playing football. Well... if you ever have any other weird scientific crimes happen around here... you know who to call. Hmm, yeah, well, you know, I'll see if I can arrange something "weird" with the physics department then. Yeah... yeah. All right.
