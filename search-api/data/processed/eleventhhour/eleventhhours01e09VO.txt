i got??? Yo! Spring break date, gentlemen! Greg. Lenny. Are you okay? Are you all right? Somebody call 911! Dude... Oh, my God. Are you okay? Is he gonna be all right? ARE YOU OKAY? What happened? Lenny.Lenny. Hate this time of year. Yeah, spring break sucks. ? Damn it. V-fib. Got it. 200 ?? Charging 200. Clear. nothing ? Charging 250. Clear. still nothing Mine's a V-fib, too. here we go again. Charging 200. Clear. ? Time to call it. Subject number two is Leonard Reese. Male, Caucasian, five-foot-11. No significant birthmarks or moles. Subject has a tattoo over his left shoulder blade. In the form of a dagger piercing a pair of cherries. Tasteful. I'll now begin the internal examination. Where the hell am I? Greg?! Greg! Oh! We need some help in here! What did y do to us?! Can I get some help in here?! What did you do?! PALO ALTO,CALIFORNIA Tanner still misses you. Yeah, well, the feeling's mutual. But, mm, it wouldn't have been right to hold onto him after my job change. I'm never at home. And he needs his exercise. Don't you, boy? Hey, the last time you were in town, someone from the Congressional Science and Technology Committee asked you out on a little date. You know, didn't feel right. You know, it's been two years since Maggie died. Don't you think it's time to move on? Anna, I'm here as a friend. I'm not one of your psychiatric patients, okay? I know. And I'm asking out of concern, as a friend. Come on, boy! If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. But, uh, how else... How else can I, uh, deal with my grief? I am dealing with it. I am. I'm just dealing with it in my own way. And that doesn't involve a lot of crying on people's shoulders and analyzing feelings. Okay? What does it involve? Hood. What happened to the weekend off? Cut short. Some college kids in Daytona Beach died of mysterious causes, then came back to life. Excuse us. What does it involve? It involves this. -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- µÚÊ®Ò»Ð¡Ê± µÚÒ»¼¾ µÚ9¼¯ -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é==- Ê±¼äÖá£º¼Ó·¹µÄ²ËÖí</font> Audrey Simone, internal medicine. So you're the FBI's go-to guy for when the dead come back to life? Well, not exactly, but they, uh, come to me with a variety of problems. Well, I can't wait to hear you explain this. Lenny Reese, age 21. He spontaneously recovered from his apparent death 12 hours ago. We've never seen anything like it. Please, get me out of here. Lenny... I'm serious, man. I woke up in a room full of dead peoe. I saw one of my best friends cut open while his heart was still beating. Greg McCarthy? Yes. Uh, now, w-whatever I need to do to get out of here... You need to tell me what you were doing yesterday. Well, um, we had just finished up midterms at Maryland State, and a bunch of us came down here to de-stress a little, you know? Drink some beers, hook up with some hotties. Just party, man. What did you and Greg do in common the past 24 hours? The only thing that Greg and I shared in the past 24 hours was a runner-up Miss Teen USA. She consented to that? Hell yeah. What's her name? Tabitha, uh, Jackson. I'm not... I'm not sure. Will you excuse us for a second? If the only common thread between the two victims is sex with the same girl, then we're looking at sexually transmitted infection. That instantly slowed their heartbeats down to next to nothing? Well, yeah, it's possible. Could be toxic shock syndrome, which could result from, uh, bacteria passed through intercourse. Could lead to heart and lung failure, even coma. I'll have Dr. Simone check for it. If it was that, what woke him up from the coma? Well, find the girl they slept with, we could find the answer. Hey! The cops said I had to stay here until I talked to you guys. Well, now I talked to you, so I'm-I'm free to go, right? Uh, you're at the center of a public health crisis. We got to check you out, make sure you're okay. I'm fine. Sorry, but we've got to run you through the system, get 100% positive ID. Positive ID? What the hell are you talking about? You know exactly who I am. I'm Leonard Reese. Maybe. Maybe not. Leonard. If that is your real name. We'll check your fingerprints, your DNA, see what they tell us. That's ridiculous. No, that's federal procedure. I need to track down a person of interest: Tabitha Jackson. Oh, my God. No. No. No. No! Tabitha Jackson checked in here two nights ago. This brings back memories. Really? You were something of a party girl? That information is on a need-to-know basis. You know, last week, all my hard work paid off. Aced exams. I just thought I would reward myself. You know, like, blow off some steam. Do you remember what happened? I was so drunk. God, it was so stupid. I can't believe there were two of them. Um... Tabitha... I'm not a police officer-- I'm not really sure how to ask you this, but, um... I need to know something about your sexual history. What? I'm sorry. Um... those two boys... may have contracted a sexually transmitted disease, and we don't know where it's from. But I can count on my hand how many people... that I've had sex with. I'm telling you, I'm not this girl. I'm not this girl. We believe you, okay? We believe you. Okay, I'm gonna take you to the hospital now, okay? Let's go. Do you want us to call your parents? Do we have to? No, we don't have to. I think you should. I think they'd want to know so they can be here for you. I doubt that. Just keep walking, babe. But that's... that's one of them! I know. It's okay. All right. It's okay. You all right, Tabitha? Son of a bitch. He acts like nothing had ever... ever happened. Tabitha! We need a doctor over here, now! Pulse ox tanking! She's asystole! Let's go! Nope. She's got a heartbeat. That's just a residual, sir-- please stand back. No, it's not. I don't think shocking her is gonna help. I already told you, stand back. Dr. Simone! Dr. Simone, please! ? Defibrillation did nothing for Lenny or Greg. This is no different. Clear! Stop. The heartbeat's regular, but impossibly slow-- five beats per minute? That's why the medics thought Greg and Lenny were dead. Five beats a minute? That's, like, one beat every 12 seconds. What's her body temperature? It's only 75. Seventy-five? It's as if she's turned ectothermic. Well, that's not consistent with toxic shock syndrome. It's not consistent with anything else I've ever encountered, either. Any body that's that cold with a heartbeat that slow... that's not a coma. That's suspended animation. Excuse me, can you help us? We're trying to find our daughter. Tabitha Jackson? Oh, uh, I'm Special Agent Young. I'm the one who called you yesterday. Your daughter is stable now. Let me walk you to her room. Yes, please. Thank you. That's great... Yeah. That's... All right, you got to flip him. All right... flip it. Let's see. Oh! All right. Come on, down the hatch. I can't. Yes, you can. come on Drink up, Belinda. Oh... You have to. Oh, I know, I know. Rules are rules. But I thought the rules were... Come on, come on. Less thinking, more drinking. See? It's not that bad, right? Hey, uh, I just got the weirdest message from our boy Lenny saying Greg is dead? All right, I'm not getting punked again by that dude. Remember April Fools? Yeah, you're probably right. Yeah. And hey, you know what, if they want to miss out on this, fine by me. More for us. Absolutely. Boo-yah. I hate playing kings. I love playing you. Only two kings tonight, sweetheart. Lucky for you, we know how to treat a queen. Oh, yeah? Let me show you. Oh, hi, Rachel. You don't mind if I call you Rachel, do you, Agent Young? Good news for both of us, Lenny. You seem to be fine, so you're no longer under Federal supervision. But the nurses say you've been harassing them. So my advice to you is stay out of trouble, or next time you won't be in a hospital bed, you'll be in jail. God, you're beautiful. A woman like you... FBI agent. Bet you've been through a lot, huh? You know, after my brush with death, the things that I've seen, the friend that I lost... It's not a doctor that I need, if you know what I mean. Ow! I don't know what turns me on more-- the fact that you might be diseased or that you got a girl drunk so you and your buddy could gang bang her. You are a bitch! And I'm out of here! Lenny is suffering from something called necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria. Sounds almost as disgusting as it looks. What causes it? Well, actually, it's the same strep A bacteria that causes common diseases like tonsillitis and strep throat. Change of plan? We're going somewhere else. Pet store. Now, little known fact about strep A bacteria. In addition to causing necrotizing fasciitis, it naturally produces hydrogen sufide. Watch this. Uh, Hood... you can wake him up, right? No, I just murdered him. What kind of scientist do you think I am, Rachel? No, at this dosage, all hydrogen sulfide does is induces a state of suspended animation. Just like Lenny and Greg. And now Tabitha Jackson. Mickey's breathing is reduced to just a few breaths a minute. His metabolism slows to a crawl. When normal air is reintroduced... Mickey? Mickey comes back to life. So someone dosed our victims with hydrogen sulfide gas. Not really. I think the strep A bacteria in their bodies somehow directly released hydrogen sulfide into their bloodstream. Suspended animation. That's right. So, you're telling me that if we revive Tabitha Jackson, she'll come down with a case of necrotizing fasciitis. It's quite simple-- think of it as a two-stage process, like a cavity in a tooth. Stage one's just a hole. Without intervention, it proceeds to stage two. When infection sets in, it spreads out until it devours everything. So we need to prevent Tabitha Jackson's case from developing to stage two, keeping her in suspended animation. Yeah. Until we find out what's causing it and we can find out how to stop it. And we do this by prolonging her current state? Well, it doesn't appear to be causing any long-term damage to the body so far. Well, I suppose we could try ice water immersion. We have a few tubs in the back-- we could use one of those. Good. Keep her as cold as possible. Listen-- we're smack in the middle of spring break. If this thing is spread through sexual contact, you better start preparing for a lot more cases just like Tabitha. Belinda! Are you okay? Belinda! You got a condom? Oh, come on, Kayla. You don't need protection from me. Sorry, babe, no condom, no nasty. Lucky you. Wake up, sexy. Hey. Hey. Wake up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Help! Somebody help us! Help! So I'm not gonna get sick? Not from Seth. Thanks to the fact that you were responsible enough to use some protection. Guess my party's over, huh? For now. Screening your calls? Let me guess. The dog sitter? She's a professor of psychiatry, actually. So are you seeing her? No, she was a friend of my wife. I meant as a psychiatrist. No, no, not that either. When are you gonna tell her the dog was just a ruse to spend more time with her? Tanner is not a ruse. Could have fooled me. Wait a second. Several cases of a deadly form of flesh-eating bacteria were reported in Daytona Beach today. The bacteria is believed to spread through sexual contact. To prevent a possible epidemic, the County is prohibiting the service of alcohol after 8:00 P.M., and the 10:00 P.M. curfew is being enforced on all residents of Voluisa County including spring break visitors. I'm glad to see the local health department is complying with our request. But it's not enough. Yeah. We have two more victims in suspended animation, Belinda Shea and Seth Sandel. How are they holding up? Well, we're monitoring their vitals continually. to prevent hypothermia. So far, so good. You got any more tubs? No, we're not equipped to handle this sort of thing. on a large scale. It may be getting larger. Well, what can we do? Our entire infrastructure is built around maintaining a body temperature of 98.6, not 70. With one pretty major exception. What's the coldest place in the building? The temperature at our morgue is kept at a constant 36 degrees at all times. She looks like she's already dead. She's not, Mr. Jackson. This could help keep her alive. If she wakes up now, she's gonna be in terrible danger, but if we can somehow crack the code of the bacteria that made her sick, we should be able to engineer a cure. How long would that take? I wish I knew. Rachel, sit down. I want to show you something. This is the DNA sequence of normal strep A. This is the DNA sequence of the new bacteria. It looks a lot shorter. Yeah, it's a lot simpler, too; it's got less than half the number of base pairs. What does that mean? It's got no junk DNA-- the portions of the DNA that serve no identifiable purpose. Every natural organism has junk DNA. So the bacteria infecting the kids is manmade. Yeah. The good thing about that is, if someone created it, then we'll know how to destroy it. I'm gonna have the hospital geneticist build me a gene map of the bacteria. It's kind of a like a forensic scientist putting together the pieces of an exploded bomb. If we do that... We'll have a shot at tracing it to its creator. Exactly. Any signs of flesh-eating bacteria? No. So far, so good. Wait. What is it? The autopsy photo of our first victim, Greg McCarthy... I remember something. Hood, All the male victims had the same daggers- and-cherries tattoo. I looked into it. It wasn't a fraternity tattoo. It's got nothing to do with Maryland State University or any of its sports teams. The dagger and cherries? When these guys were so proud of taking advantage of young women, maybe one of them crossed the line, got busted. I'm gonna have the National Crime Information Center do a cross-search of all our male victims and sex crimes. What's this? Hot off the press. Gene map of our manmade bacteria. Our bone parts. That's right. Now... every gene here has a purpose, seeing as it was built and designed for a reason. So what have we got? We got... resistance to ultraviolet rays, resistance to radiation, tolerance for oxygen loss, tolerance for... extreme cold. What is it? Space. The suspended animation this bacteria causes could conceivably allow someone to survive long periods in space. Are you saying our bomb was built by NASA? it's not about??? FLORIDA SAPCE CENTER I'm shocked you found Chronos-X-Coli outside these walls. Chronos-X-Coli? It's the name of hydrogen-sulfide-producing bacteria. "X" as in experimental. And "Chronos" as in the Greek god of time. Exactly. Our goal here is to enable astronauts to travel to destinations that would otherwise remain out of reach. Now, we may not see spaceflight utilizing suspended animation in our own lifetimes, but our children will. Well, unfortunately, there's a few college-age children who won't, Dr. West. And it appears to be associated with the work you're doing in this lab. I'm sorry. This is the Space Science Center, not some biological warfare facility in the former Soviet Union. My people don't sell their wares on the black market. And while the bacteria found in your victims does match Chronos-X-Coli, Chronos-X-Coli wasn't designed to cause necrotizing fasciitis, and that's actually what's harming your victims, not suspended animation. There's no record of a break-in or reports of stolen materials in the past three years. That's 'cause, like I said, that kind of thing doesn't happen here. Dr. West, when I was analyzing your Chronos-X-Coli's DNA, there was one gene I couldn't quite work out. It's an apoptotic gene, I think. It's a built-in failsafe; the gene designed to initiate cell suicide. Exactly. Your built-in self-destruct mechanism. Yeah. Well, right now we have innocent victims that are lying in hospital, and there's a possibility that your failsafe could help cure them. Tell us how it works? I wish I could help you, Dr. Hood, I truly do, but I can't. National security regulations make it impossible. The information you're asking for falls under the heading "federal proprietary technology," and I can't share that with you. You understand young people's lives are at risk? Yes, I'm aware of that. I'm also aware that we don't pick and choose where we want the law to apply. It applies all the time or it means nothing. It applies until we get a federal court order that says it doesn't. Hopefully, no one else will be dead by then. We'll see ourselves out. How long's it gonna take to get a court order? If things work out, we could have it by midnight. Let's hope. This is Agent Young. Okay, thanks. Got it. Get this. It turns out Lenny Reese, his buddy Greg McCarthy and our latest victim Seth Sandel were all accused of gang-raping a girl here in Daytona during spring break last year, and they all got off. So maybe it isn't an epidemic. Maybe it's revenge. If that is the case, it's not over yet. There's a fourth suspect accused of the same crime. Rapist or not, we better find him before the killer does. Yeah. The victims include three male students visiting from Maryland State University. We're reporting from Daytona Community Hospital. Back to you. You walking away from me? ha.. yes Hey! He's dead. We'll contact his family, Dr. Hood. Four accused rapists. Lenny and Greg are dead. And one in suspended animation-- Seth Sandel. What do we know about the fourth? His name is Derek Kenin. He attended Maryland State with Lenny, Greg and Seth. Rape charges were thrown out due to lack of evidence. The victim was local? That's right. Julia Taylor, age 19. If anyone wanted revenge it'd be her. Yeah, but I doubt a 19-year-old would have been able to get around the federal wall of proprietary technology or convert Chronos-X-Coli into a biological weapon. Maybe she had help. So Julia Taylor still lives at home. You go through that kind of trauma, you just look for someplace safe. I don't understand. The case was closed. We've reopened it. Two of the four accused are dead. A third is very sick. So you're not here about the rape? You're investigating murder? Two murders, possibly more. Wait a minute. You think Julia had something to do with this? Mrs. Taylor-- Unbelievable. You're treating my daughter as a suspect? Here's your suspect. Why don't you lock her up and throw away the key. I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor. We didn't know. The D.A. said it would just be he said, she said. She took it really hard. Blamed herself. It took so much just to come forward, and then to be labeled a slut and a liar. The doctors gave her a prescription for her depression, but it didn't work. She started drinking instead. One night she drank too much and tried to drive home. Crashed into a divider and never woke up. So you brought her home? This is better for her anyway. To be where she's loved. This is all her stuff? Yes. Would you mind? No. Pure silica fiber. It's light enough for flight, but strong enough for withstanding G-forces. Mrs. Taylor, this is a space shuttle tile. Do you know anyone who works at NASA? My ex-husband. It was a gift from him-- Julia's father Henry. Henry West? Yes. Excuse me. This is Special Agent Young. I need to locate Dr. Henry West. I'm really sorry for any trouble we've caused. I wish you and your daughter well. Thank you. All right, keep me posted. West disappeared. He left the lab and hasn't gone home. That's why he stonewalled us. With his daughter in a coma, I guess it seemed appropriate. Put the rapists in the same state-- then administer a flesh-eating disease to ravagers of the flesh. They didn't get it quite right. Innocent girls are dying. There's no justice in that. Maybe he wasn't aware of the potential for sexual transmission. Or maybe he just didn't care. I have the Bureau tracking the GPS on Derek Kenin's cell phone. Derek's the only rape suspect who hasn't been infected yet. We find him, we find West. No, I can't wait until tomorrow. I need to go home now. Okay, all right, what about a different airline? Well, can't you just do something? I mean-- all right, just listen to me. Just listen to me, okay? Listen to me. No, please, don't put me on hold. Come on! Don't move. Stay back. Stay back. Dr. West... You're too late. It's over. He was the last one. Stay back! My little girl is... gone. My life is just a memory. Everything I've done-- I'm not sorry. Tell me about the fail-safe. How does the organism destroy itself? Tell me. Why? So you can save a bunch of rapists? No. No. No! Dr.West no. Hood. I need two ambulances. 415 River Street. Shark Cove Hotel, now. You infected more than rapists, Henry. The infection spread through sexual contact. Those boys-- they infected at least two innocent girls. Girls just like your daughter Julia. These girls, they had nothing to do with what happened to Julia. They don't deserve to suffer any more than she did. Come on. This can't be what you wanted. What, you need a pen? Here you go. You want to write on my hand? Okay, is that an "A"? "Ag." the periodic table of elements. Ag is the symbol for silver. Is it silver? It's called colloidal silver. Until the 1930s, it was quite a widely used antibiotic. Now it's more commonly known as a dietary supplement. But its value here is as a trigger for the fail-safe gene inside the bacteria. It should cause the bacteria to destroy itself. The only thing is, for the silver to work, um, the blood needs to circulate. So we're going to have to wake them up. But if we wake them up then we wake up the flesh-eating bacteria and then they they die. Isn't that what you told us before? Personally I believe it's worth the risk. Well, it's been 48 hours and there's no sign</i> of the fleshating bacteria on any of the victims, Dr. Hood. Thanks for everything. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Oh, I understand. What I was suggesting did sound a little crazy. I'm just glad your daughter's okay. Will you excuse me? There's something I have to do. Thanks again. PALO ALTO,CALIFORNIA Come on, Tanner. Hey, buddy. Anna? Yeah, it's Jacob. Oh, uh, I was thinking, um... I, uh... I really enjoy our conversations and, um, I kind of regret the-the way the last one ended. Me, too. Want to try again? Great. Well, how about this, um, I'm going to be passing through Stanford sometime soon. Sure, if you got the time. You know, I'd like that, too. Yeah, I got to go. Yeah, no, I got to go. Bye. Professor Yang? Yeah. Good for you. I think so.
