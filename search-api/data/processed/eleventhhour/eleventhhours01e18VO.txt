FBI Deputy Director ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA</i> Forgive me, Dr. Hood. It's my fault we're late. I was just looking to see if I had my speech here. I'm sure you'll do fine. How much of an introduction to you want? The longer you keep talking, the less I have to say. Well, we can work it out in the limo. ??? Thanks for the heads up. I'll let the deputy director know. ??? Ray, where's the presentation tonight? Is it the Chamber of Commerce or the NLEC? ??? - Is my bow tie straight? - Yeah. ???,Because yours is... - Clip-on. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Ray, honey, I'm having a problem here. - Excuse me. - Sure. Hi. Rachel, you okay out there? Just some neighbor reporting a prowler. - I'm coming back in. - Well, hurry up. I'm fresh out of small talk... Hood? - Mom, Dad? - ??? Get back to your room. Who's this?! I'm Jacob Hood. Who are you? - Stay back! - Okay. Nobody touch me! No one's going to touch you. ??? ??? Just tell us what you want. I want my baby back! ??? He's taken my baby! - Who did? - Him! Her name's Sofia Lyons. - She was an agent? - Not an agent. She's a lab tech with the science division. But she's been under the care of the statemental health system for the past six weeks. - So why'd she come after you? - She had a breakdown. Her boyfriend dumped her when she was pregnant. Then she lost the baby. Ray was her boss. Please, all he ever did was want to make sure that she was okay. What's your problem with, uh, Deputy Director Wynne? It's simple. He stole my baby. But then she got this idea that the FBI had stolen her baby and Ray was the father. ??? I can only be sympathetic up to a point. And obviously tonight was past the point. Look, Ray is clever. He's going to tell you lies about me, but everything I've told you is true. She wrote these ridiculous letters - accusing him... - Sweetheart. ...saying he was having her turned into a zombie. You know what I think now? Better a zombie... - than a threat to my family. ??? Honey, I'm...??? Reach inside my pocket. They've been trying to reprogram me, but I ripped it out of my arm this morning. Surgical implant? They're drugging me against my will. I'm fighting to stay sane, but I'm losing the battle. Dr. Hood, please help me find my baby. Sofia, I can't help you. You're just going to have to complete this course and try to make yourself better. But there's nothing wrong with me, damn it! It's okay. - I'm a scientist, Dr. Hood, just like you. - ??? I'll beat the drugs, I'll get out, and when I do... ??? I'm going to make things right. All by myself. Do you hear me? Dr. Hood, remember me. She told the cops that Assistant Director Wynne was her secret lover and that he stole their baby. Yeah, she told me the same thing. I don't know-- erotomania? It can happen. An unstable person can fixate on a high-status individual, convince themselves there's some kind of relationship when there isn't. I know that look. You're on Planet Hood. What's up? This. She tore it out of her own flesh with her bare hands. She's desperate, Rachel. She's very smart, and she believes every word she's saying. It makes her dangerous. Very dangerous. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:FRM@´ó±¦ Sync:FRS@Jingshan</font> ELEVENTH HOUR S01EP18 Attention, residents, ??? Sofia Lyons has been in custody and under observation for a week now. I don't see any threat. Well, that's true. Things definitely aren't adding up as they should. That thing Sofia dug up out of her own flesh, I had it tested. It was definitely a drug delivery device. It's a biodegradable polymer implant that releases regular doses of Olanzapine. It's a very powerful antipsychotic drug. It was developed to, uh... keep noncompliant patients on their meds. But there's a lot of controversy over its use. So she's been a part of a clinical trial. Well, to be part of a clinical trial you need to give informed consent. To give informed consent, you need to already be stable. Which she clearly isn't. ??? Do you think there's any credibility to her story? Ms. Lyons? Dr. Hood. Glad to see you looking so well. Yeah, after the last time you saw me... I'm embarrassed about that. And Agent Young, what can I say? How's your arm? Is that where you, uh... pulled the implant out? It's healing nicely-- like the rest of me. You worried a lot of people last week, Sofia. Look, do me a favor, whatever I may have said or done that night,just forget all about it. I wasn't myself. Listen... if there's something you wanted to tell me,you can tell me now. No. There's nothing. Deputy Director Wynne is a decent, honest man. Look, all of my troubles were caused by this no-good boyfriend who had just left me. Disappeared without a trace. Agent Wynne and I never had an affair and that baby I held, well, it never existed-- except in my head. Okay. - That's it? - That's it. I'm looking forward to going home. Now, I've got to wash the chlorine out of my hair.Can you guys excuse me? So, uh, you don't need my help? That was a mistake. I don't need anyone anymore. See her back? That's a new implant. Somewhere she can't reach it. Do me a favor? See if there's a hairbrush in her bag? Where's the problem? She seems fine. Can you? - No. - How about her room? - A hairbrush? - Just some stray hairs. It's not the strangest thing you've ever asked me for. Attention, residents, bingo will begin in the therapy center in five minutes. - You need these? - Ah, thank you. Seem to give you a lot of freedom around here. Yeah. That's what you get for saying yes to another implant. Really? Well, it seems to be working. Does it? Lucky me. Sofia's been my patient for the past six weeks. - Doctor...? - Hood. But she's here voluntarily. That's only because the Wynne family agreed not to press charges if she ??? If she tries to check out, she goes to jail. Look, she's doing great. You can see the results. Are you not worried by the nature of her delusions? I've got no interest in her delusions, only in the chemical imbalance that causes them. While we're on that subject, how are the implant trials going? Some patients find it difficult to comply with their medications. A slow-releasing implant could mean a decent life for a lot of unhappy people. When the technology is finally judged safe. I hear that with the animal trials, the monkeys try to tear the implants out. Is that true? Because they itch. I don't think the monkeys have a problem with the science. Does Sofia Lyons have a problem with the treatment you're giving her? You mean the treatment that's working? Well, look, Dr. Hood, she's getting what she needs. Antipsychotic drugs can be very successful treating delusions and hallucinations, but there are a lot of side effects, we know. Um, is miosis one of them? If you mean constricted pupils, you are right. But she was screwing her eyes up against the sun. Yeah, that's because her pupils were wide open. Thank you for the consult. Both of you. I'll be sure to look into it. - Did you get it? - Mm-hmm. Good girl. Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis, right? That's right, all those words, in that order. So what's the hair gonna tell us? Well, a length of hair is basically a record of its owner's drug use through the growth period. The follicle takes up whatever trace chemicals are in the bloodstream and locks them in the keratin. And no amount of soap, shampoo or swimming pool chlorine is ever gonna wash it out. Wow, so you can chop up a hair and get a day-to-day picture of whatever she's been on? Not that precise, but pretty close. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. What did Dr. Hood say to you? Sofia, please don't worry about Dr. Hood. Just concentrate on getting better. - What's the verdict? - Interesting. ??? From the changes in thickness along this hair, I wouldn't say it came from a woman who'd lost a baby. More like she carried it to full term. - Oh, wow. - What? Felix, call the treatment center. I don't think we can let Sofia Lyons leave. - What do you got, Hood? - See this line? That's her antipsychotic medication. Now, here, it's up, because she's taking it. Then it goes down because she's skipping it. Then it goes up, stays steady for a while. The first implant. Now, look what happens right after the second implant. What are those other lines coming in? That one, methamphetamine. Also known as crank, ice or crystal meth. That's right. This green line at the bottom is DXM. It's an active ingredient in cough medicines. - Cough medicine? - Yeah, it accelerates the meth. ??? Those are street drugs. They put her on meds, she skips them. They give her an implant, she rips it out. They implant another where she can't reach it, and she gets hold of this chemical brew of street drugs to cancel it out. ??? Why do that? Just to stay insane? ??? No one who's deluded believes they are, Rachel. She thinks she's clinging to reality. Sofia! Sofia! No, no, no! Sofia! Hey! No, no, no! Looks like crystal meth and dextroamphetamine. Did you supply her with these, Louella? Definitely not. Okay, Louella, where is she? Where's Sofia? If I knew, I wouldn't tell you. She said some very powerful man had screwed up her life just to protect himself. I can relate to that. Louella, if you think that by shielding her you're helping her, you're very much mistaken. If she acts on her delusions, she's gonna get herself in some very bad trouble. You say they're delusions. I say that all that stuff about her being dumped by a no-good boyfriend is their cover story, not hers. Did she tell you her plans? Tell them, Louella, or I'll take away your one-hour-a-day Internet access. Do you really think I care about that? This is my friend we're talking about here. Listen, all I can tell you is we want to help her, not hurt her. She said they were trying to take away her gift of fury, but that she needed it to get her baby back. How is she gonna do that? Spin a web, catch the big man. Then do whatever it takes to make him give it up. Sofia? Sofia Lyons? Back up. Smells of bleach and battery acid. ??? A little kitchen chemistry going on here. Must have been here a couple of hours. And I thought I was a bad cook. Well, I don't think you'd have tried this recipe. Extract the chlorate from the bleach, add sugar, powdered aluminum. She's an FBI chemist, Rachel. She knows exactly what she's doing. I think she made a fire bomb with an acid fuse. Should burn about 1,000 degrees Celsius. We got to get the Wynne family out of their house and into protection. I'll get Felix on it. J. Edgar Hoover Building WASHINGTON, D.C.</i> Susan, get out of the house. Pack a bag, take the kids up to the lake. I'll be up there as soon as I can. - Sir, you sure that you want to...? - Agent Lee, don't worry about it. It's not some isolated cabin in the wilderness. It's a weekend home in a gated community. We'll upgrade regular security with our people. Felix is on his way with Ray Wynne. You know, you should let me drive once in a while. I'm just thinking of you. I let you drive once. Never again. No, I'm just saying, you know, give you a break. Hood, we're not having this conversation. Forget it. All right, I think this is it. This? This is a weekend house? What is it? I was looking into Sofia's ex-boyfriend. What? ??? - Agent Young, - Call 911. - What happened? - We got here, we went inside. There was gas. She burst in and told us to get out. Who did? Sofia? Yes! How long ago? Just now. We just made it. - Which way did she go? - That way. -??? You stay here. - How did she know we were here? - ??? Rachel? - ??? - Dad! - ??? - Just stay here, okay? - ??? ??? - Dr. Hood, where you going? - Stay with the family. - I've got to find Rachel. - ??? I'm sorry. I wanted you to be Ray. Rachel. Rachel! - Any sign? - No, I thought I heard someone cry out. I should have pressed those charges. She'd be locked away by now. Why didn't you, Ray? I mean, she held a gun against your wife's head. Why? - It's called sympathy. - Really? So it wasn't to avoid having the official story tested in court? What the hell are you talking about? Sofia Lyons never miscarried. She had the child. And this mysterious ex-boyfriend who everything's been blamed on, turns out the only place he actually exists is in Sofia's FBI file. So what are you saying? I'm saying only someone inside the FBI could have created him, not some lab tech like Sofia. I mean, someone with very high levels of clearance. You the baby's father? I'm just her boss. With a weekend home she happens to know her way around? You see, I thought the problem was with her treatment. But her treatment was fine. I mean, well, it would have been, if there'd actually been something wrong with her. But she wasn't trashing her brain with these drugs to hold onto her delusions. She was fighting the treatment to hold onto reality. I'm resisting the urge to give you a smack in the mouth right now. Why don't you give it a try? No. And only because I know I can do a whole lot better than that. You better watch yourself. Rachel. She's passed out in the back. That's my fault. I'm sorry. Sofia? What have you done to her? Look, the only person I have a problem with is Ray. Okay? Don't trust anything he tells you. She okay? You hurt her? It was an accident, okay? I'm sorry. You could've killed the whole family. But I didn't, did I, now, okay? They-they weren't even supposed to be there! The house is where Ray and I used to meet. - We made the baby there. - Okay, tell me where you are. - No. Look, I looked into your story. I believe you. I don't care whether you believe me, okay? Now that I have Agent Young, you have to do what I say. Let me talk to her. Go to my apartment, switch on my computer. I'll call you from there. No. Sofia, I want to help you, but you have to let her go. - Let her go. - No one's gonna help me. I've learned my lesson now. There's no one I can trust. Sofia? Sofia! Sofia! Help! Can anybody hear me?! ??? There's some low-rent, high-volume bachelor party out there, so... sing along if you want to. Got you some painkillers. And this. It's a Wi-Fi phone. Takes weeks to trace a call, 'cause it goes over the Internet instead of the phone lines. You're going to jail, Sofia. You know that, don't you? We tried to help you, but you blew it. - I can get you a pillow for your leg. - Careful... ??? Careful! - shouldn't we... - Don't touch it! If I want to bleed to death, I'll let you know. OK. Fine. Sir? I found a weapon. I believe it's Agent Young's. - Any sign of her? - No, sir. There was a crossbow and traces of blood close by. I put down a marker and left everything as it was. What about her phone? No answer. Secure the scene. I want dogs in those woods and a bird in the sky. Let's find our agent. Go. I keep a crossbow here for hunting. So, the Director's here. - Ray. - Frank. Sorry this keeps hitting you so close to home, but Susan and the kids are safe, and that's what counts. Yes, thank God. I'm assigning an around-the-clock- protection detail for them until this woman is caught, okay? Thank you, Frank. Listen, this is not easy for me to say, but I haven't got a choice. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. Your man's a problem. - Who are we talking about? - Jacob Hood. He provoked this situation. He's endangered Agent Young. I know Jacob better than that. Well, you think you do, Frank. See if you see it the same way when he gets one of our agents killed. Agent Lee, where is Jacob? Appears as though he caught a ride out with State Police, sir. Sorry my apartment's such a mess, Dr. Hood. Let me speak to Rachel. Not yet. I want to know she's okay. Well, that'll be your reward for listening to me. Okay, go on. Is anyone there with you? Is... is Ray Wynne there? No. You know, I don't care what he told you, we were lovers. I didn't plan to get pregnant. Ray wanted me to have an abortion, but I said no. Then he talked me into giving the baby up for adoption. That whole story about the boyfriend deserting me, that was for Ray's protection. But after the birth... I changed my mind. I couldn't give my son up. Ray wasn't happy. But he said he'd work something out, you know? I don't know what happened then. He might have drugged me. I woke up in my house... with no baby... and 36 hours of my life missing. Like it was an ordinary day and none of it had ever happened. What do you want from me? Ray thinks this is all about him, but it isn't. I just want my baby back. Okay, why don't you meet up with me and we'll sort this thing out? Oh,No. You find out where my baby is. I give you Agent Young and then I disappear and no one ever hears from me again. And if that doesn't happen, I... someone's gonna die. Still hurts? It's getting worse. - Are you sure you don't want me to...? - No! No. Um, well, more of these? Here. Yeah, you're probably right. Sometimes I wonder if I ever play a little fast and loose with the old brain chemistry. But when Dr. Hood gets my baby back, it'll be a whole new start for me. You may be expecting too much of him. Don't you think he will? Dr. Hood is a genius... and he's a genuinely good man, but practical he isn't. You should let me make a few calls. Nice try, Agent Young. Did you really have Ray Wynne's baby? A son. Seven pounds, nine ounces. I even gave him a name. What'd you name him? I don't want to tell you... because then I'd have to change it when I find a new place to settle down. Sofia... you honestly think that's gonna happen? I hope so... For your sake. What's this? Agent Young's cell phone. Found on the roadside with Sofia Lyons' fingerprints all over it. ???was to Jacob Hood... right after Agent Young went missing. - What's your point, Ray? - Hood didn't report it. Instead he took off after them. Why would he do that - unless he had to hide something? - Ray, take it easy, okay? Wouldn't you go after your own partner? He's complicit, Frank. Maybe even directly responsible. No, that, that's not possible. Frank I know that you and Hood are friends, but you have to face the facts. This Lyons girl, she's on the road to recovery. She's doing fine. Hood goes to visit her at the treatment center. Within one hour she has walked out. She steals a car, she blows up my home, she injures maybe even murders... an agent. And Hood, he gets in direct contact with an on-the-run suspect. And then what does he do? He disappears. Falls off the grid. Now if you have some innocent explanation for this, I would really like to hear it, because my family is in danger. Who is this? It's me, Felix. Dr. Hood, where are you? I'm on a pay phone outside Sofia Lyons' place. I don't want to be traced. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. No kidding, Felix. I wouldn't involve you if I could avoid it, but I think I found a way to track down the kid that Ray Wynne stole. - Ray Wynne what? - I need to get out to Bethesda, where the National Institute keeps its health records. Listen up, people. I've just spoken with the Director himself. Dr. Jacob Hood is now a person of interest in the wounding and suspected kidnap of Special Agent Rachel Young. Now I know most of you know that Jacob Hood has worked here as a civilian employee for the past three years. He is, however, not a sworn agent. He's not one of us. Unlike Rachel Young, who most definitely is. So let's get out there. Do whatever it takes to get her back. And make sure the man whose life she risked hers to protect-- and who betrayed her-- pays for it. Let's go. Hey. Nobody followed me. Don't worry, I checked. Felix, Rachel's hurt. Sofia got her, but she will do a trade if I can find out what's happened to her child. Dr. Hood, you can't do this. Let me bring you in. The whole Bureau's out there looking for Agent Young. And for me. Come on. You heard Ray Wynne. Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. If that's the best you can do, you can go back now, forget I ever called you. Seriously, I won't hold it against you. - All right. - Thank you. - Why are we here? - Something I found. Maya Wynne's Myspace page? Yeah, complete with photos of her dad Ray and the entire family. Now look at the whites of their eyes. Maya's, pure white. But the males? Look kinda yellow. That's right. Now... there's a harmless condition, it's called Gilbert's Syndrome. Affects five percent of the population, and normally, there's no side effects. However, it can manifest in a jaundice that's brought on by, uh, stress or puberty. - What does that do for us? - Well, it's mostly males and there's a 50% chance of it being passed on, which means there's a pretty even chance that it could be in Sofia's child. Whoa. If there really is a child, you can't be serious about giving it back to her right now. - The woman's unstable. - That may be true, but she really didn't ask for this, Felix. Was it ringing? If Dr. Hood calls and I don't hear it, don't just lie there. Shout something! Have you ever consulted an NIH informationist before, Agent Lee? No, it's first time... - Karen. - Ka... That's my mother's name. Wow. Yeah, I'm running a study on the syndrome for the Bureau. All right, well, Gilbert's Syndrome is listed in the Office of Rare Diseases. Let's see if there's anything there. Sorry to put you through the trouble. They're supposed to notify me if they change their address, but... No,it's no trouble. Yeah, I'm not getting any hits. Are you sure about the spelling? Um... Their son's six months old. Can you try searching by age? Yeah. Only one. And this boy is not with his birth family. Can I see that? He's in foster care, pending adoption. You know what? You're probably right. This is just a waste of time. Sorry. Thank you. He's settled with a couple in Carroll County, Maryland. How could Ray Wynne go out and fix up an adoption, just like that? The state has a Safe Haven law for newborns. He could've dropped the kid off at any hospital, no questions asked, but after 60 days, the kid's legally abandoned and the parent loses all rights. But he's the boy's father. It's a cold world, Doc. We found the boy. Now what? Now... Now it gets tricky. Dr. Hood? I've tracked down your son, but I've got to make this quick. This phone's not secure. Okay. Can Rachel hear me? Uh... She can hear you now. Okay. I want you to meet me at 1515 Hazelwood. It's the diner where we had the worst pancakes - in the world, ??? - That's it. Let's go. Soon as I have the baby, I'll tell Dr. Hood where to find you. Listen. Listen. That's a false address. What do you mean? Hood knows the FBI is listening in. And I don't know where 1515 Hazelwood is. But I can show you where the diner is. This place looks like it's been closed for a while. It's the pancakes. They probably poisoned someone. Rachel. - You're okay? - Careful, careful. - Where is he? - ??? He's here. Oh! Rachel? What is that? What, you thought I was just gonna snatch him and hand him over? No. Felix? You see them yet? Uh-huh. Yeah, they've gone into a pizza place. - Wait. Here they come. - Okay, send me video. - But ,don't let them see you. - Okay. He is there. And he's watching the people who are looking after your son. These are live pictures from his phone. Yeah, uh-huh! No, they're brand new in the box. No, man, I heard now's the time to get back into the stock market. Okay, Rachel, keep your eyes open, okay? - Keep your eyes open, so you can stay awake. - Okay. We've got a location on Jacob Hood. What is the point of this? This doesn't help me. It's just making it worse! You're just trying to buy time to talk me out of keeping my son. Sofia, look at him. Look at him. He's safe. He's happy. And he's loved. All I'm asking is you just keep him that way until we've sorted this thing out, okay? - Can you do that, Sofia? - No! No! He belongs with me. Tell me where he is! Sofia, I'm asking you, think about what is best for your son! We made a deal, okay? You said that I could trust you! Yes, and you can, but we have to get her to a doctor, or she's going to die! Now, give me my phone! Give me my phone! Forgive me. Oh, God! Hood! Okay... Oh, my God! Doc! We need an ambulance. She's taken the phone. Where are you going? - I'm tired, Hood. - Stay awake. I'm doing the best I can. I think it's only five miles into the next town. In this thing? - More like 500. - We can't complain. The owner made sure we don't need keys. Told you I should drive every once in a while. Mm-hmm. - Rachel? Rachel? - Yeah? You can do this, okay? If it doesn't work out... it's not your fault. You can't fix everything. Just hold on. Can we get some help here, please? Excuse me, Sir. ??? Jacob Hood. The trouble you have caused me... Ray... I haven't even started. Oh, I knew you'd have, uh... surveillance all over my phone. You see that? That's the son you lied about. And a DNA test is going to confirm it. I suppose we should be thankful you didn't just take him down to the river and drown him. It's over, Ray. So are you. Little puppies love to run, they wag their tail... What a lovely baby. Oh. Thank you. Do you mind? Not at all. He's got a little bit of a cold. - He's gonna be okay, though, right? - Oh, yeah. He's strong. What's his name? Michael. Like the Archangel. - Hello, Michael. - Sofia? Sofia, I think you should come with us. Okay. Yeah, you're probably right. Bye, Michael. - Thank you. - Not at all. How's your leg? Uh... I start physical therapy tomorrow. How's the case? Oh, uh... Wynne's being held without bail while they, uh... work up a case for kicking him out of the FBI. And Felix tracked down Sofia. Brought her in. Good. Maybe she'll finally get the help she needs. Mm-hmm. Um, you can tell your, uh... new handler not to get too comfortable. I mean, I'll be out of here fore you know it. Been meaning to speak to you about that. Um... I've been thinking, and, um... I've decided if you... wanted to transfer out... I wouldn't stop you. "Welcome back, Rachel"? I'm serious, Rachel. You're lucky to be alive. And if it had gone the other way, I'd find that very hard to deal with. Listen to me, Hood. I don't want another assignment. All right? Maybe my classmates from Quantico are ahead of me on the ladder. And maybe I barely remember what my apartment looks like. But if it was anyone else lying here instead of me, I swear to you, I would be jealous as hell. Really? Besides...
