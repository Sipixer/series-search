Let's have the other foot. NO! Umm. It's just that there is something wrong with my left foot. You guys would think its really disgusting. I'm a surgeon. I cut people open. / I'm a doctor. This has been in people. Okay. I have a huge bunion. Sean's coming back in a few weeks. What am I supposed to do? Well I think the obvious answer, is to draw Sean's face on it, and tell him you grew it because you missed him. Or...it's a simple surgery. Uhhh Turk, I think we already decided on Bunion-face. Cut me the hell up. Dammit. Thanks Nurse Espinoza. Turk? If I decide to keep my last name after we get married, that's no big deal right? Course not baby. We'll just have one of those modern marriages where the husband and wife don't love each other. Turk! Wait! Turk! Turk! Whoah! You okay? All good. It's Jack's first birthday, I want it to be special. I got a petting zoo for the kids. And we need to figure out something great for the adults. How about a Russian Roulette booth? And here's the kicker. We put bullets in all the chambers. That way everybody wins! Will there be a pinata? Beause I need to know if I should bring my pinata helmet. Would you zip it nerd? The only reason I invited you is because For some reason, you have your own Sponge-Bob Squarepants costume. It was a gift. "From me to me." Anyhoo. I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't come. Why not? Because her whole family is in town. Hey JD. "Oh my god! What do you say to a girl" "you dumped three weeks ago?" I destroyed that video tape we made. What tape? Danni, if you don't look concerned, no one in America's Funniest Home Videos Is going to think this is real. Can't we just go home and have sex? No! Again from the top. Now I'll never meet Bob Saggat. So is their brother Ben coming to this thing too? Oh yeah. He always has to make some grand entrance that he just winds up depressed afterwards. Why is that? Cause he never surprises us. Even a little bit? No. Thorns! Ah! Augh! Ow! Ouch! Ah! Oh. Bloody. That's good. Now this time try and do it with your head in a sort of a less jarring position. I can't! That's perfect. Scrubs 3x14: My Screw-Up. I'm a prickly pear. Can I see that for one second? Thanks. Not a strong moment for you Polly. I need to get it started first. So you still doing the whole kooky guy who  brings his camera everywhere thing? Till the day I die. Uh-huh. Is this thing made of Teflon? You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters. That means you and I have something in common. I have to get going. To weird? Nahhhhhhh! What's weird is that its taken my best friend so long to come and see my son. I mean you get diagnosed with leukemia and then you disappear for two years. What is that about? Well, it went into remission and I wanted to see  the world in all its splendor and glory. How'd that go for you? Ehh. Got some good picture though. Here check it out. Look. Here's me at the Great Wall of China. This is me at the pyramids. What is this? Oh yeah. This was you and me, like eight seconds ago. So Jorden tells me that while you were on your world leukemia tour, you neglected to visit a single doctor, medicine man, or scary shaman with the giant saucers in his ears. Psst. Ben. Turns out cancer's the kind of ailment that you occasionally want to check up on. Fine. I'll get the exam. Tell you what. I missed the hell out of you. I did. Thanks Perry. I missed you to. Damn! Doh oh oh oh! Ha ha ha ha ha! YEAH! I AM THE KING OF GAY CHICKEN! You deceiving... You know Elliot you are eventually going  to have to take off your sock. If I do, then from now on when one of you guys look at me all you're going to think of me as giant gross foot. It's like that security guard with the hook for the hand. All everybody thinks when they look at him is, big giant afro. I do think that. Okay you know what? Maybe it would be better if you focused on  how you are doing this for Sean. I mean if there was something about me physically that bothered Carla, I would be excited to fix it for her. I mean it would probably make our relationship even better. And more... I hate your mole. What? What? Baby you said it was your tickle button. You made me shave my mustache. That was before I knew what was under there. {Y:i}Whew. Finally a brother can breath. {Y:i}Hello there. You wanna quit? Then quit! But you sir are a Worthless Peon! And you will always will be a Worthless Peon! Sir you know my band? The Worthless Peons. Well Chris from shipping and receiving wants to go solo. We lose him, we lose our sex appeal. He's the only one with hair. What do you think I should do? Ted you know my rule about personal problems. I'm not interested unless it involves my loved ones. Or possibly my wife. Doodle all your stuff to that. Awwwwwwwwwwwwww. Let me powder my head first. So should I be worried about the old ticker? Oh Mr. Taylor. Let me worry about that for you. {Y:i}Oh my god! He's gonna die! Ah Newbie. Perfect timing. I have to run a hundred fifty dollars  down to the police station cause Mr. Jinkies the Juggler, who jordan just has to have to  for Jack's birthday party, just got a DUI. Yeah! Only me. Long story short. Your new job is to take young Ben here by the hand and run every hematological screening test that we have. Dr. Cox I can't. I'm already covering for Doug. He's on a His-and-Her-Spa-Day with his mom. WHAT?! Don't ask. The point is, I'm swamped. And I'm a little worried about Mr. Taylor here. Hiiiiii. Mr. Taylor. For the life of me, I can't figure out his irregular heartbeat. I already looked at his EKG, Newbie, and trust me. He's not gonna die in the next thirty minutes. Now. Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hey JD. My sister Danni is more of a gentle kisser, don't you think? But I find jordan is loaded more along the lines of teeth and tongue. Would you please stop it. Fangs. This guy is supposed to be a great plastic surgeon. Okaaaaaaaaaaaay. So who wants what, bigger or smaller? My fiance' would like to have his mole removed. That? That's cute. It's like a tickle button. No it's not. It needs to go away. All right. I'll scrap it away and we'll cover it with  skin from the backside of your prothiosis So you would be a butt-face. That would be a funny nickname. No it wouldn't. Yes it would. God, how long does it take, to fill a bottle of pills! I'm sorry Madeline. I hope we didn't wake you. It's just that I have fifty patients and I... That's a code Watch I'm going to get out of this mole thing. Whatever, Butt-face. Uncool. Sir, I think I figured out how my problem affects one of your loved ones. It affects me. Swing and a miss. Oh, thank god you're here. I totally need someone to talk to. Usually I would talk to Dr. Cox, but he's out doing stuff. Course there is always Laverne, but I'm kind of her boss. And I like to avoid getting too up close and personal with staff members who work below me. As do I. See, it's just that I told Turk I didn't like his mole, and I feel guilty now. You've seen it, you can't avoid it. Dr. Cox. Ah. I'm afraid my band lost a member. So we're not going to be able to perform at your son's party. Ted. Now even though I never asked you to, that is still just ter-ific news. That hurt here, and here. Dr. Cox. What's the matter with you there Sheila? You look like Maybaline just went belly up. Twenty minutes after you left he went into cardiac arrest. We tried to resuscitate him, but there was nothing we could do. I'm sorry. Whoa man. Bummer. This shouldn't have happened. {Y:i}Guilt's a funny thing. It can lead to denial. Kid screwed up. No he didn't. He told you he has way  too many patients, he's swamped. The kid screwed up. Okay. Darn kid! {Y:i}Guilt can lead to compromise. Turk is doing this sweet thing for me, you know? Men's room! Whoa! Hey! I just wish there was something I could do for him. Know what sweetie? I'm fine with getting rid of this mole. But you got to be willing to take my last  name when we get married. That's perfect. Of course I will. And there she goes. Mrs. Carla Butt-face. Dammit. But as a doctor, you are around death so much you get used to the guilt. And you learn how not to let it keep from affecting your personal relationships. Brace yourself. What are you still doing here? I'm on call tonight. Not anymore. I'm taking all your patients. So wait. You think this was my fault? Hey, this is an emotional situation. So, why don't you go easy on the kid? It was your fault. Now get the hell out. Well that was good. That was good listening. Kev. Yup. Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep. I got it. I got it. All the best. Thanks man. I tell you what. Nothing says good morning  like a drunken human alarm clock. Hey. You've been here for sixty straight hours.  You need to go home. You know what I need. I need people to stop telling me what I should do. Fine. You know what you should do? Aw. Why are you here? Dr. Cox. Can I talk to you for a second? Hey, hey, Val. You know, you know what's funny? Ever since I started taking care of your patients not one of them has died. Look. You want to be mad at me, that's fine. I get it. Okay. But jordan called. And she wants to make sure you show this afternoon. Oh. Right. That thing. Put us down for Ben plus one. I'm not going anywhere. So beat it. You guys, I don't want to do this. Come on. No one's going to call you names. I know, but... FACE! Butt-face. Listen. My butt is fabulous. A slice of that up here, that's just me spreading the wealth. Still my mole is part of my identity. I need you guys to convince Carla to get me out of this. I can't man. I got things to do. Like what? Dr. Cox took all your patients. Gin. Dammit. Nice Hand. I meant the cards. I got to win my money back from Leonard. You know the guy with the giant afro. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh right. Yeah. I'll go talk to her for you. Thank you. I hate her for doing this to me. I hate him for doing this to me. I don't think he understands that Espinoza is more than a name to me. It's my heritage. It's also a candy bar in Equador. But mostly it's my heritage. I just don't want to do this Dr. Kelso, but I already agreed. What do you think I should do? Well Nurse "Snickers", until now you've just been white noise. But since you forced me to respond, let me a tell you a couple of things that only a few people know. I haven't paid my Country Club dues since  the third quarter of ninety-seven. But I sill tee off every Wednesday at eight fifteen, and take a bare-ass steam when the last putt drops. But more importantly, I really don't care about any of you or your problems. And you can confirm that with Ted. Don't those Espinoza's have nougat? Can we go now? No. How about now? No. Look as a rule of thumb I don't attend parties where the guest of honor has no idea what's going on. That's not true. Remember back when you and jordan first got married, and we went to go see senile old Grandpa Horty for his ninety fifth birthday party? Remember he kept trying to get the coat-check girl thrown out because she was loyal to the Kaiser. Benny, I appreciate your concern, but you just don't understand. What don't I understand? Well do you see all these people here? This is not some kind of senior citizens slumber party. I mean if it was, I would have already put Mr.  Foredom's hand in a nice bowl of warm water. But god bless him, he's going to go ahead and wet the bed anyway. My, my point is, is that if I'm not here, people die. If I'm not here, people die. Come on! Listen why don't you just let me take this  little mental breakdown of yours. I'm going to put it right here, in my pocket. And that way you can piss off for the afternoon, and you can let one of the other nine-thousand other doctors around here take care of things for you. So you haven't noticed that my supporting cast in this theater of hell, is a veritable who's who of incompetent puppets. So sorry to bother you Dr. Cox. But I have searched high and low for Carla. And honestly, it is like she has gone poof! And like disappeared into thin air. Heh. Have you seen her? No. No. I haven't seen her. Well if you do. Ummm. Page me. Oh, Ben. Outstanding commitment. Thanks. So, can we go now? Provided that gets you off my back. One more thing. Oh, come on. You got to forgive him. What? They're my shower shorts. Thanks again for helping me look for Carla. No problem. I'll check the dumpster. Ah, we're not looking for dead Carla. That a girl. You stay optimistic. Ahem. Sorry sir. It's been an emotional couple of days. I'm just here to, ah get a nasal speculum. I just wish I didn't hate that mole so much. I used one of these on my wife once. She's a terrible snorer. Used to keep me up all night. I made her have the surgery. Course that only made things worse. Here's the twist. Now, whenever she goes out of town, I can't fall asleep without the sound of that gasping, wheezing woman lying right next to me. Trust me. If I ever met a Japan air stewardess who snores like Enid, I'd marry her tomorrow. But here's the point. You might find out that thing you hate so much, is the very same thing you miss when it's gone. Thank you sir. All right, I'm gonna get right down to it. You tell Carla that my mole is inoperable, I will pay you ten thousand dollars. Turk! I don't want you to do this! The mole's inoperable. The deal's off. Ow! I couldn't find her. Don't sweat it. See ya! Great an open surgery slot just gone to waste. Not necessarily. Look at this. Waugh! Oh. Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. You know you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts. I mean it's not like they come with a complimentary shower wallet. Ow. Look I just want to say. That what happened. Wasn't your fault. And I'm sorry. Thanks. I really need to hear that. Good. Fun. Let's get dressed and go. Shower Shortz? For the man who has nothing to hide. But still wants to. {Y:i}Acceptance can take a lot of different forms. {Y:i}Whether it's accepting that it's okay to show  your soft side every once in a while. Well its official. Chris left the band. Well Ted, you know what I think? Good riddance to him. You'll find another tenor. Thank you sir. If you don't, who cares? You all stink anyway. {Y:i}Or accepting someone you love for just the way they are. Can you tie my tie, Mrs. Espinoza? {Y:i}Answer him! You just kissed my mole. So how come you don't have to get all dressed up? I am dressed up. You see any holes in these pants? No. I'm glad you made it. Listen. There is one  more thing you have to do for me. You can't keep me from getting drunk. You have to forgive yourself for everything  that went down the other day. You are so annoying. Yeah. Okay. Good. Now where is your camera? Aren't, aren't you going to take some pictures? Pictures of what? You know. Crying babies. Covered in chocolate. People singing happy birthday to my son, who've never even met him before. You know, the whole routine. Where do you think we are? {Y:i}But in the end, the most important thing to accept, {Y:i}is that no matter how alone you feel, {Y:i}how painful it may be, with the help of those around you,
