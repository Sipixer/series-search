I couldn't help but let my mind drift back to my very first day.</i> Don't look at me when we are moving someone. Why? And from now on, whenever I am in the room, you're definitely not allowed to talk. Charge! Doctor Dorian... Do you <i>not</i> realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? Sticked a penny in there? No, I was just making small talk... If I'll find a penny in there, I'm taking you down. I thought we cared about each other? Oh please, if you don't want to sleep with me, you'd do the same thing. I'd tell you one thing, the last thing in the world I want to do is sleep with you now! Do me right here... Okay. See? I won in the end though, because now she loves me</i> and I get to have her whenever I see fit.</i> In fact, I think I'll use this last day thing</i> to score some morning sex...</i> I can't believe today's my last day... No morning sex. Worth a try. We can kiss if you remember to lay out mouth wash last night. I did. Did you water it down so we can just swallow it? Of course, I did! Actually, I did not remembered to water it down.</i> At all. - Morning. - You weirdo. You'd love it. How'd you sleep? Really well actually... I know that you wanna know why. This is my bed! I had it brought here because it's so comfortable! You don't have a bed at your house anymore? Why bother, I've slept here like every night since you moved. So... We live together? Kinda. I guess. I feel like I should've been told. Come on. I see it now. You've been sneak-moving in here for days! The clothes in the dresser,</i> those girly pillows on the couch, this weird picture of Vegas Showgirl... Don't make fun of my brother Berry. And he looks very beautiful. They did a dynamite job on his boobs. Are those G's? Double D's. Plus you are the guy who keeps asking me to bring stuff over here. Are you seriously upset? I am very upset, I don't even think morning sex could fix it. Although, it might. Fine! Do we have to move a lot? We never do anyway. True. Aw, man... He got my coffee wrong. How? It's dirt. That may be because I told Donnie you thought his coffee tasted like dirt. Why would you do that? Because Donnie is a vengeful, little punk, and I wondered to see what he would do. He's a convicted felony. Shift the guy! Aah, I love you Donnie. Muffin, please! I still can't believe you're going back to work. I miss doctoring. Any great thing about locum tenens is it's part time and you have to go where they need you, so it's gonna force Enid and me to travel. Finally, you are gonna stop hanging around here? Yep. This is my last muffin in this place. Finally, you're gonna stop hanging around here? Uhh, look... He's stuck on a thought. If he doesn't get off within a few minutes, just kick him, that's what I always do. Okay... I have enjoyed this stupid coffee spot so much. I need a momento. Would you distract the staff while I steal my favourite table? I don't think so, Bob. Understood, it's not your fight. Finally, you're gonna stop hanging around-- Finally, you're gonna stop-- Finally, you're gonna-- Oh! Thank you. No problem. I wouldn't do that. It's a good dirt. So I actually did drift off a bit. How was the morning sex? I was awesome! Really? Nah, I never really got things going, my peep is sleepy. Hey. JD, I know that it's your last day, but I'm not gonna say, "Goodbye" because even if just saying the word this ain't gonna go, it's gonna make me cry. Okay, okay, take deep breaths, deep breaths... I can't catch my breath, I can't catch it, I can't catch it. Where is it? Where is it? Breathe it out, breathe it out. Okay, I'm back. Plus, I'm just gonna see you at our place tonight, okay? Did you just said "our place"? You <i>are</i> sneak-moving in! Your ears are playing tricks. And JD, people should make a big deal about you leaving Sacred Heart, but... don't get disappointed if it doesn't live up to expectations you have in your head, okay? I think I'll be fine. Yeah, I-uh, I know it's blocking the stairs, but people could walk around, right? You're the greatest. Get over here. You're my bear! That's right. Growl for me! What are those pads for? Those pads there, my friend, are for you to fall on. In honor of your departure, I'm about to give you your final, full-turbo, spinning eagle. Prepping for takeoff! Excellent, now did you get my text about not eating after midnight, last night? All I had is mouthwash. Let's do this, come on! Mounting. Three! Two! One!</i> Eagle... Eagle... Are these two doctors? I'm afraid so. Never... stop... spinning me! Eagle! Whoo! Find the pads! I can't find it. Dude, follow my voice! Coming... There is another hospital down about 3 miles that way. You okay, babe? Eagle... Yeah. S08E18: My Finale Fantastic eagle, buddy! Yeah, I really felt like we nailed it. So, I'm gonna see you all day, I'm worried you did your goodbye too early. Oh my God, I did, I'm such an idiot. It's all right, I can fix this, We just have to match that initial goodbye intensity every time we see each other. Can you do that for me? Yeah, I'll just answer you like this, "Come here, you!" Smell like a weightlifter. That's cause I worked out this morning. Wow... It's alright. I finally dealt with the fact that you'll never hold me like that. Maybe we should try, let's see what we're missing. Yeah? Oh God, I love the feel of you. You smell like a turbo captain! Dude, it's finally happeni-ing! Now I know what we are missing, guys. You have been... Yeah, you guys are on to something. I usually cup the butt for support. Oh, it's nice. Oh yeah, there it is. Our groins are usually closer... Yes, it's like they're clapping... They almost slap each other. - Yeah, we're not gonna do that. - Yeah, not gonna do it. Excuse me. To hell with doing my goodbyes too early,</i> I want my moment with Doctor Cox,</i> and I want it now. Doctor Cox, since this is my last day, I got you a little something. You know, as a thank you. Because... In my mind... You're the one who made me the man I am today. You can't blame me for that. No, it's too mean. It's a book of all your rants! I always wrote them down. - Wow... - Check it out. Leather bound, I did the calligraphy. The number next to each passage is a rating system from 1 to 5, depending on how much that particular rant hurt me emotionally. One being something I could easily shrug off,</i> and 5 being something that still makes me want to cut myself. Oh, look: "The only way you could be less productive right now is if you were, in fact, the wall on what you're leaning against." That one used to be a five, but now it's a four. I still well up when I think about it, but now I can fall asleep after. Who wants to see what Jordan does when she's bored? Hey, Newbie,</i> What if say, I wanna to locate something in here about just how little I care about any given moment that you and I have spent together? Good question. You just go to the glossary, and you see, "How little I care." Page 19. Boom, page turn. Things I care as little about as JD's last day of residency. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I remember this one! Every hybrid car, every talk-show host, everything on the planet, everything in the solar system, and everything, everything, everything, everything... Everything that exist past, present and future, and all discovered and undiscovered to mention is, and of course... - Hugh Jackman! - Hugh Jackman! That was nice, I liked that. We shared that. Me too, because it's the exact sentiment that I wanna to put out there for you on your last day of work here. Thank you for this lovely present. Okay, um... You're welcome. Up close, you're not a handsome man. Thank you, Mrs. Stonewater. When you gone, he's gonna hit me. Mom, he is not going to do that. Doctor Dorian? I would never hit a patient, Mrs. Stonewater. I am not a hitter. See, he hates hitting. Well, I wouldn't say that I <i>hate</i> hitting. That's a little strange. D-D-Does wrestling count as hitting? Because my friend, Turk and I, sometimes wrestle and I really like that. When you're gone, he's gonna wrestle me! No, only if you tickle me first, that's what Turk does. Now he wants to tickle me! Are you an idiot? Can I talk to you outside for a second? That is not my mom, okay, uh... This paranoia, and a delirium, and it's last few weeks, it's like she's just checking out and-- I know it's frustrating, but I promise you, we're gonna find the answer. He's gonna hit me when you leave!</i> I'm almost positive I won't! Do you think you need the "almost" part? I am very positive I won't! It will never happen. Sorry. You're no doctor? Actually, it's my last day. Yeah, makes sense. That was hurtful. Can there be good without evil? It's probably a question for your priest. I'm Jewish. Really? Shalom! - What? - Never mind. That "good-evil" thing was in my head because I was watching "Unbreakable" by Manight Shyamalan. It's "M. Night", you-you don't say "Ma-night", it's-it's M. Night, no Ma. No, it's Ma! Like Thomas Haur, F. Maria Abraham. Don't think so... - No Ma? - No Ma. Well, that's funny.</i> Cause we've bowling the other night, and he says, "Man, no one ever says my name right." I said, "Ma, you've got two bigger problems than that." One of them is that seven tense split you live for yourself... And the other one... is how about trying to write a movie without a big twist ending. Well, he took offence, got pissed, he wouldn't talk me for a good hour, but... He loosened up on the hay, right? Yeah, I'm sure that's a true story. Anyway, I wanted to do something big for your departure, but now it is my wife who's taken up all my time. I wanted to spend all night in the lab, but she wanted to play cards. You have a lab? So I decided to go simple. What would you say... this is? Seems like a really gay piece of man jewelry. It is. It's also the penny that you put in the door, eight years ago. For the last time, I did not put a penny in the door! - Admit it! - Oh God! Why did you do that? Because I read in a book... that if you surprise someone with an accusation, they're more likely to tell you the truth. Nah, I don't really think that's gonna work. Okay, well, I'm not discouraged. You know what they say. You admit it? Could you stop doing that? It's nothing's gonna happen. Don't feel bad, I'm probably doing it wrong. Admit! Doctor Dorian, if the patient says his painkillers aren't working,</i> how do we know if he's just trying to scam drugs or if he really needs more pain meds? What I recommend is taking a safety pin and then just give him a quick little sta-ab, okay! Kidding. Guys...</i> We don't ever stab. With pain meds, it's hard to gauge... I'm gonna miss you so much. C'mon, squeeze me like you mean it. You smell like it's hot of... It's hot in my heart. Get out of here. Okay, I can understand that might have seemed a little girly, even for me. M-m, not really. You know, Jo, I'm not really taking comments right now. No, no, it's sort of an announcement phase, okay? Announcement number one: Starting tomorrow, Doctor Cox will be leading intern rounds. Sadly, it is my last day. You are now free to comment. Who would like to start us off? Nobody? Jo? It's funny, you were-- you were eager to make a comment only moments ago. No, I got nothing. I order you to comment! Umm... I'll miss you...? Oh, Jo! I'll miss you too! It's over, Sunny, it's too late. There he is... Speak of the devil! I was just prepping these guys for you to take over. Maybe you'd like to say a few words about how you and I got started our relationship began as a student and teacher thing, and then evolved into something a whole lot more. The floor, Perry... is yours. I'm okay. He's okay. You're okay? He's okay, okay, uh... I guess I'll just have to settle for handing over the ceremonial reins... Take the reins, please. Never want to. Take the reins. I don't want the reins. - Please, take the reins. - I'm not taking the reins. I can take the reins and just hold them for him! I felt that could work out for everyone. Here you go, they're heavy. This guy can pull, haha... No one's taking the reins! Well then, what am I gonna do with the reins? Reins are on the ground. Happy now? Alright, children, tomorrow morning, I want you prepped on the endocrine system. At least let me pass of the torch... Oh, for the love of God, disperse! Can you hold this please, it's very hot. And just like that, it was time to ruin someone's day.</i> She has Huntington's Disease? It's a degenerative brain disease. Causes you to lose control of your movement and mental ability. It can also change your personality, like with your mom. So, uh, what do we do? Unfortunately, there is no cure. Eventually, it will take her. Oh, geez... Sometimes you just have to barrel through,</i> no matter how much it sucks.</i> And... Mr. Stonewater,</i> Huntington's is caused by a faulty gene. And since your mother has it, you have a 50/50 chance of having it too. We can test you for it, if you want. If we find out that I have it early on, are there any treatment options? Nothing substantional yet. I can only tell you if you have it. I... can't even tell when the disease would hit you, if you do have it. Could be in your 70s, like your mom, or-- Could be sooner. Could be sooner. I am so sorry. Do I have a few minutes? Sure. I'm so bummed about Ms. Stonewater,</i> I totally spaced and forgot what's wrong with Benjamin here.</i> Is he the one with the broken ribs?</i> Nope. Maybe he is the guy with sinus polyps?</i> I don't think there is any polyps,</i> but he definitely has some oily skin issues.</i> I should try him onto that dynamite apricot scrub</i> I stole from Elliot. Oh, come on! Focus!</i> I s'pose I could go get his chart,</i> but I left it all the way downstairs...</i> Come on, man, you got eight years</i> of medical experience. Use it!</i> Maybe you can smell it out...</i> I want to say it smells like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i> What are you doing? You don't know what any diseases smell like!</i> Ah, to hell with it. What do you have again? Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Of course you do, you reek of it. I'm sorry. See, Benjamin understands that you're human,</i> that you're having kind of an overwhelming day.</i> Give him a smile, as a "thank you"!</i> I want a new doctor. Uh, no, I've been working my butt off taking care of you for the last two weeks, so I'm afraid the answer is "no", Benjamin. My name is Roger. I'll get you a new doctor. What's wrong? Did you find out that I am replacing your kitchen counter tops with a prettier ones from my apartment, because if you're mad, I can stop those workers right now. What? No, Elliot... I'm upset because Huntington's Disease sucks, Doctor Cox is a jerk, I'm such a crappy doctor, I just got dumped by a patient, and no one but you and Turk even cares that I am leaving! What about them? I'm not leaving yet! I'm just getting some air, but thank you! Thank you all! You know, I've always said that I-I came to Sacred Heart a boy, and it's turn me into-- They are waving at me, genius. I took my favourite table, and I'm bailing out of that coffee place. Bye gang! - Bye, Bob. - Bye, Bob! But you left a year ago! You got cake! He got a cake! Who changed my sign? How dare you change somebody's sign?! You stupid sign changers?! Hey, relax. They're sign changers! I'll fix it. Oh, that's right, I forgot Tina in accounting left for eight days to climb on Kilimanjaro! How cool is that? - Elliot! - <i>What?</i> I just think she's very brave! With her wooden leg and all. Hey Elliot, I can see down your blouse from here! I hope you fall and die, Todd! What a way to go! There, lil' better. So what the hell did you think leaving this place was gonna be like? Well, I guess I felt there would be a lot of heartfelt goodbyes... When I was finally ready to leave, it'd be like one of those great old sitcom finales... We got a trouble in here! We all gonna die! Why would they wire all the power through one switch? That seems crazy! Well, I'm afraid all I can offer you is a handshake. I'll take it, sir. Have a great life, Dorian. Thank you. Get as much tail as you can. I always do, sir. Already through a morning sex today. Daddy girl! To all goodbyes, maybe you should just ask for them. You're right. My exchange with Doctor Kelso renewed my strength.</i> Other men had no problem saying what they wanted,</i> and sure, sometimes it was a ridiculous, ridiculous request</i> Admit that you did it! No! - 'Mit! - No! Dammit! And sometimes, it's even</i> not wanting to know if you have a fatal disease.</i> Hey, uh, Doctor Dorian... I decided not to take that test, okay? Okay... Either way, it was time for me to follow their league.</i> Doctor Cox, I want something from you. I know you do, Newbie, and I have been searching through this wonderful book that you gave me, trying to find the exact right speech to share with you, but alas, there's nothing in here on "Barking up the wrong tree," or even a "Turn back <i>now</i> because this doesn't end well for you" sections, so... I'm gonna have to go ahead and wing it. Let's see what happens. Noobie, I know that you want this to be a very special day for the both of us. I get that, I truly do. You want feelings to be shared, you want hugs to flow. But that is not now nor is it ever been who I am, and you know that. I'm real sorry there, Newbie, but this is not a special day for me, it's just... a day. If you put that down in the book later, give it a five. Fair enough. How could Dan not want to know if he has Huntington's Disease? Maybe he's in denial. I mean if it were me, I've been gone crazy.</i> I'm gonna go talk to him. D-I implore you, please do the one thing I am beyond confident that you know how to do nothing do nothing. It is the patient's decision. Has Perry told you how he feels about you yet? No, and he says he is not going to. Well, just wait him out, you'll beat him in it. Un... Let it arrive... acceptable... Unacceptable. You love torturing him, don't you? I do. How come you never tortured me? You know like when I just started. You were Bambi! Somebody had to teach you how to walk. Thank you for that. For being my teacher. No problem. Is there anything I can do to repay the favor? Tell me my husband loves me more than he loves you. It's about the same. I'll take it. I'm gonna miss you, Bambi. And I'll miss you too. - Why are you stopping? - Why are <i>you</i> stopping? - I don't wanna say. - Just say! Let's face it. We said "goodbye" too early, I don't think I've got another hug in me. Honest to God, I never thought I'd hear you say that. How can I ever not want to hug you? Has the world gone mad? It's just crazy! We can do this. You're absolutely right buddy, come here! Nope, not feeling it. You smell like regret. Let it go. Young lady, are you responsible for jamming those elevator doors? No, good sir, I am not. Tell the truth. Okay, I did it. But it was an accident. That's okay. Because you came clean! And here's ten dollars. Go buy some ice cream! This is stupid. He blackmailed me into doing this. No improving... Give me the money back. No, my script says to rip it up and walk away dramatically. She was supposed to be my long-lost sister, were you getting that? Look, it's been a very long day. Well, long days are like pancakes... Admit it! Fine! I put penny in the door. It was eight years ago! Oh, what do you know, it finally worked. It was an accident. It fell out of my pocket and rolled into the door. It was my first day, I didn't wanted you to be mad. Do you believe me? Yeah, I saw it happen. If you saw it happen, then why did you asked me back then if I put a penny in the door? It was a test of character. You failed. And you lost out on a wonderful friendship. We could still be friends! So you're actually gonna stop working around here? That's right, Ted. So you're actually gonna stop working around he.. - Thanks. - No worries. Did you know it's Doctor Dorian's last day? You should give him a hug and share your feelings about him. Do you think you're funny? Funny looking pal! Hey, you. I-I'm trying to develop my sentimental side. You know, for my stupid kids, and you and I did it once, so... Take care. Thanks, Jordan. So you're actually gonna stop working around here? Ted, come here. I need to be horrible to someone. That's weird that you came. Uh, you seem like you need it. I am supersensitive about my skin today. Focus on that. - It looks really blotchy. - Yeah, and check this thing out! - Did you pick that? - No, it did it by itself! I wanna touch it, but I don't! Did you just page me to ask me how much Ibuprofen to give Mrs. Lensner here? Oh, I was worried it would excacerpate the patient... It's Ibuprofen! Here's what you do: When she wakes up, get her to open her mouth, nice and wide, then get some of those Ibuprofen pills in your hand, and throw them at her! Whatever sticks in there, that's the correct dosage! And the cycle repeats, huh? Beg your pardon? You yelled at me for the very same thing, when I was an intern. I'm gonna go ahead and jot that down as one of the most fascinating tidbits of the day! So maybe that's who Perry Ullysses Cox is...</i> A gruff, insensitive teacher.</i> And after everything we went through,</i> if I'm still just another student to him...</i> It doesn't mean I should be any less grateful.</i> Thank you for everything, Doctor Cox. Keep moving. I expected that. I didn't expect this. We're sorry... About what? - I blew my goodbye, I did it too early, - The whole moving in, I totally blew it - now I can't hug you, - 'cause I feel like I was - what kind of a friend am I? - going to lose you end of all... Guys, can you not talk simultaneously? - I can, - I can, - but I'm not sure she can... - but I'm not sure he can... - That was awesome! - That was awesome! Turk, your goodbye was great. And Elliot, I told you to move stuff in, because I want you to be there all the time. I sublented my house! That's aggressive-- I can't help it, I lost my mind! Still, guys, I want you to know... We're all good, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. I understood their neediness, because I am feeling it myself.</i> And I know what's causing it...</i> The future. I wanted to know what was next.</i> Whether we would make it as a couple?</i> Whether I would stay tight with my friend?</i> Whether he will even miss me when I'm gone?</i> Hey. Hey! Where's your mom? Oh they, uh... They wheeled her out of her bed to get some kind of scan. I should probably go check on her. Before you go, I got to ask... Why aren't you going to get that test? I don't know. I still might, you know, in a next few years or... days. But right now, if I found out</i> that I was eventually gonna die from something... Once you learn that information, you can't unlearn it. And this way, my future is still mine. It can be whatever I want it to be. Does that makes sense? Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. My last chart. So your shift is officially over... and that'll do it. Nice knowing you, John Dorian. It was nice knowing you too... What is your name? Glenn Matthews. Oh, that was easy... That's easy now. When I was a kid, I had a horrible impediment, I'd say "Genn Mafuf". I'm glad I wasn't there during those times... I would have turned you to pifuf. Why would you tell me now? It's first time you've asked. No, it's not! Pretty sure it is. I've been here for eight years, and I don't know your name, I call you "The Janitor", I am sure I've asked you what your name is. I don't think so. Really? People don't wanna know the janitor's name. You probably forgotten my name already. - Glenn. - Glenn... Mafuf. Well then... Shalom, Glenn Matthews. Shalom. Hey, Tony. What's up? Adios... See ya. Things rarely go exactly the way you want them to.</i> So sometimes you make due with whatever you can get.</i> Good night! Good night. Ah, he's finally gone. Talk about making a big deal over nothing, you know. I mean, Doctor Dorian was fine, but he was no better than any other doctor. For the record, he was the best that ever came through this dump. John Dorian was the first and only doctor I ever met who cared as much as I do. And you can forget about him just an exceptional physician. Because the fact that matters is he was... He's a damn exceptional person. That's why people gravitated to him. That's why I did. He was my friend. Thank you, God. That was beautiful. Oh God, no... It's okay, Perry. You just said how you feel. Honestly, I am so full of your love right now, I literally could not take another drop. Brace yourself, I am coming in. You smell like a father figure. Oh... Please stop. Great job, Sunny, you said your line perfectly. Oh, thanks! I worked on it! I knew it would set you off. Good night, best friend. He thinks I'm an exceptional... person! You realize that even though he gets to leave, you... have to stay? I didn't think that out. No. You didn't. Endings are never easy.</i> I always build them up so much in my head,</i> they can't possibly live up to my expectations,</i> and I just end up disappointed.</i> I am not even sure why it matters to me so much</i> how things end here. I guess it's because we all want to believe</i> that what we do is very important.</i> That people hang onto our every word.</i> That they care what we think.</i> The truth is, you should consider</i> yourself lucky if it even occasionally</i> get to make someone, anyone...</i> feel a little better. After that, it's all about the people that you let into your life.</i> And as my mind drifted the faces I've seen here before,</i> I was taking the memories of family...</i> Hey, little brother! of co-workers... Goodbye-five! From the Big Dog! of lost loves... You never called. I miss you. Even of those who've left us...</i> There you are! Hi, tiger! And as I rounded that corner,</i> they all came at me in a wave of shared experience.</i> Keep it all like you do. Point-flip! I broke my penis again. But this time it was fun! Take care, bro! Take real good care. I didn't kill her. Way to live a cheery gig, bro. I got me some white meat. Keep party later, there'll be prostitutes. Did you ever go on that picnic? Make sure you do. I hate you so much, JD. It's like a baget. Hooch is crazy. And even though it felt warm and safe,</i> I knew it had to end.</i> It's never good to live in the past too long.</i> As for the future, thanks to Dan,</i> it didn't seem so scary anymore.</i> It could be whatever I want it to be.</i> And who's to say this isn't what happens?</i> Who can tell me that my fantasies won't come true?</i> Just this once. Good night. Good night. Hey. - Say action. - Action. I wanna touch it, but I don't. Chief, say what. Oh, that's funny, 'cause we were bowling the other night and he says, "Man, no one ever says my name right." I says to him, I says, "Ma, you got two bigger problems than that. One of them is that seven tense split that you left for yourself. And another one... is how about trying to write a movie without a big twist ending? He says, "What's with the accent?" I say, "What do you mean? It's just how I grew up." He says, "I will put you in a movie." I said, "Okay." Then we're on a hay ride later, and he makes a monkey face. I say, "What in the world is this?" He says, "Hey man. Welcome to the big time." He slaps me across the face. Well, I didn't know whether to... or write a screenplay. Next, hit him. Act two.</i> Hit him. Alright, just hit him. Come on!</i> Come on! Hit him. Got me, you got me! # Tell me, you'll be listening on Fridays # # She doesn't really... # Oh my God, you're listening! It's a wrap. Thank Donald for the set up.</i> I'll really miss you. You'll top me in. Good night check. There's the season wrap from Judy Reyes.</i> - Oh, God... - Mmm... Well, you bet... More defense now? Alright, Donald. - Camera set? - <i>Yeah.</i> Ha, check it. Hey, that's the season wrap on Zach Braff. Transcript: Zomgmeister [TVSubtitles.net] Final Edits by: VeRdiKT
