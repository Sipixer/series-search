Prue was a wreck, but I knew you'd find a way. We need to talk. Leo, you haven't kissed me in a week. Don't you think maybe that takes priority? - I came to say goodbye. - What? They told us to break up. They caught us trying to get married. So we won't get married. We'll wait. It's too late, we broke the rules. Now they won't let us see each other again. Wait a minute. They won't what? I don't care what they do to me, but I couldn't bear anything happening to you. I shouldn't even be here right now. Wait a minute. Leo, I can't hear you. What are you saying? You have to forget about me. Leo. I love you. Leo! Leo! Piper. Piper. Piper, wake up! Piper. Leo's not coming back. Honey, it was just a bad dream. No, it wasn't. It was real. I don't understand. Why are they doing this to us? It's like destroying lives is how they amuse themselves. Piper, watch what you say. Why? What are they gonna do to me? They couldn't hurt me more than they already have. Don't you just love cell phones. Hey, it's me. It's amazing how much stress you can project with so few words, Prue. I will have your precious car home momentarily. Phoebe, I am not calling about the car, I'm calling about Piper. Look... ...she had this dream about Leo. And maybe I'm overreacting, but I've never seen her like this. It's... It's like she's completely given up. What kind of dream about Leo? Phoebe? I'm fine, the car's fine, I'll see you later, bye. Hi. Are you okay? You can't have it! Leave me alone! I won't give it to you! Leave me alone! It's okay, it's okay. You're safe. You're safe. Okay. You just have to be very careful because it's hot, so blow on it, okay? Hey, did you find out anything more from her? Name, rank and serial number. Her parents are on the way, they live up the street. They were very worried about you. I'm gonna go to the car and get her jacket. - Keys? - What? You know, silver shiny things that go jingle-jingle? I don't have them. That's so weird. I put them up here. The fairies probably hid them. What was that? Sorry. I'm not supposed to talk about fairies. You know what? In this house, you can talk about anything you want. Sometimes we talk about weird things too. Well, that's what fairies do. Hide your keys and things. They're tricky like that. Is that what's in that box? Is it a fairy? Is that who you're protecting? That's probably your mom and your dad. He's not my dad. He's just my mom's new husband. - Hi, we're Kate's parents. - Is she all right? Yeah, she's fine. I mean, she scraped her arm a little bit, but mostly she's just scared. Kate? - Get out of the doorway. - Kate. It's an in-between. Get out of the in-between. - What's an in-between? - Where the trolls are. Honey, we've had this conversation before. You're a big girl, and it's time to stop believing in things like that. She's had some problems since her father and I divorced. Regressed, sort of, back to the imaginary-friends stage. Look, we should go. It's late. Thank you again, for everything. They'll get us. I won't let them. It's okay. Look, there it is! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on, Phoebe, trolls and fairies? You don't believe that stuff. Sure, why not? Well, maybe it's time we tell her about Santa. All I know is something was definitely after her. But you didn't see anything? No, but how else did she get hurt? How about she fell down and scratched herself? No, Piper, they weren't scratches, they were claw marks. If they were, you would have seen what had clawed her. Why are you being so stubborn about this? Because I'm a Scorpio, what's your excuse? Okay, so it's kind of late, and we're all a little bit tired. So how about we finish this up tomorrow? Now look what you did. You went and turned Prue into the middle child. Okay, Phoebe. Even if fairies and trolls do exist, you heard what her mom said. The problem started when her father left. - That's psychology, not magic. - I know. But you know what? I'm gonna check the Book of Shadows, just in case. Because I don't want to be out-stubborned by a Gemini. No, don't! The tweens! They come out of the shadows. Honey, just go to sleep, okay? Please. Go away. Leave us alone. Hey. Check this out. We each drew one. - "Lily." - Do you remember her? She was our little imaginary friend we had when we were kids. I have not thought about Lily in years. That's because you grew up, and you stopped seeing her. Okay. Fairies, elves and trolls are mystical creatures that live in a realm parallel to ours, but separated by a thin veil. The Enchanted Realm? A thin veil which lifts only in tween places. Tween places, Prue. That's like a realm in between two things. Like doorways and windows, shadows. - Shadows? - In between light and dark. And It's exactly what Kate said, trolls live in the in-between. Right, but when you found Kate, she wasn't in an in-between. Actually, she was in the biggest in-between of all: midnight. "In the hour between night and day, the world itself becomes a tween." Okay, so why isn't there anything in the Book of Shadows? Because the Book of Shadows was written by adults. And I'm assuming that scary-Iooking dude in your picture is a troll. So then why is he trying to hurt Kate? I don't know, we have to ask Kate. And we will fill Piper in on the way. You know, maybe we should just do this one on our own. I mean, Piper's kind of out of it. Even more reason to drag her along, take her mind off of Leo. Phoebe, phone! - It's your little lawyer boyfriend. - So there. - And he is not my boyfriend. - Weird. - Hello? - Who's not your boyfriend? The mailman. Yeah, sometimes Piper likes to tease me because I like to get the mail a lot. So how are you? Well, it's a beautiful morning and I got a beautiful woman on the phone, so things could be worse. God, I sound like Billy Appleby. - What? - Nothing. No, wait, what did you just say? Billy Appleby is just this hokey guy from this old movie I watched too many times when I was a kid. Kill it Before it Dies. - You've seen it? - Once or twice. Really? Too bad it's not playing, I'd take you to see it. I love you. Course we could always have dinner instead. Are you asking me out, counsellor? Guilty. How about tonight? I could stop by your place. Really? Well... Actually tonight's not good because Piper is going through something. But I will call you and maybe we could meet at the club, okay? Sorry, bye. Did you not look at those drawings? They're cute, yes. Cute? Cute? We all had the same invisible fairy friend, Piper. That is proof that fairies exist. Or... ...it proves that one of us had a really fertile imagination, and the other two were really good copycats. Okay, Piper, honey, just listen to me, okay? We think that Kate's in trouble. Our kind of trouble. Okay, well I don't. And after what they did to Leo, I'm not really all that motivated to go dig up demons for them. - Trolls. - Whatever. Look, you guys can do whatever you want, but I've had it, and I'm done. - What does that mean? - That means that the powers that be haven't done anything but ruin my life, so therefore I'm not gonna do anything for them anymore, okay? I'm going now. Excuse me. I'm going now. I think she's on strike. Kate, someone's here to see you. Hey. So we brought you your jacket. We had to use the spare key to get into the car, though. I guess the fairies hid them after all. Told you. What are you drawing? That looks like a very scary cave. You know, that looks a lot like mine. That's a fairy and a troll. My mom says I'm making them up, but I'm not. We believe you. We just need you to tell us everything that you know so we can help. I don't know that much. Thistle's kind of hard to understand. Fairies don't talk the same way people do. - Thistle? - I saved her. See, the fairies are the bosses of the enchanted kingdom, but the trolls wish they were the bosses. So they kidnapped Thistle from the king and queen of the fairies. So Thistle is a princess? But the trolls are gonna kill her unless her parents hand over the kingdom. It's a miniature coup d'Ã©tat. But I found her tied up in a cave and I saved her. That was very brave of you. But now the trolls hate me because I won't give her back. Most of the time, I can stay out of the in-betweens, - but at midnight... - There's no place to hide. Yeah, we know. Can we see her? No, only children can see fairies. Well, I don't know if this is gonna help at all, but Prue and I, we're very in touch with our inner children. Can we at least try? We'll have to go into an in-between. Watch out for trolls. Okay. Can't help if you can't see her. Thistle says that if you really believe in fairies, there's something that'll make you innocent again so you can see them. I think it worked. I wanna see the fairy. If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands If you're happy and you know it Pat your knee Oh, my God. - Pat your knee - You guys gotta do it. If you're happy and you know it Then your face will surely show it If you're happy and you... - What the hell is going on? - You think this is bad? You should have been here for "Frere Jacques." They've been acting like kids since they got here. I didn't serve them, I swear. All right, put on some music, any music, and kill that microphone. If you're happy and you know it Spin around - Hi. - Hi. Lost your minds? Piper, we have been waiting and waiting and waiting... And you know what we did? We saw a fairy and she was very cute and she was sparkly and she was really, really pretty. Okay. What ass-backward spell did you guys cast? - We... We didn't cast a spell. - No, it is true, we did not cast a spell. But we did use fairy dust. - Fairy dust. - Yes. Okay, great. So you can go home now and reverse it, Tinker Bell. No, no. No, I am not a fairy. She thought I was a... We have to show her. - Okay. Yeah. - Ready? Okay, go. One, two, three! What the hell did you do that for? That did not work! No. Work. That's a very good idea. I'm gonna go back to work now. Hey, you know what? You are being a big, big, big, extra, extra, double big jerk right now! Because now I have the key, so Thistle is safe. And we have to be back with Kate at midnight - so when the trolls attack... - No. You guys are going home. And you're not driving either, because someone will think you're drunk or something. So go outside and wait there, and I will call a cab. - Now, just... - No. Why are you being mean? I know what you're trying to... Stop it! You're trying to trick me into ending my strike, and it's not gonna work. - You guys go home! Scoot! And go! - We love you! Scoot. You go home and you reverse this ridiculous behaviour. - Are you okay? - Yeah. The trolls. They must know that we have the key now. Okay, they're very scary, but they're gonna come after us instead of Kate at midnight, so all's we have to do is go home and wait for them. Okay. Jeez Louise, there are too many doorways in this house! Okay. We have to call Kate on the walkie-talkies, okay? Do you think trolls know about doorbells? I don't know. Cole! Hey! - You're home. - Yes. Tween! Excuse me, but you were not supposed to meet me here. You were supposed to meet me at the club, remember? - Was that the plan? - Yes, that was the plan. Sorry, long day. Okay, bye. Close the door behind you. - Bye. - Bye! It's a long drive home. Do you think I could use your restroom? Number one or number two? - He has to go tootie. - Excuse me? Okay, you can come in but you have to do it very fast, whatever it is. Kate, Kate, come in! It's Prue. Come in, Kate. - Kate, are you there? - Prue, where are you? We're at home, the dust didn't work on Piper. Then she doesn't believe. What are we gonna do? I'm scared, there's shadows everywhere and it's almost midnight. Okay, listen, Kate, okay. You don't have to worry. That's what we called to tell you. Because the trolls know that we have the key now. They're not after you anymore, they're after us. No, they're here too. I can hear them. As long as we have the key, Thistle is safe. So just stay there and turn on all the lights and it'll disappear the shadows. Yeah. Yeah. Trolls. Let's go get them. Prue. That was a very, very big troll. That wasn't a troll, that was a demon! Okay, well, where does he fit into the story? - He was after the Book of Shadows. - All right, well, you know what, we can't really worry about him right now because we have to get to Kate. Phoebe! Phoebe! Look out! Prue. They got the key. Phoebe. Are you two okay? Hey, you know what, can you just go? I'm really sorry to rush you out, but we have something very important to be taking care of. You sure you're okay? I mean, that sounded like a nasty fall. - Yeah, Cole, we're fine, really. - You two seem different. - Different? - I mean, I thought maybe you were drunk or something before, - but how you seem... - Sober. Stairs can be sobering. Right. Okay. I'm really sorry about our plans there, Cole. I really am. No worries. I'll keep trying. "Stairs can be sobering"? Okay, what was I supposed to say? That some unknown demon came in to try and steal our magic book, and then little trolls came and pushed us down the stairs? Right. Okay, but why are we thinking like grownups all of a sudden? I don't know, it must have been from the trauma of the attack. Which is probably a good thing. I don't think our inner children would have had a lot of luck protecting Kate. And now that the trolls have the key, we really need to go protect Kate. Hello, Prue? Okay, I don't understand why we just don't get to Kate. Because with the dust worn off, we won't be able to see the trolls. Okay, well I already looked in the Book of Shadows, and there's nothing in there about trolls. I know, I'm thinking of piecing together a makeshift spell like... Here. "To See What Can't Be Seen." If we combine that one with the one to cultivate innocence and the power of three spell, it just might work. That's why you're the older sister, you are always thinking. Thank you. All right, I'll work on the spell, why don't you go call Piper, okay? What's the point of that? Isn't she still on the picket line? Yeah, but we can't fight the trolls without her. They're just too fast. We need her to freeze them. You know, we may have wanted her to be with us before - but now we actually need her. - Okay. Hey, watch out for doorways and stuff. Because now that the trolls know that we're helping Kate, they'll do everything they can to stop all three of us. Hey, Piper, your sister's on the phone. Perfect. It's okay, I'll get it, I'll get it. It's all right. - Need a diaper change? - Very funny. Look, we need you to come home right away. By midnight, or else... The tooth fairy is gonna come and harass us all for not flossing? All right, I know you don't believe in fairies, and I'm not asking you to. Then what are you asking? We were trying to distract you before. We were trying to take your mind off Leo, okay? And it was wrong, and I'm sorry for that. But it's not about that anymore, Piper. We are up against something that we cannot fight without you. Trolls? Believe it or don't, but they are sneaky and mean and they're trying to hurt a seven-year-old girl. Hello? Any chance they may have been here? Yeah, one attacked me there earlier, why? Nothing. All right, they know that we're witches. And they will do anything to stop us from helping Kate. All right, all right. I'm on my way. Okay. Well, don't forget to stay out of the... ...tween places. Abbey, have you seen my keys? Aren't they on the hook? No, if they were on the hook, I wouldn't be asking. - Oh, I got it, I got it! - Damn it! Spare key, spare key. Register. Son of a... Oh, are you okay? Would you just do me a favour and close up for me? Oh, yeah sure. Thank you. You better run while you can, you little rodents. I bet you guys think this is real funny, don't you? Haven't you taken enough from me? You have to send trolls to kick me while I'm down? I had a nice normal life once. And you took that from me. You took my boyfriend, you took my life, the least you could do is leave me my freaking car keys! I am a good person. I'm a good witch. And damn it, I would have made a great wife. And how dare you take that from me. I deserve... No, you know what? I demand that you send him back to me. You hear me? Right now! I'm going to stand in this very spot until you send Leo back to me. She said that she was coming, right? What, did you think I just made that part up? No, but it is almost 12, and we still have to go over to Kate's. Well, maybe we should do it without her. Do the best we can. No, I used the power of three spell, it won't work without her. - We can rewrite it. - In six minutes? Do you have a better idea? - Sorry I'm late. - Hey. - Are you okay? - I thought this wasn't about me. Well, it just... You don't really seem like you're very open. I'm as open as I'm gonna get in the next five minutes, so let's just do the damn spell. In this tween time, this darkest hour We call upon the sacred power Three together, stand alone Command the unseen to be shown In innocence, we search the skies Enchanted are our newfound eyes You have really gotta lay off the rhyming, Prue. All right, well, let's just go ring the doorbell. Piper, you freeze Kate's parents so we can get past them, okay? Fine. Whatever. "Fine. Whatever." Prue? Hello? Phoebe? Please answer me. Hello? Phoebe! Phoebe, they're taking Thistle! Okay, why couldn't we see them? Obviously, the spell didn't work. Help me! Oh, no. Where did she go? There is nothing here. Well, she's gotta be here somewhere. She couldn't have just disappeared. Unless the trolls turned her into a fairy? A fairy? Why would they do that? I have no idea. Maybe to punish her for taking Thistle. But we have to find Kate. Okay, come on, give me a premonition. I don't understand. I mean, why couldn't we see the trolls? We've had spells backfire on us before, but never the power of three. It didn't backfire. The spell didn't work because of me. - Piper. - No, it's... It's true. This is all my fault. I just... I wanted to save Kate, I never meant to hurt her. I never meant for this to... Hey, don't blame yourself, okay? I mean, you have every right to be angry. But not at the expense of a little girl. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to believe in anything anymore. I just want him back, Prue. I know. But right now we have to get Kate back, okay? And we're gonna need your help to do that. Damn it. Damn it, damn it! I don't understand. What good is this power if I can't use it when I need it? Phoebe, you have to focus. Oh, Prue, I am focusing, believe me. You're too upset, so take a deep breath and try again. I can't levitate when I want to, I can't premonition... - Guys! - What? I think the spell is working. Do you see it? What's it doing? I think it wants us to follow it. I think he got scared away. Yeah, and I can see why. This looks like the cave from Kate's drawing. First troll I see is in really big trouble. Let's go. Troll central. - What are they doing? - Looks like they're trying to start a fire, although I don't really think that it's for roasting marshmallows. Kate and Thistle. Piper, do you think that you can freeze them from here? I can try. - Piper, freeze them! - They're too fast. - One down. - Oh, Kate! Okay. - Prue, a little help here! - Okay. - Piper, run. - Run? Run where? - Piper, run! - Are you out of your mind? Freeze the flames! Unfreeze. Now. Now, that is just the way I like my trolls, medium well. Hi. Here you guys go. It's okay. There you go. Hey. Hey, you guys, wait up! Thistle, don't you know how to turn Kate back into a person? Kate, you know, you can't stay a fairy, because if you do, your mom will be very sad. You know what? I think I kind of know how you're feeling. When someone you love goes away, it doesn't make any sense, and you feel like the whole world is out to get you. But you know what? Your mom and dad didn't split up to hurt you. Things just happen. Things that you may never understand. But you just have to believe that it's for the best. Even if it doesn't always seem that way. You remember how sad you were when your daddy left? Well, that's how sad everybody's gonna be if you don't come home. Nicely done. Yep. - Ice? - Bed. Who delivers at this hour? I think that this is someone's way of saying thank you. - Oh, here. - Thank you. Well, you're welcome. Oh, they're so pretty. Piper, we... We... - We just... - I know. It's okay. I'm actually beginning to understand why they don't want witches and whitelighters to be together. Marriage is hard enough, you know. But marriage to a whitelighter... He's gotta orb out at all times of the night. And sometimes he's gone for weeks at a time. But honestly, if I'm gonna have a meltdown every time I have no idea where he is... ...then none of us are gonna be able to do our jobs. And if we had lost that little girl tonight... But we didn't. But we could have. And I don't think I could live with that. If that means that I have to give up Leo... ...then I guess that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. - Am I dreaming? - No. I had a dream that you weren't coming back. That wasn't a dream either, was it? No, it wasn't. They had forbidden me from ever seeing you again. But now... I don't know what you said or did, but they said you showed great courage and great faith. Enough to make them reconsider. Does that mean you guys could get married now? What? I wanna know. Not yet. It means they're giving us a chance to prove we can make it work. What do you mean, like probation? Well, if we can show them that our relationship won't get in the way of our work... Then we can stay together. Right. But if anything goes wrong, if we're distracted by each other to the detriment of a single innocent... We won't be. - Are you worried? - When are you going to learn? I'm always worried. I'm relieved that he's back though. I mean not only for Piper but... I know. Unknown unattractive demon on the loose. Let's not tell them till tomorrow. I think that the least that they deserve is one night worry-free romance, don't you? Romance. Turner. Hi. Cole. What are you doing in the office at 2 in the morning? What are you doing calling my office at 2 in the morning? I was just gonna leave you a message. Save you the trouble of having to talk to me. Why would I ever not wanna talk to you? l... I don't know, you know. Just in case you thought I was a drunk or a lunatic or a drunk lunatic. I think I'm gonna go with "mystery." One I'm looking forward to figuring out. Okay. I'm gonna go then and be mysterious. - I'll call you.
