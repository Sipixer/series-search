- We have to think of something. We can't just let them take Wyatt. Incoming! It's pointless to run. You can't have him. You're only delaying the inevitable, I'm afraid. Now, if you don't mind, we have a lot of cleaning to do. No! Leo! Wyatt! An Elder, good. Perhaps you can explain it to her. Explain? Explain what? Well, do something. Don't just stand there. I can't. - Nobody can. - What the hell are you talking about? Please, he's just a baby. It won't happen again. I won't let it happen again. Sorry, we can't take that risk. Don't worry. You won't remember any of this anyway. What are you doing here? I don't know. Better go. What were we talking about? - I don't know. - I'm beat. I'm gonna go up to bed. Yeah, I'm tired too. You all right? Yeah, I just feel like I'm forgetting something. Like what? I don't know. Must not be very important. Say goodbye to yesterday's rain and "Good morning, sunshine." It is a beautiful Wednesday in San Francisco, and if you're like me, you want to forget all about yesterday. I know I do. Thank you very much. Any infomercials for stain remover on there? You have a stain that needs removal? Yes, I spilled coffee on my blouse yesterday, so that dork walking around the office with a big old stain on her shirt, - that'd be me. - Have you tried baking soda? No, it's dry-clean only, so it's gonna eat up a half a day's pay. The pay is lousy, your boss is a sexist pig, why don't you just quit? The job sucks and it's just a temp job anyway. Because, if I want a life outside of magic, I can't just quit every time a job starts sucking. Besides, I stuck around with the dog-walking job, and hey, I wound up helping somebody. Yeah, okay, but that was once. What are the odds of something like that happening again? I don't know. But sometimes they say you gotta ride a lot of different horses on the merry-go-round before you find what you're looking for. Carousel. Sorry? Well, a merry-go-round has lots of animals, a carousel only has horses. Okay, why do you even know that, weirdo? I have no idea. - Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Now it's gone. - Now what's gone? I know this may sound crazy, but I think I just heard a baby. Yeah, you're crazy. Piper! Oh, my God, I heard something. Oh, be quiet. Coming. How long do you think she's gonna spend down there, the rest of her life? Yeah, long enough to be sure she doesn't shove her tongue down the throat of the next delivery guy. I heard that. For your information, we're lucky that guy didn't sue me for sexual harassment. Well, you were channelling his emotions. That's not the point. The point is, I have to figure out how to work my new power, or I'm gonna have to lock myself down in this basement for the rest of my life. Stay behind the yellow line. I might channel what you both are feeling. Sure, would you like me to toss you your breakfast? What happened to your head? This? I don't know. I've been so scattered lately, I must have bumped it or something. Now, are either one of you feeling any strong emotions? Anger? Sadness? Annoyance? - You may proceed. - Thanks. Wait a minute. One of you is feeling insecure. What? I'm just feeling a little off today, that's all. Stop looking at me like that. And you cut the crust off my toast, and cut my eggs into little bits, and look, there's applesauce and milk. Piper, I'm not in second grade. I just thought maybe you'd like some milk, for some strong bones. Okay, what is going on with you, lady? Carousels, hearing babies and now milk for strong bones. Wait, you were hearing babies? Forget it, I'm sure it's nothing. Forget it. - Hey, Elise, how'd you like the...? - You're not getting off that easy. - What? - Just get in here! No, I can't come in today because I am very sick. Yesterday you completely turned the office upside down! Wait, but I didn't come in yesterday. - Yes, you did! - Oh, I did? I don't care if that was a Phoebe Halliwell look-alike, you get your butt in here now or it's your job! - Do you understand? I mean it! - Oh, okay. What was that about? That was Elise. She wants me to come into work ASAP, or it's my job. Your job? Why would she say that? I have no idea. Something about yesterday. Must have bumped my head pretty hard, huh? Well, looks like you're gonna have to brave the big, bad world. - Want me to give you a ride? - No, I'll drive. This way I can get in and out fast. Hey, don't forget your coats. It might rain. Would you stop mothering us, please? Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben. Please hold. Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben. Please hold. Who are you holding for? You wouldn't happen to need any help with anything, would you? Flo, what happened? I just got fired, that's what happened. What? Oh, not you. You call back, or something. I don't understand. Why? You ought to know. No, I don't, and I want to help, believe me, but I can't help unless you tell me, you know, why you were fired. So Mr. Stewick gets me in his office and says, either I go out with him again, or he fires me. I didn't take his offer. So he told me to pack up. My word against his, you know? I would have gone in with you if you asked. I did, I asked you yesterday. Obviously, I don't rank high enough in importance for you to remember. No, no, seriously, I would remember that. Excuse me, do you mind? Back to the phones, Francine. Paige. My name is Paige. Whatever. You're a temp. Do you wanna help people? Sit your pretty ass back down, answer the damn phone. - Hey. - Hey. Leo, hey! I didn't know you were coming here. I can see that. Are you drinking beer? I was gonna pay for that. Chris, what are you doing sitting around here? Aren't you supposed to be getting to know your new charge? Oh, hi, Leo. Okay, look, before you get mad, you're the one who wanted me to have a charge in the first place. - Yeah, to protect her. - Oh, he was using protection. Yeah, I don't think that's what he meant. Are you out of your mind? Aside from this being out of line, it's completely against the rules. Yeah, you're one to talk. Oh, I don't think that's his point. Why don't I just... ...leave you two alone? Look, I was just having a little fun, what's the big deal? It's not like I have anything pressing to do anyway. You don't have anything pressing? Then why exactly did you come back from the future in the first place? I don't know. - I forgot. - You forgot. - Do you hear that? - What? Never mind. We'll talk about this later. Is he gone? I don't care what she says, Phoebe, I always wanted to do what you did, and man, was it good to see you do it! Oh, thanks for your support, Frank. - Hey, Elise, what is going on out...? - Sit. I wanted to talk to you alone before I involved any lawyers. Lawyers? What...? I'm not going to pretend that the only reason you're still working here is that you're an asset to the paper. But what the hell came over you yesterday? Yesterday? Because there are three workers out with injuries. Jackie's got a broken nose! Not to mention... Yeah, that does look like it hurts a lot. It's all I can do to keep lawsuits from pouring in. If there were, perhaps, a reasonable explanation for your behaviour yesterday... Elise, I'm sorry. But I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Phoebe! I'm feeling a lot worse. I gotta go. Okay, here we go. All right, come on, sweetheart. Now, don't be fussy. You hungry? Don't be fussy. Do you want a bottle? You know, if you bounce a little, and make a shushing sound, it usually helps. Hi. Wow, that was amazing. How did you calm him down so fast? Well, the shushing sound supposedly reminds them of the womb. Amazing. You must be a terrific mom to know all this stuff. No, actually, I don't have kids. Really? Guess I just assumed. Oh, well, I always wanted them. I babysat a lot, but... I should go. - My diapers? - Oh, sorry. - Thank you. - Got it? Yep. You okay, sweetheart? Want some chips? Leo. Piper, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? No, that's not what I meant. It's just... - I shouldn't be here. - No, you shouldn't. I mean, I asked you to stay away for a good reason. So that I could learn to live without you. I know. And if you just keep orbing in whenever you feel like it, that's not really gonna help me. You're right. I'm sorry. It's just... Never mind, I should be going. What were you gonna say? Nothing. You haven't by any chance... I know this is gonna sound a little weird. - Been hearing things lately, have you? - Hearing things? - Yeah, you know, like, I could swear a couple times today, I heard a... - A baby? - You too? Pretty strange, huh? - Do you think it means anything? - I don't know. I mean, maybe it's just that we both regret not having children. Which... Why didn't we? I don't know. We both wanted to. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Piper, we need you upstairs! Be right there. You should probably go. But what if you need help? What if it's a demon? Leo, you're not our whitelighter anymore. Chris is. Except he's busy. I gave him another witch to look after yesterday. Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to handle it alone, won't we? So you're saying you started a riot but you don't remember it? Yeah, it must have been how this happened, and why Elise was so mad at me. I thought Elise was just like that. Well, yeah, she kind of is. Hey, you okay? I'm feeling a very emotional vibe from you right now. I'm fine. Stop that. What I don't understand is, if you don't remember the riot, how do you know you started it? I had a vision. And by the way, the vision occurred yesterday. Maybe you were channelling somebody else's anger. Probably, I just don't remember. So you both have events that you can't remember from yesterday. Yeah, there was the riot, and Paige's blouse. And this thing with this girl Flo from work. Did you forget anything? You're asking me to remember what I've apparently forgotten? I don't know. I remember getting up, I remember going downstairs, but the rest is kind of a blur. I think somebody's messing with us. Making us forget. But these all seem like such random moments to forget. Where's the connection? Well, that's why we wrote a spell: To fill in the blanks. We know you might be reluctant because of what happened the last time we cast a spell on your memory... No, you're right. Let's do it. - Really? - Something's going on. The only thing we don't know is what. All right, here we go. "Moments lost make witches wonder Warlocks plot or demons plunder If this is not a prank Help us to fill in the blanks" It's raining. Hey, your Band-Aid's gone. And you're wearing that blouse. Except for I've got no coffee stain. Oh, my God. I remember now. I'm a mom. Today is yesterday. Well, the spell didn't return our memories, it just rewound the day. Yeah, but why? Why else? To help us remember what somebody obviously wants us to forget. Okay, but how could I have possibly forgotten about Wyatt? What could have happened to make that happen? Piper, it's not just you. We were all made to forget about him. And a whole bunch of other things. But I'm his mother, it's my job to protect him and I failed. Don't be ridiculous, you did not fail. Okay, now he's fussing. Come on, sweetie, it's okay. And now I can't get him to stop fussing. Well, you're just feeling insecure. And Wyatt is feeling... ...very, very sad right now. Poor little guy. See, this is why I lock myself in the basement. I am a wreck. Okay, we're kind of against the clock right now. Maybe we should just take it into the other room. - I think that's a good idea. - Okay, bud, here we go. Here we go, okay. Hey, lookie, how about this? You like this guy? Hello. No? Pheebs, a little help here. We hate that toy. It's yucky and crusty and gross. Okay, then what does he want? That. Yeah, see, I am a failure. No, you're not. We just happen to have more pressing concerns right now than the media's influence. Okay? Okay. R-E-D. Okay, sweetie, Mommy will just be in the next room okay? Okay. O-R-A-N-G-E. Orange. G-R-E-E-N. Green. - On the uneven parallel bars... Okay, we remember everything that happened before today, right? Yeah, but... And we're not gonna remember everything unless we do something. Paige, don't be impatient with me. I'm feeling so much today, I don't need this too. Okay, all I'm saying is, whatever caused us to forget is gonna happen next. We just have to relive this day and see where it leads. Yeah, but if we're not careful, where it leads will be right back where we started, without Wyatt. Except we know something is gonna happen to him, so all we have to do is look for clues, keep our eyes open and stop it. How are we supposed to know what's important? It's all important because it's all connected to Wyatt, so we just have to see the connection. So you're supposed to go to your temp job and wait for coffee to be spilled on you? Yeah, exactly. So much for my life outside of magic. Now, you, you have got to go to work... Start a riot and get a cut on my head and lose my job? No, thank you. You have to. It's the only way to save Wyatt. So I guess I'm supposed to stay home... Wyatt? How did those open? Must have been the wind. But they were locked. Could be a clue, let's remember it. - You gonna be okay here by yourself? - Do I have a choice? Wanna switch with me? Okay, just call us if anything weird happens. You're kidding, right? I don't have time for another charge. - Why not? - Because I just don't. Why do you want me to oversee another witch, anyway? Because I want to see what you can do, what you can handle. Oh, please, you just don't want me around the sisters all the time because you don't trust me. Chris, protecting charges is what we do. And besides, when I was a whitelighter, I had other charges. Leo, I didn't come all the way from the future to protect and oversee other charges. I came for one reason, and one reason only. - To protect Wyatt. - Yeah. From some demon who will attack in the future but you're not sure which one. Hey, man, fine, whatever. Don't believe me. All I'm saying is, there is no way I'm taking on another charge and that's... ...that. - Hi, Leo, sorry I'm late. - It's okay. You must be Chris. I'm Natalie. Maybe just one more. Phoebe, thank God you came in. The server crashed and we lost your column. - Do you have a hard copy? - I'll check in my office. It's not what you did, Elise, it's how you did it. Well, lucky I'm editor. I don't care what you think. - Don't think we're done here, mister! - Screw you, Elise! You think that's funny, huh? Hold it! Wait! Don't! Stay calm, just stay calm. Just, you know, tell me what happened. Mr. Stewick has been asking me out ever since I got here. - Okay, so you went on a date. - Well, if you could call it a date. He tried to grab my ass, I threw a drink in his face. I have avoided him ever since. I'm so stupid! I shouldn't have gone out with him in the first place. Okay, so tell me what happened next. Next. Next, he wants me to meet him in his office tomorrow morning, bright and early. He says it's official. I need this job, but I'm afraid to face him alone. Do you think you could come with me? Of course, absolutely. I don't know how I could forget this. Forget what? Oh, nothing. Well, this is just so typical of my luck with men. I mean, not that you need to hear me complain but... Oh, hey, watch out. - Coffee. - I am so sorry. L... - It's okay. - It's just, something... ...weird just flew by the window. It's... Something, something what? Spit it out, spit it out. Well, to be honest with you, it looked a little like a... ...a dragon. A dragon. Oh, that is so not good. All right, sweetie, come on. Mommy's gotta find something to make sure nothing happens to you. Here. Look, look, look. Right, you hate this. You hate this. Okay, I'm sorry. Did I forget how to be a mommy too? Wyatt, what are you doing? Wyatt. Oh, my God! You son of a bitch! Phoebe! No! Phoebe! No! Snap out of it! Oh, no, did I do all this? Forget all that, we gotta get out of here. Phoebe, I figured out what we're supposed to be remembering. I'd be happier just forgetting, I think, at this point. No, no, you wouldn't. Phoebe, there's a dragon loose in the city! Did you say dragon? Come on. Wyatt, you're making Mommy very nervous. What are we doing here? What is it? - What's up? - Where are you? Where am I? I'm standing outside of the Presidio tunnel where your nephew just orbed me. What did you just say? He did what? Are you out of your mind? Aren't you afraid of exposure? Yeah, that's why we called. What do you mean? What are you talking about? I think she's talking about that. Police here at the tunnel are saying it's a miracle no one was hurt although three cars were destroyed. They haven't ruled out terrorism, of course, but at the moment, they are focusing on some rather bizarre reports of a giant bird, which one witness went on record as saying: "Shot fire out of its mouth at cars, like a dragon." Well, as far as clues go, I'd say that's a pretty huge one, wouldn't you? - Sorry. - No, it's not my pain I'm reacting to, it's your pain. Oh, well, then you should be feeling a little irritated then too. Piper, why are you blaming yourself? It's not your fault. Okay, number one, I haven't actually verbalized guilt yet. So in the future, let me confess before you analyse. Right. Secondly, it is my fault because I'm the one that plopped Wyatt in front of the electronic babysitter. - Any idea what she's talking about? - No, not a clue. You want some clues, try this one on for size. Before you left, Wyatt was watching a TV show about... Wait for it... . Dragons. Oh, he was watching a kid show. Well, apparently he magically changed the channel. Of course, that was before he magically orbed me to the tunnel - to find his new friend. - He did all of that? Wait a second. So you're saying Wyatt conjured a dragon. Yep, right out of the TV. Oh, you must be so proud! - Yeah, or a little irritated. - Right. Okay, if this is true, your little boy is developing some serious powers. Yeah, the kind that unleashes Godzilla on an unsuspecting city. How am I supposed to handle this? Well, at least now we know how we lost our memories. I mean, obviously, anything connected to the dragon, no matter how remote, was erased. You know, what, coffee stains, riots. The question is by whom? Come on, you guys. So Wyatt made a little magical mess. - We've dealt with worse, we'll fix it. - Perhaps we can help. - Who are you? - We're known as the Cleaners. - And we're here to help. - The Cleaners? When magic is exposed, we're the ones who cover it up, remove all evidence. Erase any memories, whatever is necessary. You're the ones who are going to take Wyatt. Well, we won't have to if you can eliminate the exposure risk. Exposure? You're here to take my son away, you son of a bitch! I understand your anger. Now you need to understand our position. We're a neutral party. We exist only to protect magic. To that end, your son has become... a problem. - Easy. - However, based upon your past success in covering up your own magic, we've decided to give you a chance... One chance only. ...to take care of the problem yourselves before it gets out of hand. And if we can't? Then we'll have to take care of it for you. You can't make us forget everything. There may be some distant echoes that remain, maybe a sense of dÃ©jÃ¡ vu here and there, but like most people, you'll just pass it off as absent-mindedness and move on. - Well, we're not like most people. - It won't matter. Clean it up. Or we will. At least now we know what happened. Too bad we just won't remember any of it. All right, I think we have the upper hand on this one, don't we? I mean, we know that we're recalling the same day, they obviously don't. None of this is gonna help unless we can eliminate Wyatt's dragon. - Piper. - Go to the Book, work on the dragon. Do not take your eyes off Wyatt. Where are you going? To call a higher power. Leo! Leo, I know you can hear me. I know I told you to go away, but I really need you. Wyatt's in trouble! What do you mean? What happened? There's no time, just tell me how to stop the Cleaners. The Cleaners? Are they after him? Yeah. What the hell happened? Well, he conjured a little dragon. Piper, how could you let that happen? How could I let that happen? You take off and suddenly I'm responsible for every little thing? This is not a little thing. Yeah, well, where the hell were you? Why weren't you watching over his every move up there on your lofty perch? Okay, that's not what I meant. Then don't say it, because I'm beating myself up enough about this and I don't need you beating me up too. Sorry. I'm just scared. Yeah, so am I. That's why I called you. Because I'm about to lose our son and I don't know what to do. So please help me! - Piper, if I could... - No. Don't say it, don't say anything about Elders or rules, because you know what? He is your son, Leo. There are no rules. I'm telling you, the Cleaners are empowered by both good and evil. - You can't stop them. - There has to be a way. You don't understand, there isn't. Cleaners have the power to rewrite history, you can't fight that. No, you don't understand! I can't do this! I cannot lose Wyatt too! Piper, you weren't put in this position to lose Wyatt, which means there is a way, you just have to find it. - But how? - I don't know. But if anybody can find it, you can. You know, maybe it's not a magical solution. Maybe it's... ...maternal. Deep down inside, you can find it. I know you can. Hey, you all right? I don't know. Ask me again when this is all over. - Was Leo any help? - I'm not sure yet. Anything on the dragon? No, dragons predate the Book. One thing I do know is that we're gonna have to get a tooth, scale, some piece of him in order to make the vanquishing potion even work. Yeah, we're just kind of winging it, making the most powerful potion that we can. - Phoebe? - What happened? Are you all right? I am, but someone's not. Actually a bunch of people aren't. People? Like people out there, people? I don't know. All I know is I've never felt such pain and fear before in my life. - Is it the dragon? - Grab the potion. Wyatt, sweetie, come on. Remember your friend, Mr. Dragon? What do you say we find the dragon? Look out! Look out! Get out of here! Get... Get back in here! Get down! Run! Hurry, come on! Help! Help! God, it looks like a war zone. Oh, God, looks like it made a nest. Let's hope it's not laying any eggs. Think you can steal a scale for the potion? I'll try. Scale! - I think I woke it up. - No, I think you pissed it off. Okay, if you're sensing any fear, it would be mine. - I think we should go. - Wait. - Wait for what? - Wyatt. Piper, what are you doing? No time to explain, just make sure he sees me. Piper, come back! Come on, you fire-breathing lizard, come and get me! - Piper, are you nuts? - Stay there. We have to stop her. I think I know what she's doing. Come on, Wyatt, don't let Mommy down. Piper! I'm okay. I'm okay. Hi, little man, you did it! I knew you could do it. Good job. Okay, I'm confused. What just happened? That was the greatest power there is. A mother-and-child bond. Especially when that child is Wyatt. So you're saying he vanquished the dragon, and you knew he was gonna do it. Well, I was hoping he wouldn't want anything bad to happen to me. Okay, well that solved that problem. Now what do we do with this mess? - We'll figure it out. - No, actually, you won't. Wait, we did what you asked, we got rid of the dragon. But not the exposure risk. - The boy. - No, you can't. We don't have much time, they're gonna follow us. - How do we stop them? - We have to think of something. We can't just let them take Wyatt. Incoming! I will not lose him. No! Don't worry. You won't remember any of this anyway. Do you remember? Absolutely everything. The spell must have worked. But not for Wyatt. He's gone. Nothing. I can't find the Cleaners anywhere. Well, they have to exist somewhere, don't they? Not necessarily. Not even on our plane, not even in our time. Maybe we should just summon them. - And then what? - I don't know. Maybe we should call Leo again. I don't think he can help more than he already has. - How did he help last time? - By reminding me that I can do this. You know, maybe we are going about this all wrong. Maybe instead of trying to stop them, we should be trying to get them to stop us. You lost me. Well, when magic is exposed, - it's their job to clean it up, right? - Yeah, so? So why can't we expose our magic and force them to deal with us? Yeah, but if we do that, what's to stop them from erasing us? They wouldn't dare. So let's give them something to clean up. The Doppler radar for the Bay Area shows us that storm is already on its way out. So looks like San Francisco is finally gonna get some good news. Those scattered showers overnight turning partly sunny by morn... - Whoa! What the...? - Hi. How you doing? Why don't we get a skycam view of that, shall we? Help! Get me down from here! Don't... Don't let go! Don't let go! I don't know what's happening here, l... Well, it's called magic, Kaneisha. Witchcraft, specifically. I really love your jacket! Want to see more magic? Let's check in with Piper at the Golden Gate Bridge. Take it away, Piper! Let the object of objection Become but a dream As I cause the scene To become unseen You might want to take an alternate route to work in the morning. Not so bad. You should get out more often. Yeah, Pheebs, time to come out of the basement. Maybe you're right. What do you think you're doing? Are you out of your minds? Oh, hey, hi. Did you see our little magic act? How is it you still have your memory? Oh, I think we still have a few surprises that you don't know about. Yeah, and if you don't return our nephew, you might found out about just a few more. This is pointless. Whatever you do, we'll simply erase. - Or we'll erase you. - You can't. Not if you're truly neutral, that is. Because, you see, if you get rid of us, you tip the balance of power from good to evil. And now, that's hardly being neutral, now is it? You will give me my son back. Or I swear to you, the only thing you will be doing for the next 50 years, is cleaning up after us. If we do return him, how do you know you'll be able to control him? I'm his mother. If anybody can, I can. Everything is as it was. We've erased all evidence of your son's magic. - We'll leave him in your care. - For now. Oh, one more thing. Please, if you could just do me a little, teensy-weensy little favour and erase that whole riot I caused at the office. Because I don't want to lose my job. That would really suck. Might throw off that balance thing because I'd be distracted, you know. It's done. Good luck. Because, believe me, you're going to need it. You're okay. I'm so happy to see you. - Don't smash him. - I'm so happy to see you. I can't help it, this is just very exciting. He's back. We're back. Coffee stain and all. Yeah, what are you gonna do about your job, are you gonna keep it? Yeah, I think I will, just so I can see what happens next. Exactly what are you saying? Unless you make it worth my while... ...I may find your performance here... ...lacking. Mr. Stewick, please, I need this job. And that is why I'm giving you an opportunity to keep it. If you catch my meaning. Absolutely. You know, I like a man who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to ask for it. Now are you afraid to come get it? You mean, right here and now? Yeah? - Yeah, hold my calls, please. - Yes, Mr. Stewick. Flower pot! Oh, Paige, I thought you were... What happened? Well, you see, I overheard Mr. Stewick threatening you. He'll be real lucky if you don't sue. Just go with it. Thanks, Paige, for whatever you just did for me in here. I was wondering why I took this job, and now I know. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. I didn't know you were coming here. What are you still doing here, Chris? Shouldn't you be getting to know your new charge? Yeah, about that. I'm... I'm going back to what I originally said. I don't have time for her. - Chris. - Leo, I mean it. Because whether you believe me or not, I'm here to protect Wyatt. Not other charges. Other than the sisters, of course.
