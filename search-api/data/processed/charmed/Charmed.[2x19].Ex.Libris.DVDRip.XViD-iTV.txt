I was supposed to have the house to myself tonight. God, I thought that that was tomorrow night. No, I put it on the kitchen calendar way in advance. That's why Phoebe's at the library, and you're supposed to be out on assignment. Yeah, well, I was all day. I was just downstairs in the basement developing these shots that I took. Actually, I was hoping to get your opinion on them. But I guess now wouldn't be a good time, would it? No. - Although, Leo's not really here yet. - All right, make it fast. Okay. All right, so the magazine asked me to capture faces in the city. So I went to the Haight and I took these shots, - but look at this man. - Yeah, so? So he is in every single one of my pictures. I mean, I didn't really focus on him. I didn't even notice him until I got home. But, I mean, there he is in all of them, just hanging out. - Well, maybe he's homeless. - Handing out flyers? I don't think so. And look at his face. I mean, he looks so sad and determined. Okay, bye-bye. All right, so I'm gonna go now, and I'll be downstairs and work all night long. And I'll be really quiet. You don't have to worry about me. - Okay. - So no sex without safe sex. - Thanks. - Okay. By the way, on the kitchen counter, there's a birthday card for Dad if you wanna sign it. I don't. Night, Leo. Good night. That's weird. I wonder why she doesn't wanna sign... Hi. You wanna sit down? Why don't we go upstairs, since she's downstairs? Okay. I know a faster way. - You do? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - I won't tell if you won't. - Hey. Hi, I'm Phoebe. - I'm Charlene. Actually, we've met, we even carpooled. Metaphysics 301, remember? That's right. And your dad is the professor of that class, right? Yeah, he's a dirty rat. He gave me a C. We don't get along, in anything, even metaphysics. But I'm hoping that will change. I'm gonna finish my thesis, get published. He'll finally have to take me seriously. Run quick, before I start telling you about my mother. No, it's okay. I've been studying here for so long, it's nice to have someone to talk to. So, what's your thesis about? It's about the existence of demons in our world. - Demons? - Yeah, I've been researching for five years to prove they're not just myths, like my dad thinks. That they actually really exist. I've got proof right here. - That's very interesting. - But you believe in them, don't you? I mean, you seemed to in class. Certainly knew a lot about them. It's really late, and I really gotta go. Okay. It was really nice talking to you, Charlene. - Take care, okay? - Okay, see you around. - Bye. - Bye-bye. I'm sorry. You scared me. Wait. Hey, Piper. Will you do me a favour and feed the cat? I wanna get down to the Haight, you know. I wanna see if that guy is still on the bus bench. You know, I just could not stop thinking about him all night. I mean, there's no guarantee that he'll actually be there, but if he is, I wanna get a better shot. Prue. - What...? What are you doing in here? - Piper, can you hand me a towel? - Prue. - Leo. Nice orbs. Okay, bye. Bye. Out. Let me help you, let me help you. All right. Go on, sicko. Phoebe. It's 8:00. It's 8:00. I'm late for my finals. Phoebe, relax. It's Thursday. Your finals are tomorrow. - It's Thursday? - Yes. Today is Thursday. You sure? Okay, that's really good news. Please tell me you didn't do another all-nighter. - I can't. - Phoebe. What? Piper, what am I supposed to do? - Hi, Leo. - Hey. If I don't ace this final, I'm gonna flunk out of school because of all the demon-hunting interruptions. Still, Phoebe, you have to take care of yourself. Get some rest. After. Piper, I did not go back to college to fail at it, okay? So, what do I have to do? Okay, I'm gonna go change, and then I'm gonna go to the library. Now, if any demon or warlock attacks, please, just fend them off till Saturday. I have a question for you. Is it possible for someone to find proof that demons really do exist? I don't know, maybe. But even if anybody did, nobody would ever know about it. - What do you mean? - Evil doesn't want anybody to know. It has a system for covering its tracks, protecting its identity. That's why demons disappear when you guys vanquish them. Why do you ask? Just curious. - Okay, ad√≠os. - Wait, Phoebe. Don't you wanna sign Dad's birthday card? Why? He never sends me one. She's right. He doesn't to any of us. So why do I keep trying? - I'm just a sucker for punishment? - No. You keep trying because you never give up hope. That's one of the things I love about you. You never gave up on us. Were you close to your dad? Well, that was a long time ago. Different lifetime. I prefer to focus on the present. So do I, which means I have to go. I have a dentist appointment. - How long can you stay? - Till they call. If they don't call before lunch, why don't you meet me at the club? - I'll buy. - You'll have to. Whitelighter pay sucks. Hi. My name's Prue Halliwell. Cleavant Wilson. I'm a photographer with 415 magazine. I'd like to know if it's okay if I take your picture. - Why? - We're doing a feature called "Faces in the City," and I would love to include yours. I'm not interested. Although, I would appreciate it if you would include this one. "Tyra L. Wilson." My daughter. She was murdered six and a half months ago here waiting for the bus. I'm looking for a witness. That's why you were sitting here all day yesterday. That's why I'm here every day. I have been since the police quit on us. I'm not leaving until I find somebody who saw what happened. How can you be sure that you will? I will. I have to be sure. So are you gonna print that or not? Actually, it's not really up to me. I'm just looking for a witness. Just looking for a witness. Sir, I'm looking for a witness. You don't have to be afraid to come forward. - What? - You two must've been very close. She was my daughter. It doesn't get any closer. You know, I have a friend, a really good friend, who's an inspector. You know, maybe I can call them, see if they have any ideas who did it. I know who did it. The punk that owns that pawnshop across the street, Gibbs. He killed my little girl. - Why? - Wrong place, wrong time. Everybody knows he did it. Problem is, he's got everyone too afraid to talk. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! All right, you first. What the hell is going on here? Don't ask me, he came in here punching. Dan did? Well, what did you do to him? - What did I do? Nothing. - Come on. He had to have a reason. Like losing you isn't enough reason. All right, back to your position. Go on. You kidding me? He's about to clock me. I'm sorry, I can't help you with that. Let's go. Let's go. Piper, where did you come from? I'll be asking the questions. What the hell is going on? - I don't know, why don't you ask him? - I did... I mean, I will. I'm asking you first. - You know what? I just gotta go. - Dan, wait. Oh, no, you don't. They can wait. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Leo. Agent Cucushny, at this time, we need you to return to homequarters. Excuse me. Excuse... Darryl. Don't tell me. Demons, right? Or is it warlocks this time? - What are you talking about, Darryl? - You're not here because of this? No, Darryl, contrary to popular belief, not every crime in the city is demonically related. Or Halliwell-related, for that matter. I was on my way to the library. - What happened? - College student. She was decapitated and her body was dumped here. College student. Any idea who? Charlene Hughes. Charlene. You know her? I saw her last night in the library. Hey, Phoebe. Do you have an aspirin? I have a splitting headache. Charlene. You're supposed to be... I'm supposed to be what? Okay, just tell Dan that I called again, okay? No, believe me, he knows what it's about. Thank you. - They're both ducking me. - Who both? - What happened in here? - Dan and Leo. I found them in here beating the crap out of each other and neither one of them will tell me why. Well, I hate to top that, but I am dealing with a ghost who doesn't know she's a ghost. She thinks she's still alive. Charlene, she's a student that I know, or knew. The police found her body behind the library, about 20 feet away from her head. So I went back to the library, and I saw her ghost. You know? And I tried to tell her, but I just couldn't. You're right. Yours tops mine. I just don't get it. How could someone not know that they're dead? Well, it takes them a while to accept it, to get over the shock. Why today of all days? I have got to study. Hey, I know. Maybe you could help me out with this one, and then I could take the next two ghosts, okay? Nice try, Pheebs, but you know how this works. That ghost came to you for a reason, and more than likely it's to get justice for her murder so she can move on. The other thing, I think a demon actually killed her. Oh, and you were gonna pawn this off on me. Well, no, I was gonna tell you about the demon part sooner or later. But remember what Leo said about evil covering up its tracks? I think that's what happened to Charlene. She was convinced that she found proof that demons really do exist. Well, then you have to get her to tell you what that proof was. But first you're gonna have to tell her that she's dead. I know. That's the problem. How do you tell someone that their life is over? Darryl. See, I knew I was right the first time. You guys don't give me nearly enough credit. Credit? First Phoebe, now you. I've learned by now that if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck... Okay, Darryl, what are you talking about? Demons. You're here to tell me one got Charlene, right? Okay, number one, I have no idea who Charlene is. Number two, I'm here to talk about Cleavant Wilson's daughter, Tyra. Tyra? She wasn't killed by demons. No, but you guys have an idea of who killed her, right? Yeah, we got a pretty good idea. - Just a pretty good idea? - All right, a very good idea. - Why are you so interested? - Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. I just... I'm drawn to him for some reason and usually that means to help. Unless you can magically turn up a witness, I doubt there's anything you can do. - You can't, right, magically? - No, if I could do that, Darryl, Cleavant wouldn't be out there giving up his life trying to find one. You really wanna help? Convince him to give up trying. Help him to move on. No one is ever going to testify against Gibbs. - We have been down that road. - He is never gonna give up, Darryl. His daughter was his entire life. And why are you guys so okay with giving up? Look, Gibbs owns that street, okay? Tyra was probably gunned down because she saw something he didn't want her to see. And short of us finding a witness or him walking up on the street and confessing... ...there's nothing I can do. Maybe there's something I can do. I got your messages. All eight of them. So you wanna tell me what the fight was about? Actually, I was hoping Leo would, but I gather he hasn't. He's unreachable, apparently. You know, this is very awkward for me. I don't wanna come across as the jealous ex, but that's not what this is about. That's why I went to Leo first. But, see, I started it. I came at him very hard with this, and... With what? Do you remember my brother-in-law who works for the State Department? When I asked him about Leo? Well, he found something wasn't right with Leo's Army records. - Dan... - I know. I asked him not to go any deeper about this, okay? But he did. And he sent me this anyway, something very unusual. Leo isn't who he says he is. But what you do with this is all up to you. You know, I'm... I'm still here for you. I'm still your friend. What? Leo's married? Yeah, there's even a picture of her in his Army file being presented his Purple Heart after he died. She's pretty. Her name is Lillian. Prue, why didn't he tell me about her? Why would he hide that from me? I don't know. You have to ask him. Well, I'd love to, but he's conveniently out of the calling area at the moment. Leave it to me to fall in love with an angel who happens to be married. Maybe he didn't tell me about her because he's still in love with her. No, come on. How do you know she's even still alive? Well, I sort of did a little Internet search. I was thinking maybe I should go have a chat with her. No, Piper, I don't really think that that's a very good idea. But speaking of chats, I need to go and talk to this pawnshop guy before he closes, okay? So we'll talk later? Yeah. Okay. We're closed. - Well, it's only a quarter... - I said, we're closed. Get the hell out of here. You know, you don't scare me. Well, then you're stupid, lady. And stupid people don't last long in this neighbourhood. Ask around. Are you threatening me? What, are you a reporter? You work for the DA's office, what? You know, I seen you over there talking to that dead kid's old man. - I know what you want. - Is that right? Yeah, and you ain't getting it. Nobody's gonna mouth on me. Nobody. You're just wasting your time. And you're trespassing. You know, it must be something living off of other people's pain. I hope it doesn't come back to haunt you. If you saw anything, I'd appreciate it. - Appreciate your help. - All right. Phoebe. Sorry. I didn't mean to spook you. So to speak. Charlene, how are you feeling? Do you feel any different? My headache. I guess. Yeah. I mean, I just feel kind of weird in general. I think that's to be expected. I think she's mad at us. Why don't we go over here so we can talk and not disturb anybody. Is something wrong, Phoebe? Yes, Charlene, actually, there is something wrong. I think that the reason that you've been feeling so weird lately is because you're... You're a ghost. - Excuse me? - Yeah, I know that this sounds crazy, and it's probably really hard for you to accept, but think about it, Charlene. When was the last time you ate something? Or were hungry, for that matter. Or slept. I mean, are you tired right now, Charlene? - Are you even tired? - What are you saying? I'm saying that I think a demon killed you last night. That's what I am trying to say. And the only reason I can see you is because I'm a witch, and I'm supposed to help you. I think you're the one who needs help, not me. Look, you don't believe me? Try picking something up. Now, you know as well as I do that neophyte ghosts cannot channel their anger into moving material objects. Try picking up a book. See for yourself. This is ridiculous. I am not dead. I've got a full life ahead of me, and I will finish my thesis, and I will be published. Charlene. Charlene, wait. - Anybody here? - In here. Hey. Good, I was looking for that. Wait, what are you doing with the Book? I'm looking for the demon that's gonna kill me. I just love getting those premonitions. Okay, what premonition? When? About an hour ago, right after I was trying to tell Charlene that she's dead. I'm lost. Oh, sorry. Wrong sister. Okay, Cliffs Notes version: She is a student who found proof that demons really do exist. And this demon right here, Libris, chopped off her head and dumped her body behind the library because of it. There are a whole bunch of Libris demons out there. Wherever humans have the potential to find unequivocal proof of the existence of demons. Yeah, talk about your conspiracy theories. Well, you just have to stop doing whatever it is you're doing. I can't. Charlene's spirit can't move on unless I get justice for her murder. So, what, by getting murdered yourself? Well, hopefully not. On the bright side, I won't have to suffer through flunking college. - So how was your day? - Not as bad as yours, but it's gonna get a hell of a lot better as soon as I find the truth spell. What do you need that for? To catch a murderer who thinks he can get away with it. So you're gonna use the truth spell to make him confess? - Exactly. - Not exactly. Prue, you can't do that. We can't use our powers to punish the guilty. We learned that lesson the hard way, remember? Yeah, but it's not the same thing, Pheebs. I mean, I'm helping a father with his grieving. I'm helping him to move on. It's more like protecting the innocent. No, it's not, honey. Phoebe, I see this man on the bus bench every single day, and he's just waiting there, hoping. Why was I drawn to him if I can't help him nail his daughter's killer? - Why were you drawn to him? - The look on his face, the pain. The pain of a father's loss? Maybe. I mean, I can't help thinking about Dad, and wondering if it hurts him as much not having his daughters in his life. - I think it does. - Yeah, I wish I thought so too, but, you know, I keep on bumping up against this whole theory that if it hurt him so much, where is he? Phoebe. - Charlene. That's Charlene. - You were right about me. I went home, saw the folks crying, then I knew it was true. I've never seen my dad cry before. Not over me anyway. Then I got pissed. If a demon did this to me, I wanna get him. I wanna prove he doesn't exist anymore. - Your friend, obviously? - Yeah, the dead one. Leo's Purple Heart. He was a special man. He always went out of his way to try and help somebody, even before he shipped out. He was studying to be a doctor, you know. - Yes, I know. - He'd have been a great one too. You know, he had the most marvellous touch. It was gentle, sensitive... - Healing. - Yes, exactly. A healing touch. That was Leo. And they said that he was doctoring a wounded soldier when it happened. I'll never forget when they came to give me that news. It sounds like you still love him. I'll always love Leo, in a certain way, for so many things, including helping me to move on. Move on. How'd he do that? Well, one night, not long after he died, Leo came to me in a dream, and he was bathed in the most brilliant white light that you could ever imagine. He said I was not to worry about him, that he was in a good place. He also said that I was to let him go, that there was another love out there for me to find. - Another love? - Yes. Another doctor, as it turned out. A wonderful man. He gave me two wonderful children, grandchildren, even a great-grandchild. Leo was right. Well, I think I've taken up enough of your time. But you haven't found what you came for yet. Actually, I think I have. It was very nice to meet you, Lillian. You too, Piper. So I was walking down the aisle, and I heard strange voices, whispers, sounded like Latin. And then I went to pull out a book, and... I don't know. It all went dark, until I was back in the library again with that terrible headache. You didn't get a chance to see the demon? - Don't remember. - All right, well, if it was Libris, he must've grabbed her in the aisle and taken her somewhere to: - Sorry. - That's okay. I'm over the shock. You know, the question is, how did he grab her? And this vanquishing spell isn't gonna do us much good if we can't catch him first. Well, we're gonna have to do it in the library if we're gonna keep that premonition from coming true. Maybe I can retrace Charlene's steps and that'll bring him out into the open. - Phoebe. - And just before he grabs me, you and Piper can use your powers to stop him, and then we can vanquish him, easy as that. - No, that is way too risky. - How is it risky with two witches and a ghost to back me up? Prue, help me get my demon, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you get yours. - I'm home. - Come on. - Where are we going? - We'll explain on the way. - Who's that? - Let's go. Let's go. That's my dead friend. Last thing I wrote was under "Demonic Acts." - There. - You know, this is pretty accurate. You were really onto something here. Obviously. Sorry. - Okay, what was next? - I went to find the encyclopaedia. This way. There's the book. I don't hear any voices. Okay, here it goes. Maybe demons can see ghosts. Phoebe! Where is she? Where did she go? No! - What, the basement? - Worth a try. Demon, hide your evil face Libris die, and leave no trace Thank God. Okay. All right. - That was close. - Yeah. Thank God you're a quick study. At least justice was served. So I guess that means I'm moving on. Bye, Phoebe. Thank you for this. Thank you for helping me. You're welcome. Take care. Why am I not moving on? I have no idea. I thought you said all we have to do is get justice for Charlene's murder? - I said, maybe that is all you had to do. - You did not say maybe. - Yes, I did. I absolutely did. - I did not hear the word maybe. Yes, I did. You guys aren't helping. Are you sure that vanquishing spell really worked? - Maybe Libris isn't really gone. - You know, you're getting good at that. I'm just frustrated, that's all. I told you she was a quick study. Maybe Charlene's right, maybe you didn't vanquish him, - like the Demon of Illusion. - No, he is definitely gone. I mean, the spell was specifically written for Libris. Yeah, and he wouldn't have left his sickle behind if he were still alive. But the question still remains: If justice was served, then what is she still doing here? Damn it! Sorry. Wait a minute. - That's it. - What? What is it? Maybe she has to get justice for somebody else. Who's there? Gibbs. You really think you're tough with that gun, don't you? "Tyra." - What the hell's going on? - You wanna know what's going on? - Who are you? - Who do you think I am? So how does it feel to be pushed around? Murderer. I'm the woman you murdered. Leave me alone! Admit it. Admit you killed me, or I will haunt every minute of every day of the rest of your miserable life. Okay, okay! Okay, I did it. I killed you. - Say it. Say my name, damn it! - Tyra Wilson! Tyra Wilson! I killed Tyra Wilson, I admit it! I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that, Gibbs. - Did you get that? - I got every word. - What the hell is this? - Justice. What's the matter, Gibbs, you look like you've seen a ghost? I hope you rot in hell. How's this connected to Charlene again? It's a cosmic thing, Darryl. Don't worry about it. Are you okay, Mr. Wilson? Yeah, I guess. It's an empty feeling, though. You know, it... This doesn't bring her back, it doesn't take away the hurt. No, but at least you can move on with your life. Tyra would've wanted that. I wish I could tell her how much I love her just one more time. I think she'll get the message. Thank you... ...for however you made this happen. Thank you. Well, even if I could never seem to please my own father, at least I could please someone else's. I know what you mean. I think it's time. Hey. Ask me how I did on my final. - How did you do on your final? - Oh, thank you for asking. I aced it. They just posted the grades. - Good for you. - Thanks. Although, I did get some perspective on the test. After what happened to Charlene, it just didn't seem important anymore. Speaking of perspective, I signed Dad's card. - Really? - Yes. Just in case he thinks of us too. No, I definitely don't need to sign that. I mean, I realize that Dad is never gonna be the father that Cleavant is, and I just need to accept that and stop thinking that magically he's somehow gonna change. Excuse me. How'd you get in? I thought whitelighter pay sucked. I sort of didn't tell the bouncer I don't work here anymore. Imagine that. Like you sort of didn't tell me you were married? Look, Piper, I didn't tell you, because I didn't want you to get upset. And it was literally a different lifetime for me, one that has nothing to do with this one, with us. I know that, and I'm not mad, but you can't not tell me stuff because you think it might hurt. If we're gonna have a normal relationship, at least as normal as possible, then you need to be honest with me. You're right. I'm sorry. - Forgive me? - I'll think about it. So how much do you think
