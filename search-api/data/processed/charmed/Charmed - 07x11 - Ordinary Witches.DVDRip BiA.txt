- So, what's the problem? - Burning toast. - What? The toast, it's burning. Now, see, there's a question. Your Avatar friends are promising this big, bright future. Will there be burning toast? - Piper, be serious. - I am. They say they're gonna rid the world of evil, bring about a better way. What else are they gonna get rid of? Nothing else. We had this conversation. Yeah, I know, but... They answered all your questions. - Still, I... - What more do you need to know? If you'd let me finish a damn sentence, I'd tell ya. The more I think about the whole thing, the more it worries me. No, save the pitch. I've heard it. I'm not saying it doesn't sound great. Obviously it does, after everything we've been through. But... - But? - But it's a huge decision. It's one thing to save the world from evil every week. It's another thing entirely to change the world just because we can. Isn't that a little cocky? No. In this case, it's a leap of faith. One that I'm willing to fight for because I have faith in the Avatars. Yeah, but not everyone else has reached your level of faith yet. Is that the front door? Phoebe? Paige? That's odd. Did you leave that open? No, I orbed in. You son of a bitch! That was close. Too close. That's the second time he's tried to kill you, Leo. We need to do something about this. Well, I'm not gonna do anything until you unfreeze Piper. I can't keep lying to her. Watch out! - What are they doing here? - Saving his life. This vial contains an ancient potion that kills Avatars, Piper. Which means that someone must have told Agent Brody that Leo is one of us now. Paige. What do you want from me? I'll kill her later. Make no mistake, Piper, this is a serious matter, one that demands our immediate attention. If one of us were to die, it could weaken the collective. We might not be able to implement the change. You should have thought of that before you killed Brody's parents. - Piper. - What? That's why he views them as a threat. That's what he thinks. Do you... ...view us as a threat, Piper? Actually, I'm still working on that one. We didn't kill his parents. That's not what we're about. She'll discover what we're about in her own time as Phoebe already has. But we are running out of time. Agent Brody is not the only problem that we face. Even as we speak, the demon Zankou is mobilising the Underworld to try and stop us as well. If you truly desire a life beyond good and evil, Piper... ...we're going to need your help... ...which means... ...you'll need to decide quickly. What happened, huh? What'd you do? Kyle, wait, listen to me. No, you don't understand! That was the last potion! You have no idea what you just did. So you see why I'm having a little problem with the faith thing, right? Paige! What? What's going on? Oh, you know, nothing. Your boyfriend tried to kill my husband. I told Kyle you were an Avatar at breakfast. He seemed okay with it. You should have warned us you were gonna tell him. I would have if I would have known what he was gonna do. - Not that I can blame him. - Excuse me? I mean, not the whole killing you thing, obviously. But his parents were killed by the Avatars. The Avatars weren't responsible. How do you know? Were you there, Leo? No, but now that I'm an Avatar, I can tell you they wouldn't do that. Kyle thinks otherwise, and he happened to be there. Paige, in all fairness, he was only five years old. Who knows what really happened? Why don't you try to convince him of that? Talking about Kyle, I assume? I just called him looking for you. He gave me an earful. You okay? - Yeah. - Good thing Kyle is out of potions. It still doesn't solve his problem. And until somebody does... ...I would assume that you're not gonna go along with the Avatars, right? - What do you have up your sleeve? - I was just thinking, remember how Leo sent you back to find out what really happened to your parents? Yeah. Maybe we could do the same thing for Kyle and help him move on. Okay, but what if Kyle sees that they really did kill his parents? Well, if that's the case, then we'll kill the Avatars and help him move on that way. The sooner we help Kyle find out the truth, the sooner we can all move on. Move on to what? The future the Avatars promised us. The one I saw in my vision. Okay, but Phoebe, we all didn't see that. Yes, but you could if you and I swap powers. - What? - It would just be for a little while, just long enough for you to see the vision. It's beautiful. Okay, look, if the Avatars are exonerated, and I see what Phoebe saw, then we'll talk about it. Fine, I'll talk too. Zankou, hi, sorry to disturb you. What is it? Well, we were just wondering, and I mean all of us, not just myself, when things were gonna move along. Seeing as how the Avatars are so close to wiping us off the face of the Earth. The Avatars are not the problem. Not the problem? Well, we unleashed you to save us from them, and now they're not the problem? I'm a little confused. Would you like me to elaborate? Yes, please. We can't stop the Avatars. We might be able to stop the Charmed Ones before they join forces with them. If we can do that... ...then the Avatars won't have the power they need in order to remake the world... and eliminate us. Destroying the Charmed Ones, it always sounds easy. Many have tried. No one's succeeded. There's a first time for everything. Besides, I never had the opportunity to go up against them before. I sense... ...the chance is near. Are you trying to get yourself killed? That's what could have happened. It was a chance I had to take. You kill one Avatar, it weakens them all. - Kyle, you tried to kill Leo! - I don't care. I do, and if you actually cared about me, maybe you would too. - Now, see, don't lay that on me. - Don't lay what on you? He's my brother-in-law. He matters to me. Yeah, my parents mattered to me too! Okay. Even if the Avatars did kill them, Leo wasn't there. How can you even hold him responsible? It was the only way I could get to 'em. You would kill somebody who's innocent to exact revenge on whoever killed your parents. Gee, that makes you a whole lot better than those killers. Look, I know who killed my parents. - You sure? - I'm sure. - You won't mind proving it? - What are you talking about? Getting you past this, finding out who did this. Are you interested? Yeah. Good. Then you won't mind going on a little trip with me. I know the power-switching spell is in here. We've used it before. Yeah, and if I remember correctly, didn't it bite us in the ass? I'm just saying. As long as Kyle is willing, the Avatars said they'd send him back to the past. They've got the easy part. They should try dealing with a stubborn sister in the present. So I'm having second thoughts, sue me. It's well worth the risk for you to see what I saw. Imagine a future with no demons, a future where we're all free, where our kids get to grow up happy and have normal lives? What we've always dreamed of, you've always dreamed of. And you got all of that from one vision? Actually, I did. What are you smiling at? Nothing. Okay, we're ready. Good, I'm glad. And you will be too. We'll see. All right, let me explain how this is gonna work. - Hold it! He's doing this? - Yeah. - Is there a problem? - Yeah. How do I know he and the Avatars aren't gonna change the past? We can't change the past. Nor would we want to. You'll know if it's been messed with. It's your past. And I've got the word of an Avatar on this? No way. Kyle, please, we have to do this. It's the only way we're ever gonna find out the truth, right? All right. What do I do? Close your eyes. Concentrate on the day. See it. How do we get back? He'll get back when he finds the truth. Of course. Now what? Now we work on you. You okay? Yeah. Still not used to this time travel stuff. Oh, my God. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Wait a minute, something's not right. What? What's not right? - Come on! - Hey, buddy, watch it, huh? Where are you going? - December 28th, 1981. - Isn't that the date? Yeah. This isn't where it happened. This isn't where they died. You sure? Yeah, of course I'm sure. They died in a warehouse near JFK, at 7.52 at night. I checked the coroner's report. This is Columbia University. This is where they taught. - Maybe we're here for another reason. - The Avatars want me to miss seeing it. That's not gonna happen. We need to get to the airport. Hey, taxi! Cool, Raiders of the Lost Ark. I always wanted to see that. Christmas in New York, nothing like it, right? I think it's the first one I remember. What'd you get for Christmas? A bunch of books, snow globe, Rubik's Cube. You must have been a smart boy to handle that. I like puzzles. Hey, taxi! Come on. Mom? Mommy! It's okay, son. She's all right. She just fainted. You wanna get your jacket. Do you know who she is? Yeah. That's my mom. Which makes him... You. Found it! You ready? What if Zankou shows up? What are we gonna do then? Then I blow him up. We'll still have our powers, just in different bodies. What if that doesn't work? What if we need Paige? Why are you procrastinating? What are you afraid of? Honestly, a lot of things, actually. Even if this works, we're still talking about remaking the world. That makes me a little nervous. I promise you, you will not be nervous once you see what I saw. Trust me. What's mine is yours What's yours is mine I offer up my gift to share Switch our powers through the air Uh-oh! Where's the third one? We're not really sure. So why don't you just come back later, okay? Nah. Why didn't you fire back? Go ahead, tell him. We sort of lost our powers. Maybe we should try calling for our powers. We already tried that. - Maybe we should try again. - Piper, where are you going? The powers went out the window, didn't they? You expect to find them laying around on the front lawn? Don't get smart with me, mister! This was not my idea! I was just trying to get you to see what I saw. And now I can see that we are going to die. I don't need your powers for that! Maybe you should try scrying for them. Why would that work? They still exist somewhere. Somewhere? Somewhere where, like in people? Two very surprised people. Oh, we gotta get Paige back here before Zankou attacks again. After they find out who killed Kyle's parents. How did he know to attack us right when we were about to switch powers? He must have sensed you were vulnerable. Now I know why The Source locked him up. You need to take the kids to Magic School right away. - Leave you alone without powers? - You have to. We'll call you if we need you. But you gotta get them out of here. And we need to find our powers. I think I just found mine. I'm going to find my powers. One of them's found her powers already, which means the other one will as well. Does that mean we've missed our chance? Not necessarily. With all due respect, you said you knew when the Charmed Ones would be at their most vulnerable. They were vulnerable. I sensed it. I didn't anticipate the Elder coming to their rescue. Maybe we should rethink things a little, maybe go after the Avatars instead. With their powers... ...we wouldn't stand a chance. Some of us think we would. Now they don't think that. If you're still going after the witches, how do we get past the Elder? By letting the other Elders know he's not really one of them anymore. Thank you. Is my mom gonna be okay? She's gonna be fine. Is there anyone we can call for you? Husband maybe? There's no need. He's right here. - Hey. - Dad... Dad... is that your dad? Careful. What's wrong? A TA told me you're sick. No, I'm fine. I had a fainting spell. - Fainting spell? - I was so startled. He's the spitting image of my father. Crazy coincidences, right? Well, either way, thanks a lot for helping her out. I'm Jack, Jack Brody. This is Kevin, Kevin Matthews, and I am Paige. And we're late for a movie. What are you gonna see? Raiders of the Lost Ark. Cool, can I go with? No, you can't go with. You're too little. Trust me, though. You gonna love it. Just give me one second. - You get this for Christmas? - Yep. He loves reading about the Egyptian kings and queens. - What's your favourite story, Kyle? - The Mummy's Curse. Owe me a soda. I'm sure it's every kid's favourite story. My folks used to read it to me all the time. Well, you have good parents. Yeah. All right, then, Kevin, we really should be going. We should too. That was customs. The manifest for the Cairo shipment is missing. They're gonna destroy the shipment unless we identify 'em. They can't just destroy them. They can and will. So sorry to have to cut this short. I hope we see you again soon. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Okay, then bye, all. What are you thinking? I'm sorry, all right? I just thought it would be easier than this. You have to be careful. You can't risk changing the past. You yourself said that there's a reason why I came here first. That's not the reason. We came to see who killed them, not to save them. All my life I just used to think that if I could just talk to my parents one more time, five minutes, even that would be enough. I don't think I can just sit back and watch my parents die. You don't have a choice! We can't change the past. Oh, no, honey. No, don't. I... Baby, you gotta believe me. I did not hire a private eye to follow you! Liar! Honey, you gotta believe me! I'm the liar? You're the one having the affairs! How did you know about them, huh? I told you already. I don't know how. I just... I just saw it in my head. Now you can see you're ass outta my life! You're the one screwing around! Phil? You slept with Phil too? What is happening to me? I think I can explain. Who are you? It doesn't matter. But I know you've been seeing certain things, things that you can't explain? Don't tell me you're sleeping with her too. No, of course not. I'm just here to help you. Look, lady, no offence, but I don't think you can help me, okay? Oh, no, no, not the bowling trophy! My trop... my... Who the hell are you? Short version, I'm a witch. And you have my power of premonition. And if you don't come with me, you're probably gonna get killed by a demon. Got it? What's the matter? Don't trust me? You said you had some information about the Avatars. We're listening. Actually, I said I have information about one of the Avatars. - A very special one. - He doesn't know anything. - Let's go. - You know him actually. Very well too. All right, who is it? I believe his name is... Leo. Ring any Elder bells? - He's not an Avatar. - Sure, he is. He just doesn't want you to know it. Probably because he's planning on betraying you. Then again, I'm not one to gossip. I'm sure if you look back at it, it has to make a lot of sense, doesn't it? You have any proof? I saw his powers. More to the point, I... ...felt his powers. They made yours seem... feeble. Why are you telling us this now? What do you hope to gain? My life... ...and those of my fellow demons. You see, the one thing you and I have in common is the Avatar's threat. If they come to power, you will be out, and we will be gone. On the other hand, if you can... ...deal with your little traitor... ...we might yet be able to save ourselves. Tick... tock. Demons? What do you mean, demons? You mean they actually exist? Yes, Denise, they do, so I need my powers... Stay away from me! Why does that keep happening? It won't, if you just calm down a little and let me help you. Wait. You guys fight demons here all the time, don't you? Pretty much, why? I thought that you threw wild parties, you know, things breaking, people screaming. I had no idea. Well, at least now you know why we never invited you. Found my... See, that's that other little power I was telling you about. So small gesture here. Nothing too hard. Don't want to blow up the sister, okay? ...power. Frozen? Yeah. - Hi, I'm Phoebe, and you're... - Really scared. Yeah, really, don't startle her. Ladies, what do you say we cut the chitchat and just fix this? You got it, Ronnie, let's do it. Wait, what exactly are you gonna do? Just a spell. You'll say it, we'll say it, everything should be back to normal. And then you can go home and never tell anyone ever, ever, ever about this, okay? - Sounds good, huh? - Gather around. Hold on. Wait, wait. What if you wanted to use powers for something besides fighting demons? Like... winning the lottery? - My premonitions are bigger than that. - What's bigger than the lottery? How about getting back at people who were really mean to you? Ever do that? No, no, 'cause that's under the category of personal gain, and with the risk of exposure, those are really bad things in the witch world. - Time's a-wastin'. - No, no, no, I'm talking really mean. Like an ex-husband who clears out your savings account, runs off with his secretary and leaves you mortgaged to the hilt. You guys could get rich and get revenge on whoever you wanted. No, we couldn't. - I don't believe you. - Yeah, me neither. What do you say we get rich? Okay. Only if we can blow up my ex-husband afterwards. - Sure. - No, no. That would be personal gain and exposure, not to mention murder! Hey, you can't leave! Oh, I think this is gonna be a lot of fun. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're gonna want to be extra careful with that one. This is gonna take a while. You want to go get a drink? No? Here we go. What's in these things? Well... ...I honestly don't know, but... I can tell you what I think is in them. They thought it was some sort of Egyptian healing balm. I went through the journals. They didn't know what they had unearthed, what it could do. They were completely innocent. So why did the Avatars kill them? Because they knew what it could do. Are there any other vials? No. They all got destroyed. When? You'll see. What are you guys doing here? Oh, actually, we're... Can you keep a secret? You know those imaginary friends of yours, the ones that watch over you? How do you know about them? How do you think we know? Because you're them? That's right. Here. Now you got your own throne, just like King Tut. Can I talk to you for a second? Everything you say to him can change your past? I'm not saying anything to him that he doesn't already know. Trust me. You can't keep him from going through this. Everything that you've gone through, your parents death, has made you who you are today. Don't you see that? He has to go through it. Otherwise, you won't. Kyle? Where are you? You better go. Will you still be here? Yeah. Go on, get outta here. Honey? There you are. Want to go get that soda now? - Okay. - Okay. Piper? Phoebe? - Where'd they go? - Hey. - Where did who go? - Uh-oh! - They froze us again. - Apparently took off with our powers. - Why didn't you stop them? - It's tough to do when you're frozen. You explain the risks? Demons, personal gain? Yeah. The demons, they were afraid of. Personal gain, not so much. You need to find 'em. Yeah, thanks. Without our powers, I don't know how we'll convince 'em to give them back. We'll jump off that bridge when we get to it. - The Elders? - Yeah, I don't know what they want. - You think it's about Zankou? - Could be. Or the Avatars. I'll be right back. That's never happened before. Lake Tahoe? We have another winner! Here you go, babe. Keep 'em coming. I feel bad we haven't had a chance to blow up your ex yet. - That's okay. We can do it tomorrow. - All right. Ten thousand dollar hard eight. Yo, stick man, give me the horn. You got it. Eight the hard way! All right, that was your last roll, Diamond Jim. What are you doing here? - Fun is over. - Fun's just getting started. Unless you want Denise here to put the whammy on you again. She wouldn't dare, not in front of these people. - Wanna try me? - Oh, sure, now she's fearless. Okay, I'll make you a deal. You try to get one more premonition, then afterwards, if you don't want to come with us, you can have our powers. - Phoebe... - I know what I'm doing. What do you say? Will it win me a bunch more money? Not a cent. But I guarantee you what you see will offer you more than this casino. Okay, I need you to close your eyes and clear your head. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna try to get him to see what I've been trying to get you to see. With no powers? I saw it, didn't I? Okay, give me your hand. I'm gonna walk you through this, okay? Close your eyes and picture an elementary school... ...outside, lots of happy kids. Can you see it? Hi, Aunt Phoebe. Aunt Phoebe? Yeah, that's it. Stay with it. There's Wyatt and Chris and a little girl. What did I tell you about demons? They don't exist anymore. Not since the Avatars. What's he seeing? Believe me, I wish I knew. Is that real? It can be... if we get our powers back. All right, Leo, for the last time, are you or are you not an Avatar? I'm just someone who wants peace. Isn't that what you want too? Please, Leo, the truth! All right. Yes, I'm an Avatar. But they're not a threat. They seek what we seek. What, the destruction of everything we hold dear? No, a world without good and evil. It's not possible. It is if we have the courage to change, to evolve. Evolution takes centuries. Millennia, even. It cannot happen overnight. It must be earned. I think we've earned it. We can't let you go through with this, Leo. I already have. So be it. How'd you? You should be dead. I would have been if I were still an Elder. Face it. The fate of the world is no longer in your hands. We'll get the spell. I wouldn't bother with that if I were you. - Leo! - I wouldn't bother with him either. Something tells me he's not coming to your rescue this time. We're gonna die! You're gonna be fine. Remember what I told you. He's bad. Yes. You should be able to sense the next energy... Get down! That was very good. Thank you. - Nice job. - Did I kill him? Not quite. But we'll take what we can get. Leo! Leo is still alive. Looks like the Avatar is more powerful than I thought. Which means we're all in trouble. You guys all right? Yeah, thanks to these two. You, on the other hand... I'll be fine. What happened? I thought you went to see the Elders. I did. We need to talk. It's time. Demons. Ruth! No! - We needed those potions. - I told you we should have waited. How will we protect ourselves? We won't. LOADING DOCK I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Neither did I. I never really saw what happened. I thought I did, but I just assumed it was the Avatars because of the vials. At least now we know it wasn't them. It doesn't help. Mom? Dad? Daddy! Daddy? Daddy. No, please. Kyle, look at me. Kyle. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna get through this, all right? Promise. We have to go. Hey, do you mind? Sorry, just checking. Oh, it's okay. I never liked that lamp anyway. I don't know how much good having our powers is gonna do. They didn't phase Zankou. Zankou. How do they come up with these names? After all these years, you ask now? At least Denise and Ronnie get to go back to their normal lives. - Did Leo use the memory dust on them? - Yeah. It's kind of a shame considering everything they went through. I mean, Ronnie got to see a better future. Yeah. Too bad you didn't get to see the future that Ronnie saw. I don't think I need to. I mean, I saw how just one glimpse changed that man forever. And the fact that the Avatars aren't killers helps a bit. - That's enough for me. - Really? Worth a shot. It's gotta be better than cleaning up after demons. I agree. I've been thinking about it, and... ...l'm ready to try too. Because I'm tired of all of... ...this. How's Kyle doing? He's pretty devastated, you know.
