we'll begin the ritualistic chant, and then you will be escorted in for the ceremony. It's been a while, hasn't it? Five hundred years, give or take a decade. Here it is. The oath. Upon completion of the oath, you will be given the full powers of the underworld. - Will I feel different? After? - Perhaps. Those who came before you described a feeling of being... ...complete. Have any of them been half human? No, this is a first. Now it's time for you to begin your preparations. Your guards will show you to the vestibule. This way. Arrest me. - What's going on? - I found him outside. A wizard. Well, well. Aren't you supposed to be extinct? - One of us is alive and well. - Not for long. Did you really think you could stop the coronation all by yourself, wizard? I didn't come for the coronation. I came for the revenge. What's the matter with you? Stop him! It's an illusion. What the hell is going on here? Cole's a demon again. That is what's going on. Do you wanna lose us a sister? Because that's exactly what's gonna happen if you blurt it out like that. Besides, we only know that Cole is dealing with demons... ...not that he is a demon. If it looks like a demon and walks like a demon... That's ducks. That's not Phoebe's husband, the love of her life, her best friend-- All right, I get your point, woman. Look, this isn't gonna be easy for her to hear. Especially since she's happier than she's ever been. Or not. Hi, come on in. Phoebe, what's the matter? You look-- Terrible? Yeah, I haven't slept in a couple of days. Why? What's the matter? You guys should probably sit down. Sit. That's funny, we were just coming to ask you to do the same thing. Okay, so, what I'm about to tell you is really big. We're talking huge. See, she knows. Knows what? You tell us. Okay. I'm... I'm pregnant. - You're what? - Oh, my God. From Cole? Find the wizard or you're next. I don't even understand how this could've happened. We were being so careful. It's the last thing I expected right now. Just wait. Does Cole know? No, not yet. I should've told him, I know, but I didn't know how to. Besides, I don't want him to think that I'm not happy about it. Are you? I don't know. I'm-- You know, part of me is, obviously. I love Cole. But then there's another part of me that's scared to death. I mean, there's so many changes, and it's all happening so fast. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. Oh, honey, you should've told us when you found out. And then you wouldn't have to go through it alone. I know. But I wasn't sure how you would feel about it. Me, why? Because I know how hard you and Leo have been trying. Honey, this doesn't have anything to do with me. It has everything to do with you, and I'd be thrilled to be an aunt. Don't worry about me. So when are you gonna tell Cole? I don't know. He's got so much on his plate right now. You know, with starting his new job and everything. You're gonna have a lot on your plate too, more than you realise. Yeah, like how many hours he's gonna be working and that he's not gonna be home a lot. That's not what I was talking about, Piper. - What do you mean, Paige? - It can wait. Oh, God, that's Cole. He can't know I told you before I told him. Hurry, out of here. Orb. I thought Cole had a "no orbing" policy. No, he doesn't want you orbing in. He doesn't mind you orbing out. Now! I thought you were at work. I thought you were in bed. Are you feeling better? Much, thanks. Well, I gotta go, baby, you know, deadlines. - But I got you something to eat. - Sorry. I'll call you later. - Phoebe, what's wrong? - Why? What makes you think there's something wrong? Because every time you lie, I can see your wisdom teeth. - We'll talk tonight. - Phoebe. Please, Cole, not now. - Well, I'm worried. - Well, don't be. Well, I am, damn it. What's the matter? I'm pregnant. - You're what? - We'll talk later. I'm gonna be a daddy. What is the emergency? Phoebe is pregnant. - What? Really? - Yeah, I think she deserves to know she's carrying a demon child, don't you? You don't know if Cole is a demon. - You don't know he's not. - Well, okay. We'll do some more digging, and we'll find some solid proof. No, I think she deserves to know it now, Piper. - She doesn't need the stress, Paige. - Even if she's in danger? Cole would never hurt her. He couldn't even hurt her when he was a demon. Are you willing to bet her life on it? Okay, do you want my advice or don't you? Whose side are you on? If it's hers, it better not be because you're sleeping with her. Help! Please, you gotta help me. Help you? Who are you? No! What an idiot. Doesn't every demon know by now whose house this is? Not every demon, fortunately for me. But he just vanquished you. No, not me. An illusion. One of my little tricks. Comes in handy. Saving my life and whatnot. You're a wizard? In the flesh. For lack of a better term. Wait a minute, you just tricked us into vanquishing one of your enemies. My enemies are your enemies. Says you. Leo, friend or foe? I don't know. I've never met a wizard before. - Only heard about them. - Please, give me a little credit. Why would I seek out the Charmed Ones if I were evil? Look, you need to stand still, or you're gonna go poof like your friend in there. Oh, you're the touchy one, aren't you? I've heard about you. Peeper? - Piper. - Whatever. What do you want? Revenge. On The Source. For slaughtering my kind centuries ago. And for that I'll need your help. Well, maybe you haven't heard. There's a new Source. The old one is dead. Yeah, we already kicked his sorry ass. He didn't die. He was reborn into a new sorry ass. Wait, that didn't come out right. Are you kidding me? After everything we went through, he found an escape hatch? Our only chance to stop him will be tonight, before he receives his full powers at the coronation. Tonight? How do we do such a big job on such short notice? We'll steal the Grimoire. - Oh, what's that? - Evil Book of Shadows. The Source has to lay his hand on the book as he says the oath, or he doesn't get his powers. So we steal a little book, and we stop The Source? What's the catch? The catch is it's protected in a secret chamber by his best guards. Now, I know how to get there. But I can't fight them alone. What do you say? Partners? I so don't trust him. I'll check with the Elders, see what they know. You better get Phoebe. In case he's right, you're gonna need the power of three. - I'll go get her. - No. No, you've got the firepower. You stay here, I'll go. All right, but no spilling the beans on Cole, not until we decide to. Scout's honour. Just so you know, one false move, and you're toast. Got any jam? - Is the witch home? - No. Good. I thought you'd like an update. As you ordered, the priests have stepped up security on the Grimoire. So far, the wizard has been our only breach. - What is that dreadful music? - Oh, nothing. Baby shopping, sir? Yes. As a matter of fact, I was. Phoebe's pregnant. An heir, that's wonderful news. But I don't understand why you're... Just keeping up appearances, you know. Trying to act like any normal father-to-be. For Phoebe. But Phoebe's not here. Is there anything else you need to update me on? May I speak candidly? I'm worried about you. Worried that the witch's influence on you is too great. That the baby will make the pull of love even greater. Oh, if you're worried about the coronation... I'm worried about after the coronation. The next nine months to be exact... ...when the bond between you and Phoebe will grow... ...and your hold on the humanity within will weaken. Unless... Unless? Unless you allow the Seer to perform her dark magic. Allow me to carry your baby. What? You won't need the witch anymore. I could be your queen. - Are you out of your mind? - I'm trying to save you. The underworld will not tolerate a leader who's conflicted. Any sign of weakness, and you're not gonna survive. Are you threatening me? I'm reminding you... ...of your future, your destiny. Neither of which include the witch. Yes, of course I am aware that there's a deadline, but Elise threw my column out at the last minute. Oh, how hard can it be to write an advice column? Let me show you how hard! - Bad time? - Yes. No. Whatever. What is it? Well, we... We need the power of three. What? Now? Can't it wait? CliffsNotes version: We didn't kill The Source like we thought. He was just reborn, and now if we don't help a wizard stop him from getting coronated tonight, he becomes all-powerful. Shall we? So let him get coronated. - Sorry? - Well, why not? What's the worst that can happen? Besides all hell breaking loose on Earth? What's wrong with you? I don't know. I'm just-- I'm having a really bad day right now. Okay, I'll meet you at the manor. But I have to find Cole first and fill him in. No, you don't need to do that. Besides, he's so busy being Mr. Hot-Shot-Lawyer-Guy and all. Okay, Paige, what's your problem with Cole now, huh? Spill it. Nothing. You're lying, I can see your wisdom teeth. - I don't have wisdom teeth. - Paige. All right, but you're not gonna like it. All right. Remember the vampire that attacked me a couple of days ago? I met him through Cole at your apartment. And? And? Don't you think that's a pretty big coincidence for an alleged ex-demon? - Alleged? - Stop being so naive, Phoebe. He's been acting strange ever since he got his new job, which for all we know, could be a cover anyway. - I don't believe this. - Face the facts, Phoebe. Cole has gone back to his old ways. And I am not the only one who thinks so. Piper thinks so too. That's what we were coming to tell you about this morning. I'm sorry. Where are you going? To prove you wrong. What about The Source, what about the power of three? Screw the power of three. You caught me. Cole. I love you. "Screw the power of three"? Those were her words exactly. And then she practically flattened me while storming out of her office. Well, that sounds like more than just hormones. Yeah, she was a little pissed. About what? Oh, Paige, you didn't! You told her about Cole? She was gonna find out eventually. Yeah, when we decided it was the right time to tell her. Now she's probably never gonna speak to us again. You might as well crown the new Source yourself. Oh, God, I think you're slightly exaggerating. No, I am not. We need Phoebe for the plan to work. - What plan? - You follow me! All right. Piper, I think I like the other kitchen better. This is an illusion, right? Please, tell me she's not the brains of the family. Grimoire, Dark Priest, bodyguards, and this mystery man over here is The Source. Oh, first half a face and now no face. I didn't get a good look at him. Well, it doesn't really matter anyway, because he may not even be here. - All we want is the Grimoire. - All right, what's the plan? - We learn from his mistakes. - Not mistakes, miscalculations. You didn't have any backup, your illusions didn't buy you enough time, and you got caught. I'd call those mistakes. This time we'll go for a bigger distraction, and since the bodyguards are already after you, you show up, and they'll chase after you. Thinning out the demonic ranks, that sounds good. Easy for you to say. You're not the distraction. You'll orb us in, Phoebe and l will keep the demons busy, - and you'll snag the book. - Sounds simple. Would I come to you if it were that simple? It's like the Book of Shadows, only it protects itself from good. So you'll use this sack. We'll put a spell on it so it can hold the Grimoire. - Piper! - Phoebe, no! Hello. Confusion. I can't work like this. Phoebe, this is the wizard. And that was one of his illusions. An illusion? Like those? Yeah, don't mind him. He's been at it all day, the pig. Not that I'm not happy to see you, Phoebe, but why are we seeing you, considering how we left it? I'm not about to shun my Wiccan duties, Paige, no matter what. But what about what we talked about? I love Cole. And I trust him, even if you guys don't. We could discuss our problems later. I came here to help you with Merlin. Please. Merlin was an overrated hack. Tell me he's not the only wizard you people have ever heard of. Well, does Harry Potter count? All right, enough. You can live your life of instant gratification later, after we're done. - Get rid of them. - You call this a life? This is no life. Illusions are as empty to me as they are to you. They're only a reminder of a reality long since lost, of a world filled with wizards, of friends, of family. It's all an illusion without family. Help me stop The Source. Help me right this wrong. Everything's on schedule. The other priests are preparing the sacrifices as we speak. What about the wizard? How do we know he won't make another attempt? He's the last of his kind, sire. I doubt if he'll risk oblivion. He risked it before, didn't he? Talking about me? Guards! After him! Something's not right. You should leave for your safety now, sire. Protect the Grimoire. Stop. Wait. But, sire, the wizard. He's right behind you. If only you were real... Piper, now! Paige, look out! What was that? I have no idea. What are we waiting for? Grimoire! Got it. Let's get out of here. We did it! We got it. Yes, and now we're going to destroy it. Paige, go get the Book of Shadows. We need some potions. - Right. - Wait. Destroy it? We might be able to use it. For what? It's evil. - Do you wanna sit down? - I think I just wanna go home. Well, this is home too. I don't feel good. It just didn't feel right. Well, that's probably just because it's new, and your power is escalating. How is it escalating? I levitate, I have premonitions. Well, you had fire power in your past life. I was evil in my past life, remember? Can we get back to the Grimoire? No! Phoebe, wait! What's the matter? What happened? What are you doing here? I sensed your pain. I was worried. Yeah, well, you should be worried. The Grimoire's been stolen. I know. You know? How do you know? Have you been spying on me? No, of course not. Then how? Tell me. From me. I told her. Seer? If you foresaw the Grimoire being taken-- Finding the Grimoire is not your biggest problem. Suppressing Cole is. You're changing, my liege. The human in you grows stronger, and at the worst possible time. - I can handle it. - How? Your guard is down. You're vulnerable. Let me try again. Try what? Are you working together to manipulate me? No, to save you. To save us. Us? There is no us! But there could be. And if there were, the struggle would end. You'd be free to rule without the witch's love holding you back. This is your doing. Did you really think I'd fall for it? Leave us. Now. I can't believe you tricked me into hiring a seductress. I was concerned the baby's influence on your humanity might sway you to the other side. And what? You hoped if I'd gotten laid-- No, I hoped you'd come to your senses before it was too late. But I wasn't relying on it. This isn't just about you. I helped put you in position for greatness, and I'm not going to let you fail now. It's only The Source that protects you from the Charmed Ones' powers and premonitions. If Cole's love becomes any stronger, it will overpower The Source. Then you will lose everything. The throne, your wife, your son. Cole? Hi, honey. What happened? There was an accident. Everything go all right with whatever you had to do - with your sisters? - The good news is we got - what we were after. - Good, congratulations. But... ... I think something really bad has happened to me. What, the baby? No. The baby's fine. I threw fire. I vanquished a demon with it. And it just felt... I don't know. Awful. Almost evil. That's impossible. You're the sweetest, most loving person I've ever known. You don't have an evil bone in your body, and you know that. What? What happened? Oh, my God. - Phoebe? - Stay away from me. Phoebe. - Stay away from me. - What did you see? Okay. Oh, that was the strongest one I had. - I don't know what else to do. - I'll tell you what to do. Keep it. You know, maybe we should go see Phoebe. She didn't look so well. Paige, we'll go over there after we destroy this book. I think you're being hasty. The Grimoire could bring us great powers. Listen, we already have powers. We don't need evil ones too. - Phoebe? - I have to talk to you guys. What is it? You, you stay where I can see you. Honey, what is it? What's the matter? Whatever it is, it's gonna be all right. No. It won't. I had a premonition. And you were right, Cole is evil. Oh, honey, I didn't want to be right. What exactly did you see? Everything. Killing, fireball throwing, working with other demons. Oh, God, Cole is a demon. It's okay, Phoebe, just take a breath. What's taking so long? Quiet. I have a baby on the way. And I have this new power. I don't know if I can handle this. It's okay, you're not alone. You have us. We got big problems. Where's the wizard? He's in there. We got big problems in here. Cole. Demon Cole. What were you gonna say about the wizard? Can you handle this right now? Do I have a choice? What's taking so long? Well, according to the Elders, some wizards are evil, and if he is, it's not good. I knew it, and he wants the Grimoire for himself. Probably. There's a spell in there that can consecrate a weapon and make it strong enough to kill The Source. Isn't that a good thing? No, if he kills The Source, he becomes The Source. And he'll have enough magic to resurrect his people. What's taking so long? Wait a minute. I can't believe we let that slimy Lord of the Rings wannabe use us. - Another illusion? - On a loop, no less. He was just waiting for an opportunity to take the book. We need to get it back fast. - How? - We gotta go back to the underworld. We couldn't even find the coronation site without the wizard. - What about a summoning spell? - We'd need his blood. Cole. I was just thinking maybe he'd know something. He is a demon, after all. I can't even think about Cole right now, Iet alone talk to him. Maybe we could go with you and watch your back. That's an awful lot to ask of her right now. I know, but what choice do we have? There's gonna be a coronation tonight unless we stop it. How does it feel? Heavy. Focus. What's the point? - We don't even have the Grimoire. - We will. But in the meantime, you must keep up appearances. - But Phoebe-- - Is not your concern at the moment. She knows I'm a demon, damn it! She will come around in time. I can't do this. I have to find her. And risk the wizard finding you? He'll kill you. Take your throne. He can have it. And what do you think your death will solve? Do you really think it'll bring you what you seek? If losing the witch has cost you your will, then I will get it back. What do you mean? Anything? - He's not here. - Did you try his office? I'm beginning to wonder if he even has an office. He does. Who are you? I know who she is. Where's Cole? Safe from you. All right, you wanna punch her, or should l? I should have known all along. You ruined him. Made him pathetic, weak... ...good. And I take it you have a problem with that? Yeah, I have a big problem with that. Phoebe, what's going on here? You were just a means to an end. A way to sire a magical child. But now you're hurting him, and I can't allow that. - Oh, no? - No. Two can play at that game. - Okay, enough. - Piper, don't. This is my fight. Phoebe! Home wrecker. Okay, Phoebe, you're scaring us. What? Phoebe, fire throwing is an upper-level demonic power. Oh, my God. What's happening to me? Breathe. How did I get here? Through magic. Dark magic. Stay away from me. Stop me. Feels good, doesn't it? Or more precisely, evil. What do you want? What have you done to me? What I've done is not important. What you must do now, however, is. Your husband needs you by his side. - I don't understand. - Don't you? You and I share the same gift. We both can sense the truth. From the moment Cole absorbed The Source's power, you've sensed something different about him. Something that's changed him forever. You know the truth. - Cole is The Source. - Yes. And he needs your help if he hopes to survive. He needs your love. You can't keep fighting it. The maternal bond is too strong. Listen to your body, Phoebe. Listen to your unborn son. He takes after his father. His father lied to me. He never lied about his feelings for you. And despite my best efforts, he never stopped loving you. Your son was conceived in love, you know that. It's time to stop fighting it. It's time to embrace your new family, your new destiny. Otherwise, Cole and your son will die. All of demondom will rise up against them to destroy them and you. Leave me. But the coronation is imminent. - The wizard-- - Knows that. I know. Leave. I knew you'd come for me. If you wanted my powers... ...all you had to do was ask. How much longer? Give me a break, will you? This is tricky stuff. Be a lot easier if I could do this in friendlier confines. There are no friendly confines, not anymore. This had better work, or you'll be joining the rest of your kind and not the way you'd hoped for. A little tip. Pressure's not the best motivating technique. If you wanna lose The Source's powers, don't rush me. Fine. But just so we're clear, once you get The Source's powers, I never hear from you again. Understood. Not that I'm ungrateful, but why are you so willing to do this? I lost someone I love, and I want her back. That's all you need to know. Love? The Source can love. Just keep working. I'm done. Now, if the spell's going to work... ...blood needs to spill. Now me. Save him. For your son. Maybe you should go back down to the underworld. I already tried. I can't sense her anywhere. Well, she's gotta be somewhere. Doesn't she? Got her. Are you okay? What happened? What did you do? I vanquished him. Oh, but he was our last chance. No, it wasn't. Thank God we found you. It's too late. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Hey, I thought only evil can touch that book. That's right. Phoebe, what's going on? I'm embracing my new destiny. What the hell was that? That was The Source. And his queen. You did this. You poisoned her. Maybe we should just vanquish you. You can't. Not without the power of three. I can't believe this is happening. Leo, where did she go? I can't sense her. - They must be in the underworld. - Orb us down there. We'll drag her home kicking and screaming. There is no way we can find the coronation site without the wizard. I don't care. We can't just leave her there. We don't have a choice. We'll have to find another way. Are you sure about this? You're giving up your life. My life is with you and our baby. We'll be strong together. After all, we're family.
