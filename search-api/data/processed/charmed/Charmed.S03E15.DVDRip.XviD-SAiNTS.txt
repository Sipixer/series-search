you could get? Without opening a fast-food franchise, yeah. Well, just remember, if love is the quest, then marriage is the conquest. This place must feel like victory. And I thought weddings were supposed to be romantic. Oh, my dear, sweet child. Better listen to Grams. You could always calculate her age by the number of rings on her fingers. All right, wedding arch is done. The next thing to do on the to-do list is... Sleep. You've been yawning all day. Try all week. It's this reoccurring dream I keep having. - It's keeping me awake. - Really? What's in the dream? Well, there's this biker guy, and he's kind of cute and kind of dangerous. Sounds kind of yummy. Piper, sweetie, well, what do you think? It's... It's beautiful. Yeah, and the best part about it is, it's finally happening. Flowers and bows and Grams. The only thing missing is... Mom. Grams, are you sure that you can't do...? No, nothing. I'm only here because you need a high priestess. They want me back by the witching hour tomorrow. I thought maybe this could help. You okay? Yeah, I just... I can't believe how close I came to sabotaging my own wedding. - What do you mean? - Well, with the demons and the false starts and them, l... You know, I told myself if one more thing went wrong, then it just maybe wasn't meant to be. Darling, there's no need to think that way. I mean, you made it. Yeah, and I will personally butt-kick any demon who tries to ruin it for you. Not if you're asleep. Come on, I'm tucking you in. Sweet dreams. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow at 4:00, Mrs. Halliwell. The women keep their names in this family. That's a lucky shot. The more I play, the luckier I get. All right. So that would be... ...20 bucks that you owe me. I never agreed to no bet. Rules of the house say loser pays 20 bucks. Maybe you want me to take you out front and teach you those rules. All right. Easy. Thank you. So I suppose that you want something for helping me. - You could say that. - You'll have to win it just like the rest of them. Maybe I should just take it. Maybe you should leave me alone. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Maybe you should show me. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. Yeah, well, so am I because now I have to go. Well, I want you to stay. Yeah, I know. You know that I can't, right? I have... Responsibilities. It's what you say every night, - then you cut out. - T.J., I would love to leave my responsible half behind, but I can't. You can. What are you gonna miss tomorrow? Work? Blow it off. There's a freedom that comes with making your own choices. I know. Yeah, and I want to know what that's like, but... The least you could do is tell me your name. Hey. You got my money? Hey, you have a good memory. Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll just take it out in trade, huh? Come here. No, I don't wanna go again... Leo? Was that just giggling I heard? Yes, I am guilty of giggling, and I am guilty of being happier than any previous moment in my life. Piper, it's your wedding day. - I know. - Here comes the bridesmaid. Prue. Come play. - Hey. - Another bad dream? Yeah. I was still in that biker bar, but this time I was attacked by a big galoot. A galoot? What is that? You fought a demon in your sleep? If I'm gonna have to vanquish a demon in my wedding dress, just tell me, because if so, then... All right? He was not a demon, right? He was just a big, rude guy. And it was just in her dreams, honey. Yeah, and the only thing I need to vanquish him is a potion called coffee. That must be the flowers. Okay, you just relax, no worrying. And eat your breakfast, and then I will have a hot bubble bath waiting for you. Sure there's nothing witchy going on? I'm positive. Is that her? That the woman you were with last night? Yeah, so what? So, what's her name? I don't know. You stick your tongue down her throat, but you don't know her name. - Is that against the law? - I can appreciate you trying to protect your girlfriend from murder charges. - She's no murderer. - You sure about that, son? You know something? I know what happened. I saw it with my own eyes. - Did you get a look at the killer? - I'm looking at her right now. Check out what I found in the attic. I hope it's something old, because we already have new, borrowed and blue covered. Is Melinda Warren's blessing cup old enough? That is very cool. What could be better than to give Piper the actual cup that our favourite ancestor drank from at her wedding? All right, I can check that off. Now all I need is help moving the buffet table. Maybe we should wait until Cole gets here. He should be here any minute. You're kidding, right? No. You knew he was coming to the wedding. Yeah, to the wedding, Phoebe. But the moments leading up to it belong to family. And I'm sorry, but Cole is not family, okay? He is still a demon. And I don't think Piper needs a demon... It is bad luck to see the bride's dress before the wedding. But you're not even wearing your dress. The same rule applies to the bride's curlers. Go away. Oh, good, you're here. I'm just looking for a place to change. - What's with the robe? - Oh, it's my formal whitelighter wear. Yeah, I hope you don't mind, but we sort of decided that you should be a little bit more traditional, so we rented you a tux. Anybody home? Daddy. - Hi. - Hiya, Pheebs. - Leo. - Victor. - Hi, Dad. - Come here. Well, I know that you two have a lot of joy and laughter to share, so I'll just take you down... What's the matter? Just stay there. Dizzy spell. I've been getting them ever since those dreams began. - What dreams? - Oh, you know, these dreams... You know, it's nothing. Yeah, certainly nothing to worry about. Okay, you two, follow me. You just sit there and relax. I'll be right back. Get dressed, and no fighting. So you rented a tux, huh? I thought for sure you'd be wearing one of those long robes all you whitelighters love so much. No, I decided to go a little more traditional. Prue. Okay, we've got everyone convinced that we have things under control. Now you have to convince me. I can't do that. Oh, no. What are you feeling? Tired. All the time. I mean, when I fall asleep, my dreams are so real that they don't allow me any rest. It's like I'm awake 24 hours a day. Is the Dream Sorcerer back? I don't think so, but I'm not ruling anything out. Well, remember what Piper said. If one more thing goes wrong, she was gonna call off this wedding. No, we can't let that happen. Okay, why don't you let me handle this almighty to-do list, and you go upstairs and get some rest. Don't sleep. Just rest. Okay. Well, so you're relinquishing control to your little sister. You must really be tired. Please help us through this day, Mom. - Hey. - Hey. - You shouldn't have come back. - What are you talking about? I spent all morning with the cops. They think you killed a guy - and took his money. - No, I didn't kill anyone. Good, because that's what I told them. So then why are you still here? Waiting for you. But I didn't have your phone number. You never even gave me your name. That is the sexiest thing a man's ever done for me. You keep saying you wanna live a life with no rules, no responsibility. This is it, your chance. Come on. Take it easy. Don't do it for me, T.J. You don't wanna be an accessory to murder. The name's Prue. Prue Halliwell. Put up your hands. - Come on. - Get over here. Look, I already told you guys everything I know. Let's go. Prue? Prue, wake up. Prue. Oh, no. Oh, no. I was wanted for murder, but this guy in my dream, he risked himself to save me. This sexy guy. Prue, forget the guy. What about the arrest? Right. Okay, a cop handcuffed me, and that's all that I remember, except that I didn't really wanna wake up. It's like my dream was overpowering me. That's what my premonitions feel like. They pull me against my will. Maybe somebody's trying to pull me into a parallel world or a dream dimension. Well, hopefully that someone will be in the Book of Shadows, okay? Come on. Wait, should we tell Piper? No, I won't let this be the one thing that goes wrong today. I'll be okay as long as I stay awake, right? For Piper? For Piper. Hold it right there. What's wrong? Boy bands. There's just far too many of them, don't you think? - No. What's wrong with you two? - Nothing's wrong. It's in your faces. We've demon hunted for three years. Now you're going to the attic, aren't you? - Yes. - Phoebe. - I knew it. - Prue, she's on to us. She knows. Yes, Piper, we were heading to the attic to find something old, something new. Something borrowed and something blue. - Blue, yes. - Right. We were gonna surprise you, but now you caught us. Yeah. I mean, look, I told you, you have nothing to worry about today. All right? It's going to be a demon-free day. - Hey! - Sorry, I'm late. You were saying? Had a near miss with a Zotar. Almost spotted me. Oh, don't worry, I lost him. I think. See? No matter what, a demon will attack today. It's just the natural order of our universe. Piper, you have to stay positive. You know what? I have Celine Dion: Behind the Music on video cassette. - Like to watch that? - Like to get slapped? Hey, she's just trying to relax you. Don't worry. Leave the demons to me. I'll handle anything that comes through... Oh, no, you don't. You promised you were not gonna use your demonic powers anymore. Oh, sorry. Old habit. Yeah, think good. No, I am, I am. I brought a gift. So you and Piper gonna move out, get your own place? Not right away. Between you and me, isn't that a little tough on the old pride? Living off the girls like that? Look, Victor, I know you don't like the idea of your daughter marrying a whitelighter. Oh, I never said that. But now that you mention it, yeah, I'd prefer Piper marry a mortal. Well, Piper's not mortal. She's a witch. She was given her gifts to serve a higher calling. A calling that only people like you can understand, right? It's the same crap my ex-wife's whitelighter used to steal her away from me. You know, I'm sorry that happened to you. I really am. But with all due respect, this isn't about you and Patty. This is about me and Piper. Now, I love her with all my heart, and I promise to keep loving her and taking care of her for the rest of this life, the afterlife and whatever comes after that. Now, you may not support it, and you may not agree with it, but it is not gonna stop me from marrying your daughter today. Nothing will. You know... ...I could probably get used to having a whitelighter for a son-in-law. Everybody having fun down here? Where do you stand on demons? Hey, did you find anything in the Book about your dreams? - Nothing. - What are we gonna do? The wedding's in half an hour. Get ready, get set, get through it for Piper. For Piper. Oh, you're so beautiful. - Mom? - Don't be afraid. Oh, my God. But no, it can't be, because ghosts glow. And you're not glowing. Well, I'm not a ghost. Well, not today. Today I am simply your mother. But how? After all the Elders put you and Leo through, they wanted to give you something back, so they sent me down just for your wedding day. You know, I think I wore my hair like this for my wedding day. You did. I kept your wedding album after you died, and... And I looked at the pictures every night like a bedtime story. I always thought you'd be the first to get married. You're the heart of this family, Piper. I'm not dreaming, am I? No, sweetie, you're not. Mom. It's true. She's real. They sent her to us for today. Oh, Prue. It's been so hard on you. Unfair. Yeah. No. It doesn't matter. I just wanted to make you proud. You protected this family better than I could. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. And you, my baby. You feel it all, don't you? I was never there to comfort you. I died before you even knew me. Some nights I just wanted you to hold me. Your road's been the longest, Phoebe. But I was never worried about you. You know why? Because I had a premonition the day you were born. - You did? - What did you see? Oh, I saw this. I saw this moment right now, my three daughters standing before me as beautiful young women, and I knew that everything would be okay. What did you see next? I held you. Places. Places, everyone. Don't answer that. Can somebody answer that? I'll get it. Hey, you're late. Where were you? Trying to save your ass. The police have your picture. You're wanted for murder. They said you fled custody this morning. That was your dream. They don't have your name, but it's only a matter of time. Girls? All right, let's just stay cool, and we'll go downtown and straighten this out later. But we have to get through the wedding first for Piper. For Piper. You're supposed to say, "For Piper." Yeah, all right. It better be a quick wedding. Everything looks perfect, except, Victor, could you move a little to your left? Sure, why? Well, to make room for... - Patty. - Hello, Victor. How are you? Good. I mean, I was good. All right, who brought my ex-wife back from the dead? Not now, Victor. I know you two have issues, but that's what the reception is for. We did it. It's really happening. - Prue! - Who in the hell is that? Oh, oh, oh, no. Prue! T.J. - You came. - Had to beat the cops. - I won't let them take you. - Prue, what the hell is going on? Prue, you get your astral ass back here. Oh, honey. All right. That's it. The wedding is off. - Phoebe. - Sorry. Sorry. Piper. Piper, wait, think about this. Piper. Piper! You cannot just leave. Yes, I can. A demon I could have handled. But my big sister ruining my wedding, I cannot handle that. Just listen to me for one second. All we have to do is find a way... No. No. I don't wanna find a way to get married on my wedding day. It's just... It's too hard. There must be a reason. - Piper... - Leo, I'm sorry, but this is just the final straw. It's just not meant to be. I've never seen Piper so defeated. Prue. Come on, wake up. Prue, come on. Honey, you won't get her back that way. A part of Prue wanted to escape, and it used her astral self to do it. If the wedding's off, I have to go. I'm only here to conduct the ceremony. I'm sorry. Maybe Piper's right. Maybe the wedding just wasn't meant to be. - Victor. - All I'm saying is maybe the gods are trying to spare them the pain that we went through. No. All I need is what's inside me to know that Piper and I are meant to be together. What happened here today... Piper and Leo's love has touched us all. We have to fix this. I gotta go fend off the posse. What posse? Prue's wanted for murder. I'll stay in touch by cell phone. Murder? - You knew about this? - I found out when Morris told Prue. But it's obviously a mistake. I mean, Prue wouldn't murder anybody. Are you sure? I mean, Prue's astral form seems to have taken on a life of its own. - How do you know she didn't do it? - Because I know her. - Oh, yeah. - At least I think I do. All right. All right, you guys find Piper, bring her back here somehow. Phoebe, Book of Shadows, see if there's a spell to bring astral Prue back. Cole, you and me are gonna do a little investigating of our own. All right, come on, you guys. We've got a wedding to save. Interesting place to dream about. Especially for Prue. Based on what Morris said, someone must have knifed the victim after astral Prue left. By the looks of this crowd, it could be anybody. No, not anybody. Very few humans have the heart of a true killer. One who kills without prejudice. How do you know? I can always sense it. Before I suppressed my demonic side for Phoebe, I could sense how human killers felt inside. He's here. The murderer? Are you sure? That he's our murderer, no, but he's got fresh blood on his hands. Go, get Morris. Just let me do the talking. You always said the wrong thing when they were young. Well, wrong according to you. You weren't open to what I had to say, because you wanted to raise them as witches... ...instead of little girls. We were worried. I'm sorry, I let everyone down. Honey, you have nothing to apologise for. It is a tribute to you and Leo that you made it as far as you did, I think. But we didn't make it all the way. - Not yet, maybe, but... - Not ever. I mean, I think it's obvious. Don't you? - Leo and I are just clearly not... - Destined to be? I don't believe that. And I don't think that you really believe that either. Don't I? All I have to do is look at you and Dad to see where I might end up if I marry Leo. I mean, look at the track record. As Halliwells, we are blessed as witches, and we are cursed as women. Sometimes I think we're all just destined to end up alone. Well, you don't really... I mean, just because... Victor. You think your mother and I were cursed. - Don't you? - Honestly, I look back on those days as the best of my life. I loved your mother. She was the best thing that ever happened to me until the three of you came along. But your marriage still didn't last. Yeah, and it hurt. A lot. But it was our love that gave birth to you and your sisters. Maybe that was my destiny. I'm sorry, I just need to be alone. Not bad for a guy who always says the wrong thing. Thanks. I just wish I knew that it helped. Gotcha. I just gotta know, how'd you get away from the cops? You know, I don't really wanna talk about that. I mean, I'm here now. That's all that really matters, right? Yeah, but for how long? Do you care? Well, I did crash your sister's wedding. - Yes, you did. - And... ...I am harbouring you from the cops. And I appreciate that. I mean, definitely past first-date behaviour here. So then why are you still talking? Prue, I don't need much, but I need to know one thing. Are you gonna take off on me again tonight? You know, I hadn't really thought about it. For the first time in my life, I'm free, so I'm sort of just living moment to moment. - Is that okay? - I'm cool with that. "Cool with that"? - Oh, not now. - What's wrong? Prue. Prue, where you going? No. I am free. I am not going back. I wanna... No, I will not let you take me. Nice spell, huh? - How dare you. - How dare you. You destroyed Piper's wedding along with Piper. I don't know what's going on with you, but you've got to pull yourself together. I am out of here. You know what? You cannot stop me, all right? I am never going back. I'm not going... All right, you know what? I am sick of this. She is all about duty and obligation. Well, not me. All right, I want to be free. I wanna find love. I wanna have a life. Well, Prue, you have responsibilities whether you like it or not. Don't talk to me about being responsible, all right? You were not very responsible when you went and fell in love with a demon. Oh, please, we... You have got to let this whole Cole thing go, okay? You can't stay mad at me forever. I'm not mad at you, Phoebe. I never was. All right? She was. I was rooting for you. Okay, now you're scaring me. You risked everything for love, just like Piper and Leo. I dream of having that kind of freedom, but instead I get stuck watching my sisters live my dream. Wait a minute. You astralled out in a dream when your subconscious takes over. - So what? - So I just studied this. It's Psych 101, Freud. You're the id, Prue's inner desires. Which means that she is the ego, the control factor. Yeah, well, she is one big remote control, and she's always got me on pause. I think I understand. The sacrifices that you've made for us over the years, they made you suppress your inner desires. Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell her. No, I'm telling you because you are a Prue. I mean, you're both two sides of my sister. Prue, you have to stop devoting your entire self to the Charmed Ones. It'll tear you apart. Literally. Is Piper very mad at me? She'll get over it. And you know why? Because we're okay now, Piper and me. We've both got passion and purpose in our lives. And you gave us that. - I did? - You took care of us. And now it's time to take care of you. Welcome back. Thanks. For everything. Oh, no. I cannot believe I wrecked Piper's wedding. Only part of you did. Is it too late to fix it? Oh, now what? Freeze! Stay where you are. Don't move. Prue Halliwell, you're under arrest for murder. All right, sit down. The inspector will be with you shortly. This is all our fault. Look, Prue's been booked for murder. We're running out of time. Leo says you found the killer. Found a killer. Oh, great, you mean you don't know? What are you gonna do, ask him? That's a good idea. Why don't you meet me out front in five. Is that the spot where they found the body? Who are you? I'm here to find out what you know about the murder that took place here last night. Why don't you show me your badge. Oh, no, no, I'm not a cop. I'm a fortune-teller. And I predict you're gonna give me a confession. You think you're a funny man, huh? Why don't you excuse me, huh? I guess that's the knife you used on the victim when you found him unconscious? You want a closer look at it, huh? One more chance. Confess to the murder - and talk to the police. - Or what, huh? Or deal with me. I think he's ready to talk. I don't get it. Prue should be back by now. The police have the killer. They might have held her over for escaping custody. Can we get some light while we're waiting? No, Dad, the police cut the power line. I'm sorry, Patty. They sent me to take you back. No, it's not midnight yet. We still have five more minutes. I should have said something more to convince Piper. You said everything. You were wonderful. - Sorry we're late. - What, not who you were expecting? So, okay, what are we waiting for? Don't look so shocked. Girls, it's showtime. A little help here. I noticed you don't have a best man. If you like, I could... I'd be honoured. Oh, no, there's no power for music. All right, is that the best that we can do on the lights? That's more like it. We are gathered here today to unite two souls as one. Do you, Leo Wyatt and Piper Halliwell, join us here of your own free will to acknowledge the eternal bond shared by you both? - I do. - I do. You may face each other, join hands. Leo, you may recite your vows. Piper, through all the tears and struggles, I always knew in my heart that we'd make it here. I promise to love and respect you from this point forward as your husband. As my wife, my lover, my friend and my soul mate, all I am is yours. Piper. Leo, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I was afraid that you were too good to be true, that maybe I didn't deserve someone so pure and beautiful and loving as you are. But here we are, surrounded by the people that I love the most. And I feel so proud and so blessed to be your wife. Leo, I was born to love you, and I always will. Here, before witnesses, Leo and Piper have sworn their vows to each other. With this cord, I bind them to those vows. Heart to thee, body to thee, always and forever, so mote it be.
