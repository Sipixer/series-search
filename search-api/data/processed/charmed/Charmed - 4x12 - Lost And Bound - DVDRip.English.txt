fold the laundry. No. What good is being a witch if I can't just twitch my nose and make the laundry fold itself? Which witch can do that? Samantha Stephens. From Bewitched? Oh, it's only, like, one of my favourite old television shows. Sometimes I forget that you've only been fully human for, like, a month. And becoming more human by the day. What would you say if I became really human... ...and got a job? If that's the criteria for being really human, then I am in big trouble. I'm serious. Paige said that a lawyer at Legal Aid quit, so she kind of... ...recommended me. She did? Of course, if you don't think I should, then-- No, no. Actually, I think that's a great idea. It'll keep you busy and help you find your identity while I lose mine. - Sorry? - Nothing. Tell me. It's just... ...becoming a wife. I mean, I like Samantha, but I never actually wanted to become her. See, Samantha, she was married to a human, Darrin. Darrin completely repressed Samantha's magic. Completely denied who she was. And it wasn't because he didn't love her. It was just... That's the way it had to be. And this was one of your favourite shows? Well, not that part. It's just, growing up, that was my only role model for a typical marriage. So that's all I knew. And he was able to meet people and leave the house and go to work and build his career. And she had to stay home. You know, and cook dinner and do the laundry. She went from being Samantha to being Mrs. Darrin Stephens overnight. Well, that won't happen to you. - Won't it? - No. You'll become Mrs. Cole Turner. Phoebe, come on. Number one, this is a different time, different world, obviously. Number two, we're hardly typical. I proposed to you under a hail of demon goo, and you accepted while I was bleeding to death. Remember? Look, why don't we just... ...do it again, start over. Grams' ring. - Where did you get that? - From Piper. She gave it to me. So I could give it to you. Well, that's not exactly a good omen. She was married with that thing six times. Well, she must have liked something about it, or she would have stopped at, like, three. Right? Miss Phoebe Halliwell, I come to you, a man, nothing more, nothing less, to ask, will you be my wife? Yeah. I will. Again. Good. Tyler, we just wanna talk. It was an accident. I'm sorry. - It's all right. Just let us in. - No, you'll yell at me. I'll deal with Tyler. You contact Ludlow. Who's Ludlow? He runs the academy we told you about. I'm not going to boarding school. You can't send me away. Oh, honey, it's for your own good. I told you, I didn't mean to do it. I swear I'm not bad. I swear. Tyler? What's going on? Is that smoke I smell? Sun came up again. Good morning, sunshine. Let me pour you a cup of coffee. Notice anything different about me? Engagement ring. Notice it, or wear coffee. - Nice ice. - Thank you very much. I can't stop looking at it. I was like that when I got my belly ring. Oh, you're right, a wedding ring is totally different. - Phoebe? - Yeah. Will you pass me the milk? It's right next to Leo. We're not talking to each other. What? Still? Wait, I don't understand. Shouldn't you wait till after you have kids to start fighting about them? Well, what's the matter? Maybe we can help. It's about having a magical child in a non-magical world. Someone, I won't say who, has the insane notion of binding our child's powers. Why is it insane? Grams bound your powers when you were a child. Yes. And we spent 20-odd years ignorant about our destiny. I look back on those normal days, and I feel like I was a complete and total fraud. I'm not saying hide the truth. It's just growing up is hard enough without the extra burden of having powers. Magic is not a burden. It is a gift. It's a lot for any child to deal with. Plus ours will be doubly magical. Half whitelighter, half witch. Hey, that's like me. You might have some trouble. - Where's Cole? We gotta go to work. - I'll get him. And, Paige, thank you so much for getting him this job. Especially now, you know, that we're gonna be married, and he's gonna have to get used to bringing home the bacon. Since when does Phoebe care about bacon? I'm sure she meant all breakfast meats. Piper, would you please pass me the milk? Nope. Oh, honey, you look gorgeous. Should I make you some breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day. - I'll grab a coffee on the way. - Are you sure? I could whip something up in a jiff. - In a jiff, really? - Yeah. Come on, dude, let's get paid. Have a great day. I am so proud of you. Look at us. We are so Bewitched. No, no, no. No, we're not. You feel free to use all the magic you want while I'm gone. Okay. Whatever makes you happy. I wonder what I should make him for dinner? So this is your office. It's got a desk, a chair, a lamp. What more do you need? Oxygen. You know, when I was a DA, I had an office eight times this size. Windows, an assistant. Plus, I could throw energy balls. Yeah, well, you're human now, so get used to being humble, just like all the rest of us. Cole Turner? Hi, I'm Cynthia Corn, - director of the Legal Aid office. - Hi. Paige has told me such wonderful things about you. I wish I had time to get to know you, but I don't. - So jumping right in, if we could. - I have to jump right out. If anyone needs me, I'll be down the hall. Okay, your first case. Slumlord Alan Yates cut off heat to his tenants last week. He's due in at 1 2 for a fact-finding session. You have two hours to learn everything you can about this case. So you better be fast, and you better be good. Thanks. Thank you. I'm only human, you know. Hi. Hey. What's with the kid? The police brought him in. Found him sleeping in an alley. - Is he a runaway? - Looks like it. His name is Tyler. I'm having trouble getting information from him. Sometimes those little video-game things help loosen them up. Billy's got one in the back. I'll go get it. Good. Here you go, Tyler, thought you might be thirsty. So have you thought about giving us a phone number so we can call your parents, letting them know you're okay? Do you want them to know you're okay? - Did they hurt you? - No. They didn't hurt me. Good, all right. - But something happened? - I don't wanna talk about it. I know it's hard, Tyler, - but talking is how we fix things. - I said, I don't want to talk about it! Fire. Get the fire extinguisher. Hey. Hey, hey, don't go. You don't have to be afraid. It's okay. I won't tell anyone I saw you start the fire. You saw? Yeah, but nobody else did. And I promise I won't tell. I swear I won't. I didn't mean to do it. I know, Tyler, I know. Please don't make me go back to the clinic. I don't ever wanna go back to my foster parents. They don't understand me. I know a place where I can take you where you'll be safe. But you gotta trust me, okay? Come on. - Sorry, I didn't see you there. - We're looking for our son. His name is Tyler, 1 1 years old, blond hair. - And you are...? - His foster parents. Is he here? Is he all right? - He was. - Thank God. We've been checking everywhere for him. - We've been worried sick. - What do you mean? - Where is he? - There was a fire, and in the chaos, he ran off. Ran off? What do you mean, you lost him? Where could he have gone? We've got to find him. - I mean, right now. - I understand this must be difficult. You don't understand anything. We need our son, and we need him now. Would you give me a moment with my wife? She's obviously very distraught. Of course. You're making a scene. Can't a mother be upset about the loss of her son? You're not reacting like an overreacting parent. - You're reacting like a-- - A what? - A demon. - We don't have time to play the concerned parents. Ludlow wants the boy before nightfall. - No boy, no bounty. - These humans can't help. So, what are we supposed to do? Wait until Tyler uses his power again? It's the only way we have of tracking him. - What if he doesn't get angry? - He will. Just be patient. How's it going? Not so good. He's barely making eye contact. Not really speaking. - He's just really afraid. - Of what? Himself, his powers. He's showing the signs of a kid who's never received sustained affection. Well, plus being shuffled in and out of foster homes doesn't help either. No, and I get the sense that he's always felt like an outsider and a bit of a freak. And now he's found out that, in some ways, he kind of is. Which is why it could make sense for us to bind his powers. Yeah, maybe we could just take off one of his legs at the same time because, you know, they're both part of him. It is not the same thing, Piper. Tyler's powers could be a danger to himself and to others. You know what? Don't make our issues his issues. I think you need to give him a chance to learn how to control it. Maybe that's why we met him. - To teach him, guide him. - Feed him. Wow, Phoebe, you went all out. Oh, well, you know me. Any excuse to spend a little extra time in the kitchen. I do know you, and that's just not true. But it is now that I'm gonna be Sadie, Sadie, married lady. All right, Sadie, how about I take the cookies to the kid? Do you mind if I try talking to him? No, actually, the sooner we get through to him, the better because last time I checked, kidnapping is still illegal. I'm gonna go back to work. You guys call me later. Eat them while they're hot. Pheebs, friendly little tip. Lay off the hair spray. There's a firestarter in the house. Hi. My sister made some cookies. Do you want some? I don't blame you. It could be kind of dicey. She's not really a great cook. Why don't you try one so, you know, her feelings don't get hurt. Can I have another? Help yourself. You know, it's probably hard to believe, but something amazing has happened to you. You've been given a gift. A magical gift. And as strange as it sounds, you're not alone. I know exactly what you're going through. Yeah, right. You start fires too? Not exactly. But I do know what it's like to possess a power that you can't control and to want so desperately to be normal, but it's just not an option. And because there aren't any options, you just sometimes get so angry that you wanna-- What was that? What did you just do? I proved that I know what you're going through. But how did you do that? Pretty much the same way you do. I've just learned how to focus my emotions and control it. I wish I could control mine. Then I could be around people. Is that why you ran away? Because you were afraid you were gonna hurt someone? I was scared. I set fire to the living-room couch. I didn't mean to. But my foster mom was yelling at me, that I was "good-for-nothing." And it made me so mad, I just... I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. In this house, it's okay. I can also freeze things. Now, that's cool. Leo? Could you get some water? Oh, Leo, I'm so glad you came in. I have a very important question to ask you. What is it? Do you think that little boy will be staying for lunch? I would imagine so. What's the important question? That was it. Really? Phoebe? - Are you feeling all right? - Peachy keen. I'll get it. - Hello. - You gotta keep me from killing this slumlord. I got a meeting in, like, ten minutes with a guy who's the biggest ass. Hold it. Do not make me march down there and wash your mouth out with soap, mister. Do you want me to twitch my nose and turn him into Mr. Nice? No, I want to use an energy ball and send him where he belongs. The jerk cut off the heat, causing an elderly tenant to get pneumonia. - Then he tried to evict her. - Okay, just relax and try to get through it, and I will have a martini - waiting for you when you get home. - Martini? Yeah, and a steak. You really need some more red meat in your diet. What the hell are you talking about? Company. I have to go. I'll get it! - Hello. - Hi. Hi. We're looking for our son, Tyler. Is he here, by any chance? You betcha. Come on in. Can I make you anything? A sandwich, - a Spanish omelette, perhaps? - Wait. How did you know he was here? Maternal instinct. Piper. I got him. - Leave them alone. - Nobody is keeping us - from collecting our bounty. - No. Stop. Shut up, Tyler. I didn't mean to. Tyler, you don't have to explain anything. We were there, we saw what happened. I thought I was gonna hurt someone, and then I did. You did what you had to do. I did a bad thing. Tyler, listen to me. Look at me. You didn't do a bad thing. Those were very bad people, and they were gonna hurt us. You protected us. Come on, I want to show you something. Come on, it's okay. A book? Not just any book. It's a magical one. Can I trust you? Sure. Yeah. Okay, let's find out who those people really were. My foster parents? They weren't really your foster parents, Tyler. - They were... - Demonic bounty hunters. "Driven by greed, these heartless low-level demons will stop at nothing to collect their bounty." So if they're bad, does that mean - I didn't do anything bad? - That's right. Is there anything about me in there? Actually, I think there is. Here it is. You read. "The firestarter. An extremely rare and coveted magical creature." What does "coveted" mean? It means "highly desirable, wanted." I'm wanted? Very much so. "Their power is linked to their emotions. First manifests itself in adolescence. They're often trained to be the bodyguards of The Source." What's The Source? A really, really bad guy. Which means he's probably resurfacing if the bounty hunters are after Tyler. So Ludlow must be a bounty hunter too, then. - Who is Ludlow? - Some guy who runs some sort of an academy. My demon parents were gonna send me there. To train, to serve The Source. So then I am bad. - Why do you say that? - Well, if I'm supposed to use my powers to protect somebody bad... No, but that's not how powers work. They're not good or bad by themselves. It's how we use them. Tyler, why don't you read a little more while I talk to Piper. Okay. See? With a little guidance, he's already on the road to acceptance and control. That's great, but I think we have another problem. I figured out how the bounty hunters found out where Tyler is. They tracked his powers. - When he blew up the chair? - Yeah. So when he vanquished them... So there may be other bounty hunters on the way. I'm making soup for Cole He'll eat it in a bowl I guess that's my new role Just making soup for Cole Where's the firestarter? You nearly scared me half to death. The boy, now. I don't like your tone of voice, mister. - Are you all right? - Yeah. No messy cleanup. Since when do you scream instead of fight? Actually, I did consider scratching him. Okay, that was another bounty hunter, which means more are just gonna keep coming until Ludlow gets Tyler. Unless we get Ludlow first. Dishpan hands. Leo and I can pose as bounty hunters and say that we have Tyler. We can gain access to Ludlow and vanquish him. Sure. Just as long as you're home for dinner. But he's gotta be pretty powerful, which means we might need the power of three for us to bring Ludlow back here, just in case. And call Paige and tell her to get her butt back here - as soon as possible. - Okey-dokey. Oh, God, I'll have everything done for you in one second, okay? Two secs. - Paige Matthews. - Serena? Sam. Phoebe? Look, I'm in the middle of about a zillion things. - Can I just call you back? - Piper wants you to come home. And I want you to bring your appetite. Yeah, Phoebe, like I said, I'm in the middle of a zillion things. Back off. This is assault. It's better than what you do, which is close to murder. - Stay away from me. - You would not believe - what Cole is doing. - Cole? How is my little sweetie? - Get up, you scum! - I'll see you in court. You'll see me every time you turn around, buddy. I don't believe this. Let go of him. - What are you doing? - I want that heat turned back on for those tenants today, do you hear me? Hands off me. This is not the way we do things around here. Yeah, well, maybe you should. - Or maybe I should quit! - You're fired! He looks so normal. You sure we should let him play those games? Aren't they kind of violent? Darn it! Looks like he's learning to handle his power. He wouldn't have been given them if he couldn't. Is that what you think about you and your sisters? I don't know. Maybe. All I do know is that, when we finally got our powers back, it felt like we were scrambling to catch up. And I can't help but think if we'd had our powers from day one, we would have been more prepared. Things would have turned out different. Prue would still be alive? And The Source would be dead. And we would be on our way to having a family, as opposed to just talking about it. And life - would be perfect. - Not perfect. Just easier. Obviously, when I recommended you for the job, I thought you were a former demon. You know, do me a favour, Paige, and don't do me any more favours. - Good, Paige, you're home. - Yeah, but not for long. I have to get back to work unlike Cole here. The Legal Aid thing didn't work out for me. See, I thought lawyers were supposed to seek out justice. Okay, we've got bigger problems. The Source wants Tyler. So let's focus on the most pressing matter at hand. - Lunch. - Phoebe. Darling, what a pleasant surprise. You feeling okay? Oh, yeah. Happy as a clam. Why? What was that? What was what? You just flashed. Black and white. Oh, don't be silly. Oh, he's not being silly. We all saw it. Okay, we don't have time for this. We gotta get to Ludlow before The Source does. So, Cole, fix Phoebe. I don't care how but just do it. She needs to write a spell. - Which spell? - A power-of-three spell, in case Leo and I have no choice but to lure Ludlow back here. Biscuits are ready. We'll need some proof for Ludlow that we actually have Tyler. - We're gonna take his jacket. - Why can't I come with you? Because it's too dangerous. But I can protect myself. Besides, I helped you out before. - Didn't l? - This is different. Okay, everyone, be ready, be prepared. No surprises. Hey! - What happened? - He jumped the orb! Dude, you are so going back right now. Who are you? What are you doing here? We got lost. The academy is protected by charms, which means you can't find the place unless you're looking for it. Kill them. - Let's get out of here. - I'm not going. You wanna bet? Hey. I said, no. Look, just listen to me. They don't know I'm a firestarter yet. Once they do, they'll take us right to Ludlow. Isn't that what we want? No. Not at your expense, and I'm not gonna let you go in there. And I don't wanna spend the rest of my life with bad guys chasing me. He's right. Wherever we take him, they will eventually find him. Yeah, but if something happens to him-- They won't hurt me. Remember? I'm coveted. Well, if he tags along, it might double your chances of getting Ludlow and not having to go home. I'd like to do something good for once. All right, but you stay next to me. And if anything goes wrong, we're out of there. Okay. This better work. - Hi. - How'd you--? We're bounty hunters. We need to see Ludlow. - Who's the kid? - I'm not a kid. I'm a firestarter. So are you gonna let us in or not? - What's the password? - The password? It's... That was it. You're in. Oh, hi, honey. What are you doing? This is no time to be taking a bath. Piper might be home, and she's counting on you - to write a spell. - Oh, I tried. And I only got as far as "hey, demon," and then my mind went blank. Look, I don't know what's happening to you. It might be some backfired spell or curse or something. But you gotta snap out of it. There's work to be done. Yeah. Hey, why aren't you at the office? Because I quit my job. - You what? - I don't think I'm cut out - for that whole 9-to-5 life. - Oh, honey, what will you do? I don't know. I'm still searching for who I am. But we know who you are, which is a demon-fighting, ass-kicking witch who never lets her sisters down. So get out of that bathtub and show me what you're made of! Better? Cole, how's your progress going--? Oh, God! Full-frontal Phoebe. Sorry. - She just-- She just flashed. - Yeah, I got that. No, I mean she just flashed black and white. Again? She's like an old TV that's on the blink or something. Hey, maybe that's the connection. The TV show Bewitched, is that in black and white or colour? Originally black and white. I'm very chilly. - Phoebe, sit down. - Okay. Why are you asking me about Bewitched? Phoebe was worried about becoming an old-fashioned housewife Iike Samantha. And that might be fine for some people, but for Phoebe, that could be dangerous. So I'll take care of her, and you need to write the power-of-three spell. No, I've never done that before. Well, you're gonna have to learn fast, so go. Hurry. - And you. - Yeah. You're coming with me. Okay. So we're gonna try to take him out, right? Yes, I will go in first. What if I can't--? I mean, I have to get angry for my power to work, don't l? - So? - So, what if I'm just scared instead? What if it doesn't work? Just walk through that door. - Through the door? - Yes. Through the door. Relax. Where is he? Ludlow. So... ...you brought the alleged firestarter. You've given us quite the run-around, haven't you, boy? I said, haven't you, boy? - Yes. - Yes, what? Yes, sir. No one teaches manners anymore. About our payment, see, we don't want any surprises. Yeah, because we hate surprises. What are you doing? Oh, you're afraid that I'll grab the boy and stiff you? If the child is a firestarter, you'll get your reward. If he's not... ...you'll all die. Well, Tyler is a firestarter, so that won't be an issue. Prove it. Go ahead. Give him everything you got. What? Not even a flicker? Okay, he's just a little scared. Oh, that's ridiculous. Don't be scared, boy. You're closing in on the most important moment of your life. Prove what you are, and you'll meet The Source, the most powerful evil that exists in the universe. Yeah, okay, see, that's not helping. - Do it. - He's just a kid. - Do it, boy! - I mean it, lay off of him! - lnsolent! How dare you! - No! Excellent. Well done. - What did you do to him? - Just a precaution until The Source arrives to kill him and steal his power. - But-- - Your bounty's outside. Leo, hurry. Go get him. It's a force field. I can't blast through it. - I'll go get your sisters. - Leo. I know. Hurry. It's a disaster there. Ludlow has Tyler. - It's a disaster down here too. - Piper needs her sisters immediately. Oh, I'll be right with you, as soon as I finish this sleeve. A child is in danger, Phoebe. We need you now. Phoebe? Who's Phoebe? She can't go with you. She doesn't even know who she is anymore. I beg your pardon. I know exactly who I am. I am Mrs. Cole Turner. This is all wrong. Ever since I put that ring on your finger, - you've been acting strange. - You mean I've been acting normal? Which is strange for you, you know. I gotta be honest. If this is what being married to you is gonna be like, - you can take that ring off now. - I will not. This ring is a symbol of our love. That's it. - It's the ring. We gotta get it off. - Over my dead body. That won't be necessary. Grams' ring, please. - No. - Listen to this inscription. "To gain another is to lose yourself." - Grams cursed the ring. Why? - I don't know. Good question. Look. Are you feeling better? I feel a little faint. Can you hold it together? We gotta go. I don't know. I'm still a little confused. Well, nothing will remind you of who you are better than saving an innocent. Now go to work. I can't get in. You gotta write a spell. - Are you up to it? - I think so. Door unlock No magic block - That's it? - Come here. Door unlock No magic block Honey, maybe we should go back and check the Book of Shadows again. I can't leave Tyler here. It doesn't look like you have much of a choice. No! Please. Please don't hurt me. Stand back. No. Please. What was that? I think you just saw a mother lift a car off her child. All the pain... ...is over. Soon... ...you will serve... ...The Source. - I'm back. - I paid you your bounty. Yeah, that's not what I'm after. - Power-of-three spell? - I don't have one. - What? - I don't have one. I did one. The brittle winter Gives way to flowers of spring Ludlow is vanquished What the hell was that? It's a haiku. I couldn't do the rhyming thing. - Leo, he's frozen. - I got him. His hand is starting to warm up. He's gonna make it. Let's get back to the gate and orb home. Are you sure you wanna do this? It's completely up to you. Yeah, I'm sure. It's an awful lot to give up. No, it's not. Not for me. All right, here you go. It will bind your powers. It won't strip them, but it'll bind them. - Say, "Excuse me." - Excuse me. Ludlow's right, nobody teaches manners anymore. - Do you think it worked? - Try it. Look at something and get mad. Just think of Ludlow. I didn't hurt it. I'm normal. Whatever that means. - Where are you going? - To play video games. Still wanna have a baby? I'm just not ready for an adolescent yet. Well, Paige said she found a pretty good family, not too far from here. I'm glad because I want visitation rights. Plus, you know, I have to be in touch, in case he ever wants his powers back. You think he will? I don't know. He's a surprising kid. Yeah, like the piggyback orb. I was so focused on how I was gonna guide him. Then he ended up guiding me. - How? - Well, you know how I was upset with Grams for binding our powers, Ieaving us unprepared for our magical future? - You mentioned it once or twice. - Well, now, I see the wisdom in her decision. She realised, someday, we were gonna have to battle demons. But she also realised that children shouldn't live in fear. They need to feel safe, to explore and learn and grow. I still think magic is a gift. But Grams gave us the greatest gift of all. A normal childhood. The gift of innocence. Okay, okay, stop splashing. I'll say it. Cole Turner is the greatest lawyer in all of the world. The greatest unemployed lawyer in all of the world. Although Mr. Yates did respond to my persuasive argument and got the tenants' heat back on. And he's not gonna press charges? Nope. His lawyer thought the case would raise more issues than it closed. I am so proud of you. Now, that was colourful. Okay, now, I think I figured out what Grams did to this ring here. - Did you, now? - I think to keep her from making a seventh mistake, she put a hex on the ring. So that if she ever got engaged again, the ring would remind her of what she hated about marriage. The loss of identity, the subjugation by a man, the focus on housework. All those things that I was afraid of. But Grams was from a different era. That's not gonna happen to us. Sitting and knitting is not the woman you are, just like sitting and typing is not the man I am. No, I can't picture you doing that. But can you picture us together, or are you so freaked out by marriage - that you don't--? - No. I wanna marry you. We just have to work extra hard to make sure neither one of us loses our identity. And as for Grams
