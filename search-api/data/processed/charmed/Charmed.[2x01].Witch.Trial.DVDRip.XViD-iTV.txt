- What are you doing? - Hi. - Hi. "Sister witches"? I can't believe you said that. - What's the matter with you? - How was I to know you'd be here with anybody? Last I heard you were meeting a banker friend about the loan. - Is this the credit check? - It's not what you think. We were just... We were just kissing, that's all. You don't have to justify it. You're single, you're responsible, you're way overdue in the sex department, I say go for it. I'm not way overdue. All right, maybe a little, but that's besides the point. I would never just sleep with a guy to get something, you know that. Give yourself a break. You're going through a lot. No job, straining to buy the club, you haven't heard from Leo in weeks. All right, well, the preview is at 5 and the auction's Sunday at 11. Oh, no, Prue, go back outside. Go on, hurry. Okay. - So you must be Prue. - No, actually. All right, great. Yeah, I'll see you then. She's Prue. I'm Phoebe. Rob, can we take a rain check on the rest of the evening? It's getting kind of crowded in here. - Okay, sure. - Yeah, okay. So I'll meet you tomorrow at the club at noon. Great. Thanks for dinner. - Okay. All right. Bye. - Bye. See you. - So did you get the loan? - Hopefully. I'll find out tomorrow. Well, my fingers are crossed. Wait. You guys, where are you going? Oh, I have an auction coming up, I have clients to call. Wait, you guys, don't you even know what tomorrow is? It's our one-year anniversary of becoming witches. Hello. - Tomorrow is, really? - So... "So"? "So"? It's a day to celebrate. Not just because it's our anniversary. But because it falls on one of the most powerful Wiccan days of the year, the autumnal equinox. Now, according to this witch that I met today at the bookstore... Hold it, a witch? You didn't tell her about us, did you? Well, yeah, sure I did. Why not? I mean, I didn't tell her that we're magical witches, obviously. Look, I'm sorry, but I think after everything we've been through, it's important to learn as much as we can about who we are. Forewarned is forearmed. And I think that we should leave well enough alone. I mean we've been demon-free for over a month now. - I'd like to keep it that way. - Amen to that. Prue! Piper! - What's going on? - I don't know. Why does the book do that? How does the book do that? "Rite of passage, fight it with the power of one or else." What the hell was that? The Book of Shadows. Where's the Book of Shadows? So much for being demon-free. - Did you find anything? - Nothing. Whatever it was came out of nowhere and disappeared into nowhere. Well, it took the Book of Shadows somewhere. And he's powerful too. No other demon's been able to steal the book. Oh, but if he's so powerful, then why didn't he kill us? He probably didn't want to go up against you. Me? What do you mean? That's what the Book of Shadows says. "Fight it with the power of one." That's gotta mean your power, - it's the strongest. - Says who? Says every demon or warlock we've ever gone up against. She's right, Prue, the power of one's gotta mean you, otherwise it would have said the power of three. The only question is, how are we gonna find this demon? We don't know anything about him. Well, we better think of something fast, because without the Book of Shadows, we're not the Charmed Ones anymore. Coming! - Hi. - Can I use your phone, please? - Well, actually we're... - Please, it's an emergency. Please? Okay, come on in. It's right around that corner. - Are you out of your mind? - What was I supposed to do, say no? - Look at that poor girl. - Jenny? Jenny, come on, talk to me. International operator, please. Saudi Arabia. - Saudi Arabia? - I'm sorry. We're moving in next door, or at least we're trying to. The phone's not hooked up yet. - So you're our new neighbours? - Name's Dan. Dan Gordon. I don't care if the circuits are busy. I have to talk to my mom. And that's my niece, Jenny, who is obviously not talking to me. Jenny? Sweetie, come on. - I'm sorry. It was nice meeting you. - You too. I saw him first. Demons now, drooling later. I have to meet my client before the preview. Oh, wait a minute. The scariest demon we've ever run across opens up some portal in our attic and steals the Book of Shadows, and you want to go into the office? What's the matter with her? It's the first demon she's faced since Andy died. Maybe it's bringing up some bad memories. - What are we doing here? - Celebrating the equinox. Can't you just feel it? The energy in this place? - It's a convergence. - It's a crock. I thought we were supposed to meet your witch friend. We are. This is where she told us to meet her. - Now, please, just relax. - Relax. My life was a mess before our little wake-up call this morning, remember? Oh, Stevie. Hey, Phoebe. I'm so glad you could make it. Actually we're not here for this. We needed to talk to you about something. This is my sister Piper. - Hi. - Hey, Piper. It's very nice to meet you. Are you a witch too? Sort of. Maybe. I don't know. Is everybody here one also? Oh, no. No, no, no. It's just a group of believers. Women who know of this special place and have come to celebrate. By the way, happy anniversary. That's what we wanted to talk to you about. Why did you say that today was gonna be a powerful day for us? Because your anniversary falls on the equinox, which is a powerful day in and of itself. For you, this convergence of powers is even stronger, the potential greater. All you have to do is connect. - You wanna try it? - Try it? How? Let us begin. - I don't wanna connect. - We have to connect. I don't wanna try it. - Okay, but we have to because... - Why? What have we got to lose, okay? Well, apparently we've got our clothes to lose. - I see that. - No. Whoa! Whoa, wait! What are you doing? When in Rome. No, no. We're not in Rome, Phoebe. We're in California, and it's illegal here. It's totally natural, okay? Go for it. Come on. God. This is ridiculous. - Can I keep my shoes on? - Yeah, but that's it. - We have absolutely zero information. - Everybody's naked, not just you. - And now we're naked. - Okay? The power of three. - Did you just hear that? - Hear what? The power of three. That. - Grams. - Grams? What? Where? I don't hear anything. Mrs Milton? - Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, no problem. I was just looking around. I think that we'll have a great turnout for the preview. We've gotten an excellent response to your husband's collection. I'm not surprised. Now, the opening bid prices may look a little low, but don't worry. It should attract a lot of buyers, which should result in a bidding war. It's the best way to sell inventory like this at top dollar. Is that all right with you? I guess I'm having a little more trouble letting go of John's things than I thought. That's only natural. It's not easy. I suppose that you deal with death quite a bit in your line of work, don't you? I mean, like this, auctioning off some poor widow's inheritance. This. Unfortunately, yes. L... I just keep going over and over in my mind the last time I saw him before the accident. And I keep thinking if only I'd done something or said something to stop him from getting in the car, maybe he'd still be alive. Oh, God. Rob, I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck at this thing, and then my sister needed a ride, and I'm... So I'm totally screwed on the loan now, aren't I? Don't be ridiculous. I'm just looking around, checking things out. It needs a lot of work, I know that. But that's not a problem. Just because the last two owners went bankrupt doesn't mean it can't work. I've done three separate marketing studies and found a 68-percent interest in the target clientele. - Piper... - Running a restaurant is very similar to running a club. You've already shown me all this. I've got it, I've got everything... ...except for an understanding of why you want to put yourself in a position to fail like this. Clubs are an extremely high-risk business. Piper, you could lose your shirt. Well, it wouldn't be the first time today. Look, I know what I'm getting myself into. I know the risks. Actually it's a lot less risk and a lot less expensive than starting my own restaurant, which is what I really wanted to do. The point is, I'm tired of working for somebody else and helping them realize their dreams. I want to run my own place. This place. And I can do it too, but not without your help. Well, at the risk of your never wanting to go out with me again... ...congratulations. - I got it? - You got it. Yay. Were you vanquished by the Charmed Ones? Yeah. Why? I'm giving you a second chance. The power of three. - Did you hear that? - The power of three. - Hear what? - Grams? You're dead, witch. Oh, my God. Jeremy? - Hello. - Prue, thank God you're there. - Jeremy just attacked me. - Piper, calm down. Jeremy? That is impossible. We vanquished him a year ago. Well, apparently he got unvanquished somehow. And since we don't have the book, we'll have to remember the spell together. I'm conferencing Phoebe. - Phoebe, are you there? - AT&T power of three. Okay, wait, wasn't that it? "The power of three will set us free"? Grams. - What's the matter? - He's... He's fighting through my freezes. He's adjusting or something. Okay, put us on speakerphone. We have to say it together. You're not getting away from me this time. Piper! - Piper. - Hurry, now! Hurry, now, now, now! - The power of three will set us free - The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us... - Piper? - Piper? Piper? It's okay, he's gone... ...again. How can you not have seen who attacked me? How is that possible? I don't know, I guess I was blocked or something, and then, he just sort of disappeared, you know? I'm starting to understand why this place keeps going under. Oh, no, it's not a bad crime area, not at all. Well, it's something I'm gonna be checking into. I can assure you of that. Excuse me, ma'am. Yeah, hey. How you doing? Are you okay? Physically, yeah. I think my loan's on shaky ground. I couldn't exactly tell Rob, "It was just a warlock, don't worry about it." Oh, it would be a shame if the loan didn't work out. I mean, this place is great. I used to come here. - It has a lot of potential. - Yeah, you think so? Care to loan me 60 grand? Any ideas on where Jeremy came from? No, but I don't want to run into any of the other demons we've already vanquished. Hopefully Phoebe can find some answers in those new books of hers. I sure wish she had our book to look at. Feels kind of lost without it. - Although... - Although what? It was weird, but right before Jeremy appeared, I swore I heard Grams. - Grams? - I was positive it was her. She said, "The power of three." And Phoebe said she heard her say it this morning. Maybe Grams was trying to warn me. Warn us. Hey there. - It's Jenny, right? - Yeah. We didn't really get to say hello before. My name is Phoebe. Phoebe Halliwell. And this is Kit, the cat. Get it? Kit cat? Little play on words. - So shouldn't you be in school? - I'm taking the week off. - Really? - For the move, you know? - So you're moving in with your uncle? - Just for the school year, - until my mom and dad come back. - From Saudi Arabia? My dad's with the State Department - so he gets transferred a lot. - That sucks. So did you ever get in touch with your mom? It doesn't matter. If it matters to you, it matters. Your secret's safe with me. Well, it's almost that time of the month, you know? And... Well, I need some... - Tampons. - Right, yeah. And you don't want to talk to your uncle about it? But I did. But he went out and bought sanitary napkins. Like that's gonna work. This is so embarrassing. So do you think maybe you could get some for me instead? Sure, but... - The connection. - But what? I'm really sorry, Jenny, but I have to go. Fine. Look, I would love to help you out. But I believe that your parents wouldn't have left you with your uncle if they didn't think you could trust him with stuff like this. Ask him again. And if he stills screws it up, remember, we're open 24 hours, seven days a week, right next door. Piper, wait up. I think I figured out how to find who the demon is. All we have to do is ask the Book of Shadows. What? It's been right in front of us the whole time. - Kit's collar? - No! The triquetra, the symbol of the power of three, our symbol. Maybe that's what Grams has been trying to tell us. Phoebe, you're rambling. Stevie said all we would have to do is find our connection, right? That if we did, we'd be able to tap into the power of the equinox. Well this has got to be it. The triquetra, it's us. It's on the cover of the Book of Shadows. I still don't understand how we can ask the book for help when we don't have the book. The spirit board? It told us how to find the Book of Shadows, right? It can do it again. All you have to do is believe. Now, come on. We're stronger together. - Okay. - Come on. Okay, close your eyes and feel it. The power of three. - Did you hear that? - Grams? - A. - B. - R. - A. X, A. S. Abraxas? Okay, I found it. "Abraxas, a demon of the astral plane who destroys witches, by demonizing their powers." Okay, but what does that have to do with the Book of Shadows? That's where our powers come from, isn't it? Maybe Abraxas is turning it evil somehow. That would definitely undo our spells and explain why Jeremy all of a sudden became unvanquished. And the Woogyman. When did the Woogyman become unvanquished? A couple seconds ago. - Freeze it. - It doesn't freeze, remember? The spell. What's the spell? Spell. Spell. I am light I am one too strong to fight - I can't remember the rest. - Yes, you can. Okay, we can. Return to dark where shadows dwell You cannot have this Halliwell Go away and leave my sight And take with you this endless night - That wasn't so hard. - It's a good thing we were together. Abraxas must be reading the book backwards, - that's how he's turning it evil. - How do you figure? The spell to vanquish Jeremy was at the back of the book. And the spell to vanquish the Woogyman was right before that. Which means more are on their way. We gotta warn Prue. What? What happened? I saw the warlock Nicholas... ...killing Prue. Prue, your sister Phoebe's on the phone. - Tell her that I'll call her back. - She said it's important. She always says that it's important. Just tell her I'll call her back, it's okay. Thanks. Mrs Milton? - Oh, hi. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I had no idea there would be this many people interested. You're obviously very good at your job. Actually, I think it says more about your husband's collection than it does about me. How long has it been since the accident? Eight and a half months. How long has it been for you? Not very long. Nicholas. Prue? You remember the feeling, don't you? Lavender, mimosa, holy thistle Cleanse this evil from our midst You're overheating. Your brain cells are frying. It's over. - Scatter its cells throughout time - No! Let this Nick no more exist Well, your blood pressure's back to normal. So is your temperature, your electrolytes. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were a perfectly healthy young woman. - Does that mean I can go home now? - Well, I'd like to run a few more tests. Find out what caused your body temperature to rise spontaneously like that. Has that ever happened to you before? It's happened to us all before. Doctor, it's okay, really. I know how to keep it from happening again. Well, all right. I'll see to your discharge papers then. - Thanks. - All right. - That was close. - Too close. No, I don't mean her, I mean you. The paramedic said you almost died. Yeah, what else is new? We'd better figure out a way to get the book back from Abraxas. If we don't, we're dead. But how? We don't know where the astral plane is. Yes, we do. It coexists within our own plane, remember? That's what Stevie said. Still doesn't help find the demon. Maybe, maybe not. I was thinking... You know how we always thought that nobody could take the Book of Shadows out of the house but us? Maybe nobody did. Maybe it's still in the house just on a different plane. The astral plane. That would mean Abraxas is still in the house too. Right. So we would need to find a doorway or a window to get to his plane like he used to get to ours. And we need to do this before the end of the equinox by sunrise tomorrow. And then Prue can kick some astral ass with the power of one. Prue, what's the matter? Nothing. I just think that it's a long shot, that's all. Well, at least it's a shot. I agree. I mean who knows how many other demons and warlocks he's let loose that we just don't know about yet. Or even worse, if Abraxas gets to the first page of the book - before we get to him, we're toast. - Why? Because it's the incantation that gave us our powers, remember? If Abraxas says that backwards too, then we'll lose them and the book forever. So we go back to leading normal lives again. - That doesn't sound so bad. - What? - Are you joking? - No, Phoebe, I'm not joking. Look, we always said that things happen to us for a reason, right? So maybe the reason this time is to give us an out. Prue, there's no out. Abraxas will kill us. Not if all he wants is the book. After all, that's the real power, not us. If all he wanted was the book, he wouldn't keep sending demons and warlocks after us. We won't have to worry about anymore if he gets to the first page. What are you saying, Prue? Look, if we don't get to him, we stop being witches. Exactly. Which means we stop risking our lives all the time. Which means we stop watching the people we love lose theirs. - Prue. - Let her be. We're screwed, you know. No, we're not. If there's a window, we'll find it. That's not what I meant. - She'll come around. - By sunrise? You know how Prue is when she makes up her mind about something. That's it. - We're screwed. - And we're out of wine. I'll get it, you keep dreaming. Oh, hi. - Dan. - Dan, right. You're Phoebe? Jenny told me. I hope it's okay to stop by. Of course. We were just doing some reading. Well, I just wanted to give you this to say thanks. You know, for talking to Jenny. Or better yet, for getting her to talk to me. That's really sweet. And timely too. But it's not necessary. Well, to be honest, I was sort of hoping to get something out of it. I mean, you know, for Jenny. Just in case she needs a woman to talk to again. Of course. Anytime. She seems like a great kid. So did she tell you what the problem was? Any idea what size I'm supposed to get? There's like five. - Junior is probably a safe bet. - Right. Thanks. - Well, see you around. - Hopefully. - Night. - Night. No, I understand. Okay, bye. - Who was that? - Rob, the banker, or rather his assistant, telling me that my loan has been denied. - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Just wasn't meant to be, I guess. Really glad I never slept with him though. What was I thinking? About Leo maybe. Wine? - Hey. - Hi. - You wanna sit down? - Sure. They haven't assigned me a new partner yet... ...since Andy died. Here. - I'm sorry I haven't come to see you. - Yeah, me too. I'm just glad you're here now, Prue. I've been worried about you. - I'm all right. - Really? Then how come you've been avoiding me? And don't give me that crap about being too busy, because I know better. I know what you're going through, Prue. I lost him too, you know? I know. - It's just been so hard to... - What? To face you after what happened. That's what I want to talk to you about. Darryl... I need to know what Andy told you about me and my sisters. - About who we really are. - Just that you were involved in... ...some of our unsolved cases. And that you somehow helped stop the killers. That's it? Nothing else? He was my partner, Prue. I didn't need to know anything else. So, then, why did you cover for us when Andy died at the house? Because he asked me to. That's why I've been trying to get ahold of you. To give you a message from him. That morning after he saw you, Andy told me to tell you that if anything were to happen to him... ...that it wouldn't be your fault. He didn't want you to blame yourself. Too late. You really think that's the window? You said yourself, the triquetra's the key, our connection. And besides, we keep hearing Grams say "the power of three." This is what that stands for. Either that or I just screwed up this wall for no reason. Well even if it is the window, if Prue doesn't show up... She'll show. Better late than never, right? Look, I know that I haven't exactly been myself lately. And I know that I'm going through something. And that I have some things to work through. But I don't want to let you down because of it. Right now it's not about me, it's about us. Attagirl, Prue. I knew you'd come around. - Excuse me? - Well, I did deep down. Are you sure you're up for this? I'm sure. Okay, so when the window opens, Prue, you'll knock Abraxas away from the book so Piper and I can reach in and grab it. Then, while you're holding him back... You'll find a spell to vanquish him, I got it. - Okay. - Okay. We have to create a circle. Three, two, one. Hold on. Now, Prue, now! First the book, then you. - What's the matter with you? - Prue, use your power. Prue. - Prue, what happened up there? - Nothing. Yeah, "nothing" is exactly the problem. I never said that I had the power to go against him. You did, remember? - No, the Book of Shadows did. - Well, maybe it was wrong. Maybe Abraxas is just too strong. Maybe. But that doesn't explain why you hesitated. - I didn't hesitate. - The hell you didn't, Prue. - I saw you. - We both saw you. So, what are you saying? This is my fault, is that it? - Because I can't defeat Abraxas? - No, Prue, you can. You just won't. Okay, something is holding you back. Something big time. And instead of facing it, you are running from it. - Phoebe... - But you can't keep running, Prue. Because you have got to figure out what your problem is, otherwise we're all dead. Yeah, that's right, Phoebe. It's my responsibility, isn't it? The oldest sister, always supposed to be able to figure things out. Well, if that's the case, then how come I couldn't save Andy? If I'm supposed to be so powerful, how come I couldn't save him? I mean, my God, don't you understand? Andy died because of me. It doesn't matter what he said, it was my fault. How can it be good to be witches if all it does is get the people we love killed? Sweetie. Prue, it's not your fault. You tried to keep Andy from coming here that night, remember? You tried to warn him, but he came anyway. He came because he wanted to. And there was nothing that you could have done to stop him, Prue. He chose to walk through that door not because of who you are, honey, - but because of who he was. - Protector of the innocent, just like us. I just don't know if I believe in it anymore. Honey, we've done a lot of good as witches too. You know that. You know, but that doesn't mean that bad things still aren't gonna happen. But just because we can't help that, that doesn't mean that it's our fault. Or yours. Come here. The power of three. - Okay, did you guys hear that? - Grams. The power of three. How is that possible? I don't know, but it's gotta be a good thing if we're all hearing it, right? - Maybe it means we're connected. - To be as one. Maybe that's what the book meant by the power of one. - The three of us working as one. - That's what the triquetra represents. Almost sunrise. Do you think you're ready to try the window again? Yeah. Yeah, but... Abraxas will be ready for us here. We have to take him by surprise, go where we're the most powerful, where we're the most connected. Hear now the words of the witches The secrets we hid in the night The oldest of gods are invoked here The great work of magic is sought In this night and in this hour We call upon the ancient power - Hear now the words of the witches - The secrets we hid in the night The oldest of gods are invoked here The great work of magic is sought - Prue, Piper. - Keep chanting. Hear now the words of the witches The secrets we hid in the night What are you doing? How'd you bring me here? - The oldest of gods are invoked - I will destroy you. Where the great work of magic is sought In this night and in the hour We call upon the ancient power In this night and in this hour We call upon the ancient power In this night and in this hour We call upon the ancient power And we didn't even have to get naked. That's more like it. I'll feel better when we erase that window. I don't want more demons coming through. They can't, it's our window, not theirs. Still, better safe than sorry. Especially if we can expect any more demons like Abraxas coming. Well, apparently we can. "Rite of passage. Fight it with the power of one or else... ...a more powerful evil that awaits will destroy you." Wow, I'm glad I didn't finish reading that yesterday. I'd have changed my mind about not wanting to give up our powers. No, you wouldn't have. You like being a witch too much, Phoebe. And you helped remind me that I like being one too. Hey, me three. Too bad it doesn't pay the bills though. Did you get it? Get what? What's this? Sixty thousand dollars? - Where did you get this? - Home-equity loan. We took a second out on the house to help buy your club. - Actually, our club, technically. - Right. As long as you don't mind being partners with your sisters. Thank you. The power of three. Grams? Hello, my darlings. Oh, it's nice to see you. Or rather, it's nice being seen by you. - But...? But how is this...? - Possible? All things are possible, my dear, it's just simply a matter of your being able to do them. Wait, so you're the one that keeps turning the pages in the book? Just my way of looking after you. As best I can, anyway. Don't try to understand this. You're not ready yet. But the fact that you could hear me before, can see me now, means that someday you might be. Be good to each other. I love you.
