these tables over here, replace them with mounds of pillows so people can lay back, get comfortable. You look worried, baby girl. Treat, I know I gave you the authority to make some changes in the club. But I thought they would happen gradually. You know, I don't wanna shock the regulars. Well, I do. All right? Your place seems too safe. Now, do you trust me? Do you trust the number one club promoter in all of San Francisco? - Yes, of course. - Good. All right, guys. Rip it all out. Wait a minute. What's going on? That's our table. Who told them that they could rip out our table? - I did. - And who are you? Phoebe, this is Treat Taylor. He's the new manager at P3. - I'm sorry, the new what? - I just hired him on a trial basis. Well, isn't that interesting. I need to talk to you. You look worried, baby girl. Well, why didn't you tell me about this? It just happened yesterday, which is why I asked you to come down here today. We said we weren't gonna do this. - Do what? - Make any major changes in our lives. All the books caution against it after you've suffered a major loss. Do not sell the house, do not get married, do not quit your job. Okay, but like it or not, there's been a lot of changes lately. And this is hardly the biggest. Speak of the devil/whitelighter/witch. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - Hope I'm not interrupting. - No, no. We were just talking. Well, I have a quick question, but it can wait. Continue. I was just explaining to Phoebe that the changes I'm making in the club are not by choice. They are by necessity. Okay, P3 has been struggling a little lately. And we are now a single salary household. Well, we don't have to be. I can get a job. And if you could get a part-time, entry-level job that pays you about 200 grand a year, that would really make a difference. Otherwise, I'd rather you be free for "other work." - About that other work-- - But it's not fair. You shouldn't carry financial burden. I will worry about the source of our income if you worry about the source of all evil. Speaking of evil-- Besides, what kind of job would you get? Well, I am a college grad. I am sure I could find something. - I found something. - Okay, Paige, what is it? Okay, have you guys ever walked by a house and just got a really bad, creepy feeling from it? Okay, on my way to get coffee every morning, I walk by this house and I get this shiver. - A shiver? - Does that mean anything? It's a shiver. No, I've always dismissed it as a bad case of the creeps. But now that I'm a witch... I don't know, I think it might be something supernatural. Well, do you know anything about the house? Just that this cute guy named Finn lives there. We bumped into each other at the grocery store, flirted a little. Done the "Are these melons ripe?" thing. Okay. Well, that sounds like you have the hots, not the creeps. - No-- - Well, either way, I think it's a good idea that you stay away from this Finn guy. No, I don't get the shiver from him, just the house. I think I'm onto something. I really think that when you've been a witch for a few months, you'll know the difference between sensing evil and needing a jacket. - So you don't want to check it out? - Not anytime soon. - Phoebe, I'm not making this up. - Oh, I know you're not, sweetie. But you gotta admit, it's not a lot to go on. - I gotta run. I'll call you later? - Okay. Okay. Stay away from that Finn guy. - Jeez, Finn, you live here? - It needs some work. Okay, it needs a lot of work. But it's nicer inside. I'll show you. - I must be out of my mind. - Why? I don't know. Going home with a guy I just met. Come on. What are you afraid of? Keep meaning to get that fixed. It's kind of dark in here, Finn. A little old to be scared of the dark, aren't you? Maybe I should go check the circuit breaker. Wait, don't go. It's okay. Who's there? If I'm reading this correctly, you were 27 years old when you finished college. Yes, I just graduated last spring. That certainly took a while. Oh, I had to take a break after my freshman year. Personal reasons. - Would you care to elaborate? - Not really. You know, during the holidays, things get pretty hectic around here. We need people who can handle tense situations. Oh, believe me, I am uniquely qualified to handle any kind of pressure. I have battled more... ...customer complaints than-- Than you can possibly ever imagine. I see you also noted that you require a flexible work schedule. I'll put in the hours, I promise. It's just sometimes I may just have to leave unexpectedly. Would you care to elaborate? No, not really. I see. - It's not what you're thinking. - And you know what I'm thinking? I don't know what you're thinking. I just know that whatever you're thinking, it's not it. - So you're not gonna tell me? - No, it's just so silly. No. Hello? Is anybody home? Leo. Oh, God, are you okay? I knocked but nobody answered. - And the door was unlocked. - It usually is. Otherwise, demons come crashing through and costs a fortune to fix. If you're looking for Phoebe, she's not here. She's at a job interview. - Actually I was looking for you. - Me? Why? Well, seeing that you're a whitelighter and I'm part-whitelighter, I was hoping we could have a "whitelighter to part-whitelighter" chat. Sure. Of course, sit down. So you have the ability to locate your charges, right? Sometimes. And if you had a sixth sense for locating good, is it possible that I have one for locating evil? You think you sensed evil? I know it sounds silly, but there's this house that I walk by, and I get this really bad feeling from. Problem is, I've already discussed it with Piper and Phoebe, and they've dismissed it. So you want me to talk to them. I hate to put you in the middle. Oh, that's part of my job. I'll just talk to them when I sense their minds are in the right spot. Thank you. Damn it. Now would not be a good time. I am only gonna say this once. The real world better start showing me some respect, otherwise, I'm gonna stop saving it every week. - What happened? - I just had the worst job interview for a position that a monkey could fill, provided the monkey could explain why it needed flexible work hours. Why aren't you at work? I-- It's my lunch break. I just-- You're not still talking about the creepy house, are you? Did you find out any new information? I think it's worth checking out. Okay. Well, let's go. I mean, it's not like I have to be at work or anything. Yeah, but I do. Could we meet afterwards? Like 4? I'll give you the address, I just-- I need... ...pen and paper. I love being able to move stuff with my mind. I'll see you there later. - Leo, thanks. - Sure. You really think she's onto something? Well, the important thing is that she does, so I think we should support that. Okay. Well, then I'll go change into my work clothes and head over there. Do you want me to go with you? You don't even know what's there. Leo, please. This is what I do. Now, that's what I'm talking about. You're changing the name of the club? I mean, you know, that's the plan, you know. What's wrong with P3? Well, we polled people. Most of them thought it was a parking level. I mean, I don't even know what it stands for. It stands for Prue, Piper and Phoebe. We are P3. We were. Yeah, but check this out. See, the new image deserves a new name, you know. I mean, otherwise no one will know what it is. You know what I'm saying? If you're against it, I can take it all down, - change things, whatever you want. - No. No, it's just-- It's just another change. - So do what you want. - You cool? - Yeah. Yeah. - You cool? You cool? All right. Come on, Phoebe, show a little spine. Hello? Anybody home? No. Where are you? You can't have gone that far. Leo. Leo. I see you. Why, you little witch. We'll see how long you last. Oh, this sucks. I can't get used to this orbing thing. You will. You got it in you. I feel like my stomach's gonna come out of me. What's with the white gauze? It's worse than up there. It was Treat's idea. What are you guys doing here? - We orbed in. - Together? Yeah, well, we were worried about Phoebe. She was supposed to meet me at the creepy house, but she never showed. So I thought maybe she got hung up, so I went to your place. I thought we decided not to investigate the so-called creepy house. Well, I know you didn't think it was anything. But Leo... So you went behind my back and asked Leo. She didn't go behind your back, and I'm her whitelighter too. Right. Well, it's a smart thing to do as a witch, but an annoying thing to do as a sister. So, what happened to Phoebe? I don't know. I checked my radar but she dropped to the tiniest blip. And what would account for that? I don't know, but I don't like it. Well, then we should probably get over there. See, I told you something was going on in that house. Okay, let's hold the congratulations till we find Phoebe. Look out. - You all right? - Piper. Yeah, man. Doesn't matter. P3 doesn't exist anymore. Come out. Watch out. One's loose. Shut the door. Shut it. What are you gonna do with her when you find her? Don't ask questions. Same thing you did with the other one? I said... Don't ask questions. The other one. Still, that-- That gives me an idea. Do you want me to--? Help me. Door's still open. Shut it. Shut. There it is. See? Shiver. Well, Paige, you don't have to be a super-witch to know that that house is creepy. I saw a motorcycle in the driveway. Somebody's home. Okay, so I say we go up to the front door, you knock, and I will freeze. You don't always have control over your powers. You might be blowing up an innocent. Okay, so how about you orb in, check out the place - and tell us what we're up against. - I have an idea-- Well, the problem with that is, what if what we're dealing with is not supernatural? Then I've orbed into somebody's living room and we've risked exposure. - If I just-- - This is why I say go with the freeze. - I can get Finn out of the house. - How? Well, I know the guy. I'll just go in, lure him out, and you can go in and snoop around. No. We can't let you go off with a potential demon. It's too dangerous. Right, Leo? Actually, it sounds like our best bet. Are you siding with Paige now? Hey, there's no sides. And, yes. Look, I know I'm new to magic, but the only way to change that is to allow me to get some experience. I am just trying to protect you. That's nice, but your protecting me may be hurting Phoebe. Now, I got her into this, Iet me help get her out of it. Okay, fine. Go. But until we know who this Finn guy is and what he does, I do not want you alone with him. Take him to P3. Or, I mean, The Spot. Got it. - What is that for? - A lure. Do not go into that house. Did you hear me? I said, do not go in. It is like talking to a wall. She's got the Halliwell hearing. That's one good thing about being so small. I'm so light I can kind of fly. Can you talk? Okay. Just close your eyes. And don't tense up. No, no. You can collapse later. - I need you to run. Can you do that? - Yeah. We gotta go before Gammill sees us. Gotcha. I knew a witch could never resist saving an innocent. - Hello? - Now what? - Hello? - Another girl. Get her inside. Go. Get her. - Get her! - Maybe we should just let them all go. Since when did you develop a conscience? I never gave you one. Now, what are you standing around for? Go. Go. Fetch. Be quiet. - Hi. - Hi. Remember me? The girl with the melons? From the supermarket melons. Yeah, I remember. What brings you here? Let's just say I got tired of waiting for you to show up on my doorstep. - I'm sorry? - Look, if we're gonna go out, the first thing you need to know about me is that I don't play games. I see what I want, and l... ...go for it. Do you have a problem with that? Are you always this aggressive with guys? Just the ones I like. Why don't you come in. Is something wrong? Oh, just the old cliché: My mother told me never to go into stranger's houses. That thing. Come on. What are you afraid of? Don't do it. Do it. No, wait. On second thought, let's just go out. The lure worked. Barely. Now where were we? Piper! Piper, I'm--! You go that way. I'll go this way. In here! I'm in here! Oh, weird. Bizarre collection. I wouldn't touch. We should look for Phoebe. I'll check upstairs. Piper! Piper. There's nothing upstairs. I mean nothing. Anything down here? No. Nothing but a bunch of clay. I think we should get out of here. Check the Book of Shadows. I-- I want to know what we're dealing with. Well, whatever it is, it better not require the power of three to vanquish it. Well, well. The power of three. So you're not just a witch but a Charmed One. Nothing will make me happier than to collect you all. When your clay hardens, I'll fire up the kiln. And once you're in the kiln, there'll be nothing left to save. Don't worry. I'll be back once I complete my collection. Okay, good. Now that he's gone, I can focus on getting us out of here. Although, I do have to tell you, I'm not having the best day of my life. It began with an interview where a woman made me feel this big. And now I actually am this big. And next up is being baked. Well, that's just my roundabout way of saying, "Don't panic." I'm gonna get us out of here. I'm... ...going... ...to turn... ...this day around. Found him. "Gammill, a.k.a. 'The Collector' is known for his passion of collecting one-of-a-kind figurines." Wonder what he gets out of that. Well, speaking for my great-aunt, Sylvia, who collects Hummels, when they have a hard time dealing with real people, figurines can be their best friends. Yeah, but being socially awkward doesn't land you - in the Book of Shadows. - So, what does? Well, apparently he went up against a witch some time in the '70s. A spell was cast to make him as hideous on the outside as he was on the inside. Like this, I suppose. Does it say what he did to deserve that? No, it doesn't make any sense either. I mean, we saw this guy, and he still looks the same. So, what does that mean? That Gammill found a way to break the curse and changed his name to Finn? I don't know, but I'm guessing whoever the guy Paige is with does. Then we need to find Paige and hope that she's not in trouble so we can find Phoebe and hope that she's not in trouble. Well, I wouldn't worry about Paige. I mean, she's in a public place. Nobody's gonna hurt her at The Spot. I wasn't expecting company, so just give me a sec to clean the place up. I really like your place. Really? It's a shoebox compared to yours. I'm really glad I didn't bring you in. You know, this is the first time a girl has ever invited me back to her place. Well, I just thought the club was kind of noisy, and we could hang out here. First, actually, I have a question. About what? About your house. I don't really wanna talk about that. If something bad is going on there, I need for you to tell me about it. Please, my sister could be in trouble. I don't know much. It's only recently that I've started asking questions myself. - Asking who? - Gammill. - What's his deal? - I'm not sure. Well, how do you know him? He made me. Made you what? Is that like a Mafia thing? No. Look, give me your hand. Put it here. Do you feel that? I'm not like you. Oh, my God. I just got-- I just got the creepy shivers myself. Now I'm glad you changed the name. Look at the waitresses. Oh, no, don't look. They're practically removing their spots. Can you do that in public? Listen to me. Just go look for Paige, okay? Go. Hold it. You can't go in there. - Excuse me? - It's a VlP area. You're assuming because I'm not tall, tattooed or big-breasted that I'm not important? That's a bad assumption, see, because I own this club, - which makes me a VVVlP. - Piper, Piper. - What's up, girl? - Hi. We got a fly crowd. I told you all it needed was a little danger. Yeah, that's exactly what this place lacked. Listen, have you seen my sister, Paige? Yeah, she was here but she left. - She said it was too noisy. - She said what? It was too noisy. Excuse me. Hi, having fun? Let's go. Paige took Finn to her loft. Let's go. - Paige? - What are you doing here? This is ridiculous. It's like dealing with a teenager. - I'm just examining him. - Okay, first of all, you should not have left the club. - Piper. - Second of all, you should not be playing doctor with the demon boy. - Piper. - Third of all-- Piper, he has no bellybutton. I can explain. First of all, we left your club because it sucks now. Okay? Anytime you try to be that hip, it ain't hip. And second of all, Finn has no bellybutton because he wasn't born. I was created out of clay. In Gammill's own image. He must be a golem. I don't know the technical term but I do know that he needs protection from the demon that made him. Okay, hold up. Where is Gammill now? At the house, I think. We were just there. We didn't see him. It's because he has his own secret hiding place. Could he be hiding our sister Phoebe there? No, he probably shrunk her. I'm sorry, he probably what? Well, that's what he does. He takes his wand and he shrinks the women for his collection. Oh, God. The figurines. That's why they're each one of a kind. We have to get back. We have to find Phoebe. Careful. If Gammill is at the house waiting for you, he'll shrink you all. I don't know why he didn't before. Does he still trust you? - Yeah. - Okay, then you come with us, you go in first and distract him. No, Piper, we can't use Finn as a minesweeper. And besides, isn't he an innocent? Actually, Paige, innocents tend to be real. Listen, we have to go get Phoebe. First, we should go by your house, check the Book of Shadows to see if there's a spell to undo shrinking. We'll bring Finn with us. We don't have time for that. Well, we can't go in there unprepared. Unprepared might be our best shot right now. Leo, what do you think? I think you need to stop turning to me, start trying to figure out a way to listen to each other. Piper, you don't listen to Paige's ideas. And, Paige, you don't listen to Piper's advice. I think you guys need to figure out a way how to work as partners. We're partners. Equal partners. Well, listen, can we do that tomorrow? Right now, we actually need your help. All right, well, I think the best way that I can help you is by this. - Leo. Great. - Great. What now? Well, I'm just gonna have to convince you that I'm right. Well, we don't have all day. Why don't we just flip a coin? Phoebe's life is at stake. All the more reason to make a decision quickly. Fine. Flip. - Call it. - Heads. Tails. I win, fair and square. It's okay, you'll be safe here. Can I get a glass of water? My skin feels a little dry. Yeah, sure. The kitchen's just down there to the left. Time to fire up the kiln. You're next. At least we came for you. Phoebe, Paige and I are here now. We have the power of three. Can you say a spell? Okay. We'll figure this out. Paige, let's go over our options. Options? We have two. We're screwed or we're more screwed. We don't need negativity. We need solutions. Well, I'm sorry, I've never been shrunk and covered in clay before. Hey. You wanted to be partners, so work with me here. Okay? Or you're right, we are screwed. Can't you blast your way out of it? I tried. I can't move my hands. I could call for something. But what would help? What's the point of having powers if you can't use them? What about orbing? - Will Leo hear us? - No. You can orb. - Only in the same place. - Well, that might work. The clay is still wet enough, it might collapse if you leave for a second. Yeah, only one problem. I've never been able to orb at will before. Well, that doesn't mean that you can't. - Just concentrate and relax. - Relax? - Are you kidding? - Paige, just close your eyes, take a deep breath, feel the magic rising from a place of strength. Feel it building and building. Paige, you're our only hope. It worked. How cool was that? I know, I know. I'm coming. He's about to put Claudia into the kiln. Piper, freeze him. He's way too big for my tiny magic. - Do you think I can call for his wand? - I don't know. Try it. Just keep your voice down. If he hears us, we'll be cooked. Wand. - Wand. - Go for it. Wand. - We need a spark. - Got it. Can you freeze him now? Yep. What do you say we take him out Charmed-One style? Don't we need a spell? That's the good thing about being stuck in clay all day. I had time to think of one. Repeat after me. - Small of mind - Small of mind - Big of woe - Big of woe - The pain you caused - The pain you caused - You now will know - You now will know That's it? That's the spell you spent all day working on? Well, it worked, didn't it? Oh, my gosh. How did you do that? The power of three. The power of point three. What do you guys think of The Spot? Well, the club scored Dave Navarro. That's pretty impressive. I still can't get used to the white gauze. Well, you don't have to. I told Treat that I just-- I can't do it. Paige is right. It's trying way too hard to be hip, which means it's five minutes away from being five minutes ago. The Spot wants to thank Dave Navarro-- Okay. To the old. --but he'll be back. So please, stick around. What's the matter, honey? The last time I was here, I was here with Finn. How do you guys get over these things? You don't. But you learn with experience that you can't dwell on the losses. - You kind of have to-- - Harden your heart? Protect your heart. Unfortunately, it's a fact of our lives that sometimes the good comes with a little sadness. There was a lot of good too. There was a lot of good. And my skin looks fabulous. And now that I've been five inches tall, I will never complain about my height again. And nor will I doubt your instincts again. Thank you. Okay. Well, then there's just one more thing that we need to tie up. Okay. Leo, what are you looking for? Something very important. Broken glass? Broken glass that needs healing. Here it is. It's up to you.
