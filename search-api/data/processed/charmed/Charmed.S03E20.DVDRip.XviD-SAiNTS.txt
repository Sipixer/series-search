- Cole? No. It's just me. - Come on, let's go home. - No, I have to wait here for Cole. Phoebe, you can't just wait here, all right? He will know where to find you. Come on. I don't understand. He was supposed to go back under so that they wouldn't be suspicious of him. But it's been over a week. He probably just hasn't found a safe way out yet, that's all. But what if he can't? What if the Brotherhood found him out? Look, even if they did, he would put some sort of a spin on it. You know, get out of it. Hey, come on, you know Cole. He knows what he's doing. You don't make demon of the century without having a few tricks up your sleeve. I just hope he's okay, Prue. It seems our brother's suspicions were well founded. - Why, what do you see? - Sickness. The kind that only comes from being in the world of light too long. It's contaminated him. How is that possible, Raynor? A demon as great as Belthazor? It's not his demon half that's been infected. It's his human half. He's in love. - The witch. - Not just any witch. One of the Charmed Ones. But she's not only loved him, she's turned him against us, sent him here to destroy us. Well, then we must destroy him. You still have so much to learn, Tarkin. You don't just kill a demon like Belthazor. - But he betrayed us. - And in so doing, he's acquired the knowledge of how to kill the Charmed Ones, something no demon's been able to accomplish. That, with his power, makes him a very precious commodity for us, one worthy of saving. - But how can you save...? - How can we save him? Simple. We remove the only thing that's reawakened his human half, his only foothold to good: The witch's love for him. Okay. Ou est la Tour Eiffel? That is "Where is the Eiffel Tower?" In my dreams, if we don't get you a passport. Honey, we don't need a passport to honeymoon in Paris. With the blink of an orb, we can be sipping champagne at the Champs Élysées. Yes, as romantic as you make that sound, I would rather fly Air France than Air Leo, just like every other normal newlywed. Well, great, except that we're not. Well, a passport for you could change all that. If I could just find... Voila. Birth certificate. - Where did you get that? - From Dan's old file, the one that he put together when he was suspicious of you. You remember him, don't you? Let's see, perfect hair, cleft chin, tried to steal you away from me? Vaguely. Vaguely. This isn't gonna work. I was born in 1924. No, you weren't. Okay. Off-white background, black ink. Little trick I learned in high school. - You're forging my birth certificate? - No. Just going to change one little number, so 1924 becomes 1974. And just like that, you are 50 years younger. Wait a minute. That makes you 27. That's younger than me. Maybe I should change another number. - Piper, this is completely illegal. - Yeah? Well, so is marrying a dead guy, okay? Let's not get technical now. Morning. What's up? Oh, probably three to five years in jail if we're lucky. Never mind. - Were you up late working again? - No, I was up looking for Phoebe. Three guesses where she was. - The mausoleum? - Yeah. - It's become like her second home. - Still no word from Cole? No, and you know what? You would think that he could take three lousy seconds just to shimmer and let all of us know that he's okay. Maybe he can't. Maybe he's afraid he'll get caught. Maybe he already has. Just follow my lead. Raynor. Good to see you're still with us, Belthazor. - What happened? - I tried to kill you. Accidentally, of course. I didn't recognise you in your human form. My mistake. Not many are strong enough to survive an energy ball, Belthazor. You're lucky. Forgive me. How could I not? After all, you taught me everything I know. Well, not everything. How long was I out? Long enough for us to investigate reports that you'd crossed over to the other side. - Rumours, not reports. - Don't worry. We don't blame you for the failed hit last week, even if you were seduced by one of the witches that thwarted our plan. I've already explained to you that I was over her. Yeah, but you didn't explain that she was one of the Charmed Ones. It doesn't matter that you stray, Belthazor, as long as you come back. To that end, I have an assignment for you, something that only your powers can achieve. I need you to get me a magical amulet, one that's hanging from the neck of a witch. Problem? Just that it's a little bit risky, don't you think? Sending me after a witch with the Charmed Ones on my trail? Tarkin will provide backup. That way, if they show up, you can catch them by surprise. That should take care of all of our problems, now shouldn't it? Where do I get the amulet? This shouldn't take long. Think he'll actually get the amulet? Yes, but not before he tells his beloved witch what he's about to do. And that should plant the first seed of suspicion in her heart. Promise me when I turn around, you'll still be there. - I thought... - I know. I missed you so much. I missed you too. Hi. They've given me an assignment, one that if I turn down... What do you mean, an assignment? What kind of assignment? I can't tell you. They've asked me to steal an amulet from a witch. - A witch? - Don't worry, I won't hurt her. Oh, well, that's good news, Cole. You can't do this! You think I want to, damn it?! Phoebe, I just have to buy some time so I can figure a way out. In the meantime, I have to at least pretend I'm evil. Yeah, but don't you see? If you turn into Belthazor, then you will be evil. - What makes you think I'll have to? - Well, because an amulet protects. It takes someone of great strength to overcome that. - Why do you think they chose you? - To set me up, perhaps. - Raynor may be on to me. - Who's Raynor? He's the head of the Brotherhood, and my old mentor. He has the power to read thoughts. And if he's read mine... Prue and I will come with you and watch your back. No, no, no, you can't. That could be exactly what Raynor is expecting. He could be setting me up to get to you. I have to do this alone. Cole, I... Trust me, okay? I know what I'm doing. Just concentrate on finishing the potion. If it works, Belthazor will disappear, and Raynor won't be able to track me. Then... ...we can be together. Prue! Prue! - What's wrong? - Cole's in trouble. I need your help. - Okay, anything. - We need to scry for a witch. Fast. All right. Who are you? How did you get in here? Just do exactly as I say, and I won't hurt you. Just take off the amulet and put it down. - I've been sworn to protect it. - And I've been ordered to steal it. Don't fight me. I beg you. You can't take it from me. Maybe I can't. But I can. Tell no one about the amulet, not even your whitelighter. Whitelighter. Is that my occupation, or should I just put "guardian angel"? Hi, how you doing? What's the matter with you? We shouldn't be here, Piper. This is wrong. Wanting a normal life is not wrong, okay? In fact, it couldn't be any more right. For crying out loud, stop being so good all the time. Newlyweds. First fight. - Eyes front. - Piper. Leo, look, I love you, but I'm getting a migraine here, okay? Just... Look, we're not hurting anyone. We're not breaking any commandments, okay? We just changed a lousy two to a lousy seven. - Next person in line, please. - So let go before I blow! Okay, we're almost there. What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No! You cannot leave right now, okay? Pretend you're... Pretend you're out. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. Come on! - I gotta go. - Leo, you can't go right now, okay? We've been waiting in this line for two and a half freaking hours. Who are you? If you've come for the amulet, it's gone. And yet you're still here. Living proof that Belthazor has indeed gone soft. Belthazor? The demon who'll be blamed for your death. Anything? No. Do you think maybe we scried for the wrong witch? I don't think so. Scorch marks. Oh, my God, do you think she's dead? Unfortunately, I don't know what else to think. That doesn't make any sense. Cole said she wouldn't get hurt. Yeah, well, somebody sure fired an energy ball in here. Somebody like Cole, you mean? Phoebe, I am not saying that it was Cole, okay? All that I'm telling you is what I see, what we both see. For what it's worth, I don't think it was Cole. Thank you. All right. But if he didn't do it, who did? Well, Cole said that he thought he was being set up by his mentor. So maybe he is. Maybe they're trying to frame him. - Why? - I don't know. But if it's true, that means his cover's blown. - And we gotta get him out of there. - Yeah. Leo. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. The Elders called me because a powerful amulet has been stolen. - Yeah, we know. - You do? Yes, and the witch that had it has been killed. It was supposed to protect her. That's why they gave it to her. Only the most evil of demons could've had the power to take it. Why would a demon want that amulet so bad? Because it's one half of an ancient charm. Whoever connects the two amulets together more than doubles the protection power. With it, they become invincible. Well, that certainly explains why the Brotherhood wanted Cole to get it. - Cole? - Forget it. - Who's got the other half? - Another witch. The amulets were divided between two local covens for safekeeping, but the bearers have always been kept secret, guarded even from them. Well, obviously that's why the Brotherhood wants them both. Only to destroy them so good can never use them. The amulet won't protect anyone evil. All right, we need to find that other witch before they do. Will you go with Piper so I can work on Cole's potion? Yeah. Speaking of, where is Piper? She's at the manor recovering from a little problem we had at the passport office. - What problem? - Well, she sort of blew some of it up. - Nervous? - Impatient. Something you're not telling me, brother? Actually, I was about to ask you the same question, brother. Sorry to keep you waiting. I had business to attend to. The amulet? Must feel good to be back in the game. Was it a beautiful death? - What do you mean? - The witch. How did you kill her? I didn't. I'd never risk alerting the Charmed Ones just for the thrill of offing a low-level witch. Too bad. I would and did. Don't make me clean up after you again. You shouldn't have killed her, Raynor. You're right. You should have. You told me to get the amulet, you didn't say kill the witch. Some things go without saying. You want me to get the second amulet? No, I want Belthazor to. Let Tarkin. My strength isn't back yet. I barely fought through the magic to get the first one. You can do it. I know you. You're the great Belthazor. You can do anything you want. You seem to have forgotten that. Find the witch. But this time, show no mercy. You think he'll do it? We keep putting the bottle in front of him, sooner or later, he'll take a drink. - What if he doesn't? - Don't worry. I have insurance. All right, I'll start scrying. I don't think it'll work. The amulet wards off magic, all magic. That must be why we didn't find the first witch in time. We didn't get a read on her until after the amulet was stolen. Okay, but what happens if we don't find her before? Piper? - Okay, was it a demon? - No, it was watermelon! Honey, why did you vanquish watermelon? I didn't vanquish watermelon. I threw it up in the air, and I tried to freeze it, and it exploded. This is the little problem I was telling you about. Okay, Piper, slowly put your hands down, and no one will get hurt. Honey! Sweetie, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna figure it out. No, no, no, don't come near me. I don't want anybody to get hurt. Okay, put these on. Maybe this will help. Put these on and... Okay, now try the teapot. Try the teapot. Okay, okay. That wasn't that bad. It's... All right, just relax, okay? Just calm down. Because I think your emotions are making this worse. I'll check with the Elders, see if they know what happened. Hurry! Hey, and ask them how we're supposed to find the second witch. - I know where to find her. - Cole. I didn't kill her, Phoebe. - I swear. - It's okay. I know. We believe you. You don't look so good. Are you okay? I'm not sure. Come on. What about the potion? How close are you? We're just missing one ingredient, billings root, whatever that is. But as soon as I find it, then I can finish it. I don't have much time. I'm kind of hanging on by my fingertips as it is. Well, you have to hold on a little longer. You can do it, Cole. I know you. Raynor says he knows me too. Cole, look at me. Look at me. You have to keep fighting it. You have to keep fighting him. You cannot let him win. But me fighting is how he does win. Raynor's just waiting for me to slip so he can drag me back into the fold. I know that's what he's doing. He can't have you. I won't let him. Then save me, Phoebe. I've been ordered to kill the next witch. Now, you have to get there first and stop me. Otherwise, Raynor will... ...win. The birth and rebirth of all nature The passing of winter and spring We share in the life universal Rejoice in the magical ring I'll see you all next week. Blessed be. Blessed be. What are you doing here? - Just watching your back. - Yeah? Well, watching it's one thing. Stabbing it's another. What's the matter, don't you trust me? - I don't trust anyone. - You never did. That's part of what made you so great. No allegiances, no conscience, no hesitation. You know what Raynor wants. Just give it to him. You'll feel better after you kill the witch. Who's there? You can't hurt me. - Cole, don't! - Piper, freeze him! I might blow him up. It's okay. We're witches too. Piper! Okay, that was good. That... That was fine. Kill them. Phoebe! Leo! - He's our whitelighter. - And our brother-in-law. I don't know what is up with me. Every time I try to freeze, I flame. - Leo? - I'm fine. Really, it's no big deal. Phoebe, it's a huge deal. Cole tried to kill you. - He's the demon. - And her boyfriend. We have very complicated lives. I'm just thrilled to meet you. I mean, I've heard of the Charmed Ones, of course. I just... - I never dreamed I'd... - Nearly die with us? - Yes, well, welcome to our lives. - You saved me and the amulet. That's enough. May I? Well, the wound isn't deep. A salve would cleanse it and ease the pain. Would you allow me entrance to your herb cupboard? - Kitchen. She means kitchen. - Oh, right. - Sure. Follow me. - Hands down. Hands down! Come on. Sit down. Take it easy. I'm fine, Prue. Really. And Cole did not try to kill me. He knew that the amulet would protect me. He could've fired at you or Piper, but he didn't. With the other demon there, he made the only choice he could. - And you really believe that, right? - Yeah, I know it. I saw his eyes. They were filled with pain, not evil. Prue, we gotta get him out of there before it's too late. Right. Then we better figure out a way to finish that power-stripping potion, fast. Come on. Check her out. Whipping it up like it's Toll House cookies. Maybe after she fixes Phoebe, she could fix me. Piper, you don't need fixing. If it's taking the Elders this long to tell Leo what is wrong with me, then I definitely need fixing. This will feel a little warm. That is amazing. It doesn't hurt at all. Hey, how are you at making potions? - Well, what do you need? - We need to detox a demon. Yeah, and we need something called billings root. Well, you have that. It's on... ...the bottom shelf. - No, that's ginger. - Now that's what it's called. In the old covens, they called it billings root. Janna, you have healed me twice. Piper, do you think you could help Janna with the potion? Just not point at anything. Only one way to find out. Hey, where are you going? To get Cole back here. If I'm right about what I saw in his eyes, he'll go to the mausoleum. And what if you're wrong? Well, then he'll be back here with his buddy to get the amulet. I'm not wrong. Cole's not the enemy. He's the victim. And I'm gonna save him. How could you have failed? It was just one little witch. No, it wasn't. The Charmed Ones were there - just like I warned you they might be. - We could've taken them. We would've died. - The amulet protected them. - Which is exactly why I wanted it! What has happened to you, Belthazor? The witches' magic never stopped you before. You never would've given up. What's changed? You know what, let's just drop the pretences, okay? I'm tired of playing games. We both know what you're trying to do. - It's not gonna work. - No? You don't care about the amulet. You only care about turning me against Phoebe. How smart. And yet foolish enough to fall in love. Loving her is the best thing that's ever happened to me. You can destroy me, but you can't change that. After all that I've taught you and all that I've given you, you're willing to give it all up for a witch? I'm not gonna kill for you, Raynor. Not anymore. Not even for your father's soul? - Settle, brother. - How did you get that? The Source? Promised to free him if you fulfilled your end of the bargain. You kill the witch, come back and finish your obligations, and you and your father will both be free. All that separates us from getting him back are a few drops of innocent blood. And they're about to be spilled. Cole. Surprised to see me? I hoped, but why did you come after what I did? Because you need me. Besides, it's not like you haven't tried to kill me before. A little energy ball isn't gonna stop me. You know, I didn't have a choice. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - I know, I know, I know. It's okay. We just need to get you back to the house. Get that potion in you, and you will be safe. It's too late for that now. What do you mean? - We have to hurry. - Maybe I should shimmer us there. You can't use your demonic powers, it's too much temptation. We'll just drive. Come on. "Shake water vigorously for 200 heartbeats. Then add a pinch of dandelion and a dash of chickweed." - You're using bottled water? - For Cole, the purer the better. - I got it. - Okay. Time me. I got it. Leo should've been back by now. It must mean my powers are screwed forever. They're punishing me. You're a fulfilment of a great prophecy. Why punish you? Oh, forgery. Wanting to have a normal life. Getting pissed off. By next week, I'll be walking around like Carrie at the prom. I think that's enough shaking. - Leo, where the hell have you been? - Hi. Easy, remember: Breathe, okay? Hi. Leo, Janna, the innocent. Janna, Leo, the whitelighter. - Leo, why are my powers so wonky? - They're not. They're advancing. Turns out your powers work by slowing down molecules. And apparently, now you can speed them up as well. Okay, but why now? Couldn't they have picked a better time? Hey, okay, don't look a gift power in the mouth. That one kicks ass, and we may need it - sooner than you think. - Why? Because when the two amulets are joined together, only a spell can activate their power. This spell. - What does that mean? - It means that if the Brotherhood wants to actually use the amulets, they're gonna have to come here for the spell. But I was told that evil couldn't use the amulets. Maybe they've figured out a way. Hey. You look like hell. You have no idea. - Is the potion done? - It still has to cool and turn blood red. I'll get some ice. I'll help you so you don't melt it. Well, look on the bright side. You got a new power. You've been bitching about it long enough. Yeah, well, careful what you bitch for. Try again! Phoebe, help! Phoebe! Phoebe, help! Watch out! Oh, please, please, please. I did it! - I did it! - Very good. Of course, I meant to freeze him. Are you all right? I am, thanks to you. I don't think Prue is gonna be quite as grateful. Wake her up. I gotta get back to Cole. It's ready. Leave her out of this, Raynor. I serve with every breath, even my last. Love to take you up on that. But I think I'll save that pleasure for my brother. Cole! I've come to take you home. - I am home. - Cole! You will be when you kill the witch. Stop fighting it, Belthazor! You're a demon. Embrace it. Let evil make you strong again. Give in to it. Cole? Leo! The rage in you is building, but it's not me that you want to kill. It's her. Do it. Free yourself. No. Cole, open up the door and let me in! Is she really worth sacrificing your father's soul for? Cole. No, don't do it. Cole. Phoebe. What did you do to him? I saw what you did. It's not what it looks like. It wasn't... Janna is dead and Leo is unconscious. What else could it be? Raynor forced me. I had no choice. There's always a choice, Cole! The potion. - Before it's too late. - It's already too late. You killed an innocent woman. There is no turning back from that. I didn't wanna kill her. You gotta understand that. I can still be good. There's nothing good in you anymore. Maybe there never was. You have to read the spell to activate the amulets, right? I mean, Cole, maybe that was your plan all along, to get the Book. But evil can't use the amulets or the Book. He could have if we'd stripped his powers. Is that why you wanted the potion, Cole? So you could get to the spell and use the amulets against us? Oh, Phoebe. You gotta believe me. I think she's believed you one too many times. Stay out of this! This is between me... ...and her. There's nothing between us anymore. Phoebe. Don't let Raynor take this away from us. Don't let him win. Raynor didn't set you up. You set me up. What am I supposed to do? Please... ...save me. Save yourself. Sorry about knocking you out, nothing personal. Yeah, well, at least you didn't blow me up. Yeah, I was kind of relieved too. - Piper, the control will come. - Yeah, tell that to the ficus. - Well, you sure told it to Tarkin. - That was kind of cool. So see, we can celebrate. You know, I mean, you got a new power and you beat a demon with it. I wish I could've done more for Janna and Cole. I mean, vanquishing one bad guy and losing three good guys is not exactly a winning score. Okay, so we are still counting Cole as good, right? Yeah. I mean, I actually finally understand how he feels. Having something inside of you that you can't control which is capable of hurting the people you love even if you don't want it to. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean to stick you with the morning-after cleanup. How you doing? I'm not sure. Well, you have a lot to sort out. No, not really. I lost my soul mate to evil. End of story. - Pheebs, I think he really tried, but... - It wasn't enough. I wasn't enough. I thought we could do a blessing for our two fallen witches... ...and for Cole. For Leeza, a lost sister. May her spirit soar. For Janna, our lost friend. May we meet again. For Cole... ...a lost love. May you find peace. Piper, we're going to have... - Plenty of time to talk later. - No, it's okay, Leo. We could actually use some good news. And it seems like you have some. Well, I don't have news, but I do have a passport. You went back? Yeah, well, I was thinking, with everything that's happened, and your new power making life a little crazy... All right, crazier, I figured that the least I could do is make it somewhat normal. - Are you sure? - Anything that it takes to get you on a plane to Paris. You know what? I think we should wait on that. I wouldn't wanna, like, sneeze at 40,000 feet and have a whole bunch of people explode. That would be bad. I knew you'd come back. I've been waiting for you. My father's soul, where is it? Or course, now that you're evil, what can you do with it? - That's not your concern. - True. You were my only concern. - How'd you get me to do it, a spell? - Does it really matter? Part of you enjoyed it, didn't you? Killing the witch? Not as much as I'm gonna enjoy this. You killed Phoebe's love for me. Now I'm gonna watch you die. I can feel your heart. It's racing even as mine slows. You're enjoying this. I can feel it. This is what I hoped for. Your inner demonic nature
