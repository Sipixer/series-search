that you were open till 1. Normally, I am, but not on the eve of Friday the 13th. In fact, I kind of wanna be closed by midnight. All right, well, we won't be much longer, will we, Pheebs? Okay, okay. So input? - It's nice. Let's go. - It's nice? That's it? - Maybe I should look for another one. - Phoebe, the woman wants to close. I know, I know, but choosing the right good-luck charm is a very big decision. If they all bring good luck, what's the worst that can happen if you choose the wrong one? All right, you know, this is why I like shopping with Piper. Do you want me to put this on Piper's order? - No, I'll pay separately. - Cash or charge? Will you put it on a credit card for me? I will pay you back. You know, tomorrow I have a job interview... And the good-luck charm is going to help you get the job. - How much? - Twenty-five fifty, plus tax. Okay. Oh, but you get 10 percent off if you sign the mailing list. See? Good luck already. If you're interested, we're having a Wicca gathering for the Spring Equinox. What makes you think that we would be interested? Most witches are. We never said that we were witches. - You think she knows? - How could she? Can you please hurry? - Is there a problem? - I told you, I just... I wanted to be closed before midnight. Wow, you really take this Friday the 13th stuff seriously. Yeah, you should too. Especially this one. - And why is that? - Because once every 1,300 years, there's a universal convergence of negative energy on Friday the 13th. - And this is the year. - Of course it is. Did you hear that? The clock struck 13. It's starting already. Goodnight, Tanjella. Sorry, we're closed. I said, we're closed. Not to me, witch. Oh, my God. Amulets don't work with this demon. Your greatest fear is being buried alive in an earthquake. Yes. Oh, you can't run! You're frozen... ...in fear! Think about it. When has she ever said it to you? I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure she must have. Yeah, okay. Try to think of a time. Just one. Whenever I say it to her, she says something like, - "Oh, me too" or, "Same here." - You know, you're right. Yeah, the girl cannot say the words, "I love you." It's like some weird... - Morning. - Oh, good morning. - Oh, that outfit looks great on you. - Thank you for giving it to me. Wait, you gave her that outfit? Yeah, it was an early birthday present. - For the next three years. - Are you feeling okay? I am fine. In fact, I had a wonderful dream about Mom. Oh, how great. What about? Well, I was a little kid, like 4 or 5, and I was reaching up, holding her hand. And she was taking me someplace. I don't know where, but it felt so safe. - I wish I had dreams like that. - Mom would have to knock before she came into your dreams. What are you doing? You have to cover your mouth when you yawn, or you might let the devil in. Especially on Friday the 13th. Is that amulet one of the things that we picked up for you last night? Yes, and this and these. We're having a superstition-themed fundraiser at the restaurant today. I'm going to need all the help I can get. Don't you think that you're overdoing it just a little bit? With all the warlocks and demons we've seen, I don't think so. Piper, those things are real. Okay, superstitions are like old wives' tales invented to explain somebody's misfortune. Statistics show more bad things happen on Friday the 13th than any other day. I met Jeremy on Friday the 13th. - Really? - Yes, and he tried to kill me. Afterwards, I found out there's a superstition that any relationship started on Friday the 13th is doomed. More bad things happen on Friday the 13th because people put energy into believing bad things will happen. Pheebs? Actually, I prefer the upside of superstition: Good fortune. Which is what I hope this little honey brings me at my job interview with the real estate agency. Will you give me a lift? - I'm running late. - Sure. Okay, well, have a great day, Prue. - I love you. - Yeah, me too. I wonder if she knows she does that. - Oh, hey, Andy. - Hey. Prue in? Prue, there's a policeman here to see you. See you later, Andy. We're running late. - So this must be bad news. - Why would you say that? - It's a little early for a social call. - You're right. We've had three suspicious deaths since midnight. All single females, all under 30. One was a bookstore owner. Credit card company's records show you were her last customer. Oh, my God. You remember anything out of the ordinary? Suspicious characters hanging around? No, Phoebe and I were the only ones in there. In fact, she was locking up when we left. - Was the place in order? - Yeah. Why? Well, when we found her, her body was half buried in debris. The coroner said it wasn't her injuries that killed her. - It was a heart attack. - A heart attack? Yeah, her hair had turned shock white. Her face was contorted in terror, just like all the others. If I didn't know any better, I'd say they were literally scared to death. You visit occult bookstores at midnight often? No, of course not. Phoebe needed a good-luck charm for her job interview today. It was... It was very last-minute. These killings look like some weird, ritualistic thing. The victims all had ties to the occult. You might consider shopping somewhere else. Meaning? Just be careful. Friday the 13th. Friday the 13th. "The Demon of Fear appears once every 1,300 years on Friday the 13th. He feeds on the fears of witches for his survival." Mom's handwriting. Okay, we need a table for taking the tickets. Okay. Who's the guy? Lucas Devane. He's chairing the fundraiser for the children's hospital. Oh, right. I saw his picture in a magazine. Wasn't he named one of the Bay Area's most eligible bachelors? - Don't rub it in. - Hey, you're the one who's letting a silly superstition run your life. Is he still looking over here? Yeah. He's undressing you with his mind, and he's down to white cotton. I haven't worn white cotton since high school. Humour me. So sorry I had to rush you off the phone. What's with the Demon of Fear? Well, I found a page about him in the Book of Shadows</i> in Mom's handwriting. - Mom? Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. I checked it against the handwriting on the back of the spirit board. Wow, this is the first time we've found anything Mom's written in the Book.</i> Well, she must've known that this demon would appear in our lifetime, and she wanted to warn us against him. I don't like the sound of that. Well, if he can kill 13 unmarried witches before midnight, he'll be freed from the underworld to wreak his terror every single day. Unmarried. Like being single doesn't have enough problems. - So how can we stop him? - I don't know. But he does kill by turning a witch's greatest fear against her. - Meaning? - The Book doesn't say.</i> But Mom wrote that in the face of our greatest fear our powers are paralyzed. Wait a minute. We're on the most-wanted list, and we're defenceless? Didn't Mom say anything about how to get rid of him? - Just to release our fear. - How do we do that? Don't know. That's all she wrote. Look, I know that you're afraid of flying. It's not really a fear. I just prefer buses. Well, as long as you stay in a crowded restaurant, you'll be fine. And since Phoebe's afraid of being trapped in an elevator, I'll tell her to take the stairs. And you'll stay away from pools. Ever since Mom drowned, you've been terrified of the water. That's why you never took swimming lessons with us. We've always known that was the reason. It's okay. Yeah, well, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I gotta go. Call me when you get to Buckland's. I'm not going to Buckland's. Mom warned us, but there are others. We don't know any other witches. No, see, Tanjella gave me this flyer for a Wicca gathering. And there's a woman named Zoe listed as a contact. I'm hoping that she can help. So call Pheebs - and let her know what's up, okay? - Okay. Okay. - I love you. - Yep. We're a small firm, but we've built a very successful business. Oh, well, size doesn't matter to me. What does excite me though is the chance to work with a successful woman. I mean, if I wanna be a success, who better to learn from, right? Well, I like that. I've heard all I need to hear. When can you start? Are you serious? I got the job? I can spot talent when I see it. Can you start today? Yeah. Yes, of course. Hi, honey. Give me a second. Here are the keys. Louise is out of town. I've got... I'll be in Calistoga for the day, so all you have to do is answer the phones. Taking a romantic midweek break? Well, yeah, which reminds me... ...there is one special task I'll need you to handle from time to time. If my husband calls, I'll need you to cover for me. Oh, right. - Sure. - Our little secret? Oh, of course. Well, you have my pager number, so have fun. Okay. You too. I thought you might come. There's nothing for you here. Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, witch. You're all alone. That's all I need. You have no power over me. I have evolved to a place where I have released all mortal fears. My inner strength will destroy you. You didn't release your fear of fire. You only repressed it. No. Please. Save it for another lifetime. You're frozen in fear! Hello. Sorry I'm late. So, what do we have? The coroner says there are no burn marks on the body. She didn't die of smoke inhalation. Her heart gave out, just like the others. And I can't believe you're wearing the serial shoes again. - They're my good-luck charms. - They're embarrassing. This is the fifth woman with ties to the occult that's been found dead since midnight. Now, tell me it's not the work of some serial nutcase. I can't, but it still doesn't mean those shoes aren't embarrassing. Inspector, will you look at this? The doorman keeps a visitor sign-in log. Wanna guess who the last person was to see the victim? I'm gonna guess the killer. Prue. - What did you tell Andy? - I didn't talk to Andy. I didn't want him to know that I was anywhere near there, - so I called 911, and I left. - Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, it's just that I can't get her face out of my mind, you know. There was so much fear, and her hair was pure white. The terror that she must've felt, it's just... Okay, I'm scared enough, thank you. So now what? We avoid any place he could use to terrorize us. - And what about all the other witches? - I took Zoe's Day Runner. Some of the names in it have got to be witches. I'll start making phone calls. Quick, throw some over your shoulder. - Don't be ridiculous. - It's bad luck. You could be attacked by evil spirits. Piper, we have been attacked by plenty of evil spirits, and they had nothing to do with salt. And considering our powers, I can't believe that you wanna rely on this for our protection. My feeling is you can never be too rich or too safe. Oh, look, a ladybug. - Is that bad luck? - No, actually, Grams once told me that whatever direction it flies in you can find your ideal mate. We gotta try it. Ready? So does a positive superstition cancel out a negative one? - I don't know. - Wait, what's going on? That guy has been trying to talk to Piper all day, and she has been avoiding him because she... Oh, no. - You should've thrown the sa... - Piper, don't even say it. - The salt. Okay. - I'm going home to change. - Be careful. I love you. - Yeah. All right, so she can't say it. Maybe she's afraid it'll make her look too vulnerable. Ever since Mom died, you know, she has to be the strong one to take care of us and everything. It's probably just all part of that. - Maybe. Hey, I gotta get back to work. - How's the new job? Great, except my new boss wants me to lie to her husband about an affair - that she's been having. - How nice. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I'm just hoping it never comes up. Hey, good luck. - How's it going? - Oh, good. Listen, we've been working so well together on this fundraiser, I was wondering if you'd want to get dinner after it's over. I should probably... I should probably check my schedule. - You don't know if you're free tonight? - Well... Dinner would be great. Great. Okay, heads, I tell him the truth. Tails, I lie. Oh, that helped a lot. Oh, hold on, please. Prue. No one's in. Call back later. We're not in. You know what to do. Prue, it's Phoebe. Pick up. Prue, are you there? Pick up. Hello?</i> Prue, I just had a premonition. You could be in trouble. Are you there? Prue, are you there? Hello? Prue, pick up. Your greatest fear is drowning. Thank you for making it so easy. That's right. Feed me your fear. No! Help! Your powers are frozen by your fear. I wish I could think of a logical reason to explain why Prue's involved in this. You mean, this time or every other time? Look out. Prue? Prue? Prue? You okay? I don't know. I'll wait for you downstairs. So, what were you screaming about? - I told you, I had soap in my eyes. - You had soap in your eyes? - That's why you were screaming? - Yes. What were you doing at that woman's apartment? Well, I was... Zoe was a collector of occult items, and she wanted to know if the auction house was interested in selling them for her. When you got there, was she alive or already dead? Dead. So you called 911? Why didn't you leave your name? - Why'd you just duck out? - Because I wanted to avoid this. I knew that you would suspect me of being involved, and I'm not. Don't you think it's a little coincidental, you being one step ahead - of death twice in one day. - What exactly are you implying? - In my shoes, what would you think? - First of all, - nobody should be in those shoes. - Told you. But if I were, I would never think that you had anything to do with these deaths. Prue, five women your age have been scared to death since midnight. Now, we show up, we hear you screaming, break in, find you terrified in the shower... I told you, I had soap in my eyes. That wasn't pain on your face, that was fear. Prue! - Hi. - Hi. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. - So are we done? - Yeah, we're done. You would not believe what happened to me. Yes, I would. I saw it. Prue... ...he came really close, didn't he? You've got some white in your hair. There's gotta be something in the Book about releasing fears.</i> Maybe it's just not obvious. Phoebe, do you smell that? - What? - It's like sandalwood. No, I don't smell anything. Mom used to wear a fragrance like that. I was too young to remember. Wait, I thought you said there was nothing in here about releasing your fear. "To let go of your fear, trust in the greatest of all powers." That wasn't there this morning. Well, you know, maybe because of all the stress you've been under... No, it wasn't there. It's in Mom's handwriting. I would've remembered. Okay. What do you think the greatest of all powers is? - Do you think it's the power of three? - I don't know. - What is it? - It's like I can feel her presence. Okay, maybe you should get dressed and go to Buckland's. No, I don't really think that I'm up for that. Look, Prue, you said he disappeared once Andy got there. So maybe he only attacks when you're alone, - when your fear is greatest. - Yeah, you're right. Of course I am. And whatever you do, stay away from water. Any water. - Don't even drink it. - Don't worry. - I love you. - Me too. Hey, why do you do that? - What? - You never say, "I love you" to me. - I just did. - No, you just said, "Me too." You never say it to Piper either. Have you ever said, "I love you" to anybody? Yeah, I said it to Mom. It was the last thing I said to her before she died. Do me a favour? Walk behind me so you don't cross my path. - Okay. - Oh, wait. You dropped your tail. - Are you okay? - Me? Yeah, you seem kind of, I don't know, tense. Well, it just seems ever since I agreed to have dinner with Lucas I've had a run of bad luck. I broke a nail, the shipment of clams is late, I had to fire a hostess, and I just ripped my skirt. Well, it is Friday the 13th. Doug, order up. Here you go. - Yeah, just hand it here. - Here you go. It's ready. Sage so fair, from far and wide Take my troubles And brush them aside</i> Hey! Is there a fire? Where's the smoke coming from? - Is there a fire? - I don't know. - Is it malfunctioning? - Just not my day. Hi. May I help you? Hi, I was looking for Susan. Oh, she's not here, but I can tell her you came by. What's your name? Richard Warner. You're Susan's husband. Unless she's got one that I don't know about. No. No. She doesn't have another husband. I thought I'd surprise her and take her to dinner. You know where she is? Yes. She went out. Okay, well, I think we established that. Do you know where? Well, she... It's actually interesting. She just... I can't do this. I don't understand. I'm sorry, Mr Warner, but I can't be the assistant your wife wants without compromising my beliefs, and I just won't do that. - Wait a minute. Slow down. - Don't worry about the office. I will lock up. Susan... Thank you. For what? For not lying to me about Susan's affair. - You knew? - I've tried to deny it for some time now, but I guess... ...there comes a time when you have to face the truth. I'm so sorry. Don't be. And listen, don't quit on my behalf. I'm not. - SWA Property. - Hello, may I speak to Susan?</i> No, she's not in right now. Can I take a message? This is Mrs Joffee. I'm outside a house Susan's supposed to show me,</i> and she's not here. Well, I'm sorry, but she must've forgotten. She's out for the rest of the day. Can anybody help me? I flew in from L.A. just to see this house.</i> I'm under a terrible deadline to move from my other house.</i> No one's here. But, you know, since you flew in and all, I guess I can show you the property. What's the address? Mrs Joffee? Hello. Mrs Joffee? It's SWA Properties. Hello, dear. Thanks so much for coming out. - Let go, or I'll scream. - Go ahead, I could use the fix. I know how you kill, but there are no elevators around here. Elevators? That's what you think your greatest fear is? You mortals need to look deeper. Down where the real truth lies. Your greatest fear is losing a sister, and I get two for one. He's only a threat till midnight, okay? All right, well, take care and don't look in any closets till then. All right, look, I gotta go. Somebody's calling me. Bye. - Hello? - Prue, it's Phoebe. I got stuck at a house I was showing. Can you come get me? - Yeah, sure. Where are you? - I'm at 3112 Napa Street. All right. I'm on my way. I can't remember when I've enjoyed a dinner more. I'm so glad you suggested this. You know, I almost didn't. - Really? - Well, I'm pretty sensitive to people's feelings, and I got the sense this morning that you were totally turned off to me. How odd. So, what's it like being one of the city's most eligible bachelors? Oh, that magazine article was so lame. I'm really a very simple guy. I value home and hearth. I'd like to settle down, have kids. I've got two nieces I'm crazy about. I even carry pictures of them. You sound too good to be true. You are too good to be true. Lint. You had a little lint. Oh, thanks. So your instinct about me this morning was right. I was sort of sending out negative vibes. Why? Well, there's this superstition that any relationship started on Friday the 13th is doomed. So I was determined to avoid you. But then there's another superstition about finding your ideal mate... Wait a minute. You were gonna reject me because of a superstition, but then decided I was worth going out with only because of another superstition? Yeah. Well, doesn't say much for me then, does it? Oh, no, it's not... Piper, I'm sure you're very nice, but someone who lets things like superstitions or omens determine their lives... Well, I just had an experience like that with my last girlfriend, and it was a disaster. I'm looking for someone who's just not into that stuff. I'm sorry. - Phoebe? - I'm in the backyard. You won't believe the view from here. Pheebs, where are you? Phoebe? Isn't that a great view? Bring your suit? That's right. Feed me your fear. Prue. Prue. You must face your fears, Prue. You must trust in the greatest of all powers: Love.</i> Mom? Save yourself. Save your sister. Don't be afraid. It's over. - Your fear. - I'm not afraid anymore. No! Oh, my God. I was so scared. I know. I'm just glad you're safe. I don't know what would happen if I ever lost you. I love you. I love you. Hey, what are you doing? Kicking myself. I just lost probably the greatest catch in San Francisco. What happened? He doesn't like women who rely on superstitions to make decisions. And I'm not so sure he's wrong. So Prue vanquished the Demon of Fear. Well, at least put him back in the bottle for another 1,300 years. Wait, whoa, what? What happened? Well, he pushed her into a pool, and then... And Mom helped me out. Mom? Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I saw her. It was just like my dream. She was this incredible vision, so peaceful, and she took my hand and brought me to the surface. It doesn't sound crazy. - I wish I could've seen her. - Me too. I'm just glad you're all right. I love you. - What did you just say? - I love you. That's the first time you've ever said that to me. Yeah, I know. I wish I would've said it a long time ago. Ever since Mom died, I've been afraid to say it. I didn't wanna lose anybody else. Well, we're not going anywhere. Okay. I'm exhausted. I'll see you two in the morning. What happened to her in that pool? I don't know, but whatever it was, it must've been incredible.
