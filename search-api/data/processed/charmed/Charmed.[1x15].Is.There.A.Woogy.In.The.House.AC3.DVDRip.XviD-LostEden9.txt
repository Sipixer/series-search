- Radio said 4.5. - There you go, Grams. - Earthquakes give me the jeebies. - Would that be the Phoebe-jeebies? Oh, you know, the comedy stylings of Prue Halliwell. The only Halliwell that actually likes earthquakes. I don't like them, but I don't go running through the house naked, screaming, "Run for you life," either. Okay, that is such an exaggeration. I was wearing slippers. Okay. Okay. Okay. Does anybody smell that? Yeah. I caught a whiff of it first thing this morning. - I think it's coming from the basement. - Gas leak? I don't know. I called someone to come and check. They should be here any... Now. I'll get it. - We're never gonna pull this off. - Everything's gonna be fine. Yeah, until the house blows up. Look, this Buckland's VIP specifically requested for the dinner party to be here. Now, Claire may have prodded me into agreeing. - But the point is, I did agree and... - Nothing has changed. Piper's gonna cook a feast. I will serve with grace. And Claire will kiss your ass. - Tronomical talents. Morning, ladies. Wow, that's the smell. Doesn't really smell like gas. Yeah. But if it is, we can't light the stove. No stove. No dinner. Relax. I can have it cooked at the restaurant and brought here. Well, let me check it out, see what's up. Great. Thanks. The basement is thataway. Okay. Thanks. Look, Phoebe. He's going into the basement. Alone. Don't even start. What if, dare I say it, the bogeyman gets him? I believe Phoebe pronounced it "Woogyman." Or was that just the buckteeth? Okay, I was 5 years old, you guys. Oh, so, what, now you're over it? Which is, I guess, why you haven't been down there in what, 18 years? Okay. You guys were not there. - It was real. It was this... - A story. Grams told you she got rid of the Woogyman in the basement so you could sleep better. What the...? You have freed me. And now you'll help take back the house. Who is Chanda Lier? Oh, that's me. I ordered some CDs. Using a fake name to score some free CDs? Isn't that a little dishonest? Phoebe's dark side rearing its ugly head? I do not have a dark side, thank you very much. Just because I protect the innocent, doesn't mean I have to be innocent all of the time. Oh, I don't know. Still believing in the Woogyman is pretty innocent. And it's very cute too. You didn't think it was so cute when we were all sharing a room and she kept you up all night. It was scary and it was real. So, what's the verdict? Bad. Bad as in destroying my entire dinner party? Or bad as in you can fix it quickly, it'll just cost more than my entire education? By tonight, there will be no more problems. Okay. I'm off. I gotta go too. I'm going to the wine store. - Here, for you. - Thanks. Which one do you want? I'll just be upstairs if you need me. Phoebe. A little down on the left. Thanks. So was this your first quake? And hopefully my last. I prefer my ceilings above me. All right. This is the final guest list for tonight. All important clients to me, to Buckland's, and therefore to you. And at the top of the list... Professor Whittlesey. Didn't she just buy the Calder? Well, her family did, and they can afford to buy much, much more. And for whatever reason, she's fascinated with your house, so your job is to keep her happy. Excuse me. Claire, I will be bringing a guest, if that's all right. Of course. Prue, tonight's going to be five plus one. - It's your home, then. - Yeah. Oh, Prue Halliwell, Professor Whittlesey. Beth. I can't tell you how excited I am to be spending the evening in a house with such history. I understand you know a lot about the Halliwell history? I'm better versed on the house's structure than its inhabitants. The professor's tenured at Berkeley. Architectural history. As a matter of fact, I use your house as an example in one of my lectures. Really? Do you mention the leaky roof and the limited hot water? Oh, the original house that stood on that spot was a masterpiece. But it had to be rebuilt after the earthquake of 1906 when it was completely destroyed. That's the time my great-grandparents moved in. Metaphysicists believe the land to be what they call a spiritual nexus. But it's still standing after this morning's rumble. So okay, gotta go. Gotta go. See you at 7. Plus one. - Hello? - Hey. How's my favourite sister?</i> You want something. I know you want something. Look, my boss just told me it's plus one. I am so sorry.</i> Plus one? But I've already bought the... Oh, whatever. You owe me. Excuse me. That's... Calera Jensen, '93. Last bottle. - Mine. Look, why don't you try this. It's got a robust flavour. Good nose. Great vintage. It's probably better than the Calera. I'm impressed. But why do you want it so bad? Because it's got a great body. Look, I'm making coq au vin, and I need that bottle more than you do. Look, I'm sorry, but I've already been to three wine stores, lunch break is long over, and I was told that this was the bottle to get. - Told? - The woman who recommended this grew up on a vineyard, and she does know how to choose wine. Yeah. Well, I grew up in a house with two sisters, and I know how to do this: I can't... I can't use my powers for personal gain. But it's not really personal gain exactly. Damn! You can keep the wine. Help me! - Help me! - Where are you? Please. Help me. - What's wrong? - I fell. I think I might have sprained something. My ankle. I could really use a hand down here. Right. A hand. Okay. I'm okay. I'm coming! Grams? Phoebe! Go on back to bed, honey. Go on. The Woogyman. You know, I think I'm just gonna call somebody for some help. No, please. I need your help. Okay. Hello? Where are you? I thought you said that you were... Phoebe. No. Your nightmares are true. I exist. I'm a good witch. - You can't take me. - You'll fight me at first. But in the end, you'll do everything I ask. Don't worry. I can handle it all myself. It's me, the culinary pachyderm. Phoebe? Maybe we should call someone to check the electricity too. Kit? Hey! Pheebs? Oh, God! Oh, God, you scared me. Is everything okay with the house? - It will be. - Good. Could I get a ETA? Because I'm gonna have one very stressed out sister. Have you seen my sister? Phoebe! Phoebe! Phoebe. He just... It's okay. It's okay. I thought he was gonna kill me. I didn't even have a chance to freeze him. Where did you get the bat? I don't know. It just sort of appeared. What do you mean, it appeared? You opened the closet and found it? Or appeared like you thought bat and there it was? Yeah. Door number two. I can't explain it, but something weird happened to me down in the... What? Phoebe, spill. How did you make the bat materialise? Safety first. Witchcraft later. We gotta call 911. - This doesn't track. - What's that? I just got background on the gasman. He doesn't have a record, not even a parking ticket. He's a family man, church volunteer, Little League coach. When Good Coaches Go Bad. Next week on Fox.</i> - Andy, what's going on? - Everything's fine. An incident involving the gasman checking your house. He got a little rough with Piper. Prue. Hey. Piper, are you okay? Are you hurt? No. Yeah, I'm fine. He attacked me. And then Phoebe stopped him. Go on, show her. I told you, I can't do it now. Do what? Phoebe has a new power. She thinks of something, and, poof, it appears. I just did it once. And it saved my life. I would think that you would be thrilled. You've always wanted an active power. Whatever. Wait a second. Timeout. Our powers are supposed to progress, not grow at random. And if it did grow, I would think that it would be at least be premonition-esque. I smell Book of Shadows. Did you do something?</i> Okay, I just saved Piper's ass. Where were you? - Phoebe. - Prue's just pissy because this time she didn't get to play Wonder Woman. I'm not in the mood to soothe your ego. Well, tonight's gonna be fun. She'll be fine. And everything will be fine. Thanks for my new power. You must not fail me again. You must use your powers against your sisters. Please don't make me do this. I don't wanna hurt them. Phoebe, you are not strong enough to fight me. It is almost time, Phoebe. Use the powers. Flour. Hey, there is lava water spewing from the showerheads. Did you turn up the water heater again? No. No, I... All right. The earthquake must have messed up the wiring or something. Try cooking a feast when your own kitchen is attacking you. Okay, just relax. We still have an hour before... It's 7:00? How can that be? The clock on the microwave says... Something weird is going on. Is anyone gonna answer that? Phoebe? Wait. Am I seeing things, or did you just come from the basement? What about the Woogyman? That was just a story, remember? You should probably finish getting ready. Welcome to Halliwell manor. My name is Phoebe. I'll be your cruise director this evening. Everything is fine. This is fine. This is utter disaster. I am a good person. What did I do to deserve this? Prue told me to give this to the chef. You. Most people call me Josh. I... I work for Professor Whittlesey. You're the plus one. And I stole your wine. Truce? Calera Jensen. What a surprise. Last bottle. You have... ...flour on your... Right... Perfect. Are you planning on feeding the people in the living room? Of course. I've got... What have I got? - What's in there? - Duck medallions. But... No, no. That's supposed to be part of dinner. Okay. Now I guess it's an appetiser. Okay. Go. Go. Go. Mingle. Mingle. Mingle. The manor's been beautifully restored. Really quite magnificent. Prue. There you are. Anyone hungry? Well, what do we have here? Duck medallions. Sans medallions. That's my sister, the magician. Usually it's a dove or a rabbit. Lightly simmering. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sabotage. I am being sabotaged. What seems to be the problem? There is something terribly wrong with the house. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Call a plumber. This is a complete and total disaster. Somebody just kill me now and spare me the agony of cleanup. Ask and you shall receive. Everything all right in here? And people pay you to do this? Phoebe, could you please escort Mr Congeniality out of here? Please, now. And get Prue. Tell her it's an emergency. There's no other house in the city quite like yours. - Because of its architecture? - Because of its location. Right, you mentioned that. Something about some sort of a spiritual... Nexus. It's mythology, really. But it's believed that when a geographical point is equidistant to the five spiritual elements, it's a place of great power. Power failure. Look, I don't know what's going on, - but I apologise for any inconvenience. - Prue, Piper needs you in the kitchen. No, don't worry. I'll take very good care of your guest. You came to see the house. Would you like the grand tour? Okay, aren't you the same girl who said, and I quote, - "Everything will be fine"? - Yep. - And? - It's not. I don't know what it is, but it's like the house is possessed. No, no. It is Phoebe and her new powers. Look, I know she's been acting really weird lately, but she wouldn't... I would argue if I could think of another option. Prue? May I speak to you for a second? Yes. I'll be out in one second, Claire. What do we do? I don't know, but I can't cook this meal. Not in this kitchen. And it's too late to get it from Quake. Okay. Let's just end it now before it gets any worse. Be my wingman? Really, I don't need to see the basement. Are you kidding? It's the best part of the house. After you. Well, as hostess, it's sometimes helpful to be present at the party. Claire, I am so sorry, but I'm gonna have to cut this evening short. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. What? Do you realise what you're doing? Yes, and I think I'm doing it just in time. There is a table waiting for all of you at Quake. On the house. - There is? - There will be. - Where's Phoebe? - I think she's giving the professor a... Tour. She showed me the bedrooms, the solarium. I found the basement particularly intriguing. - Are you okay? - Fine. Okay. Dinner has been changed. We're having it somewhere else, okay? Oh, professor. I'm sorry you didn't get to spend more time in the house. My time was well-spent. I'm looking forward to hearing your explanation of tonight's events. - Need a ride? - I just have to tie up a few loose ends here. I'll try and make it. Try hard. Now what? Interrogation. Are you looking for me? Why are you doing this? Because he asked me to. Who asked you to? Okay. That is it. We need to... Prue. Prue, are you okay? Phoebe! What's wrong with you? Why won't you let us in? No, you can't. You shouldn't. You don't live here anymore. He does. Okay. We have been up all night. We've tried everything. If our powers can't get us into the house, what can? That helped. You know, yesterday I got shocked when I walked through the front door. Me too. Do you think that's when this all started? Define "this." Our house has turned against us and so has our sister. This is more than just Phoebe. She said that he told her to do this. So who is he, and what does he want with Phoebe? Maybe that's the problem. We've been focusing on Phoebe. Maybe that's not the point. - Then what is? - Location. Whatever has the house has her too. And it's not letting us in for a reason. And we can't get to The Book of Shadows to find out what it is.</i> - So we know nothing. - Yes, we do. There's someone who knows the house better than we do. Come on. Yes, I would like a pizza delivered to my home. Well, whenever you do open, then. I don't care what you put on the thing. Just make sure somebody delivers it. 1329 Prescott Street. I'll be waiting. Let's go. Please, ma'am. Hey! What happened? I don't know. Professor Whittlesey had just begun her seminar when she turned and suddenly started choking me. And if one of her students hadn't pulled her off... Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah. I just... I don't know why she snapped like that. Okay. Josh, do you know anything about what she said to Claire? It's something about a spiritual nexus. She brought that up? The professor doesn't usually go in for that sort of metaphysical mythology. You know Claire, once she gets her claws into something, she can't seem to forget about it. You know, I've met people like that. A spiritual nexus is a point of incredible energy. Equidistant from the five spiritual elements. That's right. A place or thing that could be swayed either way. - Either way? - Yeah. Either to be a source of undeniable good or undeniable evil. Ladies, I'm gonna follow her and make sure she's okay. Now, feel free to browse around in our office if you think it'll help. Okay, to find a way back in, we have to know what we're up against. The professor said that a true spiritual nexus sits equidistant from the five basal elements. So that's earth, fire, water, wood and metal. Okey-dokey. Equidistant. Here is the manor. All right. Let's see. The bay, water. Natural hot springs? Fire. What about wood? That park that Mom used to take us to, Kenwood. Named after the type of tree that grew there when it was still a forest. Okay. Three out of five. Earth. Twin Peaks. Highest point in the city. And last but not least, metal. - Tiffany's. - Cute. Natural metal. Okay. Fourth grade, field trip. We panned for gold. Where was that? Okay. Our house was built in the centre of a pentagram. Looks like it's not just on a spiritual nexus, but a Wiccan one as well. Which means it's a battleground for good and evil. And what happens once evil has the house? It spreads. We'd have to check The Book of Shadows to be sure,</i> but I'd bet that there's a reason why our family built the house there, to reclaim the spot for good. And now I'm thinking evil wants it back. Yeah, and it's taking Phoebe with it. Why does it feel like we live here? - Which one you want? - I'll take that one. - I could use a change of scenery. - See you back here. - Next to you. Hello, inspector. Phoebe. - Hey, I stopped by to... - Just in time. I think there might be a gas leak. And I'm home all alone. Do you think you could look it over? Sure. It's down in the basement. So he came out of his house, walked over here and started throwing things? No. Not out of his house. Out of the Halliwells'. Really? Hey, Morris, neighbourhood watch? Had a woman brought into the station house today. Wasn't feeling too well, spent last night at your house. - Professor Beth Whittlesey? - Is she okay? Not at the moment. She's under observation. Paul, what is the matter with you? - Nothing. - I'm occupied right now. Andy would like to ask you a few questions. He's inside. I told you to keep your trash cans off my driveway. Wait. If Andy is in the house and Paul was in the house, - there must be a way for us to get in. - We better hope so. Otherwise, there's no way to get to The Book of Shadows.</i> - Freeze him. - No, wait. What are you doing? - What was that? - The house is letting him out, right? This is the only second that its guard is down. - You're brilliant. - Thank you. Oh, my. She's frozen. - Good. - No, no, no. Remember? Our powers don't work on good witches? - Oh, that means she's... - We've lost her. Okay. Let's go get her back. Run. - I never liked living next door to him. - Don't do it again! Wanna give me hand here, partner? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Andy! What the hell was that? What? I have no idea. - Faster would be good. - There is nothing here. We don't even know what we're fighting. - Our sister. - No, it's more than that. All right. When in doubt, start at the beginning. What happened first? - Gasman attacked me. - Before that. The earthquake, which is why the gasman was here, to check the leak in the basement. All right, and before Professor Whittlesey freaked out, she took a tour of the house including the basement. Noises don't help. The gasman said that's where Phoebe was. And we know she's been down there. No. Piper it was just a story. Are you so sure? We've seen monsters and demons from the past and the future. How can you be so certain that Phoebe's childhood monster isn't real? The Woogyman in the basement? Phoebe swore she saw something down there. That's when Grams started telling us the story... Of how to destroy it. And there was an earthquake that night too, remember? Maybe that's how it gets out. We've been looking in the wrong place. How to vanquish the demon isn't in The Book of Shadows.</i> It's in Grams' story. So it wasn't a story. It was a spell? All right, the Woogyman is a real demon. So Phoebe was right. Now, how did it go? Something about a Woogyman, and Grams fought it. - That's all that you remember? - Well, don't you remember anything? I remember that it was sort of like a rhyme. Sounded like a children's song. Well, we'd better figure it out fast, or we're gonna have a whole lot of... Prue! Prue! - Phoebe? - Any fantasies about how you wanna die? Phoebe, listen to me. This isn't you. - Give the girl a prize. - Prue! Look, whatever is doing this hasn't completely beaten you. Otherwise, we would be dead by now. - Really? - Phoebe? - Phoebe, you were stronger than him. - I mean it! No, I wasn't. That's why he chose me. - But now I'm stronger than you. - Prue! Phoebe! Prue! Go! Piper, where are you going? It's just not Phoebe we're fighting. It's the house. Piper, don't! Oh, God. - Are you okay? - No, I'm not. Neither are you. We're locked in this house, and our sister is trying to kill us. All right, the answer must be in Grams' Woogyman story. - Which neither one of us remembers. - Yeah, but we have to keep trying. There has to be a way out of here. We've tried everything, Piper. Besides, the only way to help Phoebe is from inside. Help her kill us maybe. - Yeah, well, we have to keep trying. - Prue! Piper! Help me! Do you think...? Please? You gotta help me. I'm down in the basement. - Trap. - Yeah, well, what else can we do? We could not go to the basement. I'd vote for that. Grams must have thought that this evil might come back. And that's why she told us the story. How do we remember the words? I never believed in the Woogyman. No, but Phoebe did. She knows the story by heart. Something tells me she's not in the mood to share. All right. We know that the source of his power is in the basement. So if we can weaken him, then maybe we can weaken his hold on Phoebe. At least long enough for her to tell us the spell. How do we do that? We don't even know what it is or how to fight it. Help! Please, I need you. Okay. We have no choice, so we're gonna need a... Light. No. The light. Grams' story, remember? She said something about using it to guide you through the shadow. Or was it to the shadow? That doesn't make sense. Using a light to find a shadow. Shadows retreat from the light. And they thrive in the darkness. Kind of like this. Or in the basement. Maybe that's what we're fighting, Prue. A shadow. Okay. Let's fight it. Phoebe? Okay. There, see that? What took you so long? One evil at a time. Okay. Freeze it. It's not working. Can't you...? No, my powers aren't working on it either. Phoebe, you've got to listen to us. You're in no position to tell me what to do. Remember Grams' story? The one about the Woogyman? About the light? Come on, Phoebe. Try. I can't. Don't make me. Don't like the basement. It's no use. Your sister's evil now. Come on, Phoebe. You've got to fight it. You're good. - Grams? - Phoebe. Go on back to bed, honey. Go on. Phoebe, please. Remember the story. What did Grams say? Hurry, Phoebe, please. I am light I am one too strong to fight Return to dark Where shadows dwell</i> You cannot have this Halliwell Keep it going, Phoebe. Go away and leave my sight What are you doing? And take with you this endless night Phoebe, no! Anybody home? Office hours aren't until 5. Piper. What are you doing here? Oh, I just came by to see how you... Professor Whittlesey was doing. She seems better. Hasn't choked anybody lately. Good. So you'd say she's back to normal? Yeah. Although she's being censured for her behaviour. You know, has to sit before the university board, and for now, well, it looks like I'm covering her classes. Oh, that's too bad. I mean... - I don't mean you. I mean... - I know what you mean. Yeah. You know, by the way, I have something for you. Calera Jensen, '93. Battles have been waged over this wine. Not today. I'm too tired. That's actually very nice. Don't sound so surprised. You know, I am capable of a kind act or two. It's good to know. So Morris said that it was only a two-week suspension. Doesn't seem fair. It wasn't really Andy's fault. Well, what was he gonna do, plead shadowed? Anyway, everyone seems to be back to normal, but that doesn't erase their actions. Yeah, well, I wish it did. Get me off of Claire's bad side, as if she had a good one. I'm beginning to wonder if I have a good one. Well, I am. I mean, up until now, I didn't even think I had a dark side. I mean, not any more so than anyone else. Yeah, well, the important thing is that the good side won out. Yeah, but I must have been more susceptible than either one of you. Otherwise, he wouldn't have chosen me, right? Right. You were the only one that was born in the house. That makes you more connected to it. It's that spiritual nexus thing. That's exactly my point. I could go either way. Good or evil. It's kind of freaky. I do have to tell you I am gonna miss that new power, though. It was so fun. If Grams put away the shadow and it came back... It means he can come back again. Okay, it's time. Every witch before us has added to The Book of Shadows.</i>
