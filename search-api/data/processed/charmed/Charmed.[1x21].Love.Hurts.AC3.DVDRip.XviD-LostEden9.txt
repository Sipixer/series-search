I have been so scared. Look, you just have to stay strong a little longer and then you'll be safe. But he's out there, Leo. He's going to find me. I've seen what he can do, his powers. How did you do that? - Who are you people? - You just have to trust me, Daisy. But why me, Leo? I still don't understand. You have a very special future ahead of you. That's why I wanted you to come to San Francisco. I have powerful friends here who can help you. - Leo, what if Alec finds me first? - He won't be able to. - I've made you invisible to him. - Hello, Leo. Been looking all over for you. I figured you can only be here for one reason. Where are you, Daisy? I know you're close by. It's okay, Daisy, he can't see you. Don't say a word, just leave quickly. Don't listen to him, sweetie. Don't do it. - She's already gone, Alec. - I love her, Leo. Much like you love your little witch. What's her name? Piper. Darklighters aren't capable of love, Alec. This one is. I love Daisy, and you are keeping me from her. It was only a couple of days ago, all I had to do was think about her, then bang, I'd be there with her, right there. Then suddenly she vanishes from my radar. Cloaked by a whitelighter. By you. Well, if you know I cloaked her, then you also know that you won't find her as long as I live. Yes. Well, I have a solution for that. I can't believe you're wearing your bikini on the plane. Timesaver. We have all of 48 hours in Cabo. The minute we land, I'm on the beach getting all golden brown. I know, but you're making me look frumpy. It's like a sign of the apocalypse. I practically had to beg the guy in Accounting to lend us his condo. There are no warlocks in sight. Andy finally found out our big secret. - I'm going to get crazy. - It's about time. How long have I been after you to find some new male blood? - Preferably tan and buff. - With limited verbal skills. - And no strings attached. - No strings attached. Stella, we are getting our groove back. So speaking of which. Where's Piper? I think Piper's gonna be in a groove-free kind of mode for a while. - Oh, she's not seriously... - Taking a vacation from men, yep. Afraid of falling in love again, I think. So while we're partying all weekend, what is she gonna be doing? I don't know. The last I checked, she was in the attic searching for a suitcase to carry her books in. Books? What kind of books? The kind they make into Kevin Costner movies. Oh, no! We've got to stop the insanity. Maybe we should just let her be. I mean, we're not the ones who fell in love with a warlock, a ghost, a geographically undesirable handyman - and a very dorky grad student. - Maybe she's just in a slump. It happens. All right, it happens to Piper a lot, but celibacy is not the answer. A couple of dates not picking up the check, that's a slump. This is more like a sucking void. Prue, Phoebe. Leo? - Be careful. - I am being careful. I can't believe you knew. The fact that our handyman, the man I was dating was supernatural, just happen to slip your mind? There was no slipping, okay. I told you, but you didn't wanna believe me. - Piper, I wanted... - But you didn't. Okay, we gotta... We gotta get your legs up. Don't worry about me. There's someone... - We have to get the arrow out. - No, don't touch it. It's tipped with poison. How are we supposed to pull it out if we can't touch it? You came to the right girl. Here. You ready? Okay, I brought everything that I could find. I just didn't know what to use on a... What is he again? - A whitelighter. - Yeah, they're sort of like... You know how Peter Pan has Tinker Bell? They're sort of like that. Only minus the tutu and the wings. - He guides witches. - And future whitelighters. - That's why I came to you. - You should have told me. - Well... - I should have told you. Oh, did that hurt? Good. Look, there's a woman. Daisy. You have to protect her from the darklighter. - A darklighter, that's what shot you? - Yeah. They... They seduce innocent women. Their goal is to create evil through reproduction. - Great, generation 666. - Only he broke the rules. He fell in love with one of his victims. A human. And she loved him back. Until she found out who he really was, right? Piper, you have every right to be mad at me. Thanks for the permission. I'll get some more gauze. Please, you have to find Daisy before he does. Otherwise she won't be able to do the good that she's destined to, and she won't be able to become a whitelighter. - Okay, where is she? - I don't know. The last time I saw her, she was at a mini-mart in the Castro, headed for her rental car. If he finds her first, he'll never let her go. Ever. Any tips on how to vanquish a darklighter in case we run into him? No. Just... Just don't let him touch you. His power is in his hands. And when he chooses to, he has the touch of death. And we have the power of three. All right, call the airline, cancel our tickets. I'll call Andy, see if he can help me locate her. - And Piper should... - I'll talk to her. - Someone's gotta stay with Leo. - Perfect. - You enjoying this as much as I am? - What's that? Oh, you know, the silent treatment, the cold shoulder. I know. It's been a week since Internal Affairs has made a move. - What are they waiting for? - I'm not talking about IA. I'm talking about you and me. - I got no problems. - That makes one of us. IA is on our ass, and I still don't know why, but I'm pretty damn sure you do. You feel like sharing? Homicide, Trudeau. - Andy, hi. I... - Hey.</i> Franklin. How are things in Forensics? You can't talk. No, actually. Why don't you have it checked out by the FBI lab? Andy, I really need your help. It's important. Quake? Okay, I'll be there. Franklin's wife had a baby girl yesterday. He took a week off. He call you from the maternity ward? You don't wanna tell me what's going on, fine. Just don't lie to me, okay, partner? Andy, what's going on? Internal Affairs is looking into all my unsolved cases. All the ones that involve the supernatural. All the cases that involve me. Do you think that they followed you here? I wouldn't put it past them. Andy, if we... - If I put you in this situation... - I put me here, Prue. Yeah, but you had help. - Can they force you to tell them? - About you? I won't. But we have to be careful about being seen together. It has to look like we're still... ...friends. Andy, we are still friends. We always will be. You sure I'm not just someone who's keeping your secret, Prue? You know me better than that. I'm glad I told you. I am. So am I. Now when you need me, all you have to do is ask. Well, I am asking. I need to find someone. She's in danger, and I have to get to her before he does. He? You know what? I don't need to know. Specifics always get me into trouble. Where was the last place she was seen? Headed to her rental car outside a mini-mart. Well, we can get the security cameras from the mini-mart and surrounding businesses. See if we can get the car's license plates and see if it leads us to where she's staying. Thanks. Leo, I brought you some food in case you're... You do eat, right? Yes, Phoebe, I eat. - How's Piper? - Oh, you know, she's dealing. I mean, it's not every day that you find out the guy you're seeing isn't human. Although in Piper's case... I wish she didn't have to find out about me like this. Being with her broke the rules, but not being with her breaks my heart. You know, Leo, it's not like we rushed to tell you that we're witches. I think Piper understands about those little secrets that we have to keep. - Any word on Daisy? - Yes and no. Prue called. Andy thinks he found out where Daisy's staying. They're on their way there now. I'm sorry, I "m sorry. It's okay. I know it's bad. I guess I need to work on my poker face a little bit, huh? You know, Leo, didn't you tell me that whitelighters had the ability to heal? - Why can't you just...? - No. My power is for others. I can't use it on myself. You know, we just... We just gotta get you better. Then you and Piper will have lots of time to talk about stuff - when you're well. - Phoebe, I'm not gonna get better. That's ridiculous, Leo. Of course you will. We just have to find something in the Book of Shadows...</i> No, the darklighter's poison can't be reversed. It's meant to kill whitelighters. That's what it's doing. It's working its way through my system. It's just a matter of time. How much time? Not much. I'm gonna die, and there's nothing you can do about it. My power is ebbing, and with it, my ability to cloak Daisy. We're gonna save you both, Leo. I have looked everywhere in this damn book for something, anything to help Leo, and I can't... What's that face? What's the matter? Leo's in pretty bad shape, Piper. And he's getting worse. I know, that's why I need to find an ointment or a cure or something... Okay, you need to listen. This is really hard to say... ...but I think you need to hear it. I think that you need to learn to accept the possibility that... ...maybe we're not supposed to save Leo. Maybe he's not our innocent. Maybe we're only meant to save Daisy. We have to save him, whether we're meant to or not. I got you your favourite. I thought you'd be happy to see me. I've missed this. Us. There is no us, Alec. Please, stop. Never. You're the one, Daisy. You're mine. Indian summer. Do you remember that, Daisy? When it got so hot in the city you could barely breathe, and we sat out on your fire escape taking turns rubbing ice cubes down each other's necks - and backs. - Stop! That's when you first said you loved me. "Forever, Alec. I'll love you forever." Now, is that any way to treat the man who loves you? You're not a man. You're not even human. Don't make me regret telling you who I really am. Don't you get it, Daisy? I love you. And now no one can stop us from being together. Think about it. I found you. What do you think that means? Yeah, that's right. I've clipped Leo's wings, and soon he'll be gone. So I can find you whenever I want. Hello? Manager. Everything okay in there? I win. No. You only win if I come willingly, and I never will. Then I'll never go away. Hey, I'm coming in. No! Don't! I thought I heard... Nobody can keep us apart now, Daisy. Please, stop! - You can't run from me! - Daisy! What the hell was that? Welcome to my world. Hey, Prue's home. She just... "What's mine is yours What's yours is mine</i> - Let our powers cross the line" - I hear rhyming.</i> - What are you doing? - Everything I can. Look, we know Leo can't heal himself, but maybe with his powers, I can. - What are you talking about? - It's a power-switching spell. If Leo and I exchange powers, then I'll have the healing touch and maybe I can fix him. - Hey, what's going on? - You know, the usual. Made some coffee, read the newspaper, walked in on Piper switching powers with Leo, you know. I have to save him, Prue. Okay. Is it safe? To tell you the truth, I don't really care. He's slipping away. And if either one of you has a better idea, then I'm all ears. If not, then I'm casting the spell. And I'd like to do it with the support of my sisters. Cast away. "What's mine is yours What's yours is mine</i> Let our powers cross the line I offer up my gift to share Switch the powers through the air"</i> - Did it work? - I don't know. - I can't freeze. - This is a good sign. The spell must've worked. Okay, that means Phoebe and I... Oh, I think I just had one of Phoebe's premonition thingies. Really? What did you see? That shattering. Kit, no! Did I just do that? And I saw it. So... Okay, you're moving things, I'm having premonitions and Piper can't freeze anymore, which means... Am I gonna get yelled at? - It switched all of our powers? - It's a supernatural Freaky Friday.</i> You know what, I'm gonna go get that, and I'm sure you guys will have all of this worked out by the time I get back. Okay, I can do this. Now heal. Come on, heal. Why aren't these working? Okay, okay, okay. Piper, relax. Remember when we first got our own powers, it took us a while to figure out how to trigger them. I'm doing what I always do. Yes, but maybe you have to find his trigger, not yours. Hey, that was Andy. A new charge came up on Daisy's credit card report. She bought a bus ticket 20 minutes ago. She's running again. If she leaves town, we'll never be able to find her. Let's go. Wait. We have to switch our powers back. - Not until I heal Leo. - Piper, we have to go get Daisy. And I have to heal him. I'm not losing him again. Okay, you know what, you stay here. We have to find Daisy before the darklighter does. We'll just have to do it using each other's powers. Come on. You wanted to see me? Sit down. You make a habit out of showing up at the scene before the crime is reported, inspector? I don't know what you're talking about. Motel Capri. No one called the manager's murder in, Trudeau. Not until you did. - I got a tip. - You're lying. Witnesses place you at the scene with a woman. Five-three or four, brunette, attractive. Ring any bells? Last time I checked, I didn't have to reveal my informants to you, Rodriguez. Maybe not in a court of law, but last time I checked, we weren't in one. This is an IA investigation. You don't have the same rights. You have no idea how much I can hurt you. Just tell us who you're covering for, inspector. Screw you. Excuse me, where can I find bus 24? I told you, I'll always be there for you, Daisy. - I'm sorry. - It's quite all right. I'm in no hurry. I've got forever. You care to join me? - Okay, are you trying to piss me off? - That's exactly what I'm trying to do. - Only it's not working. - How do you know? Because I don't see anything flying across the room. You're gonna need to know how to use my power in case the darklighter shows up, remember? When I first got my power, it was anger that triggered it, - so I need to push your buttons. - Okay, it's not so easy to break me. What was it in high school that the guys started calling you after they caught you making out with someone under the bleachers? - Not gonna work. - What was that? Oh, yeah, "Freebie." Well, class is over. You know that was just a rumour, right? Okay, now it's your turn. We need a premonition. - Where's Daisy? - Do I have to? The last time I got all woozy and... Okay, you know, you guys take for granted that I'm your Innocent Yellow Pages. Okay, this takes work. It is useless, all right. I am never going to get... - Do your ears ring when you do that? - What did you see? I can't be sure, because it went by so fast, but if I were playing odds, I would say that it was Daisy. - Where is she? - Bathroom. Okay. I'm gonna be okay. I can handle this. - You can't run from me, Daisy. - Why won't you leave me alone? Because we can be happy together. We were once, remember? All you have to do is come with me willingly. And what? Watch while you kill more innocent people. You made me do that. That man would still be alive if you had just come with me. That's all I ask, and the killing will stop. We can have eternity together. - I believe this is the ladies' room. - And this is a private conversation. Phoebe! Oops. Okay, now would be a very good time to get angry. I've never used this on a witch before. Oh, Grandma's car, fender dented. You got blamed for it. I did it. I got grounded for that, Prue. I've never used this on a darklighter before. Oh, God. Is he...? Daisy. Leo sent us. We have to take you to him. Come on, it's okay. Oh, God, please work. Come on, work. - When I die... - You're not gonna die. When it happens... ...know this is where I want to be. I love you. Oh, God. He found me again. - How do you know? - That's what he does. He sends me flowers so I know he's watching. No, honey, these are for Prue. They're from Andy. He needs to see me right away. Something wrong with his phone? It's a long story, but I can't leave you guys. No, Prue, we'll go up and check on Leo, and, you know, remember, I'm the one with the active power now. Go. - Are you sure? - Yes, absolutely. We'll be fine. Let's go check on Leo. Piper, we found Daisy and... I tried. He's gone. Daisy, I really don't think this is the best time for you to be alone. Without Leo, it's just a matter of time before Alec finds me again. - I have to get away. - No. My sisters and I can take care of Alec. I don't want you to try. Too many people are dead now because of me. - And now Leo. - Honey, that's not your fault. It doesn't matter. When Alec finds me again, he's not gonna let you get in the way either. It's better off that I leave. Trust me. I have to go. Don't you dare. Leo gave up his life to bring you here. If you leave, Alec will find you for sure, and Leo's death will mean nothing. You're not going anywhere. So I take it we're not here for the same reason we used in high school. Unfortunately, no. Makes me kind of wish for the good old days. Yeah, we tried that already. Prue, I did everything I could to keep Internal Affairs from finding out about you, but there's not much more I can do after today. Why? What happened? I wouldn't tell them what they wanted to know. I turned in my shield. Automatic suspension. I gotta hand it to Rodriguez, he's a pit bull. But when he connects you to all those unsolved cases, he's gonna put the heat on you to get to me. And unless you're careful, he's gonna figure out that it's you and your sisters that he really wants. Wait, you just got suspended and you're telling me to watch my back? Until IA's off my case, it's better if we're not even seen together. You don't want them to connect the dots, believe me. I can't believe that you're worried about me when you're about to lose everything you ever worked for. Every one of those unsolved cases that Rodriguez is tracking down... ...is an innocent life that you and your sisters helped to save. What you're doing is the reason I became a cop. I guess that's how I do it. - I'm sorry. - No, don't be. Everything happens for a reason. Remember, you taught me that? Thanks. Take care, Prue. I thought you might like to talk. He could have stayed with us. He could have fought harder. He was in pain. He had to let go. He didn't have to. Our magic's never failed before. I cast the spell. I took his power. All he had to do was show me how to do it, and he never did. - How can you be mad at him? - Because it should have worked. Prue's having premonitions, and you figured out how to use her power. Why couldn't I find the trigger? Why couldn't he just tell me? Give me his power? He wanted to live. He didn't want to leave you. It's hard to lose someone you love. I love you, Leo. I found it. Leo, I love you. Can you hear me? I love you, Leo. Please hear me. - Piper! - Oh, thank God. I tried so hard, and I couldn't make it work before. - Why didn't you tell me? - That love was the trigger? You had to find that out on your own. Why couldn't you tell me? I don't know. I was afraid. I was afraid if I admitted how I really felt that I would hurt more if I lost you. I'm so sorry. I should have said it before. It's better late than never. - Leo? Oh, my God. How did you...? - There's no time to explain. You've been out of the cloak too long. Alec can find her. Where's Prue? We need to get her back here and we need to find a spell to vanquish darklighter. A power-of-three spell. Okay, I think she has her cell phone on her. No! - All right, no more tricks, ladies. - Let her go, Alec. I don't think so. I have what you love, you've got what I love. Care to trade? Don't do that. I will kill her if I have to. You still think I'm incapable of love, Leo? You want to see how far I'm willing to go? - Alec, no! - Daisy, stay back. You shut up! - No! - Phoebe, stop him. I can't do it. Yes, you can. You have every one of my powers, including the power to find Daisy. Leo, wouldn't it be faster for you guys just to switch your powers back? No, I'm still too weak. It's up to Piper. Now trust me, Piper. Okay, look deep inside yourself... ...at peace... ...a place where you find love. - Wait, I can hear her. - All right, listen to her. Let her tell you where she is. She's screaming. She's afraid. He's pushing her past some trees. Can you recognize the place? Can you tell where they're at? - Heroes Grove. Golden Gate Park. - Let's go. - What about Leo? - I'm fine. Save Daisy. Piper, we really sort of need the power of three to do this. Actually, I don't think we do. I think there's a better way. Piper, you stay with Leo. Prue, you drive. I'll talk. Why are you taking me here? You could have been my mate, Daisy. My equal. I don't understand. Now you've made this place your deathbed. It's your own fault that you won't live. No, Alec, please don't kill me. - If you ever loved me... - If I ever loved you what? You think I could just get over you? Move on? Find somebody else? You're the only woman I've ever loved, Daisy. And now I'm the last man that you'll ever leave. Let her go! - She's mine! - You son of a... Do it, Prue. Now! What's mine is yours What's yours is mine</i> Let our powers cross the line You really should have stayed out of this. I offer up this gift to share Switch our powers through the air.</i> What? Where's my power? - It's hate. Hate is his trigger. - Then hate him. No problem. Bring him to me, Phoebe. What's mine is yours What's yours is mine</i> Let our powers cross the line He's gone. You did it. Are you okay? I can't believe how much hate that took. I never want to feel like that again. You just gave me my life back. Now when we get home, you're gonna give me my power back, right? I almost wish I didn't give you your powers back, then you wouldn't be able to leave. Me too. So if Daisy's a whitelighter to be, doesn't that mean that you used to be...? Human? Yes, it does. I was actually born right here in San Francisco. I lived here all the way up until I went off to the war. You mean, like Vietnam? No, World War II. I left med school and enlisted as a medic. I wanted to help save people, not shoot them. The last thing I remember, I was bandaging a soldier's head wound, then I felt a sharp pain, and then the next thing I know I was floating, surrounded by whitelighters. And they offered me immortality... ...and a chance to help special people like you. I never once ever doubted that I didn't make the right choice... ...until I met you. Ever since, all I can think is how I'd give it up to have a mortal life again, to have a family and grow old... ...with you. Is that possible? Yeah, I can become human again, Piper. I mean, if you want me to. Are you kidding? I want that more than anything. - I don't want to lose you again. - But? But then you wouldn't be able to help other witches, or other future whitelighters, would you? You couldn't help save the next Daisy. I'd better go. I love you. I love you too. - How you doing? - Been better. How about you? Those IA sons of bitches wanted me to wear a mike. Yeah. So you wearing one? What do you think? You in any kind of trouble? Less than you. I just want you to know I'm doing it for a good cause. Andy, I'm your partner. More importantly, I'm your friend. I want to believe that you're on our side. But it would really help me if I knew why you were doing this. I'm not asking for IA, I'm asking for me. I think you owe me that. I told you they'd meet, didn't I? Doesn't do us any good if we can't hear them over the noise. Sure wish I could read lips. Who are you covering for? It's Prue. And all I can tell you is she's connected to all of our unsolved cases. Prue, huh? I was so hoping you weren't gonna say that. - I can't get a thing. - He's covering up for Prue Halliwell. What? How the hell did you...? Oh, my God! Leo. Is it just me, or can you draw a chalk outline around this place? Wow, I don't know what you could possibly mean, Phoebe. I mean, the weekend's almost over, we never made it to Cabo, I'm never gonna see Andy again, and Piper just lost the love of her life. The glass is way more than half full here, Prue. Piper saved the love of her life, Alec is long gone, and Daisy is on her way back to her family. We even managed to straighten out our powers. Thank God. Thank God? I thought that you always wanted an active power. Maybe, but I never thought I'd actually miss my premonitions. Having your power was like wearing a dress that was too tight. Not that that would ever happen. Remember when I said that you had no vision? - Which time? - Well, you will never hear it again. It takes a lot of strength to see what you see. I'll drink to that. If we can't go to Cabo, we might as well bring Cabo to us, right? I don't know, Pheebs, we still have some serious problems. Oh, problems are for Monday mornings.
