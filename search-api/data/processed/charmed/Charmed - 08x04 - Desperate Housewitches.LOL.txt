Previously on Charmed. I should have gone taller. I always wanted to be taller. Why did you go blond? I don't know. I didn't have time to think about it. They think I'm somebody else. You are somebody else. But I'm not a fugitive. That's not the alias that I picked, at least not intentionnally. So, missy, where do you gonna take your next alias from? - Time magazine? - I think I can come up with this one on my own, thank you. - Just make sure it's not one of the most wanted at least, ok? - Trust me. - Dex Lawson, nice to meet you Dex. - You too. So what happened to the demon? I don't know. This chick came along and just scared him off. What chick? I'm here because you need me, right? So the more you teach me, the more I can get out there and go kick some demon ass. We wanna keep to use magic to a minimum so the demons don't find out that we're still alive. Knowing how untrained and untrailed magic could lead to disaster, the one in Atlantis being the prime example, the Elders knew that they needed a nature young magic. The Elders knew that they needed a nature young magic. Billie. Billie, are you listenning to me? Yeah yeah. Entering magic. Elders, yeah. Ok, listen. If you're gonna take over the fight for the greater good, I really don't think it's a bad idea if... you... know the history of good magic. Listen, Paige wanted me to teach you something good. And I think you're kind of making me look bad. Oh come on. You could be teaching me "tic tac toe", she wouldn't care. She's just happy of getting me out of her back for the day. Ok, so. The magical community knew it needed a place to a nature young magic. So the Elders created magic school. Yeah you know, I just imagine a bunch of old fats in robes, lecturing on the moral applications of magic. There's that. There's also advanced courses on telekinesis, spell casting, potion making, Wait, what? astral projection, and medieval... weaponry. They really teach that stuff? This is so cool! Oh sorry. Charmed 804: Desperate Housewitches Translation by Teamcharmed from forom.com et teamcharmed.net Synchro / Transcript: Titelilie Translation: Lucile76, RonanaSplit, Launka, Demonclem, Chryssie Rereading: Ronanasplit, Chryssie, Titelilie, Kiff, Guix Particular thanks to Any1 Ok, either there's a gremlin infesting in this house otherwise our orby fingers got the whole of my jewelry. Jewels? This so early in the morning, what's the occasion? I have a coffee date. I'm trying to get out of here before Leo changes his mind about training Billie. Oh yeah! Oh nice try little pirate. I see what you've got here. Thanks a lot, matey. Oh Wyatt, honey, mummy said no magic. Oh it's good to know you're more worried about him using magic than you are about him... stealing. Actually I'm more concerned with him blowing our cover with this school play coming up. - Not your cup of tea, uh? - No, I'm just a little out of practice. Thank you. Well, me too. And the morning date. Ok, here is my problem. Do I pick a lipstick color to go with my face or my alias' face. Well. Seeing as we're the only ones who can see the real you, I'd go with... pink. oh... I take it you're not liking this whole new you thing. No. I guess I just miss the old me a little. Uh, why are you doing this online dating thing anyway? You could ask out all the time. Not anymore. Not with me having a deal Billie all the time. Besides, there aren't any risks here and now what Phoebe's doing, right? What do you mean? I don't care how many charts she looks at to see if Dex is the father of her future child, he's still a player. Oh Paige! What? It's true. Even her own newspaper writes about it in the gossip column. Yeah, I realize that. But in the interest iof sisterly harmony, I would really... Hey guys, did you heard the good news? Let me guess, Dex is the one? Yep, according to every magical calculation, there is. Uh uh. Not only that, but it all times out perfectly. You know, my vision of us getting married, when I'm supposed to get pregnant, all of it. He's the one. Yeah, maybe you should just check that one more time. I'm sorry? What do you think of this nazy costum? Come on sweetie. Don't you wanna be one of Cinderella's footmen? Ok hang on a second. Come on, what's wrong? It's a good costum. Look at it. Shiny. What's the matter? Don't be sad buddy. Hey cutty boy, what's going on? I don't know. He's never usually like this. He just hates it. Maybe he's allergic to the fabric. Or something could be sticking him. A pen, a needle maybe? Oh no, no I checked it. Oh that could not have been in there, really. He tried it on before, it was fine. It's ok. You're doing the best you can. Not been as his real mum in all. You're a distant cousin right? Oh we're a little bit closer that you think. Well, it's that good to know. Here. How is the other costum coming? - Oh, the other? - The pumpkin. It was on the info sheet I sent out. The other costum, right! It's also in up! Great! As long as he looks like the other boys, you know how kids can tease. Ok Wyatt, let's go working on that foreseen, ok? Let's go! Our little secret. Shhh. Looks can be deceiving but your picture on the dating site didn't you injustice. Thank you. It's very nice. So, tell what you do that keeps you so crazy busy. - Did I say that I was? - No. But I sense you're like me. Old fashioned and heart, not one to be online dating things but too swirl to meet people any other way. Yeah. We could say I haven't had a normal life and well but I think that could be changing. Good. So, what do you do? Well, I teach or I taught, kind of at a special needs school, if you will. I tutor on one-on-one now, girls are all pain in the butt... Ok, resharing. What do you do? Ok, well... uh... Where to start? I find the most exciting thing about market research is the variety. I mean, the awareness we interface with, whether it'd be the jobs from a pseudo-called validation, a qualification, FDA compliance, infotech. You name it. The first thing we do is we've gotta a data base and a quarter. Bla bla bla... Dex? Hey baby. Waouh! So I'm fine with color but if you can see if Jess can fit me for a quick cut after my legwax, that would be great. Sure. Do you want me to pick up some candles? You know, set the mood. Great idea, yeah. Make it a couple of dozen. Thanks. Hey there. Bad time? Hi, no. I'm just getting ready for my big date with Dex tomorrow. Hey, weren't you on a date? Yeah, that didn't go so well. I know it's hard. I just got really lucky that Dex showed up at my funeral. Yeah. Right. You've know him for what, all of a few weeks now? Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, how well do you really know him considering the "amount of time" you've actually spent together? Paige, where are you going with this? Nowhere! That's where! Ok. Well, we've been through this before. I didn't like Richard, you didn't like Cole. But we promised each other that we'd stay out of each other love life, it's right? Ok, just answer me this. How well do you really know him? Paige, please don't start. Will it kill you just to slow things down, you know, a smidgen. You know, I can't slow things down, because of my premonitions. They're not always literal. But I still have to honor them, don't I? - But look... - Honey, I really like him and I really care about him, and he really cares about me. Ok, so don't worry. Ok? No, it's not ok. Piper! Look, I'm a little behind in the crafty department, ok? I didn't have time to owe my skills with the demon attacking every five minutes! It's still not a good idea. You know what? It's a great idea. While all the other mothers were out there making cutsy costums, I had my nose in this book. So this book is gonna help me make a damn cute pumpkin outfit. What's up? Oh yeah, just I'm soaking up knowledge. I'm a virtual sponge. Good. Keep it up. So you know, on besides personnal gain... Why are you so sweaty? Oh you know, there was this sale on witch hunts and the lying, and the burning, it's just outta control. Well that was another called up, how about what happened over to magic school. It's some real education. Ok, we can't because you know magic school being the heart of good magic, you know, we don't wanna expose ourselves. And what is your wife doing? Making up for lost time! Now, zip it! Actually, she is not gonna use magic to make Wyatt a costum. Oh no? Watch me! You wanted a normal life, remember? Ok, look, that was before I realized our son was gonna be humiliated in front of his entire class! You know, that happened to me all the time, just made me stronger. And shut it! Ok, is this about Wyatt's humiliation or yours? - No! It's about Wyatt and the pagent and... - and you are doing Mandy? Fine. No magic. But I will still make the best damn pumpkin outfit ever and that woman will be sorry she tangled with me. That is one desperate housewife. Well? I'm beginning to gain the boy's trust. Once he knows it's safe to use his powers around me... What's taking you so long? You were supposed to have this cleaned days ago. Yeah, well. It wasn't as easy as we thought. - It's a lot more... - I don't wanna hear any more excuses. Do you understand me? We need to create a comfortable place for the boy. A familiar place. Or else he'll never do what I want him to do. Don't let that thing die. Not until after I've done using it to get Wyatt. Ok, honey, I know it's not the morning for this to happen, but the coffee maker's on the fritz. Oh, that's ok. Do you want me to make you some tea instead? - Tea? - Yeah. It's no problem. I was just cleaning up. Well, you are in a surprisingly cheaper mood for someone who hasn't slept all night. - Well, I had to finish Wyatt's pumpkin costum, did'nt I? - And did you finish? Absolutely! You know, actually, being a super mum can be surprisingly satisfying. Don't forget. You're really his super legal guardian. Yes. And are there any other soft spots you'd like to poke at while you're here? Honey, I'm sorry. It's no big deal. I think at least Wyatt knows who his mother really is. Of course he does. He sees you as Piper, we all do. Yeah but it's gotta be confusing for him, especially cause of his classmate that thinks I'm his cousin. His distant cousin. Look, he's just gonna have to get used to the way things are. Hey. Do you wanna hear my plan how to save Phoebe from Dex? Oh come on Paige. Do we really need this inner life right now? Do we really need our sister marrying a cheater? It was just a kiss, right? So maybe it was his sister? That's disgusting. Sisters don't kiss brothers like that. - Paige! - Look, all I'm gonna do is find out who she really is, Phoebe is never gonna know. She is gonna kill you. She is gonna thank me. - Right my dear, have a great time to play. - Thanks. How you like me now! We're close. Pretty elaborate ritual you got us doing here. When do I get to know who you're planning to conjure? You don't get to know. Actually I think I do. Especially if I'm the only one who knows celebrating a demon from the waste land. If you were the only one, I wouldn't need the boy, no, would I? Why do you need him? What does he offer? He offers power. A power neither you or I possess. A power I'm going to need if I'm going to bring back the demon I have in mind. Tempus? Barbas? - Zankou? - When it's time... Now, or I stop what I am doing. - You dare challenge me? - No. I was just thinking I had the right to know what we're dealing with. That's all. Especially considering the inner risks involved with kidnapping the son of a Charmed One. I'm not kidnapping him. I'm offering him a new home. A family, a place to express his full potential. Even if you lure him in here, what makes you think he'll stay? Because I'm going to replace the mummy he lost. And the Source will replace his daddy. The Source? We can't bring him back. You're right, we can't. Not without Wyatt anyway. Any other questions? I'm sorry, is that yours? Is your name Sylvia too? Sylvia, that's so funny. I thought I recognized you. How are you? Fine. Great. Thanks. You don't remember me, do you? That's ok. It was a long time ago, when we met in a kind crowded party. Dex introduced us actually. Oh Dex, right. - You know, I'm sorry, I don't remember meeting... - Jo. Jo Bennett. I'm an art dealer. Really? So am I! What firm? Uh... I deal mostly with private collectors, you know, kind of uh... transactions, stuff like that. How is Dex? Dex is good, I guess. Yeah, yeah, he just had a show last week, running really well. He's got some good stuff. Great, great. Are you two still going out? Dex and I? No, not anymore. Really? Are you sure about that? Yeah, I think I'd remember that. Why are you asking? Probably just a strange thing. I was actually here you know, yesterday, and I I thought I saw you two kissing. Oh yeah, that. You know, that was nothing. We were just saying hello. We broke up months ago. That's great. No, that's awful. Sorry about that. It was fun while it lasted. No, still it's fun. Once in a while, actually. If you know, cool the break up sex. Break up sex? Yeah, is there anything better? Listen, I got to run. It was nice seeing you again. Yeah it was really nice seeing you. What do you mean he's not a pumpkin? Oh, I can't imagine how it slipped my mind. We decided mice costums would be more comfortable. Oh but Wyatt is really excited about being a pumpkin. Poor thing. Maybe the problem is the green thing on his head. The green thing is the stem, the stem of the pumpkin I was up all night making. And it's a cute pumpkin. Really. Well I think he should wear it. But this isn't about you now. - Is it? - Excuse me? Ladies, we all want the children to be happy, don't we? Especially Wyatt. - He's been through so much lately. - And losing his mother and all. We don't wanna traumatize him any further. Oh no, he's not traumatized. I mean, he has me. And you're doing the very best job you can. Considering, Considering what? How new you are at this. - How overworked you must be. - She's right. You do look exhausted. I'm fine. And Wyatt's fine. We're all fine. Now, if you'll just excuse me. Sweetie, if you're worried about the mouse costum, I can whip one up for Wyatt in a jiffy. I can jiffy whip one up myself actually. Really, it's no problem. You've done quite enough already. Leo? Please tell me there's a demon somewhere because I really need to blow something up. Sorry, everything's fine except Billie wants to go to magic school. What? No. That's what I told her too. That woman is out to get me. Look, Piper, I think she's defiant, but I think her intentions are good. Well she may seem nice and sweet but there is something deeply twit beneath the surface. - Come on Piper, I don't think Billie... - No, not Billy. Mandy. Miss too good to be true has been quizzing about. Not only is she getting more clownly perfect with every moment but now she's actually out to get me! Don't be ridiculous. I wish I could just blow her up. Piper you can't blow her up, she's not a demon. No, she's worse than a demon. She's a room mum. It's time to come home now honey, ok? Hey, alright, what did she say? We're going to magic school or what? Well she said what I thought, she said no. It's too dangerous. Come on! You always listen to what she says. You guys used to live in great danger. And now we retired. Exactly, you've all been housing here. It's my job to pick up the sack around here. I need to learn quick and magic school has books, and an apothecary and really bitchy weapons. Which you can read about in the text book. I'm done reading. I'm going to magic school. - How? - I'm a quick study. Ok wait what we're gonna get exposed. You did it? I did? Oh cool. Something's not right. - Who are they? Are they students? - No, they're demons. Demons? What are demons doing here? Taking over. Ok this is bad. This is really bad. They're kind of cute though. No, they're not cute! Ok? They're demons. Do you understand what that means? Hurt, mime, kill? A lot of minor syllables I got it. You don't have it, if they take it over, it means they've access to everything. spells, maps, weapons. You know, these make coming an idea. With everything here, they could wipe us all out, Ok? Whitelighters, Elders, Gnomes,... - Witches? - Everything. Ok, fine. What do we do? We've got to get out of here fast. Fine, let's go! So you brought the extra potion, right? No. You're kidding! Do I look like I think I had it. Come on, you used to run the place. How did you go back and forth? Paige orbed me. Ok, there is a spell in one of these books, if we can find it. Ok I'm listenning. Ok, here is what we're gonna do. Ok, don't move, don't say a word. Nice. - Could you give me a hand? - What are you doing? If you can't beat them, join them. Leo? Leo! Let's see. What do we have in here? Oh boy. You don't wanna eat this dry yecchy sandwich your guardian made, do you? Damn all cousin, damn all guardian. Here we go. You can have this. Right? - Mummy. - Mummy! Sweet heart, listen. I know you miss your mummy. But I am here. And I love when you do your magic. I do. In fact, why don't we just orb this pooh pooh sandwich, right into that trash can, can you do that? No one's watching. Look at that! Good boy, good boy! Good job! Let's do that again. Ok, ok. For Phoebe. I created this one as a complain to the other you saw... Hi Sylvia. I hope I'm not interrupting. - Actually, if you could just give... - It's alright. We'll come back. Are you sure? I'm sure... We need to think about it anyway. We'll call you. Thanks for coming by. Let me know what you think. I hope I didn't stopped the sale. What are you doing here Sylvia? Well, I'm fine in the sack, but it don't rate a work visit, huh? What? Please, don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. But I don't know what you're talking about. How quickly they forget! Ok, look, here is the deal, buster. It's over, alright? Finito, no muss at today's news. You got it? No, not really. I'll try to spell this out for you. I am done with the break up sex. It's not fair to me or anyone else you might be seeing at the moment. Understand? Yeah, but... Forget it. No more freebees. It's time to make an other man of yourself. - Be true to the one you love. - What the hell are you talking about? You know damn well what I'm talking about. We haven't slept together in over two months. - We haven't? - No. Do I lie a lot? It's why we broke up. Dex. Hey! Phoebe! Excuse me? Freebees. We were just talking about freebees. Julie, Sylvia. Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. Oh God, look at the time, I've got to go. Nice meeting you. Take care. Goodbye. Ex girl friend. Will you just leave it alone? You looks hot. Really? Thanks. I think. Hey you're watching buddy! You're trying to get us killed? We're supposed to be evil, not wimps. - Let's just find the spell, ok? - Fine. Everything's out of order. What is? The books. I don't think it's where it's supposed to be. What do you think they're doing? I don't know but I don't wanna hang around... Wyatt! Welcome home sweetie boy! - You wanna play with the toys? - Yeah. Come over here. Why did she get Wyatt? I should let Piper blow her up. Why, you know her? Yeah, she's Wyatt room mum or... So she said she was. What does she want with him? Wait. Where are you going? Go to see my son! Are you insane? Look around you, you're getting us killed, you're gonna get me killed! We need to get out of here, we're gotta get help. It feels good to be back in magic school, doesn't it? It's where you belong. Is everything ready? Yes. Although, are you sure of what you're doing? The boy trusts me. - Otherwise he would have orbed me... - I wasn't talking about the boy. I was talking about the Source. I found it. - Who's the Source? - The Source? I'm just saying he could be pretty pissed. After all he never thought the Charmed Ones could vanquish him. I'll handle him. How? I'm bringing him back from the dead, aren't I? He'll own me. Plus he'll have the son of a Charmed One to raise as his very own. What better revenge is there than that? - Okay, the spell is on page 86. You go get out of here. - Wait, you wanna me go by myself, why? I'm not leaving my son! You don't have any powers. I have powers. I should stay. There's nothing worse than the Source, do you understand me? I can't leave my son alone. Okay, just be careful. Are you sure an other member of the family didn't take him up? Of course I'm sure. Otherwise, I wouldn't be freaking out right now. Oh okay, okay, here, see? Nothing to worry about. Wyatt is with Mandy. Mandy? - You let him go with Mandy? - Well, she has already been looking out for him lately. I'm sure he's having a time of his life with her son as we speak. Really? Then why is her son still here? She would never... Well it's not like Mandy. She's a demon! Jealousy is an ugly, ugly thing. You, crazy witch! - That was you, I know it! - I was just trying to protect you! How? By posing as his ex? I thought he was cheating on you! What? I told you to stay out of it! I saw him kiss her! What? Wyatt's been kidnapped. And Leo is missing. Seven years of doing this. I should've known something was unright with Mandy. Nobody's that perfect, not even her. But she has a child and a husband. That's why I think a demon possessed her to get to Wyatt. Somebody starts scrying for him! Fine, I'm going, I'm going. Okay I'm gonna work on vanquishing potion, you work on the depossession spell. I can't believe I let her take him right here, under my nose. What was I doing? It's okay, we're gonna get him back. How? He could be anywhere. He's at magic school. Hey. Where did you come from? And how do you know that? Well I just came from here, Leo stayed behind to keep on eye on Wyatt. Why are you wearing that? Well if I wasn't, I would be dead. There are demons everywhere, they're taking over the place. - What? - How? Who cares? What do they want with Wyatt? They need him te help bring back the Source. Okay, Leo looked just like that when he heard that name. Who is this guy, I mean, how do we annihilate him? You don't. We do. You're not ready, trust me. Well, ladies, how are we enjoying our demon free existence now? You can use all the magic you want here. Whatever you want, whenever you want. It's not fun? But first, I want your power to bring back a special friend of ours. Somebody who's gonna to be very very happy to see you, okay? Yeah. Alright. Good. It will be easy, I'll show you. Don't you want the Source to know the real you? So he knows you're a demon. I don't want to risk scaring the child. Stand back. Ready? Okay. We call to you, that away was torn, return master of all evil born. Put your finger in it, it will make some really need magic! My lord, Where am I? Who brought me back? We did. It was me, actually, who brought you back. Why? Why else? Power. Yours, mine, his. One big unstoppable happy family! What possible power could he have that I might covert? Charmed power. That's right. He's the first born, the prophecy. - How did you get him away... - The Charmed Ones are dead. I'm sorry just boiling your fun, I'm sure you would've wanted revenge. Although, our raising him as evil might be even better, don't you think? You got it all worked out, don't you? Except for one thing. Why do I need you? Because every mortal boy needs his mummy. And I'm sure you would enjoy being the head of the demonic dinasty. What's your name, little boy? Let him be. What did you say? You don't wanna scare him and he's not use to your kind. Who are you? I've never seen you before. I've been here. I've also been in the boy's house. With Zankou. Is that a fact? See, he knows me obviously. He seems to more than just know you. Leave us. Who are you? Billy was right. It's demons' central. Just trying to help you with the kid, that's all. Then why don't I believe that? We've got to hurry. Leo's in trouble. Yeah, how are we gonna stop the Source, we have no potions. That's gonna take a lot more than potions. How did you do the last time? - Not the same way we're going to do it this time. - You have a plan? Yeah. And it starts with Mandy. If you don't trust him, just kill him. Then we'll go on a family outing, savour a few innocents, have a pic nic. There's not a trap of evil in him. He's not a demon at all! This is too good to be true, - daddy. - What? What happened? Who did this? We did. I should have known the Charmed Ones weren't really dead. Only you've gone soft in my absence. Without the hollow, you can't take me. Oh really? Take up kick! Nooooooooooo! Talking about your ball and chain. I don't really understand. How did you... She conjured him, so they're connected. She goes, he goes. For eternity now. Ok, well, we probably should get out of here before any other demon recognises us. What are we gonna do with her? Oh come on, we don't need to save her. What? She's still too perky. Hey there. Hi. What do you still doing up? I'm just studying. Maybe you should give you a little bit of rest for tonight. No thanks, I just wanna look up a few more things. You know I didn't realise I had to learn how to vanquish vanquished demons. Yeah well, that's the funny thing about here, nodody really stays dead a long. Yeah I'm noticing that. - Wait, Paige, - Yeah? Are you guys worried at all about demons being at the magic school? Look, what can they do there? Yeah, we are pretty worried. So, in that case maybe you should stay up, and study a little longer. Dex? Hey! What are you doing here? I only thought we could talk. Yeah, of course, come on in. Look I want to apologize for what happened earlier. Apologize? About Sylvia and I, I mean, Oh! You know, I don't think you need to explain yourself about any of that. No I do. No I think I have a pretty good idea of what was going on. Actually you don't. Not completely. I mean, there's nothing going on between Sylvia and I anymore. - Really. - Ok and why? We broke up a while ago. But I've sort have been staying in contact with her. Staying in contact? Look I should have probably made a cleaner break than I did, but I guess I didn't realise it until today. I'm not looking for anybody else in my life right now, Julie. I just want you. Forgive me? Hold that thought. Hi. Don't mind me. I was just... I was just coming to say good night. No, you weren't. - But thank you. - For what? For butting in. Well, you're welcome. Just don't do it again. Pinch me. Why? Cause I can't believe we're actually going to see a real life normal school play. Hard to believe. Yeah. Still you know, we should let Wyatt blow off some magical steam now and then. Good idea. See Mandy over there? Yeah, if she all I knew. She might. Maybe on some serial level.
