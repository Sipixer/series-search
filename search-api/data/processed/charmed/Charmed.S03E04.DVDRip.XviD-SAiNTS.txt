or a bad witch? I am going to be a very good witch from now on. And you picked a role model who wears lots and lots of pink? - Yes. - Glinda helped innocents, didn't she? - Yes. - You had the answer all along? That's not help, that's mind games. I'm not gonna let you spoil my new attitude. I'm going to celebrate the witch's holiday with enthusiasm. The problem is, you never know what you're celebrating - when you celebrate Halloween. - Details. Where's Darryl? He's in the kitchen, on the phone. Hook-nosed hags riding broomsticks, that's what we're celebrating. Personally, I am offended by the representation of witches in popular culture. Right, which is why you're dressed as the mistress of the dark. This costume happens to be a protest statement. I am so impressed that you can make a protest statement and show cleavage all at the same time. - Thanks. - Amazing. Let's go. All right, inspector. Put down the phone and nobody gets hurt. Yeah, sweetie, I gotta go. Give your folks my love, okay? I miss you guys. - Nice costume. - Yeah, it's from my rookie days. - Still fits. - Yeah, mine too. Isn't that from World War II? Who are you? I'll explain on the way. So in the meantime, we can just stick together, since we are both dateless. He's not dateless, he's married. You're dateless because you're picky. No. I'm not settling, all right. The perfect guy is out there, a real man, and I will find him, trust me. And they're gonna love the popcorn and caramel in your teeth too. All right, Darryl, let's go. Somebody, get something. We can't leave yet. We have to wait for Cole. Cole Turner? The ADA? You're dating him? No, I just sort of invited him to go along with us. It wasn't set in stone or anything, but something must've come up. Hey. Hey, cool costumes, dudes. What the hell are you doing? Belthazor? I use the name Cole here. Let him go. We don't need him. Not to get the Charmed Ones. My next question, didn't they already get you... ...two years ago? - Yeah, but it's Halloween. When the veil between worlds thin... ...when the demons who know how can return to seek their revenge. I know. Which is why I have a different plan for the witches. One that doesn't include you. One that's been approved by the Triad. We don't answer to anyone anymore. We're dead. There's dead... ...and there's dead. Fine. I'll just move up my timetable. I've always hated that demon. Nice costume though. I want a picture of all of us first, but I have to get my broomstick. Cliché. Come on, you guys, hurry up. Trick or treat. Oh, my God, that is so weird, they look just like the Grim... - "Uh-oh" what? - Piper. Prue. Phoebe. Didn't we vanquish them already? That's not what I wanted to warn you about. What do you mean? That's what I wanted to warn you about. Look out! Leo, what the hell is...? Wait! They don't know what's happening! This isn't good, right? - Is everybody okay? - Too soon to tell. Did the Grimlocks do this? Unless we're dead and this is the hereafter, I don't think so. Eternally Elvira. All right. - So this sort of looks like an altar. - A witch's altar. What's going on? There they are! Kill the witches! - You had to ask?! - Not good, not good, not good. We're not in Kansas anymore. Come along! Over there! Come with me this way. Don't tell me we've time-travelled again. I hate time-travelling. You do? I was burned at the stake last time, remember? All right, let's make sure that doesn't happen again. From what they're wearing, it looks to be, what, 16, 1700s? Where the life expectancy of the average witch is, what, 15 minutes. Find anything, Micah? No, nothing here. - Ride on. - Ride on, men! Hey, why didn't you let me freeze him? I don't know, there was just something... Okay, you know what? I don't care why we're here or how we got here, I just wanna get home. I've got a life to live and decorations to hang, so where's the damn vortex? I don't know where the vortex... First demons I've ever seen. Actually, except for that blond with the funky snake tongue thingy. - What are they? - I don't know. How do you know they didn't make the girls disappear? Because this is different. This is a time portal that my bosses sent them through. Which is closed now, damn it. - Who are you? - I'm their... Never mind. It's too complicated. I gotta get you out of here before they unfreeze. - Hold it, I'm not going anywhere. - I've gotta figure out a way to get rid of these demons before the girls return, otherwise they'll be sitting ducks. - Are you sure they're coming back? - They better be. They gotta do it before Halloween ends too, which means... Which means you're gonna need my help. You don't know what you're up against here. The problem is, neither do you, which means you're gonna need a cop around to help you figure it out. They're like sisters to me, Leo. All right. Phoebe said that she thought they had vanquished these demons before, so the first thing we have to do is... Run. Come on, let's go! At least we can't die. They can. We have to figure out where the witches went. We know where they went. Cole got them. But if he fails, they'll be back. And they'll be in our way. Blessed be. Our prayers have been answered. - We need your help. - Excuse me? Forgive me for the manner in which you were brought here, but we had to make sure you were who we'd sent for. This doorway would have told us if you were evil. - Where can we get one of those? - All right, wait. Who do you think we are? The most powerful good witches of all time, of course. - Okay, lucky guess. - And you are? I am Eva. A midwife, a witch, and a free citizen of the colony of Virginia. These good women are my coven. Come. Now, we don't have much time. No one can suspect that you've come to us from the future. - This is for you. - Witches must not have to hide in your time. - What year are you from? - 2000. - What year is it now? - 1670. All right, so why do you need our help? To save a magical baby who's prophesied to be born tonight. - Save it from who? - A dark practitioner. She kidnapped the baby's mother in hopes of raising the child evil. If that happens, good magic will never flourish in the New World. You must rescue Charlotte so that you can bring her here and we can deliver her baby within our own protective circle. Wait a minute, you have the power to bring us through time but you don't have the power to set her free yourself? Well, we cast spells to prepare your way of course, but we know it was the power of All Hallows Eve that brought you here, not us. All Hallows Eve? A witch's most sacred day. The day when the source of all magic can be tapped into. How can you not know about All Hallows Eve? It isn't what it used to be. Wait a minute. You can tap into that power to send us home, right? We assumed you could. They assumed that we could. Okay, well, Piper, I have an idea. So, what time is it? It's 2:15. You've made a big clock so small, you must possess great magic. Just a good credit card. Okay, excuse us for a minute. Can we talk? All right, I think that I have this figured out. I think that they sent us here, and that's what Leo was trying to tell us. Leave it to them to zap first and give instructions never. All right, but if I'm right, the only way that they are going to let us go home is if we bring that baby back here by midnight. - All right, Eva, do you have a plan? - Yes. This vial holds a potion which will put the men who guard the house to sleep. Then you'll use your powers to bring the mother back here. Easy for her to say. We must be careful. Looks like they're having a party. It's the kidnapper, Ruth Cobb. She's doing it pretending to mock All Hallows Eve, but I know better. She's really doing it to tap into the powers of dark magic. - Looks like our welcoming committee. - Witch hunters. Hunters of good witches, maybe. They work for Ruth. They're after us. Not all of them. Beware the talismans. They've barred our way each time we tried to rescue Charlotte. Oh, honey, those don't really pack much of a punch - where we come from. - No, you don't realize... Witches! There they are! What the hell was that? - The talismans? - No way they have that much power. They never have before. Ruth's using the magic of All Hallows Eve. - Guards! - All right, I got them. I got them. What just happened? What's the matter? I don't know. Piper! - Use your powers. - We don't have any. - What? - Run! Oh, God. It appears your witch friend has brought others to try and rescue you again. Unfortunately, she's been wounded. Oh, easy now, Charlotte. We wouldn't want anything bad to happen to your baby, now would we? I won't let you have my baby. Oh, you won't have a choice. Especially since somebody very special has recently arrived to ensure it. - How much longer, Ruth? - Soon. By nightfall perhaps. You imbued the talismans with great power. Care to share your secrets? Who are you? Where do you come from, pray tell? I come from the future. To change it. Eva, we're sorry. We didn't know that our powers weren't... Just leave us. Just go back to wherever it is you came from. We asked for the most powerful witches of all time, and instead we get powerless frauds. Okay, I know you're a little disappointed, but "frauds" is a little harsh, don't you think? We do have powers, we just... Or at least, we had them, we just can't access them right now. Maybe that's because technically we don't really exist yet, so neither do our powers. Protecting this baby is my destiny. How can we come this far just to fail? We're asking ourselves the same thing. Bite down. What are you doing? - Cauterising her wound. - No, no, no, no, no. We may not have our powers, but we do have basics. Just get some hot water and some soap and some clean cloths. Hurry. Eva, don't give up on us yet, all right. I know that we can help. Yeah, we've been through tougher jams than this before. - We have? - Haven't we? We were born witches. That makes us innately magical. Maybe you can just teach us how to tap into it. - There's not enough time. - We're quick studies. That thing's not gonna work on them. Maybe not, but it makes them think twice about it. Otherwise they would've blasted in on us by now. - Plus, it's the only thing we got. - Maybe not. I think I found out who they are. "Grimlocks: underground demons who are sensitive to light and steal children's sight so they can see the aura that surrounds good people and strangle them with it." That snake-tongued blond is looking better and better. At least there's a vanquishing potion here. We can't keep waiting here. We should be downstairs, waiting for the witches. We can't absorb any more wounds. If they come into range, we won't have to. Darryl. I told you you didn't know what you were up against. Who are you? Come on, we got a potion to cook up. Your contractions are coming closer together. It won't be long now. Don't touch me. There's no need for you to be any more uncomfortable than you have to be. Really? Then let me go. I beg you. Even if I could, it wouldn't help. Another would be sent to take you right back. What? What do you see? A force of great good. From your time. Here for the baby as well. Three of them. I'm not surprised. My travelling here undoubtedly alerted the other side. - But this new force... - If it's who I think it is, I can handle them. You just make sure she stays here through midnight. Here. Dolls? We tap into our powers with dolls? It's not just a doll, it's a totem. It reminds us of the wisdom and the power of women. Okay, but what does it have to do with? The witch's journey is a walk of wisdom collected over the years, Phoebe. Wisdom gives us power. Power frightens the fearful and ignorant. Well, that would certainly explain why in our time, witches are made to look silly on Halloween. And this magic, this knowledge, is forgotten? We could get it back if you teach us. Here. The conical hat is a spiritual point. It helps to channel our magic. Keeps us centred, focused. The apple holds a pentacle in its heart. Add a laurel leaf, you will block the path of evil. - A simple laurel leaf? - Simple, but powerful. Remember, there is magic all around you. Especially on this night. What's with the masks? Demons walk freely on All Hallows Eve. So a mask allows you to hide your identity, walk amongst them. Can I see that? Okay, now, don't tell me you ride around on this thing. Anything's possible. Here. The broom's traditional purpose is to sweep evil from your path. Sweep east to west, same path as the sun travels. Like anything else in magic, it's how you do it. With knowledge and reverence. Wow, do I feel silly. - What happened? - Nothing. - Must've been just a spark. - No. You felt the power. All right, Sally will go with you to Ruth's house. She'll give you the last few things you'll need. I wish I could go with you. We'll do great. You've armed us well. Remember, connect with the power of this day. Will you know what they look like? What are you doing here? I told you to stay at the house. The house is guarded by men and magic. Charlotte's not going anywhere. I've seen the future, Ruth. Your ignorance is your destiny. Charlotte should be in the bedroom at the top of the stairs. Be careful. Ruth's guards are everywhere. If they see you with these tools, they'll know you as witches. - Don't worry, we won't fail this time. - I know you won't. Which of you - will be standing guard for the others? - Phoebe. If need be, this will turn away evil spirits. Perhaps even the demon you think Ruth summoned. You're kidding, right? - Okay, you're not kidding. - Blessed be. Good luck. All right. - Trick or treat. - Oh, boy. Care to know your future, milady? Oh, no, thanks, I'm pretty familiar with it already. Are you certain? I can show you the first initial of your true love's name. Really? You can do that? - With a simple peel of the apple. - Prove it. And why would you be interested, sir? And why wouldn't you be? Okay. How do I do it? First, you must fill your heart with only thoughts of love. And close your eyes and blow on the peel. Drop the peel into the water. - And watch. - And how is it that apple - knows this big secret? - It's simple, milady. Apples are the fruit of knowledge. It is C. The name of your true love begins with a C. Cole. Witch! No. Phoebe! - Those two as well! - Hey! - There's your three. - Hang the witches. - Hang them. - Hang them! - Hang them all! - My pleasure. - Take them from here. - Hang them! Take them away. To the woods. Hang them. Take them away. Come along. Hang them! Tell me this isn't happening. Hang, witch. Onward. Ride on. My apologies. A little trick I learned from the French. Run the noose line to the waist. Yeah, well, it's a really good thing the other guards didn't see you do that. Wait a minute. I don't understand. How did you know you could trust him? By the look in his eyes. So that would be the second time that you've saved our necks. And what beautiful necks they are. I'm Micah. I'm charmed. All right, I hate to bust up the balcony scene, Romeo, but why do you keep saving us? And why are you running with the witch hunters? So I can undo their work whenever possible. I've seen what dark magic can do. If you're fighting that, I'm on your side. And I should get back before anyone gets suspicious. Thank you. Another time. Who was that masked man? Okay, you finally found a real man. Too bad he lives in colonial Virginia, Prue. We need to get out of here. Pay attention. Okay, any idea how we're gonna save the baby? Well, they think we're dead now. They certainly aren't expecting us. Right. Besides, you guys... ...we're witches, and it's All Hallows Eve, so... - All right, glow elsewhere. - Oh, right. We need more thyme. I can't help you there, buddy. It's almost nightfall. No, I'm talking about an herb, it's for the potion. It's over there. - Thyme, right? - Yeah. Do you think they know what we're doing in here? Probably. It'd explain why they haven't burst in on us yet. - Trick-or-treaters? - Or a trap. Didn't you say those things steal kids' sight? No, I should go. I can orb. Which might be exactly what they're waiting for. Stay here, finish that potion. No matter what happens, you make sure you bring the girls home safe... ...whoever you are. - Trick or treat. - Spread the word. We're out of candy. I don't see Ruth or the guards. What time is it? It's... It's 6. And we're running out of time and magic. - It doesn't change what we have to do. - How will we get past the talismans? - Do you remember what Eva said? - The "powerless frauds" part? No, the "magic is all around us" part. Well, it's time we learned how to access that to sweep away evil. What, no funny hat? Lavender. Didn't she say that was a protection herb? Yes, and the wisdom of the women before us will guide us again. Okay, get sweeping. Okay, which way is east? That way. - Did you see that? - Yeah, keep going. - It's working. - All right, that's good. - Micah. - Prue, you can't. Wrong. - They found him out. - We have to get to Charlotte. What would he want you to do? - Hi. - Who are you? Eva sent us. Charlotte, we're here to take you back. You're lying. I don't believe... Okay, okay. How does Lamaze breathing go? Oh, that's it. Oh, God. Okay, try this. Okay, we'll do this. How are you making the pain go away? Good magic. Just keep breathing. - Good magic? - Acupressure. Good idea. All right. We need to get you out of here. Come on, honey. It's okay. - Oh, her water just broke. - I see that. It serves you well. - Quickly, check the house! - No. I know these witches. They've already got Charlotte. Follow me. I know where they're going. The altar. Okay, just a little while longer, we're almost there. - I can't. I'm sorry. - Yes, Charlotte. - You can do this. - No. - Charlotte. - The baby's coming now. Oh, God. Okay. Easy, easy. It's almost 11. Do you think they gave up on us? - No, I don't think so. - All right, what do we have? We got big problems, a little time and a little magic. Didn't Eva say something about Charlotte giving birth - in a protective circle? - Can we make one of those? I don't know, we've got lavender and... Isn't rosemary supposed to be good for protection? Apples and laurel leaves block the path of evil. Put it all together, it may just work. - Who's gonna deliver the baby? - Personally, I think you should, considering we know you're gonna have one in the future. - I second that. - Wait a minute. - Go. - I always get the messy jobs. All right, if ever there was a time that we were going to connect, it needs to be now. So, Phoebe, form a circle, I'll work on the apples. Over here. Okay, you're gonna have to try and be kind of quiet. Okay, I know, I'm sorry. Okay. Don't worry. Everything's under control. Oh, my God. I see it. I see it. - Really? - Phoebe, the circle. - The circle. - Okay. Just... Just try not to push, okay. - This baby is coming. - Yeah, well, so are they. Okay, we can do this. - Yes, we can do this. - We have to do this. All right, here. Knowledge and reverence. Knowledge and reverence Knowledge and reverence Knowledge and reverence - What are you doing? - Seeing what they've learned. - Here they come. - Prue. All right. Put it all together, it's gonna work. Come on. They've connected. - It's over. - No, not yet. How cool is that? It actually worked. - Or not. - It doesn't stop bullets. We are running out of ammo. Prue, it's not like an apple is gonna stop them anyway. It's a girl. Piper, get Charlotte and the baby out of here. Okay, I think I have an idea of what might really scare them. What are you gonna do? I'm going to embrace the cliché. There is something you don't see every day. - A flying witch! - Their power is great! Gotta give them credit. They're awfully good. It's all right. Time's on my side. Blessed be. - Isn't the future beautiful? - It is, thanks to you. You found the power. You showed us where to look. Yeah, I guess we now know where all that flying hag stuff started. You only have yourself to blame, right, Pheebs? I know it and I love it. Now if I could just figure out how to take it back with me. Hey, what are they waiting for? Why haven't they sent us home yet? Maybe we haven't learned everything that we're supposed to yet. Well, it's almost midnight, so if we're gonna learn anything more, we better hurry. I promise my daughter will know of you. Of the three powerful witches who came to bring her into this world. And we'll always be grateful. Won't we, Melinda? Melinda? Yes, Melinda. Melinda Warren. What is it? I... I think we're related. I told you they'd come. Hey. Hey, haven't I vanquished you somewhere before? Are you guys all right? Are we all right? Are you all right? - It's been a long day. - Yeah, tell us about it. - Darryl? - Prue? I got it. Okay, open your eyes. Happy Halloween. Use that broom with reverence. Hey, Halloween is now officially my favourite holiday. - Who knew? - We didn't. But we should have. So much knowledge, so much power that we lost. But we'll get it back. Okay, well, one crash course at a time. Yeah. It's too bad Darryl didn't feel up to celebrating with us. He saw a lot today. I think he needs some time to sort it all out. Yeah, well, so do we. I mean, it's bad enough that the Triad wants us dead, but to send someone back to wipe out our whole line? Do your bosses have any clue who it is? None that they're sharing. I think it was that guy who was hitting on Phoebe at the party. Hang on. Not every guy I meet wants to kill me. Maybe he just liked me. Well, you saved Melinda. And that's all that matters. And I helped to deliver our great, great, great-whatever. Great-grandmother. Too bad we couldn't save her from moving from Virginia to Salem. That would've been nice. Yeah, well, you can't change history, for better or worse. Excuse me. - Hi. - Micah? Mitch, actually. Forgive my directness, but I've been watching you from across the room. Have we met? You know, that's funny, I was gonna ask you the same thing. My turn. - Hey. - Hey. I was beginning to think I got stood up. Yeah, sorry. Work, you know. I guess I just lost track of time. That's okay. I got kind of hung up myself. So you're an angel. This?
