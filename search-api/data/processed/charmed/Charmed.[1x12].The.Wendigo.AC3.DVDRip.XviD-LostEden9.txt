It's not like I've ever got a flat tire before. This doesn't happen to me every day. Piper, relax. I used to date a mechanic, I will walk you through it. Okay, you put the jack under the jeep and then put the handle in the base and ratchet it up and down, okay? It's very easy. Handle. Handle. I don't think I got a handle. Wait, there's a long wooden spoon in the back. That's not gonna work. She's looking for a long wooden spoon. Our table's ready. Okay. Okay. - It didn't work. - Stay there and we'll come get you. No, I can do it. I can figure it out. Piper, you're stranded and you're all alone, and the only thing you have to protect yourself with is a wooden spoon that's broken. And I have the power to freeze. I'm fine. It's better than Mace. Okay, I gotta go before my battery dies. I gotta call the Auto Club. - I'll meet you there in a little bit. - Piper, wait. Hello?</i> She is out of her mind. All right, we'll give her 15 minutes and call back. Okay. Directory assistance. What city please?</i> San Francisco. Auto Club, please. So back to what we were talking about. What do you think? - Well, I think it's a good idea. - Great. - And I think it's a bad idea. - How? How is it a bad idea? You need extra help for the auction, and I need a job. Well, not only are we family, but we live together. And I don't think that my wardrobe can take the assault of your daily needs. Okay, I'm great with phones, better with people and very computer-friendly. And with a paycheck, I could purchase new clothes. So by hiring me, you'd actually be expanding your wardrobe, not decreasing it. And I'd be eternally grateful. You really want to work at Buckland's with me? When opportunity knocks, I answer the door. The job is very demanding. Auctions can be stressful. - I love a challenge. - We work pretty long hours. Overtime is my friend. Plus, I just thought of something else. With my premonitions, I might just be able to get you the straight dope without a trip to the office water cooler. Don't push it. Right. So, what do you think? Can you start tomorrow? Yes. Hey, can you give me a ride? Hello? Oh, great. No problem, for I bear the power of one. Everything's gonna be okay. - Piper Halliwell? - Prue. Phoebe. - Andy, thanks for calling us. - Please, she's like my sister too. She's in here. Oh, my God, that's a lot of blood. - Hey, sweetie. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. If I pass out and I need a transfusion, I'm AB negative. It's very rare. It could be a problem. Try not to look at it. And just so you know, I'm AB neg. Too. Plus, I love good food. Perfect donor. - So no stitches? - No. It's not that deep. Follow up with your doctor in the morning, though. Keep it dry, a little aspirin for the pain. You'll be fine. - Easy for you to say. - You're all set. Just sign this. Oh, I got it. Come here, baby. I don't understand. Why didn't you just freeze him? I was trapped in a phone booth. My power doesn't work - outside the room I'm in, remember? - Oh, right. - Oh, my God, Billy. - How are you? Billy. This is Billy. He saved my life. - I'm just glad I got there in time. - I'd like to talk to you about that. Along with that flare gun you just happened to show up with. I don't think that you can smoke in here. Oh, right. Look, it's no coincidence I was there, inspector. I heard about the murder last night. The creature... - The creature? - Yeah, that's right. - Yes, creature. Absolutely. - Describe it. - Billy, what are you doing here? - Same thing you are. - Hunting that thing. - Piper, Prue, Phoebe Halliwell, Special Agent Fallon of the FBI. - FBI. Cool. - Describe it. Okay. Big, scary, strong, kind of like a cross between a werewolf and Charles Manson. - Yellow eyes? - Yes. Talon-like hands? Can I talk to you, inspector? Ms Halliwell's the first one to survive an attack. Unlike that poor guy we found last night with his heart ripped out. Just like the killings in Chicago and New Orleans. - I've sent for the coroner's reports. - Why? I think it's pretty obvious this case is out of your jurisdiction, inspector. - On the bright side, you don't want it. - Why's that? This witness corroborates every other statement. According to their descriptions, this perp's not either animal or human. You didn't blink. I was expecting a response. - Just tell me what I'm looking for. - You believe them? - That it's not human? - Let's just say recent experiences have taught me to keep an open mind. Cosy, aren't they? So, Billy, how did you know to use a flare gun? - It's afraid of fire. - How did you figure that out? Because when it attacked us, me and my fiancée, Laura, we were camping by Lake Michigan and I grabbed a log from the fire, it freaked, took off. But... ...not before it ripped Laura's heart out. Might as well have taken mine too. I came here to kill it. If that thing last night isn't demonic, I don't know what is. Yeah, well, it's not your fight, Piper. Just let Andy and that FBI agent handle it. Okay? Can't. That thing tried to kill me. Besides, I was meant to be involved. I know that. It's no coincidence I got that flat. - Nice outfit. - Very corporate. Yeah, well I have to try to impress my new boss. - Hey, how's the arm? - Itches. Piper, you have got to go to the doctor, okay? It could be infected. - It's not. It's fine. - Here. Listen, you, while we're at work... Whoa, head rush. "While we're at work." Don't even think about going after that thing alone. Wait, there's no reason to go after it at all. - The only innocent to protect is Piper. - I thought I was gonna die last night. I was totally helpless. All I could think about was I was never gonna see you guys again. And then suddenly, out of nowhere, comes Billy. Saved me. Protected me. That thing took away the person he loved, and he's out there all alone trying to kill it. I can't just do nothing. Just don't do anything unless we're together, okay? Promise? - Meet you outside. - I'll be right there. Okay. - Okay, I'm freaking. I'm freaking. - Why? Because I convinced Prue to hire me, and what if I disappoint her? Or what if I screw up and make her look bad? There's a reason my résumé is only three sentences long, Piper. Stop. You're one of the smartest people I know. I'm sure you'll do great. - You really mean that? - Yes, I do. That makes me feel so much better. Thank you. Lot number 102, one lamp. Estimated value, $2500. What, it doesn't need light bulbs? - It's a Stickley, an original. - Ah, right, a Stickley. I still can't believe none of this stuff belongs to anyone. Yeah, well every year, the city auctions off unclaimed probate items, asset seizures for revenue. What about the stuff that doesn't sell? It gets tossed. What is lot 103? 103, gold bracelet. Estimated value, $375. I will take that if no one wants it. Note that it's inscribed with the initials T and L. All right, that finishes the first grouping. I'm gonna go upstairs to Appraisals and make sure we didn't forget anything. - Meet you back at my office? - Your mid-morning coffee will be ready and waiting. I think this is really gonna work with you and me. Me too. - Prue. - Yeah? I just had a vision of the past. It was a terrible car accident. - And this bracelet... - What about it? It was thrown free. Oh, man. I bet I'm supposed to figure out who it belongs to. Oh, no, no, no. Not now. - I can't help it. - Prue? Just wanted to make sure everything's in order for today's auction. Wait, the auction is today? Yes, Claire, everything's in order. Terrific. I'll see you later then. Ooh, nice. That should sell quickly. What are we gonna do? It's called a what? A Wendigo. Apparently, it looks like a normal person during the day, but then transforms at night. It survives by feeding on human hearts. What? According to my information, the first Wendigo was a mortal who, betrayed by his lover, cut out her heart and ate it. As soon as he did, his own heart turned to ice and that's how he became this monster. So, what, it, like... It takes love away from others, is that it? Or... Then why did it go after you? Are you... in love? No. Unfortunately, no It must be attracted to something else. Like... maybe beauty? I'm sorry. It's just... ...you remind me a lot of my fiancée. Anyway, from what I gather, it strikes during the three phases of the full moon. Which means it may try again tonight. That's what it did before. Amazing, you know I've been tracking this thing for two months, and in one night you're a Ph.D. In Wendigo. Yeah. Well, read more about it. I should call Andy. I mean, Inspector Trudeau and tell him this. No. Agent Fallon's better. She's been so great to me ever since Laura... And she's already a believer. I'll tell her, okay? - Dizzy. - You okay? Must have stood up too fast. Will you call me after you see her? Please? Sure. I can help, Billy. I can't tell you exactly how or why, but I just want you to know I can. You're not in this alone. I know. - Quake. - Piper, it's Andy. Checking in to see how you're doing. Oh, Andy, that's sweet. I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. Yeah, well, you should be at home relaxing. I'm okay. Listen, Billy Waters just left. He's on his way to the Federal Building to see Agent Fallon. He has a theory on the attacks. I'll let her know. You rest up, okay? And stay out of dark, scary places for a while, will you? - Okay. - Take care. Billy's on his way over to your office. Has some information on the attacks. Really. I guess I'd better go. You seem pretty familiar with the witness. - Piper? Yeah, I dated her sister. - "Dated"? Past tense? - It's a long story. Why? - Just curious. Wouldn't want a lovesick cop on my hands. Especially if that's what the creature is after. What makes you think it is? You got a better explanation for why it rips the heart out of its victims? Maybe. I've just gone over the coroner's reports from Chicago, New Orleans, now local. Turns out all the victims were AB negative. Chosen by blood type, that's a new one. That, plus they're all killed in threes. The night before, the night after and the night of the full moon. Piper would've been the second, only she got away. Well, if you're right, that means the creature will try again tonight. I'm not altogether convinced it's a quote-unquote creature. The blood types, the full moon, the stolen hearts, that feels like ritual. And ritual is human. Could be just one sick mind behind these crimes. Maybe we'll have a chance to confirm your theory tonight. You and me, stakeout at the park. Interested? I'll bring my flare gun. Billy. Looking for me? Yeah. Listen, I think I know what that creature is. - Really? - Yeah. Piper was telling me about it. - It's called a Wendigo, and it feeds... - Hold on. Not here. The other agents already think I'm a little weird. Why don't I walk you to your car, and we'll talk on the way. It's like this Wendigo attacks people in love or at least people with good hearts. It's sort of like an anti-Cupid. How does it know that about its victims? I don't know. Instinct? Maybe it just senses something. Look, I know it can take on human form. Maybe it stalks them first. Anyway, I know it's gonna attack tonight. I know it. Probably in the same park just like the other cities. - Interesting. - Yeah. Well, we gotta get there, stake it out, we wait for it to show up, so then we can... ...kill it. Son of a bitch. Prue, check it out. I found out whose car went off the cliff. Franklin Bates. He worked for a big PI firm in San Jose. - How did you do that? - Easy. I recognised the road. Coast Highway by Carmel. I also recognised the car, '65 Lincoln. My first boyfriend, Jimmy, used to drive one just like it. Remember? Anyway, so I got on the Web and started snooping around, which means that I tied up your phone lines while you were at Appraisals. - Go on. - I searched the Chronicle's databases</i> for all articles on car accidents in the area, and voilà, there it was, February 1989. Unfortunately, it took me a while to access it and I sort of forgot to tell you that Claire was looking for you. - Phoebe. - I'm sorry. But here's the best part. I called the PI firm he worked for, lied to them, told them I was Andy's partner, and they told me what the initials on the bracelet stand for. The T is for "Teri," the L is for "Lane." - Should I know the name? - Teri Lane was a 5-year-old girl kidnapped by her father. It was the case the detective was working on when he died. - So... - So I think that that bracelet is proof that he found her. Maybe the mother never got it, because he died. Which means she never found her daughter. We can't sell that bracelet, Prue, not until we know for sure. So how am I supposed to explain this to Claire. What, psychic provenance? Psychic what? - Claire, hi. - I have been looking all over for this bracelet. What's it doing up here? - I had it cleaned. - Fine. I'll return it downstairs. I've already got two buyers interested. We cannot let her sell that bracelet, Prue. Piper. - Are you the manager? - Yes. Laurence Beck, Health Department. This is a code inspection. I'd like to start with the kitchen. The counters are scrubbed every 15 minutes. The dishes are washed at 150 degrees Fahrenheit with antibacterial dergent... Detergent. - Are you ill? - No. No, I just... I don't know. Feel free to have a look around. We have nothing to hide here at Quake. Thanks. Excuse me, what are you doing with that meat? Dying. Oh, right. Chuck that. You're obviously sick. I think you'd better go home, miss, before I shut this restaurant down. - Andy. - What happened? I don't know. I came here to meet him and found him there. - How did he die? - Coroner hasn't said, but it's definitely a homicide. Although, there's no mutilation, no other visible wounds. Doesn't fit our MO. I suppose it could be random. Chases off a crazed killer last night, then succumbs to a mugging today? I don't buy it. Maybe the creature, or whatever it is, found out Billy had some information on it. Got to him before he could get to me. He had been stalking him for two months. Could be the killer knew. Still, if these are ritual murders as you suggest, all the steps have to be followed or the killer doesn't get his happy feeling. So why is the heart still intact? Two possibilities. He's not AB negative, or it was trying to protect itself from being found out. I'd go with that theory, personally. Me too. Let's go talk to Piper, see if he told her what he wanted to tell you. You read my mind, inspector. And I have $400 now. 450. 450. 500. 550. 600. 650. That's 650. $700 now. 750, up front. That's 750 now. Say eight. $800. The gentleman's bid at 800. Anymore at $800? Sold. $800. Number 143, for the Karastan rug. And the next item is lot 102, a Stickley lamp. And bidding will begin at $2000. Now say 21. $2300. 2400. $2700. Now 2700. - Prue, guess what. - Where've you been? - The auction's already started. - I think I found the little girl, Teri Lane. - I think she's living in Oakland. - Sold. $2900. I contacted the detective's old secretary. She helped me piece it together. She also told me that it was the little girl's mother who hired him, because the father had abducted Teri. And next is lot 103, a gold charm bracelet. - Bidding will begin at $375. - Prue, you've gotta do something. That bracelet might be the only way to convince the mother - we know where the girl is. - What am I to do? $375 dollars for it now. 375. $375. 375. Anyone at $375? $375. Anyone at 375? At $375 now. Anyone at 375? - Anyone at $375? - Go, girl. Very well, $300 then. Anyone at 300? Three hundred dollars then. Last call at 300. Anyone at $300? Very well, we'll move on to lot 104, the pewter flagon. - Thank you, thank you. - You just better be right. At $150 now. 150. 175. - Hi, Andy. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Wanted to see how you're feeling. I feel great. Hey, where's your bandage? How did your wound heal? - Who is it? - It's Andy. - Andy. Go away! - Sorry? - You can't come in. I've got the flu. - It's okay. I had a flu shot. I gotta talk to you. It's about Billy. - He's been killed. - What? That's not possible. He should've been safe, it's not even night. It might not have been whoever attacked you. - Who else could it have been? - Sorry, had to make a call. - Are you okay? - No, I don't feel so well. Maybe we should come back later. Just a few questions, if you don't mind. We were wondering if you knew what exactly Billy was coming to tell me. Just that the creature is called a Wendigo. And that it attacks during the full moon. Yeah, we know that. He also said that it looks like a normal person during the day. Really? That's new. Did he have any idea who it might be? - I don't think so. - Too bad. How's the arm? It's fine. Well, it hurts like hell. May I? You're the only one to survive one of these attacks. Hope you didn't get infected by it. If you think of anything, anything at all, call me directly. Try and get some sleep. I will. Thanks. Yes? - Are you Harriet Lane? - Who are you? We've never met. I work at an auction house. Actually, I just started today. My sister got me the job. Well, anyway, I sort of found something, and I was wondering if you might recognise it. - I've never seen it before. - Are you sure? Hi. I don't mean to intrude, and I know that this must be hard for you, but I know that you recognise this bracelet. It was your daughter's, wasn't it? Why are you asking me all these questions? Why are you doing this to me? Your daughter, what's her name? Teri. Teri Lane. Do you know where she is? Teri? Oh, my goodness. - Teri. Teri, my baby. - Mama. Oh, Teri, Teri, Teri. I never thought I'd see you again. - It's okay, mama. I'm home now. - Let me look at you. I guess that bracelet was worth more than I thought it was. Are you kidding? It's priceless. Thank God for my powers. It wasn't just your powers that did that, Pheebs. Hello? Piper, you sound terrible. What's wrong? Sure hope Piper's gonna be okay. She didn't look very well. I know. Both Piper and the first victim were attacked at the far end of those trees. Must have hidden in that stretch of woods, waited to attack. Want to get a closer look? Absolutely. You better turn your cell phone off too. Wouldn't want it to ring and scare it away. This is a nice spot. How did you find this place? You and Piper's sister spend some time here? No, Prue runs more to the highbrow. Her loss. I take it you're not married. Do you see a ring on my finger? I was engaged once. He was my world. Totally my world. Then one day, boom, the empty dresser. The one-word note, "Sorry." I started falling. I kept falling. - Yeah, I know how that is. - No, you don't. But I took steps. I did what I needed to make myself strong. To make it so no one could ever hurt me like that again. Love to know how you do that. Maybe I'll show you, if you're lucky. But now my life's a lot less complicated. All I'm interested in is sex. Does that shock you? No. Just wondering where you were when I was in college, that's all. Piper? Piper. I'm miserable. - It's okay, honey. It's okay. - No. No, it's not. Prue. - Okay, can you get up? - Back off! What do you think, I can't walk now? - Honey, we're just trying to help you. - Help me? You can't even hold a job. - Okay, now wait a minute, Piper. - Oh, save it. Do you always have to be in charge? I'm so sorry. What's happening to me? It's all right. Okay, we're gonna take care of you. - What? - What? I just saw who the Wendigo is. Agent Fallon. - Her? I thought it had to be a him. - I guess not. And even worse, I saw her and Andy at the park at night. Alone. Okay, I'm gonna call him and warn him. You go upstairs to the Book of Shadows and see if you can find a way to help Piper.</i> Okay. Nothing. This is just the same crap I've already seen. I tried Andy's cell phone, no answer. We can't find anything about reversing the Wendigo thing. Well, there's got to be something. Oh, didn't you check this at the bottom of the page? "c.f. Desiderata." Yeah, like we're supposed to know what that means. Well, it means "conferred desiderata." It's Latin for "look up things that are yearned for." Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're so very smart. - Piper. - Don't Piper me. Just shut up! No. You are going to listen to me. This is not you. All right, it's the blood of the Wendigo, and you have to fight it. It's so strong. You're stronger. Fight it, Piper. I'm okay. All right. "Things that are yearned for... Wisdom, balance, unbecoming." That's got to be it. All right, unbecoming a Wendigo. So we have to kill the Wendigo that slashed you by melting its heart of ice. - What if you can't find her? - We'll find her. She's gonna be in the park tonight. But what if you're wrong? What if you don't? Then you'll have to... - Then you'll have to kill me. - Don't be ridiculous. We won't kill you. We're gonna kill the thing that did this to you. But we might have to confine you until we get back. - So tie you down, I guess. - No! Go to hell! Do we have any chains? - I actually do think I have something. - Okay. - Are you back? - I don't want this to happen to me. Kill Ashley. This is me talking. Okay. Here. Where did you get the...? - Never mind. - Let's just do this. All right. Over here. We still need to take a trip to the Army Navy Store. - Why? - To get a flare gun. Screw you, bitch! - Okay, I think we need to hurry. - Yeah, just hang in there, Piper. What's the matter? I was just thinking how I'm probably not the best cop to be on this stakeout with, seeing as how I'm AB negative. Don't worry. I'll protect you. - Andy, doing okay? - Little on edge. Instinct of the hunt. That's why you're here. That's why you're a cop. Does this turn you on or something, Agent Fallon? Or something. Look, you're a gorgeous woman, but we're on this job together. Let's just leave it at that. Let's not. If the moon is over there, we should go that way. - I don't see Andy's car. - We'll find him. All right, let's hurry. Andy? Andy! This is definitely the place, I recognise it from my premonition. Oh, God. Okay, give me another one. If that didn't get Andy to come out, he's dead already. He's dead when we find a body, not before. - Okay, how many more do we have? - Two. - Two? - That's all they had. Wait. I think that's him. Oh, God. All right, he's alive, but she slashed him. - He still has his heart? - We must have driven her off in time. Last one. My turn. This time we don't fire until I see slobber on its face. Okay. It's over there. No, wait. I think it's over here. No, no, no, it's right here. Wait, how can it be in two places at once? It can't. One of them is Piper. - Shoot. - I can't, Prue. Just shoot and pray you hit the right one. Wait, Piper froze it. Do something. Do it! - Are you okay? - I think so, but I'm naked and freezing. Andy. - Are you okay? - What happened? Prue, what are you doing here? Where's the Wendigo? She's gone. Easy. Lie back down. Just lie back down. It's all right. I'll explain everything later. On the house, for saving my hide. Literally, you Wendigo, you. Yeah, are you okay to work? Yeah, I'm fine. It's like nothing ever happened. Except for Billy. There was no way that you could've known about Agent Fallon. I know. It's just I'm not used to losing an innocent we're supposed to protect. He wanted to help stop her so she couldn't hurt anybody else. And that's exactly what he did. I'm just grateful that you're safe. And Andy. By the way, what did you tell him about why we were all there? - I told him the truth. - Get out. I did. I said that what he saw happened was true. That Agent Fallon really was the Wendigo. And that had we not vanquished her, that both he and Piper would've been killed. I couldn't think of anything else to say. Well, what did he say? Not much. He was either too stunned to speak, or he actually believed me on some level. It was the closest that we've ever come to having an honest conversation. So maybe Andy's more open to your being a witch than you think. All right, back to work? Actually, I need to talk to you about something. And please don't be mad, - but I quit. - What? It's not that I don't appreciate the opportunity, because I do. It's just that every time I touch something at Buckland's, I risk having a premonition, and it's just too emotional for me. Besides, that's your world. I need to find one of my own. You will.
