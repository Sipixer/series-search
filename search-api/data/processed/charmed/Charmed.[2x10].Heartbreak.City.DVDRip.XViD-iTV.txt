- Hi. Working late, huh? - Yeah. So, what else is new, right? - Yeah. It's a match. You guys survive Y2K all right? Sure. If you ask me, it was all just a bunch of hype. Definitely. - Well, I guess I'll see you around? - Yeah, okay. - Take care. - Yeah. You too. Cindy, I know those last few loves of yours didn't work out. You've been hurt, and you're scared. But you gotta take a risk if you want to find the real thing. And Max is real. Open up to him. And Max, Cindy's love and compassion awaits your discovery, but she's afraid that you're still in love with your ex-wife. You've got to reassure her. Life is short, you two, so... Have a better one together, okay? Listen, you wanna grab a cup of coffee or something? Coffee? Yeah, sure. - I'd like that. - Great. Hello, old friend. I've been looking everywhere for you. Drazi. - You knew I'd find you. - Listen, Drazi... You couldn't leave it alone. You just had to get involved. You crossed the line. "Crossed the line"? I am the line. You're the one that went too far. - Now you're gonna pay. - No, wait. Not very pleasant. You're killing me. I'm gonna do more than that, a lot more. How does it feel, huh? I can tell you. I know. Thanks to you, I know what it feels like to have your heart ripped out. Do you wanna know that kind of pain, do you? No. I got a better idea. You're gonna just hate it. Your little magic ring you use to slip in there between the heartbeats, plant your little thoughts of love. Well, I'm gonna borrow it. I'm gonna use it to tear apart some of your more recent unions. No. Drazi, no. I'm gonna turn love into hate. And that hate is gonna slowly and very painfully kill you. And in the end, you're gonna wish that I had ripped your heart out. Drazi! Fifth wheel, cutting in. - Oh, would you stop that. - Well, it is a double date. It would have been a triple date if Kevin hadn't cancelled. I know. It seems to be an epidemic lately, guys cancelling on me. You know what happens when they cancel. - Back to square one. - Do not pass go. And all accrued nookie credits are thrown out. - There's a penalty? - Oh, yeah. You know, this glimpse at the feminine mystery frightens me to no end, so allow me to change the subject. - What did you think of the movie? - I liked it. - Loved it, except for the bell-bottoms. - It was okay, I guess. Oh, who are you kidding? I heard you sniffle. - I'm fighting a cold. - Liar. Jack? As far as classics go, it was no Dirty Dozen. I slept through it. - You slept through Dirty Dozen? - No, Love Story. The last thing I remember is a hockey game. - That was the very beginning. - Okay, let me guess. Boy meets girl, Grim Reaper swipes girl and boy is left with his hockey skates? That's a review. Anybody want a coffee? I hope so, because I am buying. So difficult. What? Hey, you're coming to get coffee, right? I'm just gonna get a cab, call it a night. I'm pooped. - I'm sorry that Kevin backed on you. - It's his loss. It is so his loss, because you are beautiful, my sister. You're so beautiful. All right, go to your man, have some coffee. - Okay. I love you. - I love you too. Bye-bye. - I need your help. - Let go of me. Hate will destroy everything if you don't help. - I am warning you, buddy. - Phoebe, you gotta believe me. - I know why you can't find love. I'm... - Hey, you. Let go of her. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - What was that about? - I'm not sure. Piper, are you still asleep? Hey, Prue, guess who got lucky last night. I'll get it. - I will get it. Hello? - Morning. Hey, Prue. Did that coffee keep someone up all night? Okay, believe it or not, all we did was talk. - Yeah, right. - No, I swear. Look, we just talked about everything. It was really great. Really? How did he react to the witch part? Cute. All right, where's Piper? Oh, she's still at Dan's. Hey, if only I'd bagged Mr. Creepy, we could have scored a Halliwell hat trick last night. - Don't be mad. - No, I'm not mad. I'm thrilled, for you both. I mean, it's been a long time. You deserve to be happy. You're gonna need a new lock on that back door. Phoebe? All right, I'm getting rather used to you kicking love in the teeth. Okay. Who are you, and what do you want? More importantly, I know who you are, Phoebe. And that's why I'm here. I need your help. - Charmed Ones kind of help. - I will ask again, who are you? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. - Well, for lack of a better name, I'm... ...Cupid. Oh, my. Eggs over, bacon crisp, box of jewellery and dry toast. A box of what? Do you want a morning paper with that? - What did you do? - It's not a big deal. It's not a ring. But I don't want you to feel like you gotta keep it. - If you wanna take it back, you can... - I get it, I get it. You gonna open it? Because if you want to, you can take it back. Hey, is something...? Phoebe, what are you doing in here? How did you get in here? We have got a very big problem. Piper, Cupid. Cupid, Piper. Hi, sorry to interrupt. Glad things are working with you and Dan. - What? - You have to come home really fast. Yeah, a demon of hate stole my ring, and he'll use it to find loves that I put together so he can destroy them, which will in turn destroy me. - Wait. - He's telling the truth. The demon's name is Drazi. He's in the Book of Shadows. Phoebe's working on the potion that'll vanquish him. - And Prue is on her way home. - Home from where? From Jack's. Okay, hurry, okay? Kiss very fast. Okay. Okey-dokey. ...the matter? - Yes, there is. But not with you. There is absolutely nothing the matter with you. But I do have to go. Hold on. What happened? I don't understand. It has nothing to do with you, I swear. Then what does it have to do with? It's complicated. But thank you for this, and you'll see it on me tonight at the club. Hello, young lovers. So we're actually supposed to believe that you're Cupid? So you guys can believe in warlocks and demons, but you can't believe in me? - Where's the chubby baby? - Guys. - And the bow and arrow? - Where's the warty chins, hooked noses and pointy hats? All right, show us something supernatural. Drazi took my ring. It's my power, it's how I get in. - Get in? - People's hearts, to awaken love. See, but Drazi is all about hate. And he's gonna use the ring to get in the same way. We're wasting time. You're still gonna have to back up the Cupid claim. Okay, fine. Dan, Jack, Clay. Andy, my sincerest condolences. Eric in London, Alan in college. Not Jeremy the warlock. Joe in college, Barry in high school, Tim in eighth grade. Ken, Kyle, Steve, Mike, Ken again. Brian, Joel, Martin, Peter, Paul. Tony. Okay, you know I didn't love all those guys, right? Yeah, well, they wanted to love you, but your closed heart eventually sent them away. My closed heart? I do not have a closed heart. Look, if people get the feeling that there's nothing there, eventually it's hasta la vista, Phoebe. That explains the recent rash of cancelled dates. Okay, so wait, our past relationships, you made those happen? Well, actually, my assignment here is only two years old. I helped you two meet Jack and Dan, but most of your prior loves were the work of fellow agents. - Agents? - Oh, yeah. I'm just one of many. We work in secret all over the world, making connections. Did you connect me and Leo? No, that was the work of you two. Those connections we're forbidden to make, for obvious reasons. Can we go back to the hasta la vista remark, please? We don't have time right now to debate the topic of your closed heart, Phoebe. We gotta finish the potion so we can vanquish Drazi before it's too late. Okay, how are we supposed to find him? The same way he can find me. We can sense each other. We're connected in a cosmic way. There's a fine line between love and hate. - Oh, brother. - Hey, don't take Drazi lightly. You guys are in danger as well. We're in danger every day. We're used to it. Not like this. Look, if Drazi succeeds, eventually he'll kill your ability to love. And believe me, that's a fate worse than death. - Okay. - Thank you very much. Sorry, they didn't have any roses. You're too good to be true. I still can't believe this is all happening. Believe it. Touching. Really touching. Cindy, could you be a bigger fool. He's still sleeping with his ex-wife. He looks at you as a desperate, lonely woman. Easy sex. Max, she's nothing but a gold-digging tramp who wants to hitch her wagon to your big fat wallet. Just as soon marry you and kill you for the insurance. Bye-bye. - You pathetic... - Bitch. Take your damn flowers. Give them to your ex-wife. The bank's closing, baby. You're not laying one finger on this guy's money. - Screw you. - Up yours. Prue, Phoebe. - What's the matter? - I don't know. - What's wrong? - It's Drazi. He's killing... ...love. Yes, ma'am, go ahead. He just walked into traffic. - Dumb-ass. - Oh, yeah? - Is he gonna die? - I can't answer that, ma'am. Because he should, you know. I don't think I've ever known anyone who deserved to be hit by a car more than that guy. It's Max. Is he one of yours? Yeah, I matched him up with Cindy last night. - She was afraid to risk love too. - Are you picking on me? - Phoebe, I'm... - Do you think it's easy finding love with all the demon-hunting we have to do? Your sisters aren't having a problem. You know what, let's just stay focused. We have things to do. - Are you sure Drazi did this? - I'm positive. He's still here too. I can feel him. - He's close. - Where? There. Do you think he knows who we are? - Apparently. - He's getting away. - Do you have the potion? - Yes. All right, let's go. - We're not gonna catch him. - Piper, freeze him. - He's too far away. - Hit him with the trolley! - I can't move the trolley. - Somebody better do something fast. - What? - Surprise. That didn't work. - Are you back with us? - I think so. I really gotta get a handle on that. - I don't understand. - She astral-projected. - Did you get him? - No, I just slowed him down a bit. You guys, I'm fine. Go get him. Hurry. God, I love this new power. Hiding behind witches' skirts? Stealing things that don't belong to you? Okay, go. What the...? No. No! - Did you get him? - Did we? Sure looks like it, but I don't know what happened to my ring. Shouldn't have been affected by what we did to Drazi. So that's it, right? You're done, you can just move on? In a hurry to get rid of me, Phoebe? Look, Cupid, I know you're just trying to help, but did you ever think that maybe I'm just - not ready for love right now? - No, you're more than ready. - You know what? Don't start. Just go. - I need the ring to get back. I mean, they'll issue me another one. But the problem is - I need it to get back to them. - Wait, you're stuck here? No, actually, you can help get me back home. One more potion, some well-chosen words from the Charmed Ones, and I'm on my way. - Care to help me with that potion? - Me? Why me? Because you're free tonight and they have dates. Hey, how did you know...? Never mind. Scratch that. - What are you smiling at? - You. Well, looks like you can't kill love after all. But you sure can screw with it. Very nice. Do you like it? I love it. Well, thank your sister. She helped me pick it out. - Okay, guilty. - Well, thank you both. And I'll thank you again later. If that's all it takes, where can I buy one? Okay. You know what, why don't we find a table and get some food. So this will send you back? I drink this, you and your sisters say the magic words, and I'm gone. I cannot believe that I'm stuck here doing the grunt work - while they're... - Twisting the night away? - Don't blame them. - No, I'm not blaming anybody. - It's just, I'm here. - Stuck with me. I'm sorry, but did you do something specific to tick Drazi off, or did he also find your honesty to be a complete and total pain in the ass? Drazi fell in love with a mortal woman. I redirected her love towards a mortal man, away from Drazi. She's married now, very happy. But Drazi blames me for denying him love. A hundred slow strokes there. So are you telling me that demons love? Frighteningly so. Love of evil, love of fear. Sometimes a love of the very things they hate. In this case, a human being. You know, if a demon can open his heart, there's hope for you too, Phoebe. Okay, you know, my heart is not closed, okay? - It's open, just not to everybody. - Your heart is closed. I'm picky. - No, you're terrified. - Of what? What am I terrified of? I don't know, you tell me. I don't wanna play this game. Well, then at least stir correctly. Like that. So how does this work? It transports you. It's your travel potion with an aphrodisiac kicker. Really, an aphrodisiac? Lavender, oysters, rosemary and chocolate and your basic caris-root compound. But the key ingredient is desire. Desire? A desire to go home. Because home... Is where your heart is. Are you afraid of loss? You know, I swear, if you barf up "It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all," I might just have to... Smells really good. So tell me, what has not loving gotten you? It's kept me safe. Safe from what? From people leaving. Your mother? - Yeah. - And your father? And you. Are you falling for me? No, I am not falling for you, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, Phoebe Halliwell, running away from love. You're Cupid. Okay? You're the one that's leaving me. Look, Phoebe, what I am is the potential for true love, that's all. Because once you let love in, it'll never leave. Don't confuse the message with the messenger, Phoebe. It's what you've always done. See, messengers make mistakes. They get lost, they run away. They even die. But their message, "open your heart," it comes from life itself. Hear it. For my sake. And yours. Your having an in with the owners of one of the hottest clubs in town has its benefits. - Free chicken wings. - To name one. - And the pleasure of our company? - And to name two more. Thank you. Bathroom break, Piper? All right, yes, ma'am. See you boys in a minute. All right. Oh, my God, I have to pee. Okay. You're okay with that, aren't you? Okay with what? This. I mean, I don't really want you mad at me. Why would I be mad at you? Because I let Dan buy it for you. No, Prue, it's okay. It's great. Really. And you don't wish that it came from Leo? No. I don't, really. This feels strange. What do you mean? Well, I mean, we have these... ...guys out there waiting for us. Who care about us. Correct me if I'm wrong, but things are going pretty well right now, right? Yeah, nothing like a night out on the town after a hard day of demon-killing. Okay, I'm serious. I mean... You know... Think about it. I mean, we did great today. And now tonight, it's like we're just... Finding a balance in our lives? Exactly. I do feel pretty good. Yeah, I think we're gonna be okay. Except that there's still our little secret. Oh, Piper, everybody has secrets, including Jack and Dan. Yeah, well, unless they're transvestite Nazi war criminals with great face-lifts, then I think we've got them beat. Okay, so we're never gonna have normal lives. Not ever. But that doesn't mean that we can't try sometimes. With someone like Dan, perhaps? With whoever, sweet girl, I just want you loved. - Thanks. - You're welcome. About time. Dan, I will never understand the whole tandem pit stop thing that women do. Yeah. - Hey, Jack, speaking of mysteries... - Yeah. You know, Piper has this strange habit of sometimes just sort of... - Vanishing? - Yeah. Prue does it too. I figured that. Does it bug you? A little, but I'm not gonna give her the third degree about it. It's like time just stands still for a few seconds. And when it starts up again, she's like a total different person. - Ask her about it. - No, I have. - She gives me the run-around. - Then don't ask. Hey, guys, are Prue and Piper around? Yeah, they're in the ladies' room. - Thanks. - Excuse me, have we met? Yeah, you look really familiar. I've been around. Yeah. Okay, come on. And see, that's another thing. There's strange guys that always show up at their place. They pop in, they pop out. Who the hell are they? It sounds like someone's falling in love. Yeah, maybe. - Hey. - Hey yourself. Evening, ladies. I trust everything's going well. - Very well. - Prue? Well, it's a little early to tell, but all the signs are pointing to maybe. Did you get everything we need to send him home? Yeah. He drinks this while we say this, and he's gone. Any idea where you wanna do this? In there. Stockroom. Is this gonna take very long, because, you know...? Go tell your boys you'll be back in a few minutes. - Okay. - And don't dawdle. Ain't love grand? Welcome back. I was starting to get a little worried there. Dan, Piper still loves Leo. Always has, always will. You are nothing more than geographically desirable. After all, a girl can't get much closer than the stud next door. Jack, Jack, Jack. Does the term "transition man" mean anything to you? Well, it should, because Prue is using you. You are everything she always knew she never wanted. And now for you, Piper. What's the matter? I can't believe it. What, is it Drazi? He's alive. Why don't you just admit it. You're just using me to make Leo jealous. - Can you leave him out of this? - I'd love to. What about you? Rebound guy, is that it? What makes you think I'm gonna take this crap? You think I'm just gonna jump in the sack with you on the second date? - Why don't you just drop dead. - I can't believe you're threatened. You think I'm an idiot? You think I don't know? - All right, you guys... - Shut up! - It isn't over between you two, is it? - That's really none of your business. - Fine, why don't we just end it. - Fine. - We are dating, aren't we? - No, we're not. Not anymore. And you can have that back too. Fine. I'm sure Leo will replace it with something that means more anyway. - Probably. - I'm just glad that nothing happened. Yeah, well, you and me both. I'm really glad. I mean, I learned a valuable lesson. - Never go out with a jerk. - Thanks for the evening, Prue. - All right, bye-bye. - Wait, wait. It's not them, Phoebe, they're caught in Drazi's spell. - If he did this, why didn't you sense it? - Because I thought he was dead. You're still here? None of this would have happened if you would have just left us alone. Now, get out. Get out of my club! - Wait, where are you going? - There's nothing I can do. - They're trapped. - We are not trapped. For the first time in my life, I see things how they really are. Now, whoever you are, whatever you're selling, just get out. No, no. Don't. Listen to me. Okay, hi, hi. Look. You guys are under a spell. Okay, this is not you. Listen to me. If you're with him, why don't you go too. What? No. You guys. What...? We vanquished Drazi. How is this happening? - The ring must have saved him. - What, so he's invincible now? Maybe not. Maybe if destroying the loves that I put together is killing me, maybe the reverse is true. Patching things up between everybody just might kill him. But you can't do that without the ring. Well, I've got you. I'm sorry, what? Your heart's as big and as true as any I've ever seen, Phoebe. You'll be my ring. I'm... I'm flattered, I think. But I have no idea what you're talking about. You will. Come on, we've gotta start with the first couple Drazi tore apart. Okay. I cannot believe Jack. Who the hell does he think he is? Jack? What about Dan? We're out on a date and he accuses me of being in love with someone else. Totally out of line. - We're better off without them. - Well, certainly not worth crying over. I have never hated someone so much in my entire life. Me either. Although I have to admit, some of the things Dan said were kind of true. I do think about Leo sometimes. Jack wasn't wrong when he said I was on the rebound. Still, it's all so weird. I mean, one minute the four of us are laughing and having a great time. And the next, we're all acting like we hate each other. - What? - I was just thinking about Drazi. No way. He couldn't have had anything to do with this. We vanquished him. - Jack's scum. - So's Dan. - Are you scum? - No, I'm not scum. I knew you weren't. There she is. We gotta hurry. But wait, I'm still not exactly sure what the plan is. - It's simple. Just talk to her. - About what? She's just the same as you. Her fears are your fears. Just pretend you're talking to yourself. Here she comes. Cindy? Hi. - Do I know you? - No, but we know you. And we know about Max. - How is he? - I don't know. Look, I'm really sorry about what happened, and I'm not even sure how it happened. But I'm sorry. Hurry. Hurry. Cindy, Cindy. Look, look. Sooner or later, Max's pain will go away. But yours won't. - Excuse me? - I mean, it hasn't yet, has it? The pain of love lost deepens if you don't deal with it. Look, I know. I know what it's like, believe me. I closed myself off to love, too, because I was afraid. But you know what? Fear and love cannot live in the same house. You're getting to her. It's because the people that we love eventually leave us. So we've given up on love. - You mean love's given up on me. - No. It hasn't. It can't. Your fear of loss has left you paralysed. Believe me, I know. But you can change that. You can take the risk and love again. I mean, hey, they don't call it lover's leap for nothing, right? - What? - Actually, "lover's leap" was a reference to suicide, Phoebe. Let me rephrase that. Go to Max, push through whatever hate or fear or doubt that you think might exist between the both of you. Just tell him what's in your heart. - I love him. - Then tell him that. Now, before it's too late. Who are you? Messengers. Thank you. I'm starting to feel better already. - You were good. - I was good, wasn't I? Yes, ma'am. So why do I feel that was more for my sake than for Cindy's? Because in order to let love in, you have to overcome the obstacles within yourself. You know, we have to go reconnect Prue and Piper's love connection before it's too late. You know that the more couples we put back together, the more Drazi's gonna come looking for me, wherever I am. - Isn't that the plan? - Yeah. I just wanna make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. They didn't have any roses. Cindy. I am so sorry for whatever happened today. - I don't know what came over me. - It's okay. It doesn't matter. I didn't mean it either. None of it. - Really? - Really. Cupid. You think you can undo what I've done? You're dead. This better be good. Should I know what you're talking about? Don't buy the innocent act. She pulls it all the time. I beg your pardon? Just cut to the chase, Piper. Why did you call? - What? I didn't... - Prue, I wanna talk to you. Isn't this your number? "Come to my house, ASAP"? Oh, that's really pathetic, paging yourself. - Pathetic? - Prue. - I'm sorry, I meant moronic. - Why are you here? - You called. - Oh, you wish. - What is going on? - Hate. And it's gotta stop. I asked Jack and Dan to come over here. And what is he still doing here? Trying to help you. No reason to hang around here. Oh, on the contrary. Everyone on the couch. Now. - Just mind your own business. - Hey, don't talk to my sister like that. - Please. - Okay. Everyone on the couch, now. Come on. - Phoebe, I don't understand. - Okay, well, be quiet and you will. Sit. You don't look okay. Are you all right? - I'm having a rough day. - Though we can change that. You are all acting - like you're under some kind of spell. - Phoebe. Would you stop thinking and just feel? Look, I know that some ugly things were said tonight. - But you can get past that. - Assuming that we want to. Prue, I know you want to. Remember how you felt the first time you saw Jack? - How would you know? - I hated him. My point exactly. Opposites attract. But after a while, he started to make you smile, didn't he? He made you laugh. Look at him again. Remember that. And, Piper, I watch you when you talked to Dan. And I see light and warmth and hope. And I know you feel that way. You still feel that way. And, Dan, you don't need someone whispering in your ear, telling you not to trust Piper. Trust yourself. I'm not saying you have to tell me everything. But when you deliberately keep secrets from me... It's not because I want to. I told you, it just has nothing to do with you. But does it have anything to do with Leo? No. It has to do with you and me and what I would like us to become. It's working. - Where is he? - He's close. Okay. Okay. Here's the plan. Jack, Dan, go down to the corner market and get whatever you want. If the food of love is Cheetos and soda, then play on. And can you pick up a couple of frozen pizzas? So you want to talk? Yes. That's very good, Jack. Very good. You're quick. - I'll drive. - Yeah, okay. Take your time, don't hurry. Bye-bye. - Hey, what the hell is going on? - Okay. Think, you guys. Do you remember Drazi? He's still alive. And if Cupid's right, he's on his way here as we speak. Whatever bad feelings you've had for Dan and Jack, Drazi did it. He's twisted your relationships with hate. - So, what do we do now? - Exactly what you're doing right now. You let Dan and Jack back into your hearts. - Okay, hold up. I don't love Jack. - No, but you like him a lot. And it's helped to make you open to love. Hello, lover boy. I should have finished you off the first time. Okay, so much for loving him to death. What do we do with him now? - Same thing, only different. - Been there, blew that. Yeah, only difference is, the ring won't be protecting him, it will be protecting him. - How can you be sure? - I can't. But love is a risk. If he's taught me anything, it's that. No. No. No. Not again. Is he gone this time? - Yeah, he's definitely gone. - How do you know? Because I've never felt better. I knew you could do it. And now I have to go. - I know. - I won't be far. Don't mourn me, Phoebe. Remember me, celebrate me and seek me out. Now, that boy can kiss. You gotta remember, though, the mission was successful. Bronson made it home. - Just in time to make Death Wish. - Oh, no. You'll love it, I promise. Sorry, Phoebe. I almost forgot to get our parking validated. - No problem, Kevin. - Hey. You know, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry that I cancelled on you the other night. Love means never having to say you're sorry. What? It's nothing. We saw Love Story here the other night, and... - Never mind. - I love that movie. - Really? - Yeah. Me too. Now.
