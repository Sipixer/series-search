Can you do anything about this thunder? Because it's making me nuts! I have no sway over the weather. I do have a friend who works with wind, but she's out of town. What about demons? Any sway over them? Because I swear, if they don't shut up... I hate this stuff. It's for your own good. Well, whatever happened to regular old vitamins? There is nothing regular about your pregnancy. The new power you're experiencing is a mere shadow of what's to come. The tonic strengthens you to bear the weight of it. Okay. Well, then do me a favour. Find something that strengthens me and doesn't taste like crap. Are you feeling all right? Yeah, it's just... I have all this work that I have to do, and I can't concentrate! But you are queen now. There's no reason for you to continue with this work at all. I like my work. It's a good distraction. A distraction from what? Still struggling with your decision? No, I mean... I love Cole, and, you know, don't get me wrong, this whole queen thing is kind of fun. It's just... Your sisters. Yeah, I don't understand why they have to be so stubborn. Why they can't just respect my decision. Because it's not in the nature of good to compromise. They'll never understand. They'll only want to change you back. The sooner you accept that and let them go, the happier you will be. Here, drink your tonic. What the hell is going on out there? You know, ever since the coronation, all he does is work. The underworld's been in chaos for some time. - And he has a great task-- - I don't care. I want some attention from my husband. You're excused. Make certain you drink that upon waking. It is after midnight, Cole. Come to bed. Phoebe, please, we're in the middle of a ceremony. We're almost done. "Almost" doesn't work for me. I thought we talked about this. Sorry, it's hormones. Damn it, I have read through this 1 5 times. There's nothing even remotely helpful about how to save Phoebe. I told you, she made a choice. There's no magical cure for that. Yeah, well, she's pregnant, Piper, so she's being influenced by the baby inside. And we could have helped her overcome that, but she chose Cole. Will you just stop with the potions already? You've already overrun the kitchen. I'd say we have enough. This one duplicates my freezing power, plus it scalds the flesh, so we should only use it in a dire emergency. No. I will not scald Phoebe's flesh. She's still our sister. Paige. How is she? She's like Piper Light. All the personality without any of those messy emotions. We'll see. Rumour on the demonic grapevine is, their new queen is killing upper-level demons. - Word is, she killed two just last night. - What does that mean? It means it looks like Phoebe's working from the inside for the good guys. That's great. Since when do you guys believe rumours that are spread by demons? Alison Whitt. Among other things, she's spearheading the campaign to clean up Dolores Park. That's my district. I got men there too. - Since when? - Since I put them there. - Then they're working my territory. - Gentlemen. It's all my territory. Next. Gregory Conroy, a probation officer to juvenile offenders. Manages to rehabilitate the worst of the worst. He's cost us several potential demons. He's yours. He works at the-- Relax, boys. I'm here to cook, not kill. Although I'd keep your voices down if I were you. Hi, honey. Honey? Will your friends be staying for dinner? I'm gonna find it hard to convince them to stay unless you stop - threatening to kill them. - I was kidding. You killed five of my best demons this week, so forgive me if I'm missing the joke. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I know I've been working a lot. But that should lighten up soon. In the meantime, no more killing. Promise? Promise. It's hard enough for them to accept the fact that my queen is a former Charmed One. We don't want them to think you're playing both sides. I said, I promise. But if it will make you feel better... Hi. I just want to say that I'm really sorry for killing your friends last night. Oh, and the night before that. And it's nothing personal, you know. It's just... - Phoebe, was that a...? - Cramp. I just need to lay down. Should I call the Seer? No. No. I'm fine. Where were we? Gregory Conroy. Malek's in for the kill. He spends his time at the Mission Hill Community Centre. These are meant to slow an attacker down but not do real serious harm. It's kind of like magical Mace. Sounds reasonable, I guess. These are a little more lethal. Explosives, paralytics, your garden-variety poisons. So you're gonna poison Phoebe? Leo, she's carrying the spawn of The Source. She's throwing fire from her hands. If she shows up here, we'll do what we have to do to protect ourselves. You're not even giving her a chance. Paige, we gave her every chance in the world to come back to us. And she threw it in our faces. She chose The Source of All Evil over her own family. Surprise. Nice to see you too, Piper. What do you want? And here I thought you'd be happy to see me. I'm happy to see you. - Paige. - What? Unless you're here to tell us you filed for divorce, we don't really have much to talk about. Oh, that's not true. For instance, we could talk about how rigid you are. It's really not a very attractive quality. Wait. Phoebe, what are you doing here? I had a premonition. We have an innocent to save and not a lot of time. That is so great. Look, I told you. Don't get excited. It's not what you think. I haven't changed my mind. I'm not leaving Cole, and I'm not renouncing my crown. It's just, I've never ignored a premonition in my life, and I'm not about to start now. Phoebe, you're evil. You're, like, the queen of all evil. Literally. - That's beside the point. - How can that be besides the point? I say we do it. - What? - Excuse me. Look, this is what we've been hoping for: A sign that there's still good in her. Why else would she care about saving an innocent? Because it's a trap. Piper, this could be our only chance. I think Paige is right. Maybe by helping her do good, it might sway her back to our side. Fine. Okay, you're on. We'll follow you. What's that for? Insurance. Why do I always have to land in the mud? Come on, over here. How do you know when he's gonna get attacked? I know. There he is. Hey. - What are you doing? - Stop. My queen. Leave that innocent alone. Go. What? He's one of my subjects. How--? How could you do that? How could you just let him go? I don't know why you're so upset. We saved the innocent, didn't we? I can't talk to her. You talk to her. - Phoebe-- - Things are not as black-and-white as they used to be. Okay, I can't just go around killing demons anymore. Why not? We heard you just killed two last night. Yeah, well, that was different. He was getting on my nerves. I promised Cole I wouldn't kill anymore. And killing Malek would have been a huge betrayal. Malek? You're on a first-name basis with the demons? If you were gonna order him to stop, you could've done that on your own. - Why did you even come to us? - Because I missed you guys! Okay? Is that so wrong? I missed you. Well, Phoebe, you can't be the queen of the underworld and a Charmed One. You can't have it both ways. Why not? Just because it's different doesn't mean that it can't work. And you all miss me too, even though I'm sure Piper probably doesn't want to admit it to herself. - Of course we miss you, honey. - Well, you can have me back. You can have the power of three back. You just have to be willing to meet me halfway. Phoebe, you can't protect the innocent and save demons. It just doesn't work that way. Apparently, it does. He's alive, isn't he? Yeah, but your friend Malek is gonna come back. - You don't know that. - That's what they do Phoebe, they come back. They snarl and come back. Now we have to worry about protecting him instead of trying to save you. - You think I need saving? - Are you kidding me? That baby inside you has corrupted you more than you think. - Piper-- - Don't "Piper" me. This is insane. What you are saying is insane. You cannot come back. You cannot work with us as long as you are married - to The Source. - So, what do you want me to do? - You want me to leave my husband? - Yes. - That is not fair! - It's not fair, Phoebe, but you have to pick a side. Good or evil. That's how it works. Even though it means giving up someone you love, you have to choose. I'm really sorry you feel that way. I can't do this. What about Greg? Oh, no, not again. Did you guys see anybody take off on a chrome and orange bicycle? No, sorry. I don't even know why I bother to lock it. - What should we do? - Follow him. They were animal-sacrifice caverns. For the most part, they've been abandoned. Waste of space, don't you think? Put a team on it. Have it cleaned out-- My liege. - State your business. - I have news for The Source. It concerns his queen. - What happened? Is she hurt? - No. The Charmed Ones interfered with my kill. I have no control over my in-laws. If you want them out of the way, I suggest you take backup. I mean all three of them, including the queen. She ordered me not to harm the innocent. I thought you should know. Have you told anyone else? No. I came straight to you. Thank you... ...for your loyalty. - Am I next? - No, Dane. You... ...I trust. - It's just my damn wife. - With all due respect... ...I think you better take care of the innocent... ...before others hear of this. My liege. Get up. I have a job for you. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for membership. We are self-supporting through our own contribution. We do not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorse nor oppose-- So you really think Piper's okay? I don't know. I think it's good that she's feeling something again. Right. Right. You're right. She's probably fine. Is anyone celebrating 30 days today? So you think I just need to give her some space, right? You could try that, yeah. It's just when Piper lost Prue, she barely survived, and she thinks she's gonna lose Phoebe. She might just... Listen, just go talk to her, okay? Remind her that we have a demon to fight. And that will do her some good and take her mind off Phoebe. Right, right. - What about you? - Me? I'm fine. Listen, I don't think Malek's gonna attack in front of all these people. So just go get Piper and bring her back before the meeting's over. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. Let me start by... First, let me start by congratulating the chip-takers. - Where's the real column? - Excuse me? This is cute, very clever, and I appreciate the evening chuckle, but I need to see the real pages. Are you calling my writing a joke? "Dear Betrayed, I suggest you beat your cheating husband with his secretary's stapler. Then he'll think twice before bending her over her desk again." Well, might be a little harsh, but I think it makes a point. What it makes is a lawsuit. So unless you're looking to lose your job... Are you threatening me? I am telling you to get a shrink if you have to, but get it together. Rewrite that column and do it fast. Excuse me. If you wanna kill your boss, we have people who can take care of that for you. Aren't you sweet. Truth is... ...she's right. My advice was a little off this week. I don't understand what you're doing here. - You're queen. - And you're cranky. I told you I'm not quitting my job. And what about your other job, you gonna keep that too? And what job would that be, Cole? The Charmed One. Malek told me what you did. So what? I let him go. - That doesn't make it okay! - Keep your voice down. This is where I work. You can't save an innocent and free a demon, Phoebe. It doesn't work like that. - You sound like Piper. - Well, Piper's right. You made a choice when you stood by me at the coronation. If you're questioning that choice now, if you're not sure you wanna be with me, you need to let me know. Of course I wanna be with you. I just don't understand - why you have to be so rigid. - Because I am The Source! Because you are my queen! Because there are expectations! Do you think I care about anyone's expectations? This is not a game, Phoebe. You walked through a one-way door. You try to turn around now, they will destroy us. Who? - My sisters? - The underworld. If they think we're working both sides... ...they will revolt. If they do that... If they unite against us... ...I promise, we will pray for death. I'm sorry. - I didn't-- - I get it, Phoebe. Better than anyone, I know what you're going through. It will rip you apart if you let it. How do I not let it? You make a choice. And you stick to it. Even though it's hard. Even though it means giving up the people that you love. Let's go home. We're closed. - Honey-- - I don't want to talk. - I know you're feeling-- - Even more than I don't want to talk, I do not want a pep talk. Piper. What are you doing? What does it look like I am doing? I am trying to stop myself from feeling like the failure that I am. You're not a failure. - It's not your fault that Phoebe-- - I am the oldest sister, okay? It is my job to keep the family together. And see, at this, my friend, I am a failure. That's enough. Paige could see that Cole clearly had turned evil. And she tried to tell me over and over and over and over and over and over. That doesn't even sound like a word anymore. You know, I didn't see that he was evil, Piper. Phoebe didn't see it at first. We didn't want to see it. We wanted a normal, happy family. That's just human nature. She is my baby sister. And I let him destroy her. That is not human nature. That is the nature of failure. All right, I'm not gonna listen to this anymore. You are a good witch, and-- I said, no pep talks. Nobody listens around here anymore. Trey. - Congratulations on your 30 days. - Thanks. Leo. You again. Are you following me? Yes. Strangely, I am, and I would love to explain it to you. But it would be better if we could go talk inside by the crowd. No! What the hell? Leo! Athame! Damn it, where are my sisters? Oh, my God. Piper. --and a good sister. Paige, what--? You were frozen, Leo, and I'm guessing - demons didn't get her. - No, more like inner demons. I can't believe she froze me. - Are you okay? - Barely. It was a different demon this time. They really want that guy dead. You have to heal him and orb him somewhere safe. And then what? Then I'm gonna put this family back together. Can you heal Piper? No, I can't heal self-inflicted wounds. Great, now I'm down two sisters. My queen? It is time for your tonic. What if I promise never to save any innocents with them ever again? Then can I see my sisters? You'll feel better after this. Oh, my God. - It's poison. - No. - You told me it was good for me. - It is. - You're lying! - Think about it. Last night you were strong, angry perhaps. But now look at you, whining. It's a weakness unbefitting of a queen. - What's in it? - Pure evil. The baby feeds on it. - And as he grows stronger... - I get weaker. Only the good in you. You're trying to destroy me. I am trying to help you. I gave you clarity where now you have confusion. I gave you conviction where now you have pain. - You took away my will. - No. You made the choice to stand by your husband all on your own. For you, for Cole and for your baby. Don't risk all of your lives by questioning that now. Drink the tonic, Phoebe. What gives you the authority to call a meeting and summon me? I summoned you, my liege, but I didn't call this meeting. We all did. Then someone had better speak. - The concern-- - Someone else. Malek is missing. And the Charmed Ones are guarding his mark. Word on the street is that the queen worked alongside her sisters, who interfered with the kill. I wonder how that news spread. Forgive our confusion, but we were under the impression that the power of three no longer existed. The queen is pregnant. She's prone to hormonal fits. But I can assure you all that the power of three is indeed extinct. Then who killed Malek? I did. I was convinced he was about to betray me. Nevertheless, his mark still lives. Then assign someone to finish the task, Dane. I believe you already tried that, - my liege. - Are you questioning me? The innocent is still in the hands of the witches. Until we've seen evidence that the queen's... ...hormones are indeed under control, it might be best if you took out the mark, personally. For morale. How many hangover cures do you have? A lot. There was a time in my life when I needed these often. I'm sorry, Paige, I don't know what got into me. I mean, it's one thing when your sister has a husband that you can't stand. It's another when he is The Source of All Evil. Drink up. We got some work to do. I can't lose her. I can't lose another sister. I don't think I'll survive it. I've been thinking about it. Phoebe was different today. Yeah, she was nuts. Yeah, but she cared about us, about Greg. Something has changed, and I think now is our chance to get her back. - How? - Well, I think we storm the penthouse, bring the crystals. We still know the spell. We vanquish The Source the same way we did the last time. Yeah, but now, this time, The Source is Cole. Do you really think she's gonna say a little spell with us to vanquish him? If she doesn't, we die. Is that supposed to be comforting? Actually, yeah. The good in Phoebe is fighting to the surface. We saw that today. I don't think she's just gonna stand by and watch Cole kill us. Are you willing to bet your life on that? Aren't you? You know, you're pretty amazing, Paige. I mean, a year ago you were an only child. And I don't want to be again. Let's go. There we go. I'll get the crystals. Phoebe. Cole is gonna kill Greg Conroy. And I can't let that happen. So, what do you wanna do? I think that we have to vanquish Cole. I knew it. I knew she was ready. We have to use Greg as bait. Bait? He's an innocent. I know, but Cole is looking for him. He'll find him wherever he is, so he's safest here. So we have Leo bring Greg here, but then when Cole arrives, Leo's gotta orb Greg out of here. And then we vanquish Cole. I'll get the crystals. Phoebe... ... I know how much you love Cole. - And I'm really-- - I can't get emotional about this now, Piper. If I do, I won't be able to go through with it. Ready. Leo, bring Greg. So how long do you think till Cole gets here? Sooner than you think. Phoebe, we have to-- What's the matter? Did you know about the Seer's tonic? What it really does? What's this? You're planning to leave me? I wrote two letters. One saying goodbye to you, and one saying goodbye to my sisters. I haven't decided which one I'm gonna send. Well, you better decide. - Right now. - Did you know about the tonic? Yes. So you knew she was poisoning me with evil. You took my hand and walked me through that coronation Iong before anybody gave you anything to drink. If you wanna pretend that you're poisoned-- So why even bother with the tonic? Why not just let me think for myself? I know how it feels to have good and evil fighting inside of you, ripping your insides out. I wanted to save you that pain. You should have trusted me... ...to stand by you, all on my own. So... ...show me I can. You know what's in the tonic now. You know how it works. Drink it. All on your own. Cole. I don't have time for games, Phoebe. Just drink the tonic, or leave now. What is going on with you? - What happened? - What happened is, you had to go - play demon catcher with your sisters. - Cole, it's who I am! And now we're in danger. Serious danger. If you don't care about your life or mine or the baby's, what about Paige and Piper? Don't you threaten them. I'm not. If there's a coup, do you think whoever takes over for me will let them live? Without the power of three, they're sitting ducks. I don't know what to do. You can't go back. There is only one choice. Drink the tonic. You have to know that I would never do anything to hurt you. Please? For us. For our son. I love you, Phoebe. Just remember, whatever happens next, we can handle it as long as we stay together. What do you mean, "whatever happens next"? The Conroy thing got serious. I had to take care of it. - You killed him? - It was your mess. - I was just cleaning it up. - Cole, they're gonna come after you. - They're gonna come here. - Well, if they do-- No. Phoebe, if it comes down to them or us... Oh, God. Phoebe, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe? You evil son of a bitch. Phoebe. Get out here and help us, damn it. Paige. Don't make me kill you. Phoebe? You heard what he said. He's gonna kill us. Help us. Forgive me. I'm sorry. It's... It's for the best. I know it is. Phoebe? I'm sorry too. Phoebe, no. - No! - I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. Prudence, Penelope Patricia, Melinda Astrid, Helena Laura and Grace I'll always love you. Halliwell witches Stand strong beside us Vanquish this evil From time and space - Hey. - Hey. Why don't you go up and see her. I don't know what to say. I mean, I can't imagine... If it had been you... Hey. Hey. How is she doing? I don't know. She hasn't come down yet. How long you been standing there? A while. Maybe we should go see her? Okay. What if she wants to be alone?
