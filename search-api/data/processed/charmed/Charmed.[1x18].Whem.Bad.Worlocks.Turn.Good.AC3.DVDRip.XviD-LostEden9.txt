"You're a fraud. You can't fool God." These are not new fears, Brendan. I've watched you grow, wept for you, rejoiced in you. You are not a fraud. I know your heart. You don't know my family, Father. Generations of evil. Evil that's in my blood. The blood of the sacrament washes it clean. Hello, Brendan. Long time, no see. - How'd you find me? - Yeah, good to see you too. Didn't mean to interrupt your conversation. We'll wait outside for you so we can have a family reunion. Hey, you know what, the next time Quake does a food pantry, why don't you call some guys. Yeah, I'll just go through my handy guy Rolodex. Which I believe now stops at J for Josh. Or is it B for boyfriend? I don't wanna talk about it. Why not, Piper? You know you like him, and he calls you all the time. Why don't you just go out with him. I told you. Because I'm too busy with work, and my instincts are telling me to lay low. Always trust your instincts. Whose side are you on? - Now, they have got the right idea. - Who, the nuns? Yep. Nice, safe environment. Yeah, if you like monks. Stress-free, no need to worry about guys, no wardrobe. No wardrobe? Okay, now you're scaring me. Whose pen is this? Oh, it's Brendan's, I think. You know, the cute guy who signed for the food. Remember? - I remember him, yes. - Good, then you can take it to him. I think he's in the church office. Okay, just don't go taking any vows while I'm gone, all right? Cute guy. I just saw him being attacked by a warlock. - Where? - I think it was here, somewhere. All right, let's split up. Give it up, little brother. You're praying to the wrong deity. Aren't you, Brendan? I mean, after all, you can't deny who you are. You don't scare me, Greg. Sure, I do. We've come a long way to find you. We're not leaving until you join us. Please, Brendan. We don't wanna hurt you. Did you really think that the Church could save you? Hey. - Piper, Phoebe! - We'll come back for you. - Prue? - You guys, over here. - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Wait, where...? Hey. What happened? I don't know, but I'm gonna go find out. Amazing reflexes. Check it out. Should've kept a closer watch over Brendan over the years. We shouldn't have left him alone. Seriously, you gotta see this. Watch. I am sick and tired of you and this freaking lizard. Yeah? Too bad. I'm sorry. Okay? Just stay away from my pet. That's all I ask. Maybe we should let Brendan go. I mean, we don't really need him. It's not like we don't already have powers. Without his powers, we can't complete our triangle. Paul, the prophecy of the Rowe Coven. He must accept his heritage. He must be initiated as a warlock. Initiated how? We can't force him to kill an innocent. Maybe not. But we can stir his inner nature. The part that he thinks he's suppressed. Make him wanna kill. By tomorrow? Not a chance. Once he's been ordained, he's safe. He can never become a warlock. In which case, we will have to kill him. Hello? Oh, hello, Josh. How are you? I will call him back. Yeah, she's right here. Hold on a sec. You're dirty. Hello? No, that's all right. I'm always up this early. What's that? My horoscope said that? Really? Oh, well, that's a shame, because I have to work Friday night. Yep, Saturday too. Okay, I'm gonna go change the cat litter. Phoebe. What? What is the problem? She likes him. He likes her. The problem is it's none of our business. I... I've gotta go now, so... Thanks for calling, though. Yeah, but I gotta go to work. I'll be there all day and all night. Yep. Gotta go, bye. Okay, you know what, it's your life. You wanna be a nun? Godspeed. Thank you. Now, back to our warlock crisis. Why do we think they're after...? What's his name again? Brendan, and I don't know. I couldn't find him. But I've seen him at the church before. I'm hoping that the parish priest can help. Yeah, well, you better hope Brendan doesn't tell anybody about your powers, or else we've got bigger problems than just warlocks. Yeah, but I don't think he will. There's something in his eyes. I don't know. It just seemed like he wasn't surprised by it. All right. I've gotta go. I'll call you guys if I find out anything. Do you want us to go with you? You have to work, remember? Don't you dare answer that. Sit down. Excuse me. - Yes. - Father Austin? - Yes. - Hi. I'm Prue Halliwell. My sister helped coordinate the food for last night's... Piper, right. Of course. I'm very grateful to her. It was a wonderful evening. Except for what happened in here. Actually, that's why I'm here. Do you know someone named Brendan? I think he was one of the volunteers. I know Brendan very well. You don't think he had anything to do with this? No, no. But I did see two other men trying to hurt him. I mean, he's fine. He got away all right. But I don't think that they're gonna stop trying. He always said they'd come. - Excuse me? - Nothing. It's just something I know Brendan's been wrestling with his whole life. Do you know where I might be able to find him? Why do you want to? I think he's in trouble. And I might be able to help him. You? How? I can't really tell you that, Father. I'm sorry. It's kind of personal. I just have to ask you to trust me. So the lunch rush is almost over and then you're closed till dinner, right? - Yeah, why? - Just curious. Have you heard from Prue yet? No, not yet. What? - Why are you staring at me? - Because I'm worried about you, - that's why. - Oh, Phoebe, don't start. No, Piper, something's up. You're turning down dates with a guy that you like, extolling the virtues of convent living, you've been working double shifts three times a week. This is not the Piper I know, and I'm worried. Don't be. Everything is fine. I'd like a glass of Calera Jensen, please. '93, if you've got it. Josh. Good start. You recognize me. What are you doing here? - Phoebe. - What? This is such a surprise. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna cut right to the chase. Do you wanna get all hot and sweaty with me? I'm kidding. I'm on my way to the gym, and I thought since I can't buy you dinner, maybe we could work out together. I'll be right back. So will I. - I'm gonna kill you. - Why? A little exercise, a nice steam, a trip to the juice bar. What could it hurt? My job. I'm at work. I can't just up and leave. Okay. Well, I could babysit for you while you're gone. The restaurant? I don't think so. It's not like anything's gonna happen. You said it yourself, you're closed until dinner. Come on. It is just a workout. The worse-case scenario: You're in better shape by the time you check into the nunnery. Okay, fine. But only if it will get you to shut up. - It will. Okay. - Good. - Thank you. - You're welcome.</i> You sure you've never ridden a horse before? I've never even seen a horse before. Except on television. Well, you're a natural at it. Keep your grades up, you can come riding again. Promise? A spider! Kill it! Oh, no. He's just trying to find his way home, that's all. Besides, all life is precious to God, you know? Here. Don't be afraid. Trust me. There you go. Why don't you take him into the stable and set him free. I'll be right in. You're braver than me. How'd you find me? Father Austin told me that you would be here. We need to talk. Look... Prue. Prue. If you're worried about my telling anybody your secret, you don't have to. It's safe with me. Yeah, well, that's good to know. But why? I mean, most people would be pretty freaked out if they saw what you saw. I'm not like most people. Yes, I know. Most people aren't attacked by warlocks. I don't wanna talk about that. Okay. Hi, just gonna borrow this for a minute. Sure. Go ahead. Hey, wait up. Keep your grades up, maybe you can come riding again too. Oh, you promise? Who are you, anyway? Oh, well, that's not fair. I asked you first. I'm not quite sure I know the answer to that one, I'm afraid. Well, as far as I can see, you're too good to be true. I mean, church volunteer, great with kids. Loves horses, spiders. Not all spiders. - Hate black widows. - That's a good thing. What? Brendan, you're in danger. Serious danger. I know. Wait. How do you know? I can help you. No, you can't. You're lucky they didn't hurt you. They could've killed you last night. Who could've? Who are they? Doesn't matter. After tomorrow, I'll be safe from them forever. - What happens tomorrow? - I become a priest. A little sweat. A nice steam. A trip to the juice bar. I'm gonna kill you, Phoebe. - How you doing? - Great. Never better. Well, you're looking great. I can't believe you've never done this before. Yeah, well, believe it. Want me to keep you company on the way up? Oh, no. I'll meet you down there. All right, then. See you in a few. Gotcha. Talk about falling for a guy. I can't believe I said that. - Hello, Quake. - Phoebe.</i> Hey, Piper. How's it going? Bad, real bad. Really? Why? Cliffs Notes version will do. You wanna know why? I'll tell you why. Because we shared the look. - The look? - Yeah. You know,</i> the look that precedes the kiss. You look at each other at the same time, you smile at each other at the same time. Well, that's great. I knew you'd have a good time. No, Phoebe. This is exactly what I did not want to happen. Is that water I hear running? Water? I don't know. Maybe just a little. You know, just out of curiosity, if you were the water shutoff valve, where would you be? Where'd you get the phone? Phoebe just called. There's an emergency at the restaurant. I gotta go. I had a really great time. Thanks. You're welcome. Prue. - Dear God! - Call 911. Hurry. Prue, wait. You don't understand. - Don't I? - I didn't hurt Father Austin. I found him like that. I swear. Before or after you turned into a warlock? After. When I saw what they did to him, I was crazed. The rage turned me into a warlock. Look, don't believe me. I don't care. Just at least let me call the paramedics. Please. Don't let him die. I'm begging you. They've already been called. Thank you. Do you actually expect for me to believe that you're a good warlock? No. There's no such thing. I can explain it to you if you let me. I can make you understand. I won't hurt you. I need your help. - For what? - To stop the other warlocks. To stop my brothers. Got an eyewitness. A nun. Saw someone she ID'd as Brendan Rowe run from the scene. Apparently Mr Rowe lives in the rectory behind the church. You all right? No, I'm not. Father Austin's my priest. He gave me my first communion. What kind of animal would do this? - Wanna follow him to the hospital? - No. I wanna catch the scum that did this to him. - Thank you. - Thank you. You should've called me. I know, I know. But you had a good time, right? Unfortunately. Do you confuse yourself when you do that? It's just... I don't know, Phoebe. It seems like every guy I've liked lately has been either a warlock, a ghost or otherwise unavailable, like Leo. I was just trying to save myself some grief with Josh. But Josh is available. And human too. I think. I just don't wanna be disappointed again. I'm tired of falling for the wrong guy, human or supernatural. Well, I am sorry. If I had known that you wanted to take a dating hiatus, I wouldn't have pushed so hard. Are you mad at me? No. I'm grateful. - Yeah? - You followed my instincts. I don't know what I would do without you. A warlock naturally comes from two warlock parents, like Greg and Paul do. But they're just my half brothers. I had a different mother. - A human mother? - Yes, a wonderfully human mother. So then we have something in common. My father was human. Difference is, he came from good. Mine came from pure evil. Descended from an ancient warlock line, intent on furthering the Rowe Coven. Three brothers destined to become the most powerful force for evil the world has ever known. The evil Charmed Ones. Only, I went into hiding. I didn't wanna be a part of it. I wanted to break the chain. Make amends for all my family's done. By becoming a priest? Embracing God in that way is the only way to lose my power, my warlock nature, forever. And with it, keep the Rowe Coven from ever being. I've been at war with myself all my life, Prue. Running from the evil inside of me. I guess it finally caught up. - You can fight it. Fight them. - No, I can't. My brothers are too powerful. They're relentless. They'll keep hurting the people I care about till I give in. They'll even hurt you. I can take care of myself. It's you that I'm worried about. Don't worry about me. I know what I have to do. I have to kill my brothers before they trick me into killing somebody else. You'll have to follow me to their place. And then you and your sisters will have to kill me. - Everything's ready. - Good. He's coming. This is amazing. Just at his approach, my power quickens. It's as if I'm reaching out for him for completion. Do you feel it too? Brother. - I'm here to kill you, Greg. - Well, I'm glad. Anything less, I'd be disappointed. But first... ...you're gonna need this. It's okay, Brendan. Take it. I know this wasn't your doing, Paul. But I'm gonna have to kill you too. But me first. Yes. Just come on. You're feeling it now. Come on, that's it! You're almost there. Feel that pull in your gut, in your blood? This is us. This is your birthright. What the hell? You smell it, Brendan? It's damp, intoxicating. But you need to kill. Oh, yes. That's it. That's it. We got here as soon as we could. We didn't have time to get the Book of Shadows.</i> Yeah, I don't wanna have to kill Brendan too. - You said he's a warlock. - Yeah, I know he is. But if we can vanquish his brothers before he turns, we might be able to save him. Okay. One clean thrust, and you're both at peace. Finish it. Brendan, no. Three witches. We can't defeat them without Brendan, and we haven't got him yet. - It's okay, you're safe. - No, don't take the blindfold off. - She'll see us. We'll call for help. - Prue, he's a warlock. I know. - Minimal traffic. - CSU needs the photos. I'll give it to them. Victim's a little shaken up, so let's give her some air, okay? - Here you go, inspector. - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thank you. You okay to talk a little more? Yeah. I had just gotten to my car, and I was loading the groceries in the back... ...and they just came out of nowhere. Was this guy, Brendan Rowe, was he one of them? No. But I remember them calling one of the other ones that. I was blindfolded, and I think they drugged me or something, because the next thing I remember, I was here. I felt the tip of the knife. He was gonna kill me. - But she made him stop. - She? One of the women that came. Prue. I think her name was Prue. Thanks. Stay with her. Bastards painted an occult symbol on her chest. A target. She's lucky to still be alive. - She ID Brendan Rowe? - Yeah. She said two others blindfolded her, brought her here for him to kill her. Where are you going? I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, once and for all. Hey, you can sleep in my room, and I'll sleep with Piper. Why? Because Phoebe kicks. No, I mean, why are you doing this? Why are you being so kind to me after what I almost did? Yeah, but you didn't. And that's what's important. You didn't succumb to your brothers' will. Only thanks to you. They had me, Prue. Right where they wanted. I mean, I could feel the evil inside taking over. It was so strong, so powerful. If you and your sisters hadn't come in when you did... You would've stopped yourself. You wouldn't have hurt her. How can you be so sure of me when I'm not even sure of myself? Because you're a good person, Brendan. I've seen it. At church, in Father Austin's words, at the stables with that little girl. Your good side is much stronger than your evil side. You just have to keep fighting until the ordination in the morning. And then you're home free. And we are gonna make sure that you get there on time. How many more temptations must I endure? Okay, I'm gonna go. Night. Night. He was about to drive a knife into that woman's heart. - You couldn't have missed that, right? - I didn't. I saw Brendan not plunge the knife into her. Yeah, that's because we stopped him. Then why isn't she dead? Because we showed up. No, because we followed him. Because last night, Phoebe had a premonition of Brendan being attacked. That makes him the innocent that we're supposed to protect. Not necessarily. I mean, maybe we were directed to him so we could save the real innocent, the woman. Which we did, and now you've brought her would-be killer, a warlock, into our house. How do you know he won't try to kill us? That's what warlocks do. He's not just a warlock, he's human too. Okay, look. Piper, remember when the Wendigo turned you into a monster? The struggle that you went through? And, Phoebe, what about when the shadow turned you evil? What you went through to fight him off just to stay good. If anybody could relate to what Brendan is going through, I would think it would be you two. He has worked so hard for so many years to overcome his dark side, his brothers. And he's so close. What if...? What if you're wrong? What if he crosses over and joins his brothers? Well, then, they become the evil Charmed Ones, and it's too late to stop them. I know. Look, I can't explain it. I'm just following my instincts. And they've never led me wrong before, at least not when I've really listened to them. Guys, if you can't believe in him, can you please at least believe in me? Okay. Well, if we're gonna help Brendan get to his ordination, we have to figure out a way to stop his brothers. They're definitely gonna be there waiting. Who could that be? Brendan's brothers? Something tells me they're not exactly the ringing-the-bell types. - Andy. - Hey, Prue, you feeling lucky? Because I'm here to do you a big favour. I'm gonna forget that I can place you at the scene of a crime. If you tell me where I can find Brendan Rowe. I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. I'm talking about justice for Father Austin. Ever hear of him? What's the matter? Need more time to work on your story? - Andy. - Sorry, but all bets are off on this one. A priest, my priest, was viciously attacked at his own church. This is a guy who dedicated his entire life to doing only good. Then a young mother was kidnapped and almost sacrificed at an altar. Now, I can place Brendan Rowe at both scenes of the crime. And the female victim hearing your name at the last one. And believe it or not, I don't care why you were there. All I care about is who tried to kill Father Austin. I wish that I could help you. Piper, what about you? You wanna tell me where he is? We're not hiding any criminals here, Andy, if that's what you're asking. Fine. Father Austin's in intensive care. If he dies, it's first-degree murder. And if I find out you were somehow involved, I won't be able to look the other way this time, Prue. I've never seen him like that before. Can you blame him? I hope you're right about Brendan, Prue. Fratrem nostrum reconciliate Conventum nostrum consummate Fratrem nostrum reconciliate Conventum nostrum consummate Fratrem nostrum reconciliate Conventum nostrum consummate Fratrem nostrum reconciliate He should've been here by now. - I told you the spell wouldn't work. - We've still got time. I'm telling you, he can't be taken. His mother's blood is too strong in him. Then we will have to kill him. I won't let that happen. You won't have a choice. - Brendan. - The spell brought you here. But the rest you're gonna have to do on your own, little brother. - I understand. - Do you really? I feel only my power reaching out to yours, and yours, to complete our triangle. All it takes is the life of a mortal. And then your initiation is complete. I'm afraid it's gonna take a bit more. We need proof that you have truly turned. To complete the Rowe Coven... ...you need to sacrifice a witch. Prue. Where'd he go? Probably to the rectory to get ready. But you're not sure. - No, I'm not. - What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go find him. - Wake up Pheebs, okay? - I'm up. Wanna know what the Book of Shadows says</i> about the Rowe Coven? - Go. - It's not good. Ever since the tenth century, each generation has grown stronger. Nobody can find a spell or a weapon that can stop them. Some days you just shouldn't get out of bed. Let's just hope that the power of three can beat them. Unless it's already three against three. You sure you don't want us to go with you? - If he's turned, he'll kill you. - No, he won't. I can talk to him. Look, I'll yell for help if I need it. I just need a minute alone with him. Hello, Prue. Hi. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, sure. Why? Worried about me? A little. Especially since you left this morning without a word. Yeah, well, big day. I wanted to get a jump on it. Yeah. Shouldn't you be getting ready? I am ready, Prue. They got to you, didn't they? Look at this place. It's hardly furnished. Dresser... ...crucifix, bed. Will this be my life, to meditate? To shut out the world? - Have your brothers been here? - Mortify the flesh? They put a spell on me, to make me see your mortal body only. Something to kill. And I see it. You can fight it, Brendan. No, it's okay, don't. So this is it? You kill me or I kill you? Prue. Everything that you've worked for. All the good that you've done and still can do. All for nothing, all lost? I don't believe it. I don't believe that this is the real you. No, Brendan, wait. You're good. You can't kill me. It's not who you are. It's not why Father Austin believes in you. Did I hurt you? No, I'm okay. Forgive me. I wasn't worried. Were you worried? It's clear. You betrayed us, little brother. I'm very disappointed. Leave them out of this, Greg. You're protecting witches now? - You make me sick. - Prue? Now. No, not this time. I'm ready for you. - But family first. - Yeah? Come and get me. Greg, wait! Brendan, don't let them turn you. Don't use your powers. Give him a chance. It's not too late, Brendan. You can still join us. You're either with us or you are against us. Then I'm against you. Then you will die. Damn you, Brendan. No, Greg. Damn you. No. I'm sorry. I'm not. It's time. Yeah, I know. After all these years, after everything I've given up to get here... ...the sacrifice never seemed greater than it does right now. Tell me about it. You know, if you're ever gonna lose a guy... ...it might as well be to the big guy. Yeah. - What can I get you, Prue? - Hi, Bobby. The usual. - You got it. - Thanks. Hey. Hi. Still mad at me? Listen, Prue, I'm sorry about how I acted earlier. Andy, please. You don't have to apologize. I know how close you are to Father Austin. I've known you a long time, remember? Yeah. I remember. Actually, I just came from the hospital. The doctors think he's gonna be okay. I'm glad to hear that. And he said it wasn't Brendan Rowe who attacked him, it was his brothers. I suppose you don't know where I might be able to find them. No. Thanks. But I have a feeling that you're not gonna be able to find them anywhere. Really. Now, I wonder how you might know that. Never mind, I think I already know. Well, I'd better get back to work. I just wanted to stop by. I'm glad you did. Well, you're not handcuffed. That's a good sign. Depends on who's cuffing you. I'm joking. I wonder how he knew that I would be here. Are you kidding? We're always at Quake after we vanquish warlocks. Either here or at home. Oh, there's Josh. Oh, man. That guy cannot take a hint. Piper, this is my fault. I'm the one who pushed you on him. So I will handle this, okay? It's okay. I called him. I've decided it's time to try and work through my fears and trust my instincts. Always a good thing to do. - Especially when they're that cute. - Yeah. Piper. Hey. I'm a little surprised you called. I thought maybe you were mad at me or something. No, I just had to go to church. Table for two? Yes, you. So maybe I didn't do such a bad thing after all. I'd say helping her get over always falling for the wrong guy is a pretty good thing. Now maybe you can help me with it. Yeah. It's not fair, Iosing such a catch like Brendan to the priesthood. God's got all the studs. Well, at least he's not a warlock anymore.
