Claws of pain we have to sever Demon, you are gone forever Sorry to bother you, but she was immune to my powers. That's okay, I was just getting ready to leave work. - Oh, honey, you're hurt. - It's okay. It's just a scratch. So how's it going? How's the new place? Great and great. - How about you? - Can't complain. Ditto. Well, it's good to know that we can live apart and still kick some butt if we have to, right? So do I wanna ask about this demon with the bad manicure? A Harpy, part of a faction. Tried to kill us to move up in the world, you know. Pretty standard stuff. You wanna stay for dinner? I would love to, but Cole is planning this whole romantic thing for us tonight. Yeah, I just thought, you know, maybe we could talk. Why? Are you okay? Is everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. I just thought maybe we could catch up. Another time. Do you want me to orb you home? No. Cole's not so crazy about you orbing in without calling first. Except for emergencies, you know? - You understand. - Sure. Whatever. Okay. I'm gonna go. I'll call you guys. No orbing? Don't start with the suspicions, Paige. Cole's probably just trying to protect their privacy. He's trying to protect something. I'm just trying to protect our assets. And the only way to do that is to cut our losses, consolidate our resources. Keep the competition from killing you. Us. - Fine, what are you proposing? - A merger. Everyone here has similar agendas, right? So why don't we work together to accomplish them? You're late. Sit down. Where was l? You were just encouraging us to hold hands and be friends. It's a new millennium. We need to think in new ways to ensure our own survival. Let's face it, it's a demon-eat-demon world out there. Each one of you leads a faction. But that is the problem. You're too busy trying to kill each other. In the end, everyone loses. Tell that to the Grimlocks. They tried to vanquish us just last week. You had it coming. Care to try again? My point exactly. Infighting has always been our undoing. And I have learned from the humanity in me. The only way for us to defeat good is to work together to achieve common goals. And who will decide what these goals are? You? Unless someone wants to challenge me. Meeting's adjourned. Hi, honey. You're home early. Vegetarian egg-white omelette, just the way you like it. That's sweet, honey, but I think my stomach has other plans. - What's the matter? - Headache, upset stomach. - It's going around right now. - So maybe you should call in sick? While so many relationships are in peril? What would San Francisco do without my advice column? I gotta go. I wanna invite my sisters over for dinner this week. - Is that okay? - Well, we just moved out. Yeah, I know, but I wanna show them the place. Besides, I don't want them to think that they're not still part of my life, you know? Fine, just no orbing, all right? Already taken care of. - What happened? - Oh, nothing. My shoulder just got in the way of a Harpy's claw, that's all. A Harpy? You got attacked? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think it was that big a deal. That's why. Well, it is to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... I think I deserve to know when my wife gets hurt. You're right. You do. Excuse me, Mr. Turner? Your 9:00 is waiting in the lobby. Julie, what are you doing here? You didn't tell me she was here. Well, we're working out of the apartment today. They're painting my office. You don't mind, do you? No. No, of course not. Make yourself at home. I will, thank you. Pretty little witch, if you're into that sort of thing. I am. Get the leader of the Harpies. I want to explain to her the consequences of attacking my wife. You don't really expect me to wage war on the new Source without even talking to him first, do you? It's a waste of time. He'll never bring you back from exile. He's heard the stories of what you did. That was a different time and a different Source. Still, it's not going to happen. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't sure of that. Then what makes working for us any better than working for him? You ought to listen better. I don't work for anyone. We'd be equals, partners. And once The Source is dead, we'd go our separate ways. So? I'll let you know... ...when I'm ready. I want you to offer the new Source an olive branch. And if he refuses? Then Keats has a new ally, and we have a new enemy. Go. Plenty of leftovers. Probably won't have to do any cooking for a week. I like to cook. Well, there's less dishes to do, and that's a good thing, right? I guess. It's just with Phoebe and Cole gone, it's so quiet around here. Everybody I grew up with is gone. Still, we can make it noisy again with kids, people who will grow up with us. We have an extra room now, right? Right. Sorry. Am I interrupting? Actually, I need to get going. There's an upsurge in demonic activity and the Elders wanna figure out why. Well, since that demonic activity spilled into our living room last night, I'm assuming it has something to do with us. Well, keep an eye out, and I'll let you know if I find anything out. - I love you. - I love you too. You okay? Me? Yeah, I'm fine. Liar. Look, I know I am not Phoebe, but I am still your sister, and you can talk to me, you know. It's-- It's just silly. My period was late this month by a couple of days. And I guess I got my hopes up a little. That's not silly, honey. You want kids, right? Yeah, of course. It's just that we've been trying, and-- - For a couple of months. - Four. But who's counting? Oh, Piper, you're not baking cookies, you know? It's gonna take some time. Yeah, I know. I guess I was just worried that, you know, something could be wrong. Getting flung around by demons isn't exactly conducive to making babies. Okay, A, you're gonna have kids. You saw that in your future. And B, I am living proof that magic happens when whitelighters and witches get together. So the sooner you stop worrying about it, the sooner I will be an aunt. - Thanks. - You're welcome. The leader of the Harpies won't be coming to see you. I'm afraid things got out of hand for her. Nice work. - What's next? - Rowan's waiting to see you. Apparently, the queen would like in on the new alliance. Send him in. He'll see you now. Thank you for the audience. - The queen sent me to tell you-- - Tell your queen that if she steps a foot inside my realm, she'll beg me to banish her again. Sent me to tell you that we've learned our lesson, and we're willing to serve you. No, thanks. I already have enough demons betraying me. You haven't even heard our offer. I think you should be leaving now. - Paige. - I just thought I'd pop in. - From where? - The kitchen. - I'm not interrupting anything, am l? - No. We're done here. Elevator's that way, Rowan. What the hell do you think you're doing? This is exactly why I don't want you people orbing in here. You people? Nice. - What do you want? - Phoebe. I think Piper needs to talk to her. Well, you missed her. But why don't you orb on over to the newspaper. I'm sure those journalists can keep a secret. Just tell her I stopped by, okay? And dare I ask, why is it so dark in here in the middle of the day? Migraine, which you're only adding to. You know what, Cole, just bite me. After you. Nice guy, huh? Cole. - You a lawyer? - No. Why? Because only another lawyer would think that. No, I was being sarcastic. About being a lawyer? No, about thinking he was a nice guy. - Sorry. - No. - I'm Rowan. - Paige. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - So how long have you disliked Cole? - Ever since I first met him. You? Pretty much just recently, ever since he married my sister. Do you have any siblings? Oh, yeah. My family's real big. Then you know what it's like to have to bite your tongue. Been there, done that. Listen, I'd like to continue this, but we've just run out of floors. Any chance we could get together? Well, my sister-- My other sister owns this nightclub called P3. And I'll be there later if you wanna stop by. - I'll drop in. - Okay. - Are you coming? - Oh, no, underground parking. You're certain of her identity? She's the sister of The Source's new bride. That makes her a Charmed One. This might be our lucky day. And you said meeting with the new Source would be useless. He refused your offer, didn't he? Yes, but he gave us something much more valuable instead. If we can get a Charmed One on our side, we can use her magic to take over the underworld before The Source can. We can destroy him and anyone else who opposes us. Yeah, but she's a witch. They don't change sides on a whim. Oh, I think I can get her to see things our way. With your permission, of course. By all means. Take whomever you need. Your mystery man still pulling a disappearing act? I can't believe he stood me up. Well, I'm glad I'm not dating anymore. Yeah, well, I should've known better than to think I could meet a guy through Cole. Paige, I have two words for you: Broken and record. If you keep this up, you're just gonna end up pushing Phoebe further away. She's right. - That's more than two words. - Hi. Do I still get free drinks here or do I have to pay now? You don't look so good. Are you okay? That's partly why I'm here. I thought it was just a bug, and now I'm not so sure. So I'm wondering if maybe it has something to do with, you know, the scratch. Maybe you're turning into a Harpy. Oh, God. Are you? Well, that's how Piper turned into a Wendigo. Or is it the Fury? I've turned into so many things, I can't keep track. You know, I wouldn't worry. You can't turn into a Harpy just by getting scratched. Yeah, but still. Do you mind--? You know. Hey, hey, hey. A little discretion in public. Hey. - Feel any better? - A little, I think. So any word from the Elders on what's going on? - No, not yet. - Why? What's going on? A lot of bad guys, apparently, more than usual. - Should we be worried? - Nope. Not until after dinner. - You want to join us? - Okay, sure. Why not? I'm not gonna go. I don't want Rowan thinking I was waiting for him if he shows up this late. God forbid. You buying? You kidding? Phoebe, I think you should try to find a moment to talk to Piper. - Why, is something wrong? - No, not really. I just think she could use your support about something. That's why I orbed over to your place this morning to talk to-- Wait! You orbed to my place? After I specifically asked you not to? Paige, what were you thinking? I was just trying to help Piper. - Was Cole upset? - A little. A lot. Great, Paige. Just great. I was just trying to help. So am I the weirdest case you've ever seen? I don't know. I've worked the night shift for a while now. Seen some pretty strange things. Yeah, but these were bats, doc. Paige! Paige! Oh, my God. Are you okay? - What happened? - Bats. Lots of bats. - You the sisters? - Yeah. Is she gonna be all right? Honestly, if she hadn't been found by somebody in time, she might have bled to death. - But she's gonna be okay? - Yes. After some rest and rabies shots. You got attacked by bats outside of my club? That can't be natural. Can it? Well, bat bites aren't completely unheard of in the city. I have a friend over at County who treated one a couple of months ago. Right, but these were bats. Plural. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Sounds more natural than supernatural to me. - Yeah. Well, I'm thinking vampires. - Vampires? That'd be different. - No, that's not possible. - Why not? Well, because as far as I know, vampires attack in human form and not as a swarm of bats. You know, it's gotta be something else. True. Vampires have been ostracised from the underworld for centuries. As far as I know, they're a part of a whole different network now. I'm sorry, Lisa here is gonna draw some blood so we can run some tests. - That mean I can go home? - Well, I don't see why not. I'm gonna get you started on antibiotics and then schedule the first of the rabies shots in the morning. Okay, now make a fist. Relax your hand now. I'm almost done. - You okay? - Yeah, as long as I don't look. I didn't mean you. Phoebe? Damn it. Where is she? What about the Grimlocks? The Grimlocks? You think they attacked her? If they did, I'll crush their skulls with my bare hands. Who said romance was dead? We were talking about who we could trust, remember? Grimlocks, yea or nay? Sorry. Yeah. Grimlocks are okay. Keats is the only one I don't trust. - That's gotta be her. - I could only hope. - Phoebe? - Hi, honey. Are you all right? I called your cell. You didn't pick up. Yeah, well, that's probably because I was unconscious. - What? Did a demon hurt you? - No, it was nothing like that. I just-- I fainted. - Fainted? - Yeah, it was no big deal. Why do people gotta keep their high beams on? Phoebe, people just don't faint for no reason. Well, I've been pretty rundown, and the doctor said I might be anaemic. He took some blood to make sure that's all it is. Well, maybe you ought to get Leo to check the Harpy scratch in case-- I already did and he said there's nothing to worry about. Besides, we have bigger demonic issues that we have to deal with right now. Paige was bitten by a bunch of bats. Bats? Are you sure? - I'm sure he's all broken up about it. - Yeah, she's okay. Leo's gonna heal her when we get home. So you wanna meet us there? I am home, Phoebe. You called me. I meant the manor. I'm sorry. I'm on my way. You think it was Rowan? He must've been trying to turn her-- You can't let them get a Charmed One on their side. - They'll be too powerful. - Don't you think I know that? Damn it. Gather the faction leaders. The queen wants a war. She's got one! - Where are you going? - To the manor! To help save Paige. - "Manticore." - Bites but doesn't fly. - "Phoenix." - Flies but doesn't bite. - "Chupacabra." - God bless you. Flies and bites but only attacks livestock. What about shape-shifters? What about this being a waste of time? Look at me. I'm fine. Let's just call it a night. Paige, if you're tired, just go to bed. We'll wake you up if we find something. Fine. I'll be asleep. She's a delight. She's been through a lot. She needs some rest. Isn't there some way you can help us narrow down the suspects? With every demonic faction in town, it makes it kind of hard. Okay. So, what's going on? Is there a demon convention in San Francisco or what? Yes, there is a demonic electoral college. They've called a meeting and they're voting in a new Source. - You think? - Well, not the voting part. But maybe. I mean, there's gotta be somebody pretty powerful that's bringing together these factions. - Which means-- - Evil may have a new leader. - Cole. - Honey, I came soon as I could. I'll be fine. Don't worry. - How's Paige? Where is she? - She's sleeping. I healed her. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Why? Do you know what we're up against? Bats that bite can only be one thing, vampires. No, we ruled them out. It doesn't seem like their m.o. Have you ever seen a vampire? No, but I've read about them. Well, I've dealt with them. You can trust Anne Rice, or you can trust me. I think he might be right. Wait, you dealt with vampires as a demon? How is that possible? I thought they were pariahs in the underworld. Well, I wasn't too picky who I dealt with. I didn't care that The Source had banished them - for selling him out to his enemies. - Why attack a Charmed One now? - What do they want? - There must be a power struggle. - Trying to overtake the underworld. - By killing Paige? No, by turning her into a vampire. Paige? Paige? Where'd she go? Oh, my God! Paige! Watch out! I ransacked the whole house, and this is all I could find. Okay. So, what do we do about the holy water? I can get some. You know, that stuff's only gonna help you fight off the vampires. It's not gonna change Paige back. Yeah, I'm working on that. According to the Book, if you kill a vampire queen, then all her little vampires die with her. Really? Interesting. They certainly don't like to spread that around. But that's not gonna work, because then it'll kill Paige too. No, not if she hasn't bitten anyone. Apparently, the transformation only takes place after blood is spilled or in this case, sucked. Okay, so we have to kill the queen fast. How do we vanquish her? With the power of three. Of course, can't anything be easy? Oh, it gets worse. Vampires are immune to witch powers. Well, I'll get the holy water once l fill in the Elders about the new Source. New Source? There's a new Source? Yeah, we think so. - Any idea who it is? - No, not yet. Okay, let's just focus on finding Paige. So if you were undead, where would you be? - Cemetery? - Right, let's go. We don't got a lot of time. We got a bunch of them to check out-- Well, Phoebe... ...I don't want you to go. - What? - Well, it's too dangerous. What happens if you faint again, but this time in a vampire attack? - Baby, that's not gonna happen. - Well, how can you be sure? I don't wanna lose you. I don't wanna lose Paige. I don't understand. Weren't you just telling us that we had to save Paige? Well, yeah, but that was before I had all the facts. You need the power of three. I'm sure Paige is not gonna be in a rhyming mood. So, what do you suggest? That we let her spend eternity as a vampire? She's still my sister. And that doesn't change because I happen to be sick. Or because I'm your wife. The vampires are trying to convert my wife's sister, a Charmed One. I'm interpreting this as an act of war against me. Wait a second now. Let's not overreact. Maybe this is some kind of a misunderstanding. I don't misunderstand anything. I want the vampires exterminated. - Every last one of them. - But vampires multiply too fast. We could never get them all. If we kill the queen, they all die. I've never heard that. What's your source? Are you questioning my orders? No, of course not. I want the queen. Dispatch your forces. Tell them to torture any vampire they see. Make them talk. But don't forget my wife is out there too. Anyone lays a claw on her will answer to me. - Leave. - As you wish. What about the other sister? Are you gonna let her die with the queen? It would eliminate the Charmed Ones. Phoebe would be devastated. But I wouldn't be. Sorry to interrupt you during dinner. That's all right, I've had better. - Is she here then? - Just arrived. She's perfect. She'll fit right in. I thought you'd like her. Are you hungry, my dear? Famished. That's wonderful. Now, for your first meal, I have two savoury victims in mind. Here you are. Anything for you, my queen. I want you to go back to your sisters, Paige. Take a taste of your own blood. It will seal your conversion and turn them as well. That's genius. With the power of three on our side, The Source will be no match for us. My sisters are very powerful. They won't join us willingly. I don't think I can do it alone. Oh, my darling. Look around you. That's what families are for. What are you doing here, Keats? - I have to get a message to the queen. - Well, why don't you take it yourself? Because someone might be following me. Tell her she needs to leave town fast. - The Source is-- - The Source is what? Where's the queen, Keats? You can vanquish me if you want, but I'm not telling you anything. Do you really think that vanquishing you is the worst I can do? So let's try this again. Where is the vampire queen? They're not here. They must be looking for you. Do-gooders. I was hoping to get this over with. Now, just relax. You're only innocent once. But I'm starving. I feel like I've been waiting for this moment my whole life. - What are you smiling at? - I was just thinking of my first time. Tell me about it. It's better than you can possibly imagine. Danger, excitement, the warm glow you feel afterwards. There's nothing like it. How many have you had? I don't keep track. The faces all fade away. It's the taste you remember. And what was l, just fast food? Oh, hardly. Just relax. Clear your mind. You are a hunter now. You have the ability to find your prey. I don't understand. You will. Close your eyes... ...and focus. I know where they are. Oh, you're a natural. Tell the queen to expect company. Hey, wait! Hey! Wait! We just wanna talk to you. What is going on? That's the fourth demon tonight to run away from us. Well, maybe word got out that we killed The Source? - The old Source. - You had to mention that, didn't you? I don't get it. We've been chasing demons all night, searching cemeteries all night, and no freaking vampires. This is ridiculous. We gotta figure out something else before the sun comes up. What's the matter? You okay? Yeah, just a little dizzy. Those tombstones aren't actually moving, are they? Phoebe, this is not funny. Maybe this is more than just being rundown. Maybe you're pregnant. That is funny. Actually, it's not so funny. I went to the drugstore. I got a test. I peed on a stick and I anxiously awaited the results in two minutes. - And? - And... It was negative, thankfully. Yeah. Well, mine was too. You thought you were pregnant? For about a minute and a half. Oh, honey, I am so sorry. No, it's okay. It's no big deal. Yes, it is. To you it is. Is this what you wanted to talk to me about? I had no idea. - It's okay. I understand. - No, it's not okay. I left the manor, not the family. I still want to be a part of your life. All of it. You sure? You come over here. - Don't I get a hug? - Paige. - How did you find us? - We share the same blood, Piper. I sniffed you out. Paige, listen to me. We can go back to the manor, and we'll find something to change you back. - Hold it. - Why you gotta be like that? Now it's time we really bond as sisters. Paige, we are just trying to help you, damn it! Catch me if you can. Okay, Leo, come on. Come on. Orb. Where are we? I can't see a thing. Good. Well, which one's Paige? How should I know? Welcome to our family. Stay away from us, or you'll get an eyeful of holy water and a chest full of wood. You'd only be delaying the inevitable. Now, why can't we do this without a fight? Paige, we're your sisters. You're not a vampire yet. We're offering immortal life. An eternity together as sisters. Now, isn't that preferable to death? Are those our only two choices? Because I prefer the scenario where you die and we get to stay human. If you could have killed me, you would've done so already. We both know that. - We gotta get out of here. - Not without Paige. Words will never make them understand. No, but they will. Incoming! Look out! Leo, holy water! Let's go! Leo! No, my babies! Come before The Source kills us all. We gotta get Paige. The Source. I should have bitten you. Yeah. Well, bite this. - What's going on? - The queen must be dead. Paige! Paige? In-laws. Paige, thank God you're alive. Are you all right? - The Source. - The Source? - What do you mean? - He was here. Just now? You saw him? The queen must have posed a threat to him. Well, that would explain why he wanted to kill her. But why not Paige or us? I don't know. Let's just count our blessings and get the hell out of here. You're up early. Vampire nightmares? Oddly enough, no. Just some other thoughts. Any you want to share? You wouldn't be interested. Try me. They're about Cole. I'm listening. Okay, remember the guy that stood me up? How could l? I never met him. Yeah, you did actually. He was one of the vampires. And I first met him at the penthouse. He was there seeing Cole. Now, I know what you're gonna say. Maybe Cole didn't know he was a vampire, and we should probably give him the benefit of the doubt. And you're right, we should. So then why do I get the sinking feeling that you might be on to something? - You do? - Well, it's just a lot of little things, Iike him not wanting you to orb in, - him not wanting us to-- - Save me? Go after vampires. I mean, I'm not saying that he's a demon, okay? Because we both know that's not possible. We both know anything is possible. Okay. But what if we're wrong? Then we lose Cole and Phoebe forever. We're not wrong. Something is not right. - Hello? - Hi. It's Paige. Paige? How are you feeling? Human again, thank God. Yeah, thank God. Is Phoebe there? She's still sleeping. Is it important? I'll just call her later. Who was that? Oh, nobody. How you feeling? Better. Good. Phoebe, I'm never gonna be okay with you chasing demons anymore. You can't change that. And you can't change the fact that they're gonna keep coming after me. And that I have sisters that need me. - I understand. - Do you? Because yesterday, it seemed like you didn't. Well, I just don't want anything to happen to you. Ever. Is that so bad? No. I'll be at work. Hello? This is Phoebe Halliwell. Hi, doctor. Did the test results come in? I'm what? I double-checked the results myself. You're pregnant, Miss Halliwell.
