So be outside in 20 minutes, I'm gonna do a drive-by, all right? Please let me have my keys! They're on the counter. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. That's okay, I'm just a little frazzled. I've gotta check on Chris, and then I gotta get to the store, and then I gotta go and pick up Wyatt early and make cookies for a Valentine's Day party. And then I gotta take these to P3. All of which pales in comparison to what you're going through. No, you know, life goes on. I'm just happy to have Christy back, I guess. - But? - But she hasn't even said anything. I mean, I told her I wanted to call Mom and Dad and she closed up even more. Well, you know, it's only been a couple days. Yeah, but what if I never get through to her? You will. I mean, you just have to be patient. She's been through something none of us can even imagine. So, I mean, the only thing you can really do is just be there for her. And if you need anything, we are just a call or an orb away, okay? Knock, knock. Hey, I brought you some breakfast. Christy? Christy? Christy? Christy, it's okay, you're safe now. You're gonna be okay. They're coming. Well, I guess we figured they'd try to get Christy back sooner or later. Yeah, I just wish it was later rather than sooner. Give the girl time to heal. I just wish we knew who "they" were and why they're coming. And why they want her back. Well, it doesn't matter, because they won't be getting her back. That's why we're here, sweetie. How is she? Very scared. Well, has she said anything? You know, who these demons might be, when they're coming? No, nothing. Okay, well, we need to try to come up with some sort of game plan, don't you think? But we don't know anything. We don't know why they've been keeping her. Which is why we have to find out what she knows, get her to open up. I just think it's too much for her right now. Look, they held her captive for 15 years, she must know something, at least be able to ID them. I just don't wanna pressure her right now. Well, sweetheart, she's already under pressure because she knows that they're coming. Do you think they're contacting her? Well, maybe. Then again, maybe she's got some sort of telepathic thing going on. It would actually kind of figure that she'd have powers, right? Maybe that can be why they wanted her in the first place. And why they want her back. You have to talk to her. I just don't think she's ready for that. Look, if it's coming from you, she'll be okay. She's your sister. There's no stronger bond than that, trust us. All right, I'll try. Okay, I'm gonna whip up a quick potion and you go to the "Book" and make a list of all the telepathic demons, okay? Oh, you're in a hurry. Yeah, well, I got a new condo to enjoy. Lamp! Excuse me, but I don't think you recognise my entrance. Fear not, ladies, I'm one of the good guys. The best, actually, so... Oh, yes, the legendary manor, where generations of Halliwells have blossomed into witches. Who are you and what do you want? Of course. Ladies, I am Simon Thaddeus Reginald Marx, and I'm here to take Paige Matthews as my wife. We've been at this for two days. If you want your suffering to end, you will tell me who took the witch. I don't know. - I swear! - Come on, you were in on it. Why else would you leave your post? I told you, I was called away. Please, you've gotta believe me! Do you think they'll believe you? They, who could decimate our entire clan on a whim. They chose us to watch over her. To break her down, and in return, we'd share in the ultimate power for which she is the key. If we don't get her back, we're all dead. I've questioned all of the Scathers. No one called him away. Last chance. Who are you working for? He may not even know. He may have been tricked, perhaps telepathically. The witch has answered to unseen voices before. We've seen it. If so, he's a liability. He's been breached. Gather the witch's things. We'll find her another way. We cannot use dark magic. They may sense it. They'll know something has gone wrong, we cannot risk it! We have to risk it. We must find out who took the witch if we are to survive. I know all about the Charmed Ones. I... I grew up on stories of the Warren line of witches. Grams and her many, many lovers. And of course, Patricia's tryst with her whitelighter. Goodness, you're a randy bunch. Is there some sort of magical "Enquirer" I've not heard of? Wow, our families worked together during the Salem witch trials? That is so cool. Well, you know, I'm just saying, he checks out. Well, you know, I am a descendant of the Mighty Marx, which is a very powerful, very noble line of witches. To be honest with you, I'm a little surprised you don't know who I am, but... My goodness, you're fetching. Oh, that's so sweet. Did you? But you're not half-whitelighter, which is a requisite for my future mate, so sorry to disappoint you. - But you, on the other hand, are. - Did you just say "future mate"? No, no. That was... That was... It came out wrong, apologies. Okay, here's the deal. We're actually super, super busy, so it would be fabulous if you could just orb yourself off now. I'll ignore that, but, Paige, I'm not leaving without you. After all, we are destined to be wed. Okay, who says? Well, only 40 of the most powerful oracles and soothsayers from around the globe, plus a wizard or two, so... When you think about it, Paige, it makes all the sense in the world. Bringing our two magical lines together, we would be the ultimate power couple. Okay, we're not gonna be bringing our lines or bringing anything together, for that matter, okay? - But why not? - Because I don't want to! And because I have a boyfriend. A boyfriend? I see. And who is he? A witch? A whitelighter? His name is Henry and he is a parole officer by trade and he is a mortal. Oh, an immortal, no less. Very impressive. No, not immortal, a mortal, as in non-magical. With all due respect, that makes absolutely no sense to me at all. Having a mortal around whilst you're fighting evil is, well, let's face it, irresponsible. Okay, you need to go now. Unless you wanna stay and help us vanquish demons. But of course, ma'am. Having a powerful witch around like myself can only be an asset. Tell me, how does Harry fare in a magical battle? Henry, and he fares just fine in whatever he wants to fare in. I'll be honest with you, I'm a little surprised you're not taking to this. You know, me? I mean, imagine, if you will, the evil we could vanquish as a couple. We are not now, nor will we ever be, a couple! Well, that did not go too well. Piper. May I be of some assistance? Bags. Are you crazy? What if somebody saw that? Well, what if somebody were to see you shopping? A witch of your standing? No, no. After all, there are people for things like that. - Who are you? - I am Simon Thaddeus Reginald Marx. Of the Marx line of witches? It's a very noble, very... Never mind. Moving on. First of all, I'm here to state my case. Great. Well, I don't have time for that, because I have to go pick up my son. Again with the magic. Piper, I'm here to appeal to you, you being the practical Charmed One. Now, listen to me: It is my destiny to marry your sister, Paige. Oh, for God's sake. Forty of the most powerful oracles and soothsayers from around the globe have predicted it. Plus a wizard or two. Good luck with that. According to your sister, a demon could be attacking at this very moment, and I want you to know that I am fantastic at vanquishing demons. Well, that's great, but we can handle our own demons. You'll see, it is my fate to be with Paige. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! - I'm so sorry, I wasn't even looking, I... - That's okay, don't worry about it. - Greg? - Piper? Hi. Oh, my God. Look, Christy, you're safe now. I promise, I am going to keep you safe. But I need your help to do that. Do you know who they are, who's coming? Do you hear them, like voices? Yeah? That's good, that's really good. What do they say? What do they want? You know, it's okay. You know, we can talk about it later. Don't worry, it's okay. I mean, who does this guy think he is? He just shows up and announces that we're destined to be together? Well, according to 40 oracles and a soothsayer, your future husband. That is really not funny. I'm sorry. How's the list coming? Well, I have a dozen that have telepathic powers. Well, hopefully Billie can convince Christy to narrow it down for us a little bit. Who's here? Rats, I forgot. Henry and I have a lunch date. Oh, you might wanna reschedule in case a demon attacks. Oh, look at you, you sound like Sir Full-of-Himself. Well, he might not be your Mr. Right, but he does have a point. Paige, I don't run away from a fight, okay?</i> Come on, I deal with violent, dangerous criminals every day. But those violent, dangerous criminals do not throw fireballs at you. Well, what about Piper's kids? I mean, they're here all the time. They have powers to defend themselves. They do? So please just go? I will call you in a little bit. Well, hold it, hold it, hold it. If I run away every time a demon attacks, I'm gonna be running away all the time, right? Okay. Okay, come on, baby. Oh, hi, sorry. Oh, thanks. - Go on. Wyatt's really gotta go. - Okay. If you could just put those on the dining-room table, that'd be great. - Sure. - Thanks. Sweetie, don't forget to wash your hands! I hear we have demons attacking? - How did you hear that? - You know, your friend, Simon? British? Very cocky? - Who's Simon? - Nobody. Okay, I have two seconds for you to catch me up. Go. Okay. Christy finally spoke. Unfortunately, she said something weird: - "They're coming. " - Who's coming? When? It's okay. Phoebe and I got this under control. We didn't tell you because you've got a crazy day. Crazier than you think. Guess who I just ran into, literally. - Whom? - Greg. - Greg? - Fireman Greg. Oh, he was the hot Greg. You gonna go out with him? Oh, God, don't be ridiculous. Christy, what is it? What's wrong? - Christy, please, I wanna help you. - I'm afraid. I know you're afraid. Nothing's gonna happen to you, you're in a very safe place. - You can't stop them. - Stop who? - Christy, please. - You can't stop them from coming. When? When are they coming? Now. So how long does it usually take for demons to attack? Well, it could be any time, really. You know, it depends. - On? - On timing, you know. Usually the worse it is for us, the better it is for them. You know, that kind of thing. Mustard? - No, thanks. - You can still opt out if you want. Not a chance. Incoming! What? What is it? They're here. Get down! Sweetie, why don't you orb up to your room? Fireball! No! It's okay, I'm all right, I'm okay. Are you okay? What's going on? What happened? Ask the firestarter. Paige... You know you could have been killed? - Paige, I'm okay. - No, you're not okay. You were hit by a fireball. Which was actually my fault. No, it was not your fault. I'm a grown man, I chose to be here. Henry, I really think you should leave. We don't know if they're coming back. Paige, I'm not leaving. I am not having this on my head, okay? So please? Please. All right. I know that was probably hard for you. I guess it would have been harder if I was planning his funeral. Well, looks like Christy has a few more powers than we realised, huh? Yeah, maybe more than even she knew about. Maybe that's why those demons were holding her hostage for all those years. Maybe they were trying to co-opt her powers for themselves. But I don't think she's that powerful. I mean, unless they know something that we don't. Well, all the more reason for her to open up so we can find out. I just think she's too freaked out. Well, she needs to get un-freaked out, and fast. Okay, I'm gonna go drop off Wyatt with Dad and Chris and get one of the other moms to take over cookie duties. Wait, why? What do you mean, "why"? Why do you think? We can handle this, Piper. - Yeah, but... - No buts. Listen, you bake and spend time with Wyatt and hopefully we can figure out who we're up against before they come back. Or before Christy burns down the house. - Christy. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. No, it's okay, you didn't do anything wrong. - Did you know you could do...? - No. But they did. "They"? You mean the demons? Were those the same ones? Who are they? I don't know. - I never knew. - It's okay. I told you we'd protect you, and we did. Look, I am not gonna let them hurt you anymore. I promise. It's over, don't you see that? The Charmed Ones are protecting her now. We still have time. - They haven't sensed anything yet. - How do you know? How do you know they are not deciding our punishment as we speak? Because they would have acted by now if they had. They're not known for their patience. We have to get the witch back somehow. Impossible. We do not have the power to go up against the Charmed Ones and survive. Still, it would be better to be vanquished by the witches than by the Triad. That would be a fate worse than death. Then perhaps we should escape, hide from them. They're the most powerful evil ever known. They'd find us. - Prepare the ritual. - The ritual? For the Triad? We cannot tell them we've lost her, that is suicide. We have no choice. They're the only ones who can get the girl back now. We'll just have to hope they show us mercy. - Hi. - Hey. What are you doing here? Hey, I'm sorry just to show up like this, Piper, but I've got... You've got a little something there on your cheek. Frosting? No, I was just baking cookies for my son's party. - Anyway... - Anyway. There's a guy in my station, he used to work at a body shop, and he says he can fix our cars for next to nothing. - Oh, that's great. - But there's a catch. You see, he's leaving this afternoon, his next shift isn't for, like, four days. But if we get your car down there right now, he can take care of everything. Well, I can't go. I've gotta bake a zillion cookies and drop them off at Wyatt's school... I smell smoke. Well, you know, I burned a few cookies. Looks like you burned more than a few cookies. Well, you know, kids. Those are the cookies. All right, you go, I'll watch him. Hey, buddy. Hey, little man, what's up? Pretty cool truck. Master Wyatt, it's an honour. Harry. Now, you must understand that your kind and our kind simply can't commingle. Where did you come from? There is a reason why mortals should stick to their own. - Well, actually, there's a few reasons... - Mortals? - Simon? - Darling. What are you doing here? I'm just explaining things to Harry here. If you mean Henry, that is not him. In fact, I don't know who that is. I'm Greg. We met once before, when I was dating Piper. Oh, right, Greg. Okay, excuse us. You need to get out. - Are you insane? - Are you? Those were Windsor roses, my dear. From East Sussex, very rare. We do not practise magic in front of mortals. Must be very trying. But I can assure you, Paige, once we are wed... We are not going to be wed. Not now, not ever. Get out. You take that one, I got that one. Let's crash them. - Come on. - Hey. How's it going? Not so good. Simon just orbed in in front of your friend. - Luckily, he didn't see anything. - Oh, thank God. Did you find who that shoe belongs to? No, we haven't yet, but we're on top of it, and it's not your job, so don't worry about it. Hey, Piper, if you want my buddy to fix the car, we better get going. Oh, gee, that's really great, but... Come on, we'll drop off the cookies on the way and Wyatt can play on the firetruck. - We can catch up. - Yeah, hold that thought. I don't think that's a good idea. Actually, I think it's a great idea. What with Simon orbing in and out of here willy-nilly, and demons are trying to attack... No, that's not what I mean. I mean, spending the day with another man, while Leo's frozen and all. Piper, it's not a date, he's just a friend of yours. A friend that I used to sleep with. Well, don't sleep with him. Easy solution to that problem. Go have fun. Remember how to do that? My word, this man is a pig. Who are you? I, sir, am your girlfriend's future husband. Nothing. You got anything yet? Yes, I see my new condo with me not in it. - I should just move back here. - Here's what I'm not understanding. If we've identified them and know who they are, why can't we find them? And the Scather demons don't even have telepathic powers. Maybe I was right, maybe Christy does have some power of telepathy and she contacted them. You know, maybe she's suffering from that Stockholm syndrome thing. Well, possibly, but it doesn't explain why we can't find the demons. Oh, God, maybe we should have accepted Simon's help. Oh, are you still thinking about the Brit? No, I'm not thinking about him. He just may have had a point, that's all. The age-old question, to date or not to date a mortal. I just keep thinking, if that fireball had been two inches to the left, there would be no Henry to save. Does that make me selfish? Only you can answer that, sweetie. Right. Okay, well, back to the matter at hand. You realise that once we summon them, there is no turning back. They will come. Proceed. Why have you summoned us? How could you let her escape? Why did you not summon us immediately? My lord, we thought we could get her back. You failed us, just as I predicted you would. We didn't fail you. For 15 years we held her for you, and now... We mustn't let our anger get the best of us. We can't lose sight of the bigger picture. There is no bigger picture without the witch, Asmodeus. She is the key. And without her, we can't possibly hope to get the power we need. We should decimate this miserable clan before anything else goes wrong. No, wait. You don't understand. - The witch was rescued by her sister. - So? So they are both under the protection of the Charmed Ones. - The Charmed Ones? - That's why we summoned you. We don't have the power to go up against them. - Neither do we. - Not yet, we don't. Not unless we get the witch back. And if we do, you'd better not lose her again. Look, just because demons use their powers to do bad things doesn't mean all powers are bad. You can use yours for good. Look, you are in the light now, Christy. There is good magic all around you. You just have to believe it. You have to trust it. How? Well, like this. See? It's easy. Just focus on what you want and you can do it. All right, why don't you try now? Come on, don't worry, you can do it. I'll be right here. Come on. Come on. Now, I want you to focus really hard on what you want, okay? See it in your mind's eye. - I did it. - I told you! Whoa, that's a lot, maybe I should put that out. You know, it's not easy having magical powers.</i> But then again, you will never understand that. Where'd you say you're from, again? Sussex, with homes in Devonshire, Manchester, London. And when... When Paige and I are wed... Listen, I told you that's not gonna happen, got that? Paige is my girl. Is it really fair of you to be keeping Paige away from the magical world she's destined to be in? I'm not keeping Paige away from anything. But you are. You see, it is destiny to combine the Marx and Matthews magical line. Once we are a couple, we will be the most powerful force of good the world has ever seen. Well, I think Paige and her sisters are doing fine without you. But I think Paige deserves so much more, and I can give it to her. I'm getting tired of you insinuating that I am not good enough for Paige. I'm not insinuating it, I'm saying it. All right, look, pal, I may be new to this magical world, but I'm not afraid of demons, and I'm definitely not afraid of you. - Not afraid? - No. - Not afraid? - No. I tell you what, let's wait until you've had a fireball thrown at your face and then we'll have a little discussion about how brave you think you are! Already happened this morning. I'm still here. And how embarrassing that must have been. Let me guess, Paige had to heal you. Correct? Yeah. So? So it is only a matter of time before you are beyond healing, leaving poor Paige too devastated to fight the great fight. - You know what? We're finished here. - Are you blind, man? Can't you see that you're a liability in every sense of the word? And the fear of you being blown up will make it impossible for Paige to ever truly be honest with you. Look, pal, I don't know who you are, and I don't really care. You're not getting Paige, you got that? - Really? - Yeah. Well, if you won't listen to reason, then I guess there's only one thing left for us to do. I guess so. What's that? I challenge you to a duel. Are you sure I can't pay him something more for this? No, he's good. Don't worry about it. Well, it doesn't seem right, especially since it was my fault. It's no big deal, he's a fireman. He likes to help people. Is that why you became a fireman? I guess. I mean, it sure ain't the pay. You know, I wanted to call you, stay in touch. But I felt weird after I heard you and Leo got back together. Yeah. Of course. Hey, I don't mean to pry or anything, but I couldn't help notice that he didn't seem to be around. Is everything okay? Yeah, sure. You know, it's great. So is he around? Well, Leo's been away. Away? Away. Excuse me. - Hello? - I think you need to come home. What do you mean? Why? Well, we've ID'd the demons that took Christy, but we can't find them anywhere. Well, they're low-level, they shouldn't be that hard to find. Yeah, we think something is going on, like maybe they're being protected by other demons. More powerful demons. Like who? - What was that? - Hurry. Phoebe? - Phoebe? - Is something wrong? Actually, I need my car now. - But it's not finished. - Oh, that's okay. Do you think you could watch Wyatt for me for a little while? - Yeah, sure. - Okay, thanks, bye. I owe you. Help! Jacket! Oh, my God! Billie, what happened? I cannot believe this, I cannot believe what just happened. What? Christy just attacked me! What? Where is she? Where'd she go? She just left with one of the demons. I don't understand, you guys. Everything was going so well. I mean, she was laughing, we were having fun, and... Oh, I just don't know how this happened. Hang on a second. Start from the beginning. What were you guys doing right before? Well, I was showing her how to control her powers, the same way you guys showed me, and she was getting it. - She was really excited. - And then? And then she started hearing some voices, voices she started talking to. - What was she saying? - First, she wanted them to go away. And then it was something about being the key, or that she didn't wanna be the key or... Wait a minute, what key? To the ultimate power? Excuse me? - Oh, no, not another one. - Yeah, I don't know. Well, that explains why they took her now. And then the weirdest thing happened. She just changed. Her expression got very dark. Then that demon from before showed up and before I knew it, I was on fire. What? Well, it's just, if that's true, the demon that took her didn't have telepathic powers. Which means she had to contact them. That's ridiculous, why would she do that? Because they're all she knows. No. No, that's not what happened, okay? You guys weren't there. Christy and I connected as sisters. So if those demons didn't contact her, then some other demons did, okay? That's a possibility. So, what are we waiting for? How do we find her? Well, I guess we could start by trying to figure out who this Ultimate Power is. And maybe they tie in to how we're supposed to get Leo back. Henry? Paige, what do you know about duels?</i> - Duels, why? - En garde, sir!</i> Wait! What are you doing? I have to go. What the hell? Paige, yes, great. Best for you to see this yourself, first-hand. Now, I know this might look a little extreme, but I am determined to make my point. - Simon, knock it off! - But you see, my dear, I can't. For your sake as well as his, it's far better you face the truth now than later. - Look, for you to be with Harry... - Henry! Whatever. For you to be with him instead of me... ...would be a terrible mistake. I got him right where I want him. All right, you pompous son of a bitch, you think you're the perfect man for Paige just because you know a little magic? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. - You don't know anything about her. - On the contrary, sir, I know everything there is to know about Paige Matthews, thank you. - Where is she ticklish? - Ticklish? Third toe, left foot. Right below the neck. Did you know she only salts popcorn on the right side, never on the left? And every time she watches "The Wizard of Oz," she cries. Every time, did you know that? No, why would you? Because you don't even care. You just want some trophy witch so you can have a nice power couple. I care about Paige. - I love her. - And I love him. Paige. Paige, you can't be serious. Yeah, we're both serious. Beat it, pal. What he said. Cross the pond. I told you I never run from a fight. - Thank you. - Sorry, sorry. That's okay. That's okay. Nothing except stuff about all the other Ultimate Powers we faced. Billie, did Christy say anything else that might be able to help us? She's calling for me, I can hear her. She wants us to reverse the "to call a lost witch" spell so we can come find her. - How does she know about that spell? - It doesn't matter, we're not going. She doesn't want you guys to go, just me. Well, no, it could be a trap. It's not a trap. I trust her. Even though, you know, she did try to kill you? I have to. I can't lose her again. Okay, fine. But if you're not out of there in five minutes, we're coming in to get you. Christy? Are you there? Your sister can't be saved, and neither can you. Christy, help me, please! Don't let them make you do this. You have the power to stop them, use it! Christy, look, we're sisters, okay? They can't come between us, nobody can. Hold your fire. No! We don't want to hurt the key. We can combine our powers together and put an end to this once and for all. We can do this together. Trust me. Surround her. - Well? - It's over. So why did you want to come here? I don't know, it's just kind of... It's, like, our place now, right? I mean, ever since you told me that you were... A witch? It's okay, it's not a bad word, you know. Oh, no. No, not at all. - Henry, are you okay? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, great. Top of the world. Literally, right? - Do you want me to heal that for you? - No. No, I like it. It's like a battle scar, right? It says I fought for my girl and I won. Yes, you certainly did. I mean, I faced demons and fireballs, magical suitors, orbing. I mean, I think I passed the test, right? What test? You love me, don't you? Yes, I love you. Because... Paige, will you marry me? Yes. Hello! - Hi, Mommy. - Hi. Looks like somebody had fun. - Can you say thank you? - Thank you. - We gotta get it back here, kiddo. - There you go. There you go. You're welcome, buddy. Anytime. Hey, why don't you go play and I'll be right there, okay? He's a great kid. Thank you for everything. Oh, it was my pleasure. I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. I mean, no, it's not okay. It's definitely not okay. I just thought, you know, with Leo gone... No, I mean, he's not gone. I didn't say he was gone, he's just... You know, he's away. Okay. Listen, Greg, you're a great guy, really, and if, you know, the situation was different... But Leo is coming back. I understand. Well, it was really great to see you again, Piper. You too. What am I wearing? Oh, that's a John Stamos T-shirt. You were totally obsessed. I was not. Yes, you wanted to marry Mr. Full House.</i> Well, you wanted to marry Pee-wee. No, I didn't. I'm sorry about attacking you. That wasn't me. I was being controlled. I would never hurt you. Oh, stop, I know. I know. Is it really over? I mean, for good? I'm not gonna let anyone take you away ever again. I promise. Phoebe! - You scared me. - What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm eavesdropping. I don't get to do that anymore now that I moved out. Well, stop it! Spoilsport. What's wrong with you? - Your fireman? - No, thank you. Christy. Oh, well, don't worry about her, she's doing fine. That's not what I mean. She's the key, and whatever that means, it can't be good. Well, maybe it is, maybe she's here to help us fight whatever comes next, you know. Maybe they both are. Well, I guess we're just
