Yeah, it's okay. I'll get him a cab home. - Prue still hasn't called? - Nope. Look at that poor guy. You think she stood him up? Not deliberately. I just think that since we've been back from Pilgrim times she's been on a demon bender. You think? You mean because that's all she ever talks about? Yeah. Well, how are we going to explain this to him? Abbey, you better make that a double. I'm going to call Prue. Well, speaking of a big chill, is Leo keeping you warm? Nope. Honey, are you still afraid that they're watching you? Well, what am I supposed to think? The last two times they orbed him out was right in the middle of it. - So, what does he say? - He swears they're not watching. But he's a guy, he'll say anything. The point is that I think they're watching, and when I think, I can't... I can't... I can't concentrate. Well, at least you have the option to concentrate. If Cole and I continue this flirting tango thing, I'm gonna have to start concentrating on myself. - Hello. - Prue. Hey, where are you? Hey, on my way home from work. You will never guess what I found on the Internet. Remember Micah? The 17th-century hottie? That's hard to forget. Okay, enough about the past, tell her about the present. I traced his ancestors and found an entire history of the village we visited. I figure it might give us a clue to the identity of the demon the Triad sent to kill us. Prue, honey, aren't you forgetting something? My photo shoot's not till tomorrow. No, I mean something else. Like your date? Oh, oh, Sean, oh. All right, just give him a drink. If we give him any more, we'll have to send him to an AA meeting. - How long has he been there? - About an hour and 327 peanuts. All right, so, what do I do? Remorse is good, and attendance is better. Piper, I'm halfway across town. Besides, I gotta go home and look up all this demon stuff. - Well, can't it wait? - What, you think the Triad will? We have to get them before they get us. Just tell him I got hung up at work and that I'll make it up to him. Alrighty then. - Is she okay? - I guess. Sean, hi. There's been a slight glitch. Sometimes my sister gets hung up at work and she sort of has - a one-track mind. - It's not a problem. I understand. Tell her just to give me a call. Not a problem. He took that well. He's had three drinks. So when does one-track spill over into total obsession? When you start forgetting about guys like Sean. Here, sweetie. Are you feeling any better? Yeah, I think I was more stunned than hurt, you know. It just happened so fast. It's eerie knowing that somebody went through every room in the house smashing mirrors, touching who knows what. Fondling who knows what. It's just so creepy. At least nothing seems to be missing. How do you know it wasn't a demon? Demons don't usually fondle. And besides, the only demon that we know who used mirrors was Kali and we vanquished her sorry ass. Yeah, by smashing her reflection in a mirror. I mean, I know that she's supposed to be dead, but so were the Grimlocks. - Please don't remind me about them. - Did you find anything? Just a bunch of fingerprints. They don't match your samples. I'll run it through the computer, see if any names pop up. They won't. I mean, hello, guys. Book of Shadows 101, mirrors. The portals through which evil enters. But there are fingerprints and demons don't even usually have fingers. On the human side of things, I need you to put together a grudge list of any enemies that you have, past or present. Already done. Let's see, Abraxas, Barbas, Yama. What did you do, date the United Nations? It's the demons, warlocks and various evil forces that we've faced in the last two years. That's not exactly what I meant. Okay, I'm gonna go hit the Book of Shadows and see if I can find anything about mirrors. Prue's been a little fixated lately. Do you think it was a human bad guy? Any other house, yeah. Around here, you never know. Piper. Phoebe. What? What is it? That door was unlocked. So? Ever since a demon tried to steal the Book of Shadows a couple weeks ago, I've been locking it. You lock this door, but you don't lock the front door. I lock the front door. - Me too. Mostly. - I don't, why bother? Because you're three young women. In fact, your whole attitude about security baffles me. You have no alarm system, no dead bolts, no dog. Darryl, we're three witches. I think we can handle it. It wasn't jimmied. So, what, you think we're dealing with a lock-picking demon, Prue? It doesn't look like anything is missing from up here either. I just think it's ludicrous to rule out that a human could have done this. Yes, well, I think it's ludicrous to think that the Triad has nothing to do with it. Darryl, why don't you go check on those fingerprints. We need to have a little conference here. - Okay. Good night. - Night. Leo. Prue, maybe a little perspective here for a second. Leo. What? What is it? What is the problem? I need to know everything that you know about the Triad. You what? - Hi. - Hi. Okay, well, this really can't wait. The Triad sent somebody back in time and nearly wiped out our entire line. I'm willing to bet it's the same demon we found up here a couple weeks ago. If you don't wanna take that seriously, that's your business. Me, I'm on a mission. We really need to get her laid, huh? Hi. I think I'm gonna go see what Prue is up to. So? We grow impatient, Belthazor. We did not expect it to take this long. You had two years by their time, without success. I've had a month. A month with two years' worth of information. Information collected by the blood of demons before you. The young one, Phoebe, is almost within my grasp. That's not why we summoned you. We're assigning another. You're replacing me? We had a bargain. I get the Charmed Ones, you give me back... The bargain is in your best interests, not ours. Don't look at it as replacement, Belthazor. Look at it as assistance. However, if either of you should be caught, the same maxims apply. We can't risk either of you leading the Charmed Ones to us. - May I know who you're sending? - Sent, you mean. Troxa has already started. - Leo? - Piper. - We can't. - Yes, we can. No, I can't. I feel like I'm being watched. - Piper, we have to get past this. - Yeah. Okay. How about you tell them to look the other way? They're not looking. How many times do we have to have this conversation? Well, how do you know? How can you be sure? Because I told you, that's not what they do. Okay, then how do you explain the last two times? Count them, two. Sheer coincidence, I'm telling you. Now, come on, Piper. We need to get past this. Yeah, and I need to feel like it's just you and me, and not the whole universe watching. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I guess I better go find Prue some answers. Yeah. Cole, what are you doing here? - Are you all right? I just heard. - Heard what? About what happened, the break-in. You guys okay? You came all the way over here for me? I mean, for we? - For us? - Did you get a look at who it was? No. I'm gonna make a call, get a patrol car to watch the place. That's all right. Actually, I think that we can handle it. No, you can't. You have no idea what kind of evil you're dealing with here. Yes, well, we were actually just discussing that, weren't we, Prue? Do you want anything, Cole? Do you want some coffee or something? Phoebe, that's not really a good idea. We have something very important that we have to discuss. That's all right. I really should get going anyway. It's late. l... Call me anytime. Yeah, I will. Thanks. Okay, this better be good. Yeah, well, I was up in the attic, and when I woke up, there was a pillow hovering above my face about to smother me. - A pillow? - Hovering. Well, that must be the infamous pillow-smothering demon. - Maybe it was a nightmare. - It wasn't a nightmare and it certainly wasn't a joke. There is a demon after me or us. I know it. Okay. Come out, come out, wherever you are. What do you think the Triad will say when I tell them you saved the witches? That I didn't want you to get them first. You had your chances, Belthazor. Don't screw up mine again. I strike tomorrow night. You better not be there. You don't scare me, Troxa. You never did. And you don't know how to defeat me, Belthazor. You never could. After all... ...you can't fight what you can't see. Give me a hit of that. Actually, no, just pour it down my throat. - You didn't sleep either? - Not a wink. Thank God for makeup. Hey, maybe we should get an alarm system. Hey, Pheebs, did you borrow Gram's necklace again? - No. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive, why? What about my good-luck blouse, have you seen it? The fuchsia paisley one? - Is there anything else missing? - Not that I know of. Prue, this is important. Maybe the guy that broke into the house took them. Yeah, or maybe it was a demon who took them for some weird ritualistic ceremony. Now, would that be the pillow-smothering demon, or the lock-picking demon? They called me away on something else, Piper, it was a total coincidence. They don't know much about the Triad. They don't even know what it really is. Six thousand years of conflict, and that's it? These guys are serious underachievers. They do know, though, the Triad is at the highest level of the other side. - Okay, that's a biggie. - That's why we need to get to them before they get to us. - What is this? - A way to always be prepared. These are very big contraceptives, Prue. They are sneakers, all right? We're always wearing inappropriate footwear when demons attack. Now we will be prepared. Keep them with you at all times. I'm gonna be so fast in these. - Hi. - Hi. We're making progress. The same set of fingerprints were found - on all the broken mirrors. - Whose are they? Unfortunately, the FBI computer came up with a blank. This means the perp had no criminal record. So, what does that mean, it's some weird, crazy person? I can't say. I don't have enough to go on. I mean, we got broken mirrors, - and nothing's missing. - Actually, there is stuff missing. Our grandmother's necklace and Prue's favourite shirt. It's funny that's the only thing he took. You know, there's another possibility. Could be a stalker. - A stalker? - Who would want to stalk us? Could be anybody. I need you to get a human grudge list together. Old classmates, people you work with or for, old boyfriends. - Hey, what about Sean? - A guy that I stood up once? - I don't think so. - The smallest things - could set these guys off. - All right, if it's a stalker, it's a demonic stalker. In any case, I'm going to check out this Sean guy. I need that grudge list ASAP. Stalkers will do anything to obtain the object of their desire. - You could be in real danger, Prue. - Thanks. Bye. You need to listen to him, Prue. Why? No one listens to me. Here, I gotta go. If the demon doesn't kill me, my editor will. - Excuse me, your mail, Mr. Jones. - Great, thank you very much. - The Lewis family, all right? - Yeah, I will. Hey. I did some research, Troxa. I found your Achilles' heel. Cold is very revealing for you. All the worse because since you can't feel, you don't even know when it's cold. First them, then you. Just do what you normally do on your TV show, okay? Just pretend that I'm the audience. Okay, right, Jillaroo. Now, the Australian black snake won't just run out of the bush and strike at you for no good reason. They strike as a defence mechanism. That's the only way they can protect themselves. Now, you may wonder how we entice this little beaut out of the wild to join us today. Over here. The only humane way to capture a snake is to use a snake trap. You lure them in with a ripping snake snack. Like a tiny Mickey Mouse or a froggie. What did you say the cage was used for again? Trapping snakes, or any other varmints you might wanna get rid of. - Really? - Yeah. Go on, beaut. - Hey, Abbey. Abbey, hi. - Hi. - Have you seen Cole? - Who? Tall, dark, good-Iooking district attorney. Okay, no good. How about an easy one. Where's Piper? - She's in back in the office. - Okay, thanks. I should have knocked. I'm sorry. It's okay. I can't do it anyway. I am so sorry to hear that. - I guess I'd better go. - Yeah. I'm so tired of living under this scrutiny. I told you I didn't see anything. - Not you, them. - I know. I thought doing it somewhere else would take the pressure off. I'm bummed for you, Piper. I really am, but I gotta tell you Leo is looking fine. - I thought you didn't see anything. - Nothing good. Okay, here is my stalker list. It's mostly guys that I knew when I was in New York. You were busy in New York. Yeah. So now that we have mine and yours, all we need is... - You look different. - Relaxed. - What happened? - I'm just not as worried about demons as much anymore. Have you guys seen Sean around? No, I haven't. But how do you know he's not your stalker? - Don't be ridiculous. - What happened to - "There's a demon on my ass" Prue? - Well, I set a trap. A trap? We are going to catch this demon and instead of vanquishing him like we normally do, we'll make him talk about the Triad. So is this like a bear trap with big claws? I cast a spell over a series of siderite crystals, sort of creating a power grid, with the Book of Shadows as the bait. And how does that work? Well, the minute the demon steps into the grid, this glows and he's zapped. So whatever it is, is electrocuted. - Well, yeah, whatever demon. - And what about human or feline? You're gonna fry Kit. Well, Kit can't get in because I locked the attic door. So, Prue, you've booby-trapped our house. And again, what if it's human? It's not. All right, if you guys will excuse me, I have a life to try and go live. - This is not good. - No, and if she keeps this up, we're gonna have to do a demon intervention. - Hi. - Hey. Thanks for coming. Abbey, whatever Sean wants to drink, can you just...? No, thanks. I've had more than my share of free drinks. All right. Well, I guess I deserve that. Look, Sean... ...there's so much going on in my life that I can't really explain, but... ...if you're interested, I'd like to make it up to you. I'm definitely interested... ...but I just ask that you be honest with me. The one thing I can't handle is games. Drives me crazy. - Psycho, freaky crazy? - What? Never mind. Phoebe. Anybody home? - What the hell is that? - Oh, it worked. - What worked? - All right, it worked. It worked. We caught our demon. So let's go. We don't know what kind of demon this is, so we have to go in attacking. Piper, you freeze him, and I will tie him up. Speaking of freezing, it's freezing in here. That's because every window in the house is open. - What kind of demon would do that? - Who cares? - Everybody got their sneakers on? - Yeah, yeah. All right. - Cole? - What? Wait. It could be dangerous. For God sakes, Prue, he looks really hurt. Phoebe, it's a trap for demons, you do the math. What are you doing here? Came by to see how you were doing. Are you okay? So how did you get in and what are you doing up here? Front door was unlocked. Then when I saw the windows were open... You thought that someone broke into the house again. Is the third degree over now? What happened? What's that? - It's a trap. - A what? Cole, I am so sorry. Please forgive us. - I'll take that under advisement. - Prue just panicked. - She wasn't thinking straight. - The hell I wasn't! Do you know that your trap is the equivalent of having a loaded shotgun with a tripwire behind your front door? That's illegal. I'm an ADA, an officer of the court. I could have you arrested. Somebody turned on the air conditioning. Why would they do that? I'm out of here. Cole. Cole. I am so sorry. It's just, we've all been under so much pressure lately. I'm just glad it wasn't you who did this to me. How could you? How far are you gonna let this obsession go, Prue? - Phoebe, listen. - No, I'm not gonna listen. You didn't nearly catch a demon, you nearly killed a district attorney. My district attorney. How do you know we didn't catch a demon? I mean, think about it, Phoebe. He is always around when something is going on. I mean, look at tonight. You're right. He's a plant. Trying to get close to me so he can kill us. Now is everyone a demon, Prue? You are crazy right now. Prue? You have a lovely package from Sean, and it looks like flowers. Pretty nice for a guy you've blown off twice. That's disgusting. Look out. Look out. There's your demon, Prue. I'm gonna call Morris. Piper, that doesn't really make any sense. I mean, I cannot believe I hurt that guy that badly. Darryl said it only takes a small thing to set them off. Maybe Phoebe's right, maybe you're just not seeing the reality. Piper, my instincts are almost always right, I have to trust them. You have to trust them, and I'm not saying that you shouldn't. But, Prue, there are other evils in the world. And some of them are even human. - I warned you, Belthazor. - Hold it. Troxa, cool your jets. I came to apologize. Apologize, for what? Pissing you off, for one thing. I don't want to be always looking over my shoulder, waiting for you to strike for the rest of eternity. You want the Charmed Ones, they're all yours. I don't trust you. Fine, don't. Just don't blame your failure on me to the Triad. By the way, the key to getting them is in the Book of Shadows. It's up in the attic. - Be careful. - You know what? I don't care. I'm just so mad at Prue. I mean, it's one thing to be obsessive, you know, but it's another thing to hurt innocent people. Okay, but she is trying to look out for us. There is a Triad demon on the loose. I understand that, Piper, but it is not Cole. Oh, honey, that's sweet, but not tonight. We all have headaches. Okay. But feel free to help us close some windows. Tell me everything that you know about the Triad. Who they are, what their plans are. Answer me. You'll get nothing from me, witch. I am Troxa. But I'm not the only agent the Triad has sent after you. There is another. His name is Belthazor! All right, what the hell happened? - The Triad. - Wait, they know where we live now? No, they'd know where he is, or was. All that matters is he's gone. You were right, Prue. I owe you a big apology. I'm sorry I doubted you, but I was worried... It's all right, let's just... Let's look him up. "Troxa, an invisible demon whose weakness is that his ectoplasmic biochemistry is sensitive to cold. May become partially visible." Wait a second. So if someone hadn't turned on the AC, opened all the windows and made it freezing in here, - I never would have seen him. Leo? - I don't know anything about it at all. Does that mean we have another guardian angel? I hope. What I've heard about Belthazor, we'll need a lot of help. - What do you mean? - Well, he's infamous. He's a demonic soldier of fortune. He's one of the most evil, vile creatures there is. Wait, that's the demon we saw try to take the Book of Shadows - a couple of weeks ago. - So Troxa's right. There's somebody else out there to get us. Well, at least now we know who he is. But we're safe for now. So I'm gonna take this rare opportunity to get a good night's sleep. Well, I'll go see what I can find out about Belthazor. Enjoy your candy. - Thank you. - Sure. Are you gonna be able to get some rest now? No, I am way too wired, and also my photo assignment is due tomorrow. - Cole. - Right. Well, you know, I had to fill in something. Do you think maybe tomorrow you could call Cole and apologize to him? Yeah. I've gotta meet Marvelous 3 this afternoon. So I need to get some stuff ready. Can I drop you off? - Hello? Anybody home? - Yeah. I was just thinking, there are still so many loose ends. I mean the broken mirrors, the AC, the open windows, the dead flowers, the stuff that's missing. Are you obsessing now? It's over. We were wrong. I know, but those aren't demonic things, they're things that a stalker might do, like what Morris said. Well, we told him about Sean, he'll figure it out. Yeah. Sean. Where's our copy of the grudge list that we made for Morris? - I left it at the club. Why? - I just... I want to look it over again. Okay. Well, let's go. Is Prue still sleeping? Her bed is made and her car is not here. Well, maybe she took her pictures to 415. It's really early. I mean, is 415 even open yet? I'm gonna call her. - Hello? - It's me. I'm just checking in. - Where are you? - I'm in my car. Hello. Prue, I can barely hear you. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, I'll see you later, honey. Bye. - She sounds fine. - Okay. Okay, let's go. Bye-bye. It's just you and me now, Prue. Your sisters are gone. - What do you want? - Oh, Prue. Isn't it obvious what I want? Huh? I want to be you. What? No witty comeback? No confident "I'm the queen of the world" retort? - Abbey. - No, you're wrong. Abbey's gone forever. She's a loser and you're a winner. And now, I'm gonna be a winner too. As soon as I take care of you. Did you like the dead roses I sent you? Did you even know I was the one who broke into your house? I have to be you. Oh, I love wearing your clothes. Your things. Makes me wanna be you even more. Beautiful, successful. Loved by men. I have just as much trouble with men as anyone. What, you mean Sean? Oh, please. He's not good enough for us. No. No. I can do better... ...without you around. Now I just have one last question. Last night, when I was here, when I was running away from you, how the hell did you throw me through that door, huh? Like this. - P3. - Piper? Hey. Hey, where's Prue? I can't reach her anywhere. At the manor, on the cell. That's weird. We just talked to her on her cell. Why? What's going on? I got a match off those fingerprints. - Sean? - No, no, not Sean. Abbey, your bartender. The one off of your list. What? Abbey? Why would Abbey want to hurt Prue? - Abbey's hurt Prue? - Hold on. Wait. Okay, and that's the kind of perfume Prue wears, and the cosmetics that she uses. "October 27, 8:01, Prue leaves the house, gets into car. I love the way she walks, so confident and controlled. Enters dry-cleaner's smiling, the sun catches her hair, so beautiful." Pages and pictures. - What? - Abbey killing Prue at the manor. Hey, over here. Hey, freak, I'm over here now. Come out here! You okay? We're here. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything will be great, as soon as I fire her. Okay. Nice. - Feel better now? - Yeah, I'm getting there. All right. Shake it off. Thanks. Rachel, can I ask you a question? - Yeah. - Are you happy? - Extremely. - Boyfriend? Any career goals? Engaged. I'm only doing this until I get my masters in education. Then I'm gonna be a teacher. - That is just so excellent. - Thank you. Thanks. You know, you can never be too careful with demons or mortals. So rumour has it Leo is installing an alarm system in the house? Yeah, I know. We're gonna have to lock the doors and do all that responsible stuff that women should do in the big city. I agree. And we're gonna have to watch out for Belthazor. Yes, I agree. But first, I think you should kind of watch out for him. - You don't like him, do you? - No, I don't... ...really know him. Do you? No, not as well as I'd like to. Actually, I think I'm gonna go see what I can do about that. Be careful. Hey. Why do I get the feeling you're a high-maintenance kind of gal? I don't know, maybe because I am. Dance? So. Still friends? I hope we're more than that. Do you? Prove it. You are amazing
