Chef Moore, he of the phoney accents. Hires me and then quits to open his own place? Thank you very much. I don't see any customers complaining. Hello. I am not a restauranteur. I am a chef. I have no idea what I'm doing. Are you wearing my dress? Hey, Brittany. I love that tattoo. - Thanks. - I thought it was illegal to get them on your hand because of the veins? In the States, yeah. I got it done in Tahiti. Keep the change, Piper. I gotta jam. - Okay, say hi to Max. - Okay. Table nine, please. Now back to my dress. Okay, see that poster boy to your left? Just glance, don't be obvious. I approve. Who is he? His name is Alec, and he's about to come over and ask if he could buy me a martini. How do you know? Let's just say I solved the age-old problem of who approaches whom first. - I had a little premonition. - What? Phoebe, you're not supposed to use your powers, we agreed. No, you and Prue agreed. I abstained. Besides, it's not like I can control it. It just... It popped into my head. That's the whole point. None of us can control our powers. That's what scares me. I could panic and freeze the entire restaurant. Here he comes. - Hi. - Oh, hello. I was just sitting over there, wondering if I could buy you a martini or something? Martini. Imagine that. I would love one. It's Alec, right? Yeah. How'd you know my name? Wild guess. Do you wanna grab a table? Prue is gonna be pissed. News flash: Stop worrying. You'll get wrinkles. Prue? Proving that they were the devil's disciples</i> was no easy task for the court at the Salem witch trials.</i> But a remarkable event occurred. One of the accused, Mary Easty, ran for the church to profess her innocence.</i> Suddenly, there was a clap of thunder,</i> and she was struck by a bolt of lightning.</i> In the court's mind, God himself had spoken, forbidding the evil witch from even entering his house.</i> The witches were subsequently convicted of heresy</i> - and burned alive at the stake. - Morning.</i> - What are you watching? - Nothing. - Just a show. - About witches? Are you worried that we're gonna be burned at the stake? Yeah, right. By the way, Andy called. - When? - While you were in the shower. - What did you tell him? - That you were in the shower. Bad date? No. No. No, not at all. It was great. You know, dinner, movie. - Sex. - Excuse me? On your first date? You sleaze. It wasn't exactly our first date, Piper. High school doesn't count. That was last decade. Spill it. - Oh, that bad, huh? - No. Actually, that good. It was... Well, we were amazing. But that's not that point. I told myself things would be different. That we would take it slow. It just shouldn't have happened. - What shouldn't? - Prue slept with Andy. - Hello. - Thanks a lot, mouth. Wait, you were gonna tell her but not me? Family meeting. Speaking of last night, what time did you end up rolling in? No, no, no. Do not change the subject. - Don't dodge the question. - It must've been at least after 3. I must still be on New York time. Actually, that would make it later. - Or maybe you and Alec... - Who's Alec? Some hottie she hit on in the restaurant. Excuse me, revisionist history. He hit on me. Remember the whole vision thing? Vision thing? Please tell me you didn't use your powers. Don't put me in the middle. I'm not, you were born in the middle. Look, I thought that we agreed. No. We didn't. You agreed. You laid down the law. There's a difference. Look, Phoebe, our powers are not toys. We have to be careful. They could get us killed. She's right, we don't want any more warlocks finding us. Look, it was just a lousy premonition, that's all. Nobody died. Besides, you guys can't control your powers any better than I can. And, FYI, nothing happened last night. At least nothing I'm ashamed of. There's another reason we have to be careful. Andy thinks someone's abducting women in our area. Abducting women, what do you mean? It means that warlocks aren't the only evil that we have to watch out for. And, FYI, I'm not ashamed of anything. She didn't come home at all last night. That's not like Brittany, believe me. Tell me, Max, what time did she leave to go to Quake? Eight, 8:30. She called around 10, said she was headed home. But I'm really worried. Chances are, she'll show up. They usually do. In the meantime, the best thing you can do right now is to go home in case she calls, all right? - Will you do that? - Yeah, okay. Thanks. Fourth one this week. Yeah, well, they can't just be disappearing into thin air. You did something to your hair. At least we've narrowed down his feeding pool to the area around the restaurant. Well, better tell your sweetie to lock the door tonight. Pastor Williams. - Oh, you scared me. - I'm sorry. Aren't you a little early? Dropping off the unused food from your restaurant? I thought you weren't coming by till this afternoon? Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm coming back later with everything. Great. So, what are you doing here now? Nothing, really. Just thinking. About? - Mary Easty. - Who? It's just a stupid documentary I saw. By the way, is it true that evil beings can't go into a church without being: Evil beings. You mean, like, what, vampires? Vampires. No. I was thinking more along the lines of witches. Witches, huh? Let me put it to you this way. I sure wouldn't wanna risk it. I gotta go. I'll see you later? Yeah. Right. Absolutely. Hold the doors. Damn it. Can you push 12, please? Here, let me help. Eighteenth-century French art. You work at the auction house? No, just interviewing, if I ever get there on time. Don't wanna get my King Louises mixed up. Hello? Andy, how did you get this number? I'm a detective, remember? Prue, I think we should talk. Yeah, you know it's just that I'm really late for this interview. I didn't mean for what happened last night to happen, Prue. Of course, I'm, you know, totally wrong for it anyway. Stuffy old auction house. Don't know why they even called. Come on, Prue. Listen to me. We've known each other for a long time.</i> We just couldn't help ourselves. - It's nothing to be ashamed of. - I know, Andy. All we did was make love. I know, Andy. Then talk to me, help me out here, Prue. Why'd you sneak out like that? I did not sneak... ...out. Right, you were asleep, I didn't wanna wake you. And I did write you a note, I just didn't leave it. Hello? Hello? Hey. Hey, it missed my... It skipped my floor. - Can't believe... - Hit it again. That was strange. - Lucky you, huh? - Yeah, I'm charmed, all right. - Here you go. Thanks. - Thank you. Excuse me... ...but aren't you Stefan? Yes. - I'm sorry, do we know each other? - Highly doubtful. I'm just familiar with your work. Like everyone else in the world. Well, I don't know about that. But I'll always take a compliment from a gorgeous woman. I'm sure your girlfriend must appreciate that. She's not my girlfriend. Then why are you whispering? Excuse me. - Oh, okay. - I'll be in the car. Well, it was really nice meeting you. You too. Listen, listen. I'm in town for a couple of days doing a Porsche shoot. If you're interested, stop by. I would love to photograph you. You do model, don't you? In my dreams, yeah. A driver called in sick, can you do a delivery? Sure. Is that guy at the bar staring at me? A lot of guys at the bar are staring at you. The one at the far end. Tall, dark, brooding. Very New York. Sorry, no. He's seen your résumé and is very impressed. Although I have to tell you, he's already blown out six applicants. I still don't know why he's interested. I never even applied. He likes what you did at the museum. Even though your ex-boss trashed you. I mean, what's Roger got against you anyway? Hard to say, unless shattering his male ego counts for something. He's also my ex-fiancé. Got it. You ready? Yeah. Rex Buckland, this is Prue Halliwell, interviewing for the new specialist. Actually, we've already met. But welcome to my stuffy old auction house. Please, I beg you, don't hurt me. Let me go! Please, Stefan. It's Javna. Oh, my God. Wait! How many exhibitions did you curate? Seven, including the Carlton estate. It should be on my résumé. Franklin Carlton. That's quite a coup. I tend to be on the persistent side. I usually get what I want. I don't doubt it. It's a shame, though, that you think you're... How did you put it in the elevator? "Totally wrong for the job." That was a private phone conversation. Hardly. You called me, remember? Not the other way around. While we're at it, it's incredibly unfair of you to eavesdrop on a private call and then misjudge me, based entirely on what you thought you heard. I apologise. It was unfair of me. I'm new at all this. I've only just taken over the house from my father, so I'm very protective of it. But, you know, I liked what you did at the museum, attracting a younger market. I mean, it's totally consistent with what I wanna do here. It's just that, you know, all these qualifications aside, it's very important to me that whoever I hire truly wants to be here. - Yeah? - Excuse me, Mr Buckland.</i> Your next interview is waiting. Should I reschedule him? No, I think we're done here. Well, thanks for your time. My area of expertise ranges from Ming dynasty to a Mark McGwire rookie baseball card. You name it, I can identify it. Now, I may not have sought this job originally, but I do want it. And I am definitely right for it. You would think after last night Prue would be a lot mellower. I mean, how long had it been? Six months? And she's worse. It's just so un-Prue-like to have sex on the first date. I mean, everything's changing since we've become... - Great, thank you. - You know. Come on, you never had sex on the first date? No. Have you? - Don't answer that. - Well, it's not a regular thing. Of course, now that I'm a witch, I can see if it's gonna be any good or not before it actually... Hi. What's the matter with you, are you out of your mind? Come on, it's not like he took me literally. You don't know that. He could've. I just think we need to be extra careful. In bed and out. Okay, well, there's careful, and then there's paranoid. - Do you wanna talk about it? - Talk about what? Hey, Phoebe, I didn't know you were back in town. Hey. Take a bite out of the Big Apple, did you? I ate the worm. I'm gonna get some gum. You guys want anything? - No, thanks. - Good to see you. You too. Okay, here's the deal. I've got this friend. Has a little problem, could be bad. Not quite sure what to tell her. - You wanna go inside? - No. I mean, I've gotta get going. So, what's her problem? Well, she kind of, sort of thinks she might be a witch. Witches again, huh? It's not a good thing, is it? Certainly not a question I get every day. How well do you remember your Sunday school lessons? Exodus 22:18. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. - Meaning? - If you go by the old school, it means put her to death. She's evil. - Here you go. - $3.52. Should we use the grandchildren's birthdays? It's a $10 million jackpot. Who knows, I mean, today may be our lucky day. - It may be. - If not, we're gonna lose our house. Four, 16, 19, 30, 32 and 40. Those are the winning numbers. Yeah, yeah. Right, lady. You want this stuff, or don't you? Four, 16, 19, 30, 32, and 40. Trust me, mister, today is your lucky day. You know, I think I'll buy one of these lottery tickets too. Ready? Let's go. - What are you smiling about? - Nothing. What do you want me to say? Something just does not feel right to me about this. I can't help it. - Here we go again. - I mean, where are they, right? What's this guy doing with these poor women? Thinking alien abduction, are you? I'm serious, Morris. I know. That's what scares me. Let me guess. Favourite movie growing up. Ghostbusters? Am I right? Look, we got a crazy, Trudeau. Likes the pretty ladies. That's it, the end. If he comes back looking for more, we're gonna grab him, tag him, make the world a safer place. That too hard to follow? Evil Dead 2. Favourite movie growing up, just for the record. Bank across the street. I think we should grab the ATM tapes and see... Whoa. Where you going? No, no. Forget it, Romeo. You're not blowing our cover. Come on, Morris, cut me some slack. I have to talk to her. Please? Five minutes, that's all I need. Cindy, come on, your salmon's up. Hector, way behind, we need clean plates. You didn't give Andy my cell phone number, did you? - No, why? - Never mind. Remind me, I wanted to do this for a living, right? Looks like you're the only one who'll be doing anything for a living. I think I blew my interview. I can't imagine you were less than stellar. - What is Phoebe doing here? - Flirting. Yeah, and she's wearing Armani. Where did she get that? Not from my closet. Gotta go. Prue, hi. This is my other sister. Prue, this is Stefan, the photographer. - Pleasure. - Likewise. Nice dress. Don't worry, it's not yours. I know, I could never afford it. Will you excuse me for one minute? I'll be right back. You charged it? How are you gonna pay? - You're broke. - Not for long. What does that mean? - You didn't use your powers again. - Maybe. Are you telling me you haven't? No, I'm not telling you that, but we're not talking about me, are we? - What are you guys doing in here? - Same thing we do at home. What, did you go to the track, play the market, what? - The lottery. - Phoebe! What did you want me to do, ignore the premonition? Not help a needy family? That's what we're supposed to do, right? No, we are not supposed to use our powers for our own personal gain. That is what it says in the Book of Shadows.</i> - Not so loud. - You said we needed money, right? - Well, I'm getting some. - Come on, you guys. - So get a job like everybody else. - I'm using my mind instead. Prue. Watch it! Oh, no. No, no, no. - Not again. - Now look at what you've done. This is my fault? - You guys aren't frozen? - Guess it doesn't work on witches. Piper, how long does it last? I don't know. Not long. - It doesn't work out there either. - Oh, tell me this isn't happening. Calm down, it's okay. It's all gonna be okay. God. Andy's partner came in, and he's headed this way. - What are we gonna do? - Stall him. Hey, Inspector Morris, right? That's right. Is Trudeau in there? - Andy? I don't know, is he? - Hostess said he... Okay, breathe, Piper, breathe. - Excuse me. - I have not... Wait. I really think we should... ...talk. What are you doing here? I had five minutes. Yeah, I gave you ten. How...? Guys, you know, we're really busy in here. - Yeah, sure. - I'll call you later, I promise. - Okay. Good. - Okay. Bye. I hate being a witch. Hey. What are you doing? Reading. Thinking. About what? About how totally screwed we are now that we're witches. Oh, that. You don't understand. You don't think we are. You're never afraid of anything. I envy that about you, always have. Yeah, well, don't, because it gets me into trouble sometimes. Piper, talk to me. I don't know. It's just, our whole lives, we've been like everybody else. Rushing off to work, going out on bad dates, buying shoes. Then, suddenly, we wake up one day and everything is different. We're witches now. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Are you kidding? It's a great thing. We don't know that. We don't know anything about these powers. Why we have them, what they mean, where they even come from. I mean, how do we know it's not...? How do we know it's not from evil? Piper, we've been through this. We're good witches. How do we know? What about Jeremy? What about all the other warlocks he said would be coming after us? How do we know we're not just like them? That is what scares me. We don't know. I just... I just wanna be normal again, as messed up as that was. Is that too much to ask for? Piper, listen to me. You are the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. No, I mean that, you are. You're always there to help anybody, even strangers. You've been doing it your whole life. So there's no way that you've been given this... This gift... ...if it wasn't to do good things with it. To protect the innocent, just like the Book of Shadows says. Besides, if anyone should be concerned with being bad, it's me, right? You've got nothing to be afraid of. I gotta run. I am going to get my picture taken. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Look... - Andy. - You go first. - Go ahead. I'm not sorry it happened, Prue. Well, I have to be honest with you, Andy, I am. I mean, not because I didn't enjoy it. I did. Especially the... Yeah, that was great. Yeah. And, of course, there was the... That was nice too. Yeah, but, you know, that's not the point. It's... I haven't seen you in almost seven years... ...and to start right back where we left off is... I know, I know, believe me. I just wanna know why you left, that's all. Why can't you tell me? What's the big secret? - Believe me, you don't wanna know. - Try me. Well... ...my life, it's gotten a little complicated. And I just don't think that I should get involved in anything right now. Prue, we had sex. It doesn't mean we have to elope. Okay. How about this? Why don't we just pretend like it never happened? Do you want me to toss you a life preserver now or just let you sink on your own? No, no. I'm serious. We'll just count that one as part of our old relationship. We'll slow down, we'll start over. Prue, we've been given a second chance here. I don't wanna blow it this time. - Dating in the '90s. - Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, absolutely, I'm sure that I can make that. Okay, thanks. That was the auction house. They want me to come back in for a second interview. I've gotta go. Just give me a little time to think things through, okay? I have nothing to be afraid of. I have nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. Nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. I'm good! - Brittany? - You know me? Is that my name? Prue, thank you for coming back. Well, thanks for having me back, although I must admit I didn't expect it. I told you I was interested, and I am. But first of all, I'd just like to test your expertise, if you don't mind. Let's see how good your really are. Careful, watch your step. This is Hannah Webster, one of our assistant specialists. - This is Prue Halliwell. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Please, tell us about this piece. Well, Madonna of the Meadow. Giovanni Bellini, 16th century. Fabulous piece. Worth $3, 4 million easily if it wasn't a copy. What makes you think it's a copy? Too well-preserved. No yellowing. Besides, the frame support is in pine, and Italian painters used poplar back then. What about this one? Degas. Actually, this was the only sculpture he exhibited himself. Watch out. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. You sure? I'm sorry. I can't believe that happened. No, it's okay. Well, I really don't know what to say. Except you're hired, if you still want the job. - Are you serious? - Can you start Monday? - Yeah, absolutely. - Terrific. It's done, then. Yeah, we can sort out the details when you come in. In the meantime, welcome aboard. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye. Well, what do you think? I think either she's the luckiest woman alive, or she's a witch. Piper? Phoebe? - Guess what. - What? Prue, thank God you're home. Yeah, who...? Here you go, Brittany. Why don't you go sit down at the table, okay? There you go. Sorry, Brittany? You're not gonna believe this. I'm not sure I do. I think... No, I know. This woman is Brittany Reynolds. Yeah, right, Piper, and I'm Rosie O'Donnell. No, I mean it. Brittany has a tattoo, right? An angel on her right hand, remember? - That can't be. - That's what I thought at first. But then I started asking her some questions, things only Brittany would know. She may be senile, but it was enough to convince me. Stefan, it's me, Phoebe. Piper, what are you talking about? I'm telling you, I saw something about it in the Book of Shadows.</i> Okay, look, see. "Javna feeds one week out of every year, stealing the life force from the young." "By invoking a black-magic power of the evil eye to gain eternal youth." It's gotta be what happened to Brittany. Yeah, but there must be some incantation to reverse it somehow. There is. The Hand of Fatima. It says that the prophet Muhammad invoked it centuries ago to banish Javna back to wherever the hell he came from. Yeah, well, the problem is, we don't know who Javna really is, let alone where he is. Brittany? Oh, my God. What happened? - Brittany, are you all right? - I'll call 911. And tell them what, that she's dying of old age at 25? What is it? It's a cocktail napkin from my restaurant. With Stefan's address on the back. Javna. Prue, that's where Phoebe went. Look at this, ATM tape caught the first victim. And she's leaving with that photographer, Stefan. Yeah, jives with the last place she was seen before she disappeared. Is he on our suspect list? Just moved to the top. God bless ATMs. Please, Stefan, or whoever you are, let me go. It's Javna. - You see anything? - No. - Prue. - Look, we'll find her. Maybe we should call the police. If Javna has her, only we can stop him. But we need Phoebe to do it. The incantation only works with the three of us. Piper. We need you. We don't have a lot of time, okay? Prue, grab the mirror! Now. Evil eyes look unto thee May they soon extinguished be</i> Bend thy will to the power of three Eye of earth, evil and accursed You can't stop me. I will live forever. No! Evil eyes look unto thee May they soon extinguished be</i> Bend thy will to the power of three Eye of earth, evil and accursed Very cool. What the hell? Prue? What are you doing here? Well, we were just trying to get the van started. Yeah, Phoebe called, she was having car trouble. Stefan was gonna take some pictures of me. Do you have any idea how lucky you are? This guy's the stalker. No sign of him inside. His car's here, so he might still be around. Stay with them. Excuse me. Hey, how about that? You fixed it. How about that? Maybe we should go. Good idea. Thanks. Call me? Sure. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, how are you? Do you know that girl? I almost was that girl. She was one of Stefan's victims. Obviously doesn't remember. - Lucky her. - No, lucky me. I learned my lesson. I've got to be more careful. Excuse me, did I just hear right? Did she actually admit to doing something wrong? - That's what I heard. - Frame it, it won't happen again. At least we helped those people. I mean, it's nice to know our powers really are good. Yeah, good for everything but our love lives, unfortunately. Although I must admit, they do come in handy once in a while. Hypocrite. And last night's winning lotto numbers were</i> - four, 16... - The winning numbers.</i> I won. Well, I did. See, I told you. You can't intentionally use the powers for your own personal gain, remember? It's a good thing I didn't take the tags off that dress. Oh, well, at least the old couple
