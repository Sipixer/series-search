What are you doing? Buddy... Wyatt, you know better than that. No, sweetie. What do you want, a time-out on your birthday? Come on, baby. Sweetie, come on. I know you're upset, all right? But everything's gonna be okay, all right? Everything's gonna be just fine. Mommy's here. Okay, come here. Listen, why don't you go play with your toys, okay, in the other room while Mommy cleans this up, okay? See you later. It isn't easy, is it? Sorry, I should have knocked before I orbed. What is it? Do you know something about Leo? No more than you do, I'm sorry to say. But the deal you made with the Angel of Destiny will be honoured. I assure you, Leo will be returned to you if... If and when we defeat whoever the hell it is. - Any ideas? - If I knew, I'd tell you, Piper. But for whatever reason, you're supposed to find it out on your own. Yeah, well, I'm sick and tired of all these reasons that don't really make any sense. I mean, I barely understand it, let alone Wyatt, whose father is here one day, and then just disappears the next day. I mean, the kid's a wreck. What am I supposed to do? Everything you are doing, Piper. Living your lives, celebrating his birthday, never giving up hope. You know, he's a good kid. He's just acting out. He's a good boy. Once again, who does this symbol belong to? I told you, I don't know. I'm a possessor demon, not... Here's the thing, Rohtul, I'm gonna find this demon and I'm gonna find my sister. The question is, do you wanna help me or do you wanna die stupid like all the others? Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you, witch. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Knock it off. Are you kidding me? There's a 3-year-old's party about to start downstairs. Well, I was just trying to squeeze one more demon in before... No, there will be no more squeezing. Are you kidding me? I got enough stuff to do without worrying about who you're torturing in the attic. It's not a big deal, he's just a possessor demon. "Just a possessor demon. " Did you think maybe he'd like to possess some of our guests downstairs maybe? Did you think about that? - He won't be alive that long. - That is not the point. The point is now is not the time. I need this party to go very well. And I need to find my sister. Oh, great. Now look what you did. - No. - What are you doing? - I have to find him. - Not until after the party. Piper, I can't wait till after the party. He knows something. Would you listen to yourself? We've been through this. You can't let your obsession for revenge drive you... I'm not obsessed with revenge. Good, then you can understand why it can wait. No, it can't. Oh, incoming! - Maybe I should just cancel this thing. - What, the party? Well, the gods are against me, or at least the balloons are. Oh, honey, I know you're stressed. Piper, you can't be serious. Can't I? I mean, a few things have changed around here since I planned the party. Like, you know, his father is now gone... I know, but that's even more reason to have it. You know, give Wyatt a sense of normalcy. I know, I know, and that's what the Elder said, but... I'm just starting to think that I'm forcing it on him, trying to pretend like everything's just peachy. Well, he misses his dad, it's completely understandable. I know, I know, but I think there's something else too, something big, and I just wish I could talk to him before, you know, he turns the party guests into toads. Well, maybe he'll talk to Aunt Phoebe? - Okay, but you know, he is 3. - Well, it's worth a shot, though, isn't it? Okay, you do this and I'll do that. What should we do now, Rohtul? We can't just sit here and do nothing while she picks us off one at a time. What would you have us do, attack? She's working with the Charmed Ones. That would be suicide. The Charmed Ones have nothing to do with this. She acts alone. This is all about her sister. A sister who was abducted by very powerful demons, demons who don't wish to be revealed. You know where her sister was taken? No, but I know who did the taking. And believe me, you don't wanna go up against them any more than you do the Charmed Ones. That doesn't solve our problem. Billie must die. The only question is how we do it. - And who will risk it. - I will risk it. I owe her. Follow her. Find her weakness. Thank you, ma'am. And he starts working for Anderson Aviation on Monday. He'll be training pilots. It's a great job, yeah. More than enough to make those payments. Yes, Nick flew helicopters in the war. Right, and this was before he went to prison, correct? That's correct, sir. But it was only for a year, and it wasn't for anything really bad. Nick's just trying to get some money to help his son move out of a bad area. That's what the money's for, and I'm here to vouch for him. And I'm here to vouch for him as well. - I'm sorry, who are you again? - Well, I am a friend of his, and somebody who believes in second chances, especially for those who've served our country. Well, I couldn't agree more. Let me just run a credit check and I'll be right back. Excuse me. That's good. Nobody is gonna loan money to an ex-con. Nick, you've paid your dues, okay? Slate's clean, that's what parole is about. Listen, Henry, I appreciate everything you've done for me. Come on, you did it. Paige. - Hi. - What are you doing? Sorry. I know you're really busy, but I need to talk to you. So excuse us for just one second. Come here. Hey, little buddy, are you excited about your big party today? Yeah? It's gonna be fun. You're gonna have presents and see all your friends. And I bet you're pretty sad that your daddy can't make it. You wanna know a little secret? We're all sad. I'm sad, and your mommy's sad, Auntie Paige is sad. And I'm sad too. But no one understands me. Do you? Put this over here. Little boy's bear Show me how you care</i> Tell me how you'd feel If you were real</i> I'm so sad. I wanna cry all the time. Oh, no. Why are you sad, bear? You wanna tell her or should I? Oh, my God! How did you do that? Hello, hi. Oh, thank you. - Hi, Piper. - Hi. Phoebe! Look, Billie, I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna help Henry's friend. And besides, I'm not gonna go up against Piper, not today on Wyatt's birthday. Come on, the demon's gonna get away. You said he wouldn't talk. - But... - Look, please just relax, okay? Mr. Edwards, I'm very sorry, but our bank policy is very strict. You know what? I mean, this is a bunch of bull. Why don't you come out and say it? - Nick... - No, I'm tired of this crap. You know what? I've been dumped on ever since I got back, just like I've been dumped on since I got out of prison. Screw you. - Nick, please... - No! - I'm sorry I let you down. - Nick, you didn't... Isn't there something you can do? Maybe make an exception just this once? Hey, I'm not the criminal. He is. He is not a criminal, he's a veteran, jerk. - Henry, let's just calm down, come on. - What's the matter with you? - Henry. - I can't believe this happened. He's gonna crack, I know it. I know Nick. There are other banks. No, it's gonna be the same thing everywhere. It always happens this way. The guy can't catch a break. We'll make it work, okay? We'll figure it out. - It's not fair. - Paige, look out! Now, about that loan. All right, excuse me. Wow, so where's the birthday boy? Oh, that's a good question. Phoebe! Sorry, sorry, here's the birthday boy. Happy birthday! Hi. - Where've you been? - Oh, you know, just upstairs, chatting and playing with some toys. Wow, this just seems to be a huge success. Maybe we should wrap it up, huh? What are you talking about? The party just started. Wait a minute, what happened? What's wrong? That. Hey, what's that? Okay, okay, all right. Wow, are these characters great or what? You could hire them for any party. You go back on your word. You break your promise. It ain't my fault, it's your fault. Okay, easy. Relax, relax. You have guests to entertain. All right, troops. We got some recon to do. Follow me. You! You are in big trouble! In the front door. SWAT's on its way. All right, let's go. Everybody move over here. Let's go, move where I can see you! Do it now! You too, let's go. Come on. Bring your purses. - You don't wanna do this, man. - You're right. I don't wanna do this, but what other choice do I have? Empty your pockets and purses. Put it on the floor where I can see it. Do it! Just wanna make sure nobody's carrying. Listen, you do what I say, when I say it, nobody gets hurt. Got that? Okay. You, over here. What are you doing? What do you want with him? Listen, don't be a hero right now, okay? Just do what I say. You're making this worse than it is. I owe you everything, Henry, I mean it. You've been great to me, all right? But don't mess with me right now. Come here! - Get over here! - Please just do what he says. - Okay. - Let's go! Get a bag, fill it with a lot of cash, then bring it back to me, you got it? - Yes. - Do it! I'm gonna get that loan one way or another. I cannot believe this is happening. Yeah, well, it wouldn't be happening to you if you weren't so obsessed. Do you want me to call for his guns? No. No, you can't use magic, there are cameras everywhere. We can't risk exposure. I've never seen him like this. It's like he just snapped. Oh, really? Is that what he did? Look, Henry, can't you just maybe talk to him? You know, he trusts you. The only one he would listen to right now is his son. If we could only find someone who could bring his son here, or this is gonna get ugly. Hello? I have to go to the bathroom. - Hold it. - I can't. Hey, is there any windows in the bathroom? What? No. Go. Don't do anything stupid, though, all right? - No tricks, just the bathroom. - Go! Stay where you are, everybody else! Do it, fast! Okay, Bear Infantry, we're gonna head east past the punch bowl, and stop at the balloons, copy that? Tie your shoes. You're better than that. Okay, keep your heads down, keep your mouths shut, keep your hands out of your neighbour's pockets. Okay, you ready? Follow me. Gotcha! - Take cover, take cover! - Go get them! Oh, that's some good stuff. Look, you know, bright side is they're having a good time. This is not a good time. This is chaos. Yeah, but you gotta admit, the Army guy is kind of cute. Forget it, Phoebe, he's not anatomically correct. You need to go upstairs and reverse the spell. I did not cast a spell. Okay, well, maybe I cast just a little, little spell, but this... This is all your son. So he's the only one that can reverse this. Well, he got the idea from you, didn't he? Okay, look, I said I was sorry, all right? I was just playing with the dolls with him, to try to make him open up about his emotions, that's all. That's all? Does this look like that's all? - You're late. - 911, upstairs, now. Now what? Hostages, are you kidding? Do I look like I'm kidding? Wait, so how did you get out? I said I had to go to the bathroom which means I have to hurry, hurry, hurry to get back, okay? Nick has a son. Okay, his last name's Edwards. If you can find him and bring him down to the bank, that would be fantastic. Wait, how? Call Henry's office, say that you know me, say that you know Henry and he says it's okay. Also, call Agent Murphy, have him call Homeland Security and tell SWAT down there to not get trigger-happy, okay? We don't want Nick to get killed. Tell Wyatt I said happy birthday. I'm so glad Leo's not here to see this. Hey! Stay put. Are you finished? Jeez, can't a girl have some privacy? Let's go. Go. What's taking so long? Let's go, fill it up. Do it now, come on. Fill it up. Put it in there. Okay, I think we need to buy some time. Do you think you can make a potion with some of that stuff down there? Thought you didn't wanna risk us using magic. Well, I don't, but I also don't want anyone to get hurt. I mean, maybe it won't look like magic if they're not magical ingredients, right? Just see what you can do, okay? Be careful. You in the bank, this is the police. Pick up the phone, we wanna talk to you.</i> - Come on, pick up. - All right, that's enough. Put it down. Get back over there. - I'm listening. - My name is Lieutenant Sanchez. - Who am I speaking with? - You're speaking with somebody who wants a helicopter out front in 20 minutes with clear airspace. A helicopter? I'm afraid I can't authorise the release... You sure as hell better authorise it. Or what happens next is on you, pal. And don't try stalling, okay? I know the game. - All right, let's just be calm - Excuse me, sir. - And talk about this first, all right? - It's important. I'm sorry, hold the line. What? It's Homeland Security, sir. They said to interrupt. This is Lieutenant Sanchez. You want me to what? But that's against every negotiating procedure we've... Very well. All right, you got your chopper. Twenty minutes. Twenty minutes and I'm out of here. That doesn't make any sense. They never give in that quickly. Maybe they're hoping someone will talk him down. But the licence plate of the car that rammed into the bank</i> has been traced to Nick Edwards of Ingleside, a decorated ex-Marine...</i> Well, now we owe Agent Murphy again. At least they bought some time. I'm really worried about Paige and Billie. Do you think we should call the Elders? No, it's not a magical problem, there's nothing they can do. There's really nothing we can do either. - Should we ask everyone to leave? - No, Wyatt will be crushed. This is the most fun he's had in a long time. Thanks to his new, huge, big action heroes. Yeah. So how well do you know Leo? - When's the last time you seen him? - Answer his question. No, no, no, we don't point weapons at the guests, come on! Wow, do these guys know how to put on a show or what? Get down! Get down! Take cover! Take cover! Okay, okay, it's just a balloon. All right, folks, as you were. Okay, I'll go. You stay with Wyatt, and make sure he turns Pinocchio back into wood. Don't you worry, little buddy. We ain't gonna give up until we find him. You can count on it. Maybe you should go talk to him. - What do you want me to say? - Well, you know him best. Yeah, worked so well before. Come on, Henry. Nick. Don't even start, man, okay? It's no use. Good, good. That's what you'll tell your son, right? You leave him out of this. He's already in. The things you do affect your son, Nick, bigtime. Is this what you want for him? - What I want? - Yeah, for him. For your son. What I want is not to have been treated like a freaking pariah ever since I got back. You gotta expect that when you do time. I'm not talking about when I got out of prison. I'm talking about when I got out of Iraq. I risked my life over there, and for what, huh? To be treated like crap ever since I got back? It's not right. It's not, you're right. It's not right, Nick. But neither is this. Getting even, it's not the answer. Revenge makes you do things that you're gonna regret. You're hurt. I mean, you're angry. I don't blame you. I would be too. Nobody here blames you. They'll take that into account. But you gotta stop right now, for your son. Put that gun down. It's not too late. Give me the gun. Come on. No! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! What are you doing? He had him. Who the hell are you? Who are you?! - I'm a cop. - A cop? You're a cop?! Nick, stop, please. Nick. Get up, get up! Get against the wall. Get against the wall! Sit down! - Stay calm! - Henry. Everybody stay calm. Stay calm! All right, this is not good. Henry? Henry? Henry? Oh, God. No, stay down. Stay down, okay? Don't move. Don't move, you're gonna be okay. Okay. Well? The witch has problems of her own at the moment. - Explain. - She's being held hostage, along with one of the Charmed Ones, in a bank. Shots were fired. A mortal was wounded. Why don't they use their powers? Because they can't and neither can we. It's one of the few things both sides agreed upon eons ago. Neither can leave a magical trail for mortals to follow. - The secret must be kept. - So we just wait? No, we take advantage of their situation. If I time it just right, I just might be able to force their magical hand. Make them choose between exposing their secret and saving an innocent, something they're honour-bound to do. - But he just said exposing ourselves... - We won't be! They will be. Revenge has many faces, something that little witch is about to learn. Go back. Let me know when it's time. Come on. Pick up the phone, damn it. Get EMT ready in case I get that wounded hostage out. We need the EMTs over here. SWAT 2, SWAT 2, your position, over. Copy that, command. But we don't have a clear shot, over.</i> Are you up and running yet? Yeah, we tapped into the bank's surveillance cameras. If that hostage dies, I'm done negotiating. Sir, we found... Hi, how's it going? This is Nick Edward's son, Justin. I think he can help. Can I do anything for you? Yeah, you can get me out of here. You're gonna be okay, Henry. You just have to hang on, okay? I know you can do that. Paige, you gotta talk to him, okay? He doesn't know what he's doing. You can help him. How is he? He needs to see a doctor. That's how he is. Okay. Okay, well, as soon as the helicopter gets here. He might not make it that long. Hey, I didn't shoot him. You're right, you're the one who should've been shot. I'm sorry, I'm just worried about him. I know you are too, because like you said, he's been there for you every step of the way, right? Don't you think I know that? I do think you know that, which is why I know deep down you wanna do the right thing and let them take him to a hospital. - They'll crucify me. - They won't. I promise you they won't because we'll tell them what happened. We'll tell them that you did not do this. Pick up the phone, Nick. It's your son. Justin? Hey, buddy. How you doing? - Hey. - I think you're getting to him. Yeah, well, not soon enough. Henry's in pretty bad shape. Well, you know what? He's a tough guy, he'll be okay. I don't know. If it comes right down to it, I'm gonna orb him out. I thought you didn't wanna use magic. Well, I don't, but I don't want him dying either. How's it coming? I don't even know if this is gonna work. Okay, concentrate, because it has to. Okay. Well, let's not scare the guests any more than we already have, okay? What are you guys looking for, anyway? Great White Father. - Leo? - Stand down. He's not here. Maybe we should check the basement. Hey, no. Back up, all of you. How do you know we have a basement? Don't know. Just do. - And who told you to look for Leo? - No one, ma'am. He's missing, and it's our job to find him. - Now, if you'll excuse us. - No, go back. - Why is it your job? - Because it's our fault he's gone. Your fault? How would it be your fault? It is also Great White Father's fault. He broke his promise. Okay, now, that's the second time you mentioned the promise. What promise are we talking about? The promise that he would always be there, ma'am. That he would never leave. Unless he left on account of something we done. We? Oh, my God. You're not Wyatt's toys. You're Wyatt. We're bringing the chopper in now, ETA, five minutes.</i> Across the street, yeah. Yeah. I love you too. You know... ...I never wanted to hurt anybody, especially not Henry. I just got so tired of never catching a break, you know? It's still not too late, you know? You can turn this around. Yeah. Maybe. Not so fast. I still have a score to settle. What's going on? Keep it down. We don't want them to hear. I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I want them to know. I want the whole world to know exactly who you are. That's why I chose to possess this poor soul. Possess? What, you don't recognise me if you're not torturing me, witch? - Rohtul? - In the flesh. Literally, as it turns out. And you're not gonna be able to stop me without using your powers. Something you'll have to do if you wanna save your little friend over there before it's too late. - Why are you doing this? - Why don't you ask her? Did you really think that your vindictive rampage through the underworld would go unpunished? That we would just let it keep happening? Paige. Go, go ahead. I have all the time in the world. What's happening? Try not to talk, okay? Just save your strength. He was gonna give up but I saw... - Just stay calm. - I don't understand. All you need to know is that I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? I promise you. You need to trust me. Paige. I just can't believe this is all my fault, Paige. I swear, I didn't know. Unfortunately, you're not the only one who wants revenge. Why, what are you talking about? I think we should give him exactly what he came for. - But he came for me. - I know. Look, I just need you to go and finish that potion as soon as you can. We need a... Keep them back! Wait a minute, what do you mean you're not ready to leave? We had a deal. I held up my end of the bargain. Yeah, well, I've changed my mind. How about you give me a little more time to think it through. Yeah, I have plenty of time. I'll just wait around another 20 minutes, it doesn't matter. I have all the time in the world. Thank you. Just try to relax. I don't get it. This guy's schizo. It's like he's a completely different person all of a sudden. SWAT 2, SWAT 2, come in, over. SWAT 2, over. Bye, thank you for coming. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, sweet girl. Take care. - Thank you so much. This was the best birthday party Emma has ever been to. Those characters were amazing. Yeah, well, you can thank Wyatt for them. - Phoebe. - Piper, where have you been? I can't believe you missed half the party. Yeah, I know, but what are you gonna do? - Okay, bye-bye. Bye, sweetie. - Thank you so much. - Take care. - Okay, thanks for coming. - Did you get rid of them? - Well, not exactly. You're gonna have to have a conversation before that happens. Well, that's gonna have to wait because I think things took a turn for the worse at the bank, demonically worse. - What? How do you know? - Well, it's just a hunch, but I think Billie's possessor demon just stole the show. And if I read Paige's signal correctly, she's gonna need our help to stop him. All right, let's try it again. - He beat me again. - You win. - Easy on the knee, kid. - Is he safe with them? - I'm pretty good. - More than you know. He beat both of y'all. He beat both of y'all. All right, round two. Let's go, come on. Come on, Henry. Okay, Henry. I just need you to hang on, okay? Just a little longer. Do you really want him to die? More than you wanna save your precious secret? Leave me alone. Obviously, you care for him quite a bit. Go ahead and orb him out of here. You can do it. I know you want to. - Shut up. - You can't let him die, Paige. You'll never be able to forgive yourself if you do. What? Am I dead? No. You're alive. That's not possible. That's not possible! This is not happening. This is not happening! I'll kill him. I swear I'll kill him. You better stop me or he dies. One. - Two. - Now. What did you do? What did you do?! Fine, I'll take her. That's all I ever wanted anyway. Let's go. It's okay. She knows what she's doing. Anybody tries anything, she's dead. You understand?! SWAT 2, do you have a clear shot? Over. - Negative, command, stand by. - Let's go, let's go.</i> I die, she dies. Open the door. I can kill her. Get in. I can still shoot her! I've got a shot. Permission to shoot, over.</i> Negative. Hold your fire. Damn it! Listen, you really... You don't have to take me out on a gurney. You were shot on the stomach, Mr. Mitchell, we're taking you in. I know this sounds crazy. - I feel fine. - Yeah, well, you're a lucky man. That bullet somehow missed every major organ. - It's unbelievable. - Yeah. Par for the course lately. Any word on Billie? No. Apparently, the helicopter landed in Harding Park, - but there's no sign of Billie or Nick. - You don't seem very worried. Well, you don't know Billie like I do. She's a pretty sawy girl. She'll be all right. I hope. Well, okay. - I guess I should be going now. - Wait, where are you gonna go? I was gonna call Piper and tell her that we're okay. Good. Hey, you were all I could think about. Okay. Well, I'll see you soon, Henry. - Hey, it's me. - We're almost done with the potion.</i> That's great. Okay, they should be there any second. Are you sure it's the possessor demon?</i> That's what we're making the potion for. Positive. Okay, I'm out of here. Be there as soon as I can. So much for being under the protection of the Charmed Ones. But I thought you said you were going to try to expose them. Still, this is the one I wanted. This is the one we all wanted. Looks like you're never gonna find your sister after all. After you. Energy balls! Surprise. How? But you can't orb. No, but Paige can. She switched identities during the smoke bomb. - With the real Billie. - Talking about me? - This one? - Sure. So where were we? Yes, where were we? What is it gonna take to get through to you? All right, I know. Believe me, I get it. You don't have to tell me anymore. I just wanna find my sister so badly. I know and I wanna get my husband back very badly. But that doesn't mean I run around half-cocked all the time to do it. It's not gonna do your sister any good if you get killed - while trying to find her. - I know. I know that now. I'm not gonna let vengeance drive me to try and find her. Now it's about bringing her home safely, and that's it. What do we do with him? Well, I guess I'll orb he and Billie to the park. Maybe you can stumble out of there calling for help? Well, what's he gonna do? He's probably gonna have to go back to prison unless Henry can find somebody to help him out. Hey, you know, speaking of Henry, how did he make such a miraculous recovery? Well, I don't really think we have to discuss that now. What happened? Well, I think that Paige healed him. - By yourself? - It's not a big deal. Well, it makes sense. You are half-whitelighter. Still, something pretty extreme must have happened between the two of you, what were you feeling? Love, maybe? Don't make me sorry that I saved you. I want you to know that your daddy is a very, very brave man. And he always has been. And what he's doing now is very brave too. And I just need you to know... It's very important. That this isn't your fault. It's not anybody's fault. It just is. And I know it's hard to understand. But I'm gonna do everything in my power to get your daddy back, okay? I'm gonna do everything I can to bring your daddy back. That's a good job, buddy. Come here.
