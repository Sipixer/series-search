- I don't know. He would've attacked by now if we hadn't. Who would've? Why won't you tell me what's going on? Because we're busy trying to save your life. - From who? - Unfortunately, we're not quite sure. That's because Phoebe did not give us enough time to figure it out. Well, I didn't have a lot of time. I mean, I can't control how far in the future my premonitions take place. I saw the attack, we kicked butt, what more do you want? I would like to know more about who we are up against. Okay, Phoebe, maybe you should check the Book of Shadows, see if you find anything on this demonic hit man. - Excuse me, demonic? - And how to vanquish him. That would be a good thing to know. Do not get sidetracked with the Cole potion thingy. The only ones we're concerned about saving right now is ourselves. Okay, what Cole potion? He told her that he only killed because some demon cast a spell on him. How naive is that? I thought she was over him. - Apparently not. - What the hell are you talking about? First you tell me my life's in danger. Then you abduct me from my work. Now you're talking about demons and witches? Who the hell are you people? Look, I know this all sounds incredible, but it doesn't make it any less true, all right? You're a healer, you do good. Now, either you have saved too many lives, or you're about to save a life that they don't want you to save. - They? - Yeah, demons. More specifically, Shax, who is The Source's assassin. Hold it, I get it. This is a practical joke, right? Guess you've got a hidden camera here? My second wife put you up to this? Oh, it's just like her. Okay, Dr. Griffiths, listen to me. This is anything but... What? I don't know. I just felt a chill. - Phoebe? - All right, all right, I'm coming. - Phoebe! - Phoebe! - Dear God. - No! Prue! - What are you? - The end. Evil wind that blows That which forms below No longer may you dwell Death takes you with this spell Oh, no. Oh, God. Leo? Leo! Hurry, it's bad. What happened? You guys almost died, that's what happened. - Yeah, well, what else is new? - Oh, where's Shax? Well, I tried to use the vanquishing spell on him. But I think it just wounded him. He turned into the wind. Well, maybe the spell needs more than one witch to have its full impact. - Okay. Come on. - Come on. Come on where? To go find him. So we can finish him off while he's still hurt. You just stay here with Griffiths, all right? If Shax comes back, say the spell to fend him off. Right? Okay, come on. Maybe Phoebe hurt him worse than she thought. No, he's gotta be around here somewhere. He wouldn't leave without getting what he came for. You really think he'd attack us in broad daylight? Evil is usually more insidious than that. - Okay. - What? Blow this. Okay, is he dead? Well, we didn't really say the spell. Well, maybe we don't have to. We don't always. Lucky nobody saw us. All right, let's just get back to Phoebe. Come on. Back to me. Back to me. Back to me. Okay, I'm not exactly sure what just happened. But whatever it was, you saw it here. Live. Thank you. Now you understand why you have to keep this a secret? Why you can't tell anyone about us, about what you saw today? If others knew, we wouldn't be able to do what we do anymore. We wouldn't be able to help future innocents like we helped you. No. No, I understand. I mean, I don't understand everything. Demon. Witches. The Source. So much for my being an atheist. Your secret is safe with me. - Thank you. - No, thank you. You saved my life. The least I can do is protect yours. - Okay, I'll walk you to the door. - Okay. Bye. How did it go? - We dodged another bullet. - Yeah, with him maybe. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I mean, something still bothers me about the way we vanquished Shax. Like, I'm not so sure we really did. What do you mean? He screamed, he went poof, just like they all do. Third demon in a row, by the way, that I vanquished with my new power, - but who's counting? - Right, but if that's all that we needed, then why was there a vanquishing spell in the book? I mean, hasn't that always meant that our individual powers weren't enough? Except the book was written by witches with less powers than you guys have. - They needed the spells. - And plus, I think if he was still alive, he probably would've attacked again by now. You know, Leo, will you just check to make sure, please? - With the Elders? - No problem. If you ask me, I think you're being paranoid. We kicked Shax's ass. We bad. Yes, you're probably right. Then... ...I'm hoping you won't need me around here for a while. I want to try a new potion on Cole. One that'll reverse the spell that turned him bad in the first place. - Phoebe... - I'm not looking for your approval, Piper. Just your support. Well, Phoebe, it's sort of hard to give you support when you're just setting yourself up to get hurt again. Cole is good inside, I know it. And if dark magic did this to him, then how come white magic can't save him? I can't just turn my back. I have to try. What do you want us to do? I want you to use the magic-to-magic spell to send me down there. I reworded it to make it work. Phoebe, that's awfully dangerous. If something goes wrong, we won't be able to contact each other. I'll be safe. I'll be with Cole. And he'll bring me back, so don't worry about that. You're banking a lot on that little potion of yours, you know. No, I'm not. I'm banking on Cole. Cole. Wake up. Phoebe. What are you doing here? I came to bring you back. You just made a huge mistake. - Right here. - Hey, pipe down, everybody. Quiet. Close that damn door. Now, what we talk about in this room stays in this room until I say otherwise. All right? Go ahead. Seismologists believe that this quiet neighbourhood is actually - sitting on top of a fault line. - What in the hell? Oh, my God. Back to me. Back to me. Has this hit the network feed yet? No, but if we don't send it, some idiot out there who taped it will. We won't be able to control the revenue stream. Hold it. We don't even know what the hell it is we've got here yet. Can we just start with that, please? - Elana? - I don't know. I mean, you saw it. What else could it be other than something supernatural? Oh, come on, give me a break. It could've been anything, some kind of military deal. Publicity stunt. Right, publicity stunt. - For what, NASA? - Besides, why would they pull a stunt? - They didn't know we were there. - You don't know that. Maybe they only pretended not to know. - For all we know, this is a hoax. - Yeah. If it is, and we send it out before we authenticate it, we'll look like fools. We can't put the genie back in the bottle, Dave. Two hundred thousand viewers saw it live. What do you want to do? Go find out who these women are, fast. But be careful, okay? They may not wanna be found. - What did you expect to find? - I don't know, something, though. Well, demons don't usually leave footprints, remember? No, but sometimes they leave a residue when they've been vanquished, something otherwise innocuous. Look, I just don't understand how we could vanquish such a powerful demon without a spell. Well, frankly, I'm more worried about Phoebe than Shax. - We shouldn't have let her go. - Phoebe can take care of herself, Dr. Griffiths can't. Look... Piper, I've had a bad feeling about this, and I've had one all day. And if there's one thing I've learned since becoming a witch, it is to trust those feelings. Hi. Come on, sweetie. Stay away from them. Hey. Sit. - Morris. - Captain. Looks like all those freaky rumours about you and the Halliwells might not have been rumours after all. What do you mean? Oh, no. No, I understand. How long will he be in there? Okay, just have Dr. Griffiths call me as soon as possible. All right, thanks. Bye. Okay, well, at least Griffiths is in surgery for now. - No way Shax will attack him in there. - Okay, but what do we do then? We can't protect him indefinitely. Well, if I'm right, we won't have to. I mean, Shax will attack sooner rather than later. We should go. No, we should wait for Leo, to see what he found out. Especially with Phoebe gone. I mean, what if we need the power of three? Maybe that's Griffiths. - Digital-video experts outside KCSF - Hello? - have examined the original... - Darryl, just wait. Slow down, okay? What? Have you see the TV yet today? It's all over it. - What's all over it, Darryl? - Just turn on the TV, okay? I told the captain I would handle this, but I can't ward him off for long. Stand by. - Oh, my God. - We now switch to Elana Dominguez, - Prue? Prue? - with another exclusive. Elana? Here we are approaching the home of where they allegedly live. Prue, Piper and Phoebe Halliwell. And you're gonna meet them live, right here on KCSF. What are we gonna do? - Oh, look. - Are you coming to arrest them? Do you consider them dangerous? - No comment. - Is the FBI involved? - I said, no comment. - Have any idea who they are? Hey, hey, I can help. I know who they are. I mean, I know what they are, they're witches. Just like me, just like I am. Yeah, Prue, I'm at the door. Open it up. - Would you like to make a statement? - I said, no comment. - Oh, Miss Halliwell. I've got... - Back off! Isn't that illegal? Can't you do something about that? Killing somebody live on TV is pretty illegal too, you know. Okay, it wasn't somebody, Darryl. It was a demon, and we're pretty sure we didn't kill him anyway. You want to try telling them that? Look, I've called for backup, but that's not gonna help for long. This thing's gonna get ugly fast. We shouldn't have followed Shax into the street. - We didn't have a choice, Piper. - Didn't we? Sure, we could've let him kill our innocent. That would've been better, you think? All right, you know what? Let's not let this thing get between us, okay? We have enough problems as it is, please. More than you know. The captain wants me to bring you in for questioning. Right, Darryl, and what do we tell him? The truth? What are you gonna tell them? Captain. You know, maybe when Phoebe's done saving Cole, she can come back and save us. Hello, Leo, nice of you to orb in. Where have you been? Trying to figure out how to get you out of this mess. - It's pretty big news up there. - Well, in case you hadn't noticed, it's pretty big news down here too. Any suggestions? No. They're still working on it. Well, then by all means, tell them to take their time. They're not the ones that screwed up. Excuse me, screwed up? We've been busting our Wiccan butts for three years without getting caught. - Don't we get credit for that? - Piper, you've been exposed. If we can't fix this, it could undermine the good you've done and all the good that you're still destined to do. Well, maybe this is our destiny. Maybe it's just not meant to be. - You don't believe that. - Don't I? I don't. I mean, look, this whole year has just been a series of tests, right? To see what we're made of. Well, maybe this is one more test. Which means we can't give up, all right? So while the Elders are figuring out what we're supposed to do, - we still have work to do, okay? - Dr. Griffiths? Yeah, if we don't catch him before he gets out of surgery, Shax will. Unless you know something we don't? No, you're right. Your powers aren't enough to vanquish him. You'll need the three of you to say the spell. Yeah, well, we only have two of us. Don't ask, - just orb us to the hospital, okay? - I can't. The Elders won't let me. They don't wanna risk exposing whitelighters too. - Cowards. - Fine, we'll just save him - without your guys' help. Let's go. - Whoa, Prue. Prue. Even if you can save your innocent, that still doesn't save yourselves. I know that. But first things first, all right. Try and buy us as much time with your captain as you can, and you, get back up there and whitelight a fire underneath your bosses' butts. Let's go. - Whether arrests have been made... - Hey, I need to talk to you. - Miss Halliwell. - No, wait, don't leave, don't leave. - Miss Halliwell. - Hey, take me. - Come on, please. Take me with you. - Stay on the car. How'd that happen? Let's go, let's go. Let's follow on them. - You're not an easy girl to dump. - Yeah, well, I didn't risk everything to come down here and not get what I came for. Well, you can't have me, not anymore. I can if I reverse the spell that took you away from me. We've already had this conversation, Phoebe. Even if you could reverse it, - it doesn't change the fact that l... - That you killed a witch. Yeah, I know, Cole, but you didn't do it willingly, and that's the difference. That's what gives you a second chance. That's what gives us a second chance. I already had a second chance. And I blew it. Now, this... ...is your last chance. Do you understand? No more games. Go home. You can't save me. You wanna bet? Pretty cool potion, huh? Let's get out of here. Where? What do you mean, where? Home, back to my place. You really think they're just gonna let me go? They're not gonna come looking for me again? We'll fight them off. For how long, indefinitely? Phoebe, we tried it up there. It doesn't work for us. So where does that leave us? Right where we are. Dr. Griffiths, three-four. - Yes. Yes. - Dr. Griffiths. Three-four. Yes, here he is now. This is Dr. Griffiths. - Hi, he's still after you, come on. - What? Wait. Where...? - Come on. - Let's go. I don't have... - I thought you got rid of this thing. - Yeah, well, - we don't think that anymore. - Where we going? - Just somewhere where it's safe. - Look, I'm not cut out for this stuff. - Get in the car. - I swear... Evil wind that blows That which forms below No longer may you dwell Death takes you with this spell Now that was a vanquish. - Nice going. - That's amazing. News at 11. Oh, that's bad. I believe! - Stand back! - Let me talk to you! I'm one of you. Prue! Piper! I'm one of you. I'm the only one who understands. I can help. Hey. Prue. Piper! Get those idiots off the driveway, get them back behind the tape. All right, what I can't figure out is how they knew that we were at the hospital. I mean, they didn't follow us. The reporter probably LoJacked your car and followed you. Forget it. You know, I really hope Phoebe's doing better down there than we are up here. Look at all these interview requests we're getting. Ted Koppel, TIME magazine, Jerry Springer. Sports Illustrated? Yeah, they probably want you for the Swimsuit Edition. I'm just kidding. You know what, this is a nightmare. Where is Leo? Piper. Okay. Is that who I think it is? And then one of them said they needed a vanquishing spell. Dr. Griffiths? She ran upstairs to get some book. I don't know, some witch-type book, I guess. Something that told them how to kill that demon. So much for keeping our secret. Turn him off. Those sisters were always a little strange, if you ask me. I know for a fact that Prue once cast a spell to make my boyfriend break up with me. Evil. Okay, Susie Johnson from tenth grade? They're interviewing her? I always wondered why they broke up. Not funny, not funny. Leo. Leo. Leo! Leo! All right. This thing has to end now, okay? The media is turning it into a freaking circus. Now you know why the Elders have always been - highly concerned about exposure. - Okey-dokey, now we know. - Do they have any solutions or not? - Well, one. But it's a long shot. You have to try and contact Tempus. Tempus? Temp... Tempus, the demon? He's the only one on either side who has the power to manipulate time, to reset everything before this all started. Okay, you're definitely right. That... That's... - That qualifies as a long shot. - We vanquished him. No. You defeated him, you didn't vanquish him. But that's not the real problem. The real trick is trying to contact him. He's an upper-level demon who's well insulated. And why would he wanna help us? I mean, we can't make a move without the whole world tuning in to watch. We're basically powerless. Why would he want to change that? Cool, I made it. - You, get off that... - Who the hell are you? I'm Alice, Alice Hicks. I've been trying to contact you. I wanna join your coven. Are you nuts? This is our home. Get out of here. All units, stay back! All units, stay back! - You guys okay? - Yeah, we got it, Darryl. All right, this has to end now or our lives are over. Here she comes. Go, close-up. What happened? What did they do to you? - Did they think you were a demon? - Did they think you were a joke? - They're mean witches. - Tell us, tell us. Come on, tell us. How many people were in there? Well, okay, so how do we contact Tempus? Through Cole. He's an upper-level demon, isn't he? - Why would he help us? - Because helping us helps Phoebe. Are you allowed to orb down there? Yes, but I won't be able to find her until I'm there. I can't track her from here. All right, well, then you'd better hurry. - Okay, what's the matter? - Well, once I'm down there, you won't be able to contact me if you get in any kind of trouble. Honey, what more trouble could we possibly get into? Besides, once time resets itself, then everything should be fine. - So go, and be careful. - Yeah, you too. Okay, so, what do you say, Oprah or Barbara? Barbara makes you cry. We go with Oprah. Phoebe? I have to get you out of here. You mean, get us out of here. Listen to me, this is serious. Something's happening. Something big, l... It's too dangerous for you here. - Why? What's happening? - I don't know, but whatever it is, it's important enough for The Source to have come. What? He's here? Now? Which is why you have to go. - Leo. - Are you out of your mind? - What are you doing? - Trying to save my family. Prue and Piper have been exposed. The whole world knows you're witches. What? - How? - It doesn't matter how. What matters is getting them out of it, which requires your help. Come again? You have to get to Tempus, you have to get him to reverse time. Oh, you gotta be kidding. There's no way. Look, it's the only way there is. But we have to move fast. l... I couldn't summon Tempus even if I wanted to. I don't have that kind of power. But you know somebody who does. Wait, you want me to ask The Source to help witches? Doesn't just help witches. The demonic world has been exposed too, Cole. Why do you think he's here? Resetting time solves everybody's problem. Make it your idea. Pitch it like you're doing it to save him, not them. Whether that's why you're doing it or not. This is suicide. I've heard the rumours. I beg you, are they true? - Have we been exposed? - What business is it of yours? I may have a solution. Tempus' powers... Are still weakened from when he last turned back time. Doing so again will destroy him. What other choice is there? - Forgive me. - For your betrayal, never. I know of your struggles, Belthazor. Of your witch. I know that's why you've come to me. I know everything about you. Tempus will do as you suggest if your witch crosses over. If your witch joins us. She'd never do that. Not even to save one of her sisters' lives? Has one of them been killed? Wait. I'm on the scene amongst this frenzied crowd... I don't know why we're bothering to do this. In case time doesn't reset itself. If time doesn't reset itself, this table against that door is not gonna help much. Then we better start thinking about what would, okay? Because if Leo doesn't succeed, we're gonna have to figure out what we're gonna do. We're gonna do talk shows and book signings and movie deals, and then be taken by the CIA and dissected. How can you be joking about this, Piper? - Who's joking? - Well, I'm not. All right, I'm scared. And you should be too. Okay, our lives, Piper, everything that we've worked for, could be completely destroyed with... With one stupid mistake. Our entire future, our entire destiny, could be wiped out just like that. What was that? Piper. Piper. Piper. I killed the wicked witch. The wicked witch is dead. I killed the wicked witch. Oh, God. Oh, God. I know. I know. You're okay. You're okay. Leo! Leo! Okay, we have to get you to the hospital. Come on. Leo! Leo! Miss Halliwell, please, what is going on? Miss Halliwell, please. Leo! - Look out for the guy. - Where are you going? - Move! - Miss Halliwell, what is going on? Move! Miss Halliwell, where are you going? Miss Halliwell, please... Move out of my way. I gotta get her to the hospital! Move! - What happened to your...? - Move out of my way. Get out of the way. What is wrong with you people? Leo! You're okay. Hang in there. Where's Dr. Griffiths? He should've been here by now. - How did this happen? - Some idiot in front of our house. - What do we know? - Pulse is 70 and weak. I need some numbers, people. At the count of three. - One. Two. Three. Go. - Suture kit standing by. Suture kit prepared. Small entry wound, upper right back. Larger exit wound, abdomen. Lungs failing. Stir an IV of lactated ringers. - Two units of O, stat. - Right away. Leo. - Grab 40 cc's adrenaline. - He... He can't hear you. Leo. Something must have gone wrong. You hang in there. Don't you dare die on me. Pin in the lower back. - Prue... - Hold it there. ...I'm cold. I can't... I can't... - I can't feel my legs. - Pulse is dropping. Don't go. I love you. Oh, God. Full arrest. Paddles! Gel. - Clear. - Clear. - Recharge. - Recharge. - Clear. - Clear. - I'm sorry. - No! No, God. Get out of here. Go! Yeah. Maybe it shouldn't. l... Cole. Where have you been? We've been worried. What's the matter? He knows. About you, about us. So, what does that mean? He's offering a deal. He'll get Tempus to reset time... ...if you stay here. - What? Down here? He's crazy. - Hardly. Yeah, well, we're desperate, but not that desperate. Why would he think that I would accept an offer like that? Because it's the only way to bring one of your sisters back to life. What? It's a trick, he's lying. No. It's not. Okay, stop it right there. Here. Just keep your hands where I can see them, and you won't get hurt. Easy. They killed her, Leo. They think we're the demons now. How could...? How could this be happening? I don't understand. I'm so sorry. Can you make this right or not? Go! Don't worry, he's gonna fix it. I promise, you're gonna be fine. Piper. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. So... ...will resetting time affect us down here? No. Good. I only have one condition. You must warn Prue and Piper before the demonic hit man attacks. Otherwise they're dead anyway. Agreed. Once I have reset time, detain him. And then kill his witch. That way I won't have to worry about Belthazor anymore. Or the Charmed Ones. Steady. It shall be done. Look, I know this all sounds incredible, but it doesn't make it any less true, all right? You're a healer, you do good. Now, either you have saved too many lives, or you're about to save a life that they don't want you to save. - They? - Yeah, demons. More specifically, Shax, who is The Source's assassin. Hold it, I get it. This is a practical joke, right? Guess you've got a hidden camera here? My second wife put you up to this? Oh, it's just like her. Okay, Dr. Griffiths, listen to me. This is anything but... What? I don't know. I just felt a chill. Phoebe? Phoebe, you there? Phoebe, where are you? - Dear God.
