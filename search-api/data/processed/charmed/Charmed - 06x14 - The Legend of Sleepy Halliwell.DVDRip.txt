- Yeah, well, you know, he's not even a year old yet. So? I had my Jake signed up for Mommy and Me - when I was still pregnant with him. - Really, you can do that? Oh, absolutely. In fact, I'm surprised that they let you sign up this late. Everybody wants to get in here because it gets you into Elderberry Preschool, which is a feeder for Hoskins Elementary and Bentley Middle School. Doesn't have any siblings, does he? No. How did you know? Because he doesn't play well with others. Oh, don't worry about it. It's a common problem among only children. All the more reason to start developing their social skills early. First things preschools look for, you know. Yeah, well, that's why we're here. Excuse me. - Hi, thanks for coming. - Oh, of course, you know, anything for our little nephew. What exactly are we doing - for our nephew? - Showing family support. They look for it. Especially when the father's not around a lot. What are you talking about? - Leo's around all the time. - Yeah, for Wyatt. But he won't be for the school. He can't be. What are you doing? Put that thing down. I'm trying to reach Richard. I can't find him. You've been trying to call Richard for the last couple days. - Maybe you should give it a rest. - But I'm just afraid he's off on some magical freak-out or something, you know. And I just want to be able to help him. Maybe he just needs a little time alone. It makes me question whether or not I can even save an innocent if I can't save my boyfriend. - No offence. - No, don't worry about it. I'm over it. - Jason? - Yeah, when you get to be my age, you can't spend the time crying over spilled milk, you know. - Your age? - Yeah, the whole biological clock thing, it's very real and it's echoing: Okay, neurotic people, can we get back to my neurosis right now, please? Sure, which one were we talking about? The one where I'm a rotten mother who's raising an antisocial child. Oh, that is ridiculous. And not true. Is it? He doesn't have any friends, Phoebe. You and I had each other when we were growing up. But he doesn't have anybody, he's all alone. Hey, I was all alone. But you didn't know you had power, so it was safe for you to have friends. Your mother didn't have to worry about if you were gonna orb out - during a play date or something. - You think you're overreacting a little? No. You cannot keep doing this, sweetie, really. Oh, guys... What the...? Oh, this is not good. Help! Orb him out of here. Go. Oh, thank God you're home. What the hell was that? That... ...was the Headless Horseman. - Okay. - You're very kind. Yeah, can I ask you just one question? How are you still talking? Yes, well, fair question. Fortunately, the rest of me is still at Magic School, otherwise I'd be... I'm sorry, Magic School? Yes, that's right... Anyway, as I was saying, as long as my body remains on grounds, I can't... Well, you know, die. It's all part of the magic, thankfully. Like the doorway in the middle of my stairway. Sorry, I didn't know where to put it. It's the only way in or out of the school. - I had to reach you. - Do you have a name? Sigmund. But I'm afraid we don't have much time for pleasantries. I need to get you back before he strikes again. - The Headless Horseman. - Right. Fabulous. - Where's Wyatt? - He's upstairs in his room. I thought I should bring Leo... Oh, my God, and apparently I was right. Leo! Oh, it's so good to see you again! Sigmund, what happened? - Wait, you guys know each other? - Gideon sent me for your help. - All your help. - Gideon? Who's Gideon? - And who are you? - All right, all you people with legs, follow me. You wait here. Hurry. Leo, just so you know, this is what's keeping your son - from developing social skills. - And me from helping Richard. And me from helping me. - What? - I'm talking about our lives. We can't just drop what we're doing every time somebody's head comes rolling down the stairs. I don't believe you're saying this. You don't understand, this isn't supposed to happen. Magic School is supposed to be protected from evil. It's the only way Gideon can teach magic to the next generation... Wyatt's generation. I think Wyatt is more concerned with nursery school right now - than Magic School. - Are you sure? Paige said he orbed back in front of the door. He was drawn to it. Okay, you know what, I think we should help the Magic School. Because we can't just keep that head on our foyer table, you know. What is it, a centrepiece? Okay, fine, but we can't take Wyatt, sorry. All right. I'll get Chris to watch him. What? After everything he's done? No, I don't think so. - He was just trying to protect Wyatt. - Oh, please. I think his intentions are good. He deserves another chance. Are you sure you can breathe in there all right? Yes, l... We must move quickly. - All right. - Just step around it. Someone will be along for it shortly. Wow, impressive. How long is this hallway? No one really knows. It's endless. - Great. - So how are we gonna find this dude Gideon anyway? He's not a dude, he's an Elder... My old mentor, actually. Really? You've never mentioned him before. We met a long time ago when I first became a whitelighter. He helped me out, took me under his wing. He actually fought for us - to get married... To break the rules. - Really? I don't want to freak you out, but there's a wolf following us. What? There was a wolf following us, I swear. Not everyone sees the same things here, Phoebe. Only what they're meant to see. Who you got in there, Confucius? Okay, you all saw that, right? Eleventh-grade levitation. She's late. We should keep moving, the great hall is just ahead. Leo, good. Thanks for coming. Although I do wish it was under better circumstances. - Gideon... - And the Charmed Ones. Lovely to see you again. Although you probably don't remember meeting me. You were just little girls. Leo. Gideon, I believe your invisibility shield is still up. I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted with everything - that's been going on around here. - Yes, we heard. - Sigmund, oh, I'm so sorry. - It's all right, sir. Didn't stop me from delivering the message now, did it? Okay, would somebody please tell me what's going on here? Always were the restless one. Just like your Grams. Well, it all started innocently enough, actually. Pranks, really. Setting the rats loose from the Pied Piper. Turning the north dorm into a gingerbread house. Kids. - And then? - And then someone cast a spell that brought forth the darkness. And days became nights, nights became terror, and the Headless Horseman has roamed the campus ever since, targeting teachers. Forgive me, sir, perhaps you'd like to orb me over to the other heads? Right. - Good thinking. - Nice to meet you. You too, dude. So, what you're saying is somebody's trying to shut down the school by cutting off teachers' heads? What else could it be? What better way for evil to gain an upper hand, than to thwart the next generation? Isn't it as simple as finding who conjured the Horseman and reversing the magic? Yes, except no student possesses that level of magic. At least they're not supposed to. That's why I believe that a demon from the outside has somehow corrupted one of them into doing his bidding. So you find the student, you find the evil, right? True. Except that you find much more than that here, Paige. The answers you each seek can be found within these grounds. You merely have to be open to them. Teaching will help you find the student in question. But it will also remind you of what you fear you have lost. Investigating our nursery school will help you with your worries over Wyatt. And if you follow the wolf, she will lead you where you want to go. But be careful. The deeper you look, the more you will discover. And the better chance you will have of saving... ...all this. Who does he think he is? Obi-Wan Kenobi? How can I be afraid of losing something if I don't know what I've lost? Maybe that's why he wants you to take over Sigmund's class. So you can remember. Remember what? Your gift, perhaps. Now, whatever you do, be strong. Don't let them intimidate you. This may be advanced magic, but they're still just kids. Help! Stop it! Oh, my God. - You okay? - I'm fine. Telepathy isn't the coolest power now, is it, Zach? - No. - Did you do that? Excuse me, I'm talking to you. Did you do that? - Yeah, so what if I did? - What's your name? Quinton. What's so funny? What? Thanks a lot, Slick. Get me in trouble, why don't you? What's the matter, teach? You seem a little out of sorts. Me? No, I'm perfectly fine. Thank you. You're a conjurer. Yeah. And I'd watch your pretty little neck if I was you. Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie. Come on. I know you're here somewhere. Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie... Oh, hi. Hi, sweet wolfie. Okay, you don't have to attack me, because Gideon sent me... Where are you going? Come on. Neat trick. Can you shape-shift - into the Headless Horseman as well? - I'm a shaman, not a shape-shifter. The wolf is merely a projection of your quest. A symbol. Fascinating. You didn't answer my question. Do you really think I lured you out here just to kill you, Phoebe? You have the power of premonition. But it's unreliable. Especially lately. I can help you see your future more clearly. If you're willing to take the risk. I don't know what the hell Gideon was talking about, because this is certainly not what I'm looking for. Still, Wyatt doesn't have to hide his powers. Plus he's - not gonna be all alone. - No, he'll be surrounded - by all the other freaks. - They're not freaks. You know what I mean. I just want Wyatt to have a normal upbringing. At least as normal as possible. Is that too much to ask for? I don't know. Maybe. Well, we're not shopping for preschools, we're shopping for headhunters. So where is...? Sorry, had a little emergency. Go ahead. - Now, where were we? - You were telling us about your near miss with the Headless... I don't want to scare the little ones. They may have powers - but they're still innocent. - How did you get away? I astral projected. Confused him, I guess, by creating two of me. - Thank God. - Are you suggesting that - one of these kids might be in...? - Involved? Oh, dear, no. No. Never. - Why would you be a target? - These children are the cradle of good magic. Its entire future. Without proper guidance, nurturing, they could easily be turned... Evil? Yeah. What's that? - Anybody hurt? - Not yet. - You guys okay? - You're a teacher now. Be careful. - Come on, I'll take you back. - Wait, don't leave... Piper! Great. Just great. Easy. Easy. - Easy, watch the hair. - Sorry. - You doing okay up there, honey? - Actually, I feel a little woozy. Maybe because we have you up too high. - Want me to move you down lower? - No, I don't want Wyatt to see me - like this. He will freak out. - Well, you know, on the plus side, this is a great way for Wyatt to get out and socialise. If I had legs, I would kick you. Could you move this for me, please? Yeah. You know, maybe I should just go upstairs and check the Book and see of there's a spell that can fix this. Or we can find the child that conjured the Horseman and vanquish it. You think that would reverse the spell? - I'm hoping. - You know, I keep getting this weird feeling that it's one of the students in my class. - Why? - Because who better to turn than one of the most powerful kids there? - What do you suggest? - I think we should bring them here. - What? - Yeah, if we get them away from school, they can't conjure the Horseman. That way we keep them here long enough to figure out who it is. Actually, it's not a bad idea, since you're targets now. Phoebe. - I'll go get her. - No. I do not want Wyatt to have two headless parents. Send Chris. - What the hell is going on? - I can explain. - You okay, buddy? - What was he doing? Nothing! I mean, nothing bad. - I swear. - Nothing bad? He's a demon. But he wasn't hurting him. I promise. Wyatt's shield wasn't even up. I trusted you. I vouched for you. Look, just let me explain. Get out of here. Paige, please? Now! - Is he okay? - Yeah, I think so. Listen, I'm gonna take him up there where it's safe. Do you mind...? Getting Phoebe? No, not at all. I just hope there's all of her to get. So if you're so innocent, why are you hiding out? - I'm protecting myself. - From what? You're a student. The bad guy's only after the teachers, right? I'm not protecting my body. I'm protecting my powers. I sense someone trying to invade mine. To use them for themselves. How do I know you're telling the truth? You're an empath. You tell me. I can't tell. It's because you're conflicted. Questioning your own magic. Your very future. It's affecting your powers. I'm not questioning my future. Okay, maybe just a little bit. But how do you know that? The wolf is a pack animal. But constantly searching for something she craves... ...but cannot find. Seeing it means you're searching too. Drink this. Take the vision quest. There you will find the answers we both seek. - I'm not drinking that. - No? Tick, tick, tick... You didn't tell me I could get hurt on this vision quest. You didn't ask. The vision is of your future, Phoebe. - It's no less real than anything else. - And no less dangerous. Great. More demons in my future. It's exactly what I wanted. But are there any more beyond the light? That's what you really want to see, isn't it? There you are, I've been looking all over for you, Pheebs. Are you okay? What happened, the Horseman? No... My inner demons, apparently. Well, it's good to see at least you have your head, unlike Piper. - What? - Yeah, the Horseman got her. But, you know, she's doing pretty good, considering the circumstances. A little grumpier than normal, but hey... Anyway, you really should get out of here before, you know, you get chopped. - I think I should stay here. - Why? Because Gideon put me on this path for a reason. And I believe that there are answers here. I'll be okay. And you know where to find me if you need me. Okay, but remember that she's a suspect too. Ready to try again? - What's that? Who is that? - Don't worry, it's just me, and some of the more unusual suspects. Wait, you think one of us is responsible? What, you didn't know she thought that? What kind of telepath are you anyway? - Stop picking on me! - Yeah, or what? All right, guys, knock it off. You're in my house. The Halliwell manor. I don't believe it. It's just like in the text. Yeah. It looks like my grandma's house. All right, all right, move it along, people. Let's go, other room. - All right, is everybody here? - Yes, ma'am. - Kiss-ass! - Hey, watch your mouth. - Whoa, it's Piper Halliwell. - Yeah, but only part of her. - And not the good part either. - Slick. - Can it! - Okay, here's the deal, people. We know that one of you is behind this. So nobody is gonna leave here until we figure out who it is. - So far, nobody has gotten killed... - Not yet anyway. And so far, this has just been a really stupid prank. So please, let's not let it go any further than that. Is Gideon gonna shut down the school? Not unless he's forced to. Why don't you start with the conjurer? Me? What about you, Quinton? - You're the Sleepy Hollow buff. - But Slick's the shape-shifter. - Hey, screw you, Zachary. - Wait, just stop it... - Why not just admit that you did it? - I would never do anything to harm a Charmed One. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - I wasn't talking to you! - Paige! - What are you doing here? - I need your help. My help? That's rich, with what you pulled. Listen, I have enough juvenile delinquents to take care of. Thanks. Please, just hear me out. I'm running out of time. - What's that supposed to mean? - Exactly that. Don't you see? That's the only reason why I went to the demon. He can scan for evil. And maybe figure out who's gonna turn Wyatt, - since we haven't been able to. - Okay, you're not making any sense. Paige, listen to me. I need you to trust me. And I need you to get Piper and Leo to trust me too. Before it's too late. - The Headless Horseman! - Paige! What happened? Are you okay? Everyone all right? I think so. Head count. No jokes, just do it. What are you doing here? - Just trying to help. - They're all here. I heard the alarm. What's this doing open? A student must have opened it without my seeing it. - And the Horseman? - Gone, out those doors. - You have to stop him. - Okay, well, we have to figure out... No, you don't understand. People on the outside aren't protected like we are at school. They'll die. - Then we need Phoebe. - I'll get her. But you can't wait for her. You have to go after the Horseman now. By myself? No, I can't vanquish him. You don't have to. All you have to do is lead him back to the school so that at least nobody will be killed. Don't let your concerns about Richard make you question yourself. You can do this. I'll help you. Where are you going? Don't give me that look. I still got a mouth, I could turn you into a toad. - Well, at least we got him back. - Not soon enough, I'm afraid. The death of an innocent means the death of Magic School. I just don't understand why the Horseman targeted him. I mean, and why did he pass up so many others along the way? Granted, it could have been a lot worse but it doesn't change my mind. The police said he was a killer, Gideon. - Doesn't make it right. - No, it doesn't, but you shouldn't close the school because of it. We have the Horseman contained. We just need to find... It's too late. The damage has already been done. When I started this school, I made a promise, that the magic within would never harm a soul. Otherwise... - Piper, you okay? - Hunky-dory. You, come with me. Anybody else want to try me? - Leo! - What do you want him for? - Reinforcements. - What's going on? Talk him out of closing down the Magic School. Someone let the Horseman out, Leo. He killed a man. But why? Why else? To force my hand. If you let whoever is behind this win, all those kids are gonna lose. - Is that what you want? - Of course not. - But... - But what? Big deal, you have one bad apple. Just give us the time to flush him out, to save the next generations of magic. - I know, but the rules... - Screw the rules! Listen, you are the one who talked me into doing this, you are the one who said I could do it. So don't give up on me now, please. Just let us finish the job that we started. Tell him, Leo. I think you just did. Next time, I give you warts. Hey, who did that? Where did you come from? Hey. Hey, wait... Hey! Piper? Oh, my God, Piper! - The door is still closed. - The kids are frozen. - Piper must have done that. - Without hands? I don't think so. - Someone from the outside? - Impossible, we got here too fast. - It has to be one of them. - The students? No, they don't possess that kind of power. Besides, they're frozen. Then one of them is faking it. Okay, you know what? Enough already. Every journey requires a sacrifice. My whole life is about sacrifice. If that's all that my future holds, - then I don't want to see it. - You're fighting it. Don't. Don't use your powers to get through. They're not working very well anyway. Just let it come to you. Want it more than anything. Wyatt, let your little brother play with the game too, please. Little brother? Hey, Piper, can you take Phoebe to the doctor instead? I have so many papers to grade. Thank you. - The doctor? - Yeah, we need to make sure our little niece is doing okay. Aunt Phoebe, we need your help. Phoebe, can you hear me? We need your help. You okay? I don't know. - Am I? - You tell me. What did you see? I saw children and my child. And a life without demons... Is that even possible? With your powers, you know by now what is truth and what is not. Embrace those powers again. Embrace your path, and it will lead you there. You don't know how much you've given me. You should go. So you can use your powers to help us save our school. Oh, Phoebe, so glad to see you. I was worried. What's the matter? Didn't trust me? - Separate subject. - How's Piper? - You're not gonna like it. - She's been kidnapped. - What? - That's the bad news. The good news is that she's here... Somewhere. Well, if one of the students took her, I can't sense which one it is. Maybe I can. Thanks to your wolf. I can sense pain and anger... A lot of anger. Wants revenge... Do any of them hate the high school? Honey, they're teenagers, they all hate the school. But he's a conjurer. No. It's not him. - But who's this guy? - A telepath. Yeah, he's telepathing a whole lot of rage right now. Well, look who just solved the case. - Zachary? - Surprise. - What happened? Where did he go? - That wasn't Zachary, - that was an astral projection. - He doesn't have that power. No, but a teacher here does. And Herman's a conjurer, and Piper can freeze. He's using his telepathy to tap into other people's powers. Where's the real Zachary? He's at school, with Piper. But why? What does he want with her? You don't think he'll kill her, do you? You know what, I have no idea. He's a smart kid. I just hope he's not luring us here. You made me do this, you know. I didn't have a choice. So now what are you guys gonna do? So whose bright idea was this anyway? We were trying to save you. Yeah. Good job on that one. And who went and got her head stolen? While you were off contemplating your navel. While you still had one. Guys, we are not getting anywhere arguing. Actually, we're not "getting anywhere" because we don't have any bodies. Okay, look, we said we were sorry. Can we try looking on the bright side? I mean, you know, - we're still alive. - Only because Zachary... ...can't kill us in here. - I don't think he would if he could. I mean, he practically apologised to us. I think she's right, actually. I didn't sense any anger from him, - just a lot of sorrow. - So, what, he did this to us just to get us out of the way? To do what? - To get revenge on the school. - And Gideon. How could I not have seen this? How could I not have sensed his pain? After all these years with him. It's not your fault, Gideon. Even you can't see everything. I should have seen this. I should have focused more on the boy than on his magic. - Get the kids out of here now. - Why, what's the matter? It's Zachary, he's lost it. Orb them out, up there. I'll try talking to him. Just go. You should leave too. Why? After all, I came here for you. Do you think this spell's gonna work? Well, now that we know who conjured the Horseman, it should. We won't know until we summon him, so let's just put our heads together... You know what I mean, right? Okay, now, now, now! Power of three, unite! End this grizzly fright Reverse the roles And make us whole Thank God, it worked. You want me to get you a room? Let's go, let's go, let's go. Why take it out on others, Zachary? Why not just come after me? Because I want you to suffer, Gideon. Like you made me suffer ever since I got here. I want you to see your precious school destroyed. Bit by bit. But that doesn't give you the right to kill an innocent. You scolding me now? You're gonna give me a demerit? That wasn't supposed to happen. I just wanted the sisters out of the way. The Horseman's only supposed to hurt evil. Evil? You think teachers are evil? They are when they keep me here against my wishes! And they take me away from my family, my home! Without even thinking about what I want! - Why didn't you come to me? - I did, damn it! Every time I snuck out. Every time I got in trouble. But you didn't care. - You wouldn't listen! - We're listening. It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you. - We're here to help. - How'd you get out? Magic. See, sometimes it takes us away from our lives as well. A lot more than we like it to. But it's who we are whether we like it or not. We can't change that and neither can you. You have to accept it. You have to realise this is not worth throwing your life away for. Just let it go. That's it. Easy... - You okay? - Yes. I just guess I've been more invisible than I realised over the years. Hey, guys. Wasn't Ziggy Marley - supposed to play here before? - Yeah, he had to reschedule. So how's Zachary? He's good. He's at home with his family now. But I wouldn't be surprised to see him back at Magic School someday. I think he heard us, you know, about accepting himself. - So you're not gonna bind his powers? - No, he didn't want me to. But he gave me a good idea about maybe doing that for somebody else. - Richard? - Yeah. You know, if he can't handle it, why should he have to? Maybe I can finally help him accept that. You're gonna make a really good teacher one day, Paige. - Teacher? - Yes, in Magic School. I saw it with my very own... ...vision. Yeah, well, I don't think she's gonna be teaching Wyatt any time soon. Suddenly I'm more concerned about separating him from his family than raising him as an only child. Actually, there might be a day that you don't have to be concerned about that. What do you mean? I'm just saying. What are you just saying? Excuse me! Hey. Hey. So did you come here to kick me out? No, actually, I came here to ask you a question. What? I need you to be honest with me. No games, no running away. Just the truth. Okay.
