But how--? We are one now. I am reborn... ...within you. I'll fight it. I'll kill us both if I have to. I won't let you hurt Phoebe. You... ...won't have a choice. - Voilà! - Oh, that looks great. Let's eat. - Wait, where is everybody? - I don't know. Pass the croissants, please. I don't understand. We were all supposed to eat together, you know, to celebrate. Sisters. Butter? Phoebe! Paige! Paige. Wait, Paige, did you orb in from another room? Yeah. Obviously, the landing could still use a little work. You've been practicing this? Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything until I knew for sure I could do it. Food. Thank God, I am starving. That's the orbing. Burns a lot of calories. Why do you think I married a chef? I can't believe your powers are already advancing. This is just another reason to celebrate. - Leo, butter. - Butter. You should try the frittatas. They're great. You're both very welcome. Oh, thank you, honey. I just wanna eat fast so I can get to work on time for a change. Well, I understand, but, still, it's not every day we vanquish The Source of All Evil. I mean, the least you could do is wait for Phoebe and Cole. Oh, don't bother. Cole's not here, and all I need is a caffeine lV. What is the matter with you people? Our mortal enemy is gone, dead. Is there nobody else besides me happy about this? Absolutely, honey. I'm thrilled. Thank you for the spread. Have a good day. - I'm being summoned. - What? Now? What do they want? Maybe they just wanna congratulate you guys. - But-- - For the road. Does he have to do that so brightly? Well, that will teach me to try and be in a good mood. What's the matter with you? I don't know. I went to bed and I was really happy, and then I woke up this morning, and I just... I had this horrible feeling about Cole. - Cole? - Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain. It feels like it's a premonition that's trying to come out, but it never quite does. But whatever it is, it's not a good thing. Well, that doesn't sound supernatural. That sounds super normal. You got cold feet. Every bride-to-be does. Trust me, even I did. Just like that? Overnight? Well, the only reason you haven't gotten married is because of The Source, and now that he's dead, you are that much closer to taking that very long walk down the aisle. I don't know. It feels like there's something else. - How did I get here? - The Source's magic brought you. I see you accepting that very soon-- You never told me I'd become The Source if I helped vanquish him! Don't be naive. I told you of my vision. Of you and l doing great things together. This is just the beginning. You cannot change your fate. As you can see, the evil within you won't allow it. I'll fight it. I'll kill it. I'll find a way. There is no way. If you weren't clinging to the love for your witch so vigorously, it would have overtaken you by now. But it's only a matter of time. And after The Source has fully assimilated you, his power will protect you, shield you from her premonitions. That we can wait for. Unfortunately with Kurzon, we cannot. Kurzon? The underworld's in chaos. The Source is presumed dead, and Kurzon will attempt to fill that void. We must stop him, or you'll never reclaim the throne. - I don't want the throne. - You will. But at the moment, you're not strong enough to vanquish Kurzon. The Charmed Ones, however, are. And what? You expect them to just go after him? No. I expect to make Kurzon think they will so he'll retaliate. And I expect you to make sure the witches are prepared to vanquish him before he can vanquish them. I won't do your bidding, Seer. You can't force me. Perhaps not, but The Source can. - Sorry. - I didn't hear you come home. I just got back. - From where? - I had to... ...get out of the house, you know? No, actually I don't know. Do we need to talk? Phoebe, l-- - Damn it. - What's the matter? It's nothing. It's just a migraine. I gotta go. Cole, where are you--? Cole. What's the matter? I wish I knew. It is a new era, my friends. Our enemy is dead, and our exile is nearing an end. The tasks I have assigned to you are vital to our cause. Complete them today, and tomorrow we could all return home. You will not live to lead the underworld. Have you seen my future, Seer? A lone but powerful witch will soon be on your trail. You must kill her now while she is still vulnerable. Her loyalties are with the last Source. Don't trust her. And why would you want to help me? Because I've always aligned myself with ultimate power. And if you kill this witch, nothing can stop you from becoming the next Source. You wanted to see me, Mr. Cowan? Yes. I'm gonna miss you, Paige. I know I was late this morning. I won't be anymore. I found a way - to get here in the blink of an eye. - I'll miss you as an assistant. Because I'm promoting you to social worker. Thank you so much. That's so amazing. I am sticking to that not-being-late thing, by the way. You don't have to worry. You'll have a flexible work schedule now. That just caught me off guard. I thought Scott was next in line for the promotion. He has been here longer. It was a tough call. But after you helped Carolyn Selden, I couldn't pass you over. - Carolyn. - You worked a miracle with her. Not that I'm complaining, but my promotion isn't based solely on her case, is it? Well, if you're asking me whether Carolyn's case helped tip the scales in your favour, then the answer is yes. I already told Scott if that's what you're worried about. - This is personal gain. - Excuse me? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Cowan. Congratulations, Paige. Thanks, Scott. - What are you doing up here? - Nothing. Just thinking. - About...? - Cole. He's a human now, you're not gonna find the answers you're looking for in that book. Well, I better find them somewhere because I'm starting to get scared. Well, of course you're scared. Getting married is a huge step. I know that. It just feels like it's more than that. - Have you tried talking to him? - Yes, of course I have. He just keeps avoiding me, like he used to when he was... Belthazor is dead. Cole's just a man now. A man that you love more than anything else in the world. I know. So then why am I so damn confused all of a sudden? It's killing me. Maybe you're right. Maybe you do need the Book. What good is being a witch if you can't use magic when you're hurting? I cannot believe that you're suggesting that. - What about personal gain? - Well, just word the spell properly. Avoid it. You should know how to do it by now. Just be pure. Ask your heart for the answer. Just don't tell Paige. I don't want her thinking she can do it too. - I hate it when you're right. - Really? See, I usually like it. Remember that spell that I cast last week, the one to help Carolyn get her son back? - Well, it had a little side effect. - What kind of side effect? The kind that gets me promoted. I know, personal gain. I've already beat myself up. You don't have to. Demon! Energy ball! Enough of this. Bye-bye. Two witches. Damn her! Okay. Paige, you all right? I'm fine, I'm fine. Just my ego's a little bruised, that's all. - That was odd. - Yeah. Leo. - What happened? - Same old. Demon tried to kill us. Yeah, a very powerful demon. Strangely Source-like. Can't we even get a freaking day off around here? Well, that's why the Elders summoned me. The Source's death has created a power struggle in the underworld, and killing you means direct ascension to the throne. So vanquishing The Source meant nothing? Well, it meant a lot, actually. It set back evil, decades. But that doesn't mean it's made you any less of a target. Yeah, but this demon didn't even seem to know who we were, which, by the way, I find insulting. Well, he knows now, which means you better figure out who he is before he tries again. Attic. My love is strong My spirit weak It is an answer that I seek A question burns within this fire So I may hear my heart's desire Phoebe, we have a-- Phoebe? What? What's going on? How did I get here? That's an excellent question. Oh, my God, what have you done? Me? What--? Who are you? What's the matter? Don't you recognize me? I'm you. Phoebe. Phoebe? That's my name too. Oh, boy. Who...? Who are you people? And how did I get up here? You don't have to be scared of us, honey. Everything is gonna be okay. Any ideas? - It's your spell. Don't look at me. - Yeah, but it was your idea. Excuse me? You might want to stop her before she climbs out the window. Sweetie, hi. Come here. Look. Hi. I can explain. You are dreaming. Dreaming? Yes, dreaming. And... ...you're gonna wake up in your room, and everything is gonna be fine. I'm 1 0, I'm not stupid. Grams! Wow, I do not miss that. What's going on? Cole? Who are you? Maybe this will refresh your memory. You bastard. What--? What was that all about? Ask him. Maybe we should go look for little Phoebe before she escapes into 2002. Yes, we will do that, and you talk to your future self. And fix this, fast. - Future self? - What about the demon? - What demon? - We were attacked downstairs. - Paige. - I'm there. How did she get here? I cast a spell to hear my heart's desire. And I guess my past self and my future self showed up to help me listen. And what desire did you wanna hear? Well, that's between me and... ...me. Come on. Worried? Dude, maybe you can help. We're looking for a demon who can reconstitute himself like The Source. Anyone come to mind? Cole? Can't anybody help me? Welcome back. - I didn't wanna come back. - And yet you have. The Source is getting stronger in you. I've got him under control. Or is it the other way around? There must be something he wants you to tell me. Maybe it's that your plan is gonna fail. Because he knows Phoebe's conjured up her own way of seeing into the future: Her future self, somebody who'll be all too willing to tell her what I can't. What's the matter? You didn't see that coming? I don't need to see the future to know about good witches. They're overly cautious by nature. Her future self will be too afraid to say anything that might make things worse for her and her sisters. She'll preserve the future. How do you know? I've been a seer longer than you've been The Source. You'll learn to trust my instincts. - I'm not The Source. - But you will be very soon. - It's your destiny. - My destiny is to be with Phoebe. I won't change that. Neither will this thing inside of me. Your love won't be enough to save you in the end. You'll see. Kurzon will be attacking them again very soon, this time more prepared. You'd better hurry back if you want them to survive. The good old days. Of course, nobody's going to take you seriously until you stop dressing like a tramp. A tramp? That is so in right now. Oh, you'll learn. Learn what? Look at us. We had such promise. Okay. What do you mean? Does something bad happen to me? I mean, us? Okay, you know what? I don't have time for games. - Okay, there is a demon-- - Don't talk to me about demons! I know plenty about demons. Okay. Then please tell me what you know about Cole. Look, I'm about to marry him. And I have this... ...really bad feeling. Do you remember feeling like that? I remember. But I won't change the past. But this isn't the past, this is the present. But it's my past. And I intend to keep it that way. You know, I already saw you slap him across the face. That's a pretty big coming attraction for my life, don't you think? That was between him and me. I know, but you are me. Oh, okay... Can you give me a little hint, you know? Do you guys get divorced? Does he...? Does he cheat on you? Did you ever get married? What makes you think we aren't married in the future? Because there's no wedding ring on your finger. Please tell me what happened. The spell wouldn't have worked if you weren't allowed to tell me. I didn't need a spell to decide what to do. You must make this decision without using magic. Just like I did. Yeah, and that worked real well for us, I see. Just ask Leo to send me back as soon as possible. Why don't you ask him yourself? Because I'm staying here out of the path of history. And don't argue with me. We both know that when our mind's made up, there's no changing it. Yeah. Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream - Row, row, row your boat - Honey, - Gently down the stream - you've got to listen to me. - Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily - We're just trying to help. Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat - She's your sister. - Yeah, don't remind me. Having a little trouble with young Phoebe? Yeah, enough to make me wanna reconsider having children. Maybe we should just lie to her again. No, I think I have an idea. Stay away from me, or I'll sick Prue on you. Oh, yeah, don't go there. Phoebe, listen to me. I know that this is scary, but I promise you, you are safe here in this house. In your house. Our house. You know how Grams talks about magic all the time? And she likes to say that anything is possible just as long as you believe in it? Yes. Well, that's what happened. Magic brought you here to your future. See that girl right there? That is Piper, all grown up. Yeah. And that is her husband, Leo. And I am... - Me? - Yeah. I wanna show you something. Do you remember this? Daddy sent it to you and me for Christmas. - My album. - Yeah. Except it starts with pictures of you, and it goes all the way, if you look back here, to pictures of me. Why don't you go take that over there and look at it. - Nicely done. - Yeah, at least I could get through to one of my selves. Having problems with geriatric you? I know that woman up there is me when I'm old, but there is nothing familiar about her. I don't know how I got so... -...mean. - She doesn't have any idea how to reverse the spell? No, she doesn't even remember casting it. - How does that happen? - Well, the future changes with every choice we make. Some choices change it more than others. All that matters is that she is here for a reason. They both are. Yeah, but why? What's the reason? To help you listen to your heart. And until you do, they won't return to their times. Well, then I don't think they're ever going to, because old Phoebe is not letting go of this grudge about Cole. Talking about me? Oh, my gosh. Who are you? Sorry? That guy is Cole. He's our fiancé. Wait, you mean he's our prince? The one who sweeps us off our feet? Prince? She's talking about Cinderella. That was my favourite story when I was growing up. I can't believe that I forgot about that. Well, maybe that's why she's here, to help you remember. Don't you think you should help Paige find out who... ...the visitor who dropped in was, before he drops in again? Good idea. Okay, we'll be right back. Keep her company, will you? Yeah, sure. Hi. Looking for me? You sent me up against the Charmed Ones. - What do you take me for? - I foresaw only one witch. How was I to know who she was? - That mistake will cost you your life. - Don't be foolish. Every Source has needed me. My visions have brought them all great power. - I can do the same for you. - Speak quickly. I can help you destroy the power of three with one simple move. I can make you the next Source. It's another trick. If it were, why would I have risked my life to come here? One of the witches has cast a spell, brought her past self into the present. She's a powerless child vulnerable to attack. - So? - So kill the child and the present witch is no more. The entire line is extinguished, and with it, the Charmed Ones. - That's him. - "Kurzon is an enemy of The Source who was banished from the underworld for inciting a failed coup." I don't understand. Why didn't they just kill him? Probably because it's not that easy to do. You guys are gonna need the power of three. But if he's an enemy of The Source, doesn't that make him our ally? No, he's still evil. He's just a different kind of evil. Phoebe. No! - Leave the girl alone. - Belthazor? I thought you were dead. He is. It'll take more than that to stop me. Very well. The Source. Cole? She-- She's all right. She just fainted. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I think so. You saved me. It was so scary. He just came out of nowhere. And then everything went black. Here you go, sweetheart. Thanks. Who are you? - Me? I'm Paige, I'm your-- - Cousin. She's our cousin from Mom's side. But we think of her as a sister. We'll explain it to you when you're older. What about that scary man? Where'd he go? You don't have to worry about him anymore, sweetie. - Doesn't she? - Leo. I'm sorry, but we can't risk her running into Kurzon again. She's Phoebe's past. And Cole saving her... ...means that he saved me too. Hello? He loves us, remember? I think I should take little Phoebe someplace. Someplace safe. - Do you think Kurzon will come back? - I do. I mean, you know, why wouldn't he? He didn't fulfil his objectives. He's right. Okay, you're gonna have to go with Leo for a little while, - but don't worry, he'll keep you safe. - I don't wanna leave. I know, but it's just for a little while, okay? It's for our own good. Come on. Come on, take my hand. Now, hold on tight. Are we going on a plane? No, but you might see some clouds. Where'd this come from? That's Kurzon's. He tried to stab me with it, - but I got it away from him. - Really? You got it away from a demon. That's impressive. Why didn't he use his powers on you? Who knows? The point is that I stabbed him, which means we have enough of his blood to scry for him. Yeah, I'll go get a map and a crystal. You think Kurzon is targeting little Phoebe? - Why would he? - Well, the same reason Leo said. Because she's you. And if he kills her, then there's no Charmed Ones. But how could he know that I conjured her? He's psychic? Or maybe the Seer tipped him off. The Seer? You think she's involved? Wouldn't surprise me. Well, that's just great. Okay, well, we're gonna need a vanquishing spell. Cole, go with Piper, help her. Tell her everything you know about Kurzon. - Where are you going? - Well, I'm gonna try to go knock some sense into myself. I need to send you back fast. - Fine with me. - Not for your sake, for all of ours, especially little Phoebe's. And the only way for me to do that is for you to answer the question that I asked when I cast the spell. Should I or should I not marry Cole? Listen to me. A demon just attacked downstairs and nearly killed little Phoebe, which means he nearly killed us too. Oh, I know what that means. Then why won't you answer the question? Because if I were to say something that could change the future, other lives could be at stake too, not just ours. Yeah, well maybe you're supposed to change the future. Maybe that's why you were sent here. If there is one belief that you and I still have in common, it's that magic happens for a reason. Isn't it possible that you're being given a second chance? To do what? To keep me from turning into a bitter old lady like you. Please. I have lost so much already. Don't make me lose myself too. Sorry. I can't. Then I guess you've doomed us both. - Are you done with that spell yet? - Almost. Would you please stop pacing? It's very distracting. No. - How'd it go? - I still can't get through to her. She didn't say anything about the future? Nope. She's worried about the consequences of changing it. But she is your future. You can't change that. Yes, we can. Our last trip to the future proved that. Phoebe's not burning at the stake any time soon. Maybe you'll let me cast Phoebe's spell and get my own sneak preview. Find out what happens if I take that promotion or not. - You got promoted? - Yeah. By way of a spell, and her friend Scott got stuck with the consequence. Personal gain. If you don't vanquish Kurzon soon, he'll become the next Source. Then suddenly personal gain won't seem so important, because you'll all be dead. Got him. - He's across town. - Okay, bring the crystal. We'll track him on the way. I would stay out of my bedroom if I were you. Unless you want to get slapped again. Be careful. - Aren't you coming? - What can I do? I'm not a demon anymore. Look at me. Look at me! You sent Kurzon to kill Phoebe. - You betrayed me. - For your own good. Your love for her was the only thing holding you back. The only thing keeping you from accepting the full power of The Source. Don't you understand? With her gone, we wouldn't need the Charmed Ones to kill Kurzon. You'd be able to kill him yourself. Phoebe can't die. Otherwise his soul dies too. His love for her is too strong. And I'll need that strength if I'm to recapture what I lost. "His love"? The Source is finally showing through, I see. You'll have to kill her eventually. Our plan depends on it. That was your plan, not mine. I want Phoebe alive, and the next time you betray me... ...I won't miss. Hello, Cole. I've been expecting you. What's the matter, Cole? Afraid I'll tell the girls your secret? - What do you want from me? - My life back, for starters. - You look alive to me. - On the outside, maybe. I can fix that. You can't kill me, Cole. You never could. Even after The Source took you over, a piece of you always loved me. That's not always enough. Yes, it can be. I never married you, Cole. I called it off, and once I found out that you were The Source, my sisters and l had to vanquish you. Why are you telling me this? Because I've spent most of my life wondering what would have happened if we had married. It could have been different for both of us. - Well, it's too late for that now. - Maybe not. That's why I've come to you first. Before I risk everything... ... I have to know if there is a chance to save you. I'm not sure there is. - So you won't even try? - I want to. But he won't let me. He's too strong. Then I'll tell Phoebe the truth. I'll convince her to save you. To save us. But if you change the future, Phoebe might die sooner. - So might her sisters. - Magic happens for a reason, Cole. I don't have faith in much anymore, but I do believe that. I have to trust that I'm meant to change this. You think you're meant to save me? Phoebe reminded me that I once had hope. That we had love. That's why I'm doing this. To keep her from living a life of regret like I lived. I'm not intruding, am l? I can't believe we lost him. - Oh, God, just give me a second. - Hurry, he might still be in the area. - He's at the house. - We'll never make it back in time. - Don't look at me. - Why? You did it this morning. Barely. I went downstairs alone. Not across town with two passengers. Okay, well, Paige, he'll kill Cole. We have to try. Hey! I'm okay. I'm okay. No! Spell, spell, spell. Quick, quick, quick. Hell threw you from its inner core But earth won't hold you anymore Since heaven cannot be your place Your flesh and blood we now erase Oh, no. Leo! Just hold on. Hold on. She saved me. There's your answer. Leo, please. Please, please, please. She's gone. What happened? The spell played out. You heard what you needed to hear. Speaking of orbing up there, when do I get to do that? Well, you shouldn't be in such a rush. You should be proud of what you accomplished. - You saved the day. - I didn't save everyone. No, but that's the great thing about the future. There's always time to change it. So Phoebe won't die that way? No, if I know Phoebe, and I do, she's not gonna let her future turn out that way. Good, and what about little Phoebe? She went back to her time with all this knowledge of the future. Won't that cause complications? I doubt it. The minute she starts talking about magic, Grams will do some hocus-pocus to erase all that knowledge. - That's nice. - That's Grams. Well, I am done. I am off to bed. I have a future of my own to change tomorrow. Have you decided what to do about your promotion? Yeah, I'm gonna turn it down. - What changed your mind? - The three Phoebes. She used magic to change her future, but I used magic to change Scott's. And that's not so fair. I did the rhyme, I will do the time. Good night. So, what do you think Phoebe's gonna do about Cole? I don't know, but I don't think we'll have to wait 40 years to find out. Hi. I just... Had to get out of the house? Yeah. Something like that. Well, at least you came back. You didn't think I would? I don't know. I've been... ...having a lot of crazy thoughts lately about us, and I guess I just thought that maybe you were feeling the same way too. I never told you why I cast that spell, did l? I thought it was to hear your heart's desire. It was to find out if I should marry you or not. - And? - Do you still want to? Well, it's still a part of my plans, that's for sure. Mine too. It's not that I don't still have cold feet. It's just hearing my past self remind me of Cinderella... ...and seeing my future self willing to-- Willing to die for you... And me willing to die for you. I'm gonna ask you a question, and all I want is a straight answer, okay? Can you do that? Okay. Is there something that you're not telling me...
