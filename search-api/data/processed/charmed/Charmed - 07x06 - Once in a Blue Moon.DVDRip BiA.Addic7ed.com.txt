I'm sure they've gotten kidnapped by the latest demon or something. Paige, that is so not funny. You get so emotional when you're PMS. - Yeah, and you get mean. - I do not get mean! I'm above it all. Nothing happens to me. Alrighty, then... Right, nothing happens to you, you're above it all. Fine, so I get a little jumpy. - I get a little pissy, so watch it. - We know. Good news is, we're over it at the same time. As long as we don't kill each other in the process. Which brings me to what we need to talk about. That sounds serious. That calls for ice cream with three spoons. Personal gain! I know, but screw it, it's too good. Anyway, I've been wanting to tell you guys something for a while, - I just didn't know how to say it. - God, are you pregnant again? No, this is not a good thing. Do you guys remember Zola, the Elder who disappeared? - Yeah. - Well, he didn't disappear. He was killed. Leo killed him. Leo killed him? It was an accident, he didn't mean to. - I mean, he was tricked. - You might want to tell that to Zola. Hey, hey. What was that? I was angry. Yeah, but you blew it up without even looking at it. Our emotions are tied to our powers. Apparently, I'm feeling a little weird. Okay, but... I was just looking for a little understanding, that's all. I know, we're sorry. It's just, we're not fans of the Elders now. It's not like Leo could hurt anybody. We don't believe he could do that. The Elders don't think that way. If they prove he did, they won't think he did by accident. Sorry to interrupt. I have to tell you something you're not gonna like. Did you kill anybody else? I'm sorry. - You told them? - I had to, it affects them too. More than you know. They wanna assign you a new Whitelighter. - What? - They're getting suspicious. They wanna make sure you're protected. - Protected from what? You? - They're out of their minds. - He's gonna be here tomorrow. - I hope I don't blow him up. - You can't blow up a Whitelighter. - Why? She blows you up all the time. We have enough people orbing in and out on a daily basis. We don't need another. Got it. That was a great toaster. You probably shouldn't be doing that out in the open. Please, nobody's here. It's midnight. Besides, I would have sensed if anybody was coming. - You didn't sense me. - You're an Elder. Or, at least, you used to be. I'm just here to tell you that maybe you don't want to go by the sisters' house tomorrow. - Just a friendly warning. - Oh, yeah? Did you warn Zola too, before something happened to him? See, the word's out. Nobody knows which side you're on anymore. Which is precisely why I am going to the sisters'. It's a dream job for any Whitelighter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare myself. Leo? Oh, no! Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! That's the second batch! Would you turn that thing off? I'll get the ladder. Forget it! - Okay, what is going on with you guys? - Witches with PMS, look out! Great. Now, not only am I exhausted, but I'm starving. I see your exhausted and your starving and I raise you bloated. Oh, no! No, that is so sad! No weeping, you promised. Have you guys seen the new Whitelighter yet? - No, you probably scared him off. - No, that's the thing, I didn't. He should've been here by now. I'll be back. Better not be with that Whitelighter. Anyone else have weird dreams? - No, you? - Yeah, they were violent and painful. - Hey, wanna go somewhere with me? - Where? I have to go over to Agent Brody's place and try to snoop around. Find out if he's a demon or not. You think he's a demon? - No, I don't. But Piper does. - I don't know what he is. More importantly, we need to find out what he wants. We have enough to worry about without having to worry about him. Can you go with Miss Jumpy, make sure she doesn't orb out in front of him, in case he is a Fed and nothing else? - I can control myself. - I can't go. I have to go to work. I thought you weren't going for a couple of days. I'm not, but that's when Les leaves and I... I have this feeling he's pulling away. Maybe he's pulling away from you because he's, I don't know, leaving? That might be true. Okay, would you just please be careful around Brody, and we'll talk about Leo moving in when I get back. Odin? - Where have you been? - With the girls. Why? What happened? - What's wrong with him? - You don't know? No, I don't know. - Think I did this? - We don't know. He was to report to the Charmed Ones and you didn't want him to. That makes me guilty? How do you know a Darklighter didn't do this? Does it look like a Darklighter did that? You were the last to see him, just like you were the last to see Zola. - It wasn't me. - No? Then who was it? Have a nice nap. Sweet dreams. - Hey, can we talk to you for a sec? - What about? Well, it's about Leo. You know, moving back in. - Is there a problem? - You know, we love... love Leo. But... - But? - You sure this is a good time for this? I mean, like you said, it's really crazy. So much is going on. - Yeah, Zola, the Elders... - Agent Brody. And... he does hear voices. We all hear voices sometimes. We might hear voices, but we don't see floating heads going with them. All the more reason he should be here, where he is safe. - What about the boys? - What? Aren't you afraid they'll be in danger? From who, Leo? That's ridiculous. - No, whoever's after Leo. - Have you thought it through? Look, I just want my family back, isn't that enough? What is going on with our powers lately? I don't know, but it's getting awfully expensive. - What happened? - Good question. I'll be with Leslie, we'll talk about what we were talking about later. - Nothing to talk about. - Want me to cast a spell to clean? No more magic unless we have to. We might have to. I found out why the Whitelighter didn't show. He was attacked. - By a Darklighter? - No, by me. - That's what the Elders think. - You've gotta be kidding. - I was the last one to see him. - Well, obviously not. - Maybe the Elders are setting you up. - Piper... What? They haven't been your greatest allies lately. I'm concerned that it has to do with you guys. I mean, he was gonna come here and be your Whitelighter, your guide. Maybe somebody doesn't want that. - I'll check the Book of Shadows. - I'll do it. Find out about Brody. He could have something to do with this. Listen, I'm sorry for getting you into all this. It's not your fault. Let's go prove it. Since when do you read horoscopes? Since I decided to make Conflicted in Castro my last letter. She doesn't know if she should stay with someone. Worries that their signs might not be compatible. - I didn't know you believed in that. - Well, I don't, but I know you do. I'm just channelling the boss here. Let me see. "Expect the unexpected when the mystical second blue moon of the year rises over the next three nights, and Mars and Aries... Romance can flourish." - Sounds promising. - Yeah, for her maybe. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Les, something's wrong. I know it is. I've been feeling it the last few days. - I've been feeling the same from you. - Do you wanna talk about it? What's there to talk about? I'm moving, you're back and that's it, isn't it? - It doesn't have to be. - Doesn't it? What are we gonna do, fly back and forth and see each other? - You're only moving to LA. - After that I'm moving to Philly. - We'll work it out. - We barely see each other. - How're we gonna do it long-distance? - We see each other. Only when you don't bail at the last minute. Which you do, admit it. - Yeah... - Editorial is waiting on your copy. All right, all right. I... I gotta do this. Okay, so when do you wanna talk? I don't know. How about tonight at dinner? I can't do it tonight. But I can do breakfast tomorrow, and then maybe dinner? And then maybe breakfast again? I'll hold you to it. Definitely a bachelor. Hey! Guess the secret's out. - Can you do that whenever you want to? - And apparently when I don't want. Piper's gonna kill me. - I won't tell her. - Thank you. Not as long as you tell me why you broke into my apartment. Blackmailing. I knew there'd be something. Let me guess. You don't believe I'm a federal agent. You came here to find out if I'm a demon or something, right? Maybe. Best way to find out is to test my blood, isn't it? Funny, for a guy who claims he's not a demon, - you sure do know a lot about them. - No, I know a lot about witches. I know a lot about you. Go ahead, forensic kit's right there. I've got nothing to hide. - May I? - You may. - If that's O positive, you owe me. - I don't owe you anything. I don't have much time Paige. None of us do. If I'm right, there's a threat coming. A power unlike anything you've seen. - You're gonna need my help to stop it. - How do I know you're not the threat? I don't wanna hurt you. - I give up. - We've gotta be missing something. Only thing that attacks a Whitelighter is a Darklighter. He wasn't shot with poison, he was mauled. - What do you mean, like, by an animal? - I don't know. Whatever it was, it's gotta be supernatural. Otherwise, he would've orbed out. There's gotta be more than one, he was so messed up. - So we'll set a trap. - A trap? - With crystals, we've done it before. - What'll you use to lure the demons? Whitelighter, if they're after that. - Elders'll never go for it. - Nobody's gonna get hurt. We'll set the trap for whoever or whatever it is before they attack. If we don't find out who's doing this, they're gonna keep blaming you. This could exonerate you for everything. I'll get the boys, you should take them to Magic School. You can't be saved. You're a danger to them all. Well, that oughta do it. That ought to do what? Burn down the house? Remember, we don't know what we're up against. So I just thought I'd throw in the works. You're not ready yet? You're still working on the vanquishing potion? - I'm refining it. - You called me down here an hour ago! - We don't know when they'll attack. - You mean maul me. You know, for a Whitelighter, you're really wimpy. - That's why they sent him. - I heard that. Relax, will you, please? We're not gonna let anybody hurt you. Hey, where's Leo? At Magic School so he has an alibi when they attack. When they attack, all we do is trigger the crystals? Theoretically, but that's why we have backup. - Did you test Brody's blood yet? - Yeah, he's not a demon. That makes him tomorrow's problem. - How's it going in here? - The sitting duck is still sitting. - Grumpy. Very grumpy. - Remember, it's almost midnight. - That's when things get exciting. - Especially with a blue moon rising. Wait a second. That reminds me of something I read in the Book about how if there are two blue moons in one year, that seems to only happen every 50 years. That doesn't bode well. Pretty... What the hell? - Wake up. Wake up, wake up! - Where are the boys? - The boys are fine, we're not! - Keep it down. - Hey! - Hey, yourself! Look! Oh, my God! Oh, God! - What happened? - We're what happened to him. - What are you talking about? - We're in the cage. I think we trapped ourselves. - No, we didn't. Did we? - I think that dream I had was real. So, you're saying that we did this to him? - You have a better explanation? - That is crazy. As you were saying? Okay, what does this mean? We're demons? - No, we didn't turn into demons. - We turned into monsters. We're testy, but that's ridiculous. It can't be that. It's gotta be something else. - The blue moon? - We gotta get out, this is crazy. Paige, try to orb one of these crystals away. Crystal! Blue moon? Bright side, the Elders can't blame Leo any more. No, now they can blame us. Take him to Magic School and find someone to heal him. How do I explain that? Tell them that we got knocked out. Whatever you do, stay calm and don't turn into anything in front of them. Gotta find a way to stop this from happening. I can't. I have to go meet Leslie for breakfast. - Come on! - I know, but if I don't show up again, he's never gonna talk to me again. Gotta go. Better be home before the moon rises. And stay away from red meat. I thought you were supposed to trap them? - It kinda caught us by surprise. - You see what they look like? Demons? It was night. We have to find who did this and vanquish them before they attack. I'm ordering a lockdown until we catch these beasts. "Beasts". That's a harsh word, don't you think? At least you've been exonerated. I'm sorry I doubted you. So am I. We have a lot of healing to do, Leo, I admit. Forgiveness must prevail if we're to work together. Now, this New Power that we're sensing, it is coming closer and it's more threatening. - Okay, New Power. What New Power? - We don't know exactly. But if it's responsible for this attack, Elders could be next. Help us, Leo. - Okay, I have to find Agent Brody. - Why? He talked about that New Power thing. He must know something about it. Be careful. Watch out for those beasts. - About those beasts... That would be us. - What are you talking about? Those funky powers, the sharp fangs, the claws. We're the ones attacking Whitelighters. Something is transforming us. It may not be this blue moon thing, after all. I have to go. Leslie! Hi! I am so sorry. I'm here now. Things got a little wild back at the house. - Phoebe, it's a quarter to ten! - I know, and I would have called, but... Leslie, please... I said I was sorry! I know you are. You always are. Don't be mad at me. - Come on, I really wanted to be here. - Let me guess, something came up? - Yes. - You can't tell me, you never can. - Not because I don't want to... - It's complicated. I know. Would you stop finishing my sentences, please? Well, why not? They all end the same way! Look... I'm sorry, it's just... I'm frustrated. I didn't think I was gonna like you this much. Yeah, I know the feeling. I gotta go to work. Wouldn't wanna be late on my last day. Paige. Since when do you use doors? Look, I need to talk to you. Great, don't tell me I didn't check out. What? No, you checked out. You knew you would. I need to talk to you about the New Power thing you were telling me about. - Did something happen? - I'm not sure. Let's just say that you aren't the only one who's concerned. - Did you see? Did they attack? - Just curious, how do you even know about them anyway? - That's a... That's a long story. - Why not give me the short version? Look, you said you wanted my help, didn't you? No, I said that you would need mine. Please, will you just tell me what you know? I just know they're coming. That's why I'm here. I... I don't know. Everything seems to fit a certain pattern. Pattern? What pattern? All I know is that they come from ancient times, when they were in power. I'm not sure why, but something happened and they went away. Now they're trying to come back. They've been trying for some time. And to do that, they need power. And that's the pattern. I mean, they're always after it. It won't be long before they come after yours. I think they may have already tried. You can't let them. You gotta do everything you can to stop them, otherwise... - Otherwise what? - They're gonna kill you. Just like they killed my parents. I was... five when it happened. No one knew who did it. That's why I became a cop. To find out. I never would've imagined that it would've brought me to here, but it has. I am not leaving this city until I prove it. You're certain he's the most powerful? - He's their leader. - Was their leader. You're not going anywhere. Why are you doing this? Who are you? - I think a direct approach is best. - We tried that, it's not working. Leo's being drawn back to his family, back to good. But he's not there yet. We must drive him away, make them afraid of him, if we're to succeed. And you're going to help us do exactly that. This one should work if the beasts are possessing us. This'll work if the last one doesn't. It should knock out about ten of 'em. This one... Well, this one, only use if you really, really have to. Why, what is it? A little bit of everything, just in case. - Piper, I'm not using these on you. - You might have to. It's the last night of a blue moon. All we have to do is wait until it passes. Unless it's not the blue moon that's doing this. - Paige said that... - The New Power, I know. If it's after power, why do all this? - It doesn't make sense. - Better safe than sorry. Paige and Phoebe are coming home in a couple of minutes. - We need the cage ready. - I know you're scared. I'm not scared. I'm worried we're gonna kill somebody. You're not gonna kill anybody. I promise. You saved me, now let me save you. Then maybe... it'll be time for me to move back in again. It already is. Grab those. - Who are you? - Actually, I'm about to be you. - Are you coming? - I'll be right there. Do you think we should put some snacks in the cage? - Like what, a wildebeest? - Please don't say "beast". We don't know how long we're gonna be in here. What if I get hungry? We'll have Leo throw us a Whitelighter, don't worry about it. Well, I do worry about it. I just don't like not knowing what's going on. Leo thinks it's the blue moon. All we have to do is make it till morning without eating anyone, and we'll be fine. What if Leo's wrong? I mean, it's not like he's been himself lately. - We've been through this. - No, not enough. Look, trust me, we don't have to worry about him any more. Talking about me? - Where are the potions? - Potions? I think I left them in the kitchen. What was that? What was what? Okay, I'll get them from the kitchen. Keep your eye on us after we transform and make sure we don't move any of the crystals. Oh, no. I don't want Leo here, in case we attack him. - Who could that be? - Oh, I think I know. - I'll take care of it. - You'd better hurry. Why would you attack me? Technically, you're still an Elder. We feel the same way about Elders as we do Whitelighters, so... ...just to be safe. - So, you'd view me as a threat? Probably. - Hi! - Leslie, hey. - Let me guess, bad time? - Actually... - I just wanted to apologise. - For what? Well, for the way I acted earlier. I was... I was just so... - Yeah, really upset, I know. - Now who's finishing whose sentences? - Yeah... - I didn't wanna leave it like that, - that's all. - And I don't either. Is it possible I could call you tomorrow? We're running out of tomorrows. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna call you tomorrow, I promise. Okay. Take care. - Leo, what are you doing? - Television! - Piper, are you okay? - No. Still think Leo's fine? That wasn't Leo. He was possessed or something. - Again? Well, it seems to happen a lot. - And if it did happen again, it can't be connected to the blue moon, it's not up yet. Maybe it's the New Power thing. - Maybe that's who's setting Leo up. - But why? For what? Well, if Agent Brody's right, for power. - Okay, now what? - Throw the potion! Hey, over here! Piper! You have betrayed us! Again! What're you doing? - I'm warning you! Stay out of this! - Oh, no, Piper! Do not... You'll be stopped! - What happened? - You attacked us. Really? How come I'm the one with the headache? We were forced to defend ourselves. - Where's Leo? - I sent him away. - Away where? - That's none of your concern now. You attempted to save him, you failed, that's that. The hell it is! He tried to kill two more Elders! No, he was possessed, you just didn't see it. What I saw was something I never would've imagined. The Charmed Ones turning into demons. No, that wasn't demonic, that was... ...you know, that time of month. - No, it was a blue moon. We didn't have a choice, we can't control it. I'm keeping you till we figure what to do with you. What to do with us? Let us go so we can - find out who the demon is. - Out of the question. You won't be finding out about that New Power. Only they could've sent the demon after Leo. You said yourself they may be coming after the Elders. But what if you turn back into? That was just the blue moon. It won't happen for 50 years. By that time we'll just be a menace to our rest home. So I think you're safe. Very well. See what you can find out. - Nope, not without Leo first. - He can't be trusted. He wouldn't be vulnerable to possession if... You can give us Leo, or you can find your own damn connection to the New Power. What's going on? You're about to be exonerated, again. Book of Shadows. What else do you want from me? I did what you asked. You gotta protect me. They'll find me! We already have. Who were you talking to? What happened? Did you just freeze me? She asked you a question. - Would you rather I blew you up? - Wait, don't. - If I tell you, they'll kill me. - If you don't tell us, we'll kill you. You may want to pick your poison. They're more powerful than anything you've seen. Who is? No! Well, I guess Leo wasn't seeing things after all. Can we get out of here now, please? Whoever you are, stay away from my husband. Brody. Paige, hey. I was getting worried. Yeah, I know. That's why I wanted to call you, to let you know I was okay. I'm glad you did. So, what happened? This New Power wasn't really after you? No, it was actually... ...after something else. I mean that's... That's good, obviously. I was just hoping to, you know, get a lead out of this, that's all. If it makes you feel any better, they were after my brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law? - Yeah, well, not directly. They actually used a demon to get to him. A demon? He's fine now, we dispossessed him. - Wait, you did what? - Well, we got rid of the demon. We get possessed all the time, it's no big deal. Hello? Yeah, sorry. I guess I'm just a little new at this stuff. I thought you said you knew about demons? No, I said I knew a lot about witches. The rest are just... theories. That is, until I met you. Well, be careful what you wish for. - What'd you mean? - What you don't know can't hurt. It's already hurt me, that's why I'm here. I'm glad you're okay, Paige. Thanks. - Bye. - Yeah. Hey. Hey. Packing up? Yep, packing up. I left your stuff in the cabinet. I can put it back if you want. That's okay, I can do it. What time's your flight? Noon. - You ready to come back? - More than you know. - Thanks to you. - Me? No, I didn't do anything. - I just kept the seat warm for you. - You did more than that. And you know it. When I first met you, I was... ...totally lost. That's why I needed to get away from all of this, you know? I couldn't give advice... ...especially not about love. And I realised that... ...I was just afraid. But I'm not afraid any more. Thank you. You're welcome. I guess it just wasn't meant to be? You and me? Maybe not right now. But I do think our signs are compatible, so... See ya. See ya. Where were you? I was worried. I was just... checking on the boys. We found the possessor demon right where you said he'd be. Did you vanquish him? No, but some creature head thing did. - You saw him? - Yeah, we saw it. - Don't think we've seen the last of it. - That's what I'm worried about. Come on, let's go home. I can't. Well, the Elders said you were free to go. It's not the Elders I'm worried about, Piper. I'm worried about you. I'm worried about everybody. The Elders were right. This New Power was after me because I was vulnerable. You know, vulnerable enough to put my family at risk. Piper, you were almost killed because of me. Because of what they did to me. I can't let that happen. I won't. Leo, I know you've been through a lot. I do. But you fought so hard. And the boys need you. I need you. It's too dangerous.
