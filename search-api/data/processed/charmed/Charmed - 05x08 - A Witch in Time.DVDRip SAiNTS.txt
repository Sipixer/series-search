What about great dates? Oh, no. Great dates never end on the front porch. So that only leaves one question: Was this a good date or a great date? I'll tell you in a second. Head's up. Pregnant lady coming through with groceries. Here we go, people. What's wrong with Piper? They gave us paper instead of plastic. - What was that about? - Tell me about it. I practically needed a crowbar to pry them apart. - I meant with you. - Me? Phoebe's the one with the puppy-Iove eyes. - Doesn't that bother you? - No, it doesn't. - Should it? - Yes. Miles is not her type. And she would see that if she wasn't on the rebound. Okay, I don't think so. I think he's a nice guy. - He just got divorced. - So did she. He's wearing cologne. And that's a bad thing? And he's a computer programmer. He works with numbers all day. You know how Phoebe is with math. They have absolutely nothing in common. You're right. You know, we should just vanquish him. All I'm saying is she needs to slow down or she's gonna get hurt. Hey, a little quiet here. What is this, a brothel? You didn't mention that. I'm a little short on cash. Oh, no, they're going upstairs. Should I stop them? No. Only if you want to make a total ass of yourself. But that's up to you. I'm telling you, after the demon-divorce heartbreak and now this mismatched relationship, she's gonna get hurt bigtime. Okay, well, you're gonna get hurt bigtime if you go upstairs and try and get in between of whatever is going on. Are you sure you're ready? - I mean, we don't have to... - I know. - We could just... - Why? I'm glad you feel that way. Get down on the ground. Where did you go? Are you okay? So how come we've never met your couch buddy before? He's more than a couch buddy. His name is Max, and I think he might actually have some potential. Define potential. Okay, Mr. Leo, I will. He is wickedly smart, perversely funny, and has just the right touch of weird style for me. - Hi. - Look who's coming to breakfast. Good morning. Everybody, this is Miles. Did you guys have a nice night and morning? Actually, yes. Well, at least he's honest. Why don't you take something for the road. And don't forget about our lunch date. Do you want to meet at the bistro or at my work? Oh, definitely at work. And then we'll just walk there. Okay. Don't worry, I'll let myself out. Okay, go. Nice meeting you. Okay, something really freaky happened last night when I was with Miles. - You guys are already getting freaky? - No, I had a premonition. He got caught up in a police shootout, and he died. A shootout? That's so Wild West. And besides, don't you normally have premonitions about the evil, nasty people? Yeah, usually, but not always. Your powers are growing. It doesn't surprise me that you're able to detect natural threats as easily. Natural or supernatural, it doesn't really matter. I would appreciate if one of you could come to lunch with me to back me up. Because if something happened to Miles, I just... I would be devastated. Phoebe, well, this sort of sounds like Miles is an innocent we're maybe supposed to protect. And you're not to fall in love with innocents. Besides, you've only known him three weeks. Okay, I think that's a little insensitive. Okey-dokey. And then there's this: "A rebound romance burns fast and hot like a shooting star and leaves the rebounder blind to the flameout ahead." Who wrote that psychobabble? That would be from the "Ask Phoebe" column to "Rebounding in Rockport." Look, the point is, Miles makes me feel... He just makes me feel. And it's really beautiful. So could you please just be happy for me? Toots, I'm happy for you. And if you want, I've got a lunch date, but I'll cancel to go with you. Actually, I think we have a better chance of protecting Miles with Piper's freezing power. I should have brought Paige, at least she could orb. Wasn't my fault we got stuck behind an accident. Okay, 1:15. I'll run in, you try his cell phone. I hope he's still here. The customer you are trying to reach is unavailable or outside... Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - You're blocking me in. - You're parked in a loading zone, lady. I am not parked. I'm sitting here with the engine running. If you just move up, I'll get out of your way. Too late. Already stepped outside of my vehicle. Well, get your butt back inside your vehicle and move it. - I need to get out. - Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute. I don't think you understand. This is an emergency. Not mine. He's gone. Oh, no. This idiot is blocking me in. It's only two blocks, let's run. Okay, this is the street. Right or left? You're asking me? What do we do? I don't remember. - Pick one. Left. - Okay. Get down on the ground. - S.F.P.D., drop your weapon! - Do it now! Piper! Hurry, move fast. Hot, hot, hot. Hot. - Unfreeze it. - How are you gonna explain...? I don't know, I'll figure something out. And thanks, I owe you one. Okay, okay. I give up. Down on the ground. Get down on the ground. Now! Put your hands behind your back. Grab the weapon. Where did you come from? I wanted to surprise you for lunch. Surprise. - You saved my life. - Oh, it was nothing. - It was my life. - Yeah. - I should be dead right now. - Yeah, but you're alive. That's good. You saved my life. - I think we've been over that part. - Did I thank you? No. But you can tonight. What do you say to a candlelit dinner? I'll kick my sisters out of the house. You okay? No, I'm not, actually. Come on, let's go get some coffee. - Who the hell are you? - Name's Bacarra. I was sent here from the future. Well, can't say I've heard that one before. Allow me to offer proof. Recognize this? Where did you get my wedding band? You gave it to me when you sent me with a message. Phoebe's in danger. What kind of danger? She saved a man's life today. The problem is he was destined to die. Somehow she got a premonition she wasn't supposed to get. Angel of Death never gives up a claim. Of course not. And that's why Death keeps coming for this mortal. But your ex-wife falls in love with him and... She falls in love? Sorry to break the news. For the next six months, she tries to save him over and over, until she loses her own life in the process. And that's when you sent me back in time to tell you to kill this man. You see, I'd never get her back if I killed an innocent, especially one that she loved. He's not an innocent. He's meant to die. You'd only be giving Death a... A helping hand. And saving yourself a lot of future pain. A warlock who wants to save me pain? Who are you? I'd never send a warlock with a message this important. You had no choice. If you left your throne, it wouldn't be there when you got back. Your rivals would steal it. What rivals? What throne? In the future, sooner than you might think, you're gonna rule the underworld again. I'm your advisor. Of course, I advised you against this, but... I'd never turn back to evil. It won't happen. It does happen. You unite demons and warlocks to lift the underworld to its greatest power in history. You're the future of evil, man. You said you'd react that way. Well, guess it's up to me to get the job done. Wish me luck. A dozen, dozen roses. How many roses is that? A hundred and forty-four. What do you think he's trying to say? Okay, so based on what I saw, a demon attacks tonight with an athame. So if we want to figure out a vanquish, we have to find out what it is. Well, what do your premonitions have in common? How do they fit together? Well, they don't necessarily have to fit together. Based on my experience, one's a premonition, two is a pattern. Or just really bad luck. Miles stumbled into a police shootout today, and a demonic shootout tonight. So you think the demon is after us? Wouldn't be the first time. I don't know. I think there's something after Miles. Okay, well, we could explore that theory later. Why are you trying to minimize this? And why is everyone else trying to make a bigger deal out of it than it is? Probably because we're following our instincts and not our hormones. Until we know for sure, I think we should take steps to protect Miles. Okay, well, I'm already all over Miles. I mean with, you know, the protection stuff. I even cancelled our dinner for tonight. Think that's such a good idea? If something's after him, our best chance to find out what is if you go through with your plans. She's right, we can surround him with the family for protection. You mean like a family dinner? - Really? - Yeah. - Are you cooking? - Probably. Then I better get ready. Yay, more flowers. I know, lacks originality. But they're a lot easier to carry than what I really wanted to give you. - Oh, yeah? What was that? - Beachfront property. Hey, you saved my life. You know, we can always eat later. I'm not really that hungry... ...for dinner. What happened to the candles and the romance? Well, unfortunately, our plans have changed. I just really wanted you to get to know my family. I hope you don't mind. Phoebe's said so much about you. We just wanted to get to know you a little better. Yeah, yeah. Although probably not as much as we just did. Okay, okay, let's eat. Sit here next to Leo. - More flowers. - Yay, more flowers. Well, I'm starving. You should've seen Phoebe dive out of nowhere. She could have easily been killed. I would do it all again. Yeah, that's Phoebe. Friend to all. Would risk her life to save a stray dog. So she says that you have a cabin in Tahoe? Near Heavenly. He's gonna take me there next weekend. - So you're a big skier? - He used to ski competitively. You should see the pictures on his wall. Excuse me. - Is Phoebe okay? - Oh, no, you don't. She's having dinner with a guy. She's fine. Well, listen to me. I got a visit from a warlock, and he is after her guy. Okay, well, thanks for the tip. We'll handle it. Well, I'll stay here on stakeout to help. No, you can't. Look, warlocks we can handle. Demonic ex-husbands we cannot. You have to get out of here before she sees you. Wait, did she get a premonition today? Did she save some guy's life? - Okay. - Hurry, she's coming. Go! Looking forward to dessert. Hey, look, I know you think Miles and I have nothing in common but... Later for that. Look, there's a warlock after Miles. I just found out, don't ask me how, but you need to get back in there. Here, take these. What? Miles was killed while we were serving dessert. Look out! - He won't freeze. - Blow him up. Piper! - Paige, the athame. - Athame. This warlock is not in here anywhere. Miles is still out cold. You sure you don't want me to heal him? No, he's just got a bump on the head. He'll be okay. Well, he's lucky to be alive. That was one powerful guy that attacked him. I just don't understand how a warlock this strong cannot be in this book. Well, I didn't have a chance to tell you guys yet. Cole dropped by right before the attack. He knew it was coming. It figures he's involved in this. No, I'm not so sure. He was trying to warn us. We need to find out what else he knows. I wanna check with the Elders, see what they know about our innocent. Clearly he was the target of the attack tonight. Hurry back. Should we tell Phoebe about Cole? No. She's got enough to worry about tonight. - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? Okay, I think. What...? What happened? What do you think happened? I don't know. I remember you jumping over the table and then... I don't know. What happened was mouldy plaster and a really heavy chandelier. Are you trying to tell me you saved my life again? Yeah. Okay, I'm having a really bad day here. Or a really good day, depending on how you look at it. You escaped disaster twice. That's two more times than most people could say in a lifetime. I'm starting to think that you should stay by my side until my luck changes. Maybe you're right. Your kisses kill me. Right back at you. Come out, witch! I know you're here. Calm down, you're embarrassing me. - Who are you? - You. I remember being here. Let's see now, the witch you're looking for has the power of... ...invisibility, right? How did you do that? I'm not here to hurt you. I need you. We're taking over the underworld. - What did you just say? - You heard me. I came from the future on a different mission, but this is a much better plan. - Look, even if you are me, we can't... - I am, and we can. Do you know what I just did? I faced all three Charmed Ones. I was only expecting one, but there they were. And here I am, still alive. - Yeah, so? - So with my knowledge in magic, I realize we can take them out. Of course, we'll need to steal their Book of Shadows first, but... That's crazy. Evil can't touch that book. Sure it can, with a little blood from their line and a spell from the future. - What spell? - To cloak ourselves in goodness. And don't worry, it wears off. The Book of Shadows. If we got that, we'd be revered as lords. Now that's the spirit. Let's get to work on this spell. You could have told us he was a Jedi-master warlock. - I didn't know. - Well, what do you know? His name is Bacarra. He claims to be a future associate of mine. How does he know that? - Because he was there. - In the future? He came to tell me that Phoebe dies in six months from trying to save her boyfriend from the Angel of Death. Oh, no. We're screwed. No, it's not all bad. Now that we know what's after Miles, we can vanquish it. No, you can't fight Death. If it's Miles' time to go, there's nothing we can do. I told Phoebe rebounds never work. Bacarra told me I could save Phoebe's life by taking out this Miles. I refused. That must be why he attacked at the manor, to do the job himself. Wait a second. Why is a warlock helping you in the future? It really doesn't matter. I'll help you find Bacarra before he kills anyone. Well, that's not such a bad idea, considering you sent him here. Or will send him here or whatever. Just keep your guard up. Bacarra knows things that we don't. And do whatever you can with Phoebe. She needs to let Miles die. It's the only way to save her life. Why are you so nervous? I'm the one with all the bad luck. No, I just think I'm still a little tense. When I'm feeling tense, that's where I go to relax. That old rusty balcony? Yeah. I sit out there, I look at the stars... What do you say? No, are you kidding me? I'm keeping you away from high places and sharp objects and loose wiring. You're restricted, mister, to a soft mattress and fluffy pillows. Hey... So the Elders wouldn't confirm or deny that Death wants Miles. So I basically took that as a confirmation. Still, why would Phoebe get premonitions off a guy that she's not meant to save? Well, Miles just isn't just any guy. I mean, they have an intense connection, physically and emotionally. So you think their love connection opened up some sort of psychic connection? Either that, or a damn-the-world attitude. Okay, Leo, we can take it from here. - Hey. - Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Is Phoebe here? It's kind of a family emergency. Yeah, okay, sure. Hey, what's the emergency? We have a strong reason to believe that it's... It might sort of be Miles' time... ...to die. Yeah. Cole said he sent the warlock back from the future because you're gonna die trying to save Miles from the Angel of Death. So you want me to let this guy that I really care about die because Cole says so? Phoebe, this has nothing to do with Cole. You know just as well as I do that you can't stop Death. This has everything to do with Cole. It's not just Cole saying it. Leo thinks that, you know, it might also be Miles' time to die. Leo thinks? He thinks? That's the best you got? That's the airtight case you came here to present to me? Phoebe, we are just trying to save you from a hell of a lot of heartbreak. I know, sweetie. And I appreciate it and I love you both for it, but I am really happy. Miles makes me really happy. And I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to try to protect him. But you can't. You gotta let him go. He's gotta move on. You know the Angel of Death... Okay, enough about the Angel of Death. A warlock wants Miles. You saw him and I saw him. So now let's vanquish him. Come on. Please, come on. - Okay, we're going - Be careful. - Go, go, go. - We're going! Help. Somebody help! Phoebe, help me! Phoebe! Miles? - Phoebe! Phoebe! - Miles. Pull me up. Okay, hang on. Stay away from me. - What? Why? - Something's wrong with me. Or after me. You're gonna get hurt. - No, it's... - I'm serious, Phoebe. You have to go. Okay, look, Miles, whatever you're going through, whatever is... Whatever's happening to you right now, we're gonna get through this together. I'm... I'm scared. I know. Not again. Phoebe is never gonna let Miles die voluntarily. Well, I can't say I blame her. Me neither, but we gotta do something fast before she really falls in love with that guy. Then there's our other problem. - Blow him up. - And get knocked on my ass again? Piper! Piper. There's two of them. What's he doing? Don't worry. We'll take good care of the Book. I don't know how he did it. He just took it. He drank some weird potion with my blood in it. Maybe it's some weird future magic. It's impossible. One warlock does not have the power to steal the Book of Shadows. No, there was two of them, but they were the same guy. They tag-teamed us. Who cares how they did it, you guys. They stole the Book of Shadows. It's gone, and I'm not entirely sure what could be worse. We could be dead. Yeah, well, we're gonna be soon without it. It's okay. We're gonna get the Book back. We just need to stay calm and stay together. Okay, I know you're here, so you might as well just come out. I realize this doesn't look good. Cole, you've sunk low in the past. But I never dreamed that you would murder my boyfriend. I'm not here for Miles. I'm here for Bacarra. He's out of control, and I'm not gonna let him hurt you. - Oh, so you're here to protect me? - That's right. Okay, well, stop with the protecting. I am overprotected. You have to let me live my life. You're not gonna have a life with Miles. Death wants him. Death is gonna get him. Says you. Why are you holding on to him so tight? You lost your right to ask me that kind of question a long time ago. - Hey. - Hey, Phoebe. Demon attack, we need you. Meet me out front of Miles' apartment. I'll orb you out. Well, I can't leave Miles alone. No, a warlock stole the Book of Shadows, Phoebe. - He's not just after Miles, he's after us. - Oh, my God. Okay, well, I'll wake Miles up and bring him with me. You don't have to do that. I'll take care of him. Hold on. Are you kidding me? - If I kill him, you'll never trust me. - Phoebe. Are you out there, Phoebe? - Hello? - Phoebe? Phoebe, where are you? Hello? What's going on? Did I hear you talking to someone? Meet me outside. I have to go. There's a family emergency. Is everything okay? Yeah, I hope so. I'm taking a really big risk here. I don't know. What if my life needs saving while you're gone? I think you'll be safe tonight. I knew their magic was good, but I had no idea. Careful with that. There's a vanquishing spell in here for every demon we've ever met. Nobody is gonna challenge us. Not even Cole. Only one spell in there matters to us now. "To disempower a witch." I'm almost done mixing the ingredients that will infuse the magic. Wait a second. It says here you need a fresh human heart. Not a problem. Do we know how Bacarra even got here? The Elders think that he used a time ripple. Whenever something stops a destined event from occurring, it sends a ripple through time. And a powerful warlock like Bacarra could have used it if he knew the place where destiny was cheated. Well, that would be where Phoebe and I saved Miles. I can't believe we're still on this. Death isn't after Miles, Bacarra is. And look, I'm not crazy. I just caught Cole staking out Miles' apartment to try and intercept him. Yeah, Bacarra didn't pull the trigger in the alley. But how do we know? Maybe mind control is one of his future powers. Okay, let's not argue about how he got here. He's here and he's got our Book. Okay, that book holds a century's worth of magic that he can use against us. Great. Too many spells and potions to remember, let alone defend against. We're dead. - Again. - And again. Ladies, death cannot be feared. For death, in time, comes to all witches. You know, the witch who says she's not scared in battle is a liar. The real witch is the one who fights. - Honey. - Yeah? - Zip it. - Okay. I thought it was worth a shot. I actually think Leo's right. We've been through this before. We can't get scared just because Bacarra has the Book of Shadows. In fact, maybe the Book has been holding us back. Bacarra knows exactly what we're gonna do because he knows exactly how we're gonna fight. Okay, so if we're gonna vanquish him, and we will, we need to change our tactics. We need new potions, new spells. Stuff that he's never seen before. - Let's go. Break. - All right. That's what I was trying to say. Okay, the obscuring fog spell is done. We could use this if we need to fog up the joint for cover. So that makes nine defensive and 14 offensive spells. Okay, we've almost got all the new potions bottled. Before the passing of this hour Take away all their powers Huh? What does that mean? I don't know, but I don't like the smug look on their faces. Okay, that didn't go so well. Okay, well, how about this: We call upon Medusa's bones Turn their flesh into stone No. Okay, Piper, blow up something. - I got nothing. - I can't orb. Leo? Oh, my God. And then there were none. Leo, why are we here? Do you realize that I think I just watched my sisters die? This is the alley where you saved Miles. Just try and stay calm. We still have a chance. A chance? I just saw my sisters get incinerated, Leo. You can't heal ashes. I don't want to heal them. I want to set destiny back on track. What? It's already happened. There's nothing we can do. Not necessarily. The time ripple Bacarra opened is gonna stay open until he goes back through it and returns to his time. What are you looking for? A hidden door. It's gotta be around here somewhere. If we can find it, we can travel back and rewrite history like Bacarra did. Make it so none of this has ever happened. The underworld belongs to us. Which one of us? Still distrustful. Well, don't lose that quality. It will help us go far. Now, call a meeting of the demonic leaders and demand your rightful position. Don't wait another second. And what are you gonna do? Return to the future where I belong. You can catch up with me in about six months. If we could find the ripple, it should send us back. It's an infinite slipstream through time. Well, what if it carries us forward? It won't. Bacarra used it to get here, so it'll keep flowing backwards until he enters it to reverse it. Okay, so we're going back. What if it takes us too far back? Well, we could wind up with tails. What time did Phoebe save Miles yesterday? A little after 1. Okay, well, use your watch. Found it. Go, now! No! The mobile customer you are trying to reach is unavailable or outside... Don't panic, I'm not a demon. Okay? I'm you, obviously, from the future. Apparently not very far in the future. I just bought that top. Listen to me. Miles has gotta die. It's his time. It's his destiny. And if Phoebe saves him today, she'll be killed by a warlock, along with Paige. Wait a minute, slow down. Why would a warlock...? Because Phoebe falls in love with Miles, and she just keeps saving him until... Look, don't argue with me, okay? We don't have time for this. Just let Miles die. Look, I don't know who you are or what you are, but how do...? What did you do that for? When Phoebe asks left or right, go to the right. - What are you talking about? - Just remember right. And when this is all over, make sure Phoebe knows it was just meant to be, okay? Oh, and by the way, the next time she falls for a guy, do not stand in her way, okay? I'm not standing in her way. He's gone. Oh, no. - This idiot is blocking me in. - It's only two blocks, let's run. - Okay, this is the street. Right or left? - Good question. What do we do? I don't remember. I don't know, Phoebe. I don't know here. Piper, come on. Right, go right. Oh, God, forgive me. We're going the wrong way, it's behind us. S.F.P.D. Drop your weapon! On the ground, now! Put your hands behind your back! Phoebe, can we? Okay. How long have you guys been standing there? Long enough to know you've got some serious '80s dance moves. I guess you don't need comfort food. - What you doing? - A little laundry. - Yeah, you don't do laundry. - Yeah. - Are you okay? - No. Are those chocolate chip? I'm never gonna be okay losing an innocent. You know, and I just... I'm having a really hard time accepting the fact that I wasn't supposed to save him. Wasn't Miles a little bit more than just an innocent to you? I think I wanted him to be. For all the reasons Piper said. But I just have to concentrate on me right now. You know, and not be afraid that I may never find love again. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. You will definitely find love again. You think? Actually, I know. And I, for one, can guarantee you that when it does happen for you, I will not be holding you back at all. Thanks, I think. Piper, is there something you know that we don't know? Well, let's just say I had
