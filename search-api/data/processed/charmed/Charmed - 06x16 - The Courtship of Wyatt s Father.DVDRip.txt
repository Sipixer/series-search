it was a fun party. Oh, I still can't believe that Wyatt is 1 already. Oh, I know. You can't. - Nice to finally meet you, Leo. - Yeah, you too. Frank and some of the other dads get the kids together on Saturdays, if you're interested. - Yeah, thanks. - Excellent. - Thank you. - Bye. - I'll call you. - Okay, great. I am exhausted. Did you have fun? - Did you like it? - Yeah, he was a really good boy and only made Mommy freeze the room once. He was excited, it's his birthday. He was excited to see you. He misses you. I know. I miss him too. Hey, you guys want any more champagne? Come on, we don't want it to go to waste. - How about it, Dad? - Elders aren't allowed to drink. Oh, come on, when on Earth, you should do as earthlings do. - Sorry. - Not that I'm complaining or anything, because you guys did such great work, but champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, oysters? Aren't the kids a little young for the aphrodisiacs? They're aphrodisiacs? Who knew? Bubbly? - Paige? - What? Come on, there were milk and cookies here too. You know, maybe if there were more kids living in this house I would know what to get. Did you ever stop to think about that? Excuse me. She's been weird since she changed her hair colour. She'll probably change it back. Okay, forget about the strawberries, she's on to us. What do you mean? She knows about Chris? No, she knows we're up to something. I can't believe how hard it is to get two people laid. Paige, that is disgusting. Well, it's what we're trying to do, right? No, we are trying to romance Piper and Leo together so they can conceive Chris, our nephew. And that's different how? Well, because what you said is very Springer, what I said is very Oprah. Well, whatever show we're watching, we're running out of time. At least Chris is. We should probably tell him. Yes. Chris. Hey. So how's it going? - Not so good. - Well, what do you mean? - What does she mean? - We're running out of ideas. Well, that's too bad, because it has to happen today or I don't happen. - Wait, today? - Yeah, I did the math. And if I'm not conceived by midnight tonight, that's it. I won't be born. Which means I won't be coming back from the future - to warn you about Wyatt turning evil. - Yeah, see, that time-travel thing... What about making a love potion and just, like, slipping it to them? No, we're not tricking your parents. Why not? I'm desperate. Hey, look, I have an idea. Call me crazy, but why don't we just tell them the truth? Sure, let's give them a massive case of performance anxiety. - We're running out of options. - And time. Wyatt! Arrow! I got you. I got you, I got you. You're okay. You're okay. Thanks for saving my life. Hope it wasn't for nothing. - Is that enough to scry with? - Only one way to find out. At least he waited till after the party to attack, that was nice of him. What I don't understand is, why would the darklighter attack at all? I mean, with all of us here at the same time, it's suicide. All the more reason to find him and stop him before he tries again. I don't think he was after a whitelighter, I think he was after me. Or Wyatt. Well, then why don't you take Piper up there - and take Wyatt too? - Yeah, I'll go with you. But you're not allowed. All right, so then we'll go to the magic school. You'll be safe there. You can't be hurt, right? That's great. One big happy family. You change him, I'll pack him. Come on. Think now is a good time to tell them? No. The sooner we take care of the darklighter, the sooner we make you. - I'm gonna start scrying. - And I will go start the love potion. Wait. I thought you were against making the love potion. Not if it's gonna save one of my two favourite nephews. - Nice play, my friend. - It worked, didn't it? Not yet it hasn't. Not until the witches come after you. They'll come. - They always do. - But will the Elder? I mean, now that he knows you're after him, won't he think it's too dangerous? Not this Elder. He's blinded by fatherhood... ...by his unwavering desire to protect his son. He can't be sure I'm not after the boy too. He'll come. But... ...he won't be immune to the poison. - I'll need a dozen more for later. - They're being forged as we speak. You're all right to go through with this, Damien? A deal was struck, I was chosen. Besides, he deserves to get what he paid for, doesn't he? Leo out of the way. Just make sure the code's properly prepared. We only get one shot at this. All right, arm up. But remember, we're only supposed to distract the witches, not harm them. They're not the target this time... ...the Elder is. These aren't just books, Sara, they're legacies. Handed down over the ages by other magical beings. And worthy of your great care. - Understand? - Yes, sir. - Good. - Gideon. Leo. What a pleasant surprise. - How are you, my boy? - I've been better. A darklighter attacked, I think he's after me. - Are you certain? - I don't know. He may be trying to get me out of the way to get to Wyatt. I dropped Piper and Wyatt off at the nursery. I hope that's all right. Of course. Absolutely. I better get back to Phoebe and Paige, see if I can help. No, you shouldn't. You should go up with the other Elders, where you'll be safe. - What about the darklighter? - It's not your responsibility. That's for the sisters to handle. It's what they do. Well, I can't just sit around while someone is after my son. I'm a father now. No, you're an Elder now, and it's time to start acting like one. Don't you see? You don't just put yourself at risk by staying here on Earth, you put all Elders at risk too. If they get you, they get access to us all. - I know, but... - You can't justify staying here any longer, not with this, not anymore. It's time to fully accept your calling... ...one that necessarily transcends the sins of the flesh, family, even fatherhood. One that requires you to cut the ties that bind for everyone's sake. I can't. At least not until I know my son is safe. I'm sorry. What are you still doing here? Thought you'd be out and about by now. Clarence, hey. - Didn't hear you come up. - You mind? Please, go ahead. Beautiful day outside, isn't it? Is it? I haven't really noticed. I've been too busy... ...rechecking something. Whole world seems to be too busy nowadays. Nobody's got time to just enjoy their day anymore. Well, it doesn't get any better in the future either. I mean... - I'd imagine. - Future don't mean squat to me. I'm too old to worry about it. Shouldn't to you either. You're too young. Well, unfortunately... ...l'm kind of obsessed with it. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I just... I just probably need to eat. What you need is to get out of this hole. Get some sun. Live a little. Believe me... ...l'm trying. Do that. I thought you were making a love potion. - I am. - Then why did it blow up? - Maybe I'm trying too hard? - Or maybe it just wasn't meant to be. - Phoebe! - Come on, you weren't thinking - the exact same thing? - No. Okay, fine. But for, like, a second. The point is, Chris is meant to be. But not if he changed too much by coming here. You know, messed up his own time line. We're talking about his very existence. Paige, I know, but there's only so much we can do. Especially now, with that darklighter out there. I just think that we have to face the reality that Chris' destiny might have been just to come here and warn us about Wyatt, and that's all. Hey. Oh, my God, Chris, I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. I've actually been wondering the same thing. You have? Yeah. I kind of have the strangest feeling, like... I don't know, it's really hard to explain, but it feels like I'm... I'm floating. Like I'm not really here, you know? That doesn't sound good. Well, you have to fight it. We still have time. Not much. I've never seen it do that before. Maybe that means there's more than one? I'll go get Piper. - I'll go too. - No, you stay here. Okay, finish the potion. When we come back, your parents will be in the mood. Okay. - Are you sure this is the place? - Yeah, down that alley. Thank God we didn't orb in. We couldn't, they'd have known we were coming. Well, maybe they know already. - What do you mean? - I mean, since when do darklighters hang out in broad daylight like this? It could be a trap. Maybe you should stay here. No, I'm the bait, remember? Besides, if it is a trap, you might need me to help you orb back. Well, I got Phoebe, you get Piper out of here for Chris'... For Wyatt's sake. Let's just do this. I don't see anything. You take Piper. Phoebe, watch out! Behind you! Piper! Phoebe. - Oh, my God, you're bleeding. - Yeah. Maybe we should get me to the hospital. Yeah. I got you. Hey! Hey! Phoebe? Paige? Where's my car? What's going on? Where did everybody go? That's a good question. Well, they've gotta be here somewhere. - I think we should get out of here. - No, not without Phoebe. She's hurt. - Didn't you see her fall? - But at least she's alive. - What does that mean? - I don't know, but I think we need to get off the street while we figure this out. The hospital. If Paige couldn't get to you, she'd take Phoebe to the hospital. Memorial's down the street. Piper, you don't understand. We can't worry about them right now. We need to worry about us. - Leo. - Piper. You're not supposed to be here. Yeah, well, you're not supposed to be here either. At least not in one piece. Come on. - What's wrong with your powers? - I don't know. Run. Go, go, go! You can run, but you can't hide. You're in my world now! What part of "don't hurt the witches" didn't you understand? What was I supposed to do? They'd already killed three of us. So what? You're expendable. We all are for this. It's bad enough one's wounded now, but none of them were supposed to end up there. None of them! We were only meant to separate the Elder from his protectors. To make the witches fear he died so they wouldn't try to look for him. Still, just because she's with him doesn't mean she can protect him. No one has powers in the ghostly plane. That's why Damien wanted him sent there. But that's not the point, now, is it? Damien may be forced to kill her now too. And that was specifically not what he was hired to do. Worse, the other witches may be less inclined to accept the death of a sister than of a brother-in-law, especially with their history. All the more reason for us to keep them distracted... ...at all costs now. No broken bones, no internal bleeding. Other than a mild concussion, I'd say you're a very lucky woman. Great. Does that mean I can go home now? No. Actually, I think I'd like to keep you here overnight for observation. Oh, no, that's not possible. Miss Halliwell, I don't have to remind you, you took quite a fall. It's possible you might have more than just a concussion. And sometimes other symptoms don't develop for 24 hours. Yeah, well, I don't have 24 hours. I gotta go. Gotta go. - You'll have to sign a release. - That's fine. If you feel any dizziness or light-headedness, call me. Otherwise, I'll see you in a week to remove the stitches. Thanks. - All right, come on. - This way. - Let's go. Get him in three. - All right, got it. Hey. What did he say? Are you all right? Yeah. Well, he's releasing me, isn't he? Okay, don't worry about this, Paige. We're gonna figure something out. Okay, but what about Chris? - What about Chris? - What if he doesn't exist anymore because his mom and dad don't exist anymore? No, if Piper were gone, I would sense it. I know it. - Oh, my God, what happened? - A truck hit a bus. - Phoebe? Paige? - They're not here, I'm telling you. - They have to be here. Phoebe's hurt. - Not in this plane she's not. The blast, when you blew up the darklighter, it must have knocked us into this other place. One that coexists with our world, but not with our lives. What are you talking about? What world? I don't know. I don't think we're here by accident. I think it's the darklighter's plan, to have us here without our powers and without your sisters. Phoebe? - Excuse us. - Coming though. Phoebe? - What? - Do you hear something? Hear what? I could have sworn I heard someone call out my name. BP's dropping. We're losing him. Two hundred fifty cc's of lido. He's flatlining. Come on, come on. Did anyone call the driver's family? - We still got no pulse. Paddles. - Paddles. - Two hundred joules. - Charging. Clear. Piper, we gotta keep moving. We can't stay here. Damn it, Piper, I don't want you to get hurt too. Okay. Am I dead? Leo, what's going on? Leo. Are you an angel? I know what plane we're on. The ghostly plane. He's back. He's stabilizing. Sir, do you know where you are? - Do you know your name? - Let's go. Leo. Leo. - You must be an angel. - Leo? What? What's wrong? Piper. Come on. I'm telling you, I felt Piper, as if she were standing right next to me. - But she wasn't. - I know. - I'm still trying to figure that part out. - Phoebe, Paige. Chris, you're okay. Which means Piper and Leo are okay. Well, I don't know about them, but I'm... I'm definitely running out of time here. - What? - I don't know what else to try. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? There's nothing else to try. Oh, great. Why don't you try telling that to Chris as he fades away. No, I can't. Right. Well, here's the deal. You felt Piper. That means she's gotta be out there somewhere. And if we can figure out where, then maybe we can figure out how to bring them back. You said we weren't gonna lose her. - The bus driver. - The bus driver what? Well, he was dead. I mean, at least for a little bit. So maybe that wasn't a coincidence. Maybe he actually did see Leo, in limbo. That's good. No, that's bad, because that would make them dead. Not if someone put them there, like the darklighter. - The one Piper vanquished? - Unless it wasn't really a vanquish. It was just made to look like a vanquish. Okay, ghost. Ghost, ghost, ghost... Sorry. Good thing you're immune to the poison. Yeah, too bad you're not. My, my. Impressed? Very. - That should stop the bleeding. - Thanks. You know, I rather imagined meadows, waterfalls, maybe even a harp. Well, this isn't the afterlife. It's... ...a place before that, to ease the transition. And lucky us, we're stuck here. That is, until our friendly darklighter helps us move on permanently. No, we're not gonna let that happen. We've been through a lot more than this. - Have we? - Are you kidding? Ever since we met, it's been one ordeal after the other. Wow, you make it sound so romantic. That's not what I meant. I mean, look at... ...everything we've been through... ...everything we've overcome. This is just one more thing. This isn't where it ends. I promise. All right, so how do we get out of here? I don't know. I gotta figure the darklighter has a way, maybe a portal. - Masked by the explosion? - Maybe. Although somebody's gotta be helping him with a hell of a lot more powers than a darklighter. Do you think the portal's still there? Probably. The question is, how do we access it without our powers? We make Phoebe and Paige use theirs. I'm serious. We're on the ghostly plane, so why can't we, you know, haunt them? Make contact like other normal ghosts do. Because not all other ghosts do. It... It takes years to learn how to cross over. - Besides, you need a connection. - A bond? You mean, like sisters? Come on, I know them. I know they're looking for us, and I know they were at the hospital. - I felt them. I can't explain exactly... - You don't have to. Far be it for me to question the power of three after all these years. Okay, so let's go. They'll be at the house, at the Book of Shadows. That's probably where the darklighter will be waiting for us. He knows us. He studied us. Not good. It's almost time, Chris. Clarence. What are you doing here? Actually, I've come for you. It's okay, son, I know. Who are you? Someone who was sent to make this easier for you. "This"? What do you mean, "this"? I think you know. You're an angel of death. Yours is a unique situation, Chris... ...one which requires special handling. That's why I wanted to meet you early. Ss you could get to know me, trust me. There's really nothing to be afraid of. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. - Don't fight it, Chris. - It'll only make it more difficult for you. - No. Forget that. All right, I still got time. You stay away from me. You sure a sÃ©ance is the right move? Well, if they are stuck in the spirit realm, then they're ghosts, right? - Hopefully. - What, now you're a pessimist? Hey, a girl's allowed to vacillate. It's not like this is an exact science, right? Okay, the spell is done. Okay, let's do this. Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy, but... Yeah, we're working on it. We're working on it. You don't look so good. Okay. Sister spirit, we call to thee Cross on over, so we may see Wait, that wasn't supposed to happen, was it? I'm thinking no. Okay, now what? I don't know, I guess we try to make contact. Chris? Not exactly who I was going for, but I guess it'll work. What are you doing here? Ceasing to exist, I think. - What happened, where did you go? - I just saw Piper and Leo. Where did he go? I don't know. Ask him. What are you talking about? "Ceasing to exist"? No time to explain. I'm a connection to your sisters, and they wanna know how to get you guys back. They think somebody made a portal - for the darklighter to pass through. - Somebody who? Darklighters! Chris, where are you? Not so loud. Leo. Come on. Come on. Piper's not here anymore. I can't sense her. It's too late. And not just for Piper and Leo. Take care. Chris? But if there is a portal, it's gotta be nearby. Leo, what are you doing? Trying to save you. You... You mean you're trying to save us, don't you? Look, you need to sit down. Maybe since the arrow went straight through... It'll just take longer. - They'll find a way. - How? We never even had a chance to tell them where to meet us. They'll figure it out. I know them. In time? Look, Piper, no matter what happens... - No. - Keep trying to make contact. - I don't wanna hear it. - He's not after you, he's after me. Would you please stop trying to save me? I'm sorry I got you into this. Yeah, just one ordeal after another, right? I never stopped loving you. Phoebe. Paige. - Gideon, we need your help. - What's wrong? - We think we may have lost Chris. - What? And Piper and Leo and us too, if we're not careful. Somebody's got a bunch of darklighters after us. And one's got Piper and Leo trapped. - In the ghostly plane. - The spirit realm. - Same thing. - Right. We made contact, but then we lost them. And we lost Chris too. Although we're not sure why, - because she can tell if Piper's dead. - Yeah, and I can't. She must be still around somewhere, we just don't know where. So we need to figure out how to use the darklighter's portal to get them out. And if you follow all that, you're really a very powerful Elder. But darklighters don't have the power to make portals, let alone use them. Right, we have to figure out who can. I warned Leo. I told him something like this might happen. What do you need? Well, we know where to find the portal, we just don't know how to reverse it. There. Handy. Leo? Morning. What are you doing? Just trying to sense them. Any luck? You don't look so good. I know. Listen, about last night... I don't have any regrets, if that's where this is going. It's not. But I'm glad you said that. Because I don't either. I just want you to know that I don't have any expectations. Because I know everything that you went through when I became an Elder. And it just... It wouldn't be fair to put you through that again. I'm not sure I understand. Well, neither one of us wanted me to become an Elder. But I did anyway. I was supposed to go up there right away, but I didn't. Because you wanted to find out who Chris was and to protect Wyatt. Those aren't the only reasons I didn't go up there, Piper. I was holding on to you. And because of that, I've put you at risk, and I've put my son at risk. I can't let that happen anymore. I won't let that happen. Well, fortunately you won't have to worry about that for much longer. I'm a little surprised, actually. I didn't really think you'd come back here. I thought I knew you better than that. Oh, well. Let her go. You don't want her. No. But I can't pass up my opportunity, can I? It's in my nature. Besides, I wouldn't want a Charmed One coming after me when this is over. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Because this time, I'll vanquish you for real. Well, it's about time. Who sent you? Yes! I'm back. Wait. What...? How is that possible? Don't ask me, ask... ...them. Paige, come on, quick. We gotta get him to Gideon. I thought I'd find you here. How are you doing? The wound is healed, if that's what you mean. - No, it's not. - You were right. I know that now. - I can't justify staying here any longer. - Good. Still, it's not easy. And not just as a father. - I know. - Do you? Does any Elder? Sometimes I wish you wouldn't have let us break the rules, you wouldn't have let us get married. No, you don't. Love and loss forms you, Leo. It's who you are and who you always will be. It's a life you'll treasure, and an experience you will share. One that helps us better appreciate those that we are entrusted to watch over. It's not fair. Sacrifice never is. It's time. - Looking good. - Whoa. - Wait, what are you still doing here? - Don't worry, you're fine. I just wanted to say... ...good luck. Thanks. Hey. Just out of curiosity, why did you tell me all that stuff about living life and enjoying my day if you were coming for me all along? Just in case I wasn't leaving with you. You've been given a second chance, Chris. Don't waste it. Hi. - Hi. - What's going on? Maybe you should sit down for a second. Oh, that doesn't sound good. No, no. No, it's good. It's good. I mean, it's... You know, it's not bad. It's a really good thing. It's not a bad thing. I think it's a really good thing, don't you think? Yeah. I mean, it depends, you know. - That sounds worse. - No, it's just complicated. Okay, so why don't you guys just tell me what's going on. All right. Paige and I... ...know what happened between you and Leo last night. Well... Excuse me? Not because anybody told us or anything. It's just... ...because of Chris. Chris? Why...? Why would Chris know what happened last night? Well, because he wouldn't be here if it didn't. Yeah, see, we've known for a while. We just didn't know how to talk to you and Leo about it. Talk to us about what? - Is this my turn? - Yeah. Yeah. Chris is your son. Wyatt's brother. Look, I know this is huge... No, it's... It's not huge, because it's not possible. It's crazy, because I'm not pregnant. - Yeah. - Yeah. No, I'm not. I mean, how could that happen? I mean... I know how that could happen, but it... What am I gonna do? Maybe you should talk to Leo about it. No, I can't. - Why? - Well, because... Because I can't. This a bad time? I'm still not quite sure what this was all about. Why so many of my kind had to die. - Why my friend had to die. - All in good time. We still didn't even accomplish what you wanted. We didn't get the Elder. But in a way, you did. Leo's gone, isn't he? Perhaps not in the way I had originally intended, but gone nonetheless. Well, wasn't he your friend too? Yes, he was. We all have to make sacrifices for the greater good. I'm evil. What do I care about the greater good? Leo's son is just as much a threat to your kind as he is to mine. We made a mistake in allowing Wyatt to be born... ...in allowing such a concentration of power to be brought into this world in one being. But now that Leo is gone and the Charmed Ones are unaware,
