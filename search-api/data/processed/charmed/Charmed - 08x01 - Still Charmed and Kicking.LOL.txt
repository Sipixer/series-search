Something tells me we're not getting out of this one girls. And the motorworld closing in... This is it! The Charmed Ones faked their onwn deaths. - We can start it all over again. - So we can get the next generation ready to pick up what we left on. Cute. I can live with that. Now Charmed season 8 begins. Peter, thank you for coming by. I really appreciate this. We love you, Piper. Pretty good turn out, uh? Phoebe? No Dad, I'm Piper. That's Phoebe. I can't believe how many leprechauns are at my urn. Well they always said their att for you. It's kind a creepy. But I guess you can't be doing picky when you're dead. You guys are driving me crazy, you know that? Keep your voices a ton lower and look a little more bereaved. Agent Keyes is watching. Oh don't worry. He'll never figure this out. How could he? I still can't figure it out. Yeah at least we're alive, and more importantly, free. Yeah, but do you have to keep changing your looks all the time? I mean just pick one and stick with it, would you? Why? It's fun. Poor Paige. Not a lot of people at her urn. I know. God thank, she's not here to see that. Excuse me. Excuse me. Wow! What's Janice Dickinson doing here? Oh Paige! She knew Paige? Waouh, I'm impressed. You were the best friend I ever had. What am I going to do without you? - Can we talk to you a minute? - In private. Excuse me, what are you doing? What's the meaning of this? Do you have any idea who I am? Yeah. As a matter of fact, we do. Paige. I'm sorry, who? Nice try, the jig's up. Oh alright, that's fine. Well somebody had to cry at my funerals, didn't they? We were supposed to keep a low profile. What were you thinking? I was thinking that I obviously spent too much time in the magical world because nobody even cares that I'm dead. That's not true. You have mourners. I mean there are a lots of leprechauns out there. I mean real people. - Well, there is your friend Glen. - Yeah, Glen was at your urn. And Ruthy, our neighbour. - No, she was just going to get coffee. - Oh really? My point exactly! Oh  my God! We can explain. It's.... Don't bother. You scared me. I thought we were busted. What are you gonna be if you don't change back? What are you doing? Apparently having an identity crisis. Oh! So it's ok for you to change your husband into... Ouch. What's wrong? It's the jingling in my head. Does that mean the Elders know she's alive? No, they can't. We clocked ourselves from them. It could be a new charge. You know, connections with their whitelighters are automatic. Ok. Well, just ignore it. Easy for you yo say. You are not half whitelighter, ok? Maybe it's one of the mourners. It could be a demon out there. No, no, no, no, no, no demons. Why? It makes sense, doesn't it? I mean they've probably found out we're not really dead. It doesn't matter. We retired. We don't do demons anymore. She's right. You just gonna have to forget about it. Not so easy with the jingle jingle. - What does he doing here? - He who? I did not even think he knew I existed. Who is he? I don't know his name. He's some guy that I used to see in the elevator all the time at work. He's kind a cute. Yeah. Ok people. Move now. I'll go later. Come on, we can't risk being caught. Chabiti Chap chap chap. Of course, I don't know if Phoebe ever thought me as a friend, but I always thought of her as mine. Oh I know for a fact she's really glad you're here, Elise. When I say I know, I mean it in a serious sense of course. Sensing. Of course. I'll never realised she knew so many little people though. Yes. - You must be devastated Mister Bennett. - Yeah. Especially considering how it happened. Was there ever an official cause of death? Excuse me? Oh forgive me for prying. It's just that the news always made it sound... so mysterious. And with no remains. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Oz. Paul Oz. And you knew my daughters how? By reputation. I mean, did the police ever find your son in law by any chance, Leo? No, they think he died in the accident as well. And now you have to raise those boys all by yourself, in this huge house. If you find that you need to sell it though, let me know. I'll be glad to help. You're a real estate agent? Specialised in the moving out problem properties, you know, people died, buying seems a little bit easy. Get out. Again, my condoleances. Well, are they dead or not? They're dead. So we can do it now. Nobody can stop us. Except for the demons, which is why we need to establish a fought hole in the motorworld as soon as possible. First we must wait the mour... We do as I say. Who says you decide? There is no order in the underworld anymore. Now that Zankou and his generation have been decimated, it's our time to play. Which means it's every demon for himself. Until one demon rises to power. And then you'll be forced to answer to him. Is that what you want? What I want is to scare the living out alive people. Literally. - Each to his own gives. - Fine then. Go. Me, I want out of this hole, take over the symbolixy the power before anybody else does. The Charmed Ones' home. How do you plan to get it? I'm going to buy it from their father's estate, after I kill him. This case isn't dead. I mean, you said so yourself, right? So? So don't we get back to this place, why aren't we just staying here? I don't understand. You've spent years trying to prove there's something else out there, right? Some unseen power. But then you walk away from it just like that? Just like that. And what about what happened to inspector Sheridan? That thing that killed her? Or what about that cop? He swears he saw LÃ©o at the scene of the crime. And that means if he's still alive... It's over agent Murphy. The sisters are dead. You don't believe that. You're right, I don't. But I want them to think I do. If they're hidding, they're not going to the surface without looking around. So, we leave. But I'm good comfortable. Completly. But then how you'll know... Because you're going to stay behind. That's how. Keep an eye on things for me. You let go. Be patient. And give them plenty of space. If they are still alive, they'll come home, sooner or later. Everyone always does. How well did you know Phoebe? Not as well as I liked to. But I loved to read her column . Really? Yeah, every day. I'll never got how somebody as beautiful as she was could be so incredibly insightful. You don't say. - Excuse me, do you mind? - It's alright, I've got this. You were saying, about Phoebe? Just said I thought she was great. Really great. Then, why didn't you ever ask her out? What? Thanks for coming. Sorry you have to go. Ok. Bye bye. Piper, what are you doing? What are you doing! You can't pick up on a guy at a funeral. Why not? It's my funeral. It's ok sweetie, mummy is right here. Wyatt, honey, what's the matter? It is known as you Piper. It's ok buddy, alright, Dad is here,  ok? We're all here. Mummy. Aunt Phoebe. Ok, see? Poor little guy. He's confused. He doesn't know what's going on, neither does baby Chris. All this change make him nervous. Yeah, maybe we didn't exactly think the thing through. We didn't had time to think it through. And it's too late to go back now. So what do we do? I think I have an idea. Follow me. It's a good thing we kept this. Yeah, but we're not supposed to use it. The more magic we use, - the more likely the demons are to find us out. We didn't say we'll never use magic again. Besides, I think we really need this spell. What do you wanna do? End up confusion, hopefully. I've been thinking about it for the last couple of days, and all we need to do, is each of us to come up with one look, one disguise, that we wanna project to the rest of the world. You mean like a permanent, permanent one? That's the idea. How is it gonna end up confusion, especially for the boys? Oh because they won't see the disguises, neither would any of us. Ok. Just trust me. You guys have a look in mind? Ok. You know what? Nothing flash either. Ok, ready? I call upon the ancient powers, to mask us now and in future hours, hide us well apparently but not from those we call family. Well, anything happened? Do we look the same? Yeah. Maybe it didn't work. It definitively worked. Oh my Godness, is that me? Is it the you you had in vision? Hey, I thought you said no flash! It was the first look that came to mind! I like it. How is it you can see your other selves reflected in the mirror? It's part of the spell. You know, this just might work. The jingle again. Do you think it means something bad is gonna happen? Ok. - Hey, I'm not done! It doesn't matter. You are now. It's an identity, not a novel. As long as it reflects who you're trying to be and where we've come from, we're all good. Ok. Julie, nice. Jo, Jenny, Louis? Louis, you know, like Louis Amstrong? You know, the great sax male? The trumpeter? Yeah I think Dad used to listen to him. Ok. You can deal with it, so can the government. VoilÃ . New identities. Are you sure? Only one way to find out. - Let's go shopping. - No. - Yep. - No, wait, no. Come on! We have seven years of lost time to make up for! We just have to start somewhere. - Yeah I know, but... - No buts! We are free. Do you have any idea what that means? No more demons, no more cops. We can do whatever we want. I know, I know, but still... Would you please talk some senses to this woman? You know what occured to me? That real estate agent that Daryl was talking about, if you think about it, - he may be a ... - Oh my God! If you say the d word, I might implode. Come on you guys! What's wrong? Isn't it what we wanted? Yeah, it's just it's not as simple as I had hoped. That's all. You know why? Because you haven't been out yet. And you will feel so much better in a new pair of shoes. - I don't need new shoes. - That's the old you talking! Come on you guys! Can't we at least try to have fun? Don't we owe ourselves that much? - Yes, we do ... - That's the spirit! Paige? I mean Jo, shoes on with me? I may just stay here and relax a little. Relax, I like it. Relax. Come on. He was not kidding on me. He was to! He was pratically drawling on you. First, I'm married. Secondly he's a salesman in a woman shoe store. What are the chances he's not gay? Who cares? Just enjoy. That's our new mentor, right? Still, maybe Paige is right. I don't think this new look is me. I think you look hot. Easy sis, don't creep me out. Hey we're not sisters anymore, remember? We're cousins. Still creepy. Isn't there any part of you that doubts your decision at all? No. I mean, I like new pair of shoes, so I bought new pair of shoes. Not the shoes! Pretending to be dead to the rest of the world. Oh yeah. I mean obviously there are certain aspects of my life that I really liked. But I couldn't fully enjoy it because of all the witch stuff. Yeah but the witch stuff is who we are. I mean we can't just walk around pretending we don't have powers anymore. Yeah but Piper, nobody's saying that we have to. We just don't have to use our powers every other week to save the world. That's the only difference. That and the fact that the last three decades of our lives are simply gone. We have to give up something to gain something. Look, you wanted a normal life more than all of us. Right? So what changed all of a sudden? I'm a little neurotic. What do you want from me?! That's not it. What else is it? It's just, it's a big change. And I don't do change very well. So you know, just let me freak out for a little while and then, you know, I'm sure I'll be fine. Ok, you wanna go get a high embrace block? J, I'd love to but no, I have to go check on P3 and make sure Dad hasn't done a lot of damage besisdes it's gonna be the only thing that will pay for all these shoes. You worry too much, Missy. Phoebe has a life outside the magic. Or at least she had one. Piper has LÃ©o. Piper has the boys. What do I have? I have a giant sucking hole of nothingness. Oh please Paige, spare me the dramatics and cut to the chase, would you? I've got an after life to live, you know? See, even you have a life, and you're dead. I just don't know where to start. You know it's not like anydody asked for my opinion before abandonning the Charmed legacy in the first place. Thanks Grams. I'm so glad you came. You've been a great help. Look honey, I'm sorry. But you are the one who caught yourself in that mess, not me. I didn't have the choice. Ok. We didn't have the choice. We were going to die, the real way. I understand, and I'm not judging you. Well, maybe I'm a little. But my point is that you've made a choice, whether you were forced into or not, and you've gotta live with that choice, whether you like it or not. What if I can't? Oh that's ridiculous! No, it's not. I want a life outside the magic, I really do. But... But what? But it's the jingling, ok? I hear it night and day which means people are constantly calling for my help. That is just the whitelighter in you. But that's still me Grams, and that's still magic. So what if I can't ever really get away from it? One thing is for sure, young lady. You'll never gonna find what you're looking for sitting around here. You want a fresh start? Then pull yourself up by your bootstraps, get out into the world, and try it on for size. See what happens. I don't know. Hey, you don't want my advice? Don't conjure me next time. Now, get up, get a grip and don't come back until you find your thrill. Now, go. Great, just great. - Oups, sorry. - Why? It's my fault. No, alright, it's mine. I didn't see you. Well, I saw you. That's for sure. I mean, how could a beautiful girl sitting around here by herself? I'm sorry? Nothing. Do you mind if I join you? Oh actually I was... Yeah sure,why not? Good. You're new around here, aren't you? No, I'm not. Why do you ask? I know this place at all. Pretty much everybody is regular. And you know I'm not. I definitively would remember seeing you before. Help! He took her purse! What are you doing? Where do you go? Are you out of your mind? You're gotta get yourself killed! Damnit! Why didn't I orb! Would you stop it already? I give up. Did you call for me? I don't think so. You don't have the power to stop me whitelighter. You obviously don't know who I am. Which is probably a good thing. Shh! Doesn't that burn your hand? Damn! Iwa hoping for such a better fight with my first demon. You are a demon, aren't you? Shhh!! Now help me out here, I'm new at this. Who pays for that? Hey buddy. It's still kinda loaded out there. You're kidding me. Well I'll get the girls to do the whole hocus pocus, uh? No, no more magic, unless it's absolutely necessary. They've gotta get out of the habit from lying on it. Or they'll never gonna have normal lives. Yeah, right like it's ever gonna happen. Why you don't think it will? Well, do you, Louis? Come on, who are you trying to kid here? Whether you like it or not, and you know I don't, being magical is part of who they are, is part of who you are. You're maybe able to change your identities, but it didn't changed that. We just do the best we can. Yeah, but what if that's not good enough? Leo, I don't mean to sound pessimistic 'cause I really want this to work out. But it's not gonna be easy, especially for you and Piper. Why especially for us? 'Cause you've got the boys to raise like that, and... - Where is the baby model? - I just checked on Chris, he's sleeping. Go on. Well, don't listen to me. Worried is Granpy. You think I know better by now. I've been worried since I first found out the kids are gonna be witches. You know, maybe you should go home for a while, Victor. You know, get away from all of this. You've been around here for about a week or so now. Yeah I will. Just as soon as things are ok down here. Listen why won't you wash? I would get the rest, Leo. I mean you no harm, Victor. My name is Jonas. I'm an Elder. I just need to talk to you, alright? Alright. Good. Now I know what you're going through, what you still must be going through. Children should bury their fathers, not the other way around. Go on. - We've been talking. - We? The other Elders and myself, about the boys, Wyatt and Chris. Losing their parents, their aunts, it's unspeakable. Especially considering who they were. Which is why we feel very strongly that it would be in the boys' best interet... You're not taking them. Forget it. Victor, you're mourning. You can't possibly raise them to become... I'm their grandfather. That's all I need to be. I don't think you quite realize the extend to which our future, all our future, depends upon their upbringing. I've got a pretty good idea. Then you know they'll continue to be targets of evil. Demons won't stop, but nothing to turn them to the aside or worse, destroy them. And how would you protect them? I'll find a way. They should come with me now, for their sakes. Over my dead body. I pray you know what you're doing. Are you still sure you don't wanna go home? Yeah, I'm thinking about it. Where have you been? Oh, you know, just kind of a walk. Oh, you're bleeding. How did that happen? Yeah, how did that happen? How is that the great Elkin got his ass kicked by what? Louzy witch. I didn't get my ass kicked. I could have easily killed her if I wasn't worried about exposure. She wasn't? Which is why I'm not even sure she was a witch. What could she have been? An usher? Whoever she was, she tracked me there somehow. Which means we'll cross pass again. And next time, I'll be waiting. I don't like it. Not with the whitelighter there too. There's more to this. I can handle them both. It's not like we had to worry about the Charmed Ones coming to the rescue anymore. Still, we should consolidate our powers regardless of the three. We'll kill the father in nightfall, while the powerful progenie sleeps. One week, one louzy week. Are you kidding me? Bary Manalow? Dad, you booked Bary Manalow! What were you thinking! Hello. Dominic, thank God you're here. Are these all the receipts for the last seven nights? Has everything been entered? I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Julie. I mean Jenny Bennett. I'm Victor's cousin. Niece, I'm Victor's niece. Ok. So what do you do with that computer? And how did you get the password? Uncle Victor gave it to me. Excuse me. New shoes. They look a lot nicer than they feel. So you work here now? No, I'm just helping out a little you know, 'cause Victor asked me to help out. Wouldn't you mind if I call him to verify that, would you? No, not at all. Please, knocked your socks off. Hello? What? Wait, wait, what? Leo, we're not supposed to have familial emergencies anymore. We're done with that. Alright, fine, I'm coming. But you need to calm down here and find a way to save our financial butts. I still can't believe she's really gone. She was always so sweet to me. She always had a smile for everyone. She was always there where you needed her. She helped me through my divorce. She doubled our readership. here we go. Thanks. Who are you? I'm Julie Bennett, Phoebe's cousin, from her father side. Oh my dear I am so sorry for you loss. I know you are. I just came by to pick up some of her things, so don't mind me. Were you close to Phoebe? Yes, I was. She was amazing, wasn't she? Adorable. The best friend I could ever ask for. That is so sweet. Oh I mean it. She was the best. I'm gonna miss her like crazy. See now you're gonna go et make me cry. It's the truth. She was more than just the heart and soul of this paper. She was the daughter I've never had. Oh Elise! I had no idea! I mean, Phoebe had no idea. I mean she never told me how close you both were. But then again, why would she have told me? Because then obviously she didn't know this was gonna happen. Carry on. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Ho, hi. Hi. Oh that's right, you don't know who I am. I'm Julie, Phoebe's cousin. I'd swear I saw you at the wake. Oh yeah, so sorry. Thanks. And you're? Dex. Dex Lawson. - Dex Lawson. nice to meet you Dex. - You too. Everything alright? Yeah, it's...just... hotter here. Ding! Nice meeting you. Are you out of your mind? Leo told us that you fought a demon? I can explain. What is this? What are you doing? I am trying to find a girl. Ok. Look. We have been through this. Ok. If anyone finds out we're alive, we're screwed. Do you have a death wish? Is that the problem? Ok. Would you two please be quiet for a minute and let me explain. Thank you. Firstable, I didn't intentionally engaged a demon. Oh, don't say engaged. Don't ask. Look, I just had the ring ring in my head and and I just figured to find answers that maybe, you know... You're not supposed to respond to anything, anymore. Look it's very hard not to respond to a call for help. Paige, you have to. Ok, we've had this conversation. Yeah, I know we have, but that's not that easy. Ok, everybody just calm down a second. Did you at least vanquished the demon? No. But on the right side, he did not knew who I was. That's good at least. So what happened to the demon? I don't know. This chick came along and just scared him off. What chick? We wait for him to come back downstairs. Alone. I don't know who she was. She just showed up right after I got there. Do you think she was a whitch? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe she was the one that called you. No. This girl definitively did not need my help. Could it be a bad witch? And if that's true and she figures out who we are? I'm telling you, she was after the demon, she was not interested in me. Still she could have ided you and that would have been very bad. Oh for quiet now loud. Give her a break, will you? Grams? What are you doing here? Well I'm trying to keep you from ganging up on her, that's what. Well you're sort of dead so that doesn't really concern you. It does when my legacy is at stake. Oh please, I think we paid our dues. And I'm not saying that you haven't. You have every right to want to live normal and common lives. But just because you want to, it doesn't mean you can. You're a little late with that speech. Perhaps for the two of you. But not for Paige. Whether or not you succeed, remain to be sane. But you cannot deny she is being called by somebody. And you can't deny it either. You're right, I can't deny it. Especially not right now. Hello Victor. Now, are you sure you don't wanna sell? Who are you? That doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't. Thank you for coming. Ah! the girl days! ??? Wyatt. - What? - Who? Where did he come from? Behind you! Thanks. Show off. She can't be all bad. She said thank you. I don't know what she is. She didn't stick around long enough for us to ask. You've got to admit, that was a nice flip though. And a nice attitude. She didn't even care that we saw her using her powers. Why was that? I think it's because she was tracking the first demon. I mean he was the same one she was after before. I also think she may be your new charge. Uh? It's the second time she showed up right after you got a call. Which means she probably knows who we are and she could expose us. She was after the demon, not us. And the demons were going after Dad, and he should be our main concern right now, not this super girl. The question is: why were they after him in the first place? Who knows? Maybe to get to the boys, or the house is some kind of trophee. The point is, we're gonna have to go after the demon. Even if it risks exposing us. We may have already been exposed. No, I don't think so. We were disguised to him besides we didn't use our powers. The problem is we can't just vanquish the one demon. We're gonna have to make some sort of statement, otherwise we'll have to keep the entire underworld from coming after Dad again and again. Well here is our common goal people. How could me make a statement without letting them know it's us. I knew you'd come home sooner or later. You again? Yeah. Me again. And this time, I know you're alone. Just out of curiosity Victor, who are those women at the house? If you tell me, I promise to make your death relatively painless. J thanks! Believe me, considering all the pain your daughters have caused over the years, that would be a gift. The women, who are they? I don't know who the other girl was, but the others are cousins, moving in. No, they're not. I am. You've got to be kidding me, right? You think that he can stop us all? Try him. Spread the word: leave us alone, or he'll kill you all. Where are the others? Vainquished. It was a set up. It was planned. And not by the boy. He's not old enough. It could be that the Charmed Ones are still alive? Well, how did it go? What do you think? I think it worked. I don't think he would have left unless he got the message. Question is, will he deliver and will stick. I think so. The whole underworld is afraid of Wyatt. Apparently, my little guy's reputation precedes itself. So that's it? We can get back to our lives now? Whatever those are. Well one of them has wedding bells in them. Later. Ok, well, just as long as we're demon free, that's all that matters. Oh, lucky, lucky, who's finally come around? I told you I just needed a little time and you know, a very big reminder of what our lives used to constantly be like. Right. We still have the little witch to contend with. Oh no! We don't. We don't. You do. She's your charge. No! Yeah. Maybe you won't hear from her again. Has a feeling she would be sticking around for a while.
