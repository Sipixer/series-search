Ask if it hurt when she fell. - Excuse me? - When you fell from heaven. Did it hurt? Because I know an angel when I see one. I'm no angel. I'm a witch. But don't tell my sisters I told you. Oh, I'm so glad you guys are still here. What are you staring at? They have been going at it for almost an hour. Hello. I can't even look. I know. I hate being single. Waitress coming through. Special delivery. - Hey, Skye. - Hey, Skye. Hi. I think there's been some mistake. I didn't order this. I know. You have a secret admirer. He ordered it for you. - Who is that? - I have no idea. I'm just following the bartender's orders. And apparently, he's been eyeing Prue all night. Skye, can you do me a favour? Tell him thank you and I'm flattered, but I'm kind of seeing someone else. - Sure. - Thanks. This is a nice change of attitude. I'll say. Does this mean you're thinking of getting serious with Andy? Lately, I've been thinking about a lot of things. - She didn't want the drink? - I'm sorry, no. She's flattered, she's just seeing someone else. Yeah, sure she is. How about you? Maybe you'd like to have a drink with me sometime? Oh, well, that's really sweet of you, but I'm not allowed to date the customers. - Skye. - An order's up, so I've gotta run. Hello, Skye. What the...? You're in my world now, Skye. You look beautiful in that dress. I knew you would. I don't understand. It's your dream, but it's my fantasy. Where am I? You're dreaming. I'm visiting. - You're in my dream? - Yes. But I can make it mine. You can walk. In dreams, I can do anything. I can dance in your dreams. I can alter your dreams. Hey. And I can kill you in your dreams. No, please. Did you know that if you die in your dreams, you die in real life? - Please don't hurt me! - Please don't hurt me! No, Skye, you rejected me. And now you gotta pay. - Please, I'll do anything! - Please, I'll do anything! Sweet dreams. What have we got here? Her name is Skye Russell, early 20s. She's a waitress at Quake. Every bone in her body's been crushed. Coroner said it's as if she had fallen off a 20-story building. But we're inside an apartment... ...on the ground floor... ...and her body hasn't been moved. Keep going. And press and press and press.</i> Keep working it through. And press.</i> I give up. Two weeks, and nothing's strengthened but my temper. Piper, here's the problem. You didn't read the fine print. See, it says right here, $19.95 for the video and 20 grand for the plastic surgeon. Yeah, well, it's worked. She's the most desired female in America, what every man wants. Of course men want her. Men are no different from women. We all want what we can't have. Which is why we need to stop thinking about what men want and start thinking about what we want in a man. Tons of fun, lots of heat and no strings attached. That's what I want. I know this may not sound very PC, but I want romance. Long, slow kisses, late-night talks, candlelight. I love love. I'd take what Prue has in a flat second. Then you'd have to deal with the family secret, which isn't exactly normal, is it? Did you see the coroner's report? Skye Russell died of massive internal haemorrhaging. Her body literally imploded upon itself. Ever seen anything like it before? On jumpers, but the bodies were usually found on sidewalks. There aren't signs of external damage consistent with any type of fall. - In fact, there's not a scratch on her. - Yeah, well, maybe we were wrong. - Maybe her body was moved. - From where? How? The front door was locked and bolted, each window had bars on it, none of which had been tampered with in any way. Nobody but she was in that apartment last night. It's not a suicide, Morris. And it's sure not death by natural causes, which leaves only one thing. - Murder. - I hate it when we say that. Here you go, Mr Manford. Chicken with rice and vegetables, just the way you like it. Chicken well-done, light oil on the vegetables, and rice steamed dry. Thanks. Bon app√©tit. Hey, why are you doing that? Skye didn't show up for her shift today, so we're short-handed. So, what's up? I found this spell: How to attract a lover. No, Phoebe, forget it. We're not casting any spells. Come on. There must be more to our powers than warlock wasting. I'm ready to have some fun with our magic. No. No personal gain, remember? How is it personal gain if we're using our powers to bring happiness to another person? And in my case, lots and lots of happiness. - Could you pass me that colander? - Yeah. Look, I'm not talking about marriage here. We have our 30s to freak out about that. This... This spell is about having a good time. I admit, it's tempting. The dating scene can be a little frustrating. But bringing a man into our life through a spell? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a little bit desperate? No, how is asking for what you want being desperate? I say it's not. I say it's empowering. Besides, the Book of Shadows says we could reverse the spell at any time.</i> Piper! Phoebe! Prue, you're home. I thought you had a date with Andy. No, he had to cancel. What are you doing? Piper, I was wrong. The spell calls for cayenne pepper, not black pepper. Did I say spell? I meant recipe. We are so busted, aren't we? I would say yes. What spell are you casting? I realised today that Phoebe may have stumbled onto something. Something that actually makes sense. Now I'm worried. All the spells are in this book for a reason, right? I think this spell could be a harmless opportunity for us to test our powers. You know, really get a handle on them. I mean, why else would it say we can reverse it at any time? All I want is someone special in my life. And this spell provides that exactly. I can translate. - You've got to be kidding. - We were hoping you would join us. No, I've got enough complications in my life. You two are on your own. You know where to find us. Be careful what you wish for. - Okay, you wanna go first? - No. You go first. Okay. Hey, that's not fair. You want a man who is single, smart, endowed. - Employed. - Oh, sorry, "employed." "A man who loves sleeping in on Sundays, sunset bike rides, cuddling by a roaring fire and late-night talks. A man who loves love as much as you do." - Wow, you're a romantic. - Yep. Your turn. You want the sexy silent type that finds you driving through town on the back of a Harley at 3:00 in the morning. "A man who appreciates scented candles, body oils and Italian sheets." "He's about hunger and lust and danger. And even though you know all this, even though you know he'll never meet your friends or share a holiday meal with your family, you still can't stay away." - And he recycles. - He recycles? Yeah. And I think it goes without saying that we both want a man who is well... employed. You're seriously twisted. - This is the spell we have to say? - Yeah. We're lucky. If we were men looking for women, the spell requires putting a piece of honey cake in a sweaty armpit for days. - Okay. I think we can say this. - Okay. - I conjure thee. I conjure thee. - I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i> - I'm the queen, you're the bee. - I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i> - As I desire, so shall it be. - As I desire, so shall it be.</i> - I conjure thee. I conjure thee. - I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i> - I'm the queen, you're the bee. - I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i> - As I desire, so shall it be. - As I desire, so shall it be.</i> - Do you think it worked? - I don't know. The big spells usually require all three of us. Is it for me? Is it for me? Who's this? I'm sorry, do I know you? Yeah, we met at Quake. Well, we didn't actually meet. I sent you a glass of chardonnay, and you sent it back. Still, you know, I was wondering, maybe you'd like to go out sometime? Look, as I told the waitress, I'm just not available. How did you get my number, my name?</i> Hello? Who is it? That guy from Quake who sent me a drink. - What did he want? - He asked me out. Hello. Missy May, where are you going? I'm going to Quake to see if my spell worked. Wanna join me? - Pass. - No, thanks. I'm gonna take a bath. Hello, Prue. - Who...? - Who am I and how did I get in? - I don't care, just get... - Out of the bathroom? - Piper, help! - Piper, help! Scream all you want. No one can help you. - How did you...? - Know what you're thinking? - Know what you're going to say? - Yes. I am in your unconscious. I know your every thought and desire. Who are you? I'm the man of your dreams. You are not real. You don't exist. That's what your mother used to say, isn't it? Every night before you went to sleep? - You are not real. You don't exist. - As she tucked you in, - she'd say... - You are not real. You don't exist. ...if you saw any monsters... - You are not real. You don't exist. ...to tell yourself they weren't real. - You are not real. You don't exist. - They... ...didn't exist. I can't move. Why can't I move? Because I'm going to love you to death. Prue? Are you okay? - Yeah. - You were yelling. Yeah, I had a... - I had a really bad thing. - A thing? Yeah. I'm okay now. I promise. Just go back to bed. Oh, my God. Do you remember what Mom used to say about nightmares? She said if we saw any monsters to tell them to go away, that they didn't exist. Always worked too. Yeah, well, not this time. He knew about Mom. He knew what she told us, and how did he know that? And what about the marks on my back? Piper, they were there and now they've disappeared. I don't know how and I don't know why, but they were definitely there. How many hours did you work this week? Sixty, 70? And what are you doing today, on a Saturday no less? The auction starts on Monday, and the shipment arrived three days late. And you're changing the subject. You don't believe me. No, I believe you think you saw marks on your back. But I'm watching you down your third cup of coffee, and we're talking about a nightmare you had while asleep in the tub. So isn't it possible that exhaustion made you see those marks and not some dream guy? No. He was in my dream. It was real. So why didn't you use your power to help you out? - You know, move him away. - I don't know. Morning. What...? Excuse me, but who are you? - Who cares? - Hans, I found your T-shirt. Was it in the hammock or...? - It doesn't matter. - Thanks. Sure. Hammock? - Well, I gotta run. - Okay. I'll meet you later for lunch. - Okay. - I almost forgot. Don't worry. We had safe sex. A lot of safe sex. - It's all here in their FBI files. - Why do you do this to me? Three young women, completely unrelated except for the fact they died the exact same way as the waitress. Medical examiner listed them all as jumpers. Case closed. Look at the crime photos. All the vics were found locked in their rooms. We got the M.O. Of a serial killer here, Morris. I'm telling you, Piper, the spell worked. A little louder, Pheebs, I don't think Oakland heard. Well, it did. Get this. Hans doesn't go to bars. He's never been to Quake. But last night, he's on his way back from his acting class when, bam! Flat tire on his motorcycle, right across the street from Quake. So he comes in to use the payphone, and who should he bump into but me, exiting the ladies' room. Phoebe, you threw his clothes all over the house. That's not a spell working, that's hormones. No, it's not like that. I really like Hans. He's really cool. And he likes me too. Mr Manford, here you go. Chicken, rice, veggies, just the way you like it. Thank you, and please call me Jack. Has anybody ever told you how truly beautiful you are? Have you been drinking? A sense of humour. I love that. Wait, Piper, don't go. I don't know why, but I've gotta get to know you. Have dinner with me. Can you hang on a second? Prue Halliwell, please. It's her sister Piper. You know you shouldn't have dinner with that guy. Why not? Because you should fly to Paris with me. Tell her it's an emergency. So you're not actually thinking of going out with this Jack guy, are you? Have you finished the Cromwell miniatures yet? Rex. Hang on a second. No, I'm still cataloguing the Rembrandt sketches. Oh, well, set them aside. The letters of Ernest Hemingway are now first on the block. Thanks, boys. I don't believe it, I'm gonna be here all night. Piper, let me call you back. Jack stayed through the entire lunch shift, talked my ear off, had me laughing at all his stories and somehow convinced me to have coffee with him. Hans and I are going dancing at Rave. You and Jack should come join us. Well, if our dinner date lasts as long as our coffee break, we wouldn't make it there till closing. Maybe we could all meet back at the house later. This has worked out so great, hasn't it? Yeah. Great. So this is a dream lab? They actually pay people to sleep? If you wait here, I'll tell Mr Berman you'd like to speak with him. Thank you. Look, just because Berman dated the first victim... - Julie Derikson? ...doesn't make him a killer. Yeah, but it's a great place to start. Hell, it's our only place to start. What do you know about this place anyway? It's a privately funded research facility. And Julie Derikson worked here too. She and Berman were teamed together on some experimental project. Hello, inspectors. How may I help you? You Whitaker Berman? Yes. What's this about? We're conducting an investigation. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Oh. Regarding? You know this woman? That's Julie Derikson. She was my girlfriend. I was heartbroken when she... Forgive me, it's just very hard. I... I still miss her. Another woman died just like her the other night. A waitress, crushed to death in her sleep. Oh, you're kidding. No. That's... That's awful. Could you tell us your whereabouts the night before last? I was here in the lab, asleep. I left in the morning. Any witnesses who can confirm that? A night's worth of data, two scientists and a lab technician. Shall I have them paged? No, that's okay, Mr Berman. We're sorry we disturbed you. Thank you for your time. What else can I tell you? When I get stressed, I get hives in very strange places. Which is nothing compared to what happens when I panic, believe me. Your honesty is so refreshing. Well, it helps keep my ulcer under control. It's the '90s. Is there anyone who doesn't have one? - Would you like to see my tattoo? - Would you like to see mine? Is there nothing I can say to turn you off? There really isn't. Which is kind of strange, actually. Not really. Jack, you're under a... Spell. Hey there. Give me 30 cc's of Androvin. Thirty cc's? That's twice... I'll be in REM sleep quicker and longer. Set the dream-inducement system to level 12. You haven't got the results back from level eight. This is my grant, my experiment. Set the machine and give me the shot. Hello, Prue. We meet again. All that work, all those hours, you fell asleep at your desk. - Someone help! - What do you hide from at work? Is it the pain of your past or the uncertainty of your future? I don't hide from anything. You can't move out of the chair, can you? Don't you wonder why? Because I don't want you to. You're powerless, Prue. - Go to hell. - I, on the other hand, am all-powerful. You don't wanna talk to me? That's fine. There's always Piper, Phoebe or any number of young, single women out there. It's an endless pool for the Dream Sorcerer. No, wait, I'll stay. It's too late. You're falling asleep. No, I'm fine. I'm awake. Shall I sing you a lullaby? I don't think so. - No! - Good night, Prue. - Hello. - Hi, you're still at the office. Yeah, can I call you back? Sure. I'm at the station house. - Everything okay? - It is now.</i> Thanks, Andy. Thanks for calling. I just wanted to hear your voice. Okay, bye. Prue? Bloody hell. The man is in a wheelchair. He's got no motive, and he's got an alibi. So tell me again why you think Berman is our suspect. - Dream leaping. - Dream leaping? That's what Berman's researching at the lab, dream leaping. The ability to project himself into someone else's dreams. Into women's dreams and killing them? Now who's dreaming? Not just any women. Women who reject him. Just like Julie Derikson did. She broke up with him while they were driving somewhere. They got into an accident. That's why he's paralysed. It's all there in the police report. The day after he went back to work at the lab, Julie Derikson died suspiciously. Six months later, two more women died in their sleep, crushed to death. Coincidence? You tell me. Love to. Can't. Let's go. I'm home. - You're home early. - Yeah, so are you. What's with all the flowers? You and Jack fighting already? I wish. The flowers were all waiting on the doorstep when I returned. They're from men I barely know and men I've never met. All the flowers in here are for you. Oh, well, - I know they're not from Hans. - What happened? He wouldn't leave me alone all night. He kept touching me. And practically every guy in the bar was hitting on me. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I ditched Hans and left him at the club. So how was your date? Perfect. Everything was perfect. Even my faults were perfect. And this is a bad thing? It wasn't real. Everything he said, everything he felt, it was because of the spell. Not because of me. Piper, you don't know that. Maybe he meant every word. Maybe if it wasn't for the spell, he would've never had the chance to feel those things, let alone say them. No, Phoebe, Iove is a magic between two people that cannot be explained and cannot be conjured. What we did, it's just... It's not right. Even our poor cat's in hell. Go away, horny tomcats. Let's reverse the spell. Hello? - Prue, where are you? - I'm still at the office. Look, I fell asleep and that man from my dream, he tried to kill me again. - What? - Yeah, I don't understand why. All I know is, I'm only safe if I stay awake. If I fall asleep, I'm dead. Stay where you are. We'll come pick you up. No, I don't wanna stay here another minute. Look in the Book of Shadows and see if you can find anything on this guy.</i> He calls himself a Dream Sorcerer, okay? - Nothing? - Nada. There's gotta be something. I'm telling you, there's no Dream Sorcerer stuff anywhere. That's impossible. The Book of Shadows has never let us down.</i> Maybe he's not a demon. Maybe he's a mortal. - Then he's got one hell of a power. - You're not kidding. Demon, mortal. There's gotta be some way to stop him. That's gotta be Prue. Wait. What are we gonna tell her? That we can't help her? That she can never go to sleep? Come on, answer the phone. - Hello? - Hey, did you find anything? No. But don't worry, you're not in this alone. Phoebe and I will help you. We don't even know what he is. The most important thing right now is for you to get home safely. Okay, look, just keep talking. Don't let me fall asleep. She sounds exhausted. Okay, blast the air conditioning, crank the stereo and roll down the windows. Don't crank the stereo. What's that song we'd sing when we were little? - The road-trip song? - Yeah. Did you hear that, Prue? - Yeah, okay. - Okay, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. Nothing is gonna happen. - Phoebe! - What the...? Hans? Let me in, I have to see you! Go away. - Are you crazy? What are you doing? - Piper? Phoebe?</i> You left me. How could you leave me? - Hans, please. - Ever since I met you, I can't do anything. Eat, drink, sleep! All I can do is think about you! Piper. Phoebe. The time is now, Prue. We're almost there. Piper, Phoebe, where are you? What have you done to me? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Prue. Prue. Prue! She's not there. Say good night, Prue. - The mobile unit you are... - She's not answering.</i> I can't fall asleep. Can't fall asleep. Watch the line. - What's open? - Trauma 1. - What do you got? - I got a 27-year-old female. One-on-one, car versus utility pole. BP, 80/40. Pulse, 110. Semiconscious at the scene. Pupils are responsive. Miss Halliwell, hang in there. Must stay awake. Must stay awake. Where's X-ray? I want a C-spine now. And have CT prep for us. - Do you want a CBC and an MLP? - Yes. Ready. One, two, three. - Resps down to 35. Pulse ox is falling. - That can't be. Give me 500 mics of dopamine and get ready to intubate. Stay with us, Miss Halliwell. Damn, she's unconscious. - How did I get here? I'm not... - Asleep? Actually, you're unconscious. You fell asleep at the wheel, hit a pole. Terrible, terrible thing. Speaking of pain, you really hurt me last night. And not just my feelings. Suffer. We're definitely out of range. Want a little wine with your death? Mr Berman insists that he's not to be disturbed during his experiment. I don't care. We wanna talk to him. Just wake him up. It's not gonna be easy. He's heavily sedated. Just get to work. - I hope you're right about this. - I know I am. The question now isn't if Berman's gonna kill again, but who? - Do you like the dress? - I've worn better. Yeah. Excuse me. You called us a little while ago. Our sister is here, Prue Halliwell. - Your sister's still in Trauma 1. - Is she okay? Go to the waiting room, a doctor will be right with you. Okay, thank you. Mr Berman! Mr Berman, wake up! I don't care what it takes. You wake him up. Now! Berman, wake up! Come on, Berman! Wake up, Berman! Andy. We're here, Prue, right beside you. Can you hear us? Prue? Piper? Phoebe? - Prue? - They can't help you.</i> You're mine now. I'm scared. I know. Me too. What do we do? We don't let her give up. Prue, listen to me. You have got to fight this guy. - Don't leave us. - You can do it. - We need you. - Use your power, Prue. Come back to us. - Use your power, Prue. - You can do it, Prue.</i> Where are you? You're powerless. - Prue, you can do it. - You're stronger.</i> Use your power against him. - Use your power, Prue. - Don't leave us.</i> Prue. - You can do it. - Use your power.</i> - Prue. - Shall I say good night?</i> No, let me. Good night. I don't believe it. - He's dead. - I'll never doubt you again. Prue? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. What about the...? He's gone. Knock, knock. - Tell me you're here to pick me up. - Hi. No, Dr Black said one more day just to be sure. Yeah, and you know, it wouldn't kill you to get some rest. Phoebe, it's okay. Thanks for the flowers. Yeah. What's going on? Long story, not very interesting. Does this have anything to do with your lust spell? - But don't worry. - We reversed the spell last night. - Piper called Jack. - The guy that you had dinner with? And he didn't remember anything. - And Phoebe called Hans. - And he didn't remember anything. So don't worry, everything is back to normal. - Good. - Afternoon, ladies. Surprise. Yes, it is. What are you looking at me for? I didn't tell him. Guilty. Come on, let's go. Okay. Bye. - We'll see you later tonight? - After we raid your closet. Brought your favourite. Oh, cheeseburgers and fries. Glad to see every bone in your body's not broken. - What?
