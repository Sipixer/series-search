Yeah, it sounds like he's having a great time. What's the matter, is something wrong? I got another letter from Dr Williamson. Williamson? Wasn't he the specialist that treated you for Oroya fever? That would be him. That was months ago. What does he want? He wants me to come in for blood work so he can make sure I'm cured. An angel brought you back to life. Trust me, you're cured. I know, but I can't exactly tell him that. - So just throw the letter away. - I have been. He keeps sending more. Here's my granola. What's it doing in the trash? I just bought this two days ago. - Who eats this besides me? - Leo. But I'll replace it, I promise. Piper, I don't want you to think I mind, because I don't. But if Leo's gonna be living here, then I... I think we should probably set some ground rules, you know? Leo doesn't live here. He eats breakfast here. - A lot. - Maybe he just likes cereal. You really think he's here that much? He's like the big brother I never wanted. I mean, had. Morning. Pheebs... ...Evan Stone, ever hear of him? - Hello. Red Death? I've only seen that movie, like, five times. Yes, I know. I'm doing a photo shoot with him today. How much do I hate you right now? Unless the tabloid rumours are true, in which case, I really hate you. He is supposed to be... I do not wanna know anything about him, I just wanna take his picture and leave. And I need to go get ready. Prue, you don't think Leo lives here, do you? I mean, yeah, of course he does, but, I mean, it's fine. It's... As long as you're happy, that's all I really care about. Not that I was unhappy when I saw Leo all naked in the shower and just all... wet. Okay, so you guys just need to make up some ground rules, you know, what's acceptable and not acceptable, and... I'm serious. Of course I got your memo. You can't be serious. Have you read my report? Ninety days ago, Piper Halliwell was admitted with Oroya fever. Within 24 hours, she was completely free of the virus, though she failed to respond to any of the treatments. Dr Williamson, I may be new to San Francisco Memorial, but I am very aware of your project. Then you're also aware of the fact that her recovery - makes no clinical sense. - True. But your subsequent tests failed to reveal anything out of the ordinary. Look, I just need more time. I've only injected the primates with samples of the Halliwells' blood this morning. Piper Halliwell is fine. I want you to forget about her and concentrate on people who are sick. I am. Somewhere in this blood could be the key to unlocking a universal antibody. And if I agreed with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - You will not terminate this project. - Dr Williamson, I believe I already have. I am not giving up. All right, Prue. Let's see how this affects you. I said, be quiet! - I have some time between appoint... - Wait. Dr Jeffries? So I thought we might discuss... How did you get over there? - What happened in here? - I had an accident. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - What happened to your neck? - Nothing. Listen, I need to get ahold of the Halliwells immediately. I told you that project's been terminated. Maybe you should take some time off. You've been under a lot of pressure. And I understand your sister's been sick. And I told you I need to get ahold of the Halliwells immediately. I want you cleared out of this lab by the end of the day. Get the PA to do it. - Can you give me a hand with this? - All right. Tell him to get back here, all right? I'm tired of waiting. - Evan Stone? - Yes? Hi, I think we have a date. I'm Prue Halliwell, 415 Magazine. Ring security. I think I found another tabloid photographer. Me? No, I am not with a tabloid. I'm with 415. - I have an appointment. - Sorry. We've had photographers sneaking in here all week. That's why I'm here. I'm Lucy, Evan's publicist. And this is a temporary ID. - This could be a problem. - Yeah, that's because I'm a new employee of the magazine. You can call Gil Corso, I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm it. I'll keep an eye on her while you do that. Okay? So, what happens if Mr Corso is in a meeting? What, you send me flying with a tenchi nage kick? I have an earth throw. You know aikido. Yeah, well, it comes in... ...handy with my line of work. The photography business must be rougher than I thought. Only when publicists don't trust temporary IDs. Lucy's a really cool person. Newly promoted, just struggling to control her new power, that's all. Yeah, I can certainly relate to that. Ever done it on a cloud? I don't know, does a feather bed count? - Phoebe. I thought you were Piper. - Well, it is her room. - I am so sorry. - No. No worries. I mean, it could happen to anyone, especially someone that doesn't have to knock to come in, you know? You're so right. But this will never happen again. - You have my word. - Okay. And you have my word that I won't tell Piper. Good idea. I'm just leaving now. - She's in the kitchen. - Thanks. Item number two: Orbing in unannounced. You're calling me at home? Yes, Ms Halliwell. I need you to meet me at my lab as soon as possible. - I'm not going anywhere. - Look, you don't understand. - This is very important. - Goodbye, doctor. Look, I need your... Piper? Leo, hi. - Everything okay? - I don't know. That was Dr Williamson. He's been sending me letters, trying to get me back to the hospital for follow-up tests. And I'm not going. What are you doing here? Don't tell me there's a demon running around. No. I just figured since it was your day off, maybe you could spend it with me. - Did you, now? - Yes, I did. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah. I mean, it's not like he's ever gonna figure out that you were the one who saved me, so I'm not gonna worry about it because there's nothing to worry about. - Ms Halliwell? - No, this is Nurse Jordan, your sister's nurse. I was wondering if you could... - Is she okay? - You need to get to your sister's room - as soon as possible. - I'll be right there. Can you just lift your chin a little bit? Because there's a shadow. Thanks. - What a cute monkey. - Monkey? Yeah, he's right behind you. What are you talking about? Okay, thanks. - You're leaving? - Yeah, I'm finished. - We just got started. - Right, and... ...I got a great shot, it was perfect. Ms Halliwell. Your car keys. You can shoot my picture anytime, Ms Halliwell. Thank you. Hey, you are never going to believe what happened today. Yes, I will. I saw Notting Hill. What are you talking about? They're from Evan. I hope you're happy. You're stealing away my dream man. "Prue, what really happened? Evan." - Something happened? - Yes, but not with Evan Stone. Is Piper here? Yeah, she's in the living room with Leo, again. Piper, Leo. So are you gonna tell me why he sent you flowers? You know, I just have no idea. And they say the youngest is the most naive. - Prue, you're back early. - Yes, I am. That's because a monkey astral-projected to me on the set today. A monkey? - Astral-projected? - Yeah, and it waved at me, okay? Like it knew me or something. I think it wanted my help. Honey, I think you're working way too hard. You know, Phoebe, I saw it. Okay, and it... And it had, like, an ID bracelet from a hospital on its arm. Prue, honey, I don't think monkeys can astral-project. - Can they? - Not without powers. And it would have to have your power too, you know, to find you, magic to magic. My power? How can it have my power? I have my powers. All right, wait. So you're saying that a monkey is sharing my powers? Is that even possible? After all you've seen and done over the last two years? You tell me what's impossible. You said something about a hospital wristband? Yeah, it had a rose on it. Did it look anything like this? Yeah, exactly like this. Wait, is this the same Dr Williamson? Yeah, he's been sending me requests for weeks, and he called this morning and said he wanted to see me. - What? - Wait, you didn't tell me he called you. Well, there was nothing to say. I hung up on him. Do you think he found out about our powers? B. O.S. B. O.S. Oh, Book of Shadows, Book of Shadows. - They say it's important. - Okay. - Come back soon. - Okay. My wife is dying. She's 33rd on the wait list, Curtis. She's not gonna live long enough to get a kidney. There's nothing I can do, Larry. I'm sorry. No, no. Let me tell you what's sorry, okay? Look, I come here every day, and for every minute that I'm with her, some scumbag criminal is freed, released on a technicality. Curtis, listen to me. She is your sister. Isn't there anything you can do? Larry, wait. Oh, my God. Get the crash team, get a gurney. This man's gonna have a heart attack. - I said, the crash team. - Yes, sir. If anyone looks like they're gonna collapse, it's you, not... Come on, let's go. Let's get in here. Get his leg. Got him? All right, give me two cc of adrenaline. - How did you know? - He's gone into full arrest. - Check his airway. Bag him. - Is an IV started? - What's his pulse? - 90/60, doctor. Let's start compressions. Listen, I'll save Edie too. I promise. - You gotta get it up. - Give me that lidocaine. I need a list of all the criminals who were admitted and released from the hospital jail ward. Now. Wow, what a mess. Well, too bad we can't ask them where Williamson is. - That's the same monkey. - It does look like it knows you. Okay, it looks like they know all of us. Come on. He named them after us. That's really scary. All right, we need to take a look around and make sure there's nothing else here that could expose us. Well, maybe that's why the monkey projected to you, Prue. Maybe she was trying to warn you. - All of these files say "Halliwell." - Yeah, well, look at all these tests that he took. Okay, and not just on blood that he took from you, but blood that he took from Phoebe and me. He has spent months trying to figure out how I survived the Oroya fever. Yeah, well, this grant request says that he's searching for the universal antibody. Maybe he thought it was in your blood. Piper, Phoebe. Okay, so I think it's safe to say that Dr Williamson probably knows about us. Do you think he's been injecting our blood into those monkeys? I don't know, but we need to get them out of here before somebody walks in, sees something flying, and everybody finds out about us. Okay, not only does Williamson know about our powers, but he's got one of them: Telekinesis. Wait a minute. You remember what he was like when I was sick. He had the CDC here, the media. If we don't stop him, the monkeys aren't gonna be the only ones in cages. Well, it seems as though you've stiffed me 30 hits. Oh, you know what? Let me tell you something. I don't touch this stuff, all right? I just sell it... You Benny Ritter? What are you doing? That's my door, man. - What the hell is this? - House call. Man, I gotta get up. No. No, no. - Okay, Piper, now. - Wait. A Showbiz Tonight exclusive. Who is this mystery woman in Evan Stone's life? Why did he send her flowers? Tune in tonight and find out. I thought you said nothing happened. Yeah, he was just returning my car keys. Hi. Hello, bigger problems. It was more than a miracle. It was as if he was clairvoyant. He said his brother-in-law was going to have a heart attack, and ten seconds later, he collapsed. And he could tell that just by looking at him? No, he touched him first. I'll take premonitions for 500, Alex. Excuse me. I'm a patient of Dr Williamson. - Do you know where I might find him? - The records room. Okay, thank you. So he's using our powers in public. - At least he's not hurting anyone. - Yet. Williamson's long gone. Wait, he came in here for a reason. It's a list of names and addresses of people who were admitted into the jail ward in the hospital. Benny Ritter is highlighted. Accessed by Dr C. Williamson. I've taken care of everything. You're going to be okay. A lot of people are gonna be okay. Get my sister prepped and ready for a kidney transplant. Tissue typing and cross matching are confirmed. Unrelated living donor, but an exact match. No questions. Do it. Now. Should I be afraid to ask what you're doing in this part of town? We're not sure. What happened? Some lowlife named Benny Ritter had a kidney removed. Not that he could tell us. He was found sedated. - Who is he? - Drug dealer. Busted last week, out on a technicality. Any idea who did it? Med tech said whoever gutted him stitched him up, left a note, something about internal sutures secure, morphine for pain. - He left a note? - Yeah, we'll definitely be looking - for somebody with medical training. - You can't. I had a feeling you were gonna say something like that. - Want to tell me why? - Only that it's supernatural. I can't really tell them that. It's the best we can do for now, Darryl. You're the one that said you didn't wanna know what we were into. But I suppose you want me to keep you posted? Yes, but more importantly, just be careful. So much for not hurting anybody. Yeah, well, we have to find him before the cops do. Piper. I keep thinking if I had just answered one of his letters... Mr Corso, you know that I am not Evan Stone's girlfriend. Are you laughing at me? Could somebody please help me? - Hi. - There is nothing in here about mortals or animals having powers, let alone how to get the powers out of them. We will find something, Piper. Okay, when? Because Dr Williamson has already stole someone's kidney, and what's gonna be next? I can explain everything, just not now. Okay, bye. - Except for the magic monkey part? - No, I thought I'd leave that part out. - What's that? - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's photographers. They're everywhere on the lawn. Okay, close the curtains. Okay. Hi. God. There are more coming. I'll be right there. More coming. - Do you think they saw anything? - Yeah, like stolen monkeys. Who knows, but at least they didn't see any magic. Never mind. Sorry. I'll ask later. Right now, I've got some bad news about Dr Williamson. That's the press. They're after Prue. - Thanks. - So, what's the bad news? Well, simply put... ...Dr Williamson is cosmically screwed. He's got your powers in his mortal body. And it took generations to prepare you for that. You can handle it, he can't. - So, what's going to happen to him? - He'll go mad. - Just from our powers? - Yes. Wait, are you saying that our powers are in our blood and he injected himself with it? That blood, yeah. You see, the spell that you cast to cure Piper changed everything. And now it's changing Dr Williamson. Your magic is meant for doing good, but in the wrong person, somebody not ready for it, - that need to do good things... - Could go bad? Real bad. Look, Piper, it's nobody's fault, all right? Dr Williamson chose his own path. This is not a consequence of anybody's actions except his own. Still, you have to find a way to stop him before things get worse. If they haven't already. Okay, I'm gonna make a potion to separate powers - from witches. - They're monkeys. With witches' blood. I don't know what else to do. And maybe if it works on them, it'll work on Williamson. All right, I gotta figure out a way to get rid of these reporters, otherwise we can't do anything and figure out a way to go talk to Evan. I'm gonna go call Morris. He needs to know what he's up against. If only to keep yourself from being exposed as witches. - Yeah, that too. - Piper, I'm gonna need your help. Thank you. You okay? Well, considering our powers have combined to drive a man crazy and have put who knows how many other people in danger... ...l'm terrific. And cut. Terrific, guys, print that. Hi. Okay, I might hurt you. Evan. My front yard is filled with photographers. Okay? They are watching my every move. Come on. It'll blow over. You're a normal, red-blooded American girl with nothing to hide, right? Right, but I can't really do my job with flashbulbs going off in my face every single second. You can't fight back. That's like struggling in quicksand. Don't play. Whatever energy they're throwing at you, just pass right on by. Because eventually that energy comes back around, leads them to someone else. Yeah. Okay, I really appreciate the whole "wax on, wax off" approach, but couldn't your people just issue some kind of a statement? What, are you kidding me? They're working the bad-boy image. Evan, please. You got a cell phone? Of course I do. - Who are you calling? - Celebrity Peep Shows. They all use tipsters to tell them what's going on, who's doing who. And I'm a tipster. Code name: Julius. Hello, this is Julius. Evan Stone and his new girlfriend are at the Bayview sound stage. They're going off to dinner. Hurry down there if you want to catch them. I'd say you got 15 minutes to get out of here. - You know you're gonna get trampled. - I'll handle it. I'll just tell them I dumped you. - I'm a bad boy, remember? - Sure you are. - Thanks for the flowers. - You deserve them. Along with that quiet, normal life you seem to want so badly. Thanks. You're a very bad man, Mr McNamara. Selling guns to children. How truly heartless of you. Prue must've done something to light a fire under those idiots. They're leaving. Good. - Which one is that? - Number eight. I combined two separation-of-power spells with a human-from-animal extraction spell. Okay, I have no idea what you just said. I'm getting the us out of them. And if it works, then hopefully we'll find Dr Williamson. - First things first. - Right. Okay. Okay. Prue monkey, still hungry? Look. - What was that? - A delayed reaction. - Phoebe, I think you did it. - I did do it. Okay. Here, I'll get it. Tell me again I'm not hunting down some demonic son of a bitch. Darryl, I told you when I called, he's a human being. With a supernatural talent for butchery. In the past four hours, this Dr Williamson has dropped off two more coolers at hospitals, and he's not bothering to stitch up his victims anymore. - He's killing people? - Yes. - Tell me where to find him. - I don't know. We've staked out all the hospitals, but somehow he's getting in, dropping off his gifts and getting out without anybody seeing him. He's using your powers, isn't he? Yes, but we found a way to stop him. - Not if I stop him first. - Darryl, don't kill him. Have you been listening to me? He may not give me a choice. The two people he killed, Frank McNamara and Arlen Jackson, they're criminals. But nobody deserves to die like that. If you try to stop him, he will kill you. McNamara. Phoebe, Leo. We have to call Prue. I know where Williamson is. Bobbie, it's been busy while I was gone. You got a buyer for these? Because I met somebody in County that might be able to move them for you. Bobbie. Was that his name? Get out of here now. - Dr Williamson. - Piper. Listen to me, you're sick. You're doing terrible things. - I'm saving lives. - No, you're hurting people. Piper, be careful. We have medicine for you. We think it might help. You know, I really have you to thank for all of this. I couldn't do it without you. Don't say that. Here. Take this, it'll make you better. Piper. - We wanna help you. - I don't want your help. I'm doing great things. I'm saving lives. I got a lot of work to do. Okay, well, then this is for the monkeys. And this is for my sister. - Any luck? - No, and I can't figure out another way to find him. All I have to do is locate him through his powers. Yeah, but his powers are our powers. Right, exactly. So the crystal keeps circling our street, and I keep finding us. Okay, keep trying. Guys, we need to talk about what we're gonna do. What do you mean? I thought we had a plan. I mean, we have the elixir. No, not anymore. He trashed it. - So we'll make more. - With what? I have nothing left to use. And the only shop that carries what I need closed four hours ago. And even if I made more elixir, Piper, we'd never get it into him. - He's much stronger than we are. - Guys, he was my doctor. - He tried to save my life, remember? - He could've killed us, Piper. - But he didn't. - No, but he might be out there right now trying to kill someone else. Look, we need to face the fact that he's one innocent - that we might not be able to save. - But he needs help. I know that, honey. Okay, then. So, what are you suggesting? You guys wanna vanquish him? You can't be serious. He's not a demon, he's a human being. Not anymore. But... Okay. We can't use our powers to punish anyway. You know that. Piper, we're not punishing, all right? We're saving lives. All you have to do is freeze him. And then what? You're gonna move him into the path of an oncoming bus, drop a building on him, kill him? Leo, tell me you found something, anything. Sorry. I don't think there's any way out of this one. I don't believe this. I found him. Dr Williamson. We can help you. But you have to stop hurting people. It's over. If you say so. Let's get out of here. You should've stayed away. Okay, Piper, freeze him. Him. Him. - It's not working. - Whatever you do, do not unfreeze that thing. You know, I'm getting pretty good at this. Okay, he's really strong. I don't know how much longer I can hold this. Piper, you do not let that go, okay? You do not let that go. Okay, yelling does not help. - Piper, when I tell you to, just let go. - What? We're done playing around. Hit the deck, now. No. Oh, God. Please don't die. Come on. Look at me, come on. Don't do this. Come on. Come on. Please don't die. Piper, honey. I'm sorry. Bye-bye, files. Well, at least everything's back to normal... ...for us. At least we're safe. - Yeah, what about them? - Oh, they'll be safe tomorrow when I drop them off at the wildlife conservatory. Hey, watch this. You guys, what do you think of evil? - You're gonna miss them, aren't you? - Yeah. Hey, we've been wondering where you've been. You know what? I have something for you. What is this? Ground rules, for me. "I want a man who hates my brand of cereal so there will always be some for me. A man whose love will catch me by surprise." - What is this? - It's a wish list. I hope I find someone as great as Leo. You deserve the best, and I think you found it. So you guys don't mind if he's hanging around a lot? We just want you to be happy, honey. Piper. Are you okay? His name was Curtis. Whose name was Curtis? Dr Williamson. I read it in his medical bio. His first name was Curtis. He never married because he was working all the time. Saving lives was more important to him than having a life of his own. Now his life is over, and I can't help but feel responsible for that. We tried to save him. But we didn't. Because we couldn't.
