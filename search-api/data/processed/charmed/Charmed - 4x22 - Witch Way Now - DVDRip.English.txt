and I will tell you the rest. Hey, more "Dear Phoebe" letters. Where do you want them? You can just put them anywhere. Maybe we ought to keep some of these in storage? - No, I'll get to them. - All of them? - Yes. I am on a roll. - More like on a mission. Hey, will you get these to Elise, please? And find out which one she wants to run. Yeah, sure. Right away. You're amazing, you know that? What do you mean? What is your secret? Herbs? Acupuncture? Do what Tashmin says and get on with your life. Tashmin? I take it you don't believe in psychics? You know, if it works for you, I'm all for it. It hasn't worked for me for a while. You know how sometimes you just find yourself going through a really bad period in your life? Don't even get me started. Well, let's just say I'm finally coming out from underneath mine, and nobody, nothing will ever bring me back to that place again. Good for you. Help me, Phoebe. What did you just say? I didn't say that. She did. Help me, Phoebe. Did they say how much longer this was gonna go on for? Three weeks, which means three months. A little higher. Well, better hope no demons attack. That'd be a bust, especially if one of us goes flying out the window. I wouldn't worry about that. There's so much chaos in the underworld. - They're too busy fighting each other. - I hope it lasts. I almost forgot what it's like to lead a normal life. It's gotta go a little higher. - I need a ladder. - Leo, just hover. No, no, no. I don't wanna jinx anything. I'd rather we not use magic unless we absolutely have to. - Thank you very much. - Come on, Piper, relax a little. Use it or lose it, lady. Fine. See, no major disaster struck. - We have a huge problem. - You were saying? - Cole tried contacting me again. - What, more whisperings? No, this time he was channelling through a TV psychic while I was at work. - He sounded so desperate. - Wait, did anybody else notice? My highly suspicious assistant. How am I supposed to move on with my life when I keep being haunted by his afterlife? - Leo, what do you think? - I think - you need to do something, fast. - No, I mean how is he holding on? I don't know. I guess because he's half demon, - it must be some kind of astral plane. - Whatever. We can't risk him contacting me again. I have to figure out a way to get to him and find out what he wants. Honey, what he wants is you. Why else would he be hanging on? Piper? Why is Leo frozen? Well, this is very strange. Guys, I think you ought to take a look at this. So much for not performing any magic, huh, Piper? Me? I didn't do that. I couldn't freeze all that stuff. But I can. Who are you? I'm the Angel of Destiny. And I've come to change yours. He's not freezing. Why isn't he freezing? You're wasting your time. I am beyond your powers. Besides, I pose no threat to you. Well, forgive us for not believing that, but the last being we met who could freeze time was a demon. It's because of a demon that I've come to see you, which, in and of itself, is very rare. We Angels of Destiny normally don't intervene. Except in extraordinary situations. Mozart at age 7. Michelangelo, Albert Einstein... ...Britney Spears. I don't understand. You three have accomplished something few others ever dream of. By vanquishing The Source of All Evil, you have fulfilled your shared destiny much earlier than anticipated. Some of us didn't think you'd ever achieve it, but that's beside the point. What's important is you have. And because of that, we are offering you a reward. A chance to chart a new destiny, one of your own design. A reward? You can continue to remain as you are, charmed, vested with all your witchly powers... ...and, of course, demonic burdens. Or... Or? You can choose to relinquish your magic and lead normal lives again. Unencumbered. Free. We'd wipe the entire slate clean. Nobody would ever come after you again. - Well, what do you say? - What do we say? Are you kidding? You can't just freeze the whole world and come in here and drop a bombshell like that and expect a quick decision. I don't care who you are. I don't think you quite grasp the uniqueness of this opportunity. No, I'm grasping it. But that is beside the point. The least you could do is give us a little time to think about it. Think about what? No time needed. Thanks, but, no, thanks. Right? Yeah. Right. Of course, right. But, you know, as long as he's offering, maybe we should talk about this. Just talk about it. Over there? Right over here, please. Now. Excuse us. You can't be serious, Phoebe. You, of all people, you love being a witch. - I know I do. But l-- - But what? What has changed? I don't know, I became queen of the underworld and nearly died carrying baby Lucifer. That's what changed, Paige. Paige, it's just that we've been doing this a lot longer than you have. And I'm not trying to discount all the good that we've done, or that we could do. But at the same time, I'm not gonna minimize the costs. Paige, I can't get pregnant because of what we do. Punching out demons just isn't as much fun as it used to be. So, what are you guys saying? She's saying you need some time, which I'll grant. But not too much time. After all, other people's destinies are tied to yours. And since it's your charmed destiny that's at stake here, majority will rule. Two sisters will decide the fate of all three. So consider your choice wisely. Perhaps what happens next will help you to decide. Hey, did you just freeze me? - No, dear, the Angel of Destiny did. - Who? Yeah, you better check with the Elders and make sure he's for real. I'm not kidding. - Hello? - Don't talk, just listen. Darryl? What's wrong? Apparently, you guys are about to be put under surveillance. An FBl agent named Jackman called me into his offiice today. He did a search on unsolved cases. Apparently, your names came up on way too many witness lists. What do you mean? What does he know? I don't know, but I'm gonna try to find out. In the meantime, just lay low. And whatever you do, don't use any magic. So are we screwed? Maybe, but that would take destiny out of our hands, and I don't think that's what the angel meant. Okay, ix-nay on the angel-nay talk. Let's go upstairs. Come on. I still don't understand how coming up here is gonna help. Actually, it's pretty simple. So you guys have been home all day, right? Yeah. So? There's no way he would have had time to bug the inside of the house. He's gotta be listening from the outside. Is it ironic that here we are presented with the opportunity to give up our powers, and now we suddenly can't even use them? Except not using our powers doesn't necessarily mean that we won't be exposed. We still have Cole to worry about. Phoebe, you can't make contact with a dead demon husband. Yeah, but if I don't, he will. And then what? The FBl is outside, and if they find out about us, it's gonna be the same thing as last year. We don't want that, now, do we? So I'm gonna cast the "To Find a Lost Love" spell. I mean, if Cole's soul is on some astral plane, it should astral me there, right? Are you sure he even has a soul? Well, what else would be calling out to me? Cole needs closure. And so do l. We will create a distraction outside in case your spell inside creates any fireworks. Be careful. - Good. - Come on through. Going through. Come on, man, let's get it moving. Must we spike the lemonade? I don't know-- That phone-company van looks suspicious. - Why? - Well, because it wasn't there earlier. And, besides, he didn't put out any cones. That's what you're basing it on? Well, it's the best that I got, okay? Now, are you ready? Why don't you just...to the street? Because what if somebody drives around the corner mid...? Now, you just need to use some of your God-given magic. Okay? Go. Anyone feel like a little cool down? - Let's go. - Yeah! Easy, boys, there's enough for everyone. Whither my love Wherever you be Through time and space Take my heart nearer to thee - Cole. - What are you doing here? Nobody's allowed to be here! Here? Where is here? We gotta move fast. Come on. We'll be safe here, but not for long. We have to keep moving, or the beast will devour us both, for eternity. I knew you'd hear my cries. - Cole. - It's all right. You did the right thing. The Source is gone, devoured. This is the wasteland, where all vanquished demons end up. The beast feeds on their essence... ...their powers. So, what are you doing here? Holding on to our love. I'm a demon with a soul, Phoebe. It's rather unique to the cosmos. That's why my soul's been able to cling here, keep from moving on. Oh, but that's not healthy. Everyone has to move on, you know, sooner or later. Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say, you'll get to go to the good place. Me... Over here. Come on. Okay, you know, you can't keep running from that thing forever. That's why I've been calling you. You can help save me. Save us. - How? - Get Leo to get the Grimoire. That resurrection spell that the wizard was after, you can use that to resurrect me. What? It's easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is... What's the matter? I can't use dark magic again. I won't. Not even for us? Phoebe! - Hold me! - Help me! - Your powers! - I don't have any powers! Phoebe. What's the matter? What happened? - Something's hurting her. - Something is killing her! Paige, here, reversal spell. Return thy love Wherever she be Through time and space Bring her back... It's okay. You're okay. Oh, my God. What was I thinking? I hope the freeze didn't wear off. Agent Jackman, FBl. We should talk. In case you're wondering, that's just a copy. Nice way to engender trust, Agent Jackman. If I wanted to expose you, I could have done that six months ago when that file first crossed my desk. Expose us as what? Witches. It's the only logical explanation for all the unsolved cases, the missing persons, the mysterious deaths. Prove it. - Something's hurting her. - Something is killing her! Paige, here, reversal spell. Return thy love Wherever she be Through time and space Bring her back to me That doesn't prove anything. No, but it implies everything, especially when coupled with that file. You think your newspaper wouldn't run that story? - What do you want? - Believe it or not, your help. See, I specialize in occult-style slayings. That's why I was watching you, in hopes of catching a serial killer. A witch-hunter. All right, I've heard enough of this nonsense. Wait a second, he froze before. This time, I was prepared. Like I said, I specialize in this stuff. Supposed to be only a few of these amulets left in the world. Got this one off the witch-hunter we're after. Her name is Selena. I traced her genealogy all the way back to the witch trials. I think killing you people is in her blood, it's what she lives for. I mean, why else would she have burned her last three victims at the stake? Why are you telling us this? Well, because I thought you were gonna be her next victims. But now that I know who you really are and what you can do, I need you to help me find her before she kills again. - Do you have any idea where she is? - I did for a while. I had her in custody once, but she got away. These are some of Selena's personal belongings. Now, from what I know, if you use your powers on them, you might be able to find her. Now, you do that, I'll make sure those files disappear forever. You don't... Well, you figure it out. Call me. - I don't trust him. - Gee, you think? Maybe we should take the Angel of Destiny up on his offer. Great, so we'd be free and so would Selena, who, for all we know, could be a warlock. No, warlocks don't burn witches at the stake, - they just steal their powers. - Exactly. Powers, Phoebe, the very things we were given to do good with. Remember? - Yeah, Paige, I remember. - Guys... Do you really, or has all that dark magic just kind of gotten into your brain? Guys! I can't believe you're so willing to throw away our powers. Paige, you don't know the hell that I've been through. - You didn't live it. - Oh, really? I was just turned into a vampire, and then I was shrunk, and then we switched bodies and-- Okay, imagine going through that for years. - All I'm asking is for my life back. - Okay, guys, enough! We need to focus. What about you, Piper, what do you think? I think we need to see this through like the angel suggested. So, Paige... ...you are gonna go up to the attic and get started on this stuff. We will meet you there. Scoot. Leo! You can orb. It's all right. - What about the FBl agent? - He already busted us. But, supposedly, all he wants is our help. Find anything out about the Angel of Destiny? He's legit, and so is his offer. Okay, can you do us a favour and go get Darryl and make sure that Agent Jackman is legit too? And, meanwhile, we have a witch-hunter to find. Don't ask, just go. - Having a crappy day? - Yeah. - Cole? - Yeah. Phoebe. You don't want his powers. You want me! Here I am. Come and get me! Come on! Hurry up, end this! This could be good. "Before the flame subsides, Iet wax from the candle drip onto the crystal. Once consecrated, scry with the crystal for the one who is sought." Ain't magic grand? Okay, bye. That was Morris. He confirmed that there is a serial killer on the loose - doing exactly what Jackman said. - We're all over it. He also said that Jackman has more information on us than he shared, including our genealogy. Dating all the way back to Melinda Warren. - What does that mean? - They're gonna keep checking. It means he's gone through a lot of trouble to get as much information on us as possible. I got a bad feeling he's not gonna let us off the hook so easily after this is all over. What, he's just gonna keep using us afterwards? Great, Charlie's-freaking-Angels. This just keeps getting better and better. Got Selena. Do we still go after her? Well, we don't have a choice. We can't let her run around burning people at the stake. She has bodyguards. Lots of bodyguards. I wonder why Jackman didn't tell us about them. Probably figured we wouldn't help if we knew. Paige! Did you not have the sense to sense if anybody else was in the room before you orbed us in here? Going somewhere? We're gonna need some serious memory dust after all this is over. Yeah, well, we gotta get out of here. Phoebe. Cole. I swear, he was just there. Time to go. Orb, orb, orb. - Where is she? - In there. You don't need that. She's unconscious. - She put up much of a fight? - No, but her bodyguards did. Bodyguards? She had bodyguards? Yeah, lots of them, with lots of guns, and they weren't shy about using them either. Must have known we were closing in on her. Still, don't you think it's odd that a serial killer has hired guns protecting her? Well, maybe she's not working alone. Or maybe you're just not telling us everything. Maybe I'm not. What are you gonna do about it? Well, for one thing, we're not gonna let you take her without a warrant. You know, you're all the same. You think that just because you have gifts, powers, that you're above it all. You're special. - Well, I know different. - Oh, really? Yeah. Your arrogance is your Achilles' heel. That's why witch-hunters and demons are always after you, and they always will be. I wouldn't trade places with you for the world. - Here's your warrant. - So when do we get our files? When she's in jail, and I feel I'm safe. - Safe from what? - Safe from you. I don't wanna be another one of those people who mysteriously disappear around here. I knew he'd never give up those files. In case anybody is wondering, we are officially screwed. Not necessarily. No. We are not giving up our powers. Paige, I don't wanna give up our powers either, but I don't wanna give up our lives even more. He's just gonna keep using us. Unless we let the angel wipe the slate clean. Look, Paige, we said we would wait to decide until this thing played out, and it has. And frankly, if the angel hadn't made this offer, I'd probably think differently. And I'd think, "Let's just keep fighting." But I'm tired of fighting. And Jackman's right. It is never-ending. Unless we end it ourselves. So do we need to talk to Leo about this first? No. Doesn't have anything to do with him, it's just us. And he will understand. You guys are only seeing the bad. What about all the wonder of being witches, the stuff you introduced me to in the first place? You're gonna let all that go? Paige, it doesn't balance out anymore. And after everything that we've lost, it doesn't seem worth it. What about all the good we've done? - Doesn't that count for anything? - Of course it does. But that's exactly why we have this choice to make. He said we fulfilled our destiny. We've done it. This is supposed to be our reward for that. Yeah? Well, pardon me if it doesn't seem like much of a reward. Because without being witches... ... I wouldn't have sisters. Are you sure about this? Yeah. As sure as we're ever gonna be. You understand this decision is final. There'll be no changing your minds. We understand. Very well. Hold it! Just so we're clear. This wipes the entire slate clean, no "read the fine print" technicalities, no more demons, no more vengeful warlocks-- And we won't have to worry about Agent Jackman anymore or anyone else who might have found out we were witches? Exactly. Just free to lead normal lives with no demonic aftertaste. Absolutely. Will we remember? Being witches, that is? You'll remember everything. This doesn't change your history... ...only your future. And what about the Book? It will pass to some future descendant. What about Cole? Will he keep trying to make contact with me? I don't know. I have no control over that. He exists beyond time and space, outside destiny's reach. What is it? It's just that he's still holding on. That's why he appeared to me. So maybe if I could tell him that I don't have the power to save him, then he'll be able to move on for good. I don't think that's such a good idea, considering what happened last time. I can't leave it like this. I owe him more than that. Cole. I have to talk to you, but I don't have a lot of time. - Did you see me come to you? - Yes. I did. - How did you do that? - It's a secret. I'm giving up my powers. We all are. - What? - I don't have time to explain, - but it's true, which means-- - I know what it means. Cole... ...we did the best we could. We tried every way possible to make this work, but... It wasn't meant to be. And it wasn't because we didn't love each other. It's just... ...Iove wasn't enough. So now we have to move on, okay? The both of us. You better go. Before the beast attacks. Are you okay? Yeah. - Let's do this. - Well, we've been thinking a little bit... Are you having second thoughts? Not about the decision, unfortunately. About Jackman and Selena. Yeah, a lot of things don't add up. His extensive knowledge of witches, he got ahold of that amulet... The fact that he came in alone to pick up Selena. The bodyguards. We just wanna make sure that we've done the right thing before it's too late to do anything about it. Okay. Is that okay? Oh, sure, absolutely. Frankly, I thought you were being a bit premature anyway. Then why didn't you say something? Can't. Free will, and all. Let me know when you're ready. So now what? Leo? - We were just coming to get you. - Why? What did you find? Another genealogy Jackman has besides yours. Well, yeah, we know Selena is a descendant of witch-hunters. No, Jackman is. - Selena is the daughter of a witch. - What? She is not a suspect, she's a victim. They have her in a safe house because somebody's trying to kill her. Please tell me we didn't just help a witch-hunter get a witch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Somebody, please help me! No one can hear you. Not where we are. Please don't! No! - But I must. - No! Oh, God. You see, it's my duty. It's what I was born to do. It's what I will continue to do until every last one of you is dead. Help! You're not gonna get away from me this time, witch. Help. You're making a mistake. I swear, I'm not a witch. Of course you are, Selena. It's in your blood. Your mother was, that makes you one too. Please, I'm begging you. You know why they burned witches at the stake 400 years ago? So they would burn forever in eternal fire. They used greenwood too, made it last longer. Prolong the agony. No! Help! Come to save your sister witch, have you? Actually, yeah. You see, I buried the rest of the amulets around here in anticipation of your arrival. Your powers are useless here. However... ...mine aren't. Move and she dies. It was his plan all along. He was gonna kill us anyway. Hey, how's it feel to be powerless, huh? Mortal. You're the scourge of mankind, a blasphemy! Burning will be your justice too. Get Selena! Help me. - Piper, the leg! - Hurry! What are you doing? Piper! Saving her life just cost you yours. Cole. I couldn't very well let you die, now, could l? - I don't understand, how are you--? - Here? Let's just say I picked up a few powers lately. Quite a few, actually. I'm not giving up on us, Phoebe. Ever. Paige, you gotta go get the amulet. - Go, go, go. - You're gonna be okay. Okay, okay, a little more. A little more. That's good. Here we go. - Where's Paige? - She had to park down the street because the driveway was blocked. That's ridiculous. I'll go talk to them, - tell them to move. - No, it's not a big deal. And to think, 24 hours ago, that was our biggest problem. How'd it go? Well, it looks like we got away with everything so far. Thanks to Selena testifying for us. What about how Agent Jackman died? They're stumped. They can't figure out how he shot himself from 20 feet away. What are they gonna do, subpoena Cole? You guys stopped one of their own from killing. - I think they'd be grateful. - Yeah, one would hope. At least until they find those files on us. They won't. I sort of orbed them into a volcano. You what? Excuse me, are you allowed to do that? Well, my job is to protect my charges. That's all I did. Thanks. Maybe, sometime soon, you won't have to protect your charges. Are you okay with that? Whatever you guys decide, I'll support. I mean that. The door's stuck. It's you. Well, still ready to retire? Actually... ... I don't think so anymore. We saved someone. And it felt good. It felt right. Besides, I got a little taste of what life would be like without my powers, and I didn't like it at all. What about you? Majority rules, right? Might as well make it unanimous. What can I say, we're masochists. - We are? - Yeah, sometimes. But Phoebe's right. This isn't a choice we have to make. It's who we are. You realize you won't get this opportunity again? We understand. Very well. By the way, thought you'd like to know, neither decision would have affected yours... ...and Leo's personal destiny. What? You'll find out soon. - Oh, my God. - What? - Don't you get it? - What? Don't you get it? - She's pregnant! - Who's pregnant? - You're pregnant!
