- Can't lose what you never had. I hate when she plays astral games. - Marco. - Polo. - What were you doing down there? - Practicing. Trying to use telekinesis in astral mode. Witch exercises. Since when? Since I studied up on Belthazor. The Triad couldn't have sent us a worse demon. Or one with worse skin. I would hate to find myself alone with this guy. Yeah, well, you wouldn't last long. None of us would. That's why I'm trying to teach my astral self how to fight. - I have a date with Cole. - You say that like it's a bad thing. It's a lunch date. - So? - So it's not a good sign. Lunch is a cheap imitation of dinner. That's why it has its own special menu. And, you know, we kissed last week. We should be on to dinner - and candlelight by now. - Well, may... I can't believe you haven't taken care of that tooth. Yeah, well, I have a dentist appointment in an hour. Good. I hate to see you so miserable. Me too. Stop right there, please. Okay, come ahead. That way. There we go. Go ahead. - Hello? - Hey, did you cast any - "give me a sign" spells lately? - No, why? I don't know, it just seems like somebody's dropping signs right in front of me. Literally. Okay, Prue, you need to ignore the signs and get yourself in to a dentist. Yeah, I know. Hold it. Hello, Prue? I'll call you back. Excuse me. - You're with Social Services, right? - No, why? The guy won't come out of his loft up there. And we're supposed to start demolition today. - Someone still lives here? - Well, if you can call it that. Poor guy says he hasn't stepped outside in four years. Hello? Close the door, go away. I just wanna talk. Please go away. No. Don't... Don't come any closer. - Are you hurt? - My head. It's exploding. - The pain, you're letting it in. - What pain? Everyone's pain. From the city, the streets. I feel it. I feel all of it. I won't hurt you. You are hurting me. Your pity, it's like razors inside. - Please, I can... - Oh, your tooth. I feel your tooth. All your pain. I can't stand it. Why didn't you just go when I asked? I just can't believe you introduced me as "a friend." Okay, social malfunction. I hadn't seen the woman in years. I'm sorry. I lost my wings for you. You know, I've hurled my body into the path of oncoming demons. You wanted heaven, I took you there, literally. I am more than a friend. I know, but if I had introduced you as my fianc√©, she would've asked how we met, when we're getting married, where my ring is, questions that I can't answer, now can I? I suppose that's how I became a doctor too. Leo, that's what you were. Look, what am I supposed to tell people, that I'm engaged to a whitelighter? Sometimes being magical kind of takes the magic right out of things. - Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. - Oh, come on. Don't you sometimes? Every now and then, I just wanna feel what it's like to live in the real world. Hey. What are you two doing together? - Cole pulled up behind me. - Good timing. Hey, look, it's my lunch date. Sorry I'm late. I got held up on a case. You look amazing. It's all part of my master plan. Phoebe, I wanted to talk to you about the signs... The assignment that we were talking about on the phone. - Where did it lead? - To this incredibly tragic guy who's scared to leave his own home, which might be okay - if it weren't about to be torn down. - Was there a social worker there? No, but I was told that a deputy was going there to evict him, and he has no place to go. Let me make a call, - see what I can do. - Kitchen. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? We agreed no more Triad reports, not until my plan succeeds. I can't be associated with any more failed attempts. - Phoebe. - Hey. I just need some aspirin. Prue has a toothache. Water. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Just got disconnected. Prue followed my signs. The plan will work. If it doesn't, then you can rat me out to the Triad. Based on everything you said, it sounds like your shut-in's a future empath. An empath? And me without my dictionary. They're mortals who can actually feel what other people feel. It's a rare gift. When they die, they often return to Earth as empaths, where they blend into society as counsellors, elders, teachers. They use their sensitivity to guide mortals, ease their pain, even heal them. No, I don't think this guy would look at it as a gift. He's one big, raw nerve ending. You should've seen how he reacted to my toothache. Well, it could be he's rejecting his gift, fighting the emotions he feels instead of embracing them. Well, he sure sounds like an innocent to me. It'd be a shame to lose a future empath and all the good he'll do. I care less about his afterlife than his current one. I know what it's like to receive a power that you just do not understand. What I don't understand is who sent the signs that you followed? It's hard to say, it could be them, it could be... Cole. I got a guy at Housing Authority who'll relocate your shut-in if he leaves voluntarily. - Here's my card. Have him page me. - Thanks. All right. Prue, do you want us to go with you? No, this guy can barely deal with one person, let alone three, but thank you. Okay then, ready for lunch? Lunch would be great. Would you mind if we join you? I mean, it would be great. Two couples on the town in the real world. What could be greater? It's up to you. Why not? No. - No! I have to get out. - It's okay, Father Thomas. Relax. No, they're tearing it down. I have to get there. - Hold on now. - No, please. Let me go. I have to get to that building. I must protect the innocent. Please! To the apartment. Protect the innocent. - Let's go. - Come on, Father. A little help here! I'm sorry, ma'am. I know he's scared, but I personally handed him a final eviction notice two weeks ago. Officer, please. Cole Turner, assistant district attorney, he knows the case and he wants to help, but only if I can keep this guy out of jail. You got three minutes. Thank you. Hello. Hey. It's me again, Prue. I took a pain reliever for my tooth. The deputy downstairs told me that your name's Vince. - What's your last name? - Misery. Well, in that case, would you like some company? That's not funny. Yeah. Neither is your situation. Vince... ...you know that deputy is here to arrest you for civil disobedience. I'll die if they put me in jail. I believe you. That's why I came back to find you a new home. - But you have to leave with me now. - I can't. Can't go outside. Vince, I know what it's like. I know what it's like to have a gift that you can't control, that you never asked for. And living with that is hard, really hard... Don't tell me what's hard. You avoid your pain. I feel it. Right, then let's talk about the blessings, the rewards that come with having that gift. I mean, you can't even begin to... Words, just empty words. You don't feel them in your heart. I know. You feel fear and panic, because something's coming for you. Something you're afraid you can't stop. Are these the blessings you want me to feel thankful for? - I'm sorry. - Yes, you are. You are sorry. And confused and afraid. And it's drowning me alive. Deputy. Time's up. Open the door. Can't you see? This is not a gift. This is a curse. I am cursed to feel everything all the time from everyone. I can't go outside that door, not now, not ever. I'm coming in. Hey. - How'd you do that? - I was sent here to help you, and that's what I'm gonna do. Free the empath Release his gift Let his pain be cast adrift What the hell's the matter with you people? Sorry, deputy, that door stuck on me too. He's ready now. But how? We'll talk later. This is the DA. Page him. He'll find a place for you to go. Thank you. You don't know what you just did for me. Let's get you out of this dump. What's the matter with you? Just wondering what you're feeling right now. Yeah? Why is that? Because... ...I can't feel a thing. So... - How about those Niners? - The what? The Niners, the 49ers, the football team. You don't follow football? He isn't human. You okay? Check. We're gonna be right back. Phoebe, I know you're upset Leo crashed your lunch date, but... No, it's not that. Cole is pulling away from me again. I can see it. - Premonition? - Intuition. Look, Cole, before the girls get back, I need to tell you something. What, spinach in my teeth? Oh, no, no. It... It has to do with Phoebe. Well, I just feel very protective of her. We all do. You know, she's a sweetie. She's been through a lot. A lot of loss. - I sense that. - Yeah, well, she's into you. I can tell. Whatever your intentions are, I just... I want you to be straight with her, okay? I don't wanna see her get hurt. Heaven forbid. Hey, what did we miss? Leo was just giving me investment advice. - He was? - Yeah. Really? Why don't we split this? Oh, honey, did you forget your wallet again? I guess so. I got it. I have to take this. Forgive me. - Belthazor. - Got your page. I owe you for sending me the witch. It went down just like you said. Thanks. You made physical contact during the spell? I could feel the empathic cancer pass out of me and right into her. How did you know that would happen? That's how you got it, isn't it? - How long does she have? - She's a mortal. She won't be able to fight it like a demon can. I give her a day until the weight of human emotion crushes her. - You'll enjoy watching it. - I'll be out of town. I don't need to see the other two suffer the loss of their sister. Compassion? From you, Belthazor? I think maybe you've been undercover a little too long. - Not your concern. - True. My only concern is the empath who cursed me, Father Thomas. And I know just where to track him down. No. I can't risk the witches finding you and reversing their magic. You forget who I was before I was an empath, Belthazor. I'm immune to their powers. Maybe, but you're not immune to mine. Understood. Look, I'm really sorry that I missed my appointment this morning, okay, but I couldn't get out of work. Is there any way that Dr. Timmons can fit me in? We're pretty booked up. All right, but my tooth kills. I really need to... - Peter! - Are you okay, Miss Halliwell? - Yeah. - I thought you'd like it. That was my tooth. I'm having a really, really bad day because it hurts a lot. - Let me see if I can do anything. - Thanks. I mean, I really appreciate it. I think that it's abscessed. I'm so sorry. I don't... My tooth has been hurting for a long... What is she laughing at? Who of you guys is laughing? Here's Mrs. Freeman's chart. That's just the nitrous oxide at work, Mrs. Freeman. You're fine. Nitrous oxide. Laughing gas? The best I can do is fit you in at 4:15. No. No, no, no. That's okay. I have to go. What did I do? You know what? Is there something wrong? No. It's just you haven't said anything since we left the restaurant. A lot on my mind, I guess. Work? Yeah, sort of. I don't know how to say this. Don't ever start a sentence like that with a girl. You don't wanna see me anymore, do you? Right. I never accept a lunch date. It's got nothing to do with you. I mean, how I feel about you. - I don't understand. - It's complicated. I think that I deserve to know. I promise, you'll understand soon. Maybe more than you'd want to. Are you okay? I haven't felt anything like that since Andy was alive. Anything like what? Spinning into infinity. You know, that headlong spiral that steals your breath and stops your heart. Prue, what the hell are you talking about? - Falling in love. - Falling in love? Prue, I just got dumped, okay? I'm trying to experience a break-up here. - Who's falling in love? - Cole. Okay, you're so off-track... Wait. I felt that too. Your heart just jumped, and I felt it. You're falling in love too. We got a problem. Prue cast a spell to remove Vince's pain. - Who's Vince? - The shut-in. But I think, and call it a hunch, that it backfired and made Prue an empath. What kind of hunch? Okay, I don't really know how it happened. All right, l... All I was trying to do was help an innocent... Hey, what is that I'm feeling? You. You're feeling fear. Spill it. l... I'm afraid that you're in danger. You weren't meant to receive this gift. - You can't handle it. - Okay, you're looking at it all wrong. Okay, I was guided to Vince, remember? Maybe I was meant to have this gift. But, Prue, you're not an empath. You're just a witch. Right, a witch whose power comes from her emotions, all right. Look, I was looking for a power boost to fight Belthazor. Maybe this is it. Will you guys please stop being so negative? - We didn't say anything. - Yeah, but I can feel all of your... - What was that? - I think I did it. It's just all of your doubts are screaming in my head. I've gotta get control of this. Book of Shadows, maybe there's something about empaths. - Where are you going? - To help you. - Yeah, but you're dying to see Cole. - Stop that. I did not say that. Phoebe, go to him, all right? Tell him what's in your heart. I think you'll find him receptive. Prue, I can't. I need to stay here with you. - Do you really think he'll be receptive? - Yes. Now go get your man. He wants you. - We'll help you out. - No, no, no. I'll hit the book alone. Your guys' couple issues are really starting to hurt my head. Wait, we have couple issues? Resentment, denial. Be nice. Leo, what is it exactly that you resent? Well, I tried to step out into the real world today like you wanted. Yes, and I appreciated your subtle yet effective lunch invitation. I was humiliated. - When? - When? When the bill came. You know, Piper, in my time, men opened doors for women when they walked in and they stood up when they left and they always, always paid for meals. I just assumed that you were okay with it. - I'm not. - Then you should've said something. Look, Piper, you want me in the real world, but I'm not of this world. I know, and I'm... I see your point. I'm sorry I didn't understand. I know this must be very difficult for you. - It is. - Leo, you have to understand, I am very proud to be with you. And so proud that I need to share you with the rest of the world, my world. And you know, the other stuff we'll just... We'll figure out. Not now. I have a headache. - Phoebe, what are you doing here? - I... I came to tell you something. Actually... I was always much better at "show" than "tell." You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Neither do you. Morning. Morning. How you feeling about last night? Last night was... ...magical. You? What do you think? Don't. Right here, right now, this place... ...it's perfect. I wish the whole world were just right in this room. We wouldn't have to worry about what happened next. Are you going someplace? Maybe. I'm not sure yet. You know... ...if you're hiding anything from me, you don't have to hide anything from me. What makes you think I'm hiding something? For the same reason I know how you really feel about me. If you're in some kind of trouble... - I can handle it. - I can help you. No, you can't. I have to go. Am I gonna see you again? One way or another. I promise. Where did Father Thomas go? Crest Hills. It's a psychiatric hospital. If I were capable of feelings, I might enjoy the irony of that. What happened to the good Father, pray tell? Nervous breakdown. Three years ago. Something about losing his gift to help others. Well, he might wanna worry about who's going to help him. As should you. I'm not the one who said it, you did. - Oh, I want a divorce. - Hey, you walk in and out of here - like you're the one... - Don't turn your back on me. If I tell you again... Every day, it's the same thing. I don't love you anymore. Prue, what's the matter? What are you doing in the basement? I'm... I'm just trying to escape. The emotions, they're... They're everywhere. - I can't get away. - What do you mean? It's not just you and Piper. I'm picking up things from other people's houses. They're these people, and they're in my head and they're in my heart. And it just hurts. No! Stay away, Piper. No contact. Okay. God, it is just so hard to concentrate, to even talk. I just want it to go away. My head, it feels like it's gonna split. - What was that? - Her empathic ability. The more she feels, the more powerful she becomes. All right, if this is a gift, we are returning it. It was not meant for you. Come on, we're gonna find this Vince guy. Come on. I know, I know, you're gonna be okay. Phoebe, where were you when we called? - Cole's. - You could have changed. All night? Did you? Was he? Okay, can we talk about this later? - Yeah, where's Prue? - Waiting in the car. Oh, this does not look good. Cole said that Vince never called. I'm starting to smell a demon. If you're right, it would explain why the gift didn't kill him. I think we should stop calling this a gift. Okay, so how did the demon formerly known as Vince become empathic anyway? Well, I'm guessing he got the power from a true empath. It would act like a curse on the demon, making him feel the pain that he inflicts. Phoebe. Phoebe. Okay, come on. Okay, we're definitely right about the demon theory. That was a premonition? But you didn't touch anything. This room must be dripping with psychic remnants. - Well, what did you see? - Murders, and lots of them. Like a big demon killing spree. - Just random? - No, more like a mission. Could be he's looking for revenge on the empath who cursed him. Well, if we're gonna help Prue, then we gotta get there first. What was the last murder you saw? A man at a mental hospital, Crest Hills, but I don't know if it happened already. Well, there's only one way to find out. And who are you here to visit today? We came to visit our father. What's his name? Dad. This is a psychiatric facility. We can't very well let every... Okay. This place is a minefield for you. You should wait here. No, if Vince comes, I need to be there to reverse the spell. That looks like the guy from my premonition. Hi. Excuse me. I know this is probably gonna sound crazy... ...but are you an empath? You people don't have to humour me, you know. I know you don't believe me. No, we're not doctors or patients. We're... We're witches, and we're looking for the empath who cursed a demon. I was working as a priest, helping people when it came after me. - You mean Vince. - Is that what it calls itself? Vinceres is a demonic assassin. Timeless, unstoppable. But you stopped him. How? When the demon took my throat to kill me, I laid my hands on him as if to heal him. - And you gave him your power. - Yes. I didn't know if I could, but I did. I cursed Vinceres and myself. How did you curse yourself? I'm staring at eternity on Earth with no gift and no reason to be. Well, I can't help you with the eternity part, but I can give you a reason to be now. Yeah, I know, I know. I read the paper. We have to get to that building and safely relocate the demon. It's funny you should mention that, because when Prue met Vinceres, she thought that he was a shut-in, and... - You didn't cast a spell? - She did, but... I gave up everything to prevent that beast from killing again. If it's free, you can't stop it. - Nobody can! - Stop yelling. Please. I can't take it. In the walls. Can't you hear it? Here he is, Vinceres. Pretty much lives up to his gloss. Unstoppable hit man. Just keeps going till he gets his target. Great, the Energizer demon. So, what do we do? Nothing. There's nothing you can do. It will find us, and when it does, we're all dead. Well, you're just a ray of sunshine, now aren't you? - Hey. Anything? - No. She won't say a word. We've gotta snap Prue out of this or she won't be able to reverse the spell - when the demon attacks. - You can't reverse the spell. Vinceres is immune to witches' magic. Hold on. Prue's spell worked. Because the demon allowed it to work, to its own advantage. You'll find your spells useless now. Maybe we actually don't need to reverse the spell. - What are you thinking? - Well, Prue's getting hit by emotions, all emotions. And her powers are tied to these emotions. So maybe if she could figure out a way to channel them, then she'd be pretty unstoppable herself, don't you think? - Is that possible? - From what I've seen, your sister is too far gone. She won't live to see the night. - All right, that's it. - Piper... No, I'm sorry, but this man has experienced the entire rainbow of human emotions, and the best he has to give us here is self-pity? I don't think so. Look, you used this power to stop this demon. Now my sister has your power. Deal with it and then help us. Go away! I know how you feel. Your instinct is to pull away. Don't. - Try to find an inner calm. - I can't. The pain, the noise. You're carrying a cross you were never meant to bear. I'm sorry. Your sorrow, I can't... I can't take it. Please. You've been fighting what you feel. That's natural, and it's wrong. To find your strength as an empath, you must embrace the emotion. Focus on me. The feelings are ripping you apart because you're fighting them like the demon did. The demon can't handle human emotions, you can. - Anybody home? - Piper, now! Okay, I guess this is the unstoppable part. - Where's Father Thomas? - Plan B, plan B. Okay, do we have a plan C? Leo, hurry. Prue, take my hand. My power to ease human suffering lay in my hands. That's how I cursed the demon. You must channel the empathic gift into your power. I can't. - I can't control my powers. - Prue, you can do it. You have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to feel the world's emotions. All it means to be human, the good and the bad. Don't be afraid. Just tell me where the empath is, and I won't kill you. You want him? Come and get him. How'd you do that? If you want the empath, you're gonna have to go through me. Stay back. This is my fight. You can't hurt me, witch. I can handle your powers. - I can handle your powers. - What about pain? Human pain. The voices, they're gone. So you're not an empath anymore. I'm sorry. I was hoping that we could return your gift. But you did. It appears I have the ability to understand what people are feeling even without a magic assist. - You kicked ass. - I did, didn't I? - Hey. - Hey. You know, I cannot wait for this Novocain to wear off. Can you unfreeze my tongue? You're lucky that dentist even saw you. Okay, there's one thing I don't get. How did you vanquish Vinceres? It was something that Father Thomas said to me. Vinceres was trying to fight off the feelings of an empath, because demons cannot handle human emotion. And so you astral-projected into his body. Yes, carrying the emotional baggage of half of the city. I forced him to feel, and he couldn't take it. - Hey. - Hey. Just left Father Thomas. I got connections at the archdiocese. They're gonna let him return to his church. Thank you. You're an angel. Well, not technically. So I guess the only other question is who sent the signs that led Prue to the demon? Well, probably the Triad. Or Belthazor. Which means we have to be careful next time we get a sign. Yeah, but, Prue, you got quite a power boost there. You gonna miss it? Yeah. But I did get to stop an unstoppable demon. Got a little taste of what my future powers are gonna be like. I'm on the right path. Speaking of paths, what's up with you and your Cole dependency? - Where do you guys stand? - Oh, I have no idea. I think I'm gonna go find out right now. Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. I half expected not to find you here. Yeah? Well, an associate of mine didn't do as he was told,
