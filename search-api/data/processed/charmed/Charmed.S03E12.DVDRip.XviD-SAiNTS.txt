- Protective... - "Our sources"? What is this, government surveillance? You have people watching me? Mr. Chang, your picture was in the Metro section today. Because I planted some trees. Mr. Chang, there were four brutal murders in the last week. The only common denominator is the victim's picture was in the Metro section the day they died. The mayor's in Metro today. You guys harassing him? - Mr. Chang, I am trying to help you. - I don't have any money or enemies. Why would anyone want to kill me? This is crazy. All right, what do we do if Darryl can't convince him to lay low? Well, we follow him, and if a demon attacks, we kick some Wiccan ass. Look who's back and badder than ever. It feels good to be back. It's the best way to put this whole Cole thing behind me. Yeah, well that's quite a turnaround. - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that, I mean, you know, up until last week, you were kind of quiet and not really interested in things demonic. And now... I am back. Bad guys, beware. Too bad we don't know who the bad guy is. Yeah, well, at least we know who his next victim is. - Hey. - Hey. - So did you get anything out of him? - Just a migraine. That's about it. So, what, you're just gonna let him go? I don't have a choice. He declined protection. Phoebe, are you sure he's the guy you saw get attacked - in your premonition? - Oh, yeah. And it happened at night too, so we can't just let him go. All right. Then we need to split up in teams. First one to see a demon yells "vanquish," okay? Come on. Innocents and alleys. Don't they ever learn? Yeah, I know. Come on. What the hell? - You again? - Shut up. Keep your head down. What happened? Why did you let him get away? I know that demon. I dated that demon. I think they're lost, Piper. Dead. No. They're not. Completely. Piper waters when she's nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about. Chang's in protective custody. No, it's not him. It's the whole "my boyfriend is a demon" thing. It kind of hits a nerve with all of us. And obviously I'm not that upset, because I'm with Leo, who is obviously not... Piper also babbles when she's nervous. I resent that. I am expressing a valid concern about this continuing issue in our lives. What are you babbling about? You know, if I could freeze the two of you, I would. Often. So here's the demon that we're looking for. Or at least who he used to be. - Tom Peters. - Wait, I didn't know you dated the captain of the college football team. - How suburban. - Yeah, he was a great guy. I remember Peters. He blew out his knee three weeks into his rookie year. - What, about five, six years ago? - Leo! There were rumours about gambling debts and that whole scene. There's also a missing person's. It never got closed. - He just kind of disappeared. - More like went underground. I wonder if his mom still lives in town. Leo! A woman on a mission? I guess the captain of the football team was a bigger deal than we ever knew. Prue, are you sure we should pursue this? Ask Phoebe. It was her premonition. All right, where on earth is...? Leo, what took you so long? I had... Have a situation. You mean an "us" situation or a "you" situation? Don't tell me they changed their minds about us getting married. If that is the case, then you can orb me up there right now... Babbling. It has nothing to do with them. It has to do with me. I sort of, kind of, lost the wedding ring. Got a great ring guy downtown if you need one. He doesn't need one. He has a ring, Mom's ring. I gave it to him so he could give it back to me at the perfect romantic moment. Wow, Leo, you lost Mom's ring. It's a good thing you're dead already. I had it in my pocket, Piper. And all the orbing in and out and... Your orbs are grass if you do not find that ring. All right, hi. Before blood is spilled, can I just ask a business question? Is it possible to turn a human into a demon? Well, there's rumours. Stories about demons recruiting humans. So "join the evil and see the underworld"? Kind of. Apparently the demons go after humans in need and strike your classic Faustian deal. But then the humans are forced into this training academy, a program that destroys their humanity. And turns them into demons. Right, and when the recruits graduate, they have to kill an innocent to seal the demonic conversion permanently. Yeah, it's like a gang initiation. You go out and kill the first person that you see, and you're in the gang. Well, that explains your four random killings. Maybe it's graduation time at the academy. Well, if it is, Tom is one human that they're not going to demonise. Prue, how do you know we're not too late? If we didn't get there on time and stop him... He would have killed an innocent. It would've been too late. But we did stop him, so now we still have time to save him. I'm gonna go talk to Tom's mother, see if she knows anything. Maybe you guys can come up with, like, a spell to find him or something. Mr. Kellman, I swear, I can make this right. I swear it. I was clear, wasn't I? I make your problems go away and you owe me. Now, did you forget about the last part of the deal? I can pay you back, okay? I just need more time. More time? You don't have any more time. Your debt is due and payable now. Please. I'll do anything. Oh, yes, you will. I don't have to go over all of this again with you too, Tom, do I? Temporary setback. It won't happen again. You know, you're not the only one exposed here. You got a contract with me, and I got a contract with The Source, five full graduates by tomorrow night. Now, all the others have made their kills. What's the problem? - A witch intervened. - What? A witch? - How the hell did that happen? - I don't know. But I wasn't followed. I used every safeguard I learned in the academy. Well, she must be tracking the innocents. We'll have to get you another one. But we're running out of time here. Just kill this one. But do it fast. Or else there'll be hell to pay. - Phoebe. - I don't want to talk about it. You have to tell them. You can't wait any longer. Well, it's not really an easy thing to drop into conversation. You know, like, "Your hair looks great. Cole's not dead. I let him go." Confession is good for the soul. Yeah, well how about we skip the confession part and go straight to penance, okay? I will be such a force for good, the bad guys won't know what hit them. You can't pretend it didn't happen, Phoebe. Yeah, and I can't change the fact that it did, Leo. So if you will excuse me, I have a demon to vanquish. And you have a ring to find. Scrying for witches, a spell to find a lost love. But there's nothing in here about how to find a demon. Oh, well, probably because they usually find us. - Well, there's gotta be a way. - If there is, Prue will have to find it. Was there anything in there, you know, to help Leo find my ring? We can't just give up. We have to find this demon before he kills somebody. Okay, well, do you got a spell? Maybe. I'm afraid to ask. Just something that I thought that I needed and then decided that I didn't. Okay. It's a lost-and-found spell. Wow, perfect timing. Do I want to know what you were trying to find? - Cole. - Cole? Honey, you were trying to bring a demon back from the dead? No. He's still alive. - I never really vanquished him. - I'm sorry... It's over. He's not coming back, and I don't want him to either. Phoebe, you... You let him go? Are you out of your mind? He's not after us anymore. He won't hurt us. - No, you don't know that. - Yes, I do. Piper, I just... I couldn't kill him. Phoebe, you lied to us. I know. I'm sorry. So this is where this new Wonder Woman attitude comes from? - A guilty conscience? - No. Well, maybe. I don't know. You have to tell Prue. - She won't understand. - Yeah, well, she's not the only one. He was so fast. His coach said he could have run track too. But all Tom cares about is football. I'm so sorry that we lost touch, but... ...what happened after he got hurt? - He was depressed. I understood. So the stories I heard about his being in trouble? The gambling rumours? Don't believe a word of it. No one ever came to me looking for money. Mr. Kellman would've told me if there was a problem. - Mr. Kellman? - His business manager. He took such good care of Tom. And he was a wonderful help to me after Tom went away. Mrs. Peters, what do you think happened? I think Tom has some things to take care of. And he'll be home when he can. I know it in my heart. My son's a good man. Guiding spirits, I ask your charity Lend me your focus and clarity Lead me to the one I cannot find Restore that and my peace of mind Hey, what's all this? Oh, we're just looking for Tom, you know, with a little spell that we created. You created. Wow, you came up with the whole ritual that fast? Actually, not as fast as you would think. Thank you. I really appreciate you guys doing this for me. She didn't exactly do it for you. Okay. So, what did Tom's mother say? Poor lady. She talks about him like he's been gone a week, as opposed to six years. And she actually thinks he's coming back. - Based on? - Faith, and I'd like to prove her right. Well, we're doing everything we can. Yeah, and you know what, we have saved bad boys before. What about the priest with the warlock brothers? Yeah, but, Prue, he wanted to be saved. Can you guarantee that about Tom? Or any other demon-human mix? This is not about Cole, okay. That's a whole other subject. - One worth discussing. - Am I missing something here? - Yeah. - Yes, actually. We're missing Tom. And he's someone we should probably continue talking about. So if this spell works and we actually find him, what do we do? Do we vanquish him? Well, I'm hoping that it won't come to that. Yeah, but what if it does, Prue? - What was that? - You changing the subject. All right, since when did they start delivering newspapers in the afternoon? Since they started taking out all the pictures. It's a pretty cool spell, if I do say so myself. Yeah, except what is it telling us? Oh, that Claudia Gibson will discuss the mayor's position on Net News Live today at 2:00, which is ten minutes ago. - Our next innocent? - Yes, and Tom's next victim. - The keys. - Thanks, come on. Jacket. Well, we didn't bring a vanquish, but if we throw him into the street, - that might do the trick. - We are not gonna vanquish him. - Prue, he almost killed that woman. - Almost, but didn't. All right, we need to get him home. Wha...? Our home? You're voluntarily bringing a demon back to our home? - Did you find anything yet? - Not yet. Well, while we're waiting, this would be a good time to discuss something. - Oh, phone. Piper will get it. - Nope. Machine, remember? - Leo was right. - About what? About the demonic training academy. It's right here in the Book. - Really? - "A brutal training program which destroys humanity and renders the subject demonic." All right, so if Tom is completely demonic, he'll have a brand on his arm with six chevrons. He's only got five. Good. That means he's not fully converted. We better vanquish him while we can. You know, when Cole was the hybrid in question, - you were all about saving him. - Excellent point. - Yes, well, I learned from my mistake. - And which mistake was that? Believing that I could save a demon. Well, like I said before, this is different. Tom, look at me. Do you remember me from college? Does that mean he remembers you or that he doesn't? - What is going on down there? - Why don't you guys go and find out. - And leave you alone with him? - I can handle him. It's okay. - Got Tom's file. - We got Tom. Rasputin, get off of the... Get. - Rasputin? - You got a dog? No, that's our gram's dog. And he's been lost for... Seven years, Phoebe. Okay, so there's one small side effect. We can handle that. Why is the answering machine not picking up? I cast a little spell. The less I know, the happier I am. Hello? An old friend of Prue's. Okay. Let me get a pencil. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Call back again soon. What is it? What did you find? Lost friends, Mom's ring. And your brown hair. Oh, yeah. I did not want my brown hair back. I wanted to keep that lost. You were a blond when you answered the door. - How did it change? - Well, it must be because I coloured my hair in that sink. So technically I lost it there, and now I found it again. I hope this doesn't affect my virginity. Wait, so everything is coming back to where it was lost? That means you lost your... Okay, so it's a big side effect. Those better be clean. If not, it's laundry day for you, missy. You don't scare me. I've been trained to deal with witches. I'd forgotten how proud you were when we knew each other. I've forgotten you completely. You don't want to tell me what happened because you won't admit how badly you screwed up. I didn't. It's obvious. While you were still human, you were stupid enough - to enter into some demonic contract. - I was never human. You had to have been. Otherwise you wouldn't have made it to the academy. Yes, I know about the academy. I know about the chevrons. I also know that you haven't killed your innocent yet. I will. You'll have to get past me first. Kellman will kill us both if I don't. Kellman? Tom, I know who you are, the person that you were, all right? And I know that somewhere in there, it still exists. Look, Tom, this is who you are, all right? This is who your mother is waiting for. Vanquish me... ...or I will kill you, witch. Neither is going to happen, all right? I'm going to save you from yourself, whether you like it or not. Okay, so I think I have an idea for... Whoa. Yeah, my lost-and-found spell's a little too enthusiastic. We're finding stuff all over the house. It's endless. I don't mean to sound paranoid, but after all these years, I think I've earned that right. How do you know your spell won't find demons you've already vanquished? - Oh, you mean like Belthazor? - Okay, one demon at a time. - Did you get anything on Tom? - Just his missing person's file. All right, anything on a man named Kellman? - What was that? - That would be Tom escaping. - What? - Yeah, I loosened his ropes. I'm hoping to track him down to the demon that turned him. Break him, break his hold on Tom. Anything you can get me on Kellman, I'd appreciate, okay? - All right, I guess we're going now. - Shouldn't we reverse this spell first? - All right, you ready? - Ready for what? To save him. - Where did he go? - It doesn't make any sense. If he could vanish, he would've done it before. I got a bad feeling about this. It's not just about strength. Identify the primary weakness, capitalise on it, zero in and crush him. I have good news, Mr. Kellman. - You killed the innocent. - Better. I can deliver you three witches. Witches? I don't care about witches. I care about deadlines! Yours and mine. You know, if I weren't running out of time, I'd have you... Is that humanity I'm sensing from you? Now, how did that come back? That was supposed to be drummed out of you by now. You need a refresher course. This is weird. So Kellman poses as a human, and then what, gives athletes a way out of their problems? Yeah, a demonic way out. What about your lost-and-found spell? Do you think that you could rewrite it to find Tom? Maybe. How about: Show me the path that I cannot find To save Tom And restore Prue's peace of mind Way to go, Pheebs. No, wait. I want him to watch. - Oh, yeah. - Come here. You want your mama? Say it. You want your mama? Remind me again why we are doing this. Because your sisters have a thing for saving bad boys. If I die before I get married, I'm gonna be really mad at the two of you. Oh, God. Okay, I'd still like to point out that I have a really bad feeling about this. - What the...? - Oh, no. I'm the man. Next! Tom. Okay. - Tom. - Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you nuts? Come on, Tommy. Maybe we need to go back up top and rethink this whole thing. You know, that would be a great plan if Tom weren't seconds away from annihilation. Okay, so we're supposed to risk our lives to save a demon? Of course, it's okay now that it's your demon, right? The thing is, isn't it silly for the three of us to sacrifice ourselves for one guy? Whatever kind of guy he was? That's what a demon is, little man! All right, what kind of witches would we be if we started playing the odds, if we started picking and choosing our innocents? This is what we do, isn't it? - Then let's do it. - Okay. - But... - Just go. Tom! Your little parlour tricks may work on some of the newer boys, but the rest of us will be a little tougher. Man, you can't do that around here. I can't sense the girls anywhere, which is never good. Do you know where they might be? They were tailing their demon, hoping he would lead them to his... ...bigger demon. - Do they know who that is? Prue asked me to check on a manager named Kellman. He paid all of Tom's bills after he disappeared, but... He could be a recruiter. Do you have an address? You think Kellman's a demon? Well, what kind of powers do you think we should expect? Oh, see, okay. Now, that ain't right. You girls are way out of your league down here. You have no idea. Well, we know that you have a deadline, Mr. Kellman. Time to deliver your recruits? And you think you can stop me, huh? Think you can save him? I kind of admire that level of arrogance. Thanks. We kind of like to think of it as confidence. Well, get over it. He's lost. I made a deal. I stand by it. Now, you see that? Now that's what I call a quick recovery. Knocked the humanity right out of him. And we got a perfect kill for him too. Not if we put him on ice. Kind of hard to make him kill an innocent now, huh? - Unfreeze him. - Nope. If anything happens to me, he's gonna stay that way. - Is that true? - Yes. - You're bluffing. - Are we? I'm listening. All right. How about three witches in exchange for Tom's soul? - Prue. - If we win, we get Tom back. If we lose, you get Tom and the three of us. Risk one to gain four. You really think you can win in the ring? Well, we don't really have much of a choice. But if we do win, we don't go into the training program, we go free. Did your homework. Okay, you got a deal. You win, you go free. But if you lose... ...you die. I can't control what happens in the ring, only The Source can. Understood. Hey. You know that bad feeling I was talking about? It's getting stronger. All right, you need to stay here and keep Tom frozen. I hate this crappy freezing power! Our powers seem to have a limited effect on these guys, so we're gonna outmanoeuvre them. And outsmart them and keep our shoulders off the mat. Piece of cake. So I guess we're as ready as we're ever gonna be. - Prue, there's one more thing. - Now? - Now is your perfect moment? - Piper, we might die in there. That doesn't mean you should tell her now. Okay, tell me what? Cole is still alive. - I never really vanquished him. - What? By the way, since you're witches, I think it's only fair that I even the playing field. Look at this face! This is the face of pain! And I'm the bringer of pain! And I'm gonna destroy you! You'll be crying for mercy! But I don't know the meaning of the word! All right. People think this is entertainment. Prue. - Are we okay? - Not by a long shot. Look, Phoebe, if you waited till now to tell me about Cole in hopes that we would die and you wouldn't have to deal with me, you have another thing coming. I think that went well. All right, I'm going to win this fight and save your ass. That way I can kick it myself later. Hi. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Wow! Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God! Come on, do something, get angry! Focus, get motivated! Prue, listen to me. She lied to you. Bigtime! Bigtime lying to you! Come on, get angry! Come on. Or else we're in big, deep... Phoebe, she thinks you're a weakling, like, bigtime sucker for love. Oh, God! Piper! - Called your bluff. - Piper! Let's go see how Mom's doing, shall we? Slammer. Yeah, baby. Say good night! Prue! Prue! - Thank you! - All right, we have to save Piper. - How do we do that? - By kicking ass. All right. One. Two. Three. - Anybody else want a piece of this? - It looks really bad. - I don't know if we'll make it to Leo. - Yeah, we will. Come on. - Leo! - What happened? Hurry, I think she stopped breathing. It's working. Okay, not that I'm not thrilled to see you, but what are you doing here, Leo? I was looking for you. I thought I'd start with Kellman. - He's the recruiter. - I figured. The Elders think the key to destroying him is to turn one of his recruits against him. So first we have to figure out a way to save Tom. All right, so I'll call Morris, get him to bring Tom's mom to the manor. Then we just have to figure out a way to get Tom there. You want them in the same house? Yeah, she's gotta be the key to saving him. Otherwise, why would Kellman want Tom to kill her? Okay, well, maybe I can figure out a way to tweak the lost-and-found spell again. Lure him to the house. After all, Tom's a lost soul, right? - Is she gonna be okay? - Yeah. Go, I'll take of Piper. - You sure? - Yeah. Maybe we should talk about this first. We'll have to figure out how to take out Kellman on the way. - That's not what I mean. - Now's not really the time, Phoebe. Prue, what if we don't have any other time? Look, we may not be able to defeat Kellman. - We could lose. - We won't lose. How do you know that, Prue? All you want to do is save Tom, which is all I wanted to do for Cole. Okay, Phoebe, don't try and turn this around on me. I'm not the one who kept secrets from you. Prue, I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't understand. - You hated Cole. - No, I didn't trust him, and I was right. - You never gave him a chance. - He didn't deserve a chance. Oh, and what makes Tom deserve a chance? He started out good, he didn't start out trying to kill us. Can we talk about this later? Hey. Guess what? I found Mom's ring. Mrs. Peters? Inspector Morris, San Francisco P.D. Tom? What was that? What are those noises? I'm not quite sure. Thanks for coming, Mrs. Peters. - But I don't understand. - You will soon. Any sign of Kellman? No, but there are plenty of other signs. Seems like some lost souls were found. Yeah, we need to reverse the spell quick. Where's Tom? - Tom! - No! - How did you? - Because we're not done with you yet. I told you it was too late to save Tom. But thank you for leading us to the victim. Kill her, Tom. All right, Tom, listen to me. Look at your mother. All right, remember what it felt like to be human. Remember what it feels like to be loved. Prue, we're about to have other problems from other worlds. Tom, help me. Kill her, damn it! - What the hell is happening? - I think there are some lost souls welcoming a new friend. Get rid of them. I return what I didn't want to find Let it be out of sight, out of mind Mom. - Mom, I'm so sorry. - Oh, Tommy. It's all right. Everything's all right. I guess some guys are worth saving after all. Isn't that beautiful? Yes, and it's right where it belongs. So is Tom, by the way, at home with his mom. And I got Rasputin back to the family he was living with. So maybe the spell wasn't such a bad thing after all. Are you kidding? We're gonna have to have huge garage sales every Saturday for, like, the next three months to get rid of the stuff that came back. Yeah, and who knows what trouble may be caused if those lost souls had stayed around. Okay, okay, I will fix it. You guys go and have a nice dinner. So now everything's back to normal. - What about your hair? - I'm tempted to keep it. But I don't know, I think the blond's coming back. Is anything else? No. You were right about Tom. And I was wrong about Cole. I'm sorry. And you think that just takes care of it? "I'm sorry"? No, well, obviously an apology doesn't fix it. But I'm not stupid, Prue. I know that I made a bad choice. A choice that betrayed us. I didn't do it to betray you, Prue. I did it out of love. Right. Love. Love that almost got all of us killed. You wanted to save Tom after, I don't know, how many years? Why can't you understand how I felt about Cole? Phoebe, what I don't understand is how you could have lied to us. Piper, me. A lie that still poses
