Paige, there you are. - Anyone got hurt? - Not as far as I can tell. - Have you seen Agent Brody yet? - What are we doing here? He said for us to meet him here. He needed to talk to us about something important. Yeah, but it's a fire. - So? - So we don't do fires. Firemen do fires. We do fireballs. He said it was something connected to this - New Power thing he's talking about. - Well, we're not Brody's Angels. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm stressed. It's my first week back at work, and I have a lot of catching up to do. Follow me. Keep an eye on the third floor. Wait. Why? Somebody's trapped. If I'm right, he's gonna jump and not get hurt. - How do you know? - Just a hunch. Just a hunch, huh, Agent Brody? - Kyle. - Whatever. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but we don't really know you. I know you were right about the New Power thing, but... On the ledge, third floor! Jumper! Come on, bring it down! Hey, get the ladder over here! Let me protect you. Are you all right? Come on. Whoa. Okay, how did you know that? That's the fourth person it's happened to in the last month. If the pattern holds, he's about to die. - Pattern? What pattern? - What? All right, guys, stay on the survivor. - Keep recording! - Copy that. Oh, God, is he talking to that helicopter? He's really cool. Yes, ma'am. I understand that. I'm okay. The EMT needs to check you out first. Down there. Sir! No... Stop. Watch for the... - Who are you? - A thief. Looks like you're on your own. No, no, no, wait! Damn it! Ten-four, we'll update it. Agent 250 at dispatch. We need you to return... Yeah. Well, take care of it. I still don't understand how he knew this was gonna happen. I wanna know why we couldn't stop it. Stop what? A man jumped out of a burning building only to get hit by a truck? - What's the connection there? - I'm hoping Kyle knows. Okay, you know, can we call him Agent Brody until we can trust him? I trust him. - Are you okay? - No. I just wish I knew why this keeps happening. - Something about a pattern? - Every time something unusual happens, I investigate. The more unusual, the more it tends to lead towards this New Power. - This New Power have a name? - Don't know. Wanna walk? You think that whole thing's what's killing these innocents? I don't think they're literally running them down. I do think that they're doing something to cause them to be killed. - What kind of something? - I don't know. Whatever it is, it's got to do with taking power. - It's what they're all about. - Powers? Innocents don't have powers. If they did, they wouldn't need us. All I know is things this unusual don't just happen over and over. - Something's going on. - Another hunch? Don't knock 'em, Phoebe. My hunches led me to you. Look, I can guarantee you this is not gonna be the last person to miraculously escape a fire, only to die moments later. If you guys wanna help me figure this one out... ...you know where to find me. What do you think? I think he's got some style. How dare you summon me. You said to call if I ever wanted to challenge you. You think you are ready to challenge me? The last time you tried it, I spared your life. This time I may not be so merciful. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. You've been around humans too long. What makes you think you're ready? Like you said, I've been around humans. Shall we? Talk to me. You've come far... quickly. Not far enough. I need more! - More what? - More guardians. I steal the ones who help save their humans so that they can help me instead. - All this just to defeat me? - No. So I can protect myself from the threat you taught us was coming. Nothing can protect you from that. - Unless you go into hiding until... - I won't hide! If demons don't stand up to them, who will? I just need more. Could you do me a favour? Call Rex and have them do a sound check before the show. I don't wanna mess up The Donna's release party. - It's gonna be packed. - Are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah, Brody, fires, hunches. I got my own problems. - Are you sure Enola graduated already? - Yeah, I'm positive. Why? - She might be the one who can save Leo. - What are you talking about? She helped you see your future with a vision quest. Gave you something to look forward to. Life after demons. - That's what Leo needs. - There's no guarantees Leo would see that. A vision quest can take you anywhere, and sometimes it can be dangerous. Couldn't be more dangerous than what he's going through now, if that New Power is still after him. A vision quest won't change that. No, but it may show him a way to fight them. Phoebe, he's alone, and he's scared, and he's forgotten who he is. I'm afraid if I can't help him, my children are gonna lose their father. - It's still risky. - But it's a risk I'm willing to take. What are you doing? I'm making the vision quest potion. She showed me how to do it. - What about Brody? - Paige can take care of Brody. I think she likes taking care of Brody, if you know what I'm talking about. And besides, this... is family. Nobody's home. You're quite the liar. Sorry. I didn't realise it was you. Actually, I'm surprised you even showed up. Really? Why would that be? It's pretty clear your sister doesn't trust me very much. - Should she? - I think she should. I've proven myself. I've saved you from getting exposed more than once. By the way, where is Inspector Sheridan? Come on, does it really matter? It does if you hurt her. I'm not here to hurt anybody, Paige. I'm here to keep them from getting hurt. The fact that you know that people may die is exactly what makes you so suspicious, Agent Brody. Kyle. What is that? That is a bird's-eye view of the victim just before he stepped off the kerb. We shot this with the fastest digital imaging equipment known to man. Or at least Homeland Security. If you look at it in normal light, it appears as though he's alone. Throw an EM filter on it... ...he's not. What are those? If I had to guess, I'd say the light one's a protector of some kind. Protector? Like some sort of guardian angel thing? That's one way of putting it. - What, you don't believe in them? - You do? Given all the scrapes that I've slipped out of, it's the only reason I think I'm still alive. My guess is... ...that's the power the dark figure wants. People have especially strong protectors. It'd explain why they miraculously survive something and, the next moment, don't. - What? - Nothing. So... How do we find out if that dark figure is what you think it is? We wait for the next fire. Interested? There's nowhere else to turn. - Nowhere else to go. - Leave me alone! Let go of all you know. Don't resist. Don't resist us. Why are you doing this to me? What do you want? - Perhaps we've pushed him too far. - We have no choice. He must join us willingly. But first must see there's no other option. - His will is strong, even for an Elder. - Which is why he's so valuable to us. What is it? There may be another way. Another opportunity to show him that one cannot ignore the truth forever. Leo? Leo? You see, I know he can hear me. He just doesn't wanna come. Let me give this a try. Leo! Leo, you get your butt down here right now, or we will summon your ass! Nicely done. It's not safe for me to be here, you know. - We'll take that risk. - What about the boys? At school. Nice try though. - We found a way to help you. - Help me what? - Help you stop running. - It's a vision quest. A vision quest? No way. Leo, don't you dare leave. This is not just about you. You are a father and somebody's husband. Which is why it's risky for me to be here. Except you're the one in danger. I'm an Elder. I can take care of myself. Actually, you haven't been yourself lately. The vision quest helped me. - Maybe it could help you too. - It won't stop the creatures. How do you know? You tried everything else. What do you have to lose? Your mind, your family, your life. You've already lost those, haven't you? Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong. I'll go get the potion. Okay, when I said I'd help you, this is not what I had in mind. - Just go. I'll be okay. - You crazy? How's this gonna be okay? I believe in my guardians. If I'm right, whoever set this fire is out there. Say your spell, and we'll see what happens. - Don't worry about me. - It's a little late for that. Which way? Trust us. You all right? - It's all right. Homeland Security. - You sure? Paige? Paige! Come on... Show me what the evil sees even if at lightning speed - So it is true. - Well, well, well. What have we here... a witch? You're not getting his guardian. Now why would I want his, when I can have yours? What's the matter? What's wrong? I think I'm in big trouble. No, I know, Elise, but something came up. Yes, again, but you don't have to worry about my column. I promise it'll... I gotta go. Wha...? Paige? What's going on? Pa... Oh, my God, what happened? - Par for the course, unfortunately. - Par for what course? - What are you doing here? - Trying to protect your sister. - I lost my guardian angel. - You lost your who? Protection spirits, guides. They're with us all the time. I know what guardian angels are. Not just the Hallmark thing. It's real. I saw mine. - Surprised we'd not seen them before. - The problem is, without them, - people tend to be vulnerable. - In my case, accident-prone. I don't understand. How did you lose your guardian angel? We were trying to lose mine, - but then this demon... Demon, right? - Demon. Demon comes along and takes hers instead. Can I talk to you for a second, please, over here? What is going on? We figured out what is killing all of those innocents. The demon's stealing their protectors. It's connected to this New Power thing. - This is another of his hunches? - No, it's one of mine. But you have to admit, all of his have panned out so far, right? Yeah, so far they have. So what's the next move? I'm gonna ID the demon. Seen the Book of Shadows? - It wasn't upstairs. - You're not gonna show him the Book? Yeah, I am. I trust him. I told you that. Look, if it considers him a threat, it'll just zap him. Don't worry. Paige, you're my sister. I have to worry. Well, if it makes you feel better, come with us. I wish I could, but I can't. Leo needs some serious help. - What's new? - Promise me you're gonna be careful. Promise. I think I can take care of one little demon. I meant Agent Brody. The Book's in the kitchen. Everything okay? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. - No problem. - Yeah... - She lost her what? - Brody's watching her. She's okay. We can't leave her alone if she lost... Phoebe said she's fine. Now, please focus. - What am I supposed to do? - Don't fight it. Let it take you where you're supposed to be. - What if I want out? - You won't be able to. Not until you see what you're supposed to see. Just sip it. - Now what? - Make yourself comfortable. Close your eyes and just let it all go. Wyatt! We've gotta stop the bleeding. He's going into shock. I need a morphine kit! Is there a medic out in the field? What's going on? What am I doing here? Don't worry, Dad. I'm gonna help you through this. Chris? Chris? - Thank you. - Yeah. Guess I never knew how much my guardian angel actually helped me, - even with the little stuff. - Don't worry, we'll find her. I hope. You know, maybe it'd help if you looked at the Book with me. - Feel better? - What do you mean? I assume the Book won't let anything evil touch it. Most magical tomes don't. What do I have to do to prove I'm not a threat to you? Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I am. I can't seem to trust myself right now, let alone anybody else. Well, guardians do more than keep you upright. I mean, they're your inner voice, your conscience, instincts. And without them, you tend to get a little lost. You really do believe in them, don't you? Yeah. I'm a believer, all right. Hunting the New Power for years has made me realise there's some awful things in this world. I'd just like to think there's some good things too, to balance it out. Like you. You found it! "Celerity demons are powerful beings who can move at the speed of light and feed off lesser demons." Yeah, but guardian angels are hardly lesser demons. Well, whether they are or they aren't, he's able to steal them. The question is, why? Well done. Witches have powerful guardians... ...especially a Charmed One's. How can you be sure that she was a Charmed One? It's the only explanation. It's the most powerful one I possess. Still, it will not be enough... ...when the Avatars come. Perhaps not. Unless I get the other two. Legend holds the sisters are magically connected. It stands to reason their guardians should be as well. - How will you get them? - I'll just listen to the one I've got. She'll whisper to me when the others need their guardians most. When they're the most vulnerable. You've taught me well, Aku. I hope... well enough. Why isn't he saying anything? Do you think he's all right? Yes, I think he's doing exactly what he needs to be doing. Sure you don't wanna help me out here? No, I'm fine right here. Sweetie, you said it yourself. This is something that he needs to do. I can have second thoughts, can't I? What if something happens to him? Hopefully, his angels are taking care of him. I don't think angels have angels, Phoebe. It's redundant. You just protect ours so we can protect him. I don't understand. If I'm in the past, what are you doing here? I'm guiding you. So you're real? No. But I represent something that is. I died in your arms, Dad. Killed by everything that you thought was good. I'm your root pain, okay? I'm gonna be sticking with you until you're ready to let me go. How will I know when that is? Come on, let's check out parts of your life you really need to remember. Do I have a choice? Hey, it's your vision quest. It's up to you. Come on. Where are we now? I never stopped loving you. That feeling's what it's all about, Dad. You died fighting evil in the war. You were reborn as a Whitelighter to fight evil. That led you to Mom, love, to all that's good. Is that what I think it is? - To the day Wyatt was born. - Yes, it is. - Oh, it's a boy. - I got a boy? - Here you go, Mama. - Hi. Hi, little guy, what are you doing? Look what we did! I see. It's a miracle. A little miracle. To the day when I was born. Oh, look, he's beautiful. Baby Christopher. That's your brother. Looks like we didn't lose him after all. Do you understand now? All the pain, all the sacrifices. It's all been for good. That's what you're all about, Dad. That's what you've always been about. That's what the future's about too. - Look at your brother! - You need to believe in that again. Can we see her? Go. Your family's waiting for you. - Piper... - Hey, how you feeling? Good. What? What is it? Leo. Leo, wake up. Leo! Wake up! Who are you? What do you want? I want you to see the truth, Leo. I want you to see the real future. - We gotta do something. - There's nothing we can do. He's back in the quest. Only he can get himself out. He was out. Something made him go back in. Something he saw. I don't think anything can get past crystals. - The New Power? - I didn't see floating heads. - Doesn't mean they weren't there. - Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me? I wanna get out of here. You can't leave yet, Leo. You're not ready. You haven't seen what you need to see. - Why are you haunting me? - Haunting? No, the creature heads were a necessary part of guiding you to the truth. To the truth that lies beyond good and evil. - To us. - Us? Avatars. We are... ...a power. One that offers a better way. A solution to this. You see, the future Chris failed to mention the death of all the people that you love. Sometimes peaceful... ...sometimes painful... ...but always inevitable. And all well before their time. Death is a part of life. Natural death, yes. But not death caused by the pointless, endless battles between good and evil. It's not pointless, it's necessary. And when good wins... Wins? Duality is self-perpetuating. It feeds only on itself. That is why the battle has been raging since the dawn of time. There is no winner. - There can be. - How? With good there is always evil. And so the battle never ends. Not until there's nothing left. That is the future your fight is leading to. Not good nor evil... ...only nothing. No! - Leo, who are you talking to? - Piper, he can't hear you. Well, he's hearing someone. Leo. Leo! What was that? - Stay here. - Why? Just stay. Guess your guardians didn't tell you about that. That's why I want yours. So these kinds of things don't happen again. - Damn it! - Paige, quick! In here! You're getting to be a pain. - You can't hide in there forever. - Paige? What the hell? Leave him alone! No. There's too much at stake. Besides, I could use the leverage. Oh, no! You're not a witch. What are you? I'm a federal agent. A what? And you know about all this? Magic, demons? I'm getting a quick education. It won't do you much good. I only need you long enough for the witches to attempt a rescue. Since they're otherwise occupied and down a guardian, they won't come all at once. Someone will get left behind. And that's when I'll attack. I'm just curious... ...what do you want with these guardians, if you don't mind me asking? I don't want them. I need them. Worried about the New Power, are we? You know about the Avatars? Avatars? So that's what they're called? Yes, that's what they're called. I won't be cast aside by them when the time comes for them to take power, which is why I need more guardians, which is the only reason I'm keeping you alive. So, what are you gonna do if you find him? What do you mean, "What am I gonna do?" I'm gonna save him. We're gonna save him. It's a trap. The demon said so. - He took him for leverage. - We're gonna let him get killed? He's not gonna kill him, okay? He needs him alive. Yeah, but for how long? Piper, help me out. I'm with Phoebe here. Sarpedon's powerful. He has all those guardians. Yeah, including mine. That's why you're not thinking straight. We can't go after him. It's ridiculous. Yeah? Well, I'm not gonna let him rot. - I'll go get him myself. - Wha? Pa... Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? Pai... Now we know where they are. All we have to do is mix up a new vanquishing potion and get Paige's spell. But that'd mean we'd have to go to the Book, which is in the kitchen, which entails us going downstairs, away from the crystals, which means the demon could slice and dice us. True, but for all we know the demon could already have Paige. Us getting killed doesn't change that. I can't leave Leo. I know this is really hard for you, Piper. But there's nothing that we can do to help Leo. He's gotta fight this fight on his own. But we can help Paige. All right, let's just make it fast. Okay. Remember, if the demon attacks, grab the amulet. Oh, sure, yeah, no problem. Phoebe! Next. Hey! Where's your amulet? No! Leo! What do you mean, this is the end? The end of what? The end of the battle between good and evil. Its outcome. Mutual destruction. And the eternal void that necessarily follows. How is this possible? I'm afraid it's unavoidable. A... flawed design. There is, however, another way. A better way. That is what we represent, Leo. But we'll need your help to implement. And the Charmed Ones, of course, when they're ready. What way is that? Utopia. A world where good and evil no longer exist. Where the battle is behind you, behind everyone. A world where you and Piper no longer have to suffer through the obstacles that have kept you apart. What's the catch? Only the courage to change. Unless it's already too late. Piper. She's not here, Leo. I'm afraid there isn't much time. Piper! Piper! No. Why did you do this? We didn't do this, Leo. Evil did. It might not be too late, though, to reverse it. If you'll join us. You can save them? We can save everyone, Leo. With your help. So be it. Welcome to the fold. What do I do next? Heal them. I can't heal them. They're dead. You're an Avatar now, Leo. You have all you need. You have the powers. Leo? - Piper. - You're back. - I thought I was... - Dead? - Where did you get that? - From the demon, I guess. Wait, so that's it? It's over? Is it? I've never seen you heal anyone like that, Leo. - Did something happen to you? - What do you mean? In the vision quest, you seemed like you were in pain. Yeah, well, something I had to go through, I guess... ...to see the truth. Give it up for San Francisco's very own, The Donnas! Thanks for getting Rex to do that sound check. - They sounded great. - Actually, I forgot to do that. What? I was very busy trying to save your husband. Down, girl. Easy. Don't worry about it. I guess I get a little testy when someone kills me, you know. Oh, come on, we weren't killed. We were just maimed. Leo can't heal the dead. Hey, ladies. Sorry I'm late. You guys look great for being recently deceased. We weren't dead! Forget it. Oh, hey! Sorry! God, I'm sorry, my bad. I see you got your angel back. Thank God. No pun intended. - What about Agent Brody? - Who? All right, Kyle. Just 'cause we almost got him killed doesn't mean we have to trust him. Oh, come on, now. Enough of this already. Everything turned out fine, like it always does. Well, almost always does. Except for the Avatars. Kyle said that that's what the demon called the New Power. Doesn't ring any bells. Well, well, well, look at you. Welcome back. Thank you. It's good to be back, believe me. No voices, floating heads, guilt trips? Nope, nothing. You ever hear of the Avatars? Avatars? Why? They could be the big bad everyone's worried about. I will look into it. But first,
