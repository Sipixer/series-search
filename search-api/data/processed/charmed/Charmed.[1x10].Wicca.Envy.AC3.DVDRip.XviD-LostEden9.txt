all about, pushing the limits. Yeah, and stretching the budget. Maybe I should just check with Piper. Oh, my God, Prue... I'm so embarrassed. Of course, she might have other things on her mind, like having her way with the handyman. - I thought you guys were shopping. - Obviously. Oh, look, front-clasp bra. She means business. - Serious business. - Do you mind? No, are you kidding? I think it's great, as long as he's not still on the clock. You guys have to get out of here before he unfreezes. I never know how long this thing lasts. - How much did you guys spend? - Lots. Prue's new look is perfect for an SHW. - SHW? - Single hot witch. Prue, are you sure this isn't depression buying? You know, post-breakup? Does this look like something a depressed woman would wear? - Maybe you should borrow it. - Okay, time's up. You two gotta go. Go on. Go in there and be quiet. We will if you will. Kit, what is it? You forgot to unpack your briefcase when you got home from work. And you want to do it right now. What you're about to pick up is a tiara, but you really believe it's your date book. Now put it in the desk, just like you always do. Excellent. Now you want to continue getting ready for bed. Well? Prue did exactly as I told her to. You know, I rather like this new power. - And are you sure she didn't see you? - No, no, she couldn't see me. - No, I was invisible. - But then, how did you get there? I've explained this to you, Hannah. It's called astral projection. With it, I can transport myself psychically and implant a subliminal thought into Prue's brain. Just like I did when I tricked her into leaving the vault today with the tiara. See, I planted the thought that made her think she came out empty-handed. I still don't understand how it works. Watch. You want to disrobe for him. Desperately. Understand now, Hannah? If you ran an employment agency, wouldn't you want me? Maybe, but I'd definitely want my suit back. No, this is part of your old wardrobe. I'm just recycling. - Well, the environment thanks you... - But take it off. Yeah, I know, I know. Hi. Bye. Piper, didn't you have to go in early this morning? Right, that was the plan. I'm running a little late. It just took a little longer to get out of bed this morning than I planned. Okay, bye. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You, Leo, last night. Dish. Well, it was nice. It was... Well, it was wonderful. We just had a few problems. - Problems? - What problems? Well, it's been a while since, you know, I... And I was a little nervous, and I kind of kept freezing him. - Piper, you didn't. - I didn't mean to the first time. Okay, so at what point in the process exactly did you freeze him? - Hello. - I gotta go. - No, no, Piper, we're only teasing you. - Yeah, truth is we're just jealous. Yeah, we're just happy to see you with a great guy finally. I mean, between you and Leo, and Prue, the new, hot Wicca woman, and me, soon to be employed, things are looking up. Don't say that. The moment somebody says that, - everything always goes south. - Unless you freeze him. I couldn't help it. It was so good. Okay, okay, okay, come on. If you're gonna borrow the car, let's go. - Good morning. - Yeah, we heard. - Bye. - Yeah, have a magical day. - What does she mean by that? - Who knows. I'm late for work. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Jaime, hey, what's going on? What happened? - We got robbed last night, Prue. - You're kidding. What was stolen? - The Romanov tiara. - Oh, my God, not the tiara. - Prue. - Rex, hi. Jaime just told me. - Yeah. Hello, nice to see you again. - Hi, Rex. - I'm sorry about what happened. - Yeah, me too. I mean, a loss of this magnitude could severely damage our reputation. Who is gonna consign anything with us...? No, no, no, we just have to get the tiara back before word gets out. I agree. Will you take point on this then? You know, help the police? You're really the only one that I can trust. Sure, but what about you? Yeah, unfortunately, I've got another commitment tonight that I can't get out of. It's some good friends who are giving a concert, and, well, I promised I wouldn't miss it. - Oh, yeah? Who? - The Verve. - Get out! Are you serious? - You know them? Know them? I worship them. "Bittersweet Symphony" - is, like, the best song ever. - Really? I have an idea. Why not join me tonight. Yeah, I'm sure I can rustle up another ticket. Well, you wouldn't mind, would you, Prue? - Of course not. Why would I mind? - Then it's a date. Well, figuratively speaking, of course. - Of course. - Yeah. - Pick you up at 7, all right? - Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks. Oh, look at the time. I gotta get going. Hey, I promise I'll have the car back by noon. Thanks for pitching in, Prue. - Prue. - Andy. - Are you on this case? - Yep. I guess fate keeps throwing us together. - You two know each other. I forgot. - No, you didn't. Well, I suggested that the inspector speak with you since you were the last one to actually see the tiara. If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to call. We'd like to see the security tapes as soon as possible. Oh, yeah, I'm sure Prue can arrange that. Excuse me. - How are you? - Okay. It'd be better if you stopped by the station so we could talk about all this. - One o'clock? - Sure. I can't believe you're taking that little witch to the concert. Rex, that was my ticket. Hannah, kitten. You know I'm only doing it to upset Prue. All the better to frame her and force the sisters to relinquish their powers. How do you know they even can? There is a special spell in The Book of Shadows.</i> When the time comes, they'll use it. Trust me. You put the tiara in the vault before you left. Was anybody else there? The security guard, Jaime. Did he lock up the vault? No, I did. Okay, did you happen to take anything out of the vault when you left? No. Is this an interview or an interrogation? I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get all the facts, that's all. There were no signs of forced entry into the auction house or the vault. So do you think that one of the employees might have stolen it? - Strong possibility. - Someone like me? No, don't be ridiculous. Still, we have to check out everyone's story. Grand larceny's bigtime. Could cost a person 15, 20 years easily. We've got enough for now. We have any questions, we'll give you a call. Well, you know where to reach me. I think I still remember. - What was all that about? - You tell me. Last time you were ready to bust her. Now you think she's Miss Innocent? That was a whole different situation, completely unrelated. Look, I'm not saying she did it, all right? But you have to admit a lot of the arrows are pointing in her direction. It's also this. The security tapes that Prue brought over? One's missing. The one from the vault. You're glowing. Your face, total afterglow. It is not. It's just warm in here. So how much was that tiara worth anyway? Well, I didn't get a chance to have it appraised. We just got it in yesterday. But I would say well over a million dollars. - Did they have any idea who stole it? - Yeah, me. So, what's on the dessert menu? - Hey, how was the concert? - The best. It was amazing. Still recycling, I see. Thanks for taking care of things tonight, Prue. I really appreciate it. Don't you just love that accent? By the way, how'd it go with the police? Oh, well, they think it's an inside job, actually. Do they? How disturbing. Okay, shoptalk later. We're gonna grab a table, okay? Take that one by the window. I'll send Cindy over. - You're welcome to join us, Prue. - No, thanks, I think I'll pass. - She's a big girl, Prue. - Meaning? He's rich, he's stable, he's handsome. We should be happy for her. - I'm thrilled. - Are you jealous? No. No. More like territorial. Okay, I would just like to keep my work world separate from my home world. Is that okay? Good luck. Good morning. - Wow, roses. Who are they for? - Guess. Leo, I need to call you back. Something's about to come up. I'll see you later, okay? Bye. "Phoebe, thank you for a lovely evening. The job is on its way. Rex." Oh, what a sweetheart. Wait, who opened the box? I can't get over how beautiful these are. Can you, Prue? So it must have been quite a night, you know, after the concert. I'll put these in some water. All I did was tell Rex that I was going to the employment agency. He said he'd make a few calls and help me out. So, what's the big problem? Phoebe, really, it's none of my business. It's just... Watch what you say to him, okay? Because there are certain things I don't want my boss to know about me. Andy, what are you doing here? We're here to search your house for the tiara, Prue. We've got a search warrant. Wait, how can you guys even think that Prue stole the tiara? We don't, Phoebe. Not necessarily. Then what are you doing here, spring cleaning? Any idea where the vault security camera tape is? - I gave you the tapes. - Not that one. It wasn't there, Prue. Why did you do that? That's why. No, no, no, wait. That is not possible. How did it get there? I don't know. You better come up with an answer before they unfreeze. - Someone must've planted it. - Somebody's been in our house? It doesn't matter. Just let them find it. I have nothing to hide. I'm innocent. That doesn't look very innocent. Piper, hide it. You think you should check under the pillows. Morris, check under the pillows. How did he know to look there? Put it in the dresser. He's already looked there. You want to look in the dresser again. - This is getting ridiculous. - This is getting ridiculous. No, eerie is more like it. I will be right back. Don't worry, I'll just keep freezing them until they give up. You're a miserable witch. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I feel like calling a shrink for some reason. Okay, I put it in the... Attic, attic. Nothing. I think that's good enough for now, Morris. I'm sorry about all this, Prue. I really am. - Yeah, I know. - Come on, Trudeau. Let's go. Witches. - Well, did the police find the tiara? - No. Piper kept freezing them, then moving it. Well, how can we frame her if they can't even find the evidence? We're gonna have to up the stakes. Somebody is obviously trying to set me up, and they're using magic to do it. - But who? And how? - Pick a warlock, any warlock. Hey, what were the police doing here? Oh, nothing much really. Is it all right if I go up and fix the bathroom sink? Oh, knock yourself out, Leo. Did anyone ever think that maybe he's a warlock? Why is it always someone I'm dating that gets accused of being that? Don't answer that. Answer that, it's safer. Hello. Oh, yeah. Hi, Rex. Look, I'm on my way in. It's... Of course. Hold on. It's for you. Hello. Yes, I got the flowers, and they're beautiful. That was so sweet of you. They made quite an impression over here too. A dinner party? Yes, I would love to. Hold on, let me grab a pen. - So, what are you gonna do? - What can I do? My sister's dating my boss. I don't really have a... I meant about who's setting you up. Do you have any idea who it could be? It's gotta be somebody at the auction house. If I had to guess, I'd start with the person who said that they were out to destroy me. Hannah? Smart girl. Leo, what are you doing? I thought you were going to fix the sink. Yeah, I was. I mean, I am. I just... I need to fix a light downstairs, and I was hoping there'd be some old fixtures up here, you know, that I could cannibalise. Listen, there's something I need to tell you. Something I don't think you're gonna like. I might have to leave here soon. I might have to go back home. - Is home far away? - Yeah, it's pretty far. I mean, I don't know for sure yet, but, you know, I wanted you to know just in case. Thanks. Well, I better get to work. You will see a spectacular apartment. Phoebe, I am so glad that you could make it. Please. - Wow, this is... - Spectacular? That is exactly the word I was gonna use. We must be on the same wavelength. - Champagne? - No, thank you. No, I insist. - Am I early? - No, you're right on time. But I thought you said you were having a dinner party. Yes, I am. With a very exclusive guest list. Just you and me. A toast. - To your interview. - Interview? Yeah, at Zeitgeist magazine. They want to meet with you, you know, perhaps hire you for the fashion section. - Interested? - Very. - But what's the catch? - You have to sleep with me. Phoebe, what sort of man do you think I am? I hope you like sushi. Imported fresh from Kyöto. Please, just make yourself comfortable. You're having a premonition of Prue at work. She's in danger. You fear a warlock's after her.</i> You must save her. Prue. I gotta go. I'm really sorry, and I can't explain, but I'll call you, okay? Sorry. I'm really sorry. 911? I'm calling from Buckland's Auction House. I think someone's trying to kill me. Please hurry. Working late? Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. I guess I'm just a little jumpy lately. Can't blame you, with everything that's been going on. Yeah. Listen, Jaime, I was wondering, when the tiara was stolen, was anyone else still here, like Hannah or Rex maybe? No, you were the last one out. Just like tonight. Hardest-working woman I've ever met. For what it's worth, Prue, I know you didn't take it. I mean, of all people... There's no way. Thanks. Hannah's computer. Someone's after you. Behind you. You fear it's a warlock with powers greater than yours. You hear a scream. An innocent to protect in the warehouse. - Jaime. - Grab the artefact just inside the door. Jaime. Jaime. Prue! - Phoebe. - Thank God you're all right. He's dead. The tape found by the body? Security. Showing Prue exiting the vault, putting the missing tiara in her briefcase. - What? That can't be. - Just saw it for myself. Somebody must've manipulated me into taking it. The same way someone manipulated me into being a witness against my own sister. - Any idea what they're talking about? - Not a clue. You were with Rex tonight, weren't you? Yeah, Prue, but I don't think this is the time or place to get into that. No, I just meant that don't you find it a little coincidental that right when you guys start dating, all this is going on? No. And besides, I thought you thought that Hannah was behind all of this. - I do. - Excuse us. Ladies. Do you mind if we ask a few questions? I already told you what happened, okay? I was working late, I heard a noise, I came down here and found Jaime. - You didn't know he had the tape? - No, of course not. And why exactly did you pick up the murder weapon again? - You think she killed him, is that it? - Phoebe. No, I wanna know how far he's gonna go with this. None of this has anything to do with the fact that she dumped you, does it? - Stop it. - Look, we got Prue standing over the body of the security guard who last saw her with the tiara. With the missing security tape showing her taking it. And holding the murder weapon, which you were there to witness. - What are we supposed to think? - That I'm guilty as hell. You know she didn't do this. Then who did? Did you see anybody run past you on the way in here? No. - I'm sorry, Prue. Brian. - Yeah? You're under arrest for suspicion of murder. - We should hire a lawyer. - With what money? I don't know, but we can't let her sit in jail all night. That's why we're here, to get Rex's help. What are you doing? This is so weird. Are you sure this is the right place? This is my lipstick. I'm positive. He couldn't have moved out so fast. It must've been an illusion. All of it. - Even my premonition. - How is that possible? Mind control, astral projection, throwing charms. Who knows? Prue was right about Rex, which means I'm dating a warlock. Been there, done that. Hey. Hey. Hey. - You wanna talk? - I'm just running background checks on all the other employees at the auction house. - That's not what I meant, Andy. - Andy? Did you call me by my first name? Wasn't even sure you knew it. I heard Prue say it. She didn't do it, Morris. - You keep saying that. - It's too pat, it's too easy. The evidence just keeps falling in our laps. Maybe her sister was right. Maybe your personal feelings are getting in the way. - We've had that conversation, okay? - Okay. But you stopped seeing Prue for a reason. You thought she was hiding something from you. How do you know she wasn't hiding something like this? A secret life of crime? - I don't think so. - You got a better explanation? You wanna book her into county jail? No, let's just keep her here for as long as we can. At least until the arraignment. - What are you doing? - Getting rid of the evidence. They can't bust Prue for murder if they don't have a motive. - Mouth, Leo's in the kitchen. - Oh, he is? Really? Focus. And think. The last thing we have to worry about is the legal system. We're up against a warlock now. Two, if Prue's right about Hannah. Exactly. Which means we have to figure out what they want. It can't just be to frame Prue. Unless in doing so they think they can get our powers, which is what warlocks want. Which means they're trying to divide us so that we don't have the power of three to stop them. What are we gonna do? We have no choice. - Let's go. - Go? Go where? - Phoebe. - Piper, it's gonna be all right. This is crazy. We have to get Prue out before Rex makes his move on us. - But we can't break her out. - Yes, we can. We're witches. All you have to do is freeze the guards and then unlock Prue's cell. Me? What about you? Somebody's gotta stay out here in case something goes wrong. - Ready? On three. - No, Phoebe. Three. Totally cool power. I hate you. What are you doing? - Are you out of your mind? - Just so we're clear, - this was Phoebe's idea. - What? We think Rex is a warlock, and he's after our powers. Phoebe's waiting outside for you to rub her nose in it. Well, come on, Prue, before they unfreeze. - Piper, this isn't right. - Well, neither is the gas chamber. If we're lucky, we'll vanquish them and get you back here by morning rounds. - That's pretty lame. - You got a better idea? - No. - Let's go. Don't touch them. Don't touch them. Don't! Come on! Come on. Quite photogenic. Now, I should think the police will find this very interesting, to say the least. - Rex. - Wait, how did you know that we...? What, that you'd be here? Well, let's just say that I've been watching your every move. Without your knowing it, of course. You bastard. Don't get too angry, Prue. You really wouldn't want to injure me with your power. I'm the only chance you have. Whilst you were conducting your little prison break, Hannah was retrieving the tiara from your home. You should've gotten rid of it whilst you had the chance. Personally, I actually thought that was an excellent idea. - Astral projection. - What do you want? Your powers, of course. That's why I hired you in the first place. You know, to see if you really were the Charmed Ones. Then I waited, to test your strength, to see how best to make my move. - And here we are. - But why all the drama? Why didn't you just kill us and take our powers? Don't give him any ideas. No, no, no. I have seen exactly what you can do when you've been confronted directly. That is why I opted for blackmail. See, there is a special spell in The Book of Shadows</i> that strips you of your powers forever. And this device will capture those powers. - And you'll bring them to me. - Go to hell. Yeah, I'd love to, darling. I miss it terribly. But this will help me return with honours. In return, I'll give you the photo and tell the police I simply misplaced the tiara. No theft, no motive for murder, no prison. You really don't have much time. Just until the prison guards realize you've escaped. Well? It's a relinquishment spell. If we read it aloud, it takes away all of our powers. - Is there any way to reverse it? - I don't know, it doesn't say. Well, then I say we flip to another page and find a spell that kicks Rex's warlock ass. - We can't. - Why can't we? Because for all we know, he's here right now watching us. And if we don't do exactly as he says, he'll tell the police I've escaped. We can't give up our powers without a fight. It's like giving up who we are, who we've become. - Who we've come from. - Exactly. These powers are gifts. Gifts that were given to us to protect and, ultimately, to pass on to the next generation. Don't you think that I know that? I mean, how do you think I feel? I'm the one who got us into this situation. - Prue, it's not your fault. - It's not. Yeah, but I'm the one that Rex tricked. I'm the reason why we're having this conversation. There has gotta be a way out of this. Like what, become fugitives? Something tells me that's not the best way to protect the innocent. Yeah, well, we can't protect the innocent without our powers. And even worse, if we give them up, we'd be giving them up to evil. No, we can't let that happen. Well, we can't let you die in jail either. Besides, with you behind bars, we'll be divided. Rex wins either way. - I don't wanna have to do this. - Neither do I, but we don't have a choice. All we can do is take the leap of faith and hope that somehow it all works out. "From whence they came Return them now</i> Vanish the words Vanish our powers"</i> "From whence they came Return them now</i> Vanish the words Vanish our powers"</i> Come on, Phoebe. Okay. "From whence they came Return them now</i> Vanish the words Vanish our powers"</i> Look. - Well, it was fun while it lasted. - Yep. Let's get this over with. They're coming. Good. Love you too, darling. Why, Hannah, you've changed. Dead 08/20/98. He died 8/20/98. Mr Morris. Trudeau. Get your butt over here, I think I figured out who framed Prue. Okay, I say as soon as we get the photo and the tiara back, we knock the lantern out of Rex's hands and stomp on it. - What will that do? - I don't know, free our powers? - It's better than doing nothing. - How do we know this isn't a trap? You don't, actually. Nevertheless, here you are. Powerless, I presume. - Where's Hannah? - Lurking. It's what she does best. The lantern, if you please. It all feels a little anticlimactic, don't you think? Too easy almost. Feels as if we need a more satisfying ending. No. Hannah, now. Quickly! - Wait, we have our powers back? - How? Doesn't matter. Get out of here fast. Rex. No. What have you done? But it wasn't my fault. I didn't fail, he did! No! Please, no! What the hell was that? I think you just answered your own question. Okay, well, you gotta get me back to jail now. Let's go. We're here to see Prue Halliwell. - Thanks, Eric. - Thanks a lot. Prue? Andy, what is it? What's going on? Thought you'd like to know you're off the hook. Turns out you were right. Rex and Hannah were setting you up. - Or whoever they were. - I don't understand. Well, we think they killed two people, assumed their identities, then took over the auction house. Then they bilked it dry and tried to cap it off with stealing the tiara. Which we found hidden in his office. Wow, did you catch them? Not yet. I don't suppose you have any idea what this was doing in his office, do you? - Quite photogenic. - Isn't it? Spells, incantations, demon stuff. It's all here. Everything. Just like before. - Thank God. - But how? - I mean, we didn't reverse the spell. - Well, maybe we screwed it up. What? It's not like it would be the first time. No, we didn't screw it up. Something or someone must have done it. - It couldn't have happened on its own. - Why not? It's magic. - Knock, knock. - Leo. I... The front door was open. I hope it's all right. I left my tool box. That's funny, I don't remember that being there last night. Yeah, well, you know what Freud always said about leaving things. That you secretly wanted to come back for it. - Guilty. - Don't use that word. It's a long story. Never mind. - You're leaving, aren't you? - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Do you really have to go? - Well, I've fixed everything I came here to fix. But I'll be back. Promise. Nothing could keep me away from you too long. Well, at least he wasn't a warlock. Hey, you don't suppose Leo was the...? What are you doing? Getting rid of the relinquishment spell. However we got our powers back, I don't wanna risk losing them again. - I second that.
