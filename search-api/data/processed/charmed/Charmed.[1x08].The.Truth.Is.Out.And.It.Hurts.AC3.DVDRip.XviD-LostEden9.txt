- Yes. What a pleasure. I can't tell you how long I've waited for this. Excuse me but have we...? Met? Oh, I'm sorry. Only in print. I've read your work. Your studies, specifically on cell degeneration, are ahead of their time. - You're very kind. - No, really, it's fascinating. You've become kind of a hobby of mine. I found your article on the mutant retina gene to be particularly intriguing. But I haven't even... Published it yet? Don't worry, you will. And you'll help to find the vaccine. A vaccine? Against what? Against this. "Ask again later." Hello, vague. How am I supposed to plan my future without a little direction? You who can see the future is now looking for it in a Magic 8 Ball? My visions don't help me, remember? I've got an idea. Why don't we ask if Prue and Andy will get back together? Oh, Phoebe, please, don't. - Interesting. - Very. You two are cruel. Ask it what a day off feels like? That was my boss, Martin. - I have to go to the restaurant. - You're kidding. There's a convention in town, and business is just crazy. But you worked a double shift yesterday and the day before that. He's working you to death, Piper. You were gonna talk to Martin about this weeks ago. I never got around to it. Yeah, well, tell him to stuff it. Tell him you're taking the night off, and that's that. I know, you're right, I will. Hello, Martin? No, I know what you want, but... Okay. No, it's not a problem. I'll be right there. Wow, you told him. Beware the wrath of Piper. I will talk to him, eventually. I gotta go. Wait, Piper. I'll walk you to the car. It's safer. I'll wait here. Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh, my God, Piper. - What is it? - I just had a premonition. A woman's about to get murdered. Oh, my God. Phoebe saw this murder before it happened. No, not this one. I think I saw the next one. - Is this leaded? - Always is. Good morning, ladies. I took a look at the staircase. Shouldn't be more than two days' work. You mind if I get started? No, not at all. I'll get you some coffee. Oops, you're busy. I'll get it. I'll be right there, Leo. When are you two gonna stop fighting over him and grow up? When Phoebe realizes that she doesn't have a chance with him. Well, that doesn't matter now because I have to go protect the innocent. So we'll call a truce temporarily. I'll just take this to Leo. You know that you're only into him because Piper is. That is so not true. I'm wounded. Is there anything about last night's murders? Nothing of any use. How am I supposed to figure out who the girl in my vision is? What did she look like? Well, she was about 5'3" and her hair was lightish. That's it? If it's not on videotape, I can't exactly rewind it. Hey, you've gotta talk to Andy. - What? - Well, if I can't find her, then I have to find the killer before he gets to her. Well, have you checked the Book of Shadows?</i> The way you described your vision, it sounds like it could be demonic. Yeah, but for all we know, Andy's already hot on his trail. You have to go see him and find out. - Can't. - Won't. Give me a break. We just stopped seeing each other. Don't you think it might be awkward? Okay, then how about I go see him, and you look in the Book of Shadows?</i> - Phoebe. - Prue, I had this vision for a reason. I am supposed to save her. I know it. I have to find her. Nothing. I don't even know what I'm looking for. "Truth spell." What the...? The truth is, I need extra tablecloths because... Oh, wine! I need this space. Can't you do that in the manager's office? - You took my desk, remember? - Then go somewhere else. I've got a restaurant full of hungry conventioneers. I just ran out of white corn chowder, and I need you to get ahold of produce, pronto. - Well, what about the books? - You can take them home with you. I come back after three weeks, and the whole place is chaos. Martin, you know what I think? What? What do you think? I think I'm gonna need that number for produce. - Hey. - Hey. Can I borrow your laptop? I need to do some surfing on the Web. See if I can find anything about the burns on the victim's forehead. What? Nothing. I just never really thought of you as computer-friendly. Are you kidding? Chat rooms saved my life. So did you talk to Andy? Actually, I spoke to his partner instead. - You told Morris? - About the case? I didn't have to. Every inspector at the station was talking about it. The only problem is, they're stumped. Did you find anything in the Book of Shadows?</i> I'm not sure. So you didn't see Andy? No, I said I didn't talk to Andy. I saw him in the parking lot when I left. But... ...he had that look, Prue. You know the one I'm taking about. You might recognize it from the mirror. He really cares about you. Don't you think I know that? So, what are you waiting for? Tell him the truth. It's the only thing standing between you guys. Tell him that I'm a witch? I can't do that. What if he can't handle it? It's not like I can put the genie back in the bottle. He's not gonna turn you in to the warlock police. At least you'd know how he feels once and for all. Otherwise, you'll never know if it could've worked out or not. If I were you, I would figure out a way to tell him. Thank you for the laptop. - Sandwich? - Hey, Tanya, sure. I saved you your favourite. Turkey, no mayo. You're a good woman. - Thanks. - Bye. Okay, you win. Hey, stranger. Back from the war? More like I brought the battle home with me. Inventory. I'll help you with yours if you help me with mine. "For those who want the truth revealed Opened hearts and secrets unsealed From now until it's now again After which the memory ends"</i> So I guess you didn't talk to your boss. Of course I did. Just like I said I would. Am I getting a zit on my chin? Can't even see it. "Those who now are in this house Will hear the truth From others' mouths"</i> You really can't see it? Are you kidding? It looks like that thing has a life of its own. What? So you really told off Martin, huh? No, I lied. I chickened out. Hi, you've reached Andy Trudeau. Leave your name and number, I'll get back to you. Thanks.</i> Hi. Hi, Andy, it's Prue. Hey, I was wondering, I... Could you just call me, please? Soon. Within the next 24 hours. I need to talk to you about something. So just call, okay? Bye. You know tonight would be fine too. Okay, bye. Excuse me. Are you Mr Pearson? Alex Pearson? Yeah, yeah, can I help you? In so many ways. Working late tonight, aren't you? Yeah, I work better at night. And these soil samples just arrived from the Bindura plateau. Ah, Zimbabwe. Their crops have been overrun by disease for decades. Well... ...your work will put an end to that. - That's the hope. - That's the reality. Are you from the foundation? They don't usually check up on us this late. No, no. But I have studied your work, and I know what it will lead to. My work? You mean the lab's. I'm only just a technician. For now, Alex. But someday. Someday you will help find the vaccine. The vaccine? For what? I'm sorry, who are you? What do you want? Your future. Dear God, what is it? Thanks. - Is this leaded? - Nope. - It's not? - Never has been. I just say it is because it's ridiculous to make two pots of coffee when you're the only one who drinks diesel. Prue, don't give me grief when you get the phone bill. I was up all night on the Internet, and I didn't find anything. That poor girl. Oh, Piper, I'm sorry about the crack I made last night about your zit. That's okay. So you really can't see it? Like I said, it's huge. Something weird is going on. Morning, ladies. Should be able to finish the stairs today. Okay. I'll make some more coffee. And I'll bring it to you. Okay. Here we go again, right? Piper, we both know the only reason I like Leo is because you do. Okay, I have no idea why I just said that. What's going on? Okay, I'm late for work. Busy, gotta go. - Prue! - Yeah? Spill. What's up? I cast a truth spell. - What? - What? You cast a truth spell? Yes! Look, please, no more questions. - Why? - Because I wanted to know what Andy would think of me if he found out I was a witch. I can't believe it. Oh, look who's talking, Little Miss Spell-of-the-Week. No, no. I mean I can't believe you actually took my advice. The biggest pooper at the Wicca party has finally used her power for personal gain. It's about time. Personal? It's affecting us. Prue, what have you done? The spell was only supposed to work on me, okay? It said, "those in this house." I thought I was alone. Well, obviously, you weren't. Wait, we just have to... We have to undo it right now, fast. Can't. Twenty-four-hour time limit. Which means until 8:00 tonight everybody who comes into contact with us will have - no choice but to speak the truth. - What do you mean "no choice"? Exactly that. Ask me a question. I'm game. Prue, what do you think of me? While I admire your confidence and your fearlessness, your utter lack of responsibility frustrates me to no end. Oh, God, that is so enough. Oh, my God. This could be very dangerous. I'm kind of digging it. Piper, what do you really think of your boss? I think he's a self-serving jerk who must have a very small penis. - Oh, my God! I'm gonna be so fired. - No, no, no. It's okay. Because once the spell ends, no one will remember what they've heard. You guys, I just wanted to see how Andy would react. What a way to come out of the broom closet. Are you nuts? We just need to lock the doors, call in sick and just stay in our own bedrooms until it just goes away. Hello, there's a demon on the loose, and I still have to find that woman. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. - Premonition? - No. An epiphany. So are you telling me that everyone I ask a question to has to answer with the truth? I think so, yes. But that also means, if we get asked a question, we have to answer with the truth. I can work around that. This is cool. Very cool. Phoebe, no. Where are you go...? Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now. - Phoebe. - Hi, Andy. - What...? - Have you talked to Prue? She left a message on my machine last night. Wasn't sure if I wanted to call her back. Oh, believe me. Trust me. You definitely want to call her back. That why you came here? Hardly. What do you know about the guy they found murdered in the movie theatre parking lot the other night? Lead detective says he's not the only victim. They found a lab technician out in Oakland. They had the same cauterized mark on their forehead, and their eyes were drained of colour. They were completely white. - Wait. - Cause of death? Unknown. Looks like they took a bullet to the head, only there's no exit wound and no bullet. Phoebe, this is highly... - Any suspects? - Not yet. Any evidence that could lead to a suspect? They found a button at the crime scene, possibly from the suspect's jacket, made of an alloy Forensics has never seen before. What the hell is...? Do not ask that question. I gotta go. Thanks. Don't forget to call Prue by 8:00 tonight. Hello? I mean, Prue Halliwell. - Hey, it's me. - Andy, hi.</i> Phoebe stopped by, suggested I give you a call. Phoebe. Yeah, but can we meet? I really don't wanna talk over the phone. Should I be looking forward to this or dreading it? Honestly, I don't know. But what are you doing for dinner? An early dinner? Like, let's say, now? It's lunchtime. But I'm gonna be interviewing a witness in your area around 5.</i> I could swing by after. Yeah? Here? Yeah, I guess that's fine. All right, I'll see you then. - Hey, Tanya. - Personal call, Prue? Personal business, Hannah. And I swear that that's my name on the door. Look. Last turkey, no mayo. My favourite. - Actually, I was saving that for Prue. - Yeah, you were. Don't you hate turkey? Of course I do. I just don't want you to have it. Is there any particular reason why you're such a bitch to me? Yes. Because it's my mission in life to destroy you. Well, nothing like a bit of interoffice rivalry to get those competitive juices flowing. Hannah, a word. - What do you think you're doing? - I don't know. It came out. No, no, no. It didn't just come out, you almost came out. Am I to believe that suddenly you've lost control of your faculties? No. God, she's just so... So Prue. Forgive me? Always. Hey. Go on, get back to work. Martin, I can't work tonight. I have to do the books. Do the books and run the floor? That's imposs... But you don't underst... Right now? I'm on my way. Nice talking to you too, jerk. Hey, I had a little bit of an accident. Do you mind if I borrow your washer? No, not at all. Go right ahead. Can I get you some coffee? You'd better not. I'll just wind up knocking it all over again. Truth is, caffeine makes me a little clumsy, you know. - Leo, wait. - Yeah. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Do you need another shirt? No, I got one in the truck. Thanks. Leo, wait. That wasn't my question. - It wasn't? - No. I was just wondering, do you ever think of me? - Yeah. - In what way? - As a friend sort of way or...? - You have beautiful eyes. That's a good way. I'm sorry. That was totally inappropriate, - wasn't it? - No, not at all. Oh, what the hell. Leo, how do you feel about women who make the first move? I don't know. I'm still waiting for it to happen. Goodness. How do you feel about guys who make the second move? Love them. - Hi, Rex. - Hello, Prue. How are you? I am a nervous wreck because I'm about to tell my boyfriend that I am a wi... - ner. A winner. She is a real catch, this one is. I'm Phoebe, her sister. We met, remember? Yeah, how could I forget? Let's go to my office. - Okay, the spell is really working. - Yeah, I know. So you talked to Andy? I sure did. He gave me a list of all the victims. They all died the same way too. Only problem is, they don't have a suspect, which means that I have no way of finding... - Her. - Who her? That's the girl from my premonition. Tanya? Wait, hold the elevator. Excuse me. Are you Mrs Parker? - Tanya Parker? - Yes. You have been most difficult to find. Never in the same place. Never alone. Excuse me? - Are you sure? - Yes, and that's the truth. All right, take the stairs. I'll call security. Get off me! Get off me! Run, Tanya, ru... Oh, my! Drive! Phoebe! Honey, I'm fine. No, there's no reason to fly back early. I'm staying... ...with friends. I'll explain it all when you get home. - Kids? Do you have any kids? - Not yet. - Pets? - No. I love you too. Before I can explain any of this to my husband, you're gonna have to explain it to me. What is going on? Short story: You're in danger. And to keep you out of it, we have to keep you out of the obvious places, which is why you have to stay here. - But what was that thing? - Truth spell. That thing... ...was a demon. I'm out of here. No, Tanya, he's killed before. Trust me. Call the cops. Check it out. That burn on your forehead, that's how he does it. I've seen it, okay? I have visions. Visions of people that I'm supposed to help. I've seen his next victim. It's you. There are no coincidences. I was supposed to see you, to find you. And now I'm supposed to save you. - Romaine in fridge three. - Okay. Phoebe. You have her there, at the house? I understand you have to protect the innocent, but couldn't you find one that makes a decent béarnaise sauce? My kitchen is collapsing. Well, I gotta go. I'll be there as soon as I can. Martin, hi. Just the man I wanted to... I made a list. You better check it twice. I'll be back after the dinner rush. But I've got a family situation. So you'd like to take off, go home, take care of business? Thank you, Martin, for understanding. Well, don't thank me, because the answer is no. All right, Martin. What part of "family situation" do you not understand? Are you insane? No one person can do all of this. How do you expect me to do it all alone? - Because I know you will. - What? Why spend money on employees when I know you'll do it? And you won't complain. I've got a bargain, all the work for half the price. Piper, I don't know why I said that. Too late, Martin. Truth's out, and so am I. You don't deserve me. I quit. - Andy, hi. - Hello, Prue. I am so sorry I'm late. My meeting ran over. Your assistant said I could wait here. I hope that's okay. Yeah, of course. Can I get you anything? Something to drink? I'm fine. - How are you? - A nervous wreck. You? Heart's pounding like a sledgehammer. So, Andy... ...how well do you think you really know me? Well, I know about your fondness for Twizzlers, how you can't stand it when people talk at the previews, how you like to argue to win, and how you pick your cuticles when you're nervous. I also know I'd love to start seeing you again. I wish you could trust me enough to tell me whatever it is you're afraid of. Well, actually that's what I wanted to see you about. Except that instead of telling you, I think I'll just show you... ...so here it goes. You see this? Watch. What the hell was that? My secret. I did that with my mind. - You're telekinetic? - Yes. Well, no. Actually, it's just so much more than that. I'm a witch. - A what? - A good witch. I have powers. I never wanted them. I didn't even find out about them until recently. Right around the time that I ran into you again. Okay. You know all those times that I disappeared or would show up at a crime scene with no logical explanation. Well, this is why. And believe me, I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone. Are you okay? I don't know. I mean, of all the things I thought you were hiding, this was... ...actually nowhere on the list. Does this mean that Piper and Phoebe are...? Yeah. We inherited our powers from Mom and Grams. So when you have kids...? If they're girls, yes. Well, that's a... That's quite a secret you've been hiding. Tell me about it. Can you change? I mean, is this something you can get rid of? No. Andy, I can't change who I am. And that's something that I've recently come to accept. The question is, can you? Well, to tell you the truth... ...I don't know, Prue. I honestly don't know. - Did Prue talk to Andy? - She didn't say. Did you find anything in the Book of Shadows?</i> Nothing I recognize. So Andy said the third victim was a professor at Stanford? - What's the link? - He thinks it has something to do with what they're working on. Biogenetics. A professor, a geneticist, a lab technician... And a sandwich girl? - Do you really think he's after me? - Truth spell. Piper, we need milk. Kitchen. - She's carrying. - Carrying what? A baby, she's pregnant. No, no. She doesn't know yet. What do we do? Do we tell her? I mean, we protect, we don't do prenatal. No, this not the kind of information Tanya needs right now, especially from people she just met who are telling her some three-eyed demon wants to suck the life out of her. Suck the life out of her. Wait a minute. Is it possible that it's not Tanya he wants? - That it's her baby? - How would he know she's pregnant? I don't know. Maybe he sees the future too. Or else he's from it. - Excuse me? - The button. The police found a button by one of the last victims made out of some kind of funky metal they'd never seen before. - Rewind. - Okay. There's a button that's not supposed to exist, a demon that the Book of Shadows says doesn't exist</i> and a baby no one knows exists. You got a better explanation? Even if you're right, how will we find him? Well, he wants Tanya. He'll find us. He doesn't know where we are. Well, he found Tanya at Buckland's. He saw me... With Prue. Hey, last one out gets the lights? I'm going home. - So lock up when you leave? - Sure. Prue? About what I said earlier... Now isn't a good time. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. But you wouldn't really mean that, would you? No. Excuse me. Are you Miss Halliwell? Prue Halliwell? Yes. Did we have an appointment? No. Actually, I'm looking for someone, and I believe you can help me. I find objects, not people. Well, I think you might know her. I saw you talking to her earlier. Petite, brown hair. The two of you were over by the elevators. I don't remember. Are you sure? What do you want with her? She's hiding the woman I was sent back to kill. - Sent back from where? - The future. - What are you doing? - Why kill Tanya? I don't want Tanya. I want what's inside her. No! - And the others, why kill them? - They were all... ...pieces of the puzzle. Pieces of the vaccine. Stop this! Answer. Come on Prue, pick up. You have reached Buckland Auction House...</i> There's no answer. It's after 5. It's going straight to voice mail. - You have to go to Buckland's. - I'll grab my keys, grab Tanya. No. You have to go. Alone. If we bring Tanya with us and he's there, it's bringing the feast to the lion. And she can't stay here by herself, so... But I need you, Phoebe. We need you. I can't always be the power of three. But what if he comes here, and you're all alone? We'll be in the attic with the Book. - Okay, be careful. - You too. I've got eight and a half months to find Tanya, Miss Halliwell. Plenty of time. Yours, however... ...has run out. Prue? Oh, no. You can't hide from me forever. What's the vaccine for? What does it protect against? Against me, of course. And all other warlocks like me... ...in the future. The Parker child will be the one to bring together all the elements... ...to create... ...the vaccine which will destroy us. Unless I stop him. Hey. Need a hand? - Yeah. - Okay. He's not after Tanya. He's after her baby. She's pregnant. Yeah, I know. - Truth spell. Later. Where's Phoebe? - Home protecting Tanya. Well, what are you waiting for, Piper? Whack him. No. Can't you move him? Where? He's from the future. - Prue, he's gonna unfreeze soon. - Piper, just do it. - No, you do it. - No, do it! Piper! - Just do it! - Oh, my... I love it when they clean up after themselves. - Prue. - Andy. I need to know how you feel about what I told you. - I'm gonna need a little more time. - I don't have time, Andy. I need to know before 8. - Come inside. We'll talk about it. - I can't. - Prue. - Andy, no. Look, if I come inside we'll have drinks, there'll be small talk, and precious minutes will pass. I need to know now. Can you or can you not accept that I'm a witch? If I have to answer right now... ...I don't think so, Prue. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, I guess. It's just not a future I envision having. What were we just talking about? - You don't remember? - Honestly, no. You don't remember anything you said to me in the last 24 hours? No. It's really weird. You want to come inside? No. I have to go. Goodbye, Andy. Excuse me. What good is saving the future if I can't get a glass of water in the present? Speaking of the future, where did Tanya go? She went to the bathroom. Morning sickness. Only she thinks it's the halibut. Oh, great. She'll probably sue the restaurant for food poisoning. Will this day never end? Actually, it's just did. It's 8:20. The spell is over. The world is a safer place. Piper, I see you sitting. What is wrong with this picture? - You don't remember? - Remember what? Piper, I need you in the kitchen, pronto. We're down a sous-chef. I don't believe it. I finally stand up for myself and quit, and he doesn't even remember. Wait a minute. Everybody else has forgotten the truth, - why do we still remember it? - Truth or consequences. Wiccan rule, right? Prue cast a spell for her own personal gain, now we have to deal with the fallout. I'll be right back. I need to remind Martin of something. You go, girl! Martin, we need to talk. - Excuse you. - I cannot... No, I will not do everything by myself anymore. I need help. Your restaurant needs help. You need another manager, sous-chef, hostess and an extra busboy on the weekends. If you will not agree to hire these people, then tell me now and I'll quit. Honey, what took you so long? All you had to do was ask. Really? I mean, okay. I'll see you tomorrow. But I just... It's my night off. Oh, Leo! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just surprised. Yeah, me too. What are you doing here? Well, I wanted to see you. I just... I have this really strange feeling that I did something I should apologize for. - Did I? - No. No. Not at all. Definitely not. Can I buy you a drink? - Hey. - Hey. How'd it go? - Not well. - Oh, Prue, I'm so sorry.
