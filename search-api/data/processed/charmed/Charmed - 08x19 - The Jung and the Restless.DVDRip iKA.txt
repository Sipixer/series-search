Yeah, that just makes them powerful, though, not bad. Don't be so naive. Christy was raised by the Triad who wanted us dead, remember? I understand that, but that doesn't mean Billie and Christy want us dead. They're the Ultimate Power. They were chosen to take us out. Don't you see that? No, actually I don't. Look, I mean, yeah, it's a possibility. - But we're not there yet. - Aren't we? Okay, witch, whitelighter, wife. I give up. How do I juggle all this? - What are we arguing about? - The Ultimate Power, what else? Her name is Billie, and I think we should help her, not hurt her. Okay, what if she tries to hurt us first? Then what? Back to your corners. Here's the deal. This is difficult for us, right? So we should probably try to be nice to each other. Especially hard on me. Gee, she used to be my charge. So you're saying, what? That you side with Phoebe? No, I didn't say that at all. I'm saying it's messing with our lives. I mean, you with P3 and the boys, you with work and Cupid. Michael. And me, lucky little me, I am stuck with another future whitelighter. Which means I don't even get to see my new husband. Well, at least you have a husband. I'm still trying to get mine back. And I'm still trying to find a husband, but that doesn't mean that we can't... - What? - Oh, dear, she's in trouble. Is this ever gonna end? I'm gonna go try and make a potion. To do what? What do you think? Okay, but I just don't think I'm ready for this right now. Better get ready. Holy crap! Duck! Arrow! Paige, I don't understand. Where did you come from? See for yourself. Hey, Colin, did you come visit your daddy today at work? - Yeah. - Oh, that's great. Hello, little missy. I like your hair like that. I wear my hair like that, too, sometimes. Oh, oh, this is nice. Oh, they're so cute, aren't they? Of course you'll never have one of your own unless you follow through with a date. What are you doing back here? I'm just trying to figure you out, which I thought I already had. Okay, get up. Get up! Get up! Hey, hey, hey! Okay. If you don't start taking this more seriously, you're gonna be sitting here alone again next year for career day. You know what, I don't want to deal with this right now, okay? No, no, it's not okay. Not by a long shot. You know, I worked my tail off to find you a perfectly good match in Michael. And what do I get for it? - You go out with him once. - So? So I've got a reputation to protect. I've never missed. Well, there's a first time for everything. No, no, no. Not when it comes to finding love. Not when it comes to me. You are so cocky, you know that? You're damn right I am. I know you, Phoebe, inside and out. I have researched every nook and cranny. Okay, that makes me feel violated. I know what you're looking for in a man, believe me. I am an expert in you. Which is exactly why I know there's absolutely nothing wrong with Michael. Okay, so I'm just supposed to marry the guy? No, of course not. I didn't say he was the one. - The point is... - You know what, I don't care what your point is right now, okay? I'm dealing with a lot. And I'm trying to balance everything out. Phoebe, love is paramount. Not now. Okay, please, not now. You know, maybe you should try reaching out to Billie, talk to her. How do you know? I told you. I know you. What are you doing? Just trying to figure this whole stupid thing out. - You know, if this really is destined. - It is. Well, then it should be written somewhere, don't you think? Everything else is. Billie, why do you keep fighting this? Because... Because I don't like it. Okay? It sucks. I just, I feel like I walked out on my family. I know, but they're not your family, Billie. They never were. They used you. I just don't believe that. It's because you don't want to believe that. And I don't blame you. I mean, after you trusted them and you befriended them, you were betrayed. I just feel like this is a huge misunderstanding. If we could just talk to them, maybe... We tried talking to them, but they don't care about us or you. They only care about themselves. That's all they've ever cared about. - That's not true. - Isn't it? What did they want to do to you when they first met you? They wanted to train you, to teach you the craft. Yes, and they did. Yeah, but not for you. It was for them. So they could kick back and do whatever they wanted, and you could go out there and risk your life and do their job. I mean, they're supposed to be the Charmed Ones, Billie, not you. They're good people Christy. They've helped hundreds of innocents. Not lately, they haven't. Lately, they've been doing everything for themselves, for their personal gain. And it's not right. I mean, they faked their deaths, they've bartered with destiny, they've remade the world with avatars, all for themselves. I mean, does that sound like the greater good to you? You know, you talk about them like they're evil or something. Billie, it's not about good or evil. It's about power. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. I mean, they feel like they don't have to live by the rules anymore. That they can do whatever they want, and no one's gonna be there to stop them. Yeah, and what am I supposed to do? - Stop them? - No. No, we're supposed to stop them. It's our destiny. I'm just not ready to do that. I can't. Well, you have to get ready. We both do. If we don't stop them, nobody will. It's up to us. What's wrong? Nothing. I just... I need to clear my head, get out of here for a while, so... I'll be back. Overpowered by the powerless. What happened? She was saved by her whitelighter, Salek. Then you should've shot both of them. She wasn't just a whitelighter, Salek. She was a Charmed One. - How do you know? - You've taught us well. Not well enough, apparently. Where is she now, the charge? I don't know. The witch cloaked her with her magic. - Should I move on to another charge? - No. I want this one. To lure the Charmed One. There is no better prize. - But I'm not sure how to tr... - You won't have to. I'll do it myself. I've waited my whole life for an opportunity like this. But I must be patient. I must wait for just the right opening. But, in success, the underworld will bow to you. The demons won't stand there... I don't give a damn what the demons think! Let them cling to their prophecies of Ultimate Powers, their rumours of final battles. I only care about one battle. Okay, stay put. I will be right back, okay? Wait, where are you going? I have to go check on my sister. Well, you just did that. See, actually, no. It's my other sister. Look, I know you're freaked out right now, but I've got so many things going on, so if you could wait here a sec... Wait a minute. What about me? I still don't understand anything that's going on here. I mean, okay, - witches and blacklighters? - Oh, no, no, darklighters. But what does it mean? What does it have to do with me? You see, I told you, you are a future whitelighter. I'll explain more about that later, too, okay? Are you sure you got the right person? Positive. Otherwise the darklighters wouldn't be trying to stop you from becoming a whitelighter. - Darklighters? - No, crazy sister. Okay, here's the deal: You're safe, so stay put, have a seat on the couch. I'll be back as soon as I can. Hey there, what did that mannequin ever do to you? Cute. Poor thing. - What are you doing? - Making a power-of-three potion. Oh, for what? Oh, Piper. Look, sooner or later you two are gonna realise that it's us or them, and I for one would like to be ready. Look, you can't just vanquish Billie and Christy. For one thing, you know, it's illegal. Is that the best you got? Well, I think that's a pretty valid point. Look, we know you wanna get Leo back. You know what? I'm tired of everybody using that against me, like it diminishes my credibility or something. Because it doesn't. Well, you must admit, it's probably clouding your judgement a little bit. That sounds more like something Phoebe would say. - Yeah, she just did. - What do you mean, she just did? - When did she say that exactly? - On the phone, a few minutes ago. Oh, I see. She's taking your calls but she's not taking my calls. - Where is she? - She's at home. - Where are you going? - To find out what her problem is. Sisters. Hey, sweetie, I'm really glad you came. Come in. Are we alone? Yeah, of course we are. So how are you doing? You okay? What do you wanna talk about? I would imagine the same thing that you wanna talk about. I mean, that's why you're here, right? Well, I'm a little confused right now, that's all. Well, what are you confused about? Why you all used me. Is that Christy talking? - Don't blame this on her. - I'm not blaming anything on her. I'm just trying to understand, okay? Look, Billie, we're not the bad guys here. Well, she thinks you are. Okay, well, she's wrong. She thinks you're using your powers for yourselves, not the greater good. And sooner or later... Sooner or later, what? You'll have to be stopped. Is that what you think too? I don't know, okay? That's why I'm here. You said we were alone. Hello, we were alone. What are you doing here? Wondering what she's doing here. We're just having a little chat. Good, great. I'm listening. Stay away from my sister. Okay, how did you get in? The same way we're leaving. Let's go. Okay, can't we just all talk about this, please? There's nothing to talk about. - All right, then. - Don't. Piper! - No, Piper! - Do you need any more proof? Do you? Here's something to help you relax. Doubt it. You got anything stronger? It's a little early for that, don't you think? It's 5:00 somewhere. Okay, I take it you whitelighters aren't one for a drink, huh? Well, if you had a life like mine... Mikelle, look, I know your history, okay? I know you've had a tough time. The thing is, though, you don't believe in yourself. You keep telling yourself you're going to be nothing, you will in fact be nothing. Clearly, the reason I was sent to help you, was to help you see that you're meant for something special. You're sweet. I just think it's gonna take a lot more than some nice words and a cup of tea to make me believe that I'm meant for something in my life. - I should probably go. - No. You can't go. Can't leave, sorry. You obviously have other things to worry about. You can't, because we haven't found the darklighter who's after you, okay? It is too dangerous out there. You haven't even started looking for him yet. Piper, why didn't you just freeze them? Because it wouldn't have worked. Okay, so it's better to just start a war? Oh, stop. It was one lousy potion. I just meant to scare them. I wasn't gonna take them out with that. "Take them out"? Why don't you say what you really mean? Kill them. Girls, be nice. - I'm out of here. - No, just stay, okay? Please. Stay. Have some tea. What were you even doing there? Why were you hiding it from me? Look, I'm only in the way here. No, you're not, please stay. Hey, a little help here, please? There. I froze somebody. Happy? All right, you two. This is ridiculous. We're not gonna solve anything by fighting with each other. Since when did you become the big sister? Since you stopped acting like one. And you, what's this whole sneaking around behind our backs thing? It's not what we need right now. It's not making our lives any easier. You know what, I'm really glad I went, because I actually learned something. Like what? That they would like to kill us? No, that, just in their twisted reality, they think that we're the bad guys. It's not a twisted reality. It's a Triad reality. They brainwash Christy, just like Christy's gonna brainwash Billie. Well, not necessarily. And, look, you know, they're right. We're not all about the greater good anymore. No one can expect us to be. We've been doing this for eight years, and we've done a lot of really great good in my opinion. Hello? What do you mean, the band's not coming? I have a signed contract. I don't? Well, that's too bad. You're gonna have to figure that one out, because, you know, I got stuff going on. How the hell did that happen? We're spreading ourselves too thin. I can't even find a stupid darklighter. I'm sure she doesn't think he's stupid. - Thank you for the guilt. - Okay, regardless of what you think, the cold, hard fact is, the power of three is needed to stop Billie and Christy, whether you like it or not. Well, I'm sorry, I just still don't like it. What about you? I don't know yet. But I have a charge to save. They threw a potion at us, Billie. At both of us. She didn't mean to. She just wants Leo back. So that means she has to kill us? That wouldn't have killed us, you know that. Billie, this is insane. I cannot believe you're defending them. I'm not, or I am... I don't know. Look, maybe they're just as confused about all this as we are. - I'm not confused. - Well, I am. I'm sorry, but I am. This isn't easy for me. - I care about them a lot, you know. - I know. I just wish I knew more, so I could know what to do. I can show you. The same way the Triad showed me. I was meant to be taken, Billie, to be shown the way, just like you were meant to find me, so I could show you. - The way? - Our path. It's the one we're meant to share together for the greater good. But before you can do what you have to do, first you have to see that their core, their inner truths, are not for the greater good. That they don't deserve to keep their powers. They lost the way. Are you ready to see that? Hey. What, bad time? No, I just walked in the door. Yeah, I know. I've been hovering in the ether. So did you talk to Billie? How did it go? Yeah, I talked to her right up until the point where Piper tried to kill her. What? What are you talking about? I don't wanna go through it again, but it didn't go well. And I don't wanna bore you with all this family drama. Well, I'm here. Bore me. But it has nothing to do with love. Yeah, it does. Family love. It's your sisters, right? Come on, try me. Okay, if I ask you a question, you have to promise me that you're gonna be really honest. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think I'm selfish? - Selfish? - Yeah, selfish. I mean, do you think it's wrong for me to want a life after being charmed? You know, with work and friends and... Love? Yeah. And love too. I mean, is it wrong for me to want those things? No, I mean, not as far as I'm concerned. And obviously not as far as the Elders are concerned either. Otherwise they wouldn't have sent me down here to you. I may be talking out of turn, because I don't know for sure, but I would think, with everything you've done, for as long as you've done it, you deserve to have a life. All of you do. You've earned it. - Thank you. - Yeah. I just don't think Billie and Christy see it that way. That doesn't matter. It's Billie. What do I do? Whatever your heart tells you to. Hello. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. I need to know if Billie and Christy are the ones we're going to have to fight to get Leo back. Boy, you get right to the point, don't you? Please. I don't know, Piper. I'm sorry. Only the Angel of Destiny knows. How is that possible? If this is the great threat everybody's so worried about, how can you not know who it is? What do you guys do up there all day? - We think that it might be, yes. - Perfect. Especially after the involvement of the Triad. You have to understand that this plan was put into motion years before you even knew that you were witches. But why? Perhaps they anticipated that no one would ever be able to defeat you. So rather than looking for more demons, they recruited powerful witches, just like you. And perhaps even more importantly... ...powerful sisters. Would you like to explain that to Phoebe? Because I don't think she's gonna believe me. It won't make it any easier for her to know. Billie is a friend. A person. That's what makes it all the more insidious. So how do we defeat them? I wish I knew. Hey, guess who just called. Did she say what she wanted? Just that she wanted to speak to us. This could very well be a trap. Did she call Phoebe? Yeah, she did. Well, at the risk of your wrath, I'm gonna tell you that this could be a very bad idea. I know, but please, let's just listen to what Billie has to say. I just spoke with an Elder, and she confirmed those two could be very big trouble for us. - What? - She wasn't 100 percent sure, but it is a possibility, which means, sooner or later... Considering you wanna kill us, maybe you should use the front door. I don't wanna kill you, Piper. I just wanna find out the truth. - Well, how do we help you find that? - Like this: You promise not to hurt them, right? Not until you see what you need to see. They're barely breathing. The potion put them into a deep sleep, so all they do is dream. And since dreams provide insight, you'll be able to see what they truly care about. How? Paige? Who are you? I'm Mikelle. I'm her charge. - Oh, my God. - Wait. No, no, no. It's okay. - Just let her go. - But what if she's in trouble? She's not our concern. They are. Looks like your whitelighter left you uncloaked. Big mistake. No, no, no. Please, what do you want? I want your screams to draw her directly to me. Everything in dream world has a meaning. All the people, the places, the emotions, they're all manifestations of who they truly are, together as well as separately. - Will they know they're dreaming? - Yes. They'll probably think they were sent there, so you'll have to be careful. You just have to play a role, and make them believe that you're part of their dreams. Well, how am I gonna find their inner truths? Well, they'll have to find their inner truths in order to wake up. All you have to do is follow them. Just think of a sister, and... you're there. That's dream world. This will get you in and out. - Are you ready? - I hope you're wrong. Billie, if I am wrong, we'll leave them alone just like I promised. - But if I'm not... - I know, I know. Anything? No, everything seems normal, sort of. Yeah, well, Mikelle is gone. And so is Billie. She obviously did something to us. - Yeah, but what? - I don't know, but this is weird. And that's never good. I told you it was a trap. Okay, well, we need to figure out what she did to us, and fast. Oh, why don't we just ask her? Oh, hey, guys, what's up? I'm late for class. Bye. No, you don't. Jesse, over here, I was... - I do too. - Very well, thank you. - In here. - We have till next Tuesday. I'm still waiting for the fax. This article's too long. You've gotta cut it down. Wait, can't we just take some space from "Ask Phoebe"? Well, Mom, what do you think? Wait, did you just say "Mom"? What? So just answer one letter today, will it kill you? - Hold on, wait a minute. - We're running out of time. You know, you can't keep putting us on hold. Baby, come here. - "Baby"? - Honey, come on. What the hell is going on? Piper? Phoebe? Henry? Henry's not here. Who the? But then you're not looking for him anyway. What do you mean? I'm not? Follow me. Hold on, wait. What about me? Mikelle, what are you doing here? I need your help. Okay, stay here and wait for me. I'll be right back. I want my money back! Where's the band? This is a rip-off. Excuse you. You gonna tell them you forgot to sign the contract? What? You can't keep neglecting everything for Leo, you know. Hey, wait... You! All right, I want answers now. - I'm listening. - What's your problem? My problem? My problem is, I wanna know what you did to us and why. I didn't do anything. You did it. I did it? What does that mean? You tell me. It's your dream. My dream? What are you talking about? I asked you a question. What are you gonna do, blow me up again like last time? - Last time? - Every damn dream lately, that's all you ever do. It's like I'm responsible for Leo or something. Are you trying to drive me crazy? Look, I'm not the bad guy here, okay? As much as you want to demonize me, I am not the problem. Okay, fine. Then what is? How do I know? Look, you know the truth, you know what you're all about. Find it. Phoebe. We... We shouldn't be doing this. We have to hurry. What do you mean? Why do you keep saying that? You want a family, don't you? Kids? Well, yeah, but doesn't it go against all the Cupid rules? There are no rules in a dream. A dream? Is that what this is? This can be whatever you want it to be. Wait a minute. You and me in a dream... Oh, boy. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. - Let's get this organized. - What's the deadline on that? What the hell...? Come, seek. Seek what exactly? Your inner truth. What you keep searching for, and what keeps eluding you. Please tell me I'm not dreaming about myself. Why can't I dream about somebody cool, like, I don't know, Quentin Tarantino? Not until you find you. The search for self is a noble one. And if you don't find it, you'll be lost, imbalanced, and ultimately, spread too thin. Yeah, well, tell me something I don't know. You don't know me. But you want to, more than anything. Paige. Mikelle. Piper? Paige? Oh, Piper, thank God I found you. Wait, this is you, right? Not some weird, wacky manifestation? Wacky? Maybe. You think we're dreaming too? What else could it be? What I don't get is, why would Billie do this to us? I mean, what does she get out of it? I don't know, but we have to figure out a way to wake up. Otherwise, we're in deep trouble. Oh, so now you're worried about Billie and Christy. Well, yeah, I mean, I may be an optimist, but I'm not stupid, you know. - Have you seen Paige? - No, you? Well, they don't wanna kill us. If they did, we'd be dead, not dreaming. What were you dreaming about? Neglect. Apparently I put everything in my life on hold for Leo. Sounds about right. What were you dreaming about? Oh, you know, I'd rather not get into it, really. Oh, okay, I was dreaming about me and Coop, and... You know, we were doing stuff. Hang on a second. So you were having sex dreams while I'm sitting here, wracked with guilt? I'm sure he was just representing what I really wanted, you know. I mean... I don't want him, obviously, you know, because, even if I did, I couldn't... I couldn't have him, because of all the rules. Okay, so you're the big psychology major. How do we get out of this? What do we do now? I think we go deeper. I think we have to follow our dreams wherever they lead us, and hope that we wake up. Hopefully. Okay, so how do we do that? I don't know. Let's start by interpreting where we've already been, and try to figure out where our dreams are gonna take us. Paige. You, get me out of here now. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I don't have time for this crap, okay? You wanna stop us? You think we're selfish? Whatever. But if you don't get me out of here right now, my charge is going to die. Is that what you want? Welcome back. What's this? I didn't have a choice. Piper? Phoebe? They can't wake up. Not yet. But don't worry. They'll be fine, I promise. They better be. I gotta get back. - Paige. - Oh, my God. Mikelle. Well, hopefully you'll die faster than it took you to get here. I don't understand. Why isn't it working? I don't know. Maybe we're thinking too hard. Maybe we just need to let go and see what happens. I can't. I'm too worried. I'm worried about Paige. I mean, why haven't we seen her? - Maybe she got out. - Or maybe not. Well, there's nothing we can do until we get back, so our only choice is to follow our dreams. All right, all right, all right. Okay, what did Billie say to you at the club? She said something about, I kept blowing her up, and, you know, right about now that seems like a pretty fabulous idea. Blowing her up, why? Because I think she's responsible for Leo, which, if she's talking about getting him back, then she would be correct. Okay, maybe you need to stop focusing on Billie and focus on Leo. I mean, that's what the bartender said too. And what about you and your lover? I don't think it relates to him. I mean, not directly anyway. I think it more has to do with... Mommy, Mommy! Did you hear that? What, your tall, exotic lover? No. Mommy, hurry! You didn't hear that? Okay, you wait here. Keep thinking about Leo. I'm sorry, Mommy. Okay. Just go with it. What happened, little sweet girl? I wanted some cookies but I fell. Oh, well, that's okay. Mommy's here now. Okay. You almost didn't make it. You almost missed me. What do you mean? You gotta hurry. Or it's gonna be too late to have me. Don't you want me, Mommy? Yes, of course I do. More than anything in this world. You're it. Go on. I said no... - Tag. - I'm it again. You're it. All right, you're it. Tag, you're it. Can't catch me. Music to the ear, huh? A house full of grandkids. It's what we always dreamed of, isn't it... ...Piper? Leo? Save me. Whatever it takes. Piper? Help. We're back. Yeah, but where's Paige? You don't think Billie... No, she didn't do this to hurt us, but she did it for some reason. So is she off the hook? Hardly, but that's tomorrow's problem. Now we gotta find Paige. Well? It's not wrong for them to want what they want. It is when they've got the kind of powers they do. And when they use those powers to get what they want at the expense of all else. Somebody's gotta stop them, Billie, before it's too late. I know. No need to waste good arrows. You're a strong one, aren't you? But it'll be over soon. You're too late. Oh, my God. Paige. Paige. Hang in there. - What do we do? - We need a whitelighter. Maybe that's why I'm here. Mikelle? Paige. You were right. I was meant for something special. And I think I just did it. Hey, how you doing? You okay? Yeah, I guess I'm okay. Considering. Considering what? Considering that I was supposed to save my charge, and instead she wound up saving me. Maybe Billie's right. Maybe we are selfish. No, wanting a life doesn't make us selfish. It makes us normal. Yeah, well, we're not normal. We're "the Charmed Ones. " Nobody said we had to be that for the rest of our lives. It's not written in stone. Yeah, and if wanting children and enlightenment and Leo back makes us selfish, then I'm guilty. I'd say we've done enough. And that doesn't make us evil. Well, I think it does from Billie and Christy's warped point of view.
