have you? Hey, online dating, I mean. Oh, no, I have. I have, a couple of times. It's just... It's not my favourite way to meet people. - Really, why not? - Oh, I don't know. It's just very impersonal, you know. Too planned. Well, I have to say, I've... I've met quite a few interesting women online. Really? More interesting than you tend to meet in person? What's this? Oh, I'm doing an article on Internet dating. Wait. Your profile said that you were looking for romance. Yeah. Yeah, it... It did. And l... I kind of am. It's just... My new boss put me up to this. I didn't really wanna do it. I'm sorry. You mad? No. No, not at all. I still have high hopes for this evening. Are you all right? Yeah. Just hiccups. You wait right here. No, no, no. Pat Benatar cannot cancel on me. I won't be able to replace her by this weekend. - Piper. - Look, I know I didn't call to confirm, but I was busy creating life, okay? Look, just let me talk to Pat. I know she'd understand, really. Hello? He hung up on me, that little cretin. My date is a demon. What? That guy? - But he's so hot. - Yeah, hot as in flames-of-hell hot. I had a premonition. He devours his victims. I'm next. - Freeze the room. - My sister, the demon magnet. Witches. Damn it. Thank you. Now, if you don't mind, I have to get back to going bankrupt. Scratch that. I have to get back to fighting with my husband. - Oh, another fight? - Yeah, well, you know. New parents, two-career couple, all that kind of stuff. We'll figure it out. Now, you gonna come home with me or you gonna try and salvage this evening? No. I think my luck has run out. Greensleeves was my heart oF gold And who but my Lady Greensleeves</i> Yeah, who but my Lady Greensleeves</i> Alas, my love, you do... A little down on my luck, sir. Could you spare some change? God bless you. Greensleeves was all my joy Greensleeves was my delight Greensleeves was all my joy Begging your pardon, sir. I meant no disrespect. I'll just be on me way. You know what I hate most about leprechauns? You're all cowards. You don't deserve your gift. And it'll be my pleasure to take it from every last one of you. Tough break, Paddy. You're just the cutest little Wiccan thing I ever did see. Yes, you are. Hot, hot, hot. Leo! Freaking ever-useless Elders. What is taking them so long? - What? What'd he do, what'd I miss? - Oh, no, it's not Wyatt. It's a poem that this guy... At least I hope it's a guy. - Just e-mailed me. I thought you didn't like the online dating thing. - Oh, believe me, I don't. - I'm confused. Okay, look. I can schedule in five minutes for a sisterly chat, but then I gotta go. I cannot schedule in sisterly chat. I'm telling you, you got four minutes and 55 seconds. - Hi. - Perfect timing, we were just chatting. - Anything you need to talk about? - No, I'm good. - Good, more time for you. Shoot. - No, I don't need to talk. It's not like I have any desire to go meet this Cyrano 73. It was just research for that stupid article Jason made me do. You said his name without swearing. Does that mean things are going better at work? - Oh, no, he's still driving me crazy. - Didn't he just give you a raise? Yeah, but that was just a bribe so I wouldn't quit. A woman of principles. I admire that. - Gotta go. - Oh, no. - Damn it. What happened? - Bye, baby, I love you. - Tell her, you got three minutes. - My sweater shrunk. Come on, you've worn tighter things than that. That is not the point. The demon blood is not coming out. I can't keep replacing all my good clothes. I'm running out of my savings. Sister, you are preaching to the choir. Yeah, well, at least you've got a job. You know, I cannot afford to keep paying for this. Unless magic reimburses me. Hello? Personal gain, consequences. Do I need to remind you of the big-boob fiasco? No, my back still hurts. Don't worry, I won't do anything stupid. Paige, wait. What are you doing? - Piper, we've got problems. - Yeah, I know. You're late, - and it's your turn to watch the baby. - Not marital problems. Demonic ones. - What's taking him so long? - Patience, Jada. He'll be here. Maybe we should try a little target practice while we wait. I'd appreciate it if you didn't kill my pets. - Where have you been? - Gathering nuggets. My last two. Do you want them or not? - Name your price. - No price. All I ask is your allegiance in my bid to take over the Underworld. Consider this my grassroots effort at gaining support. What makes you think you can buy our support? Because in exchange, I'll give you everything you ever dreamed of. Do we have a deal? - But how do we know it worked? - Trust me. It's your lucky day. And there it is. Sorry, can't. Okay, remember, just the messenger. Why do I have the feeling Jason Dean's name - is about to be mentioned? - He had a few thoughts on your Internet dating article. And he wants the rewrite by tomorrow. I'm sorry. There is nothing wrong with this. Actually, there is. Didn't you see all the red? Look, this was your idea. I didn't wanna write the article in the first place. And that's how it reads. Okay, just because I didn't wanna write it doesn't mean that I didn't do my best. Is that so? Because it's an article about online dating, yet you somehow devoted four paragraphs to this week's meteor shower. Well, I think meteor showers are romantic, okay? And quite frankly, a lot less dangerous. Just because you've had some bad experiences doesn't mean they're all bad. Besides, you're a reporter. - You're supposed to be unbiased. - Okay, I am an advice columnist. And a very biased one, especially when it comes to romance. Oh, and you know all about romance, do you? Well, I know what women like. - Do you, now? - Yes. We like eye contact. Hello? Yeah. And conversation where you could actually see the other person's lips moving and long, late-night walks. And... And candles and roses... You don't think you can get that over the Internet? No, I don't. I think you can get CDs over the Internet, books, a purse maybe, - but not a date. - You got any plans later? You do now. I'm taking you on assignment. - What? Where? Why? - To prove something to you. Six o'clock sharp. I'll pick you up. There ain't no other option. If we stay, he'll come for us all. But abandoning our realm would mean abandoning the world as well. Who'd give out the luck? That's the bloody world's problem, if you ask me. I'm for saving our necks. There's more than just our necks at stake here. Sure, fine. But we're no good to anybody if we're dead. Right? What are we, a bunch of cowards? Don't forget, we speak not just for ourselves, - but for each of our tribes as well. - Aye. And I say we stay and fight the demon. Fight? But we ain't got no way to fight him. - You know that, Shamus. - That ain't true. If we all pool our good luck, then we just might luck into a way to get rid of him. Bollocks! Luck's unwieldy. There's no predicting what it may do. Who knows, we may end up even enraging the demon more. We don't have a choice. Our place in the world is at stake here, Finnigan. Our lands are being plundered. And our race may be annihilated by the devil himself. But we are leprechauns. Our blood flows green and our hearts beat gold. And we can cower in the shadows no longer. We must use our luck to find the light. - Are you with me, laddies? - Aye! Aye! Aye! Personal loss Should not be mine</i> Restore this sweater And make it Fine</i> I can't wait to try this on my credit rating. You sure that's a good idea? Wyatt, you should tell your daddy to not spy on Auntie Paige. We're only here because his mother is worried about you. - Should we be? - No. - I'm just settling a few debts, is all. - By using magic? Even Wyatt knows that's breaking the rules. Listen, Wyatt wouldn't be here if you hadn't broken the rules. Okay, that was different. You know it. That is a stupid rule, and so is the one that says I have to take a vow of poverty in order to be a full-time witch. Listen, I'm not trying to get rich quick, I am just making up for my losses. But, Paige, please. Piper and I have enough to deal with right now without the consequences of some spell you cast. Well, listen, if you and Piper weren't so busy sniping at each other all the time, maybe you would feel differently. We weren't sniping. We... Nice try, change the subject. Paige, there's more important things going on right now. The Elders say the good has been going through a curious string of bad luck lately and demons are getting the upper hand. Maybe you can try working on that. I have the perfect spell for that. I just wrote it to get out of my own predicament. "'To Find Good Luck': Finances have run amuck Creditors I soon must duck Paige, that's for personal gain. I cast a spell to Find good luck And hope my liFe will cease to suck" Don't tell your mommy about this, okay? A witch. It's about bloody time help got here. I was beginning to think our luck wasn't working no more. - Who are you? - Shamus Fitzpatrick. At your service, ma'am. What am I doing here? I was just looking for a bit of luck. So were we. Our magic must have intersected. And none too soon, I might add. We need your help. We? Who's "we"? Why, leprechauns. Leprechauns. Of course. Why would I think there'd be anything other than leprechauns needing my help? Gotcha! Leprechaun! Ever date a little person? - We gotta get out of here. - Allow me. Hold onto your knickers, darling. - Is that...? - Me very own. Lucky you. It's not just gold. It's magic. Pure luck. That's what you're looking at. Of course, it's just a spark to get things started. The rest is up to the recipient. See, leprechauns are like bees. They pollinate the world with luck. Sometimes the seeds don't stick, but other times they grow into full-blown hot streaks. Right? What she said. See, now can I have some luck? I think I've earned it. - Be careful. Not all luck is good. - She's right. A nugget can go either way, depending on our intention. So you hand out bad luck as well? Wouldn't that make you evil? Watch your tongue. How'd you like it if I started saying witches are evil? Leprechauns might be tricksters, but they're definitely not evil. Like it or not, the world needs bad luck. It keeps the natural order in balance. Finally, a man with a solid head on his shoulders. Bad luck helps people just as much as good luck. Maybe even more so. Because of adversity, people learn. They grow. Sorry, it's probably Cyrano. And this must be the demon Saleel. Yep, that's the wanker all right. Says here he's just a low-level reptile demon. We can vanquish him with a potion. Great, let's get rid of him so I can find a band. I think finding a band might be easier for you, honey. - Says here he's pretty elusive. - You're darn right he is. Otherwise, we would have heaped a load of bad luck on him by now. As it is, we never know when he's gonna strike. That's probably what the Elders are worried about. Saleel's been stealing the leprechauns' gold and giving it to other demons. But maybe with a little good luck you witches can put a stop to that. No, we don't need luck. We're gonna do it our way. Your way may not work. Are you with us, dear? Or are you writing love notes to your boyfriend? What is this, a coven or a daycare centre? - I got it. - Don't forget to sanitize the nipple. People, we're running out of time. Do I need to start crying like a baby to get some action around here? I'm sorry, but my little guy comes before your little guys. Yeah, well, without a little luck, my little guys aren't gonna last long, lassie. So let's try it my way. What happened? What did you just do to me? Why don't you find out for yourself. - You're Pat Benatar. - Oh, good, a fan. What a relief. - This is my husband, Neil. - Sorry to bother you. Our car broke down outside and our cell phone is dead. Just our luck, right? Listen, can we use your phone? We'd really owe you. To die for, aren't they? Mr. Demon. Sorry, all yours. There was a witch in your realm. Did you little rodents run to her for help? No, I swear. All we did was pool our good luck. Of course. Then you must have lucked into a Charmed One. Which means the power of three will be coming for me. Well, if leprechaun luck got me into this mess, I'm quite certain it can get me out as well. Yes, let me go and I'll show you where mine is hid. That's okay, I know how to find it. Who do they think they're fooling? No one's gonna go anywhere on those things. It's just something pretty for the baby to look at. Pretty? You humans. The minute you see a few colours, you get all excited. Rainbows aren't for looking at. If they were, they wouldn't be invisible. Rainbows aren't invisible, we can see them. Aye, when it rains maybe. But they're in the skies all the time. It's how we get around. We light them up with our shillelaghs. - That how you find your pots of gold? - And also our realm, our home. What's left of it anyway. Pat Benatar is in the kitchen on the phone with her manager, rearranging her schedule so she can play at P3. I am so sorry I doubted you. Just like a woman. You have to give them a gift to get anything in return. Okay, this is not working. I can't find Saleel. That's because we need something of his to make it work. What you need is luck, and lots of it. Not just the spark I can give you. But the kind you build from. By taking risks, - getting yourself on a serious roll. - A serious roll, huh? I think I know exactly where I can get one of those. Hit me. All right, ready to go? - Go where? - Come on, sis. Come on, where? Hey. Hey, where's me kiss? Women. Well, how about you, darling? Why not. For me? Who's it gonna be? George Clooney? Justin Timberlake? You ready to go? - That did not work. - Bollocks! It always works. - So I take it you don't wanna go out? - No, you know, it's funny. L... I can't. Because my cousin came into town, and he needs help with his other cousins. Oh, don't make a fuss about me. You two just go out and have a good time now. But I really have to stay here and help you with your problems. - You two are cousins? - Yes, we are very distant cousins. And it's about to get a lot more distant if you don't let me handle this situation. Well, I would let you handle it if you weren't handling it all wrong. You need to go, take some risks and leave the rest up to luck. Look, I don't wanna get in between family stuff, but it seems as if your cousin has got it all under control. - So let's go. - Oh, good idea. Where's Piper? Oh, she had to go. But she'll be back. Say, how've you been, Shamus? Long time. Don't even try it, Neil. I already hit you with me best shot. That's all you get. And seven. Winner, seven. Come on, winner, seven. Paige, there must be $50,000 there. Sixty is more like it. But Shamus said to take big risks. Here we have the craps table, we've got slots, we got the big-wheel thingy. - We can't lose. - Okay, maybe we should think - about quitting while we're ahead. - Quitting? You girls can't quit. We're in the middle of a streak here. Same lucky shooter. Same lucky shooter coming on a roll. Piper, I cannot ignore a cowboy. Besides, I feel something really big is about to happen. We just have to hold on and wait for it. All right, come on now, baby needs a new pair of shoes. And by "baby," I do mean me. Somebody's smoking. Will you marry me? Because that's how much I love you now. Simmer down, buckaroo. Look, I've gotta get back to the actual baby. And we need to be using this winning streak to find Saleel. Oh, just one more roll. Okay, fine. But we are not betting it all, because I can send Wyatt to college with this. Listen, the bigger risks we take, the more luck we have. Just watch this. Two. Crap, two. Snake eyes. Line away. Where did our luck go? Snake eyes, that's it. That's what we've been waiting for. - No, but we lost everything. - No, we didn't. I just figured out a way to find the demon... - stration. Demonstration. She knows what I mean. Come on. Okay, what are we doing here? Because I really need to get home. This shouldn't take very long. But then again, you're pretty stubborn, so maybe it will. Oh, wait a minute. I am stubborn? I'm stubborn? - Then what are you? - Stubborn. And a control freak. And pretty arrogant sometimes. You really know how to take the fun out of a fight, now, don't you? Look around. Tell me what you see. Why don't you tell me what you want me to see? Okay, fine. I see lots of couples, and they're kissing and drinking and dancing. What I don't see is the point. Oh, hey, get a room. Look, this is exactly my point. Love doesn't bloom through modems and hard drives. And, no, that is not a euphemism. What if I told you all these people met over the Internet? Right. Like you would have any way of knowing that. I would if I had, say, started and sold an online-dating service a few years ago. Maybe established an evening one night a week for people to get together and meet in a safe environment like this. Wait. So you brought all of these couples together? They brought themselves together. My company just made it a little easier for them. It's a complicated world, Phoebe. People have a hard time finding each other in it. And even when they do they sometimes don't act on their feelings because they're too afraid. Yeah, tell me about it. I admit, online dating isn't perfect. There are people who use it for all the wrong reasons. But most people are just looking for love. Just like the rest of us. Like the rest of us? You need to get started on that rewrite. Snake eyes? So what? I don't get it. Well, Saleel is a reptile demon, so we can use them to scry for him. See, I told you it was good luck. I guess, but couldn't snake eyes have been a winning roll too? You really want it all, don't you? Well, even luck doesn't bring you everything on a silver platter. You have to work at some things too. - Hey, did you find the demon? - Well, the vanquishing potion is done, so we're almost there. - Where's Leo? - Passed out with the baby, poor guy. He's more worn out than I am. So how'd you do? You must have developed quite a streak by now. Yeah, did you win the lottery? Ed McMahon show up at your house with a big check? - Actually, no. Nothing happened. - What? That's impossible. Did you take any risks? Get lucky with that fella? - What fella? - I think he's talking about Jason. And, no, I did not get lucky. Not that I would want to anyway. The burned child dreads the fire, eh? No. People, we just got lucky. Maybe it took "snake eyes" a bit too literally. - That would be bad luck, right? - No. This is. Oh, no, he's soured your luck. Hurry, throw the potion! - Now, what are the odds of that? - Don't worry. I'll fix this. Not so fast, little man. That's my rainbow now. Charmed Ones, my ass. We couldn't even save one leprechaun, let alone all of them. Well, it wasn't for lack of trying, Paige. Yeah. Well, still, Saleel is a low-level demon. You know, we had luck on our side, we had magic, we should have been... - You all right? - You okay? No, I am not all right. I was supposed to help Shamus, and instead, I got him killed. Paige, we were struck by lightning. We could've never seen that coming. How am I supposed to help them when even Mother Nature - is against us? - Okay, well, I can't get there right now so you're gonna have to handle it yourself. Call an electrician. There's a power failure at the club. We're shut down for the night. Do you have any idea how much money we're about to lose? What the hell is happening? Seems like a bad-luck streak, and it's picking up steam. Well, it can't get much worse than being struck by lightning. Oh, no? How about being hit by a meteor? Take Wyatt out of here. - But l... - No. No arguing. Just orb, okay? You were the only one that wasn't cursed with the bad luck. - He's safe with you. - All right. Well, I'll take him to Uncle Elders, he'll be safe there. - Didn't they ask you not to do that? - Yeah. But... ...screw them. All right, we're gonna have to turn our luck around fast. Paige, can you use that spell of yours to find more leprechauns? No, they pooled their luck just to make it work. I wish we knew how to get this thing to make a rainbow. Okay, well, since we can't do that, we're gonna have to turn our luck around the old-fashioned way. A little determination, some positive thinking, a little faith, a little... As you were saying? What are you doing? How dare you summon us. It's time to pay your debt to me. I need you to kill the Charmed Ones, get them off my back so I can go after more leprechauns. You're crazy. - Wait. Let's hear him out. - I've cursed the witches with bad luck. Which means they're vulnerable now. They should be easy pickings for you. If that's the case, why don't you take them out yourself? Because they'll be ready for me. But they won't be ready for you. Plus... ...I can guarantee that luck will be on your side. I got it. I got it. I got it. L... Okay. - Vanquishing potion done? - Well done. - What happened? - Big fire. Did you find anything? Yeah, I went rummaging through stuff, and I found a rabbit's foot, wishbone, horseshoe, four-leaf clover. Here's some salt for that over-the-shoulder thing. And the coup de grÃ¢ce: A charm bracelet. Lucky charms, Paige? It ain't the cereal, but it's the best I could do. And what about...? Phoebe. Oh, what happened? - Are you okay? - Oh, my bruises have bruises. I missed the step because I was trying to read my page. - Walk it off, walk it off. - Way to go, Cyrano 73. "I thought I'd try again. How about Saturday night?" He is asking me out again. If you're gonna do it, I'd go with Saturday, seeing as how we'll probably be dead by then. Wait a minute. Maybe I should say yes. Oh, Phoebe, this is not the time to be dating. It might exactly be the time. Maybe this was the risk Shamus was talking about. Accepting a date with a guy that you click with. That's not necessarily a giant risk. Well, for me it is. How do you know for sure he's not another demon? I don't know. Therein lies the risk. Okay. Y-E-S. And enter. Oh, yeah. I feel luckier already. Or not. Energy ball! No! Piper. One witch. Quick quiz, how many should I have? - Three. - Zero! They should all be dead. I never asked for prisoners. You miscalculated. The others found a way to turn their luck around. And Jenna died because of it. Am I supposed to care about that? We'll use this witch to lure the others. You still have more gold. We can make ourselves enough good luck to make them pay for what they've done. I have a better idea. I'll just do it myself. She's at his lair. And still alive, thank God. Okay, we should call Leo. No, we gotta keep the baby out of danger. But Saleel's got luck on his side, we've got nothing. No, that's not true. I think we've turned the tide. - How you figure? - Paige, if we could just turn our luck into a streak, then we can do this. Okay. We've got a few charms, and he's got who knows how much gold. It's just not gonna cut it. Unless we combine our own magic with it. - Take that. - Okay. What are you doing? I am gonna help you make this thing work so maybe you can get a vision off of it. Maybe you can see Shamus using it. I can't always get them on command. - Sometimes it's just... - Yeah, I know, luck. Just try. Okay. Come on. I can see him. - I can see him. - Come on. Far out, lady. Either we leave right now and try to save what's left of us, - or we stay and die like the rest. - That is the choice. Tell your tribes to take only what they need. - We leave at dusk. - Aye. It worked. Witches. What are you doing here? We're here because we need your help to save our sister. - And to save you. - Right, sure. Just like they saved Shamus. - Hurry, laddies. - No, wait. Please, you're stronger than that. Shamus knew it, and so do I. Shamus Fitzpatrick was a fool. And look where it got him. - Aye. - He was not a fool. He gave up his life because he believed saving you was worth the ultimate price. Shamus was a hero. He didn't see leprechauns, he saw giants. And he didn't see luck, he saw power. Please, you've pooled your luck once before. Do it again. Not for us, but for him. For Shamus. For Shamus. - For Shamus! - For Shamus! - For Shamus! For Shamus! - You did good.</i> - For Shamus! - Yes! For Shamus! Hi. Okay, hi. Shoo. Go away. See, I don't like snakes. At all. Go away. Shoo. - What are you doing? It's a trap. - We know. Piper. - Go. Go away. - The Charmed Ones. It's about time you got here. Yeah, well, we had to make a little pit stop somewhere over the rainbow. What is that supposed to mean? A leprechaun. Please. Now, laddies! No! A meteor. That's some real bad luck. Still tied up here, people. Here, I think this belongs to you. Actually, darling, I think Shamus would want you to keep it. For all you done for us, for saving our kind. Oh, you guys kind of did that yourselves. - It was your luck, after all. - Aye. But it was your fighting spirit that sparked it. The same spirit Shamus had. I wish I could accept that compliment, but I was just looking to be reimbursed, to tell you the truth. I felt like - magic owed me. - And do you still feel that way? No. I don't. Doesn't matter what brings a person, only what they leave with. Hey. Leo, what are you doing here? Who's watching Wyatt? I asked Paige to. I thought maybe you and I could spend some time together alone. Sounds great, but it's a little crazy in here. I can see that. Pat Benatar definitely brings in the crowd, huh? Yeah, at least I'll go out with a bang. What do you mean? Well, I've been thinking, and I've decided that I wanna sell the club. Not because I want to, but I feel like I have to. I mean, being a mother/Charmed One/ businesswoman is just one slash way too many. Something's gotta give. But this club is your baby too, Piper. You can't give it up. I don't really feel like I have a choice. I mean, I've been stretched pretty thin lately, and I think we're both feeling the strain. Yeah. I know. That's... That's why I asked the Elders for paternity leave. It's obviously never been done before. But they spent time with Wyatt and realized how important he is and decided to break the rules for him. That's weird. I mean, what happens to your other charges? You do have a career too. We'II, they'll temporarily reassign them. Except for you guys. And as for my career, it's not as important to me as we are. Honey, I don't think I can let you do this. Piper, it's one thing I don't wanna argue about, okay? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pat Benatar. You here on business? Actually, no, I'm not. - What are you doing here? - I'm meeting someone. - Really? Weird, me too. - I know. You're meeting me. - I don't understand. - I'm Cyrano 73. In the flesh, so to speak. Wait. Phoebe, let me explain. Okay. Sure, go ahead. Give it your best shot. I just knew you'd never go out with me if I asked you straight, right? Right? - Right. - So I had to find a way to see if you were interested in me without putting any pressure on you. I like you, Phoebe. I liked you the minute I laid eyes on you. And I know you like me. Or at least the part of me that brought you here. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come. - Jason, I don't know. - I'm not asking you to marry me. I just wanna buy you a drink. Come on, what have you got to lose? - Oh, I don't know, my job maybe? - That would never happen. Hey, you want Cyrano to disappear,
