- I didn't ask for your permission. It's only a matter of time, you know, before I get the box. Over my dead body. That's the thing with you Guardians, you're always dying for that damn box. Not always. Oh, come on! You can do better than that! - Phoebe? - Coming! Coming. I used castor root this time. It should dull all the senses. I don't care. Just give it to me. Thank you. Do you mind? Do I mind what? Being so psychotically perky, while I'm so miserable. Maybe it's psychosomatic. The inner ear has to do with balance. Maybe you're imbalanced because of the whole Magic School thing. Phoebe, come here. What was that for? Does that seem psychosomatic to you? Hey, big boy! I thought it was bath time. It is. Hey, buddy, that was... pretty funny, but I don't think Mommy's gonna think so. - What's going on? - I think the terrible twos have begun. Magical boys will be magical boys. Yeah. Well, try explaining that to his magical mom. You better orb back upstairs before Mommy turns you into a toad. What's the matter? She has a ringing in her ears. No, it's more like a jackhammer. Is it like a dentist's drill that goes in and out? - Yeah. - Why? You know what it is? Well, It could be your Whitelighter powers coming on. You could be hearing the call from the Elders. It used to drive me nuts. No, that's unacceptable. Well, you're half Whitelighter. You can't deny that. Yes, I can. I want nothing to do with the Elders, okay? If it is what I think it is, you're not gonna have a choice. The only way to find out is to talk to an Elder. You can't bring one here. Piper will freak out. Maybe you should meet at Magic School. Look, do you want it to stop or don't you? I'll go with you. Who are you? Please, you have to help me find it, before it's too late! - Find what? - Pandora's box. Well, I guess since Excalibur is real, I don't know why I'd be surprised that Pandora's box is as well. - Thank you. - How did you know to come to us? You're the Charmed Ones. Everyone in the magical community knows about you. Yeah, that's becoming a problem. Hey! Mister? Excuse me! Listen, what did I tell you about the orbing? Okay? Only when I say so! Thank you very much. Piper, you can't deny who he is, through the good, the bad and the annoying. Oh, I see you've been talking to Leo, haven't you? Just because you guys have different parenting styles doesn't mean you can take it out on me. Whose side are you on exactly? - Back to the box? - Right. Okay, let me guess, a demon took it. No, but we better find the next Guardian before one does. Guardian? Like you, we're chosen beings. Part of a magical lineage. One in which every generation a girl is born, meant to guard Pandora's box. Right, hence the name, Guardian. Got it. Only, each girl is trained by the previous Guardian, instructed carefully about the dangers and powers of the box. Except the next one hasn't been. I'm not following. When Katya the demon attacked me, the box, perhaps sensing the danger, disappeared on its own, moving on to its next Guardian. And you don't know who that is. No. I guess I wasn't expecting to survive. So, what does Katya want with the box? She wants to open it and release the world's ills, sorrow, famine, plagues. All the evil inside. What's to keep the new Guardian from accidentally doing the same, if she doesn't know what's in the box? Nothing. Darcy, it's all good. Stop stressing about him. I know, but how can I not? We're supposed to have this... big talk. What does that mean anyway? I was stupid to fall for him. Oh, come on, don't say that! I mean it, he's so not worth it. We got too much in life to be happy about to let Adam Bice get you down. You're right, as always. Oh, not always. You should check my French lit grades. Oh, that reminds me. I'm totally missing my chem lecture. - I gotta go. - Okay. This is him. What do I do? Just be strong. Don't let him get to you, no matter what he says! Call me later. Hello? What the heck? This is the global alert, Paige, one that only a Whitelighter can hear. You should be looking at this as if it was a gift, rather than a problem. A problem for me is when Leo rearranges my books. I would classify this as a root canal. Nevertheless, this is who you are, who you have become. I don't want to become it. Fix it! Fix it? I don't think she wants to hear the call, ever. That's impossible. She doesn't have a choice. It would be as if you wished to no longer breathe. If this ringing doesn't stop, maybe I don't want to. I just left Magic School. The last thing I want to deal with is you Elders. I know that in the past we have had our differences. But becoming a Whitelighter is as natural a part of your unfolding destiny as becoming a Charmed One. Perhaps if you explained to her why you called the alert. We sensed a great threat, one which we have not been able to isolate. That is why we need every Whitelighter to be vigilant. Well, not this Whitelighter. Okay, just make it stop already! You know, maybe if Paige helped a Whitelighter-to-be instead? That's a possibility. Why, what would that do? Helping others helps yourself... ...to find some clarity. Well, if clarity makes this noise stop... ...whatever, I'll try it. Come on, come on, what's taking so long? Relax, or I'll give you a timeout. Here, maybe this will help. Wyatt, timeout means no magic! Scry now, parent later. It would help if I wasn't the only one who had to discipline him. - Let me do this. - Please! We have to hurry. If the box has been opened or if a demon's found it... We won't let that happen. I promise. Look, we do this all the time. Maybe we need a stronger connection. I don't know what else to try. UC Berkeley, it's on the campus. Whoa! Where are you going? You've done your jobs. I have to go do mine. You saw where that got you last time. Let us go with you. I can't let you risk it. We can't let you risk it either, not as long as there's a demon after that box. All right. But I'll transport us there. It'll be faster. What about the Elders? - What about them? - It's Pandora's box. We should tell them something. All right, you tell 'em. Mommy needs a timeout. What's going on around here? Something's not right. She must have opened the box. It's the first wave of sorrow. ...not gonna pass my test! We have to hurry, before you become affected too. Please. Don't know what I'm gonna do... No, Darcy, we talked about this! In there. He's not worth it! Just a minute! Don't do anything stupid, okay? Promise? I'll be right there. Can I help you? Hi, my name is Piper, and this is... This is Nina. And we wanted to talk to you about something you... ...received, I guess would be a good word for it. Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. My friend's in trouble. If I don't... You have something more powerful than anything you have ever known. Okay, see, I was gonna go with the less intimidating tactic, but... - What are you talking about? - A box. Where is it? How did it come to you? I don't know, it was just there. What is going on? What is the? You haven't by any chance been taking some Greek mythology classes? Pandora's box. A gift the gods gave to Prometheus, one that contained all of the evils of the world, until Pandora unleashed it on an unsuspecting people. I hope to do the same. Crap! Oh, yeah, this is not good. This is not good at all. - This explains the global alert. - What are you talking about? The one that Paige heard and every other Whitelighter. Pandora's box exists solely to tempt. It's part of the Grand Design. If mankind chooses to open it again, so be it. But Guardians are supposed to protect it from being opened by demons. So then we should be fine. Piper and Nina... Nina never should have let it out of her sight. Well, apparently, she didn't have a choice. The box moved on to its next Guardian by itself. It can't move on unless the prior Guardian was already dead. Okay, you need to orb me to Piper immediately. Piper? Where are you? Oh, thank God you're okay. Who is she? Meet Hope, the real Guardian of the box. Too bad she doesn't have anything left to guard. Who? Who are you people? Okay, Hope, can you just try to calm down a little bit? We're the good guys, I swear. Oh, the good guys. Oh, then what was she? - She was a... - A demon pretending to be... A Guardian, just like you. Yeah. Nina's dead, by the way. Yeah, I figured. Not now. You... you blew up my dorm! With your hands! Yes, and I am very sorry about that. Now you're both calm, like this kind of stuff happens every day. - Well, it kinda does. - You see... We're witches. What? We can explain all of this in detail much later. - Now we need to get you going. - Fast, I'm feeling a little... Bummed? Yeah, I know. Nina, or Katya, I'm assuming, said that it was the first wave of sorrow from the box. A little appetiser? She's immune. She seems more freaked than bummed. Well, can you blame her? What are you two talking about? We just need to know one thing that's kind of important. Did you open the box? Only for a second. Some sort of dust came out, and then I shut it. From the sounds of the dorm out there, I'd say it was long enough. Shall we go? I am not going anywhere with you! You burst in here talking about Pandora's box and Guardians and witches and God knows what else! Now you expect me to leave with you? Okay, look, I know exactly how you feel. When we first found out we were witches, it was really scary because... Well, we didn't have anyone to guide us. But we could help you. You just have to come with us. Are you sure you don't want me to go down there with you? I'm fine, Dad. Go straight to Mommy. She's waiting in the lobby. Dad. Hey, hold the doors! Thanks a lot. I saw you on my way up, like an hour ago. Yeah, I've been looking for someone. What's happening? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! What? You're gonna blame me for this too? How dare you imply that's part of my agenda? I'm just standing here! - I'm scared! - It's okay. Oh, my God, the ringing stopped. That means... ...it's one of you. You... We've stopped. If my powers couldn't open the box, what would make you think you could? Hey, at least I didn't let the Guardian go. There must be a way. At least she can't put the sorrow she let out back in. Yeah, but she didn't let out enough. Within lies the power to destroy cities, crumble empires, devastate all that is good in the world. All this just to impress Zankou? Hey, just asking. For too long I've had to watch lesser demons rewarded, been denied my proper place in the forefront. No. Zankou will no longer be able to deny me after this. Why don't you just shapeshift into the Guardian? Taking the physical form of a Guardian doesn't make me one. No, it will know. Then what are you going to do? I'll make her open it for me. There's nothing in the Book on Katya. Scrying for the box did not work. Well, maybe we should try Magic School. What? Wait. Magic School? What is that? A place where you can learn more about your gifts. Are you a witch too? No, he's a... He's... he's a long story. One that worked out well. This is all so complicated. I know this is really hard to understand, - but this is what you're meant to do. - No, I'm meant to finish school, party, to have fun. I don't even know if I believe in magic. Where did he come from? Sorry, he's not supposed to do that without permission. Don't scare the pretty girl, okay? Okay, pal, listen, why don't you take Wuvey upstairs for a little nap, okay? - I'm getting out of here! - Hope, wait. Nothing that I can say is gonna make this any better. Can't you just make up a spell or something? Sometimes I wish I could. But then I realised all of this, you know, the good and the bad, makes me who I am, you know? It's my friend Darcy. I have to help her. You know, you could help a lot of people by finding that box. She's like my sister. I have to go. - Hope, wait! - No! - Oh, my God! - Phoebe, are you all right? Phoebe? You okay? Aren't you tired of asking me that? It does get a little repetitive. We gotta go get her. We can't force her to stay. Besides, she can obviously protect herself. What are we gonna do now? You gotta get the box back before Katya opens it. How are we supposed to stay calm? We're stuck. - Linda, please. - Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. - Well, it's not good enough! - Ma'am... No, I said I'm trapped. There's people all around. What did you say, I can't hear you. I said I'm trapped in an elevator. I can't just go. Besides, I don't want this ringing in my ears to come back. Wait, it stopped? When? Right when we got stuck. You need to stay there. No, wait! What about? Your sisters can handle it. You're there to help. Okay. Who am I supposed to help? Leo! Leo? - Damn these phones. - Yeah, mine's dead too. Looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Are you still there? Hello? Answer me! Just let them do their jobs. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here! This is my fault? You're the one who wanted counselling. The natives are getting restless. Yeah, looks like. So, what's your name? I'm Paige. Please don't let this be the person I have to help. Oh, fine! Kinda nuts from being stuck here like this, right? I want my mommy. Sweetheart, I know you do, but you know what? We're gonna be just fine. I promise. How do you know? Well, because I know things like that. - You okay? - I have asthma. Fantastic. I bet you have an inhaler in that purse, right? - My mommy has it. - Of course she does. - What are you doing? - Trying to get us the hell out of here! Brilliant idea. - At least it's an idea. - You could get hurt. - He's doing something. - What does that mean? - You're acting like a little girl. - I am not. What are we supposed to do? - You need your mother. - You'll have better luck with her. Okay. Darcy? I'm here. Wonderful devices, these things. It makes luring someone into a trap so... ...21 st century. - Where's Darcy? You'll see. You'd think there'd be something about Pandora's box in a place called Magic School. Leo's been reorganising. - Maybe we should get him to help us. - No, he's busy. What could be more important than this? Globally, nothing. Personally, I need him to wrangle Wyatt for a day so he can see what I'm talking about. Piper, you know what Wyatt is going through is completely normal. No, temper tantrums are normal, uncontrollable crying is normal. Orbing all over town is not normal. - He's not orbing all over town. - Not yet. It's not that I have a problem with him being magical. If I did, I would have bound his powers at birth. He needs to learn that he can't use his powers whenever he wants. And Leo needs to understand that too. I think he does. I think he deals with it differently. We'll see how Mr Mom deals with it after he's been chasing around the kid, now that Leo can't orb. You guys will figure it out. You have been much more optimistic lately. Yeah, I guess I have hope. I mean, we lost Hope, the person, but I have... you know... I got it. I found something. - About the box? - No, the demon. Nothing new. She's a shapeshifter. We found out the hard way. Won't happen again. She used to work for demonic dark lords, then she went rogue. How very enterprising of her. She probably just wants to make a name for herself. Why is it that every demon who is trying to make a name for themself has to go and try to end the world? Why don't we ponder that fact while we scry for her? Even if we find her, we have no way of getting there. We're short an orber. Well, we'll have to come up with something. I mean, this place is called Magic School for a reason, right? I won't hurt you, Hope. I promise. I know you're new to all this. And I know all this can be very scary. Where's Darcy? She's not a part of this. Isn't she? I mean, she's merely a pawn in all this. A pawn like you are. Whatever they told you, I know it was a lot to handle. You know, I've been told that I'm part of something. "A greater purpose", I think they called it. But you know what? It was all a lie. I mean, who the hell do they think they are, ruining your life like this, telling you that you're meant to watch after Pandora's box? I don't even know what it really is. You shouldn't have to know. You didn't ask for this. It's unfair. - I just want my life back. - And I can help you get it back. All you have to do is help me. Open the box, and you'll be free from it... forever. But won't that? End all this craziness? That's what you want, isn't it? To go home... with your friend. Go ahead. Open the box. No. I can't. - I won't! - Fine. I tried asking you nicely. Now I'll have to make you to do it. Lucius! Darcy? I'm scared! - Don't hurt her. - You know what I want. What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? What if the elevator starts? Relax, sweetheart. I know what I'm doing. Hello? Is anybody there? What's going on? What is taking so long? Okay, honey, I need you to breathe. - Just breathe. - I'm scared! Damn it! - Big man. - Can you two get along? - It hasn't happened in three years. - You have to air out all our problems? Airing out our problems is your biggest concern? Oh, my God! Okay... He's not breathing. Oh, God. There's no pulse. Oh, my God! - Come on, sweetie... - What are we gonna do? - Do you know CPR? - No. Help me. You're gonna learn. - All right. - I need you to sing to her. - Sing? - Just sing. Get her breathing in order. Anything, just sing! Put your hands in the xiphoid process. - The what? - Honey. You can do this, honey. All right. Come on. Push down, five times for every breath. - All right. - Go. One, two, three, four... Come on, sing with me. Good job. He's awake. He's alive! Good job. - Wendy! - Daddy! You okay? He was electrocuted. We gave him CPR. Everybody looks okay, except for one person. Possible cardiac arrest. We're gonna treat it... Thanks. Open it, or your friend dies. It's done. - But you said... - That I wasn't going to hurt you? Yeah. I lied. Since the next Guardian hasn't been born yet, and with you dead, there won't be anyone around to put everything back. We're too late. Minions. Hope, what are you doing here? She forced me to open the box. She took my friend, Darcy! Where is she? That way. Darcy? Where are you? Darcy? Darcy! Darcy, where are you? Get me out of here. Okay, well, I guess your day trumps my day. Thanks for bringing me home to clean up the mess though. Is anybody else feeling blue? It's the effects of the box being opened. There's a demon on the loose. The longer he is, the more we're all gonna be affected. Yeah, exactly. This is crazy. We need to leave. You're safer here. No. It's okay, Darcy. They can protect us. Hope, that thing was trying to kill us. She wants to kill them. - We're sitting ducks here. - Not as much as out there. As long as Katya knows that Hope can put the evils back in the box, she is a large target. Which means you are too. No, not if she doesn't go along with it. No one says that you even have to care about this stupid box any more. Actually, she does, you see, because it's her birthright. Says you. Hope, listen to me, okay? We don't even know these people. For all we know, they could be the demon. That's ridiculous. Is it? She's done it before. That's what she does, right? Right? Hope, we can only trust each other. - You're right. - Hope... - No, actually, I think she is right. - Phoebe! We can't make her do something. This is her path, to either follow or not. But before you leave, let Paige show you how to contact us, God forbid anything... See you downstairs. Wyatt? What's going on? I'm not sure. Where's Wyatt? He... - Excuse me. - Sure. What's taking them so long up there? I don't know. What's your hurry? I just want to get out of here as soon as possible. Okay, let's go. - I hope you know what you're doing. - Trust me. What? What's the matter? This is getting to be way too easy. Hope! I'm okay. Actually, not for long. Okay, you heard me say it, and I meant it. I do not want anything to do with that box! I swear! Oh, but you will. In time. You'll come to believe in yourself, your powers. Just like Pandora did. And then you'll want to get the box back, put the sorrows back. But, see, I can't let that happen. You won't have a choice. What? You think you can stop me? Dagger! But... Guardians can't orb! No, but Whitelighters can, and into anything they want too... ...or anybody. Sorry we haven't met before. I've been engaged! What?! What is going on here? It's okay. It's okay. I'm here to get you home, all right? Pandora's box! I need you to give this to Hope for me. I'd give it to her myself, but... ...there's somebody I have to see. Home! Darcy? Someone tell me what the hell is going on. That's her. Just didn't want to make the same mistake twice. Okay, Hope, we need your help. You're the only person that can do this. - I don't... - Listen to me. This is your destiny. Just like becoming witches was ours. I just... don't know if I can do this. You're forgetting something about Pandora's box. According to myth, when all the sorrows were released, there was one thing left at the bottom of the box. Hope. You can do it. Told you you could do it. Thank you. How are the ears? Better, thank you. It was risky, sending me off to help a future Whitelighter. - Was it? - Yes. We almost didn't get Pandora's box. - But you did get it back. - Yes. Which proves you can handle Charmed and Whitelighter responsibilities. - I don't see... - Didn't it make you feel proud? - Of course I did. - And you did it all by yourself, without your sisters. Maybe this is what you have been searching for, your separate identity. Being a Whitelighter can give you that and more. - Like what? - Fulfilment. You're a natural, Paige. Everything you've been and done has been preparing you to be a Whitelighter. Everything you needed to help those people has been inside you all along. Well, it did feel good to save them. Then don't fight that. Embrace it. Not for me, not for the Elders, but for yourself. Think about it? Wait. Just out of curiosity, who was the future Whitelighter I was supposed to save? You were. So, how was your day? Very funny. Actually, it was all right, and it calmed down a bit once Wyatt tried to orb a toy to himself and hit himself in the head. Oh, no. It was just a little bump, but... ...it was enough to teach him that he shouldn't do it again. Is that your way of telling me that magical boys will be magical boys again? No. We both need to teach him when and were to use his powers. Though it's not gonna be easy. And on the other hand, we do need to realise that he is who he is, and even though I want a normal family, I don't want it at the expense of them finding their own identities. Chris here is gonna be coming into his powers shortly. Could get a little nuts around here. As opposed to what? We'll deal with it as it comes, together. And until then...
