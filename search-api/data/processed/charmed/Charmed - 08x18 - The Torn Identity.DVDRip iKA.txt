kind of cramped here. No, it's bigger than a cave. I mean, it works for me if it works for you. I don't even come here that much anymore. In fact, I don't think I ever wanna come back. Well, can't you just get a bigger dorm? No, not the dorm, I mean school. So much has happened. Billie, you can't quit now, you have to graduate. Mom and Dad would want you to. Well, Mom and Dad aren't here anymore, are they? I'm sorry. I'm just a little tired right now. I know. This has been really hard for both of us. I just still can't believe they're gone. I mean, I feel like if I... It's not your fault, okay? A demon murdered them. Yeah, but if I wouldn't have left them, maybe they would still be here. Or if Piper hadn't called you away. - This is not her fault. - Oh, it isn't? You know what, you just stay here, okay? You rest. We're gonna get through this, I promise. I promise, together. I would have never been able to get through this week without you. Well, I'd still be living in a cave without you. - I'll be back. - Where are you going? I'm gonna help my little sister get some peace of mind. I mean, the police might think that Mom and Dad are an unsolved case, but we know better. The Noxon demon can't be vanquished. You know that. I'll hit him with a potion and send him to the astral plane, like Piper did to the other demons. But she can't find him. Then I'll help her, Billie. You let me worry about the demons, and you just get some rest. The Noxon won't be easy to find. He's on the run, he's cagey. But we will scour the underworld. Whatever it takes to find him. I don't like it. Vanquishing a fellow demon? We're not going to vanquish him. Not until we can use him to separate the other sister from the Charmed Ones. Yeah, but why do we have to do what the Triad wants anymore? - They're dead. - Nevertheless, we do what we're told. Says who? What's going on? - Is there a problem? - No. Not anymore. We're here to help. Hey there. What took you so long? I was dropping the boys off at Dad's. Why? What are you doing here? Oh, you know, just in the neighbourhood, thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing. - How go the battles? - The battles? Yeah, you know, Ultimate Power, ultimate threat, ultimate stuff. Need any help? You just got back from your honeymoon, and you want to talk about demons? Well, it is what we do, isn't it? You're giving me a very suspicious look. You know, you're a very suspicious person. - And you're avoiding the question. - I am not. All right, fine, maybe I am. But it doesn't mean I don't want to help out of the goodness of my own heart. I think you need to talk to Henry. About what? About demons? No, about whatever it is you came here to talk to me about, which you should be talking to him about. I can't tell him about it because it's just gonna hurt his feelings. That's not a good enough reason. The problem is that it's not Henry's fault at all, okay. He's amazing. I love him. I can see why you're avoiding him. See, the thing is it took me so long to forge an identity separate of you and Phoebe, I'm just... I guess I'm kind of afraid of losing myself in the marriage. So you're burying yourself in demons? It could work for me. I don't approve of the way you're handling this. Anyway, I think I have a lead. If the Noxon demons killed Christy and Billie's parents, somebody else had to send them to do it. Because they were originally after the Magic School kids, right? Right. So why change their m. o. Unless somebody told them to? Whoever it is that's after the key to the Ultimate Power. Do you think they were really after Christy? Absolutely, which means the Noxons know who's behind it all. And maybe who we'll have to fight to get Leo back. So, what's the plan? We're going to find that genetic freak of a demon, and tell him we'll do to him what we did to his friend unless he talks. What can I do, besides ponder the state of my marriage? You need to go to the underworld and see if you can find him. - Done. - Be careful. What have we here? Who are you? - Stay back. - Or what? She's not just clutching your leg, she's clutching your powers. It'll come in handy when I feed off of you. What's a low-level demon like you doing in this neck of the underworld? I'm not low-level. I'm working with the Triad. - The Triad? - Yeah, yeah. I'm helping them harness the Ultimate Power, so if you're smart... - The Triad's dead. - Right. Exactly. Which means I'm the only one left who knows where to find the Ultimate Power. Release me and all the power in the world is yours, I promise. Well, why don't you get it for yourself? The power has yet to emerge. Till it does, I must hide. Demons are after me, and powerful witches. The Charmed Ones. I'm telling the truth, I swear. Well, seeing as how you're so neatly tied up at the moment, I think I'll just leave you here, see who comes looking. No. Come back. They'll find me! I'm telling you, I found him. I found you a match and he could be the man of your dreams. Phoebe, hello? Am I making myself clear? Hello, I'm working. Do you see me working? Yeah, yeah, so am I. - How about Michael? - Coop. Also happens to be the style editor at your paper, no less. Which probably makes him gay, okay? - I know who he is, and no, thank you. - He's not gay. Trust me, I wouldn't be setting you up with him. So why don't you go out with him, huh? Well, maybe because I don't like to date people at the workplace. Did you ever think of that? Yeah. Yeah, of course I thought about that. I think about everything when it comes to matchmaking. Besides, you met Jason at work, and Leslie, and Dex. Yeah, and those didn't go too well for me, did they? Yeah, but not because you worked with them. It's because of, you know, other reasons. Anyway, I'm not asking you to marry the guy, just go out with him. Let me see how close I am to figuring you out. What have you got to lose? Take a risk. It's just the whole process, you know? Like dating and then opening up to someone and then having to tell them that I'm a witch, them fainting. It's just not fun. You are so confusing to me. I don't get it. First you tell me you don't wanna date magical beings, and then you don't wanna date mortals. Who's left? Yeah, yeah, it's not funny. You have any idea how hard it is to find a match for you, Phoebe? You are a smart, successful, gorgeous woman with a great sense of humour and an amazing strength. And look at you, you're lounging around in a tracksuit with a pencil in your hair, and glasses and... You're so beautiful. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to see what Michael sees in you. Or would see in you, if you'd go out with the guy. Okay, but what about my column? And everything Piper's going through? I mean, doesn't love pale in comparison to all of that? No, you don't get it. I don't know how many times I need to tell you. Love doesn't pale in comparison to anything. It makes the world turn and the flowers grow... Okay, smart aleck, do me a favour. Just be open next time love comes knocking, okay? Hope it's not my sister. Oh, hey, sweetie, how are you? Hi, I've been better. You look exhausted. Come in. - I'm going to be prepping Michael. - Okay. So how was it? Oh, just about as good as a funeral can be. I just... Can I hang out here? I don't wanna be alone right now. Of course you can, yeah. You can stay here as long as you want. Hey. Okay, so I found the Noxon, but we better hurry, in case he moves. Well, you might want to call Henry first. He's called three times since you left. Yeah, he called my cell, you know, left a message. But I'll get him when I come back. So now you're avoiding his phone calls? Paige. No, I'm not avoiding him, but I told you, I don't really know what to say to him yet. Besides, it's not his problem, it's mine. Well, it is his problem if you're not taking his calls. Do you want to let this demon get away or what? Okay, fine. Just let my years of marriage experience go to waste. - Fine, let's go. Here. - Go where? Oh, hey, Christy. How are you doing? - I'm not doing very well. - Where's Billie? She's back at her dorm room, she's resting. That's weird, Phoebe just called and said she was at her apartment. I see. So where are you on finding the demon you let kill my parents? Whoa, hang on. We didn't let anybody kill... Actually, we found him, but if we don't wanna lose him, - we need to go right now. - All right, well, then I'm going. But I get to be the one who sends his sorry ass to the astral plane. Actually, no. We don't wanna vanquish him, we need to question him. It's more important to find out who put him up to this. Who cares? Who wants to talk to him? I want him dead. I understand that, but we can't ignore the fact that this could be connected to something else, like saving Leo. So that's what this is about, saving your husband. Well, yeah, but... If we don't vanquish him, he could escape. Well, I realise that, but we need to get some information out of him first. Let's go. What are you doing? I'm not gonna let you take this away from me. You shouldn't be here. The demons are after you. - I don't care. - Look, stop it. We're not gonna let him get away. You need to just back off. - Gosh. - Okay, listen, you have one chance and one chance only to tell me who sent you and why. - Don't know what you're talking about. - The hell you don't! - Say the spell. - No! - Say it! - Stop it. Demon of fire, demon of pain I banish you to the astral...</i> Looks like you were telling the truth. Damn it. - Are you okay? - Yeah. It's not me I'm worried about. I knew he would get away! Christy, just let me heal you, okay? Right! After she just tried to kill me? I didn't try to kill you, it was an accident. That was no accident. Okay, listen, you're right. It wasn't. But I didn't mean to hurt you, okay? - I just couldn't let you vanquish him. - Well, now he got away. Look, Christy, you didn't leave me a choice, okay? This is my husband, and that demon... Killed my parents! Why am I even explaining this to you? - It's not like you care. - Of course we care. We care about you and we care about Billie. Billie's been like a sister to us. Well, Billie's not your sister. - Christy, please... - Look, just stay away from me. And stay away from Billie. Well, that went swimmingly. There was nothing else I could do. Right? No, you did what you had to do. Still, I don't expect her to understand. She doesn't know Leo and she barely knows us and all she wants is revenge. - Can you blame her? - No. But it doesn't mean anything. We still have to find the Noxon again. - We'll just figure out who took him. - Okay, I'll check the "Book. " - It's Phoebe. I'll fill her in. - You know where to find me. - Hello. - Any luck with Leo? No, but we did manage successfully to get Christy to hate us. - What? How? - Well, we were going after the... Hold on a second, okay? - Hello? - Hi, Paige. Where have you been? Hey, hi, honey. Just kind of a bad demon fight. - Can you hold on a second? - Wh...?</i> - Pheebs, that's Henry. - Okay, so quick, what happened? Christy wanted to vanquish the Noxon, but we needed to talk to him... - Wait, you found the Noxon? - Kind of, sort of.</i> He got away, but that was only after... Okay, this is gonna take a minute. Hold on a sec. Hey, can I call you back? No, that's why I'm calling you, because you haven't called me back yet. Yes, okay, I'm sorry about that. Paige, are you mad at me? Did I do something that I don't know I did? No, I'm not mad at you, not at all. It's just... What, what, what? Hold on a second. Phoebe, forget about Christy. What I really need your help with is Henry. - Phoebe? - Still me, Paige. - What is going on? Talk to me. - Nothing, it's nothing.</i> It's really nothing. It's just... You're completely perfect. You are. Can I call you later? That would really be the best thing. Okay, I'll do that. Bye. - Phoebe? - Yeah. I need professional help. Can I borrow your Cupid? A little help here, please. Creo! Where are you? - Sorry, I was looking for the Noxon. - Well, you're a little late. The Charmed Ones already found him. What happened? Piper attacked me. I followed her to the Noxon, she wouldn't let me vanquish him. But you're not supposed to vanquish him. We need him to turn your sister against the Charmed Ones. Yeah, I know. I know. But I was upset, okay? He killed my parents. But now you need to focus on your sister. And that wound just might help. It could help to convince her that the Charmed Ones are truly bad. I don't know, she's pretty attached to them. All the more reason to try and save her from them as soon as possible, as the Triad said you must. They're using her, Christy. You know that. And you also know that the two of you are the only ones who can stop them. Do you really think so? It is your destiny. One that you will not fulfil unless you get your sister away from them by any means necessary. Well, you better get to the Noxon before they do, or you'll have to come up with another plan. I'll worry about finding the Noxon. You worry about saving Billie. I must confess, you're far more valuable than I imagined. Let me go. I wasn't lying about the Ultimate Power. I proved... Then I should be able to fetch a high price for you. They'll come back for me. - It's just a matter of time. - I doubt that. My lair is a labyrinth of secluded caves. I should be safe long enough to figure out what to do with you. But we aren't dealing with ordinary witches. - The Charmed Ones... - Make you all the more valuable. I could trade you for immunity from them. Or perhaps I could sell you to demons in exchange for powers. The possibilities are limitless. Come on, seriously, what's the harm in asking Phoebe out one more time? Look, I don't think she's into me. I don't want to push it. See that? You're being sensitive. Phoebe loves sensitive. Yeah, then how come she has an excuse every time I ask her out? - She's just playing hard to get. - Really hard to get. Come on, isn't she worth it, huh? - Caring, funny, talented. - Hot. You can't say "hot. " Women want romance, poetry. See, I'm not much of a poet. You don't have to be. All right? Just think about Phoebe and let the poetry come to you from what you see. She's ethereal, you know. Rose-petal lips, slender neck, fiery, passionate eyes. And when she laughs, I mean, doesn't that just make you feel like you can fly? Maybe you should ask her out. Me? No. No. Come on, it's against the rules. Then maybe you ought to go work for another dating service. You're missing the whole point. You wanna go out with a woman like Phoebe, you can't just ask her out. You have to woo her. I don't usually woo. Well, you're gonna have to if you wanna go out with her. It's easy, I'll walk you through it. Meet me at Phoebe's house with a dozen red roses, long-stemmed. Trust me. What are you doing here? Come on, go, chop-chop. What are you waiting for? Coop, I need to talk to you. - Kind of in the middle of something. - Okay, but it's kind of an emergency. What? What do you mean, did something happen to Phoebe? No, no, no. Nothing happened to Phoebe. It's an emergency of me. Well, the Elders didn't really send me down here to work with the whole family. Look, please? I really need your expertise, Coop. How much help could you need after only two weeks of marriage? Henry keep leaving the toilet seat up? No, it's not Henry. It's me, okay? It's me. I'm so used to having my own identity, you know, and being super independent, and now it's not just a "me," it's a "we," and I'm kind of freaking out on that, and I'm taking it out on him and I can't do that. It will work itself out. You've talked to him about this, right? I've tried to talk to him about it, but it just comes out wrong. Paige... ...I'm really busy here, so give it some time. I don't have time, okay? I really, really don't. Isn't there something you can do? Oh, yeah, there is one thing. What? Please, I'm open to anything. All right, you got it. - Henry? - Paige?</i> Where are you? - That's a very good question. - I know.</i> Oh, no. Okay, go to a mirror. - Mir... Why? - Please, just do this.</i> Why do I have to look...? - What the...? - Oh, God. - I'm in your head. - I can see that. Paige, what's going on? Coop! Michael? Hey. What are you doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm wooing you. - You're what? - Well, you deserve it, don't you? And you're not just anyone, you're special. You're not just anybody, you're special. - You're one in a million. - One in a million. I'm not leaving here until I get you to go out with me. And I'm not giving up until I get you to go out with me. Wow, Michael, I had no idea you were such a romantic. - No, I'm not. - I'm hot. I'm sorry, you're what? No, I'm not. No, I mean, I'm not. I'm not really a romantic. Romantic. Really. It's just that... - You bring it out in me. "... you" bring it out in me. - Every time I see you, every... - Every time you walk past. Every time you walk past. You're all I ever think about. And it's been that way from the moment I laid eyes on you. The way you walk, the way you smile. The way you walk, the way you smile. How you help so many with your words. The way you help so many with your words. I knew I had to do everything I could to get you to go out with me. - And that's why I'm here now, - That's why I'm here now, - hoping that you can't turn me down. - Hoping you can't turn me down. I don't know what to say. Just say yes. Say yes. Well? - You know what, I have to go. - Wait, but... Listen, thank you so much for coming, it means so much to me and will you leave the flowers by the door? - Yeah. - Okay. - What now? - Just keep trying. She's worth it. Believe me. Come on. What's going on? I don't know. - Christy, hey, what's wrong? - Billie, I need to talk to you. - What happened to you? - Piper attacked me. What? Okay, you know what, come in and we're gonna talk about this. No, I'm not coming in. Billie's coming out. I still don't know why you didn't let Paige just heal you. Oh, right, after what Piper did to me, I don't think so. But still... Okay, just please just stop and just tell me exactly what happened. It's real simple, Billie. I tried to kill the demon that killed Mom and Dad, and she wouldn't let me. - That doesn't make any sense. - Does this make sense? Listen to me, Piper is so obsessed with saving her husband, she doesn't care who gets in her way. But I don't believe she'd ever hurt you. - Yeah, well, believe it. - I have to be missing something. Fine, then let's go to the house, you can ask them yourself. No, I'll go. You're way too upset. Billie, you can't trust them. - That's not true. - Oh, really? Face it, they don't care about what we want. They care about what they want. Let me just go back to the house and talk to them myself. Just meet me at the dorm, okay? Please. I still don't understand why you couldn't just talk to me. - Why did you have to use magic? - Well, I didn't mean to. I don't have time to talk about this right now, I have to go help Piper. You should have thought about that before you jumped in my head. I didn't jump in your head. Coop put me in there! Right, right, because you were losing yourself? What does that even mean? I thought things were going great between us. Hey, Paige, I love being married to you, okay? And I love being married to you too. That's the problem.</i> How could that be a problem? Because I've never loved someone so much before.</i> And I love you so much that I'm afraid of losing me.</i> But maybe you're gonna find something new, like I did. - You did? - Yeah.</i> Isn't that the point of marriage? Henry, go to the mirror. Paige, I want you to stay the woman that you are. I fell in love with the woman that you are. But at the same time, I think we can make each other stronger. That was Coop's point too. Sorry I snapped at you. I'm sorry too, my little baby, baby, baby... - Baby, baby... - You okay, Henry? Dennis, I... - Trouble with the missus. - Trouble with the missus.</i> I guess that means I don't have to listen to you gush about her for once. - You gush about me? - Yeah, I do.</i> No, you don't. You won't. You checked in on time, so now you can go. And we'll see you the same time tomorrow. Great. Yeah, right. - Yeah, see you. - Okay. Get home safe. We have to do something about this, fast. I couldn't agree more. - Whoa. - "Whoa" yourself. How'd you do that? Ask if they've had any luck finding the Noxon.</i> Hold it a second. I think it'll be easier if I just talk to them myself, honey. Honey? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - No, you're not and neither am I.</i> Why are you talking to yourself? No, I'm not. Paige is in my head. Tell her I went to Coop for advice. Please, I can handle this, Paige. - Sorry. - Coop did it.</i> Coop did it. Of course he did. Great. Well, you need to get him to undo it, because we need the power of three to find the Noxon. I might be able to do it from here. Paige thinks that she... Headache. Paige thinks that she might be able to do it from where she is. - Billie. - We need to talk. I know, I'm sorry about your sister, but how are you? How am I? I'm not so good. How could you attack my sister? She didn't leave me much of a choice. She was gonna vanquish the demon. You just thought you'd vanquish her too? - No, I didn't. - Look, we know how you feel, but revenge is not the only thing right now. That's what Christy said. Look, I wanna find Leo too. I really, really do. But not at the expense of her. Okay, well, then she needs to understand that it can't all be about what she wants. Right, because it seems to be all about what you want. - That's not fair. - Isn't it? Okay, look, don't you wanna figure out who killed your parents? Yes, I do, but that's not what you care about. All you guys care about is finding Leo. - You don't care about me. - Billie, what are you doing? I'm gonna vanquish the Noxon. - No, you're not. - Are you gonna blow me up too? Hold out your hand and call for the vial.</i> Nobody's blowing anyone up here. - That didn't stop her last time. - Now.</i> Vial. That was cool. Billie, you come back here. Now what do we do? We gotta find that demon before they do. Is everything okay? You were right. We are on our own. - Any luck? - No, nothing. There's tons of potions to take us to the underworld, but nothing on the Noxon. Are you scared about being here? This place is usually crawling with demons. I think between the two of us, we have enough power to defend ourselves. Besides, we can't count on anyone else. So we don't have any other choice, do we? Yeah, I guess, but it's still kind of creepy. Do you know where he is? No, but I'm afraid the Charmed Ones are close to figuring it out.</i> - Well, what if they find him first? - You'll know where to find him too.</i> If you use your powers to follow them,</i> it may be your only chance to save her from them.</i> It's no use, there's nothing here. What are we gonna do? - I wonder... - What? Maybe I can listen in on them, see if they found him yet. - You can do that? - Yeah. I mean, if it's okay with you. Yeah, why not? Ancient powers, we summon thee We, the power of three</i> And seek your help in finding The demon who is in hiding</i> - Nothing. - I'm sorry, guys, I think it's my fault. Maybe I should try saying it again. Paige thinks that maybe she should try... Forget it. We need to get her out of there. Call him. Do I have to? Okay. Cupid! Look, I know you're out there, watching everything I do. Coop! Oh, lift me from the grass I fail, I die, But thy loving kisses Rain on my lips.</i> - What are you doing? - I'm just reciting what Michael wrote. He left this for you at the door. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, never mind that, we need... My heart beats loud and fast Oh, press it to thine own again, Where it shall break at last</i> Michael didn't write this. Yeah, you're right. I wrote that a couple of hundred years ago or so. Some of my best work. Yeah, okay, listen, we need your help. You gotta get Paige out of Henry. Yeah, but are you sure they worked through their issues? Yes, they have. All right. Oh, dear. - Hey. - Hey, you okay? - I'm okay. - Good. But you should probably go. All right. Good luck. Well, you should probably go too. - What about love? - Go! - I mean, really. - Oh, you got truffles. Yes, I did. - Okay. - Okay. Ancient powers, we summon thee We, the power of three</i> And seek your help in finding The demon who is in hiding</i> They found him. Hurry, throw the potion while I'm still channelling them. Oh, no, you don't! What happened? What's going on? You have exactly five seconds to live unless you tell us who you're working for. I don't know what you're talking about. - Four. - Three. - Two. - All right, all right. - I'll talk. - Not so fast. - Leave him alone, he's ours. - Ours? - Billie, we're all on the same side. - Are we? - We're not letting you vanquish him. - Works for me. And we're not gonna let you take him alive, either. This is absurd. What are you doing? Why are you twisting what we're all about? She's not twisting anything. She's the one that tore me away from protecting my parents so she wouldn't bother the two of you. Billie, I swear, if I knew what would happen... You would have used me the same way to get what you wanted. And I'm sick of being used. - No. - We don't need the potion.</i> What do you mean? You can use your power to amplify mine.</i> What's going on? Okay, did they just vanquish the demon that can't be vanquished? What does that mean? I think that means we just found the Ultimate Power. - Hey. - Hey. - Tough day at the office? - Oh, well, you know, you let a young witch into your family, teach her everything that you know, only to be betrayed by her. Yeah, it was a rough day. I guess love is pretty low on the list, then, huh? Actually, no. I mean, it can only make me stronger, right? Yeah. There's something I want to tell you, but I'm not sure if I will be able to articulate it well. Maybe I can help. No, actually, it's something that I have to say. And that you have to hear. I've been having these feelings, these really intense feelings that I haven't had for a really long time. And it's scary, mostly because the person that I'm having these feelings for is so unexpected. I don't know if it can work. But you gotta follow your heart, right? You tell me. God, it has got to suck to be Cupid. You know, never finding a love of your own, it's gotta be so hard for you. I'm sorry, what? You know, because of all the rules and stuff, it's just I would think it's gotta be really hard. So you were talking about you and? Michael. Yeah. Yeah, who else would I be talking about? No. You know, you just made it sound like it was someone unexpected. Well, yeah, you know, I don't wanna be with anyone magical, just because of everything that I've gone through in my life. Yeah, what changed your mind? I think maybe watching what Paige and Henry are going through and how they're making it work, and honestly, you. I mean, you knew. You had to hear the things that he was saying to me on the balcony. They were just so sweet. Actually... Yeah, I always knew he had it in him. I guess that's why you picked him for me, huh? Yup. It sure is. So I guess my work here is done. Guess I better get going. Thank you for everything you've done for me. No. It was my pleasure. - Good luck, huh? - Bye. Hey. It's gonna be okay, you know. Oh, yeah? I'm not so sure. It was right there in front of us the entire time and we didn't see it. How were we supposed to see it? It's Billie. She's one of us. Still, with Christy and their powers, the Triad. We just missed it. And now I hope it's not too late. Not too late for what, exactly? To stop them. No. No, Piper. We can't vanquish them. They're not demons, they're people. People the Triad targeted to take us out. - You don't know that for sure. - Don't I? Think about it. It makes complete sense. I can't give up on Billie. I'm not gonna give up on Billie, not yet. She's been through so much, they both have. Maybe they'll come around. I have to go. Henry's waiting for me. Look, we're gonna figure this out, okay? It's what we do.
