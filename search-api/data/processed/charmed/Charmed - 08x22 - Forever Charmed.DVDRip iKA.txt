- No, there's gotta be something. - There's not. And they can't undo what's already been done. Are you sure the boys are okay? I'm sorry you had to come back to this. Dumain. - Good, you're still here. - Billie, what happened? - Where's Christy? - She's gone. What about the Charmed Ones? Piper. Piper's the only one left. I don't understand. You said The Hollow would be enough. They got it too. They somehow found out you were going to use it against them, so they summoned it too. It must've split, infected you all. I just want Christy back. You might be able to. You've got the power, Billie. You've projected yourself back into the past before, haven't you? When Christy was young, when she was trapped in that cave? - Well, yeah, but I... - Then why can't you do it again? Only this time you can go back to change what was. To save her. You trust me, don't you? Damn. - Hi, Daddy. - Oh, sweetie, I'm so happy to see you. - Leo. You're back? - Hello, Victor. I don't believe it, it... This is good, right? I mean... ...everything worked out all right? Maybe you should sit down. No, I don't wanna sit down. What happened? What's going on? Phoebe and Paige... They didn't make it. - What? - But it's okay. I mean, I'm gonna fix it. I don't know how, but I'm gonna fix it. - Where's Wyatt and Chris? - Sleeping. We need to take them someplace where nobody can find them, so we can figure this out. Do you understand? No. What about the Elders? Can't they help? Apparently not. How about the rest of the magical community? What about that guy Coop? How do you know about Coop? Well, he was here yesterday, looking for Phoebe. Who's Coop? He's a cupid... ...who took Phoebe to see her past loves. - So? - So maybe he can do the same for us. Coop? If you can hear me, I need to talk to you now. Guys, if this is about Phoebe, she's made it very clear to me about the way she feels, so... - Phoebe's dead. - What? But if you lend me your ring, I think I can go back in time and save her. It can do that, right? I mean, you can go back in time. - Yeah, to follow love, but... - Okay. So hand it over. Okay, what do I do... How does it work? You just think about that person and... ...how much you love them. I gotta tell you, it doesn't always work the way you want it to, because love... Love isn't practical, it's emotional. - That's okay. It's all I've got. - I'm going with you. I'm not losing you again. Keep it simple. Just follow your heart to one of them. Phoebe. This isn't right. Oh, my God. Demons. - What happened? She didn't freeze. - I don't know. Probably because I'm your daughter. You must be a pretty powerful witch, you know, to be able to come here from the future. Oh, no, it really didn't have much to do with me. It was Coop's ring. - Who's Coop? A future son? - No, Dad, sorry. All girls. You mean it's just you and Prue, huh? Maybe we shouldn't tell them too much? You know, changing the past might change the future. Well, we gotta tell them something. I mean, how are we gonna figure out why we're here? Coop will fix it. What? I'm just not used to seeing you guys holding hands. Let alone... Never mind. Hey, I remember this. How old am I? I mean, now, in your time? Almost 3. So Prue would be 5. - And Phoebe... - Phoebe? Wha... Who's Phoebe? Not born yet. I don't understand how this happened. I was focusing on Phoebe, and it was supposed to take me to when she would be alive again. Well, maybe it did. You know, maybe we just overshot it a little bit. A little? Try 30 years. Wait a minute, I'm still a little new with the witch thing. So... ...what happened? Well, we were trying to save Phoebe and Paige... Paige? Do you mean we have another daughter? Yes, Mom, you do. But the point is... ...they died. In a huge battle. And we were trying to go back in time to warn them. But without the power of three, we had to use this. Wait. Did you say the power of three? Then that makes you the Charmed Ones, right? And you all came from me? Well, yes. - So... - So... If I'm the mother of the Charmed Ones, and we could find the grandmother, then maybe we'd be able to re-create the power of three. At least in theory. You know what she's talking about? I'm talking about using our family magic to get you to where you wanna go. Instead of that silly ring. Could that thing take us to her? I mean, your grams? Because it would be faster than driving. Look. You can't come barging in here from the future, and tell me that two of my girls are dead, without expecting me to help. So... ...let's get going. I'll be right back, baby. Grams. - What happened? - Where's Victor? Now where are we? Triple Word Score. Hold it. That's not spelled right. - Well, sure it is. - No, it's not. No? Is that an official challenge? - Excuse me. - How do you spell Zankou? - With a Z or X? - That's cheating. I'm not asking you, I'm asking me. Well? - Z. - Told you. - Are you? - The future you and Leo? Yeah. - And we've been expecting you. - Yeah. I baked cookies. I just don't understand how... You were aiming for Grams but you weren't specific enough. So you came to the future where you're the grams instead, - and here I am. - Wait, I'm a grandmother? Blows your mind, doesn't it? Mom? Hold on. I don't understand how you know all this stuff, and how did you know we would come? Because 50 years ago we were sitting there, where you're sitting, talking to our future selves. That's why we were expecting you. Now, you sure you don't want some cookies? - No, I think I'd rather have aspirin. - Like she said... ...we were expecting you. You remember when we were them? Kicking butt, fighting demons. Losing you, getting you back, losing you again. - But it was all worth it. - Oh, you bet. Oh, that's so sweet. You know what, I'm just not quite ready for all of this. Besides, we need to get back to - save Phoebe and Paige. - Save Phoebe and Paige. Right. And the only way you're gonna be able to do that is if you... Don't say too much, hon. We don't want them to mess up the future. Well, isn't it already messed up? Oh, no, not yet. The future is worth saving. Believe me. You keep using the ring. Focus on who you want to go to with your heart, not with your head. That way, you'll get to your grams, and then to Phoebe and Paige. But what do we do when we get there? - How do we save them? - You get rid of The Hollow together. I think we're back in my time. - You want another tissue? - No, I'm okay. Well, you're more than okay, sweetie. You're very, very special, and you need to know that. Not as special as Prue. Or even Phoebe. Everyone likes Phoebe. But you're special in your own way, Piper. I mean, you're kind and caring. You're the best little helper I've got. Plus, you are the only one who can keep your sisters from killing each other half the time. And you may not know it yet, but you've got gifts. The most... The most amazing gifts. And someday, those gifts are gonna make you even more special. - How? - Well, you'll see. Now, run on upstairs and play with your sisters, okay, - while I make dinner. - Okay. You loved your grams. Who's there? - It's okay, Mom. It's just me. - Oh, no. Mom. Patty? Mom! Oh, my... What happened? - Why'd she faint? - Oh, well, probably because you're... ...dead. All you need to do is focus on saving your sister. Which means focusing on the battle. Let's try again. Clear your mind of everything else. From all that has happened since. Let go of the pain of loss, because where you're going, that hasn't happened yet. Think only of Christy. See her at your side. You want to save her more than anything else. And that's what you're going to do. That's it. You're almost there. Now go... ...project yourself back to the Triad. The Triad? What the hell are you talking about? - Are you trying to trick me? - No, of course not. Then what was that? You said I was going back to see my sister. You're right. I should have told you. Should have told me what? What's going on? What's going on is that if you don't go back to warn the Triad about the battle they won't be able to stop it. Which means they'll still be killed and so will your sister. So you're saying the Triad was still alive? - More or less. - And you didn't tell me? So you've been manipulating me this entire time? And Christy too? Christy understands exactly what is going on. And what might that be? Why don't you go back and ask her yourself? Then maybe you'll understand too. - How is she? - I think she's coming to. No, I meant Mom. I think it's more information overload than anything else. Yeah. Well, welcome to the club. What's wrong? Nothing. I just was thinking about after you guys say the spell to get rid of The Hollow. Well, hopefully it'll work. Yeah, if it does it means everyone's gonna come back to life. Including Billie and Christy. Not for long. Not if I have my way. Until you do, it means the ultimate battle wouldn't have been fought yet. Which means the Angel of Destiny might take me away again until it is. Listen. All I know is that we will be playing Scrabble in the future. And I'm pretty sure you won't be losing. Oh, what happened? Where am I? You're okay, Mom. You just fainted. Well, of course I fainted. You're dead. Yeah, I know. They just told me. Hi. - And who are you? - Well, believe it or not, I am Piper. From the future. And this is my lovely husband, Leo, - from the future as well. - But I'm from the past. Obviously. I need a drink. - Oh, Mom. - Okay, Grams, relax. I know this is all very complicated, but we don't have time to explain. Something very bad has happened in the future, and we need your help to fix it. We have to save her sisters, Mom. We have to save the Charmed Ones. The Charmed Ones? You become the Charmed Ones? What do we have to do? Christy? Christy? Christy? Whoa, wait. - Who are you? - Well, I'm from the future. I came back to warn you... Me. Not to do this. No, no, I'm serious. You're gonna get yourself killed. This is not gonna work. We've been waiting for you. Well, the wait is over. - No potions, huh? - We don't need any potions. Funny. Neither do we. I knew we shouldn't have trusted you. You should've followed your instincts. Next time. There won't be a next time. - What the...? - Don't ask. You'll get a headache. Now, there's something you don't see every day. What is going on? Looks like time caught up with itself. How did everybody get here? Well, actually you have Coop to thank for that. What happened? What went wrong? Not here. Damn it. It's okay. At least Phoebe and Paige are alive. - Right. But where's Prue? - Oh, Mom. Not now. I'm sorry, but I have no choice. Wait, but... Okay. So let me get this straight. Because you guys altered a key moment in time by saving us... - And the manor. - Right. Because of all that, what is supposed to happen after this, won't happen? Exactly. That kind of makes this the new present. Says the woman from the past. Though a different past than mine. Are you getting any of this? Whatever. As long as we're alive again, that's all I care about. Plus, it's really nice to see you guys again. Actually, we've never met. Yeah, we have, but you were a ghost. Does she know? Yes, yes, we know. We're both dead by now. - We're over it. - Well, you speak for yourself. Okay, the problem is we're still right back to where we started with Leo, and if I'm gonna have that future that I saw with him... Wait, you went to the future too? We sure did miss a lot when we were dead. Anyway, the point is if I'm gonna get my husband back, we have a battle to finish. And we're gonna have to get Mom home safely, - otherwise Paige and I won't be born. - Good point. Well, fantastic. Are there any other problems we should be worrying about? - Wyatt. - Chris. What are you two doing here? Somebody just screwed up our future. We're gonna need Dumain's help if we're gonna finish what we started. Haven't you been listening to me? He's been manipulating us, probably since we met him. If we could get to The Hollow sooner this time. - Christy, listen... - We can figure... What is the matter with you? Dumain is using us, okay? And he's not the only one. The Triad is also. Yes, that's right, they're still alive. Or they were, but Dumain didn't tell us that, did he? Instead he tried to trick me into saving them instead of you. Maybe you should've listened to him. - What? - The Triad could have helped us figure out how to kill the sisters - if they were still around. - Okay. Look at me. Listen to me very carefully. They don't care about us. They have twisted everything. They're using us, Christy. They're using us for our powers, our sisterhood, and our lives so all we can do is kill. And that's exactly what we're going to do, Billie. We're going to kill. Well, I can't do it. I won't. Then I'll do it on my own. Christy. God. We don't know what happened. One minute everything's fine. - We're kicking demon ass... - Actually, I was kicking demon ass. - Watch your language. - Sorry, Grams. - Wait, Grams? As in the Grams? - Yeah. Confused. Are these my future grandkids or yours? No, yours. Oh, hi. As you were saying. Suddenly, in the middle of all the fighting, everything changed. And the demons started kicking our as... Butts. Butts. - Just because Wyatt here lost his powers. - Wait, how did you lose your powers? - That's the thing. We don't know. So we cast a spell to take us back to when they were lost and it took us... ...here. To you. Maybe we messed up something without realizing it. With all the jumping around we've done, it's a wonder everything's not messed up. No, it's gotta be Billie and Christy. They used The Hollow to steal his powers. I'm gonna kill them. Well, before you do that we need to get Wyatt's powers back, otherwise there's not gonna be any future to save. Well, I think the only way to do that is to go back and stop them. But how do we know exactly when to go back to? I'll know. Or at least I'm hoping little Wyatt might jog my memory. Well, he's at Dad's. I mean Grandpa's. - Do you remember how to get there? - Yeah. Absolutely. - I'll go too. - But Dad's gonna be there. I know. I miss him. Besides, I'm dying to know what he looks like at this age. She doesn't know. Apparently, I hadn't chased him away yet. What are you talking...? What don't I know? All right. Everybody go. But just, you know, hurry back if you find anything. Hey. - Phoebe. - Hi. Thanks a lot for telling me she's alive. You're welcome. Uncle Coop. Uncle Coop? What? All right, everybody out. Go. Okay, let's get to the condo and get to the "Book. " Wait for me. Wait... Damn. Oh, surprise! Oh, my goodness. Oh, you're just as handsome as you ever were. - Wha... What's going on? - Hey, Gramps, how you doing? Chris. What are you doing here? Hey, Grandpa. How you doing? Now, this is our grandson, Wyatt. So handsome. But I'm... I'm, I'm, I'm so confused. Yeah, you'll get over it. I did. - Where did you come from? - 1975. How do I look? Didn't anyone tell her we're divorced? What? You dumped me for your whitelighter. - Who, Sam? - Yeah, Sam. Paige's father? Gramps, we're in a bit of a jam. Where's little Wyatt? He's in the other room with... With you. Thanks. Oh, come on, Patty. It's all right. It's a long time ago. What do you mean Billie's not coming? We need her. We can defeat the Charmed Ones without her. No we can't. We need the Triad to do that, and we need her power to go back and save them. Well, maybe there's another way. That's not nearly enough. Here, let me do it. I think I know how to do it after all this time. It's Billie and Christy. They're not demons. They might as well be from everything you've told me, which means we can't take any chances. I can't get over how big this book has gotten. - I'm so proud of you girls. - Then why don't you let me stir? Piper, why don't you get that? Paige, why don't you get that? Okay, I'll get that. Hey. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I'm looking for my wife. She didn't come home last night. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Of course I'm okay. I mean, we weren't... ..."okay" okay, but now we're okay and I think in the future we're gonna be... I think we're gonna be more than okay. Okay. Don't tell me she marries a whitelighter too. Worse. A mortal. Oh, good God. Didn't I teach you girls anything? Hey, what can I say? There's always Uncle Coop. I really should be out there helping them. No. Not until we talk. - Look, there are lives at stake here. - Yeah, and so is love. Ours. I let you kick me out of here yesterday, I am not doing it again today. And you know why? Because I love you, Phoebe Halliwell. With all of my heart, with every fibre in my being, I love you. I've found love for thousands of people all over the world, but I have never found love for myself. Not until now. Until you, and... I know you feel the same way because I can see it. I know what love looks like. And I am not letting this get away from us, Phoebe. - Apparently not, Uncle Coop. - Yeah. Look, I don't know what you want me to do with this information. I mean, we haven't even been out on a date yet, and I don't know how to get past the whole forbidden-love thing, I... Phoebe? I'm... I have to go. I will call you when we need the ring back. Nice ring. Can I borrow it? Okay, all we need to do now is find Billie and Christy. You don't have to look far. Can we talk? Look, I am so sorry for what I've done to you guys, after everything you've done for me. I just wanted my sister back so badly. I couldn't even see that she was manipulating me. Well, that's very convenient. But how are we supposed to know this isn't a trap? Guess we have to let her talk. - Where's Christy? - I don't know. Probably at Magic School trying to figure out a way to kill you. - But you're not. - No. No. That was before. They twisted everything to make us think we were doing the right thing. - Who? - The Triad. They used us. They used Christy. They have spent the last 15 years turning her into a killer. That's all they care about. That's all they wanted. We already vanquished the Triad. Dumain will figure out a way to bring them back. I know it. - Who's Dumain? - He's a demon, but he knows them better than anyone, and with Christy... ...they will stop at nothing. Mom, are you here? Keep an eye on her. Where's Mom... I mean Grandma? She wanted to stay with Grandpa to talk. Well, that had better be all that they're doing. What did you find? Grandpa said that someone came and picked up little Wyatt at 5 in the afternoon yesterday. Some man, but that's all I could get out of him. - Wait, what man? - Dumain. He brought Wyatt to Christy and me to summon The Hollow. And then you stole his powers. We were being infected. We didn't have a choice. You used my son? That is all in the past, dear. Now, let's just focus on how to fix it now, okay? Okay, so we have to go back in time to the day Dumain took Wyatt. No, we have to go before that. I know him. He's gonna warn the Triad before you can vanquish them. Then you have to get the ring. Coop? Coop? We need you. Something's wrong. What? The Elders sent Coop down to you, Phoebe. Not just to help you find love, but to help you find him. They hoped you'd fall in love with a cupid. It was their way to make up for all your sacrifice. They weren't gonna put you through what Mom and Dad went through, so... It wasn't and it will not be a forbidden love. Okay. I don't know how that information helps us right now. Well, in the future, when you're together, you guys are like one. All you have to do is think about him and he's there. Oh, my God. What happened? I fought him for as long as I could. Okay, who did this to you? Some demon. I'm sorry, he took my ring. We're too late. They're going back in time. But I can too. - What? - My lords, we come from the future to warn you about it. The Charmed Ones will get The Hollow at the same time Billie and Christy will. Which means we've gotta get to it before they do this time. Get out of here! - No! - Oh, yes. I don't understand. How could this happen? Billie projected us here. By focusing on you. - Paige. - Ring! How could you? Christy, please. It's over. Just come home. Oh, thank God. Is everything all right? Did anything change that wasn't supposed to? Nope. - I got my powers back. - I can see that. - Now, where's Billie? - She used her own power to get back. But she at least tried to help out, right? - I mean, try to make amends at least? - Yeah. Okay, hang on a second. You're not gonna take him away again, right? No. This is the way the battle was supposed to end all along. And it's over. Congratulations. Hi there. Come here. Did we miss anything? No, well, we changed the past, we fixed the future, and saved the present. - That's all. - What's that? Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't. Doesn't matter, just as long as everything's back to what it should be. It will be if you get us back. I mean, otherwise... How are we gonna get them back? Oh, I can take care of that. Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to? Well, the ring will. If I can ever get it back. Be sure you return them just before they were taken. That way they won't remember anything. Oh, no... Don't, don't do that. I mean, there's so many things, wonderful things, that I just don't wanna forget, you know. There's just as much I don't ever wanna know. Like what happened to Prue. - Victor told me. - Oh, Mom. It's all right. I know everything happens for a reason. I believe that. I also know that when one door closes another one opens. - Thank you for coming by. - Anytime. Don't tell me we have to go fight a demon. No. I don't think we'll have to do that any time soon. Then what's with the book? Well, I think we should write everything down. Everything that happened, everything we want future generations to know, so that we can pass it down. Just like it was passed down to us. After you. So much has happened over the last eight years.</i> So much has been gained and lost.</i> Still, in some ways, I feel like my life is really just beginning.</i> Do you, Phoebe Halliwell, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. And it was. For though I had love before,</i> I've never really known love. Until I met Coop.</i> A man who I shared this special little girl</i> I had long ago foreseen, but feared I might never have.</i> - Good night. - Mommy, we love you. Along with two other special little girls I had not foreseen.</i> I was suddenly so blessed to have a new family of my own.</i> And old friends to share it with. And though I kept working and giving advice to those who asked,</i> I was more interested in helping them find love.</i> Since finally having been loved. Phoebe had become somewhat an expert on the subject. As for me,</i> life without demons opened up similar avenues.</i> Henry, of course, continued to look after his parolees.</i> Even if they didn't want to be looked after.</i> While still making time to help me with little Henry and the twins.</i> Which allowed me time to finally embrace my inner whitelighter.</i> Arrow! And to help the next generation of witches come into their own.</i> So that Paige could pass on all that she'd learned.</i> Not just to her own children, or to mine, or to Phoebe's,</i> but to other future witches and whitelighters as well.</i> Which filled the time between when we were doing the fighting,</i> and when our kids were old enough to take over.</i> Allowing me time to get back to my roots,</i> and cook something other than potions for once.</i> And open the restaurant I had always dreamed of owning.</i> As for Leo, after we reclaimed Magic School,</i> he went back to teaching. - So who'd like to try it first? - I do! Which he continued to do until it was time to retire.</i> Awesome. Great job, Matthew. And although we certainly had our struggles...</i> "And heartaches over the years, we're a family of survivors, and we will always be. Which is why we've truly been charmed. " Again, Grandmamma. Again. No, dear, I can't. I need to rest. But you can
