they're just a little crisp. You know, personally, I am glad that you're not a chef anymore. I'd probably be 300 pounds by now. Maybe I should make another batch. Piper, remember when you told me to tell you when you're obsessing? I'm not obsessing. I just want everything to be perfect, that's all. Yeah, but Piper, it's a baby shower, not a royal wedding. Don't you think you're doing enough? For God sakes, you're hosting it, and you're not close to Wendy anymore. That is precisely why l am doing all of this. I swear to God, in the last couple of years we've vanquished more friendships than we have demons. - Got milk? - Somebody forgot to put it on the list. Okay, well, we have to be patient. You know. It's gonna take Paige more than a week to adjust to living here. Still, there are common courtesies, common sense, rules. You have to admit it's nice to have the power of three under the same roof. Right. Grab those. So cute. Aunt Phoebe sure would like to throw one of these for you one day. - Damn it! Paige! - You're changing the subject. No, I'm ignoring you. You can't ignore that beautiful little girl of yours that we saw in the future. And if my math is right, you and Leo better start, you know, right about now. Phoebe, we saw a lot of things in the future that won't be happening now. I know, but that doesn't mean you can't have kids. Don't you want little kids? Not with demons dropping in all the time - I don't. - Phoebe? Hold that thought. Piper, generations of Halliwells have fought demons and had kids. It didn't stop them, so why you? Did it ever occur to you that maybe this is none of your business? - Oh, that's besides the point. - Phoebe. - How does Leo feel about this? - I haven't talked to Leo about this. - Well, don't you think we should? - We? - Yes, Cole, what is it? - Okay. Freeze the room fast, then unfreeze only me. - What? Why? - Just... ...do what I say and I'll explain after. - Oh, please don't blow him up. - I'll try. Rest of the room still frozen? Cole, we're the only ones in the room. You're not actually. There's a chameleon in the house. A lizard? You're worried about a lizard? This chameleon's a demon, one who can transform into any object just to spy on you. Trying to tell me the manor is supernaturally bugged? Has been for some time, apparently. Explains why The Source hasn't attacked in a while. He's had chameleons watching your moves, gathering inside information. Look around, what's not supposed to be here? - Piper, I think that was Paige's chair. - Yeah, I know, it was ugly. The room just unfroze. Where did that lamp come from? Cole, get back. Damn it, we just got that thing fixed. - What the hell happened? - The freaking furniture just attacked. Do you know how long the chameleon demon was in the house? I don't know. The lamp has been here for at least three days, maybe more. - What do you think he wants? - I told you, gathering information. - But for what? For why? - For The Source's next attack. Excuse me, is there any way to claim this kind of damage on our homeowners' insurance policy? - Usually not. - Usually? What you do mean, I can expect my furniture to get blown up again? Get ready for the unexpected. That's rule number one in the Halliwell manor. Wanna learn the rest? Maybe now is not the time. Considering we have to figure out a way to find this demon. Well, you could try scrying using his blood. And we've got plenty of that. Although I don't know what good it would do to find him. Whatever he's learned, he's already told The Source. Except that he might also know what The Source's plan is. How he's going to attack. Find him, we might be able to find that out. I know, what about pooling our money into a fund to cover anybody's damage, no matter whose it is? Whoa, scared me! Hey, Phoebe, it's been a long time. Hey, sorry I'm late. We should go. - Go? - To the shower. Wasn't I supposed to pick you up? Did I mess up? No. No, you didn't, Becca. There's just some stuff going on here. So, what else is new, huh? You want some help with the party baskets? No. No. It's just, I'm afraid something came up, and Piper can't-- Oh, no. Don't tell me that you're not gonna come. Everyone's so looking forward to seeing you again. Oh, really? They are? Well, then-- Then we can't disappoint them. We'll get some stuff at the market on the way there. Will you excuse us for one minute? What--? Are you out of your mind? You can't still go. Piper, we have to scry for that demon. Well, it doesn't take three sisters to scry. You and Paige can do it, and then call me when you find him. - Piper. - Phoebe. Look, the bottom line is if I'm ever gonna have kids, then I need to have a life first. Which means I need to be a human first, and a witch later. Okay? Got it? Good. Stop it! Out of the way! - Hi. - Hi. - Bye, Leo! - Bye. - You have failed me. - I beg to differ. Aside from finding Belthazor, everything I've learned about-- May all be for naught now that they've exposed you, Alaster. The element of surprise was critical to my plan's success. You can still use the information to capture one of them. That's not what I needed the information for. Capturing is easy. Tricking one into giving up all of their powers was the ultimate goal. That's why I needed to learn everything about their hopes, fears, their dreams. Then accelerate your plans. Use me to capture the one you want. After all, they'll be after me now. Yes, they will, won't they? But then, why not cut out the middleman? It's time, Oracle. I must know now which of the sisters do you foresee will be most vulnerable to my plan? Well, each is vulnerable in their own way. But the eldest seems to have the most resistance to the craft. Her yearnings appear to be their greatest weakness. How cute is this. Oh, Piper, this is adorable. Where did you get this? A little shop in the Embarcadero. They have the cutest things. - Thank you so much, for everything. - Oh, you're welcome. - We have so much to catch up on. - I know. We will. Ladies, ladies... - What? - Nothing. It's just good to see you out and about again, that's all. Yeah, after Prue died, it took some time to... Yeah, but I mean, even before that. It's almost like the last three or four years you've just kind of disappeared. Yeah. Oh, no. Don't tell me you have to go. No, it can wait. I'll be right back. What are you doing here? No guys allowed. I tried calling your cell phone, but it went dead. Paige and Phoebe think they've found the demon. Already? They did? Are you sure? Yeah, you have to go now. How are we supposed to have kids if I can't even be at somebody else's baby shower? - What? - Nothing. Never mind. Okay, I'll meet you outside. The least I can do is say goodbye. Wendy, I'm sorry. I gotta go. Something's come up. Now? But we haven't even had the cake yet. You're gonna miss the best part. I know. The story of my life. I'll see you later. So we've got a spell to vanquish the chameleon, but we're not going to use it. I don't get it. Well, you vanquish him only if you have to. The goal is to try and interrogate him, find out what The Source is planning. Okay, but I'm thinking that this guy's not gonna be so eager to spill his guts. He'll spill. I'll see to that. No, you can't come. He saw you with us. Which probably means The Source has some bounty hunter ready to attack you or capture you or something. - So, what else is new? - It doesn't make it less dangerous. So the question still stands, how do we get a demon to stop and chat with us? Well, Piper can freeze him and then unfreeze his head. She's done that before. How do you feel about that? I don't know. Why? You got a better idea? Maybe. We could tell him to offer The Source a deal instead. Deal? What kind of a deal? Well, something like, he stops coming after us, and we stop going after him. What? Of course, that would mean we'd have to stop going after his demons too, which would be fine by me. It would stop all the constant attacks. Am I the only one who thinks she's bumped her head? You can't be serious, Piper. Actually I've never been more serious in my life. Think about it. This could be an opportunity for us to get out of the demon-fighting business once and for all. Wait. What, and just give up on your destiny? How do you know we haven't already fulfilled it? I mean, God knows we saved scores of innocents already. Maybe that's enough. Maybe it's time for some other witches to take over and let us get on with our lives. Isn't it worth a try in exchange for what we might be getting? No more putting things on hold. Vacations, friends, kids. I can't give up now. We are so close. We have to take out The Source if we can. And if not just for our sake... ...then at least for Prue's. Fine. I just hope we don't end up where she did. Something's not right. We've checked both alleys twice. Well, the chameleon's gotta be here because the crystal never lies. I don't know about you, but I'm getting a not-so-good feeling about this. All right, we'll check one more time, and then we'll call it quits. Phoebe, you and Paige check that alley. I'll go check that alley. Wait, split up? Are you sure that's a good idea? Maybe it'll lure him out. Who knows? If you get nervous, say the vanquishing spell. And keep your eyes peeled. He could be anything. Were you expecting me to freeze? Phoebe, Paige. Piper. Piper. Piper, are you okay? My head hurts. I bet it does. You hit it pretty hard. Are you all right? I think so. What happened? What always happens when you have one of your episodes. You threw yourself against a wall. Episodes? I didn't throw myself-- What are you wearing? Before you poison me, I know about the aliens. Or the conspiracy, and I'm gonna tell the world. It's okay, those are just the other patients. What the hell is going on? It's all right. You're at the sanatorium. You're home. Where's all our furniture? Leo, what are all these people doing in our house? Our house? Piper, Halliwell Hospital is hardly our house. All these other people live here too. Halliwell Hospital? Is that some kind of joke? - What's wrong with you? - Please, calm down. No, Leo, I will not calm down. Something very strange is going on, something demonically strange. The demon must have cast a spell and changed the house and changed you. Phoebe. Paige? Now, easy lady, relax. Let go of me. Leo, don't just stand there! - Problems, Dr. Wyatt? - That's him. That's the demon. Demons again? Piper, we've been through this thousands of times before. There are no demons. They're just figments of your imagination. Wanna bet? Evil hiding in plain sight I use this spell with all my might To stop your changing Form and shape This vanquish seals your fate Doesn't really rhyme, does it? Sorry. I don't understand. That spell should have worked. Piper, why do you insist on demonizing me and every psychiatrist who's tried to help you? Let go of me. I gotta blow him up. I'm gonna blow you up. Her violent impulses are returning. - Straitjacket. - Yes, doctor. Piper, why won't you let Dr. Alaster help you? I don't need his help. I need your help. Get this guy off of me so I can use my powers. Piper, you don't have powers. You're not a witch. You don't save innocents. You never did. What? This isn't fair! This is my house too! I can do anything I want! - You're hurting me! - Paige. Paige, a demon took over the house. Orb the heck out of here! Take her to isolation so she doesn't hurt herself. Hey, wait a minute. You don't understand. Wait. Leo! It's for your own good. Wait a minute. Hey. You're making a big mistake. Please, listen to me for a second. He's a demon. I'm not gonna give up on you, Piper. We're gonna free you of these delusions. Shut up! Phoebe! Phoebe! I can give you everything you want if only you'll let me help. This illness has already consumed more than three years of your life. Don't let it rob you of any more. You're not a witch. You only think you are. - What's the matter? What happened? - It's just taking more magic than I realized to project into her mind. More than you have, perhaps? I only mean to caution you. This is weakening you, making you vulnerable. But the bounty I seek will make me more powerful than ever. If you can get it. Nobody knows more about the Charmed Ones than I do. I know how to break her spirit. I know her Achilles' heel. In her deepest heart, she never wanted to be a witch. Yet she feels an obligation to her powers. Yes, but you said her powers won't work in our illusion. They won't. And once she learns that painful lesson, she'll willingly give hers up. And with them, her sisters too. Anything? I can't sense Piper anywhere. - Does that mean that--? - No. He wouldn't have taken her if he wanted her dead. - Cole-- Oh, my God. - I'm all right. I just found out that Piper's in the underworld. I think The Source has her. The Source? Are you sure? How do you know? From another chameleon demon. I kind of squeezed it out of him. Well, we gotta find her. There's gotta be a spell in here somewhere. Phoebe? I saw The Source, stealing the Book... ...and killing us, with our powers. Our powers? How can he get our powers? Maybe he's figured out a way to get them from Piper. Explains why he's keeping her alive. But she can't give them up by herself. Well, she can using the relinquishing spell in the Book. But we burned that spell three years ago. It doesn't exist anymore. It does in her mind. That's crazy. She'd never say it. She's never give up her powers. Even though she was kind of willing to this morning? I'm just saying... Look, I know what you're saying, but you don't know what you're talking about. - I'm sorry. - Forget it. Maybe you and I should go down there, see if I can sense her. Follow me. Okay, there's a bunch of summoning spells we can try. Come on. I thought you said I wasn't good enough for your little coven. Paige, you are under a spell. You don't know what you're talking about. I tried to be your friend. I even tried to play your stupid witchy games. But all you could do is complain about me and my stuff and how we didn't compare to your beloved Prue. - I've never said that. - You don't have to. It's obvious in the way you treat me. You don't even like me. Paige, that's ridiculous! We're sisters. You don't have any sisters. You're an only child, Piper. You know that. I'm gonna be so happy when I vanquish your sorry ass. You use it to explain things you can't accept. Just like your best friend did before she got well. Prue? Don't you dare talk about Prue. Here we go again. Saint Prue. You've never forgiven her for finally accepting she wasn't a witch. You've convinced yourself that she's dead. - She is dead. - No, she's not. We released her three months ago. She's recovered. She's free. Just like you could be if you'd stop fighting it, accept your reality. Let me out of these restraints, I'll show you some reality. I'm afraid you'd just hurt yourself again. I'm truly sorry. Leo! Leo! Would you stop with the "Leo, Leo"? You're driving me crazier than I already am. Phoebe, Phoebe. Untie me. Hurry, hurry, hurry. All right, all right, stop obsessing. I'm not obsessing. - What are you eating? - Chocolate chip cookie. - Not your best. - Got milk? Don't think so. Okay, just get me out of these things. We need to reverse this demon spell. What is it? What did you see? I saw the back of my eyelids. What did you think? Oh, no, Phoebe, not you. Not you too. Hurry up, Looney Tunes, get me out of here. All right, I don't know what the hell is going on, but we gotta get to the Book of Shadows. And since evil can't touch it, it's still gotta be in the attic, right? Right? Right? Let's go. All right, the first thing we gotta do is-- Where's Phoebe? Who cares? Sorry, had to grab my broom. - For what? - Well, for flying, silly. - Another innocent to save. - No, Phoebe, wait! You can't hurt me. I'm the mighty Belthazor! Stop it. He's not evil anymore. He's good! Well, he sure flew. Hi. Stop that. Has anybody seen the Book? I know where it is. I hid it so the doctors-- I mean, the demons wouldn't find it. What? What is this? Oh, God. You are nuts. Okay, I don't understand how a demon could take the Book out of the house. Unless this isn't the house. Okay, I gotta get you two out of here. Maybe that'll break the spell. How come the spell didn't work on you? Don't question the rules. Okay, come on. We'll go down the trellis. What about Cole? I never get to spend any time with him. We'll come back for him later. Come on, come on. It'll be fun. Hurry. Hurry. Faster. Piper, don't. I think we lost them. Wait a minute, everything looks normal. This is wrong. We should go back and try and get the demon to talk. I'm thinking he's not gonna be so eager to spill his guts. - Hey! - Stop him! Piper! No! I believe she's just learned her lesson. Power of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Blood to blood, I summon thee Blood to blood, return to me Any other spells you can think of? No. I don't know what else to do. If Leo and Cole can't find her... What is it? Something that Leo said about the power-relinquishing spell being in Piper's mind. I told you she'd never say it. Paige, you don't know her as well as I do. No, but I am getting to know The Source. He likes to play tricks in people's minds. God knows, he did with mine. He almost had me kill a guy, remember? Yeah, go on. Maybe that's what he's trying to do to Piper. Get into her mind somehow. If that's where the spell is. Then that's probably where he's looking for it. And if he can get into her mind, then why can't we? Easy. Easy. You've had a terrible accident. What did you do to me? You got hit by a car. The driver said you didn't even try to get out of the way. Piper, this delusion that you somehow have magical powers is gonna get you killed some day. Shove it. Where are my sisters? You mean your roommates. They're safe, downstairs. Piper, how can I save you if you won't save yourself? You have to want to. You have to will it. Otherwise, you just remain lost in this fantasy world of yours. It's real, and you're just trying to confuse me. No. No, I'm trying to help you. Piper, your psychosis is based on the fervent belief that you're magical. But you know that's just an escape. Escape. What escape? From some deep-seated pain, some terrible loss, most likely the death of your grandmother, which is, after all, when this series of episodes began. End your pain. You can do it. In one of our sessions, you mentioned a poem, "a spell," you called it. One that relinquishes the magical powers you think you have. No. Go away. Say the spell, Piper. It'll free you, I promise you. It'll release you from all the crippling delusions you have. Get out. Get away from me. Get out! You have the power to give yourself the life you've always wanted. All you have to do is stop putting the illusion of being a witch in front of it. Leo. Leo, where are you? Leo. - She's hurt. - Where is she? I don't know. I can't get an exact reading. - Well, try harder. - I can't. The Source must've learned from last time. He's blocking Piper's signal. Well, then we have to find The Source. How are we gonna do that? There's only one way. Cole. Hey. Leo, heal me please. This ought to help. No, not with that. With your powers. If I had powers, honey, I would use them. You know that I would. It kills me to see you like this. What? White lights. I see white lights all around you. That's the painkiller. No, you're my whitelighter. Dr. Alaster says there's a way for you to get better. Is that true? I don't... If it were, then we can be together. We wouldn't have to keep sneaking around, breaking the rules. Rules? But we're married. No, only in your fantasy world. But it doesn't have to be that way. If you were to get better, then we could be married for real. And have that little girl that you've been dreaming about in the future. Come on, I want to show you something. What are you doing here? Leave now. I don't think so. Tell The Source we've captured Belthazor. Leave him. I'll make sure you get the credit. We're not going without our bounty. Then you'll wait. I have a surprise for you, Piper. One that I think will help you. You see? There's magic in the real world too. Your friends have come to visit you. Hi, Piper. How are you? Becca? It's so good to see you again. We've missed you. We've got so much to catch up on. Wendy, when did you have your baby? Just after the shower. Don't you remember? How could she forget? Do you want to hold her? Here. Isn't the outfit you bought her just adorable? What's the matter, honey? Why are you crying? I think it's probably best if you all go now. But we just got here. And everyone's so excited to finally see her again. I'm sorry. You understand? Bye, Piper. You can have this life, Piper. We can have it together. You already know how to get it for us. It's the only way you'll ever get out of here, to free yourself once and for all, to free us. The spell? Yes, the spell. Try to remember it... ...exactly. Are we sure we wanna do this? This was your idea, remember? Well, in the abstract, yeah. But, I have enough trouble being in my head, let alone someone else's. Well, our minds won't actually be in Piper's body. Just our consciousness. Kind of like astral projection. Okay, so the spell gets us into her head. What about after that? We use the reversal spell to get us out. Are you ready? I'm not about to lose another sister, and neither are you. Life to life and mind to mind Our spirits now will intertwine We meld our souls and journey to The one whose thoughts We wish we knew I think it worked. Either that or we're in Mary Poppins' head. Piper. Piper, we're gonna get you out of here. - Okay, I have the spell. - No. No more spells. Piper, honey, it's us. It's your sisters. I don't have sisters. Go away! Leave me alone! You're too late. Her nightmare's about to end. Keep them here. I want them to witness this. They're no threat. - Their powers don't work here. - Oh, yeah? Spell. No, pain, however, you do feel. And will, after she recites the spell thrice. Once for each of your powers. Leo. Help Piper. Get her out of here. Yes, Leo, by all means. It's okay. Piper, honey, just say the words, and everything will be all right. No! From whence they came Return them now Piper, don't! - Please, Piper, don't. - Vanish the words Vanish our powers Don't trust them. They're trying to steal our powers. - Don't listen to them. - They're still delusional. - But you're not. - Not anymore. Just two more times, and you'll set yourself free. Say the spell, Piper. You know you want to. Come on, Cole, wake up. How you doing? - Cole, hurry up, wake up. - Finish this. You're in danger. Piper. No! Vanish our powers One last time. Now! Break the connection, or he'll kill you! No. I told you, you're too late. No! Piper, please don't do this. Our magic is a gift. You can't just throw it away. From whence they came Return them now Piper, don't. Listen to your sisters. Trust them. Trust me. Don't say the spell. Don't relinquish your powers. Are you really my husband? Yes. And that would make you two really my sisters. Whether you like it or not. And so that demon is gone? Thank God because that guy was freaking me out. What do you say we click our heels and get out of this crazy joint? - No offence. - That's okay. My life has always been a little crazy. - Is something wrong? - No. Everything is just right. Except for my chair. Yeah, which I'll actually pay to replace. Oh, God, no. It's not your fault. Or is it? Actually, yeah, it was. I was just upset there was yet another demon in our house and in our lives. And I know I should stop fighting it, and just accept it, but-- It wasn't my favourite chair anyway. Besides, it's actually good to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with the idea of being a witch. No, believe me, you are in good company. The good news is you won't deal with The Source anytime soon, because Cole hurt him pretty bad. Not bad enough, though. He'll be back. So he's gone for now, isn't he? First time in a long time? I think we should take advantage of that. Why, Miss Halliwell, are you trying to seduce me? Always. Okay, I'm just gonna... ...go to the store and get some milk or something. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah. You know, I'm never gonna stop wanting a normal life. But you know what? I think that's the one thing that actually keeps me sane. Well, you deserve a normal life, Piper. We both do. And maybe we'll get that when we vanquish The Source once and for all. And who knows? Maybe someday l could have a baby shower of my own. What do you think?
