But first things first. Cockles. - Cockles? - They're over by the crickets. - And what exactly are they? - Small, leaping insects that chirp. That's funny. I meant the cockle shells, not the crickets. I'm not sure, but as long as they help vanquish Belthazor, that's all I really care about. It would be nice to get back to our lives as they were. Pig's feet. - Yuck. - Yuck? Yuck. You can slice a chunk of demon flesh, but can't touch a pig's foot? - I'm a vegetarian. - Since when? Since now. Now is not the time to get squeamish, okay? This recipe is very important. We have to follow it to a T. Poor piggy. Everything's in there, we just need to get the slice of Belthazor flesh, and we're good to go. Let's test it. Pheebs? Something tells me she's not in the vanquishing mood. Why not? She's worried about Cole. She hasn't heard from him in over a week. - And that's a bad thing? - Prue. Know what? I don't like him and I don't trust him. And it has nothing to do with him being a greasy lawyer either. Greasy what? A greasy layer. There's a greasy layer on this potion. Too much mandrake. Okay. What do you say we do this incantation? Anything to get rid of Belthazor before Cole gets back. And he is coming back. Okay. Spirits of air, forest and sea Set us of this demon free Beasts of hoof and beasts of shell Drive this evil back to hell It didn't work. - No, you forgot the Belthazor flesh. - Oh, yes. How can we forget the Belthazor flesh? - Such a slacker. - Just give me a second, lady. All right. Ready? Piper. - Are you all right? - Attack of the killer pig's feet. Remind me to step back next time. "Fret not thyself because of evil. Neither be envious of wrongdoers. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green earth. Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee..." You know what I am, Belthazor. You know you can't escape from me now that you can't shimmer anymore. You'll be pleased. The bounty on you was determined by The Source himself. A reflection, no doubt, of your triumphs and your betrayal. You're wounded, powerless. Think of your legacy, Belthazor. Die as a legend, not a coward. Mind if I hitch a ride? You going to the wake? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Come on. - Hey, I'll be back. - Where are you going? I am going to school and then... ...I'm going to Cole's. Okay, aren't you forgetting a little something like vanquishing Belthazor? Wait, I thought you had to write a spell to summon him first. Yes, and it's done. I'm using the one that we called Melinda from the past with. - Just rewrote it a bit. - Really? You think it'll work? Well, yeah. I mean, it should. It's magic calling magic. Although, in this case, dark magic. Phoebe, why are you going to Cole's again? I mean, what do you really expect to find? Actually, I was gonna go to his office. How do you know I've already been to Cole's? Well, you got a parking ticket there yesterday when you borrowed my car. - Sorry. I'll pay for it. - Phoebe, that's not the point. Look, please don't take this out on me, all right? I'm not the bad guy. I know. I'd just like some understanding. You know, some support here. Look, I can't support you when I think you're setting yourself up to get hurt. And I have to be honest with you. We have to be honest with each other. That's a promise we made when Belthazor tried to split us apart, remember? Yeah. It just doesn't help that you never liked Cole from the beginning. Yeah, well... I mean, you never really liked any of my boyfriends either. That's very true. I'm sorry, all right? This is your call, not mine. Thank you. - Okay, are we gonna do this or what? - We are. Phoebe's not. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Go to Cole's. It's fine. We don't need the power of three to vanquish, just the potion. Okay, well, why don't you take this in case. Okay, just... You guys, no more whispering, okay? It's hard enough for me to know that Cole's keeping secrets from me. I can't take it from you too. - This is gonna be messy. - That's why we Scotchgard. - You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be. All right. Magic forces, black and white Reaching out through space and light Be he far or be he near Bring us the demon Belthazor here - It's working. - All right, you ready? - On three. One. Two. Three. - One. Two. Three. There's no boom. - Why is there no boom? - I don't know. - Stupid witches. - He's not... You know what? That is an antique. Stop! Not the clock. We can't afford to keep fixing that thing. Unless Belthazor can morph, that is definitely not him. That doesn't make sense. How did we get the wrong demon? Hey, do you think that you could just unfreeze his head? - That way we could ask. - His head? - Yeah, his head. - Why not? - That's different. - That's cool. What did you do to me? Hi. You know what, you're sort of frozen in midair. Therefore, we'll be asking the questions, okay? Who are you? Someone who's going to butcher you if you don't unfreeze me right now. Okay. What? It was worth it. All right, you start talking, or we start the bonus round. I am Krell, a Zotar. Hi, I'm Prue, a Scorpio. Where is Belthazor? Wait. Don't. I won't attack if you don't. I'm a bounty hunter. I track fugitive demons. And it looks like we're after the same one. Cole? Oh, I'm so sorry. I was just looking for Cole Turner. That's all right. So am I. Reece Davidson, DA Bureau of Investigations. - And you are? - Phoebe. Phoebe? Is that like Cher or Madonna, or do you have a last name? No, of course. Halliwell. Phoebe Halliwell. - Is Cole okay? - How do you know him? - You didn't answer my question. - I know. Look, I have no idea if he's all right or not. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Nobody's heard from him since Monday. - You his girl? - Yeah, I'm his girl. Well, did he mention anything to you about what he was doing? - Where he was going? - No. A couple of weeks ago he had a suitcase packed, - but he said his plans had changed. - What plans? I don't know. Something about a big case that he was working on? Couldn't have been. No. According to his file, he hasn't been working on a case, big or small, not for a couple of months. All he's done is file extensions. Makes you wonder what he's been doing with himself. Well, if you happen to hear from him, or if you think of anything that might help, call me. Okay? Okay? Yeah. I should've known better than to underestimate him. I thought because Belthazor couldn't shimmer, his other powers were useless as well. So you don't have the power to vanquish him. Obviously not. Otherwise, I wouldn't have needed to intercept your calling card, would I? Hey, you know what? How about next time I just freeze your head - and then maybe I can kick you in... - All right. So Belthazor was sent by the Triad to kill us. How do we know that you weren't sent by them too? You're joking, right? I don't believe this. You really don't know? Your whitelighter must really be sleeping on the job. - Hey. Now wait a minute, pal. - Piper. - What don't we know? - Belthazor killed the Triad. That's why he's on the run. That's why I'm here. Why would he do that? Probably because they were going to kill him for failing to kill you. Ironically, his inability to shimmer saved him from you killing him. So instead we got you. Believe me, just the thought of working with you turns my stomachs. - Stomachs? - But... ...right now, I'm more interested in killing Belthazor than witches. Like it or not, we need each other. You can't find him without me, I can't vanquish him without your potion. So then you know where he is? Prue, you can't be seriously considering this. - Answer the question. - I can track his scent, his blood, when he's in his demonic form, not his human one. Fortunately, he can't maintain his human self for long, especially wounded. It drains him. Hi. Could you come here? Over here. Please? We've tried working with demons before. It was a bad idea then, and it's definitely a bad idea now. - We'll let you know. - No, you'll let me know now. Think fast. Belthazor won't stop trying to kill you. Only the heads of the Charmed Ones will convince The Source to spare him. - Leo. - Leo. Cole? Cole, are you in there? Sorry. Cole? Hello? Cole? - Cole. - You really shouldn't be here. Okay, Cole, come on. Lay down. Lay down. Easy. Easy. Are you okay? - Do I look okay? - I'm sorry. - Okay, let's see how bad this is. - No, no. No, don't. - Believe me, I've seen worse, Cole. - I said, don't. Please. - We gotta get you to the hospital. - It's not safe there, they'll find me. Who will find you? What's going on? Who's after you? There was somebody looking for you today at your office. - An investigator. - You didn't tell him anything, did you? I don't know anything. What did he look like? You sure he wasn't a D...? - A? He said that he was, and he also said that he needed to... Okay, come on. Back down, back down. I'm gonna go get some help, okay? - Leo? - Phoebe, come on. Cole, I am not gonna just sit back and watch you die, okay? Leo? Okay. I am gonna go back to the house, okay? And I'm gonna get Leo. He's a doctor, he can heal you. Okay. Are you sure it's safe for you here? They've already looked for me here, they won't be back. Not for a while anyway. You better be here when I get back. I don't understand. How can you not know that the Triad is dead? Don't you think that's kind of important? Especially since, I don't know, they've been trying to kill us for the past two years? We've heard rumours, talk, but that's it. Nothing substantiated. Well, I guess you can substantiate it now, can't you? Jeez, have you been sleeping on the job or what? So, Leo, don't mind her. She's just a little cranky. Well, you know what? I get that way when demons are trying to kill us. Piper, I don't think that Krell was trying to kill us, otherwise, he probably would have tried by now. Oh, yeah? Tell that to the dining room table. Is there anything in there on Zotars? Yeah, everything that he said about them, which makes me think that everything else he has said might be true too. Including the part about how he likes to kill witches? Including the part about us working together. Are you willing to bet our lives on it? Are you willing not to? Look, Piper, if we do nothing and Belthazor somehow gets all of his powers back, then we are going to be looking back over our shoulders again. Personally, I'm tired of that. I know. I know, okay? I know. You think she's right and... If you don't vanquish him now, you may not get another chance. Magic forces, black and white Reaching out through space and light Be he far or be he near Bring us the demon Belthazor here Demon! Phoebe! No, no. Phoebe! What? What is going on? Who is that? He's a demonic bounty hunter who is here to help us find Belthazor. Why don't you go sniff something while we fill her in. There's no time. I just picked up Belthazor's scent again. All right, give us a minute. Come here. All right, listen, here's the deal. Belthazor killed the Triad, now The Source wants him dead. Krell is trying to suck up to The Source, so he wants to kill Belthazor. Belthazor wants to kill us so The Source won't kill him. If you work with Krell, you can vanquish Belthazor before he kills you. Works for me. Leo, I have to talk to you for a minute. How do you witches ever get anything done? If we're working together, we need to move now. - All right, we're ready. - Do you have the potion? - Do you have the scent? - I said I did, didn't I? You two come with me. The other should go to the old cemetery. Wait. Split up? Why? Because he might be hiding there, that's why. Evil frequent cemeteries. Makes it difficult for me to track a demon's scent there. Belthazor knows that. Okay, so why don't Leo and I go to the cemetery and you guys go with him. - Are you sure? - Positive. All right, let's go. We're ready. Oh, hey, I almost forgot to ask. Did you find out anything about Cole? No, nothing at all about Cole. We need to go. Phoebe, we shouldn't even be here. Belthazor... Can wait. Cole can't. Leo, he will die without your help. - Then he should be in a hospital. - He won't go. Phoebe, I cannot heal mortals, you know that. Not unless they were hurt by evil. It's against the rules. So break the rules. You've done it before. I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. I just... I can't let him die, Leo. You shouldn't be asking me to do this. I know. But I am. Cole. Cole, come here. - Leo, what's the matter? - Something's not right. Leo, are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Cole. - Phoebe. - It's okay. You're okay now. Here you go, baby. Thanks. I feel like I've been hit by a truck. You're lucky to be feeling anything right now. Yeah, I know. You must be one hell of a doctor. He is. He's the best. - I owe you one. - Forget it. Phoebe, can I talk to you out here? - Go ahead, I'm fine. - Okay, I'll be right back. What's the matter? Phoebe, listen to me. I think we should get out of here. I agree. Whoever's after him could come back. That is not what I'm talking about. You saw what happened. Yeah, you healed him. No, Phoebe, I only healed part of him. That has never happened before. Well, maybe it's just because he's weak. That is not the reason. I can heal mortals completely. There is no other explanation. He is not who you think he is. No. - I don't understand. - He is a demon, Phoebe. For all we know, he could be the demon you were trying to vanquish. - That's ridiculous. - Think about it, okay? They're both hurt, they're both on the run. You saw where Cole's wound is. It is the same place where Piper cut the flesh from Belthazor. - No. I don't believe it. - You have to believe it. No, I don't, Leo. I don't. Maybe you should just go. No way I'm leaving you here alone with him. I have the potion, don't I? Just go. Everything all right? Yeah. Everything's fine. I can smell his blood. He's close. Where? Get your potions. You know, it's too bad that he's such a bad guy because he could really come in handy. Don't push it. Vanquish him. Hey, what's going on? Who are you? It's a trick. He's in his human form. - Throw the potion. - I don't know, Krell. Don't you think he would've picked a better human? - No offence, honey. - None taken. - Here. Give me that. - Hey. Easy. And you call yourself a Zotar. - Where did you get this coat? - I didn't do anything. - Tell me. - I just found it. Leave him alone. He doesn't know anything. Yeah. Thanks, lady. Touch me again, witch, and I'll kill you. You had no reason to hurt that man. I'm a demon. It's my nature to hurt people. Yeah. It's in our nature to protect them. He's a pathetic wretch. His life means nothing. If you'd let me torture him, we'd know where he found the coat. - Whatever it takes? - That's right. Well, from here on out, it's gonna take doing things our way. Then we will fail, because your morality cripples you. It blinds you from doing what must be done. There are better ways of getting answers out of people, Krell. Maybe Phoebe can get a premonition off this thing. Well, at least we know Belthazor has very expensive taste. What? What is it? How long ago did the Triad send Belthazor? Two months ago. Why? Does this look familiar to you? - I don't know, why? - Because Cole has one exactly like it. Cole? - You think Cole is...? - Belthazor's human form. Too bad Leo had to leave like that. I didn't really get a chance to thank him properly. He knows. He knows what? He knows how grateful you are. Good. Still, I don't know how he did it. Sure like to know what his secret is. - Yeah, I'll bet. - Sorry? Nothing. Never mind. Hey, don't you think you should lay down and rest? I mean, you are still hurt. I can't. I've still got those people who did this to me to deal with. Yeah, and you won't tell me who they are, huh? I really can't. They don't have anything to do with that case you're working on? The reason I ask is because when that DA investigator came by today, he was asking me about it, and I realized I really didn't know anything. Looking for something? A piece of paper. I wanted to write myself a little note. It's right in front of you, by the phone. Thanks. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna vanquish him. We're gonna vanquish Phoebe's boyfriend? - That's gonna cause some problems. - If you hesitate, he'll kill us all. Excuse me, I'm having a private conversation over here. You know, I can't believe I let him out of that demon trap when I caught him. - What was I thinking? - We don't know anything for sure yet. - Leo, what are you doing here? - I didn't wanna get in between, - but I didn't know what to do. - About what? - I think Cole is... - Belthazor's human form. - That's why we're here. - How did you know? Where's Phoebe? She's upstairs with Cole, apartment seven. - Tell me you didn't heal him? - Well, not completely. - You idiot. - Leo. Phoebe begged me. I didn't know what to do. You stay here, we'll fix it. Is there something wrong, Phoebe? Something you're not telling me? Don't you think you have that backwards? Meaning? You're the one with all the secrets, right? Am I? Are you sure about that? I don't really know what I'm sure about anymore. Yeah. I know how you feel. I doubt that. I think I know what's going on here, Phoebe, and I'm sorry it's come to this. But I'm not sorry about us. You need to know that. You never told me where you were from. - You never asked. - I'm asking now. Why don't you ask me what you really want to know, Phoebe? I won't lie to you. Who are you? Krell. No. Phoebe. - You let Belthazor escape. - You almost killed our sister. Your sister is dead anyway. He only needed her to get away. - I don't think Cole will hurt Phoebe. - No, but maybe Belthazor would. Then why hasn't he? He's had so many chances. He just used her until he could get all three of you. The Charmed Ones. Why he couldn't follow through, I'll never understand. - Maybe he fell in love. - Yeah, or maybe that was just a trick. I mean, demons will do whatever it takes, remember? Glad to see I've had a positive influence on you. I can save your sister, if it's not too late. - Why would you want to? - I wouldn't. But I'll do it if it's the only way to kill Belthazor. Give me the potion. I can find him and get to him faster alone. Nice try, forget it. You already said that you can't track him if he can shimmer. But he can't shimmer well. He needs time to recharge. Your whitelighter only healed his human half. - I'm sorry, his human half? - That's why the Triad sent him. He understands you. He can blend in. A full-blooded demon could never have gotten so close. Give me the potion. If you hurt her we'll track you down. - Do you really trust him? - No. Come on. - Where are we going? - Oh, to where demons hide. Can we stop with the shimmering all over the place? I'm gonna vomit. I had to lose Krell. Now it's time to vanquish you. Don't even think that's gonna save you. I don't. I just wanted you to see who I really am, Phoebe. I've seen who you really are, Belthazor. Wait. Wait. - I won't hurt you. - No? It's a little too late for that, don't you think? Why? Why didn't you just kill me? Why did you have to put me through all this? Was it some sick, twisted, demonic thrill? - Was that what it was? - No. That's not it. - Then what was it? - I couldn't kill you. I tried. I was supposed to. I mean, at first, you and your sisters thwarted my attempts, even when I went back in time to destroy your line on All Hallow's Eve. - That was you? - Then Troxa. Andras. I got him to strip your powers, to make you vulnerable. I had you too, right where I wanted you. All I had to do was finish the job. But I couldn't... ...because I realized I loved you. - You bastard. - That's the truth, Phoebe. I admit, everything else is a lie. But not that. I know you know that too... ...in your heart. This isn't a mask, Phoebe. It's who I am. Who I really am. I'm half human. My father was mortal. - You're lying. - How else would I bleed red? Even as my demon self. You have to believe me, Phoebe. I forgot what it was like to be human, to feel, to care. Then I met you. That doesn't change anything, because you're still a demon. One who's done unspeakable things. But you've awakened something in me, Phoebe. Something I thought had died a long time ago. My humanity. My ability to love. - I wanna believe you. - Then let me prove it to you. Vanquish me. Cole. Cole, you gotta get up. Cole, get up! Come on. Come on. Cole. No, don't do this. Come on. Come on. You're fine. I should've known you'd come back here. Don't hurt her. You disappoint, Belthazor. You've changed. You let your weaker human side affect your better judgement. It's going to cost you your life. Witch. No. Do you believe me now? - Phoebe. - Phoebe. Phoebe. I better go. They'll keep looking for you until they find you. Your sisters? - Them too. - Phoebe? Give me your shirt. - My shirt? - Hurry up. Give me your hand. Trust me. - Phoebe. - There. Nobody will look for you anymore. You're dead. Phoebe? Down here. You have to go. Please. Pheebs? Phoebe, thank God you're okay. He killed Krell. And you did what you had to do. I know. - We brought you some comfort food. - Thanks. I'm not really that hungry. You wanna talk? I don't know what there is to talk about. - You were right as usual. - I didn't want to be right. I know. Believe me, Prue, you have nothing to apologize for. But I do. I don't... What I did was... Phoebe, he fooled us all, not just you. That's not what I mean. I don't know, I just... I feel so... ...ashamed. - You can't be so hard on yourself. You didn't do anything wrong, you know. Didn't I? Well, the important thing is that it's over. And we can get on with our lives now. At least until the next Belthazor attacks.
