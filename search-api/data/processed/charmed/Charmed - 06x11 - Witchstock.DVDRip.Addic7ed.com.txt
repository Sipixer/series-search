Paige used to be the first one to a vanquish. What's wrong with her? She's in love. That's hardly wrong. It is when it interferes with her responsibilities as a Charmed One. Why don't you just let me handle this one alone. Because you've handled the last four vanquishes alone. You should have never let them move out. Hey, you don't see me complaining, I'm happy for them. And you should be too. So where is this demon and what's its name? No one knows its name. And it's too strong for one witch to handle alone. How much longer is this gonna take? Go see what Phoebe's doing. - Where'd he go? - Hong Kong. Hong Kong? This is the last time I work crowd control for you guys. Hi. Oh, how's Wyatt? I miss him so much. He misses you too. Is this a bad time? No, this is a great time. Jason's away at a conference. I was just practicing my origami. This is a tiger. You can have that. - I'm sorry I didn't visit. - No, no, don't be silly. You've obviously been really busy folding. I'm sorry I have to ask for your help, but... No, it's okay. I mean, if you don't enter the tiger's cave, you may never get the cub, right? - Come again? - Ancient Chinese proverb. Means "nothing ventured, nothing gained," you know? - Can we get the show on the road? - Sure. - Okay. - Keep that. Look, when the safety hazard's clear, you can go to work. - Just be patient, okay? - Yeah, easy for you to say. - I got four mouths to feed. - Yeah, me too. - Got that right. - Yeah. Okay, what do you want me to do? You're the bait. All you gotta do is levitate into the air. And when this demon senses your magic, it's gonna come fast and hard. Okay. Be careful of my origami. That tiger took two fricking hours. Okay, let's do it. - What was that? - What was that? All clear. Maybe you should just take me out back and hose me down. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry I'm late. Did I miss the vanquish? - Ask her. - Hi, hi, hi. Hey. - Oh, my God, Phoebe, how are you? - Great. - How's Jason? - He's great. How's Richard? He's fabulous. He was taking his time getting out of the house this morning. That's why I couldn't orb. Wait, you don't orb with him in the house? She's asked Richard to not use his magic. So I'm trying to be supportive and, you know, not use my magic in front of him. A magic-free life. You're the last witch in the world I'd expect that from. It's not magic-free, it's just magic-light. Yeah, it's still a lot to give up. What I get from him kind of more than makes up for it, I think. - How's Hong Kong? - It's fascinating. I'm studying numerology and the Chinese zodiac. But, you know, distant waters doesn't quench the immediate thirst. - Ancient Chinese proverb. - It just means that I miss my family. Well, that's good, because your family misses you too. I mean, I don't have a lot of people to hang out with, aside from my baby, who doesn't really say much, and then one really neurotic whitelighter. Yeah, how is my little buddy Chris? Last time I saw him, he wasn't in such good shape. He's trying his best to hide it, but he's still really shaken up. Well, he lost his fiancÃ©e, you know? I don't blame him, it's huge. There's something in the future that's freaking him out. Yeah, he's more determined than ever to protect Wyatt from evil, which means there's a new demon hunt every day. I feel like such a bad sister, leaving you guys alone to handle all this. No, no. We're fine. Wyatt and I actually enjoy having the manor to ourselves. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, we have room to spread out, and life is very quiet and calm, and, best of all, everything stays clean. If I'm gonna hang out, I better change my clothes. - I think I left some here. - I'll go with you. You know, being born under the Year of the Ox is a good thing. It means you're a natural-born leader. - What happened to my room? - Holy... I guess when Piper said she was gonna spread out, she wasn't kidding. But where's all my stuff? I mean, I have stuff, you know. Lots and lots of stuff. Well, being an Ox, I can take charge of this. You can borrow something from my room until we straighten this out. Oh, hi, baby. This one too? Yeah, you move, you lose it in this family. You could lose a lot more than a bedroom. Hi, Chris, I'm fine, thank you. And you? It's his job to offer his opinion. You know, the only reason she's even here is Paige missed the vanquish. - Another one? - Yeah. That makes, what, five in a row now? You guys are such nags. When did you two become so chummy? We're not chummy. He's gone through a lot protecting Wyatt, and I figure, instead of doubting him, I should help him a little. So, what do you guys think? You like Wyatt's new room? I like it. I just like my room too. And I like it, I just like my room too. Well, you guys were the ones that moved out, not me. So where are my clothes? Oh, God. This is really kind of hitting home. - What's that? - Well, that I don't live here anymore. I know what you mean. At Richard's, it just doesn't feel like home yet, you know? I don't know, I guess I just had more fun here. Yeah, because this place is a riot. No, I just... I don't know, I guess I'm more free here. "Free to be me." Oh, wow, Phoebe, these are some boots. No, they're not mine, but I wish they were, because they're hot. The box says "Penny." Penny, as in "Grams" Penny? No way. I refuse to believe that Grams ever wore anything this hot. Yeah, I figured her more for steel-toed orthopaedics. You know, the better to kick your ass with. They're your size, Paige. Try them on. - I don't know. - Oh, come on, just do it. They're kind of '60s. So, what's wrong with the '60s? The '60s was, like, the worst fashion era. Hello. Bad clothing, bad hair, and extremely questionable personal hygiene. Hey, they fit. Hey, where'd she go? Pardon me... Hold on, I'm adjusting my aura. You know how those blocked chakras can get. There. You brought my go-go boots. Right on. Actually, they brought me. That's because I cast a return-to-owner spell on all my favourite stuff. I'm always taking my clothes off and forgetting them somewhere these days. - Excuse me, who are you? - Penny. Penny. As in... ..."Penny Halliwell" Penny? - Yeah. - Who are you? - I'm Paige. I'm your gr... I'm your grandest fan. I've heard so much about you. Far out. Far out. You have no idea how far out. The whitelighters are putting on a light show. Come on, Paige, you don't wanna miss this. What do you mean, you lost Paige? Well, it was really weird. I mean, one second she was here, and the next second: It kind of happened after she put on a pair of Grams' boots. Grams cast spells on her clothes when she was young. Wait, you knew Grams when she was young? Yeah, we crossed paths once or twice when I was a young whitelighter. Well, I barely remember it. Well, if the boots did belong to your grandmother, we better summon her from the dead. Maybe she can tell us what happened. - Okay, let's get the candles. - But you... Yeah. - Really groovy. - Pretty groovy. Out of sight. I'm Robin, by the way. So, what do you think? Oh, my God, is that Leo? - You know him? - I thought I did. - Yeah. - Yeah, man. What are all these people doing here? Oh, they're not just people. They're witches. With a few whitelighters thrown in. I don't suppose any of them know how to open a time portal, do they? Anything's possible when you free your minds. That's why we're gathering here tonight, for a magical be-in. Oh, like a human be-in. When Timothy Leary said, "Tune in, turn on, drop out"? No, there's no acid allowed in the manor, Paige. We're all on a contact high. I'm not on drugs. I'm just having a bad trip. How do you know what's gonna happen at the Human Be-ln? It's tomorrow at Golden Gate Park. I just kind of know things. Like I know I wanna go home. - Do you have an active power? - Yeah, I can orb. Groovy. Hey, everyone, we have a witch here who can orb. - Groovy. - Right on. Lay some orbs on us, sister. Fine, if it'll help me get out of here. Big, fat tape thingy. Oh, my powers must be down. Must be the past. Past few minutes. This patchouli oil, it's really making me light-headed. Performance anxiety. Listen, if you want some private coaching, there's an empty room upstairs, you dig? No, I don't dig. - You okay, honey? - Yeah. I don't know how I'm gonna get home without my magic. I've never seen so many witches just hanging out. Wait till the magical be-in. This house was built on a spiritual nexus. We're gonna tap into its power tonight and ride the magic wave. Are you sure you're Penny Halliwell? Everything on schedule for tonight? They're lining up like lambs to the slaughter. Oh, it's gonna be a massacre. I wish we could take them out now. I can't stand these peace-lovers. Just keep it together a little while longer. We want this place packed. And I see a few new arrivals since my last visit. This one's dressed a little strange, don't you think? - Where's she from? - I don't know. - She just got here. - Well, keep an eye on her. The attack takes place on schedule tonight. And if you need anything, I'll be close by. So, what do you say, Paige? Join us tonight? You know, as much as I consider myself a free spirit, I really can't. I need to go home. If there's any way that you can help me write a spell so I can find my way... Oh, Allen's back. - Hi. - Hey. Where's Patty? I dropped her off at my sister's. She's gonna crash there tonight. Patty, like "Mom" Patty? I mean, you're a mom. - Janice? - Excuse me? I just came back from my sister's pad, and for a second I thought I was looking at her again. Paige, this is my old man, Allen. He's not a witch, but he's cool with it. - Allen, your first husband. - My first and only. I'm not that into free love. Listen up, I passed this groovy drum circle on my way here. - Who wants to check it out? - Count me in. I think I'm gonna do some light reading. Is your Book of Shadows in the attic? I swear, it's like you could be my sister. Or your granddaughter. If you had a granddaughter, that is, which you won't unless I get home. You can't leave now. We need as many witches as possible tonight. She's right, Paige, come with us. Who wants a ride on the rainbow bus? You know, if I hadn't taken over Paige's room, this never would've happened. This is all my fault. - What's done is done. - What's done is done. Okay, you two really need to get a room. Yeah. Hear these words, hear my cry Spirit from the other side Come to thee, I summon thee Cross now the great divide Well, it's about time you called to say hello. Oh, how are my darlings? We got a problem. Well, you're not the only one. - Orb out. - No, magic makes it grow. Summoning her spirit already gave it power. Oh, you must be Chris, the new whitelighter. You know, he doesn't look very qualified for the job. - Chris, just let me blast it. - She's right. Orb. For heavens' sakes, listen to them. We'll find a way to vanquish the foul thing later. Now. You and Paige moved out? - When? - A few weeks ago. But we're handling everything. Dear, you have Paige stuck in the past and a demonic blob roaming the manor. Exactly how are you handling things? We're still in an adjustment period. There would be no adjustment period if you were living under one roof. Why in heaven's name did you move out? To be with Jason. You said it yourself, "never give up on love." Remember? I didn't say give up on your sisters. And you. You're the oldest, how could you let them move out? You know, it really wasn't that hard, because they deserve a shot at a normal life. They're not normal, Piper. And neither are you. When are you going to learn that? Well, I guess never. All this over men. How many times have I told you, men are utensils. You use them, wash them, and throw them in a drawer until you need them again. Everyone, quiet. I can hear it. I think it's in the wall. Yeah, it's in the wall. We need Paige. It took the power of three to vanquish it in the future. What? If you knew that, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? I could barely get two of you together, let alone three. Besides, it's not that big right now. I thought two could handle it. Leo, you take point. Chris here is much too green to guide my girls. What? You know what, you can just stop that right... Quiet. It's time to give this floundering ship a rudder. Now, which boots did Paige put on? Red. Go-go boots. We've got a problem. Those boots took Paige back to the Summer of Love, which was one of the most crucial times of my life. What do you mean, crucial? Your grandfather Allen, rest his soul, was a sweet man, but he led me straight down the hippie-dippie trail. - You were a flower child? - Yeah, well, don't rub it in. What's important is that Allen was killed by my best friend. I didn't know it then, but she was evil. And I walked in right after it happened. What did you do? Well, let's just say that my peacenik days ended fast. Along with that bitch Robin. - If she hadn't killed Allen... - You'd still be a flower child. And the Charmed Ones would be dead. I know I'm a ball-buster. But it kept me alive to protect my girls from all the demons that came after them as kids. I cast my return-to-owner spell on a lot of clothes that summer. - So... - So we get to go back there? And we get to meet our grandfather? Don't make too much out of it, because whatever you do, you can't change the past or tell anyone you're from the future. - Well, why does he get to? - Because I know what I'm doing. Not from where I'm standing. I'll stay here with Leo and the newbie to contain the slime until you can bring Paige back to vanquish it, okay? Okay, girls, get dressed. You are going to the Summer of Love. Hear the drums. Liquid beats crashing down On parched shores Pounding like the feet of 10,000 soldiers Whispering "why?" - Why? - Right on. Sorry, I just got a little carried away. Don't be sorry, that was gone. - Gone, that's right. - Hey, Robin! That's exactly what I should be, gone, because I'm actually starting to dig... Like this. It's kind of cool, everybody being so free. Robin, come here. You are exactly what we're all about, Paige. Do you wanna hear my dream? I dream of a crusade to rid the world of evil. Not through fighting or the inner anger that makes us wanna fight, but through the magic power of love. Are you sure you're Penny Halliwell? - How long have you felt this way? - Ever since I met Allen. It must be so great to share this together. Your old man's not into magic? He's not so old, but no, not so into it either. Hey, groovy girl, we've been looking for you. Welcome. I'm Penny. Any friends of Paige's are friends of ours. But you shouldn't use magic so openly. That's Grams. I'm Allen. Peace and love. Oh, yes, love. Lots and lots of love. I have so much love for you, man, you have no idea. You here for the happening at the manor tonight? No, we were just looking for our friend Paige, actually. Excuse us. - So glad you guys found me. - We need to get out of here. It's the pigs. Okay, everybody, let's break it up. Let's go, everybody out. Move it. This is a park, man. You can't control God's green earth. It's the taxpayers' green dollars that pay for this park. And you're loitering, so move it. Hell, no, we won't go Hell, no, we won't go Hell, no, we won't go Hell, no, we won't go They have no right They have no power Turn their hate sticks into flowers Let's jam. If the cops catch us, we'll miss tonight. - Piper, freeze them. - I can't. - Come on, let's go. - Paige, come on. Come on. No way, man. If what's happening tonight at the manor is what I think it is, this might be the night that Grandpa dies. Let's just hope that Paige tries to get us out of here first. I don't wanna be raised by that flower child we saw in the park. - We'd never make it to puberty. - You don't own me! You think you own me, but the Man will never own Luther Morris. - I said, keep it down. - No. What are you two looking at? Please, there's gotta be a way to get my friends out of jail. Stay cool, Paige. We've all been hassled by the pigs. It's a rite of passage. They'll let your friends go... ...after a night in jail. Okay, everybody, time to prepare for the party. Take a crystal, bless it and hide it outside the manor. - We wanna form a perimeter. - What are those? Those are pyrite crystals. They resonate a harmonic tone when exposed to evil. Kind of like a demonic alarm system. - How did you know? - I was taught by the best. I thought our gathering tonight was a peaceful one. I wanna give peace a chance as much as anyone, Robin, but I'm not dumb. You know how many covens are coming tonight? - We'll be sitting ducks. - Right. I would really love it if my friends could come tonight. If there's anything that we can do to help them... Tell you what, I got a friend who's an ACLU lawyer. I'll call him... ...right after we set the crystals. Thank you. The way I see it, we're all targets for the slime. We need a plan to control it until the girls get back. In the future, everyone tried to control the demon with no name. - But it can't be done. - That's hardly a winning attitude. And why in heaven's name couldn't the people in the future find some name for that thing? Speaking of the future, what's so awful that happens to Wyatt? - I can't tell you that. - Come on, I'm an Elder. Excuse me, back on point. The slime? - I'm taking suggestions. - We could orb it to an ice drift. - No, that's bad. - It's not bad, it's awful. You can't orb that thing, it feeds on magic. - So, what's your great idea? - Are you giving me lip? No. No! Hold on. I think it stopped. Get Wyatt out of the house. If it tries to follow, I'll fire off an orb or two to distract it. - You okay with that? - Yeah, it's just what I had in mind. Okay. - Any sign of Paige? - Nope. We're not gonna reach her before Grandpa's attacked. - Should we try a spell? - Why not? Let's try a spell. Leave it to the Man to lock the brother up with the crazies. Come to me and be seduced I have a girl to introduce Fall for her, you can't resist her Trust me, mister, she's my sister - Why me? - Because he's not my type. - Hi. - Hi. You know what I think is really hot? A guy in a cage. Yeah. Why don't you come in here with me. All right. Take off your shirt. Hey, hey, hey. Luther don't wanna see this. Put this on. You're gonna lead us to freedom, Luther. A brother could get used to this. So could a brother's son. There's my little psychedelic sunshine. Are you ready for your private session? Yeah. Real soon. Have you seen Allen? He was supposed to call his lawyer friends for me. My name is Leo. Like the zodiac sign. Astrologically speaking, Leo represents the sun. Constantly burning and highly energetic. Okay, starshine. Could you just please point me in the direction where I might find Allen? Thank you. And so I call upon the Crone Let evil roam inside this home I thought you were acting strange. Allen. - Are you spying on me? - How could you, Robin? What about our dream? My only dream is helping my warlock friend put all of you weak creatures out of your misery tonight. Robin. Violence isn't the answer, Robin. Let love replace your fear. I know you've felt our love. Yeah, and I still got the stink of it all over me. Over here! Allen. All right. - What did I just do? - Oh, nothing much. Just changed our entire future. Or erased it. What did it do, split in half? - How do we get out? - I don't know. Orb? The last time I orbed, that thing almost swallowed me whole. - What do you think, Penny? - I think love conquers all. I think that we should take the demon into our arms and make it feel safe. Leo, can I talk to you for a second, please? Do you mind holding him for a second? Of course. Come here, moonbeam. Wyatt. His name is Wyatt. One of the sisters must have changed the past, because Penny clearly never made the change from flower child to demon hunter. We shall not We shall not be moved Clearly. Think the girls can fix the timeline and get back here? I don't know. But this thing's trying to back us into a corner. Take Wyatt and Joan Baez here into the conservatory. I'll gather what we need to fight it off. Has anyone seen Robin? We got a lot of... - What happened? - Robin, she attacked. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm all right. She said something about a warlock attacking tonight. So? That's no problem, you have a house full of witches. Piper's right. You could all take on the warlocks. All you have to do is fight. That's not who we are. We don't believe in murder. No, neither do we. But we do believe in vanquishing evil. I'm sorry, I don't see violence as a solution to anything. I thought you understood that, Paige. - I thought you were one of us. - Let's go. Let's send everyone home. I don't want anyone else getting hurt. Oh, she is driving me nuts. That is not the Grams we all know. The Grams we know found her husband dead tonight. I know we're supposed to turn her into a bit of a killer or whatever, but what if this happens to be her new destiny? With Grandpa. If Grandpa was supposed to die tonight, death will come after him again. The first thing we have to remember is we're not here to change anything. We just need to keep Grams alive, and unfortunately, we don't have our powers. Well, it's a lot thinner than we're used to, but I'm sure we could find something in here to help us make a potion. - Will you help me? - Yeah. I'll be downstairs on warlock watch. Why isn't it attacking? It's like it cornered us and now it's just waiting. I think we need the toaster oven. You know, that's a disaster waiting to happen. That's the idea. You saw how the slime reacted to the electricity. Well, if we can get it to attack this pile, maybe we can get it to zap it. If I could find a place to plug it in. No offence, but, you know, my dear Allen would have taken the path of peaceful resistance. Have you tried talking to the slime? No, I haven't, and you shouldn't either. But if you're up for some conversation, maybe you wanna tell me what happens to Wyatt in the future. Nice try. Got it. Damn it. I told you boys, violence is not the answer to anything. - Where's the fuse box? - It's in the basement. You'll find a flashlight in the laundry room. Leo. What is it? What is it? The slime, in the basement, feeding on nexus. How big was it? - Big. - Yeah. Big. - We were going to make history. - I know, honey. - We need to talk. - I agree. We need to talk with the warlock and find a path of peaceful resistance to resolve this situation. The first thing my Grams taught me was not to reason with demons. - Your grandmother fought demons? - Yeah, she was a great woman. And she knew that you can't reason or negotiate with demons. They kill. And they keep killing until a force of good stops them. If your grandmother hurt other living creatures, she doesn't sound so great to me. I'm sorry. Penny's right. You can't be a saviour and a murderer at the same time. Really? What if a demon attacked somebody you loved? Like your daughter? Would you fight then? Where are all the witches? Where in the hell are all the witches? Where are they? Well, that depends on who you're looking for. - Everybody. - We sent them home. The manor's yours. We won't fight you. Do something. May peace and love From the moon above Flow through your heart On the wings of a dove Did you just try and cast a love spell on me? I'm a warlock. What is this world coming to? No! No. - Allen. - Your turn to join him, sweetheart. Hey. - I think he's gone. - For now. - This isn't right. - What do you mean? Grams flew into a rage when she found Grandpa dead. It made her what she was. Does that look like a demon killer to you? If the demon comes at us, I'll try to hold it off with this. Don't be afraid of us. We won't hurt you. Penny, get back. How are you so calm right now? It's okay for you to be angry. That warlock killed your husband. I am angry. At myself. That's why I'm mixing a binding potion. Binding your magic is not the answer. It is for me. I tried to save Allen and I failed. What good is my magic if it can't save my family? It's a lot of good. Remember your dream? You can't turn your back on it now. What would Allen think? Doesn't matter, he's dead. No one will ever compare to him. I'll probably end up hating men for the rest of my life. - Well, she's got us there. - Magic can save your family. I mean, my sisters have saved... You said these were your friends. What's going on? Who are you? - Don't. Can't change history. - It's a little late now, isn't it? We're your granddaughters. - Hi, Grams. - I'm your Grams? The demon hunter? Yeah, and these fancy boots brought me from the future. - And these earrings. - And this ring. - No, you're trying to trick me. - No, afraid not, Grams. Look, it's payback time. You need to get your act together. We love you, but if you don't start fighting now, all the people we're meant to save... You didn't think I forgot about you? Those were our potions. Wyatt's in the living room. No sign of the demon in the rest of the house. I think it was distracting us before so it could feed on nexus. - What about Penny? Is she? - I don't know. I can't keep up with it, we gotta get out. No, we have to keep fighting. That's what Penny would want us to do. Not quite the slaughter I expected. But it'll have to do for a night's work. Stop. What are you gonna do? Cast another love spell? Well, it's about time. Like you said, Piper, it's okay to fight for someone you love, right? Welcome back to your destiny, Grams. Now she's just showing off. Okay, the grandfather clock. What do I usually do at this point? You usually do something very final, if you catch my drift. Snuff this warlock His days are done But make him good For the ecosystem Now, that's what you call flower power. Not exactly ruthless, but a fine start. That was for Allen. So now what? Now we gotta get home fast because we have a slimy demon of our own to deal with. - How are we gonna do that? - Grams just has to reverse the spell. Glad to know I have groovy grandkids. Just the same, I think I'm gonna work on a forgetting spell for after you go. - You know, keep the cosmic order. - Oh, I like this Grams. I don't want to forget you. - Get out of here, go. - No, not without you. - This thing's gonna swallow you whole. - Most likely. Stand back, fellas. Drawing on the power of three Destroy this evil entity - Where's Wyatt? - He's in the living room. What about Grams? She didn't make it. Nonsense. You can't damage an old warhorse like me. I'm already dead. Yay, Grams. I'm so glad you're back. Hey there, sun god. Hey, that was a long time ago. Let's just keep that between us, okay? Hey, I wanna thank you two for not giving up the fight. I'm really proud of you boys. You did good. Grams gone? Yes, but not before yelling at us for moving out. It was good to hear her yell at us for a change. So did she convince you to move back in? No, but she did give us her blessing after she was done yelling. - Really? - Well, she gave up a lot to be a witch. - You know, she lost Grandpa. - And her dreams. I don't think she wants that to happen to us. But she did make me promise that I would keep in touch more. And I have to promise to keep using my magic. I guess Grams really is a softie underneath it all. - So you guys going home? - Home is a relative term. But, yeah, we're heading out. No, I should get back and finish my origami dragon. Yeah, I understand. Well, you guys know you always have a home here. And a room when you want it back. I mean, if you want it back. Everything all right? No, it's not. I mean, I know it seems to them that I'm moving on with my life and everything's fine, but it's not true. I wish they were still here. - You should tell them that. - No. I shouldn't. I should just go to bed.
