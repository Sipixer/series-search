- Isn't it great? It's... It's something. - You hate it. - No, no. I don't hate anything. It's just... The dining room and then the living room and, you know, when you rearranged the kitchen... I did kinda hate that. You complain about what a mess it is. Yeah, I know, but it's an attic, and it's supposed to be messy. It's not that I don't appreciate you helping around the house, because I do. It's just... It's just a little much. Well, you know, I just... shuffled some things around. "Shuffled"? You call this shuffling? Honey, you built things. You hung things. You bagged things. I mean, what is this? Those are corks. You know, for the potion bottles. - Leave 'em out and they get brittle. - That doesn't seem like overkill? - I'm just trying to help. - I know, honey, and that's very sweet. But, you know, I kinda liked the attic messy. I knew where everything was. - Where did you find that? - Under some blankets. Why? I just... I haven't seen it in years. - Is it wet? - Well, it needed some touch-ups. - Have you gone crazy again? - Look, this isn't easy for me. I know, sweetie. I know. You've been a Whitelighter, an Elder, an Avatar... Don't remind me. The point is, if it's magical, you've done it. So it's not gonna be easy to adjust to life without powers overnight. And tackling all these projects is... a little obsessive. Well, what am I supposed to do? I can't orb. I can't go to the Elders for information. I just want to fit in. I know. But brittle corks? Okay, I guess maybe that was a little much. There is no how-to book on this, okay? We're gonna get through it. Together. Besides, this is what we wanted. Normal. I guess I didn't expect normal to be so hard. Well, you can't force it. And you don't need to. We've got plenty of time. Demon! Oh, no, you don't! Still think we've got time? Did you wound him? Just as you've instructed. Good. - What are you doing? - Trying to ID the demon. That's not what I mean. Why aren't you sitting down? You got hit. Yeah, but it's just a scratch. I think this crescent might be tribal. You're not listening. You're not vanquishing anybody. Why not? Well, for one thing, because you can't self-heal any more. Hunting demons is too dangerous. You can't self-heal either and it doesn't stop you. - Yeah, but I can blow things up. - Yeah, I noticed. Leo... I don't know why you're making a big deal. A demon tried to kill you. Demons try to kill us every week. What do you want me to do, - hide in Magic School? - It's a thought. - I was kidding. - Well, I'm not. It's great that you gave up your powers to be with us and everything, but things are gonna have to change. You've only got one life to live and I'd like you to start taking care of it. Okay. Well, I didn't become mortal to go run and hide. I'm staying put. - Leo, please... - I've made up my mind. Well, I have to clean it, don't I? Hey, little guy. Hey, hey, look. Everything's okay. Look, see? It's just a scratch, okay? It's nothing. Come on, come on! Advanced magical orbing. Tuesdays or Thursdays? Busy? Exactly what I need. - Would you throw that at the calendar? - What? No! Look, a demon... You don't understand. I've been doing schedules all week and I'm going insane. That's exactly what I need to make decisions! - Would you please throw it. Throw it? - Fine. Fridays! Brilliant. I'm glad to see the future of magic is in such capable hands. Just trying to keep things lively. What's up? - A demon attacked Leo. - What? Is he okay? He's fine, but I need you to scry with that thing and then vanquish the demon. I'd do it myself, but I have to get home and protect Leo. - Why didn't you bring him here? - He's being stubborn. So I had to set some crystals to keep him safe. - He let you do this? - He doesn't know. I think there's something you're not telling me. Leo and I are having a little trouble adjusting to him being human again. That would be a big adjustment. We're gonna have to adjust to the fact that he can't heal us any more. Or himself. And I don't wanna keep forcing Wyatt to tap into his powers before he's ready. - Why not? He healed you before. - Yeah, with some help. We can't keep traumatising him. We've got to find another way. - So, you can handle all this? - Absolutely. You might wanna call Phoebe. That thing is probably from some sort of tribe. - Got it! All over it! - Thanks for the help. I have assembled my fiercest warriors. They better be as capable as you claim. The Charmed Ones will be here soon. The Charmed Ones... are coming here? As soon as they scry with your crescent. Why do you think I told you to leave it behind? So, you're luring them into a trap... ...to destroy them. Think you can destroy them with one small tribe? No wonder demons always perish at the hands of those witches. Well, then what exactly is your plan? Your troops and I are gonna keep them busy while you return to the manor to locate the spiritual Nexus, and with it... the Shadow. No demon has been able to harness the power of the Shadow before. Don't get ahead of yourself, Craven. You're only gonna find the Nexus. You won't have time for anything else. And you're sure no one will be home? That's why you wounded their former Whitelighter. If I know theses witches, and I do, they're gonna strike with the full Power of Three. But they won't do that unless Leo is somewhere safe. So, yes, the manor will be empty. Well, I only ask because it seems that those that help you don't always... ...survive. But you attacked at their home and lived. Few can boast that. Take your positions. We're about to have company. Split infinitive, I don't think so... You should really call before you do that. A demon attacked Leo and Piper wants us to take him out. - Think you have enough potion? - Better safe than sorry. - Come on, we should go. - Why do you seem excited? Because we need to protect our brother-in-law, and because we should make a statement. - Because I'm cooped up in Magic School. - All right, let me just go tell Elise. Hey, column's done. I'll see you tomorrow. No, you don't! This time I've got a family emergency. I need you to get the evening edition out. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? What about Dillard? Isn't he your number two? - Richard's out sick. - But I'm just an advice columnist. Surely you're skipping some rungs on the ladder here. Don't sell yourself short, Phoebe. I have faith in you. You owe me. Think of the times I've covered - for your family emergencies. - That's different. - How so? - Because they were my emergencies. So, your life is more important than mine? - No, that's not what I meant. - Good. - I'm sure you'll do a fantastic job. - Phoebe. Just who I was looking for. - Who're you? - Tom Taylor, copy editor. I gotta cut Bauer's column to 1,500 words and he's threatened to kill me. - Gimme a sec. - Excuse me, Phoebe. - Elise said I should talk to you. - Really? - It seems we've oversold ad space. - Well, okay. Elise... - Excuse me. - Hi. Yeah, hi... - Phoebe, I need... - Okay. - Phoebe... - Yeah, just... That's the attic. Good. That's where we are right now. What's this right here? That's Mommy and Daddy's room, right. Yeah. Right there. Very good. - Hey. - Hey. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't it be? Well, you know, seeing as how a demon tried to K-l-L-L you. - Right. Well, I'm fine. - Why are you so defensive? I don't know. I guess maybe I feel like I have something to prove. Leo, I was just trying to protect you. - I know, but you don't need to. - Yeah, obviously I do. Piper, wait! Okay, me and Mommy have to have a grown-up conversation, okay? I'll be right back. Okay, we have ten minutes. What? I told 'em I'd be right back. - It's gonna take what it's gonna take. - I have a deadline. Do you know how much work goes into one edition? - I can't believe Elise just dropped... - Focus! Okay. So now what do we do? I don't know. - Greetings. - Zankou! What are you doing here? Paige, what is he doing here? - How am I supposed to know? - Where's your other sister, Piper? - Why do you want to know? - I have my reasons. We'd love to stay and chat, but we have business that we need to attend to. I know. It's gonna take longer than ten minutes. Why are you so mad at me? Because you're gonna get yourself killed, that's why. Okay, well, I can... I can handle myself. Really? The way you handled yourself this morning? You know, I could have handled that. - How? - I would have thought of something. I'm so glad you would've thought of something. - Now I don't have to worry. - Okay, it was good that you were there. That doesn't give you the right to hide crystals behind my back. I was just trying to protect you. I'm supposed to protect you. - Is that what all this is about? - It's part of it. It's my instinct to protect you, Piper. The reason I don't hide from demons is 'cause I've never had to. - I realise that. - Okay. Well, Wyatt doesn't. He's seen me get hurt, and I don't want that to hurt him. Okay, look, we are going to get through this. I know we are. But you, yourself, said it was gonna take time. Which means I'm gonna make mistakes. Okay, and when I do, I need you to be supportive. You know, not drown the plants. Well, I guess we all have our own ways of dealing with things. Guess so. What are you doing here? - Dining room. - I see where he went. Stay here. Wyatt. Wyatt, get upstairs! Leo! Leo... Are you okay? Yeah. No. Don't let Wyatt see. Honey, why don't you go upstairs? - Mommy and Daddy are fine. - Sweetie, what's the matter? What is he doing? What just happened? Why's he doing this? I have a paper to put out! I'm sure that factored into his decision-making. I don't understand. How'd we go from a demon attacking Leo to Zankou attacking us? Maybe 'cause Leo's mortal, he's making his move. Don't be shy, ladies. You knew this day would come. Take one of these. We have to get back to Piper, and I have to get back to work! I wanna let him know we're in the game. One sister is still at the manor. I know. I have the other two pinned down. Would you turn that thing off! Sorry, but you gotta admire the range. We're in the Underworld. That's good. You're making this too easy. Looking for us? - You missed! - Okay, that's our cue. So much for your plan. Gather the remaining tribe. This may still work. Wyatt. You need to make Mommy and Daddy big again. Maybe he can't hear us. What happened? I don't know. I think Wyatt put some kind of force field on the dollhouse. - Wyatt! Let us out of here! - We know you were trying to help. - Daddy needs to get to the hospital. - You're gonna scare him. That's probably why he put us in here in the first place, to protect us. Great. We're supposed to be protecting him. Okay. Let me handle Wyatt. This requires a mother's touch. Wyatt Matthew Halliwell! You will stop this nonsense right now! - First time you used his full name. - Sounds better when I'm scolding him. I don't think he understands what's going on. All he knows is a demon tried to kill Dad. I don't understand why anyone would attack you. It's not like you're a threat to anyone. I don't understand how a demon thinks the house'd be empty. We're not gonna figure out anything from inside here. At least the furniture is comfortable. You know, for toy furniture. Where'd you get this dollhouse anyway? - Grams made it. - She made it? I didn't know she was a witch back then. So, obviously, she used some sort of magic. It's pretty perfect. Almost perfect. What's that? Wyatt and Chris, what are you doing up here? Paige! - Paige, down here! - Where's your mommy and daddy? I saw what happened downstairs. Okay. All right, babies, we're gonna go to Magic School till we can figure out what happened. I see he's just as stubborn as someone else I know. - Well? - The house is clear. That's what you said the last time. A slight miscalculation. But the plan was to get 'em out of the manor, and they are. Probably circling their broomsticks in Magic School. - So I'm going back for the Nexus? - Except this time I'm coming with you. Follow me. The Charmed Ones' ancestral home. How do we know this isn't a trap? We don't. That's why I asked for reinforcement. Give the command. Spread out. Find the Nexus. - How are we gonna get out of here? - We can't. It's useless. That's all you've got for me? We're supposed to sit and do nothing while you bleed to death on the couch? What do you want me to say? I can't self-heal any more. Without a doctor... - You used to be a doctor. - Yeah, like 60 years ago. Well, start acting like one! Come on, you have to stop focusing on what you can't do, and think about what you can do. - Come on! Lmprovise! - All right. - Grams used to like to sew, right? - Yeah... Where? Wyatt's bedroom used to be her sewing room. Why? Okay... Now what? - Needle and thread. - Excuse me? - Don't worry, I'll walk you through it. - Walk me through what? - Oh, no! No, no, no... - You're the one who said "improvise". Well, since when does anybody listen to me? You can do this. Let's prove to Wyatt we can handle whatever's thrown at us. All right, just... ...pull the skin together and stitch it through. - Sure. Easy for you to say. - I'm ready. Do it. - Are you sure? - Hurry. Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day! Funny, I've been trying to avoid you all day. That's a good one. Listen, I need to get out of here because there's a crisis at home. It's always life and death with you Halliwells. - Can I freshen up those drinks? - Drinks? - What drinks? - Yes, thank you. Wait. What did you say your emergency was? I didn't. I'm so sorry about that, Richard. This moron's trying to take a knife to my column! Well, what seems to be the problem? Obviously, besides the knife. Phoebe, it's a great story. Really, it is. - It's just a bit bloated. - Bloated? I'll show you bloated! You know what? Please don't. Lady, I've been working the beat for 22 years. No lvy League trust funder is gonna tell me how to write the news! - You know... - Fashion editor. Sorry to interrupt, but our so-called film critic has been drinking coffee out of my teacup. I don't know what Jordan's worked up about, it's a two-and-a-half star mug... at best. - Phoebe, we gotta go. - Yeah. I know, I know. I wanna get Zankou as much as you. Where's Piper? That's the problem. Piper and Leo have vanished. - What do you mean? The boys? - The boys are fine. - We have to find their parents. - Let me ask you a question. Ever push the deadline for the evening edition? No. Then it'd be the "sometime in the middle of the night" edition. All right, you know what? I'm gonna go into my office for a very important conference call. No interruptions! Oh, goodness! Hope you got a discount on all that leather. That's something I admire about you ladies. Always a clever remark at the face of danger. Though... I'm insulted. Don't you think I warrant the Power of Three? Does he know where Piper is? No. How would he know about her nail appointment? You'd think she'd be at Magic School attending to her husband. She didn't wanna pay the cancellation fee for the nail appointment. You're lying. Somehow the Power of Two doesn't have the ring to it. Now what? Tie it off and cut it. Scissors. Aren't you happy you became a mortal? At least now we can grow old together - like every other couple. - That is, if we survive this. Wyatt's so worried, he practically locked us up and threw away the key. I'll just have to prove to him that I can take care of myself and my family. Yeah, it would help if we were reinstated to our former size. What's he doing here? Post guards throughout the manor. Soon as they find her, they'll be back. - We need to fend them off. - If we're to find the Nexus? - The Nexus? - Where are Phoebe and Paige? I want more than to find the Nexus. I want to release the Shadow. Harness its ultimate power. Can you do that? Well, now that evil has taken over control of the manor, I can. And I will. I can't believe we've been miniature for two hours and demons take over the house! If Zankou taps into the Nexus... - We're not gonna let that happen. - How? We're three inches tall! We're gonna get to the Book and contact Phoebe and Paige. That Book? 'Cause A, we're trapped. And B, even if we weren't, those demons could squash us with one foot. - Stay calm. - Now you're telling me. Wyatt didn't put us in here to get hurt. He put us in here to protect us. There has to be something we're overlooking. - Blasting doesn't work. - Yeah, I noticed. All the doors, the windows are sealed. Listen, how did you play with the dollhouse when you were little? - What do you mean? - I mean, it's a toy, right? - I think you've lost too much blood. - No, listen to me. If it's a toy, it must open. The roof opens or doors swing open. I don't know. That's a lot of years ago. - It might be our only shot. Think. - I think it swung open. Where? Here. Damn it! Blast it. - Blasting doesn't work. - Maybe the force field only covers the windows and the doors. So, you know, do it. - Now what? - Follow me. - I believe we've loc... - Do you have any idea how upset - Piper was when her sister died? - Sorry? Listen to this. "Prue was always the strong one. Now that she's gone, I don't know if we'll have the strength to keep fighting for good. - Or if it's even worth it." - Yes, well, if only... Humans are slaves to their own emotions. And the strongest emotion is love. That's why Piper didn't leave her husband's side to fight. That was my miscalculation. They would go through hell to stay together. What is it? I believe we have found the Nexus. You gotta give me one sec. Any luck with Piper? I've scried the universe and there's no sign. Please come back to Magic School with me. - Give me two minutes. - Our sister is missing! There's 50 jobs on the line if the paper doesn't come out. You can cancel the subscription to our house if the demons don't get out. Just give me one minute. Okay... Check this out. Do you think I'm gonna let Ask Phoebe rewrite me? Read now, bitch later! Okay? So you oversold the space. Let me see the ads. - Shrink 'em and print 'em both. - We can't do that. Advertisers were promised a certain size. Make the font bigger. If they complain, send them a bottle of Cristal on my tab. Actually, on Elise's tab. - What do you think? - It works. That's what I like to hear. Who's next? First, my teacup. Now he's on my computer. You know what? Isn't this kind of obvious? - What? - He likes you. Any other questions? No. Okay. I will be in my office, in a meeting. - Can you believe those guys? - At least they're not pre-pubescent. Paige, Piper, demons. Are you sure this is a good idea? - The Nexus... - The Nexus is neutral. Controlled by whomever controls the manor. The Shadow is the ultimate power. It could destroy us all. Well, then if I'm wrong, it's been a pleasure. Good must still be present in the manor. No, no. That's not possible. You expelled the witches yourself. Only two. That means the third one must still be here. That's probably what they came here for. So, what do we do? We find her. Are you okay? My arms are sore, but I'm not the one with a hole in my back. All right. Let's tweak the scrying spell so - Phoebe and Paige know where we are. - Don't think they've scried? It wouldn't have worked. Wyatt's shield would have protected us. Must be the reason Zankou didn't know where we are. - And now that we're out? - We have to hurry. All right, help me flip these pages. - Wait. I got a better idea. - What? Look out. - You think they noticed? - I don't know. - Hope this works. - It has to. This whole calling a lost witch stuff is harder without the Book. Maybe we didn't scry hard enough. Should we try again? I told you it didn't work. Okay! Okay, you know what? It says a pinch of rosemary, Paige. A "pinch". Sorry. I wasn't paying attention. I'm glad to know the future of magic is in such good hands. People have been telling me that a lot lately. Oh, my God. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Yeah, and I don't believe it. What? That's our house. Piper must be there. Or it's a trap. But scrying is witch-to-witch stuff. It has to be her. But the house is crawling with demons. How are we gonna find her? - One way to find out. - Oh, God. We gotta get past the guard. We can't use magic, otherwise Zankou'll sense us. Can't use magic? What do you call orbing? Okay, fine. Then we won't use any more magic. I have an idea. She's here. She's here. I know she's not alone. Speed the search. We've got company. Yes, sir, but... We may have already found Piper. Okay, that was a really great plan. Well, I didn't use magic, did I? Where do we begin? The Book. Piper? Where are you? Looking for these? The mighty Charmed Ones. The most famous witches of all time. So many demons have tried to kill you. - What do you see? - Demons. And now that the moment is here, it's almost... anticlimactic. Maybe for you it is. - Perhaps you'd like to go first. - Hold on. You need us... to open the Nexus. Nice try. Shall I start with you instead? No because you need us to get the Shadow. I'm listening. - What are they doing? - They're stalling! Kill them and evil will control the Nexus this time. - This time? Do you mean you've tried? - I bet they lost some demons too. Yeah, we've had some experience with the Nexus. They're lying! No... I read Piper's diary. I guess I'll need to make her big again for you to do this. Zankou. They just want you to restore the Power of Three. But what's that compared to the power of the Shadow? - So, what is in it for you? - We live to fight another day. And if we do die, we go down kicking and screaming. - I'm not leaving you. - You have to. If Zankou gets the Shadow, then we'll never stop him. The Shadow won't know where to go. I might've lost powers, but I didn't lose what I know about magic. Trust me. Do what he wants. Hey, put me down! - You try anything... - Damn it, I said put me down! ...and you will lose the love of your life. Any idea how we're gonna get out of this one? No, but I'm hoping Leo does. Proceed. What's happening? Leo? What have you done? So close. I told you we should have killed them. Never tell me, "I told you so". Leo. Leo, you don't want this. Say the spell. I am light I am one too strong to fight So go away and leave my sight and take with you this endless night Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. - What happened? The Shadow couldn't choose between Zankou's evil or the Power of Three. So it went to the only neutral territory... ...me. See, I told you it was a good thing you gave up your powers. So, all that power surging through your veins didn't make you miss the old days? No, I chose the girl. Remember? It would be a shame not to put all that magical knowledge to good use. Oh, my God! Isn't that your boss, Elise? Oh, my God, it is! So much for her family emergency. - She's with Richard Dillard. - Who's that? The guy that should've been running the paper. If she's here, maybe she wants you to know that - she does have a life outside work. - I guess. You know what? Good for her. You're not gonna call her on it? I'm not gonna buy her a new BlackBerry, but all the times I've bailed, who can blame her? Wow. Enlightened. You learn a lot from walking in someone else's shoes. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of, what Zankou has found out about us. I don't think we've seen the last of him. Well, on that unhappy note, I gotta get back to the manor and clean up the mess after the demons. It's probably gonna take a while to sort it all out. - Here we go again, huh? - Yeah. As for me, as much as I would like to find a little cutie to dance with, I should be getting back to Magic School to finish those schedules. Au revoir, adults. Surprise. What? You want me to clean Magic School? No, we want you to run it. What's going on here? We were thinking since you're dying to try something new... And Leo being perfect for the job. Considering your magic know-how, you're practically a walking Book of Shadows. Well, I have wanted to get out and spread my wings. And with Leo, the school is still in good hands. Well, I... I don't know what to say. Paige? I'm good. Well, that was easy. Leo? I'd be honoured. Good choice. Hi. Guess what? You don't have to worry
