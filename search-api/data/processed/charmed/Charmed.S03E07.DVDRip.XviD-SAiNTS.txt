I don't know. It just seems like whenever I get close to you... ...you pull away from me. Why do you do that? What are you so afraid of telling me? Phoebe, don't. I wanna know. I deserve to know. Phoebe, you don't know what you're asking. Whatever it is, you can't keep running from it. And you can't keep pretending that it's not coming between us. You can't keep hiding from the truth. That wasn't so difficult, was it? - What are you doing here? - Reminding you of your inner nature, Belthazor. One that would be in your best interest to reconnect with soon. - I won't let you down. - You already have. You vowed to destroy the witches. Instead you bedded one of them. That was a mistake. Find demonic help if you have to, Belthazor. But you better find a way to kill the witches or... ...we'll kill you. All right, look, we know that Belthazor is not going to stop until he kills us. Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi. I hate to interrupt your whole "staring off into space aimlessly" thing that you got going on right now, but in case you forgot, - evil Triad agent. - Like you would ever let me forget. Well, if he's as powerful of a demon as Leo says he is, he's going to be immune to our powers. That's why we need to practice our counterattacks, so the next time he shows up, we can get some demon flesh. White meat or dark meat? Well, I don't like the idea of demon fillet either, but it might help us with the vanquishing potion. Hello. Pheebs. Cole is 45 minutes late. You would think he would be on time after he sleeps with a girl, you know. Can we fast-forward, because I got Fastball coming in in a couple of days, - and I need to get some stuff done. - Cole. He's here. He's here. "I'm sorry, but we have to stop seeing each other, okay? Why? Because... Because I gotta kill you, that's why." Smooth. All right, we are practicing the... - Sorry I'm late. - It's okay. The earthquake drill tomorrow at 3. Sorry, Madam President, but I have a doctor's appointment. Piper, you never know when an earthquake is going to strike. I guess not. I guess I will reschedule then. - Phoebe, we need to talk. - Phoebe, - earthquake drill tomorrow at 3. - Okay, but if you need me there by 3, you have to loan me your car. I have class afterwards. That's fine. Just try not to leave my gas tank on empty this time. I left your gas tank empty once, okay? Get over it. Let it go. - I'm sorry, what were you saying? - Twice. - Actually, if we could... - Oh, and, Pheebs, I need the car back by 5 because I have a photo shoot at P3 tomorrow. P3? Did you forget to inform the owner of P3? I'm sorry, but my location fell out at the last moment, and I couldn't find you. I thought you'd say yes. Of course you did. And did you forget about the homeowners' meeting - that's at our house tomorrow? - I totally spaced. - Pheebs, will you cover for me? - No way. In the last one, it took them two and a half hours to decide where to put the garden gnomes. All right, do you want the car or not? - I hate you. - No, you don't. You love me. I'd love to get back to work. Okay, you two kids behave. Sorry about that. Sister stuff. You know, there's a fine line between love and hate. So, what did you wanna talk about? Actually, I have to go. - Wait, what? - I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just this... ...big case I've been working on. I think I just had an epiphany on how to win it. Forgive me. Tell the Triad I've figured out how to destroy the Charmed Ones. No, I'm planning on getting to P3 early to confer with the stylist. All right, I'll see you there. Bye. - Hey, where's Phoebe? - I'm here. - Do you guys know if Cole called? - Not since the last time you asked. Okay, I need some sisterly advice. Is he doing the "blow her off after sex" thing, and I'm just not reading the signs? Probably not, since the signs Prue read as an empath prove that he loves you. Okay, well, supernatural guarantees aside, I am getting the feeling that he is avoiding me. I mean, I have no idea where we stand. Well, maybe it's got something to do with whatever he's hiding from you. Demon! Piper, watch out. Excuse me. Piper, now. You got skin. Hey, Leo, do you think you could make yourself look like Brad Pitt? All right, guys, that was good. Although, Phoebe, I think you need more force on your kick, and, Piper, less hesitating on the slicing and dicing. Should we try it again? No, I'd like to have a boyfriend left when this is over. Okay, where are your keys, Prue? Hey, don't forget to pick up food for the homeowners' meeting. Okay, now how am I possibly gonna pick up food when I have to get your car back right away? Well, I can't do it. I have to prep for my shoot. What? Don't look at me. I guess I'll reschedule my doctor's appointment again. You're cute. Have you ever destroyed siblings? Sisters? Sisters. I pit nations against each other. I start wars, riots. I've reviewed your résumé, Andras. Rather unfocused, actually. My needs are very particular. I can infect anybody. Anybody who's angry. That's your way in, through anger? I see it in my victims. It envelops them. Then I turn that anger into rage. Rage that continues until they commit an act of violence. Think you could work your magic on the Charmed Ones? You said sisters, not witches. But they are sisters first and foremost. And that, I believe, is their Achilles' heel. Break that bond, and we break the very foundation of their powers. Without their powers, they're defenceless. Which sister shall we start with? The most vulnerable. The youngest. Class went late, and then I had to go to the library to get a book for psych class, so I'm running a little late, but I will be there. Yeah, very funny, I was born late. I promise I'll be there, okay? I'll be home... - soon. Gotta go. Bye. - What are you doing here? - I got a break in my case, decided to take the afternoon off. Well, that must have been quite an epiphany you had last night. Yeah, it was. I came to apologise, Phoebe, for walking out on you so abruptly. That was rude. Yeah, it was rude. I'd love to make it up to you. I made early dinner reservations at Risso's. I have to get Prue's car back. I was hoping we could talk. About what? About the other night, you and me, where we stand. I would like to. I actually would really like to, but I promised Prue that I'd do the homeowners' meeting tonight, so... That's all right. I understand. It was worth a try. Cole... ...I could probably get Piper to handle the meeting. Yeah? You sure she won't be angry? Oh, she's gonna be furious, but she'll just suppress it and take it out on me later. You pick me up in an hour? I'll be there. - A restraining order? - Oh, yes, yes, a countersuit, - and my son is a lawyer. - Your son is a fool, probably. Oh, watch the... Prue! Welcome to Prue's world of cluttered photography. I can't believe I got roped into this. How did you get roped into heading the refreshment committee? - They didn't have time. - And you do? Well, my doctor's appointment doesn't count as high priority. Well, couldn't you make something simpler? You know, chips and dip? Leo, I was a chef. I can't make chips and dip. Maybe you need to tell your sisters how you feel. Next time, just say no. Okay, Leo, you obviously do not have sisters. One minute you're arguing about something, and then suddenly you're arguing about who stole whose Malibu Barbie in 1979. - Hey, is Phoebe home yet? - No. And where...? Where is all the mineral water? - There's some down in the basement. - I'll get it. It's our property, it's our money, and we are building a fence. Goat-cheese pizza and onion tartlets for the vegetarians. - Thank you, dear. - We've had enough of your snooping. - Snooping? - Snooping. The chicken satay has peanuts, in case anybody's allergic. Oh, thank you very much. Phoebe. - Nice of you to show. - Piper... Look, we have talked to a lawyer, and according to the bylaws, - we have the right to... - I need a huge favour. - Can I talk to you upstairs? - Oh, no, you don't. Phoebe. Phoebe, this is not fair. I know it's not, but the last thing I expected was for Cole to ask me out, okay? So could you please cover for me? I already rescheduled my doctor's appointment twice. Well, Leo was a doctor before he died. - That's really not the point. - I know. And I would never ask, but this is important. He wants to have the talk. You know, are we a couple, are we a one-nighter, are we friends, are we friends that had a one-nighter? Okay, I get it. Ever planning on unfreezing the neighbours? Piper, just this once. You know how much I want this relationship to work. Well, I guess I don't have much of a choice. You are so helping me run this meeting. - They're calling. - No, no, no. No, Leo. You chicken. You can't put a fence up right between the neighbours like that. Andras. If Phoebe's right, Piper will be primed and ready for you. I thought we were starting with Phoebe. We did. I did. She's the reason Piper's angry, and she'll be the reason Prue gets angry. You just make sure you're there to capitalise on that. Don't you need me to enrage all three of the sisters for your plan to work? You infect Piper and Prue, I'll bring Phoebe back home. They'll blame her for everything. Your legend is well-deserved, Belthazor. You know, for someone about to score one of the biggest victories in centuries... ...you don't seem very happy about it. Just do your job. Your fence will block the sun from my flowers. Well, then I suggest you take it up with the sun. - Oh, great. Great idea. - Okay. Why don't you build a shorter fence or move your flowerbed? No, it is not my azaleas that are the problem here. - Then we'll see you in court. - Okay, okay. - Everybody, please try to calm down. - Bye, honey. Phoebe, Phoebe. Phoebe! - Those are my earrings. - Okay. Hey! All right. Everybody shut up. I have had it with your petty problems and your stupid fence and your stupid flowerbed. There are bigger problems in the world to worry about. Just get a life and grow up. - You can't speak to us like that. - Oh, yeah? Everybody out of my house. Get out of my house before I throw you out. - With pleasure. - Go on! They should build a fence to keep you in. - Good idea. - I'll speak to your sister - about the way you behave. - Better idea. Move it, move it, move it. And stay out. Wait, you actually wore a penguin costume? - Yes, and l... Yes. - No. And I handed out balloons to kids. I was 15, leave me alone. I needed a job. Bet you were cute. - I had to do this walk. - No, no. Don't... Yes, I had to do the walk. Like this. You've come a long way, haven't you? Yeah. Yeah, I think I have. And of course, I'm still living with my two sisters, and still going to college, you know. And eventually, I'd like to work past that. You don't like living with your sisters? It's more out of necessity. But it... You know, enough about me. Tell me about you. Am I the only person with a past here? Mine's not very interesting. More secrets. I don't like to talk about my past much. Or my family. I lost them a long time ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how that feels. I never knew my mother. And my father left when I was really little. So we were raised by my grandmother. And she's not with us anymore. - But you still have your sisters. - Yeah. And I thank God for them every day. I don't know what I would do if I lost them. You okay? Phoebe, there's something I have to tell you. I'm a terrible dancer. You're a terrible dancer. Something tells me that's not what you were gonna say. Come on. - Come on. - No. No, really, I can't... Okay, look, if we're not gonna talk about us, - No. - and we're not gonna talk about you, - we're gonna dance. Come on. - I can't. You can. Why would you bring me here if you're not gonna dance? I'm sorry I didn't make it. No, I didn't forget. I loaned my car to someone, and obviously... They obviously forgot to fill the tank. Keep it down, will you? All right, look, one more chance is all that I'm asking for. - Where's Phoebe? - The little witch is not home yet. No, tomorrow at P3 will not be a problem. - Okay. - Actually, excuse me. Hi. Actually, you know what? It is. Okay, all right. Do you have any idea who that was? I could care less. - What is your problem? - You are. Get your own damn club, and keep your paws off of mine. Okay, whoa. Obviously, somebody needs a Midol. And I am so sick of all your stuff laying around. If you can't put your equipment away, then I will. Who the hell do you think you are? I had a great time tonight. Better than being at the homeowners' meeting? A little. Okay, you're married. - What? - That's the big secret, you're married. You have three kids and two dogs and a really cute cat, right? - And I'm the seven-year itch? - You found me out. Can't get anything past me. No, I guess not. About the other night. Are you sorry that we? Not at all. Are you? Depends on what happens next. Too bad you can't predict the future. Who says I can't? Are you sure you don't wanna come in? Better get back to the case, you know? Right. - Phoebe. - Yeah. Goodbye. Night. "Sure, you can use P3 for a photo shoot." Hello. Remember me? Oh, poor Piper. Well, you know what? - The martyr routine's getting old. - Hey, what's going on? - Shut up! - Shut up! You know what? Sorry I didn't check with you about your stupid club, but I was too busy being concerned about the Triad. Oh, right, without the mighty Prue Halliwell, we'd all be dead. - Get over yourself, Prue. - Sisters, what's gotten into you two? By the way, you owe me for a car tow and a tank of gas, you little leech. Sorry, is it Gang Up on Phoebe Day and nobody told me? Newsflash, the world does not revolve around Phoebe. Yeah, so while you get to spend the night screwing the DA, we are stuck picking up your slack. What's the matter, Prue, jealous? All work and no play making you even more boring? Oh, yeah, there's a lot to be jealous of. Jealous that I'm still in school, jealous that I'm still unemployed and jealous that I am still living off of my sisters? Grams said you'd never amount to anything. I am so sick of the fact that I have been saddled with the two of you my entire life. - Whatever, I'm leaving. - Oh, sure. You're such an immature brat. You leave every time you can't hack something. There's nothing keeping me here, now is there? Oh, well, I see that you inherited Dad's talent for bailing. That's because the two of us couldn't deal with living with the two of you. Well, at least I'm not so stupid I had to do college twice. Well, at least I actually had the courage to go away to college. What's the matter, Piper, the real world too much for you? I am so sick of the two of you ganging up on me and judging me. I am so sick of saving your asses. I'm sick of being taken for granted, and those are mine. Bitch. - Here. - Sorry. I'll get it. Thanks. - What's wrong? - You tell me. - Well, we had a little... - Tiff. Must have been more than little, because they felt it. - What do you mean, they felt it? - Whatever happened - severed the power of three. - Leo, that's impossible. Freeze this. - What happened to our powers? - That's what we have to figure out. Let's start with your little tiff. Well, that's a bit of an understatement. It was big. How big? Do you remember Pearl Harbor? Okay, so, what triggered it? I don't know. Just little things, I guess. I really didn't want to do this stupid meeting and... My car ran out of gas. And because of that, I missed my job. - That's it? - Yeah, I mean, it's weird. We were angry, but we shouldn't have been that angry. - It was almost like something... - Something sort of came over us. Yeah, like, something like Belthazor. It doesn't track. No matter what he does, he doesn't have the power to take away yours. So back to your argument. You yelled, and you threw stuff? Well, we did a little bit more than that. We used our powers. On each other? All right, well, then that's what happened. Your powers are rooted in your bond as sisters. Using them against each other must have severed that bond. All right, you need to repair the damage to your relationship fast, because without your powers, you are extremely vulnerable. - You need to get Phoebe... - Phoebe's gone. Gone? Where? Cole? Cole? Hi. Phoebe, what are you doing here? I don't know. I was just walking around and... I'm sorry, I know it's really late. Can I come in? Yeah. Sure. I had nowhere else to go. It's okay. I'm glad you came here. What happened? After... After you dropped me off... ...my sisters and I got into a huge fight. It was horrible. You're safe here. Nothing. I can't find her. We don't even have basic powers anymore. I cannot believe this is happening. What I don't understand is how could Belthazor make us that angry? - That's not his power. - No, it's not, but it is his. "Andras, the spirit of rage, uses anger as a portal to enrage his victims until they commit a grievous act of violence." Yeah, but that doesn't really explain everything. I mean, even if our fight was supernaturally amped, Andras magnifies anger into rage, he doesn't just create it out of thin air. So we gave him the opening. And he took full advantage. I was just so angry. And I said such horrible things to them. And l... I didn't even really mean any of it. I'm sorry. No. Please. Let me get you a tissue. Here. The things that were said, I don't even know where they were coming from. I mean, I guess it's issues, you know, that were underlying that we never really dealt with, and then... ...now all of a sudden, just exploded. Nothing ever happened like that before? Oh, no. Not like that. I mean, we used to fight all the time when we were little, you know? But since we moved in together, we just... We got really close, you know. We... We've been through so much together. Thank you for listening to me. And thank you for being there for me. I can't. I can't. What do you mean? Oh, Phoebe. You need to go home. Now. What? Why? Because you're... ...vulnerable right now. I don't... We shouldn't do this. You need to go home. You need to go and figure out what happened. You're right. I do. Thank you. You're welcome. So the rumours are true. You've fallen for a witch. - What are you doing here? Get out. - The great Belthazor. Who would've ever thought? I can hardly wait to see what the Triad will do when I tell them you failed. I'll kill you before you ever get the chance. Yeah? Then you really are a traitor, aren't you? Pissed off, are you? Good. Because there's something you don't know about me. I can possess my victims too. Now, let's go finish what we started, shall we? Yeah. Well, if you hear from her, just tell her to call home, okay? It's an emergency. Thanks. So she's not at the club, and none of her friends have seen her. - Did you try Cole? - No answer. If something happens to her, I'll never forgive myself. - Nothing is gonna happen. - Leo, something happened to Grams, something happened to Mom. It kind of runs in the family. - Phoebe, thank God. - Has the tribal council spoken? Am I booted off the island? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Where were you? I was at Cole's. And after a lot of talking and a lot of tears, he convinced me to come home and deal with what happened. - Belthazor is what happened. - What? Abbreviated version, he used some underling spirit to enrage us. And when we fought, we lost our powers. No more triquetra, - no more power of three. - We have no powers? - But that means that... - That he's gonna try and come kill us. Which, when you didn't come home, we thought that he had already... No, it's okay. I'm fine. So, what do we do, a spell, a vanquish, a potion? You need to try and restore your bond as sisters. I'll give you some privacy. - A potion would be easier, huh? - Oh, yeah. Phoebe, Grams didn't say you'd never amount to anything. That was just me being mean. She was... Is very proud of you. Well, we all know that sometimes I'm not the most responsible person in the world. No, Phoebe. That's all kind of ancient history, isn't it? I mean, you've grown up a lot, and I'm sorry if I don't treat you like you have - all the time. - It's okay. - And since Mom died... - You did take care of us. And you do still look out for us all the time. And we don't always say thank you. Sometimes we take you for granted. I don't think I'm the one who's been taken for granted around here. You know, who needs Oprah when we can do it ourselves? Do you think we have our powers back? All right, no. You try. - Oh, mine aren't working either. - We worked on our issues. - Leo! - No, wait. You guys run. - I'll hold him off. - No, Prue. We're in this together, no matter what. Look, the book. - Okay, that's new. - Demon with demon filling. Nobody crosses me. Okay, positions. Hey. Piper. Piper, the knife. - He's gone. - At least for now. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Good thing I'm already dead. - Did you get him? - Oh, yeah. I got a slice. The other white meat. Better him than me. Well, at least now we could work on a vanquishing spell. Well, we better hurry before Belthazor's encore. Hey, how did the photo session go? Not as good as if it had been done here, but definitely better for our relationship. Well, next time just give me some warning, and I'll be happy to accommodate you. Oh, I promise. By the way, how was your doctor's appointment? It was fine. Everything was normal except my stress level. Oh, I don't mean to stress you out even more, but I ran into Allen and Claire, and they said they worked everything out with Mrs. Snyder. - What did you say to them anyway? - Oh, nothing, I just spoke my mind. Maybe you should handle all the meetings. No. Absolutely not. Wow, you're getting good at saying no. Thank you. Anyway, I think it's good that we got everything out on the table. And for the sake of innocents everywhere, I think we should always just tell each other how we feel. Well, not always. We might kill each other. Okay, then most of the time. Just enough to keep demons away from splitting us up. I agree with that. - Haven't heard from Cole yet, huh? - No. I still can't figure that guy out. But I will. I warned you, Belthazor. I warned you what would happen if you failed us. He's done more than fail us. He's betrayed us. You've betrayed The Source. You showed sympathy to the witches. And squandered a golden opportunity.
