lunch regarding the Lowe estate. That will affect my 2:30 slide presentation and my 4:30 meeting with the new printers. Have you confirmed Mrs Swanson yet? - The last Tae Bo class is at 7. - Okay. I can meet the printers at their office, walk to the Royal Hotel afterwards, for my 5:30 with Mrs Swanson. I just have enough time for kickboxing class. Wait a minute, Mrs Swanson's plane is delayed. She'll be in at 6. - Her plane doesn't arrive until 6? - Well, so much for Tae Bo. - That's your phone. I will get it for you. - Thanks, it's probably Jack. You don't have time for Jack, literally. Prue Halliwell's phone. - This is Mr Caldwell's office. - It's Mr Caldwell's office. It's the new VP. Monique, why is Mr Caldwell calling me at home? What emergency staff meeting? - When this morning? - Nine-thirty. Be there, or be fired. - I'm on my way! - Bye. - I am very tired now. I need a nap. - Yeah. Well, I need another me. I don't even have time to have fun anymore. - Look who it is. - Morning. - Hi. Do you recognise that person? - Yeah, she looks vaguely familiar. Kind of like a sister that we used to have. What was her name? - Pipper? - No. Whatever happened to her? I don't know. She fell in lust with the next-door neighbour, started spending all of her time there. That's because she could. For the first time in months, her life was nice and calm and normal. I don't even care that it's Friday... Don't even say it. The 13th. See, I said it, and nothing happened. - I told you not to say it! - So this is my fault? - Run! - No! Get your butt over here right now! - Like I need this today. - Since when do demons use bullets? - Maybe it's not a demon. - Who else would wanna kill us? Well, you know, you were a little sharp to the mailman yesterday. We all know how testy they can be. - Freeze. - Kick. - Send flying. - Okay. Oh, my God, she's not a demon. Multiple aliases. Foreign currency. And throwing stars? Not exactly Avon calling. "Sutro Heights Apartments." That's scary, she didn't live too far from here. Well, what's even scarier is we've never been attacked by a mortal before. Yeah, I never killed a mortal before either. - Prue, you had no choice. - Still doesn't make it any easier. Does it make it easier if the mortal was a hit woman? - A list of names, so... - Yeah, look closer. We're on it, or at least one of us is. P. Halliwell, and other than an M. Steadwell, we're the only other name not crossed off. A hit woman. Someone obviously hired her. Someone who knew that we had powers. I mean, look. "Prue: Telekinesis. Piper: Power to freeze. Phoebe: Negligible." What? Negligible? Well, that explains why she drove us to the front door and surprised us from behind. Still, why would a demon hire a mortal to kill us? It doesn't make any sense. I just wish we knew about that part of the equation before we called... Darryl, hi. Thanks for coming. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I actually wanna be here. Depends on whether or not you actually tell me the truth this time. - Someone tried to kill us. - You see who it was? - She's in there. - She? We were just sort of standing here, talking, and suddenly she started shooting up the place. A hit woman, we think. Who obviously wanted us dead. We were on her list. And that's why you're standing here alive, and she's in here riddled with bullets? Darryl, it was self-defence. You can check her gun if you don't believe us. The only fingerprints that you're gonna find on it are hers. Begs the same question. How come she's got the bullets in her body if you didn't fire the gun? Do you really wanna know, Darryl? Tell me. We're witches. We... We have powers. And we think that there's a... How do I put this? A demon behind this. The only way for us to find out who it is is if you can keep all of this quiet for as long as possible. Let me see the book. There are nine names that are crossed out. Besides us, there's only one other name that's not crossed out. "Plastique, 10 a.m." Plastic explosives. For all we know, she's already got someplace rigged to blow. Maybe it's someplace M. Steadwell's supposed to be at at 10. Okay, well, it's after 9 already. I'll check DMV, see if I can get an address. I'm gonna go with you. Then Prue and I can go to her apartment and see if we can find anything there. After we make a quick pit stop at Buckland's. - Are you kidding? - I can't lose my job. Hey, what do we do with the...? I can call in a favour and put the body on ice, but that's not gonna buy you much time. One day, max. As the new regional VP of Buckland's auction houses, I'll be implementing a new course of action for a new millennium. The problem is, I don't know any of you well enough to know who's worth keeping. And who's not. - You're late, partner. - We are not partners. - Do you wanna bet? - You, dark hair. Yeah, the one who tried to sneak in late. What's your name? My name? Prue... Prue Halliwell. Yeah, right. Okay, you'll be partnered with Sheridan there. Every employee in this room and their partner has until tomorrow night to scour through the obits, do whatever you have to do to raise $100,000 of auction material. - Yes? - By tomorrow? If you wanna keep your job. Welcome to the new Buckland's. Whoa, I guess we better clear the decks, huh? Prue, we might even have to work over dinner. - Dinner, no. L... - Come on. - We're in this together, aren't we? - Yeah, but... Prue? Prue? Prue, have you even heard a word I've said? No. I'm feeling a little... ...weird. I'll be... What the hell just happened? I don't know. I think it was some sort of a... ...astral projection. - How did you do it? I just felt this sort of desperate need for there to be two of me, and all of a sudden, there was. Do you think this is part of your powers growing? Maybe. I mean, if I can move things with my mind, why not my body? Well, let's just get out of here before it happens again. Hey, you know, you can ask me anything you want about being a witch. No, thanks. It's really cool. We have this book called the Book of Shadows. - Too much information. - But it's... Nothing I wanna know about. I'm serious. I don't wanna know anything. Come on, you don't even want to know if we, like, can fly or anything like that? I don't even wanna know if you own a broom, a skillet, a cauldron, a DustBuster. I don't give a damn! Phoebe, I stare down death every day. But I'm trained to handle it. And that's in this world. I don't know if I wanna be dragged into another. You know, I think it's too late, Darryl. But we won't let anything happen to you, I promise. Are you sure this is the right address? Better hope so. It's the only M. Steadwell registered. Damn, it's almost 10:00. Is that her? No, don't! No! - My God! Everybody okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay, Ms Steadwell? - It worked. I can't believe it. I cast a protection spell, and it actually worked. My first spell. Don't tell me she's a witch too. Look at this place. Lalique fixtures, silk-woven rugs. I could get used to living here in a hurry. Yeah, you just have to know who to kill. I'm gonna check the kitchen. All right. I'll get the bedroom. Oh, my. Faux. Nice. She must not have lived here long. All the mail is marked "resident." - Were you twirling? - No. But opportunity knocked, and I did answer. Check out this wardrobe. - Prue, honey, focus. - I can't. It's not just the clothes. Wigs, makeup kits, prosthetic enhancements. I wonder if anybody knew what she really looked like? - I doubt it. - And if it weren't for the roses, we wouldn't even know what to call her. - What roses? - They're in the living room, addressed to Ms Hellfire. Really? "Until we meet at last. Bane." Don't move. Don't even flinch, or you're dead. That's it. Now slowly turn around. Watch her hands. She can kill you with them in a second. Ms Hellfire, I presume. - You Bane? - His right-hand man, DJ. Bane is very unhappy with you. He'd like to see you now. Okay, sorry to disappoint you, boys. Let's go, get out of here, come on. You know, they think I'm Hellfire. - So? - So maybe I should go with them. I mean, maybe the best way to find out who hired her is to pretend to be her. - Okay, that's very funny, let's go. - Piper, I'm serious. You said yourself that nobody knows what she looks like. Certainly not this Bane guy. Well, Prue, somebody might know what she looks like. Yeah, but I can protect myself. I mean, I have something that they don't have, something that guns can't even compete with. Today may not be the best day to boast about your powers. Okay, look, if this hit woman was hired by a demon, then it's only a matter of time before he finds out that P. Halliwell is still alive and send someone else. So we have to do something. I mean, if you got any better ideas, I'm certainly game. - I know, and unfortunately, I don't. - Okay, so unfreeze them. Is it just me, or are you a little too eager to play this role? - It's not a bad role to play. - True. - If you wanna get yourself... - I'll be fine. You gonna make this easy or not? Put that thing away before you hurt yourself. I swear to God, Bane. I tried to get the money for you, but I messed up. I messed up. I was scared. I didn't know how you were gonna react. You lied to me. - I didn't know. I didn't know. - You made a mistake. And you're sorry for it, right? Right. Yeah. Well, lesson learned, all right? Just never lie to me again. - Understood? - Thank you. Well... You are more beautiful than I imagined. And we finally meet. Did you like the roses? I would have preferred orchids. Beautiful and honest. Let's take a walk. You know what to bring. What do I call you? What you always call me. Ms Hellfire seems so cold in person. Unless your e-mails to me have just been a tease. - I think you know me better than that. - Do I? You didn't confirm the Halliwells this morning. I didn't have a clean shot. Well, that's disappointing. What about the last one on the list? Steadwell? It was a blast. I like your style. I always have. The problem is, you still got the Halliwells, but you only got until midnight to take them out. Don't worry about the Halliwells. I know their every move. I'm getting a lot of pressure, you know. - From who? - You know who. Of course. Aren't you gonna answer that? Yeah. - Hello. - Hey. What happened to you this morning? You completely disappeared. - I'm with a client. - Yeah, well, that better be a rich client. - Time is money. - Champagne? Champagne, at this hour? Where are you? - Me? - To us. Hey, Prue, you know me, I'm all for a good time. But we're under some serious pressure here. Yeah, I know... - Are you there? - Oh, God. Prue. You all right? What happened? Prue, what the hell is going on? I'll call you back. Sorry. Maybe you better hold off on this one, huh? At least until the job is completed. Guess I'd better be going. You're not going anywhere. Not without my driving you. - Tell him I'm on it. - Wait a minute, why me? I don't even know the guy. You will. Just go to my office. He'll show, okay? Looking for me? - Where in the hell did you come from? - You really don't wanna know. Trust me. Why aren't the witches dead? - Witches? - Answer me. How did you know they weren't dead? One develops a... ...sixth sense about such things when you've been in purgatory as long as I have. Never mind. I made a deal. It gives me a 24-hour window to break free. But now, you people, you gotta kill those witches if I'm going to be successful. Who are you? A demon. A demon who has the power. A power to turn the innermost fears of a mortal into reality. And there's nothing you can do about it. Want to see? Your greatest fear is that your boss is being double-crossed. And when he finds out, he's going to kill you for not protecting him. Pretty cool, huh? I can have my crew install some temporary windows sometime tonight. Great, thanks. You waiting for a call? Yeah. I'm just a little worried about Prue. I don't blame you after what happened. What makes you think it was a drive-by? I don't know, wild guess, I guess. I want you to move in with me. At least until the permanent windows are installed. If it's your sisters you're worried about, they can move in too. Since Jenny moved back with her folks, there's just plenty of room. I don't know if that's such a great idea. Some of us don't wear pyjamas. I'm serious. Because if things worked out, maybe you could stay. Permanently. If you wanted to. - Piper? - In here! I don't know what to say. Say you'll think about it. Is he a wi...? - Who's she? - Would you believe M. Steadwell? - How's Dan? - Just asked me to move in. - Where's Morris? - He's at the morgue, putting the hit woman's body under Marcie's name. - Where's Prue? - Way overdue. She's assuming the identity of the hit woman. - What? - Yeah, and guess what. She's got a new power. She can astral project now. - Are you kidding me? - No. - Are you kidding me? - No. - I hate her! - I know. All right, I'm gonna send Dan home. You keep Marcie in the house until this is all over. - Yeah, all right. Then we'll talk. - Yeah. Well, thanks for the... ...ride. You say you preferred orchids. - I'm impressed. - I'm glad. Now close your eyes. Trust me. Go ahead, open them. And open this when I leave, okay? But remember, three Halliwells by midnight. On second thought, make it by 10. It gives me more time to take care of it myself, in case you fail. Wait a minute, you can't come in here. Bet you. What do you want? Why, your greatest fear, of course, which... ...is being autopsied yourself. Doesn't look much like an explosion victim to me. I think your fears of a double-cross are justified. Oh, my stars! What is it? What's wrong? You can't keep wolfsbane and holy thistle on the same shelf. Their harmonics are in complete opposition. I mean, I don't wanna second-guess a sister witch, but this is all wrong. I don't see how you can cast a spell that's worth a darn. Now, wait just a minute, missy. Oh, my God. Prue's home, I think. That's Prue, all right. Gee, Prue, looks like being a hired killer agrees with you. I didn't wanna run the risk of anyone seeing me out of uniform. We've been worried sick about you. I'm sorry, I just didn't wanna jeopardise my cover. - Nice cover. - And nice Porsche. A gift from Bane? No, Bane prefers... Never mind. Look, I need to get back before they get suspicious. - Tell me what you know. - We know M. Steadwell is safe. - Can't say the same for the kitchen. - Any idea why she was on the list? Could be because she's a witch. I mean, not a magical witch, - but a witch practitioner nonetheless. - A hyperactive witch practitioner. I wonder if all the names were witches. How many were on the list? Eleven. Except that P. Halliwell was only down once. So if you count us individually... ...13. - Thirteen dead witches by midnight on Friday the 13th. Ring any bells? - Barbas. - Gotta be. It can't be. I mean, we eighty-sixed him already. He must have found some kind of loophole. I've gotta get back to Bane, try and flush Barbas out. Prue, you can't go back there. Piper, it's almost 8. I have gotta get to Barbas fast. Otherwise, Bane's gonna wanna see three bodies, our bodies. Have fun. - Phoebe, I'm working. - More like you're working it. Come on, Prue, I've taken a walk on the dark side. I know all the signs. Okay, so it's a little different. - And dangerous. - I can handle it. Prue, Barbas can paralyse you and use your greatest fear against you. You don't want to face that alone. How? I already conquered my fear of drowning. What else can he do? Well, maybe tap into some other fear. You can't defeat him alone, Prue. I know that. But for now, I'll be okay. I'll call you guys and check in in an hour. You look like you're ready to celebrate. - Are the Halliwells dead? - The night's young. We have a little bit of business to discuss. - What, all work and no play? - We'll play... ...right after I get my money. - You'll get paid when they're dead. You know, the boss has a nasty little habit of disappearing in the middle of the night. I'd hate for my money to disappear with him. Can I trust you? And Barbas? I'm disappointed you doubt either one of us. I wanna talk to him. Well, like you said, the night is young. - DJ, what's your problem? - I need to talk to you. Better be life and death. Excuse me. I'll just amuse myself. - Hi. - Hey. Make it fast. - I just came from the morgue. - Looking for a date? - No, checking on yours. She's a fraud. - What are you talking about? Marcie Steadwell isn't in the morgue, and I think the real Ms Hellfire is. - I don't believe it. - Barbas believes it. Marcie, please. Favour us, Sister Moon With your protective beams Please stop. Give all who dwell within this spell Safe days and sweet dreams Okay, that's all folks. Who knew perky could be so annoying? How long you think I can keep her like this? Your power, your call. Hey, did you reach Prue? No, she's still not answering her cell. She really should have checked in by now. - Maybe that's her. - Ringing the bell? Well, maybe she lost her keys. Right, Marcie? - Dan! - Hey, Piper. Dan, wait... I wanted to bring this over and leave it for my crew. They're having trouble finding enough plywood. - Hey, Phoebe. - Hey, Dan. Piper, don't forget about the... - Is this not a good time? - Never. I mean, always. Why don't you come in. Come on back. - Here let me help you. - No, Piper. - No, I got it, really. - Piper, I got it. Piper! For those who dwell Underneath this roof Okay, you know, Marcie, there's lots of rooms that need protecting upstairs. Wait a minute, where did Piper go? Oh, she just cast a little spell of her own. Lots of rooms upstairs, honey. Quietly, quietly. - So how are you doing? - Fine, it wasn't that heavy. No, I'm talking about everything. Oh, I'm fine with that too. I'm actually a little stressed. But everything is gonna be okay. So have you thought any more about my offer? You know, I don't want to push you. I know, it's just, every time I think I have things figured out, things tend to shift. Well, what things? Hey, you just let me know when you're ready. You know, it's not midnight yet. We still have time. Lots of time. You think you could fool me and get away with it? - You killed the woman I loved. - What are you saying? - You killed Hellfire! - I am Hellfire. Liar! So very nice to see you again, Miss Halliwell. Halliwell? From the list? Well, well, well. Can't say that I'm surprised. Your greatest fear is that someone will kill your sisters. - No. - Oh, yes. The demons are after them. Even as we speak, they have assumed your sisters' identities in order to kill them. You must kill the impostors first, by midnight. - Kill the impostors. - Yes. Then I get to deal with her. - Hey, Darryl. - Phoebe. Come on in. Thanks for coming so fast. We need you to babysit. - Is this one breathing? - Yes, this one is breathing. Good. Where are you headed? To find Prue. She's impersonating the hit woman. - What? - It's a long story, and you wouldn't like it, but she was supposed to check in by now. - I'm going with you. - No, no. No, you can't. I appreciate it, but you can't come with us. You don't have to hide anything from me anymore. I know that, Darryl, but believe me, you don't wanna be anywhere near us right now. We would never forgive ourselves if anything happened to you. - I won't wind up like Andy. - We won't let that happen. Which cleanses the aura of the house and makes it strong. Give me strength. Hi, Darryl. Piper. You're gonna have to come with me, Miss Steadwell. Okay. Thanks for everything, Marcie. Bye-bye. Oh, is this about the explosion at my shop? Yes. Until we close the case, you'd be safer with me. Oh, I think you have that backwards, inspector. You see, the protection spell I cast has been doing such a bang-up job for these girls. Just think what it could do for you. Okay, well, we thank you for that protection spell. Thank you so much, and now we have to go now. Okay. Come, inspector, my work here is done. Why don't we just leave this here. Are you sure that was the Porsche parked out front? - Positive. Prue's here somewhere. - Let's just hope she's alone. - Prue. - We've been so worried. Prue! - Are you all right? - No, I'm not! Come on. Crazy sister. Crazy sister. Easy, easy. - What is going on? - I think you need to freeze her fast. Good witches don't freeze, remember? She doesn't look so good right now. I won't let you kill my sisters. - She flipped out. - Patio, fast. Come on. - Oh, no. - What are you doing? Don't, don't. She doesn't know we're her sisters. Okay, we gotta make her choose. We have to convince astral Prue. Make her wanna be in two places at once. Ready? - Yeah. - Okay, go. Hi. Come on, Prue, come get me. Come on. No, it's me you want, over here. - No, Prudence, come on, me. - No, me. Phoebe! Phoebe, we need to hurry before she becomes one again. Phoebe! Prue, Barbas has brainwashed you. You're going to hurt my sisters. Prue, we're your sisters. Listen to me. You gave me the chickenpox. Yeah, and remember, I taught you how to French kiss. You broke your ankle when you were 7. Come on, Prue. We went to Duran Duran together. You stretched out my legwarmers. And then you gave them to me. How do you know all this? Because we're your sisters, Prue. Sisters? Get over here. Prue. - Are you with us? - I want Barbas. All we have to do is lay low until midnight, and then he'll disappear and go back to wherever the hell it is he came from. No, if he's back early, who knows what rules apply or don't. I don't want to take any chances. Let's go show him what his greatest fear is. If she's not back in one minute, then I'm going to spend my last two minutes killing you. Hey, I didn't come to you. You came to me, remember? That's right. And if you hadn't been blinded by your passion, then I would be minutes away from freedom right now. - Are they dead? - They're right where they belong. - Kill them! - No! Oh, I'm beginning to see your attraction to the dark side. It wasn't just his dark side I was attracted to. Do you think you can just unfreeze him? I don't know, I've never tried. Okay. Looking for this? - What's going on? - Witchcraft at its best. No. No! No. No! No! I never get tired of kicking his butt. Just a little something to think about, in jail. It won't be the only thing I think about, I promise. Is that a threat? No. It's a compliment. Dan did a really good job with these windows. He is obviously very good with his hands. Hey, hands off those hands. So did you decide whether or not you're gonna move in with him? I have to admit, it's very tempting. Yeah, well, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do. And you deserve to be happy. And don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Especially if I get your room. Yes, you could have my room. That is, if I was moving out. Oh, you're not gonna move out? Oh, that's so good because you need to be with your sisters just a little while longer. I adore Dan, but it's just way too soon for me to move in with him. There's a few things I need to figure out first. - Are you happy now? - I'm delirious. Thank you. Well, just tell Marcie that she can sell the ring and use the money to rebuild the bookstore. Tell her it's a thank-you for protecting us. No, Darryl, the ring is not hot. I'll talk to you later. So, what else did Hellfire get from Bane? Diamond necklaces, bracelets, a Hockney, a Salvador Dalí. You can't really keep all that stuff, can you? No. No. It wouldn't really be right. But maybe I can figure out a way to use it for some good and save my job. And if not, I can always astral project and job-hunt twice as fast. Sure, just rub it in. I would love to be in two places at once. As long as one of those places is fun, I'll be happy. I think I may have learned a few things from Ms Hellfire. You know, change my routine, shake things up a little bit. Jack. You know, Prue, it is bad enough that you don't answer your phone, come into the office or otherwise appear to be doing your job. But now you're gonna take me down with you. What have you got to say for yourself? Two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Excuse me? It's the market value of the anonymous estate donation I've been out acquiring. The one request is that all proceeds go to Stop the Violence Foundation. Not bad for a day's work, now, is it? No, it certainly isn't. You know, I never doubted you for a moment, partner.
