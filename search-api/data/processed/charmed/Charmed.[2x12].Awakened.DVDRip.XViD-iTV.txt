Phoebe Halliwell, college student? Okay, neat, thin slices, please. Wait, you enrolled? Phoebe, this is huge. Hugest thing I've done since I came back home. I mean, aside from vanquishing demons and saving the world from evil, of course. Okay, so I signed up for two general courses. And seven electives. Seven, Phoebe? All right, so I'm a little confused. I could use some advice. What do you think I should take? - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, it's just a little cough. I bet Prue made you have soup at lunch today - after she heard that little cough. - I had to cancel, actually. Last night's paperwork took a lot longer than I expected. So I guess you missed your massage today also? A reporter from the San Francisco Weekly called and had a ton of questions about the club. Piper, you have got to take care of yourself. You've been feeling funky since yesterday. - It's probably just a bug. - Even more reason for you - not to push it. - I'm fine. Besides, it's all paying off. The club is finally doing well, and we're making money. Now, would you slice? What kind of fruit is this, anyway? Kiwano. It's from South America. It's great for Mai Tais. Just got them in yesterday, actually. The bartender has a connection at the docks. - Wait, you smuggled it in? - Oh, it's fruit, Phoebe, not drugs. You know, just because we're witches does not mean that you're invincible. Okay, you need to start taking care of yourself. Thank you, doctor. Hey, Dr. Phoebe Halliwell. I like it. It's late. Let's just get this done. Well, it certainly appears to be a Monet. Has the same style that he enjoyed in Paris after the Exposition Universelle. The same delicate, powdery interpretations combined with great vigour and expressiveness. "Great vigour"? Randy little painter, was he? The brushstrokes around the smokestack are somewhat unusual for Monet. They seem almost individual, although beautifully rendered. Well, no complaints about my view either. Okay, you know what? Is everything with you sexual? No. Okay, you've never thought about me? Jack, come on. We don't have very much time - to authenticate this painting. - Not even just a little? Okay, fine. Maybe just a little. And I was good, wasn't I? Come on, Prue, I'm not pushing this. I just... I know where you stand. I just wanna know where I stand. With you. - How are you two doing? - Oh, we're fine. Exactly where we should be at the moment. As long as it's authenticated by the auction. I've got eight buyers on the block interested in that piece. You don't have to worry about us, Mr. Caldwell. Good. Do I have to worry about us? Piper, you need to go home. You're sick. I think we're over our occupancy limit. I don't want the fire marshal to shut us down. Piper, you need to go home. Phoebe, I'm fine! I'm just... - Maybe you're right. - Oh, my God! Call 911! Piper. Piper! Hey. Prue? You're awake. - What happened? - You don't remember? I remember being in the club and talking to Phoebe. And then, I gotta admit, it's a little fuzzy. You collapsed, someone called an ambulance. Oh, that must have been great for business. So, what's wrong with me? They don't really know. We're just sort of waiting for blood-test results. I'm sure it's nothing too exciting. It's probably something trendy like mono or Epstein-Barr. Yeah, well, whatever it is, you're gonna take the time to get better. Now you sound like Phoebe. Where is she, anyway? Hi. Nurse person? Hi. Can you tell me where Dr. Wallace is? He said that my sister's test results should be in by 8, and it's 20 past 8 now. - What's your sister's name? - Piper, Piper Halliwell. Thank you. Piper Halliwell. Piper Halliwell's been transferred to Dr. Williamson's care. If you have a seat in the waiting area, - I'll page him. - What happened to Dr. Wallace? I'm sure that Dr. Williamson will be able to answer all of your questions. Please, have a seat in the waiting room. Okay. - Are you sick too? - No, I'm not sick. Then why do you look so sad? My sister's here and they don't know what's wrong with her. The doctors don't know what's wrong with me either. Maybe your sister and I have the same thing. - What is your name? - Nathan. Well, hello, Nathan. I'm Phoebe. And who is that? Ninja doll. Found him in the children's ward. You know, I don't think that's just any ninja doll. If I know my ninja dolls, I think that one's really a magical wi... - zard. Wizard. - Really? How can you tell? - Well, let me see him. I've seen what his type can do. He's got powers. He can move things and freeze things. And he could kick-box too. And the really cool thing about him is he could do all this to the demon... To the bad guys inside your body without anyone even knowing about it. Really? He can freeze the bad guys and move them? And kick-box them too, don't forget that. Right out of your body. All you have to do is, when you feel bad, you close your eyes and just picture him fighting them for you. - Do you think you can do that? - Yeah. - Phoebe Halliwell? - Yes. - I'm Dr. Williamson. - Hi. - Bye, it was nice to meet you, Nathan. - See you. And who are they? Medical interns. They'll be viewing my work with your sister. Because...? Because they're studying the same field that I did. I'm an infectious-disease specialist. Specialist? Wait! Miss Halliwell? I'm Dr. Williamson. He's a specialist. - Where's Dr. Wallace? - I'll be keeping him posted. How are you feeling? Okay. A little hot, tired. Have you been out of the country recently? Africa, South America, Caribbean? I wish. No, I haven't even been out of the city. Why? Well, apparently you've contracted a blood disease rarely seen in the United States. Oroya fever. - How is that possible? - Well, Oroya fever is transmitted through the bite of a sand fly which dies right after the bite. Have you had anything imported, brought into your home recently? - No. - But you have in the club. What was the name of that weird fruit? - Kiwano. - That's a possible carrier. Sometimes the fly has been known to live in the crate long enough to make the trip, but rarely survives the quarantine period. I think... ...I have a bite on my shoulder. - When did you get this? - Yesterday. Just after I opened the fruit. Tell a nurse I need 10 cc's of Penilovin. - Right away. - It's an antibiotic most effective when administered through an IV. It should bring your fever down. I gotta run some more tests. I'll be back shortly. Excuse me. She's gonna be okay, right? I mean, it's not life-threatening? Well, I'll know better after I run more tests. Excuse me. I'll be okay. Yeah, I mean, he didn't seem too worried. Just prescribed antibiotics. The tests are just to confirm his diagnosis, I'm sure. Yeah. Don't you agree, Phoebe? I think we should call Leo. - Why? - Why not? He can heal you. No. He's out of our lives. He's not even our whitelighter anymore. Besides, with Dan in my life... - But if Leo knew you were sick? - No, and that's final. No demon or warlock did this to me. Just let the doctors do their magic. All right. Well, I just wanted you to get well soon. I know. And I will. Now, you two guys get out of here. Prue, go to Buckland's. Phoebe, go to wherever it is you go to. And somebody please call Dan so he doesn't worry. Okay. Bye. Love you. I'll call you as soon as I can. - Okay, go. Go. - I love you. Hey, have you had a chance to look at the thread-density results on the Monet? Yeah, and you were right. There are some unexplained thread markings in the area around the station, as well as the signature area. - Have you told Caldwell? - Not yet. I was hoping to talk you into going home first. Prue, you're exhausted. Yeah, I know. But I just prefer to stay here, you know, keep busy. I mean, how long can tests take, anyway? Hey. Piper is going to be fine. I know, it's just that... ...after everything that I've seen in my life, and believe me, I've seen a lot of weird stuff, it takes a lot to scare me. But this time, I'm really scared. Hey. You know, I'm really not good at this saying-the-right-thing stuff. You know what? Why don't you go back to the hospital, and I'll stay here and handle everything, okay? - Hello? - This is Nurse Stone calling for Prue Halliwell. Is she gonna be okay? You know, that's what's so frustrating. They won't tell us anything. Damn doctors. Can I see her? I mean, where is she? San Francisco Memorial. Hey. Nothing's gonna happen to her, okay? Piper's strong and healthy. And she's a fighter. You noticed too, have you? - Hello? - Yeah, Pheebs, the hospital just called. They need for us to get down there right away. Why, what happened? Seventy-six-year-old man suffering from blunt-force trauma to the head. We suspect a subdural haematoma. Call for an MRI. Prue? What's going on? I don't know. All they said is that her condition is worse. What is that supposed to mean? It means we're not gonna leave the door until we find out. Dr. Williamson? Unfortunately, your sister's immune system isn't as strong as we thought it would be. And the antibiotic's having no effect on the disease. So, what do we...? What do you do now? Well, there's nothing more we can do. Wait, what do you mean by that? What are you saying? Well, either Piper pulls out of the coma on her own, or I'm afraid your sister's not going to survive. - Okay, we can't let Piper die. - No, we can't. But, Prue, this isn't a demon or a warlock that we're up against. If there are spells in here to vanquish demons, there's gotta be a spell to vanquish a lousy bug. Okay. But even if there is a spell, how do we get past the personal-gain issue? - The consequences. - What consequences? The power of three remains unbroken, innocents are saved. I don't really see a downside to that. - Do you? - Prue, if good witches could really vanquish diseases, do you think there'd be one sick person in the world? - Look, we have to save Piper. - I agree. All I am saying is, before we resort to the Book of Shadows... ...maybe we should call Leo. - No. She told us not to. So? Let her be pissed at us. At least she'll be alive. We don't even know how to contact him. I mean, he's always just sort of been around. - Leo! Leo! - Leo! Leo! - Leo! Leo! - Leo! Leo! - It worked. - All right, Leo, look, Piper is very... Very sick, I know. That's why I could hear you. I've been nearby watching. Wait, you've been watching her this whole time, - and you haven't healed her? - I can't. They know about Piper too, and they won't let me interfere. I'm not even supposed to be here right now. Leo, you can't just let Piper die. Don't you think I would do something about it if I could? - But you love her. - I know. But I'm not her whitelighter anymore. Besides, even if I could help her, my powers probably wouldn't even work, because she wasn't hurt fighting evil. I have to go. They know I'm here. I'm sorry. Tell Piper I love her. Screw the consequences. You really think the awakening spell is gonna work? It better. All right, look, I'll get Piper's blood. Are you sure that you can get a poppet? - Positive. I'll meet you in her room. - All right. - How is she? - No change. She just looks like she's sleeping. But I can't wake her up. She'll wake up, I promise. Hey, Nathan. Remember me? Phoebe. I was hoping you'd come back. - Really, why? - You were right, the wizard did it. I feel great, just like I used to. - The power of positive thinking. - The power of magic. The doctors are letting me go home in a couple of days. Oh, that's great, Nathan, I'm so happy for you. You know, I was wondering if you would let me borrow the wizard for a while. My sister can use a little magic right about now. She can keep him. - I don't need him anymore. - Thank you. Hey. I was gonna bring us back some sodas, but the machine down the hall is busted. I didn't know where to find another one. - Oh, I'll find it. - Really? You don't mind? No, it's not any trouble. - I'll be back in a minute. - Thanks. - I got him. Let's do this. - All right. Trouble blood with sleep's unease Remove the cause of this disease Prue! - Hey! - Sleep eternal nevermore - And shift the source of illness borne - Hey! Open the door! To this poppet Whom none shall mourn What's going on in there? - Prue, it's not working. - Unlock this door! Come on, open the door! - Hi. - Open the door! Who was blocking the damn door? What's up, doc? When did this happen? Miss Halliwell, are you feeling all right? Look at me. Vitals are normal. Pupils are normal... - Halliwell pulled out of the coma. - She stabilized. - Piper. - Are those for me? - You're okay? - Yes, I am okay. This doesn't make any sense. Fever's gone, vitals are normal. I've never seen anything like it. - Point of infection's gone too. - So can I go home now? Draw some blood. I wanna run comparatives. Then can I go home? Because no offence, but I hate hospitals. Get off me. Cleanup in room 420, please. Cleanup in room 420. Turn it up! Up! All right, Malik, you can go home. I'll clean up. Dance with me, Dan. - It's almost 2 in the morning. - So what? Come on, you're young! No, stop the music. Stop that music. - Somebody need a nap? - You know what, that's not fair. You've been asleep for almost 24 hours. And I know you've been up for almost 24 hours by my side. I can't tell you how much that means to me. Being there for me. Hanging tough. I wasn't that tough. You're welcome. Now, go home. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, spill. What are you talking about? - You guys cast a spell, didn't you? - Who, us? Yeah, you. Not that I'm not grateful to be cured, because I am. But what about that little personal-gain problem? Don't you think we would've seen any consequences by now? - It's been hours. - Yeah, maybe saving a protector of the innocent isn't really personal gain. Maybe. Like I said, I'm not complaining. I'm just glad you didn't call Leo. Strange though, with all the demons we've faced, this bug, this thing, was the scariest one of all. Yeah, you don't have to convince us. - I love you guys. - We love you too. Hey, just don't ever scare us like that again. Don't worry. Oh, my God, I almost forgot. I have to get that Monet authenticated by tomorrow. - At this hour? - Why not? I'm wide awake. I guess I should clean up. - Piper. Piper! - What? I think I found a consequence. Get me Dr. Williamson. Yeah? Okay, put them both on Penilovin. Though I doubt it'll do any good. Call me if there's any changes. Right. And what can the Centers for Disease Control do for you this fine middle of the night, Dr. Williamson? I've really got something for you this time, Seigler. I wouldn't have called you if I didn't. It's not ethical to get the government to validate your findings - just so you can get published. - This will get me more than published. I've got an outbreak of Oroya fever at this hospital. That's impossible. Oroya fever isn't contagious. It is now. I've got three patients with the disease in isolation. - How'd they get it? - I don't know. But however they did has something to do with the first patient that came down with it, Piper Halliwell. Morning. Hey. - So how's Piper doing? - Fully recovered. What? That's great! Yeah. I just came in early to confirm a few suspicions. - Wait, back up, Piper's okay? - Yes. She's home, she's healthy, everything's back to normal. Jack, we've gotta talk seriously. Okay, shoot. We can't keep on fooling ourselves. This thing isn't real. I mean, I know that it looks perfect from the outside, and it makes sense to just ignore the truth and pretend that there's nothing wrong, but I can't do that. Look, Prue, come on, I know we've had our difficulties. And maybe our relationship isn't everything you hoped for, but... Jack. I'm talking about the painting. It's not real. I mean, yeah, it's from his school, but Monet didn't paint it, - one of his students did. - Are you sure? Positive. So what? "So what"? Prue, if someone wants to believe in something that may not be altogether true, but it's true enough for them, - then what's the harm in letting it be? - Jack... Prue, the world is made up of almost perfect. It's nothing but near misses and necessary compromises. Now, in this case, I think we got a little bit of both. But you know what, that's okay. I know how you feel. I'm just asking you to not look so close. Nothing bears up under that kind of scrutiny. Are you talking about the Monet? Yeah, that too. Just trust me, all right? Go with it. Everything's gonna be fine. - Piper Halliwell? - What's going on? I'm Dr. Seigler from the CDC. We have a court order to take you and your sister into custody. And to quarantine your club until further notice. How many people have been...? No, I would not classify this as an epidemic at this stage. Although that's for Dr. Seigler of the CDC here to determine, not me. All I can tell you is that an outbreak has occurred in the hospital and we've taken all the necessary and responsible steps to contain it. Dr. Williamson, how do you know it's contained? How can you be sure? Because we've identified the initial carrier. Who is it? What's his name? Is it a patient? We've identified the initial carrier and we've brought her and anyone she may have infected down into the isolation ward. Is it true that they've closed down a nightclub called P3 because of the outbreak? That is a question best answered by Dr. Seigler. If you'll excuse me. Yes, I can confirm that an establishment by the name of P3 has been quarantined. But only as a precautionary measure. Hello? Hello? Remember us? I'm sorry, we can't hear you. What is it you want? We wanna get the hell out of here, that's what we want. Dr. Williamson will be right in to discuss the situation with you. Discuss what? I feel fine! Dr. Williamson will be right in. This is ridiculous! Why won't they tell us anything? They're lucky they're in the other room, I'd freeze their butts. Oh, Prue, thank God. You're obviously not here to get us out. No, when I got home, someone from CDC was waiting for me. - And they took, like, a quart of blood. - Ditto. They might as well have taken all of mine. They shut down the club. They'll ruin it. I'll lose everything. No, you won't. Once this whole thing gets straightened out... I have a feeling it's not gonna be that easy. I overheard some doctors talking. There's others here infected with the disease. - But I thought it wasn't contagious. - Yeah, so did I. - So can they hear us? - No. Did either of you sleep, by any chance? Sleep? Piper was bouncing off the walls last night. It's gotta be a consequence of the awakening spell you guys cast. I have a bad feeling that's not the only consequence. Sorry to keep you waiting. - What, no mask? - No, I don't need it. None of us do. However the disease is being spread, it's not airborne. - I've just ruled that out. - Great. Then we're free to go. - Afraid not. - You can't keep us here. Actually, I can, by law. And not just because your sister circumvented it by opening the uninspected fruit, but because she's carrying a rare disease that has a possibility of spreading to epidemic proportions. I thought that you said it wasn't contagious. Oroya fever isn't supposed to be contagious. - Well, maybe you misdiagnosed it. - I didn't. Aside from the fact that I have no idea how this disease is being spread, there's another mystery concerning me. Your recovery makes no clinical sense. Your blood has no antibodies, which means the immune system never fought it off. By all medical standards, you should be dead right now. What's the matter, doctor, you don't believe in miracles? Not the kind that don't leave traces, no. I've got six people infected. There's nothing I can do to save them unless I figure out how you survived. I'm gonna run a series of tests on all three of you. Even DNA sampling. Maybe it's a genetic marker, I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. And you're not gonna leave until I do. Wow, his bedside manner sure could use some work. Six people? How is that possible? When we did the spell, we must have awakened everything in the room, including the disease. Is there anything different about our blood because we're witches? I don't know, but our first priority is to figure out how to save these people. Yeah, but even if we can find a spell to save them, how do we prevent it from spreading to other people? You have to reverse the spell. No, Piper, we can't reverse the spell, because... You would go back into a coma, you could die. I'm not gonna die. Just reverse the spell and call Leo so he can heal me. Leo? I thought you didn't want us to call Leo. Well, yeah, that's when I thought I was sick, not dying. Piper... ...we already talked to Leo. He's not allowed to help. They won't let him. Great. Well, thanks for doing something I specifically asked you not to do. - Piper, you just said... - Phoebe, just give it a rest. Look, Piper, we don't know the reversal spell anyway. Yeah, and they won't let us out of here to go get it. Prue can get it. No, I can't. Okay, I cannot just astrally project on command. I can't control it like that. You can learn to control it just like you learned to control your other power. - Just concentrate. - Piper, I can't and I won't. Prue, you have to try. We can't let anybody else die. Take her blood pressure, get her on FIO2. Let's go, let's go. - What's wrong with her? - Nothing, she's fine. Hurry, Prue. What was awakened from its sleep Must once again slumber deep Return the disease to whence it came So life can ease back to the same Did you see it? Yeah, Piper, I don't... Prue, we've already discussed this. For some reason, there's no magical out for me. But there is for the others. Please. What was awakened from its sleep Must once again slumber deep What was awakened from its sleep Must once again slumber deep What was awakened from its sleep Must once again slumber deep - Prue! Prue, get help! - Help! Piper! Piper! - Help me get her on the bed. - Let's go, pick her up. You girls wanna tell me what the hell is going on? Get her on the monitor. Miss Halliwell. Miss Halliwell. Miss Halliwell, can you hear me? Assist in respiration. Get me a crash cart. - Starting CPR. - Her heart rate's erratic. Get a code team in here stat, I'm losing her! Where's the crash cart? Piper Halliwell, what room is she in? No, what room is she in, damn it! I'm family! Nothing. Draw blood gases, I need an amp of epinephrine. - Where's that crash cart? - It's on its way. She's not responding to the CPR. Come on, Miss Halliwell. Stay with us. Fourteen gauge. Leo? Hurry, take my hands, we don't have much time. - Am I dead? - No, not yet. Not if you take my hand. - I don't understand. - It's the only way I can heal you. The only chance I have of them not finding out. Hurry. - She's in V-fib. Give me the paddles. - Charging. - Two hundred joules. - Two hundred. On one. Clear. One. No response. I'm not getting anything. - Again. - Charging! Clear! I don't wanna lose you. Call it. Time of death, 9:40 a.m. - Wait. - EKG's responding. There's a heartbeat. Piper? What the hell? This is incredible. Leo. You're all right. Are you okay? BP, 105/60, pulse is strong. - I don't understand. What happened? - I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. Hey, I just heard. Are you out of your mind? I don't know, maybe. Come on, Prue, you can't be serious. You can't just quit. I already did. I turned in my resignation and Caldwell accepted it. Why? Just because he doesn't agree with you about selling the Monet? It's not authentic, Jack. You know what? Buyers think it is. And they've been thinking that way for over a hundred years. So it's worth whatever someone's willing to pay for it, right? - Yeah, right. - No, it's wrong. At least, in my book it is. That's the way it used to be here before the takeover. Before everyone cared more about the sell than what they're selling. - Including me, right? - Jack. It's not just about the painting or Buckland's new philosophy. I've been thinking about this for a while. A lot has happened to me in the past year and a half. I've seen... I've seen things that I never imagined existed. And it's changed me. It's made me wanna make changes. So, what are you going to do? I don't know. Just take some time, figure it out. Look, I had a little wake-up call, and I realized that life is way too short to be wasting my time doing something I really don't wanna be doing. Or being with someone you really don't wanna be with. Jack, you have been great. You've opened me up to so many new things. Made me feel wanted again. But... But I need to be alone for a while. No strings. These haven't been inspected yet. Put them in the back, we're returning them to the supplier. Looks like someone learned their lesson. Yeah, the hard way, unfortunately. Well, still, the club's doing okay. Doesn't look like quarantine hurt business much. Yeah, thanks to no cover charge and free drinks. - Have you guys seen Dan around? - No, why? No reason, I guess. I thought he might stop by. You know, Piper, Dan heard you call Leo's name when you were coming around in the hospital. He did? That wasn't me thinking about Leo, that was just... Him saving you, I know. Still, how are you gonna explain that to Dan? Well, at least you're alive to try, that's what's important. Just because we're witches doesn't mean we're above the laws of nature. Or the Wiccan ones. I know, you don't have to tell me twice. I'm not taking anything for granted anymore. - Ditto. - Yeah, Prue, welcome to the ranks of the unemployed. I'm proud of you. I think what you did was very brave. Thank you. Piper. Leo. Tell him thanks for us too. - Hey. - Hey. - How you feeling? - Okay. A little tired, which is actually a good thing. Leo, thank you for everything you... - I couldn't let you die, Piper. - I'm very glad you couldn't. - Did you get in trouble? - Yeah, actually, a lot. They found out what I did. - They clipped my wings. - What? It's not permanent, it's more like a suspension. I hope. Leo, I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. You didn't do anything, I did. I guess in the back of my head I always hoped, thought, that someday... ...somehow, you and I would get a second chance. - I'm with Dan now, and... - I know. And I also know
