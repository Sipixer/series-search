How is it you can see your other selves reflected in the mirror ? It's part of the spell. You know, this just might work. What's your name anyway ? Billie. How long have you been a witch ? Not that long, just up to really recently. I noticed I had these... these powers. Who is he ? I don't know his name. He's some guy that I used to see in the elevator all the time at work. I'm Julie, Phoebe's cousin. Dex, Dex Lawson. - Hey the paper called for you. - Really ? What did they want ? I think they wanna talk to you, or cousin you. Apparently the newspaper is having a hard time getting the advice column out. So they asked me to help out a little bit. Which I thought that was kind a weird, but I said sure. Did you have something... I ran into here out of the elevator, I told her I thought, you might be able to help. Piper, you're gonna be late. I can orb you. No, no. We no orb, we drive like normal people. Yeah but normal people get stuck in traffic jams. Did you know put my several earrings back after you borrowed them ? Piper, you're stalling. I'm not stalling. Well, you look great. It's ok, if you're scared. I'ts understandable. I'm not scared. Oh yeah right, that's why you changed outfits three times. Alright, maybe I am a little nervous. I don't really know why I'm doing this anyway. Maybe you're doing this because it's what you wanna do. What if you get nothing else at being dead to the world. And to the underworld. At least you went out and tried to do something new. You know, you expended your own rises. Who writes your stuff ? The thing is you just need to relax a little, ok. Piper, it's just an interview. With the corporate head hunter who is gonna do what, - give me a job at I.B.M. ? I don't think so. - I thought you wanted this. No, actually it was Dad's idea. He said it'll help. Because he knew you wanted to try something new. No, I am perfectly happy running P3. You were not happy last week about anything. One little minute down, ok ? I'm aloud. Ok, look. The point is you've got a new recent life. We all do. And you need to just pick your own advice, you know? Get out there. See if there are other people you wanna mingle with and talk to. And what about all the demons in the world ? We've got Billie for that. And she's just a kid, what if she can't handle it ? She will. She's learning, and I've got her upstairs studying right now. Yeah and as far is the play date you know I've got it covered. I know. But really little canny is... is allergic to peanut butter, I know. You told me, you're stalling. I just wish I didn't feel like this cause it's a fraud. All you need to do is remember the you that's on the inside, ok ? And besides, who's gonna figure it out ? Jenny. Put your hands on your head. Now. Save it Maya, I know you understand me. You're under arrest for murder. Damn you !

Oh my God she... Are you ok ? Yeah, yeah, I'm ok. That was... that was awesome ! Awesome ?! You almost blew the house up. How was that awesome ? Oh just the addict besides this place is a ragged. You guys ever put anything away ? You were just supposed to be reading. - That what I was doing ! - Although what happened ? I don't know. Remember, I'm very very new at this. You read the spell aloud, didn't you ? Yes, I read it aloud. That's not reading, that is chanting. And that, is how things go boom. Ok, cool. Lesson learnt. What's next ? What's next ? It's that you go back to college and take a break from all this. Why ? It was just one little mistake. Haven' t you heard of the learning curve ? Look, I'm her because you need me, right ? So you girls can go, have a normal life, while I go kick some demon ass. So the more you teach me, the more I can get out there and go do my thing. The first thing you're gonna be doing, is cleaning up your mess. Why ? Can't you just cast a spell and make it pick itself up ? That would be something called personnal gain, which is something we don't do. Ok ? Plus, we wanna keep to use magic to a minimum so the demons don't find out we're still alive. Oh. Okay, yeah. I have three chicks move in under the same roof. Hello, how dumb can they be ? Sorry. Look. I get that spells and witchcraft and potions, they're really fun. It was not long ago that I was kind of going throuh the same thing, learning her ropes. But here's the deal. It's actually really dangerous and until you respect that, you're not gonna really truly learn anything. Ok, you might be right. I will. I will respect it, I promise. Thank you. So when can we go vanquish demons ? Hey. Don't look at me. You're her whitelighter. Yes I realize she's there to help us all Paige, but I'm working. And you will too as soon as she's got your stuff together. - Julie ? Dex Lawson's here to see you. - Oh I got to go, I got to go. My future husband's here, my future's husband's here, I got to go, I'll see you at lunch, I'll see you... - Bad time ? - No, this is a great time. Come on in. You wanna sit ? I can't, I got to get back to work. I just wanna stop to see how the new job is going. The new job ? Oh right, I'm sorry. I completely blanked. Uh... it's great. It's like I've been here for years. Well chose, sounds just like her. Who ? Phoebe. The column advice. Right, of course. Yeah, I mean it Julie. It's uncanny. It's... it's almost like you channel on her or something. Oh I've gotta to work on that cause that's kind a weird. So, you called about something ? Yes I did. How do feel about art shows ? Eh bien, Ã§a dÃ©pend de l'art. - How do you feel about my art ? - I love it. Good answer. Look, I know we've only gone out a couple of times, but I was just wondering if... I'd love to. Love to what ? I'd love to come to your art show tonight. If that's what you were asking. I was trying to. How did you know ? I'm psychic. What happened ? The Earth moved. Sometimes life just throws you a curve ball. And I'm Piper's cousin, so somebody had to stop and to take care of the kids. Of course, it's very noble of you. - Still. How do you expect to work full time if you... - Oh well, I have two other cousins who can pitch in and the boys, well, they have a man around, an other cousin, by marriage, my marriage. I'm married. It's all on the application. Isn't it ? Yes, yes it's all here, miss Bennett. Jenny. Jenny. I'm wasting your time. No, no. It's not that at all. Your resume is very impressive. Really. Anybody Victor recommends for that is alright about me. Just, Just what ? Frankly I get the impression you don't really wanna be here. Oh no, no that's not true. Really. Well, maybe it's a little bit true. But, honestly, I really don't know what I'm doing with my life at the moment. This change, this tragedy, has really forced me to open my eyes, and see just how far my life got off track. And after a while it just seems like one big battle after another. Oh yes, the metaphor of battles we face each day. Yeah. Except my more little more is litteral. But my point is I'm here because I wanna find myself again. I wanna dedicate part of my life to a new purpose. And really, I work very hard. And I'm very good with people. - You don't have to sell yourself on me Jenny. - I don't ? No, the credentials speak for themselves. Besides, you're honest, straightforward, very important traits every high level exert should have. high level exert ? That why I place you based on everything I'm seing here. Smile. It's for the background check, it's pro forma. Background check ? Give me a couple of days 'til I can come up with, and we'll meet again wednesday. - Is that alright ? - Are you kidding ? That's great. Thank you. Sure. We've got a problem. Actually, it wasn't a problem at all. It went a lot better than I thought it would. Well I won't say I told you so. Good, don't. How is the model crew ? They're doing fine, they're enjoying their sundaes as we speak. Actually I was talking about the mums, be careful of Eve. - She's kind of the evil. - Piper. What ? I can handle it. Enjoy your lunch, celebrate. Celebrate what ? Your new life ! Use your words sweetie. Uh ! I swear if Edith of one more time ??? she's gotta go. Get rid of her ciment shoe city. This is jocking, of course. Oh, I get it. Just, pretend I'm one of the girls. Mummy said use your words. Does this aggro stage ever stop ? Not if you're like my husband. Believe it or not, some men are sensitive. Look at you, what you're doing. Taking care of your cousin's kids. It's what family does. Yeah but most won't set aside their carrier for the sake of the children. God, I just... I really admire you. Ok, enough. I'm sorry sweetie, but mummy told you if you can't use it safely she's taking it away. Come on. And all on your own. No ring. You're not married ? Oh, uh... actually it's a long story. Mummy, mummy ! Oh God ! I'm so sorry. - Oops ! - It's ok, it was just, it was an accident. Here, let me clean that off. Oh God ! Suspect is considered armed and dangerous. So approach with extreme precautions Maya Holmes. We don't wanna hurt civilians. Copy then. I don't know, I'm not just used to it I guess. What ? Feeling happy ? No, I mean the guy's probably just blewing smoke anyways. He probably not gonna call with any real opportunities. Oh that's the old Piper we all know and love. Jenny. Nobody's listenning. And nobody cares ! That should be the effect. You know what ? I hear that Dex cares. Yeah until the earth quake destroys everything he's ever worked for. What earth quake ? I mean, talking about ruining a moment. What moment ? You know the moment. When you look into each others' eyes and you gotta feel the romance and the passion the desire. When such a very long moment since I've had a moment. I mean, how am I supposed to marry a guy that I don't even know without having the moment ? But really back to this earth quake. Maybe your premonition was so you could stop it from happenning. How am I supposed to stop an earth quake ? Five point five, six, seven, what are we talking about here ? How am I supposed to know ? Maya Holmes, this is the police. Stand up, put your hands on your head. I think they're talking to you. There's somewhere you need to be ? Oh yeah, you know, I just need to stop an earth quake. Phoebe. What ? It was your idea, Paige. Yeah, that was before Piper got arrested for murder. Oh my God ! Five minutes. Making count. Oh honey, orange is so not your color. - Paige! - What ? It's true. Don't worry, because we fight demons, we fight warlocks. This a just a minor blip. I don't think so. They think I'm somebody else. Well, you are somebody else. No ! But I'm not a fugitive. That's not the alias that I picked, at least, not intentionnally. Now, have you called Darryl ? We did, and we left him a message, but he's on the east coast now, so I don't think he's gonna be able to help us. Why did you choose this disguise anyway ? I don't know, I just did. Well you had to have got it somewhere, you couldn't just plucked it out of the cosmos. Well, no, I guess not. Ok you have to try to remember. You must have seen her face somewhere. Maybe TV or internet or the newspaper, something. Think. Maybe it was a magazine. A magazine, ok, good. Any idea of which magazine ? How am I supposed to know ? - Once in your hands, you always have them around the house. - And you're going where with this ? Well, I'm just thinking if we can find the picture that inspired her, then we can use that to scry for the real Maya. And that helps me how exactly ? Because we'll orb you out and orb her back in. - Get the real killer behind bars. - Phoebe you can't orb me out of jail ! Yeah, I think we can if we do it simultaneously nobody'll ever know. And you've got your own cell so there's no exposure risk. - Yes, but... - No buts ! This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go to the newspaper and search the archives for Maya. You go home and look for magazines. Got it. Just, you know. I saw a documentary on prison once. You gonna be just fine. All you have to do is keep you eyes low and your shoulders high. We're gonna have you out of this unflatting color in no time. Show no fear. Uh... I thought I was gonna be alone. Now you've got company. Play nice. Lock it all Jones ! What are you smiling at ? Me? I didn't smile. I wasn't looking at nothing, and smiling at nothing. I'm not doing nothing. Ok. Eyes low, shoulders high. Leo! You know, you really don't have to do that. I insist. It's the least I can do since how my Tommy did the mess. Are you sure that undershirt isn't dirty too ? Why don't we wash it ? You know I can just throw it in the wash machine. - Non sense. - Here, let me. Hey there ! Excuse me. Am I... interrupting anything ? Jo ! Eve. Jo. Jenny's cousin. So, Louis, may I speak to you for a second ? What the hell are you doing ? What do you mean what am I doing ? I gave the kids some sundaes and Eve's little son Tommy's spilt on me. Yeah, whatever. Why don't you just explain that to your wife after we get her out of jail ? Jail ? If you we'ren't so busy flirting, maybe you would know about that already. Look I wasn't flirting, ok ? It was Eve. You know what ? Nevermind. What is going on ? What happened is that Piper chose the wrong disguise which unfortunately she found out after she was arrested for murder. - Murder ? - Yes. And apparently she thinks she got her alias out of a picture of one of these magazines. Wait a second. I don't have time for this. Neither does Piper. So if you really really wanna help, maybe go get rid of your lady friend. You know what? She's not my lady friend, ok ? She is a friend but she is just a lady. Whatever. Just please help me find Maya Holmes, the real Maya Holmes. Who ? Just go. Something's going on ! Is that a demon problem ? Is it ? Is it ? Is it ? Not now Billie. Are you making a potion as in a vanquishing potion ? Oh come on Paige, teach me. I'm here to learn, amn't I ? It's a big problem, ok ? It's a big problem. I've been studying the book. - I know how vanquishing demons, I know... - It's not a demon problem ! What kind of problem is there ? It's Piper in jail the problem. In jail ? They're confusing her with somebody and that's somebody else is who I have to scry for. - Oh scrying I love that. - No, no, no. What if it doesn't work ? It has to work. That's why we're doing this the old fashionned way. No laptop scrying. Old fashionned. Keep it simple. Oh, please work ! Let's just hang on a second cause we could work something out here, you know. We're both grown adults and I wasn't smiling and you weren't smiling at me. Holmes ! You've got a visit. Holmes ? That's me ! I got to go ! Ok ! See you later ! Hello Maya. Good to see you. It's good to see you too. Are you my lawyer ? No, I don't think so. I think I'll be prosecuting this one. Personnally. I see. So what do you want ? I just want to see you again, that's all. In private. Did you really think you'd get away with it ? Running from the law ? Running from me ? I guess I did. What did I ever do to you Maya ? What did I ever do to deserve this ? Why don't you tell me. I offered you the world. I gave you everything I could. And then you just... You just threw it back in my face, didn't you ? What did you expect? I just let you get away with it ? It was time for me to move on. No, it wasn't time. It wasn't time at all. Not until I said so. I warned you not to mess with me, didn't I ? I told you what would happen if you left me for that that photografer. What did you ever saw in him ? What could he possibly given you that I couldn't ? Just youth ? Well it didn't hurt. Yeah it did. It hurt a lot. It costed his life, didn't it ? And now I'm gonna see to what costs you yours. It was you ? It wasn't her at all. What kind of game are you playing now ? What do you like to know ? You don't have anything on me. You wouldn't have caught, if you did. Are you sure about that ? I'll see you in court. You won't get that far Maya. - Anything on Maya yet ? - You did just ask me like two minutes ago. - Well I've got dead lines too, you know. - Well you would do in fugitive's advice now too ? Sorry. Just give me another minute. Ok. Hey Greg ! I've been looking all over for you. - How is the baby ? - Fine. How do you know about her ? Well, what ? Of course I know about the... I mean... You know, do I have to explain this everytime ? Nevermind. - Let's talk earth quakes. - Earth quakes ? Yeah, earth quakes. I think it's really important that we run a story, maybe even in tonight's edition, about earth quakes preparedness. What do you think ? Why ? Why, well, I think it's really important that people are prepared for earth quakes. You know, I mean one can strike at any time, one could even hit tonight, you know. I think I have got something. Ok. Evening edition, right ? Safety first, right ? - Ok, let it on me. - Ok, so. Basically Maya Holmes was a local model used to date Walter Nance, the ADA. Ok. Ok well, she left him for some photografer who was found shot to death in his appartment two weeks later. It was a lovers' core. Crime of passion, this kind of things. Right, she did it. I get it. What I wanna know is how can I find her ? But she's already been found. I mean they arrested her this morning. Yeah, but I mean, wouldn't it be just crazy if she had a twin ? Well that's the story. Keep looking, ok ? I wanna know relatives, agents, friends, whatever you can find. Remind you somebody ? Ok. You gotta be careful. Oh come on. How dangerous can a model be ? Lamp ! Oh, that was close. Good! Fear ! You're making progress ! Guess what ? Lunch time for the guards means me and you get to finish what we started. Ok, right. Now, you'll see you had to be a tough guy. There is more with that came from ! No, wait, don't, don't hit me again. I, I won't hurt you, I promise. It worked ! What happened ? What did you do? We switched you out with the real Maya Holmes. Oh, well, that's great. But she is innocent. I tried Judge Watkins, and Judge Kingley, and none of them called me. Then call Chief Aliss. Remind him he owes me. I want Maya released now. With all due respect sir, don't you think you might be overreacting ? I mean, after all, how do you know she's not bluffing ? Are you willing to bet your carrier on it ? Because I'm sure you're not. I know Maya. She should have been scared but she wasn't. She's got something on me. And I got to stop here before it gets out. - Stop her how ? - How do think ?! I still say you should let the system do its job. I am the system ! Where's Harvey ? I'll look my best, for Maya. Botox ? No. Thanks. How were we supposed to know. They said you're alone. Well, obviously, I wasn't. You're sure she didn't see you orb ? No, fortunately I think she was seing stars at the moment. Can we get back to why you think Maya is innocent and what we're gonna do about it ? I don't think Maya's inncocent, I know she is. Nance basically admitted to killing the photografer. Nance, the District Attorney ? - Yeah. - Great. Well can't we just vanquish him ? We don't usually vanquish humans. Just asking. Billie, maybe you should go upstairs and study for a little bit. What ? Why ? I've been studying all day! I... Billie, just... Please. Fine. Just like living at home again ! Pratice patience ! So if Nance's guilty, we need proof. She must have something on him. Either, why didn't she use it ? Why run ? She's probably scared. He's a high powered district attorney. He's well connected, and she wouldn't stand a change against him. Which is why you need to switch us back. What ? No way to put you back in jail. Just long enough for you to find out what she's got on him. What about your cell mate ? I think I can take care of myself. Ok, well, I think that should give me enough time to stop Dex's show. Excuse me ? Look, I didn't ask for this, and if I don't do something, then the premonition about us getting married... not gonna happen. And the future child premonition, that's not gonna happen either. Yeah, ok, go. Fantastic, good idea. Ok. Eyes low, shoulders high ! I'm gonna go check on Billie. That's a good idea. Well, I get it. Hi Karl ! You're the dude banging on my wife ? What's going on ? Uh... I don't know. Uh... Yeah, I didn't do anything. It was Eve. What exactly did Eve do ? Oh come on Piper. You know me ! I do, and I also know Eve. So you must have done something to encourage her. No, nothing. I, except, maybe, you know, she thought that I was single. Oh! You didn't tell her you were married. No, look. It all happened so fast ! We've never really got the chance to discuss. You know. Everything without the disguises. I mean, we don't even have our rings on our fingers, so... That's a good story. Now, get back into position. What ? Why ? Well, we've gotta save Maya, we've got stuff to do. So let's get this over with you guy going get back into position. You are so enjoying this, aren't you ? Yeah. Wow. Now, don't you feel better ? Ok, thanks for stopping bye Karl. Say hi to Eve for me, okay ? See you later. You wanna do what ? Cancel my show ? Well, maybe not cancel, maybe just postpone. Why ? Why ? Did you not read the article on earth quake preparedness in the newspaper today ? I mean, we're do for a major shaker at any moment. Actually, over do. A major shaker, uh ? Yes, a major shaker and imagine what it will do to your art work. It will be desasters. - I think I can risk it for the night. - No. You can't. - Wait, you're serious, aren't you ? - Yeah, I'm really serious. Julie, I can't cancel my show. I got every major accredit in town incoming. Let's make a break from me. Ok, then, if we cannot move the show, we're gonna move your art work. - To that is safe, you know ? - Hey, easy with that. You put that right there, good. And now I'm thinking if we had some like rope, you know, and some crazy glue... What are you doing ? Are you nuts ? No. I just want anything to ruin your moment for tonight. That's all. Oh my God ! Did you feel that ? Yeah. Well hurry up ! We've got work to do ! You move this one here. Maybe we shouldn't have let Billie do this. Oh it's better her going in to see if it's safe for us to orb especially since you still look like Maya. Besides, if Billie's gonna start helping, she might as well do it now. Yeah but she's supposed to be helping us with demons, not cops. Oh, here she comes. Hey, bad news. Maya is not in there. What do you mean she's not in there ? They just released her to a Nance's custody. Nance ? Why ? So he can shut her up. You seemed so much sure of yourself today in jail, Maya. Not so sure of yourself now, are you ? What are you talking about ? I told you I didn't see you in jail today. I don't even know how I got in jail. That's not what you've said before. You said you wanted to get caught! You said, I believe the exact words were : "see you in court." You should know better than to threaten me. Now, what exactly is it you have on me, Maya ? Walter, please, calm down. - See, don't you hit bring her here? - So he can kill her, everyone knows he billed her out. Yeah, I know Nance, he's probably already thought about that. What do you mean know Nance ? You met him once ? Once was enough, believe me. I'm telling you the truth I don't know what's going on. I swear, I don't have anything. I don't believe you. I can't risk it. I beg you, don't kill me too. It is n't murder, Maya. It's suicide. - Oh my God ! - Orb orb ! Oh that was close. Hurry, get the mattress. What is it doesn't work ? Well then it was a bad idea ! Mattress ! - Where I am ? - You're dead, come on. Here. It'll soon make you feel better. I just... I still don't understand. - I've never heard of... - witches ? Ok, come on, sure you have. It's like the Wizard of Oz. Except we're not wicked. You've seen the Wizard of Oz, right ? Yeah, of course, but I never thought witches were real. Real enough to save you. You actually seem more like guardian angels to me. I don't know about that. I mean I'm actually pretty new at this myself. I only met the sisters, I mean, the cousins, a couple of weeks ago. They do this sort of things all the time. Or at least, they used to. I... I don't know what to say. There is nothing else to say, all that matters now is that you're safe. Sorry, I kicked you in the face. I'm sorry we almost got you killed. He's not gonna stop coming after me, you know ? He'll figure out I'm alive, sooner or later. I know, I know. They're working on that. Isn't there any sort of proof you have... If I did, don't think I would have use it by now ? I mean, Walter is crazy, obssessed. He thinks I betrayed him, but I didn't. The only crime I committed was leaving him for a younger man. What do you mean ? Walter can't stand the fact he's getting older. He's like paranoid about it. He does everything he can to pretend it's not happenning, like lift, Botox, implants... Even has a manucure coming over every night to keep his nails neat and trim. Like that was any good. Now what if if we swap Maya's identity for a new one ? Are you kidding ? I think we're having enough identity issues as it is. Well, we're running out of options people. No, there's gonna be another way. What if she went back on the run ? No, that's just a matter of time before she get caught. I mean, she's the prime suspect. You can't magically make that go away. Excuse me guys but I have this great idea. It's too bad we can't prove that he threw her from his balconney. Now it's gonna look like she escaped from him. At least that's the way he's gonna spin it. So you see though, I have a great ... I think the only way to save Maya, is to get him to confess to the murder somehow. Oh, that happens when, before ar after hell freezes over ? - But I'm telling you! - Wait a minute. What about a true spell ? - We've gonna have to get close. - We can try orbying. Or you could try listenning to me ! Thank you. According to the book of shadows, this would not be the first time you scare somebody into confession, right ? Six or seven years ago, it was upon Broka or something ? Waouh! Someone's done her homework ! I'm impressed. Yeah, but we didn't do it. We got a ghost to do it. Yeah, I know, but you guys can change looks, right ? You can make him think he's seeing a ghost. Where are you going with this ? I'm going, to the demon of fear. You want us to conjure Barbas ? Are you out of your mind, after everything he did to... kill you? No, I'm not suggesting you conjure him. I'm just suggesting you think of him as some sort of inspiration. Pray on Nance's deepest fears. You do very nice work. Much better than the other girl. Thank you sir. What did you say happened to her ? She's just sick, I'm filling in for the day. Perhaps on a more permanent basis. I'm sorry, I attend to work with a much younger clientÃ¨le. Ouch. Watch it. Things can tend to be more susceptible to damage on the hands of someone old as you. You are sixty or something ? Get out of here. I am so sorry, sir. I didn't mean to offend you. - Are you sensitive about your age ? - No, I'm not. You know, I can usually tell how old somebody is just by looking the lines on their hands. Go ahead, see for yourself. What are you talking about ? What ! Is something wrong ? What the hell... You're dead ! - You could not have... - lived ? Sorry to disappoint you. What's the matter old man ? Seeing a ghost ? Because you killed me, just like you killed Curtis ? No, it's not possible ! - It's a, it's a... - a nightmare ? One you won't ever wake up from. Guilt's a terrible thing Walter. It haunts you forever. No, get away from me ! Leave me alone ! Drop dead ! What's happenning to me? Well, Walter, the way I see it, you have two choices. You can confess, or you can meet the pavement. What do you say ? Well, Nance and everyone involved, are in jail. Maya set free. Not on a bad day. Yeah, except for the part where I have to come up with a new identity. - So much for my future in a corporate world. - It's ok. I don't think that would fit you very well much anyway. I guess not. I can't change my whole life. Although, you could have mentionned that earlier. No. Plus my lesson is no one tells you what to do. So, missy, where do you gonna take your next alias from. Time magazine, Vanity Fair... Let me guess, National Inquirer ? No, I think I can come up with this one on my own, thank you. Well just make sure it's not one of the most wanted at least, ok ? Trust me. Another cousin ? Yes, actually, one that you'll be married to this time. Hey, that was all about Eve. Oh buddy, some old movie. - One that I don't wanna see again anytime soon ! - Fine to me ! So, guys, how do you think our fair Billie did ? It sounds like she did good.
