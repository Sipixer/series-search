that would maybe help. Yes, and I will do that. First, I need to make sure Wyatt's okay at preschool. Preschool? Don't you mean Magic School? No, I mean preschool. We enrolled him last week, remember? You didn't tell me that. Did you? Yes. And you said you were worried about him using magic in public. Oh. And what'd you say? I said I was worried about him having a normal life. All right, cool. I'm all up to speed now. With these charges and these demons attacking, I'm a little scattered. That's different how, exactly? I don't know why the Elders couldn't see fit to give me a local witch instead of a New Zealand witch. I don't know, but I need the phone. No! No, no using the phone. Why are all the handsets up here? I am trying to prevent a demon attack. - What? - All the attacks have been different. And all the demons have had different powers. One thing I notice is that every time a phone rings, a demon attacks. No, they don't. Phoebe called earlier, and nothing happened. Really? Stop the jingling already. I'll be there as soon as I can. Charges. Piper! You might be right about that phone thing. That was Wyatt's preschool. I wonder what they wanted. I am more interested in these demons and what they wanted and trying to figure out how to vanquish them. It doesn't sound right. Why would demons attack when the phone rings? They're all different demons, remember? The last one even looked kind of human. Better add some mandrake root in case they're shape-shifters. The last attack happened when the preschool called too? Yeah, I think you're right. Do you think Wyatt is creating these demons? That's ridiculous. He created the dragons. One! One lousy dragon, and you're gonna hold it against him for his entire life! Oh, no. Let me guess. Another demon attack? - Or Wyatt's acting up. - Or Paige is overreacting. Wyatt has been isolating himself at preschool and only talking to himself. Who said he's only talking to himself? I heard the message. - That's odd. - No, it's not odd. Just because he's talking to himself does not mean he's creating demons. - Except he's kinda quiet around home. - So? Wyatt's in his second stage of development. His sense of language should be maturing. He should be talking to other people, not just himself. I'm very sorry you went back to college. But it's really helping with my column. That has nothing to do with why Wyatt is creating demons? He's not creating demons! Let's see, maybe it's a reaction to preschool, some kind of Freudian transference or something? Mumbo jumbo! Look, all I'm saying is if he's talking to himself, the problems may be normal, not magical. Normal problems like what? I have no idea. It could be anything. I could ask my professor. She's the expert. - But I... - Be back soon. Hey, what are you doing? Put the phone down! I have to call the preschool. Well, then use your cell phone. Miss Henderson! I came as soon as I could. Leo, what are you doing here? You called about Wyatt, right? Yeah, but I said it was nothing to worry about. I thought I'd made that clear. Well, I was in the area. Is he all right? He's just talking to himself. I wouldn't have bothered calling if your wife hadn't asked me to. She's very protective. He's a special kid. They're all special, Leo. Right, but he has special needs. Special needs? You never said Wyatt was a special-needs child. Not like that. He's... gifted. First child? Is it that obvious? Do you want to see him? Please. Oh, there he is. Oh, how long has he been doing that, talking to himself? I don't know, on and off since he first started coming here, I guess. And... is that normal? Normal, no. But I don't think you should be alarmed. He's just playing by himself. Lots of kids do that. I really like our conversations, Wyatt. But you know I'm a secret, right? Nobody else can see me. You're just not used to letting him go. Happens to lots of first-time parents. It's more complicated. I see this every day. Trust me, it's not. He wasn't feeling very well this morning. Maybe I should take him home, just... just to be safe. Well, okay, if you think that's best. We won't be able to talk much longer, but don't worry, I'll be back. I promise. Okay, buddy, come on, you ready? Let's go home, okay? See you soon, Wyatt. I want to hear more about that special teddy bear. We'll see you later. Vicus? - I was getting worried. - You failed me. We didn't fail. We've been distracting the witches for you, dying relentlessly! But you haven't sustained the distractions. The father took the boy, just as I was starting to make progress. What? Forget him, we don't need his powers. Dealing with the Charmed Ones is too dangerous. Do you think you know how to do this better than I do, Hugo? That's not what I'm saying. You've been working at this for what, three weeks? We're risking everything. For what? For us! To add his power to yours, to the collective. Now, didn't I risk everything, nurturing the evil within you, Hugo, just as I did with all the others? Yes, of course you did. Then you must trust me. Wyatt will become one of the most powerful witches to ever walk the earth. It's better he walk with us than against us. I just worry. Don't. I realise that I only have a small window at this age in which to change him, but I am close. Very close. Professor Slotkin? I don't have time to discuss your paper topic right now. No, no, it's not about the paper. It's actually personal. Oh? Yeah, it's about my nephew. He's two... ...and a half, and he's just going through some stuff. I was hoping you could help me understand it. Terrible twos? Well, I think it started out as that, and now it's just... Well, at preschool, he talks to himself, and then at home, he doesn't talk to anybody. Well, perhaps he has an imaginary friend, although... ...he's a little early for that, developmentally. Oh, he's very advanced for his age. And if it was an imaginary friend, is that necessarily a bad thing? Freud used to think it was a sign of immature thinking. Nowadays, we know that kids create imaginary friends for lots of reasons: Companionship, conflict resolution, sometimes as a coping mechanism... Let me write this down. Oh, and that's Slotkin, with an S. - You were planning on giving me credit? - I'm sorry, what? Well, last week we discussed Lorenz's theory of imprinting in class, and this week I read about him in your column. I imagine we're discussing next week's content, no? No. No, this is actually about my nephew. Please, we both know why you're taking my class. I'm taking your class to be a better columnist and to understand human behaviour. I've spent years studying and teaching psychology, Miss Halliwell, dedicated my life to it. I'll be damned if I'm just gonna let you poach my class to steal a sound bite for your column. You want to learn about imaginary friends? Do the research. I look forward to reading your paper on it. We don't know if it's a problem or not. Well, that's what has me worried. You know, maybe putting him in a normal school wasn't such a good idea. But we agreed it was a good idea, and when we did that, we knew there was gonna be some road bumps like this. The problem is, we don't know if the road bumps are magical or just a normal part of development. I wish we could just ask him. I think we're a few years away from him giving you an answer. Well, especially if he just keeps talking to himself. - Whoa! - Exactly. Okay, I like the Maori people, but... I'm pretty okay if I don't see them again. I think I found out something about who's been attacking us. Leo, take Wyatt upstairs so he doesn't hear that demon talk. Buddy, let's go upstairs, take your Wuvey with you. As I was saying... I've been searching through the library at Magic School. I found something out about the demons. And? Their offensive powers are traditionally associated with good magic. I thought these guys were supposed to be demons. Yeah, I thought so too. But it supports the theory that Wyatt's creating them. Oh, for crying out loud! I'm just saying... This is ridiculous! We can't live like this, it's crazy! Where you going? I'm going to figure out if Wyatt is behind this once and for all. Big guy. You okay, buddy? Hey, Wyatt. I promised I'd be back, didn't I? Yeah! Wyatt? Remember... ...l'm a secret, right? I like your teddy bear. Maybe you'll let me hold him some day, huh? I've got a great surprise for both of you. Shoot. What rhymes with "communicate"? - Are you sure this is a good idea? - Of course I'm sure. What about the whole personal gain thing? Wyatt created a demon who kidnapped him and a dragon that nearly destroyed the city. I'm not real worried about personal gain. Because I'm a Whitelighter now, I have to think of these things. We're casting it on ourselves so we can try to understand what he's not telling us. So if I switch... ...this and I leave that... Okay. Help this mother understand the thoughts inside her little man Though his mouth be quiet let us hear his inner Wyatt Mom? It's me, Wyatt. Wow! Mom, look at you. You look great! Right. Okay. Looks like you're as surprised to see me as I am to be back. Yeah. - Back from where? - The future. Oh, no. No, no, no. We wanted to communicate with you. I mean, the younger you, the two-and-a-half-year-old you. You guys taught me magic may work in mysterious ways, but it always works. Where did you hear that? That's nice. In the future, you're always telling me that. Well, that's the future me. I'm me now, who doesn't have those kind of brilliant thoughts. Right. Look, all I'm saying is, if your spell brought me here, there's gotta be a good reason. I don't know. Do you remember anything about when you were two and a half? No, not really. So then we're still looking for that reason. But still, this is a fantastic opportunity the magic's brought us! I mean, for me to see the past, for you guys to learn about the future... Oh, no, no, no. We don't want to know. We don't want to risk changing it again. Again? - Don't ask. - Okay. But until we find out why magic brought me back, we could at least try and enjoy the moment. How did you become such an optimist? From you, Mom. You must have turned over a new leaf in the future. Don't count on it. So that doesn't help us with our Wyatt. No. Piper, you home? Okay, the professor gave me some information that I think will be useful... Who is he? Aunt Phoebe, it's me! Wyatt! Why what? Oh... This is so amazing. What, did a spell backfire? - How'd you guess? - Yeah. Yeah, well, you know... What did your professor say? She said he probably was talking to an imaginary friend, I mean, not... not you, you know, the other you when you were... This is gonna be so confusing. - You'll get used to it. - Okay, imaginary friends, - ring any bells? - I'm afraid not. She also said that he's a little young for an imaginary friend. - I mean, again, not you, just... - I got it. Right. - Sorry. - What language is that? Maori. Your New Zealand charge, right? Yes. He can wait because I think this a little bit more important. You said there's nothing more important. Look, I'm pulling double duty here, so no guilt from the future for me. Can we focus on helping him, please? Someone told me that Whitelighters are the glue that keeps the magic world working. Paige told you that? Don't be so surprised. Do I ever have a life in the future? You should go. We'll figure this out. Okay. So you guys cast a spell to communicate with me? So let's go talk to me. Dad! Hey, look at you! You haven't changed! Maybe a little less grey and a few pounds lighter. - What? - Future son. Hey, is this Chris? My gosh, he's so small! Is this before or after he swallowed the marble? - What marble? - Easy on the future information. - You're right. - But really, what marble? What's going on? They brought me here to figure out what's wrong with me. Is that still my room? Explain. If you let me see Mr Bear, I will give him right back, I promise. Hey, don't I know you? You look familiar. Wait. You can see me? Of course I can. Wyatt, who are you talking to? What's going on? - That man, you didn't see him? - See who? He was just there talking to... me. Me? What do you mean, you or him? Both. The boy was just starting to trust me. He was about to give me the bear. Where did this other witch come from? - What other witch? - The one who saw me. No. How is that possible? It doesn't matter. They know you now. I told you this was going to be too dangerous. I made it so that only Wyatt could see me. They found a way through your powers. No. No, this witch who saw me seemed surprised. Still, he thought he knew me. And his name was Wyatt too. We may have an opportunity here. I don't follow. Don't you see? If I made it so that only Wyatt can see me, then that means this must be Wyatt too. They conjured him from the future, an older Wyatt, a good Wyatt. But doesn't that make it worse? If this future Wyatt is good, then that means you never infect the boy. Gather the collective. We need to attack now. Distract the sisters with everything you've got. What do you plan to do? I'm gonna get the boy to give me that bear. With it, I'll finally turn him, and then, I'll watch the future change before my very eyes. I know a demon when I see one. That was a demon. But you didn't see him. Some creepy invisible guy standing over my son, I'd say that's a demon. He just didn't seem like a demon. He wasn't threatening at all. Maybe it was an imaginary friend. No, imaginary friends are imaginary. You said he's too young to have an imaginary friend. He's two. Actually I'm 25. I... I know what you mean. You don't have any idea how much we've already been through to make sure you turn out okay. I know what you went through. It's all gonna work out. The fact that I'm standing here now, happy and healthy, should tell you that. Okay, fine, then you won't mind IDing the demon so we can keep you happy and healthy. - Don't make me ground you. - All right. So... ...just out of curiosity, do you have any cousins, in the future? No, don't answer that. Nice try. Wait a sec. I think you're right. He is a demon. "Vicus is a demon who preys on children, turning them down the path of evil." Okay. Okay, buddy, Daddy's gotta go check on Mommy, okay? I'll be right back. All right, you stay here, okay? I'll never leave you, Wyatt. I'll always be here, I promise. Now, show me that you believe me. Let me see your teddy bear, just for a second. Then I'll give you both a big surprise. Enough! Leave my family alone. Everything all right up there? Oh, yeah, we're fine. Wyatt, what's going on? - Piper! - Good. Don't touch it! Dad, what happened? Wyatt, what happened to you? Who are you? Who is who? Who is he talking to? The demon. Follow me. I just feel so free. I can't believe I spent a whole other lifetime weighed down by the repressive morality, by all that good. Well, I'd like to give that feeling to more good witches... with your help. Why do you hole yourselves up in this dank lair? It's so depressing. Perhaps. But it's safer. Down here, good doesn't dare attack us. The future of evil is above ground, trust me. We shouldn't be hiding when we have the power to take their world. There'll be plenty of time for conquering later. For now, there's still the matter of your family. - They'll want to change you back. - I know. Soon they'll find a way to scry for our location. Then we must attack them before they do. No. We want them to find us. I know them all too well. It's too risky to fight them at the manor. Here, we'll have the advantage. You would kill your own family? Watch me. Are you telling me that our child is evil... again? However he changed future Wyatt, it started with the bear, okay? He cursed it somehow. He made it glow. Okay, then we need to get that bear away from him. Can I have this? Thank you. Okay. Phoebe, don't make him angry. We need to act fast. We need to find a way to reverse the curse, before future Wyatt does something evil. I think we should take him to Magic School. He'll be safer there. Take the Book. There may be something in there that can help. - What are you gonna do? - Get Paige, see if we can find Vicus. Maybe if we vanquish him, all of this will go away. And if neither one of those works? Then we're screwed. Paige? Luckily we have enough demon ash that we should be able to scry for Vicus' lair. I wish I was a little bit more confident in this potion. What do you mean? It's fine for the demon, but what about Wyatt? We're not gonna fight Wyatt. - We might not have a choice. - I don't think he'd try to kill us. - How can you be sure? - I can't. But if Piper can't change Wyatt back, then we're gonna have to vanquish the demon and hope that does it. And we have the added problem of not even being able to see the demon. Only Wyatt can see Vicus. We're gonna have to bring a lot of vials. And just throw them everywhere? Yeah. You have a better idea? Normally yes, but sadly this time, no. Oh! I got him. Okay, better start filling those vials. Oh, thank you. Sweetie, why don't you let Mommy see the bear? Come on, why do you want that silly bear anyway? - Lookit, come on. - I don't think you'll convince him. I just don't get it. I mean, he seems as sweet as ever. Of course he does. So can you tell me how this boy turns into the future of all evil? It's not us as parents. You can say that as much as you want, but it's gotta be. No, I found a reference on cursed objects changing children in incremental degrees over time. He's two. How much could he really have changed? Not much, but if he keeps in this direction, next 25 years, he can be pretty far off path. He will become the young man we saw. This is ridiculous. I mean, if it's all because of that stupid bear, then there's gotta be a magical way around it, a way to change it, a way to change him. Right. Of course. Right, of course... but what? It's... just that curses are difficult. Oftentimes it's how it came about that's more important than the magic itself. Okay, well, we'll figure out the why later, but right now we need to fix this. How much longer are we going to wait? Patience. Scrying takes time. There's a vanquishing potion to keep my aunts busy for at least an hour. Vanquishing potion? You expect that they'll show up empty-handed? It's not gonna be that easy. - I don't like this. - Stop worrying. The rest of the collective is just a shimmer away. Besides, my aunts won't be able to see you when you're cloaked. Wait. They're coming. Have any trouble finding the place? Where's Vicus? Around. But you should be worried about me. We want to help you. What makes you think I want your help? Because we know you, and we know you're good. A lot of potions you got. I thought you thought I was good. These are for Vicus. As soon as we get rid of him, this will be over. Good luck finding him. You girls are way off. - We have lots more potions. - Maybe I can help you out. - What are you doing? - Making a point. Go ahead, vanquish him. What? So you thought you'd change me back, did you? - Why didn't that work? - Because I'm not under any spell. You can't change me back by simply vanquishing Vicus. He still got to me. And this is how evil grows over the years. I don't plan on giving you a chance to change me back. I'm gonna make sure you don't. But first, this should keep you busy for a while. These are the ones that killed Vicus. Have fun. Oh, and no orbing on Paige. Try it. Evil taints what was once held dear Remove this curse away from here I guess we'll just try another one. It's not gonna work, just like the last 15 spells didn't work. - Nothing's gonna change that damn bear. - We can't give up. What if it's not just the bear? What if the problem is Wyatt? - You can't think like that, Piper. - Why not? I mean, we try and make the right decisions and try and keep him away from bad influences, but ultimately, he's his own person. We can't control him forever. And we shouldn't try. All you can do is try to be a good influence on him. Then a demon comes in right under our noses and changes him. We knew something was wrong with Wyatt earlier. We sensed it. We tried to do something about it. That's the best you can hope for as a parent. Or we can try another spell. Maybe that's the problem. We're just trying another spell. - So? - So why didn't the demon do that? He didn't just appear today. What kept him from taking the bear and cursing it if it was that simple? I don't know. You know, maybe because... ...he needed something else from Wyatt, and not just the bear, but his trust. Mom, Dad. How'd he get in here? I'm still a Halliwell. I always hated this place. - What do you want? - What do you think I want? Young me. Make sure you don't screw me up again, try to turn me good. You don't really have a choice in that matter. What are you gonna do, Mom? Kill me in order to protect me? It's a thought. You always said spanking was barbaric. Ouch, that hurt. I seriously never had you pegged as the type of parents who'd hit your kids. - You stay away from him. - Should I stay away from this too? You can't touch it. Why not? It's my magical inheritance, isn't it? You're evil now. Let go of him. Don't wait up for me. We were lucky to get out of there alive. Sorry. We weren't lucky. Wyatt wanted us distracted for long enough to grab Wyatt. What is he gonna do with him? He wants to take him to the future so we can't change them both back to good. That's why he wanted the Book. He's gonna figure out a way to get that Book. Found him, let's go. He's gonna be expecting that. So? I can't just sit here and let my son corrupt himself. That was too easy. It's gotta be a trap. Whatever we do, we have to be smart about it 'cause Wyatt is very powerful. We're only gonna get one shot at this. We know what his next move is gonna be. He's gonna go after the Book. We should set a trap for him. He's not gonna attack you here. He doesn't want to have to fight you. But you said if we go to him, he'll be expecting it. He will, which is why I agree with Phoebe. We should set a trap. I'll be the one waiting for him, not you. You don't have any powers to fight him with. Which is why he won't sense me as a threat. Any of you guys are here, he's not gonna show up. Say you get him here. What exactly are you gonna do? The demon needed Wyatt to trust him, hand over the bear willingly. - I just need him to give it back. - Leo... I may not have any powers, but I'm not powerless. - He's not gonna hurt me. - No? Ever read Hamlet? - Hamlet killed his stepfather. - Close enough. - Freud says according... - Woman, can it! It's the only way it can happen, Piper. You know it. All right, well, any sign of trouble, you call 'cause we're just an orb away. Be careful. I will be. You see that Book over there? I want you to bring it to me. Understand? Come on, Dad. You don't have any powers. That's right, I don't. So, what are you gonna do? Take away my car keys? I don't need to do anything. You're gonna stop yourself. That's what I always loved about you, Dad. You're such a boundless optimist. I know you. I'm your father. And I know you still have good in your heart. Now your optimism just sounds pathetic. You know how I know that? Because this child right here still has good in his soul. Isn't that right, Wyatt? Get the Book, Wyatt! Now! You can come over here to me if you want. Dad, seriously. I don't want to have to hurt you. But if you get in my way... I don't believe that. You mind if I come over there for a second, Wyatt? Stay away from him! Is this your Wuvey? Could I see him please? Get away from him now, or I'll kill you. I don't think you will. I told you to stop. I was there when you were born, Wyatt. I gave up my powers for you. I tried to change the world for you. And I would do it again in a heartbeat. You know why? - I'm your father. - Stop it! You want to kill me? Go ahead. I gave up my life for you before. Dad... please. I love you. Do you understand what that means? Wyatt, can I see Wuvey just for one second? I promise I'll give him back to you. You can trust me. Thank you. Here you go. Dad? What did you? What happened? Miss Halliwell, do you have a moment? Yeah. I had a chance to look over your paper on childhood imaginary friends. Yeah, and let me guess. You found it to be a shallow pop psych. Examination on the subject? Hardly. An A-minus? Wow, really? Well, your use of Kohlberg's moral stages was a bit of a stretch. But overall... quite insightful. Thanks. I especially liked your supposition that the impact of an imaginary friend can actually last well into adulthood. I found that fascinating. So do I. I have to go. I have to go home and see my nephew off. Off? I thought you said he was two? No, this is a different nephew. Actually, he's older, and he lives really far away. But I'm late. Before you go. I... I just wanted to apologise. I prejudged you as a fraud, and you are clearly anything but. I look forward to reading your next paper. And... to your next column. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Please tell me Paige is more punctual in the future. I thought you didn't want any knowledge of the future. - A little wouldn't hurt. - Piper. What? It's not gonna change anything, aside from my being constantly irritated. That's "sorry" in Maori. Do I ever get the hang of this in the future? What's so funny? Nothing. It's just... who do you think teaches me to be a Whitelighter? Me? Well, I guess I'd better get going. Not that it matters with time travel at all, but just to be safe. Aunt Paige... ...thanks for everything you're about to do for me. You're welcome, I think. Dad... ...thanks for not giving up on me. You can count on it. Aunt Phoebe... ...you should hold on to that imaginary friends paper. - Why? - For my little cousin. - Bye. - Bye. Don't worry about me so much, okay, Mom? Sorry. That's the one thing that won't change. - I'll see you. - See you. A son in the future, a son in the past Seeing anew what once has passed Return him now to whence he came Right when he left All now the same
