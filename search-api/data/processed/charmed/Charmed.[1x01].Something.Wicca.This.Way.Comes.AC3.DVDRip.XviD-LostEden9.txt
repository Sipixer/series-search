Master of moon and sun I shield you in my Wiccan way Here in my circle round Asking you protect this space And offer your sun- force down What are you doing here? - Prue? - In here, working on the chandelier. - Sorry I'm late. - What else is new? Piper, I would have been here to meet the electrician myself, but I can't leave the museum until 6. I haven't even had time to change. I just, I didn't realise how long I was in Chinatown. Did Jeremy call? No, but he had some roses and a package delivered. What were you doing in Chinatown? I thought you had an interview? I did, but I went to Young Lee Market after my interview to get the ingredients for my audition recipe tomorrow. So that Wolfgang Puck knockoff didn't hire you today? No, but this just may get me the job. Jeremy sent you port? It's the ultimate ingredient for my recipe. Nice boyfriend. Oh, my God. I don't believe it. Tell me that's not our old spirit board. I found it in the basement when I was looking for the circuit tester. "To my three beautiful girls. May this give you the light to find the shadows. The power of three will set you free. Love, Mom." We never did figure out what this inscription meant. Send it to Phoebe. That girl is so in the dark, maybe a little bit of light will help. You're always so hard on her. Piper, the girl has no vision. No sense of the future. I really think Phoebe's coming around. As long as she doesn't come around here, I guess it's good news. Okay. Okay, okay. We have three units on it now. - Well, it's about time. - I got here as soon as I heard. Another dead female, right? Mid- To late 20s? I've been paging you for over an hour, Trudeau. Where have you been? Oakland, checking out a lead. What lead? - One that didn't go anywhere. - You're avoiding my question. Because you don't want to know I went to an occult shop. You hate me, don't you? You wanna see me suffer. I want to solve these murders. - Someone's after witches. - Women. That woman up there, I'll bet she was killed with an athame. Wrong. Double-edged steel knife. Right. That's an athame. It's a ceremonial tool. Witches use them to direct energy. That woman didn't direct jack. She was stabbed. Plain and simple. Was she found near an altar? Yes. Were there carvings on that altar? Just do me a favour. Don't ever follow a lead without checking with me first. You want to go to occult shops? Just get to work, okay? Inspector Trudeau. Jeremy Burns, San Francisco Chronicle.</i> - You care to comment? - A woman was stabbed. Plain and simple. That's the third one in three weeks. I don't get it. I have checked everything. There's no reason why the chandelier should not be working. We've been talking about what to do with that spare room. I think you're right. We do need a roommate. Well, we could rent out the room at a reduced rate in exchange for help around the house. Phoebe's good with a wrench. Phoebe lives in New York. Not anymore. What? She left New York. She's moving back in with us. You've got to be kidding. Well, I could hardly say no. It's her house too. It was willed to all of us. Yeah, months ago and we haven't seen or spoken to her since! - Well, you haven't spoken to her. - No, I haven't. Maybe you've forgotten why I'm so mad. No, of course not, but she had nowhere else to go. She lost her job. She's in debt. And this is news? How long have you known about this? A couple of days. Maybe a week. Or two. Thanks for sharing. When does she arrive? Surprise! I found the hide-a-key. Phoebe, welcome home. - Hello, Piper. - It's so good to see you. - Isn't it, Prue? - I'm speechless. - Oops. I forgot about the cab. - I'll get it. Piper, that's my purse! Thanks. I'll pay it back. Is that all that you brought? That's all that I own. That and a bike. Look, I know that you don't want me here. We're not selling Gram's house. Is that why you think I came back? The only reason Piper and I gave up our apartment and moved back was because this house has been in our family for generations. No history lesson needed, I grew up here too. So can we talk about what's really bothering you? No, I'm still furious with you. So you'd rather have a tense reunion filled with boring chitchat and unimportant small talk? No, but otherwise we won't have anything to talk about. - I never touched Roger. - Whoa. I know you think otherwise because that's what that Armani-wearing, chardonnay-slugging trust-funder told you, but... Hey! I have a great idea! Why don't I make a fabulous reunion dinner? I'm not hungry. I ate on the bus. Okay, we'll try the group hug later. I'm at an apartment building on the corner of 8th and Franklin</i> where a murder occurred earlier this evening.</i> The victim, believed to be a nurse at County General,</i> was reportedly stabbed to death in her apartment.</i> - It's me. - Come on in. - Oh, thank God. I am starving! - I figured. Hey, that's my boyfriend, Jeremy! - What happened? - Oh, some woman got whacked. "Whacked"? Phoebe, you've been in New York way too long. Yeah. I should have stayed. Why didn't you tell Prue I was coming back? And risk her changing the locks? Besides, you should have been the one to tell her, not me. Good point, Chicken Little. It's just so hard for me to talk to her. She's always been more like a mother. That's not her fault. She practically had to sacrifice - her own childhood to raise us. - Her own childhood to raise us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, we're lucky she was so responsible. You and I had it easy. All we had to do was be there. Yeah, well, I don't need a mom anymore, you know, I need a sister. Hey. This was always the coldest room in the house. Thanks. The same tattoo was on the other two victims. So the murderer is killing cultists. No, the murderer is on a witch-hunt. Oh, yeah, and he's 500 years old and he lives in Salem. Look around, Trudeau. Pentagrams, altars, offerings. All tools for a freak fest. They call them sabbats, and this was hardly a freak fest. She was a solitary practitioner. She practised her craft alone. Let me ask you something. Do you believe in UFOs? - Hell, no. - Neither do I. But do you believe there are people out there who do believe in UFOs? Yes, but I think they're crazy. Then why can't you believe there are people who believe they are witches? Look, all I know is that if you don't stop talking about witches, I'm gonna start questioning you. I'd stay away from that cat, Trudeau. It's been clawing the crap out of everybody. See you at the car. I'm glad to hear you and Jeremy are still together. Where did you meet him anyway? We met at the hospital cafeteria the day Grams was admitted. He was covering a story and I was bawling over a bagel. So he handed me a napkin. - How romantic. - As a matter of fact, it was. The napkin had his phone number on it. - Stop pushing the pointer. - I'm not touching it. You used to always push the pointer. More popcorn? Hey, I forgot your question. I asked if Prue would have sex with someone other than herself this year. That's disgusting! Please say yes. Piper. - Piper, get in here! - What? - What did you guys do now? - Me? I didn't do anything. The pointer on the spirit board. It moved on its own. I'm serious. It spelled A-T. - Well, did you push it? - No! You always used to push the pointer. My fingers were barely touching it. Look. It did it again! It moved! - It's still on the letter T. - I swear, it moved. There! Look! - You saw that, right? - I think so, yeah. I told you I wasn't touching it. Prue, can you come in here a sec? - Now what? - I think it's trying to tell us something. Attic. Don't you think you're overreacting? We are perfectly safe here. Don't say that. In horror movies, the person who says that is the next to die. It's pouring rain. There's a psycho's on the loose. Jeremy's not even home. So, I'll... I'll wait in the cab till he gets home from work. - That'll be cheap. - Prue, I saw that pointer move. No, look, what you saw was Phoebe's fingers pushing the pointer. There's nothing in that attic. She's playing a joke on us. We don't know that. We've lived here for months now and we've never been able to get that attic door open. - Great, now the phone doesn't work. - Yeah, the power's out. - Just go with me to the basement. - What? I need you to hold the flashlight. Phoebe will go with you to the basement. - No, I'm going to the attic. - No, you're not. We already agreed. I am not waiting for some handyman to check out the attic and I'm certainly not waiting until tomorrow. I'm going now. Prue, wait! "Book of Shadows. Hear now the words of the witches The secrets we hid in the night The oldest of gods are invoked here The great work of magic is sought In this night and in this hour, I call upon the ancient power Bring your powers to we sisters three We want the power Give us the power" What are you doing? Reading an incantation. It was in this Book of Shadows. - I found it in that trunk. - Let me see that. - How did you get in here? - The door opened. Wait a minute. An incantation? What kind of incantation? It said something about there being three essentials of magic: Timing, feeling and the phases of the moon. If we were ever gonna do this, now, midnight on a full moon, is the most powerful time. "This"? Do what, "this"? Receive our powers. What powers? Wait, our powers? You included me in this? No, she included all of us. "Bring your powers to we sisters three" - It's a book of witchcraft. - Let me see that. Spirit boards. Books of witchcraft. It figures all this freaky stuff started when you arrived. I wasn't the one that found the spirit board. It wasn't my fingers sliding around on the pointer. It doesn't matter, because nothing happened, right, Phoebe? When you did the incantation? Well, my head spun around and I vomited split pea soup. How should I know? Well, everything looks the same. - You're right. - Yep, the house still needs work. And everything feels the same, so nothing's changed, right? You're up early. I never went to sleep. Don't tell me you put on a black conical hat and spent the night flying around the neighbourhood on a broomstick? The only broom I've ever had was kept in a closet beside a mop. So what were you doing? Reading. Is Prue around? She went to work early. Reading aloud? No. But according to the Book of Shadows,</i> one of our ancestors was a witch named Melinda Warren. And we have a cousin who's a drunk, and aunt who's manic, and a father who's invisible. I'm serious. She practised powers. Three powers. She could move objects with her mind, see the future, and stop time. Before Melinda was burned at the stake, she vowed that each generation of Warren witches would become stronger and stronger, culminating in the arrival of three sisters. These sisters would be the most powerful witches the world has known. They're good witches and I think we're those sisters. Look, I know what happened last night was weird and unexplainable, but we are not witches, and we do not have special powers. Besides, Grams wasn't a witch and as far as we know, neither was Mom. So take that, Nancy Drew. We're the protectors of the innocent. We're known as the Charmed Ones! There's been a change of plans. A change of plans? Regarding the Beals exhibition? The extra money that you helped raise through private donations has sparked significant corporate interest. The Beals artefacts will now become part of our permanent collection. Well, that's terrific. Which is why the board wants someone a little more qualified to handle the collection from now on. You look surprised. I don't know why, I'm furious. Not only have I been on this project since its inception, but I'm the curator who secured the entire exhibition. You're the person more qualified, aren't you? I could hardly say no to the entire board of directors, could I? But I know you'll be happy for me. After all, what's good for me is definitely good for you. - Right, Miss Halliwell? - "Miss Halliwell"? Since when did we stop being on a first-name basis? When we stopped sleeping together? Or when I returned your engagement ring, Roger? I didn't realise the two were mutually exclusive. Although I certainly enjoyed one more than the other. Bastard. Prue, wait. I feel like I should say something, if only to avoid a lawsuit. Your time is up. Let's see. Roast pork with gratin, Florence fennel and penne with a port giblet sauce. - Chef Moore? - What? The port. Yes. Without it, the sauce is nothing more than a salty marinara. A recipe from a woman's magazine. I didn't have time for... But... Chef Moore? Chef Moore? Hello? Hello? That is very good. C'est magnifique. It was my idea to spark corporate interest from private donations. Besides, not only have I been with this project since its inception, but we both know who really secured the entire exhibit. - Prue. - I quit. I'm going to have to call you back. Think about this, Prue. Lousy job, lousy pay, lousy boss. What's to think about? Your future. Because, believe me, if you walk out with no notice, - you can kiss any references... - Don't threaten me, Roger. You know me. Had to try. You're hurt. You're angry. Your pride is wounded. I understand all that. That's why you can't see that I'm doing you a favour. - Excuse me? - I had to take the exhibit away. If I hadn't, the board would've come in and put a total stranger in my place. Think about it, Prue. I'm here for you, not some stranger. You should be thanking me, not leaving me. Well, I'm not worried. I'm certain your intellect will make quick work of the 75 computer discs and the thousands of pages of research I've left in my office. - You're gonna regret this. - I don't think so. I thought breaking up with you was the best thing I had ever done, but this definitely tops that. Goodbye, Roger. I hope there are no office supplies in your purse! What the hell was that? Phoebe, answer the phone. Answer the phone. Oh, God, Jeremy, you scared me. I can see. I'm sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. Now I am. I really am. What are you doing here? I wanted to be the first one to congratulate you on your new job. You're always surprising me. How did you know? You prepared your specialty. And anyone who's ever sampled your work can see how talented you are. I get so turned on when you talk about food. Hot dogs. Hamburgers. Pizza. No, wait! Hi, I'm looking for my sister, Phoebe Halliwell. One second, please. What's the name again? Inspector Andrew Trudeau, Homicide. Dr Gordon's expecting me. Andy? Prue? I don't believe it. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? I'm fine. I just can't believe I'm running into you. Yeah. I'm picking up Phoebe. She had some sort of an accident. - Is she gonna be okay? - Oh, yeah. She'll be fine. What are you doing here? Murder investigation. Your sister's still in X-ray, so it'll be another 15 minutes. Dr Gordon's office is to the left and down the hall. He's with a patient right now, but you're free to wait. - Thank you. - Thank you. Well... It's good seeing you, Prue. Yeah, you, too, Andy. Take care. You know, Phoebe's busy and Dr Gordon's busy. Can I buy you a bad cup of coffee while we wait? Sure. So you're an inspector now? What can I say? In any other city, I'd be called a "detective." "Inspector" is classier. I'm liking it better already. Your dad must be so proud. Third generation, you bet he's happy. How about you? You taking the world by storm? Well, I'm living back at Gram's house and as of an hour ago, I'm looking for work. - I heard you moved to Portland. - I'm back. You still seeing Roger? - How did you know about him? - I know people. You checked up on me? I wouldn't call it that. What would you call it? Inquiring minds want to know. - You checked up on me. - What can I say? I'm a detective. Miss Halliwell, please meet your sister at the nurse's station.</i> The Chosen Ones? Charmed Ones? Phoebe, this is insane. Are you telling me that nothing strange happened to you today? You didn't freeze time or move anything? Roger took an exhibit away from me. All right, look, Phoebe, I know that you think that you can see the future, - which is pretty ironic... - Since you don't think I have one? That my vision of life is cloudy compared to your perfect hell? Even if you don't want to believe me, just once, can't you trust me? Phoebe, I do not have special powers. Now, where is the cream? Really? That looks pretty special to me. Oh, my God. So I can move things with my mind? With how much you hold inside, you should be a lethal weapon by now. - I don't believe it. - This means Piper can freeze time. - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. - You've turned me into a witch. - You were born one, we all were. And I think we better start learning to deal with that. When I was looking through the Book of Shadows</i> I saw these carvings. They looked like something out of a Bosch painting. All these terrifying images of three women battling different incarnations of evil. Evil fighting evil, that's a twist. Actually, a witch can be either good or evil. A good witch follows a Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." A bad witch, or a warlock, has but one goal, to kill good witches and obtain their powers. Unfortunately, they look like regular people. They could be anyone, anywhere. And this has what to do with us? Well, in the first woodcarving they were in a slumber, but in the second one, they were battling some kind of warlock. I think as long as we were in the dark about our powers, we were safe. Not anymore. Has anything weird or unexplainable ever happened to you? Sure. It's called luck or fate. Some call it miracles. Why? What happened? Forget it. Even if I could tell you, you'd swear I was crazy. Open your fortune cookie. Okay. "Soon you will be on top." It doesn't say that. - Yes, it does. - Let me see. Is that a bad thing? "Of the world. Soon you will be on top of the world." - Can you make a left on 7th? - You got it. Seventh? I thought we were going to your place. We are, but you reminded me of something. I want to show you the old Bowing Building. The view of the Bay Bridge? It's amazing. - I'll be right back with your prescription. - Take your time. Excuse me, where do you keep the aspirin? - Aisle three. - Thank you. Chamomile tea works great for headaches. Not for this one, it won't. You know, I'm not afraid of our powers. I mean, everyone inherits something from their family, right? Yeah, money, antiques, a strong disposition. That's what normal people inherit. Who wants to be normal when we can be special? I want to be normal. I want my life to be... You know, isn't this aisle three? Well, we can't change what happened. We can't undo our destiny. - Do you see any aspirin? - I see chamomile tea. Look, I have just found out that I'm a witch, that my sisters are witches, and that we have powers that will apparently unleash all forms of evil. Evil that is going to come looking for us. So, excuse me, Phoebe, but I am not exactly in a homeopathic mood right now. Then move your headache out of your mind. You move things when you're upset. This is ridiculous. I thought that you landed on your arm, not your head. - You don't believe me? - Of course I don't believe you! Roger. Now, let's talk about Dad and see what happens. - He's dead, Phoebe. - No, he's moved from New York, but he's very much alive. He isn't to me. He died the day he left Mom. What are you talking about? He's always been a button-pusher for you! You're mad he's alive, you're mad I tried to find him, and you're mad I came back. Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad. - Feel better? - Lots. The Book of Shadows said that our powers would grow.</i> Grow to what? Well, here we are. I don't care how amazing the view is, I'm not going in. Come on, I have a surprise inside. You are gonna love this. I bet you tell Phoebe and Prue the moment you see them. I never mentioned Phoebe came home. - Oops. - What is that? It's your surprise. Jeremy, stop it. You're scaring me. - Damn it, I'm serious! - So am I! See, I've waited six months for this. Ever since Grams went into the hospital. See, I've known for quite some time that the moment the old witch croaked that all your powers, they'd be released. Powers that would reveal themselves as soon as the three of you got together again. All that was needed was for Phoebe to return. It's you, isn't it? You killed all those women. Not women, witches. Why? It was the only way to get their powers. And now I want yours. Okay, think, stay calm. Think, think, think. Gotta get out of here. Okay, okay. Prue, it's Roger. I've decided to let you come back to work.</i> Seriously, let's talk. Well, Piper's definitely not home, unless she's turned into a cat. - How'd the cat get in? - I don't know. Someone left a window open. - Did Piper leave a message? - She's probably out with Jeremy. - Roger called. - Yeah, I heard. - Prue! - In here. - Piper? - My God. What is it? What's wrong? Lock the doors! Check the windows! We don't have time! Phoebe, in the Book, did it say how to get rid of a...</i> - Warlock? - Oh, my God. I'll get you, you bitch. - I'm calling the cops. - And tell them that we're witches? That some freak with powers beyond comprehension is trying to kill us? Even if the cops did come, they'd be no match for Jeremy and we'd be next. I've found the answer. It's our only hope. Come on! Okay, we've placed the nine candles anointed with the oils and spices in a circle. Wait, I only count eight. - You forgot this one. - A birthday candle? I guess Grams was a little low on witch supplies. All right, next, we need the poppet. - Got it. - I think we're set. We're ready to cast the spell. Okay, first, I'll make it stronger. Your love will wither and depart From my life and my heart</i> Let me be, Jeremy And go away forever</i> - Okay, the spell is complete. - Let's hope it works. Wait, it didn't work. - What? - The spell. It didn't work. - How do you know? - When I touched the pot, I had a flash. - I saw Jeremy. - You touched the pot and saw him? He's on his way here. Hello, ladies. Piper, Phoebe... ...get out of here. Now! Cool parlour trick, bitch. Yeah, you were always the tough one, weren't you, Prue? Phoebe, you're right. Our powers, they're growing. Put as many things against the door as you can! You can't keep me out, Prue. My powers are stronger than yours. - Okay. - Yeah, look out. You don't think a chair will stop me. You don't think a dresser can stop me. Have you witches figured it out? Nothing, nothing can keep me away. What do we do? We're trapped! Come on, we'll face him together! Remember the spirit board? The inscription on the back! The power of three will set us free Come on, we've got to stay together. The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us free The power of three will set us free I'm not the only one! I'm one of millions. In places you can't even imagine, in forms you would never believe. We are hell on this earth! You'll never be safe and you'll never be free! The power of three. Good morning. Hey. This is a surprise. I've been feeling really guilty about that bad cup of coffee. I just wanna make it up to you. So you brought me a good cup of coffee? Oh, this? No, this is mine. I just wanted to ask you out to dinner. Unless, of course, you're afraid. Afraid of what? Oh, you know. Having too good a time, stirring up old memories, rekindling the old flame. Good point. Better not. Okay. Friday night, 8:00? You hesitated. Yeah, but it's not what you think. It's just that my life has gotten a bit complicated. - Can I call you? - Sure. Take care, Prue. Bye, Andy. - That was Andy. - I told you I heard a man's voice. What did he want? He asked me out. And you said? Well, I started to say yes and then I stopped. I wondered if I could date. I mean, do witches date? Not only do they date, but they usually get the best guys. You two will not be laughing when this happens to you. Believe me, everything will be different now. Well, at least our lives won't be boring. But they'll never be the same. And this is a bad thing? No, but it could be a big problem. Prue's right. What are we gonna do? What can't we do? We're going to be careful.
