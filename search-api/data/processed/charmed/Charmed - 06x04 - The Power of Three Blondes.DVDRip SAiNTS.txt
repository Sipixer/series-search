- How will I ever be okay? - You learn. If that demon is anywhere in that Book, I'm gonna nail his sorry ass. Those poor children. They were so scared. I could feel their pain. Okay, maybe you could feel their pain a little less, Phoebe. Remember, she's an empath now. I know what her powers are. Okay, I think a little sister bonding is in order for all of us here. - I'll get the tea. - No. Did you see that demon? Did you see those teeth, flying out like razor blades? We need to kill that demon. For the children. All six of those children. Fine, we'll hit the Book now, tea later. - Told you it wouldn't work. - Well, it's her fault. Who's ever heard of a demon with razor flying teeth before? My fault? I'm not the one who made the innocents - into the von Trapp family. - Did not. - Did too. - Knock it off. It's my fault for going along with you two. We can look like the Charmed Ones, but let's face it, our acting sucks. If we want the Book of Shadows, we need to become them. It's time to try my identity-theft spell. No way! They'll come after us. It's a suicide mission. And it's dangerous too. So what? You wanna be chiselers your whole life? It's time to think big, and thinking big means making the whole world believe that we are them. I don't wanna be them. I wanna be bad. - Me too. Bad's better. - Then stick with me. Because once we get the Book, we'll steal their powers and then form our own power of three. - And you know what that means. - No. - And you know what that means. - No. We'll be the untouchable sisters. Phoebe, Paige, are you up there? Perfume, girls. What time did he go to sleep? Okay, can you call me as soon as he starts to stir? Okay, thanks. Jack, the band is coming in in an hour to set up and do a sound check. Can you take care of them? I wanna be home when my baby wakes up. - I'm on it. - Hey. You ready for lunch? I was thinking I can make you something fabulous at home instead. Piper, every new mommy needs a little grown-up time. - That's why we got the nanny, right? - Right. So let's go... Was that a moan? - Piper! - What? That new bartender guy is checking you out. Are you telling me that you're feeling what he's feeling for me? Yes, I still can't control my new power. All right, that's it. Take your shoes for a walk, buddy. - That's creepy. - I know, it's horrible. You should have seen it the last time Jason was in town. I couldn't keep my hands off of him. I don't know what I'm gonna do this weekend. Jason is flying in from Hong Kong again? Wow, I'd say that guy is falling for you. You think so? I think so. I hope so. But all I can feel is this strong sexual desire for me. And that's a bad thing. Yeah, it's a bad thing if that's all he's feeling. And if it is all he's feeling, I want to know now so I don't get hurt. Well, why don't you take him to a restaurant, where you can't get buck wild, and ask Jason how he feels. The direct approach. Very sneaky of you. And if that doesn't work, ask him about the weather in Hong Kong. - No. - No. We're not demon hunting. We're going to lunch. Hey, I am not unreasonable. We can hunt demons after lunch. - By the way, anyone seen Leo? - No, I have not. - I haven't either. - If you do, let me know. There's a rumour that he has a lead on who sent him to Valhalla. I'm sure that's very important stuff, but I have another question. Did either one of you leave the Book on the floor last night? - On the floor? - No, I didn't. Chris? I vaguely remember a story that started like that in the future. - Someone was after the Book. - Demons are always after the Book. - What's new? - I think this time they get it. You should take this threat seriously. And tell Paige. - Where is Paige? - She's at her new temp job. - She's still on that kick? - It's not a kick, Chris. It's her quest for happiness outside of magic. Yeah, but it's a temp job. Who finds happiness on a temp job? Straighten your back. You wanna get out of bed in the morning? Back straight. Check. No, no, mira. Don't reach. Let them come to you. Okay. Forget it. Keep the line moving. Okay. How long have you been working here, anyway? Eight years and two herniated discs. Didn't know what you were getting into on this one, did you? No, I can't say as I did. But it's fun. You know, I get to work with my hands and it's kind of like nature. And best of all, there's no magic. Markers, magic markers, I'm crazy... Crazy allergic. Oh, no. Watch out! Everybody okay over here? She saved my life. - It was nothing. - All right, everybody, take 20 till we can perform a safety check here. That is the third accident this month. I think this place is maldito. Cursed. I think I'm maldito. I can't tell if anyone's home from here. If I get Piper's powers, first thing I'm gonna do is freeze these unwanted facial lines. I'm the oldest, I get Piper's powers. You'll get Paige's. Well, in that case, maybe I'll orb away this blemish. Stakeout takeout, anyone? All I asked for was a scrying bulb. Just because we killed the owners here doesn't mean we should let their food go to waste. Give me sight though the blackest bile Show me the faces I revile Piper's the only one home right now. We need all three sisters together for my spell to work. She's with the baby. I can't wait to orb that thing into a volcano. As the baby in the family, I'm afraid I'll be doing the orbing. - We get our powers by sorority. - That's "seniority," Margo. And that's not fair. I wanted Paige's power. Don't talk to me about fair. I always got less growing up. And usually two years out of style. There's nothing wrong with Phoebe's powers, Mitzy. - You'll be able to levitate. - Yeah, six feet in the air. Margo will be orbing around the world. I'll send postcards. Don't forget, you'll also have the power of premonition and empathy. Like I care what happens to people or how they feel. Maybe you should care, instead of this "me, me, me" attitude all the time. You're gonna get your teeth knocked in if you don't back off! Enough! What is wrong with you two? We have worked way too hard to let it all fall apart now. Hello, are you the lady of the house? Go away. This is the biggest con of our lives. If we don't get this right, we're gonna be two-bit magic hustlers forever. Is that what you want? But you haven't seen the amazing new Kelby 3000. - Just get inside. - Okay, okay. The secret of the Charmed Ones lies in their sisterhood. The power of three. Well, guess what. We got our own sisterhood. Our own power of three, right here. If we can just stick together, we can have it all. You'll never have it all until you own the Kelby 3000. I'm telling you, this baby is gonna change your... So who's with me? I'm sorry, sweetie. Oh, me too. I'll orb you anywhere you wanna go. That's more like it. Now, let's sit back, relax until the other two get home. All right, look, Mommy'll try it. That's so horrible! Wow, is that horrible. Leo, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here. I was looking for Chris. I heard he was asking about me. He was. He thinks you found the person that sent you to Valhalla. He does? But he's not here. But even if he was, I mean, why can't you use your Elder powers to sense, like you sensed me here with? Sorry. For missing your son? That's okay. As an Elder, I watch over him every minute, but it's not the same, you know. When he's sleeping, sometimes I orb into the nursery just to hold him. Yeah. Yeah. - Piper, you home? - I shouldn't have come. - Sweetie. - Dude, there are gremlins at the fruit-packing plant. And I am the only one who can prevent serious workplace injury. This is not what I planned. You lost me at "fruit-packing plant." It's my new temp job. I keep trying to find a life away from magic, and all I get is magic, magic, magic, everywhere. Oh, don't worry, little dude, I'm not gonna let the gremlins get you. It's okay, I think he just misses his dad. I'm gonna go upstairs and check in the Book of Shadows and see what it says about the capture and control of gremlins. Did you leave the Book on the floor last night? No, why? I don't know, it's probably nothing. Just be on the lookout. Chris said somebody may be after it. People are after it every week. You're okay, you're okay. Fussy babies need fresh air. Oh, that's a good idea. I'll go get my sweater. Nonsense. Let me take the boy for a walk. All right. Just don't forget a hat for those ears. I always keep the baby warm. I meant yours. You are on a real hot streak, kiddo. Your advice column has never been more revealing. Yeah, well, I just think that I'm really in touch with what other people are feeling right now. Whatever it is, keep it up. Honey! - You're back! - God, I missed you, Phoebe. Oh, no. No, no, not again. - What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. How was the weather in Hong Kong? - Weather? - Yeah, I hear it gets very balmy there. - Balmy. - I suppose. You really wanna talk about the weather? No, I just don't wanna be alone with you. I mean, I do wanna be alone with you, just not alone with you here, you know? I just... I wanna be alone with you in a public area. You're still a little shaken up over my last visit. You know, your behaviour wasn't all that... Humiliating and embarrassing. It was. Yeah. I just would appreciate if we could take things... ...slower, you know? Maybe go out for dinner and talk. I'll pick you up at 7. Okay. Can't wait to talk. Talk. You know what this means. It's spell time. We got one shot, so pay attention. After we read this spell, the world will see us as the Halliwell sisters. You mean I'm going brunette? No, you'll look like you do now, but the world will know you as Phoebe. Let's go, let's go! I'm dying to orb someplace far away and exotic, like Fort Lauderdale. Not so fast. The spell only gives us their identities. They keep their powers until we can get to the Book of Shadows. Which we should be able to do once we lure them out of the house. Okay, everyone ready? "Blinking faces blank and ho-hum We are they and they are no one Grant to us the power of three and turn them into nobody" Did it work? One way to find out. Let's call our whitelighter. Chris. Why did you change clothes, Piper? You can't hunt demons in heels. Go switch your shoes and we'll get started. Hey, slow down there, angel. It's all good in the charmed universe. What's your hurry? Paige, did you just call me "angel"? She did. And I can clearly see why. Okay. What are you doing over here? Oh, well, we were just... Solving a murder. Evil has been here, probably spying on us. This could be connected to whoever is after the Book of Shadows. Could be. See that symbol carved into the handle? We think that that represents the astral plane. I don't know. The astral planes are run with spirit and energy. It's not like they manufacture athames there. All the more reason you should orb over and investigate. You want me to orb to the astral plane? Lmmediately. And don't come back till you find out where that knife is from. Can I have a kiss goodbye? No. Oh, well, girl's gotta try. You know what this means. We are charmed and dangerous. Oh, yeah. - Excuse me. Elise? - Phoebe. I thought you left. I did. Now I'm back. That's not against the rules, is it? What you got there? It's a new article for tomorrow's paper. I didn't like what I wrote before. Is this crayon? Eyeliner, actually. I didn't have a pen. Well, it's a little late for new copy, but I'll see what I can do. Awesome. I mean, thank you. Phoebe. Thought you were getting ready for dinner. You are hot. Are you okay? Never better. Did you say we were hooking up tonight? I'll swing by at 7. Great. I'll be ready for you, sugar. I did not fire your band. I need them to play tonight. Today at rehearsal? No, that's impossible. I have been home all afternoon. Okay, listen. I'll be right there. I gotta go to P3, so tell the nanny to give Wyatt dinner if I'm not back in time. Okay. Bye. Okay, this vanquishing potion is more like vanquishing goo. Can you check the last ingredient for me? Sure. - That was different. - Try it again. It's like it's not recognizing us. Okay, that's weird, I was just holding it in my hands ten minutes ago. Wait, Chris said something might happen to the Book, remember, and we just kind of blew him off? Chris! Hello, are you there? Is that you? Who is that? Both of us. - Hello? - Hey, Elise. There's a union rally at the fruit-packing plant? No, I did not advocate multiple sex partners. - I'm not leading the rally, I'm at home. - I didn't say alcohol cures depression. Of course I believe in equal pay for workers. - This is Phoebe. Hello? - Hello? - Emergency at work? - Yeah. - Unfortunate coincidence? - Not likely. I don't know about you, but I wanna keep my job. Yeah, me too. I'll leave a note for the nanny, she's out walking Wyatt. And I'll try to put the Book away. I'm gonna change in case I don't make it back in time for my date with Jason. All right, meet back here as soon as possible. Hey, Ray, did the band leave yet? I'm sorry, ma'am, we're not open yet. - Very funny. - You'll have to come back tonight. Ray, I'm missing dinnertime with my kid because the band cancelled, okay? I'm not in the mood for jokes. They didn't cancel, the owner fired them. Too bad, too, they were good. You one of their groupies? No, I'm your boss and I'm gonna fire you if you don't move it. Look, lady, there's a bar open up the road if you really need another drink. I have to admit, Piper, when you said that there'd be fringe benefits, - you weren't kidding. - Oh, I'm all about job satisfaction. - Yeah? What about after-hours? - Yeah, so do I. And you're gonna be one sorry dude if you don't move! You know what? There's some work I have to deal with, but I'll try to wrap it up early. Why don't you come by the house after your shift. Like you could. Why is Ray acting like he doesn't know me? Would you please tell him who I am? Sure. Who are you? Equal pay, shorter days. Equal pay, shorter days. What a circus. Okay, get down! Quiet down! Everybody quiet down! I talked to my supervisor, and he's replacing all of you if you don't get your asses back on that line! You mean the line with unsafe working conditions? - Yeah! - No medical benefits? - Yeah! - And third-world wages? I don't think so. Equal pay, shorter days. Equal pay, shorter days. May I help you, miss? Oh, it's okay, I work here. Who's that girl on the conveyor belt? I'd like to see some ID, please. - Who you steal this from? - What are you talking about? Come on, let's go. Split up, fan out. Find the Book. We don't have much... I'm on to you three. What do we do? You thought you could fool me, but you can't. This athame isn't from the astral plane. You sent me on a wild-goose chase so you wouldn't have to hunt demons, didn't you, Piper? - Busted. - Guilty. You figured us out, Chris. We are so sorry. Yeah, you should be. Look, there's an evil out there after Wyatt, and we need to find him before he... Phoebe, what are you doing? Finding comfort in my whitelighter. You're all over him. You're just jealous because I got to him first. Look, Phoebe, I know Piper hooked up with her last whitelighter, but I'm really, really not interested, okay? Can we get back to hunting demons, please? Actually, Chris, we can't. We didn't ditch you to play hooky. We needed time to investigate the death across the street. Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? I would have given you time off for legitimate charmed duties. Well, we're asking now. We believe that athame belongs to witches. Really smart, pretty witches. We just don't know who they are. So why don't I check around this realm for you. It's like you read my mind. See? I can be reasonable and helpful. All you gotta do is be honest with me. Okay, now we really are running out of time. We need that Book. You two search down here, I'm gonna take upstairs. And from now on, keep your hands off the whitelighter. That's an order. Hurry. Hurry, before they get home! This is it, this is what we want. All right, who do you think you are? Oh, you haven't heard? We're the Charmed Ones. Nice dress. Thanks. Nice Book. - "Powers of the witches, rise" - Hey, hey. I can't freeze them. "Come to us, who call you near Come to us and settle here" Let's see, what was that freaky little hand thing you did? Like this? Oh, I'm down! Paige. - I can still orb. - That was supposed to be my power. - Freeze them! - I don't know how! You guys gotta see this. There's spells, potions, charms for everything. Once we get rid of the Halliwells, this Book is gonna change our lives. You guys, my arm's getting sore here. How about a little relief? Never takes this long to scry for a witch. That's because they're not witches anymore. We got their powers. Excuse me. You got their powers. I got a big, fat nothing. As usual. Margo, please. Ease off the resentment pedal there. You're dragging me down. Oh, this is great: Vanquishing tips on all of our competition. Paige orbed. How could she still do that? We cast a spell to call the witches' power. Paige's orbing must come from her whitelighter side. Well, then, let's call for her whitelighter's power. Well, then, let's call for her whitelighter's power. - Because I wanna orb! - Yo, Margo. Get over it already. Your negativity is giving me a migraine. You think it's bad now? Just keep flaunting that empath power at me. I'll start hating on you for real. - Hey, we're in here! - We made the Book of Shadows? What, no picture? Just a paragraph. A really, really tiny paragraph. "The Stillman sisters: Mabel, Mitzy, Margo. Common witches known for their small-time hustles and cons. Not worth vanquishing. If they become a nuisance, try a simple spell to bind their magic." Well, at least we got an entry. Yeah, but look at what they think of us. Common witches, not worth vanquishing? Is that right? Well, check what these common witches just did. We're standing in the home of the Charmed Ones. We got their powers. We got their Book, and we got... ...blond, multi-tonal hair. Who's the nuisance now? - We are. - Oh, yeah. So let's use all these powers and find the Halliwells. We cannot rest until they're dead. Phoebe's boyfriend. She had dinner plans with him tonight. Go. Margo and I will work on spells. Wait, what? Why does she get to go on a date? We have to keep up pretences. If Leo or Chris find that we're impostors, they're gonna send the entire magical community after those girls. And then we'll never find them. Go. I felt that, Miss Blackheart. Let's get to work. Okay. Okay. Let's see what we got here. This... You all right? - Yeah. - You sure? Oh, it's really bad. It's really, really bad. Okay, just do what you can. We have to get back to the manor fast, for Wyatt. They're not gonna hurt Wyatt. They won't risk exposure. Not while we're still alive. How are we gonna stay alive? How are we gonna fight without our powers? - At least you could still orb. - I wish you could orb to Leo. I'd give anything for one of his unwanted visits right... Piper, we should get you to the doctor. - No. - Why? The same reason we paid cash for this room: Because without picture IDs, we got no credit cards, we got nothing. It's like we don't exist. Everyone thinks we're these trashy blonds. I do have to hand it to them, though. They've taken identity theft to a whole new level. What about Chris? What if we get him in the same room with the blond ones? Then we can prove to him they're fakes. How? He can't hear our call. Going in the manor right now would be suicide. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Maybe we can find some magical creatures to help us, like fairies or muses. What do you think? We won't be able to see them. We're not witches anymore. You're not, you can't see them, but I'm still half whitelighter. And I actually happen to know where a couple of handy-dandy gremlins like to hang out. You mean the fruit-packer-killing variety? No, no, no. This could actually work. Gremlins are fast, right? They can move between realms. They could actually help us find Chris. - What if they say no? - Well, if they say no, then I'll just have to threaten their little butts with my vanquishing gel. Okay, Paige, you orb to the plant and find those gremlins. Chris has gotta be back at the manor by midnight. - Piper, stay here where you're safe. - Where are you going? I'm going to hand out a personal invitation. Hey, now! Who did you knock off for this? Oh, it's nothing. There's so much that I want for us, Phoebe... How many carats are these? Miss, could we have a wine menu here, please? Sure. Hey. You just earned yourself a big, fat thank-you. Better get that. Phoebe, what are you doing under the...? My wife was wondering if you have any champagne. How dare she. I only drink it on special occasions. This is our 42nd wedding anniversary. You slut! Can l...? Can I talk to you, Phoebe? Up here, where I can see your face? Today you said you wanted to talk. And now you're groping me under the table. What's going on? Well, if you didn't interrupt me, you would have figured it out. Look, Phoebe, maybe you got the wrong guy here. Because this isn't what I'm about. Really? Do you really mean that? Who are you? She's nobody, baby. Let me take care of this. Listen, sweetie, l... Lady, what the hell's going on here? I'm so sorry, I thought she was someone else. I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, little blue fellas! Come on out, I won't hurt you. Hey, will you slow down for a second? I have an offer I'd like to discuss with you. What's it gonna be? Piper? What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? Yeah. But in front of our son? The lights are off. I think I'd better go, Piper. I'll see you tomorrow at work. No. Wait. Oh, man. Look what you did. Aren't we, like, divorced or something? What are you doing here? I told you, sometimes I visit Wyatt in the nursery to hold him. It's the only chance I get to spend any time with him. You know what? You're right. I'm a terrible mother. I don't deserve our son, you should take him. Careful, I just might. Great, it's settled. He's yours. Piper, what's the matter with you? You're not acting like yourself. I'm sorry, Leo. I just think I'm just postpartum. I've just been so tired and overworked. It would really help out if you could take Wyatt off my hands for a while. Please? Don't worry about the bartender. We've got bigger fish to fry. Okay, if the gremlins found Chris, he should be here by now. Well, he'd better hurry. Okay, this is not good. Okay. You Charmed Ones think you're so clever. Surprised to see us? I got my first premonition tonight. I know you did, you genius. I planted it to lead you here. Well, from where I'm standing, that seems like a stupid thing to do. And I know a lot about stupid things. Yeah, see, she's got us there. You wouldn't happen to know any gremlins, would you? - It's about time. - Chris, thank God. Look at them. Look at them, they're impostors. They stole... Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Who are you? They're witches. They're the ones that killed that guy across the street. No, Chris, she's lying. Remember this morning, you said something was gonna happen to the Book? This is it, it's happening now. Enough of this. Piper, blast them! How do you know what I said to Piper? Because she is Piper. And I'm Paige, and this is Phoebe, and they cast an identity spell to make the entire world think they're us. That's ridiculous. Everyone knows the Charmed Ones are blond. If you're Piper, then show me your powers. Blast me. I can't. You stole them. Okay, so we stole your identities and your powers. Wow, we must be good. - Worth more than a paragraph. - Oh, yeah. It's time to take care of you witches and your delusions. Wait! Wait. I can prove that we're telling the truth. I can still orb, I'm half whitelighter. Okay. Go for it. Okay. What do you think of my anti-orb spell? Oh, you...! Go ahead, Piper, blast away. She missed, Chris. When have you ever known Piper to miss? Even I'm entitled to a bad day. Come on, try again. Chris, a little help here? Oh, you know what, she's getting angry. And our powers don't work so good when we're angry. - We got them now. - Yeah, you got us now, so why don't you blow us up. Piper, death bad, life good. Don't worry, this bimbo couldn't hit the broad side of a beauty parlour. Check out that dye job. How dare you! Run. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we need weapons. - Demon leftovers! - Okay. - Oh, Piper, Piper, for you. - I got it. - Okay, ready? - Yes. - Okay, ready? - Yes. Now! So that's how it works. Could we, like, not stand here right now? Now what? Now we kill them. You did it. Nice work, babe. This is not fair! First I get ripped off in the power department. Then you bag the bartender and the boyfriend lays diamonds on you. - That whitelighter belongs to me. - Oh, my head! You know, you really need to learn how to control your emotions. I can't help it that Chris chose me. Did you sleep with him? - No. - Yes. You did what? I gave you a direct order. That whitelighter was off-limits! You know what? I am sick and tired of your orders. We both are. Stay out of my feelings. Oh, are those your feelings? Hell, yes, those are my feelings. You boss us around like we're idiots. What? She thinks we are idiots. - I didn't say that. - I bet she felt it. - My little empath feels everything. - He's right. You despise us. In fact, until I became an empath, I never realized how you truly hate us. You know what? Come on, baby, let's go. Who needs them? You're not going anywhere. We gotta stick together or our plan falls apart. See? There you go, bossing again. Just let the little chippy run off, if that's what she wants. Don't call me a chippy! Don't push me! Just shut up! You should be able to handle these women now. Not the nose, please. I think you have something that's mine. Sure, it's yours. Anything you want. Thank you. I take it this was all your doing. You're the one who got me here. How did you know they weren't us? Well, in all my life, I've never seen you take the bait the way that witch took it from you. In all your life? You've only been our whitelighter for two months. Let's just reverse the magic. "Powers of the witches, rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us, who call you near Come to us and settle here" So we binded their powers and handed them over to Morris. There's enough evidence across the street to book them for murder. And if that doesn't stick, they're wanted in eight other states. Looks like you two had a good time. Yeah. He loved all the clouds up there. I bet. Well, he just finished a bottle. He's probably ready for a nap. I should get going. Leo, wait. Don't go too far away from Wyatt, okay? I mean, feel free to sneak in and hold him any time I'm not around. Thanks. Leo, can I talk to you for a second? See you, buddy. There's a rumour floating around up there that you got a lead on whoever scattered your orbs. Yeah, I know. I floated it. You did? Why? To draw out the guilty party. - Did it work? - You tell me. So far, you're the only one to come forward with any questions. It's an interesting experiment. When you find out who did it, let me know. Oh, I already know who did it, Chris. And when I get enough proof to expose him... ...you'll be the first one to know. I don't know why I keep running into magic, but thanks to you two, I have my identity back and the fruit packers are unionized. So for now, I'm just gonna go with it. However, you two can't hurt people anymore. That's why I brought you here, so you can tinker away to your heart's content. Well, have at it, little blue dudes. - Hi. - Hi. Can we talk? - About? - Us. I thought we tried that earlier. I was kind of hoping we could forget about that. Okay. - You're still mad. - No, no, actually, I'm confused. I swear, every time I see you, I never know which Phoebe I'm gonna get. - You either wanna talk or you want... - Yeah. I know. But I don't know how to act around you either. You know, you fly in for a few days, and we're supposed to squeeze everything that we're feeling for each other in those few days, and it's just... It's just really hard. I know. And that's why I wanted to go to dinner, you know. Just so we could talk. Figure out how we feel about each other. How's your nose? My nose? Oh, yeah, my nose. It's pretty good. I'm a fast healer. Well, I should probably let you get back to work, huh? What are you doing right now? Trying to make a classy exit. You wanna go to a classy lunch? We'll just... We'll talk. I'd love to.
