Reach back throughout the ages Humbled by his power We invite him into our circle - Are you all right? - Just keep chanting. We've been chanting for 15 minutes. It's a s√©ance, Amanda, not AT&T. He'll come, he has to. Come on. We call on the demon Kryto Reach back throughout the ages Humbled by his power We invite him into our circle Who dares summon me? Three who are humbled by your presence, Kryto. - What do you want? - That which only you can give. Youth, beauty, health. What can you give me? We know how to make you whole again. - We can bring you back. - But I want more. I want powers. Great powers. - Don't ever summon me again. - We can get you great powers. The power to move things with your mind, to stop time, to see into the future. Do so, and you'll have your youth. I had to say something. We were losing him. You lost him already, Gail. Why would you promise him something we can't get? What if it makes him angry? I can get the powers, Helen. I have to. I'm not ready to die. I'll be back. Just be sure you have the quilt finished by tomorrow night. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. What's up? Have you made an appointment to see the optometrist yet? Prue, I keep telling you, I do not need glasses. Oh, well, then... ...this might help. Unrelated. Look, I really need your help. Piper's throwing out her boots. The tan ones. Piper, what are you doing? Those are your favourite boots. I know. Demon blood from one of our vanquishings. And I can't get it out, and I can't exactly explain it to the shoe-repair guy, can I? It's the third damn pair this month. - What's the matter, honey? - Nothing. I gotta go to the club. Dan's waiting for me. Are you really gonna break up with him? I have to. I mean, I love him, but I love Leo more. Not that I'm any closer to figuring out how that's gonna work either. Sometimes being a witch sucks. Wicca PMS? I have a feeling it's a lot more than that. - Aunt Gail. - My beautiful girls. - Hey. - Hey. I knew we had an old picture of you and Grams somewhere. Oh, my God. Look how young we were. I remember when this was taken right outside our sorority house. - We just met. - A couple of hotties. Well, that was then. This is now. Hey, now looks pretty good. Believe me, the golden years are anything but. Mostly it's regret. Oh, I miss your Grams. I still can't believe she's gone. You just never know when it's your time, do you? Anyway, you both sound like you're doing very well. You and Piper and your careers, and you back in school. - Good for you. - Yeah, we're doing all right. What about men? Anyone special in your lives? Nope. Well, I mean, Piper's got someone, sort of. I think we're just picky. We don't wanna go through all the husbands that Grams went through. Don't be too picky. You don't wanna end up an old spinster like me. Are you okay? Here, have some of this. Thank you. Damn allergies. So, what brings you to San Francisco? Well... ...my dears... ...you do. Do you remember the bridge clubs your Grams always hosted here every other Saturday? Did you actually see any of us play any cards? No, Grams always sent us outside to play. That's because it wasn't a bridge club. It was her coven. Your Grams was the most skilful witch any of us ever knew. - Witch? - Oh, well, I still practice the craft myself every now and then. I don't have any real powers. Mostly I just play around with it. Wow. You and Grams, witches, who knew? You don't have to pretend with me. Your Grams told me everything, including what you'd become when she died. The Charmed Ones. - Hey. - Hi. You're... You're late. Sorry, a little jet lag. I was walking by a store window on Fifth Avenue, - and I couldn't resist. - Oh, no. Please don't be a ring. I hope you like it. They're beautiful. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - If you don't like them, you can... - It's not that, Dan, it's... - Did you think it was a ring? - No, of course not. Don't be silly. It's just that... - Did you need to get that? - No, the machine will pick it up. - Hi. Leave a message. - Dan, we have to talk. Piper, it's me. Look, I know you're there. Just pick up. - Talk about what? - Well, to be honest... Aunt Gail's in town and guess what. She knows we're you-know-whats. Hi. I'm not alone here, remember? I thought that that would get your attention. Prue, this is a really bad time. Okay, well, I'm sorry, but it's important. Hey, wait. How does Aunt Gail know that we're...? You know what, never mind. You can tell me later. I have to go, Dan is here. Look, Aunt Gail needs our help. She's in trouble. What do you mean? What kind of trouble? The kind of trouble you can't talk about with Dan right there. Demon trouble. Of course, why not. All right, I'll just put my life on hold one more time and I'll be right there. - A little trouble at home? - When isn't there? Well, you wanna talk about it on the way to your car? No, I don't. How about dinner tonight? Let's make it tomorrow night just to be safe. - I don't wanna have to cancel on you. - It's a date. - Have you contacted the police yet? - And tell them what? That I think there's a demon running loose in our streets? - They'd think I was crazy. - Try getting your boots cleaned. Don't ask. So you said that corpses have been found dug up and skinned. I mean, what do the police think about that? - I don't know. - Maybe it's just a sicko grave robber. Well, it's more than that. I may be wrong, but I think I remember seeing in your Book of Shadows that... Okay, wait, you know about that too? And one evening when your Grams was showing it to me, I think that I remember seeing something about a skinned demon, or something, who made people young again. Young again? Well, what's so bad about that? There's gotta be a catch. There's always a catch. Are you sure that the book said it was skinned? I think so. But maybe we better go look. - You ready? - All set. Okay. Do you think Gail will really be able to get their powers? Well, she better, and soon. The skin quilt is almost done. Here's something. "Kryto, the demon of vanity." Kryto, that sounds vaguely familiar. What does it say? "In the 16th century, Kryto travelled from dukedom to dukedom preying on people's vanity, bestowing youth and beauty in exchange for their souls." Youth for souls. Why would anybody make that trade? Believe me, I know a lot of people who'd consider it. Age, disease. That's why I'm so worried. I know so many potential victims in Santa Costa, friends. - Are you squinting? - No. "Kryto was found out and skinned alive by a group of witches who believed it would keep his spirit from ever being resurrected again." - You were right. - But those witches obviously weren't. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a vanquishing spell in the book. So someone is skinning people to give him a new skin? Well, give him a new body, summon his spirit, makes sense. Well, at least it's an easy vanquishing spell. I mean, if Kryto really does exist, it shouldn't be a problem getting rid of him. Goodness, you must be really powerful witches. Oh, rub it in. How soon can you come to Santa Costa? Prue, Phoebe, can I talk to you for a sec out here? Take your time. Piper, Gail is like family. You love her. We all do. She was like a second Grams to us. Yeah, only a nice one, one that never said no. I know that. But something about her story... It's just... It's not right. I mean, bodies are being dug up all over town, skinned, and she's the only one who's noticing? I admit it's funky, but what are we supposed to do? - Tell her we're not gonna help her? - No, of course not. It's just that it's never-ending. I mean we have no lives. I don't even have time to break up with Dan properly. Look, honey, Santa Costa is right over the bridge. We'll leave early, go check things out, be back by tomorrow night, okay? Hi. So we'll be there at 9:00 tomorrow morning, okay? Would you like to stay here? We have plenty of room. Oh, no thank you, I have to get home. Cats to feed, you know. Thank you. You'll never know how much this means to me. We call on the demon Kryto Reach back throughout the ages Humbled by his power We invite him into our circle Well done, ladies. Now, make us young. First, the powers you promised. They'll be here soon. Nice work, Pheebs. Only a couple hours late. - Yeah, next time I'll navigate. - It's this map. It's messed up. There is no connector road on Highway 28. No? What is that? - That little squiggle? - Yeah. I didn't see that. And don't tell me I need glasses, okay, because anybody could've missed that. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wearing glasses. - I mean, I wear them. - I know, but you're older. - Well, you are. - Right. Well, you know, I really hope that demon of vanity isn't after you because your soul would be toast. I'm just gonna ignore that comment and go ask for directions. Okay. Cute, huh? Still holding hands. That could be you and Leo in, like, 50 years. Me maybe, but not Leo. Whitelighters don't age, remember? They're not supposed to date witches either, so maybe I don't have to worry about that. Piper. I know, I'm sorry I've been a drag lately, but I've just been confused and frustrated. I mean, nothing's changed really since Leo and I met, except that I'm two years older and still have no idea what we're doing. Sometimes I worry we're all gonna end up like Aunt Gail. Then you take Hotsman to the light. You turn right, pass the fire station to Sycamore. Yeah, and then straight up the hill, and there's a big Victorian on the left. Well, you can't miss it. It's not far. Okay, straight up the hill. Great. Thanks. - Pheebs, come on. - Okay, okay. Oh, excuse me, honey. These your glasses? No, no. No, those aren't mine. We are all set. All words, no squigglies. Let's go. - They're here. - Finally. How long after they drink the potion before we can call their powers to Kryto? It doesn't say. But it shouldn't be long. - More tea, girls? - No thanks. I... ...would love some. Thank you. - How about you? - It's better to humour her, Piper. She won't take no for an answer. Well, then, by all means, fill her up. So, Aunt Gail, who else knows about Kryto and us? Well, I hope you won't be too upset. I had to tell Amanda and Helen. Actually, they were the first ones to tell me about the dug up corpses. Really. Don't worry, we won't tell a soul about you being witches and all. - Our little secret. - That's good to know. - Something the matter? - It's just... What kind of tea is this? It's different. It's a special blend. Listen, maybe you had better get going to start to look for whoever might be trying to summon Kryto. - Gail... - Two of the corpses were found in that old furniture warehouse out on Route 10. - Weren't they, Helen? - Yes. I think so. - That's not really a lot to go on. - Well, you have to start somewhere. You just go up Route 10, and then turn up Willow and it will be right there. Okay, so I guess we'll be back later. Yeah, we'll be here. Kryto said they weren't supposed to leave. I know, but they were getting suspicious. Are you sure you're not trying to protect them? Of course I'm trying to protect them. I feel bad enough about stealing their powers. But they're family, and no demon is going to hurt them. Come on. We just have to keep calling for their powers until the potion takes effect. You guys see anything? Are you sure this is the right place? Don't look at me, I didn't navigate this time. Are either of you thinking what I'm thinking? Wild goose chase? Why would Aunt Gail send us out here for no reason? I don't know, but she seemed in an awful hurry to get us out of... You okay? No, I'm kind of feeling light-headed all of a sudden. I'm not feeling so hot myself right now. Powers of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here It's not working. - It will. - It better. Powers of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Powers of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Time for you to hold up your end of the bargain. Oh, my God, Gail. It worked. Now, us. - It's our turn. - Yes, it is. What are you doing? You see, I can take youth away as quickly as I can grant it. But why? It takes three witches to summon me, and three to banish me. You do the math. I wanted more powers to protect myself. Now, I want you to introduce me to other willing souls who want to be young again, unless you care to end up like your friends. Beauty has its price. - Aunt Gail? - Anybody home? I don't understand what the hell is going on. - I told you something wasn't right. - Well, what's not right is I have a feeling it's Gail and her friends who summoned this demon. If that were true, why would Aunt Gail want us to come to Santa Costa? - It stinks. - This is what I'm saying. I think it's coming from here. What is that smell? Wait a minute. What are those? Oh, I would say by the looks of things, that's Amanda and that would be Helen. Oh, God. I hope that didn't happen from drinking the tea. No, that must have happened when they tried to summon Kryto. Although, I don't see Aunt Gail here. That's a good sign, I hope. - What's the matter? - I don't know, - but I can't freeze the rat thing. - What? You try. Move it. Okay, what the hell is going on with our powers? Maybe we ought to ask Aunt Gail. Well, they were definitely making a potion in there. A serious one too. - Hemlock root. - No wonder the tea tasted funny. - How did we let her do this to us? - I guess we trusted her. Yeah, well, she just got crossed off my Christmas list. Aunt Gail was Gram's best friend. She used to bake us cookies. And now she's spiking our tea. But why? Just to be young again? I mean she had to know she'd be giving up her soul in exchange. Maybe it wasn't just for youth. Maybe it was for health. These are all doctor bills, recent ones. Radiation treatments, chemotherapy. I don't think she had very long to live. That still doesn't excuse what she did. What she did to us. I mean, you can't use magic to save yourself. No, not without consequences. And there's no bigger one than giving up your soul. I just don't understand. Why steal our powers? Kryto must've wanted more out of the bargain, and Aunt Gail was desperate enough to give it to him. We shouldn't have left her alone in the attic. Okay, well, we have the potion. If we can find the spell, then we should be able to transfer our powers back. You kidding? We won't be able to get anywhere near him. Well, he has our powers, but that doesn't necessarily mean he knows how to use them. Besides, do you have a better idea? Go home and call it a day? Funny, come on. See? You're not the only one, Gail. Everybody wants to be young and attractive. The difference is I knew what I was giving up. They don't. Oh, they will, one day. Their last. Do you know that one? - Introduce me. - No. Tired of being young again already? Hiya, toots. Wait a minute. Tell me those aren't the same guys you asked for directions. Okay, Kryto's close. Let's drive. The only catch is that you have to keep it a secret. You can't ever tell a soul. I'm sure you understand why. What, is this some kind of a joke? If you think it is, then why are you still here? Because some part of you is hoping beyond hope that I just might be telling you the truth, that I can restore your youth. Just like I did for... ...Gail Altman. Gail? Yes, Frank, it's really me. You forgot your... - What? - Three witches. You said you took care of them. - What are you talking about? - You lied to me. Girls, run, hurry! Aunt Gail? So much for him not knowing how to use our powers. I've got one power he doesn't have. - Phoebe. - No, no, no. Okay, wait. - It's just way too dangerous. - Nobody's sending me back again. - We can't just sit here. - No, we have to think. All right, what do we know about our powers that he doesn't? - Thank God. - Stay away from me. All right, Phoebe's thinking what we're thinking. Great, what are we thinking? You can't hide from me. I didn't want to die. I was wrong. Here. You'll need this. The spell. Just follow my lead. You ready? - All right, we give up. - Excuse me? No, no, no, Phoebe, wait. He'll freeze us. That's a marvellous power. Good witches don't freeze. - I'll kill you. - No! Okay, what do we do about Aunt Gail? Well, without our powers, there's not too much that we can do. Okay, so we have to get back our powers, and then find Kryto before he finds us. Agreed. All right, let's go. Piper, come on. Piper, what's the matter? - I've had it. - What do you mean? - You've had it with what? - With being a witch. You betrayed me. At least they got away so they can destroy you. No, they won't. I know where they're going, remember? I saw it. No! - We can't just leave your car. - We'll call a cab. - That'll cost 100 bucks. - I'm not going back to town. - I'm through with demon hunting. - Piper, come on. There's really nothing more to say. Well, if it's getting back our powers you're worried about, I can do that. - I have a spell that can do that. - I don't want my powers back. - You don't mean that. - Don't I? I think it may be the solution to all my problems. Piper, wait a second. I know exactly what you're going through. Remember when Andy died? I didn't want to be a witch anymore either. - This is different. - How? Not wanting to be a witch isn't a symptom of something else like it is for you, Prue. For me, it's the problem. It's the cause. It's the problem with everything. I want a life that doesn't have a lot of death in it. I don't think that's too much to ask. You can't do this. Phoebe, we're all gonna do it, sooner or later. I'm just doing it first. What are you doing? Piper, you can't do this. It affects all of us. Phoebe, I love you. You're one of my two most favourite sisters, but I don't wanna give up having a life. - I'm not asking you to. - Yes, you are, just by asking me to be a witch. Piper, you were born a witch. It's not a choice. It's a fact. Says who? Up until two years ago, I didn't know I was born a witch. Neither did you guys. And we were perfectly happy then. With perfectly normal lives. I miss that, don't you? - No. - Yeah. Well, sometimes. But I've accepted the fact that I can't just turn back the clock and pretend it never happened. And neither can you. I just... I don't wanna end up like Aunt Gail, old and alone, and wishing I was young again so I could do all the things I missed out on. We won't let that happen to you. Just help us get our powers back. Please? We can't do it without you. - We won't do it without you. - No. How do we know Kryto will even come here? If he's gonna look for us, he'll start here. We could try summoning him like Gail and her friends did. I think that only works with spirits, Pheebs. I still don't understand how we can get him to drink this without our powers. We have to get him to use a power he doesn't know how to use yet. - Astral projection? - Exactly. If we can distract him long enough to be in two places... We might be able to trick him into thinking I'm still looking for the potion. I'm only doing this for you guys. If I get killed, I'm gonna haunt the both of you forever. - Yeah, yeah. Got the spell? - Yes. I got it. Anybody home? I know you're here and I know where you are. Phoebe, get the potion. No! I got it. Come on, come on. - Pheebs, get the potion. - Start chanting the spell. - We need the potion first. - It won't work. Just start. I've got a plan. Powers of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us... - Get the potion. - All right. Pretty nifty power, huh? Do it! Give him all of it. He's coming back. Powers of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Wanna see what does freeze? Pheebs. What witch has done And then undone Return this spirit back within And separate him from his skin - Ouch. - That looked like it hurt. Yeah, well, I hope so for Aunt Gail's sake. And Helen and Amanda. Very nice. Well, we thought that you might appreciate a pair without demon blood. I do, very much. Thank you. So, Piper... ...Phoebe and I were kind of wondering... - Because we want you to be happy. - Very happy. So we were wondering if we should be budgeting for more shoes or not. Well, I wish I could tell you getting my powers back made me appreciate what I lost. But... But I feel like I'm back where I started. I mean, I understand what you guys are saying and everything, but I can't change the way I feel. So you really are quitting? I want to for all the reasons we already talked about. But I'm only gonna do that if and when you guys want to also. Well, I'm always gonna wanna be a witch. - That's for sure. - She's young. Oh, give me a break. - All right, I gotta go. - Good luck. Thanks. Poor Dan. So do you think we should worry? - No, he'll be all right. - I mean about Piper quitting. Maybe, a little. You little liar. You did go see the optometrist. Yeah, well... ...let's just say I'm not as concerned with my vanity anymore. You hungry? - No, unless you are. - No, I'm fine. What? I was thinking that it just seems like yesterday you moved in next door, and we, you know... Piper, you don't have to do this. - Do what? - Go through this big explanation. I think I know what you wanted to talk to me about. You're breaking up with me, aren't you? Is it because of Leo? I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. Dan, I will always love you. This doesn't change that. You've been really good to me and treated me incredibly well. But... ...I need to try and make this work with Leo. And it may not, I don't know. But... ...we've never really given it a shot. And I want to. I have to. I'm so sorry. You don't have to be. You're just being honest with me. We're still gonna be
