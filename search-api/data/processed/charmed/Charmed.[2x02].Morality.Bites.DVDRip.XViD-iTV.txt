No. I stepped in it, again. That man has turned our front walk into a puppy minefield. I can't believe that guy still lets his dog do his business - right in front of our house. - Well, we've left notes. - And gotten nowhere. - Yeah, well, I've had it. The next time I catch him in the act, I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind. - That couldn't be. - Oh, I hope it is. That's them. That's the guy and his dog. I can't believe it. That is so rude, he's just gonna walk away. Then don't let him. Use your magic. If you can't teach the dog new tricks, how about the owner? Just think of the money we'd save on carpet cleaning alone. Phoebe, we can't use our magic just to teach him, or anybody else, a lesson. Why not? It's for the greater good. I mean, that's our job, right? Think of it as community service. We'd be doing the whole block a favour. Come on. - Okay, Piper. - Hope he's not out of my range. Prue? - Nice shot. - An eye for an eye, a shoe for a shoe. Oh, duck. - Did he see you? - So what if he did? What's he gonna do, cry witch? Well, we've done our good deed for the day. I think I deserve 15 minutes of channel surfing. - Who wants coffee? - I'll grind. Koko now has a vocabulary of over 500... Justice Today. And Cal Greene tied a record by smashing his sixth grand slam of the year today. Phoebe, are you okay? Take a deep breath, honey, it's all right. No, it's not. I saw my future. I was being executed. Burned alive. Why would a report about a baseball player - trigger a premonition like that? - I don't know. All I know is I could feel it. I could feel the fire. And we were just standing there? That can't be right. - It's what I saw. - There's no way that we would let that happen. Not in the past, present or future. What did I do? Or what is it that I'm going to do? That's Leo. I'll get that. - Hey, stranger. - Oh, is that what I am now? Playing hooky? Well, they're making me work tonight, so I've got the afternoon off. The old "I've gotta save the world" excuse again? Oh, like you've never had to use it. You're about to use it. Well, there's just something I have to do. Maybe you could... Now? - Leo? - It's okay. You go, there's actually something I have to take care of so... Well, we really need to talk about things, you know. About where we stand. Yeah, we do. Rain check? It's what we do best. I hate when he does that. - So, what did he want? - He cancelled our date. He's working again. You didn't ask him what we should do? He had to fly, literally. The pages were doing that flipping thing on their own again. It's a spell to take us to the future. Two, actually. One to send us and one to bring us home. But apparently we only get one shot. Once we use it, they disappear. Wait a minute, you guys. We almost died going back to the past. This is not something that you just do. - We're talking about your life, Phoebe. - And I'm talking about yours, Prue. I'm just saying I think we should think this over a little bit. Look, you had that premonition today for a reason. It must mean that we're supposed to do something about it. Going to the future might be the only way to find out what you did to put you on that pyre. How do you know it's something that I did? It might be a demon or a warlock that puts me there. Do you really wanna wait to find out? Okay, pack your bags. We go, try and figure out what happened, and hopefully come back with enough information to stop it. We're gonna need a date, Phoebe. February 12th, 2009. That's two weeks before the date I saw in my premonition. That should give us more than enough time to figure out what put you there. I wonder how I look. Piper, you look great. This is hardly the time to... Not now. In the future. When we went back to the '70s, we saw ourselves as kids. Now we'll be seeing ourselves walking around ten years older. All the vanquishing, think of the wear and tear. Okay. Hear these words Hear the rhyme We send to you this burning sign - Then our future selves we'll find - In another place and time Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. You... I think you have the wrong house. - Certainly the wrong mommy. - Stop fooling. Car pool. Phoebe. Where's the volume? Command recognized. And more news on the execution of Phoebe Halliwell coming up in just a moment. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming, MTV's Real World 18, on the moon. - Mom, I'm gonna be late. - Okay. - TV, shut up. Mute. Something. - Command recognized. - Morning, Piper. You all right? - I guess. Yeah, it's... With your sister, it's rough, I know. Don't worry about your little one. I'll get her from school like you asked, but you sure you want me to take her to your ex's? "Ex"? As in husband? As in mine? Yes. Yes. If that is what I told you, then yes. So you and he are getting along better now? Maybe. Prue? Prue? Okay, kiddo, let's hit the road. Don't worry, Mommy, I promise I'll do as you ask. I won't use my magic again, ever. Hey, hey, hey, people. Okay, enough. People, stop touching me. Stay. Stay. - Prue, what's going on? - I don't know. But I could get used to it. Check me out. I don't just work at Buckland's, I own it. And three more: Paris, Tokyo and London. And you're blond. Yeah, strange. Wait, you had time to go to work already? Well, actually, I woke up there. But it was amazing. I had all these assistants and this huge office. And I have a chauffeur, and he is so totally hot. How'd you do? Is that a good thing or...? Well, if you ignore my apparently failed marriage, the fact that I'm still living in the manor... Wait. You're married? - Was. My daughter is on her way... - Wait. Stop right there. You have a daughter? Yeah. And she's... She's beautiful. Of course she is. What's her name? Oh, God. I don't know. But, Prue, she has powers. But for some reason I told her not to use them. Why would I do that? Speaking of why, why are we in our future bodies? I mean, I thought that we were just supposed to come here and see them. Well, apparently going to the past isn't the same as going to the future. I just wish that since we are in our future bodies we could remember what's happened in the last ten years, like how I got a daughter. Okay, wait a second. If I'm in my future body, and you are in your future body, then that means that Phoebe... - Oh, TV. Louder. Louder. - Command recognized. - Execution. We're less than eight hours away now until the burning of Phoebe Halliwell, the witch accused of murdering Cal Greene six months ago. Eight hours? We were supposed to be here two weeks before. Let's go there now, live, where Sierra Stone is standing by. Sierra? San Francisco district attorney Nathanial Pratt, whose discovery of the witch last August has made him an early favourite for the governor's seat, just came out to make a statement. Let's listen in. This is a reflection of our citizens' resolve to ferret out the hidden evil, to turn fear into fight, and to band together as one. To cleanse our city of its greatest threat. Tonight, Phoebe Halliwell will burn for her crime. And when she does, let that be a warning to other witches out there. You're next. Oh, surprise. Here we go up the stairs, into the attic, grabbing the Book of Shadows. Please tell me we're still not gonna be doing this in ten years. - Apparently not. - What? - The book is gone. - It's got to be here. We need it to find the return spell. - Prue... - Piper, just help me look for it. - Okay, relax. We'll find it. - You don't know that. I mean, what if it's lost? What if we can't find it? Then we're stuck in our future bodies with no way of getting out of them and no way of saving Phoebe. - Been working out? - Well, I guess that's a little sample of what ten years does to our powers. And to our attic. A key. It's the key to my wall safe at Buckland's. Do you think that means it's there? We've never taken the book out of the house before. Yeah, we haven't, but maybe our future selves have. - The question is why. - We don't even know what we're like in this time period, let alone what we think. But if the book is at Buckland's, maybe it will give us some answers. All right, then we go there first. Then to Phoebe to see if she's all right. Sorry about the mess. Hello. Hello. Could somebody please answer me? I really need to talk to someone. Okay. How about a snack? Maybe some crackers, peanuts? Something? A tray full of goo? Hey, wait a minute... - Don't I even get a phone call? - Shut up, witch. I can't believe you get a limo and a driver, - and I've still got my same old car. - You have a husband. Had a husband, you mean. I'm getting divorced, remember? And how do you know you don't have a guy in this time? I mean, after all, I have a kid and an ex, you could have several. - Ex's? - No, kids. I mean, we're in the future but with no memory of the past ten years. I don't even know who my ex-husband... Okay, apparently my power isn't the only one that's grown. - You just froze... - Everything. - What a difference a decade makes. - What the hell are you doing? Leo, I'm so glad you're here, I have so many... What's wrong? I knew you'd do something stupid like this. You used your magic in public? What's the matter with you? - Are you insane? - Leo... Remember, he thinks we know what's going on. You want to end up like your sister? We had an agreement, no magic for Melinda's sake. - Melinda? - Our daughter. What's wrong? - Our daughter? - Wait a second. You're Piper's ex? Witch! - Okay, what is going on here? - Prue. Over there. Witch! Witch! Hurry, we gotta get out of here before they see you. - "They"? - The witch hunters. Prue? Piper? They haven't been to visit you before. Why would they come now? No... ...they're going to be as happy to get rid of you as I am. Who are you? I'm sorry, it's been so long since our last visit. Executions are a bitch to plan. Logistics, alerting the media, gathering the kindling. You know, I've had a lot of time to do some thinking about... ...why I'm here. - Well... ...no amount of thinking will change the outcome. Justice will be served for your crime. But it wasn't really a big crime, was it? You are truly evil. What bigger crime is there than taking a man's life? I killed someone? Phoebe, what is this? An attempt to stay your execution? Plead insanity? It won't work. - You have five hours to live. - What? Five hours? But that's not possible. Well... ...l'm happy to see the seriousness of your crime has finally hit you. See... ...you represent everything I abhor. You're a threat. A danger to everything that is good and pure in our world. You're talking out of fear. Just because you don't understand something doesn't make it evil. No, it's you who doesn't understand. You killed a man using your power, and now you're gonna die because of it. I only wish that I could burn all of your kind with you. But don't worry... ...in time I will. This is only the beginning. Leo, listen to me. The two of us, the Prue and Piper that you see before you, are from the past. From ten years ago. - So we have no idea what is going on. - Don't even lie to me. All right, Phoebe is set to die today, and I only hope that this madness dies with her. All right, these people are in danger because of the witch trials she started. How? How did she start them? You know, I don't know what you hope to accomplish by pretending not to know. You haven't kissed me like that since... Since this morning, 1999, remember? We were supposed to meet, you had to leave, I went up to the attic and this is where I came. The future. If you don't believe me, at least believe what you feel. Trust that. I remember. That day they sent me to the attic to open the Book of Shadows to the future spell. Wait, that was you? We just assumed that it was Grams. No, it was me. But they didn't tell me why. Wait, you don't know what's happened the last ten years? Any of it? These people... They're here underground because they've been accused of practicing witchcraft. - They're witches? - Some of them. Most of them have been falsely accused. But they're safe here for now. - What did Phoebe do? - Six months ago, she... ...killed a man, Cal Greene. The baseball player? No, this is crazy. I mean Phoebe would never hurt anyone. She hurt him. Because he murdered someone. Someone Phoebe cared about very much. A dear friend who he brutalized. But a technicality set him free. Phoebe was furious, outraged. And that's when she crossed the line from protecting the innocent to punishing the guilty. She used her power to kill Greene, got caught, and her magic exposed by Nathanial Pratt. And this is the result, modern-day witch trials with Pratt at the helm? And Phoebe at the stake, I don't buy it. Her power can't kill. Well, it can now. It's been ten years, all your powers have grown. - We have to get to Phoebe to explain. - You can't. All right, as it stands, you and Prue are safe. Pratt checked you out, and he doesn't suspect that you're witches. To get to Phoebe, you'd have to use your powers. And they'll catch you, then they'll kill you. Leo, she's our sister, we're not gonna let her die. Wait. I'll go. - Leo, this is our sister, we have to. - No. I'm still your guide. I can orb in and keep you out of danger. Then we'll go back to Buckland's and get the book and get the spell to send us home. We'll meet you at the manor. Leo... We got married? Piper, later. There'll be plenty of time later. Oh, Miss Halliwell. Can you sign the PO for the new...? People, give the woman some air. She will meet with all of you after lunch. Thank you. Okay, good news first. The acquisition paperwork was approved and... - Yes? - I'm with her. It's Piper. My sister? Oh, right, sorry. Almost forgot you had another one. I mean, other than... That's okay, I forgot your name too. Anne, Miss Halliwell's personal assistant. Anne, right. My personal assistant. By the way, Anne... ...do you know if my husband called by any chance? Husband, good one. Very funny. Like you have the time. Okay, I just need to get your final okay on the acquisition. Your sister was amazing. I mean at first the board was a little resistant, what with the layoffs it would entail, but Prue pushed it through. I did? I thought the "to hell with the little people" part - was particularly persuasive. - Oh, okay. Anne, sweetie, I really need some private time with my sister so if you can just... - No problem, just buzz me. - Look at me. All right, I am booked with work, I am about to lay off countless people with a flick of my pen, no man to speak of... Maybe you're just picky. What's happened to me? Okay, well, I could dwell on the nightmare my life will become, but we have work to do. At least some things around here haven't changed. Okay, it should be after the demon with the tusk and before the spell to discourage a lover. - Where is it? It was here in l999. - Yeah, and now it's gone. So if the spell can only be used once that must mean that our future selves have already used it. - Which means... - We have no way of getting home. Leo. Oh, thank God. Look, I know what they think I did, and if we just... They'll hear you. Where's the rest of the cavalry? They're not coming. So, what, you'll grab me and we'll just orb out or whatever, - and we'll meet them back at the... - Look, Phoebe... I'm so sorry. For what? Did something happen to my sisters? Nobody's gonna rescue you. If that is some kind of whitelighter humour, let me be the first to tell you, you are not a very funny race of people. You know, I wish you remember what you've done. It would make this so much easier. Your future self used witchcraft for vengeance, Phoebe. Pratt is using that as a platform. Why does everyone think that I killed someone? I wouldn't. I mean, I couldn't. What did I do, premonition the man to death? - My power is passive. - Not in the future. It's grown. It's changed. As have you. Which means, unfortunately, you have to suffer the consequences. No. I don't believe it. Then believe what you see. Oh, my God. What have I done? Leo? Help me! You wanna tell me again exactly how screwed we are? - Pretty screwed. - Thanks. - I wonder what's taking Leo so long. - You know... ...some of these pages are marked. The top corners are turned down, and all of them are new spells. Such as? Like, here's a spell to create a door. One to induce slumber, a glamour to change one's appearance. Some of them have these little baggies attached. Those must be potions of some kind. But what about these? I mean, there's... Okay, one to create money, to bend someone's will, to erase a memory, a binding spell. Binding? What are all these marked for? This must have been our future selves' plan. Here's a prison map. We were gonna use all of this to break Phoebe out. But something is bothering me. I mean, clearly, some of these spells are for personal gain. Which would break the most basic of Wiccan rules. We wouldn't do that. We wouldn't. But maybe in ten years our future selves would for Phoebe. Perfect timing, we found the book, but we can't... - Where's Phoebe? - Where is she? In prison where she belongs. Leo, you were supposed to bring her back here. No, I said I'd go to her. And I did, to explain to her why she has to pay for her crime. You're our guide, you're supposed to protect us, - and you're just gonna let her die? - You're signing her death warrant. I am trying to protect the greater good. All right, if Phoebe lives, if you use your magic to save her, then the persecutions will continue. And our daughter will grow into a world where her power is punishable by death. Do you want that? - Of course not. - Well, then it has to end with Phoebe. - She has to die. - Like hell. Prue, relax. We've seen what your new powers can do when you're angry. He's gonna stay frozen, right? If he knows what's good for him, he'll stay frozen. All right, let's get these spells. Now, some people say this is a victory for me, but I say it is a victory for us all. For today, a blight on everything that is good in our world will be extinguished. Tonight, the witch will burn! Piper, if you're gonna do this, you better hurry. Leo can unfreeze and be home any second. Besides, Phoebe has less than an hour. Can't do it, can you? No. Our grandmother did it to us for protection. You don't have to bind her powers, Piper. We agreed that I'd take care of her, and I will, I promise. I know you will. So we were together. Does that mean you clipped your wings for me? No. You wouldn't let me. We... ...tried to make it work with our powers. But it didn't, and then this all happened, and... Were we happy? Just for a little while, were we happy? Very. Are you gonna try and stop us? I can't do that. Then I hope you understand why I have to do what I'm doing. Yeah. What are we gonna do? What we always do. Talk about it later. What is it? What's wrong? I have no one to say goodbye to. No life. They didn't even know who you were at the office, my own sister. If we die tonight, my tombstone will read, "Here lies Prue. She worked hard." We're not gonna die. We're gonna find a way back to the present, and we'll create a new future. What if we can't? What if we can never get home? According to Phoebe's premonition, we fail. Our future selves fail. We've still got a shot. You're right. You're right. All right, let's go get Phoebe. So far, so good. Don't people normally break out of prison? Nothing about this is normal. "To create a door." Okay, but where? - No place like here. - Okay. Kind of small for us, don't you think? When you find your path is blocked All you have to do is knock - Freeze. - Good idea. All right. Her cell should be up those stairs. Come on. She'll be guarded. Are we ready for this? Do we have a choice? We're too late. I love the smell of burnt witch in the morning. At least I'm paying for my crime. There'll come a day when you'll have to pay for yours too. Remorseless to the end, huh? Let today be a lesson to all those who would seek to defy human nature with their way of life. Let today serve notice that black magic will not be tolerated in our society. And let today be remembered as the day we burned the witch! Piper, freeze him. Prue, Piper. - Come on, we're getting out of here. - No, wait. You can't. - Prue, I'm serious. - What are you talking about? You guys have to leave. I deserve to be here. Or my future self does. But you killed a killer. Don't be ridiculous. Look, this is Pratt's personal crusade. This isn't about us, it is about him. Wherever we go, he will follow us. He will hunt us, he will hunt our families. If anybody should be punished, it should be him. - Prue, what are you doing? - Saving the future good witches - and our future. - Prue, wait. Don't. Don't become a murderer too. It has to end with me. Phoebe, he was evil, he deserved what... The wrong thing done for the right reason is still the wrong thing. Our job is to protect the innocent, not punish the guilty. And I crossed that line, and I know that. And now you guys have to know that too. We are not leaving here without you. Prue, we were sent here for a reason. Maybe not to stop this like what we thought, but maybe to understand why this has to happen. Why you have to let this happen. I don't want to die. But I don't want you to die because of me. I love you. Prue. What are we doing here? Phoebe? You don't think she was...? I mean, we saw... I know. I know. Oh, please, God, don't let it be true. Phoebe. We thought that we had lost you. You did. I was burning. And I could... I could feel the flames on my skin. And then l... I was here. I don't know what happened. It's okay, you're safe now, you're home. Yeah, home, but when? And Cal Greene tied a record by smashing his sixth grand slam - of the year today, making... - Wait, that's the baseball player. That's what triggered my premonition. We're back where we started. The day we cast the spell. Why? Maybe because it worked. We were sent into the future to find out what Phoebe did. Maybe we came back to stop it from happening. But we didn't cast a spell to come back. We didn't even have one. Maybe they sent us back. But who? And why today? If we were sent back to keep the future from happening, shouldn't we have been sent back to the day Phoebe killed Cal Greene? Not again. This guy still hasn't learned his lesson. Apparently, neither have we. I think this is why we were sent back here, to this moment in time. This is where it all started. The first time we used our magic for revenge. But it's just a little thing, it's harmless. Yeah, but once you break the small rules, it's just a matter of time before the big ones are next. A very smart girl once told me that we're supposed to protect the innocent, not punish the guilty. I haven't told you yet. Now maybe you won't have to. Pratt. - Do you think we should follow? - No. Our little act of revenge might have been what sent Pratt on his path to seek his own. Which might have led him to start the future witch trials. Hopefully now he won't. I still think we should keep an eye on him, just in case. Absolutely. Hey, what's up? Not work. There is no way I'm going to the office tonight. I'm going out with you guys. We all have a lot of changes to make if we want to avoid ending up where we just came from. Hey, the future wasn't all bad, you were like Miss Fortune 500. And I had a beautiful little girl. - What? - Details later. We can still make the good things happen, Piper. We just have to make the right choices. So maybe Leo and I will end up together. Wait, you and Leo? Speak of the angel. I'll get that. Hey, stranger. I would have settled for a nice hello. Didn't anybody ever tell you not to settle? That's a good lesson. I've been learning a lot of them lately. So I've heard. Honestly, I didn't know you'd be sent to the future. I don't even know what happened when you got there. All I was told is that apparently you had something to learn. - So that's why you're here? - No. That's why you're here. You three were given a glimpse of your future to learn a valuable lesson. And I'm glad you learned it too, because they wouldn't have brought you back if you hadn't. Speaking of which, they're making me work tonight so I can't really... This is always gonna be a problem for us, isn't it?
