Is it really over? Yes, Sally May, it is. Really and truly? I'm here now. And as long as I'm with you, everything is gonna be A-okay. - Promise? - Promise. You're my hero, Billy! And I think you're swell, Sally May. - Cole? - Phoebe, hi. Just a little trick I learned from the demon of illusion. - But what...? - Am I doing in here? I wasn't sure how you'd react. I thought this might be a safer way of letting you know I was back... ...for good. So I had a really good time tonight, Justin. Did you? I mean, really? The reason I ask is, you seemed kind of quiet. No. It's just that, you know, I've got a lot on my mind with Piper getting married and everything. Sure. Of course, if I was the paranoid type, I'd think it was because of me. Don't be ridiculous. So are we still on for lunch tomorrow? Yeah, pick me up at 1? - It's a date. - Okay. - Good night. - Night. Hey. Gee, Prue, it's only 9:00 and your date's already over? How very Disney of you. Justin has a meeting early in the morning. I see. So did you decide if you're going to invite him to the wedding? No, I'm stalling. I mean, you know, he's a nice guy. He's sweet, but he's just so predictable, you know. There's no mystery, no savoir-faire. You know, besides... ...a wedding invite definitely makes a statement. - That he can tie a bowtie? - No, that the relationship is serious. You know, that it's going somewhere. All that built-in romance, mingling with the family, hidden tensions. All the more reason to have a nice, simple, private wedding. Nice try, mister. Okay, wedding planner tomorrow at 11. No getting out of it, no orbing out of it, nothing. Don't even try it. I don't know. I just don't want her to set herself up for a big disappointment. How do you have a normal wedding when a ghost will be presiding - and the groom's dead? - Leo, don't even try and figure it out. All right? It's the Cinderella complex. Every girl goes through it. I've been dreaming of this day my entire life. - Piper's wedding? - No, mine. I mean, I'm the oldest. I'm supposed to do everything first. I'm supposed to talk first, and get braces, and get a boyfriend, and find a husband. Hey, Prue? Can I borrow your lipstick? - What? - Lipstick, I'm out. Do you mind? Sure, knock yourself out. You're welcome! Speaking of Phoebe, isn't it time to let her off the hook? I mean, she came clean about Cole. Leo, you can't just pretend to vanquish a demon and then two months later say, "Gee, guys, I'm sorry, I didn't." I know, but for what it's worth, I don't think she wants him back in her life anymore. Maybe not, but that doesn't mean he's not gonna try and kill us again. Dantalian. Priestess Dantalian. Were you successful? She's as beautiful as you said she'd be. You're certain this has touched her lips? Absolutely. I watched her all night. Not to be ungrateful... ...but what do you get out of making Prue Halliwell my wife? I'm a humble servant of The Source, Zile. I get nothing... ...other than the benefits we all reap whenever good is turned evil. Still, for all the unions you've consecrated, it seems you should get something. Especially for this one. There is a spoil... ...that intrigues me. The Halliwell Book of Shadows is said to be the most magical of all tomes. The witches' Book of Shadows? That shouldn't be too hard to get. This one is. Evil can't touch it. Although turning Prue evil should turn her sisters and their book evil, as well. Their magic's interconnected. Well, then, I'll get it for you myself, as a token of my gratitude. First things first. Getting the witch here so I can perform the ceremony. That's what this potion is for. Kiss her and it paralyzes her. After I bind you in marriage, she'll fall into a deep sleep, where the transformation to evil will occur. Okay, so the more traditional the better, as far as I'm concerned. The Wedding March starts and I come down the stairs... So no flower girl? I don't know. Do I? Unless you wanna ask Kate down the street. Great idea, maybe she can bring some of her fairy friends. Or trolls, even better. Trolls? Right, trolls. Our father's side of the family is very short. - Right, let's skip the flower girl. - Right. Well, I think we should at least dress the banister with garlands. Maybe even carry the floral theme all the way to the altar. How many guests are you planning on? Let me think, 50, 60? Sixty? Like who? Well, there's all the people from P3, friends, and Darryl, and Dad, Mom. Mom? Piper, I don't really think that you can count her. - We'll have to, if she's going to eat. - Trust me, she won't be eating. I thought your mother passed on. Right, she did. I just meant I hope she's there in spirit. You're right, that doesn't count. Now, have you thought about what hors d'oeuvres you'd like, by any chance? Pigs in a blanket. Leo, I was... I was hoping for something a bit more elegant! I'll get that. Excuse us. We still need to place the ice sculpture. Hello? Oh, hi, Justin. What is the matter with you? Why are you doing this? Because this is a disaster waiting to happen, that's why. Well, keep that up and it will be. Piper, I love you. And I want nothing more for you than to have your dream wedding. But you are kidding yourself with this. We don't need wedding planners, we just need us. You may not need wedding planners, but I do. I don't wanna have to worry about anything. Therefore, if I have to fight a demon in the morning, I know that the flowers will still be there on time. It's not the flowers I'm worried about, it's the guests. As in how do we explain everything to them? I mean, a whitelighter marrying a witch is hardly traditional. Obviously. Okay, Justin, I'll meet you there. Bye. - Hey, Phoebe... - I'm running late for school. - Do you want a ride? - Isn't Justin picking you up for lunch? His car broke down so I'm meeting him there. And I thought that... ...we could talk, you know? Try and put this whole Cole situation behind us. I gotta go. Okay, tell me the truth. Do you think I'm overdoing it with the wedding stuff? Hello? Okay, why is Phoebe going to school without her books? Okay, why is Prue not answering Piper's question? Maybe because she doesn't want both of her sisters not speaking to her. Okay, I have to go meet Justin. - Can I have my lipstick back? - What lipstick? The one that you borrowed last night at the club. Wasn't me. Right, I must have gotten you confused with another Piper. Okay, you have fun with what's going on here, because it looks great. Okay, bye. Cole? Phoebe. I knew you'd know where to find me. That is for ruining my favourite movie. And, oh, yeah, my life too! - Phoebe... - I don't wanna hear it, Cole. I'm over you. I want nothing to do with you anymore. - I don't believe that. - Oh, yeah? Believe it, because if I ever see you again, I'm gonna do what I should have done a long time ago, which is vanquish your sorry ass. Apparently, distance hasn't exactly made the heart grow fonder. Phoebe, wait. Hey! Look, I took a huge risk coming out in the open and contacting you. The least you can do is hear me out! I've been hiding this whole time, shimmering from realm to realm to realm to keep The Source from realizing you didn't vanquish my sorry ass. You're the only one who knows I'm alive. Actually, that's not true. I couldn't keep lying to my sisters. I had to tell them. Okay. That's okay. I understand. As long as you didn't tell Leo. For God's sake, why didn't you just put an ad in the paper? - Tell the whole damn world! - You know, maybe I should have! I risked my life for you, Phoebe, my soul. I've put myself in more danger coming back here than you could possibly imagine. Because I wanna try and figure out a way to make this work between us. Good and evil can't work together. - We did before. - I learned from my mistakes. So did I. Phoebe, I can suppress my demonic half just like I suppressed my human half before we met. I can be good. You've seen that. And if you know I can, then why can't we be together? It's too late. - Hey. Sorry about my car. - Hey. - Thanks for meeting me here. - Oh, that's okay. It's not a... ...problem. What? Nothing. You know, I really should sell that old thing but, I don't know. I kind of like having something not so predictable in this day and age. - Know what I mean? - Right. So... ...you don't think of yourself as predictable? - Me? - Pardon me. - Beringer, private reserve. - Yes, thank you. Predictable? Hardly. Right. Hey, Justin. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I'm picking up Prue for lunch. Piper? - Is something wrong? - I'm not sure. - What's up? - Where's Prue? I don't know. At the restaurant, I guess. Supposedly meeting Justin. - No, I told her I'd pick her up here. - Okay, so you didn't call this morning and tell her that your car broke down and you'd meet her there? No. Oh, no, no. I have to work this afternoon. Well, so your photographs are a little fuzzy. Call it "avant-garde." How important can it be? What? Can I ask you a favour? Sure. Last night when we kissed goodbye it was... ...I don't know, not great. Yeah. How about we try it again? See if we can't do it a little better? Come on. What's the worst that could happen? Where am I? I can't move. My apologies. It's true. Every bride is beautiful on her wedding day. - Find her? - Not yet. - We're screwed. - Not yet. - Leo, what did you find out? - Nothing. Okay, now we're screwed. Nothing on the map, nothing in the Book. Leo, somebody must know something. The Elders support your shape-shifting warlock theory, but they can't get a clear read on the situation. Wait. So Prue's vanished from your radar - and something's jamming theirs? - Something like that. But she can't be dead. They'd be able to sense that, no matter how evil is interfering. Okay, then what's going on? What are we up against? Something powerful enough to keep us from finding her. Well, you knew as your powers grew, evil's would too. Yeah, so powerful that we can't figure out who they are, let alone how to fight them? That sucks. All right, what we need to figure out is why a warlock wants Prue alive. Well, it can't just be for her powers. I mean, they wouldn't need to keep her alive to get them. Unless it's an upper-level warlock which wants... All of our powers. But we still have the same problem, no idea how to find her. It's too bad you vanquished that demonic bounty hunter. Could have helped. Right. Where are you going? I have a hunch. Wait for me. Shall we begin? I'm ready. I hope so. In the beginning, we were damned. And through damnation, we found freedom, power and purpose. As I unite you today... ...I remind you of those gifts. And in your union... ...may these gifts increase... ...so your powers may grow in the service of... ...evil. So be it. How long before her transformation is complete? Sundown. Can you wait that long? For the power of the Charmed Ones? I can wait a few hours. Let me be the first to congratulate you. Why? Because I'm tired of bestowing great power on others. The Halliwell Book of Shadows is the key to unbelievable power, for me. Evil will spread from this sister to the other two, and from them to the Book, and once the Book is evil, it'll be mine. And I will be unstoppable. But know this. I will enjoy killing all of you. Cole? Cole? Please, if you can hear me, l... I was beginning to think I'd never see you again. I'm not here because of us. I need you to help me. If you do, it doesn't change anything between us, you have to know that. - I'm listening. - Prue was taken... ...by a warlock. - Do you know which one? - We think he's a shape-shifter. But the weird thing is, nobody from our side can get a read - on where he's hiding her. - That doesn't make sense. Warlocks don't have that kind of power. He must be working with somebody that does. Certain dignitaries have the power to shield their activities. Demonic judges, dark priests, anyone who needs privacy for rituals. What kind of rituals? To accomplish what? It's hard to say. It could be anything. They may want your book. We all want your book. - Really? - I wanted the Book... ...at first. Well, how can we find out who wants it now? I could check around, but I'd risk demons finding out I was still alive. I'm sure there's still a huge bounty on my head. I want my sister back. No matter the cost? I want my sister back. I'm doing this for you. Know that. Now I'm really confused. Me too. I... I don't... I don't know where that came from. Okay. I better go. Listen, if you don't hear back from me... ...I got caught. I thought you said there was nothing in the Book. Well, now there's just a whole bunch of weirdness in it. Look. Hemlock killing spell? That doesn't belong in here. But it does have possibilities. Piper. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was... Piper? In here, somehow. - You blinked. - I did not! - Only warlocks do that. - Piper, you did it. - Hey. - Where have you been? Brainstorming. How's it going here? Your sister's blinking. l... I'm... I'm sorry, what? Okay, I admit it was definitely weird. But it was kind of fun. I was... I was in there, and I was thinking about the kitchen. And then, suddenly, boom! Here I was. That is so cool. Except that it's a warlock's power. So what? They're always trying to get one of ours. It's about time we get one of theirs. - Try it, Pheebs. - Okay, what do I do? Just think? And blink. Catch us if you can! Have you tried it yet, Leo? It's a real head rush. Do you realize how serious this is? You're blinking, the Book is changing. Maybe we're blinking because of the Book. The Book is changing because of you. It is an extension of you. I should care about that. But I don't. This is what I was afraid of. Whoever's got Prue is somehow reaching you too. Okay, Leo, I can tell this really upsets you, but I gotta tell you I really like this whole "think and it happens" deal. I mean, just think of the time we could save not chanting. Piper, Phoebe, you have to fight this. Or we could answer the door. For Prue's sake, stop! Don't tell me what to do. Phoebe, I need your help. I am so tired of helping people. So glad you're home. We have some floral sketches we'd like you to see. Now's not really a good time. They're welcome to come in, Leo. I've revisited the dinner menu, Piper, and you are going to be thrilled. I have some dynamic choices that l... I want pigs in blankets. It's nice to see a bride who still has a sense of humour this close to the big day. No, I want pigs in blankets. Marie seems very scared. I always had her pegged as an ice queen. What a great idea. Now, there is a freezing power with kick. Have you guys lost your minds? Oh, Leo, get onboard. Whatever it is, this is fabulous. You can't imagine the freedom, the power. Phoebe, that is evil talking. You have to fight it. - What did you ever see in him? - I don't know. He is kind of a stick-in-the-mud, isn't he? Oh, another great idea. May I? Be my guest. All right, think about the power of... Look at all the fun we've been missing. And this is just the beginning. See you, Leo. Just the beginning. Oh, you know, it's your wedding. Shouldn't the first kill be yours? This is too easy. It's boring. I wanna do something bigger. Count me in. You know, if what's happening to us is happening to Prue... Then the power of three can be truly amazing. We have to find her. But first, we need to clean house. I'm sorry. What were you saying? You're fired. Oh, no. What are we gonna do with the stick-in-the-mud? Wait. I think we can have some fun with it. What happened to Craig and Marie? Oh, they flew right out of here. It scared the hell out of them. Leo, we need to find Prue. Good, Phoebe, focus on that. It'll help you resist the evil. The only thing we're resisting is the desire to rip you to pieces and have you for lunch. But if you help us find Prue, we'll leave you alone... ...for the moment. Oh, Leo, ignore them. What do they know? They're backing a losing team. They're revoking my assignment. What? They can't do that. You haven't done anything wrong yet. You did. You gave in to evil. You've relinquished your right to a whitelighter. I'm sorry. - Well. - Oh, no. He's gone. - We're free. - Yes. No more obeying the rules, considering the consequences, none of that crap. - Time to find Prue and go for broke. - Where are you going? Well, I can't wreak havoc dressed like this. - Phoebe. - Cole. - You're okay. - Yeah. Barely. - Any demons spot you? - Just one. - Oh, no. - No worries. He won't be telling anybody anything. The big, bad Belthazor strikes again. Not anything I'm proud of. Why not? You should be. Phoebe, if what I found out is true, Prue's in serious trouble. She's been forced to marry a warlock. Figures that bitch would steal Piper's thunder. You don't understand. A high-level priestess named Dantalian is rumoured to have married them. And she's got the power to turn Prue evil, and turn you evil too. That's what's happening here. So? Isn't that the way you want me? No. That is not how I want you to be. It's not how I want us to be. Our only chance is if we're both... ...good. Love is love. There's no such thing as evil love. It's just gratification, lust. You know what, Cole? Your human half is kind of preachy. I think I want Belthazor back. He's not coming back. Oh, no? I want Belthazor! That's more like it. Phoebe, what are you doing? Dantalian is coming for your book. You better be ready. - What's going on in here? - Nothing, unfortunately. - I heard voices. - Oh, did you? I had a premonition. Must've gotten pretty loud. I guess. We gotta go. The high priestess that has Prue, supposedly she's coming here. High pr...? Must've been a hell of a premonition. It's time. That was easy. Too easy. Where's our sister? I can help you. I can teach you evil. You're new at it. You don't know how to realize its full potential. I don't know, I think we're getting the hang of it. Wanna see? Where's Prue? Kill me, and you'll never see her again. So maybe we should just torture you instead. Why don't you just shatter her hand and see what happens. Last chance. Fine. Now, the really weird thing is we could do that to the other hand. And then go down to your feet... Actually, we could work up piece by piece, all the way to her head. Where is Prue? I just couldn't leave like that, Piper. What's going on? Well, you just helped her to escape. That's what's going on. Smash him. Bastard. Death alone will not suffice, my dear bride. Not anymore. Not after this. Welcome to my hell. So, what are we supposed to do now? I don't know, kill innocents? No, I mean about Prue. How are we supposed to find her without the Book? Shouldn't you be mourning the loss of your beloved Leo? Phoebe, I'm serious. That was one pissed-off priestess, and if she kills Prue, she takes the evil power of three along with her - and we won't stand a chance. - Good point. We have to find Prue. Wait a minute. We're warlocks, right? We should be able to blink wherever we want. But we don't know where to blink to. We don't have to know where. Just to who. To Prue. I mean, isn't that how Leo's orbing power worked? Yeah, but his power was jammed. He couldn't find her. That's because he was good. And we're evil. "Through this book, weave this spell Create the pain of heaven to hell May she suffer..." Are we there yet? - Prue. - Too late. - I've got the Book. - Yeah, well, you know, it takes a while to learn how to use it. Trust us. How about in the meantime, I freeze your head and shatter it? I may not be powerful enough to fight you yet, but they are. - Prue. - Hey, hi. You don't look so good. Oh, but that's a great dress. Zile, Prue, eliminate them. Prue, ignore her. Come on. Come with us. We're your sisters. I'm his wife, not your sister. All right, I'll take that as a no. Okay, we have to figure out a way to get Prue on our side and fast. How about we get her a divorce? Don't wanna shatter the wrong sister, now, do you? - I love you. - You too. Welcome to planet Narcissus. Wait a minute. Cole said that evil can't love. - Cole? - Never mind. The point is, she didn't say, "I love you too." She's the warlock. Freeze her! I'll shatter her. - Hurry. - No! Zile! What's going on? I think we're back. All of us. The Book is back too. Let's go do something good with it. Powers of light, magic of right Cast this blight into forever's night Well, that was the wedding from hell. Although I guess I was the first to get married, after all. - Oh, no. Leo. - What? We killed him. Oh, Leo. Thank God you're okay. Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did. Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done. I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them. Unfortunately, they will. But I doubt they'll believe what happened. And unfortunately, you will. Oh, yeah. Leo, sorry we killed you. It's okay, Phoebe. It wasn't the real you. Or you, Piper. Wasn't it? I mean, on some level, it was me. I felt it. They didn't just plant evil inside of me... ...or us for that matter. There had to be something there for them to turn to begin with. That doesn't make you evil, Prue. You have to choose to be evil voluntarily. Well, I gotta admit it. - It was kind of fun. - Phoebe. Well, it was fun for a while. I mean, to be able to do whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted with no consequences. My fiancé being shattered into a gazillion pieces is a kind of a consequence. Thank you. Still, I kind of understand what Phoebe's saying. Wait, you do? Am I detecting a thaw in our rift? All I'm saying is if evil weren't enticing, why would there be any? I mean, you know, to pretend that we're never attracted to it is... It's like pretending that it just doesn't exist. Something tells me Cole's name is about to be brought up. Look, I definitely do not like the fact that you lied to us about vanquishing him, but I have to admit, after taking a trip down the dark side, I sort of understand it a little bit better. The problem now is that I realize that Justin is just so boring. Well, scratch one name off the wedding guest list. Actually, scratch them all. I cave. Our lives are just way too bizarre to have any sort of normal wedding. I don't know what I was thinking. Phoebe, by the way, you never mentioned where you got that premonition from. - What premonition? - The one that told us about Dantalian. The one that saved our butts. Right. You know, something tells me you wouldn't believe me if I told you anyway. So let's just say I got in touch with my evil side. Something that I will never do again. - How did it go? - Everything's back to normal again. - Good. - Yeah. Good. It's not enough, is it? What I did doesn't change your mind about us, does it? - No. - Why not? - It's too complicated. - Don't give me that. If nothing else, let's at least be honest with each other. We owe that. I love you. And I will always love you. Nothing can change that. It's just... The temptation, it's too much. And I can't take that risk for me or my sisters. Phoebe, I'm telling you, I'm not evil anymore. Maybe not on the surface. And maybe not even in your heart. But somewhere inside of you... ...you'll always be. And you can't ever change that.
