and fairy tales all rolled up into one. Actually, it's ions speeding into the Earth's magnetic field, and then they collide with air molecules. Do you guys think it's weird that the aurora borealis is happening the night before the Wiccan Festival of Lights? I've been so busy planning for the baby, I forgot tomorrow's a sabbat. Yep, it's definitely a time of renewal and growth. Oh, please don't say growth. If this little thing gets any bigger, I'll never be able to snap back. Hey, is that a shiver? I think I detected a shiver. - You should go inside with that shiver. - I'm fine. I'm feeling fine. You didn't look so fine when you were bent over the toilet puking your guts out today. Nausea, headaches, all a normal part of pregnancy. Along with gas, heartburn, a constant need to pee. It sounds fun. Another golden goose. You would think the magical community could find maybe something else to give to the baby? - No, it's the hot item this year. - Clearly. Yeah, I could definitely melt this down and make a fashionable ring. You are not keeping that. Here, goosie, goosie, goosie! As much as I am enjoying this spectacle, I think we should really send those things back. Dad is in town tomorrow, he wants to stop by for a visit. He does get very Darrin Stephens about our whole magic thing. Yeah, we should maybe have Leo ask the Elders what the policy is on magical gift returns. We don't want a curse put on the family or anything. Yes, good idea. I wonder what the Elders want this late. Well, I don't know, but you go find out. And keep it down when you come back, because I'm gonna head up. - Or maybe down. - Piper. - Piper. - Piper. Leo. What's going on? I don't know. I can't heal her. She won't come to. Okay, to the hospital. Come on. You scared us. Me too. Guess I'm not so invincible after all. Yeah, maybe we need to start taking better care of you. No, it was my fault. Everybody was telling me to slow down. It's not your fault. We're all in uncharted territory. The Elders said that this was a special child, and anything can happen. Let's not forget that. How are you feeling? Tired and weak. Well, I've got your test results here, but I can't find your chart. - When are you due? - Six weeks. And who is your regular doctor? We don't have one. We've sort of been seeing alternative medical practitioners. You don't have an ob-gyn? We're training to be midwives. I'm open to all forms of healing, but a woman in her third trimester should have had ultrasounds and blood work done by now. A medical doctor could have caught your condition earlier. My condition? Toxemia. It's a form of high blood pressure in pregnant women. Do you deal with unusual stress in your life? Very unusual. Is it serious? Toxemia restricts blood flow and food and oxygen to the placenta. It can result in a small baby, a premature delivery, or it can lead to other complications, none of which you need to worry about now. Most women respond quickly to the treatment. Okay, so give me the treatment. The treatment involves a no-salt diet, no stress, and lots of bed rest. Do that and the symptoms should reverse. I'll be back later to check on you. Well, that's probably why I couldn't heal you. High blood pressure isn't just physical, it's a state of mind. No stress and bed rest. Do you think you can handle that? Yeah, I can handle that. I'll do anything. So will we. Oh, I have waited a lifetime for this. The aurora borealis is a rare sight indeed, sir. It's much more than that. Two centuries ago, when I became an apprentice, I devoted my life to sorcery and the black arts, and do you know why? No, sir. In the hope that an ancient prophecy, which my mentor kept hidden, would one day come to pass. Has it? Look up. The signs are converging. The future of all magic hangs in the balance, and only I know it. - And now I know it too, sir. - Why, yes you do. That's why you're going to help me by attacking the Charmed Ones tomorrow with fireballs. Fireballs? No, no, fireballs are useless against those witches. Well, actually, you'll be lucky to have any fireball power at all if things happen the way I expect them to. Sounds like suicide, sir. Suicide? Sacrifice. It's an opportunity of a lifetime to have power over good forever. This is a kind of mission that turns demons into legends. Your name will go down in infamy. - Really? - Yes. - What's your name again? - Stanley. Stanley. Stanley, it all starts with you. Attack the witches. Go down fighting. Secure your legacy. I'll do my best, sir. Greetings from the Dead Sea. What did you eat over there? It's not me, it's the sulphur in the mud. It has healing properties. You know, people come from all over the world just to get this stuff. Yeah, well, we want Piper to feel like she's in a spa, not some sewer. I guess you're right. I just wanted the best for her. I know, sweetie. We're gonna take good care of her and the baby, I promise. - Hello? - There she is. Welcome home, honey. Or should I say, "Your Highness"? Because from now on, we are your loyal subjects. We even turned your bedroom into a royal throne room. Let me take you there now, my queen. All right, knock it off, before I cut your heads off. - I don't want any special treatment. - Piper, we love you. Let us love you. Yeah, I mean, as your sisters, and your midwives, we feel it's our duty to provide you with solitude and serenity and... A gaggle of geese. I thought you were gonna get rid of those. You said you were gonna ask the Elders on magical gift-return policies. Okay, you guys, it's fine. Everything is fine. It's not gonna bother me. I'm not gonna let anything bother me, for the sake of my daughter. - Okay. - All right, come on. I'll take you upstairs. I thought you said you tied them up. I did, but the little flockers got loose. Okay, we have to do better than this for Piper. I mean, if we can't keep geese away from her, how are we supposed to protect her from demons? Okay, you're right, you're right. We should take turns guarding the manor. You know, who knows what kind of weirdo stuff's gonna show up here. Oh, my goodness, it's a unicorn. Yes, it is. In our kitchen. Is that another baby present? You think, maybe? Yeah, the best one ever. Okay, Paige, while unicorns may be very magical and cool, I'm not so sure it's appropriate for a baby. Oh, come on now. Our little niece will grow into it. I'm not so sure about that. Have you seen those hooves? And how are we gonna baby-proof that horn? Hey, look, there's a card. "From: EI." EI? Do we know anybody in Spain? Paige, I don't care who it's from, okay? It just can't be here now. It's way too much stress for Piper and the baby, okay? So just orb it out of here. I can't. Unicorns are mythical beasts from another world. Where do you propose I orb it to? I don't care where you orb it to, just get it out of here, okay? Fine, I'll orb it somewhere safe and tie it up until we figure it out. - What was that? - I can't orb it. Okay, stand back. Take this beast BeFore I end her</i> Ship her back Return to sender</i> Wait, why aren't my powers working? Apple. - Nothing. - Oh, no. I can't levitate. I'm grounded. - Something's wrong. I can't orb. - Yeah, yeah. I was trying to go find out how to get rid of the geese... And why is there a unicorn in the kitchen? Forget the unicorn. Our magic's down too. - It is? - Okay, whatever hit us, we have to assume also hit Piper, okay? And she can't find out about this until we know what's going on, because... - Hello? Where is everybody? - Why is she out of bed? - I don't know. - Go put her back. Go, go. All right, Paige, you take the magical farm animals and put them down in the basement. I'm gonna get the Book, and I'll meet you down there.</i> All right, you're Spanish. Why are you on your feet? I was coming down to get some food. A person could starve around here. Hi. Bye. All right, well, come on upstairs. I'll get your food. You're supposed to be on bed rest. Okay, well, "bed rest" doesn't actually mean... Yes, it does. The doctor said, "Stay off your feet and relax." Here, Mr. Unicorn. Relax. Everybody keeps telling me to relax. Like it's something you do. Like switching off a light. You need to learn how to do it, Piper, if you're gonna get your blood pressure under control. My blood pressure would not be a problem if we had been seeing a doctor like we were supposed to. I knew that was coming. Come on, sit down. Don't treat me like a baby factory. I can sit myself down. All these fears about a magical baby, and "don't let the doctors find out," and "we'll buy a birthing ball," and "Paige and Phoebe will be midwives." And you know what? We were wrong. How can you say that? Because, somehow, in the middle of all this, we forgot the most important thing of all: What's best for the baby. Well, that's not fair. A lot of people decide to have babies at home. Maybe so, but I was not one of them. And this baby is not even out of the womb yet, and I'm already screwing up as a mother. - You haven't screwed up. - Yes. I did, Leo. I did. I have a disease that is threatening our baby, and I could have avoided it if I had just trusted my instincts. Well, what are your instincts telling you now? To have this baby in a hospital. Okay. I'll make arrangements today. Oh, really? And what happens when she's delivered in swaddling orbs? We'll deal with it then. From now on, I want you to feel safe and secure, okay? No! No magic, no magic, no mag... It's just too much stress on your body. Like that mess on the floor is not gonna stress me out? Well, I'll clean it up. Hello? Sure. It's one of your charges. Since when do they use the telephone? Since I've been ignoring them to spend more time with my lovely wife. Excuse me. Hello. There you go. Come on, come on. Come on. Okay, look at this. Check this out. The whole Book has been erased. - How is that possible? - I don't know. And without the Book, I don't know how to find out.</i> It's like someone's taken the magic and erased it from our entire family. I think it's bigger than that. Oh, was that from one of our golden geese? Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be able to return them now. What is going on? You know, this all started when el mystery mare arrived. Maybe she's a Trojan unicorn sent to suck away our magic. No, I doubt it. Unicorns are the essence of good magic. If anything, they should enhance our powers, not steal them. What about the sky last night? What, the northern lights on the eve of a sabbat? Yeah, it could be a mystical sign, but don't those normally come in threes? Where's the third? Have you been experiencing uncontrollable emotional mood swings in the last week? Am I that transparent? No, but read your horoscope. Jupiter, Mars and Saturn are all in Gemini. That only happens once every 300 years. Holy Hannah! It's like the universe is practically screaming at us to get our attention. - Yeah, but what is it trying to say? - I don't know. But I got a lot of research books in the attic. I'm gonna go check them out. Okay, I'll meet you up there. I'm gonna try to figure out a way to wrangle the geese. Good luck. Hey, who the hell are you? They call me Stanley. I was afraid of that. At least it's a level playing field. Tonight, Tabitha is going to get her revenge</i> on all oF Harmony. Like that spell would have worked. - What was that? - What? That. Oh, that. That's probably the girls trying to run down the geese. Tricky birds, you know. Listen, I'll go help out. You relax. Hey! My name will haunt you to your grave. - What was his name again? - I don't remember. What's with the leftovers? Well, his magic ran out just like ours. Okay, so we have no powers, demons have no powers. - What is going on here? - I don't know. I got a call from a charge, and her powers are down too. So I unplugged the phone in case we get more calls. I don't want Piper to panic. Well, it's official. Magic's down everywhere. - I thought you tied her up? - I did, she eats through everything. Oh, God, what time is it? That's probably Dad. - I'll get the unicorn. - We got the body. Ready? - Come on, dead guy. - Hello? Anybody home? Let's go. Hello? Somebody get that. Phoebe, Paige, I'd like you to meet Doris. Doris? My new wife, and your new stepmother. Hi. How are you married? We didn't even know you were dating. Or that you date at all, for that matter, Dad. - Well, it happened pretty fast. - Yes, we met on the singles cruise. Oh, that trip to Mexico, that was a singles cruise? - I'm a man of many mysteries. - Clearly. Where's Piper? I want to share the good news. Oh, God, no, that's okay. She's upstairs resting. We found out last night that she has a blood-pressure condition. - She's okay? - Oh, yeah, she's fine, don't worry. At least, don't let her see you worry anyway. Poor thing. Young women today are under so many pressures. Is she eating enough garlic? Because it dilates the blood vessels, you know. Oh, well, we'll have to fix some of that up. Oh, let me take that for you. - We're all out of hangers. - Hey, Dad. Hey, Piper. I heard the news. You shouldn't be on your feet. Dad's got some news of his own. Gently, though, Dad. We don't want her to drop that calf right there on the stairs. Piper, I want you to meet Doris, my new bride. Yeah. - Hello, Piper. - Hi. Hi, Doris. Welcome to the family, I guess. I know it's kind of sudden. But sometimes when life drops a peach at your feet, you gotta stop and make some cobbler. That is always my motto, isn't that funny? Apparently they met on the singles cruise. Did you know Dad goes on singles cruises? Oh, it was like in the movies. Our eyes met across the buffet bar. Your dad is so handsome. And, well, I told him, don't eat the rolls, you know, too much processed flour. Anyway, we stayed up all night long talking, and by the morning, we just knew. She devastates me. Okay, I put away the uni... cycle. - What unicycle? - It's a baby gift. - Hey, Victor. - Leo. Hello, I'm Doris. I'm your new mother-in-law. Oh, hi. I guess I missed a lot, didn't I? Okay, now that we've all met, maybe the two lucky newlyweds should check into the hotel, because it's crazy here, and then we'll call you... Oh, no. We're not going anywhere. - You're not? - No, I volunteered at the hospital. We can stay and help take care of you. You can? I look forward to some real mother-daughter bonding. You do, huh? Well, you know, now that we figured out you're staying here, let's get Piper off her feet, shall we? - You can't leave me alone with her. - Yeah, yeah. We have to, because what if that's another magical baby gift? - Come on, upstairs. - Come on. - Can I help you? - To save magic? I hope so. Okay, sorcerers don't just drop by our house. What makes you think we're not gonna vanquish you? Because you can't. Didn't you get my message? My apprentice was supposed to drop by this morning. Oh, that guy. He's dead in our closet. But he didn't give us a message. Because he was the message. To demonstrate the dire nature of our situation. So you're saying demons don't have power either? Down to the last imp. There's fear and panic everywhere. Demons stuck in the underworld with no way up, others stuck topside with no way down. Oh, poor little evil creatures. Well, I see your flowers haven't died yet. They will, with no gnomes or garden nymphs to spin their delicate magic. Don't go getting all enchanted on us. Oh, don't worry. I hate good magic, fairy tales, wishes on stars, and children who believe in Santa Claus. Mortals don't know it exists, but magic infuses all their hopes and dreams. Stand back. I think he's gonna break out in song. Oh, hardly. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to watch it all ripped from the world. So why not just sit back and watch the show? - Why come to us? - Because I want my power back. Magic must be saved, and it's up to us. Us? We're us. You're them. We don't help thems, sorry. You can't fix this by yourselves. That's why you invited me here to your back yard. But together, together we can interpret the signs. You were right about the signs. Okay, so, what do you propose that we do? A summit between good and evil to discuss the crisis. Of course, there'd be certain rules. No guns, no knives, et cetera. You know, the exit's that way, so if you wanna just: We don't have much time. The longer magic is down, the harder it is to restore. My cell phone's on the back in case your sister changes her mind. Cronyn, huh? When do sorcerers have cell phones? You think that's bad? I got a taxi waiting out front. Call me. I don't trust him. Yeah, but I kind of liked his whole world-without-magic speech. - It was very Capra. - It was pure crappa. I don't wanna help evil. What evil? A sorcerer wants to arrange peace talks for the whole magic crisis. Oh, yeah, and Phoebe's actually considering it. Well, of course I'm considering it. The future of magic is at stake here. Not to mention the future of my niece. And what else do we have right now? No powers, no Book, no Elders.</i> Phoebe's right. Without magic, Piper and the baby are vulnerable. We can't protect them. Okay, fine, but if there's a meeting, we're going in heavy in case it's a trap. Okay, but Cronyn said no weapons. And you trust him? Leo, I'm gonna need some saltpetre and cayenne pepper from the kitchen. - For what? - A homemade arsenal. Phoebe, would you kindly get an aerosol can? Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to lock and load. I knew this gift basket would come in handy. And lucky for you, I am always ready for emergencies. You should have seen our first date. Your father spilled steak sauce all down the front of his shirt. And Doris pulls out a bottle of stain remover from her purse. Of course, I licked it off your chin first. Oh, that's so sweet. Hi, honey. What are you doing? I'm just taking Paige some spices. She's gonna make a homeopathic remedy to help you relax. See you. Homeopathic medicine? You're into homeopathic medicine? I knew I was gonna love this family. This is unbelievable. My first husband passed away a couple of years ago. Heart attack. And the first thing I did when we got home from the cruise is put your father on a low-fat, high-fibre diet. And a monthly colonic. Hi, Phoebe. Come, sit, talk with us, please. Oh, I can't. I have a big meeting at work. - You have hairspray I could borrow? - You have hairspray. Yeah, but mine is non-aerosol, and it's a really big meeting, so I need aerosol for that super-firm hold, you know. - Check my bathroom. - Great. Oh, honey, you know what? There's no cheese knife here. Would you mind going downstairs and getting it? Absolutely, baby doll. Oh, girls, I just wanted to let you know how I feel about your father. I... I just feel so, so lucky. He's... He's the most special man I've ever met. Thank you. That's the sweetest thing you could ever say to us. Well, it's true. You know, he's so... He's so kind, and he's so sensitive, and he's the most exciting lover. Oh, I mean, girlfriends, he can go all night. I'm not kidding. - You hear? Gotta go to that meeting. - Don't leave me. That was Cronyn. He says he'll meet us in an hour. He suggested one of his, you know, dark chambers. I suggested Manny's Pizzeria. Nice. Public venue. Way to go. What is that? - This would be a pipe bomb, dear. - Oh, what...? I was good at chem lab in high school. - How's the candle coming? - Fine. Needs a few minutes to set. - You sure it'll give us smoke? - Total whiteout. As long as you put six parts saltpetre in there. Okay, we have: One flammable spray can, one lotion-bottle bomb, smoking candle, two sharpened nail files, four cayenne pepper-spray straws, and assorted rings and bracelets? Kind of makes you appreciate your powers, doesn't it? We don't need no stinking powers to kick some demon ass. Well, maybe you don't. You're a little better at the mano a mano stuff. Speaking of, I have some extra gifts for you, my dear. Hey. These were mine, and now they'll be yours. Chain-mail top from my club days. Steel-toed boots from my mosh-pit days. Handcuffs from last Friday. Hey, do you think we're making a huge mistake by not telling Piper about this? No, absolutely not. I think she needs to relax. I agree. Piper's not just carrying the next generation Halliwell. She's carrying the next generation of magic. Then let's go save them. Okay, the last question is, "What is your lover's favourite article of clothing?" It has to be your grey cardigan. Am I right? As always, baby doll. Okay, that's 19 out of 20. That makes our romance rating: JalapeÃ±o hot. Hey, somebody get in here. Hi. I may be stuck in bed, but I am not stuck on stupid. I know that something's going on. Well, you wanted a doctor, and she told you to relax, so relax. How can I relax when I know that you're hiding something from me? All the strange noises and weird behaviour. Why don't you just tell me what's going on? Okay. I'm sorry, you guys. We need a moment. A magical moment. All right, then. Okay, well, it's really nothing to worry about. Magic has disappeared from the world, and Phoebe and Paige went to have a summit meeting with evil so they can fix it. See? Nothing to worry about. I see. Okay. I am not gonna get upset about this. I am just gonna blow you to pieces. See, I tried to tell you. Oh, no! Listen, I'm sure it's nothing. - Phoebe and Paige will... - Leo, no. My water just broke. This is Merrill, our highest-ranking wizard and personal mentor. Kane, top advisor to the warlocks. Check their bags for weapons. Like we'd attack in front of civilians. That's why we chose a public place. You can't be too safe, you know. What's with the candle? We thought we'd try a Wiccan ritual or two to try to bring back magic. Let's get down to business. Okay, well, wait a minute, bubs. How do we know you guys aren't packing weapons? - You mean like this? - Hey, now. Did it just get very quiet in here? You don't think we'd pass up the opportunity to take out the Charmed Ones, now, do you? No! How did you do it? This place must have been crawling with customers. We paid them to leave. Of course, the owner wanted to stay, but he's browning in the pizza oven. What about magic? Who's gonna fix it? I got that covered. Which is more than I can say for you two. If you don't think we came prepared for this moment, you are sadly mistaken. We better fight our way out of this or die trying. You ready? Don't let them out alive. What are we doing? Why are we sitting here? We need to go to the hospital. Now. You need to relax. Your water broke. It's no need to panic. No, you are wrong. My due date is six weeks away. This baby is not ready to come out. - Please, take me to the hospital. - Okay. Okay. I just got off the phone with your doctor, and she said don't move until she gets here. - She's coming here? - She's on her way now. There, see? Everything's gonna be okay. I need Phoebe and Paige. They trained so hard for this. They should be here now. I called Phoebe's cell phone. There was no answer. Well, can't you just, you know, pop over there and get them in that special way you do? Kind of got a problem with that right now. Oh, my God! Contraction. Okay, okay, just breathe. That's it. Piper needs all the love and support we can give her right now, Leo. - Go and get her sisters. - Please. You stay by her side and keep her safe. Okay. Okay, it's over. I'm okay. Now, the doctor said I need to keep you warm. So I'm gonna change all the sheets and all these wet blankets, all right? Hey, what if the baby comes before the doctor gets here? Do you know what to do? I know exactly what to do. Alrighty, then. Where's Dad? Oh, he decided to go with Leo. But don't worry, you still have family here. - Where's Cronyn? - He had business to attend to. Yeah, I'll bet. Did Cronyn bring down magic? - He doesn't have the power. - No, but you do. Of course, you're his mentor. What happened to magic? Answer the lady's question. Centuries ago, I unearthed a quatrain from the tomb of a wise apothecary. When three planets burn as one Over a sky oF dancing light</i> And magic will rest on a holy day to welcome a twice-blessed child Those are the signs that we saw. The aurora borealis, the planetary alignment, the Wiccan sabbat. Wait, back to the twice-blessed child business, what is that? - Cronyn is not after us. - He's after Piper's baby. Oh, my God! That's why he led us here to our slaughter, so the power of three couldn't find him. When do we get our powers back? When it's too late to use them. The house line is dead. Magic won't return to the world until the baby is born, which should be any minute. Finally, Leo. - Who are you? - I'm here for your baby. It'd be easier if you'd just relax, Piper. Breathe deeply. And push. She's fully effaced and dilated. It won't be long now. You can't have my baby. I won't... No, no, no. He's not gonna hurt her while she's in labour. Okay, well, what if Leo's hurt, or Dad? There's only one way to save them. A unicorn's horn is pure, concentrated magic. See, I told you all magic wasn't down. Okay, how did you know that? Because the wizard stole the prophecy from an apothecary, an agent of good magic. Wait, that would mean that the Elders knew what he wrote. Look, the card says "From: EI," that's gotta be for "the Elders." They knew magic was gonna go down, and that we'd be in danger. Why didn't they just tell us? They tried. Leo got a call from the Elders, remember? Then Piper passed out, and we had to take her to the hospital. And then they sent us this little present. I guess your magic is not affected by what happens on Earth. - What was that? - The witches? You stay here. Where is my father? What did you do to him? Don't worry about such things. Childbirth is painful enough. If you do anything to my baby, I will kill you. I will hunt you and kill you, even if it means coming back from the dead. And don't think I won't find a way to do that. We are not going to hurt your baby, Piper. We're going to raise her as our own. She's going to be a powerful leader. A great force of evil. You should be proud, very proud. Okay, one vanquish spell. Stupid witch. You could have killed the both of you. She caught me off-guard. Just get down here. Get away from me! Her contractions are less than a minute apart. Oh, God, please not now. Step aside, bitch! Yeah, that's our job. Move, even breathe, and she's dead. - Vanquish him, Phoebe. - Your sister will die. You can still save the baby. Oh, my God. I'm warning you. - Kill him. - How can I? Do it. Phoebe, if you love me you will send this crazy bastard straight to hell. Now! Beast oF legend, myth and lore Give my words the power to soar</i> and kill this evil evermore Is everybody okay? I feel like I'm dying. Oh, baby's coming. Baby's coming. Okay. It's okay. You're okay. Okay, you're doing great, sweetie. Yes, you are. Let's see what we have here. Oh, I see a head of dark hair. - You do? - What'd you expect, a blond? - What did I miss? - A lot! Victor needs help. - Here. Take this. - Okay, okay. Okay, breathe. Keep breathing, keep breathing. - It's okay. - Breathe. Don't forget to breathe. Very good. Okay, relax. Relax, you're okay. - Dad. - Yeah, honey? I'm sorry about your demon wife. Oh, hush, don't think about that. - I'm right here, baby. - It's okay. You okay? You're all right. Okay. You're doing great. You're doing great. - Push, okay? Last push. - I can't. - You have to. Big one, big one! Push. - You can do it. - I can't! - You can. You can. - Yes, you can. - Okay, push. Push. Push. Come on. Push. Oh, I guess magic is coming back. - Here we go. Here we go. - That's it, baby. I see a shoulder. - And another shoulder. - Push. Push! An arm. And another arm. Oh, it's something else, something else. Hi, baby. Hi. You're okay. You're okay. Look. Is that what I think it is? If you're referring to Mr. Winkie between the legs, yes. - It's a boy. - You mean I get a boy? Here you go, Mama. Hi. Hi, little guy, what are you doing? Look what we did. I see. It's a miracle. A little miracle. He's beautiful. Oh, you are safe,
