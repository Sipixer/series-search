We're gonna borrow your kid. We need him just for a day. If you're smart, you won't call the cops. We'll have him home safe and sound Monday morning, ready for school. Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah. - Just our little secret, right? Yeah. Dad! Dad! Can I just say I am actually enjoying this? Because you're not doing anything. Not true. I have painted my fingers and my toes. I just hope that this doesn't fall under the personal gain category. How could it? A good witch is a clean witch. Yep, I think we should spring clean like this more often. You go, girl! Good job, Prue. Oh, look, more toys. I told you Grams wouldn't throw them away. Yeah, but we will. Why don't you put that stuff in the discard pile. - Wait, what's in there? - Stuffed animals without eyeballs. Dollies that look like they've been through the mill once or twice. And lookie here, Miss Phoebe's diaries. The place where I kept all my secrets. Give me those. - What? - The place you kept your secrets? Phoebe, you could never keep a secret. Oh, that is so not true. Okay, maybe Prue's surprise birthday party. Guess again. You knew? Phoebe, you swore you wouldn't tell her. I'm sorry, okay? It was an accident. - I say we keep all the toys. - Subject changer. For our children, for our future. - That's a good idea. - Well, you can get rid of mine. What? It's just that, you know, we live in a world with so much violence, and then you add the evil demons, and it's a pretty scary place to raise kids in. Besides, I don't really think I'm cut out to be a mom. How can you say that? Why don't we have this conversation later? Like, say, in five years? Good. I think dinner's burning. Phoebe, lend me a hand. Don't look at my diary. You try anything, you're dead, and so is your old man. - You got that, kid? - Come on, ease up on him, Mickey. Kid's not stupid. Are you, Max? You're gonna do just like we tell you, and everything's gonna be fine, right? Yeah, you better be right about him, or me and you got problems. Look, that kid is a living, breathing, winning lotto ticket. All I know is my kid brother said somehow, like magic, he turned off the arcade alarm system from across the street and got them inside. I don't believe in magic. So we test him out. If we don't like what we see, we cut our losses. Piper, Phoebe, get in here. What is it? Oh, no, not again. What's it saying? Help Max. So maybe Max is a ghost. I mean, after all, that is a spirit board. A ghost who needs our help? I don't think so. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. What if it's just someone in trouble crying out? Well, it would have to be someone with powers. That's not exactly AT&T. "Help Max." That's not a lot to go on. Yeah, there's nothing really you can do unless he sends another message. What, are you on hold or something? It's Harry, the new chef at Quake. He threw out all my Henckel knives. Apparently, he prefers Forschners. - You follow any of that? - No. Look, we wouldn't have gotten the message if it wasn't important. - Okay, so, what do you wanna do? - Maybe go see Andy. See if he knows anything about a Max needing help. Can you say "long shot"? All right, you're obsessed. I accept that. I'll thumb through the Book of Shadows,</i> see if there's anything on spirit board SOSs. - Okay, and maybe Piper can... - Look, wait, I'm the manager. If I say I want Henckels, then I want... Hello? The jerk hung up on me. Okay, how can I help you two? I think we got it under control. Okay, then I'm going to Quake before Harry does any more damage. Ding-dong. Leo, you're back. Come in. It's so good to see you. How are you? Better now. - How are you, Piper? - I'm better now too. - Leo! - Hey, stranger, good to see you. - Yeah, what brings you back? - Phoebe. You know, the chandelier in the living room keeps flickering. - Yeah? Well, I'll get my tools. - Oh, no, no, take your time. Attic, remember? You have some reading to do. Right. Is that a spirit board? This? Yeah, it is. I'm just taking it to the auction house to have it appraised. So I'll call you if I hear anything. I'll be at the restaurant. - Do you have to go now? - Yeah, sort of. But I'll be back soon. I promise. Can you wait? Sure. So glad you're back. Okay, let me get this straight. You think a guy named Max might be in some kind of trouble, but you have no idea why. You've never met him and really don't have any idea who he is. Is that about right? Okay, fine. See, I had a dream last night. And in my dream, my sisters and I were cleaning the attic when we found this old Ouija-type board. And the pointer started to move until it spelled out, "Help Max." That's it. You know, I hear a lot of stories in my line of work, but yours are always very entertaining. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Sorry... ...nothing on anyone named Max. - Thanks for checking. - Any time. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Harry. Hey, you must be Pippy. Piper. And... You know, your voice doesn't do you justice. You're actually attractive. You cannot come into this restaurant, throw away all of our knives and refuse to make the house specialty... That is not a proper chef's uniform. Will be. I'm a trendsetter. In fact, I decided to change the menu, so I threw out all the old ones. Now, my crab ravioli, there's a specialty. - Straight from Eden. - You threw out all the menus? Hey, complain to your sister Phoebe. She's on line one. You're fired! Oh, attractive and feisty. You can't fire me, because you're just a manager. Unless you'd rather be the executive chef. Take that. Sounds like a real piece of work. He has a nice voice, though. - What's he look like? - A complete and total jerk. - Is Leo around? - Yeah, he's working away. He wants to know when you're gonna get back, though.</i> I think it might be a while. Maybe I should talk to Leo. Sure, hold on a sec. - Oh, my God! - Phoebe! - Let me call you back. - Phoebe, wait, I can explain. - You are a warlock, aren't you? - No. Wait, think about it. If I was a warlock, and I wanted to hurt you, don't you think I would've done it the last time I was here? Okay, good point. But still, most normal handymen use ladders to fix chandeliers. - Are you a witch? - No. Then what are you? These are the blueprints to the microchip plant. The main security panel is in this room here. All you gotta do is switch the system off. Start with zone one, ending up with zone five, okay? - You got it? - I can't. My mom made me promise never to use my power for bad things. Yeah, you ever read the book When Bad Things Happen to Good People?</i> Look, I got it, Mickey. You broke into the arcade, right? This isn't any different, man. I mean, we're not even gonna take anything. We just wanna see if you can actually do it. Look, I'm really sorry about what happened to your mom, okay? It's a tough break, but you wanna make sure something doesn't happen to your dad, don't you? Well, I'll be damned. I don't know how you did that, but I gotta say, I'm very impressed. Hey! No! I really don't know what to say. I mean, up until today, I thought you were a handyman. Now I find out that you're a... - Whitelighter. - A whitelighter. - What exactly is a whitelighter? - We're really just messengers, guides. Think of us as guardian angels for good witches. Your tea's cold. Well, you are handy. So all this time, you knew who we really were? I was sent here to watch over you and your sisters when you got your powers. You know, help out wherever I could. - Sent by who? - "Whom." They're a group of elder whitelighters. They're known as the Founders. You were never supposed to find out. I screwed up and got caught. So, what, you're here again to help us out with something else? Actually, I'm here to help a boy named Max. - Max? Wait, that's... - The spirit board. I know. See, Max is a budding good witch, new to the powers, but he's very young and vulnerable. And he's in serious trouble. Someone wants to take advantage of his gift. - So why don't you help him? - I did. I made sure that Prue received his cry for help. That's why I was sent here. That's all I'm supposed to do. The rest is up to Prue. Yeah, but Prue doesn't know anything about him. - She doesn't know he's a little boy. - Well, she will. In the meantime, you must help me keep my secret, or I could get in trouble, okay? Piper and Prue can never know what I really am. Me, keep a secret? Hello, wrong Halliwell. Wait, you have to tell Piper. If I know her, she's gonna think... I know, I know, and that's where I need your help. You see, whitelighters and witches aren't allowed to fall in love. It's like humans and angels aren't. But I did. I fell in love with Piper. And I know how much she cares about you. It isn't fair to keep her in the dark. But I have to keep this secret, so somehow I have to tell Piper that I can never see her again, and I can't tell her why. You don't need my help, Leo. You need a miracle. - Got a minute? - Sure. Why don't you just sit there. That's perfect. So, what's up? I've got some interesting information about a boy named Max. - A boy? - Named Max, yes. - Whoa. - It's curious, huh? Very. Earlier today, a microchip plant was broken into, but nothing was taken. Stranger still, the alarms on the inside were turned off before the front door was opened on the outside. So, what does this have to do with this boy, Max? Well, security cameras picked up a car in the parking lot with a boy in the back seat... ...matching this photo taken at an arcade last week, where a couple of kids snuck in in much the same way. Same boy, Max Franklin. Do you know who was in the front seat? Just that they shot and wounded a security guard at the scene. This boy's in serious trouble, Prue. This is not a dream. I need to know what you know about this. Well, I mean, why would I know anything? I think that you need to talk to his family. I did. His father. He pretended not to know anything either. Told me the boy was out of state visiting grandparents, will be back tomorrow. But something's wrong. He wanted to tell me something, but he was scared. He was afraid to say anything. What are you writing? Nothing. I'm just doodling. You're not gonna tell me anything, are you? One day, I'm gonna figure out your secret, Prue. Count on it. Telephone. - Hello? - Hey. Look, Max is a boy, Piper, - and he's been kidnapped. - What? Yeah, I got another message on the spirit board. I have to help. I think we should call the police. Andy's already been here, and I think I have an idea of what to do. Okay, so you've got everything under control? No, everything's not under control. I need crab for my ravioli because someone threw it away, and I just got five more orders, Pepper. - Mr Franklin? - Yes? My name's Prue Halliwell. I need to talk to you about your son. Sorry, you have to leave, okay? Look, I know that he's been kidnapped, I know that he's in trouble. I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do. What I don't understand is why you won't talk to the police. Please, you gotta leave, all right? Thank you. Unless you can't talk to the police. The kidnappers won't let you. That's why you wouldn't say anything to Trudeau. Look, I don't know who you are, but I'm begging you... - I can help. - No, no... ...you can't, all right? Goodbye. Mr Franklin. Dear God. Thank you. Hi, I know you guys have been waiting a long time. Hey, have you heard from Prue? Yeah. She's got everything under control. I'll be right back. It's actually good we have a few more minutes. We could go over your plan. You know, what you're gonna tell Piper. Oh, well... ...I thought I'd tell her that... ...you know, as much as I love her, and as much as I'd like to stay in San Francisco, I can't. And I don't know how long my work will keep me away. No, no, what you just said to her was, as much as you'd love to stay and have sex with her, you've got a wife and kids in another part of the country. Try again. Piper... ...you know how much you mean to me, and more than anything, I wish things could work out, but they can't, and no one is more sorry than me. Translation: "I've found someone I like even better." - I'm completely confused. - Look, Leo it's not that complicated. Okay, just avoid the following: "We can still hang out." "I don't deserve you yet." "I need more 'me' time before we can have 'we' time." And my personal favourite: "It's not you, it's me." Whatever you do, don't start off the conversation with, "We need to talk." Other than that, you'll do fine. Then they hit me, and I passed out. I've been out-of-my-mind crazy ever since last night. Should I go to the police? Should I do what they say? They promised to bring him back, but after what the police say happened this morning... I don't even know if he's all right. No, I know that Max is okay right now. If he wasn't, he couldn't have sent me that last message. So I take it you're a witch too, huh? Is that what your son says he is? What Paulette, my wife, said he is. It's what she was. You know, it would have been a hell of a lot easier to handle her family secret had it been revealed a lot sooner. Maybe she was afraid of how you'd react. Maybe she was afraid that you might not accept her or love her. Speaking from personal experience? Yes, I am. Yeah, Paulette, she had to tell me. She was running out of time. She passed away three months ago. Then suddenly, Max, he starts having these powers. I don't have a clue what to tell him, what it all means. Then he uses it and nearly gets busted at an arcade, and now this. - I'm sure that Max... - Do you have any children? No, but... Then you couldn't possibly understand what I'm feeling. Still, I'm sorry... ...about what happened to Max and your wife, but if you could just find a way to forgive her... Forgive her. She should've told me. Maybe if she had I would have been better able to protect Max. Do you know anybody who owns an auto shop of any kind? Why? I think your son was trying to send me a clue. No, I... Although, I think Max's friend Danny... His brother works at one over in Oakland. Is Danny the friend that broke into the arcade with Max? Got an address? - Max? - Who's there? My name is Prue. I'm here to take you home. - But how'd you find me? - I had a chat with your friend Danny. Look, your dad, he's waiting for you. - You know my dad? - Yeah. Hey, who the hell are you? - Come on, we need to hurry. - You have powers? Yeah, I'll explain them to you in the car. I can't leave. They'll kill my dad if I do. Nap time's over. Wake up. I got a little surprise for you. - Max, are you okay? - He's fine. - Look, don't worry. - I said, he's fine. Now, before you go trying to pull any of that magical hocus-pocus crap again, I wanna show you something. - What is it? - All that matters is what happens when I flip that little switch. Now, I flip that little switch, and Max here takes a nap, a long one. - Mickey, why don't...? - Shut up. Plastic explosive. Little trick I picked up in Corcoran. Prison system's very educational. Mickey, he's just a child. He's already proven he's not going anywhere. If you're gonna wire anyone, wire me. What is it with you? What are you, magicians? Freaks of nature? Aliens? What? Witches. - You okay? - I'm scared. I know. Just do as they say, and everything will be fine. They need you, remember? I'm sorry I got you into this. I'm sorry I have these stupid powers. No, Max. Don't ever be sorry about that. It's a gift. It's like being a musician or an athlete. It's a pain. I'm a freak. My dad hates it too. He hates me. No, he doesn't. He just doesn't understand it, that's all. It's new to him too. Don't worry, Max. I won't let anything happen to you. I promise. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. You really think it's necessary, wiring the kid like that? You saw what that chick did. Pretty cool, actually. It might come in handy tonight. It's the only reason she's still breathing. Sorry, small mutiny in the kitchen. Where were we? Piper, there's something I need to tell you. - Yeah? - Look, forgive me, but I could be summoned at any moment, so I have to tell you this now. I can't... I can't... I can't believe how much I missed you. Well, Leo, I missed you too, but what do you mean, summoned? - Summoned where? - Hey, Piper. No respect, I can live with, okay, but where the hell's my coriander? Okay, that's it, I'm ending this now. Oh, my gosh. You know. Of course I know. The whole restaurant knows. Didn't you hear him scream across the room? - I thought it was a secret. - Phoebe... It'll probably be in the newspaper. No, it can't be. Look, Piper, he never meant to hurt you. Phoebe, please. You haven't even met the maniac yet. What's gotten into you? She's talking about the new chef. Oh, right. So does that mean she took your news well? That means she doesn't know. I can't tell her, Phoebe. I can't stand to think about it, much less talk about it. Here's something else you might not wanna think about. Piper said that Prue had everything under control. Well, I can't find her. Say hello to Mickey Jackson. Security cameras digitally enhanced for your viewing pleasure. But Jackson's a convicted bank robber. Why is he breaking into a microchip plant? And stealing squat. Good question. A better one would be how he broke into the plant in the first place. High tech's not exactly his style. Unless this was just a dry run. Maybe Mickey's looking to do bigger and better things. Like another bank? Like a big bank. It's a leap, I know. Agreed, but why the kid? How's he fit into this? - Trudeau. - Hey, Andy, it's Phoebe.</i> Have you seen Prue since this morning? No, as a matter of fact, I was about to ask you the same question. - Really? Why? - Because I think she knows something about a boy named Max. Do you? Yeah, oh... Oh, that's my call waiting. I gotta go. Could be Prue. Bye. Anything? No, I can't reach either Max or Prue telepathically. Does that mean they're in trouble? Who's in trouble? Oh, the 49ers. No secondary. They need a really good draft pick next year. Well, I'm gonna go into the kitchen and see if I can get in touch with Prue. Carry on. Alone, finally. Don't have to worry about any more interruptions from Harry. He quit. Okay, not the enthusiastic response I was hoping for. Look, Piper, I've been searching all day for an easy way to tell you this. Phoebe? Phoebe, I know you're not in the kitchen. That is so weird. I was just on my way back. Is Leo about to tell me he doesn't wanna see me anymore? You'll have to ask him. And that's the problem. I fell in love with you, and I shouldn't have. - You're married? - No. Engaged? I'm involved, but it's not the way you think. The truth is, is that I led you on and made you believe I was coming back. Leo, you are back. Yeah, but I have to leave again now, and it's not because I want to, though. It's because I have to. I'm sorry. That's okay. - It is? - Yeah. I mean, Leo, you're a nice guy, and I like you a lot, but let's face it, you're geographically undesirable. I mean, you said you live really far away, right? Yeah, pretty far. Well, I try never to get involved with guys I can't see regularly, so don't feel bad. I mean, I understand. Really, I do. - So how'd she take it? - Not bad. Oh, excuse me, but I have to go. Leo, where are you going? I have to leave now. So the thing is, once Max shorts out the alarm, we've got three minutes till the guards realize there's a signal interruption. Just make sure the kid knows what he's supposed to do. And keep an eye on that girl. I don't trust her. Has anything like this ever happened to you before? Not exactly like this. - Usually, the demons that I have to... - Demons? Your mom didn't get to tell you much about being a witch, did she? No. I had just found out about my power when she died. You know, my mom died when I was young too. I know how much it hurts. And it doesn't ever really go away. I didn't even know that my power was coming. I've had to figure it out all by myself, which means so can you. - Especially with your dad's help. - He'll never understand. Max, you have to help him understand. You sound just like my mom. Well, I care a lot about you too. I wish you could be my mom right now. So, what is your power anyway? Mom called it psychokinesis. It means I can move things I can't see. All right, remember, just do everything I say, and nobody gets hurt. Let's roll. - Max? - Dad. Hold it. Hold it. Don't shoot. I'm unarmed. Nobody else knows you're here. I found you the same way she did, through your brother. Your brother? - Gordon, they have him wired. - Shut up! - Dad. - It's all right, son. Look, man, I'll give you anything else you want, just let me have my boy, please. All right, David, go put them in the van. Do it. My son. Max? Max? Please, man, let him go. I beg you, please, he's my son. Let him go. I beg you, please... Sorry. Drive. All right, it'll be just like this morning, Max. That's where the alarm panel is. You know the rest. - What are you looking at? - What are you gonna do to my dad? Max, the sooner this is over, the sooner we can get to him. We need to hurry. - Okay. - Out. We got two minutes. All right, you get the cash. I'll watch them. Use your power. I don't want you two getting any ideas. What the hell are you doing? That's the vault! Put it down! Hold it right there! Drop it! Big mistake. Yeah, right back at you. - Come on. - Shouldn't we wait for the cops? - Explain everything? - No, we cannot explain without telling. And you have to protect yourself by protecting your secret. We really need to get back to your dad, okay? Paulette. It's not time to be with your wife, Gordon. It's time to be with your son. But... Raise the boy well. Heed Prue's advice. Dad. You okay? Max. Oh, I'm fine, Max. Thank you, God. Thank you! Thank you! Oh, you're all right. But I saw you get... You're not bleeding. It's a miracle. Thank you. Thank you for protecting my son. I'm just glad it worked out. Raise the boy well. What? There's somewhere we need to go. I'd like you to come with us. Max, I was so busy being angry at your mother for leaving, for not telling me her secret, your secret. It was like a weight on my heart. I hope you both can forgive me. Can you believe that? Dad's old train. I can't believe you. You get mad at me for chasing monsters on my own. Well, I figured that I could handle it when I realized they weren't demons, but I probably should've asked for help. Even though that kills you. And it almost did. Live and learn. Yeah, you didn't even get to say goodbye to Leo. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know. It's weird, I felt like he was holding something back from me. Holding back? What do you mean? Who knows? It just seemed like he wasn't telling me the whole story, like he had some secret he was afraid I couldn't handle. Well, that's his call. Assuming that he had a secret. Might not have. What are you talking about? Okay, okay, you don't have to beat it out of me. Leo is a whitelighter. They're sort of guardian angels for witches. And they're not supposed to get involved with witches, but Leo couldn't help it. He fell in love with you, and that broke all the rules and got him in all sorts of trouble. And even though he'll love you forever, you will probably never see him again. What? Phoebe, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Oh, God. Don't be so silly. - That's me: Silly. - I'm gonna go get some more tea. Yeah, you know, Pheebs, with an imagination like that, you should be writing children's books or something. No, but I didn't... ...even think of that. That's a really good idea, Prue. That stays here. Wait, I thought all of the toys were going to the Salvation Army. Well, like you said, we should save some for our children. Do I sense a hormonal shift here? It's no big deal. I've just had some time to think. Yeah, in all that spare time of yours? And I realize that I do want kids.
