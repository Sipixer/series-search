Bring back the power of three Power of the witches, rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Blood to blood, I summon thee Blood to blood, return to me Piper? Prue? Sweetie, it's 4:00 in the morning. What are you doing? You're bleeding. I don't understand why magic can't fix this. Why it can't bring Prue back. It's not like we haven't cheated death before. I don't understand why this time is any different. Because Leo can't heal the dead, Piper. You know that. There's other magic, magic that we've used before: Scrying, calling a lost witch, reversing time... Like, the Book just deserted us, and deserted Prue. And I don't understand why. We lost our sister. How can we ever understand that? We have tried every magical way to bring her back. But we can't. She's gone. I just... I thank God that I didn't lose you too. We have to get some rest. Prue will never forgive us if we look bad at her funeral. Social Services, can I help you? Printing. South Bay Social Services, may I help you? Paige, you find that study yet? - Paige, did you hear me? - Yeah, it's in the printer. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - What do you mean, go? Go where? Paige! Hey, Paige! - Can I get you anything? - Oh, no, thanks, sweetie. Look who's back. Cole. I was afraid you weren't gonna make it to the funeral. Well, l... I can't make it. Or shouldn't, anyway. The Source has every demonic bounty hunter looking for me. Yeah, so, what else is new? This is different. Saving you makes it different. It makes me a traitor. He's not gonna stop until he finds me. I don't want that happening at Prue's funeral. - So we'll protect you. - You can't protect me. Why not? We're still witches, aren't we? Yeah, but you're not the Charmed Ones anymore. He's right. Without the power of three-- I don't understand. Isn't it harder to track a demon in a cemetery, Cole? You have to go. I need you there. Hey. How are you holding up? Okay. - It's sweet of you to stop by. - Had to. Besides, you should know they're assigning Prue's case - to another inspector. - What case? "What case?" Are you kidding? Prue and a prominent doctor were killed here, Leo. Made a lot of press. People want answers. Important people. So, what's this guy gonna find, that it was some kind of demonic hit man? - Give me a break. - He might. Look, you don't know him like I do. He'll keep looking until he finds something. - Believe me. - I'm not worried. Well, I am. I saw what happened when they were exposed as witches. Time may have reversed itself, but it still cost Prue her life. Would you people mind? For God's sake, we're burying my daughter today. Can't this wait? Piper? Honey... ...we have to go. I don't wanna go. Why not? Because if I go, that'll mean that Prue's really not coming back. And I don't think I can handle that. We can handle it together. She's been there my whole life. I've always had a big sister. And I don't know how to live without one. Piper. Why didn't you save her? - I tried. - But you didn't. Why didn't they let you save her too? The Elders? They couldn't. They don't have that kind of power. Then what the hell good are they? It's okay to be angry. I'm not angry. I am pissed off. Don't you understand? You healed the wrong sister. You saved me because I'm your damn wife, and you should have saved her because she was the best, because she... You should... Why did they put us through so much for it to end this way? May I be seen? - Have you found Belthazor? - No, something else. Something more important, perhaps. Nothing is more important. Not even the Charmed Ones? - The Charmed Ones are dead. - Not all of them. One gone ends the threat. Of course, if you had foreseen that a whitelighter was going to help Belthazor save his witch, they'd all be gone. Be grateful I don't turn you into a snake. Yes, but then how would you see into the future without me? Without the Charmed Ones to worry about anymore, I may not need to. Well, in that case, you better keep me around a little while longer. What do you see? I see... ...a witch's call on the spirit winds. I see... ...another. "--that which belongs to fellowship and love, that which belongs to the circle remains with us. The wheel turns. As life is a day, so our sister has passed into night. Nothing is final. And we who remain behind know that one day we will once again share the bread and wine with our sister." Oh, blessed spirit, we bid you farewell, for you await a new destiny. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. How did you know Prue? - From work? - No, just... Just from around. You know. Have we met somewhere? No, I don't-- I don't think so. Anyway, my condolences. Thank you. - Phoebe? - Phoebe. - Are you all right? - I saw him. - The demon that killed Prue. - Shax? - What was he doing? - He was killing that girl. - What girl? - The one I was just talking to. We gotta go find her. Go, go! Stop it. Stop it, stop it, stop it, damn it! This is Prue's funeral, for God sakes! Can we at least bury her in peace? Is that too much to ask? Thank you. - I don't see her anywhere. - Who? The girl from my premonition. Phoebe, - you need to be more careful. - I'm sorry. Are you sure you don't recognize her from anywhere? Well, she did look familiar, like I've seen her somewhere before. But somehow we have to find her before night falls, - or else-- - Honey, what are you doing? - I'm cleaning. - You don't clean. You hate cleaning. I know, but it's better than falling apart, isn't it? Maybe you should just try and focus on the girl. She was attacked on a rooftop? Yeah, one with a helipad. But it wasn't a tall building, although there were a lot of taller buildings around it. Okay, so we just need to figure out which building it was - before Shax does. - And do what exactly? You can't defeat Shax, not without the power of three. Well, you and Prue did. That's because Prue was the strongest. Trying to do it without her would be suicide. Yeah, but-- Maybe so, but I got that premonition for a reason, Piper. That girl is our innocent, so we have to try and save her. Says who? Why do we have to? - Piper. - What? Do you really expect us to keep doing this stuff after what happened? To keep risking our lives? Do they? - Piper, keep your voice down. - No, Leo, I won't. I don't wanna do this anymore, okay? It's-- It's over. You can tell them we buried their precious Charmed Ones when we buried our sister. No, leave her be. She needs to be alone. Look, I don't know where we go from here. But I do know that I can't let that girl die. Especially not by the same demon that killed Prue. The question still remains: How are you gonna stop Shax without the power of three to say the vanquishing spell? I'm hoping that a demon and a witch fighting together might be enough. Interested? Why not? Beats sitting around here waiting for the next bounty hunter to attack. I appreciate you coming over. It means so much to the girls. Dad? Excuse us, Aaron. - We have to go. Will you be okay? - Go where? Trust me, you don't wanna know. Phoebe, Victor? Sorry about this, but lnspector Cortez insisted on meeting today. I just wanted to extend my deepest sympathies. - Thank you. - Thanks. I'll get the car. - Where's Piper? - Upstairs. - She's not feeling well. - Understandable. I lost a sister once myself. I know how hard it is. We're gonna find the monster who did this to your sister, Miss Halliwell. I promise you this. Something I said? No. Just the word "monster." Well, that's what he was. How else do you describe somebody so vicious? We gotta stop him before he strikes again. I couldn't agree more. If you'll excuse me, inspector. I know what a difficult time this is for you and your sister, Miss Halliwell, - but we really need to talk. - But not now. Of course. Sorry. I am a witch, damn it. I've summoned people before, and I'm going to summon Prue whether you like it or not. No more playing games, no more being the good witch. I want to talk to my sister. I need to talk to my sister. At the very least, you owe me that. Hear these words, hear my cry Spirit from the other side Come to me, I summon thee Cross now the great divide - Grams. - Hello, my darling. How are you? How am l? Are you kidding? Do you guys not get the news up there? - I meant, how are you holding up? - Not very well. I'm a little lost. Why didn't you come before when I called after--? I couldn't, Piper. I was busy. You were busy? I was with Prue. Of course you were. Right. Well, that would make sense. Is she okay? Your mother and l are helping her through this. But how is she? I'm not allowed to tell you now, just like you're not allowed to see her, at least not for a while anyway. Why? Because seeing Prue right now, speaking to her, keeps her alive for you, which keeps you from being able to move on with your life, to continue your destiny. What destiny? Okay, it's over, it's done. Prue is gone, and l... I know, sweetie, I know. But if there's one thing you've learned over the last three years it's that there's always a reason for everything. Which means there's a reason for this too. Your destiny still awaits. Blessed be. Anything? Unfortunately, since the last attack, Belthazor has been very elusive. Leave Belthazor to the bounty hunters. What about the other? Her future's becoming much more clear. And it appears... ...short-lived. Wasn't that good? That was good, huh? - You all right? - Me? Yeah. Why? Well, you just seem a little quieter than usual, that's all. What makes you think I'm not like this all the time? Well, we've been dating for a month now, so I think I'd know. - Hey, can we get a couple longnecks? - Sure. Make mine a mineral water, please. Thanks. So much for how well you know me, cowboy. I don't drink. I used to have kind of a problem with certain liquids. Lots of problems, actually, but that's all behind me. - Do you want to go someplace else? - No. No, no, no. I like it here. Gosh, I should, I've been coming to P3 for the last year or so, on and off, I mean, ever since-- Ever since what? Oh, no, never mind. It's boring. All right, but if I tell you all about Paige and you use it against me, I will get out my voodoo doll and make you sorry you're a man. So my sad story is that I'm adopted, only it's not so sad, because I loved my parents. God rest. So after they died, I went searching for my birth mother, hoping to get some answers. I went to the police station, found the church where I was dumped at. I checked around. I figured she must have lived near there, you know? Even thought I might have been... ...related to the Halliwell sisters for a minute, but their mom died a long time ago, so I gave up on that. Well, did you ever try to meet the sisters, ask them about it, or...? Yeah, right. "Hi, I think your mom abandoned me at birth. What's for dinner?" No, I don't think so. - Here you are. - Thanks. You're welcome. So that... That still doesn't explain why you keep coming here. Well, one of the sisters owns it, so... I don't know, I guess I just kind of feel connected somehow. That's why I went to the funeral today. I just kind of felt like I had to. Okay, I sound certifiably insane now. Good job, Paige, way to go. Don't hurt me, okay? I can't handle any more right now. Come on. I have something to show you. Here. Thanks. I think this is the right place, but maybe we should try one of the other rooftops just to make sure. Or maybe we should follow your first instincts and stay right here. Okay, but what if I'm wrong? That girl will get killed. You can't save every innocent, Phoebe. Or stop every demon. Yeah. Well, I have to stop this one. I just hope that by me saying the vanquishing spell, it wounds him enough that you can take him out. I got a better idea. How about you and me go someplace. You know, drop off the face of the earth. Disappear. Don't tempt me. Things have changed, Phoebe. We can't pretend we can go on like this. It's only a matter of time before The Source finds me, which means every minute you're with me, you're in danger. I've lost too much already, Cole. I'm not losing you too. Looks like your instincts were right. - We gotta shimmer over there. - And tell her what? That a demon's about to attack? I think we should stay right here. Aren't you afraid that we're gonna get caught? I like an element of danger. Oh, look at the stars. They're so beautiful. They make me feel free. All right. Any ideas? A couple. I mean about what we do now. I mean, we can't just keep watching. It's just not right. You're right. We shouldn't just keep watching. Okay, very good. Shane! She orbed. She orbed. Did you just see that? Come on. - What the hell? - Get out of here. Hurry, go! Go! Say the spell, damn it! Evil wind that blows That which forms below No longer may you dwell Death takes you with this spell Cole! - That was too close. - It's okay, I'm all right. It's your innocent I'm worried about. Are you sure she orbed? Are you sure it wasn't something else? Leo, she disappeared. Bright white shiny thingies came, and then she reappeared. What else could it be? - It just doesn't make any sense. - Why not? Why would Shax want to kill a whitelighter? Maybe he doesn't know she is one. Right, The Source sends out his personal assassin, but doesn't know who he's after? Is it possible that she didn't know she's a whitelighter? No, why? Because she acted as if she didn't. She acted just as surprised - as we were when she orbed out. - That doesn't make any sense either. Okay, why don't you go up and ask the Elders what does make sense so we don't go risking our lives again. I'll be right back. Maybe I should go to the other side and see what I can find out. - No. - I'll be careful. Nobody will see me. Besides, it could be good for me to go back down, confuse any bounty hunters that might be trying to track me. Don't worry. I won't disappear on you. Hey, you okay? Yeah, sure, why not? We could have another funeral tomorrow. I mean, all the dishes are out, and we pretty much know who to invite. Piper. Just tell me one thing. Are you insane, or are you just plain stupid? We buried Prue this morning, and you go off tonight and nearly join her. - What the hell is the matter with you? - I was trying to save an innocent. No. You were trying to get yourself killed, which is what this family does best, is get killed. Isn't it obvious by now that our only destiny is to die? And you are making it way too easy for them, Phoebe. You are just walking right into it. I am so sorry. I cannot handle anything right now, and I certainly cannot handle losing another sister. - Paige. - Hey. What happened? Shane, I feel so bad. I just got scared and I ran. - Well, of course. - Are you all right? What did they say? It's no big deal, just a little concussion. - Oh, no. - No, I'm gonna be fine. They wouldn't be releasing me if I wasn't, right? I'm just glad you're okay too. Yeah, well, physically anyway. Did you talk to the cops yet? - No, why? - Why? They wanna find out who attacked us, that's why. I told them you saw him. - You did what? - Well, you did, didn't you? Did you? - Who are you? - lnspector Cortez, Homicide. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. Wait, Homicide? No one was murdered. Well, based on the m.o., if it's the same perpetrator I think it was, that just makes you lucky. He killed two people last week, violently. One of them a young woman who looked a little bit like you. Prue. Prue Halliwell. Did you know her? No. No, not really. Well, in a way you did, right? What way was that? Were you friends of hers, a friend of her sisters? No, not friends. Then what? Okay, look. I know you know something. I can see it in your eyes. Just like I know they know something too. If you're trying to protect them in any way, I'll find out. Well, in that case, they have nothing to worry about. You rest up. I'll be back. Excuse me. Here, this should help. It's chamomile. I had three cups. Thanks. Doesn't seem real, does it? No. What are we gonna do with all of her stuff? And what are we gonna do with her car? I don't know. Sell it, I guess. - Unless you want it. - No. We're gonna get through this, you know. We just have to stick together. - Well? - Well, they don't know anything about her, so she's definitely not a whitelighter. Then why can she orb, Leo? They can't explain it. Wait a minute. How is it possible that they don't know--? Sorry I took so long. I had to dodge a couple of bounty hunters. - Did you find anything out? - You have no idea what I found out. The Source doesn't think she's a whitelighter at all. In fact, he thinks she might be another... ...Charmed One. That's why he put Shax on it. He thought he ended the power of three. Now he's worried this girl may somehow reconstitute it. No, but that's not possible. Is that possible? - Piper? - Piper? What's going on? I'm going to ask Grams what's going on, actually. Grams? "Your destiny still awaits," she says. "There's a reason for everything," she says. So it's time to summon her transparent butt back here and find out exactly what that reason is. - Okay, Piper, but what makes you--? - Hear these words Hear my cry Spirit from the other side Come to me, I summon thee Cross now the great divide Piper, why are you calling? Phoebe... What's going on? Grams, why does The Source think that the Charmed Ones can be reconstituted? I-- I don't know what you're talking about. You know what, Grams? You were a lousy liar when you were alive, and now as a ghost, you're worse. If you know something, Grams, you have to tell us. We deserve to know. I can't. I'm sworn to secrecy. By who? By me. By me. Mom? You can't just walk in here like this. - Search warrant says I can. - What the hell are you looking for? Do you really expect me to believe you don't know, inspector? Follow me. And keep your voice down. We didn't tell anybody because we were afraid that there would be reprisals, afraid that you girls would be denied your powers, your birthright. It happened after your father and I were divorced, when Sam and I were together. Sam? Her whitelighter. Apples don't fall far from the forbidden tree, I see. Go on. You were both toddlers. You just thought Mommy got a little fat. You never knew I was pregnant. - I was the only one who knew. - And Sam, obviously. Well, yes, of course. We wanted to keep the baby... ...of course, but Mother-- Well l-- I knew it would be disastrous. You know, before you and Leo, Piper, it wasn't just forbidden, it was unthinkable for witches to be with whitelighters, I mean, let alone have children with them. So that's why we had to-- - Why we decided... - Yes. ...to give the baby up. Sam and I took her to a local church as soon as she was born. And we asked the nun there to find a home for her. And she found one, a very, very good home. Yes. Explains why the Elders didn't know about her. All right, hold it. Wait just one minute. Are you telling me that that girl, our innocent, is really... ...our sister? Your baby sister. - Their baby half-sister. - But by my half, which makes her a sister witch. Well, actually, not yet anyway. Not until all three of you are here together by the book, just like before. Charmed... ...again. And I thought my family was screwed up. Well, I'll be damned. Darryl, do something. He's a cop, Piper. And he's got a search warrant. And believe me, I've found what I've been searching for. Don't move. I'll shoot. - And so will l. - Cole. Okay, inspector, just put the gun down. There is a very good explanation for all of this. Feel free to chime in anytime, guys. My whole life, I suspected evil magic was real. That there was something more. I've seen too many horrible things in the job to suspect otherwise. Not the least of which are the two murders that happened here. - Wait, are you accusing us--? - I've just begun to accuse you, lady! All right, fine, you caught us. Congratulations. So, what are you going to do about it? Shoot us? Easy, Grams. Not all of us are dead, remember? All right, look. You can't arrest us. Especially not them. - Nobody will ever believe you. - Maybe not at first. I'm putting this whole place under constant surveillance. I'm taping your every move. Sooner or later, I'll catch you doing something supernatural. And then-- Think you've been through enough today, huh? Thank you. Darryl, go, get out of here. We don't want you to take the fall for this. No. It's okay. No, it's not. This is our problem. He wants to expose us, not you. Let us take care of this. Please? If you need me, you know where to find me, huh? Doesn't solve your problem. He's gonna wake up eventually. You just bought yourself some time. Which you're gonna need, especially if you wanna save your... Sister? Well, what are you waiting for? Just write a spell. Get rid of him. Get rid of him? Well, you know what I mean. Dump him somewhere. Anywhere. With all the witches in this room, we ought to be able to do something with him. I mean, just start rhyming. Take him back, take him away Remove him now, don't let him stay We call the spirits to help undo And send him off to... ... Timbuktu Whoa, it worked. Timbuktu? You sent him to Timbuktu? All right, well, it was the only thing l could think of that rhymed with "undo." Don't worry. I'll... I'll find him. Okay, well, this is way too much for me to handle. Way too much. Nobody can blame you for being angry, sweetie. Angry? Yeah, I'm angry. I'm confused. And you know what? This-- This is just crazy. You cannot float in here after all these years and go, "Oh, gosh, I forgot. By the way, you've got a sister." Especially not today of all days. I know it's a lot, sweetie, more than anybody should have to deal with. But you're going to have to deal with it. The best way you know how. Losing Prue, learning about another sister... ...this is your path. It's your destiny. Get angry at it, cry about it, but don't fight it, or it'll consume you. Come on, Patty. The rest is up to them. I can't sense where she is because she's technically not a witch yet. All right, so all we have to go on is that church that Mom mentioned - and the nun. - Let's just get one thing straight: I am only doing this to save her. I'm not remotely interested in reconstituting... ...the Charmed Ones. I... The door was open. I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here. Oh, no, no, no. No, no. We were just coming to look for you. - You were? - Yep. Come on in. Welcome. I'm Phoebe. - And this is-- - Piper. I know. I've been to your club. It's pretty great. Thank you. And you are...? Paige. My name is Paige. Another P. Imagine that. It's nice to meet you. Okay. What was that? I think that means you're supposed to be here. - Run! Get upstairs! - Leo! What are we doing? What is that thing? We'll explain later. Okay, just say this spell out loud with us, okay? - Spell? What are you guys, witches? - And so are you, we hope. Well, we're about to find out. Evil wind that blows That which forms below No longer may you dwell Death takes you with this spell It's not enough. Shax was just the messenger. - We gotta get The Source. - The source of what? Of all evil. What have you guys turned me into? - Paige. - Wait. My assassin failed. The witch is alive. Yes, I know. You told me her future was short-lived. You told me-- I told you only that it appeared to be short-lived. Seeing into the future is not always exact, especially when magical forces are at play. The power of three is strong. She'll be almost untouchable now that she's united with her new sisters. Once the bond is formed perhaps. But it has yet to. Which means she's vulnerable, easily swayed. Forty-eight little hours. The window of opportunity agreed to eons ago by both sides to protect free will. The great flaw in the grand design. She hasn't chosen the other side yet. Well, she's young, confused. Doesn't know which way to turn. You must seduce her into using her powers for evil. Then she will become evil. And that's even better than killing her. Which, of course, you could still do. You need to get close to her. Read her soul, corrupt it, and she's yours. And, you. You need to see the future more clearly, Oracle... ...for your own future. What the hell? Who are you? For now, I am you. Oh, my God, the most horrible thing just happened to me. I can't explain-- It's okay, honey. I'm here now. It's okay. I don't understand how you can keep healing innocents but you can't figure out a way to heal yourself. Well, it's kind of hard to heal myself when I'm knocked out. Leo, how's it possible for an angel to even get knocked out? I mean, you are, after all, technically dead. Three years together, and now you're asking questions? Well, I think the more appropriate question is how does a whitelighter get somebody knocked up? - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, what do you think it means? If this is about Paige, I swear the Elders had no idea that she even existed. Or that she was your sister. - Sister witch. - Half witch, half whitelighter. Let's not forget that little surprise. I still can't believe that Mom kept that a secret from us. Well, it sounded like she didn't have much of a choice. We're her daughters. She could have found a way to share that information with us. That better not be another long-lost relative. - Hi, Piper. - Hi there. - Where's Cortez? - Who? Inspector Cortez, the one I hit over the head. The one you said you would take care of. He's missing. Police inspectors are not supposed to be missing. Where is he? - Well, I kind of sent him to-- - Timbuktu. It rhymed with "undo." Timbuktu. - It's okay. Cole went to get him. - Cole? - Cole. - Wait. Damn bounty hunters. They're like gnats. Where's the inspector? Don't worry, I found him. Moved him to a place he can't tell a soul what he saw. Literally. What do you mean? Where did you put him? In the basement? No, I think he means a little bit further down than that. Cole, he's a cop. He's one of the good guys. He's also the one who can expose them as witches. I'd think that you, above anybody, would want to avoid that at all costs. Not at that cost. We have to save him. Save him? What do you mean, save him? What--? What's going on? You know what? We are gonna take care of this whole mess. - Wait a sec, hold-- - You don't worry about it. All right. Okay, maybe you can talk to the inspector, reason with him. And what if he can't? What if you two get exposed? What's to say the same thing won't happen to you that happened to Prue? Well, it's a risk we'll have to take. You know what, there's another risk you guys have to worry about. On the way back, I heard gargoyles. Gargoyles? You mean, like, statues? That's only in their resting state. They come alive to ward off evil. In this case, I think they're trying to ward off The Source. I think he's surfaced. Wait, what? He's here? Now? Where? I don't know. Could be anywhere. Or anyone. He probably came for Paige. But she doesn't stand a chance against him. She doesn't even know what her power is yet. Leo, we don't stand a chance against him. Not without Prue. But you might with Paige. The new power of three. Can you sense her? I don't think so. She's too new. Well, then we just have to start with the church Mom was talking about. - Piper-- - What? Phoebe, I'm not crazy about it either, but we can't just do nothing. Not now. Mom wouldn't want us to. And neither would Prue. Oscar, what's the matter, sweetheart? It's okay, I'm home. Maybe he doesn't like me. Don't be ridiculous. He's always liked you. Well, aren't you gonna tell me what happened last night? No, it's nothing. Seemed like something to me. You were pretty scared. Let's just say that when I wanted to find out who I was, I didn't want to find out I was a freak. - Can we just talk about this later? - Of course. Hey... ... I never got a chance to thank you for taking such good care of me. Oscar. Listen, I should get to work anyway. I'm in enough trouble with the boss as it is. Well, I know how badly you want to be there for that placement hearing. - How did you know about that? - Well, you told me, remember? Little boy, abusive dad. You said nothing gets under your skin more than that. Right, okay. Make yourself at home. Stop by for lunch if you feel up to it. Count on it. Help me! You. Stay away from me! - Stay away! - We're here to save you. - You're the one who put me here! - No, no. Actually, that was just me. Hoping you'd change your mind about the girls. Have you? Killing me is the only way to keep me from trying to stop you! We're not gonna kill you, inspector. But what you don't understand is that by exposing the girls, you're not stopping evil, you're helping it. Oh, yeah, right. You do understand that if we take him back, it's over. I'll lose Phoebe. And you'll lose Piper. - Take my hand. - No. Take my hand. Where else can I take you that's worse than this? - So how's Aunt Julie? - Much better. - Yeah? - Thank you, dear, for asking. Is her hip any better? Jake and Carol Grisanti for Mr. Cowan? Okay. I'll let him know you're here. I'm sorry. Say that again. I got distracted. He'll be with you in a few minutes. I'm gonna go wash up, all right? What do you want? Oh, God. Hey, before you go, - can I ask you a question? - Sure. Do you guys still go to that church that Mom and Dad used to go to? - Yeah, we still go. - Is there still a nun called Sister Agnes there? - lsn't she the one who found you? - Yeah, right, the one that found me. - Have you spoken to her? - No, no, I haven't spoken to her, but something's come up. I think I should. Uncle Dave, I gotta go. I'll call you back, okay? - Okay, I love you, Paige. - Yeah, I love you too. - Mr. Cowan. - Hey, look, Paige, I got this, okay? But you can't let that little boy go home with that jerk. Paige, number one, you don't know for a fact he's abusing the boy. And number two, this is none of your business. You are an assistant, not a social worker. That's because you're too cheap to make me one. Phoebe, I think I found the... The church. Phoebe? What are you doing in here? You remember the time I borrowed this from Prue without asking her? Which time? When my boyfriend's cat peed on it. She got so mad, I thought she was gonna have a stroke. But the funny thing was... ...she got mad at you, because she thought that you were the one that borrowed it. And you never told her the truth. She never knew it was really me. I miss her so much. I know. Me too. I was wondering when you were gonna let go. I was just-- I was trying to-- Thanks. --stay strong, you know, keep it together for you. And then I put all my energy into trying to save Paige because I figured only one of us could break down at a time. Otherwise we'd both be useless. I'm scared, Piper. I am really, really scared. She always took the lead. She was... She was our big sister. How are we supposed to go on without her? How are we supposed to go up against The Source without her? I don't know. But I do know that we can't let the bastard get Paige either. So no matter what we think or feel, she is our sister. And sisters protect each other. - What's happening? - Nothing's been decided. - We're gonna meet again tomorrow. - Tomorrow? You can't let him go home with that kid. I can and I am. Look, Paige, you weren't in there. He was very persuasive. Persuasive? What about the police report? What about the counsellor's recommendations? Look, Paige, I know how you feel about these cases. But we can't make a decision based on what you think. We have to base it on fact. Right now, we don't have enough yet. I'm sorry. You got a problem, lady? Yeah, I do. I got a problem with people who hit their kids. - Come on, Jake, let's just go. - Wait, wait. Listen, I can do whatever the hell I want to... ...and there's nothing you can do to stop me. - Where do you think you're going? - Church. Can you give me a hand? I think that he must have slipped. Excuse me? - Are you Sister Agnes? - Yes. - And who might you be? - I'm Paige. Paige Matthews. You might not remember me. I probably changed a little bit since you last saw me on August 2nd, 1 977. Does that ring any bells? Oh, dear Lord. I was just about your age when they came. They? My mother and my father? They came in a swirl of bright white lights, just like... ...angels. White lights? What do you mean? Well, that's how they appeared, with you in their arms. I was stunned. I didn't know what to think. They said you were in great danger. That they had no other choice but to give you up to protect you. - Danger? What kind of danger? - Well, they didn't say. But I could tell from their pain that it must be very real. They asked me to find you a good home, a safe home, and to keep their secret... ...until you came looking. But how could they know? Because you come from them, my dear. As wonderful and precious as your adoptive parents were to you... ...you still come from angels. They asked me to save this for you for this day. It's what they bundled you up in. Your mother had only one request: That your name begin with a P. - Yes, may I help you? - Hi. Hey, what's up? We need to get you out of here. What did you do to her? Oh, she just froze her. She'll be fine. Yeah, lucky I didn't blow her up. My powers have been a little off lately. Piper. - Is that our blanket? - No, that's mine. - Leave me alone. - All right, jeez. Paige. Paige. Paige. - Stop, or I'll freeze. - She's a witch, you can't freeze her. - She doesn't know that. - Will you please just leave me alone. Look, we know what you're going through. We went through the same thing when we first found out we were witches too. Look, you just gotta trust us. Somebody very, very bad is after you. Trust you? You just froze a nun. How do I know you're not the bad ones? - Well, if we are, then you are, sister. - Piper. What? Fine, then you try. You have a magical power, you know. At least, if you're really a Charmed One, you do. And the sooner you learn it, the sooner you'll be able to protect yourself. - I have a power? - According to the prophecy, the third sister has the power to move things with her mind. Like Prue could. - How does it work? - You concentrate on an object, Iike that candle right there. And then you just wave your arm at it. Or you could squint your eyes. She used to squint her eyes. Maybe I'm not one of you after all if I can't even make that candle-- So perhaps the whitelighter in her makes it work differently? Half-breed. She better be here, Oracle. - I'm running out of time. - She is. Don't worry. No! What is that? I don't know. - Paige. - Shane? What's the matter? My God, what happened? I don't know. Something's after me. - Paige. - Paige. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Paige, come back! - What the hell was that? - Good question. Look, we didn't have to bring you back, you know. We could have just let you rot. - Cole, I don't think this is helping any. - Like your way is. Cortez, where you been? - Operations. - This is lnspector Cortez. I need a surveillance team, round the clock. - I'll take one shift. - What are you doing? What I said I'd do before you clipped me from behind. You're making a big mistake, inspector. You have no idea what you're doing. - You wanna bet? - Something's wrong. Piper's calling. Just so you know, whatever pain you put Phoebe through because of what you're doing will be nothing compared to the pain I put you through. You understand? Cortez, you there? What's the address? 1 329 Prescott Street. Phoebe and Piper Halliwell. They're murder suspects. - Yeah, all right. - All right. Come on. Come on. - I got four guys who can do it. - Yeah, thanks. - Hey, listen, Cortez. - Let go of me. You make me sick. How long have you been covering up for them, huh? How many other murders have you ignored just to protect them? You're a disgrace to that shield, my friend. You think this is the first time I have risked my career for those girls? My life, my family? They're the best people I've ever met. They'll do more good than you'll ever know. - And it cost them their sister. - Hey, hey, inspector, ease up. - You all right? - I'm good, I'm good. Yeah. So The Source was there at the church? Well, the gargoyles weren't exactly whistling "Dixie," Leo. Plus, something pretty powerful knocked us on our asses. But if he was there, why didn't he try to kill Paige? Maybe he didn't want to go up against the Charmed Ones. No, it doesn't make sense. He knows that Paige is new to her powers. If ever there was a time to attack... Wait a minute. What if he's not trying to kill her anymore? What if he's trying to lure her to his side? Translation, please? - The mythological window. - There's a window of opportunity, - an opening. - Forty-eight hours. Right, 48 hours where a nascent witch who hasn't chosen to use her power for good or evil yet can be swayed either way. Wait, so all he has to do is cast a spell on her? No, he can't. It has to be her choice, but he can tempt her, entice her. If he gets her to use her powers for evil-- She becomes evil forever. Who makes up these cockamamie rules? Oh, never mind. Okay, so we have less than 24 hours to get to Paige and no idea how to find her. But I'll bet The Source does. Here. Thanks. I'm so sorry to involve you in all this. All of what? Paige... ...what's going on? I don't know. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. Hey. You don't have to know. You're safe here... ...with me. I'll take care of you. Sure you don't want me to turn Belthazor loose on Cortez, just for a minute or two? No. He doesn't have anything on the girls yet. Besides, now is no time to be blurring the line between good and evil. This is useless. We're never gonna find Paige without a little help. Works every time. Okay, an enchantment spell. Wait, how is this gonna help us find her? Well, maybe it's not to find Paige. Maybe it's so we can lD The Source. See the last line? It's, "So she can reveal the evil within." But that'll only help if we can find him. Maybe we can. Or at least, maybe you can. What does he mean? Demons can sense The Source's aura. It's how he reminds us of his power, his reach. Maybe if I focused on it-- Then he'll know you're doing it, and he'll find you. Not if I was careful. It's your only chance at saving your sister. Okay, so we need something to enchant. Right. - How about these? - Oh, Phoebe. - What? They're perfect. - All right. Magic forces, far and wide Enchant these so those can't hide Allow this witch to use their ends So she can reveal the evil within Okay, better test them. - Well? - Nothing. You look the same. How about me? What? What do I look like? You look like hell. Enchanting. Thanks for the magical assist, Grams. How do you know it wasn't somebody else? You know who you are now, Paige. This is where your destiny lies. It lies not with your sister witches. It's for no one but you. This is what you've been searching for your whole life. This is why you have the power. You can't stop me. Use your power for your own desires, to seek your own revenge. Use your power. Call for his heart. Call for his life. Heart. Jake, what is it? No! I don't see Paige anywhere. Are you sure this is the right place, Cole? The Source is here. I can sense it. Wait, there she is. - What is she doing? - I don't know, but she's got a black aura around her. - The Source? - No, it can't be. If Phoebe saw my demonic self, then she'd see his too. Yeah, well, whatever it is, it's not good. Come on. Jake! Jake, what--? Paige? Paige, it's me, Phoebe. And Piper. He's evil. He's hurting his child. Someone, hurting-- No, you're being seduced into doing this. No! No, Jake! All right, you know what? Hi. Leo, take her, go home. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Let's get out of here. Are you sure you're all right? Maybe you better lay back down. I'm not covering for you anymore, Carol. You keep your hands off our son. You two go ahead. I'm gonna stay behind, make sure The Source doesn't follow you. Don't die too quickly, traitor. I want your beloved witch to see your last breath... ...to feel the heartache of loss again. Oracle, find Paige one last time. Leo, where's--? I'm having a hard time convincing her that she is not evil. - I see that. - Lamp. Bright side? At least she's getting the hang of her new power. That was Mom's crystal. - Okay, somebody-- - Off of me! Okay, relax. Relax. All right, now what? We just better hope there's some kind of Wiccan exorcism in the Book of Shadows, because-- Yeah. Who are you? Piper! Piper! That's the-- That's the-- Look, look, look, look, look. I know who that is. Your powers are strong. But will they be enough without the power of three? Shane, what's going on? It's okay, honey. I'm here now. Stay away from me. She still has free will. You can't force her to choose. Oh, but she's already chosen. Haven't you? Come with me. You'll be safe forever, I promise. Don't listen to him, he's lying. They only want you for your power. You don't have to share it. It's yours. You've already seen what you can do with it. You did what nobody else could do. You nearly saved my son from his father, from all the pain and suffering he's put him through. Please help me. Don't let him hurt me anymore. You're my only hope. No! Help me! Phoebe? Okay, come on, come on. I guess blood's a little thicker than evil. I've broken the Charmed circle before. I'll do it again. Besides, it wasn't a complete loss, thanks to Belthazor. - What did you do to him? - Oh, my God. Inspector, would you get out of here?! - Looks like evil wins again, huh? - Not if I can help it. - How'd you do that? - That's what whitelighters do. We heal good people. We have to go find Cole. Cole? Oh, no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Heal him. - You know that it's against the rules. Leo, screw the rules. The Elders owe us. Even if I could, I could only heal his human half, and that wouldn't be enough power to save him. Aren't I half whitelighter? I mean, couldn't I use my half to offset his half? It's worth a try. Take my hand. Hold your other hand over his wound. That was good, right? That was very good. Let's just hope it wasn't all for nothing. Yeah, drive safe. Thank you. Thanks, Anna. - Feels good to be here again. - Feels good to be anywhere again. I will drink to that. - Don't ever scare me like that again. - Promise. You okay? I'm not sure. Prue? Yeah. We barely got through the funeral, and then everything started to go crazy, and we haven't had a chance to mourn yet. And that's just not right. I think we'll have the rest of our lives for that. I'm still not sure about continuing on with this destiny thing. I need some time to think about it. I hope you're okay with that. Absolutely. And I hope you're okay with it too. They may not be, but I am. So does this mean I get free drinks now? I didn't mean it like that. It's not that I really drink or... Okay, I'm just gonna go. No. Paige, you belong here. Remember? Are you sure? I don't wanna intrude. Come on. Come sit right here. Okay, so maybe Leo and I should go... ...pretend like we've got something better to do. - Good idea. - Yeah. I won't stay long. I just wanted to come by and thank you. - For what? - For what? You mean, aside from saving my life? I feel like I should bake you a cake or something. Do you cook? No. No, not really. So how's Shane? He's okay, I guess. Except for I'm not too sure he wants to see me anymore. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, I can't say I blame him, you know. He doesn't know exactly what happened to him, but he knows it's something bad, and he knows it's somehow connected to me. Yeah, well, you're not truly one of us until you've dated a demon, so welcome to the club. Can I ask you a question? Why did you come to Prue's funeral? I mean, you never even met her, right? No, I never did. I don't want this to be taken the wrong way... ...but I just feel like part of me lost her too. And I just... I felt drawn to her, to all you guys. I guess it was just part of me trying to find out who I was. Come on. There's something we need to show you. Show me what? What good magic can do. Hear these words, hear my cry Spirit from the other side Come to me, I summon thee Cross now the great divide There's someone here we thought you should meet.
