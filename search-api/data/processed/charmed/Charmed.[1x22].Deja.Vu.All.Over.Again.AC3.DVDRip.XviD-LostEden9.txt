You were not worthy before now. What is the name you are using here? - Rodriguez. - Ah, yes. I've been sent to you, Rodriguez, as a gift. - Sent? By who? - I think you know who. And why. I can defeat the Charmed Ones on my own. I don't need any help. Really? What makes you think you've actually found the Charmed Ones? You kidding? After so many of my colleagues had mysteriously vanished in San Francisco this year? There could only be one reason why. I posed as a cop because I believed one was covering for them. And I was right, he was. That's how I found them. But, of course, you already know all that, don't you? It's what makes me so worthy now, right? Watch your tongue, Rodriguez, lest I split it for you. It's one thing to have found the Charmed Ones, it's quite another to defeat them, as those who have gone before you have already discovered. Tomorrow is Wednesday. I want you to get all three witches together in one place by midnight, and give it your best shot. - But if you fail... - I will not fail. Well, if you do, I'll be there to help you learn by your failures. Trust me. Now, how do you expect to get them together? Trudeau. Good morning, San Francisco. It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Wednesday...</i> Piper, what are you doing at Quake? It's 8:00 in the morning. - Morning. - Morning. All right. Yes, I'll be there in an hour. Bye. You'll be where in an hour? Quake. Piper's doing that thing for the Food Network, and she needs me to bring her another dress because she spilled marinara sauce all over the one she's wearing. - Just stay out of my closet. - Oh, don't worry, don't think she'd want to ruin another of yours. - I don't believe this. - I'm kidding. Don't have an aneurysm. No, I'm talking about the paper. Did you see the front page? Where did you park my car last night? In the driveway, I think. - Mrs Henderson's car. - Oh, thank God. I mean, that your car is in the driveway, and I'm not in the doghouse. - Is she okay? - Yeah, just a little fender-bender. No big deal. - Phoebe, Andy's in trouble. - What? Why? They think that he killed that Internal Affairs cop? No way! Maybe it's a setup trying to force him to reveal our secret. Let me see that. - Oh, no. - What is it? I saw Andy, Prue. He was dead. You said that you didn't see a demon or a warlock in your premonition, right? No, but the way he was hurled across the room, there had to have been one. - This room, here? - Right here, yeah. Okay, and you're positive it was Andy? - Prue... - I just wanna be sure, all right. This isn't just anybody that we're talking about, you know. - I know. And I care about him too. - I know you do. I'm sorry. All right, why don't you fill in Piper, and I'm gonna go warn Andy. How? He said it was too risky for you to be seen with him. Well, I don't care. Let Internal Affairs find out that we're witches. - Andy's life is a lot more important. - Okay, just please be careful. We don't know what kind of demon we're up against here. You ask me, I wouldn't be surprised if Rodriguez whacked his own partner. IA already cleared him. - IA clearing IA. Go figure. - Yeah. - What are you doing here, Morris? - Backing my partner, Rodriguez. Something you wouldn't know anything about. This is just between him and me. It's okay, Darryl. Just for the record, I'm not saying anything without my lawyer present. You don't need a lawyer. Not if you're willing to help me. You want me to help you? What, you can't frame me yourself, Rodriguez? - Look, Andy... - Oh, it's Andy now? I don't think you had anything to do with my partner's murder. That's right. But what I do think is completely off the record. And I think you'll understand why. It's my partner, or at least what's left of him. No human could've done that to him. I think he was killed by something supernatural. And I think you can help me figure out who or what it is. - Really? What makes you think that? - Come on. I know all about those unsolved cases of yours. And I know who's behind them too, who you've been covering for. It's very noble. You must care about her very much to give up your career for her. Prue Halliwell is a witch. A witch, huh? You wait here. I'll go warn the Wizard of Oz. I don't have time to screw around, Trudeau. I want you to arrange a meeting between her and me. It has to be tonight. If she can help me find who killed my partner, I'll drop all charges against you, and I won't tell anybody about her. You think about it, but not too long. - You all right? - I'm not sure. I gotta go see Prue. That's funny. She called and said she had to see you too. Well? I'm sure I made Trudeau suspicious of me. He'll go to Prue, she'll have no choice but to meet with me. But you have to get all three of them together. Trudeau cares about her. He won't let her risk meeting me alone. He'll insist she have the power of three there with her. For protection. And you think you have the power to defeat them all? You don't think I do, do you? - You think I'll fail. - Time will tell. Phoebe, over here. Thank God. The segment producer's gonna be here any minute, and I'm a complete and total wreck. I thought I was gonna have to pull a Céline Dion - and wear my dress backwards. - Piper, you've gotta listen to me. I had a premonition of Andy dying. - What? When? - This morning. Don't you check your voice mail? I called and said it was important. - Oh, no. Where's Prue? - She's warning him. In the meantime, we have to figure out who the demon is. Piper? Piper Halliwell? I would recognise you anywhere. You have not changed one bit. You don't recognise me, do you? It's Joanne. Joanne Hertz. Baker High, class of '92. Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne. - What are you doing here? - I'm the segment producer. You're the segment producer? She's the segment producer. I heard. Wow, what a small world. I thought you moved to New York. I did, and that's where I met my fabulous husband, who had this crazy idea about starting this little cable show, and putting me in charge of everything. And here we are, the Food Network's most popular show. Talk about dreams coming true. Anyway, enough about me, what have you been doing? - Why'd you do that? - What am I supposed to say? That I'm a cash-strapped, single restaurant manager who still lives in the same house I grew up in with my sisters? - And the cat. Don't forget our cat. - Phoebe, this isn't funny. Look, I don't know why you're getting so upset. She is a freak. I'm sorry, but no one is that successful at age 26. Besides, you are successful. You're talented, you're creative, and the Food Network is here to see you. Not me, not her, you. - Feel better now? - Very little. Good. Unfreeze that bitch in heels. You've got a segment to shoot, and we've got a demon to find. Has Phoebe ever been wrong about her premonitions before? No. But the good news is, every other time, we've been able to affect the outcome. - Stop the demon or warlock before... - Before I get killed. Can I get that in writing? Andy, you just have to be extra careful until we figure out who this demon is and why he's after you, okay? Andy? I was just thinking, what if the demon is Rodriguez? Why would you say that? He pulled me into the station house this morning. I thought he was gonna arrest me, but what he really wanted was a meeting with you. Meet with me? Why? He thinks his partner was killed by a supernatural being and somehow, I don't know how, Prue, he knows you're a witch. - How would he know that, unless...? - Unless he's the demon. All right, tell Rodriguez to meet me at the manor at 6:00. - It's too dangerous, Prue. - I don't have a choice. If I don't meet with him, he'll frame you and try and expose me. But if he is a demon, and it turns out to be a trap? I'll have Piper and Phoebe there to back me up. The power of three. - Plus one. Me. - No, you can't be there, Andy. That's where you were in Phoebe's premonition when... Just promise me you'll stay away. - I can't do that, Prue. - I mean it. Don't make me use my magic on you. I don't want anything to happen to you, Andy. You know how much I still care for you. Okay. I promise. All right, let's go over the plan again. Yeah, let's, because I wanna know why I'm the one answering the door. Because you're the one who knows martial arts, all right. If Rodriguez shows up and tries something right off the bat, you can knock him down. Then I can come in from the living room and freeze him. And I can come down the stairs and send him flying. Still feel like cannon fodder. - What time is it? - Just before 6. That's a little too anxious. That's not a good sign. Which means if he doesn't wanna kill Prue, he wants to date her. All right, come on, let's get this day over with. Okay. All right already. Inspector Rodriguez. I'm here to see Prue Halliwell. Yeah, no kidding. Prue, Piper, company. Phoebe! Phoebe. Oh, my God. - Oh, God, Phoebe. - Prue, is she okay? She's dead. What? Phoebe! Phoebe! Hurts to die, doesn't it? Especially at the hands of a witch. Wait. What happened? Where am I? Exactly where you were when you first met me. Time has been reset. Or, rather, I have reset time. But they killed me. That was Wednesday night, this is Wednesday morning all over again. This is why I have been sent to you: To keep resetting time until you learn from your failures. Only you will carry with you the memory of what has happened before. And each time you fail, you will learn more until, ultimately, you will kill all of them. Good morning, San Francisco. It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Wednesday...</i> Piper, what are you doing at Quake? It's 8:00 in the morning. - Morning. - Morning. Wait a minute. I am freaking out. Okay, I'll be there in an hour. Be where in an hour? - Okay, pinch me. - What? No, I mean it, pinch me. I wanna make sure I'm awake. Because if I am, I am having one killer déjà vu. So it's just a déjà vu. Everybody gets them. Not like this, they don't. Look, Prue, something weird is going on here. - I don't believe this. - No, trust me, okay. This has happened before. Everything! I'm talking about the paper. Did you see the front page? See? Like that, right there. You said that before, I know it. Okay, and that has happened before too. Where did you park my car last night? In the driveway. And I told you that already the last time you asked me. I think I'm having an aneurysm. Mrs Henderson's car. Just a little fender-bender. No big deal. Prue, I am not nuts. Okay, maybe just a little, but that's irrelevant here. - Phoebe, Andy's in trouble. - What? Let me see that. Now, that was a premonition which I've had before. - Of what? - Of Andy, here... ...being killed by a demon. - What are you doing here? - Backing my partner. - You got a problem with that? - Get out. Now! It's okay, Darryl. I got it. Just for the record, I'm not saying anything without my lawyer present. Forget your lawyer. I'm not screwing around this time. This time? What are you talking about? Bottom line, I know my partner was killed by a supernatural being, and I think Prue Halliwell can help me figure out who did it. Really? I'll just get the commissioner to signal Batman and then I'll get right on it. You think I'm joking? I know everything, Trudeau. Including the fact that Prue Halliwell is a witch. You're gonna arrange a meeting with her tonight, understand? Or else I'm gonna bust your ass and expose hers. - What was that about? - I'm not sure. - Well? - Trudeau will set to meet, but what I need to know is how to avoid the pain of getting vanquished again. Depends on whether you've learned enough to vanquish them first. What do you remember? Last time, I killed the youngest one, Phoebe, without a fight. But then when I turned to kill Piper... I think she's the one who has the power to freeze. Adjust. Simply anticipate where she's coming from earlier, before she has the chance to freeze you. Then kill Prue. Andy dies? Are you sure that's what you saw? Even worse, I know that I've had the same premonition before. I mean, before I had it earlier today. - You mean, like yesterday? - Yes. I mean, no. It's not just the premonition I've seen before, it's everything. And don't tell me that it's just déjà vu, because I know that it's not. - Okay, all right, then what is it? - Piper? Piper Halliwell? I would recognise you anywhere. You have not changed one bit. You don't recognise me, do you? - It's... - Joanne. Joanne Hertz, right? - I'm right, aren't I? - I'm sorry, have we met? Yes. I mean, sort of. Before. Baker High, class of '92. Although, I wasn't in that class. Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne. - Phoebe, how did you...? - That's what I've been trying to tell you. I think we're in some funky time loop here. - Phoebe. - Freeze her. I'll show you. Okay, Joanne here is the Food Network segment producer. She's about to brag how she's happily married to some rich guy, how she's following her dreams, how she's had a really bad nose job. Okay, I added the last part. But this is all gonna make you feel like you're wasting your life away in comparison. Unfreeze her. Go ahead, see for yourself. - Are you the segment producer? - Why, yes, I am. Following your dreams, are you? Happily married? Stinking rich? - Well, I don't mean to brag, but... - Oh, God. All right, Phoebe, spill it. Okay, the best I can figure is some demon has cast a spell, and I'm the only one who can sort of see it because my power lets me see things that have happened in different times. - Do you have a better explanation? - No. All right, so if you're right, you think this has something to do with Andy being killed? I don't know, but we'll never find who the demon is unless we get to... Book of Shadows. I'm right behind you.</i> What if he is a demon, and it turns out to be a trap? I'll have Piper and Phoebe there to back me up. The power of three. Plus one. Me. What is it? This seems a little familiar to me, that's all. Kind of like déjà vu. Never mind. Andy, you can't be at the meeting. In Phoebe's premonition, that's where you were when... Just promise me that you'll stay away. - Prue, I can't do that. - I mean it. Don't make me use my magic on you. Andy, I don't want anything bad to happen to you. You know how much I still love you. No... ...I didn't. Anything in there about time loops? A spell to accelerate time, that's about it. I'm telling you, this is all part of his evil plan. I just haven't had enough time to figure it out yet. - What time is it? - Just before 6. I'll get it. All right already. Phoebe! Oh, my God, no! Piper! Son of a bitch! - Failed again, I see. - Yeah, but I learned. This time I got two of them. Third time is the charm. Good morning, San Francisco. It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Wednesday in the Bay Area...</i> Don't tell me, I already know. You spilled marinara sauce on your dress, right? Am I right? Think, Piper, think. Doesn't all of this seem awfully familiar to you? - Morning. - Freeze. No, not you, Piper. Kit knocks over pepper, meows. Hold that thought. Okay, Piper, you need to get home as soon as you can. Okay, we've got major demon hunting to do. Oh, and if you run into someone named Joanne from high school, just tell her to go stick it. I will explain later, just hurry. - Okay, what's going on? - Quick, follow me. Five, four, three, two, one. Car honks, skids, crashes. Mrs Henderson's car, a little fender-bender. Good thing I parked your car in the driveway last night. How did you know that? Because this has all happened once before, Prue. Maybe even more than once. The day keeps repeating itself. I know it. And every time it happens, I think I figure it out just a little bit faster. It must be my power of premonition. Premonition. I'm supposed to be having a premonition right about now. Supposed to? What do you mean? The paper. Look at the front page. - Andy... - Is in trouble. More than you know, Prue. If I touch that paper, I will have a premonition. The same one that I've had before, where Andy gets killed, here, by a demon. You have got to believe me. No, I believe you. The question is, what do we do about it? Well, you've gotta go warn Andy. Keep him away from our house at all costs. Meanwhile, I've gotta dig through the Book of Shadows,</i> find a way to vanquish this time demon before he can kill Andy. You really shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't do anything differently if you expect to succeed tonight. I will succeed tonight, old man. There will be no more time loops. This time I'll kill Prue first and then the other two. And when they die, they're gonna feel every ounce of pain they've given me and then some. Joanne, I'm so sorry, but I can't do this segment right now. Something's happened. Something bad. I have to go. What? Run out of marinara sauce? Kidding. Look, I know I don't have the flashy job or the flashy ring or the flashy designer suit, but that doesn't make me less than you or anybody else. And just because I may not have realised my dreams yet like you think you have, doesn't mean I won't find a way to do exactly that. And when I do, you can be damn sure I'll be doing it with my own nose and not the one some discount doctor gave me. A time loop? You mean demons can actually do that sort of thing? None that I've ever seen before. But if it is a demon, it's the most powerful one that we've ever come up against. And he's going through all this just to kill me? No way, Prue. If he's as powerful as you say, then he's gotta be after you. Please let us handle this. Whatever you do, promise me that you'll stay away from the manor. I can't promise you that. If you're right and Rodriguez is the demon, then it's a trap. I'll have Piper and Phoebe there to back me up. The power of three. What if he wants all three of you together? If that's the reason he set the time loop? - We'll have to take our chances. - You could get killed, Prue. I mean it. This is not your fight. Don't make me use my magic on you. Andy, I would die if anything happened to you. I love you. I love you too, Prue. Oh, my God! Prue! The devil's sorcerer, Tempus, he can manipulate time any way he chooses. Does it say how to vanquish him? Take him out of the time that he's in, whatever that means. No! Andy! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Is Prue okay? Yeah. She's out cold. Oh, my God. He's dead. The only reason you're still alive is because I haven't figured out how to kill you yet. Go ahead, kill me, witch. I don't care. - Phoebe, what are you doing? - I'm trying to save Andy. Andy? Andy's dead. You can't save him, Phoebe. No? We're in a time loop, aren't we? All we have to do is start this day over, and Andy lives. And I'm willing to bet that his death somehow triggers the time loop. I'm impressed. I was told you wouldn't know that. Really? By who? Tempus? Yeah, we know about him too, and we also know that you're not him. Otherwise, you would've restarted the day by now. - So where do we find him? - In your nightmares. Kill me. I dare you. Why is he so willing to let us kill him? Who cares? He dies, Andy lives. End of story. What if that's exactly his plan? To reset the day and he can kill us all next? Doesn't matter. The day's gonna reset itself anyway, and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop it. Shut up. Come on, we have to wake up Prue. Prue. Prue, come on, we need your help. - Prue. - Prue. Prue.</i> Come to me, Prue. Andy, what's going on? Where are we? I'm not quite sure, really. I hoped I'd end up here, but not so soon. One thing I do know, though, is that I'm staying. You're not. I don't understand. I broke my promise, Prue. I came to your house tonight. Turns out Phoebe's premonition was one you couldn't stop after all. Weren't supposed to stop. - Wait a minute, Andy, no. - It's okay, Prue, really. Trust me. This is my destiny, I know that now. Yours is to continue on. Everything happens for a reason, remember? You taught me that. - This isn't fair. - You need to go back. You need to keep the time loop from being reset again, or you and your sisters will be killed, and I will have died in vain. - I'll kill Rodriguez for this. - No, you won't. You're not a murderer, Prue. You're a good person who does good things. - I don't wanna lose you. - Don't worry, you won't. I'll always be there for you, Prue. Prue. Prue, come on, wake up, sweetie. Come on. Come on, we need your help. Come on. Easy, easy, easy. - Okay. - Where's Andy? Prue, something terrible has happened. Oh, my God. It all happened so fast, Prue. He ran in the door when Rodriguez attacked. He was trying to save us. And he'll succeed. - Where's the Book of Shadows? - It's right here.</i> Why? Where's the spell that you saw to accelerate time? - What are you doing? - There. What's going on? We don't wanna accelerate time, we wanna reverse it. No, we don't, trust me. The only chance that we have to get rid of Tempus is to do this by breaking the time loop, okay? But if we break the time loop, we won't be able to save Andy. - I know. - Prue, are you sure? No, I'm not. "Winds of time, gather round Give me wings to speed my way"</i> Wait a minute. "Rush me on my journey forward Let tomorrow be today"</i> What's happening? No! Prue? You know what, just untie him. Get him out of here. What? He'll kill us! No, he won't. He doesn't have the power to kill us. Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed Tempus. I will not untie him, Prue. Get out of here before I change my mind. You stupid witch. We may not be murderers, but we're no angels either. Good morning, San Francisco. Well, it looks like it's going to be a gorgeous Monday morning</i> here in the Bay Area... She really needs another shtick, that one's getting boring. Maybe she should hire Joanne Hertz, boost her ratings. Speaking of the she-devil herself, did you ever call to reschedule your segment? No, I'm not going to. - Why? - I've decided to quit my job. What? And, actually, I owe it all to Joanne. She made me realise that somehow I'd forgotten what my dreams were. Still are. I always wanted to be a chef and have my own restaurant, not manage one. It's a good job and the pay's okay, but it's not my dream job. I think that's great. I really do. And don't worry, if you need any help trolling the classifieds, I am an expert. Prue? Are you all right? Yeah, actually, I am. Andy's been exonerated. They're now looking for Rodriguez. Good luck. Hey, are you sure you're all right? Yeah. I was just thinking about all that we've been through since we became witches. - Give you a headache? - No, actually. It gave me a good feeling. I mean, look, it's a hassle and can sometimes screw up our personal lives... - Amen to that. - And we do good things together. It helps offset the bad things. I'm gonna really miss Andy. It's gonna be very sad without him. Something tells me that he'll always be with us. We better get ready for work. I'll tell her later. - Tell me what?
