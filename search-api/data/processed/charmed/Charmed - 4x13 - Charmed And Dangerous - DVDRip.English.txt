Can you wake up? Can you do this? You can do it, come on. - Maybe we should call Leo. - No, we can still make this plan work. Seems almost anticlimactic after all this time, doesn't it? Say hello to Prue for me. Piper, now! Now! Crystals! Circle! Well? What did you see? I saw... ...your demise. My demise? That cannot be. You know how powerful my visions are. More so even than the Oracle's were, and more accurate. You mean to tell me that with all the powers at my disposal, all I've learned about them, in the end I still lose? How is that possible? The Charmed Ones' power must simply be greater than yours. I mean no disrespect. I only speak of what I see. Then the only way to change what you see is to obtain more power. The ultimate power. But that's forbidden. The Hollow has been banished for all eternity. If you unleash it, we all could die. If I don't prevail, what difference does it make? - There must be another way. - No! With The Hollow, I will render the witches powerless. Then I will destroy them, even if it means destroying us all. Do I need to think about this now? - Yes. - Why? Because The Source has already killed one of us. And if, God forbid, it happens again, we want to be prepared. You should be honoured that if we don't make it, - we're leaving you everything. - Hey, guys! Guess what? What makes you think I'll outlive you? Leo, you're an angel, literally. Which means, short of a darklighter, you win "Most Likely to Survive." Speaking of surviving. Source bulletin, this just in. Honey, just sign the freaking thing. What? Phoebe has something she'd like to say that might affect what you're doing. Thank you, honey. We nailed the Source-vanquishing spell. Our ancestors, that's what we were missing. If we could draw the magic from the entire Halliwell line... We might have enough power to vanquish The Source. - Yes. - This is good, this might work. - I'll go tell the Elders. - Hey! You did not sign this! Oh, honey, are you still on that last-will-and-testament kick? I gotta tell you, it's very, very morbid. No, it's very, very responsible. Prue did it, and thank God she did, because if she didn't, we'd still be dealing with lawyers. - No offence. - Oh, none taken. I've come to terms with my evil past. I know what you're saying, but I have a really good feeling about this. Okay? No one is gonna die any time soon. - You all right? - Yeah. I just have the hiccups. See? Piper, can I talk to you for a minute in the kitchen? Sure. Phoebe, with or without The Source, I still need a will, especially if I'm ever gonna start a family. This isn't about a will. This is about a premonition I just had that I don't want Cole to know about. What do you mean? Why not? Because I just saw him jump in front of a demon to take a fireball for me, that's why not. A demon? What kind of demon? One with a half a face. - Yuck! - Yeah. So we have to figure out who the demon is - and vanquish him before Cole-- - What if we need Cole to lD him? I mean, The Source probably sent this demon. That's exactly my point. He's gonna wanna stay close to protect me. Well, honey, that's what you do for people you love. I know, but Piper, he's human now. It's not like he could fend off a fireball. - Well, can't you talk to him? - No, I've tried. He's not gonna sit by the sidelines, it's not who he is. So you're not gonna tell him? The attack happened in the attic. So I'll just keep him out of the house, until we could lD the demon. All right, it's your relationship, it's your call. I'll let Paige know what's up as long as you're sure. Trust me, I'm sure. The judge just wants to hear the truth, that's all. Everything is gonna be okay. Yeah, but once he hears about all the awful things I've done... "Done," as in past tense. My past is why I lost custody of my son in the first place. We're not gonna pretend that you weren't in an abusive relationship, or that you didn't go to rehab. It's just that I've made so many mistakes. Oh, honey, look... Your ex is out of your life, okay? You've been clean and sober for two years now, and you've held down a steady job, at a police station no less. That you've changed. That's all that matters. The judge just cares about who you are, not about who you were. And that's what's gonna help you get your son back. Excuse me. Not a good time, I'm in the middle of something important. Does a half-face demon qualify as important? - He's there now? - No. Well, then, no, that doesn't qualify. Phoebe had a premonition, and not a good one. I know why I'm whispering. Why are you? So it keeps making this, like...noise. But it's not even your car. No, but I don't want Piper to be driving it and have it break down. If you could take it to the mechanic and have him look at it, that would be great. Phoebe, that thing you were talking about? A day thing or a night thing? - Night. - What thing? It's nothing important. There's nothing wrong with the car, is there? - No. - But you want me to leave, don't you? - Yes. - And you don't wanna tell me why. If you could just give us a couple hours, and don't ask any questions. Please? Please? - You'll tell me later? - I promise. All right. I love that man. Paige, look, this could be the attack we've been waiting for. You need to come home now. But Phoebe's premonition happened at night, right? - Right. - Okay. Well, you know how long I've been working with Carolyn. I promised her I'd be at the hearing today. Okay, fine, but you need to come home as soon as you can. Okay. We're gonna meet you outside the courthouse at 3, right? Yeah. Paige, is everything all right? Peachy. All you have to do is relax and by tonight, your son is gonna be with you. God, I don't know what I'd do without you. You're my angel. Make a damned move. You're just mad because good is winning. No, just bored standing here, watching you think. Patience is a virtue. Oh, I have been plenty patient. Three thousand, five hundred years patient. There. Happy now? Now who's winning? You need to leave immediately. This place is an ancient burial ground. I know that, thank you. With all due respect, you're not allowed to be here. Have you forgotten who I am? Whose side you're on? There are no sides. We protect all magic, that was the agreement. The agreement's just been revoked. Die! Please, The Hollow is a threat to us all. Its power is too great. That's exactly the kind of power I need. No! Please don't! The Hollow consumes powers! Now you will be able to consume powers... ...and give them to me. So we found a demon with half a body, but no demon with half a face. Well, we do have a resident demonologist living in the house. Yeah, we've had that conversation. All right, you keep looking, I'll go get some coffee. Piper! Piper, blow him up. Thank you. Phoebe, did you see that? Phoebe? Phoebe! What's taking so long? She almost died, that's what's taking so long. Easy, easy. What happened? One very mean demon. Did you get him? Yes, but something else got away. And that's not all. Throw this. Just do it. My powers are gone. It stole your powers? Stole, ate, absorbed, I don't know. The only thing I do know is that I gotta get them back. I don't understand. We vanquish a demon and then lose our powers? How does that work? That thing must have absorbed her power somehow, although I don't know how. Well, with The Source lurking around... That's him. This is him. "Guardians of The Hollow"? - Ring any bells? - That's not possible. Why not? What is it? The Hollow is something that consumes all magic, good or evil. And both sides agreed to guard it. That thing must have been The Hollow. It must have taken over the demon. Then how do we get it to regurgitate? There is no mention of a vanquish here. You can't vanquish it. The last time it was unleashed, it nearly decimated all magic, all things. The last time it was unleashed? Eons ago. Good and evil had to join forces and use their strongest magic, and even then, all they could do was contain it. Okay, so if good and evil are seeing eye to eye on this one, who let it out? The Source. If he was desperate enough. Which means he won't stop at just my powers, he's gonna send another demon for yours and Paige's. The demon with a half a face, see if he's in the Book. Even if she could use your powers, you wouldn't be able to - because he'd just steal them. - Then how do we stop him? We'll use potions instead. I'll make one to replicate my exploding power. Okay, you better get Paige. You're gonna need the power of three. I'll go check with the Elders. On a scale from one to bad... This is very bad. Something must have happened to her. She seemed pretty shaky this morning. You don't think she-- No. No way. She wouldn't sabotage this, not when she's come so close to getting her son back. Yeah, well, I believe you, but will the judge? God, I hope her ex didn't find her. Carolyn? Oh, hey, Phoebe. Look, I'm gonna need more time-- Okay, I'm on my way. - I gotta go. - You can't just leave. You're the reason why she's getting a second chance. Well, now it's up to you. I have to go, it's a demonic emergency. A big one. Okay. What do you need me to do? I need you to postpone the hearing for a couple hours. You know better than that. You can't just postpone legal proceedings. - There are forms to file, lawyers-- - Please, Darryl, can you please pull some strings and buy us some time? If we don't help her, there is no one who will. Okay. I'll try. Thanks. Just keep paging her, trying her at home. We have got to find her. Here you go. One owl feather. Do you think I jinxed us with the will? Maybe it wasn't such a great idea. Actually, I'm beginning to think it was a very smart idea. - That's not so funny. - Trust me, I know. Hi. Am I back too soon? We need his help. No time to be evasive. Help for what? It's obvious you're making a potion, so, what is it you're not telling me? I had a premonition. A demon attacked, and you jumped in front of a fireball to save me. What? You can't keep these things from me. I was just trying to protect you. Well, that's not a good enough reason. I hate to interrupt, but maybe we should talk about the demon. What did he look like? A creepy half-face, and his good side had tribal markings. - A little bit like-- - Belthazor. A little bit. Do you know who he is? Does he work for The Source? He doesn't work for The Source, Phoebe, he is The Source. His face was disfigured in the battle that brought him to power. Only upper-level demons have seen him. You should have told me. So he's the one that released The Hollow. The Hollow? What do you mean, released? It already attacked us. It took Piper's power. Then you'd better figure out a way to beat The Source without your powers, otherwise... Already on it. The witch's powers are impressive. Nevertheless, do you think it wise to have extracted them from The Hollow? There could be repercussions. Damn the repercussions, Seer! I won't stop until I have all three of their powers coursing through my veins. You understand me? I can't risk going against them myself until I do. No one wins while The Hollow roams free. I control The Hollow. For now. But the more magic it absorbs, the stronger it becomes. And the more you extract from it, the more it corrupts you, until it consumes all things, including you! Unless you want to face eternity as a pile of ash, I suggest you stop questioning me and do as I say! How can I be of service? I want the Charmed Ones, darklighter. But my arrows don't kill witches. But they do kill whitelighters. I want you to kill theirs... ...so he can't heal them anymore. And when you've done that... ...then I want you to bring me a little gift. Five magic crystals, oriented east to west. Magic circle, check. Oh, purple good. Purple equals exploding power. Exploding power, check. One fabulously written Source-vanquishing spell, check. - Don't get cocky. - Not cocky. Confident. We are talking about the source of all evil, maybe measured optimism is best. The Source unleashed The Hollow. Already on that train, honey. It took my powers. Anything else? Good and evil magic need to join forces and read the inscription on the box where The Hollow is kept. That will put it back in its crypt and return your powers. Okay, so at least we know how to banish it. This is good news. Good news if The Source brings the box and we can find an evil being willing to help. Hey, Cole, too bad you're not still evil. Well, one step at a time. First we vanquish The Source, then we'll worry about putting Pandora back in its box. Hello? Hey, Darryl. Oh, no. Are you sure she's gonna be okay? Yeah, the ER doctor said there was no internal bleeding. But she still got beat up pretty bad. Damn it! How did he find her? I have no idea. I've got every available officer out there looking for him. What about the hearing? I got it postponed for an hour from now, but I doubt we're gonna find him by then. Look, Paige, with her history, this doesn't look good. We need you in the kitchen. You know, Leo, I have my charges too. Leo! - Crossbow! - No! Your powers! - Leo? - Paige, watch out! Baby? Paige, hold his hand. Okay. It's through. Easy, easy, easy. Paige, don't touch that, you're a whitelighter too. Just lay back. Easy. You're okay. Just lay back. Easy. Still bossing me around, huh? You better believe it. I don't understand. How come you can heal us but you can't heal yourself? Just doesn't work that way. Hey, I bet you could switch powers with Phoebe - like we did before... - No! If The Source comes and Phoebe doesn't have her powers... ...you don't stand a chance. I mean it. I'm still your whitelighter. Well, who's bossing whom around now? Paige, go tell Phoebe to find something else. A potion, an amulet, a spell, whatever. Go! It'll never work. Will anything? I don't know. So, what, we're all just gonna die? You can't think that way. Why not? Isn't that what we're all thinking anyway? We'll figure out a way out of this. How? The Source knew we'd be prepared, that's why he came after our powers. The Source knew we had an in-house healer, that's why he came after Leo. He knows what we're gonna do before we even do. Well, it's not over yet. I still have my power. Great. Two down... One to go. What is it? What do you see? Tell me. I see nothing. What do you mean? Do I or do I not have the power to defeat the witches? You misunderstand. I see nothing. No magic... ...no life... ...no world. The Hollow will consume everything, just as I warned. Then if there's no future, I have no further need for you, do l, Seer? Please, I beg you, find another way. Put The Hollow back where it belongs. Not until I've finished. Not until I've killed them all. But that's madness. The Hollow won't let you stop there. Then so be it! Forgive me. I serve you as always. Even until the end. Guard The Hollow. I have one more demon to recruit. One more power to obtain. Leo? Hey. Hey. Drink this. Guess you picked the wrong beneficiary after all. Don't talk like that. Piper... ...you need to get out of here before he comes back. I'm not leaving you. The Source... Is not gonna scare me away. And neither are you. So just forget about it. You're not gonna die. Because I'm not gonna let you. I'm just looking for my potion book. Have you seen it anywhere? I didn't think you could save Leo with a potion. Well, it's not just to save Leo. It's to save us all. Oh, yeah? How? I don't know, but I have to do something. I can't just sit around and... What's that? - This? - Yeah. Just a little something I've been waiting for the right moment to give you. It's not your Grams', but hopefully it's not cursed. I don't think now is the time. Actually, I think now is the perfect time. This way, no matter what happens, you'll always know that I love you. It's beautiful. Now you have to go. No, I'm staying here with you. Do you want me to watch you die too? If that's what it takes to save you, yeah. No, but I'm supposed to save you. That's why I got that premonition. Not necessarily. You know as well as I do you're not meant to stop every premonition. Some are just meant to prepare you for what's to come. I'll be right there. Paige, this is no time for guests. It's not social, I called Darryl. Darryl? You're supposed to be helping Phoebe. She doesn't need my help, but there is somebody who does. Excuse me. Oh, Carolyn. I'm so sorry, Paige. After everything you've done to help me... It's not over. Not yet. Paige. Darryl, take Carolyn into the sunroom. - Is everything okay? - No. Yes. Are you out of your mind? We don't have time for other people's problems right now. It's something I've got to do. Especially if it's the last thing I do. - Hey, what's going on? - I don't have time to explain. I think I can still help you get your son back. But how? The judge will take one look at me and-- No. I think I can help. I just need you to turn away from me. Please, just trust me. Hey. Hey. You're gonna use magic? Yes, I am. Let the object of objection Become but a dream As I cause the seen To be unseen Okay, Carolyn, you can turn around now. What? What happened? Just a second, Carolyn. Look, I've known you guys long enough to know that you don't do something like this unless something is seriously wrong. What's going on? Just get downtown, and make the judge see the real Carolyn. And make sure that slimebag ex of hers gets put away. Please? Just go. Piper? We may have a plan to get your powers back. Then maybe Paige could help heal Leo. A spell? Remember the one to call for a witch's powers? Maybe it might be strong enough to call the powers from The Hollow. - Could that work? - It has to. - Could you watch Leo? - Sure. Don't be afraid. Who are you? Where am l? Back in your once and future life... ... Belthazor. Belthazor? Seer. Even now I can see the void where your demon half used to exist. It craves to be complete again. How did you know I was still alive? I had a vision. One where you and l do great things together. I don't work with evil anymore. You might reconsider, if you hope to save your precious witch. Only you and I can help her defeat The Source. I'm listening. If you take in The Hollow, you can absorb The Source's power when he attacks. Once powerless, they can vanquish him. And what happens to me after? The witches and I will banish The Hollow back to its crypt. You will return to normal. How do I know this isn't just one of The Source's tricks? Or one of yours, for that matter? The Source has been corrupted by The Hollow, and he's going to destroy us all. He cannot be allowed to continue with this path of madness. And if I do this... ...what do you see then? A future... ...for both sides. Is this the great thing you saw us doing together? Perhaps. However, you won't ever know unless The Source is stopped first. It's your only chance to save your love. The power of the witches rise Course unseen across the skies Come to us who call you near Come to us and settle here Oh, my God! Not quite. Run! How do we call for our powers? I have your powers now. And a few of my own. Piper! Hurry, he's coming! Come on, honey. We need you, Piper, it's time. Come on, you can do it. Do what? We have no powers. It doesn't matter, we can still make the plan work. Get the crystals. Seems almost anticlimactic after all this time, doesn't it? Piper. Say hello to Prue for me. Phoebe! Your power was always the weakest. Hardly worth taking. Your life, however, is! Paige, now! Got him! Crystal. Now the moment we've all been waiting for. Belthazor! No. The Hollow. Hurry, the spell! Prudence, Patricia Penelope, Melinda Ashley, Helena, Laura and Grace Halliwell witches Stand strong beside us Vanquish this evil From time and space No! No! No! Who are you? Someone who just helped save your lives. Quickly, take my hand! Trust her if you want your powers back. Say the inscription with me. I can't do it, nothing's happening. Hold his hand. Let his power to heal flow through you. Paige. Phoebe. I did it. It worked. Leo? All is as it should be again. Time to return to my side. Too bad Belthazor's gone, he would have made a great new Source. Too bad. I don't know who you are, but whoever you are, we thank you. Oh, I didn't do this for your future. I did it for mine. I don't understand. If we got our powers back, where did The Source's go? Into the void. Okay, who was that? A very evil person. Yeah, one that saved our lives and helped us kill The Source. All right, here you go. Enjoy. Here you go, guys. On the house. - Oh, easy for you to say. - Yeah, well, we deserve to celebrate. Yeah, I still can't believe it. You guys actually vanquished The Source. So, what does that mean? Is our destiny fulfilled? I don't know, but at least that part of the nightmare is over. For Prue. For Prue. What do you say we go home and get started on our future? What do you say we go home and sleep, and we work on that future tomorrow night? Hi, honey. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, why? Well, it just took you a while to get back. It did? You know, facing death has kind of made me wanna face life. And I'll tell you what, there's a piece of life over there that I think I'm gonna go talk to. You go get him, girl. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little tired. Too tired to celebrate?
