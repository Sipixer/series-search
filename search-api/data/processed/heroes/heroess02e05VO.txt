you're part of the family now. (mohinder) i'm in over my head. as long as i'm alive, you will be taken care of. (caitlin) peter! this here's everything you had on you when we found you. your box or your life. you gonna open it, or what? hiro nakamura, murdered. angela petrelli, attacked. this is my dad. he may be the killer. i'll find your father. molly, what's the apartment number? nine. nine. good girl. get out of there right now. he sees me. get out of there. leave me alone! aah! molly, please wake up. (mohinder) when confronted by our worst nightmares, the choices are few: fight or flight. we hope to find the strength to stand against our fears. but sometimes, despite ourselves, we run. what if the nightmare gives chase? where can we hide then? (parkman) okay, when's she gonna wake up? i don't know, she's burning up. all right, we gotta get her to a hospital. no hospital's equipped to deal with this. you really think my father did this to her... in her nightmare? she used her ability to find him for you, and slipped into this. she was so afraid. i never should have asked her to look for him. no, you shouldn't have. but now you know where he is. i can't just leave her like this. you have to. if your father did something to her, you need to find out what and how to end it. you have an address in philadelphia. she even saw his door. i haven't seen the man in 25 years. molly faced her worst nightmare for you. do the same for her. find him. i'll stay here with her. i'll do everything i can. i don't even know what i'm dealing with. why was he in that photo? angela petrelli... she knows him. you're gonna be okay. i promise. i was about to lock up when this guy showed up. he--he pushed his way in, shoved a gun in my face. next thing i know he's flying through that glass. you hit an armed man? i guess. could've been a kick. i don't know, it all happened so fast. is this the guy? his name is lonny stills. he's a local gangbanger. he's already hit three other fast food joints in the area this month. it fits his m.o. like i said, it's all a blur. look, i know you don't want to be a snitch. it's dangerous. but in order for me to get this guy off the street, i need somebody to step up and i.d. him. be a hero. i'm sorry, i can't do that. you know, i can't help a neighborhood that won't help itself. you change your mind, you give me a call. (peter) you closing up already? it's the middle of the afternoon. i need a break. i could get used to this. right, a guy who can throw 1,000 volts our of either hand... settlingor everyday life in a pub in cork. i'm not sure it suits you. why not? peter, just because you don't remember your past, it doesn't mean you don't have one. aren you curious about who you are, or where you come from? you've seen what i can do. there's a side of me that i can't control. maybe it's best if i don't dig too deep. i know the kind of man you are. even if you don't. there's only good in you. and i bet whatever's in that box will tell you the same thing. weren't you the one who didn't want me to look in that box? i only said that because you hadn't kissed me yet. now that you have, you done with me? mm...gettin' there. after all, a pretty boy like you, there's bound to be someone looking for you. friends. a girlfriend. let 'em look. like i told you, you're not gonna find him in there. but you're sure it was him? yeah. found him cuffed inside there a few nights back. poor sap. didn't know how he got there. didn't even know his own name. do you know where he is now? depends. who's askin'? just me. i work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble. peter is a... dangerous guy. ha. you don't have to tell me that. he's in town. place called wandering rocks pub. hey, if he's so dangerous, sweetheart, why'd they send a little girl like you in all alone? i can take care of myself. bring her back to holding. what do you think you're doing interrogating my mother without me there? relax. she didn't give me anything. of course she didn't give you anything. these people protect each other. my mother's not a killer. i'm not gonna have her sit in jail for a crime she didn't commit. neither am i. that's why i'm going to philadelphia to see my father, figure this whole thing out. let me come with you. no! you're not a cop. listen, i'm guessing this isn't official police business. so if i'm there, it won't really make a difference. because officially, neither are you. you don't understand. it's molly. my father did something to her. she's in trouble. what do you mean "did something to her"? come here. did what? he got inside her head somehow. i don't know how he did it, but i think it's all connected. to kaito. to your mother. it could be dangerous. i can take care of myself. listen, i have to do this. let me come with you. fine. we can probably get therfaster. you know, 'cause you can, uh... i'm not a cargo jet, parkman. oh, please. i need to talk to him. alone. tell him what you told me. this american girl... she's hitting all the boys on the dock, looking for a certain shipping container. she say what she wanted? yeah. you. no worries, boyo. i think i can help. this is my problem. not given what i just saw between you and my sister. you care about her, don't you? right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something. caitlin has a flat up the hill. go there and stay until i call you. i'll take care of your friend. i could handle this myself. i don't doubt it. i've seen what you can do. but i've got an investment in you now. some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off. now go on. and don't be telling caitlin about any of this. she'll only worry sick. monica. well? well, what? well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about? uh, i just didn't want some crackhead looking r revenge. so i said i didn't recognize him. no, not that. i'm talking about the whole flying karate kick thing. oh...that. mr. lamont said he has never seen anything like it. how did you do that? more importantly, why did you do that? i don't know. i don't know anything anymore. nothing makes any sense. well...where did you learn how to... i think-- i think on tv. something is happening to me, camille. my body does things before my brain even knows what's happening. that thing with the tomatoes yesterday. now this. it's like... like what? i was supposed to be somebo, camille. the first person in my family to go to college. now look at me. you know what, never mind. i've been here since last night. i'm just gonna go home and sleep it off. hey, monica. everything's gonna be okay. oh. okay? yeah. i hope so. all right, this is it. this is where molly said we'd find him. what are you planning, exactly? i'm not sure. you're not sure? he traumatized your girl. has my mother terrified. you better get sure. get your gun out. come on. hey... you okay? when i was 13, my father ran out on us. i haven't talked to him. i haven't seen him. i've spent half my life thinking about what i'm gonna say to this guy if i ever got the chance. and now i can't even knock on the door. you're welcome. parkman, this is not a family reunion. i know. okay. he's not your dad today. he is a suspect. get your gun out.

(mohinder) it's molly. she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse. i'm running out of options here. take her to the hospital. and say what? that she's trapped in a nightmare? no, i am taking her into the company. you can't be serious. these are the people we're fighting against. molly won't last. not like this. they are the only people who can understand what's happening to her. don't do this. the moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you. don't forget whe side you're on. i'm on her side. all right, you gotta tell us everything. every crime. everyone you've ever worked with. everything. i'm so sorry. i'm so sorry i left you. it wasn't easy for me. don't. i need to say it. when i found out i could read minds, it was a temptation, i was weak. i used people. i was a real scumbag. you... a cop. i'm so proud. you don't get to be proud. you don't get to be anything. you said you tried to save the world.he questions. how? these gifts came out of nowhere. we just found each other, like we were connected somehow. we thought we were invincible. a few of us took that to heart. they started to do whatever they wanted. i did what i could to stop them. like what? this thing we can do, you and i. it only begins at reading minds. and then it becomes so much more. more how? i--i can't explain it. no, hang on. i got something i can show you. 'cause it helped me understand it. yeah, i got a bunch of stuff from back then. it's--it's in here. oh, come on. matt? matt! (parkman) dad? y, what's going on?
