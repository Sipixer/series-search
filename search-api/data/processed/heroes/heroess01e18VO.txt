There are others out there, like you. I can feel them. We'll find them, Mohinder. All of them. It's our destiny. I was surprised to learn that Linderman Group, recently invested in your campaign. How would I be surprise? Mr. Linderman was a good friend of my father's. What Mr. Linderman wants, Mr. Linderman gets. - Has he been located? - The Haitian? Naw. How long was he hiding Claire? I take it it's been months. Just one more thing. When should we be expecting Claire? I'll bring her in now. I wanted to protect you. I tried to be the best dad. I couldn't. This is good-bye. You don't... have to do this. There can't be any doubt cast on your father. Claire, turn around. Cover your ears. I love you dad. I love you Claire-Bear. Go deep. Take anything that would lead them to her. Just on bullet, I can be a hero. Show yourself. I thought she was you. It was supposed to be you. Can't you do something? She's dead. It can't be. It's your fault. You did this. You stop right there. What is the problem? I am here with tour from Osaka. Security just flagged you. You must be some kind of cheat. - What? - You already got a warning. And most people don't even get that. It is okay. I am invited now by Mr. Linderman. Well, in that case... It's all gone. So you honestly don't remember anything? I told you, I'm trying. The last thing I remember is driving home from the hospital with my wife. And after that, it's just-- it's... gray. Blank. So Sprague and Parkman taking your family hostage. Shooting your daughter. A bullet clean through your side. You'd think something there might have made an impression. My daughter is missing. So right now, I don't care if you believe me, or what you do to me. I just want her home, safe. You can kill me if you want. I'm gonna find her! Settle down. You'll tear your new stitches if you're not careful. Well, clearly, your partner's gone rogue, taken a pie slice of your memory with him. He did the same thing to your wife and son. They remember even less. - When can I go after them? - Sorry. I can't let that be your errand. - She's my daughter. - She's an assignment. Or have you forgotten? We gave her to you. Took her out of a bassinet, put her in your hands, and told you to take her home. And that's after you said, "No, thank you." Now, I appreciate you taking an interest in her beyond the needs of the assignment, but... that indulgence ends now. You expect me to do nothing? I expect you to do whatever we ask of you. Well, what do we think? He's telling the truth. He doesn't know anything. Cool. You owe me five bucks. - Come on. - Wait. We had a deal. I help you out, you let me go. Take it easy, Parkman. - We'll get there. - What? You have not said anything all day. I thought you'd prefer it. It's not like you'd tell me where we're going anyway. As soon as I know where we're going, I will tell you. When can I go back to my family? Should I lie to you, and say it will be soon? You know what to run from. Yeah, the people you and my dad work for. What they will do, not even you can recover from. Great. Thanks, Dad. You cannot understand the level of sacrifice he made so you might live. You must honor that. Is it safe to go back? We leave the country, tonight. Subtitles: swsub.com (V.1.00) Sorry, Mr. Petrelli, these men wanted to see you. - They're from the-- - FBI. I'm federal Agent Quesada. This is Agent Alonzo. We'd like to speak with you concerning illegal campaign contributions you may have received from the Linderman group. The FBI is curious why the Las Vegas-based Linderman group would be so interested in helping a New York candidate. My father served as an in-house attorney for the group before he passed away. It's all right. We're clear-- no one's listening. You agreed there'd be no face to face. And you agreed to deliver Linderman. I'm the one who brought you in here, remember? I'd appreciate a little discretion, as opposed to a surprise office visit. No one outside this office knows you're working with us. Linderman's requested a meeting with you at his casino tonight. Any guesses why? I'm still four points behind. He's gonna tell me how he plans to put me ahead, and what's expected of me after I win. Yeah, we were thinking the same thing. And we want you to record it. You want me to wear a wire? You're the only one on our side who can get enough incriminating evidence to put him behind bars. We need this, Mr. Petrelli. And so do you. Otherwise, he walks. We'll contact you when you land in Vegas. How long have you been working with the FBI? Since Heidi's accident. I'm gonna take Linderman down for a long time, Peter. I thought I could be a hero and save the world. Instead, I just killed-- What's that? That's not your blood, is it? Simone. Isaac shot her. She's dead. She's dead. Did you call the police? Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna make an anonymous phone call. You'll have had absolutely nothing to do with it. But I did. She's dead because of me. I don't-- I don't know what to do. That's just it, you don't do anything. Do you understand? This is not the time for you to get noble. Okay? Just stay with me. I ne can't. As long as I'm alive, everyone around me is in danger. We can call Suresh, okay? He can study you. He can-- He's working on a cure. Isn't it too late for that? Wait. Sir, you have your flight to Vegas. Just tell the driver to wait. Oh, there you are. Lyle's watching pay-per-view in the other room. I'm gonna run to the gym before there's an elipto line. I tell you, that flood in our basement has turned into a right vacation for this family. Too bad Claire's missing it all with that cheerleading retreat. Oh, I'm not gonna answer that. I've got the dog hotel giving me hourly updates on Mr. Muggles-- they hate me. Sorry, I have to take a trip. Now? What else? You stay here and take care of Lyle. I'll be back as soon as I can. If anyone comes looking for me-- Stop, you can't go. Why are you whispering? Because you told me to yesterday. I thought you didn't remember yesterday. You told me to pretend that that man took my memory. You took me in the shower, you told me everything. I told you? What you really do, who you work for, and what happened to Claire. Do you know where she is? You know I can't remember. But you told me you were protecting her. You said you sent her away so she'd be safe. And that if you went after her, I should give you this. "Claire's with friends. Don't go after her." This is my writing. All right, look, we can't let anybody know about this. Don't worry, I know how to play dumb. I could never love you enough. You do fine. Puccini? I thought of you more as a John Denver type. That your wife? Your painter friend from New York tried to reach you. I chatted with him for you. Apparently, he's got himself a dead girlfriend. Nice guy. Thompson doesn't need me on this one. I need to be here with my family. This isn't a request. This is an assignment. You do remember assignments, don't you? I'll get my things. Let me guess. Another paper emergency. Huge order mix-up in Fresno. Sorry for stealing your husband, Mrs. Bennet. It's just the he's the best guy we've got in a pinch. I like your hair. So this is the list? Yes. What's left of it. Most of the people are missing, or dead. I want to run your DNA sample against my father's formula, and then take you someplace safe. But this is your father's formula. This is how he made the list, how he found me. Yes, although I haven't figured out what it is looking for. I mean, a specific gene, codons? There are three billion base pairs in human DNA. It's a proverbial needle. Did my DNA help? You've been driving all night. - Why don't you take a break? - I can't. These people are in danger. We have to warn them. - If Sylar gets to them first-- - Exactly. So let me help. I mean, here... This one is in New York. Isaac Mendez-- I'll call him. And you just relax. Just take a minute. You're very kind. Zane, thank you. You have no idea how alone I used to feel. How insignificant. You've given me hope. Hope is great. We need caffeine. So this formula, if you figure it out, how many of us will you find? Who knows? Hundreds, thousands, maybe more. It's busy. I'll get him later. To new friends. This is good. What is it? Chai. It's a special blend my father brought from India. Who are we going to call next? No one. I already have you... Mr. Sylar. Flying man! Not here. Flying man! Let me guess, you're still trying to steal that sword from Mr. Linderman? - Where's your friend? - Ando? I sent him back to Japan. This mission getting too dangerous for him. I think I know what you mean. You can't protect everyone, right? Sometimes it's better to go it alone. The more people you try and help-- The more people get hurt. Please, you must help me. I can't get past casino security giant. When I first met you, I thought you were nuts. It's okay. I thought you were mean. But now I know you pretend you do not care about anyone. But you care too much. It's really important you get your powers back, huh? It is important for everyone. Follow me. - You know who I am? - Of course, Mr. Petrelli. My friend here is making a delivery from me to Mr. Linderman. Something he's expecting. I didn't realize-- You've been around long enough to know what happens when Mr. Linderman doesn't get something he's expecting? Or do I have to paint you a picture? He can take it to the curator. Does that work for you? Vivian Lewis? My name is Vivian, and I'm from Canada?! Are you kidding me? I do not need you happy. Only safe. There's nothing left of me. Everything I am is gonna disappear the second I get on that plane. My friends, my family... me. I can make you forget it all, if that's what you would prefer. There's nothing left for you here. No one to trust. No, you cannot see him again. Peter Petrelli is the only person I know I can trust. More than you. He cares about me. Why can't I hide in New York with him? He's not in a position to be responsible, for you or himself. Come. Boarding pass and I. D. Boarding pass, I. D. Boarding pass and I. D. Sorry, sir, only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond this point. Isaac Mendez, NYPD. We have a few questions for you. Detective Jeff Tracy, NYPD. Do you know this woman-- Simone Deveaux? She and I, we broke up recently. We received an anonymous phone call that she might be hurt. Some of your neighbors said they heard an argument, and gunshots. Mind if we take a look around? What's going on? Something wrong? No, ma'am, apparently not. Sorry for taking your time. You're alive. Lucky you. My... You're very useful. Candice is special, just like you. Then Simone's-- She's traveling Europe, indefinitely, as far as the rest of the world is concerned. There's a crew coming to clean up this mess. How am I supposed to pretend this didn't happen? Maybe you should have thought about that before you shot her... twice. What's the matter, sweetie? You want to shoot me again? Enough. I can't stay here. - Take me with you. - That's not our assignment. Please. - I don't know what to do. - Of course you do. You keep painting. My condolences. Here we go. When did you get so good? I'm unemployed. What do you think I do all day when you're at school? One more? I can't. I'm gonna be late for the bus. So be late. You're not gonna learn anything at school that you don't already know. Love you. You know, you have to admit it, Niki. I do a better you than you. Did you think I wouldn't find out? About what? Where'd you get that? It was on my pillow. Well, I didn't put it there. - Were you digging through my stuff? - Don't turn this around on me, Niki. You said no more secrets. Now I find out you're going to Linderman's casino. For what? - What's he got you doing with this guy? - It's nothing. Linderman called, and he asked me to be a dealer. That's it. You know it's not about dealing cards here. That's all this is. Baby, trust me. I promise you I won't do anything that I don't want to. You left that for him, didn't you? Cute. I can't feel my fingers. It's the curare. It induces paralysis of the brain. Which means you can't control your abilities. Whoever you think I am, I'm not. You are the man who murdered my father. Do you still expect me to believe you're Zane Taylor? Zane was killed three days ago. The same day I met you. And you thought you were so clever giving me his DNA. You're a parasite. You killed my father and fed off his work. Let me hear you say it. Tell me your name! Say it! I want to hear you say it! Sylar! There's only one thing to do with a parasite. Kill it before it kills again. You're just like your father-- murders, the both of you. I'm a scientist. Your father said that, but he kept leading me to them. He had no idea what you were. He knew. He might not have admitted it, but we were making so much progress together, why would he stop? You know nothing about my father! I know everything. He confided in me. He told me things he felt he could never tell you. Things about your sister... Shanti. He thought you were too-- what's the word-- fragile to know the truth. That's why he liked me. You were always seeking his approval, while I provided stimulation. He gave up on you, but he adored me. Now who's the real parasite here?! You're right. My father did want answers. He called you Patient Zero. You're the template he used to create this formula. You're the key to unlocking his secret. As much as I'd like to, killing you will not give me what I need. So what are you gonna do? I'm going to take a sample of your spinal fluid. And it's going to hurt. You might actually do some good before you die. There are so few Dead Sea fragments left in the world. It would be a pity if you crushed this one. So many things. You brought the new Mendez? This one is very special. This painting is ripped... and repaired with Scotch tape. Yes, very special. Is there something else? I need receipt-o for delivery. There are 754 members of the security team in this hotel. All of them with the instructions to drop what they're doing, and come running I push this button. Security code orange activated. That sword you thought you'd steal, do you even realize who it belonged to? Takezo Kensei. He was a hero. Security, sir. This man tried to steal from Mr. Linderman. The big guy says Linderman's gonna be... asking for me in about an hour. I'm not in the mood for craps, so I'm gonna go straight to my room.</i> I guess it's hard to look natural when you're going after the whale. Maybe he'll chat up a few more Japanese tourists. Where the hell is that pizza? Hi. Hi, Agent Alonzo. Quesada. Mr. Linderman sends his regards. And a suggestion. Don't run surveillance on a man from inside his own hotel. It's really tacky. Kick over your guns. Down. It's so much easier working with professionals. I finally found it. That's it, these four simple genes, they answer everything. Now, I-- I can make a new list. I can find them, save them. And what about me? Don't I deserve to be saved? Aren't I just... a victim too? I didn't ask for this. And what would you have me do? Help find a way. Give me salvation. Give me that damn list so I can sink my teeth in! I'm a natural progression of the species. Evolution is a part of nature, and nature kills. Simple, right? What you've done is not evolution, it's murder. What I am doing is revenge. Now I can fulfill my duty as a son. I wasn't begging for my life. I was offering you yours. You are your father's son. So determined, you didn't even notice I stopped the IV. Don't worry, you might actually do some good before you die. Starting with that list. I'm back in my room. I'll be on the floor in an hour. Wearing this could get a person killed. Okay, it's all right. - Easy. - Listen to me. I don't know how much time we have before she comes back. - Who? - Jessica. The woman that they sent after you. You picked the wrong day to screw with me. Linderman knows about the wire, and the FBI-- You know the FBI can hear everything we're saying. No, they can't-- they're dead. Linderman knows that you turned on him. Did you come here to kill me... or warn me? Just trust me. Well, you're back early. Hey, good news. I convinced the hotel to let us keep Mr. Muggles in the room. That is good news. I've been going out of my head thinking everybody's watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake. - Did you find her? - No, I can't do that. If I know where she is, they can extract it from me. But I need you to be strong a little while longer. We both have to pretend that we have no idea what happened so Claire will be safe. - But the company-- - Has to be stopped. For good. That's the only way to make sure that Claire will stay safe. I didn't know that I could talk to you like this. I always just thought that you'd be so furious at me for all the lies and deceit. Right now, we just have to take care of Claire. We'll talk about us later. Must be the kennel. Yes, it is. Yes, he is going to be a problem. Why don't we do it right now? Sorry. I'm sorry, I hope I have the right address. I'm looking for Peter Petrelli. You picked a terrible time to do that. Peter's not here just now. You may as well come inside, Claire. Who are you? I'm your grandmother. And I've been trying to protect you, but you haven't made that very easy. Quite stubborn, aren't you? Just like your father. Linderman hired her to kill the FBI and keep you in line. Who? Let's just say I owe her. He's gonna offer you a deal. If you go in there, you have to take it. Spend the rest of my life with his boot on my neck? - No, thank you. - Then run. Get your family, and run. You said that you had kids. - Two boys? - I can't do that. You don't have any other option. Yeah, I do. I could kill him. Knock me out. Why? So that Jessica knows she's not in control anymore. Who is Jessica? You want this gun? Do it. Not up there. Mr. Linderman won't be meeting you in his office. Do you enjoy vegetables, Mr. Petrelli? I've been known to eat zucchini when the mood strikes, but not as a rule. You know, you can probably hire someone to do that for you. I like to cook-- it's my meditation. One aims for perfection in one's life, but one doesn't find it very often. For me, this is about as close as it gets. Voila! A pot pie. Wholesome, warm, healthy. That's, of course if you can live without cream sauce. Personally, I can't. I mean, what's the point? You know, people can sleep, or they can gamble. Or they can even make love when they're miserable. But I think that most people eat when they're happy. I like to see people happy. Are you happy, Nathan? Not especially. I guess I have a few issues that plague me. Oh, dear, I'm sorry to hear that. You see, I think there comes a time when a man has to ask himself whether he wants a life of happiness or a life of meaning. I'd like to have both. It can't be done. Two very different paths. I mean, to be truly happy a man must live absolutely in the present, and with no thought of what's gone before, and no thought of what lies ahead. But a life of meaning, a man is condemned to wallow in the past, and obsess about the future. My guess is that you've done quite a bit of obsessing about yours these last few days. Now you can't have any of my pot pie. I won't hold it against you. Lots of men have tried to kill me. Then I'll be the last. Of course, you can pull that trigger, Nathan. You'd be taking both of our lives. You'll be dead within moments. Or I could offer you something. I'm not interested in anything you have to offer me. I think you are. I think there are things you need to hear. Things that I know about. Too late for that. That you can fly, for instance? Or about your brother Peter. And his small problem. Your daughter, even. And all those others out there like you. I can offer you more than just information, Nathan. You're gonna win your election. I'll see to that. And two years from now, through a series of fluke circumstances, you will find yourself in the White House. A heartbeat away from the presidency. A life of meaning, Nathan. Think about it. The choice is yours. It's Peter Petrelli.
