Actually... I already know what it's about. You do? It's about wanting to know who you really are. Your mother told me that you've been asking about your birth parents.

Yeah,like hobbies and... skills. You know,I don'T...mean this to be condescending. Even though you're gonna say I'm being condescending. But I really do believe that this is an adult decision. You're right.That is condescending. Claire,there are gonna be issues. You're going to have issues. They're going to have issues. It's very complex,emotionally. Yeah,well,so am I. Well,exactly. Look,here's my advice,if you'll indulge me. Just... keep things light and fun as long as you can. Like cheerleading. Being a cheerleader is hard work. Hard, treacherous work.

Isaac,you can't paint the future. No one will believe you. I'd hoped you would. None of it is real. What is real is,you got a drug problem. You overdosed on heroin last night. You're lucky to be alive. You know,I'm watching my father die. And I can't watch you die too. So you need  to make a choice. Me or this. It's not about having big hands. Most guy's hands are too rough to pick out the details. Mine are sensitive. Feel how soft they are. But you've got dainty hands. My mom says my hands are very dainty. Maybe I should try out for the football team. Claire,may I borrow your ears just for a minute? Why? Hey,zach! Is it true you got an erection  in the boys'  locker room?

What the hell is going on,niki? Something terrible has happened. What?What is it? Those guys that you said that linderman would send to get his money back... Well,he did. And now they're dead. On the floor of my garage. What? How? That's just it. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean I don't know. I just--I woke up,and they were dead and... I think that I might... sometimes I look in the mirror... and I'm not sure it's me that I'm seeing. Maybe it was dl,you know? He's trying to protect you because he still loves you and micah. Dl wouldn't risk coming back. The cops are after him. And once linderman finds out they're dead,it's not gonna matter who killed them. He's gonna come after me. Then you need to listen to me. Niki,you have to call the police. No,I gotta... I gotta cover my tracks. And then I gotta run. I gotta go. why would anybody wanna tap papa saresh's phone? Papa saresh? Yeah,he told me to call him that after I butchered his name a couple times. I don't know why someone would want to tap his phone. Back in madras,I found a man in his apartment stealing his research,and now this. Why don't you just ask your dad? I mean,he must have some idea who it is. My father died four days ago. What? I'm sorry,I... you didn't know? He was murdered in his cab. Oh,my god.How awful. You were close? Yeah... I mean,I hate cooking for one. So I used to make extra and bring it over,and we would...eat together, and he'd tell me about his theories and the map. We were friends. Well... then you were closer to him than I was. I'm happy to hear he had someone to talk to. I'll get you some water. I had no idea anything was wrong. I... I knocked on the door a couple of times. I just... I thought he was out,and we were missing each other. I had this book I wanted to show him. What book? Darwin's origin of species. Thank you. It's a true first edition. I work at this antique book store,and I found a copy,and I just... thought he'd get a kick out of reading it. Well,he most definitely would have gotten a kick out of it. That's very thoughtful. You know,he told me he was being watched. I thought that he was just eccentric. I like that you didn't use the word "paranoid. " Do you think that they're watching you now? They could have killed me,if that's what they wanted. For the time being,it seems I'm more important to them alive. You said that he talked to you about his theories and the map. I need you to tell me everything he said to you. Everything you remember. Everything. girls! This isn't A... criminal investigation. Nobody here is in any kind of trouble. Quite the contrary. There just happens to be  a very grateful man  lying in the hospital who'd like to thank one of you for...saving his life yesterday. I've never seen anyone so  reluctant to be called a hero. You're sure it was one of our cheerleaders? The uniform said union wells high. I'd have to say it was... her on the end. That's claire bennett. claire... where'd  you go yesterday after cheerleading practice? I,uh... it wasn't her. It was me. I was taking a shortcut home from school,and... I saw the wreckage of the train... wreck. And... I just had to help. Why didn't you say something? I guess I didn't want all the attention,you know? That's not why I did it. Well,on behalf of the odessa fire department,I'd like to congratulate you as an honorary firefighter. thank you. How is he? Who? The man jackie pulled out of the train. He's got some pretty bad burns. Smoke damage to his lungs,but... he's alive. Happy to be so. Thanks to jackie. Claire! I'm glad I finally got you alone.Look,we have to talk. Did you hear they asked jackie to be the grand marshall of the pioneer day parade? They're gonna put her on the top of the fire truck. They should put her  under the fire truck. It's about the videotape. What? The videotape! The tape where you're,like,killing yourself like 20 times. Oh,yeah,that.Can we just keep it under wraps? That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was in my backpack,and now it's not. What? It's gone. What do you mean,it's gone? Oh,my god! Claire! I'm so sorry.Are you all right? Yeah. I'm okay. I'm all right. You just caught me off guard. I thought I heard something snap. Nope. I'm okay! I'm fine! I'm okay. all right,that's it! Show's over! Yeah,not a scratch on me. Guess you're not so dainty after all. I'm dainty enough. We have got to find that tape. what if I don't want to go on vacation? You don't have a choice. You have to. Why are we doing this,mom? Why won't you just tell me what's going on? I wish that I could,baby. But you are just gonna have to trust me,okay? Now go in and pack up your stuff. I have to take care of something in the garage. Mom... what happened to our house? Mikey,you're just gonna have to trust me,okay? Now go in  and grab some stuff. Go. in the trunk follow the map Help me understand what you were doing on that roof. I can'T. Not yet.But I will. You just have to trust me. There's something you need to know about your father's death. He committed suicide. What? He committed suicide. I found him on the floor of the bathroom. You said he had a heart attack. I lied. For his reputation,his heart was fine. But he'd had two others before that. Well,I lied about those too. Suicide attempts,both of them. He finally got what he wanted. When he was 23,he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. He couldn't help it.It was just who he was. Why didn't I know about any of this before? Your father and i decided not to tell you since the disorder can have a genetic link, and you were always so sensitive. We didn't want you to worry about it. But you're telling me now. It can start with delusions of grandeur. Thinking you're invincible or indestructible. They are irrational thoughts that then turn suicidal. It's time you took a hard look at your life. And if there are changes to be made,I want to be here to help you. Because there's something else I never told you. You were always my favorite. I cannot lose you. Mr.Isaac mendez? Hello? Mr.Isaac?
