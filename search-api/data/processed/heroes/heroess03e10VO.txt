I'm 10 This is going to tell us what was supposed to do Can we leave Matt out of this? If you are unhappy, we can always arrange you to return you to your formal life Just tell me how am I supposed to do Stay with parkman I came here looking for you and what I find,you are waiting for me That's kidda mean something,right You saved my life once£¬elle. Don't you see I owe you I forgive you Now you need to forgive yourself Auther has probably figured out by now There's a third piece of the formula The catalyst, Hidden away in the blood of a human host I think I'm the catalyst I see we share a facination It seems most of the powers I've documented Took place during the last total-annular eclipse. There's a moment in every war When everything chages The moment when the road bents Alliances and battle line shift And the rules of engagement rewritten Moments like these can change the nature of battle And turn the time Bright the sight So we do what we can To understand them To be ready for change We study our hearts, Curb our fears,master our forces and look for signs And the starts But these moments These game changes Remain a mystery. Destiny's invisible hand Moving pieces on a chessboard. No matter how much we prepare for them, How much we resist the change, anticipate the moment, Fight the inevitable outcome. In the end, we're never truly ready, When it strikes. You're getting pretty good at that. Well, it's not as easy as you make it look. You'll get there. Don't sweat it. Yeah, well, I need to get there now. I have to prove myself. To who? Nobody. I'm not sure that you'd understand. Okay. Then let's go again. Gabriel. I need you to do something. Find claire bennet, Bring her back to me. You think you can do that? Yes, sir. Of course I can. I'm going too. What? Well, they're not gonna make it easy for you, Getting claire. You need help. And I was raised to be a company girl. But I thought you'd left all that behind you. Well, it's all I know. You need help. Let me help you. You okay with this, dad? I think the two of you together, It's a good pairing. Let's go get the cheerleader. Why is it always me? You're the catalyst. Arthur's formula doesn't work without you. I have a plan, but we all have To work together to stop him. Okay, so where's everyone else? Nathan's going to find the haitian. Matt parkman will get hiro nakamura. And you, claire, have the most important part to play. Great. What's my assignment? Your assignment is to keep from getting caught. Just stay out of harm's way. But I can fight. I can do more. I can be more. The only place you're going to be Is underground, off the grid. No! No way! I am done hiding. We all have to make sacrifices. What are you gonna do? Lock me up? Don't think it hasn't crossed my mind. But, no, I have another plan. Hi, claire-bear. It's too dangerous for you to go there alone. I'm just going down there to get the haitian, Then I'm coming right back. The haitian's there to hunt down Level five escapees. This guy, baron samedi, look. Baron? No, it's a alias. Voodoo god of death. This guy's into some bad stuff. Drug trafficking, kidnapping, slavery. I'm telling you, nathan, you're gonna need some help. Hey, I'm not going down there to save the country. Look, hey, just-- You don't understand. Then help me out. When I found my abilities, I knew who I was supposed to be. Okay? But now-- Pete, just because you don't have your abilities-- It doesn't mean you don't have a purpose. It will if you don't take me with you. Nathan. All right. Come on. I need the catalyst. You said you would have it by now. You said you were going to cure me! I've got people on it, But all our plans might be for nothing. What are you talking about? I drew that. It's going to happen today. This is claire bennet. She can't die. It's impossible. That's my point. It can't happen, but it's going to. You're the scientist. You tell me how. There's an eclipse today. Yes. When I first noticed abilities manifesting, There was an eclipse. A global event. You said it was a coincidence. Well, I thought it was, but-- But what? What does it mean? Look, I don't know! But I do know if claire bennet dies, Then the catalyst dies with her And there's no hope for me being cured. That explains this. I'm going to die. Everything's going to change today. I don't understand what hiro nakamura Has to do with any of this. Angela made our orders very clear. Yeah, the guy's a spaz. No, he's a time traveler. If arthur petrelli has us on the ropes, The man is a walking do-over. I know I had hiro's number in his dad's homicide file. Are you nervous about something? Arthur petrelli scares me. Oh, you don't have to be scared about him. Of course I do! He can take away abilities, and I betrayed him! I betrayed you. No. No, you didn't. I'm a betrayer. What? And a liar and a thief and-- I am selfish. You know, honestly, I don't understand why you keep me around! Because you're one of the good guys now. So, you trust me? Yes! Completely? Yes, I trust you completely. I know you, daphne. No, you say that, But you don't know me, not really. We had a life together. In a dream. It was a spirit walk. It wasn't real! Arthur killed your father. He could kill us all or worse! I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Please, just help me find hiro. Come on. How are you gonna do that exactly? That guy's a freakin' teleporter. Hey, I need your help. You have to fix hiro. Look. What does it say? It says, "you have to fix hiro." Arthur petrelli erased his memory. He now thinks he's 10 years old. Oh, it's back there. We're all gonna die. This is stephen canfield's house. You'll be safe here. Out of harm's way. The last time we were here, We almost got sucked into a black hole. What makes it so safe now? Simple set-up. Controllable. Yeah, I know how you like to control things. Okay, I'll bite. What does that mean? It means you'll do whatever it takes To keep the catalyst safe, right? I want to keep you safe, claire. You. Not some catalyst. Do you understand? I understand Aren't you dead? Yeah, you would like that. What's your game, nemesis? I'm not a nemesis anymore. I'm a good guy now. I can't help him. I can't understand him. Well, arthur really did a number on hiro. He really thinks he's 10. So get inside his head and fix him. I don't think I can. He's thinking in japanese. But the comic book says that you-- I don't know what to tell you. This is way beyond me. Hiro is our reset button. Our walking do-over, remember? I know, but he still can time-travel, He can teleport, And he's still very powerful. I can't-- I can't do this. I'm sorry. I got to get out of here. What? What are you talking about? Daphne! You paused. What? When I asked you if you trust me, You paused. No. No, I didn't. I'm a speedster. Fractions of seconds feel like hours to me And you paused. You don't know me And you don't know what I've been through! What is that supposed to mean? Daphne, come on Matt-- Lawrence, kansas. Stop reading my mind! What's in kansas? Come on. Just back off! Your home. Leave me alone! Cool! Do it again,do it again Yes, sir. It'll all be taken care of. Who was on the phone? Arthur. Just updating him on our status. He thinks claire's with her father. Ugh. Glasses himself. Scary. He's not gonna make this any easier. Actually, he is. I didn't want him to get inside my head So he could kill me, but it worked both ways. I know how he thinks. I know where he'll hide her. I'm worried about you. All these "yes, sirs" And checking in like a good little boy. I'm just tryingg to be responsible. Oh, sure. Responsible. Where is this damn rental car guy? Probably calling the police Because I told him you were a serial killer And that you kidnapped me. You must be joking. Why the hell would you do that? Because I'm trying to help you. Because it was wrong of the company To hide our abilities. Because we can do whatever we want. We can take whatever we want. Trust me. Come on, we're going. You're not going anywhere! Oh, god! Oh, help! Please, help. Please. Let go of the girl. Thank you. Oh, god, thank you. Oh, my god. Thank you. Sir, please, put down the gun. You really don't understand what's happening here. She filled me in pretty good, You serially-killing Scum of the earth. They're all trying to make you into something. A boy scout. A monster. Who's it gonna be, huh? Who are you really? Shut up. I should kill you right now. Say it was self-defense. I'll be famous. A bona fide hero. I hate heroes What does this eclipse mean? And how could it possibly affect us? The moon controls the ocean's waves, The sun our internal timing, But something is happening to me. I'm changing. I can feel it. And I can't control it. What's this for? Hit me with it. You wanted me to train you, let's do it. Right here, right now. Is this how you get over your guilt? Because I've been just fine without you. Have you? I caught the puppet guy. Yeah, you got lucky, And you almost got your mother killed. These are serious, dangerous criminals. I know! You're not acting like it. What am I acting like? Like a girl who can't get hurt! Stupid and careless! What do you know? You're the one who left, remember? My absence does not give you license to act like a brat. I have been trying to do something good With my abilities. And I'm trying to keep you safe. I don't need your help! Then hit me! I said hit me! The good news is You've certainly got the strength. The bad news is You're clumsy, slow, and obvious. Thanks. This time, Get your body weight into it. That way all the power will be on the other end of the board. Okay, let's go again. What is this, tae-kwon-do? No, it's baseball. Let's go again. It's tracy. Nathan's veering off plan. He's gone to find this haitian guy. That's smart, using the haitian against me. We can't have that. You're not gonna hurt him? I'm learning today There are some things out of my control. What is that supposed to mean? It's time for nathan to see the world For what it really is. Look, I agreed to help you because you said That we could get nathan into the white house. You need him, arthur. So do you. I need you to go to parris island. Use those connections you've got. I don't take orders from you. If you watch your way into the oval office, You'll do exactly as I say. Parris island? The marine training facility? Every war needs an army. Washington. I guess there's no rest for the wicked. Obviously not. I need hiro to help me find daphne. But she stole the formula. She's a villain. No, she's not. She's just scared. Of what? I don't know, I don't know. But I've got to find out. I told her that I doubted her. I practically packed her bags for her. Look, we need to help hiro, Get him back to normal, stop arthur petrelli-- But it'll only take a minute. All he has to do is teleport me To lawrence, kansas, I grab daphne-- Lawrence, kansas. Lawrence, kansas. Yes, that's us. We're in a corn field. She told me that she grew up on a corn farm. Corn farm? Yeah. Let's go to the corn farm Lawrence, kansas.Let's go Holy crap, it worked. This is it. This is daphne's house. I can hear her thoughts. She's in there. Holy crap! Hey,guys It's starting Pete! Pete, you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Are you? I'm good. What happened? I don't know. I was flying and then I wasn't. I was falling really fast. And now? Nothing. I can't fly. Hey, wasn't there an eclipse that first day you flew? Yeah. So? So, you don't find that significant? The guy we're looking for, the haitian, He takes powers away. Maybe he saw us coming. I don't know. Maybe it's this whole damn country. We got to find him. Come on, let's make tracks. We've got a long walk ahead of us. What the hell are these? Voodoo dolls? Huh? No, they're called pwen. They're messengers. Prayers for salvation. Redemption. Let's go. Looking at the map, Haitian's village is this way. I saw it from two clicks up. We were falling. Yeah. It's still this way. Hey, are you gonna-- Don't you want-- Something I can do for you? Hi. Yeah, um-- I'm a friend of daphne's. Can I talk to her for a second? Daphne's not here. Daphne, I know you're inside! Come on, I just need a minute. Go away, matt. Like I said, she's not home. Why don't you just let me inside? Are you threatening me? Uh, I said... Let me in. Why are you turning your head sideways? What's your problem, son? Psst! What happened? My-- my powers are gone. His powers are gone Nothing.No powers! His also. What's going on? Are you gonna tell me who that was? Nope. I'm not asking a lot of questions here. And I appreciate that. But you've been gone a long time. It's my home. Can't I just come home? Are you feeling okay? No. It's happening again. Ah, sweetheart, I'm sorry. Do you still have them? Yeah, I'll go get 'em. All right, all right. If we double back, We should be able to make it to the village in an hour. You're not even gonna admit you were wrong. You really want to get into this now? Come on. You've got to stop treating me Like your idiot kid brother. You read the map right. Congratulations. I wish I could fly. But you can't. That's right, I'm powerless just like you. Hey, if it wasn't for me, you'd be lost and alone! If it wasn't for you, I'd be home by now. I only brought you down here to protect your fragile ego. You know what? I don't need your pity. No, but you know what you do need? My help. I've been saving your ass my entire life. Is that so? That's right. When you jumped off that roof like a moron, Who caught you? Who pulled you out of kirby plaza When you were about to blow up? You want my respect? You want my approval? Earn it! Why would I want your respect? You're a puppet! Excuse me? You have no spine. I'm a u.S. Senator. You're a nurse. You're everything that dad ever wanted you to be. His dreams, huh? His goals. He could always find a way to get under your skin And manipulate you and use you. Where's this coming from? In the future, you choose him. You choose dad, nathan. Well, I'm down here right now, pete. I'm trying to stop him. Now help me. Good! Control first, follow through second. You feel that power? Again. Tell me what you're thinking. No. All right, tap into that anger. It'll give you strength. Here, take a swing at me now. I don't want to swing at you. Come on. Swing at me! See if you can hit me. Let's go. Come on. You're not even trying, claire. Tell me what you're thinking. Every time you would come home from a trip, I'd always hug you as hard as I could. Because I thought if I held you tight enough, You wouldn't leave me again. Why did you always leave?! I need to get some air. Claire, wait a minute. Let's talk about this. No, I didn't mean to bring it up. Just forget it. Hey, girls. You have the haitian in here? No, just me. Back out of the house, now. You're not getting claire. Funny story. We are. Claire, stay back! Claire! Sandra! Oh, my god. What happened? She got shot. Why isn't she healing? I don't know. Something's wrong. Her abilities aren't working. We have to get her to a hospital. No! They report gunshot wounds to the police. They'll ask questions. She is bleeding! She is hurt! I'm calling 911. And what happens when her healing comes back? Noah-- This is a surface wound. We can deal with it. Hang up the phone, please! I'll get the first aid kit. Thank you. What happened? I don't know. I wish I did. Maybe you were right. I've been stupid, careless. I thought I was invulnerable. Claire, you shouldn't have-- It hurts. I never thought I'd be able to hurt again. Uhh, it sucks, But it's wonderful. Thank you for saving my life. Anytime. Nothing, No powers. Still no powers. Yeah, that much I get. Why is this happening? How do we get it back? Maybe daphne was right. Maybe arthur took them away. You know, I never, ever thought That I would miss my-- Right now, all I want to do Is just know what's going on inside her head. What are we supposed to do? Do? You must do what you came here to do! He says you must save daphne. I can't! I...Can't! Not without my brain thingy. He says he can't. He can't? What? This is a part of the Hero's Quest. Can you triumph without powers? Can you triumph without powers? Hey, seriously, dude, stop it. He's going to hurt you. How do you say "stop it"? You must not doubt your mission. The corn will keep on coming. Only you have the power to stop it. You must not doubt! See! You did it! Please don't hurt me. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm gonna save daphne. He's going to save her. Holy crap While he's doing that... We will get our abilities back. You can do that? I have a plan. Where did you learn all that stuff about the corn and the Hero's Quest? Saturday Samurai Matinee Showdown. We've reached the end of the comic book. We must find the next issue. How? Every town and city around the world... Has a place where the wise men gather. The Greek oracle at Delphi. The Library at Alexandria. The hall of Justice. How do we know where to find them? Just trust me... It's a miracle. Complete remission. All effects of the formula have disappeared. Scales, abilities, I have no idea how or why. Some correlation to the eclipse? Further study is warranted. But not yet. You're not going anywhere. Now we know the meaning of the eclipse. Everyone's abilities have gone away. You have to get them back. I'm not sure that's entirely possible. I mean, who knows what the implications Of this event are? They could be irreversible. That's unacceptable. What are you doing?! Without abilities, I'm nobody. I already been nobody. You understand? So, we gonna stay right here Until you get it all back for us. This is your plan? She was right. We'er all going to die. No, we're not. It's Wednesday. So? New comic book day! This comic got us this far... The new one will tell us what's next. Ask if they have the latest issue. Excuse me? Be with you in a second. Don't worry. We got plenty of red hulks for everybody. Sam? Yeah? Dude, this is so awesome. All of our questions will be answered. Is he always this quiet? I don't know. Why don't you ask him? I really appreciate your help, But we need to get you back home. My father's alive. Arthur's alive? You're one of the only people who can stop him. Now the sooner you take this juju off of me, The sooner I can fly us home And deal with him. I'm not responsible for your condition. My ability is gone as well. The universe has decided our fate. Can the universe get me a phone? I can call the military, get us on a c-130, Get this sorted. I'm not going anywhere until I stop samedi. The guy from level five. I am responsible for his evil. He is my brother. Like us, special. His skin is impenetrable. By knife, and by fire, And by bullet. Many people here believe him to be a god. He uses fear to form an army. They murdered, stole, kidnapped. I stopped him once, put him away, but now... Hey, you can't do this on your own. Peter, this is not your fight. You helped our family out once. At least let us repay that favor. Hey, look, all right, you proved You can be brave, okay. Don't be stupid. Think about it, nathan. The only way to get this guy to come back home with us Is if we help him stop his brother. Look, if you're not gonna do this for the right reasons, At least do it for the selfish ones. Go! Go! Run! Je m'appelle, nathan petrelli. Je suis american. We know all about you, senator nathan petrelli. Your father warned us you'd come. My father? Yes. What did he tell you? He told me to be myself. Hey, no fever. You feeling okay? Pretty good, all things considered. We're gonna figure out what's happening to you. But for now, you just rest. I'll be right downstairs. I love you, dad. I love u, clair bear No. No what? You're leaving, aren't you? Do not leave your daughter. Not now. She's fine. She's scared. She doesn't know what's happening. She needs you. Oh God, Claire Daphne? Daphne, I'm not leaving until I talk to you. Go away, matt. No. No, I came here because I know exactly who you are. You are smart and beautiful And funny. I don't even care if the-- the spirit walk is all a bunk. I'm not gonna-- I'm never gonna give up because-- Because I'm in love with you. Daphne! The door's open. Daph? I'm in here. I just didn't want you to see me like this. Like what? Like this. Hi, sweetie. Claire. Aah! Oh, god! Oh, it hurts! Well, it's gonna hurt forever If I can't set it. Stop being such a baby! Oh, thanks. What's happening to us? I have no idea. I used to understand everything, but... Nothing makes sense. We're just human. You okay with that? It's actually a relief. I felt the hunger, The need to have powers, so numbing. My mind felt like it was full of cotton and ice. I haven't felt like this since-- Since I first met you. I pushed you to become that monster. It's my fault. No. You were just following orders, A company girl. Exactly! We're both so--
