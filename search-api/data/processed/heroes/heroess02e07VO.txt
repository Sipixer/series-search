She Thinks She Loves You. Poor, Pitiful You. You Are Supposed To Be A Hero. After I Lead White Beard's Army To Victory, I Will Be The Greatest Leader Japan Has Ever Known. I Will Change History. Hello. (Mr. Bennet) Have They Given You A Gun?</I> What Are You Talking About? A Gun. Company Issue. Where Have You Been? I Need To Talk To You. I Found The Paintings.

These Paintings Are Al.Om I Need You To Help Me Make Sense Of Them. I'm Gonna Forward Them To You Right Now.</I> Don't, That's What I've Been Trying To Say. They've Given Me A Partner. That's Just Standard Protocol. It Isn't.</I> She's Here To Watch Moev My Ve Iake. They Don't Trust Me. My Family Is In Danger. So That Makes Me Expendable? We Were Supposed To Take The Company Down Together, But You--I Don't Know What Your Agenda Is Anymore. (Niki) Dr. Suresh.</I> I Have To Go. Bob Needs To See Us. I Get It. You Don't Want A Partner.

Matt? I Thought You Were Gonna Find Your Father. I Did. He Attacked Angela Petrelli. My Father Killed Kaito Nakamura.</I> He's Killing Them All. And Now He's Coming To Kill Bob. (Peter) Hello! Hello! Hello! (Caitlin) There's No One Here, Peter. They've All Gone. Evacuated By Homeland Security. Peter, What Did You Do? Me? I Didn't Do Anything. Are You Sure? We Were In Montreal.

I Wanted To Bring You Breakfast. I Hope You Don't Mind. Why Would She Mind? Uh, Because He Wasn't Invited, And Some People Think That's Rude? Nonsense. Your Dad And I Love Meeting Your Friends. Will Mr. Butler Be Joining Us? Sadly, No. His Business Trip Was Extended.</I> Something About Something I Wasn't Paying Any Attention To. Lyle, Get Your Butt Out Of Bed! He's Adorable. Why Would You Come Here When I Told You Not To? I Had To Show You Something. Check It Out. We're Infamous. Drunk Cheerleader Suspended. Claims That She Saw A Boy Fly.</I> What Are We Gonna Do? People Are Gonna Know It Was Us. How? It's A Blurb. On The Last Page Of The Local Flavor Section. It's No Big. It Is Big. You Can't Just Do Whatever You Want Whenever You Want. I Just Wanna Be A Part Of Your Life. Okay. But Just For Waffles. How Do You Know Your Father's Coming To Kill Bob? Isn't This All A Bit Reactionary? No. Matt's Right. Security Just Found His Car Ditched Off The Road Maury Could Be Here Right Now. I'm Taking You Into Protective Custody. My First Priority's To Keep You Safe. You Can't. You Couldn't Keep Angela Petrelli Safe. She Almost Killed Herself On Your Watch. No, We Stop Maury Here Now. You Realize That Makes You The Bait. We All Have Our Roles To Play. That's What Linderman Used To Say. My Mother Too. It's Always These Half-Truths. No Straight Answers. Constant Manipulation. I'm Trying To Help Everyone Here. How, Bob? What The Hell Did You People Do?</I> Why Is Maury Coming Here To Kill You? Now Is Not The Time To Recount The Past. But To Focus On The Task At Hand. All Right! Fine, So We Stay Here. How Do We Stop My Father? Dr. Suresh, I Need You And Niki To Inject Maury With The Virus. Virus? What Virus? The Virus Takes Away Abilities. It's Also Potentially Lethal. You Said We'd Never Use It Again. Circumstances Have Changed. I Will Not Knowingly Spread This Virus. Maury Is A Killer. He Knows Your Thoughts, Your Nightmares, And He Could Turn Your World Inside Out. We Take Away His Abilities, And Then You Can Cure Him With The Antibodies In Your Blood. No One Dies Here Today. He's Not Gonna Exactly Volunteer For A Shot. I Can Be Persuasive. I Appreciate The Thought. But This One Goes To You, Matt. What? Me? All I Can Do Is Read Minds. No, No, No, No. You Have The Same Abilities As Maury Has. Anything The Brain Controls, You Control. No. Senses, Actions, Thoughts-- No! No, I Can't. I-I-- I Can't Do Any Of That Stuff. Well, Then You Better Learn Fast Because You're The Only One Who Could Stop Your Father. I Should Never Have Forged Those Guns. White Beard Will Conquer Japan. It Is All My Fault. We Are Not Finished Yet. They Always Underestimate Women. Their Folly. I Am A Sword-Smith's Daugtter... Hiro! Hiro! You Must Concentrate! You Have To Get Us Out Of Here. Why Is Everything So Purple? Get Back To Your Post. White Beard Doesn't Tolerate Laziness. Please...Please. Please...Please. Ca Itlin! Ca Caitlin! Caitlin! Peter Petrelli? According To These Files, You're A Dead Man. What? I Got Your Death Certificate Right Here. So... You're Gonna Have To Explain To Me, How's A Dead Man Walk Around New York City With No Sign Of Infection? Infection? I Don't Know What You're Talking About. Where's Caitlin? I Need To See Her. She's From Ireland. All Foreigners Are Deported. You Can't Do That! Who The Hell Are You People?</I> What's Going On Here? You Really Don't Know. On March 20th, 2007 The First Case Was Reported. After That The Shanti Virus Spread Across The Globe. A Pandemic. It's Killed 93% Of The World's Population To Date. The Rest Of Us Live In Quarantine Praying To Find A Cure. This Can't Be Happening. I Wish It Wasn't. All These People Died From The Virus? Yeah, It's Been A Tough Week. (Matt) I'm Supposed To Be Out Hunting Down Maury,</I> But I Needed To See You. I Never Should Have Asked You To Use Your...</I> Ability To Find My Dad. You Were Just Tryin' To Make Me Happy. I Know That Feeling. When My Dad Left I... I Blamed Myself. I Thought That I Was... Too Slow... Too... Fat. Too Stupid. I Thought That If I Was... Better, Or If I Was Smarter, He Woulda Stayed. And Now They Want Me-- They Think That I Can Stop Him, That I've Got This Power. And I Don't. I Don't. I Need You To Hear. I Need You To Know That I Love You. Did You Just Hear Me? Molly? [Matt's Thought] I Love You, Molly. What's Left Of The Virus Is In The Lab. Each Syringe Contains Only One Dose, So Use It Wisely. You Don't Trust Bob, Do You? Did He Put You Up To This? I Put Me Up To This. I Wanna Hear Your Side. Bob Is Morally Gray At Best. And The Virus? He's Toying With A Death Sentence. You Have The Cure. No One Dies. Just Because He's A Safety Net Doesn't Make It Ethical. So You Would Make A Different Choice? Morally Un-Gray? I Killed A Lot Of People... Brutally Ripped Them In Half. They Could Have Given Me The Virus, But They Didn't. They've Made Me Right, So That I Could Have A Life. Go Home To My Son. You're Never Gonna Have A Life. You're Not Cured. You're A Killer. And Before This Day Is Over You're Gonna Kill Everyone. (Suresh) Niki?</I> Go On. Tell Him What You're Seeing. He'll Think You've Gone Crazy Again. And Then You'll Never See Micah. Is Everything All Right? Let's Go. (Nathan) I Know These Other Families.</I> Linderman, Nakamura, Pratt, Deveaux.</I> Everyone Who's Been Killed. But I Don't Know This One.</I> Who Is He? Who's Adam Monroe? Adam Is...Complicated. So Un-Complicate It. Adam Convinced Us That We Belonged Together. That We Could Make The World A Better Place For Our Children... For You. "Snow Falls On Miami." I Don't Get It. That Headline Could Have Read "Tsunami Wipes Out Eastern Seaboard." What Does Any Of This Have To Do With The Murders? Adam Is The One Who's Trying To Kill Us. I Thought Maury Parkman Was-- Maury's The Weapon. He's The Blunt Instrument. Adam Was The Visionary. But With These Abilities, Sometimes People Tend To Think Of Themselves As Gods. Did You Ever Think That, Nathan?</I> Adam Did. And He Began To Talk About Holocausts, Plagues. Punishing Humanity In Order To Save The World.</I> Sounds A Lot Like Linderman. Linderman Was Adam's Disciple. Adam Was Dangerous. So We Locked Him Up. We Threw Away The Key. Two Weeks Ago He Escapes. And Now He Wants Revenge. It Sounds Like You're Reaping What You Sow. Why Should I Care? Because Of Peter. Listen, Pal, You Wanna Talk About My Brother, You Better Be Very Careful What You Say Next. Peter Is Alive, Nathan. Your Brother Is Alive. I'll Leave You Two Alone. Do I Know You? They Brought Me Here To Help You, Peter. You Need To Remember Who Yoyou Are. I Need To Find Caitlin. You Need To Focus. You Can Move Objects With Your Mind, Heal, You Can Paint The Future. How Do You Know About That? You Absorb Abilities From Other People. You Are The Most Powerful Of Us All. You're A Kind And Caring Soul. Selfless. Always Thinking About Others. But Now You Need To Think About Yourself And Fly Into The Face Of Danger. Just Like Your Brother. I Have A Brother. He Died In The First Outbreak. But You-- You Can Change That. How? I Was In Montreal In 2007. The Next Thing I Know, I'm Here. You Met A Man Named Hiro Nakamura. He Can Travel In Time. So Can You. You Can Change History. -I Can't. -You Must! I Can't Control These Things That Are Happening To Me! Then This Virus Will Kill Us All. Peter, You Need To Remember. Focus.</I> O  You Need Tremember. Mom? Do The Marks Hurt? No. They're Kinda Just There. Painless Souvenirs Of My Alien Abduction From The Guy With Horn-Rimmed Glasses. If You're Gonna Be Dropping In, There's Something I Need To Tell You. I Get It. Get What? I'm Moving Too Fast. We Don't Have To Go Any Further If You Don't Want To. You Know What I Want? Popsicles.

His Heart Is Broken. Pain Has Made Him Cruel. But,He Is Good Inside. You Would Risk Your Life For Your Faith In Him? It Won't Be Safe For You Here. Meet Me Under The Cherry Blossoms. Wait For Me. All This Trouble Over One Drop Of Liquid. This Virus Could Kill An Entire Species. Or It Could Stop Maury And Save Our Lives. Poor Niki. So Vulnerable. You're Perfect. Show Me Your Nightmares. Show Me Your Thoughts. Show Me Your Soul. How Do I Turn You Into A Killer? Nothing's Going To Save You. This Company Is Bad. You're Not Making Up For Your Sins. You're Diggin' Deeper Into Hell, And Worse, You're Gonna Drag Micah Right Down With You. You're Wrong. They Said That They Would Help Me. Niki, What Are You Talkin' About? I Was Sick. I'm Still Sick. How Can You Say That? Because You're Dead. No, I'm Not. They Don't Want Me Talkin' To You. They're Using You, Nik. Just Like Linderman. Just Like Jessica.</I> You Can Still Do The Right Thing. You Have To Kill Him. That's The Only Way You Can Save Micah. Niki, You're Talking To Yourself. I Think It's Maury. We Need To Call Bob. I Thought You'd Come Here. This Many Guns In Japan, They Will Crush History. I Cannot Let White Beard Win. Sll Ctoth Stop This... Together. We Did Make A Good Team, You And I. You Showed Me How To Be A Hero.</I> How To Love. And Then... You Took It All Away. Do It, Hiro. Stop Time. Kill Me. Cut Off My Head. I Will Not Do It. I Still Have Faith In You. The Honorable Hiro Nakamura. He Won't Kill You. He'll Just Lie, Cheat, And Steal. I Wanted To Help You Become A Hero. I Never Claimed To Be Anything More Than A Happy Drunk. Do Not Punish Thi Only Want For To Punish You, Hiro. Yaeko Was Right. She's Not Destined To Be My Princess. She's Destined To Die. No! Ah! Yah. Take My Hand. We Must Get Out Of Here Now. Never! As Long As I Have Breath, Anything You Love, I Will Lay To Waste. I Swear. You Will Suffer. Peter's Alive, Nathan. This Was Taken Three Months Ago Right Here. Is He Here Now? No. He's Gone. Gone Where? What Is It You're Not Telling Me?</I> I Need To Know Everything. He Was In Cork, Ireland, And Then We Lost Track Of Him. Lost Track Of Him? How Do You Lose Someone? How Do You Lose Someone? Dad! Matt! Molly. What Are You Doing In Here? Where Are We? This Is Where He Keeps Me. What? When I Tried To Find Your Dad, He Locked Me In Here. Now We're Both Trapped. No. No, We're Not. Dad! Dad! Matt? Did You Bring Me Here? I Think... I Think I Did. Step Back, Nathan. I Got It. Don't Do It, Niki. This Isn't You.</I> Don't Do It. How Can You Defend Him? He Killed D.L. I Didn't Kill Anyone. It's Maury. He's Gotten Inside Of Your Head. Listen To Me, This Is A Nightmare. This Isn't You. Don't Be His Puppet! You're Stronger Than This. You Came Here To Get Control</I>Of Your Life. Don't Let Maury Undo All Of That. Listen To Me. Listen To Me. Think Of Your Son. Think Of Micah. Think Of Your Boy. I Couldn't Get The Nightmare Out. I Didn't Know What Else To Do. I Had To Stop Myself. Matt. Don't Be Scared, Molly.
