And i'm not sure where it's headed. But one thing is certain. I have been given a second chance. Touched by god. And i've got to believe that he has a purpose for my life. So why am i filled with self-Doubt? Plagued by demons real and imaginary? Frightened by the challenges ahead, And haunted by the ghosts of my past? Does god know what i am? Do i? Am i an angel or a monster? A hero or a villain? And why can't i see the difference? Did i startle you? Drink? That's right. Because you're not really here, are you? Whatever makes you happy, nathan. You know what would make me happy? Some straight answers. Like how you knew she was in trouble. You mean tracy. You said she needed my help, That she was my path. Next thing i know, she's taking a header into the potomac. And you were there to save her. Now i suppose you're wondering why. I mean, was it luck? Was it coincidence? Or perhaps guidance from a higher power. You're not a messenger from god. Moses saw a burning bush. Mary heard the angel. God came to samuel in his dreams. And i've got a dead mobster Telling me he's the voice of god. You think the answers to your questions Are somehow outside of you, nathan. But... God resides within. The answers will come. (Tracy) nathan?</i> Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just clearing my head. Yo, what up? What you need? What do you got? White lightning, base, angel dust. No, i need something to take the edge off. All right. I got just the thing. I don't need your drugs. I need you. You have the hunger. You're just like me. I will never let myself become you. You already are. Brother. No! I can't be you. (Angela) peter, stop!</i> You don't know what you're-- You don't know what you're doing. I know... Exactly what i'm doing. When were you gonna tell me that sylar's my brother? What other secrets are you hiding from me, mother? Tell me your secrets! Or i'll rip open your head and i'll take 'em out myself. No! [Angela screams] Are you okay? Is he gonna be all right? Yes. I'll make sure of it. We got a lead on a new target. You want me to come with you. Don't make this harder than it already is. Oh, god. Oh, god. Sandra? Crap. What's going on? Claire lied. There was no cheerleading retreat. Now she's not answering her cell. I'm so dang stupid. She's obviously gone after one of them. That's all she's been talking about, Wanting to help, no thanks to you. Okay, calm down. How can i be calm? Look at them. They're monsters. Claire can't get hurt, remember? Oh, no? How about this guy? Stephen canfield. He creates vortexes. Makes people disappear forever. Even claire. All right, we'll find her. Oh, no. What is it, meredith? We just better hope it's not him. Why? Who is he? His name's eric doyle. He's a horrible man. You don't even want to know. No, his place isn't too far from here. I'm gonna start by looking for her there. I'm coming with you. Sandra. She's my daughter. Can you do this? I'll have claire home before you know it.</i> You think i wanted to leave my family? I had no choice. Just tell me where they are. You're her sister. Damn it, you know where she is. I got the right to see her and my kids. [Dial tone] Grr! [Footsteps] Hello? Is someone there? [Taser whining] behind you. Unh! I need...your...help. My help? You buried me alive. Why in bloody hell would i help you? [Choking] Let me out of here! You sawed off little japanese cretin.</i> I will give you another chance If you behave. Okay? Okay. We are searching for a formula that-- Formula? Heh! I knew it would come back To bite them in the ass someday. Even i told them to destroy it. So you know who would steal it? Maybe. If i tell you, what's in it for me? When we finish our mission, I promise to put you in a more spacious cell. With a window. And a vent. Forget it. Okay, back you go. Wait! You little japanese nazi! Let me think. Just off the top of my head, I'd say your villain is angela petrelli. She asked us to find the formula. I see. Well, i'm fresh out of ideas. Fine. (Adam) wait!</i> I know how to find your big villain.</i> And get you your formula. I have a plan.</i> Na? How do you feel about recruiting? Recruiting for what? An organization for a new world order. Daphne, you and i are standing on the precipice For real change. A world where people like you are embraced. Your gifts acknowledged and respected, not ignored. I mean, you'd like to be part of a world Where you can really be somebody, wouldn't you? As long as i get paid. What do i have to do? (Linderman) there are others like you out there. Just invite them to join us. Everything you need to know is right here. These are some pretty nasty people. I don't like getting my hands dirty. They've merely lost their way. It's time for us to give them purpose. [Flipping through radio stations] Just...sit. Just so you know, this was her idea, not mine. You mean my mother? If it was up to me, i'd have left you to rot. No forgiveness, is that it? You terrorized my daughter. You killed countless others, including a target That had valuable information. Rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight. I am trying. I understand. Killing is just in your nature. What's going on? What do you think? I'm bringing you back to level five Where you belong. Please, don't do this. I need to find my family. From the looks of things, they're long gone. What do you expect? Your company dragged me away in the middle of the night. I didn't even get to say good-Bye. They put me away for almost two years. My family must think i abandoned them. That's what happens to people like you. They put you away so the rest of us can be safe. I made one mistake. You're like the others. So quick to judge. You want to believe i'm a monster. You killed someone. You are a monster. You're wrong. And you need to listen. [Front door closes] (Maya) mohinder?</i> Hey, there. You didn't come home last night. What's this? A flyer. It was stuck in your door. Did you know your neighbor was missing? I'm getting closer, you know. This next stage in my research,</i> It could be the answer to taking away your ability. I can make you happy, maya. I...should let you get back to it. Your company has got it all wrong. I never meant to hurt anyone. [Cell phone rings] [Beeps] Who's this? Your partner? I don't have a partner. What are you talking about? "One of us, one of them," right? Company policy. You're not with the company, are you? Are you with them? Who the hell are you? Come in here and shoot me, hold me hostage. You know about me. I read your file. You killed a man. That was an accident! Your neighbor, right? Over what? A broken lawnmower? We got into an argument. It got heated. I overreacted. Next thing i knew, he was gone. I didn't want to hurt him. They locked me away. No lawyer, no trial. I love my wife. I love my children. I just want to see 'em again. Hold them. Even if it's for the last time. I just want to be normal. You don't understand. Now just--Just go. You're...letting me go? Yeah. Just give me a head start Before you call your friends at the company. Maybe i can help. You tried to kill yourself. How do i know you're not gonna do it again? What do you want from me, nathan? Undying gratitude? Thanks. You're my hero. I want to know what you were doing on that bridge. I can't talk about it. Why not? Who's gonna understand better than i am? Just tell me. What happened? I killed someone. Who? A reporter. He threatened to run a story Saying that i was niki sanders. When there was no way that i could reason with him, I got-- I got angry. I reached out to grab him... Froze him. He shattered. It was an accident, tracy. I need to turn myself in. That's probably not a good idea. What are you gonna tell them, tracy? Who's gonna believe you? I can fly, but i can't talk about it. Well, then i'll show them. You can't do that. Listen, i've been there. I understand. I-I wanted to tell the world. I even called a press conference. What happened? I got shot. I died. And then i saw god. And i truly believe with all my heart That he's got a higher purpose for us. You think god gave us these powers? If he didn't, who did? A doctor in reseda, california. This is the last number the company has for them. It's the same area code, so they can't have gone far. Thanks, claire. For everything. Hi, baby. It's me. Wait, don't hang up. Look, i know you're scared, But, uh, i love you. I need to see you and the kids.</i> Well, then meet me, anywhere. The griffith park carousel. Great. Man, i can't wait-- Hello? Hello! What happened? We were cut off. Claire? Dad? He's your father? You set me up? No, i swear. Back off! Drop the gun. Let go of the girl! Sylar. Dad, what is he doing here? Let her go, canfield. You don't stand a chance. Stand back. Last warning. I didn't know. I'm sorry. It's not over yet. Hold on to something. Stand back, i will shoot! [Grunting, screaming] (Mr. Bennet) hold on, claire.</i> Claire, hold on. Dad! Help! Dad, help! Claire! Don't let go. Dad! Unh! You okay? Peachy. Oh, thank god. You okay? Target's gone. Well, he can't be far. Claire. Where did mr. Canfield go? Leave him alone. He doesn't want to hurt anyone. This isn't a game. He's very dangerous. Who are you to talk? Bringing him here? Tell me you're not working with him</i> After what he did to me. Claire, you hate me. I understand. When i touched your hand, I could feel the pain that i caused you And i never meant for you-- Shut your mouth now. You don't get to talk to her. Ever. Look... We'll talk more about this when we get home, But right now you have to tell me Where mr. Canfield went. He's not a killer. He's having problems like i had problems. He just--He didn't have you to help him. All right. Okay, then just... Let me talk to him. If what you say is true, We'll make other arrangements. You can trust me, claire. I wouldn't send anybody to level five That doesn't belong there. He's at the griffith park carousel. [Rock music] * * This is your plan? Go to a bar? I haven't had a drink in months, And they make a mean appletini. I'm warning you, adam monroe. I'll pop you right back into your coffin. Relax. You said the speedster girl was hired, right? Well, this bar is the go-To destination Of specials for hire. Specials for hire? That's right. Ooh, like the cantina. Yeah. I never knew there was such a place. Can we find out who hired the speedster? Hello. That's why we're here. Just leave everything to me. And try and... Look tough. [Speaking japanese] Barkeep, the usual, And make it snappy. Hello, milosh. How dare you come in here? Look, i didn't know she was your wife. And for the record, she never mentioned it. (Nathan) what happened to peter?</i> I put him in a medically induced coma. What? Your brother tried to kill me. Why? He took sylar's ability, And now he's suffering the consequences. We're in a lot of trouble, nathan. Mom, it's tracy strauss. Tracy, my mom. I know who she is. And why she's come. I heard you saw dr. Zimmerman. How do you know dr. Zimmerman? He worked for the company many years ago In research and development. Very bright. Then you understand what he did to me. You can help me. No, i'm afraid that's not possible. His work was classified. You want me to go public with this? What are you hiding, mom? Zimmerman was instrumental In the company's development of synthetic abilities. Synthetic. We used the technology on a number of infants. You were one of them, tracy. As were your sisters, niki and barbara. And you, nathan. We gave you your ability too. God... What have you done? Oh...my...god! Gotta get you out. [Door closes] oh! [Deep breath] Unh! Maya! I know you're in here. Unh! You have to control your power. You don't want to be a killer again, do you? Ohh. What have you done? [Speaking japanese] [Hiro speaking japanese] Unh! It's done. What do you want me to do about the two japanese guys? It's all here. The testing, the experimentation. Everything they did to us. It wasn't god. We were trying to be better than god. How? By using people as...lab rats? Your own son. Your father was disappointed That you weren't born with the genetic code. But we thought because of your lineage, Your system could handle it. And obviously we were right. Then what about me? My parents were dead. I had no one to protect me. Tracy, what this company did to you In the name of science was wrong. We know that now. And that is why we divided the formula And hid it so this would never happen again. An innocent man is dead because of what you did to me. Then help me. Because someone has stolen the formula. They want to restart this project. They want to create a world filled with dangerous people. Deadly, out of control. They will destroy everything. Please help me stop them. Go to hell. Nathan, it's why peter took sylar's ability. It's why--It's why he sacrificed himself. He knows what's gonna happen to this world. You do not understand. I understand, ma. I understand. You locked peter up. Put a shunt in his head. You did experiments on me. And god knows who else. Peter? Claire? Who else did you use As your own personal guinea pig? [Trailing off] nathan, listen to me. Nathan. I'm sorry. What's next? I know a scientist. He understands all of this genetic stuff. If anybody can help you, he can. Can he be trusted? Suresh? Yeah, he's harmless. (Claire) stephen?</i> It's claire. I talked to my dad. He said he's willing to listen. It doesn't matter anymore. What happened? They never showed up. You were right, claire. My wife...my kids... They're afraid of me. Maybe i am a monster. Couldn't put it better. Dad, what are you doing? It's all right. We're just talking. I'll make you a deal, stephen. My partner is standing right over there by my car. You make him disappear, And this is all over. I don't understand. You want me to kill your partner? Do it, and i'll let you go. I give you my word. What are you saying? You do not have to do this. Stay out of this, claire. (Stephen) she's right, i can't.</i> I'm not a killer. Maybe not. But he is. And he needs to be destroyed. Unfortunately, i can't do it.</i> Please, i just-- I'm not asking. Dad, no! I'm doing this for us, claire. For what sylar did to you.</i> You people... You've taken everything from me. Do it. Kill him now! What are you doing? I won't be a monster. No! [Speaking japanese] Hello, boys. Nemesis. So...my friend here Tells me that you're looking for work.</i> And i said, that's not possible. Those goody two-Shoes. We heard about what you are doing. Sign us up. I'm not convinced. We have changed. We are badasses now. Yes, we are very badass. When do we start? Not so fast. You have to prove yourself worthy. How do we do that? You're the one with the powers? Yes. I control time and space. Cool. Kill the other one. (Hiro & daphne) kill ando? Yeah, he has no powers. What good is he to us? You kill him, you are badass. I'm sorry, my friend. I must make some sacrifices... To save the world. [Gasps] Hiro. We'll talk more when i come home, okay? Claire, wait. I know you're-- You're disappointed, But i did what i had to do...for us. She doesn't believe a word you're saying. She knows exactly what you did back there, Why didn't take down stephen canfield When you had the chance. Nobody's talking to you. Claire finally sees you for what you are--A user.</i> Isn't that right, claire? You used her to try to find that poor man. Then you used him to try to kill me Because to you... I'm nothing but a monster. He doesn't see our humanity, claire. He never will. Claire, wait. You're not gonna listen to him, are you? The man is a deranged sociopath. He's a killer. He's a monster. Yes. And you are my daughter. And everything i do Is to protect you. To protect this family. Tell me you understand that. I understand. It's all gonna be okay. I promise. Mom. (Sandra) claire!</i> Thank god. I was so worried. Are you okay? 'Cause if you are, you are so grounded. I'm sorry. I'm just glad meredith found you. Meredith? (Man) enjoying your dinner, my dear?</i> Eat. Hmm! Now... give me a sweet kiss. Go to hell, you filthy-- Ah! Mmm. Oh. [Woman screams] My god. [Gasps] Peter, tell me you didn't do this, please. Oh! Ohh! (Man) hello, angela.</i> No...it can't be. You can see the future. I can't have that. It's too dangerous. No, you won't succeed. I'll stop you. Don't be ridiculous. You won't even be able to move. [Heartbeat] (Man) you won't even be able to move. You're late. Have you completed your task? They're onboard. Even the japanese guy. Look, i'm not happy about what happened. That's not what i signed up for. I'm not a killer. It's all part of making the world A better place, daphne. No pain, no gain. There's another one You're going to have to recruit. I'm afraid he's going to be the most difficult. Matt parkman? What's his thing? He has the ability to alter your mind. Put thoughts into your head. Make you see things that aren't there. Speaking of which, I finally figured out what's been bugging me about you. I'm fast. Real fast. I can sneak up on everybody. I can't sneak up on you. I knew it! You're not really there. It's not your concern, daphne. Just bring me parkman. Guess i don't really have a choice, do i? [Monitor beeping] The team is coming together nicely. Everything went fine. Perfect with nathan. I messed with his head. I gave him visions of linderman, Just like you asked. Now he thinks he's doing god's work. Yes. Very real. Daphne is spreading the word. We're building an army, just like you-- Sorry. Knox called just a few minutes ago. He'll have adam monroe here by tomorrow. Right.
