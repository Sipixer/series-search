The moment you trust them With what you care about most, They'll have you. We have someone else who needs us. We would like you to bring her in. A lot of the people we encounter Aren't in control of their ability. But we need you out there Doing the good work that you do Helping others like her. You were with a boy. There's no boy, dad. I tried out for cheerleading. But you promise me that you won't date. Okay. I painted that, But all the street signs are in french. It could be montreal. Ricky! The woman who did this to Ricky, She was looking for me. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let him cover for me. It was his choice, Peter. My brother could be a right fool sometimes. The woman who killed ricky, She was looking for me. You saw what she could do. I'm not gonna let you be next. I'm gonna find her, Find out who she is, what she wants. How are you planning on doing that? The plane ticket, the painting. It all points to montreal. It's a start. I'm going with you. No. I'm not risking your life too. We were both in that montreal painting. I think i'm supposed to go with you, Peter. Besides, when you find Ricky's killer, I want to be there. What for? To kill the bitch. 1, 2, 3, 4... R-E-C-Y-C-L-E ! 5, 6, 7, 8... It's our planet, let's plant a tree! Whoo! Go, Costa Verde! Stop, please! I can't take it anymore. Do you realize how agonizing it is To watch you people? It's a no on all three. Next! Are you crazy? Claire was awesome. I vote yes. Okay, that's one vote For claire. Anyone else? Care to climb out on a limb with may? Like i said, Next! Thanks for trying. Claire, you were amazing. Really. I don't know what debbie's thinking. What i'm thinking is that Costa Verde High Deserves cheerleaders that are extra-ordinary. And you, Claire, are simply not extra-ordinary. How was that? Perfect yet again. How much longer are we gonna do this? It's been hours. I want to go home. Soon, I promise. Let's take a break. Are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here? Where are we? I mean, you just grabbed me off the street-- You're in hartsdale,new york, At a privately funded company Whose sole purpose is to help you And others like you. Others like me? Not exactly like you. Others have different gifts, But you're the first we've met With adoptive muscle memory. So that's what it's called. why is this happening to me? we're not really sure. there are certain genetic markers, but where they come from is still a mystery. you have been given an extraordinary gift. I agree. you are a very special person, miss dawson. who are you? my name is bob. i'm in charge of operations. doctor, could i see you for a moment? have you established a reliable baseline for miss dawson's ability? yes. she is able to replicate any action. it's really quite extraordinary. good. now, we could determine if this stops all of that. what is that? a variant of the shanti virus. you're experimenting with the virus? manipulating a live virus is essential for creating a vaccine, doctor. we hope to use this virus to take away monica's ability without harming her. you could create an incurable strain. it could cross over to the general population. think how many people were killed by gabriel gray. there are some abilities in this world that must be stopped at any cost. monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities. we can't just take them away from her. it's for the greater good. so she's a lab rat. you're just going to inject her without her consent. no, dr. suresh, you are. it's a mutated strain, manufactured. if the biological structure of the virus has been altered, i don't know if i can save her. she could die. you're just gonna have to take that chance. i never agreed to experiment on people. you brought them molly, didn't you? i didn't know what else to do. all right, look. if you refuse to do this, they're gonna get rid of you, and then we're gonna lose everything that we've been trying to do. and worse yet, you're gonna lose molly. now you've got principles, and that's fine. but to bring down this company sometimes we have to do bad things. don't disappoint me, suresh.

Can i speak with you for a moment? i owe you an apology. What i asked you to do was wrong. i've been with the company for 30 years. we've been through a lot of turmoil and made a lot of difficult choices, some i regret to this day. but right now I'm dealing with someone who is a real danger to us, to everyone, and i'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him, i overstepped my bounds. the file you were holding, adam monroe. yes. you're valuable to us, dr. suresh, not just for your blood or your knowledge, but to keep us in line. molly still isn't well, so i can't take her away from here. but you've given me no reason to trust you. i know, i know. we both have a lot at stake. i have someone at my disposal, someone who can make sure there's no further misunderstandings. sound good? i don't really have a choice, do i? i will get something for your lip. i know you don't understand me. but i want to tell you why i'm helping you. it's that delicious power. you see, when i get my ability back, i'm gonna kill you... and your sister. and i'm gonna take it all. and if i don't get my ability back, it's not a total loss. maya's learning quickly. she's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine. i can't believe you talked me into that. what? somebody could have seen us. relax. no one saw. and no one will ever believe Debbie. did you see her face? classic. is she gonna be okay? definitely. she freaked,but just think of it as a lesson in humility. Claire. oh. hope i'm not interrupting. no, it's okay.how's Debbie? she blew a .13. drinking on school grounds. got suspended from the cheerleading squad immediately. which means we have an opening. first practice is monday after school. you mean it? i'm on the team? sure. you were the best at try-outs. i'll just let you two get back to... whatever. i'll see you monday. tell me something, Ivan. in all the years i've known you, why have you never mentioned a daughter? this daughter. she died, didn't she? leukemia. i'm so sorry. that must have been so painful. i can't even imagine losing claire. to think... all you have left of her are your memories. it would be awful if they were taken. almost as if she never existed. please don't. take the daughter. don't leave anything. wait! it's in the warehouse near the train yard. where we tagged the liquid man. you'll find your paintings there. thank you. now what? your haitian friend makes sure that'll i'll forget that you were ever here? i wish it were that easy. once the company discovers your memory loss, they're gonna trace it back to the haitian, which leads to my family. and i can't have it. what are you doing? you taught me well, my friend. you said, "make it look as if you were never there." so now we weren't. instead, there was a simple home invasion, a senseless murder. i am offering you a way out. you can stop running! shoot me and there is no turning back. you'll condemn yourself to hell. i know. kensei, i've been searching for hours. come, my friend. we must go back and destroy whitebeard's guns. if you want to stop him, do it yourself. something wrong? i saw you, hiro. after i saved the swordsmith, i came after you, afraid something had happened to Yaeko, because i love her. and you, friend, betrayed me. no. yes. you kissed her. it happened... by accident. you accidentally kissed her? i accidentally fell in love with her, and she with me. i'm so sorry. so you've been lying to me all along. first you show me that i can be harmed by no weapon, and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could. she's your princess, Kensei. i know that. and i swear i will not give in to love. that kiss will be our last. but the fate of the world still rests in our hands. we must stop Whitebeard. all right, carp. let's go. you're covered at work and at home, an impromptu burger bonanza training seminar at corporate. here. what's this? information. phone numbers. if you have any questions or concerns, i want you to call us anytime, day or night. also, here. it's fully loaded. anything from martial arts to plumbing, any skill you want is now at your fingertips. wow. support, advice, and now gifts. you're like my own personal oprah. you have an amazing gift. so look around. seems to me like this town could use a little amazing. thanks. right. hello, dr. suresh. niki? how are you? i'm feeling better now. back to my old self, thanks to the company. in fact, i'm gonna be working with them for a while. so you're-- your new partner. i know. it's the last place that i expected to be, but...i owe these people so much. Bob told me that you two were having some trust issues. he just wants me to make sure that there's no more misunderstandings. what does it mean? are you ready? yeah. what is this place? i don't know. someone knew i was coming. "we were right about the company. "the world is in danger. it's up to us. adam." the name Adam doesn't ring a bell? no, and i don't know about any company. i don't know about any of this. "the world is in danger." what am i supposed to do? we'll figure it out. please tell me who i am, peter, how did we-- i don't know. we're in new york. where is everyone?
