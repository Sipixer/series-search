i'm the one making the decisions. mr. petrelli. you're playing yourself? i'm obviously playing mr.- she can't see me, nathan. no one can. except you. you're different. you're special. my name is daphne, and why are you two following me? i want my father's formula back. there's supposed to be some sort of exchange going down at this theater. and i'm waiting to intercept. you were right. i am just a killer. i guess you were wrong about me. we'll see. you wanna tell me that's not you? it's not me. you can't run this story. hey! my name is tracy strauss. do you know me? know you? i created you. i came to find you. get you outta here. i need to show you. the whole world is in trouble. reflexes, blood pressure, balance. they're all normal. i am completely the same in every way. just different. my god.  -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Ó¢ÐÛ µÚÈý¼¾µÚ4¼¯</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËid Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËid Ê±¼äÖá£º¼Ó·¹µÄ²ËÖí  this is dr. mohinder suresh, journal entry 12. three days after injecting the genetic modification formula.</i> my reflexes are sharper. my strength, off the charts. it's a dream come true. who among us hasn't wished for strength?</i> to fly? and now it's all possible. there are few adverse reactions. the one exception being an unusual rash. a byproduct of the formula, an allergy- oh, no, please don't! stop it! hello, is everything all right? i'm sorry to intrude, but i heard shouting and i wanted to make sure everything was- everything's fine. thanks. are you sure? 'cause it looks like your wife- she'll be fine. now back off, sahib. stop it! stop it! stop it! stop, please. just leave us alone, all right? god, don't hurt him. you were one of three identical triplets.</i> tracy, niki, and barbara. perfect test subjects. when your birth parents died</i> we separated you. we- i just need some answers. what did you do to me? dna manipulation. a formula that would make you incredible.</i> speed, strength. is it something like that? why? why would you do this? what gave you the right? we had no right. we were arrogant and selfish and... human. who? who wanted this? i think i've said too much already. they would not like that. give me a name. someone! there was a company. a company that- um, i don't remember. i can't remember. you're lying. they made us forget. well, then you have to take it away. this... thing that i can do. i can't. no, you don't understand. this ability... i've hurt people. it is part of you now. no, i never asked for it. you need to take it away. i can't. tell me how to take it away. ah! tell me. i'm so sorry. what have you done? who is she? what happened to her? it's your future, parkman. not mine. yeah, it is, okay. so that means i can stop that from happening, right? do you really want to know? this stuff is supposed to show me my future? i don't think this is working. here. try this. come on. where are we? when are we? this is the future i came back to stop.</i> why? it looks just like today. with one big difference. how is this possible? an injection. abilities are available to anyone. for sale if you can afford it. for grabs if you're desperate enough. now all these people with abilities are gonna destroy the world. how could you know that? how would you? i painted it. dreamed it. it's going to happen- here, look. all the crime, murder, all abilities. people can't be trusted. we're weak, jealous, violent. there's always good people, always. how could i be so naive? when abilities are the new weapon of choice- people will control themselves. it's not safe for me to be out in the open. they'll be looking for us. i needed you to see. who are "they"? what did you do? they think i'm an extremist. a villain. i had to stop it. maybe they're right. you shot nathan. you killed him. he was gonna tell everyone the truth about us. but he d didn't die. and now he doesn't have to. so why hasn't everything changed? someone from your time is putting together a formula that gives people abilities. you have to stop him. why me? why can't you do it? because i made terrible choices. stepped on too many butterflies. what does that mean? you can't make the same mistakes as me. we need to find sylar. with his ability, you won't make the same mistakes. sylar, what the hell are you talking about? i wanna see nathan, claire, suresh. they're not the people you think they are. why not? not all of us were born with abilities, okay? some of us were made. a line was drawn. sides were chosen. it tore us apart. well, you actually did it. you killed peter. no. he's still alive. looks plenty dead to me. there were two of them. this one and a younger one from the past. this is bad, right? bad-bad. yeah, we have orders. kill petrelli. it's obviously easier said than done. we need to use molly. she can find peter anywhere in the world. you know i can't just do that. it's not that simple. it is. if you won't ask her, i will. i'm not afraid of you. no, but you are afraid of peter. and you know he won't stop, not ever. until we find him... and we kill him. let me out! i must save the world! the future depends on it! we have to get  out of here,ando. there must be another way... ah! the vent! but, it's too high. ando,come on and give me a hand. i'm not talking to you. what? what did i do? you said you didn't need me. you said you don't know why you take me along! you're so powerful. help yourself. i followed you around the world. risked my life for you because i believed we were friends.partners. you know what i think? i think you're still upset that future me murders future you. and what if i am....? i knew it! i can't help it. every time i look at you i see it over and over again. how could you kill me ? i would never hurt you. but i'm starting to understand why i might. senator petrelli? senator, you need to make your choice. there are a lotta historical desks available. where's tracy? isn't it her job to make these decisions? well, ms. strauss isn't answering her cell. take the john foster dulles. it sends the right message. which one would you pick? uh, robert kennedy's. kennedy it is, thank you. you know, i thought you'd be enjoying this. you're a senator back in the seat of power where you belong. able to do god's work here on earth. god's work? i'm picking out desks. what's the real problem here, nathan? you. you're the real problem. y- you don't trust me? i'm hurt. i'm the only one who can see you. that's a problem. don't play me, okay? i've been around people who can do amazing things. what are you? what, are you a telepath? no. nothing that obvious. you know what it is? it's brain damage from the shooting. the shooting that you so miraculously survived. come on, nathan. i mean, healing, flying. i mean, isn't that the work of angels? you saying you're an angel? you're a murderer. you wanted to destroy new york city.</i> kill millions of people. if i remember correctly, you did too. what exactly do you want from me? i want to help you. first, a senator. then president. president. the greater the fall, the grander the ascension. isn't that what you've always wanted?</i> trust me. this is the path to salvation. it's not my path. not if you're leading the way. this place is disgusting. the milk's gone bad. didn't you notice? look, i don't need you cleaning up after me. well, obviously you do. ugh. you don't look well. i'm just tired. no wonder. working all hours. no food, no fresh air. i have lots to do. come on, let's get outta here. i can't. but it's a beautiful day outside. and you've been cooped up in here- working for you. trying to find some way to take away your ability! isn't that what you want? i came because i care about you. you want me to go? fine. wait. i- i-i didn't mean to yell. i- i'm just tired. i will find the answers... for you. i promise. journal entry 13. the rash is spreading. i don't know what it is or its connection to my aggression. the formula is transforming me, and i fear... i fear what i'm becoming. the formula is transforming me. i fear what i'm becoming. the formula is transforming me, and i fear...</i> i fear what i'm becoming. mohinder? what do you want? i need your help. i need you to tell me everything you know about sylar. sylar? i have to find him. he's supposed to... help me. but why? why sylar? mohinder, are you okay? what happened to you? what's going on? mohinder! do not repeat my mistakes. what happened to you? i wanted abilities. impetuous. selfish. i got the formula wrong. so wrong. let me help you. tell me about sylar. sylar's power is dangerous. you don't understand it. i need to understand. where is he? where's sylar? costa verde, the bennet house. don't go! hey, uncle peter. dad's making waffles. what's up, champ? how you doing, man? good to see you. raa! who wants some waffles, huh? who else should get some waffles?</i> mr. muggles. okay, a little piece of waffle.</i> but just 'cause you're such a good boy. yes, you're so good. always such a good dog. yes, you're a very good doggy. peter, it's so good to see you. i haven't seen you in so long. if you told me you were coming, i would've made extra. what's the magic word? abracadabra. well, that's a magic word, so that's close enough.</i> where's your scar, uncle peter? you know what? grown-ups need to have a little chat in the other room. so i'm gonna get you started on your waffle. all right, there you go.</i> you gonna be okay? yes. yes, i know you are. we're just gonna be in the other room, all right? you're not from around here, are you? no scar. the past, right? which means, to you, i'm the boogeyman. it's a hell of a thing. you coming here to find out that you and i are brothers. brothers? oh, i'm sorry that you've come all this way, peter, but i can't help you. can't? i won't. why? i'm not gonna give it to you, my ability, i'm not. then i'll just take what i need from you. as if you could. peter is dead. they killed him. and now they're after me. i am not leaving without your ability, sylar. my name is gabriel. and you don't realize... my ability is not just understanding how things work. there's a hunger that comes with it. to know more, to have more.</i> i couldn't control it. it had turned me into a killer. a monster. every day is a struggle. every hour. but i fight it... for him. and i am not... going to willingly condemn you to hell. if i have your ability- if i can understand the variables, then i- can save the world. the world always needs saving, peter. you're all gonna die. your family. your son. this world is gonna end. you don't believe me? here. paint it. see for yourself. paint the future. don't let him see me. not like this. do you understand? no, no way. no, we're not dragging molly into this. what? well, we're both raising her.</i> yes, to be a normal little girl.</i> not to be your bloodhound. no, it's just this once. we use her ability to find peter. peter petrelli is a murderer and a terrorist and- and he's the villain, not me. this is our chance to stop peter now. forever. i just-i- i don't understand why you would risk your life when you've got this beautiful baby girl waiting for you at home. you are beautiful. this is everything to me. you, this family- and this is the part where the "but" comes in, daniella. but i was a cop. and i know what it's like to have a spouse who's worried if you're ever gonna come home alive. i'm gonna be fine. nothing can touch me. right. you're a wife and a mother. it's time for you to slow down. we find peter. we catch him and then you can consider me settled. you're not gonna let this go, are you? and miss a chance to stop peter and all the pain and misery he's caused? we have to. molly. you guys done arguing? uh, we-we weren't- your mother needs to talk to you for a second. everything's gonna be fine. peter's in costa verde. sylar. sylar, yeah. you're afraid. don't act like i don't know what i'm talking about. you stink of it. so what if i am? so claire bennet isn't afraid of anything. i just killed my uncle and i have to do it again. give me a second to be a human being. you see, the problem is, claire, unlike you, daphne and i can die. so get your head on straight. sylar?

the boy or you? you don't want anyone to get hurt, do you? just, first, let the boy go. not until you're dead. you're gonna kill me? one bullet in the back of the head should do the trick.</i> then i'll let the boy go. i'm not the guy that you killed this morning, claire. look, this is me. you're not gonna kill me. yes, i am. what happened to you? how'd you get this way? i learned how to take care of myself. noah! daddy! go hide over there. go now. i understand your power. you get stronger with fear. i'm not afraid of you. but he is. noah, run! run! daddy! they killed him! gabriel! let me try. i've got it. what?
