but I swear to God I'm not gonna stop until I figure it out, get it? I'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family... I don't have a job, Jan! They're gonna pay for what they did to me, what they did to us. There is no pulling this whole thing behind you, we gotta find out what they did and make them fix it! You wanted to know why I was invisible all these years, it was because of them. And you throw the bastards right to my door! Tell me Claire, can you keep... a secret? I think I know how I survived the fire. Please say something. Some family, that's how I survived it. Your mother has a subdural hemorrhage. It's like a bruise on her brain, specifically the area that controls memory. You erased her mind. Claire, that's ridiculous... You tried to erase mine! What you know is dangerous. Why did you do this to mom? I only wanted to protect my family... I've had enough of that! Don't, don't, don't! I'm not gonna nuke the dog! I wouldn't hurt... - Mr. Muggles, would I? - You know what, if you wanted to hurt this guy, that'd be the way to do it. There are more pictures of dogs around here than there are of his kids. You don't really think that he's stupid and/or sloppy enough to leave incriminating evidence around the house. He did just get raided by the FBI. We couldn't get a warrant for the house, so in the off chance that he is a little sloppy or stupid, - I wanna poke around. - So now we're jacking his computer? You wanna sit around all day and download files? - I don't. - If we don't find anything on his PC, there's is somewhere else we can look. - Inside his head! - I plan on that. We're gonna bag the smug son of a bitch at his paper factory. See how he likes it. Maybe we can bag him here. Oh, God. He's with his family. Family's a pretty good motivator. No, no. I am not taking any hostages. We bag him at the paper factory. No, no, no. That was Plan A. Plan B is much better. There is no Plan B. We leave... now! How many times you gonna let this guy slip through your fingers? Lyle, help your mother. Claire, talk to me! What's the point? Am I even gonna remember this conversation? Would you keep your voice down? Lyle, take your mother and get out of the house right now! I'm sure you have a lot of questions. We all do. Honey, what's happening? Yeah dad, what's happening? Stay calm. Yeah, let's just everyone stay calm. Okay, everyone stays calm, nobody's gonna get hurt. This is Officer Parkman of the LAPD. Formerly of the LAPD thanks to you. What do you want from me? You come into my house with guns? Not guns. Gun. I don't need a gun, do I, Mr. Bennet? Not after what you did to me. I don't know you. If you insist on lying, you're gonna upset me. And you know what happens when I get upset, I get very bright... and very hot. Ted is gonna do us all a favor, right, Ted-- and he's not gonna get upset. But you gotta help. I'm not who you think I am. I'm just a paper salesman. No... you're not. So tell me. How do you feel about paper? - Widly enthusiastic. - Good. 'Cause as far as friends and family are concerned, it's your life. Congratulations. You are the new regional manager for Primatech Paper. Nice cover. Sorry to make a liar out of you. But it's part and parcel of what we do. Nobody outside the organization knows. Well, they can't know. People are fragile... like tea cups. All around them, the world is changing and they simply don't wanna deal with it. They don't wanna know what's happening to us as a species. And they certainly don't wanna know the measures we take to keep them safe. Now you'll be asked to do things that fall into morally grey territory. Things that most would find cruel... but men like you and I know to be necessary. I'm comfortable with morally grey. Good. You will have a partner. One of them. That's how we do it here. Keeps us all honest. Great! When do I meet him? He's already here. Is this a test? How did-- how did-- how is that-- It's a brave new world, friend. Go ahead. Tell 'em what you do. What goes on at that "paper factory" of yours, Mr. Bennet? He abducts people! He-- he drugs us! He injects us with I don't know what. I lost my job and I am trying not to lose my wife. But you don't care about that? You don't care about what you did to me. All you care about is that we think that nothing happened. Makes us forget. How can he make you forget? The Haitian. That's right. The Haitian. She knows? This is your fault. She knows this is his fault. He's got 'em all fooled except for her. Just when you thought plausible deniability was gonna save your ass. The Haitian... He made my mother forget. ... made her mother forget... and her brother but not... Why didn't he make you forget? What is he talking about, Claire? I don't know anything. You wanna put a stop to all this? All you need to do to keep your family safe, to keep us all safe, is just tell the truth. I am telling the truth. No, this... is the truth! Oh, my God! This is what you did to me. Settle down, Ted. I just wanna be normal again. He's not a paper salesman. Guess she's not Daddy little girl anymore. Subtitles: www.swsub.com What are they doing? He's getting inside your daughter's head. I can run. Get some help. They can hurt me.</i> I know you're thinking about being a hero-- don't! Don't! This guy is serious. And he's really dangerous and I need your help to make sure that nobody gets hurt. You can read my mind. Yeah, that's something your dad did to me. It didn't just happen? I wouldn't be here right now if it just happened. Has my dad done this to other people? As far as I can tell, it's different with everyone. I've seen some weird things. I'm sure you have too, like that stuff at your school. Peter Petrelli. Peter Petrelli? He can do what I can do. What do you know about him? He can do what I can do. He's different... like you. Save the cheerleader. I read his mind, he read mine. He told me to protect you... from someone who was killing people like me. Are you different, Claire? Your blood was all over that crime scene. You didn't have a scratch on you. Why didn't you have a scratch on you? I can heal. Did my dad make me this way? What are they gonna do with the baby? I don't know. I wonder if they knew about little orphan Annie before they sent us over there to bag a bloody fire starter. They would've told us. Claude... a word, please. Did you make me this way? Is that why you adopted me? Am I some sort of experiment?! Don't talk to your father like that. He's not my father. They have nothing to do with this. - He's the one who got 'em involved. - No, we did, when we didn't leave this house when they came home. No one's been hurt. What's he gonna do, call the police? We can get out of here now. We didn't get what we came for. We came for a cure. What if there isn't one? I'll kill us all. Just get inside his head and get some answers or we're all gonna have a really bad day. That son of a bitch is thinking in Japanese. Why are you thinking in Japanese? We want answers! Who are you? And what did you do to us? In the den... the safe in the bookcase. Ted, there's a safe in the bookcase. Enough! We're done. We are not done! I'm calling your bluff. Mom. Put the gun down. That's not gonna help anybody. He killed my wife. Only fair I kill his. And with his own gun too. Kinda poetic, don't you think? Tell him what he wants to know! Come on! He's willing to kill us all. Leave her alone. She didn't do anything. Claire, sit down. Shoot me if you're gonna shoot someone. Parkman, you have to trust me. Shoot Claire.</i> I'm telling you someone's gonna die. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bennet. Shoot Claire now. She can heal. Shoot me! You brought this on yourself. What did you do?! What did you do?! What did you do that for? Get his trust. Now he knows how far we'll go. Right hook. Right hook coming. Bastard! You killed my little girl! You-- you did! Tell me it's not true. Don't leave her here! Move Claire's body before it heals. They don't need to see her like this. We gotta move the body. I had no idea it was gonna go this far. Believe me. He was going to kill your wife. I actually heard him pull the trigger in his mind. Thank you for shooting first. Oh my God. - Where's mom and Lyle? - Downstairs. - Are they safe? - No. Wait, you made her indestructible? I didn't make anyone. You don't have all your facts straight and I don't appreciate your confusing my daughter. The facts are you work at some freak factory where you ruin people's lives. You've been misled. I will explain everything later. But right now, you have to do exactly what I tell you to do. I'm going to the police. Wait, wait. Do not make the same mistake I did. Don't put your family at risk. Yeah, coming! The people I work for don't know about you. If they did, you wouldn't be here right now. They would've taken you months ago and we never would've seen you again. You said you want a normal life. That's what I've been fighting for. He's telling the truth. Hate me all you want, but right now, this has to be contained. Which means you have to stay put. You want me to play dead? I'm sorry. I'm not Mr. Muggles. That man downstairs can generate a chain reaction which would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on this house. And he'll do it too. Come on, we gotta go now. Just do what I say so nobody gets hurt. And you. Do what I think. - Enough! - No! That's enough! We already got their attention. We're not gonna find anything here. What we want is at the paper factory. - Really? - Yeah. Did he tell you that or think it? There are records of the abductions-- what they've done. In exchange for his family's safety, he'll get them for us. I don't want anybody else to die because of what I've done to you. Why do all words coming out of your mouth sound like lies? He's not lying. We'll have proof. No surprises at the factory. Just the truth. I'll stay with the family. You go. I'll stay with the family. I can do more damage here. Whatever you say. You're in control. Sandra-- I'm gonna get us out of this. It's 7:00 AM. If you're not back in an hour, look for the mushroom cloud. I think my wife suspects something. She went through my bag. She found a gun and a sedation kit. That's a particular kind of stupid on your part - for letting her find them. - I know, I know. The baby's been keeping me up for days. It was sloppy. I think Sandra thinks I'm some sort of a serial killer. She's better off thinking you're a serial killer than knowing the truth. I don't know what to do. That a new sensation for you, Bennet? Is my wife in danger? If I said yes, what would be your next move? Would you pack up Sandra and little Claire and make a run for it or would you turn her over? I'd do what I've always done. What I'm told. But you didn't answer the question. Is she in danger? Relax. Nothing's gonna happen to your wife because she's not gonna remember finding anything. There's a boy we discovered in Haiti. He can make her forget? He's really something. He's mute. When we asked him about his ability, he drew a picture of himself pulling memories like little grub worms out of someone's head. The one I put * of my fridge. When he's done, make sure you thank him for saving Sandra's life. She's upstairs. We don't have time for this. In about 38 minutes, Ted's going nuclear unless we bring him back some hard evidence. The only thing we're bringing Ted is a tranquilizer. He deserves to know the truth. He doesn't want the truth. He wants his wife back. Short of that, he wants revenge of the good old-fashioned Biblical variety. No, actually he doesn't. You said yourself he already pulled the trigger in his mind. Okay, so that's it for him? What about me? You're gonna send me back to LA with my family and no idea this ever happens so you can pretend to have a happy family again? I'm not sending you anywhere. You're the only one I can trust. Look, here's the deal. I'll be honest with you. You be honest with me. You just try lying to me... I just signaled the Haitian. - You said no one would know we're here. - Until I need them to. Guess who found out where I live. What do you think we should do with him? First, I have another "guess who." Guess who found out you can talk! Who have you been talking to? Who else knows about Claire? Just you and I. But that will change. She wasn't supposed to remember any of this. I gave you specific instructions. I answer to someone whose instructions supersede yours. In this company? In your daughter's life. What's the mission? Looking into a security breach. That's all I know. That's all they told me. That's all they told you to tell me. But what you know is considerably more. You're not as good liar as you think. You're the security breach. Is that what they're calling me behind my back? I was hoping for something a bit more subtle or a pun at least. You American are usually good for a pun. Is it true? Are you hiding one of them? By "them", do you mean people like me? Is that what you're accusing me of hiding? Well, the short answer's yes, isn't it? You compromised what we're doing. Sorry. I know we're serving the greater good, but the vivisection started to keep me up at night. Seeing as you're raising one of us as you're own, I was hoping for a bit more sympathy. - Claire's not one of you. - Not yet. But one day maybe. And don't tell me you haven't thought about it. If she is, then they'll take her. It's done. Oh, just like that? Father of the Year, you are. - I know who I work for. - So do I. I was in your office when they told you to kill me. Then why'd you get in the car? Evidently, I think you're a better man than they do. Get out. It's not the first time you've been told to kill a man, but is it the first you've been told to kill a friend? Tell me who it is... and we can forget about the rest. You're just gonna do it? - You just gonna off me like nothing? - It's not nothing! We find these people. That's what we do. And you buried one. You acted against the interest of the company. You ever stop to think what those interests are? Who is it? And what if it was Claire? That's why you're so distant from her. You know you're going to turn her in. You're preparing for it. You used to believe in what we do. I used to believe in the tooth fairy. We made a promise-- both of us. I will not hunt my own people. This isn't who you are. You have a choi-- Why couldn't you just-- She's my daughter. You can't be trusted to put her safety before company interests. I've been hiding her for months. That's the sort of thing that'll get you killed by someone like you. But it hasn't made your daughter any safer. We're running out of time and we're not exactly dealing with a patient man. It's in Claire's best interest that we contain this - and we keep her off the radar. - She could run. - She's safer in plain sight. - Not at the moment. No one is gonna be safe unless you give Ted what he wants. Thank you, God. I prayed so hard. Thank you. Thank you, God. I prayed so hard and you came back. Is it you? Is it really you? Go. Hurry. Run. Run, Mom! Come on. Get outta here! Run! You should've run. I could never leave you, not after I just got you back. I always thought you were a miracle. Didn't know how much of one until no. I'm not a miracle, mom. You were dead. Any time someone rises from the dead, I'd say that's a miracle. I don't know what I am. I don't know if God made me this way or someone else. God didn't make us this way. God makes us all the way we are. I walked through fire and didn't get burned. You were trying to tell me. I was trying not to tell you. All this forgetting... why I was in the hospital... you think your father did that to me? I know he did. He said he was trying to protect us. He's your father. He is coming back to get us out of this. He's lied to you your entire marriage. What makes you so sure he'll keep his word now? Faith. What I've seen, what I've witnessed. I can't pretend it's the same world it was yesterday. God gave you a second chance. Find it in your heart to give your father one. I'm curious about something. Did Parkman know when he shot you that you wouldn't die? Did your dad tell him that? I don't know. That explains why they were so chummy when they came down the stairs. What do you supposed they're up to? Guess I'll just ask them myself. Am I still in control, Mr. Bennet? You're still in control, Ted. No tricks. Just what you asked for-- the truth. We have what we want, Ted. We have the proof. Then why the theatrics with shooting the girl who can't die? It's better than shooting one who can. We didn't come her to hurt anyone. If the people who I work for found out that I've shown this to you, they will kill me. Since I'm risking my own life, I would rather not risk my family's. Do you want revenge or do you want the truth? You can't have both. I want the truth. Then let them go. Get them out of here. What is he doing here? Just making sure my family's safe, that's all. No, not you, you stay. They can go. Dad! Go! Come on, Claire. Let's go. Come on. Come on. - Lyle! - Mom! I called the police. We didn't make you this way. We took you three months ago... to identify you. At the time, you were giving off low levels of radiation. You were harmless. You did nothing to stop it. There's no cure. We can't change the way you are. The only choice is to kill you. I wish you had. It was my goal. You had a life. Who was I to take it from you? Because you let me go, my wife is dead. I'm sorry. So am I. No, don't! You'll set him off! You gotta stop it! I can't! We gotta get outta here! Dad. Where's my dad? He's-- Claire, don't! - Dad! - Get out! Not without you! Tranquilizer. Stay down! I can't get close enough. - Give it to me. - No! I'll be okay. Get him out of here! It's a good thing you called me when you did. This sort of thing isn't taken lightly. You know well and good what the policy is on hiding them. I'm well aware. It's a shame I have to kill another partner, especially one so useful to the cause. - Has he been located? - The Haitian? Nah. He must've figured you'd turn him in. How long was he hiding Claire? In plain sight too. You must feel like a fool. I take it it's been months. She trusted him over her own father. Surrogate father. Now that we have him, we'll keep Sprague sedated. Find out what gives him his spark. And then? What do you think? He was very helpful. Imagine working with someone like Parkman by your side. Knowing what everyone around you is thinking could prove quite resourceful. Certainly keep everybody honest. She one of them? Very promising. She's gonna help us clean up the mess you made. - We done here? - Just one more thing. When should we be expecting Claire? I'll bring her in now. Why am I going? I don't know. Will I see you again? Mom, Lyle? I don't know. I wanted to protect you. You're my dad. I tried to be the best dad. I couldn't. I know. Let's see? Those are grandpa glasses. Even though I am the same age my father was when he need glasses. All right. How about these? Grandma glasses. Am I gonna need glasses too? I don't know. Well, if you needed them and grandpa needed them, won't I need them? Your mother and I were wondering when we were gonna have this conversation. - What's wrong? - No, no, nothing's wrong. Tell me. I'm not your biological father. You're adopted. - Then who are my real parents? - We're your real parents. We don't know who your biological family is but we're your real family. How can you be my real family if I'm adopted? Well, what makes us real isn't where you come from. It's... how much we love you. And we love you very much. I love you very much. You didn't grow inside your mother. You grew inside our hearts. Claire... talk to me. Try these on. How do I look? Like my dad. This is good-bye. You don't... have to do this. There's gotta be another way. This is the best way. There can't be any doubt cast on your father. Right here. Two inches higher and I'm dead. Claire, turn around. Cover your ears. Dad! Go deep. Take anything that would lead them to her.
