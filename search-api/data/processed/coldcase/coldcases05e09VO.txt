'cause i was on the bridge that night. well,maybe your memory's a little fuzzy. i heard a car pull up and then this little splash. i look down in the water and a girl floats by right in front of me. you're here to clear your conscience,right,maurice? so why don't you save us the song and dance,admit you did it. i admit those were dark times,but not that dark. the only one i was killing was myself. there's no water in her lungs. not likely she drowned. saying she was dead when she hit the water? no one caught it back then? wasn't going for a midnight swim in this red dress. so somebody dumped her. tough to kill yourself if you're already dead. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Cold Case Season05 Episode09 Boy Crazy</font> you wanted to see me,boss? have a seat,scotty. nah,i'm...good. iad is recommending suspension-- 30 days,unpaid. just like that,huh? they're citing procedure,perimeter. you've been around long enough to know how it goes. so,do i just... leave now? if i thought you were wrong,you'd be gone by now. get back to work. yeah,but... i'm suspended,right? they're commended suspension. so,you got to come up with a counteroffer now,or something? do your job,scotty; let me do mine. samantha randall,some kids found her body washed up at fdr park. yup,it's a girl. not where i come from. i was a tomboy when i was little. used to beat my brothers arm wrestling. guessing you didn't take it this far,though. to each their own. a classmate said samantha only wore boys' clothes. until the night she died,that is. well,she was the new kid in town. enrolled at grays ferry high school, couple months before she died. kids must've loved her. the cops ruled it a suicide,chalked it up to her... behavior problem. ran away from home every few weeks, had three arrests for public intoxication. we thinking she was gay? back in '63 that was a disease. could've been acting out,confused. doer might've taught "the freak" a lesson. put her in a dress to drive the point home. so how did she die? the marks on her temples might be bruises,burns? i'll see if she got family left. find out just how rough this tomboy had it. archie randall? you found him. philly homicide. i got some questions,if you don't mind. homicide? what is this? maybe you'd like to speak in private. finish without me. i'm looking into your daughter's death. i don't understand. sam... killed herself. you told officers she was having behavior problems. well,you would,too,if your mom died when you were little. i raised her on my own. did the best i could anyway. was she always a tomboy? like the son i never had. she loved to build tree forts and play in the mud. but... around age 12,trouble started. what kind of troubles? oh,sassing her teachers and skipping school and fighting. got kicked out of... a few high schools upstate. that why you moved to grays ferry? twice we had to pack up and move to a new town. we were damned lucky not to end up in the poorhouse. i hope you don't mind me asking,but sam's alternative behaviour. How far did it go? I'm not sure i catch your meaning. Did your kary prefer the company of other girls? No,no,no,no. She wasn't one of those. Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daughter? I got to admit,sam didn't have a lot of friends. She always acted like it was her against the world. It's hard Adjusting to a new school, isn't that right,tim? Red picked on me so why am i the one brought in herE. Because you can't come to school dressed like that. You want to me to dress like a girl? Because it will make them feel better. You will dress like a girl because you're a girl.samantha It's sam Sam is a boy's name, let gets this straight You will go by samantha at school Did your mother ever take you shopping for clothes,dear? She mass a closet full of skirts at home. Price tags on all of them. Girls like her run into trouble later on in life. Personality disorders. Alcohol abuse. There are places that can help her if she's not willing to change. Let's nip this in the bud now,shall we? Why can't i just be who i am. And who or what exactly is that? Now,it says here you've registered for shop class. Yeah. I want to learn how to build a turbo engine from scratch. I've taken the liberty of enrolling you in home economics instead. Why? So I can change diapers and mick cups of coffee for people like you. Sam Why don't you leave me alone. The new kid,you get the dress yet? What dress. Every since home room everyone's saying you're the shoon-in for homecoming. ******* You must be real proud. Tom Baring What a surprise. Excuse me. No one was on her side,not even me. This tom baring,he said sam should wear a dress? Kids were always cruel to her. Did he and sam ever get into it again? I don't know. She shut me out of her life. I guess i can't blame her. Thank you for your time,mr.Randall. I used to tell her it's a phase. When you're older,you will look back and laugh at yourself for acting this way. Guess i was wrong. Here to pick up or place an order? Neither. We want to talk to you about sam randall. That's a name i haven't heard in a while. She died,back in '62,'63,right? November,'63. We think someone killed her. My god. Found wearing a dress. Just like you said she should. I used to shoot my mouth off all the time. Thought i was a real bad ass but i was just a bored kid. Had quite a rap sheet at the tender age of 16. Breakfasting and entering************* And i skipped school too. Do you want it write that down. I didn't kill her where were you the night she died? Home,trying to keep dad from beating mom unconscious. Real norman rockwell stuff. She pissed you off,didn't she?sam? Oh,yeah,she pissed everyone off much that's what i liked about her. And you got familiar? That must have hurt her reputation. I didn't give a damn what the other kids thought. We both didn'T. It made us cool. How did this great friendship start? Bunch of guys used to drag race out in the pines. Once sam found out about it,nothing could keep her away. ******* Thought you would chicken out. I wouldn't miss it for the world,red. ******** What are you squawking about? I spent a month working on this. How much gas have you got in there? About a quarter tank. Too much. Pop it. Hey,what are you doing? I don't let just anyone touch my car. I know everything about engines. Trust me,will you. Man,you must be desperate. So,red,what are we racing for? How about pink slips. You can keep that gentleman loppy. How about her instead. One day Deal. My car for your girl. He's going to leave you in the dust candy ass. We? Yeah,we're partners. Race some rubber. Ready? Go! What did you put in the tank? Moonshine. Told you you would win,didn't I? Full of all sorts of surprises,aren't new. You cheated,you freak. ******* We won fair and square,red. Layoff the kid. You think you can screw red buckley over,you're crazier than you look. Sam was fun. And she knew what it was like to be an outsider. Like you. Sam was my only friend. Bingo in both ways. You never thought to go to the cops about this. I didn't think it mattered. They said she killed herself. What about red? Did he ever make good on his threat? Must have. If she didn't kill herself,right? Thanks for your time. The town bully,lost his pride and his girl in the same night. ********* ******** Is he giving gordon hell? And the chief of detectives. Guess I should pack my bags. Look like john's giving as good as he gets. Red buckley. I've been asking around about you. If I knew cops were this cute I would have come in sooner.******** You have quite the bad boy reputation in high school. Ladies man,in the hot rod. Still got that little chevy in my backyard if you would like to take a spin. Something. People are still talking about those drag races out in the ponds. Undefeated. All through high school. That car was a rocket. Actually,i heard different. One legendary night, you got served your ass on a plate,by a girl. Who,sam randall? That wasn't a girl. You bullied sam. Hated her for showing you up. If she would just put on a skirt. Us guys would have let her be. Threatened by her,weren't you? Freaked out more like. Everyone was,even the girls. Are you saying she got into it with them? You know how you females can be. Vicious. Live it up gals,rent a hungry man. I I believe you get credit for this. Red nose whot winner is. He's tasted my pie before. I bet he has. Sorry,son! Did you say something? Don't be A***** Nice apron. You got to try lipstick some time. So I can look like a dip,too? At least I'm not a lesbo. How many hours a day are you taking it on? Stuffing your bra? Just wondering. These are primo 100% real. You should try it. Looking like a girl,i mean. A lot of work being a skirt. No thanks. Look,butch,I don't know how they dress at your last school but at grace ferry,girls look like this. You might want to take some notes. Looks like someone is a pony missing its tale. ******* You messed with the wrong girl. Sounds like janey had a nasty little temper. Once,a chick winked at me jenny gave her a black eye. And sam grabbed the tiara right off the beauty beaten queen's head so to speak. ******* Where were you the night sam died? at home coming dance. Spent most of the night behind the gym trying to get something. I'll track melissa down. See what she said. Let me know if she's single. Sam randall made a fool out of you,exposed you as a fake. And she was right. I was the bell of the ball with my bullet bra and war paint. I take it you're more involved than that now? I like to think so. What made you change,janey? Guilt,maybe? No,living through the feminist movement,it changed my life. Come a long way since high school. When you threatened sam randall. Look,I was a bitch on wheels back then. I wasn't proud of it. Sam frightened me. She did more than frighten you. She turned you into a punch line. ***** I had to score a settle but not with sam. Sam's friend dom. He stood me up for our stupid date. What does this have to do with sam's murder? I went to find him. giving a peace of my mind He and sam were at the lake. ******* The regular hangout. That's when I found out what sam really was. Damn,it's hot. Jia thought rp taking janey to the movie tonight? ********* Why I wag was going to take you parking but just have to talk to her on the ride home. A lot of chicks are like that.no funs ******* ********* Nobody's judging you. Trying to make you something you're not. I wish i could stay here forever. Why don't you? Girls**** It's just the way i am. I don't know what that makes me. Feels right,you know. I think so. And i used to get match box cars every christmas. He brought me a barbie and i balled my eyes out. I'm not trying to be like anybody else. Just me. We'll never let them change you. Always be free. I'll die trying. Really? Yeah. You like chicks the way i do. No, what do you like? I like you... - What the hell are you doing? - I don't know. I'm not some queer. - I just wants to be with you,dom,I'm sorry. - Shut up. Try that again,and i'll beat your head in. Dom I know it was confusing. You can say that again. And i made sure it got around the next day at school. Excuse me. So the gender bending girl makes a pass at a bad boy and everyone knows. Maybe dom wasn't such a sensitive guy after all. She was a boy inside of a girl who liked a boy? That about sums it up. Make my head hurt here. Yes,probably why cops dropped it like a hot potato. Still don't explain the marks on her head. Or why she ended up in girl's clothes the night she died. Dom's got a little explaining to do. Will,want to step in for a second? Sure. I'm going to need you to keep an eye on things around here for a little while. What do you mean? You're the senior man on the squad. Listen,you have a seat. What's going on,john? I'm going to have to take a 30-day rest,starting friday. I can use the time,i haven't been fishing in six years. Ied,they're suspending you? I told them i signed off the shooting in barely. To they's hands were tied. You're taking the hit. Scotty's a good cop. He doesn't need some stink on his rap. And do you? I'm set. I've been around long enough, i don't have to worry about what is coming after mE. I don't know what to say. Say you will keep the trains running. - Just for 30 days. - Who knows? I might take a shine to it. Come on,you can't leave us. At what part? The hours,the politics? Seriously,john,what are you going to do? I don't know. Maybe it's time i found out. The lazy afternoons fishing. To old friends. Amen to that. I heard sam got fresh with you at the lake. In '63,common clenches of a girl who looks like a boy. I didn't kiss her. Witnesses say it got hot and heavy. I'm not that way. What way? Sam looked like boy. You've seen pictures. It was confusing. I bet it was. Especially when the whole school found out. And you your buddy, made you a little involved by association. ***********And get rid of the freak. She wasn't freak. She... she was just lost. I should have handled it differently. - And not killed her you mean. - I didn't kill her. I shut her out,i gave her the cold shoulder. But you didn't give a damn about what the other kids thought,right? Wrong. I did. And i abandoned sam when she needed me the most. Looky here.She's crying. Boys don't cry. Are you a boy,huh? Or you just like kissing them. So you a queer now,too? Makeup your mind what you are,freak. You want to get with boys,you got to look like a girl. ******* Queer! You****** No - Hold her still - Hold her still - No - samatha randol my office now Sam had more guts and integrity than anyone in that school,including me. What did the principal do? Called her father. Yanked her out of school,i guess. Sam was expelled? Her dad came to pick her up that day. I never saw her again. But you lied to us,had to pull up six again, maybe he didn't have anymore moves left in him? Never told us sam got kicked out of the grace ferry. What was that? Third high school in three years. A not sure what you're getting at here. Your daughter thought she was a boy and had a nasty temper to boot. I loved sam. Only wanted what was best for her. Couldn't move again,though,couldn't? You were at your wits ends. I didn't know what else to do. So you lost your temper? Maybe things got out of hand,you hit her archy? Oh,no I did something much worse. Her diagnosis is gender identity disorder. ****We keep girls like samantha to dress,talk and walk like ladies. How,what will you do to her? Behaviour moifbs,medication, worst case scenario,electro con vuflsive therapy. I don't know about that. You are do want what's best for your daughter? Of course i do but sam's never been away from home before. We can help her. Just last month a former patient got engaged to be married. Get me out of here. Don't make it harder. I'll be a girl,please,I'll wear whatever you want. She won't need these boys' clothes. Samantha will be wearing a dress like a normal girl. Daddy,please don't make me stay here. I'm sorry,samantha,i love you but it's the only way. No,daddy,I'll be good. Daddy,please. Daddy,please! No! I'll be good. I'll be good.I promise! She was calling for me and i just walked away. I thought i was doing the right thing. How long was she at that hospital? Two weeks. And then she ran away. That's what they told me. Same night she died? Maybe. Maybe if she wasn't scared,i would bring her back to that place. Maybe she would have come home. Thanks for your time,mR.Randall. Hospital******dress ******** Hospital******* Someone****** You got something? Been looking no brookview: ********* Shut down in '72 after three teenagers went through ect. - ******** - ******** It was still experimental, current too high patients came up brain dead. *** Russell concerns died of cancer in '85. And any other leads? Poly learned,nurse at the school. Also worked the night shift on the gender disorder ward at brookview. Quit right around the time sam died. Bring her? Already did. All right,good work. Jeffrey said you're taking my suspension. It wasn't yours to take,scotty. ******** Water under the bridge. It's done. Thanks for... looking out. Leonard is waiting. Right. You coming,boss? As i said,i baring remember the girl. *******Hard to keep them all straight. We know about the other zombies the hospital turned out. Three,to be exact. All under your care. It was horrible what they were doing to those young people. Terrible. You just stood by and let it happened. Doctors don't listen to nurses. It was out of my hands. Why did you quit? After sam died,you just ran for the hills. I didn't run for any damn hills. My whole life I've been holding my tongue,watching men make mistakes. But i begged dr.Cancer to stop. But doctors don't listen to nurses. I thought thought we were helping in the beginning but sam had so much fight in her. They did everything they could to snuff it out. And one more time,pull out your chair... lower yourself slowly into the seat,don't plop. Excellent progress,samantha. Don't scrape the chair if he felicia. And hands in your lap. Lovely.Louise, Louise,do you want dr.Kearns to sends you back to the ect room? Now,let's move on to grooming. Today is lipstick. Remove the cap. Place the lid on the table. Hold the compact mirror open in yoeftur l palm. Now start at the centre of the upper lip and move down to the right. No. You must participate if you're going get better. But I can't get better if I'm not sick. You know this isn't right. You have no idea what these people are capable of,sam. Just Do it. Put on the lipstick,now! You put on the lipstick,buster. And while you're at it,take this! I'm not crazy. This is crazy. Not me. You will behave like a young lady. You call me a lady or a freak... there's nothing wrong with mE. No! No! Sam was right. There was nothing wrong with her. I just couldn't stand watching them destroy her. So i quit. Left her there to rot,too. Real noble of you. I found a friends of hers from school and i let him know what happened. A friend? You mean donald aaron? He was the only one who talked to her. He seemed to be the type who would do the right thing, even if he had to do something against the rules. But you told him to save her? It was my first and last act of rebellion. How did he get past the hospital gate? I gave him the key. Beautiful work. You're not here to talk about stained glass,are you? Same image,over and over. Every piece,that... one figure. Alone against the world. Kind of like sam. I already told you,we were just friends. Hard to believe. Seeing this. Hypothetically speaking,if you love a girl, who is actually a boy inside,what does that make new. I... i didn'T... love sam. Why did you save her? Boy girl,his words,right? *******not what is in here. why do you doing this? You made a deal at the lake to never let them change you,die trying. That's why you brought her back there, the one place she could be free. She was. Free. In the ends. i made sure of that. You didn't put a name on it but it still matters. It Was the only thing that mattered. That's why i went to her. Come on,sam. Let's go,we're getting out of here. Let's gO. Sam. Sam? Come back,come back. Please,sam. Just come back. ******You've got to come back. We had a deal,remember. Is he lake,we can never let them change us. We can always be free or die trying,huh? You remember? Make me free. All right. I can't, i won't,i won't do that,sam. I won't,no way,no way. I know you're in there,sam. I know it's you. But I won't do that,you hear me,i won'T.
