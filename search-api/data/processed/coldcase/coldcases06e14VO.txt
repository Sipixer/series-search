Did you hear about Candy Toliver ? Oh, just can't believe it. I guess you never do know. No, you don't. That Wilson girl from down the street got arrested for singing folk songs at an antiwar rally. Strange times, to be sure. Let me check my book. Can't be the silver polish. You took delivery of that last week. Spray starch ? You do know exactly what I need, Roy. It's my job to know.

This place was a park, right ? Surrounding streets all had access. Weights. Somebody wanted the body to stay down. Can I borrow your coffee ? Got an inscription. "Roy W. Dunn." "Sampson Brush Salesman of the Year, 1966." Door-to-door salesman ? Sampson was a competitor to the Fuller Brush company. Sold a lot more than brushes. Well, somebody didn't like what Roy was selling. Or he knocked on the wrong door. Cold Case Season 6 Episode 14 Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com The brush man Little privacy ? Is something wrong with your dugout ? Flooded. Now if you don't mind, I got to tidy up and tuck in? Roy W. Dunn. 35 years old. Sampson Brush Company regional manager filed a theft report on June 9 alleging Roy checked out company property on June 6, then took off with money collected from customers. Along with $250 worth of Sampson products. Well, guess we can close the books on that one. Search of Roy's tenement room back in '67 yielded nada. Guy lived out of a suitcase. It doesn't sound like Sampson's Salesman of the Year. Don't see many door-to-door salesmen anymore. Ah, different times. Used to be you could get anything from fresh chickens, bibles to <i>Grit</i> magazine delivered right to your door. Yeah, now I got some guy from a phone bank calling me during the game. Lot of these guys just blew into a town looking before moving on to the next one. Well, maybe Roy tried to run off with some lonely housewife. Husband got wind of it, put a stop to it. Well, that or he got mixed up in some scam. Run his name through the NCIC database, see if we got a hit. Hey! Missed a spot. You get anything back from the lab, Nick ? Uh, barbells found with the body were sold in hundreds of places. What about the plastic ? Nothing special. But forensics, uh, found, uh, deep abrasions on his ribcage. Could have been stabbed. Or eaten by snapping turtles. I just got off the horn with Sampson Brush. They're faxing over Roy's route and his customer list. Start a canvas. Might be some folks on the block still remember Roy. Better yet. I got the name of the salesman who took over Roy's route. Harry Hapgood. Uh, he's still out there pounding the pavement. Uh, didn't figure you for tighty-whiteys. Rush. Yeah, she got quite an eyeful. Oh, for the record, they're boxer briefs. Right. And the grooming at work? I'm in a transitional state. What's that mean? Means I got a crick in my neck from sleeping on the office couch. Waking up smelling like nervous perp. You let Toni move in, didn't you ? Yup. And now you're out ? Yup. Roy W. Dunn. That's going way back. When was the last time you saw him ? Would have been a Wednesday. We met every Wednesday for breakfast. Right here, as a matter of fact. One day he didn't show. Summer of '67 ? Second week of June. I remember 'cause that week the company called me to sort out his route. You got a real good memory, Harry. You betcha. Not for nothing I've been selling Sampson for 45 years. Keep the orders up here. What kind of salesman was Roy ? Roy had every housewife on his route pecking out of his hand. Tall, dark and a double shot of mysterious. Mysterious how ? He never talked about his past, and he wasn't from around here. I saw his apartment once, and he slept on the floor. No mattress, no pillow. Nothing but floorboards. Bit of an odd duck, then. he looked like Paul Newman, and he wasn't married. I tell you, there were a lot of steamed housewives when I took over the route for him. He selling something other than brushes ? Come again ? Was Roy having an affair with any of these housewives ? Not that I saw. Roy was all business. And that route of his was what we call low-hanging fruit. Same route you took over when he disappeared, right, Harry ? Stop right there, Detective. I had no beef with Roy. He trained me. He taught me how to get to yes. I'm concerned about your drapes, Joannie. What's wrong with them ? Let's have a look. "These boots are made for walkin'" by Nancy Sinatra.</i> Maybe your friend would like to join us ? Oh. I should get back. Oh, come on, Diane. Roy won't bite. I'd really like you to see this, Diane. You see this dust and dirt right here ? Only way to get rid of it is take down the drapes, launder them and hope you don't ruin them. Who has the time ? Exactly why Sampson created this innovative drape and upholstery brush. Dirt just lifts out. I want one. Harry, write Joannie's order up and throw in a free sample of our new skin care line. Can I put you down for one, Diane ? Diane's husband's a tightwad. - He's got her on a budget. - Joannie. I've got Wednesday afternoon open. I can come by. I should, uh, probably check with my husband. I want you to have this. Oh, I can't. And I insist. Let me know when you want some of our Crystal View Keep that window I see you looking out of every day gin-clear. I'll bet old Roy put that dust on those drapes while no one was looking. Joannie Pogue married ? At the time, but her husband was always away on business. She always putting it out there like that ? Just for old Roy. She around ? 23 Harmondale Lane. Would you like one of my lemon bars, Detective ? Sinfully good. Uh, no, I'm-I'm good. We're here about Roy Dunn. Word travels fast. Heard Roy was quite popular with the local housewives. Well, he was attentive and polite, handy, and he knew exactly what you wanted. What did <i>you</i> want, Joannie ? Detective, are you asking me if I was having an affair with Roy ? Were you ? It was a purely professional flirtation. I liked having Roy over, and he liked selling me his products. Uh, swinging '60s, and Roy wouldn't swing ? Oh, not around here it wasn't. We kept up appearances. You remember last time you saw him ? Easy. I went out in the front yard to get a little color. "Lightning's girl" by Nancy Sinatra.</i> Hey there, buddy. Show you how to throw a slider. Roy. Yes, Joannie. What do you think ? Natalie Wood has one just like it. Oops. Sorry about that. Just toss it back. Hey, in there. Need the ball back. Good luck. Abnormal Norm just added it to his collection. - That's not right. - Take a look, Roy. The whole family's not right. You don't want to go in there. Trust me. Just leave it. Well, I'm going in. If I don't come back call the National Guard. Hold it right there, mister. I'd like the ball back. I'd like you to get off my property. What about this, uh, Abnormal Norm ? Went to Vietnam, stepped on a land mine, scarred his face horribly. Was never right after that. The city's been trying to condemn the house for years. Did he have a problem with Roy ? Hard to tell. He was a bit of a recluse, and the only time I ever saw him was in the park. What was he doing down there ? Feeding the ducks. Got very upset when he heard they were draining the pond to put it more houses. Police. Open up. Hands off the Creedence. Get your damn hands of the vinyl ! This is private property. Wrong move, Rambo. Should have opened up and answered our questions. Just gave us a reason to search this dump. Should have brought your Hazmat suit, boss. What do we got ? Besides a million city code violations ? Quite a collection. Hoarding started with the mom. Son can't bear to throw anything out. She still in the picture ? She passed last year. Over here. Balls and bikes. Looks like Norm had a filing system. Library books, overdue 40 years. And this. Roy W. Dunn. Checked out, never returned. Roy keep track of his appointments ? No, it's mostly notes on who bought what and the money collected. Found this inside. It's addressed to Alice. 100 bucks. Lot of money back then. Payoff ? Well, whatever it was, Roy never got to deliver it. Miller's checking the name against Roy's. That supposed to mean something? Salesman named Roy W. Dunn. - How did you get that book ? - Found it. - In the park by the pond. - How about that. We just found him fertilizing After you killed him and sunk the body. Why would I do that ? Neighbor saw you and Roy having words after he went to get a baseball back for a kid on the street. That's a good motive. Seen folks killed for a pair of $20 kicks and a bus pass. Roy asked, and I gave the ball back. Even though I had every right to keep it. Sounds like a real lifesaver moment. You're a funny guy, Detective. No, what's funny, Norm, is you assaulting a police officer, then keeping a book that ties you to the murder victim. I'd say that's good for 25 years of belly laughs, depending what the jury thinks. This stuff's not gonna work on me, Detectives. Abnormal Norm. The neighborhood bogeyman. What ? You didn't like the way Roy stared at you ? He was not the only one who didn't. Roy was okay by me, but not everyone on the street liked him. "European song" by Velvet Underground.</i> Something wrong ? We didn't order this stuff. Your wife, Diane, placed the order. Well, she must have made a mistake. Okay. But you've already paid for them. And I said... we don't want them. Look, it was not my intention to cause any trouble. Maybe I misunderstood. I know what you're up to. I know your type, mister. I was just doing my job. Then do it somewhere else. Glenn Drew. Guy was a hothead ? Lot of happy, happy, joy, joy crap on that street. Everyone pretending to be normal while the world around was going to the dogs. When was this argument with Glenn? It was maybe a couple of weeks before Roy stopped coming around. Are we done here ? Or are there more of my rights you want to trample? You're not going anywhere, Norm. I didn't kill Roy. The only killing I ever did was for my country. And look what it got me. She gave up <i>her</i> apartment. No reason staying in the same building paying two rents, Giving her the key was your first mistake. Woman could burn. She made an omelet with salami, onions, and peppercinis. Probably making one right now for some other guy. I'm not going there. You're not going home, either. Exactly why you need a plan of action. Got a hit on Roy's name. Turns out he's got an FBI number. So, our boy, Roy, wasn't so squeaky-clean. Number was generated out of New York State in '57. Any indication of the crime ? Haven't digitized records that far back yet. Request a hand search ? Hurry up and wait. Lilly ? You all right ? She's dead. My mother. You asked how she was and... I'm sorry. Lilly, I'm... Thought you might want to know. What happened ? Cirrhosis. Year and a half ago. Never stopped drinking. All those years. Tried to get her to stop. She hid bottles. Disappeared for days. It was her cross. She was staying with me. She just gave in to it. And I let her. All I could do was watch. Wasn't your fault, Lilly. Sorry you had to go through that alone. Somebody had to. Your mother and I... we, uh... Sometimes it's better when people don't stay together. Where is she ? Saint Anne's. Traffic was bad. I didn't have any trouble. Okay, let's do this. Made that myself. It's called the... Crazy X. Looks easy enough. Oh, no. That's a real stumper. We're here about Roy Dunn. That, uh, salesman that turned up ? Shame they're taking out the park and putting in more houses. You purchase Sampson products from him ? Once. Stuff was all overpriced. Where are my manners ? Would anybody like something to drink ? A soda, glass of wine ? Honey, it's 3:00. Oh, um, I'll make some coffee. Um, I'll help. It won't take long. Uh, Glenn got this new machine. Beans to brew in five minutes. Want to tell us about the argument you had with Roy ? Didn't like Roy with your wife when you were at work. Actually, it had to do with my son, Kevin. You're gonna have to be more specific, Glenn. Kevin was having trouble at school. Moody, getting in fights and... Roy have something to do with that ? I had a bad feeling about the gu Just wasn't right. 35-year-old bachelor spending time with a 15-year-old kid. "Let it out" by The Hombre.</i> You're dropping your elbow. Use your legs. Were you good enough to play in the big leagues ? At one time. I knew it. I was your age, used to play all day just to get out of the house. What do you mean ? My house wasn't a place you wanted to be. Kevin ! Get in the car, son. I didn't mean... You are not allowed in the park without permission. What do you think you're doing ? Just showing him some pitches. Kid's got a hell of an arm. I thought I made myself clear. I don't want you around my family. Look, I didn't mean any... No, you look. I catch you hanging around Kevin again, I'll call the cops. Sorry. It won't happen again. I didn't like the way he looked at me. I didn't like he was spending time with my son. So, I called the police. They share your concerns ? They said there just wasn't much they could do unless this Roy did something. You take matters into your own hands ? No. But one night I was coming home from work and I saw him standing outside this woman's house. I mean, there he was just... lurking around some other family. Where was this ? Kettle Street. It's on the other side of the park. The guy was up to no good. I was just trying to protect my family. Understandable. We're gonna need a number for Kevin. Oh, sure thing. Here's one. "Free rent in exchange for light clerical and a weekly massage." I better call on that one right away. For somebody out there, that's the perfect arrangement. Not this cowboy. Just got Roy's jacket from the FBI. Manslaughter ? Did seven years in Sing Sing. Killed a guy named Jim Mills in a bar fight in Albany. Check out the name of his widow. Alice Mills. Same Alice on the envelope we found in Roy's book? Lives right here in Philly. Kettle Street. Six blocks from the park. Same place Glenn Drew saw Roy watching that woman. Looks like Roy had a past. And it caught up to him with a vengeance. Of course I remember Roy Dunn. How could I not ? When was the last time you saw him, Alice ? Why are you asking me about Roy ? 'Cause we found his body six blocks from your old house. Roy killed your husband in a bar fight back in Albany. I lived through it, Detective. I know what happened. He made you a widow. Served his time, then he follows you down here ? Fill in the blanks for us, Alice. We found this in Roy's notebook. Maybe you can shed some light on what the money was for. Look, Roy and my husband were teammates on the Albany Senators. Minor league baseball. Roy's curve ball was good enough for the majors. Jim's talent was drinking too much and taking it out on the one person who wouldn't fight back. He hit you ? Yes. Roy took offense. He saw me with a black eye. Told Jim if he laid another hand on me, he'd be sorry. Roy swung first ? That's what the witnesses said. After the trial, my son and I moved to Philly. Then, out of the blue, these envelopes filled with money would show up in my mailbox. Roy ? What are you doing ? - Nothing, I... - Roy, please, wait ! I want to talk to you. Sorry, I shouldn't be here. I just want to help. By sneaking around and leaving money ? For what I did to you. I shouldn't have gotten involved. Everybody knew what Jimmy was doing and they all chose to look the other way. I couldn't do that. And I should've walked away the first time he hit me. He didn't deserve you. That's in the past now, Roy. I don't blame you. I spent every day in that cell thinking about what I'd done to you. Should've just walked away. You're not the walking-away kind. I know. Sometimes I wish I could be. Did he say anything else that day ? No, we just talked about his job. But I thought there was something about one of those houses that was eating at him. You ask him about it ? Said he had a clear view of things. I thought he was talking about a woman. But I got a sense that there was more to it. Hello, Diane. Oh, excuse me. On sale. Hmm, mother's little helper. - I'm sorry ? - The phone number you gave us for your son, Kevin, didn't work. Turns out he moved. Two years ago. Oh, Glenn must've given you the old number. Sure, I just thought maybe you had a falling out. You still talk with your son ? My husband already answered your questions. But you didn't. Made sure you were out of the room while he answered for you. What's this all about ? You and Roy. Glenn tell you to lie ? What are you insinuating ? Glenn's a pretty controlling guy. Seen a few of his type in my day. That how you cope with it? Glenn is a very good man. But Roy... Something you want to tell me, Diane ? You weren't alone. Just lonely. - No, please ! - Can't say I blame you, husband like Glenn. But if he found out that you were having an affair... It wasn't an affair. It wasn't anything. Diane. I want to help you. It's... It's Glenn. He's not at work when he says he is and when I ask him   about it, he lies to me. When he's home, it's even worse. It doesn't get any better. I'm just... I'm so tired of pretending that everything is perfect when it's not. It's what people do here. I see it every day. You could leave. No, no, I can't leave. That would, uh... that would be impossible, Roy. Is it ? Mom ? No, Kevin ! Kevin, wait ! Letting Kevin see me with Roy like that was the biggest mistake of my life. What did Roy do after that ? He went to find Kevin. Did you see Roy after that ? No, I assumed he did the gentlemanly thing and transferred routes. You blame that on Kevin, seeing you with Roy ? The only thing that mattered was my son. And I felt like I lost him that day. Where is he now ? I wish I knew. Got a line on Kevin. Lives outside of Scranton. Jeffries is bringing him in. Diane says her son caught her with Roy. Wasn't too happy about it. Around the same time Roy disappeared. His folks finally just shipped him off to Valley Forge. Military school ? During the Vietnam War? One way to straighten out a mixed-up kid. Or get rid of a big problem. Parents had good timing, Kevin. Sent you to military academy at the height of the Vietnam War. Push-ups and screaming might work for some kids. Not me. I... I ditched that place. And before that, public school. A school nurse sent you home with a broken wrist end of your sophomore year. June 7, 1967. Day after, Roy Dunn disappeared. Roy Dunn ? Door-to-door salesman. You remember. Used to play ball with him. Yeah, maybe I did. What's one got to do with the other? How did you break your wrist, Kevin ? I don't know. I got in a lot of fights back then. Roy one of 'em ? I never had a problem with Roy. No ? Not even after you saw him with your mother ? We spoke to her. Said you were pretty upset about what you saw. Leave her out of this. All of sudden ? She's my mother. When's the last time you called her ? What is this ? Must have had a good reason to cut her out of your life like that. Like seeing her with another guy ? Still disgusts you to think she was unfaiful to your father. You got it all wrong. Used to lift weights, Kevin? I look like I lift weights? Past has a way of getting dredged up. Just like a body in the bottom of a pond in a park. Where you two used to play. I did see Roy that day I got hurt, but it wasn't 'cause of him. I was already a mess. You don't know what it was like living in the middle of that. Kevin. Kevin... please. What you saw.... What, what happened to you ? Did you get into a fight at school ? No. Let me see. Who did this to you ? It was your father, wasn't it ? Why ? I can't. You told your father about Roy and your mom and he took it out on the messenger. Then he went after Roy ? No. That's not what happened. Then what did happen, Kev ?! Nick, uh, why don't you go get Kevin a soda ? 42 years is a long time to keep a secret. I didn't know Roy was dead. What'd you tell him that day ? He wanted to... ...know why my dad hit me. Why, Kevin ? Because of what I saw. Dad ? I'll never forget that look on his face. You know, he... I thought I did something wrong. He made you think that. Old man, he... he chased me down, gave me the beating of my life. He threatened worse if I said a word to anybody. But you told Roy. Roy went to confront your father. A part of me... wanted him to... take me and my mother out of that house. All she put up with. Well... some people shouldn't stay together. Took me a long time to figure that out. Still my dad though, you know ? Nice setup you got here, Glenn. Why don't you put the tools down and step away from the bench. What's going on here ? - Did Diane let you in ? - You're a real handy guy. Kept it together all these years. Kept what together, Detective ? Appearances. Why Diane needs a bottle of wine to make it through the day. I don't have to stand here, listen to this. You got something you want to ask me about, ask it. How 'bout that bunk you fed us about being the good father, protecting your family from Roy. It's a real stumper, Glenn. I'd like you to leave now. You couldn't be happy, so neither could anyone else. Smacking your wife around, - beating your kid. - I never laid a hand on them. Not what Kevin told us. But Roy knew what you did to him. And why. You still hitting the park after hours, Glenn ? You got too old for that ? Or maybe you got a toe-tapping thing going at the airport This is ridiculous. - I'm not the criminal here... - We're cops, Glenn. You don't think we know what all the loitering tickets at Judy Garland Park mean ? You're, you're twisting things around. You did a pretty good job of that yourself. But Roy could tell. He had that eye. Saw right through you. Confronted you. But you couldn't handle it. Made Roy out to be the monster, but it was you. Wasn't it, Glenn ? He had no right. Was still my house. My house ! My family ! I was a good father. I saw Kevin. Get the hell out of here. I'm not going anywhere. You're trespassing. - You want me to call the police ? - Go ahead. They might like to hear what you did to Kevin. What are you talking about ? Shouldn't hit him, Glenn. Kevin is all mixed up. That why you busted his arm ? I went away for a long time, Glenn. Learned to keep my mouth shut and look the other way. I'm done doing that now. And you're done bullying Kevin and Diane. Who the hell are you to tell me how to run my family ? Some nobody salesman. It's over, Glenn. I know about the park. What ? You don't know what you're talking about. Can't even admit who you are so you take it out on them. You shut your mouth. You need to leave, Glenn, right now. Let Diane and Kevin live their lives. I will do no such thing. You don't deserve them.
