I got the money. I just left it up in my room.MARCH 15, 2009 I'll fetch it. FIVE MINUTES AGO. Let me grab a tallboy for the journey. No deal. You know I'm good for it. That's not the point. You can barely stay upright as it is. What you care? Long as you get paid. Oh, Landry, come on. What kind of man would I be if I let one of my loyal customers go out in the dead of winter with a half a load on? I take full responsibility. It's not happening. I tell you what. I'll spot you a cup of coffee for the road. You can give me the two bits in the AM. You're welcome. Landry, I done told you, I'm not serving you tonight. Don't even think about it. Oh, come on. How about some Talk radio? Sports, politics. Anything but this. Now, you're talking about the Temptations. And it's freaking depressing. Somebody always crying about losing their girl or their house. I don't need to hear it. I'm living it. You got no culture. If I admit it, will you turn it off? No. What now? Out of milk. We'll get some in the morning. We just worked a double. Well, you should have considered that before you finished off the last half-gallon. Anyone here? Hello? Will?! WILL? Where the hell are you?! Oh, God. This is Detective Vera. Officer down. Officer down! Grocery store, Fifth and Main. I need rescue! Rush. Sweetheart. Wake up, angel. Come on, baby. Wake up. Come on. We're going to Grandma's, okay? I got to work tonight. - Close enough to your place? - Sure. Sorry I can't walk you. Well, maybe we can do this again. BP is 50/33. Respiratory distress. Prep for intubation. Anything I need to know about this patient? Allergies, medical conditions, prescriptions? I don't... I could find out. No time. Is he going to be okay? Nick? I drank all the damn milk. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- COLD CASE 617</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë: Ð£¶Ô: Ê±¼äÖá:ÎÒ°®Ê¨ÐÄÐ¡s</font> I spoke to the paramedics. Two victims. Store owner, Henry Walters. Goes by Pops. Yeah, other one's a cop. What's their condition? Multiple gunshot wounds. Taken to Saint Paul's. One expired on the table. Which one? - Um. - The cop or the owner? Come on. Walters. It was definitely Walters. What about Jeffries? The cop. ??? Call comes in. I'm first on the scene. - What did you see? - Not much. Detective shot on the floor. - His partner, big guy. - Vera? Yeah. Points me out the back. I made chase, but the shooter is in the wind. Robbery? This area? Robbery, drug deal, gang retribution. Your guy walks in. Wrong place, wrong time. - Yeah. - Witnesses? Deaf, dumb, and blind. I need details! You saw something, heard something, know something, step up now. Oh, this is funny to you? Cop got shot, jag-off. Toss him in the wagon. You worried about being a snitch? That crap ends here. Or we'll waterboard your ass if we got to. We're going to find out what happened. Hey. Hey, hey, you. Come here. What's your name? Landry. I ain't seen nothing. You know the store, right, Landry? Pops was real good to me. He had a special place in HIS heart for screw-ups. You been drinking tonight, Landry? I don't see why tonight would be different than any other. I likes my beer. How's about a case? I heard a gun go off. One shot. Then two more. How long between the shots? Was it "bang," then "bang-bang"? I was crossing the street when I heard the first shot. When the others came, I was like a whole 'nother block away. You'll get your cash back at the station. Come on. Him, too. Detective Jeffries' family? Haven't been able to reach his sister, so... How is he? He was shot twice in the back. One bullet lodged in the ribcage. - How bad? - Missed his vital organs. We removed it without incident. - The other bullet? - Punctured a lung, which collapsed. As soon as he's stabilized, we'll get him out of trauma and MOVE HIM INTO SURGERY. What's it looking like? A long night. Put me on the street, boss. Let me find the scumbag who shot Will. You're in no condition, Nick. I'm telling you... all the training, nothing can prepare you for when it all goes down. TWO HOURS AGO, This is Detective Vera. Officer down. Officer down! Grocery store, Fifth and Main. I need rescue! Hold on, buddy. Hold on. Got to apply pressure to that wound. Police! Who's there?! I'm a cop! I'm a cop! Someone went out the back. Just one? I don't know. You hold on, buddy, okay? You hold on. I'm here. I'm here. I'm going to apply pressure to this wound, okay? HOLD ON. Cop must have been a block away when the call came in. Did you get a look at the shooter? What about before you went in the store? You notice anyone? You hear anything? The first gunshot, maybe? Nothing. So, he was in the store when you pulled up. Pops was already shot. What was he doing in there? He wasn't robbing the place. Cash in the till. Pops' watch and wallet were on him when he reached the hospital. Maybe the shooter was looking for something else. Three shell casings. Nine-millimeter. Will comes in. Goes for the milk. Shooter jumps up. Opens fire. Bloody footprints say the doer  runs out the back. 'Cause Vera's coming in the front. He kicks open the back door, takes off down the alley. Got video surveillance up front. It's back here, too. Tapes haven't been touched in years. Here's hoping they still play. I've met this girl. ONE WEEK AGO Valentine's out there somewhere. Who knows what he'll do? What happened, Carmen? They had some kind of argument. I've never seen Pops so angry. You know the old man. He don't back down for nothing. Neither does Valentine. You should have seen the look in his eyes. Okay. - Don't worry about it, sweetheart. - I'll take care of it. Okay? We just found Pops' next of kin. GRANDPA AND CARMEN GRADUATION 2006 Carmen comes to Will 'cause she's worried about this Valentine. Will was here for a whole lot more than milk. Wait, what kind of gun? No, no, look. Tell your snitch we're looking for a nine-millimeter. Yep. Any news? They moved him up to surgery. Need blood? - Something like that? - No. They're good, Scotty. You okay? Sorry. Tip line's overwhelmed. Some schmuck gives my number instead. - What do you got? - Putting the screws to known stick-up men, LOCAL DEARLERS AND BANGERS, but it's looking like Will was in the store for a reason. - He knew Pops? - Might have been some kind of falling out between Pops and a guy goes by the name Valentine. What kind of falling out? I'm hoping Pops' granddaughter Carmen can fill in the blanks. Neighbor said she's a student over at Temple. Miller's bringing her in. You checking the system for Valentine? Wait a minute, that name. No, Detective Jeffries is not here. What time's the kid getting arraigned? Yeah. "Valentine"? Got it. I'll make sure he gets it. Cop on the other line said Valentine was up on a gun charge. But he was holding off on filing till Jeffries called him back. Would this connect to a case? Not that I know of. Maybe he's got a phone number for Valentine in his things. He win a bet or something? Will never carries more than a couple bucks. No Valentine in here. We get a description at least? I mean, that cop, that first responder, he get a look at the doer when he went after him? McGinley? No. Pete McGinley? Yeah. You know him, boss? He went to PPD to sort out witnesses. Colleague of mine works the felony unit. Said he was preparing a complaint for a James Valentine on handgun possession a couple months ago. What happened? He's on his way to court, gets a call from the arresting officer, ??? HE MADE A MISTAKE. Your buddy get the officer's name? Yeah. Kendrick. Works the Fifth Distct.. I need you to find an Officer Kendrick at the Fifth District. I don't care where he is. Get him down here. Does this James Valentine got a record? Nothing recent. All juvenile. Records are sealed. Yeah. Not anymore. How'd you get these unsealed at 3:00 in the morning? Uh, you, uh... you really want to know? Assault, robbery, shoplifting. Valentine was 17 last time he was in front of a judge. He got a choice. Hard prison time or military service. He chose Uncle Sam. Since then he's stayed out of trouble. Until now. ??? I stay until we charge someone for shooting a cop. Your dad. Appreciate it. EXCUSE ME. Scotty... I'm sorry about Jeffries. Is he going to be okay? It's too soon to tell. If you want to talk or... Did ya get anything off the security video FROM POP'S STORE? Tape from the front door is useless. The one from the back is deteriorated. Thinking binder breakdown. Some TLC, I might be able to rescue it. TLC's your specialty, ain't it? It's not so funny now, huh? Scotty, what's up? Naw, just, you know, Will. He's still in surgery... Yeah. You heading over there? Maybe later. I just spoke to the cop who arrested Valentine for gun possession. Couple months back, Valentine gets pulled over for running a light. .38 in the glove box. We got an address for him? We broke down the door. No one home. But left a small army to bring him in if he shows up. How's Jeffries fige inin? Well, he asked Kendrick for a personal favor; letting Valentine off the hook. Will's not the type to bend the rules. Won't even take a free cup of coffee. Makes you wonder what Valentine means to him. Follow me. Valens tells me you been a help. Doing what I can. Where do you live, McGinley? Gray's Ferry. That's a long way from Pops' store. Happy accident you being so close when the shooting went down? My night off. I can't sleep. I like to drive. Make a habit of driving an unmarked city vehicle with a police radio into the ghetto on your night off? I know two things about you, McGinley. One: when you were in uniform you were Deputy Commissioner ??? And two: when you made detective, he had you transferred to Internal Affairs. But what I don't know is what the hell you were doing following one of my detectives around. A couple of months ago, JeJeries fixed a gun charge on a convicted felon. If he did, he had his reasons. Yeah, and I know what they were. YESTERDAY. You got no idea what you saw. Come on, Lieutenant. He gets Valentine out of a jam. A few weeks later, he's collecting his bonus. Probably got him shot. Get out of here. Go back to Doherty. I'm a cop first. I want to help. You're not welcome here. Pops'd bring in the troubled kids. Ones who put up the biggest front. Give 'em a job. Try to school 'em. You know where Valentine is now, Carmen? There was an argument about week ago, over money, I think. Pops hit him. Valentine ran off. I told Pops, "Get out of the neighborhood. " He said these kids'd be lost without him. Valentine's not at his apartment. You know where else he could be? He works nights. A restaurant, I think. Which one? What kind of food? Burgers? Tacos? What am I going to do now? Pops looked out for me. He was my only family. All these cops here, they're ready to move. Find the guy who shot your grandfather. But we need your help. Can I see him? I'll take you to the hospital, soon as we're done. Chicken. It's a chicken place on Susqie. SUSQIE, YEAH, LET'S GO. Kid's been here all night. I would never hurt Pops! Word on the street is you're the dangerous type. Got the record to prove it. That was the past, man. I've changed. A gun you were pulled over with a few weeks ago SAYS DIFFERENT. Gun wasn't even for me! That gun was for Pops. A kid comes to me. He said he wants $50 a week. Protection, he tells me. I tell him to just go. But he came back, didn't he? Acting tough, knocking stuff over. Ain't no act. The Dominicans play for keeps. They already took over the drug trade. How you going to stand tall? Kids is kids. You were just like that not too long ago. Look at you now. Put a quarter down there. Pops, I was going to pay for it, man. I'm just saying the neighborhood's changed since my day. Your day? Your day was three years ago. This is another punk who thinks he's the baddest ass in the neighborhood. You the boss. It's good you remembered that. SNITCH What the hell? It's a prank. Nah, this ain't no prank, Pops. Man, we got to get you some real protection. What, a gun? I been running this store for 40 years. I stood my ground. And I didn't need no gun to do it. Name's Francisco Ariza. He's the first guy that ever got under Pops' skin. Your brilliant idea to get a gun. That why you and Pops argued? Somebody had to stand up to Francisco. And I needed money to do it. - To buy another gun. - Damn straight. I was going to persuade that Dominican son of a bitch to stay away FROM THE OLD MAN Your man Jeffries stops me before I get it. at the roll of cash Jeffries took from you yesterday? I stole it from Pops. Your man must have been bringing it back to him when he got shot. Are we square? No, we ain't square. You tell us where to find Francisco. Then do us all a favor: stop being so helpful. How long's it take to get a ballistics report?! No, I'm done talking to you! I want Carla on the phone now! Hung up. Everyone's doing what they can, Nick. - They pick up Valentine yet? - Alibi'd out. The gun he had was for protecting Pops from a local banger, Francisco Ariza. - Let's go get him. - It's being handled. When was the last time you slept? They been working on Will for hours. I need to do something for him, boss. Come on. What the hell am I supposed to do here? Will? No news. I saw you praying, I figured... He's holding on. I got a record for FrANciscO Ariza. Runs with Mara Este. Carjacking, gun possession, extortion. Gang's hard-core. Francisco's been shaking down local businesses for protection money. But Pops wouldn't pay. So Francisco makes him an example for the rest of the neighborhood? Do we know where he is? Last known address was his mother's. She died four years ago. When Francisco's not locked up, he's with a girlfriend in West Kensington. We got anything we can bring hiin with? Open bench warrant: possession with intent. Rush and Valens are on it. - If they're lucky, he tries to run. - Shh! Hey, buddy, listen, shush me again, and I'll take your tongue and I'll shove it...! Nick, let it go. What is it with people? It's a chapel. He's going to be okay. Nothing. Coffee's still on. Someone was here not too long ago. Landlord said the girlfriend's out of town. Maybe Francisco went for smokes? I don't think he's coming back. I'll call Bell for a search warrant. I'll wake the judge. Heard on the radio about a homicide detective getting shot. He a friend of yours? Name's Will Jeffries. I've known him a while now. He going to pull through? That's what they're saying. Anyway, I guess I just wanted to see your face. Okay. I want you to have this. ??? If you're anything like me, you don't go in for spiritual mumbo-jumbo. Still... it's given me comfort during some hard times. Uh, thanks. Be careful out there, okay? Yeah, sure. Who's that? My father. Cooper. Yeah. Heard about Will, wanted to make sure I'm all right. Yeah. Tells me, "Be careful. " No idea the same thing happened to me. Funny, right? Where you going? Hospital. FBI tracked Francisco's cell phone GPS for you. What is it, 7:00 a. m.? Never known Feds to be so quick on the uptake. Eh, special agent in charge owes me money. Can't play Hold 'em to save his life. Signal traces to the Marshall housing projects. That's two blocks from Pops' store. Hey, listen, do me a favor. Don't take it easy on him. That's a promise. Francisco doesn't live here. Kind of hard to believe, seeing as we found your nephew's cell phone ON THE KITCHEN TABLE. He left it last time he came by. That was a few days ago. I been sick all week. I got the bronchitis. He hasn't been back. But he made a call yesterday? How's that happen? No idea. Okay, this number belongs to his girlfriend. - What about the others? - How should I know? Look, I want you out of my apartment. I got my rights! I'll give you a right. And a couple lefts, too, if you don't start talking straight. Hey, that was my mother's! We don't give a rat's ass about the FURNITURE. We want Francisco. How about you, Gabriel? I don't know where he is. I'd say the same thing to protect my older brother. But the best way to help is telling me how to find him. A lot of cops out there pissed off 'cause of what he did. They're not going to consider his well-being. But... I'll guarantee his safety. One younger brother to another. I'm not telling you nothing! Old man got what he deserved. FIVE DAYS AGO. You get the number or what? All right, what you want, man? You want some chips, some popcorn or what? Can I get both? Yeah. Take them. You going to pay for that? Consider it an advance on the money you owe me. 50 a week. You listen, Boricua... I ain't no Boricua, man. I'm Dominican. What you are is a disrespectful little pissant. Didn't your father teach you respect? Yo, don't talk about my father, man. Well, let me guess. Your daddy ran off and he got lost in a crack pipe, killed? Ain't no version of that I haven't heard. It's no excuse. You think you're a big man because you hustle honest folks ??? You're a fool. Spend your time playing tough, dodging bullets. For what?! A fat roll?! It doesn't matter. You're still going to be dead or in jail by the time you're 25. Now, me... I pay minimum wage. And I make you earn it. But it's honest. And it'll give you something your thugging never did: a future. You got the stones to work for that? Are you man enough TO SEND example for this young one here? Nah. You ain't nothing. You put that stuff down, and you get the hell out of my store. Old man shouldn't have said that. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY BROTHER. Yeah, and Francisco shouldn't have shot him. - Screw you! - Tell me where he is, or I put you and auntie here in cuffs, toss youse in a cell. I don't know. Right. Come on. Come on. Hear our man's going to make a full recovery. Came here as soon as I could. You found time to put on the dress blues. I want to convey to Detective Jeffries the thanks of a grateful city. News cameras are downstairs, Pat. You're too cynical, John. This from the guy who investigates one of my detectives because Grover Boone's got a personal beef with me. IAB has a legitimate reason to investigate Detective Jeffries. Well, not anymore. Tell Boone Jeffries wasn't on the take. He was retrieving stolen property, and I got proof. For the record, it isn't Councilman Boone who has the beef. I don't like the way you do things. Frankly, I don't like you, John. Never have. That's fine, Pat. But you ever mess with someone under my command again... What'll you do, John? I will beat the ever-loving crap out of you. Feel like you got hit by a bus, huh? It's more like a freight train. Pops? He was a friend of yours, huh? He was more than that. You're not going to buy nothing today? Just looking. Did that beer just fall in your pocket? Boy, you been robbing me blind for months. I'm sick of it. I see you hanging out on the streets, giving your mother a hard time, bullying those other kids. Call the cops on me. Son, you owe me $79.27. I ain't got no money. Then you're going to work it off. I know your father left, and it's tough times. But I tell you what, I don't care. You're a man now. You got a man's choice. Take this broom and start earning or get ready for the whupping of your young life. I took that broom, worked there every day. He was the one got me into football, straightened me out. You think he would've given you that whupping? Without a doubt. Pops is... was... pretty mean when he wanted to be. I don't know what the neighborhood's going to do without him. You up to talking about the case? Yeah. Recognize him? Ah, Francisco Ariza. He the one who shot you? I didn't see who shot me. But this guy's been giving Pops trouble for a long time, shaking him down. You knew about that? Yeah. This whole thing with Pops and Valentine, we could've helped you with that. Some roads you got to travel alone. Been turning over every rock looking for this kid. Aunt's house, local hangouts, his girlfriend's place... Girlfriend? Which one? ??? ARIZA, ??? VALENTINE. Now we square. This way. Valentine dropped his gun. Was just sitting here when the cops came in. What size were the shoes we pulled out of the trash can? Was average. Nine, ten maybe. Those look average size to you? Valentine shot the wrong guy. Doer's still out there. Well, Will Jeffries spent a lot of time keeping you out of trouble. Fixed it when you got caught with a gun and stopped you from buying another. So where'd you get this one from? Luther's Chicken. Manager keeps it in his office in case we get robbed. You turned your life around, Valentine. You made something of yourself. And you just threw it away. I warned Francisco. Stay away from Pops! He laughed at me! And y'all ain't lift a finger to help. Somebody had to make him pay. You screwed up, though. 'Cause you killed the wrong guy. Get out of here, wrong guy. Francisco killed Pops! - Cold! - Why are you so sure? 'Cause he told me! Get in there! Whoa, wait, hold on, man. Put the gun down, yo! - You just couldn't leave Pops alone! - Que haces?!</i> Why'd you got to go and kill him?! I been here all night, all right? Look, ask her if you don't believe me. He's been here all night, okay, papa! He's been here! Why should I believe you, man? Why should I believe you?! Get in there. Come on. Get in there. Get in there! Get in there! Look, man, I'm sorry, okay? - It was a mistake! - A mistAKE? Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Just look, you got it all wrong. All right, man, look, we got to be men about this. - We got to work this out. - Calm down, papa! Where were you at midnight? Answer me! That's what I thought. No! No, no, no! He got what he deserved. Got the footprints at the murder scene. Shoes and a shirt the killer wore. None of them match Francisco. You understand what I'm saying? He was as innocent as you. And now he's as dead as Pops. No, no, no. You're going to have a lot of time to think on that in prison. Why he ain't just tell me then? Hmm? Hey, hey, hey. I want to apologize for the way I acted before. My buddy was in a bad way for a while. It's no excuse. But he pulled through. I was way out of line. You got every right to take a swing at me if you want. I hope everything's okay with your loved ones, too. Don't want to talk about it, that's cool. Nick? When was the last time you slept? I'm really getting the hang of this, uh, prayer thing. Just don't set off the smoke alarm. Did you see Will? Yeah. Hey, why don't you go home, huh? Catch some Zs. I'll stay here. It's Will's place. Not mine. Wouldn't feel right. Him being here, me being there. Well, anytime something like this happens... It's part of the job; we all know that. But you just never think... I mean... I don't know. Yeah. Me, too. Video was in bad shape. Polyurethane from the tape absorbed water. I had to go in and dry it by hand. Literally baked the tape with a hairdryer.. and a bunch of other stuff you guys don't care about. Here's what I got. This is from a few hours before the shooting. Good job, Frankie. - YEAH. - Yeah, thanks. Francisco and Pops made peace? He all but took responsibility for Pops' murder with his dying breath. Protecting someone? Who? I know who. Hey. Where's the kid who was in here? Gabriel? I told you to watch him. Cut him loose. His brother died; no need to keep him. Right? Open up! Police! Let's see your hands, Gabriel. Gun! Scotty? I'm okay. You're making a mistake, Gabriel. You killed my brother! Put the damn gun down! We didn't touch Francisco. That's a lie! You going to shoot my partner? Is that the big plan here? This isn't a game! And those weren't warning shots. I won't miss again. Listen to her, Gabriel. This isn't what your brother died for. You don't know about my brother! I know Francisco was smart. He made peace with Pops. Wanted this feud to end. NO. He hated that old man. Maybe. But he knew Pops was right. He took that job. No! You figure he'd be proud of you for killing Pops? Shooting my friend? I mean, think about it. 9 HOURS AGO What happened? What happened?! Gabriel, what happened? What'd you do? What have you done?! - No, no! - Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Francisco was looking out for you. It's what a man does. He took a bullet so you could have a life. Don't let it end here. Be a man. I don't need an excuse to take you out. I want to. Give me a reason not to. All clear. Come on. Gonna need an ambulance. You got to believe me. I didn't mean it. 10 HOURS AGO I told you, Landry. I'm not serving you tonight. Anyone here?
