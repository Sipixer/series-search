Ready? I was born ready. Good, 'cause today's the day I'm going to kick your butt. Why, you been practicing on the side? Oh, that's for me to know and you to find out, all right. Hey, so I heard they're trying to get roller skating into the 1980 Olympics. Wow, it's about time. And if we train really hard, maybe we can make it. It would be so cool to win a medal. Can you imagine being that good? Yep. I'm going to beat you one of these days. Oh, dream on. This is Dawn Whelan. She claims to have information on an old case. Captain Fashion says if I tell you what I know, I get one of those downward departures. Well, that's up to the judge. All we can do is listen. You made it sound like a done deal. Well, tell us what you got. If we think it's worth investigating, we'll see what we can do. High school girl was found dead in Fairmount Park back in '78. Missy Gallavan. All over the news. You never found the guy who did it, did you? You saw the guy? No. But I saw the van she was getting in. - In the park? - No. Outside a roller rink in Mayfair. One of those customized vans, had a picture painted on the side What kind of picture? A spaceship. You see little green men, too? I know what I saw. - What color was the van? - Black. - What were you doing outside the rink? - Smoking a little herbal remedy. And did you know Missy? I'd seen her around the rink. Girl could skate. But you didn't say anything in '78. My jackass boyfriend boosted a car the next night. We hightailed it to Florida. Got the "gimme"s in a bunch of liquor stores. Just couldn't say no to old Captain Morgan. - Hmm. - What they got you for now? Armed robbery. Looking at ten to 12. But what I told you, that's got to be worth something, right? We'll let you know. That's it? I got to go back to lockup? That girl's family's been in the dark for 30 years while you sat on that information. I think you and Captain Fashion can sweat a few days while we check if your story holds water. Okay, Dawn? ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- COLD CASE 604</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- Ê±¼äÖá:ÎÒ°®Ê¨ÐÄÐ¡s</font> Ever go to the roller rink back in the '70s? Roller disco back then. Like a regular club, just on skates. I had the ones that clipped on your sneakers. I used a key to tighten them. Outdoor skates. Old school. I spent hours patrolling the neighborhood. I was more into the night scene. Ah, rocking the leisure suit? Watch yourself now. I bet I'm faster. Trust me, Lil... different leagues. Missy Gallavan, 15 years old. A jogger discovered her body in a ravine in Fairmount Park, near Tacony Creek. Time of death around midnight. Blunt-force trauma to the head, possibly from a fall. Abrasions on her knees and palms, broken fingernails... They had a series of assaults in the park that summer. Mother said she was a tomboy, but it looks like she went party - with the wrong guy. - You could fill a book with the things teenage girls don't tell their mothers. The mother Simone was a legal secretary, worked until 2:00 a. m. that night. Well, Missy had gone to the rink with a girl named Julie Reed. They split up around 10:00, but no one saw her take off. That leaves two hours unaccounted for. Anything could have happened. Blue fibers found on the body. Looked like carpet. Could be shag from the spaceship van? It was the '70s. They save the nail clippings? It looks like, but no DNA in '78, so they couldn't test them. Hmm. Let's get them from Evidence, send them to the lab. We got science on our side now. My daughter never would have gone to the park with some stranger. Missy wasn't who they made her out to be. Well, we're not here to judge your daughter, Mrs. Gallavan. I know what the police and everybody else thought. Well, we're looking into a possible new lead on her murder. Did you or Missy know anyone with a customized van? Why, you think someone with a van hurt Missy? Maybe someone she went to school with? From the neighborhood? I didn't really know anybody in the neiborhood. After my husband and I split up, Missy and I moved into an apartment in Mayfair that summer. Was Missy's father in the picture? He took off for California with his dental hygienist. Wanted a "fresh start. " I went back to work. Missy told you she was going to the rink with a friend? I trusted my daughter. Missy knew if she couldn't get a ride home, she could call and I'd come and pick her up. Did she ever call that night? It's the first time I let her go with that Julie. And look what happened. Julie Reed? Missy had met her a couple of weeks before at the apartment complex. I should never have let her get mixed up with a girl like that. * Danger in the shape of something wild * * Stranger dressed in black * * She's a hungry child * I've seen you at the rink. - You're pretty good. - Thanks. - Can you hoot the moon?" - I'm more of a fast skater. I could maybe show you a few things... if you wanted. Sure. Once you know some spins and stuff, we can go to the rink at night. The real action happens after 9:00. Oh, that's for over 18. I'm only 15. They won't let me in. They will if you're with me. I have connections. You know, you could be pretty if you wore a little makeup, played up your eyes. Oh, I'm really bad with all that. Lucky for you, I'm an expert. We're about the same size. I could lend you clothes. What's wrong with my clothes? By the time I'm done, you won't recognize yourself. Julie was, uh... fast. A lot of attitude. She told detectives she was at the rink with Missy before they got split up. Yeah, that's what she said, all right. Some friend she turned out to be. Uh-uh, no way. Last time you hooked me up, the guy wore flip-flops and forgot his wallet. - Onions? - Sure. No, Mom, I'm not talking to you. - Cheese? - Heart attack special. - Heart attack. - Okay, okay, fine. - Thanks, Jake. - But you're babysitting. What? My mother met some guy at church, and now I have a date tomorrow night. That a bad thing? You ever had a good blind date? I don't do blind dates. I like to see what I'm getting into. Yeah, me, too. I talked to a buddy in Narcotics. Most of the guys that detailed vans in the '70s are tattoo artists or T-shirt airbrushers now. What kind of loser paints a spaceship on their car? It was the '70s. Star Wars, that Boston album...</i> Parliament Funkadelic. Uh-uh, brothers were not painting spaceships on vans. Not anymore. Those guys got your mom down at church setting them up on blind dates now. See, now, that was uncalled for. Pretty isolated up here, especially at night. Just that one streetlight up on the road. The string of assaults on the park in '78, everyone knew not to come here after dark. Tell a teenager not to do something, it just makes them want do it more. Yeah, so say she meets a guy at the rink. They get in his van, come here for some quality time. Things start to heat up... Or don't get as hot as he wants it. She fights back, and he blows a fuse. Tosses her over the edge. Done and done. Or she gets out of the car, starts to run... It's dark; she can't see where the pavement ends... Wham, she hits the wall, topples over. Humpty Dumpty. One nasty fall. Yeah. You do any artwork on vans back in the '70s? Yeah, right. I am sure your sunsets would rock my world, sir, but I'm only interested in spaceships. I talked to 33 guys. Not jack squat. Oh, dudes smoked out all their brain cells. Yeah, uh, Rufus? Uh, you do any artwork on vans back in the '70s? Yeah? Spaceships? - You're kidding. - I got to go run an errand. Hair appointment, right? You better quit now. Uh, yeah, Rufus? How long were you and Missy friends, Julie? Uh, just a few weeks before that night. She'd just moved into the building. Your idea to go to the rink that night, adult skate? I had a lot of bad ideas back then. I'm sure you remember 15. - Is that you? - My daughter, Tiffany- can't get enough of that retro fashion. Uniforms on, girls! We leave for practice in ten minutes! Run a pretty tight ship. Idle hands, right? If they're busy, - they can't get into trouble. - Do you remember any guys who showed interest in Missy that night? Lots of guys. She was a cute girl. Any drove a customized van, a spaceship painted on the side? Spaceship. No. Stoners weren't really my scene. Well, what was your scene, Julie? Anywhere I could get in. I knew how to handle myself. - But it was all still pretty fresh for Missy. - How'd you two - get separated that night? - Met a cute guy. Got distracted. I know her mother still blames me for what happened. Truth is, I was the kind of girl I try to keep my daughters away from. It's amazing. Totally different than daytime. Daytime's for kids. You want a man, not a boy, right? I'm... not really sure - about the whole datinghing. - Try it. You'll like it. I'm still getting used to my mom dating. You ever miss your dad? Not much to miss. Last time I saw him, we went to Wanamaker's to see Santa. I think I was four. There's a lot of talent here tonight. Now, if a guy grabs your hips during "Loco-Motion," that means he's into you. - Okay. - And if he asks what you do, just say, "Taking some classes. " It makes you sound older, ananit's sort of true. Smart! I know, right? And don't worry if you get nervous or run out of things to say. Just flip your hair. Guys think it's sexy. Like this? Perfect. * I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now * * Come on, baby * * Do the Loco-Motion * * My little baby sister can do it with ease * * It's easier than learning your ABCs * * So, come on, come on and do * * The Loco-Motion with me * * You've got to swing your hips now * * Come on * * Jump up * * Jump up * * Jump back * * Jump back... * Summer night, just out looking for fun. Turned out to be the worst night - of my life. - Who was the guy getting handsy - with Missy? - Rick, the DJ. He was, like, a local celebrity. We were friends. DJ's friends with 15-year-old girls? He would get us into the over-18, let us hang out in his booth. - He was harmless. - Rick's DJ booth. Shag carpet? It was the '70's. What else? Tragic what happened to that girl. - I heard she was some skater. - You remember letting her - into the adult skate, Rick? - Hey, the outfits those girls wore, they could go wherever they wanted. That why you decided to do the"Loco-Motion" with her? I was the DJ. I always came out and grabbed a body for that song. Never heard a lady complain. The way I heard it, you had your share of underage groupies doing time in your DJ booth. - They all looked 18 to me. - A player like you, I bet you had a sweet ride back then. Maybe a cool, customized van? No. I was an AMX man. It was a fast ride, and the seats fully reclined. What time did you leave the rink? I didn't; I stayed there all night with some friends, partying. These friends gonna back that up? Yeah, it may take a while, but I can probably track 'em down. How about you toss me your digits and I'll call you - with their info? - Well, how about you give me their names and leave the detective work to me? Sure you never gave Missy a spin in your booth? Come on. There were so many girls back then, I lost count. Oh, let me refresh your memory. You skated with her, and she wound up dead a few hours later. Whoa. I'm a lover, not a killer, baby. Yeah. Look, she was cute. I might have grabbed her. But this girl had someone else on her tail that night. What's your sign? Um, Pisces. You are one foxy little fish. What the hell, man? Watch your hands, man. You touch me again, and I'll rearrange your face, kid. Hey, what are you doing here? I called your house. Some guy said you'd be here. What are you wearing? Your face is all shiny. It's glitter makeup. Brings out my eyes. Look, Missy, you shouldn't be here. The guys are all pervy and old. Anyway, where have you been? You haven't come to Fast Skate in weeks. Julie's been teaching me some new tricks. - I can shoot the moon. - Shoot the moon? What about the Olympics, huh, or are you too cool for that now? Just... leave me alone, Hugh, would you? * 'Cause the music got you out on the floor * * We're gonna dance all night... * Sure, I could have taken the guy, but he seemed jacked on something. Did you see him with Missy later that night? No, but then again, I wasn't exactly keeping tabs on her. I don't need those reindeer games. - Of course not. You were king of the rink, huh? - You know it. We do a '70s night here on Saturdays. It's off the hook. You should come by. Give you the special VIP treatment. So I go down to Evidence to pick up Missy's nail clippings. Mr. Happy Meal behind the counter keeps stonewalling, finding reasons why I can't have them. I know that guy. Loves to talk. We go in circles for an hour. Finally, he admits the box holding them- get this- fourows back. Well, hey, that's gotta be ten, 12 feet. Oh, he's not going to waddle his fast food self all that way. Afraid the Hamburglar will grab him. Unbelievable. Finally went and got ??? We locate that other kid from the rink yet? Hugh Mastersen. Grew up in her old neighborhood. I can't decide whether this guy's creepy or just plain sad. Pulled up his MySpace page. Single male in his 40s, never married. Still looking for that "special connection. " Cross-check him with vehicle registration? I don't even think he had a learner's permit back in '78, but he did call the house that night asking for Missy; some guy answered, said she was at the rink. The mother aware of this? Got a call in to Simone. Going through old statements, boyfriends. If there's a man with a van, we'll find him. Any progress on those nail clippings? At the lab now, being tested for DNA. Will put a hurtin' on Mr. Happy Meal. TATTOO Hey. Get your nails done, killer? Shut up. So, where are you kids headed tonight Think I'm gonna cancel. The regular dating's hard enough. For a single mom, it's impossible. Yeah... why bother? Get yourself some sweatpants and park it on the couch. You make it sound so bad. Oh, you'll go toe-to-toe with some jacked-up gangbanger, but you're afraid of a little blind date your mom's met at church? Sorry about that. Cat told me to ink his girl's name across his back: Sheryl with an "S." Turns out she spells it with a "C". Well, talk spaceships, Rufus. Said on the phone you remember spraying one - on a van back in the day? - Yeah, cat was a big Boston fan Thought they were gonna be the next Stones. So much for his crystal-balling. I keep my old stuff in here for inspiration. You remember the guy's name? Just called him Boston. You got great skin. Make an excellent canvas. Yeah, here it is. Huh. Thanks, Rufus. We'll try to get this back to you. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. Yeah, Missy and I grew up on the same block. We were skate buddies since kindergarten. Oh, sounds like you two had a real connection. The Missy I knew was a tomboy. She used to talk about training for the Olympics. The guy who answered the phone at Missy's place told you she was at the rink? Did you recognize his voice? Figured it was her mom's boyfriend. Did it occur to you to mention that to the police in '78? Well, the papers said some creep picked her up in the park, but I take it you already know that. Saw your MySpace page, Hugh. Still looking for that special connection? Who isn't? Well, you seemed pretty particular to Missy - back in the day. - I told you we were friends. Going after her and the guy she's with isn't really friend behavior, is it? That DJ was a creep. No argument here, but you were angry with her. I wasn't mad at her. I was worried about her. Funny way of showing it. When Missy moved away, she just fell off the map. When I finally see her again, the way she looked... it just wasn't her. - Hey. - Hey. Um... look, I'm... I'm really sorry about before. I- I haven't heard from you since you moved. I was gonna call you, but... things have been kind of messed up. My mom works all the time. And she's got this slimy boyfriend. He's always around. This guy... did he do something? Missy, it's me. I mean, you can tell me anything. The other night... we were watching TV, and he... he touched my hair. It creeped me out. What are you going to do about it? Stay out of his way. So, what have you been doing all summer? Well, found this new place. You're gonna love it. We can go now if you want to, on my bike. Tear it up like we used to. I promised Julie I'd do the dance contest with her later. But I can come by your house tomorrow. We'll start training then. Okay. I waited on my front steps all day, but she just never showed. What'd you do after you left Missy? Rode my bike home; I had to get up at 5:00 in the morning for my paper route. Pretty much quit skating after that It just wasn't the same without Missy. Plates from the van came back registered to a Joe Bosquay. He got a sheet? That name, Bosquay... In '91, his 16-year-old stepdaughter charged him with sexual assault. The charges were dropped, but... Where there's smoke... And Joe Bosquay alibi'd out in '78. Jacuzzi salesman, dated the mother. Simone's boyfriend. Well, Simone backed him up, said he wasn't around. Yeah, well, we got 30 years of history since then not backing Joe up. Now, according to Hugh, the guy was putting the moves on Missy a few days - before she died. - Bring him in? The mother, too. Maybe she knows more than she's been letting on. Homicide. Stillman. Just a minute. It's Miller... and she's pretending to be someone else. She sounds drunk. Miller? You sure? She's asking for you, Scotty. Get in, lush. I would've called a cab, but I was late, left the house without my wallet. So, what's wrong with the guy? Nothing. Good-looking, manners, ordered a nice bottle of wine. I just drank half of it before the calamari came. Ah, you were nervous. It's a rookie mistake. I don't have the time or energy for the game. Bring on the sweatpants. You, you say good-bye to him, or just go to the bathroom, never come back? Oh, that's cold, man. You got to call him tomorrow. Make up some kind of work emergency. Hmm-mm, I'm not calling him. This was a one-shot deal. One and done. Aw, come on, Kat. You got to get back in the game. Got no game, baby. - Game over. - It's a shame. You're still a pretty good catch. - Yeah? - Just saying. You deserve more. Damn straight. Lousy-ass cop, though. Take me home before I puke all over your car. You got it. Joe Bosquay... That's a name I'd rather forget. But he was your boyfriend? Not for long. He was just the first guy to look at me after my husband left. Turns out I wasn't a very good judge of character. You didn't tell us he drove a van. Big spaceship on it. He didn't drive a van. He drove a convertible. You sure about that? He kept the top down all the time. I had to wear a scarf to keep my hair from blowing around. The van was registered to Joe's business. I've never seen it before. Why? Was Joe ever home when you weren't? No. Not that I know of. Did he have a key to your apartment? No. Ever keep an extra key outside your door, maybe for Missy? Oh, my God. You don't think... You ever been arrested, Joe? Nope. My record's clean. Only 'cause your stepdaughter Celeste didn't proceed with her case against you. Bitch was a liar. It was his van. And Joe picked up Missy at the rink. No, no, no, th-that's not possible. I- I would have known. We have an eyewitness, Simone. God, I brought that man into my house. DA said Celeste's mother pressured her to walk away. You had her convinced you were some kind of Prince Charming. So much for maternal instinct. Fibers found on Missy's body came back from the lab. American Blue shag. One of the options offered on the '76 Chevy Van 20. Perfect match for your model van. I never touched Missy. Missy ever try to talk to you about Joe? She... she... told me something once. A- a day or two before she died, but... But what, Simone? I thought it was about something else. Look! It's called "Shoot the moon. " That's terrific! Oh, you should come to the rink with me sometime. We'd have so much fun. Maybe Joe could come, too. He's a great dancer. I bet he's a great skater, too. Do you think Joe really loves you? The way you and Dad loved each other... before? Oh, honey. Your dad- he's not coming back. I know that. You've had a lot to adjust to this summer. You have been such a trooper. But you and me... we're a family. We don't need anyone else. Right? Nobody will ever replace your dad. But whoever it is I'm dating, you have to give him a chance. I know, and I did, but Joe's not the guy for you, Mom. You are too picky, honey. Maybe you're not picky enough. I just thought she missed her father. She was trying not to hurt your feelings. It's all my fault. That bastard! You were in the apartment that night. - You answered the phone. - So? Missy wanted a ride home. Which you never told her mother or the cops back then? The kid ended up dead that night. It would have looked bad. Because it was bad! You picked her up at the rink, took her to the park! No! She never went anywhere with me. * Got a surprise especially for you * Where's my mom? Where'd you get this van? She's still at work. I really need her right now. Yeah, well... you got me. * Waited so long, waited so long * Come on. I need your help inside. All right. Julie, wake up. I brought help. We're going to get you out of here. Do you have any idea how young these girls are? - This is not cool. - Look, man, I... This is not cool at all. I wouldn't want to be you if the cops get wind of this. If somebody gave them the wrong impression. Maybe this will keep you quiet? Julie can stay till she sleeps it off? And we'll all forget this ever happened. Forget what? Let's scram, Missy. We got places to go and people to see. - Aren't you going to do something? - Let's go. I'm not leaving Julie alone. I am not going anywhere with you. You're disgusting. You don't want to come, that's your deal, but, uh, I don't think your mom is gonna to be too thrilled at how you're spending your time. I guess now you and I have a secret. They were Rick's problem after that. I mean, I didn't need that kind of headache. Where did you go after you left the rink? I went to my friend Anita's. That, uh, lady loved her some nose candy. It made her real grateful. More grateful than Simone? Simone wasn't around. A man has needs. I'm torn, Joe. I can't decide if you're too old for me to feed you your teeth. Mrs. Gallavan. You were supplying drugs to minors. Trying to get over on underage girls. - I didn't... - You lied, Rick. You did see Missy again that night. Her friend Julie was high as a kite, thanks to you. So you made sure Missy stayed silent. Whoa! The last time I saw those girls, they were very much alive. She's freezing, Rick. She needs a doctor! Rick, what's going on? Your friend brought her old man. That's what's going on. I want you two brats out now! Don't even think about coming back. I didn't kill that girl. I just wanted her to take her friend and go home! You saying Missy left with Julie? Gave her that roller-skating jacket. She was cleaning up my mess. Guess I owe her a thanks. Sure you're done jerking us around, Rick? - Nothing else? - That's all I got. Talk to Julie. Good. We will. What the hell? You got six outstanding tickets for moving violations in Potter County. Tickets? Well, 1,400 bucks ain't no joke. Potter County PD's on their way downstate to pick you up. Long drive. Could take all night. See if we can find a nice big cellmate you can "do the Loco-Motion" with. Who's the foxy fish now? ??? for a while. - Should be about ready to talk now. - Mm-hmm. Tell her you'd be right there? Yup, about an hour ago. Nice. So, you call him? What are you now, my life coach? Apparently, I'm your driver. Never living that down. Call him. Why am I here? I told you everything I knew when you were at my house. Except the part about you going home with Missy that night. Who told you that? Your good buddy, Rick, the DJ. The cute guy you hooked up with that night. He didn't think you were so cute after you passed out on his couch, though. He gave me some pills. I barely remember that night. You remember how Missy got your sorry butt out of there. No, I blacked out. Yeah, that's bull. She had your back. Put her jacket on you, took you home. Same jacket you kept all these years. Let your daughter wear it. Why is that, Julie? Tiffany found it in the attic. I didn't know it was there. You kept it for a reason. Couldn't bring yourself to get rid of it. Something happened between you two, at the rink or on the way home. What was it, Julie? For all my talk, I was still a virgin when I went to the rink that night. When I got home, I realized I wasn't anymore. It was Rick? I remember messing around, and then things got fuzzy. Next thing I knew, Missy was there, and he was kicking us out. She came back for you, Julie. You owe it to her now to tell the truth. All she did was help me. And I was terrible to her. What happened, Julie? If I'd been a better friend, she would still be alive today. Do you still feel sick? Don't even talk to me. You're mad at me? I invited you into my world and you blew it. You've ruined everything! I was just trying to help... Well, you didn't. Rick was going to be my boyfriend, and now he'll never speak to me again. Were you guys... Duh. How else do you think I got into the over-18? It's not because I'm such a great skater. He's a jerk. You'll find somebody cooler. Someone our age. Boys our age are idiots. And older guys aren't? I had kind of a fight with my mom's boyfriend. Can I sleep over your house tonight? After what you did? I never want to speak to you again. But I don't have any place to go. That's your problem, not mine. That's the last time I saw her. That whistle... someone she knew? I didn't look back to see. I'll never forgive myself. All this time we've been looking for a guy in a van who took Missy to the park that night. Didn't think too much about a boy on a bike. It's tough when you're 15. All the girls move on to older guys. All of a sudden, you're just a squeaky-voiced little kid with a paper route. That what Missy thought of you? Missy wasn't like that. How come you never married, Hugh? Just never found the right girl? Or maybe you did. Only she just wasn't that into you. We were just friends. But you wanted it to be more. No, it wasn't like that. It's always that way with guys, Hugh. That's why you came back for her. You whistled to her, to let her know you were there. Just like you always did when you were kids. Only she wasn't interested anymore. And you'd come so far, put in all that time. Only Missy was a fighter. What? No, no, you got it all wrong. No, we don't. We got your skin under her fingernail clippings, Hugh. And your DNA on that can to prove it. It was all my fault. What was your fault, Hugh? I didn't... I didn't know what she wanted. See I didn't, I didn't realize... All she really needed was a friend. I just let it get all turned around. Oh, I can't believe you brought an extra pair. They're my old ones, but, uh, they're adjustable. Figured they'd come in handy someday. I'm out of practice, but I bet I can still take you. Yeah, we'll see. Missy! You okay? Yeah, I'm great. Never felt better. Well, if it wasn't for this bum wheel, I totally would have aced you. Oh, but my hair got caught on my lip gloss, slowed me down. Tomorrow I'll be dressed right... whole other race. Yeah, so you say. Oh... Tonight really sucked. But this... now... it kind of makes it all okay. What are you doing? - No, no, I-I just... - And I thought we were friends. I thought I could trust you. Well, no, no. You, you, you can trust me. I thought that... After everything that's happened today, I can't believe you! Missy, Missy, I'm sorry... Missy, please! Look, we can go back to the way things used to be, okay? Forget it ever happened, okay? - We can go back to the way things were! - Get off me! Missy, no! Missy... Missy... * You are here and warm * * But I could look away and you'd be gone * * 'Cause we live in a time * * When meaning falls in splinters from our lives * * And that's why I've traveled far * * 'Cause I come so together where you are * * Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted * ACCIDENTAL DEATH * Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you * ACCIDENTAL DEATH * Fourteen joys and a will to be merry * * All of the things that we say are very * CLOSED * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * All I need is you * * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * Ooh, sentimental lady * * Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted * * Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you * * Fourteen joys and a will to be merry * * All of the things that they say are very * * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * All I need is you * * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted * * Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you * * Fourteen joys and a will to be merry * * All of the things that they say are very * * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * All I need is you * * Sentimental gentle wind, blowing through my life again * * Sentimental lady, gentle one * * All I need is you * * Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted * * Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you * * Fourteen joys and a will to be merry... *
