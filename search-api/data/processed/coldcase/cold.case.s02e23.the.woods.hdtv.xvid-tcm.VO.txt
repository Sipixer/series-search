(http://club.nate.com/tsm) November 3, 1972 Turn that music down for god's sakes. I'm hungry. I need you to go to the store. Now. You mind me. I did a bad thing, mother. What did you do? I took out their eyes. Hey. Oh, morning. Scene's out back. Lil. I've been meaning to talk to you. About Chris. Yeah? What about? You were right. I fell for an act. You're not the first. But, uh, I should've listened to you. Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that it became between us. Detectives. What are you working with, Lenny? Third week in homicide, I get this mess. What's with the block party??? Some moron gets it in his head to buy this piece of crap, sends an inspector to check it out, digs up a bunch of skulls. - How many? - 9. CSU says some are recent, others have been there for years. Found them positioned like this. Bind up, facing upwards. Attic of the house, owner was killed up there in 1972, single gunshot to the chest. They find the doer? Robbery rape's all they got. Scottie, look at this. Black marbles in all their eyes. You wanna cool me in?(?) Serial killer we interviewed few months back. The black marbles like these were at his place. It's the freak who walked, right? Hunting down his victims. And made them run till they couldn't anymore. He decapitated 9 women. Never gave up where he put the heads. Looks like we might've found them. And who was the previous owner? Simone Marks, 32. Lived here with a 12-year-old son. Named George. Yeah, that's right. Looks like our serial killer's come back home.

Buried them in his childhood backyard, all facing the attic where his mom was murdered. And the deer eyes, he put them in their eye sockets. You know, maybe he wanted those dead women to see something. - Like... - Like.. his first kill. His own mother. Rape was never his M.O., Lil. Gotta be a reason he's lining up the heads like that. Scottie, we hear anything from Fugitives(?) yet on George's wherabouts? Sherman had a beat on him. Till three weeks ago. And George drops off the face of the earth. All right. What do we know about George's mother's murder? Robbery rape gone south. Signs of forced entry. Mom was found stripped, semen recovered at the scene. Any leads back in '72 on the doer? The weapon that killed Simone was a Colt .22 automatic, Woodsman series. - Never recovered. - What else? There's a set of prints off a jimmied window. No hits. Those doers had 33 years to make it into the system. Run them again. We think working this job will flush your boy out? Could, yeah. You know, George couldn't have killed his own mother. - Why not? - He wasn't in the house that night. DHS removed him hours earlier, put him in a group home at mom's request. His mother put him away? Told the authority she was afraid of her own son. Yeah, they took him out of here. Kid was a real wack job. Sat in front of the window there. Tiddling(?) with his flashlight. His mother said she was afraid of him. Why? Kid was a punk. Mom couldn't control him any more. So you ?? him up to the group home? Yeah. Let him loose with the other animals. This was his bedroom. Mom kept him locked up in here. What do you mean locked up? Dead bolts on the door. I don't think she let him out much. What else you're gonna do with a kid like that? He was a weirdo all right. But if you ask me, so was mom. I keep him in here so he won't run out at nights. Time to go, George. Upsy daisy. You heard your mom. You need me to go to the store, mother? Mind me. Are you sending me away because of what I did to their eyes? Stop talking, George. You did this. You're a bad, bad boy. But I did it to help you. You are the darkness. You always will be. Apple didn't fall far from the tree, if you know what I mean. What was with the light coming from that house? Got me. Looked like some kind of a signal. Hey, Nick, check this out. Where you at? Same kind of knife marks. Top and bottom of the stairs. What are they? - I got 13 down here. - How many have you got? 13. So what? 13 steps. You were George's neighbor back in '72? My bedroom was right there. Across from his. A haunted house. It's what we called it. Why? / Night after night, music would be blaring out of the attic. Real sappy songs, over and over. But you and George were friends? Wouldn't call it that. We just fooled around with our flashlights at night. Morse code. What kind of morse? Hi, Bye, SOS, dumb stuff like that. My folks would've killed me if they found out. No one wanted their playing with George. And you were doing this morse code thing the night George's mother was killed? George never coded me back. So I went over to see why. Shut-ins like her always have banks stashed under their mattresses. - Sure she's alone, man? - Yeah, sure. It was like she was looking right through me. Then what? Then the guys started in on her window with a crowbar. I ran back home. Thanks for coming out here, Elvin(?). You know, Jeffries said Simone had these knife marks on all her stairways, right? 13 marks and 13 steps. Yeah. And George said he made those marks to help her. Okay, so what? Simone looked past Elvin because she couldn't see him. George's mother was blind. That's why George's fixation with the victim's eyes.(?) His mother was blind. Knife marks in the wall were kind of crude(?) rail for her. And no one else knew about her blindness. She was a shut-in. Barely came in contact with the outside world. - Got a hit on those window prints. - Yeah? Jacob Leonardo. He's locked up in Allenwood Federal Pen. We're taking you ??. Road trip, great. This Leonardo doing time for burglary? Rape. Has a rap sheet as long as my arm. Kids, grandmas, all 51 flavors in between. Uses his belt to gag his victims. Real Romeo, this guy. Better be getting back some of that love in lockup. Wonder what kind of prison justice you'll get when they hear you raped and killed a blind lady. - What are talking about? - 1972 job. - I know nothing about it. - No? Cuz we lifted your prints from her window. Prints. So what? Maybe I worked at the house. Plus we got the rapist's semen. And we're taking hair and blood samples from you today. - Says who? - My warrant. And with a murder conviction, you're stuck in this crap hole for life. I didn't kill the girl, he did. - Who? - Guy who set it up. - What guy? - Some low life that I met at the track. We was on a losing streak and he says he knows a way to make off with some bitch's life savings. And you just followed along. Look, man. My thing is rape. Figured I cop a feel, some change.(???) I didn't do murder. - There's nothing here, man. - Be quiet or she'll hear you. - Damn. - Who's there? You idiot. What are you doing? She's blind like Stevie Wonder. This wasn't the plan. - Forget the plan. - No way. - I'm not gonna be a part of this. - Then leave. It's just me and you, Helen Keller. I know your voice. I know who you are. You're the one who took George away. You gotta kill her now. Might as well rape her first. I mean it. Get out. The belt, it was him, her. The gun, that was the last I saw. Jerk from DHS, gets the lay of the land earlier that night. Lee. / Point is it wasn't me who killed the girl. What kind of weapon did Lee have? Sweet piece. Colt automatic .22. Woodsman series. You owned the same kind of gun that killed Simone Marks, Lee. You buying that con's story? You're the worse kind of scum. Come into people's homes as the do good and social worker.(?) But on the side, you're casing the joint. Did something go wrong with your robbery that night? Later at Simone's. Like what? Like she knew you, your voice. So you had to kill her. I didn't. Swear it. No? Then what did you do in that house? We know it was just you and her. That's the thing. It wasn't just me and her. I ain't gonna hurt you. Understand, lady? What do you want with me? - No one's gotta know about this. - What are you gonna do? Dirty acts? - Isn't that why you're here? - Hey, I'm leaving, okay? To do dirty, filthy acts. Put your disgusting thing inside me. Keep your voice down. Making another monster, another one like him? It's darkness. It always comes back. Left my gun there. I tailed out. Are you sure you heard that music coming from the attic? You kidding? Scared the hell out of me. The darkness always comes back. She was talking about George. He was in the house. ?? security was next to nill. The kids run away all the time. So George could have to. So it's just him and mom in the house and the gun that killed her. All right. So he scares Lee away and then what? He shoots his own mother? Mom sent him away. Maybe he was looking to settle the score. Looked into the buyer of the house who ordered the inspection. Guy doesn't exist. Well, someone signed the escrow papers. Someone using an alias. Who wanted us to find those skulls. George. He set this whole thing in motion. Rush, phone for you. ?? Smith. That's the name. Of the buyer. Nick. Hi, George. My congratulations to Will. So invigorated when he left that escrow office. So you're in Philadelphia. I've been following your work these last few days. And I see you've followed mine. Well, we found your deer eyes. - Yeah. - Vicious little brute, that Bamby. Do you know what Scottish researchers have discovered about our friend, the deer? - Why don't you tell me? - On the mineral deficient island of Rum(?), deer attack young birds, ??, decapitate ?? their chicks, eat their heads. Imagine that. So you're the deer? I thought you were the hunter. I am both. Enough with the games, George. You wanna talk, talk. If not, I'm hanging up. Ask your question. Why did you go back to your mother's house that night? To kill her. But perhaps another beat me to it. What do you mean? I wasn't the only one who went back to that house. George. George. Why did you send me away, mother? You know why. I didn't make you blind, how could I? You are darkness. You did this to me. You know it. Get out of my house. No, no. No, no. - No. - Yeah. We'll have some fun now. Not in the woods. Not in the woods. Jacob came back, raped your mother. We see things even when it seems we don't. Like you. Hiding in the closet, watching. Better than porn. That. Why are you telling me this? To show me what a monster you are? Apt word choice. Monster. Now you tell me something. What? Do you keep a photo of my mother at your bedside like you do all your victims? How do you know that? I know you, Lilly. Everything about you. - You been in my house, George? - Not necessary to know that. Who else would be in your bedroom except dead people. George. Heard you went back that night, scumbag. - Got freaky with the blind girl. - I didn't go back. Yeah. Labs got your DNA, it's only a matter of time till they match to that semen. Labs mess up. Got a witness too. Her 12-year-old saw it all go down. Okay. Okay, what? I did a rape like I do. And I just wanted out. Whoa, kid. Take it easy. Hey, put down the gun. Not in the woods. What? How could you know that? About the woods. If you can't see, mother. Stop talking, George. No. Forgive me. George shot his mother? Point blank. Why? / Don't ask me, man. The kid was looney tunes. And you're saying she wasn't blind. Looking down the barrel of that gun, she wasn't. George's mother could see. We see things even when it seems we don't. That's what George meant. So we're saying she was faking blindness all along? She was crazy, maybe in her mind, it was true. So we know she was blind until that moment in the attic right before the rape. Not in the woods, she said. What woods was she talking about? We traced George's call. It was made from a pay phone. Where? Tinicum Wildlife Reserve. Where he dumped the bodies. Where it all started, in the woods. So what's his game? It smells like a set up. We're heading out. You stay here, Lil. What? You heard me. It's you he wants. Let's go. What do you want them to see? That's it. John. What is it? Head's missing. Multiple gunshots. He usually takes them out with one. Knife wounds too. That's new. His patterns are changing. He's bored. Or he's out of control. That's why the woods.(?) This is the woods. I told you long ago. We would go hunting together in the woods. You and I. What a shame. To hide the blood? But the past never quite goes away, does it, Lilly. No, it doesn't. Phone. Weapon, I meant. Now, the phone. And no Lilly tricks, hmm? Welcome to my past. An empty room with nothing but your mind splashed on the walls. Your mother faked her blindness. Is that why you killed her? Hysterical blindness is the term. One needs only to believe to become. But you didn't understand that then. You were just a lonely 12 year-old. In a lonely world. Loneliness is for the weak. And for those who desire love. Neither apply. Then why did you bring me here, George? To kill you. Why now? Oh, hunting has become a tedious game, since I met you, Lilly. Even Atlanta(?) lost her charm. The one who survived. What did you do to her? Didie Cooper. Oh, god, we met this girl. Interviewed her in these woods. Atlanta, the one that got away. - The first time? - You got Lil yet? She and her PPD. - I told her to stay there. - Well, she ain't there. And her cell keeps bumping me to voice mail. - Let's go to the house. - Why? Cuz that's where he takes the heads. Poor Didie. How she begged. In the woods. Like you will. Because in woods, you're a god, right? God's a sociopath. Free from all pretense of love and loyalty. - Like you. - And you. Disposing of those you ?? to care for like your dirty little sis. Sticky fingers on Lilly's hubby to be, real bitch in heat, that one. Don't even think that about her. You have. Your mother was stripped. Shot in the chest. But in the end, you would've found another reason to leave him. Just like Tina, Janet. All of them. You replicate her murder over and over. But why the running? Your mother didn't run. Your junior college degree equips you for pop psychology and a low level five figure income, not much else. Why do you make them run? Why? You were running, right? Why? Trying to find help? Stop him from hurting your mother? The granny panties, all in a bunch.(?) Who could resist that? Your turn now to tell me. - Tell you what? - Of little Lilly lamb. Long ago. Still ain't answering. It's her car. Detective Valens, how nice of you to come? What do you want with Lilly? I never sent my condolences, did I, about your pretty fiancee. Oh, the river can do terrible things to a girl's complexion. You hurt her, George, I'll murder you. A gentle reminder to mind your manners. Now, put your boss on the phone. George. Let's work this out. One courtesy call is purpose to disabuse you of storming the Alamo guns blazing. If you call again, if I see a cop within 100 yards of this house, I put a bullet in her head. No one's gotta die here, George. Too bad you couldn't save her. Save who? Your daughter. From the big bad wolf, his sharp wet teeth. Let me talk to Lilly, George. A real father would've eviscerated the thug who soiled his little girl. But you, you just talked. Now you listen to me. You won't get out of this alive without my help, George. I know all about your help, it comes 18 years too late. And true to form, you're too late for Lilly too. So... Where were we? Game's over. - It's only  a matter of time now. - You were telling me how you ran. - You're gonna die in here too. - Tell me how you ran. No. You've never told anyone what happened little Lilly long ago. But you want to tell. - Not you. - Well, I'm the only one left. So tell me. I was 10 on my way to the store. It was dark out, late. And that's when the bad man came for you. I ran. But he caught me. Did he touch you? In your secret place. He wanted my money. That's why he followed me. I gave him what I had. Then he went his merry way. You know he didn't. Tell me what he did. He hit me. - I don't remember much after that. - Cracked(?) your jaw. Five broken teeth. Pretty little face not so pretty when he got through with you. I fought, but he wouldn't stop. He just kept hitting and hitting me and laughing. I didn't wanna die. So I fought. We're alike, you and I. How so? You fought too. That's why you were bleeding. Jacob found you in the closet, - cornered you. - No. And you fought. Like me. No. Let go of me. No. And you ran. But the doors were locked. The windows nailed shut. He hunted you down in that house like an animal. - I'm not an animal. - That's why you pick fighters. How did he know you were in that closet, George? Do you want to know what I'm wondering? I'm wondering who would send a 10-year-old girl to the store late at night all alone. That's what I'm wondering. SWAT will have sharp shooters in position ten minutes tops. She doesn't have 10 minutes, Scottie. I'm going in. / But he was real clear about violating the perimeter. He's blind on the south side of the house. I can enter there. Yeah, then he puts a bullet in her head. Look, you do this, you'll kill her. He's gonna kill her anyway. Boss. I'm not losing her too, Scottie. Who sent you to the store, Lilly? I go there all the time. - The owner knew me. - Answer the question, Lilly. My mother. Why? She needed a drink. Sold out by the person who loved you most. No wonder little Lilly likes to play with the dead. Who sold you out, George? Because what I'm wondering is how did Jacob know you were hiding in that closet. You stop talking. Forgive me, your mother said. - For what? - Shut up. She told Jacob where to find you, didn't she? You shut up. Your mother wasn't raped in this attic. You shut up. You shut up. You shut up. You shut up. You were. Not in the woods. Not in the woods. Not in the woods. In the closet. In the closet. The boy, do it to him. Not me, do it to him. He brought you up here and raped you. And she just watched. I am god in these woods. No, George. You're a little boy. Whose mother didn't love him. Who sold him out. Like you. It's time you learned. Down on the ground, George. About freedom. On the ground. When you kill me, the only thing that separates you and I is who pulls the trigger. Don't make me do that. - I don't wanna kill you. - Yes, you do. That's why you came. We are alike, you and I. I'm nothing like you. You sleep with the dead. You're already half way there. And when you kill me, even those photos you cling to will fade away like everyone fades away for you. And you will be alone. Like me. You're wrong. I'll never be like you.
