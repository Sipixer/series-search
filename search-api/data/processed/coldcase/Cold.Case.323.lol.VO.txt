(http://club.nate.com/tsm) Black-and-white is, like, so beautiful. Can't believe I made my Joseph Shaw signature popcorn for these guys. And they're asleep! What? What's going on? Joseph, next time I'm picking the movie, man. I'm trying to broaden your mind, Corey, but that's fine, whatever. Bad enough you keep us sober. You make us watch black-and-white movies, too. All right, that's it, guys. Lights out. Come on, everybody up. Let's go. Up. I'm eating, like, so much sugar, I totally can't sleep, I bet. Read a book in your room. I'll walk you back, Crystal. Hey, you all, you made it. One more day clean and sober. Yeah! Yeah, way to go, man. Get sleep, man, okay? / All right. Take care. Come on. Corey! Orlando. Help! Somebody help! Orlando, it's all right, man, hang in, hang in there. Help! Hi. What's with your hand? None. Kind of looks broken. Uh, looks worse than it feels. You get in a fight or something? Nah. Got a call from east. Someone just tried to use the credit card of a murder victim from last year. Where? Check cashing place in Kensington, two days ago. Wallet was taken off the body? Who's the victim? Joseph Shaw. He died last year. He was a murder witness. Shot two weeks before he was supposed to ID the doer in court. Didn't pin his death on the guy he was gonna finger? No, they lost traction. Shaw's case went cold. Till today. When someone gets the bright idea of using a dead man's credit card. Hope whatever they bought was worth it. Cold Case 3x23.

Okay. It true you keep pictures of victims next to your bed, when you're working on a case? Where'd you hear that? People talk. Just seems a little freaky. Easy to look at all the files and boxes, forget the lives behind them. Joseph Shaw, 38. He was killed right before he was set to testify against Corey Lewis. Shotgun blast to the face, through the door. So suspect number one is Corey, who didn't want Joseph taking the stand? But Corey was in jail when Joseph was killed. Cops figured he must've reached out, gotten someone else to do it. Yeah, but the kid didn't seem to have much reach. Was a loner who lived at a rehab center called Robinson teen house. Place Joseph worked as a counselor. Know it from my narcotics days. Treats drug-addicted teens from all backgrounds. Has a great rep. Yeah, it was started by Jane and Ted Robinson, big Philly philanthropists. Neighbor who ID'ed the body told the cops Robinson house was Joseph's life. So maybe the Robinsons can tell us more about our victim. Let's find out what Corey knows about this credit card being used. Now here's a guy who wouldn't look so bad on a bedside table. We started this place after our son Tom died of a meth overdose. Being here has helped us as much as it's helped any of the kids, to tell you the truth. Did you know Joseph Shaw well? Sure, and the kids loved Joseph. Well, he sweated through rehab with them every step of the way. He struggled with heroin himself, growing up. He even did a few months in jail before he got clean. So he knew what the kids were going through. With a lot of social workers, the kids are just a file. But Joseph always said it was important to see the lives behind the file. And he did. Can you tell us about his relationship with, uh, Corey, the boy accused of murder? Corey was like our son Tom, in a lot of ways. He was tough, put up walls. But Joseph knew how to get through them, right from the start. Let me out of this damn prison! - The new guy's freaking out! - Chill out, bro! Corey, we know what you're going through. You don't know anything. You just met me yesterday, bitch! Let him slam. My son used to do this kind of thing all the time, end up in hospitals. You're a strong bastard, aren't you? - I'm getting out of here, man. - No, you're not. You know, when I was using, man, I was hollowed-out and weak. What the hell are you talking about? You're in here because you're an addict, man. You got a disease. - That's bull, man! - Denial. Been there, done that! What we do here Corey, is we try to help you kick addiction's ass. It takes some serious muscle. There's a dent in that door tells me you're strong enough to pull it off. Bet I could put a dent in that door. I'd rather see you get to group, Orlando. You put that strength in the right direction, you're gonna be a star here. We thought Corey was getting on track after that. Was there anyone Corey was close to, could have convinced to kill Joseph, - stop him from testifying? - No. The other kids just didn't seem to connect with Corey. Orlando and the witness to his murder are dead, and you're free as a bird. Things worked out pretty good for you, didn't they, Corey? Look, I don't have to talk about Orlando. Those charges were dropped. Fine. Let's talk about Joseph. I liked him. And I got an airtight alibi for the night he was killed. Oh, someone just used his credit cards. You got any ideas about that? No, but I'll tell you what I think. I think what sank Joseph is the same thing that always sinks a guy. Women. It's romantic of you, Corey. You know it's true. Come on, you've been sunk, too, right? Why don't you tell us what the hell you're talking about? I'm talking about how love makes people crazy. I couldn't keep my girlfriend, 'cause I was always lying, sneaking off to get a fix. She kept busting me. The drug's like our secret affair, right? The lies catch up with us, 'cause we ain't nearly as smart as we think we are. Jasmine was my dream girl, too. How so? I don't know. She was hot. What about you, Joseph? Who's your dream girl? I don't have a lot of time for relationships right now. I got my hands full with you punks. Oh, must be something that turns up your temperature. Guess it would be someone smart, as passionate about her work as I am, and not allergic to cats. How about you, Corey? Someone fine. You know, who dresses nice. Someone who gives a damn about me. See, that's an important step, Corey. 'Cause you're right, you deserve that, man. I mean, you all do. I get your subliminal message, Joseph. - What message? - Just because I'm allergic to cats, and I'm too young to be all passionate about some dumb job... Stop acting like a freak, Crystal. You should be with someone your own age, anyways. Joseph, we could seriously make it together. Don't just reject me. Crystal, I'm not rejecting you as a person, but there's no chance of... Stop! I can't even look at you! Your face is, like, haunting me, okay? Crystal... it might be best for you to have group with a different counselor. I can't survive like this. I'm gonna kill myself. Or I'm gonna kill you. As soon as I heard Joseph got shot in the face, I thought crazy Crystal. Crystal Eckersdorf? Detectives Jeffries and Miller, Philly PD. I'm out of jail and out of trouble's the sweet thing. So even though you're cops, I'm not nervous right now. We're about to kill that buzz, Crystal. Take us back to a year ago, back when you were in a bad way. You told Joseph Shaw you loved him and if you didn't kill yourself, you'd kill him. Oh, yeah. Now he's dead, shot right in the face you didn't want to look at anymore. Shot by me? No, you're wrong. That so? You know how... if a person is drowning, they'll, like, freak out and try to drown the person who's rescuing them? Sure. Joseph was the person who'd rescue you. Saying that put him in harm's way? - You gonna say by who? - Oh, but it's so sad. / Crystal. Joseph's foster brother. He stopped by one time and I was like, "oh, my god, Joseph's family is as bad as mine." Which is bad. Every guy who's ever liked me... dies including Orlando. - Wilder, what are you doing here? - Hey, bro. / Hi. Crystal, can you step out for a minute? No, no. I'll be real quick. Landlord's screwing me. Wants a deposit. I've given you my last dime. I'm gonna leave. I'm afraid I'm gonna forget who you are. I'm right here. I want to look at you and see you, all right? Not this. Look, I know she made you feel like you're nothing. But you're not. You're not, man. Joe wants to make everybody perfect, like him. No, thanks. See you. Stop! Get out! Wilder's mom, Joseph's foster mom... she would, like, not let them eat, but she'd, like, stuff her face. Nice way to grow up. They got into heroin as kids. Only Joseph kicked it. Some people just can't get sober. You make it look like a breeze. So Joseph tried the tough love approach with Wilder. Who was jonesing and probably not in control of himself. And Joseph was dead, like, two days later. Your Wilder Dautry's been rubbing elbows with the law since he was 14. Possession, possession, public urination...  lovely. But arrests drop off after May 2005. Yeah, when his foster brother, Joseph, turns up dead. - No trace of Wilder since then? - Nope. Got a last known address, Reba Dautry. Mother? And Joseph Shaw's foster mom. Kid at the park saw somebody beat the crap out of that pervert guy. Must've gotten what was coming to him. That courtesy of you? Me? Nah. I took in Joseph when he was 15. Nobody else wanted him. He and Wilder got thick as thieves. Turned against me. How so, Mrs. Dautry? Called DHS on me. Imagine that. Yeah, that right there. That's the look he'd give me. Wilder disappeared right around when Joseph died. You know why? Figured he took off 'cause he ran out of people in Philly to mooch off of. They were seen arguing. Always something with those two. What do you mean? Well...the last time I saw them, they were up a creek, looking to me to bail them out. Look, he needs your help. He's coming down and he's got no place to stay. You act like you're better than him. I read about that place you work. Kids stabbing each other. I was threatened today about that. I don't want Wilder near me, it's dangerous. Can't stay here. I got fosters in all the bedrooms. I want to get him out of the city to the farm. That old shack? Who even knows where the key is? Reba, look, I know we haven't been family to each other, but we need this, me and him. You two got enough out of me. Wilder? Joseph will take care of you, alright, pumpkin, hmm? - I want to go to my room. - We've got to go, brother. Come on,  we'll get you to my place, clean you up. You're the mother of the year, Reba. Thanks for everything. Sounds like the same award my mom was up for. So you sent Joseph packing? With a strung-out drug addict for company? Yep. What was the farm Joseph asked you about? Family place up Limekiln pike. Just a pile of boards and nails by now. Address, Reba. Might want to get that hand X-rayed, Scotty. Eh, it's nothing. Just, uh, jammed it in a pickup game. Heading out, Lil? I was, uh,  thinking I'd go out to the Dautrys' farm now. Go in the morning. Two of you. Okay, good night, boss. Good night. Archer? Laura? You're alive. Who the hell are you? I'm the police. I'd like some proof of that. Who was murdered in your apartment? My foster brother Wilder. - Did you kill him? - Of course not. Guy was a mess, but I loved him like hell. You let everyone think it was you. They thought they'd killed me. If I came forward, they'd try again. They? What are you doing out here at night, alone? Looking for Wilder. Trying to solve your murder. I guess I should be grateful. These are some odd hours. What are you, a workaholic, detective? Who was trying to kill you, Joseph? I spent the last year trying to find out. Get proof the police have to pay attention to. Tell me what you know, I can take it from there. No, you don't understand. These people have the resources, and the reach to stop you. That sounds a little paranoid. I wish it was. You have to trust me. I can help. What's your name? Lilly Rush. Detective Lilly Rush. Well, you must think I'm a wacko. This, this, this isn't as Ted Kaczynski as it looks. It's a... It's a good life out here. Quiet. I could see that. Does it feel like we've met before or something? No. Tell me what happened, Joseph. I was at Robinson house the day before Wilder was murdered. Joseph? I gotta talk to you. It's important. Could we talk in your office? So, yeah, I'll work on taking criticism better. Cool. Thanks, Joseph. Is everything okay? I haven't slept in two months, not since Orlando died. I know. Joseph, the kids who need love and support the most, we can't just throw them away. We don't throw anyone away, Jane. What about Corey? - Corey? - He needs us. We're his family, and you testifying just slams the door in his face. But Corey killed a boy. He needs to take responsibility for that. But Corey had to do it. Orlando was going to ruin everything, and bring down this place. Bring it down? What are you talking about? It's none of your business. Look, I don't know what's going on here, but I'm gonna testify, Jane, no matter what. You won't testify, and that's final. Next night, there was a hole in my door, and Wilder was dead. You think Jane was involved? I've been following Corey, see if I could find out more. That's dangerous, Joseph. And I tried to find Crystal, see what she knows, but she's disappeared. She just got out of jail. I can talk to her first thing tomorrow. Look, you can't tell anyone I'm alive. I have to bring you in. I'm not going anywhere. Trust me. Was that you? Used the credit card? Laura got chomped by a raccoon, and I had to rush her to the vet's in the city. The card was still in my wallet. I was so upset about the whole thing, I just wasn't thinng straight. I get it. Valens. Scotty, I'm at the Dautry farm, and there's nothing here. No point in you driving out. Wait, you went on your own? Yeah, I was up early, just thought I'd swing by, you know. Okay. And, listen, can you tell the boss I'm gonna take a sick day? Lil, what's going on? Nothing, I'm just, um... gonna take off sick. Will you tell him? Yeah. Yeah, all right. She on her way in? No. She's, uh... taking a sick day. She never takes off sick. Manager from the check cashing store called back. Has a security video we can look at from the night the card was used. Lil's sick. She's never sick. Ah, detective, good to see you. I'm so sorry, I'm afraid I'm rushing off to a board meeting this morning. Actually, I'm looking for your wife. Uh, she's out. Can I have her call you? Did you know she asked Joseph not to testify against Corey? - Where did you hear that? - Please answer the question. Someone misunderstood, I'm sure. Well, she was pretty clear about it. I believe the phrase was, "Do not testify against Corey." If she said anything like that, it was in the interest of protecting Robinson house and the residents there. What exactly was she protecting them from? I think you're getting in over your head here, detective. - Really? - Really. Crystal? I'm detective Rush. I'm pretty popular with you guys these days, huh? I need your help. You had something you wanted to tell Joseph the night before he got killed? Kinda weird you know about that. Help a starving musician, dudes? No. Later. That guitar's got no strings. Whatever. It's the music I care about. You cared about Joseph, too. And if you know something... maybe you could tell us who hurt him. But everyone who's ever said anything about it... is dead. With your help, we can put the murderer away for good. It was the night before Orlando got killed. You want to get a game of cards or something, before lights out? Lights out is like right now. I'm gonna go look for Joseph. You're making a fool out of yourself, you know that? - You're better than that. - Not really. Yeah, you are. Come on, Crys, come hang with me. Too much energy right now. Sorry. Cool. Whatever. Later. Corey... I love you. Jane and Corey, together? Totally, creepily, together. Next day, I told Orlando. And you think that's what got him killed? I know it did. He said he was gonna give Corey hell, maybe make some money off it. Next thing I know... Orlando's dead. You were right. I found out what was going on. / And? I need you to come in. First thing. Look, if Corey doesn't spill, I'm out in the open... He'll spill. I'll make him. Will you be there? Yeah, I will. I, I gotta go. Where the hell you been? I been trying to call you all day. Turned my phone off. You don't look sick. What's that? Security video from the check place. Something on here you should see. You know what's on here, don't you? I went to the farm last night. - He was there. - You lied to me? Something got into my head, I, I can't... - What the hell's going on with you? - Stop! I started having feelings... for this guy I... before I even knew he was alive. I've gone off the deep end, right? You got to talk to the boss, tell him what's going on. I know. I will, first thing. But it's not just the case. Scotty, it's... him. Joseph. Okay. Sounds crazy, huh? I get the messed-up-affections thing, believe me. Crap. I screwed up. So... you all right here? Thanks, Scotty. Now how's that feeling? It's killing me. Corey's sweating in a cell. Where's Joseph? He's coming. Rush. So? You went out to the farm alone. Yes. And lied to Scotty, and then went AWOL all day. I'm sorry. But Joseph would've ditched out if I told you... You don't cover for a guy dodging the law! That's not how to be a cop, and it's certainly not how to be a homicide detective. - I know. - And where is he now? He's... I don't know. - I don't understand what you did here. - I don't, either. You should leave my office. And, and what? What's gonna happen? I don't know. I don't know that this can be fixed. I don't think you get it, Corey. It's the end of the line for you. Joseph's alive. And he's gonna testify you killed Orlando. Joseph raised from the dead? Where is he? Well, can I see him? You killed Orlando 'cause he knew what was going on with you and Jane. You all are crazy. I'll say it again, I didn't kill Orlando. You did, Corey. I saw you. You're supposed to be dead, man! - She told me. - Who? Corey, baby, what happened? - You didn't do it, did you? - I did it for you. What? Orlando knew about us, but I got rid of him before he could tell anybody. Jane, I protected you. Because I love you. Don't tell me that you don't feel like that, Jane, please. I just... I just wanted to comfort you, to, to hold you. I'm... I'm sorry. I bet you wouldn't want people talking about how you touch the boys at Robinson house. - What? - Look... I'm not saying it was like that with us, Jane, but that's how people are gonna talk. Don't say that about me. Joseph saw me do it. So you got to shut him up. Please. Jane Robinson promised she'd get rid of Joseph? But she lied. I thought she loved me. Well, she tried to kill him, man. That make you feel better? She still sends me things. Sends me lots of things. We got this. So, um... You know, this is weird. I just feel... Yeah, me, too. From the moment I saw you in my house, holding a gun on me. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's, um... - New? So where will you go? Oh. Farm for a while. Should I... keep the door open, in case you want to... track me down? Keep it locked. All right. Okay. I can break in if I need to. My client has dedicated her life to Robinson house. She has helped countless teenagers kick addiction. And took liberties with at least one of them. This is outrageous. They can't say that to her. You promised Corey you'd kill Joseph. You seriously take the word of a deluded youth over my client's? What are these? What are they doing? Your letters to Corey. He saved them all. "Dear sweet boy, your letters cannot come soon enough." This one's from last week. No. "Dear Corey, the leaves are falling from the trees," "and I know your birthday is coming." "The first day of Fall." Writing concerned letters is not a crime. She promised. She promised what? It's Tom's birthday she's talking about. The first day of Fall. Is your wife having problems? She's been depressed... since our son died. This is why you killed Joseph Shaw? So you and Corey could keep your little romance going? We couldn't just slam the door in his face. So you shot Joseph. It's hard to picture your wife hurting anyone. She wouldn't, she can't. Tell us, Jane! All I ever wanted was to help him. Jane, stop! Make them stop! It wasn't her, was it? who took care of Joseph? We survived the worst thing parents can live through. We were almost whole again, and then that kid... she's all I have left, lieutenant. I would do anything for her. How could you do this? You could go to jail. He's 17! - I want to save him. - You can't. This stops here. This kid is not our son. What about Joseph? He'll tell. I'll take care of that. But you have got to pull it together. Starting tomorrow, no more of this. No more Corey. Okay. No more sleeping all day, and no more of this sadness. We can be happy. 'Cause that's what Tom would want. I just miss him, Teddy. I do. ¢Ü Howie Day's "Collide" ¢Ü the dawn is breaking ¢Ü ¢Ü a light shining through ¢Ü ¢Ü you're barely waking ¢Ü ¢Ü and I'm tangled up in you ¢Ü ¢Ü yeah ¢Ü ¢Ü I'm open, you're closed ¢Ü ¢Ü where I follow you'll go ¢Ü ¢Ü I worry I won't see your face ¢Ü ¢Ü light up again ¢Ü ¢Ü even the best fall down sometimes ¢Ü ¢Ü even the wrong words seem to rhyme ¢Ü ¢Ü out of the doubt that fills my mind ¢Ü ¢Ü I somehow find ¢Ü ¢Ü you and I collide ¢Ü ¢Ü I'm quiet, you know ¢Ü ¢Ü you make a first impression ¢Ü ¢Ü I've found I'm scared to know ¢Ü ¢Ü I'm always on your mind ¢Ü ¢Ü even the best fall down sometimes ¢Ü ¢Ü even the stars refuse to shine ¢Ü ¢Ü out of the back, you fall in time ¢Ü ¢Ü I somehow find ¢Ü ¢Ü you and I collide ¢Ü ¢Ü don't stop here ¢Ü ¢Ü I lost my place ¢Ü ¢Ü I'm close behind ¢Ü ¢Ü even the best fall down sometimes ¢Ü ¢Ü even the wrong words seem to rhyme ¢Ü ¢Ü out of the doubt that fills your mind ¢Ü ¢Ü you finally find ¢Ü ¢Ü you and I collide ¢Ü ¢Ü finally find ¢Ü
