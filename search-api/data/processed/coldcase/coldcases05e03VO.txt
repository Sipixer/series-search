party time, yo! They're here! You don't have to go, Anna. Not every Amish person leaves for rumspringa. Mom. That's why you never got to see the ocean like you always wanted. Today's my birthday. I'm-I'm-I'm 16. I didn't forget. It's soil from the garden, so you won't forget where home is. I couldn't find any sand. Don't worry, Mom. I'm going to see the real ocean. I love you. And I love you. Get in, get in. Put this in-- it's great. Write to me every day. Tell me what it's like out there. Every single day. I promise. Whoo! Let's do it. How fast can you get us to the train station? The train station? We're going to Philadelphia, Rachel. Philadelphia? That's a city-- a big city. The bigger the better. Anna. City kicked in for some new windows. Only took them five months. Nice not having that constant reminder. Heard IAD came by last week and talked to Scotty. Yeah, he talk to you anything about it? - No. - You're detectives. Right? And you are? Sarah Gunden. My sister Anna disappeared a year ago. We deal in homicides, not missing persons. She wrote to me every day, just like she promised, and then her letters just stopped. And what was your sister doing in Philly? She came here on rumspringa. Mine started today. Rumspringa. That that Amish-kids-gone-wild thing? The day we turn 16, all rules stop. We're allowed to go into the world, do English things, till we decide to go back. Maybe your sister liked our ways better. Anna wouldn't have just disappeared without telling me. I just know. Something happened to her. Last one's dated August 20, 2006. It's a Kensington postmark. Ain't exactly the tea-and-crumpets part of town. You know who she was staying with? A friend. She didn't use names. Anna ever have any broken bones? Dental work? Something to identify her? She's missing a tooth in the back. The way our dentist fixes cavities. Is there a number we can reach you? Verkler's? It's a farm supply store down the road from my home. They'll find me. How? Smoke signals? You're not staying in Philly? The only reason I care about rumspringa is to find out what happened to my sister. Amish kid in Philadelphia. A babe in the woods. Should've stayed where she belonged. -==http://www.ragbear.com==- COLD CASE 503</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- SYNC:°¢±ÈÃ´¸ø</font> Talked to IAD. Guy's a real son of a bitch. No kidding. Yeah, and he knew about the Burrell job, what went down, and for the life of me, I can't figure out how he found out about that. I don't know either. A lot of smoke and mirrors, these investigations. Sure about that, boss? You want to rephrase that, Scotty? Is that in my file? Vigilante dad tried to kill Burrell based on info you gave him. You think no one was going to figure that out? Are you saying everyone knows? Your own fault, Scotty. You screwed up. No shortage of Jane Does in the City of Brotherly Love. What happens when you got 406 homicides in a calendar year. Here's something. 16-to-18-year-old female, missing molar. DOD between August 10 and September 10, 2006. Postmark date of Anna's last letter fits. City demolition crew found her body in the basement of an abandoned apartment building in Kensington. Emerald Street. Surface abrasions on her heels, carpet fibers. Well, she was dragged there. I'll check real estate files for owners. Cause of death's a five-inch serrated knife. Ouch. No signs of sexual trauma. No drugs or alcohol in her system. And no suspects. Case went cold almost from day one. What's an Amish girl doing in an abandoned apartment building in Kensington? Dressed like this. That don't look so Amish to me. Maybe she runs out of money, turns to the streets? Gets killed by a john? Roller coaster rumspringa. We get anything from those letters she wrote? Nah, just the typical teenage angst. Kid that age-- ain't easy survivin' a brand-new culture. And you would know? My dad-- he came here from Cuba when he was 15. This type of thing changes a person. We, uh, Photoshop her picture with Amish clothes, recirculate it, maybe get lucky. Well, who's going to Lancaster, see if the family can make an ID? I hear the Amish don't like outsiders too much. Not into chasing some horse and buggies? Hell, no. No, don't look at me. So, who's going? What the hell these people do all day? No TV, phone. Place is like a Colonial day reenactment. Quit gawking. And they're looking at us like we're the weirdoes. May I help you? Philly PD, Mrs. Gunden. We're here about your daughter. You found Anna? You brought these outsiders here? Where is my sister? We have a photo we'd like you to look at. For identification purposes. Identification purposes? A Jane Doe. A girl without a name? We think it might be her. We'd like to ask a few questions about the day she left. No. Ma'am? Whatever happened to my daughter... it was God's will. It's not our place to interfere. It's the Amish way. Well, it's our job to get to the truth of what happened. We need your help. She left with Rachel Wagler, her best friend. She lives down the road. I'd like to see my daughter. We'll make arrangements to get her back to you as soon as possible. My baby has to come home. Philly PD. Is this Rachel Wagler's home? Yes. She's inside. Thanks. You can wait here... sir. Rachel? I'm Detective Rush. Philly Homicide. Homicide? I don't understand. I'm here about Anna Gunden. Her family just identified her body. Is there some way I can help you? Understand the two of you went to the city together. I barely even remember that. Must have been some reason the two of you split up. I... wanted to come home. She didn't. Why? Mighty quiet around here. Might want to give me a hand. Hmm. You must miss her a lot. It's a real tragedy. She's better off in the afterlife. I was talking about you. Not having your best friend around. And she never even got to meet your baby. Of course I miss her. So help me find the person who killed her. I hated it out there. The cars, the noise... And the people-- one minute they're happy, the next they're mad. You never knew what was going to happen next. Anna didn't mind? No way. She loved chaos. Blasting music. No rules. What happened when you went to the city? Anna was in heaven. But for me.. it might as well have been another planet. Jakob! Anna! Oh! * Suddenly I see * Anna. Amish in the house! What's up, homegirl? What's up? We made it. Gots any news from the homestead? My parents still lame as always? I haven't seen them since I called you from Verkler's. Yeah, no worries. So, ready to par-tay or what? Definitely! What about the beach? Shh. Relax, female-lady-girl. Every damn Amish kid wanting to see the ocean. First we gots a scene to check. - All right? Come on. - Okay. Did you hear that? A party. But aren't you scared? Nothing's the same as home. No one's telling us what to do either. "Keep your voices down, girls." "Don't be so proud, girls." It's hard to figure out who you are when you're just following rules. You promise to stay close? Yes. And if you get scared, just remember: life is not a dress rehearsal. I wish I could take it all back. Say I never cracked a beer, tried other things. This Jakob character-- he Anna's connection to the city? He left during rumspringa, decided not to be Amish anymore. He loved the English world, couldn't understand why anyone would want to come back. And you girls were staying with him? At his apartment. Recall where that was? Frankford Avenue. In Kensington? He said that was his "hood." Why? You ready to go? Yeah, let's get outta here. Had me fooled, homeboy. ??? pegge you for Amish. Amish? I said good-bye to those backward folks forever. So you're English to the core now? Word. Got me a PlayStation, 250 channels of satellite TV and a fridge full of 40s. Yeah? That your bait, luring Amish girls out to their death? I didn't kill Anna. I was helpi' her out. She wanted in, I took her to all the dope places. This relationship sexual? Man, she was Amish! You think I mess around with farm-raised tail? You talk that way around your mother? I'm just sayin', maybe I could've eased her into the scene gentle. You know, given her a chance to accumulate. Anna... get herself into trouble her first night out? Nah, that was my bad. Girl had no business being in that punk's crib, and I shoulda knew it... Rachel still won't wake up. Word! One adult beverage, that whale's beached. I promised I'd look out for her. I don't even know how long she's been passed out up there. It ain't your fault female-lady-girl slams her booze. Now, you ready to party or what? The hell's Vince coming over for? Who's that? You don't want to know. He's crazy. Hope it's cool, uh, I heard about your party. Name's Jakob. Damaged freak. I'll be back. Yo! The hell you doing? Living. Girl had some kinda death wish. I should've looked out for her better. Well, what about that knife? Big-ass thing, you know, with them nasty jags on the side. Freak always had it on him. Is that right? Word on the street is that he did some time in juvie for stabbing a kid to death. This isn't Thing Right Therapy. Talking. I gotta put in my hours. Standard protocol. Right. Your daughter? Yes. Her name is Jessica. If you just wanna fill the paper work? Say I was here? Okay. Lilly? There's a reason it's required to talk to someone after a shooting. Sure. Traumatic event like that, yeah. Are you having any trouble sleeping? Nightmares? No. Okay. See you next week. Looks like him right here. Yeah. Vince Patrielli? Who's asking? Philly PD. So, Vince... Want to try it again, dumbass? - I didn't do nothing! - So why you running? Felt like a workout. Checked your juvie records. Ain't nothing about you knifing a guy. Bunch o' bull to make you seem like a badass. You off Anna Gunden to prove you were some kind of man? She's dead? Aw, nice touch. Hustler like you acting like you give a crap on the Amish girl. It ain't like you think it was. Then clue us in, 'cause the meter's running. She may have looked Amish, but she sure didn't act it. I have a spot like this, too. I have six brothers and sisters. Louder than tornadoes. I bet it's even better up on the roof. Ain't gettin!up there in that muumuu. So fix it. Make me look English, not Amish. My clothes, they're... Stupid? Fix them. With this... How do you know I won't do more? Like cut you? Because you believe in God. Yeah, right. If God exists, he was taking work off the day I was born. Your parents don't live here, do they? What's your problem? I just meant you're alone, aren't you? Maybe. So, why do you have a spot like this? Guess I just don't like people much. Maybe I was waiting for you. Turn. I look... Sick. You can't tell I'm Amish? No way. Well, maybe a little. We partied together 24/7, maybe two, three weeks. Then she split. No good-bye, nothing. That's a nice story, Vince. Your summer of love. Those Amish kids-- they always go back, right? I thought that's what happened. Where'd this knife of yours go? Someone stole it. Around the time Anna took off. Didn't seem like an odd coincidence? Not till you tell me she's dead. Can I go now? Nah. I think I'll hang onto you for a while. Valens. Right. Pharmacist in Kensington ID'd Anna's photo. She came into the store about a year ago, but she wasn't the one sporting the Amish-wear. She was with a friend? Yeah, kind of mousy girl. Brown hair, maybe five foot, three. Sounds like Rachel Wagler. Mm. Anna was the one wearing normal clothes? I don't know if you'd call them normal. The dress was all ripped up, kind of dirty looking. But you know kids these days. You have a pretty good memory. I remember all my shoplifters. This color's sick. Don't you think? Sick? You should hear yourself. What's wrong? Are you mad at me or something? I want to go home. We're just starting to have fun. You mean you and Vince. Well, I think I'm, you know... What, in love? Why are you acting like this? God. Why did I listen to you? About coming here? We didn't want any more rules. You didn't want rules. I like rules. I like being Amish. It's not my fault nothin's good enough for you. All right, young lady. I didn't do anything. I was talking to her. I knew you wouldn't pay for that. A pregnancy test? But... who was it? If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. I swear, Anna, I'll kill you. Wouldn't usually expect the dowdy one to have the sticky fingers, but... You press charges? Girl in a predicament like that, Amish and all-- I figured she had enough problems. And her problem's just going a whole lot worse. So, if Rachel's pregnant in August '06... What's term, 40 weeks? Don't look at me. Well, maybe this son of hers ain't so Amish after all. If you want to split hairs, her kid won't decide if he's Amish till after rumspringa. Thanks. Been needing one of these. Yeah, I heard about shop class, Nick. You going native on us? You should take a trip out there. No, thanks. You ever notice when the power goes out all the buzzing stops? Streetlights, refrigerators, stuff you didn't even know makes noise? That's what it's like. Pure silence. He is goin' native. So, Rachel gets back to the farm pronto. Passes the kid off as her new husband's. Mose. And no one's the wiser unless Anna threatens to tell. Now that's a secret worth killing for. We're a happy family. Why can't you just leave us alone? If you'd been straight with me the first time, I wouldn't be here. I answered your questions. Forgot the part where you got pregnant on rumspringa? - I didn't mean to lie. - Course not. I didn't want to talk about the worst night in my life. Night you killed Anna to keep her quiet? "Tell anyone, and I'll kill you." Your words. I was scared. She wouldn't have told anyone. You've got motive, no alibi. We were like blood. We came from the same place. It was the English who were heartless. I can't believe we're going to see the ocean. And the ocean's going to see you. Come on, let's just go. - Go ahead, I'll catch up. - Are you sure? Just go. My God. It's so beautiful. Anna? I'm sorry what I said to you. I was scared. Did you take the test? I don't know what I'm going to do. Have you ever seen water so big? Just the pond behind the schoolhouse. Do you think there's another world out there? Something better than this one? I don't know. I... I doubt it. Rachel, if you tell me who it is, maybe I can help. What's up, homegirls? Don't even say Jakob doesn't deliver, bitches! Look at this scene! You're wasted. u're <i>always</i> wasted. I want to be English forever! Being Amish sucks! Amish say they helpin', but they ain't. Livin' in the 1600s,ll pious and crap. Can't tell me what to do no more. Wait. You and Jakob? No. Then who? Vince. What? It was Vince. But... how could you do that? I didn't do anything. He did. I was drunk. You promised to stay close, but you didn't. And all I can see is his face on top of me. The night we got to Philly? He's not the person you think he is, Anna. None of them are. Anna thought that monster was her knight in shining armor. And the baby? I asked Anna to come home with me... But she said she wasn't going to let them get away with it. Will you testify against him? My husband loves my boy like his own. Please, don't make me. How did I know I'd be talkin' to you again, bitch? Don't know. Woman's intuition? Enough! Scotty. Wasn't all hunky-dory with you and Anna like you said. Unless raping her best friend is part of ??? ritual? You got a son out there. Boy doesn't know who you are. Cry me a river. Kid's living on some sunny-day farm. You're going away for this. You saying that Amish loser is going to hop on her horse and buggy and testify? She already agreed to it. Said she's been living for the day she takes you down. It's a dog-eat-dog world. I just bit first this time. We're talking about more than rape charges here, Vince. Try murder one. I told you... I didn't kill Anna. She knew what you did to Rachel. She called you out, didn't she? Girl like that-- she wasn't afraid of anything. Not even you. For a while, I... thought it could have been different. You know... if I met her sooner. Before you raped her best friend. Bottom line is, Anna wanted to go home. What's with the silent treatment all the way from the shore? Anna, come on. What's with you? I thought I knew you. I thought you were special. You do know me. She told me, all right? I don't know what you're talking about. Rachel. I know what you did to her. It was just a joke, 'cause she was lame and all. Somebody dared me. It was dumb. I-I didn't even know you yet. I can't believe how stupid I was. Believing in you and me, and-and thinking it was fate. - Anna, come on... - Don't! Just don't! Grow up, Amish bitch. This is the real world. Everyone was right about you. You are a damaged freak. Yeah, but you're the pathetic whore who came begging for it! You're hurting me! Anna? Mom? So, Anna's mother was there? She forgot to tell us about this field trip. Next thing you know, Anna's dead. wouldn't be the first christian to kill. Isn't losing my daughter punishment enough? Not if you killed her. Lying to us about being in Philly makes us think you did. And if I told you, would that have brought Anna back? Your daughter was trying to figure out a lot of things while on rumspringa. To be or not to be Amish. Tough question to answer at that age. But it looks like she was starting to figure it out. "I see Mom practically locked in the kitchen, raising seven children, and I don't know if that's what I want from my life." You were losing her. You couldn't let that happen. The example she'd be setting for Sarah, your other daughters... Something Anna used to say: "Life is not..." "...a dress rehearsal." I saw that on a... bumper sticker. I knew Anna would appreciate it. She was... everything I wanted to be but couldn't. She was fearless. Strong. Anna's death... was my fault. I should have let her come home. Why did you come here? I heard Rachel came back, so I went to see her. And then I was worried about you. Why? A woman doesn't have seven babies without knowing what a pregnant girl looks like, Anna. I thought there was something for me here. But I was wrong. I'm coming home with you. Mrs. Gunden? Jakob. Do my parents know that you're here? Did they send you? I thought maybe they were worried or something. My mom, maybe? Mom? He's talking to you. Jakob Beachy is in bann. We are forbidden to talk to him. Good-bye, Mrs. Gunden. Tell my folks I miss them, okay? This is for you. It's real sand. You saw the ocean? I know you think there's some big world beyond it or whatever, but it was just pretty. That's all it was. Are you sure? Did you really look? I don't want you to come home out of fear, Anna. I've seen people give up. But never you. Why are you saying these things? It's like you want me to stay. I never had the chance. But there is another world out there. A world much bigger than... than this one. You just have to really look. All this time, I thought she'd found something better. But I was wrong. You said Jakob Beachy was banned? Excommunicated. But still, he'd come back late at nights, on drugs, begging to be let back. And so the church gave him an ultimatum. Which was what? ??? or never come back again. So Jakob gets hooked. Has no idea what to do about it. What happens when you send your 18th century kid into a 21st century world? Do you want to take a ride? Where we going? Chase some horse and buggies. Fools got me on LoJack? Ain't hard to find someone in your shoes. Easiest place to score in Kensington. You're a far cry from home, huh, Jake? My family's from Cuba. You know where that is? Yeah, I guess. Guy named Castro takes over, 1959. Throws anyone who objects in jail or worse. My family's one of the lucky ones. But no matter how long they've been in this country, it still ain't... home. You spend New Year's Eve with any Cuban, you hear them give the toast: "El año que viene en Cuba." "Next year in Cuba." But 1959? You do the math. Been waiting a long time. You tell me your life story, I'll tell you mine? I'm thinking they're one in the same. I mean you lost your home, your family, everything you've ever known. I know what that does to a person. How it makes them feel inside. Lost. So you pretended to love the English world, but deep down you were scared. I just want to go home so bad. They want you to come home, Jakob-- your parents. They do? I just talked to them. They miss you, too. Yeah, just like Anna's parents miss her. I didn't mean to hurt her. She had a chance to get out of this place. And hear the quiet again. But she didn't even care. Jakob? What's wrong? Where's your mother? - She went home. - How come you get to go home and I don't? Why don't they love me, too? I'm not going home. Stop lying. I changed my mind. I'm going to do rumspringa the way we're supposed to. I don't care. I just want to go home. You can. You've just got to quit partying. I don't know how! I'm going to go back with you. You're going to tell my folks I'm better. You're going to tell them that I stopped doing bad things. They'll believe you. - I'm not going back. - You have to! - It's the only way! - No, Ja... Stop! Jakob, I'm going. Get out of my way. (stammers)Co Stand up! We're going to go home. We're going to go home. We're going to go home. No, no... We're going to go home. We're going to go home. We're going to go home.
