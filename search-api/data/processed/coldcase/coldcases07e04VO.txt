Brothers and sisters, look at the person sitting next to you. Chances are, they have a loved one fighting in Southeast Asia. Our boys are doing everything to keep their souls intact over there. So ask yourself : what are you doing over here? When you look in the mirror, does the reflection seek material gain from the world ? Billy. I wasn't finished. Sorry, Dad. Sorry. He ain't bad. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world... ... and lose his soul ? So, Archie, you said your pop was William Sanders, right ? William Jeremiah Sanders. What it says on my birth certificate. And my mom Beatrice passed away six months ago. Just always told me he was a drunken bum. So, why the sudden interest ? My kid came home the other day {\a6}<i>My family tree</i> and asked me to help him with this. Reminded me of when I had the same project back in school. Now my son's asking about my dad. And you couldn't tell him anything. Just want to maybe find out something about him. You know, fill in the blanks. So your mom told you he was murdered ? No, no. Old "Philly Tribune" had a blurb about a Billy Sanders killed in 1970, eight months before I was born. Tracked this down from the Ident Unit. Looks like you. Mug shot, huh ? Guess Ma was right. What was he arrested for ? Disorderly conduct outside a bar. Just the one time. Could happen to anybody. Paper said he was killed down on Wharton Street, 1500 block. Any idea what he was doing down there ? See the calluses ? Perfectly manicured nails. - Your pop a musician ? - Don't know. Your mother ever mention anyone else, Dad's side of the family ? Nothing. That's why I'm here, Detective. When you find anything... Sure. Um... We'll let you know. Well, the dad was a reverend. Billy played the organ at his church. Only people interviewed were, uh, friends, family from the congregation. What's a church boy doing hanging down on Wharton Street Friday night ? Think I know. Ain't seen one of these for 30 years. You got to get out more, Will. Check out the bee in the middle. VIP pass to The Hive. After-hours jazz spot back in the day, just a block from where Billy was killed. He would have been a regular. Were you a card carrying member, too ? I wish. You had a Jack of Clubs, you weren't some drunken bum, like Mom said. He was ???? one of the best musician in town. Cold Case Season 7 Episode 4 Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com Soul Let you out of your cave, boss ? Anything to get out of these COMPSTAT reports. What you got ? Jazz musician, 20 years old. Blunt-force trauma. No wallet on the body. ID'd from a disorderly conduct pinch in '70. Wharton section of South Philly. Heavy streetwalker traffic. Well, assigned thought it could have been the old flimflam. A trick gets lured in. Pimp cracks his skull, takes his cash. Murder weapon looks like a bottle. Found dark glass shattered near the victim. M.E. assessed it matched the wound to his skull. There's a state liquor store a block over from where he was killed. So was The Hive, an underground club where Billy played. Will was the after-hours guru back in the day. Could only go a couple times before I got drafted. Ran every Friday, same night Billy was killed. I heard of this place. It was in the basement of some house, right ? Yeah. Joint was hot, smelly, crowded. But the music... Man. What I would have given to have a Jack of Clubs. Long shot, but let's check out the bottle, see if we can track where it might have come from. - What about next of kin ? - Reverend Thomas Sanders. Never mentioned his son played the clubs back in the day. You remember any of the musicians from that place, Will ? Not by name. Owner was a tough broad, the Queen Bee. She'd sit at the end of the bar, smoke like a chimney. Maybe she's still buzzing around, can tell us if Billy was there night he died. Talk to Dad, too. See if any of this new info sparks a memory. Got a kid here, wants to see Detective Rush. I'm her partner. I'll talk to him. He asked for Detective Rush. Scotty. Ooh. Something I ate. The chili fries ? Good, though. Valens. Hey, Ma. Uh, just... No reason. Just checking in. What, I can't check on my mom ? Yeah, fine. Okay, yeah. Talk later. Bye. Ran the title. Real estate files show the Queen Bee was Geraldine Watkins back in '70. Still around ? Yeah. Runs a soul food joint out of the same address today. Somebody here to see me ? Oh, yeah. He's right over... We played music for the Lord. Billy played an organ the angels envied. Is that Billy's brother ? Tom Jr. was going to be a preacher in the Sanders tradition. My eldest was taken by the jungle, my youngest, by the streets. Both jungles, just different terrain. I served over there, as well. You got something on my son's murder ? We're looking into it. Was there anyone at church had a problem with Billy ? On the contrary. When he died, they buried him like a king. His casket, his headstone, the flowers... all courtesy of the congregation. Any chance we can get a list of the congregation members back then ? I'll check and see. But why ? Tom, you familiar with The Hive ? After-hours jazz club back in the day ? Why would I be ? I don't associate with those kinds of people. Ever mention a girl named Beatrice Sloan ? What are you implying about my son, Detective ? Nothing. Just trying to find out what happened. Well, when his brother died, it was rough on everyone. Me and Billy drifted apart a bit. He in some kind of trouble ? Drugs, money ? No, no. Not that I knew of. I just think he may have started to question his faith. Know anyone he was hanging with outside the church before he died ? - I'm sorry. I don't. But may the weight of the Lord be on their soul. Check out the "specials..." Winning numbers on the track today. Street lottery. Little numbers running with your soul food ? Hey, sweeties. Anywhere you'd like. Creamed chicken is to die for. Looks like a winner. Got to say, Queen Bee, step up from The Hive. Honey, I'm an honest businesswoman. Call Vice over, they going to agree ? The Hive ain't been around since the '70s. Well, there's no statute of limitation on homicide. Homicide ? Billy Sanders. Oh, Sanders. Yeah. Sad, 'cause he was a nice kid. Had this on him. He here the night he died ? Not that I remember. We're going to need the names of who might have been here that night. If any of them are still alive. All those musician cats wanted to be like Miles. They came with a nasty habit. Any of those cats have a beef with Billy ? No. Church boy ? Not at all. Seems like a tight fit for a jazz club. They didn't mind. I had to turn folks away. Shucks. Tons of musicians used to roll through here, but even I was shocked the night Billy Sanders appeared on my stage. Whoo ! Where did you learn to beat like that, kid ? Come on, now. Time to get paid. Uh-uh, gentlemen. The Bank of Geraldine doesn't give money away. You drank more than you played. No. Not tonight. Don't work like that. Hey, Miss Watkins. Billy ? I'm gonna see you and your mom at church on Sunday, right? Now, beat it. Your father know you're here, Billy ? No, and I'd appreciate if we kept it that way. Sorry to hear about your brother, sweetie. Oh, I didn't order anything. Be careful, young man. Thanks for the drink... miss. My mother's the only "miss" in my family. Can really play those drums. Play a lot more than that. - Really ? - Yeah, learn by ear. If-if I hear it, I can play it. So you can hold a beat, but you can't hold your liquor ? Well, well, I'm a quick learner. One more coming up. Who was the girl ? Beatrice something. Older, but wise to the fact that drummers keep the rhythm. - Beatrice Sloan ? - That's it. Yeah, used to work for Ronde Brooks. Ronde Brooks ? Of Ronde Records ? One and the same. But I always thought that Beatrice was Ronde's girl. Ronde know about her and Billy? You gotta ask him. Don't let the suit fool you, 'cause Ronde came up in the streets, and you don't get to what he had by getting chumped. Can I get you guys anything ? Perrier ? I'm good. I own every single one of these on vinyl. No kidding. You know, I've got a lifetime achievement ceremony in my honor coming up. I could put aside a couple of tickets. Thanks, but we're tied up with Billy Sanders' murder. Billy Sanders ? Yeah, I remember Billy Sanders. Session guy. You must've been pissed when you heard he was steppin' out with Beatrice, knocked her up. Guys, I don't-- I don't date my secretaries. Yeah, nobody with money does that. Beatrice would go around to the clubs and let me know which musicians to look at. Billy was one of them. - You and Billy get along ? - Sure. Yeah, we got along. He had a very strict old man, though. You know, when Billy wasn't churchin', he was workin' for me. But he asked me to pay him under the table. He wanted to keep it quiet. So, why didn't you come forward, make a statement after he was killed ? I didn't even hear about it until a week later. Kid quit coming around. - Why's that ? - Why do most of 'em ? He fell to the bottle or the needle. The one thing I will say about Billy, kid was all about the right place, the right time. Hold it. Yo, what's that ? You guys deaf ? Answer me. I was playing behind the beat. Sounded kinda fresh, you know. Damn it, kid ! Ronde, I-I'm sorry, man. I told him to stay on the beat. Stop, stop. What he's rollin' with sounds good. It's your drunk ass that's always trippin' us up, punchy. Hit the road. Beat it. Go sleep it off. You kiddin' me, man. Looks like I'm kiddin' ? You, jump in. Somebody come play bass. Behind the beat, like him. And with an ear like mine, some things just stick out to you. So, who was the mess ? That would be Buster Large. Soon after graduated to train wreck. You fire him ? Eventually had to. After Billy leapfrogged him, the fellas gave him hell. He crawled deep into the bottle, junk. He blame Billy for his troubles ? Ain't that what most addicts do ? Excuse me, detectives. So, Buster follows Billy home from The Hive, bottle in hand. Cracks him over the head, takes him out. Most expensive bottle of booze Buster ever bought in his life. Bet you wish all our vics were musicians. Freakin' kid in a candy store. No candy store I went to had the O'Jays on vinyl. Lot to choose from. You got any Spinners ? Philly Soul's over there, on wax. Buster, right ? Session guy over at Ronde Records back when. There was some other kid behind you on bass, Billy Sanders ? You guys cops ? Well, we're not here to sell insurance. You still hittin' the sauce, Buster ? Been clean 30 years. It's all good, but Billy was killed in 1970. I got along with Billy just fine. Really ? Was that before or after he made you the laughingstock of the Swamp-pit ? Billy wanted that gig, he could have it. Ronde was a slave driver, anyway. Feel the same way when you were poutin' outside the studio after you got canned ? Looking for your job back ? Look, hell, yeah, I got pissed. But I realized that Billy was just better than me. It was in his soul. And he knew what sounded good. "Papa was a Rolling Stone" by The Temptations.</i> Hey, why don't you ever bring me no drink, Beatrice ? Why don't you ever pass one up ? - Hey, baby. - Hey, baby. There's a girl here in her Sunday best. She says she's from your church. So, I was thinkin', um, maybe I could come by your place later. That's probably not a good idea. Look, come on, he catches me here, he'll skin my hide, let alone bring you home. Why's he so against you bein' here ? Told you, it's the way it is... and it's not what my brother would've done. - Hey. - Hey. How do I look ? You look great. Come on, don't be nervous. Relax. Ronde, this here's Chandra, the one I was telling you about. Got those gospel pipes. Not now. Uh, but you said you'd hear my friend sing... Can't you see I'm busy ? Gotta get these sounds right. Yeah, well, you know, you ain't never gonna get it right if you keep copying Motown. What, what did you say ? Your vocalists got no soul, no pain. Motown's got gospel. Screw Motown, all right ? This is Philly. Then let's actually tap into the Philly sound. Falsetto from the street corners we hear every day -- let's show that to the world. What you know 'bout makin' records, huh ? I know this mono stuff is junk. We need somethin' fresh, a fuller sound than Motown has ever imagined, strings and horns, all on different tracks. What are we, The Beatles ? Why not ? They it stole from us, let's steal it back. Okay, how 'bout this, kid ? As soon as you can pay for it, we'll do it. Deal ? - So then you'll listen to my friend ? - You crazy ? She ain't a front girl. She just a churchy with a fat ol' ass. Chandra. That's the last I saw of him. But the thing is, he called it. Wasn't long before Gamble & Huff took it to a whole new level. Who was his friend ? Chandra somethin', that's all I know. Sit tight, Buster. We may be back. And Philly Soul was the next step from Motown. Takes me back, man. Cruisin' in the drop-top, Billy Paul on the eight track. - Never heard of him. - Come on, man, how about The Intruders ? - Delfonics ? - Nope. All right, you got to at least know "Love Train." Yeah, song from the beer commercial. You're an ass, man. Needle in a haystack with this bottle label. State liquor store had nothing like it in stock. So long ago, bottle might not even be manufactured anymore. They didn't recognize it from anything back then either. Hit up the Liquor Control Board, see what I can find. This Chandra girl, Chandra Patterson. On the list we got from Billy's dad. How come choir girl never came forward after he was killed ? Lil, you know this kid over here ? That's the same dude from yesterday. Uniforms picked him up on a D&D, asked for you. Thanks. Hey. You asked for me ? Uh, I did ? What's your name ? Why'd you ask for me ? Downstairs, your name's on that board thing. Try again. You came in yesterday. Give me your I.D. Sean Thomason. Really ? That's a pretty good fake. What do you, uh, what do you do here ? Homicide. Why ? - You got info on a case ? - Homicide ? Well, that's cool. How long have you worked here ? What's with the personal questions ? He's a D-K. Put him dostairs, let him sleep it off. Everything cool ? Kid stinks. So, looks  like Chandra's still at it in the church. Only now, she's the choir director. Billy and Tommy were like older brothers. We'd sneak out of church events, find Motown or Stax on the radio. Where were you the night Billy was killed ? Home with my parents. I didn't really go out much on the weekends. Only when you went with Billy to Ronde's studio. You never told the police he worked at Ronde Records. Billy's parents lost both sons eight months apart. I didn't want to add insult to injury. Well, might've helped solve his murder. Billy changed from the boy I knew. He was drinking a lot. Started losing himself in the studio scene. But you wanted to be in that scene. Thought I was gonna be the next Aretha, but Ronde could care less about gospel vocals. Well, the way we heard it, Ronde stopped you at the gate. No. I got my chance to shine, and it was all because of Billy. Where the heck is Billy ? I'm here. I'm here. I couldn't split organ practice early. Dad stayed the whole time. All right, we're gonna need separate mics. Fresh from up here, fellas. Fresh from up here. And ladies. There you go. There you go. Follow my lead. Billy, what the hell ? Don't worry, you can pay me when it's a hit. Start us off. Tempo up. Just a bit. Rhythm section. Guitar. Strings. Horns. Choir, come on now. "Back stabbers" by Hope Olaide Wilson.</i> The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are on all his works. And boy, was the Lord good to Billy. I know that song. It was a pretty big hit, huh ? Sound that launched the label. He was Philly Soul. I still have the sheet music. You know, Billy footed the bill for all those musicians. Where did he get that money ? Well, not from what Ronde paid him. I'll tell you that. I don't remember a woman's voice on the track. When they recorded it, they swapped me out for three men who sang falsetto and could dance. Ronde's call. That's just the way it was. Billy didn't get cash from the old man. He'd never approve. Unless Billy was dipping into the donations basket. Pass the hot sauce. Well, the father could tell us who handled the church finances. If they're still alive. What's up, Will ? Liner notes. See something off, guys ? Music, lyrics, and arrangements. Ronde's a one-man show. Chandra said Billy wrote that song. So, why is Ronde getting sole credit for the track that launched the label ? Steal a little, you're a thief. You steal a lot, you're a king. Get up, Finn Cooper. Unless you want me to give this to your dad. You mean, our dad ? Must have really wanted to meet me. Yeah, I guess. Here I am. So, what do you want to know ? Just wanted to see what you look like, okay ? Did you call my dad ? Not my place. You could have saw me two days ago. Yeah, but there were all these cops and people around. It's kind of how it is around here. I don't know. What was I gonna say ? So, you get your load on, jammed up. There's easier ways. You always drink like this ? No. You know... It's just like, things are one way. Then it's, like, there's this other sister. They say you might be coming by ? Yeah. I mean... I don't know about that. Yeah. It's, like, weir right ? So, uh... So, what happened with you and Dad ? What do you mean ? It's like he's got this whole other life before. But I've never even seen a picture of the guy before he was like, 45, so... I guess there's some things he didn't want you to know. Like what ? Well, you have to ask him. Yeah, right. You need an officer to drive you home ? I can go ? Don't make a habit of it, okay ? Uh, yeah. No, I'll take the bus. - Thanks. - You know, you don't need to get locked up every time you want to see me. The great Ronde Brooks. I'm staring at those gold records, thinking, "Damn, if I had a tenth of that talent." But it was Billy's talent. The real innovator. Excuse me ? Billy wrote this. Yet I can't find his name anywhere. That's some cold jealousy. What happened when Billy learned you cuffed his song ? Cuffed his song ? You know how many people steal my stuff and call it their own? See, that's what lawyers are for, and I think I'd like mine. - Now. - Sure. Course, takes some time to process. Lifetime achievement award. Might have to miss the ceremony. Uh... hey... All right. So, Billy should have gotten credit. And one thing I know, when a guy's in trouble, he tends to make hasty decisions. Baltimore ? You're drinking all the time now. Suddenly, you care about that ? Things are different now, Billy. You owe cash to some really dangerous people. That was to make the record. You think Ronde cares ? You think he's ever going to pay you ? You used to believe in me. I do. Baby, I believe you can do anything you want to. But you're under Ronde's thumb. You know, and your dad controls every... You don't know anything about that. Well, I know you won't even introduce me to your family. Because I'm not... I'm not from the church. "If you don't know me by now" by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.</i> Damn it, Billy. Once I make it big, that'll all change. No, it won't. Look at you. I mean, what do you want ? You want to fill your brother's shoes ? Do you want to be your own person ? For us. I see. When you're ready to be a father, you let me know. Whoa, whoa ! You break it, you pay for it ! You owe me money, Ronde. You need to get some things in order. Give you enough so she can go take care of it. I don't want to take care of it! Ronde, this is my song on the radio. My song ! When it's picked up nationally, it'll be huge. Those are my lyrics. And my arrangements and my music. I did not authorize those extra musicians. You'll get paid when I get paid. You still work for me, son. Not anymore. Want out of your contract ? Pay you for the credit. Keep your mouth shut. Never have to see me again. Ten grand. Five. Not a penny more. Fine. I got plenty more hits in me. The kid help ? Yeah, sure. Sure, he helped. But he couldn't handle his own business. Hell, I've had 13 gold records since he died. I'm a master at what I do. You know who loaned him the money for the orchestra ? There's only one bank in Philly a black musician would have went to for that kinda cash. The Bank of Geraldine. The Liquor Control Board couldn't ID our label, but I got a list of local distributors that would have shipped the dark bottles back in 1970. Well, they can I.D. it, maybe they know where the bottle was shipped. I already sent them the label. Had an interesting chat with my buddy in Vice. Geraldine was more than a numbers runner. You don't say. Yeah, investigated her a few years back for loan sharking. Not enough to charge her, I take it. No, but one sap they picked up begged to stay in lockdown. Scared her goons would break his legs over 200 bucks. Billy owed a lot more than that. That's why he needed money from Ronde. Maybe heading to pay her back when he got jumped. Hey, come on, Serpico. It's your lucky day. Time for some real detective work. Nice to see you again, Queen Bee. Don't see numbers running on the menu. I told you everything I know about Billy. Left out you were pretty heavy in the loan sharking game. Not afraid to pop some kneecaps. Billy owed you some major coin. Okay, you got a warrant ? Oh, you want a warrant ? That's cool. Yeah, it'll just take, say, a few weeks. In the meantime, your friendly neighborhood officer will stand post, make sure business is on the up and up. Okay, all right, listen. Billy did owe me money. And he paid me back. Only his timing couldn't have been worse. Oh, hey. Hey. What you doing here, sweetie ? Um, hey, Geraldine. I got your money. $2,500. It's all there. You can count it. No, th-that's fine. Um, thanks. Thanks. Thanks, sweetie. "Me & Mrs. Jones" par Billy Paul.</i> I've never seen Tom so shook up. I mean, he had a reputation to protect. That's a pretty big scandal, you hitting it with the Reverend. Not my proudest moment. But being with him made me feel better about myself. Tom know Billy saw the cufflinks ? I lied, said he hadn't, and Tom didn't believe me. So, he went after him ? I don't know for certain. I mean, considering what happened... I sure hope not. Hey, Billy didn't take from the church, but get this. Clerk said she got an anonymous donation right after Billy died with orders for his headstone. $2,500 bucks. That's the exact amount Billy had on him. Found where our label came from. Philadelphia Winery. Communal wine. Explains why our label wasn't in a state store. Oh, it was shipped to church supply shops, including one down the street from Tom's church. Father catches son on the street, and they get into an argument. Dad gets the last word. Well, it looks like that anonymous donation was made with blood money. Told us you didn't know anything   about a place called The Hive, Tom. That's true. So you don't know anything about Geraldine Watkins, either ? Miss Watkins is a part of the congregation. Has been for 50 years. On Sunday, sure. But you were tending flock with a separate congregation on the side. Believe me, I've been making amends over that for 39 years. Recognize this ? Bottle of wine from our church. Same kind of bottle that killed Billy. Must have hurt when he found out you were a liar and a cheat. Not to mention a hypocrite, Tom. I know I was flawed as a husband and as a preacher, but I loved my son. Did you go after Billy that night, Tom ? I did. Searched all over. I only wish it would have gone differently when I found him. I was at the house. Mother said you packed some things. Everything okay, son ? Something on your mind ? I'm leaving home, Dad. I'm gonna start my life away from your church. - You'll do no such thing. - The music I do... it's not some sin. It's me. You'd know that if you'd just listen to it. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world... ... and lose his soul ? I can quote scripture, too. I just see things different. What I do-- it's like my own sermon, you know ? How dare you disgrace me like this ? How am I disgracing you ? Hanging with that element. Going around town, borrowing money. How do you know about that, huh ? From Geraldine ? You've got no right to question me, boy. I'm your father. Then act like it for once. Your brother's looking down on you now. I'm not Tommy ! Don't you get it ? He told me he was glad that he got drafted. Don't you talk about your brother. So he could get away from you. They took the wrong son. You judge me, but your preaching is as empty as your soul. The sins of the father do visit the son. What did you do after Billy left, Tom ? Went home... to my wife. Couldn't even look her in the eye. One thing keeps troubling us. A stranger makes a donation for Billy's headstone, and you're cool with it ? That headstone was gorgeous. It was inscribed with  Psalm 145. "The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies..." "...are on all his works." Whoever did that knew my son better than me. All he wanted was my acceptance. And I couldn't give it to him. Billy has a son who wants to meet you. Maybe now you got a second chance. Who else had access to the wine, Tom? We heard it was the choir director. Still is. We got this at the church. Who is that listed as the choir director from '70 to '71 ? Delia Patterson. You don't recognize your own mother, Chandra ? What does any of this have to do with Billy ? It was exciting being at the studio with Billy, huh ? The one time, yeah, but... It wasn't for you. I always just felt better in the church. But we got the contracts from Ronde's office. You didn't leave your backup gig, like you told us. You were fired about a week after Billy died. That's why you dedicated your talents to the church. You might have had the talent, but you didn't have the look. You were only there in the first place 'cause of Billy. Without him, you were nothing. In fact, you were always overlooked. By Ronde, then by Billy. Billy never overlooked me. Lot of pressure on Billy... the church, the studio. I'm sure trying to help you added to it. Good thing he had support from someone like Beatrice. What ?! Why ? Well, she loved him. Love ?! Please. She didn't even know him. Paid for his headstone after he died. She didn't pay for it. I... Kept hearing about this headstone. Wanted to see it for ourselves. "The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are on all his works." Psalm 145. An ode to Billy. Your atonement. Now, how'd you pay for it, Chandra ? With the exact amount Billy had on him when he was killed ? The groundskeeper at the cemetery says you're there at least once a month. I loved Billy. Ever since I was little, he was there for me. And when Billy needed you, you were there for him, weren't you ? He called, said he needed a ride to the bus station. You don't understand. I couldn't lose him. He was the only one who believed in me. Ooh! Thought I'd have to walk the whole way. Owe you tons. Oh, it's not a problem. Why you jumping to get to the bus station anyway ? Got to get to Baltimore. Finally stood up to my old man, Chandra. - I'm gonna move out on my own. - Really ? And look. I told Ronde to kiss my ass, and he actually paid me. Shove it, Ronde. But you're still gonna work for him, though, right ? What ?! No. I'm going to do my own thing. But you're the only one promoting me there. You said we were gonna make a record together. I believed you, Billy. And we can someday. Someday ? When ? Without you around, I'm just a ghost. You can't just leave. I have to. I'm gonna go get Beatrice and bring her back here, - so we can start a label. - Beatrice ? You know, it's because of her that I'm... I have the guts to do all this. Because of her ? Some assistant wants to leech off of you 'cause she knows you'll be something ?! No, it's not like that at all. She believes in me. I believe in you. She's pregnant. And I want to be with her. This is something that I need to do. No. We make... We make magic, Billy. You know... You know what I can do. - You're the only one. - Chandra, calm down. You said... You said we were gonna make it... - Calm down. - ... together. It'll be okay. You're great. We'll make a record someday. This is not about the record. I'm sorry.
