Think I'll get some real food. Nah, you're coming down to Shiny's. Come on, Mike. You don't like vodka breakfast? Got to work on my boat, fellas. Thing's a frigging masterpiece by now. Well, I'm taking it to Florida this year. Yeah. I'll bet you a round he doesn't do it. Double or nothing, next five years, he still doesn't do it. Funny. Yeah. Um, you guys just, um... I'll see you. Hello?! Hello?! Are you okay? What's, um... Hey, what's wrong with her? Oh, God. She's burning up. Hey. Hey. I am taking you out of here. No. Yes. You're sick. I'm taking you. Here we go. Feds have been building a case for years against an Eastern European criminal. Big-time guy, goes by Nachalneek. Nachalneek? Russian for "boss." He's the puppet master of a brutal organization. They have him? He's a phantom. Never been ID'd. What do his puppets do? Human traffic at the docks. Port of Philadelphia's been ID'd as a hub for importing young girls. Forced prostitution. Perfect access for New York, Jersey, DC. Had a female floater in the Delaware yesterday. Jane Doe so far. Think she was trafficked? Dental work's Eastern European. Poor quality, metal fillings. How she connect to Nachalneek? Right age, ethnicity. Other signs of his MO. Like? Cigarette burns. Soles of her feet. South detectives are working the Jane Doe floater. Where do we come in? Got any cold jobs like her? Solve that, might help the feds' case against Nachalneek. Don't recall any Jane Does like this. But we had a guy. Polish name. Cigarette burns on his feet. '05 job. You know him, boss? Case caught my eye. He was a longshoreman at the port. Working the docks, he could've crossed paths with Nachalneek. Might be the key to solving this guy's murder. And catching a ghost. www.1000fr.com present Capture:FRM@ID Sync:FRM@kingsdong</font> Mike Chulaski, 35 Longshoreman at Harrison Marine Terminal. No family. Six days before anyone reported him missing. Guy was invisible. Barely left a footprint. Workers on the docks said he never missed a day. And this... was his pride and joy. Nice boat. Wouldn't mind one like it myself. Mike lived on it. Went missing after he was killed. I'll start looking for it. Motel he was found in was on the other side of town. They were working a theory Mike was killed  by a pimp. Bludgeoned with a lamp. Lots of prints, no matches. Motel clerk said another guy rented the room. Can't describe him. No-tell motel for you. Copies of the bills of lading for the boxes that came into the terminal. Boxes? Containers. The FBI says the ones with the human cargo arrived when Mike's dock gang was working. Maybe Mike was in on it? We can't tell. But in shipping, nothing happens without the foreman knowing about it. Says here that was Roy Gardecki. Mike's boss. I'll go talk to him. Know a lot about the port. I worked on the docks when I was 16. Boxes from your terminal were used to transport young girls, Roy. Fellas, I already talked to the FBI. Not about Mike Chulaski's murder. Could be just what they need to push their case through. And you get 20 years inside. The feds don't know what it's like down here. Of course they don't. They don't know about the lowlifes coming around, preying on the working man trying to earn a decent wage. And you do? Worked here when I was a kid. Things I saw. Then you know it's backbreaking. It's hard work. Lot of temptation for the easy money. Regular guy like Mike Chulaski gets tempted. Ends up dead, right, Roy? So you and Mike line your pockets, look the other w when those containers came in. Money was good. Mike never knew about it. Why not cut him in? Wasn't that kind of guy. He had no idea. Till that morning. No, it's okay. What are we gonna do, Roy? She's so young. Where are her parents? Alright, easy there. Fifteen. Not so young. I'm calling the cops. Mike, think about what you could be getting into here. Phone. Kiril... for job. For me. No, no, no, no, no. You don't want a job with that guy. Mike. Mike! Come here. Look. You can put her back. Right now. ???? Let me... go. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You got anybody in America that we can call right now? Family? No. No family, anywhere? From orphanage. Ukraine. I don't have family either. Orphan. Me. Mike! What if that was you lying on that couch, huh? Sick kid? These people are running a business! She doesn't have anyone in the world! You know what that feels like? No one to look out for you. I do. You're gonna keep her? It's crazy. I'm not putting her in that van, Roy. And if you tell me to do it one more time... Well, maybe you and me... we'll go to the cops together. Who was this Kiril she wanted to reach? American. Transported the girls. Middleman. Got a number for him? Look, I told you what I know. Meet you back at the car, Nick. I know the waterfront, Roy. Mike stood up against the lowlifes. It got him crushed. You looked the other way. Now's your chance to make it right. I'm not asking. Give me a number for Kiril. Never had one. Runner dropped a message, which box to set aside, he'd show up to unload. That's it. Any idea who he was working for? Called him Nachalneek. Kiril was terrified of the guy. What'd Mike do with Lena? Took her to his boat. Said he was gonna help her. He say how? Try and get her a visa, take her to some community center for advice where people would know about that stuff. We don't deal with illegals. Must get a few in here. I mainly deal with exchange students who want to stay. Occasionally, these girls show up. Girls like Lena? Mm-hmm. They lie about how they got here, but we all know. Out of the containers. Any of the girls mention the name Nachalneek? No. They never give any details. I do what I can for them, but they're not supposed to be here. You try helping Lena? Can't help someone who doesn't want it. I have no money, Mike. This lady helps you for free. In America people do stuff 'cause they're kind, you know? Not 'cause they want something from you. You okay? She doesn't qualify for the T1 visa. Why not? She wasn't prostituted, was she? No, course not. Then technically, she's here illegally. That's how the embassy will see it, and they will deport her. That doesn't make sense. Back to Ukraine? No! Lena. Don't go. You don't understa what could happen to you. Can't go back. No money. No family. Nothing there. You got someone who cares about you now. You don't have to go it alone anymore. I'm hungry. Can I have candy bar? Why don't you eat a real meal? Get your strength up. Better than nothing, I guess. I got some change. Machine's that way. Growing up on your own... it's hard. People treat you like a punching bag. I don't want that to happen to her. Knocks the life out of you. There's not much you can do for her, I'm afraid. I can look out for her, you know? Like family. Young girl. Can be difficult. Lena? Lena! Lena? Lena! She makes a phone call and she's gone. I wish I could've helped more, but there's a new one every day. Think of anything else, you can reach us here. There's only one person Lena wanted to call. Kiril. So she goes to meet him? And Mike knows it. Tracks them down. Gets himself killed, playing hero. What do you got? I... need some lost hours. I didn't know who else to call since the husband took off. I last saw her a week ago. She won't answer the door. Okay. She's always saying how her daughter's got a good job. Smart girl. Is she? So, I thought maybe you cod take care of the rent. Due three weeks ago. Yeah, sure. You said it's been a week? Yeah. Mom? She all right? Mom? No. Call 911. You said you'd clean up this time. Nice job. Ending up in the ER. I gotta go home. You're not going anywhere. I'm going home, Lilly... Oh. Doctor said you can't drink again. Help me out here, will ya? Where's my coat? You have late-stage cirrhosis. You're getting admitted. You can't... have another drink again. Not one. I'm fine, Lilly. Yeah, you look great, Mom. What do you want from me? You'll have to come stay with me. I thought you were "getting too old for this." I said that when I still had a choice. Kiril's in custody. Tracked him to a pay-as-you-go cell. Kiril faces federal trafficking charges. Any deal's possible if he points to Nachalneek. Even if he killed Mike Chulaski? Any deal. US Attorney's gunning for Nachalneek. It's all about the big fish, huh? Never mind a poor working guy getting offed. Nachalneek's the prize. Prize... is locking up Mike's doer for life. Not for the feds. Yeah, we'll help them get their phantom. Good. Ain't gonna cut a deal with a murderer, though. Don't go cowboy on us, okay? What the hell does that mean? The Burrell job, Scotty. Vigilante dad? You screwed up. Don't screw this up. I put dirtbags away. You do the paperwork. Can't handle a strong woman, can you? No, maybe I just don't like you. Broken wing's more your type. You don't know me. Yeah. I do. Can't stand it, huh? Stand what? That I can handle you. So, how'd it go, Kiril? Mike steals away one of your girls, so you have him killed? My girls? I'd love to help you gents, but you got the wrong guy. Cut the BS. A witness saw you loading those girls into a van. Oh, look, I was just a driver. Picked up the girls, TVs, whatever needed delivering. You work for Nachalneek? Nah, just, just heard the name. But friendly advice? You might as well stop looking. Why's that? You talk about Nachalneek, you disappear. So where'd you take the girls and the TVs? That's where my memory fails me. Sorry, gents. Lay of the land, Kiril. You're looking at 20 in federal prison. For what? Trafficking. Witness, remember? Unless you prefer a murder charge for Mike Chulaski. I never killed nobody. Help us with Mike's murder, do a reduced sentence. So where'd you take Lena? Some.. crap building. 12 Pearl Street. What went on there? Dump full of underage tail? What do you think? And Mike? Oh, Mike was a dumbass of epic proportion. He find you on the docks after Lena disappeared on him? Yeah. Wanted something wasn't his property. Excuse me. What? Excuse me. Can you, uh... I gotta talk to you. Can you...? What? Where's Lena? Curly hair. Yea high. She's one of your girls. Oh. Agh... You're a rube. You're way out of your depth. Better walk away. I want her. What's that? I want her! You think you can get your rocks off for free? Hey, wake up. It's America. Nothing's for free. She's a kid. It's not like that. You're begging for this girl, and you say it ain't for sex? So what, you wanna watch TV together? Admit it. All right! All right what? I want to... bang her. You were right. Just... tell me where I can do that. 12 Pearl Street. Knock yourself out. Guy was just a horny perv like all the rest. That's all I know. So... I'm done, right? Sit your ass down. Your next stop's the federal pen. 12 Pearl Street's abandoned. Previous tenants all fake names. Dead end. So, Kiril played us? Not quite. Found a 911 call for an overdose to that address two years back. Gave the girl's real name. Kateryna Yevchenko. Accurint's got an address for her in Long Island. Town called Bellport. If Kateryna worked at Pearl Street, maybe she knew Lena. And saw Mike when he came looking for her. Didn't think you were coming in. Me neither. We've got everything covered if you gotta be somewhere else. I'd rather be here than where I was. Fair enough. You have an appointment? Kateryna Yevchenko? Detectives Valens and Miller from Philadelphia. We're looking into a homicide. Mike Chulaski. Ring a bell? He came to Pearl Street looking for a girl named Lena. Long time ago. I don't remember. That why you OD'd? What went on in that place, Kateryna? Bad as you imagine. Worse. We were slaves. How'd you get out? After I am too old for Pearl Street, I go on my own. I am good, so I get nest egg. What about this guy Mike? I take money from Mike to bring him to Lena. She wasn't with the others? In different room because she resisted. Another $50. Mike. Lena. Oh, God. They lied about job, Mike. I know. They lied. I'm gonna get you out. They won't let you. They will kill her. What's wrong? My feet. Cigarette burns. She can't walk. You get her hopes up, you make it worse for her. You cannot save her. I'm not leaving you here Lena I can't walk, Mike. Nachalneek's coming. Listen, this necklace, you see this? It's St. Nicholas. He'll keep you safe until i came back. I've seen you before. You should know better, Katya. Get him out. Mike, don't leave me here. Don't leave me. Don't leave me here! Don't leave me here! I'll come back for you, I promise! Come back and you're dead. Nachalneek was Boyka? I will never testify against her. That was her thing? The burning? What she did to us. Punishment. So Mike promises he's going back for Lena... ???? So you're the famous Nachalneek. Lot of people looking for you. "Nachalneek" just means boss. Could be anyone. There's a witness. This person wants to testify? The FBI is charging you with violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And this person wants to testify? That's their issue. We have you for murder. Mike Chulaski. I don't know who that is. You met him when he came looking for Lena, one of your girls. Winds up dead with your trademark cigarette burns on him. Someone has framed me. You got to do better than that, boss. I'm happy to. Honesty is the best policy. Let me in! I'm not leaving! You are risking your life for nothing. What do you want for her, money? I need a young one. Take Kateryna instead. Blonde, beautiful, doesn't complain. I want Lena. Everybody left her, but not me. I won't. You can't afford Lena. I'll give you $50,000. You have this kind of money? I'll get it. She has potential, but she's difficult. Get the money, you can have her. Kiril will contact you. So Mike and Kiril met up? Starlight Motel. Kiril went for my money, but I never saw it or Lena or Kiril again. You're locked up, Boyka. On what charge? Prostitution and conspiracy. I'll be in jail one night. Don't fool yourselves. But thank you for finding him. Kiril. He's in custody. You can't touch him. Oh, no? You got stones, Kiril. Turned on Nachalneek. Pocketed Mike's money, killed him at the motel swap. Who told you that? Nachalneek herself. AKA Boyka. She know I talked to you? Yeah. You two got a lot to sort out. Maybe they should talk face-to-face. You got to get me out of general population. You want that, you better start singing. For starters, how is it you're in a motel room with Mike, and he ends up with his head bashed in? Okay, I'll tell you. Just protect me from her. Listening. I got two rooms at this motel in Point Breeze. Why two? I met Mike in one; Lena's in the other. The plan was, when I got the cash, I'd call Lena, bring her to him. That was pretty cloak-and-dagger. Was Boyka's idea. That way, Mike would never know where Lena was, if he got stupid. Mike bring the money? No. The dumbass got stupid again. $50,000. I got eight grand here. And I got the rest coming from a loan. ???? Deal's off. I got a bo. It's a beauty. Perfect, actually. I don't need a boat. You'll make money on this. You could sell it, get $70,000 in a heartbeat. 70? How do you figure? I spent the last ten years of my life fixing it up. I mean it. It's a prize. That's coming from you, though. You're a capital "T" tool. Go look at it. Tacony Marina, slip 220. Keys. I'm not giving them up without Lena. Forget it, then. You take the boat. I take her. She's my family now. Your boyfriend's acting like a dumbass, as per usual. So sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour. Stay put. Mike was still alive when you left? Yeah. Watching me from the door, that idiot. And when you got back? Head's smashed in, boat keys missing. Lena still in the other room? You think I stuck around to find out? I screwed up a job for Boyka. That's the end of the road. I got lost. Miller found Mike's boat. The marina up in Connecticut. Find an owner? Guy says he bought it in cash here in Philly from a young girl, foreign accent. Lena. Kid didn't have a heart of gold after all. Kiril give this up? New house run by Boyka. Thinking one of these girls knows where Lena ran? Locked in a house together. Must've shared something. Don't really want to see this. Lena? Lena. I'm not Lena. Lena, we found Mike's boat. Stop calling me that. It's not my name. You want to forget who you used to be? When you first came here, met Mike. He saved you. I know you remember. 'Cause you kept his necklace. That thing. I don't know what it is. You remember, Lena. How Mike told you'd always be safe with this necklace, and how you betrayed him. Me betray him? I did not! You took his money, and you left him to die. He is dead? He was murdered. Mike said... in America, people do things to be kind. But they don't. Mike didn't want anything from you. That's right. Not from me. His house is a boat. Ow! I make you look nice. Sit still. And he says that you never are dizzy after you live there for a few days. And he say I can go to school for free, no problem. Ow! Shh. I don't want you to get your hopes up, little duck. But Mike promised me. How many time I've seen people in this country tell lies. Not Mike. He is different from everybody. Mike? Your boyfriend's acting like a dumbass, as per usual. So sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour. It is Mike? Lenushka. I am so sorry. What? It is good you did not hope too much. What did he say? Mike wants a girlfriend. For sex. He asked for me, the pretty one. My poor little duck. He said he would come for me. He wants me now. Stay here. Someone will come for you. I gave up hope like she said. Doesn't hurt anymore. Wait. He came for you. Not Kateryna. She lied, not Mike. No. They all lie. He gave up ???? His boat is... is where he live. And he was willing to give it up. For me? He was killed trying to save you. He said that you were his family. Get what you wanted, Kateryna? I earn it all. I work very hard to get what I deserve. The American dream. Now I can be new person, hold my head up. Every dream takes sacrifice. What was yours? I sold my body. Does things to you. Makes you desperate. You were at the motel. Went to Mike's room, night he died. You lied to Lena. Said Mike didn't want to save her. He didn't. He was like all the others. Like the other men who hurt you? Why'd you take away her chance to have a decent life? I was dying in that house, too. So you killed a man. Finally get something for yourself. You don't understand what it was like. How could you?! Ten men a day? Spitting on you, ripping you apart. When I first got there, I resisted, too. I used to believe someone would come and take me away. But no one came. Mike did. Not for me. You've seen Lena? Where has Kiril gone? Huh? Uh, to see my boat. I'm giving it to him for Lena. Where's Lena? Is she okay? She is not here. Now relax, Daddy. Yes, yes. Did something happen to her? Okay.Get off me! Choose me instead. I am much better. You want me to be sister, daughter? Please. I will. What are you doing? Don't make me go back to that house. Mike, you are a nice man. I give you anything. I just want Lena. That's all. No, no. Help me. I'll help you once I've got her, okay? Please. Can't let her down. I'm all she has. I want somebody to care for me so I am not alone. I'm sorry. I got to find Lena. What about me? I got to go.I'm sorry.
