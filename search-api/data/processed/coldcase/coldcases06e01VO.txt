- i needed the money. students who couldn't throw an inflated ball actually had to pay their own way. whitney fellowship? what's that? it's an academic scholarship. gonna pay for my grad school. free ride,just like me. what are you gonna study? you got a beowulf paper due in two weeks. i can write that for you next weekend. shouldn't you help me with it? {\a6}("do it again" by steely dan playing) you read beowulf? just started it. yeah. you should stick to your playbook.i'll handle the paper,t-bone. it's bad moon. you know,you guys sound like a ponderosa menu? t-bone,chunk,ribeye. you never had a nickname. that's your problem. don't worry. i'll think of one for you. - hey mike - how you doing,cynthia? these players needed guys like me. they'd lose their eligibility if their gpa fell below a 2.0. hey,what about the pills he was taking? i tutored a lot of players. they were always jacked up on something. - painkillers or uppers. - where'd they get the drugs? they had some quack supplying the whole team. now,this,uh,quack doctor,ever hear his name? no,i'm sorry,i really... wouldn't know about that. name pez ring any bells? no. you'd have to ask someone on the team. right. you were just a... tutor. uh,if you think of anything else, professor,let me know. i don't understand. mike was never sick a day in his life. - your son never mentioned taking any pills? - pills for what? maybe to help recover from a game? injury or pain? the-the team was on a vitamin program. - a vitamin program. - mike never liked it. he always hated needles from the time he was a little boy. these vitamin shots,do you know who gave them to your son? no. he just told me the whole team took them. you wouldn't believe all the trainers and doctors they have now. i used to have to tape my own ankles. what was the doctor's name you saw back in the day? you mean the team doctor? no,the other one,uh, the guy off campus,the local guy. - had a crazy nickname. - pez? what about him? hooked you up with painkillers,cortisone,right? whatever it took to get the body back on the field. what about vitamin shots? vitamin shots? what are you talking about? do you remember the doc's real name? what's he got to do... with bad moon's murder? i don't know. we'll see. long time ago,will. come on,al,you kicked up the dust on this case,brought it to me. where you going with this? thinking steroids. back then? i never saw it. no. the warriors ran a clean program. then why go under the table for shots? except to break ncaa rules,not to mention the law. i don't believe it. then tell me the doctor's name. if you're right, and this gets out, the whole program, even now,people will get hurt. screw the warriors program,al. the kid got murdered. we got to see this through. just give me a name. dr. lason,nice digs you got here. i understand you did some work with the warriors back in the day. former players are starting to talk. your name keeps coming up... pez. i run a sports medicine clinic. i make my money on player referrals. did you drive a red duster back in the '70s? no,and i don't think i like the tone of this conversation. you called mike the night before he was killed. - wanted to meet. - that just a bad coincidence,doc? - my attorney's number. - you were involved in a drug ring where a kid ended up dead. thanks for your time,dr. lason.if we have any more questions,we'll give you a call. what's up? check out dr. lason's golf buddy. son of a bitch. popular guy,this pratt. big game tomorrow. oh,playing michigan for the 75th time. you got to love college tradition. tradition like doping the players? i don't understand. dr. lason,steroids,your money. understand? mike was just like the rest of the boys. he would do anything to play ball! including taking steroids? nobody knew the side effects. hell,nobody even knew what they were back then. not that you bothered to find out. we thought we were helping him. it had nothing to do with mike's death. so why was he calling dr. lason? it was about breeze. you okay,man? i'm okay. i'm okay. are you sure? just don't say anything to coach. come on,breeze. something's wrong here. i'm begging you,mike.don't tell them. please? don't. mike,don't! mr. pratt! what'd you do? my advice was for him to tell the coach. turns out that breeze had a bad kidney which he didn't want the team to know about. a life-threatening condition. - when was this? - a couple of days before mike died. mike must have called dr. lason to take a look at breeze. that when the coach let breeze go? yes. and breeze blamed mike for it. i sure hope not. it's not looking good for the breeze-man. being kicked off the team,lying about pez. a little 'roid rage. bad stuff happens. i'm pulling him in tomorrow morning. thinks he's gonna look at mug shots. it's kinda sad.these guys still so stuck in it. the glory days. i keep waiting for mine to start. i'm outta here. audi? what,are you 16? sorry,granny,i must depart. i'll see you guys tomorrow. yep.all right. two of whatever this guy's having. oh,detective rush. i'd say you we're lookin' smokin' hot, but it'd be an inappropriation to my co-worker. i wouldn't want that. inappropriation a word? should be. i came over 'cause i got a question. question away. you were talking to that addict on the last job. how it is when you started using. you're free. you're flying. sounds like you've been there. so you're thinking,"what's a guy in na doing in a bar?" that or you're a better liar than i am. liar? i consider us storytellers. you know,like i came over 'cause i got a question. - that was no "story." - there you go again. - ***** - i got you,detective. that's what you're having? appletini. problem? what sorority you pledge in? it's good. don't knock good. hmm,don't knock good. check this out. you got talent. gotta say. i could teach ya. the bar trick? yeah,but then you have to join my sorority. are you making an inappropriation? thanks for coming in. sorry. that smile for me? the hoagie. he in there? got him waiting. - morning. - morning. - this is detective rush. - nice to meet you. said you might have a suspect. yeah. you. let's count the lies: pez,steroid use, how they booted you off the team.i miss anything? oh,yeah,the one where he had nothing to do with mike's death. - i didn't. i swear. - they didn't just kick you off the team. they took away your scholarship. you didn't keep up your grades,so they sent you packing. it was all mike's fault. your best friend betrayed you. no way he did that.he stood up for me. the thing with mike is that he thought with his heart. told the truth, and that can get you into trouble with some people. hey,hold on. taking away my scholarship,too. together we stand,my ass. i'm sorry,breeze. - i didn't mean to do... - it's not your fault,man. just... just bad luck. there you are. not now. i'm trying to save your ass from flunking.your beowulf paper was due this morning. - i turned it in. - you were supposed to give it to me. it's half your grade.you get an f,i'm the one who takes the heat. i got a team meeting. the same team who just took away the halfback scholarship? he gets sick,all of a sudden they got a problem with his gpa? that's a mistake i'm gonna fix. i'll get breeze back on the team. a mistake? come on,mad dog,those 'roids are clouding your head. i'm not on steroids,you little maggot. so you become a warrior,and suddenly you're benching 400 pounds? you don't know what you're talking about. no,it's simple,mike. you pass,you play. team wins,school makes money. everybody's happy. that's how it works. you're a dollar bill to them. you're the one getting paid here. and if i flunk,you're done. i'm a dollar bill to you. don't worry about me. i got a life after college. i wonder what would happen to your stupid fellowship if they knew you cheated for football players. that kid was pissed off. you're saying nerd bashed the fullback's head in? doesn't take much to sneak up on somebody. that takes a coward,right,breeze?and it is about you. moon took away your football career. i was in the emergency room all day that saturday. the doctors were trying to save my kidney. the same kidney made worse by the steroids they fed you. - yeah. - it's the way they treated you. how could you work there? it's the only thing i got. i tell you what. in that backfield with moon... still the best days of my life. quit shoving me,man!i got rights! can it or i tighten the bracelets. who's she? detective rush. she's cool. well,then get these damn things off me,man. that glorious stench?chanel dumpster no. 5. that's all right.captain says you're gonna remember what it's like to stink real soon. you going someplace,saccardo? joint operation with the feds coming down.just waiting to hear. send me a postcard. uh,yeah,no,i'm not kidding. it's about the hit-and-run report you filed 30 years ago. yeah,a red duster hit your car near the university around 10:00 a.m. yeah. did you get a look at the driver? uh,it says in the report the duster that hit your car had no plates. dealer plates or no plates? um,my assistant wants to know if they were dealer plates. yeah. thanks,pal. dealer plates. suspect was fleeing the scene in a brand-spanking-new car. let's find us a duster. so how'd you afford grad school with no loans? what does this have to do with mike mcshane? mike was gonna tell those fancy scholarship guys you were a cheat. you knew after mike left the tickets,he'd take the shortcut back to the dorm. you wait for him,professor? - if you think... - we think... you saw mike again. bashed the guy's head in. all right,i was mad at him! maybe it was my fault. - your fault? - if i just hadn't, i don't know,shined the light... maybe he'd be alive. ("blue sky" playing) i just met with a doctor in town. he said i had signs of liver damage. side effect of steroids. i can't believe they did this to me. to all of us. i should have listened to you - about a lot of things. - i don't know anything. i stopped by your english prof's office. just graded your beowulf paper. - how bad was it? - got a b+ all on your own. no way. maybe i should have listened to you. don't get all sappy on me,you little twerp. - you still gonna play tomorrow? - why? just figured maybe you weren't gonna be playing for those idiots anymore. fall football... chill in the air, pads cracking,fans screaming, going so hard you think you might die,but then you don't. they can't take that away. let him who may win glory before death: for that is best. at last for the departed warrior. you really did read it. i'll leave you tickets for the game. hey... i thought of a nickname for you. i was gonna go with "bones,"but then it hit me... wiglaf. thanks,bad moon. wiglaf. that's from beowulf. yeah,the only warrior who stood by beowulf at the end. helped him slay the dragon. - mike's way of saying thanks. - i guess so. did mike tell you what he was gonna do? he said he was gonna talk to coach walters about breeze. thought he'd never have the chance,but now... you think mike stood up to walters. would have been the first,that's for sure. you got a lot to answer for,coach, treating those players like disposable meat. they were treated like kings. yeah? breeze,too? breeze got sick. because of your steroid program. mike ever come to you,to talk about it? yeah,he came to me. friday night. not saturday morning.that's convenient for you. i was with the coaching staff all saturday morning. then about 70,000 witnesses saw me on the sidelines. why don't you call one? you like that,don't you? fans cheering. all that glory on saturdays. bet you'd do anything to keep it. anything to shut mike up. - i didn't kill mike. - then what did you say to him? not a hell of a lot... but with breeze off the team,he loses his scholarship. if he can't keep his grades up... but that was never a problem when he was starting. was it? he's given everything to the team. i mean,together we stand,right,coach? finished? - i-i just think that we need to... - get the hell out of my office. - you don't give a rat's ass about us,do you? - watch yourself,boy. walk away before you lose your own damn scholarship. - you'd do that,wouldn't you? - put your pads on tomorrow and be a warrior. i will never put on a warrior jersey again, you son of a bitch. and you let that stand? he would've played. they always do. besides... ...not my job to mollycoddle players. now,that's what the boosters are for,right? take 'em to dinner,slip the players cash. - handle a mess like mike. - your point? steve pratt did the dirty work. you called him,right? after all these years,still beholden to steve pratt. you needed your new stadium,right? this used to be a game,coach. you ever miss that? george! you folks being helped? steve pratt sent us. why didn't you say so? you affiliated with the program? class of '92. looking for a duster. they stopped making those in the '70s. we used to sell a ton of 'em. steve said he test-drove in one once. that true? sure.the players loved 'em. tell us more. looked you up in some old warrior programs,steve. can't seem to find your game stats. well,i was on the team. we went to the orange bowl. but you never played. does that even count? it counts. well,you've been pretending you're somebody else for a long time 'cause you were nothing like bad moon. well,you were... warming the bench. together we... sit. you two... don't know what the hell you're talking about. mike was like a son to you. must have stung when he said he was leaving the team. he was his own man. you try and talk to him? i mean he must have come to you. if it was... just a talking-to,that we can understand. i had a chat with your buddy at the dodge dealership over in roxborough. he lent you a red duster the morning mike was killed. same one you returned after the hit-and-run. you know,there's gotta be some mistake. no mistake. got a tailgater who id'd you driving away from the crime scene at 9:30. well,i can go get our witness right now. they'll put you through a lineup,lie detector... up to you. you took him for a drive just...to talk. right? to...work it out. you always had a way with those kids,didn't you? just... went for a drive to talk. you were the father he never had. always tried to be there for him. well,you gave everything to mike. you rescued him from his small town. yeah. you threw parties.you took him to fancy restaurants. you made that kid. i treated him like a son. and how does mike thank you? stirring up trouble. - going behind your back. - the coach calls you to fix it. that's your job: to take care of it. well,mike starts talking,you lose everything. and the games,the parties... a son. i tried. i tried to tell him not to do it. not to do what,steve? tell us what happened,steve. tell us so you don't have to live with this anymore. god help me. well...i was gonna wait till after the game,but... that's all yours,son. you deserve it. imagine driving through campus in this baby. pretty blonde riding shotgun... you think this is about a car? what? don't you get it?you're ruining the game i love. - you're thinking too much,mike. - you don't want me to think. you pump us full of steroids without telling us. - those things help you. - it's cheating. it isn't right. look,i came here to play ball and get a degree. well,guess what? you don't play,you don't get a degree. - okay? so buck up. - my grades are good. - i can get a scholarship anywhere in the country. - mike,come on. okay? nobody's talking about you leaving here. i'm not staying unless breeze does, unless certain things change. oh,my god. what the hell is wrong with you? do you have any idea how lucky you are? - how stupid you're being right now? - i trusted you. you know,i-i actually th... i was wrong. oh,what,about me? is that what you're saying? i discovered you. okay? i made you everything you are.you'd still be pumping gas back in latrobe. - that's not true. - you've eaten at my table. you never said no to a freebie,did you? $50 here,$50 there. - that was for books. - you think this is easy? everything i do for you? for all my boys? - your boys? - yeah! your boys think you're a joke. - what'd you say? - you're a benchwarmer. - you're trying to relive glory you never had in the first place. - you..!! - shut your mouth. - no! if you're what being a warrior is, forget it.
