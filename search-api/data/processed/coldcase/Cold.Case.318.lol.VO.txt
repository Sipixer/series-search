This is insane. What am I thinking? I can do this. I'm as good as the next guy. Next. What are you singing? - "Willkommen"? - Of course. Give me your name, tell me something about yourself. Dennis Hofferman. Um... I'm just a cabdriver. A singing cabdriver. That's terrific. I've never really sang in public before. I've... never done anything like this before. That's fine. ¢Ü Willkommen, bienven... ¢Ü Sorry. Butterflies. You know what? Um... maybe I'll just come back. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why don't you just turn around, face the back of the stage? No prying eyes. Just you, alone in your cab. ¢Ü Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ¢Ü ¢Ü fremde, etranger, stranger ¢Ü ¢Ü Gluklich zu sehen ¢Ü ¢Ü je suis enchante ¢Ü ¢Ü happy to see you bleibe, reste, stay ¢Ü ¢Ü Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ¢Ü ¢Ü im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret ¢Ü What's taking Dennis so long? Clinton, go find him. Tell him we're minutes away, for Pete sake. Dennis? Showtime. Dennis? And now! Final time you're telling me guns and mess, you all, ladies and gentlemen. - Good morning, boss. - Morning. Detectives Rush and Vera, this is Della Gardener, theater owner. Morning. Excuse me if I'm still trembling like a leaf. It's been a very upsetting morning. Stagehands were moving set furniture out of storage and they dropped a piece. Take it that's not a prop. No, it's a real live .38. Mrs. Gardener had bought the furniture used, a few years ago. Got a very good deal on it. I bet. Who was the original owner? Francisville community theater. There was an unsolved murder there in 2002, place shut down. This was the dresser from the set of Fraulein Schneider's boardinghouse. They were doing Cabaret. Actor went out for a smoke before the show, was shot and killed with a .38. Wallet was missing and there'd been a series of holdups in the area. But someone off the street wouldn't have been able to slip unnoticed onto the stage, hide the gun. So if this gun's the murder weapon, shooter was from inside the theater. We need to go back and look at actors, crew, whoever else was inside. ¢Ü "Life is a Cabaret, old chum." ¢Ü ¢Ü "Come to the Cabaret." ¢Ü I hate musicals. Well, you wouldn't if you'd seen me as Danny Zuko in my eighth grade production of Grease. Brought the house down. Cold Case 3x18.

One of the most dangerous jobs there is, and the guy gets shot doing a musical. Was killed opening night, before the curtain even went up. Robbery theory seemed solid at the time. That part of Francisville had a string of holdups, same M.O. One shot to the chest, close range, wallet gone. Somebody sure wanted it to look like a robbery. Ballistics confirms the .38 is the murder weapon. There was a fiance, Gloria Hill. Let's talk to her first, see if Dennis was having trouble with anyone there. Then we gotta talk to a bunch of actors. Try and guess who's telling the truth. Dennis was the sweetest guy I ever knew. Honest to the bone. And that's not so easy to find, you know? Yeah. I do. We were real happy. About to set a wedding date, too. You two meet here? My family owns the place. Dennis was right out of community college, took it as a temporary job after his mom died. But he stuck around. Got comfortable, I guess. But he had so much talent. Was my leading man right here in the garage. What made him decide to audition for Cabaret? - Did he know someone at that theater? - No. He saw the sign driving by. Said it was like a siren went off in his head. Week later, he auditioned. How'd he get along with the group there? There was some trouble right from the beginning. What kind of trouble? Neither of us had any idea what a cutthroat world the theater was. No nerves. They're lucky to have you. Thanks. This show is about the danger... of not facing the truth. The truth about others, and, most important, the truth about yourself. So I have a question. Can you shut off your memory and live in the now? A community will form here if and only if... you... trust... me. Trust me. And why should you trust me? Because I've acted with Uta Hagen on stage and with Bobby Deniro in movies? No. You should trust me... because I'm the director. Rehearsal! Let me have my Sally over here, my Cliff over here, my emcee over there. Shut off my memory. Live in the now. Wow. That's intense stuff. - So you're playing Sally? - Yep. Name's Nora. I saw you at the audition. You were really good. God, I was so nervous. I just, I wanted it so bad. I can't believe I got a lead role. - Oh, sorry. - Yeah, watch it. - I was just... - So you think Cliff is the lead roll? It's one of them, isn't it? No, the emcee is the star of this show. I'm in every damn scene. Cliff is just some sucker who walks around and watches everybody. I mean, you don't even have your own song, man. Listen, I'm sorry if I offended you. Of course, the emcee is a lead role. I don't think you're hearing me. You get in my way, you step in my space, and you ain't gonna make it to opening night. Denny was so excited about that first rehearsal, he didn't even sleep the night before. Then that Clinton had to ruin it for him. What did Dennis think about Clinton? He didn't mention it again, and I thought things got better. Guess I was wrong. - What can I get you guys? - We're not here for the cosmos. Oh, too bad, I make a mean one. We've got some questions about Dennis Hofferman. I'm buried here. Show's gonna start soon, and I got to serve people. Hey, you wouldn't want to lose your job. Criminal record of yours could make it hard to find work. That's a cheap shot, man. That theft charge is from way back. Theft, possession, trafficking stolen goods, you were a real live gangbanger, weren't you, Clinton? I was messed up, yeah. But that was before I got with the theater, got off the street. We heard you brought trouble right in with you, got tough on other actors, threatened Dennis. I learned real early how to play tough to cover up being scared. That's all it was, but I got over it. And me and Denny got tight. - You can ask anybody in the cast. - We will. Look, I had no reason to hurt anybody there. That place turned my life around, put me on a solid path. I'm a family man now. Problem is, we know someone from inside killed Dennis. And you're the only one with a rap sheet. Let's just say that I wasn't the only one with anger management issues. You got something to say, I suggest you let it fly. Our big daddy director... had a serious dark side. Mama... doesn't even have an inkling... that I'm working in a nightclub in a pair of lacy pants. So, please, sir. ¢Ü if you run into my mama ¢Ü ¢Ü don't reveal my indiscretion ¢Ü ¢Ü Give a working girl a chance... ¢Ü ¢Ü Hush up, don't tell mama shush up ¢Ü ¢Ü don't tell mama don't tell mama, whatever you do... ¢Ü ¢Ü if you... if you... ¢Ü Oh, my bad. I forgot where I'm supposed to be. I think my cross messed you guys up. No, you guys were perfect. I'm the idiot. Found a whole new thing I'm awful at. Dancing in heels. Line, please! If you had a secret, you bet I would keep it. ¢Ü I would never tell on you ¢Ü You think it's cute, that you don't know what you're doing? - Of course not, I... - Nora, I actually believed in you. Sally Bowles is supposed to be a second-rate singer, but you are hovering below third-rate! Try harder! And the emcee is supposed to be from the streets. I want you to give me some of that dirt, that edge, not this lazy punk attitude. Try harder! Lyle is just the music director, and yet, he knows every word, and you can't remember your own? Pathetic! I think they're both really talented. I know you're a big shot in the business, but that doesn't mean you can treat people like that. You think you know better than I do, cabbie? I'm just saying you don't have to be mean, that's all. I will be and do whatever it takes to get this show to the next level. - Do you understand? - I guess not. Then let me explain. My reputation is on the line here, and I will crush anyone before I let them embarrass me or ruin what I have worked 30 years... to build! Take five! - Good looking out. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. Dennis stood up for us. I don't think Rafe ever forgave him for that. You saying that's motive for murder? The thing is, Rafe came asking me about guns a few weeks before Dennis was killed. What? I know I should have said something, but I'm the one with the record, and I knew I'd be the one to get in trouble. - For talking to him about guns? - He wanted me to get him one. You know, since I knew my way around the streets. So I did a .38. Rafe Webb? That's right. Detectives Rush, Miller. Lady cops, terrific. Here to ask you about Dennis Hofferman. What a tragedy that was. Two years ago, I did Ibsen. I played the father of a dead child, and I tapped into my feelings for Dennis. - Got the best reviews of my life. - Congratulations. Rafe, we hear you got yourself a gun a few weeks before Dennis died. Well, how is that relevant? Dennis was shot in a stick-up. New information says otherwise. Well, I, uh... - I'm afraid I did get a gun. - And why'd you do that? I heard the cop movie "Blue blood" was shooting in Philly. I was going to audition. I'm method. I needed to tap into the emotions of holding a gun if I was going to play a cop. So you bought a real one? Yeah, I went to target practice, too, and then the studio decided to cast Blue blood out of Hollywood. Where's the gun now, Rafe? It was stolen out of my office just a little time before the show. - And you never mentioned this before? - You see... I bought it illegally, so I couldn't exactly report it stolen. That's kind of shaky, Rafe. Especially since people saw you and Dennis fighting. Said you weren't too happy with him. Our relationship was tumultuous, yes. You see, my style is to tear actors down, and then build them back up. I don't shoot them. We could bring him in right now for buying the gun. Might help him tap into the emotions of jail time. Look, I didn't kill Dennis, and I don't know who did. But there was a little situation that Dennis had gotten himself into. ¢Ü I met this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü ¢Ü and she skillfully managed to talk her way into my room ¢Ü Very nice, you two. What are you smiling about? I don't know. I've just been kind of flying on air since rehearsals started. Me, too. This place is kind of magical, isn't it? All right. Now, do you all remember when I said that trust is the key to performance? Well, I want to try something. Put down your scripts, come up here and form a circle. Here's what I want. I want you to fall back into the arms of the person behind you. Before you fall, I want you to tell a secret about yourself, something that you have never shared before. It's all about creating a safe environment, people. Start with you, Robin. I felt relief when my father died. Clinton, to me. I don't trust any of you. I respect that. Dennis? I started driving a cab because I didn't want to be lonely all the time. That's deep. That's deep. Nora, to Dennis. I think I'm falling in love with my leading man. Me? Plenty of blowups at this place, huh? Welcome to the theater. So what was Lyle's problem? He had a thing for Nora, I'm afraid. How did Dennis take Nora's confession? He made it perfectly clear to Nora that he had a fiancee, but she didn't like that. Did either of them have access to your office, where you kept the gun? Everyone did. I never locked it. Nora and Lyle are on their way in now. - So we're looking at the love triangle? - Yep. Nora angry at the rejection, Lyle the jealous outsider. We believe this director? Plenty of big dramas with these people. Hard to sort through what's real and what's made up. That Clinton kid seemed on the level. You kidding? You actually bought his act? I'll put money down on Clinton being clean. Five bucks. /  Five bucks? What kind of stakes are those? 20 bucks on the director as doer. Biggest liar, biggest ego. I'm going with Lyle the piano man. Sneaky guy with a bad crush. I say Nora. Lady could handle a .38 easy, and the female species ain't exactly on my good side right now. - What's this? - It's an IOU. I'm going Clinton, the emcee. A street kid who couldn't break his bad habits. ¢Ü Life is a Cabaret, my friends ¢Ü Hey, here's my gal now. Hi. Is one of you detective Valens? I perform on cruise ships these days. You'd be surprised how high-end the productions are. Oh, I've heard they're top-notch. Nora, how did you feel about Dennis? Honestly? I was in love with him. Must have been hard, falling for a guy who was engaged to someone else. And humiliating. once everyone else knew about your feelings. Is that why you shot him? I would never hurt Dennis. He was this beautiful, open person who saw the best in everyone. After two months, it was like we'd always known each other. But there was that little problem of his fiancee. Dennis didn't want to hurt her. But, after the show's run, he was going to leave her. - For me. - Really? 'Cause that's the first we've heard about it. We found ourselves during Cabaret. And we found each other. We hear you got pretty upset when Nora announced her feelings for Dennis. Me and every other straight guy there. But you were the only one who stormed out of the theater. I didn't storm out of the theater because of my little crush on Nora. Why, then? These little dramas within the drama always end up hurting the show. These actors are given a chance to perform onstage, realize a dream, and they risk it all for these fleeting emotions. But sounds like you were suffering some fleeting emotions yourself. Nothing I'd let interfere with the performance. So you're pretty dedicated. The theater's my life. I love it. But I know exactly what can happen when emotions start to boil over. ¢Ü Lady peaceful ¢Ü ¢Ü lady happy ¢Ü ¢Ü that's what I long to be... ¢Ü ¢Ü all the odds are ¢Ü ¢Ü they're in my favor ¢Ü ¢Ü Something's bound to begin ¢Ü ¢Ü It's gotta happen ¢Ü ¢Ü happen sometime ¢Ü ¢Ü maybe this time ¢Ü ¢Ü I'll win ¢Ü Good. All right! Great sound check. Now, before we take our break, I have an important announcement. Many of you have heard of Barry Turk, my agent in New York. - Doesn't he represent Deniro? - That's right. And, drumroll, please. He's going to come and see the show next week on opening night! And he's told me that if he sees good talent, he might sign someone up. It'll be you the agent signs, Nora. You've got that star quality. No, it'll be you. You're the talented one, you're just so real up there. Maybe it'll be both of us. - Oh, hi, Gloria. - Hey, Lyle. Made some brownies for the gang. You've all been working so hard. That's nice of you, thanks. Dennis, I can't imagine life after the play. Without you. We're an amazing team, you know that? Yeah, I do. Being here with you is the only time I'm really happy these days. I should've turned off the speakers as soon as she walked into that booth. But part of me hoped it would explode. And I'd be the one end up with Nora. Gloria made it sound like everything with Dennis was solid. No way. That woman was furious. I thought she'd kill him then and there. - Did you see her again? - Yeah. Uh, backstage, opening night. She was upset and looking for Dennis. ¢Ü Isn't that long a stay ¢Ü ¢Ü life is a Cabaret ¢Ü What is your problem with musicals? When was your wedding going to be, Gloria? - We hadn't decided. - Huh. Most of my girlfriends pick a place soon as they know they're getting hitched. Unless there's trouble, like their fiance's in love with someone else. Gloria, we know you were upset and that you went backstage before the show. I never even found him. Saw that Nora first and left. Ask any of my family. They were all there for the big show. We can't help if you don't tell us the truth about your relationship. I loved Dennis. But once those rehearsals started, I faded into the background to him. Well, why didn't you tell us, Gloria? I didn't tell anybody. We were engaged for five years while everyone here called me a fool and I kept waiting for him to commit. How could I admit to anyone that it never would have happened? ¢Ü How the world can change ¢Ü ¢Ü it can change like that ¢Ü ¢Ü due to one little word ¢Ü All I could think about the whole shift was the opening tonight. Almost ran a couple of curbs. I have a meeting with the director today so I should leave soon. Is your girlfriend gonna be there? What? I heard you the other night with that actress. I know something's going on. Nothing happened between me and Nora, I swear! But you want it to, don't you? I love you, Gloria, I really do. But I'm just a little confused right now. Obviously. I don't want to hurt you, but I need some time to think about all this stuff. Remember when I first got this job? I was gonna save money and travel, maybe. Go to Australia. Of course I remember. But I never did. I never did anything except drive a cab. We can travel, if that's what you want. No, I'm just saying... I haven't made much of myself, and this meeting with the director, I know it's supposed to be a secret, but I really think that it could make my future a whole lot brighter. Brighter. I don't understand, Denny. I thought we had a really good life together. Were things really so dark before? I just... I know I've been a disappointment. I just don't want to be that anymore. You were never a disappointment to me. I guess you never really know anyone all the way. What was the secret meeting with the director, day of the show? All Dennis said was that it was with Rafe's bigwig agent and Nora. So I got angry again. That was the last time we spoke. So what was this meeting with Dennis before the show? Since you left that out before, maybe you can fill us in now. I didn't think it was important. It was simply so Dennis could meet my agent, Barry Turk. Our problem is, we called Barry Turk. Got his client list. You're not on it. I was once. But Barry hadn't returned my phone call in six years. So you lied to Dennis and Nora. Not exactly. I mean, I'd left another damn message for his assistant. - I was really hoping he'd show. - Well, he didn't. I couldn't tell my actors that I'd slipped to the "B" list. I needed to build myself up in their eyes. - For your own ego? - Absolutely not! Maybe you're right. Maybe it was for my own ego. Whatever it was, I'm afraid it may have cost Dennis dearly. Barry Turk got stuck in New York. Missed the train. But he'll jump a later one. So he'll make the show tonight, be able to see me and Dennis perform. - Of course. - Are you sure? Look, what's important for you two to keep in mind is that tonight's performance could decide someone's future. - God, I'm nervous. - You should be. The truth is, I have a lot of say over who Barry chooses to represent. He must really respect your opinion. He does. And he likes to keep a short client list. Only one new client a year. - One client? - That's right. Well, it should definitely be you, Nora. You're truly gifted. You're right, Dennis. Rafe, Dennis is 35. I'm just 25. I'm the one with a real chance to make it in the business. I'm the real talent here. You know I would work the hardest for it. I am committed to going all the way no matter what it takes. What was I thinking? I... I almost ruined my life because of you! I thought a little healthy competition would be good for them. I didn't think Nora would be so consumed by it all. Consumed enough you think she'd kill him? Make sure she got the agent? She made it quite clear she was going to be a star. No matter what it took. So Nora wanted the spotlight. The question is, was she desperate enough to kill for it? We've been going through the play mementos Rafe gave us. He told us Dennis Rushed to a copy place before the show, - and we found out why. - Cabaret program. A manager there told us they were about to run it off and Dennis stopped them. Wanted to change his notes. / Notes? Each actor has a place  where they can write personal stuff to their family and friends. "Gloria, I'm sorry if I lost my way in the dark." "You are the only star that can make my future brighter." - "Let's set a date." - Since the show never went on, Gloria never saw the program - or knew Dennis had come around. - Clinton. I, uh, I got something I think you people need to hear. Go ahead. I didn't say anything before because I... I knew you'd believe her over me. But now I got proof. Clint, this is Nora. I know the police have been talking to you, and if you tell them what I did that night, you will be very, very sorry. See? Always bet on the dame. Your friend Clinton's in the next room. - He played us your message. - Oh, god. Yeah. You need to tell me what happened, Nora. I'm such an idiot. Why am I such an idiot? Don't know. But you better start explaining. I didn't want Clinton to say anything because my career is really about to take off. And getting convicted of murder might get in the way? I did not kill Dennis. I'm innocent! Hey, this ain't a performance, Nora. This is real life, and you're in real trouble. Okay. Okay. I was young and insecure, and I let my emotions get the best of me. ¢Ü I met this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü ¢Ü and she skillfully managed to talk her way into my room ¢Ü / Oh, Cliff! ¢Ü I've got a terrible feeling I've said a dumb thing ¢Ü ¢Ü besides I've only got one narrow bed ¢Ü ¢Ü We'll think of something ¢Ü You can't be mad at me forever, Dennis. I'm just committed, totally. That's why I'll bet you'll be a star. I'll be driving my cab. This was fun. But I don't think I like shutting off my memory, living in the now. You forget too much. Hey, they're looking for you guys in costumes. I'm gonna get ready. Man, I'm kind of nervous. I don't blame you. Rafe told me Barry Turk wants to walk out of here with some new clients. / Cool. - I think you are so talented. - Thank you. But I'm afraid Dennis has a better shot. He's just... more commercial, you know? Well, we'll see, I guess. But why take that chance? If we mess Dennis up, the agent can focus on you and me instead. What do you mean, mess him up? Look, I know about your background, okay? The jail time, the gangs. It's all cool with me. If you put on a ski mask, which they have in the costume room, by the way, and wait outside until Dennis goes for his cigarette break... / A ski mask? Just listen, okay? You could pretend to be a robber, take his wallet, scare the hell out of him. You could use the director's gun! I saw that he keeps it in his office drawer. You want me to shoot Dennis? Of course not. I just want you to rattle him up so he's a wreck onstage. Then you and I can shine, blow that Barry Turk away. You are out of your mind. Nobody gets hurt, and we'll go to the next level. What's crazy about that? You know... a couple of months ago, I would have done it. You know that? Because I would have believed that that was all I was good for. But not anymore. And if I ever get an agent, it's gonna be because I put on one hell of show. After what Clinton said, I realized I was acting like a lunatic. Your plan is exactly how it went down. - It's a heck of a coincidence. - I know. Why do you think I didn't want Clinton to talk? I knew how guilty it made me look. But I swear on my life, I did not hurt Dennis. One of them must have done it. It's too detailed a plan. Unless someone overheard it. I'm glad to help, but I'm pretty sure I told you guys everything I know already. I don't think so, Lyle. No? No. We know you were in that booth for sound check, that you could hear everything onstage. You heard Nora's plan the night of the show, and you went through with it, didn't you? Her plan? I have no idea what you're talking about. The actors are given a chance to "get onstage, realize a dream." Your words. / That your dream, Lyle? To be onstage? Come on. I love playing music. But the music isn't what people clap for at the end of the show, is it? That's because they're morons. Now, I think you're a lot like Dennis, watching life pass you by, dreaming of a spotlight. But Dennis was brave. He got up his nerve, went out there and auditioned. - You were too scared. - That why you killed him? Or did you kill him just because you knew he was better than you? Better than me? I don't think so. Oh, pretty easy to sit  on the sidelines, judging. But you know what? I don't think you could've hacked it under those bright lights. You're wrong! If I'd gotten onstage that night with Barry Turk in the front row, everyone would've been blown away! - But you were never gonna get onstage. - Wrong again! With Dennis gone, I was the only one who could go on in his place. I knew every word of that show! You killed him and thought the curtain would still go up? I was just gonna hit him in the leg, send him to the hospital. It isn't fair they canceled the show! Whatever happened to "the show must go on"? I knew every word. Every word. You don't believe me? There was a Cabaret and there was a master-of-ceremonies and there was a city called Berlin in a country called Germany. It was the end of the world. And I was dancing with Sally Bowles and we were both fast asleep. ¢Ü The sun on the meadow is summery warm ¢Ü ¢Ü the stag in the forest runs free ¢Ü ¢Ü but gather together to greet the storm ¢Ü ¢Ü tomorrow belongs to me ¢Ü Give me all your money. Lyle, that's the worst fake voice I ever heard. What are you up to? You think I'm a joke, huh? You think you're better than me, huh? Let's go inside, okay? It's almost time. No, my time! Not yours. You've had enough. Look, all I want to do is put on a good show and go home to my fiancee. This is my home! It's all I have! And this! is going to be my show. For once, I'm gonna be the one that gets to shine!
