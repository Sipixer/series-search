Step right up ! Step right up, boys and girls of all ages for the final act of our big top extravaganza ! Let's hear it one more time for Zelda, Queen of Knives ! And now, City of Brotherly Love, birthplace of the American circus, let me introduce to you our headliner, the Human Butterfly, Mia Romanov and her magical metamorphosis ! Well, boss, you wanted to see me ? Sit down. Moe kitchener. - What about him ? - He got shot last night, outside a bar over in Roxborough. - You're serious ? - Large caliber slug, Back of the head. So... he's dead ? Where were you last night, Lil ? Home. I was finishing up a report. You're going to need someone to confirm that. Who the investigating detective ? Doherty wants the state police to handle it. They're gonna want to talk to you. You all right ? I don't know. Listen, I told the boss if anyone wants to know, you were home when I dropped off that file last night. - The file...? - Yeah. Rodriguez file, '06. No way you could've been across town when Moe caught one outside that bar. Yeah. Thanks. Listen, I got a lady waiting on a case. I'll handle it. I want to... keep working. Detectives Valens. Rush. You got something on an old Homicide, Miss Deluca ? Mia Romanov. An aerialist for the Jones brothers circus. The circus ? Her death was ruled an accidental fall in 1971. You're saying it wasn't ? Mia did a silk act where she came out of a cocoon high above the rafters. I knew something was wrong the moment she came out. This a bad time ? What ? No. You were there the night of her fall ? My mother worked at Jones brothers circus. She was a fortune-teller. I'm a psychic. Always felt Mia's "accident" was anything but. Then just tell us who you "feel" killed her, and we'll clear this up by lunchtime. Doesn't work that way. Yeah, it never does. Always wondered how Mia could've fallen. And then I found these at an exhibit, "Death under the big top." Photographs of various tragic falls, including Mia's. You can see how the other performers braced for impact. - Mia didn't. - Fell head first. Arms limp, hands at her side. Might've been unconscious. Or already dead. You think that her fall was some kind of cover-up ? Mia grew up in the circus. Had the agility of a cat. Something wasn't right. I felt it. Yeah, we got that. We'll be in touch, Isabel. Your mother will be fine. You... I'm not so sure. Cold Case Season 7 Episode Metamorphosis Mia Romanov, 18. Died in St. Mary's fairgrounds in '71, ruled accidental. More like inevitable. Flying through the air on nothing but silk ? Not much here by the way of statements. Well, getting circus folk to talk isn't easy. Finally got warrants, you're looking at an empty lot. Assigned spoke to a few audience members. Said Mia looked fine giving her pre-act bow. So whatever happened to her, happened backstage. It's got the stink of sabotage all over it. A/v blew up the picture of Mia's fall. ME said the shadow around her nose and mouth - could be blood. - Before impact. Autopsy report : Broken neck, shattered skull... Thought to have been caused by the fall, but hands and wrists only suffered minor damage. She didn't brace for impact. Survival instinct never kicked in. Run all the performers for priors, anything else we can dig up on this big top. Mia was legally adopted by Sheldon Burgess, aka Cleo the clown. Never gave a statement. Got an address over in Point Breeze. Well, go talk to this clown. Mr. Burgess ? Welcome to Cleo's fun house. What can I do for you ? Homicide. We're looking into the death of Mia Romanov. Mia ? All these years later ? What can you tell us about her fall ? She was trying a new stunt. It's the worst night of my life. How come you didn't give a statement, Mr. Burgess ? I climbed deep into a bottle that night. Stayed there for a long time after. It never crossed your mind that maybe it wasn't an accident ? Silks weren't cut or frayed. Thought the moment got the best of her. So who was in charge of sending up her cocoon ? Gaucho, day players, in and out. But Mia did her own rigging. She was stubborn, like her father. Her father ? The Romanovs have been kicking the sawdust For five generations. They were royalty amongst us kinkers. And mia was like her folks: More comfortable in the air than on terra firma. How does a clown in a traveling circus adopt a little girl ? I was her godfather. Her parents willed her to me, but the circus raised her. Jones brothers was a one-ring mud show, but we were family. - Anyone backstage with her ? - The act before hers, Zelda "the queen of knives" panay. Zelda and Mia get on all right ? Oh, sure. Long as zelda was the headliner. What the hell was that tonight ? Williamsport ? Used to pack 'em to the stingers. Now, we're lucky to be making horse feed out there. You still getting paid, Cleo ? This dog and pony show is dying, Biggie. - We need an aerial act. - Can't afford one. Unless you got one in that wig of yours. No way a knife-thrower can carry the big top. - Excuse me ? - No offense, zelda. - I've been... - Stop it. Everybody, please, just... I ca... I can give us an aerial act. Mia, I didn't mean you should... I can fly. It's in my blood. She's a baby. Well, what do we got to lose? Even a baby can see we're dying. I'll talk to management. Start putting it together, kid. - I don't know, Mia. - It's going to be fine, cleo. Accidents happen. Zelda P-A-N-A-Y... Was the headliner prior to Mia ? Yeah, ever since the last aerial act walked. I didn't want Mia up there. Hate to think I put a target on her. Sounds like zelda wasn't ready to put her knives away. - Thanks for coming in. - Well, if I'd known you were so handsome, I would've sprinted all the way from Atlantic City. I don't mean to be rude, but can we get going on this, because... I got a show, at 6:00. - Still performing ? - Yeah, well, it's mostly blue plate dinners for seniors. But they remember me from the Ed Sullivan Show. How did you and Mia romanov get along ? Mia Romanov ? Fine. I took her under my wing. She was like my sister. You always throw daggers at family ? Darling... even a lady loses her cool sometimes, Which accounts for three out of four of my divorces. Foolish. Jealous. Jealous enough to get rid of her ? What do you mean ? She fell. I was there. With her backstage before her act. Your "sister" ends up dead And you get to keep your spotlight. Now, I got my pride. But I'm not stupid. We needed mia's act to work. It was all over, for all of us. "Waiting for the sun" by The Doors.</i> - Where's the trapeze bar ? - Forget the trapeze. Biggie, we need something new. We need dramatic. You'll never be ready in a week Trying to get a new act together. Just do what your folks taught you. I need a theme. To tell a story. - I need some time. - You're not a clown anymore. It's not about stories. It's about wowing them. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. There's something Groovy with the silks- the freedom it gives me... People don't want groovy. They want tradition. For their kids to see and feel what they did. Maybe we can start a new one. You know, we can capture their imagination. Great. Then imagine there's no circus when we get shut down waiting for you to get your act together. Now this is all on me ? You asked for a shot, kid, and I gave it to you. Convinced management to roll the dice. - Don't hang me out to dry. - No, I'll do the silk act. I'll use a mechanic if I have to. The advance men have been pumping your act as death-defying. - But I... - But nothing ! I took a flyer on you. You'd better not make a fool of me. Mia was way ahead of the curve. She was cirque du soleil before they were. Now everybody's got a silk act. What about David and Goliath ? Ringmaster Biggie Jones and his goon, Lester "Gargantuan" Smith. Biggie pushed us hard. Maybe pushed Mia too hard. That's probably why he pulled up stakes so fast and left town that night. You see Biggie backstage with Mia before her fall ? Biggie always checked on the featured acts before they went on. Have information that you called in the 10-37 last week. DUI check on Mr. Kitchener ? That's right. Outside the same bar that he was murdered ? - The suspect was inebriated. - Suspect was awaiting trial. And what were you doing observing him in the first place ? It was a continuing investigation. He had already filed a complaint against you. Which was completely bogus, same as this. Were you outside that bar last night, detective ? No. You testified Moe kitchener tried to kill you. You believe that. So does the commonwealth. Maybe you should talk to the da. Said you were home last night between the hours of 9:25 And 10:10? That's right. Anyone who can confirm that ? My partner, Scotty Valens. He came by, dropped off some paperwork on a case I was reviewing. What case ? Cesar Rodriguez. The file's on my desk. Bunch of gink squad bs. I need you to surrender - Your service weapon. - What ? Until this thing blows over, you're on restricted duty. Mia Romanov. A real tragedy, that one. Understand you checked on your acts - before they hit the stage. - So how'd she look - before going out ? - Ready to fly. - Girl was good to go. - You're saying She looked good, Biggie, - Ready to fly ? - You whizzing on the wrong hydrant there, kemosabe. I needed that girl. Without her act I lost my main moneymaker, lost the midway. Lost that, Lost the circus. Then why the cover-up ? You pulled up stakes before sunup, hit the road. Now, hold your horses. We had a long haul the next day to Allentown. The show must go on, huh? Well, we was feeding a lot of people. My family survived the ten-in-one to turn around and own this circus. Ten-in-ones ? Ten freaks in one tent. It was humiliating. For three generations we fought off larger predatory circuses. Ringling. And you banked everything on Mia, but she crossed you up. We were family. Wouldn't sell. Loyal. We circled the tents around Mia. But Mia stepped out of line, made her own act, didn't she ? She make a fool out of you, Biggie ? Wrong. I was on board with her act. Hell, I had to be; times was desperate. I helped her set the whole thing up. You heard of knocking ? Peace offering. Thought about what you said-- Wanting a story for your act. How about this ? Silk worm goes up into her cocoon To emerge as the human butterfly. Call it the metamorphosis. "Love her madly" by The Doors. I don't know what to say. Biggie, that's... perfect. So are you, kid. We're all behind you here. You're the best we got. I'll be ready for philly. And no mechanic or safety harness. Knock 'em dead, kid. I got an act, lester. I'm the human butterfly. Management had Them tack spitters wallpaper the town with that bill. She was our homegrown star. And who was management ? J.B. Ricketts investment. Bunch of suits out of Florida, helped us through the lean years. Got a number ? No, ma'am, that was a long time ago. What about this Paul Bunyan ? - He have a thing for Mia ? - Gargantuan ? I don't think he was wired that way. His feelings were simple, childlike. With big boy plumbing. That's reassuring. - Some kind of condition ? - Cerebral gigantism. Made him huge. Also made him about as sharp as a bowling ball. So what beanstalk is he up right now ? I haven't seen him in years. He's probably dead. Giants don't last too long. Heart can't take it. Excuse me, I'd like to talk to a detective Rush. Mr. Butler. What can I do for you ? I want to make a statement. Would you like a lawyer present, Mr. Butler ? I would not. I recommend you get one, Hank. All you've been through. My wife doesn't eat anymore. She doesn't sleep. She just cries. Do you want to tell us what happened, Hank ? When I saw him at the courthouse, I knew. Moe Kitchener ? Ten, 20 years... didn't matter. It wouldn't go away. I couldn't go on thinking that that smug son of a bitch was walking the earth. Someone had to put that dog down. Hank. - Listen, Hank, I didn't kill your daughter. - Shut up. You buried her in a box. You'd have let me twist forever. Sorry, Hank. It wasn't personal. I'm sorry, too. I went home. I thought I'd feel better. Katie's gone. Nothing's ever going to change that. What do you want ? What do you want ? Leave me alone. You hear me ?! I seen you standing here. I'm a cop. I'm sorry. Police. I didn't know ! I didn't know ! I didn't know ! People paint on my wall, break my windows... I thought you was one of 'em. Gonna hurt me. You thought I was gonna hurt you, Gargantua ? Lot of performers at Jones brothers had priors, Lester. You're the only one with a history of violence. In and out of institutions as a kid. Beat a grown man within an inch of his life at the age of 13. He attacked me, 'cause I was big. What about Mia Romanov ? Yeah, you... remember her, right ? Yes. Mia. You liked her ? Pretty. Soft. She smelled nice. She just wasn't into the whole beauty and the beast thing. So you squeezed her too hard, like you did to me. No ! Mia was special. - "special" ? - Friend. She was my friend. I could never hurt her. Well, someone did hHurt your friend, Lester. Someone backstage. And then they dropped her from the ceiling. There was this gaucho. "Wild child" by The Doors. Hey. - Eddie, right ? - That's right, darlin'. I haven't checked my rig yet. It's looking fine to me. Get rid of that Karabiner and mount it on a swivel. Karabiner's twice as strong as a swivel. What do I look like, some first of may ? That swivel's going to let me get out over the audience. Now, lose the Karabiner. Looks like you're calling the shots around here, huh, kid? How long you been doing this, Eddie ? Ten years experience. Rigged every big rock and roll show from Vancouver to Miami. Then you should know a performer needs to check their rig before it's flown. How old are you, sweet cheeks ? - Old enough. Are you hopped up, Eddie ? I'm the one 50 feet in the air. You gonna be on that junk, you can stay away from me and my rig. I want you out of my tent. Now ! Get out. Or I'll have you dragged out. All right, look. Easy, big fella, easy. All right, I dig it. If that's what the little lady wants. Now that would hurt. Eddie wasn't one of us. Not circus folk. He poisoned her. You mean with drugs ? Was he selling to the crew ? This rigger, He responsible for putting mia's cocoon in the air? Till she kicked him out of the big top. They made him shovel after the elephants. Eddie left after Mia... fell. I went to Jones. The bartender said you took Nick home. Yeah. He was plastered by the time I got there. Something's up with him. Lot of that going around. Still thirsty ? I heard about your dance with Gargantuan. Had him right where I wanted him. Yeah. You ring him up for assault ? Guy belongs in the puzzle house, not county. Punks were harassing him. Tagged "freak" on his building. Cruel world. I filed three separate police reports. He was just protecting himself. - I'm sorry I wasn't there. - Almost... Lit him up, Lil. Wanted to. Thanks for... having my back. With Moe. The alibi. Partners, right ? Yeah. I still can't believe it. What hank did. Just beat you to it. So what does that make me ? Human. - Protect and serve, right ? - The innocent. Lil. Need more Hanks out there. The guy deserves a medal. You believe that ? Yeah. Yeah, I believe that. Just be glad someone else did it. That he's gone. The fortune-teller said something about your mom. She okay ? Time comes, Lil... I might need you to have my back, too. Partners, right ? - Thought I was invisible. - So did we, till we found your name in a Jones brothers payroll. Quite a healthy rap sheet you got there, Eddie. Mama always said I had a little bit of the devil in me. Sure she's real proud: Drugs, cons, kiting checks... Youthful indiscretions, detectives. Made a few mistakes. Is she one of those indiscretions ? You might say that. But she was far from a mistake. Destroying Mia's rig, Threatening her in front of witnesses... - those aren't mistakes ? - Wait a second. I didn't even work the big top. I know. She had you kicked out. Had you shoveling pachyderm pies. Cost you money, not to mention your pride. About to narc you out. But you weren't looking to do jail time, - so you did her instead. - You got me. Guilty as charged. If you call love a crime. Love ? Anyone could see that that girl was a bud about to bloom. All she needed was a double dose of Eddie. I might just hit you on principle. Seem to have that effect on women. The other side of desire. That young lady was bursting with it. "Riders on the storm" by The Doors.</i> Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. I've been shoveling crap my whole life. So don't lose any sleep over me, okay ? I'm just under a lot of pressure and I could've handled it better. I heard about your folks. It takes a lot of guts doing what you're doing. Well, I don't really know what else to do. I mean... family needs me. I guess you had to grow up a little fast around here. So maybe, you and I aren't so different after all. Sounds like you've been around quite a bit. What about you ? I never heard of a circus that didn't travel. I've been to a bunch of places, but I never get to leave the lot. Never ? Once. When I was a little girl, my mom took me down to bourbon street. New Orleans. There was one of those jazz funerals. Something eerie about it, but... It was beautiful. We should go out tonight. I'm not sure cleo would like that. Not all adventures are out there. You should come with me. Where ? Anywhere but this stick and rag show. You're 18. - You can do anything you want. - Mia ! Giving it up to some gaucho ! Have you lost your mind ?! - Come on ! - No ! - Get out. Come with me ! - Wait... Cleo ! No ! Come on ! I felt bad for Mia. If you ask me, there was something weird was going on between those two. You know, she was 18 and they were still sharing a boxcar. - Sketchy. - Sketchier - than an alcoholic clown ? - Next day, She had a busted lip, Compliments of Cleo. You painted a pretty picture of mia, cleo. But, uh, but she wasn't such an angel, now, was she ? Droppin' acid, doing riggers... Then there's you. Me ?! What the hell's that supposed to mean ? Keeping tight quarters with a teenage girl All those years... Used to having her - by your side. - What are you saying ? Take a seat. I slept on the floor. I would never, ever do what you're suggesting. Mia was my daughter. She was not blood. Was to me ! Maybe I was strict and overprotective, but that place was swarming with snakes. Like Eddie Armstrong ? Damn straight. Combed the lot, found her tripping with that... fink trying to get in her pants. I just snapped. Oh, busted her lip trying to show her who's boss. No ! Never laid a hand on her. She was so out of it, kept falling. I watched her all night till she finally - Came down. - Always there to catch her, huh ? Not always. But I tried. But you couldn't let go. And all you had was her and that bottle. She was becoming a woman. You were losing her. Holding her back so much that... You were suffocating her. No, you're wrong. Loved her so much, I wanted her to go. She needed to get away from that place. From me. "Moonlight drive" by The Doors. For Mia Romanov and her amazing metamorphosis ! You were... beautiful ! You looked just like your mother up there. - You liked it ? - I've seen the future, and you're it, kiddo. Your act is too good for this top. What are you talking about? This is exactly what we need. You heard the crowd. This will save us. This place is dying. You don't need to die with it. But this is my family. Cleo, I'm not going anywhere. You know how... when a circus elephant is born, the bull handler will secure it with a thin rope Tied to a skinny stick in the ground? Sure, and when that elephant grows up, that rope and skinny stick can still make him stay put. That stick can't hold you anymore. Are you calling me an elephant? I wish she'd listened to me, but it was already too late. She fell the next night. Buried her in the Romanov family plot. A few days later, I was back on the sawdust in Allentown. A few days? Thought the circus Was due in allentown The night after the accident? Don't know who told you that. No, we had a week between stops. Got the route card to prove it. Losing track of all your lies, Biggie. Told us you were due in Allentown when you had a week between gigs. We had to wildcat it out of there after Mia's nosedive. Especially since you had a murder scene to tear down. Come on, who's going to take their kiddies to see us after a fall like that ? Thought with a little extra time, we could drum up some business in Allentown. I know what it looks like, - but it was a business decision. - You weren't the only one Making business decisions. Found out Ringling Brothers wanted Mia. Ringling-- they tried to poach everyone. After everything your family had done for her. Raising Mia as one of their own. Knew if you lost her, it was all over. But Mia wouldn't fall in line. Left a little man with a big temper holding the bag. And when it's all said and done, Mia ends up eating sawdust. Come on, you guys. Do I look like I could hurt anyone ? Spoke to Biggie, Lester. Remember him ? Yes. Biggie. Well, he says you killed Mia. Me ? Biggie couldn't have killed Mia. Couldn't have lifted her up into that cocoon. I'm thinking he forced you to do it, Lester. Like he always forced you. You don't have to be scared of Biggie anymore. He can't hurt you. No, you got it wrong ! You put yourself At the scene, Biggie. Said she was "good to go." Mia was dead. You got Lester to stuff her into silks just - to cover it up. - I'd done some things I had to do. But I did not kill Mia. If you could please find it in your heart to donate</i> again to help orphaned children get a chance</i> to see the human butterfly. In return, for helping make these children's dreams come true,</i> your company name will be featured in our special program. Hey, Mia. - What are you doing here ? - This makes no sense. It says we've sold 800 tickets. The top only sits 400. - What are you doing, Biggie ? - All right, everyone. Scram. Listen, sweetheart, to make sure that the show can go on, - I've had to be a little creative. - We're not affiliated with any charity, but you're selling tickets in their name. Where were these kids in the stands ? It's a write-off to local businesses. It's one thing to rip people off on the midway, But you're going to use my act to scam - charities for orphans ? - What do you care ? You'll be flying under the ringling top soon. What ? That's right. I know all about it. I can't believe you, Biggie. I was going to tell them "no. " but now? Once I told management, it was out of my hands. Management, huh ? Controlled the whole thing. And just who was this management ? - Bunch of suits out of florida. - You see, that's a crock. The SEC has no record of J.B. Ricketts investments. But Wikipedia does. J.B. Ricketts founded the American circus. Died in 1799. There was no management. It was you. No. If it were just that simple. You were diagnosed with is it cerebral gigantism ? It's a pretty rare disorder. Often accompanied with diminished Mental capacity. The d.A.'s willing to cut a deal for you. We don't want to send you to county, so you tell us what happened and we'll make sure you go to a comfortable medical facility. Oh, yeah, they'll get you squared away. In a year or two, you're a handyman in Reading again. Help us put biggie away for good. Biggie was a... a monster. He... he... he made me. This lifeline, Those meds-- Pretty expensive. I didn't know The circus had such great benefits. So, we decided to check. Turns out they don't. Your medicine is paid for by a private company. Same company pays your rent. - You don't get it, do you ? - No, I get it. And you're going to prison, and there's no ppo in the pokie. A guy like you won't last six months. Last time, big. Who was management ? "he made me." Man, I hope we got that on video. Submit it to the academy. See, the thing is, people with cerebral gigantism, Although usually bigger as children, Are often in the normal height range as adults. Far from normal, gargantuan. That country doctor misdiagnosed you. You don't have cerebral gigantism. You're just big. No, but you ain't no dummy. See, I wanted to talk to your boss. Went to the city tax assessors To see who owns that building you maintain. Found out, it's you. You own it. Along with half a dozen others. Big top, incorporated. Same company that pays Biggie's bill. You were management. Me ? Biggie's confession. I'd give it to you in picture form, But we know you weren't hit with the idiot stick. In fact, you're a millionaire. Now, Biggie told us how his circus was dying Till you took it over. You weren't his puppet. He was yours. Seen that fear in your eyes all my life. But when those cake eaters would step into ten-in-one... looking at me. Laughing. Pointing. They thought I was on exhibit. But I was studying them. So you concocted A scam to get back at them. Steal their money. Prove you were smarter. No. It was about preserving our family. Our livelihoods. The one place where no one would treat me like a freak. But Mia busted you on your scam. Wouldn't take part. We could've moved on. Gone back to the family we were. I couldn't just... sit by And have her tear us apart. Wanted to wish you a good show, kid. But Mia, what you saw, Those phone calls, will never happen again, mia. We'll sell out with your act and some old-fashioned bally. Family again. No blood, no foul. You expect me to trust you ? - You're a con. - Mia, listen... You know what a con man hates most ? People knowing the truth. Look, there's no need to get the cops involved. I'm a kinker. No cops. After the show, I'm telling the family the truth. Mia! Don't be a fool. Let them make their own decisions, Biggie. I've already made mine. Now, I gotta fly.
