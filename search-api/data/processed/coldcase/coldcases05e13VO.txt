a piece of advice. I'd feel really selfish if I didn't share it. Okay. You're supposed to picture 'em naked when you're on the stand. If you're nervous. Oh. I would, but, um, it's my dad, so... Yeah, okay... Right. I'm Truitt, by the way. Tamyra. Everyone calls me Spider. Well, the world would be taken over by mosquitoes and flies if it weren't for spiders, so... Good point. Did he do that? How did you know that? I don't even know you, but... that makes me really want to kick someone's ass on your behalf. Thanks. So, why are you here? Someone said I did something I didn't do. Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry. So, listen, if things go well today and-and I'm a free man and the criminal justice system doesn't fail me... do you want to hang out? Tamyra? They're ready for you. You're gonna be great. Be strong. Yes! Let's hang out. My name and info's on a sticker inside the front cover, and... it was nice meeting you. Maybe it was good luck or something. Hey! Hey. What, are you guys leaving for a long lunch? We know you? Kate Carley. Lawyer for DHS. You guys dcold jobs, right? Yeah. Detectives Rush, Miller. So back in '98, I represented a teenager named Tamyra Borden, who was suing her piece-of-scum father for emancipation. Scum like how? Drunk. Good old Sly liked to beat his little girl, put out his cigarettes on her. So I lose. Jerk judge said daughter's testimony wasn't evidence enough of abuse. Three months later Tamyra was killed. Skull crushed in. They put the dad away? No, they did not. And now, dad's brought up on charges for his stepdaughter. Beating her, too? Three-year-old's in a coma. I've been talking to the assigned DA. Doing some research, this is what I find. What is it? Social Security checks for Tamyra Borden 'cause her mother's dead. Checks were stolen and cashed by dear old Dad for six months after her death, until Uncle Sam stopped sending them. We'll look into it. I was just outta law school. Me and her could've shared a wardrobe, ya know? Case got away from me. Got it. Just get the guy, so I can live with myself. ??? ??? the Kensington and Allegheny overpass, August '98. Well, blunt-force trauma to the skull's what killed her. ME speculates a hammer's the murder weapon. Original theory was, neighborhood like that, Tamyra's looking for drugs, turning tricks, maybe. Interviewed family, neighbors. No one knew what she was doing that day, who she might've been with. What about friends? None in here. Sounds like Tamyra was a loner. Mother died in Vegas in '92. She and her dad were split by then. Sly Borden- three counts of public intoxication. Second conviction for drunk driving in '01. He said he hadn't seen Tamyra in a week before she died. New info on the Social Security checks, maybe her dad'll be more cooperative. Why is it that I'm in a crap cell with no cable hookup? Ain't that the way? Beat your baby girl half to death and get treated like a scumbag. Don't come at me with that bullcrap. You ever heard of "innocent until guilty"? We're here to talk about Tamyra. Where were you the night she was killed? In the privacy of my own home, sleepin' off a bad day. I had no idea my little girl was gettin' murdered. And you were just crippled with grief when you spent her Social Security checks at the track. I was just trying to get by. Tamyra woulda wanted that. The daughter you physically abused? I'll bet she hated your guts. That why you finished her off, Sly? Couldn't stand the way she looked at you? I hadn't seen the girl in a week when I heard she died. And by the way, now she is dead, everybody talks like she's some angel. You got another version? Took after her mother. Kind of a ho. That's nice of you. I'm sayin' it wasn't me that got her into trouble. It was herself and her ho-ish habits. Dinner's ready. Don't yell. Here, Dad. Dinner. You can just set it on your lap. So... when you were little and Grandpa Ed had the department store, where was that? I don't know. Downtown. I told you this a million times. Did you ever work there? No. By the time I was old enough to get a job, the store was closing. No customers. Sorry. Sorry?! We went from being "Hello, Mr. Borden" to havin' our hand out like the Mexican bums that took over our neighborhood, and there was nothin' that I could do to get us back on top. Just... Okay, Dad. You just... love bringing up stuff like this. I'm a failure?! I'm sorry. You're the failure. What do you do around here, anyway? Huh? Nothing. Like a mouse. You're out? Go sit down on the couch. Who the hell are you? I said sit down on the couch, 'cause her and I are gonna walk out of here and you're just gonna watch us leave, okay, old man? Tamyra, go wait outside. Spider? It's okay. Wait outside. If you ever try to see her again, I'll make sure you fall down those stairs and don't get up. Last time I saw her. Good riddance. Spider? What's his real name? Hell if I know. But Tamyra was writing letters to some prisoner- number blah-blah-blah- for a few months before he graced us with his visit. And you keep this in for ten years? Certain people could view me in a bad light after that story. You get a look at where he was locked up with those letters? No. You see his car that night? Oh, yeah. Jerk drove a Nissan Altima. That was Tamyra's slap in my face. Havin' a boyfriend with a Jap car. Uh-huh. Can't really say you dug yourself out here, Sly. But thanks for seeing us. We'll be sure to stop by again. Who's the clown? Never seen him before. Friend of yours? That's the problem with this job. People know where you work. Who is he? Deadbeat from my undercover days. Ex-banger, dealer, just got outta prison. Came looking for a second date? Kidding. You don't date. Don't think you know so much more about things than I do. That woman just tolerates you. Toni can handle a real man. Not every woman can. We got a list from DMV- who owned a '94 Nissan Altima in '98. Don't suppose any of 'em put down Spider as their first name? No, but one guy might fit the bill. Lil and Scotty are with him now. No, I'm not Spider. That guy's real name is Truitt Leland. And he drove a car registered to you the night he went to Tamyra Borden's house? He used to borrow my car, yes. I used to hang out with him when I was young and stupid. You don't keep up? Have you met him? The moment I graduated from angry young man-dom, I stopped spending time with him. What do you know about Tamyra? She dated Spider. Stayed at his mom's house with us for a few weeks. Look, do I need a lawyer? I swear, I'm nothing like that guy. Why are you protesting so much, Elliot? God knows what he's done that I don't want to be associated with. He have anything to do with Tamyra's death? When did she die? I mean, she stopped coming around, but I just figured... What? That it was because of what was going on with us... with Spider. Which was what, Elliot? Look, my parents had a bad divorce and I had "dad" issues, which made me vulnerable to Spider. Again... stupid kid. Truitt wrote me all these letters, and I don't know. It was nice to get something in the mail. My mom- she used to send postcards or whatever, but... Yeah, Truitt's a good writer. That's my son. And he can talk his way out of anything, too. Hope he warned you we're boring over here. We don't drink or smoke or anything. No, that's great. Want some milk? Okay. Tamyra, if you ever want a place to stay. We have an extra room. I left my dad, moved in here. We're her orphans. Trust me, there's no better mother. Take this downstairs. It's "No Mom Allowed. " The values that we're taught are important to us, don't mean anything anymore. I mean, go to school. You can't afford college. Work hard. Well, some illegal aliens get my job. Be honest. Go to church. Well, I'd like to. But my preacher and my government are lying to me about what kind of people they really are. But it's not like things have ever been better. Or easier. It's the same old struggles our parents had. What about our grandparents? My grandfather comesack from World War II and goes to any college he wants to on the government. I come back from Kuwait, I'm on my own. Something's gone wrong between that generation and this one. Big time. I think we know what it is. It's the government's liberal agenda. They serve the blacks, the Jews, the Mexicans, and the homosexuals. The white race is under attack. You were skinheads. Like I said, I was lonely and lost, so I hung out with Spider and tolerated all that talk. But he was the true believer. Tamyra's boyfriend was a neo-Nazi and she winds up with her skull bashed in. I wonder if Spider and his steel-toed boots know anything about that. Truitt Leland, summer of '98, he spends two months at the house of corrections for trashing a convenience store. Owned by a Vietnamese couple. Only two months? Court called it vandalism. Not ethnic-motivated. He up to his old tricks? Recent as '06, cops got called to break apart a scuffle at a White Pride rally he organized. No charges pressed. Speaking of which. Guess my invite got lost in the mail. Can I help you? This is a Neighborhood Freedom Coalition meeting. Freedom from what, exactly? Philly PD. We've got a legal right to congregate here. What's your issue? Tamyra Borden. You know anything about her gettin' her head bashed in... Spider? It's Truitt. And no, I don't. Is this your normal potluck accessory... Spider? Again, I've got a legal right, I have a permit. That sets my mind at ease. Neo-Nazi roaming the streets with a concealed weapon. Unbelievable. The bigotry. You should know better than anyone. Just because we're organized and proud of our race doesn't mean we go around committing murder. Tamyra was your girlfriend when she was killed. And you've got a history of violence. What we had was pure and innoct. That girl was an Aryan goddess. Is that a compliment? Oh, so you didn't get slap-happy on her when she decided she wasn't into the swastika thing? What makes you think she wasn't into it? Hey. Hey. Why are you up? I couldn't sleep. Why not? Because I was worried you couldn't sleep. You barely talked to me tonight. Do you believe in, like, the Holocaust? That it was right? No. I'm confused. Why did you talk to me that day at the courthouse? Why did you write to me? You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. That's ridiculous. I hate the way that swastika looks. It's hate. And I just don't think you are like that. The swastika is an ancient symbol for strength. I mean to the sun, good luck. That's everything I want for you. For our people. When my dad lost his job... that's when he started drinking. Who'd he lose it to? An illegal alien, right? Yeah. He just... he felt so useless, you know. I could tell. I just wish things could have been better for him. It doesn't have to be that way. Are you gonna help me? Are you gonna be brave? Why'd Tamyra have to be brave? What did you get her into? Nothing other than defending our beliefs. And how do you do that? We abide by the law. You cops protect us so well, how could we not want to play nice? Nice. You remember prison. How would you like that for the rest of your life? Unless you're going to press charges, I'm not going anywhere with you. You know you have no grounds to do that. Plus, I have a First Amendment right to congregate here and that's what I plan on doing. See ya. Hey, Spider, where'd you get that nickname from? Wouldn't happen to do with the skinhead tattoo you get when you kill a black person, would it? It's 'cause I'm nocturnal. He was taunting us, boss. Jackass thinks he can hide,but he's wrong. These are all the crime reports from the summer of '98. When Spider ask Tamyra to swear her allegiance to him, said he needed her to be brave. These types can't resist staking a claim. There's got to be a signature in there. A week before Tamyra's murder there were broken windows at a temple in South Philly. The same at a mosque. Racist graffiti on an African-American family home-- standard curse word stuff, nothing distinctive. Oh, I've got something. It was flagged as ethnic intimidation 'cause it's a Honduran lady. This car belonged to Nora Mariposa, went missing August 17, 1998. The day before Tamyra was killed. There's graffiti on the door. That a skinhead tag? I've been reading up on the crap these white supremacists use to justify their beliefs. That's real educational. Oh, the Internet's overflowing with stuff. They're everywhere. The one thing they can all agree on is this book The Lightning and The Sun. It's got a loving dedication to Hitler himself. Isn't that sweet? That book's about using violence to cleanse society. And this tag is the lightning and the sun. Nora Mariposa never turned up? But we got a witness. Nora's four-year-old son was in the car. You were four years old,Miguel, when your mother went missing? Yeah. They found me in the car, but I didn't remember anything. You remember this? Did you see someone do this? Sorry. Can we show you some other pictures? Was, uh, this guy there that night? I don't know. Sorry. Him and her. These two? They were there that night? Ponche de goma. Flat tire. Hola, chica. What did they do when they got out of the truck? Miguel? They hurt her. My mother. What are you doing? Remember I told you to be brave? ecesitas ayuda? Si. Gracias. I cannot change tire. You guys gotta get down here. It's going to get explosive. Spider. Your father,a white man, lost his job because people like this are willing to work for nothing! Leeches! Wait.You'll kill her! No. You will. Hey, hey, look at me I know that you're scared, okay? This is what it looks like when you're fighting to get your life back, okay? Trust me. I love you. She shot Nora. ???? So far, none of them match Nora Mariposa. Must have hid the body. Rush and Will are in with the girl. Neck tat girl? She was capable of beating Nora Mariposa to death. Could have done it to Tamyra. Stillman. The not-so-nice lady told you to get lost, homes. I know she did, but she needs to talk to me. How about I talk to you, sport? Man, I just need to see my kid. Your kid? Veronica. My daughter. I got it. I said I got it. I told you... we're done talking about this. I'm not the same person as I was. No drugs, no playing around. I got my act together on the inside. Good for you. She even know about me? What should I say? Dad's in prison. Ex-banger thug? Kat, you act like you're better than me. You forgot how we met? I was doing my job. Oh. That's what you tell yourself, huh? I've made a life for me and her, and it works. We got it down. That's all she needs. You sure about that? I leave Philly in a week. Get away from all the elements. Make sure I stay on track. Before I go... I'd like to meet my daughter. I said no. And don't come back here again or I'll have your sorry ass thrown back in jail. Those your kids screaming like banshees out there? ADD. Yeah. I guess you weren't a diehard skinhead, huh? Love is blind. And another of those kids has got Spider as a dad. So? You can't tell me who to have my babies with. Four years back child support. What is he, ashamed of you guys? He's a frickin' dirtbag is what he is. And after you did everything for him. Helped him kill a woman. Huh Nora Mariposa. We got a witness puts you as coconspirator to murder, beating that woman as she lay on the ground. A witness? That's impossible. It was frickin' pitch-dark. Um... You've just put yourself at the scene of the murder, Lindsay. So, that means you're going away. But I didn't do it. Who did, Lindsay? Was it Tamyra? You've got one option if you want to save yourself, and that's tell us what happened. It's them... or you. Spider trusted Tamyra that night... which was a huge mistake. No. No. Oh, my God. What happened? We killed the bitch. Roadkill. Why? No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Why are you freaking out on me? Why did you do that? Why? Spider... you never said we'd do this. What did I say, Elliot, huh? What did I say?! I said this was war! What do soldiers do?! What do they do, Elliot?! I thought, I thought it was about ideas or the... Ideas? What did you think we were doing? We have to call an ambulance! You stupid bitch. She's dead. How can you be my girl when you're acting like this right now? Stop! Here's an idea. Why don't you help me clean this up? Help me. Teamwork. Give me a T. Wait, I told what you wanted to know. You said it was me or them. We meant you and them. Tell us where Spider is. -With his bitch wife. -They took off. Do you know where Spider might hide out? Can't you give me a break? I was kind of stupid back then. Still are, Lindsay. Think you guys are going in the wrong direction. What? This ain't the swap meet? You're gonna want to put that weapon on the ground, right now. Now! Put your weapon down, sweetheart. What did you do with Nora Mariposa's body? You're going away for life for that, Spider. Don't care. Movement's strong inside. Good. You got somebody to pray for you when you get the needle. No way. Double murder-- Nora and Tamyra. I didn't do Tamyra. She was gonna turn you in. She was a traitor ?? Something had to be done, and you were the guy to do it. Not with her. She was just a little freaked out, but she would've come around. Deep down, she was with me. Hoping she'd be your Aryan bride? Not everybody saw my future like that. Tamyra? You guys were out late last night. Are you looking for something? No. It's okay. Honey, what's wrong? Sweetheart, please let me help. Is it your father? No. Please let me out. I need to go to the police. Is someone hurt? She's dead. We killed her. Who? A woman, a Latin woman. We shot her. Please, let me out. Do you know what those spic mud people niggers do to white women like us? Ravage us. And you don't hear about it on the news, and the cops won't help. All we have is men like my son to protect us. No, but this woman didn't do anything wrong. We are at war with those people. You are either with us, or you're against us. You can't do this. We are. It's happening with or without you. Your mother killed Tamyra Borden? Why are you surprised? She raised me. My mother... is the ultimate believer. You ever heard those stories about somebody who raises a pit bull? eds them gunpowder and kicks them to make them mean? One day the dog turns on 'em, attacks. That's what happened to you. Your little psychopath Spider told us what you did to his girlfriend Tamyra. He straight-cold sold you out. What did I do? I talked to her. Tried to reason with her. And when that didn't work, you killed her. I would never lay my hands on that girl. She was going to send Spider back to jail. Your baby boy. You wouldn't let that happen. Do you think I'm stupid? We think you had someone else do your dirty work for you. Somehow Tamyra got out and was beat to death a mile from your house. Somehow. Hey. Why aren't you upstairs eating dinner? Elliot. Yeah? We ran away from our parents, and... here we are again. We're prisoners... living with another crazy man. Yeah. Spider's not what I thought. If I could go back to the night that he came to get me, instead of getting in that car, I'd run away. I'd get on the first bus out, and when I got out, I'd change my name. I'd try to always be happy. Elliot, what are you doing? They'll kill you. You need to go. Go now. Please. Come with me. Come! Don't be scared. I'm sorry I didn't tell you to leave. When you first came. Go. He went after her. Ten minutes later. With a hammer. And you just let him go? You can't stop young men on a mission. Elliot went after her on your mission. You put him up to it, Rayanne. How'd you make him do it? Elliot didn't believe in killing. You don't know Elliot. He's not who he pretends to be. He's much weaker. Did you talk to Spider? Everything all right? Tamyra wasn't just some girl you met a few times. You helped her escape from Spider. You both knew Spider killed Nora Mariposa. And Rayanne says that's what you did to Tamyra. What? Well, Rayanne is a trailer trash lunatic. What is it you teach? Economics. So this is for pleasure? Ah, Lightning and the Sun. You fooled us, Elliot. You look normal enough. And Nordic mythology. Ben Klassen. History of the Illuminati. Mein Kampf. You didn't stop hanging out with Spider because of his beliefs. 'Cause you two got that in common. Do those college kids' parents know the kind of sewage they're paying you to teach their kids? You don't think economics and race belong in the same classroom? This is all about money. 9/11. The Jews bringing do the towers. The war we're fighting right now with our white males. It's all to protect Israel? You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Does it nag at you, Detective, that you only got your job because the liberal elite pities your race? You guys believe in alien probes, too? The tide is turning, Detective. We are on the Internet. We are funded and organized. And politicians agree: it's time to make our neighborhoods safe, protect our borders. The courts agree affirmative action is reverse racism. You wrap it up like it ain't narrow-minded, paranoid bullcrap, but it is. Well, what's really crazy, Elliot, is that you can say all this... but you're Jewish. No, I'm not. No. Your mother's Jewish, Elliot. Makes you the most self-hating son of a bitch I ever seen. I'm not that. Not anymore. It's 'cause of your mother you have this way about you. It's weak. People see it. That's why it is. How it is. How? Nobody respecting you. It's that sick thing in you. I don't even live with my mother. I don't even like her. It's only half. Feels like more than that. It's not. You've gotta burn it out. How'd you burn it out, Elliot? Killing Tamyra for the cause? Rayanne convinced you. You're not gonna leave here and say that thing you said, are you? Because that would be slander. I'm a white American. Nothing less. Take her somewhere else. Wait till you're far from here. Our esteemed president Theodore Roosevelt said it and I don't know why people can't grasp this "We have room for but one sole loyalty and that is loyalty to the American people." Okay. I'll handle it. Tamyra was American. Your logic doesn't work. I'm talking about the ordinary American. Your mailman, college student, fireman. They've been wronged, and now they're mad. I didn't write the rules of war. They've existed since the dawn of time. Blood is spilled and it wipes us clean. Why'd you need to be clean, Elliot? You could've left with her. No. She was a race traitor. Like you. And I was a soldier. It's what the true soldiers do. And when the race war starts, everyone who ever laughed at me and deserted me will say, "He knew. He knew all along." I had to. To be clean.
