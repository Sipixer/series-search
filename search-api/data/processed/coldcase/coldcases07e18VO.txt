by The Cars.</i> Oh, come on, Barry. I want to hear the movie. I don't see anybody else watching. It's James Dean. Peach schnapps ? That's your big move, Barry ? I thought you liked peach schnapps. Oh, who told you that ? Shane Bannif ? No. Next time you see Shane, ask him what happened at Devil's Pool. - He took you there ? - Pumped me full of peach schnapps, said he wanted to jump the ledge. - No way. - Way. I jump, but Shane has some last-minute shrinkage. End of our big date. I'll take one of these. Bottoms up. Feels like we're being watched. You want to go in the back ? Can you put the top up ? Yeah. Just don't move. Damn it. It's stuck. Well, unstick it. You look... beautiful... Help ! Somebody help him ! Well, you look great, Diane. Ah, capoeira, crunches, six rounds at the heavy bag. I never give an inch. - Boss. - Lil, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Diane Yates. Agent Yates, FBI. This the one you told me about, John ? Uh... something I can help you with ? Maybe. Diane got her start in the PPD. 18th District. Wild West back then. She blazed a trail for women. Oh, that's a bunch of bull, Johnn I got tired of being groped by the boys club and then being passed up for promotion. Ah, it's more complicated than that. What, you want to compare detective test scores ? No. They spot you ten points for having a Y chromosome. Well, it's not too long ago. At least the Bureau was a little bit more enlightened. You back for memories or... coffee ? A case you worked on a while ago. The fresh job. Mel Shaver. Shot dead walking his dog. Elmwood Park. Suspected robbery, went cold with no witnesses. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. - What's the FBI's interest in the job ? - Classified. Listen, I had a rough one last night, I need a fistful of Ibuprofen or something stronger. "Classified." Give me a break. Well, just download her on the case, Lil. Maybe she can help us solve it. Got some Ibuprofen in my desk. Anything stronger ? Mel Shaver, 43-year-old. Tax lawyer, shot on November 6, in Elmwood Park. Recover any ballistics evidence ? Through and through. Gold Rolex, a wallet missing. Got a string of holdups in the area. What else ? Wife says he didn't have any enemies. - Solid citizen. - What about habits ? Crack or stripping his bark in the woods ? Nothing turned up. Nothing turned up, or you didn't ask ? I worked the case. There was nothing to go on. It's a Percocet, left over from an accident. Shame not to finish a prescription. I didn't need them. Major Maurice Kitchener got the end he deserved. Run my name through the Fed database ? Wouldn't exactly describe you as a solid citizen, Detective. Though you lean that way. - I do my best. - Of course you do. What's this ? It's a wooded area, adjacent to the kill spot. No, no, no. Here. I need these blown up. Get a high-res scan. This is Philadelphia. We got one lab tech, one copy machine and a two-week wait. That's for a hot case. I'll do it, then. So, is this the extent of your investigation ? Unless the FBI has some new information. No. We're counting on you having missed something. Doubt it. Case is cold. Start by re-interviewing the wife. And do you need approval from Daddy, or can we just work this case ? How exactly do you know Stillman ? Johnny always gave me a fair shake coming up. All things considered. Considering what ? I broke up his marriage. Cold Case Season 7 Episode 18 The last drive-in (Part 1) Hey. Hey. - You want a piece of me ? - Nah. Just came to see how you were doing. Well, five hours a day I get to talk about my feelings. Can't sleep 'cause my roommate's up every five minutes washing the germs off his hands, and lecturing me about palm oils in my diet. Highlight of the day is taking on my fellow detectives in ping-pong, but other than that things are looking up. How's the Jell-O ? Not bad. Mac and cheese sucks. Look. Portable DVD player. Thank you. "The Honeymooners." "The Godfather One." Two. "Midnight Run." "The Cutting Edge" ? It's a guilty pleasure. Mine, too. Between us. D.A., uh, reopened the Billingsley case. Fat lot of good that does Joe Don. Come on. All right. Has there been a break in the case ? It's a routine reinvestigation. Why is the FBI interested? Quite a collection. My husband bought those for me. Cute. What kind of man was your husband ? I know what you're asking. We had a good marriage. What, because he bought you these ? And he was very thoughtful. Sounds like. I'm sorry. I don't see what this has to do with his murder ? If you could just tell us what happened that night. Mel took our dog for a walk and was killed by a stranger. One minute you're planning a trip to the Galapagos and the next you're shopping funerary urns. Did he ever live or work in Upper Darby ? - Not that I know of. - Anywhere in Delaware County ? He was a homebody. Meaning what ? You'd just sit around sipping Sleepytime Tea and watching "60 Minutes" ? Mel worked. He watched the Phillies. He took walks. Our big excitement was... dinner and a movie. Did he ever mention the Darby View Drive-In ? Drive-In ? This is going to help solve my husband's murder ? Oh, just answer the question. I think I want you to leave. Interesting interrogation technique. You're a hand-holder. It works sometimes. - That woman lost her husband. - I got that. As well as he liked the Phillies and walks in the park. It's a tragic loss, to be sure. Well, she might've given us something. I'm looking for connections, not Facebook friends. She didn't know who killed her husband, and I needed to know that. Boss said these belong to you. Diane Yates. Scotty Valens. You two partners ? What type of name is that, Valens ? Italian ? Mexican ? Cuban, Puerto Rican. As in Valenzuela. It's a shame to shorten that. I dated a Latino once. All talk, no follow through. You're dating the wrong Latinos. Well, I guess so. How about you put those pretty brown eyes of yours to good use ? And don't worry, I don't bite. Anymore. I got grass, trees, rocks, park bench. Mmm, there's something here. Could be a homeless squat. I don't recall an interview in the file. They must've split when they saw the cops. Yeah, but it'd be nice to know if he saw something. I'll call patrol. Talk to the beat cop. I miss a spot shaving ? Just looking. Thinking you'd fit right in at the Bureau. You fill out a suit nicely, and I'm sure you're good at sucking up. - Minority doesn't hurt. - Yeah. I'll get right on that. So, what's the Bureau want with this case, anyway ? What's it like working with the bleach queen ? Well, Lil and I make a good team. Oh, I bet. It's not like that. You're not her type ? Thanks. Guy we're looking for is Carl Guidry. The bum in the park. Patrol picked him up last week for a visit to the psych ward. At St. Paul's. You remember this place, Carl ? Yes. You stay there sometimes? Under my tree. Well, a man was shot and killed there last November. And we think you might've seen it happen. No,I did not. It was right here by the path. He was walking a dog. No, ma'am. Final answer. Carl ? We know everything, Carl. Everything inside that head of yours. Even that girl. You have a problem with people reading your thoughts ? I want it to stop. I can help you with that. First, you have to help us. Take that. It'll keep the intruders out. Is that better ? I think so. It must be working. Can I have another ? After you tell us about the shooting. Okay. I was right-right there. You leave when you saw the police ? I didn't want no trouble. The man in the green jacket, Carl... what was he doing to the body ? Taking that gold watch. I suppose. How'd you know about that watch, Carl? Did you take the watch, Carl ? I took a few things. There goes robbery as a motive. But the shooter checked the body. Making sure there was no bullet left behind. Get something off the homeless guy ? Saw the shooter. That's good. So, Yates and Stillman had a thing. A thing, thing ? It was what she said. Yeah, broke up his marriage. The bigger issue is, Cougar Town won't let me in on what the Fed'' interest in this case is. Might have a connect to Darby in Delaware County. Yeah, I'll dig around, see what I can find. Diane, I want you to meet another member - of my team, Kat Miller. - Can I talk to you ? Nice to meet you, too. - You promised to keep me in the loop. - I will. But first I need Rush to walk me through the crime scene. Shaver enters the park approximately 9:30. I figure he keeps to the lighted path. The killer waited in the bushes till he rounds the corner. Confronts Shaver, and maybe something happens with the dog, or Shaver resists. Shot came from over there. With a handgun ? It's got to be 100 yards. He used a rifle. Not a lot of thugs using long guns. Shaver enters the shooting lane illuminated by the street lamp. It's a perfect shot. It puts the trajectory... ...here. You gonna tell me what's going on ? We got to get this back to ballistics. Look, I don't give a crap how far back you and Stillman go. Want to keep shining me on, go ahead. I'll call my own friend in the Bureau. I'm your friend in the Bureau. We have a serial killer, a sniper. Are there other cases to back this up ? 'Cause I don't recall other unsolveds with a rifle. Last one was 27 years ago, and it looks like he came out of retirement. - Where's Yates ? - Down at ballistics. Found this. - Darby View Drive-In, 1980. - Shooting never solved. Only evidence was a rifle bullet recovered from the victim... 25.06. Well, Yates thinks the Shaver murder is the work of a serial sniper. Might have heard if a sniper was picking off folks in our backyard. And they sent one agent ? Feds come two to a box. Well, I figure, boss vouches for her, she must be good. What if the task force blows in and starts barking orders ? Hey. Hey. Kicked me early. Got those files from the Billingsley case for you. Just coffee, Fay. Trying to help the family out, you know ? You talk to the warden ? They investigated Joe Don's shanking. It turns out, he cut the chow line, the gang took offense. Well, that's on me. No, you can't keep beating yourself up about this, Nick. No, I can't look the other way, either. Well, do the work, get your head right. What's that supposed to mean ? Well, it means, it's gonna be a while before you're cleared back to active duty. I'm good to go. Worked with a guy in Vice. He had a meltdown, his wife left him. Substance abuse. Brass had him take a powder. Yeah ? Well, he was chomping at the bit to get back on the line. He got cleared, comes back all smiles. Two weeks later, I found him dead in his squad car. I'm not that guy. Take as much time as you need, Nick. We'll be here for you when you're ready. You got to fluff half the boys in the lab to get a report back around here. Come back a 25.06 ? Same bullet that killed Barry Jensen at the Darby View Drive-In. Nice. Yes. Preliminary ballistics makes it a match. Well, the same shooter then ? You think ? You know, if you want my help, you need to tell me what's going on. How about we get a drink ? If you're 12-stepping, you can sip diet soda and silently judge me. I can attribute five shootings to our guy. Victims linked ? If only. Kid on his way to college, bus driver, secretary, roofer, and now the tax attorney. And the first one at the drive-in. Three more after that, and then, nothing for 27 years. I thought he was dead or in prison. Then the Shaver shooting pops. Same MO : a single shot to the chest. No bullet left behind. You've been hunting this guy for 30 years ? Oh, I must have chased down a dozen cases I thought fit the pattern. - Calling in the task force ? - Nope. First homicide was right around the corner here. Frank's Coffee Shop. Double murder : waitress, manager. First on the scene ? Took initial statements, and right away I liked the busboy for it. And then the detectives show up. Oh. Yeah, didn't see it the same way. No. I try telling 'em, but they liked the ex-con grill cook. The lead laughed in my face. Told me to shut my trap and secure his crime scene. Oh, I remember a few of those myself. Well, last thing we need is some Fed profiler telling us what kind of underwear our shooter favors, or that he had mommy issues. Another round. One for him. Amstel Light at the end of the bar is kind of cute. You seeing anyone ? Was. Another cop ? Yeah. You're looking for the real thing. Good luck. Only took me 30 years, but I stopped believing in that nonsense when I figured out what men want. What's that ? A girlfriend, not a wife. All right, Philly P.D. will work jointly with Agent Yates and the FBI. Got five shootings. The first in 1980, the last five months ago. Agent Yates will run the rest for you. With the exception of the first shooting, the killer chose isolated targets, minimizing his exposure. This guy is patient, smart, and careful. Safe to assume military service. Four victims either lived, worked or had ties to Delaware County. First victim, Barry Jensen, shot at a drive-in, 1980. - Any witnesses ? - No. I've already done the legwork on that. There's nothing there. Felicity Andrews, secretary. Shot in her car in New Jersey in 1981. Assigned theorized a carjacking gone wrong. Preston Schmall, part-time roofer, shot in the Poconos while camping, 1982. Next was Fred Norris, a bus driver, shot in '83 near the bus grounds. And now Shaver, the tax attorney, shot just five months ago. Any casing recovered ? No, but we have the bullet that killed Shaver. Matches the first victim, 1980. All right, re-interview family, friends, any folks at those scenes. See if something was missing. Interview the bus driver. Oh. You want me to interview the bus driver ? Well, you can relate culturally. Just right on the surface, huh ? You got a problem with that, report me to Reverend Al after we find this guy. Why are y'all coming around now on Fred ? Reopening his murder. Well, it's about time. You two friends? Played tonk every Friday night. Didn't have any family. Just the regulars on his route. What happened that night, Calvin ? Well, I was getting ready for my next shift. Catching some z's on the bus, and... and that's when I... that's when I heard it. Freddie ? - Hey, what are you doing ? - Get help ! He's been shot ! I thought it was one of Freddie's jokes. We were always pranking each other. This other guy... black? White? White. When I came back from making the phone call, he was gone. Anything you remember about him ? Green Army jacket. Just never made any sense to me. Felicity was going to get her radiology degree. And you worked together before she took the job at the high school ? At Philly Savings and Loan. - Secretaries ? - Executive assistants. Just a nicer way of saying the same thing. We covered for the loan officers making promises they couldn't keep. Were there a lot of angry folks back then ? Oh, you bet. Spent most of the time answering phones, getting yelled at. Felicity get in the middle of something ? I remember this one guy who kept calling, but that was years before she was murdered. You got a name ? Just a nickname. Mr. 6.83. A rate the manager promised him but couldn't deliver. Wanna get lunch ? They have a new salad bar at Maxwell's. Felicity, aren't you going to answer it ? I can't. It's him, I just know it. Mr. 6.83 ? He called three times this morning, and I think he followed me into the parking lot the other day. Philly Savings and Loan. I want answers. You promised me that rate. And I want a new Cadillac and a boyfriend that looks like Robert Redford. Nance ! Where is she ? The blonde that keeps lying to me, saying that my loan's gonna go through ?</i> Would you like to speak to a manager? You're all liars. Drop dead, creep ! "Strange way" by Firewall. It got so bad, she finally quit. Good thing, 'cause the bank went belly up a year later. Did she know this guy's name? I don't remember. Like I said, there were a lot of angry people with the recession and all. So, you were there when Preston was shot ? Not exactly. You told police that you were on the trail with him. I wasn't with him at the time. - Did you see the shooter ? - No. The police said it was a stray bullet from a poacher. So, you went hiking but just not together ? We weren't exactly getting along. We went camping hoping to reconnect. A little late. You filed for separation a week before he was killed. Did you tell him? We argued, he ran into the woods. That's the last time I saw him. Why lie about being there when he was shot? It was like that police officer knew. Knew what? That it was my fault somehow. It felt like I'd been set free. I know that sounds terrible, but it's the truth. A happy accident. It's funny, I hadn't thought about Preston in years. And then, last month, I ran into a sister and she told me that... One of his gambling buddies had been shut upstate New York. Shot and killed ? No, he survived. You don't think there's a connection, do you ? - Can you give us a name ? - Tim Hudson. He'd hire Preston to help him repo cars. Bus driver saw the killer at the scene. Checking for a bullet ? Trying to, until he was interrupted. What about the secretary ? A disgruntled bank customer might've been stalking her. Pull the loan records from that period, Scotty, match them against military servers, people in the system. Well, we got something. Found a survivor, Tim Hudson. Worked as a repo man with victim number three. Preston Schmall. Wounded in a drug-related shooting. Remember how I said I'd keep you in the loop ? You know, I'm cutting you a lot of slack, Diane, on account of our history. This guy's out there, John, I know it. I'm gonna protect my people if it turns into a turf war. It's not going to. Besides, Rush doesn't need any protecting. I just want that out there. Let's put away the badges, huh ? Sorry. Always did take you three drinks to loosen up. How's your mother ? She can't remember my name. She spends her days listening to the radio and humming to herself. Well, it happens. When that day comes, shoot me dead. Here's to knowing when to fold. It's been a long time, John. Too long. No hard feelings. I wasn't a boy. We both knew the game. I wasn't the one married. Ah, it would've ended, anyway. Another one ? I better not. I don't wanna regret anything in the morning. I won't if you won't. You know what ? I'm toast. Why don't you give me a ride home ? I... I'll call you a cab Grab your keys and take me home. Or I'll get one of these other young bucks to do it. Remember Preston ? Hard guy to forget. What'd he do ? He was shot and killed in '82. Must've rubbed the wrong person the wrong way. Preston wasn't half as charming as he thought he was. A little odd that Preston gets shot and killed and then a year later, you get shot ? Police said it was probably a stickup. Probably ? Ah, I had to take their word for it. Why is that ? Fifth of Old Crow, half a dozen beeners, a little herb to even it all out. One minute I'm sailing, the next minute I'm waking up in the hospital and they're telling me I'll never walk again. You don't remember anything ? I got whole years missing, lady. Cops said I was in a bad hood trying to score. Sounds good to me. It's like the hand of God just came down and gave me a crack. Just changed your ways, huh ? Been clean and sober ever since. Of course I, uh, can't walk. But that is a small price to pay for getting me off the road I was on. You and Preston work for a repo company ? Hmm, just me. Recession was good for business. I had so much work, I'd toss Preston a couple of bucks now and then to give me a hand, especially if I was in a bad neighborhood. Why is that ? People don't exactly invite you in for milk and cookies when you're taking their car or their color TV. You guys ever get into it with a customer? Oh, from time to time. Mostly words. Well, maybe a vet or, you know, a guy in the military. One guy I remember. Intense son of a bitch. "Even the losers" by Tom Petty. Come on, man. Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?! You're behind six months on your payments. Just doing our jobs, man. Oh, what, take things that don't belong to you?! The car belongs to the bank now. Come on, man, I need that car to get to my job. Here's an idea. Get a bus pass. I was gonna pay. Come on, I can't afford to lose this job, guys. Unless you can pay the delinquent amount in full right now... Times are tough, boudreaux. Knock it off, Preston. Hey, you serve ? Yeah, what about it ? First Division, Bravo Company. So, we're supposed to give you the Semper Fi break ? Can't do that. Look, I come back empty-handed, guess what? I lose my job. Come on, I'm trying real hard here, man. Try harder. Back off ! Stop it ! Hey, hey, stop ! Stop ! Hey ! Someday somebody's gonna take something from you, pal. Something real important. And you're gonna remember me - when that happens. - Go back inside. You wait. You're gonna get yours, boudreaux. Marines don't make idle threats. They take action. He was pretty steamed, but, uh, this was years before I got shot. - You remember a name ? - Just the car. Ford Torino. Must've been '76 or so. Boss... Boss, pulled repo company records. A dozen cars match Hudson's description. We cross-referenced the names with Philly Savings and Loans records, got a hit. Bill Shepard, ex-Marine, served in Vietnam. Well, he knows his way around a gun. Owned the Darby View Drive-In. Tried to get a loan. Connected to every victim except the bus driver and Mel Shaver. Shepard went off the grid in the '80's. No credit card statements, zero bank activity. Yates ran the name through the FBI database and got a hit. Lifetime subscriber to The Long Rifle Review. That a crime? Post-Oklahoma City, gets you on a watch list. Searching tax records trying to track down an address. Rush located his son, Paul Shepard. A month overdue. And it's my fault I gotta charge late fees. Agent Yates. This is Detective Rush. Looking for your father, Bill Shepard. Well, that makes two of us. You're gonna have to do better than that. What's this about ? Your father's a suspect in a series of unsolved shootings. What ? He in contact with you ? He ran off and left me when I was 14. Had to go live with my aunt and uncle in New Jersey. - Just took off ? - Lost everything. A drive-in ? Yeah, pretty good business back in the '70's. Then they started opening multiplexes. - He try to hold on ? - For a while. He loved that place. He used to love watching people watch movies. It looks like you caught the bug. Well, it was hard not to. You know, my father was his own worst enemy. He should've sold the place. Instead, the bank took it. So, what did he do after he lost the drive-in ? He started drinking. I still remember the day the dad I knew was gone. "Kid" by The Pretenders. How you folks doing today ? Going to the park. Nice day for it. SHEPHARD: Yeah. You need a little more. Come on, you know me. NORRIS: Sorry. Full fare required for rides. Those are the rules. can anyone spot me 50 cents ? Come on, man. Don't embarrass me in front of my boy. - It's okay. We can walk. - No, it's not okay, son. I've got my other passengers to take care of. I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do for you. You're going to throw me off the bus ? I need you to step out. Look, you can get a free bus pass at the shelter. A month later he said he was going up north to look for a job at a mill. That the last you saw of him ? He was never mean or anything like that. Just... broken. That the number six bus ? I think so. He used to take it all the time. Well, that driver was shot a couple years later. So, back then, you think that my father...? We think he's still out there. We'll put a tap on your phones, in case he tries to reach you. Excuse me. You know, I-I haven't seen or heard from him in 30 years. Anyplace he might've gone to? I-I spent half my life trying to forget what happened. Traced his V.A. checks to a P. O. box in Mount Pocono. The clerk there's pulling up a home address. Let's go. The guy we're looking for is Walt. Postal clerk for 40 years. Bill Shephard still rents a box? Yeah, all rentals have physical addresses on file. Clerk said he just needed to locate the records. A good place to hide out from the world and plot your revenge. Walt ? FBI. We spoke on the phone. Pretty lady... Get him. I got you covered. Let's get him out of there. - You got him ? - Yeah. We need backup now ! Hold on. Hold on ! We got an eyewitness saw a black Chevy van speeding away after the shooting. What about the postal clerk ? Critical. Ugh, here come the FBI stormtroopers. Hey, John, I'll keep you out of this. Keep me out of what? I wasn't exactly cleared to work this case. What ? Hey, Ryan. How's your mother ? Forgot how charming you could be, Ryan. And I forgot how reckless you could be, Special Agent Yates. Told her section boss she was on her way to Philly to look after her sick mother. I know, I stepped in it. Now, is that an apology ? I'm sorry for being right about this guy. I can see that. Now, I'm sure the family of the postal clerk will understand. John Stillman, Philly PD. Ryan Cavanaugh. Special Agent in charge. Detective Lily Rush. Agent Yates had no authority to investigate this case. You had full knowledge of my interest in this case. Over here, Yates. You breached protocol, misled a major metropolitan police department. Do you rehearse this, Ryan? A man is in critical condition who was in the presence of an FBI agent and a police detective. That's a page one screw up, Yates. You want to hang me out to dry ? Do it. But you're going to need them if you want to catch this guy. We've already coordinated with the state police. Yeah, SWAT teams are on their way. Philly PD can assist, provided everything goes through our command. I need to debrief you. Now. Could've told me the truth, Diane. I'll liaison with the Feds-- make sure we don't get pushed aside. We'll head to the hospital, wait for the clerk. Still in surgery, last I heard. Well, guy must have known something our killer didn't want anybody else to find. Well, if he pulls through, we'll question him. Get him to I.D. Bill Shephard. What he looks like now. At what point did you decide you could just run your own investigation, Yates ?</i> That day in your office, Ryan. When you were too busy to hear my evidence.</i> What is it with you and this case ? Detective. Agent. Might want to use the sink. Got blood on your hands. Thanks. - Lieutenant Stillman. - Yeah ? We got a location on the suspect's van. You're welcome to ride along. Let's go. Honey, you can flash all the badges you want at me. CIA, NSA, FBI. The answer's no. Important to speak to him the minute he gets out of surgery. Man lost a lot of blood. He's flatlined once already. Have a seat, you read a Redbook and you wait your turn. Still got that blood on your hand, Detective. Uh, I was on my way when I realized I have Agent Yates' cell phone. Must've grabbed it in the commotion. Detective... do you mind ? Sorry. Sure. Thank you. ******** I want to get back to the part where you decide to misrepresent the Bureau's interest in this case. Lieutenant Stillman and I are friends. I bet you are. - Problem, Yates ? - I got to hit the head. Oh. Men's room is down that way. What's going on ? Found this in the clerk's truck. I'm driving. Are you family ? Niece. Is he going to make it ? Best to say good-bye now. He's conscious, but... - Walt ? Is this him ? - What the hell ? Bill Shephard. Is this the man with the P.O. box ? Crash cart! Come out of the vehicle, with your hands up. We have you surrounded. Give this guy a wakeup call. I got no movement. Stand by. Go ! Clear ! Clear. Got no movement. Negative contact. This is it. Can't believe we missed it. We didn't. I meant the FBI. Clear right. Clear left. Looks like he's been here. Here. 25.06. Got to call this in. No. In a minute. It's been a long time since anyone's been down here. - You okay ? - Yeah. You smell that ? Another victim. Exit wound. It looks self-inflicted. Hand me that light. Anything ? William Shephard. What the hell ? "Let's Ride Into the Sunset Together" playing.</i> Something the matter ? I need to borrow your truck. I don't understand. Uh, is there something I can help you with ?
