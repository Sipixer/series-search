(http://club.nate.com/tsm) December 11, 1978 It's snowing outside. There is no outside. No yesterday. Promise? Matthew! Matthew Adams. It's my dad. Matthew Adams. Matthew! Matthew doesn't know you. I wanna see my son. He was an orphan when I met him. Look, you son of a bitch. - I know what you do. - And I you. You are manipulating a screwed up kid. - And who screwed him up? - I demand to see him. Call to him. He has free will. Matthew. I want you to come home. Beth wants you to come home. Matthew! Matthew! He's got a new father now. Father, I am free. Good bye. - Matthew. Classification : Suicide Matthew and I were only a year apart. People used to think that we were twins. So what made him join this group? You mean cult. Okay. After Matthew's first year of college, our mother killed herself. Matthew kind of drifted after that. So he joined this First Generation, cut off old ties? And this was '76. Jonestown had just happened. The Kool-Aid? / We were scared that they were gonna do the same thing. So we hired this deprogrammer. - Remember his name? - Yeah. Bill Crawford. He got Matthew to a motel room, but two days later he escaped. While you were there? No. My dad and I left him alone with Crawford. The next morning, Matthew was on our porch. Dead from cyanide. Suicide? Well, that's what we thought for all of these years and there was even a note. But.. then I saw this. Rescue Misson Turned Murder? Crawford's still in business, huh? Last week he was working with a girl who died of an asthma attack. Then he tried to cover up and make it look like a suicide. How did he do that? Dosed her with poison, forged a note. And said she escaped? Like your brother ?? supposedly dead. We never should've left him alone with that man. Anna Mayes. Can I..? What's going on? My lieutenant sent me. We found a floater this morning in the Schuykill. - You call the updesk? - No. I came to you 'cause um.. it's someone we know. It's Scotty's girl. Elisa?

Good bye, Matthew. - Standard suicide note. - Or not. The sister thinks maybe this deprogrammer wrote it after Matthew died in his care. Deprogramming, sketchy business. What'd boss want with Valens? - Don't know. - Got the 49 on this Matthew Adams? 20 years old, mainline kid was pre-med at Penn for a year and dropped out. Father was a surgeon, right? He couldn't have liked that. No, especially when Matthew dyed his hair black, started hanging out at the Arsenal. - Arsenal? - Punk spot. Mohawks, slam dancing. Yeah. He was into that cult June of '78. After he died Vice stormed the place, found a vial of cyanide for every member. They were gonna pull their own Jonestown. Him dying might've stopped that. I remember those First Generation nuts. Leader was named Warfield. - What was he preaching? - Erase the past, come start a new generation with him as their father. Father Warfield is in prison now. Chester. Deprogrammer's our first stop. - So what? - You give Anna my job, bring me out here to break the news? It's about Elisa, Scotty. Is she in trouble? They found her this morning in the Schuykill. Found her? Yeah, looks like she jumped. Nah, that can't be. I'm sorry, Scotty. Nah, cuz she wouldn't. I spoke to Manny Fernandez at West. He's got Anna working the case. Well, then I gotta talk to Anna. because... No, she's scared of heights. - And she was getting better. - Yeah, I know. I'm gonna walk. Still working while you were on bail? Why shouldn't I work? - I'm no threat. - Till this last time. It was an accident. You dosed her with strychnine accidentally? You remember Matthew Adams? Yeah, I remember every job. You had an accident with him too, used cyanide to cover your tracks. - Off by a mile lady. - Things go wrong. '78, deprogramming was just being invented. Look, that kid, he crawled out of bathroom window of the motel. I never saw him again. You were obviously not above breaking a few laws to get your work done. If somebody you loved was hold up with David Koresh in Waco, wouldn't you want me to get him out before the Feds lit that place up? Tell us about Matthew. It's like every job. Started with a rescue. You mean kidnapping? Look, man, I was the good guys. Matthew Adams? Matthew Adams! Get him. There's no Matthew Adams here. Now, or Charlie Manson here gets it! Door! - Matty. - What's going on? - We're here to help. - Son, listen to me. I'm not your son. Tell him. Your name is Matthew. You live at 1020.. In three days, it's zero hour. And everything will be wiped away. More. More! You love the Sixers, but you cheer for the knicks just to piss off dad. Matt. Please look at me. Your sister's talking to you. Three days till zero hour. No more talking. Shhh. What was zero hour? It was the cult's plan for mass suicide. But Matthew died two days later. Why kill himself a day early? Maybe so we wouldn't stop him. Look, I got a 90 percent success rate. That Warfield character, he really messed up that kid's head. Maurice Warfield. Detectives Rush and Jeffries, Homicide. Ah, the faces of the law. So serious. Desperate to hide you're the same scared children you always were. We're here about Matthew Adams. Lived with you, 1978. He was an artist. His father tried to fill his head with science. And you tried to convince him you were his father. All I ever did to Matthew was suggest he had a choice. There's nothing criminal about that. Tax fraud and statutory rape are another story. Well, those are your laws. Not yours? I don't accept your authority. I consider myself wrongly detained. Just a misunderstood man spreading a good word. - Amen. - And the good word was? That you can erase your past, choose your family. Take you as their father? - I love children. - Probably sounded good to Matthew. How'd you find him? Like you found any lost soul in 1978. In a lost place. Hey. Do I know you? No. But I know you. Really? A rebel boy, in combat boots and Gucci socks. - Poor little rich kid. - You don't know anything about me. I stole your thunder. Not letting them finish. You wanted to get your ass kicked. - Why would I want that? - World's full of pain. You wanna control how you get hurt. But you can't. Screw you, man. Okay. Maurice sees things in people. Right. Like what? And he needed a place to crash, so he came home with us. How does he end up dead? Ask the commando who came in and held a gun on me. He took Matthew away. I never saw him again. But you know he died from cyanide. I heard that. / Which you had stashed at the cult, prepping for your mass suicide. Don't believe the ghost stories. There was no suicide plan. - No? - It wasn't even a cult. Just an ideal. And now? First Generation is a thing of the past. Frannie looked over the autopsy, says Matthew had abrasions on his back, might have come from being dragged. If someone moved him, it goes from a suicide to homicide. Maybe the deprogrammer? Crawford hopped to plane in Miami that night. Records back it up. Crawford's in the clear, boss. Bad news. Scotty's girlfriend. They found her body in the river this morning. Where is he? Home. We gotta go there. He needs time, Lil. Alone. Yeah, it's what he wants. Obey the first generation. Anything? Uh... One lift from the window. Run it through AFIS tonight. For a thing of the past, the First Generation sure is organized. Warfield got word to the outside nice and quick. Must be still around in the cult from prison. So who's his man on the outside? We'll check visitor logs tomorrow, see who he had contact with after we left. You got nice neighbors. They didn't see squat. Warfield told us about two other members, Nick and Alison. We got a date with them in the morning. What's wrong with these cats? Nothing. You okay? Scotty? Yeah. Hey, Scotty. We're sorry. Yeah, I told Elisa's mom I'd pick up her stuff. Oh yeah, of course. You got the scene photos? Not yet. Cuz, uh.. I wanna see them. No reason for that. I wanna see them, Anna. There was a note addressed to you, supposed to hang on to it, but I got a copy. Where was it? On her bed. Hey, if you wanna talk.. Hey, I gotta jet. - I wanna help you, Scotty. - I'm good. So, Nick. You were Maurice's muscle back in the day. I washed myself clean of Maurice Warfield 25 years ago. Well, someone's keeping the cult alive. Any idea? Sorry. I've baptized myself in the name of the lord. Thought you two were thick as thieves. For a time. Anyone in the cult have a reason to hurt Matthew? No one but Warfield himself. Why's that? False gods can be wrathful. We don't speak cult. Matthew crossed him, after his three days. Three days? Initiation rite. Spend three days in total darkness. Sounds fun. / Matthew came out knowing just what he wanted. Son? I was.. I was so alone in the dark. You don't have to be. Not any more. I remember. All of it. No memories. No past, no pain. You can let all that go now. I can? Come on. Matthew. We want you to stay here. With us. If you want. Really? Will you stay? I wanna show you what a family is. What love is? I want that. Then choose someone. Anyone. To love. Alison. Alison. Come on. Is it okay? Matthew has chosen you. I love you. And she loves you. You'll be together one month, no more. You understand? I understand. So this Alison was Warfield's squeeze. But Matthew wanted that. Did they obey the one month rule? No. They fell in love. So you're saying Warfield offed Matthew because he was banging her past the cult expiration date? I'm saying he defied Maurice. And Maurice did not like to be defied. You got a nice shop. - You own it? - All the designs are mine. I work for myself. You still think about Matthew? The love of your life gets snatched at gunpoint and you never lay eyes on him again. What do you think? We heard you were Maurice's girl. He had a lot of girls. Any chance you were special? He didn't like Matthew choosing you? No. It was more important to Maurice to be a father figure than anything else. So when your month with Matthew was up...? Maurice said we could stay together. Any idea who's keeping the cult going for Maurice now? He had a lot of sway over a lot of people. Guy could make you follow him into a burning house. How did he get you? I was at the end of a bad marriage. He made me feel special. Alison, how do you get out from underneath someone like him. For me, it was when Matthew died. Biggest lost of my life. You think Matthew killed himself? I don't know. We were all pretty messed up. What if we told you now it was a homicide? I guess I'd ask if you've looked at his dad. Why? I spent 2 summers here as a lab tech. Build character. Methyl iodide, thallium, Cyanide. Doctor Boyle said she saw you. I thought maybe you came to talk. We ran out of things to talk about a long time ago. Then what are you doing here? You'll find out. Looking for narcotics? What? 'Cause I might be a dope fiend, right? - Baby, let's go. - Is she one of them? She loves me. Those zombies are controlling your mind, Matthew. No, that's your specialty. You're just ike your mother. A total headcase. Don't talk about her. / You take after her in all the worst ways. I will never forget the secret. The secret? I don't know what it was. But Matthew hated his dad for it. - And with everything going down.. - What was going down? Maurice had a plan. Zero hour. The suicide. - That's not what it was. - Then what? It's gonna be the ultimate loyalty to Maurice. We were all gonna kill our fathers. So zero hour wasn't mass suicide? Mass patricide. 30 vials of cyanide for 30 dads. So then our boy Matthew was going to kill the surgeon? Maybe the dad knew what was going down, beat him to the punch. The timing's suspicious. The day before he was targeted to die? Or maybe it has to do with the secret Matthew mentioned. Prints are back on your window. Whoever broke in ain't in the system. We get a list of visitors authorized to see Maurice? Yeah. - It's long. - He's had that many blood relatives? Turns out he fathered a fair amount of kids in his day. Every cult you ever read about, the leader's doin' all the ladies. It's good to be king. Talk to the dad, see if he had advance word on zero hour. The sister's here. Matthew wouldn't do that. That's what they were planning. I'm sorry. / I mean he and my dad had their problems but... Matthew wasn't himself. Why couldn't I reach him? His girlfriend said something about the secret..? He told her that? No details. My father wanted the things he wanted them. When Matthew was pre-med, everything was great. And when he dropped out? Dad blamed mom. They fought. It was ugly. So was the secret about her? When you work at the lab this summer, all that garbage has to come off. Well, maybe I'm not working at the lab this summer. What's that? My friend Sonnet needs an apprentice to stretch the canvases and mix paint. Your friend, the pot head? Med schools aren't really impressed with mixing paint all summer. I dropped out of Penn. And I'm applying for art school. Did you know about this? - It's what he wants. - It's what you want. - I want him to be happy. - Maybe he can end up with pill popper. Dad, Matthew's a great artist. You know, I just.. Forget it. I'll go to med school. You know, if I'm so awful, why don't I just kill myself? You're drunk again. This time, I'll do it. - You're embarrassing yourself. - I will, I will. Then kill you, already. Otherwise shut up. Forget them. You're going to art school. I'll find a quiet place in the middle of nowhere. That's where I'll go. Can I come? And when the police came, he made us say that we all saw it. But only he did. That's why Matthew hated him so much. But not you? I was the good girl. I went to medical school. Tried to forget. But I never did. Do you think your dad killed her? I don't think so. I don't know. I didn't want my family's ugliness exposed. Maybe you didn't want anyone checking the prints on the gun. My wife's death was ruled as suicide. - So was Matthew's. - Lucky man, aren't I. Two of my three family members checked out on me. Did you know your son was plannig to kill you? - No. - Kinda suspicious, Matthew dying saved your life. I tried to save my son, not kill him. How about your wife? Did you kill her? I watched my wife shoot herself in the face. That almost killed me. - Okay. - As for Matthew, have you ever looked into the eyes of someone you loved and realize the person you know is gone? Yeah. At what point do you give up? I know you're there, Matty. That you hear me. He's been at this for 40 hours. Why don't you let me take over? My father will rescue me. - You won't win. - That man, Matty, he's just like dad. They just wanna control you. Tell you how to live. Promise me you wouldn't let that happen. Remember? That quiet place in the middle of nowhere? Enough, Beth. I know you remember. Hey, hey. Where do you think you're going? Home, to my father. Oh, Matthew. Why wasn't I ever good enough? You hated me because I was like mom. No. You killed her. Matthew. What do you want from me? I wanna forget you. I don't wanna feel bad any more. Okay. You win. It's your life. Get in. I'll take you wherever you want to go. I'm a surgeon. I know when I've lost a patient. Where'd you take him? Back to that place. He got out of the car, never looked back. / So you saw him walk back into the cult the night he died. I saw that man Warfield welcome him back. You never told your daughter about this? She'd hate me. And I couldn't afford to lose anyone else. Scotty. I got your message. I couldn't get back. Sorry. I've been worried about you. I'm with her family. What can I do to help? Tell me where we are in this job. Maybe you shouldn't be here right now. Well, then you tell me where I should be. Thought you could break into my house chase me away, Maurice? I didn't break in anywhere. / We know you're still running the game on the outside. We also know about the patricide. Patricide? Now, last time you said I was planning a mass suicide. Which one is it? Well, you said you never saw Matthew after the kidnapping. But he came back. - Two days later. - Says who? - His dad. - Well, that doesn't mean I killed him. Add to that, your deputy Nick fingered you. Nick did? I see what he's doing. Nick is the keeper of my congregation. I thought the cult was dead. He's supposed to lead until I get out. But I guess he sees a chance to keep me locked up forever. So Matthew came back. And we were all thrilled. Except Nick. - How come? - Because with Matthew gone, he could try to get his wife back. His wife? Alison. Alison and Nick were married? And Nick did not like sharing her. You saying he killed Matthew? I know they said it was a suicide. But, nah.. Suicide's for cowards. Matthew was brave. Talk more about that. What? Suicide? Well. "It's a screw you to the world." - "I never really loved any of you." - Is that right? - Forget it, let's go. - No, no, no. What else does it proof? Defective thinking, - Narcissism.. - Keep going. And that the so-called loved ones have failed. Keep talking! So is Valens in the wood shed? Boss said he'd keep it in in-house. Keep it out of I.A's hands. It's true about Nick Logan's congregation. Check it out. This is a list of family allowed to visit Maurice, these are the members of Logan's church. Same list. So Logan's the number two in charge till Maurice goes out. But he figures that if Maurice stays in for murder, he'll be number one. Classic power struggle. Whatever happened to old-fashioned cult loyalty? I'll talk to Alison and see how possessive hubbby was. Let's go back to the preacher. Hey, Scotty. Hey. I, uh.. snapped out, I know. Sorry. Most people wouldn't try to come back two days after something like this. I ain't most people. Yeah. It won't happen again. I need your gun, Scotty. Just for a little while. You want my badge, too? No, the badge is yours. Elisa was in a lot of pain, Scotty. It wasn't a suicide, what happened. Wasn't there a note? But it wasn't like that. I mean, if she jumped or something.. It'd be more apologizing, that she couldn't make it. Well, what did she say? It was about the good stuff. When we were kids. Scotty, that's how sometimes people say good bye. No. No, she wrote about this.. this birthday party. Her friend turning 14 and how we're both there sneaking looks and talking about how the river smells, and how in her head, she's waiting for the light to fade so I can hold her hand in the dark and no one would see. Don't tell me that note is the end. It's the beginning. I should get back. Yeah. Turns out you're just watching over Maurice's flock until he's released, Nick. I'm a minister to a hundred people. You're a stand-in for a psychopath. It's my congregation. They look to me, not Maurice. He told us about Alison. Must've hurt. Some guy slipping it to the wife in front of your face. Maurice let them be together. That why you killed Matthew? Over her? I didn't kill anyone. Guy gets kidnapped you figured this is my chance to slide back in with the missus. But the kid's back two days later, ruins everything. It made me angry. - But I didn't kill him. - Then who did? The real psychopath. Who's that man? No one. Welcome home, son. Baby, you came back. They took him away to brainwash him. We have to know if they got to him. He came back, he's pure. I'm ready for tomorrow.. Zero hour. - Never been more ready. - We have to be sure. Go upstairs. You wait for her. Nick's right. If he's tainted, he could ruin the plan. I'm in charge of zero hour. Let me decide if he's okay. And if he's not? It'll be the biggest loss of my life. Alison was in charge of zero hour? Maurice gives her all the important assignments. Gives? Present tense? She's diehard, like him. Nick and I got married when I was 18. Smart, right? How long did it last? Oh, less than a year. I was all too glad to forget our past when we met Maurice. Was Nick the jealous type? Why do you ask? It takes a lot of rage dumping kid's body on his father's doorstop. Unthinkable. You know Matthew made it back to the cult that night. No, I would've seen him. His father drove him there. Is it too hot? No, but I could use some honey. Sure. Hands behind your head. This is a mistake. On your knees. All your own designs, right? You got her, Rush? She's the one who broke into my apartment. More than that, she killed Matthew. - You can't prove that. - You had the cyanide. Promised to kill him if the outside had gotten to his head. Poor Matthew. His sister ruined him. She got through. I had no choice. I thought I'd lost you. You'll never lose me. So, you're ready for zero hour? That's why I came back, we have to get out of here. What? What Maurice wants us to do, it's crazy. They got to you. Baby, he wants us to kill people. We're wiping out the past. We can't do that. But, we can move on. To a quiet place in the middle of nowhere. Just me, you, my sister. We'll go to police, we'll tell them about zero hour. And then, we're free. Does your family know you're doing this? My dad drove me here. We didn't say a word the whole drive. - Baby, we gotta hurry. - Okay. Okay, but we can't just run away. We have to leave Maurice a note. Okay. Yeah, fine, whatever. Just write, Father, I'm free. Good bye. Sign it. I don't need a father anymore. Just you. Do you feel it yet? It'll just be a minute now. Alison. I'll leave you on his doorstep. I came back to save you. And I'm saving you. ¢Ü Elvis CostelloÀÇ 'Peace, Love, And Understanding' ¢Ü ¢Ü As I walk through ¢Ü ¢Ü This wicked world ¢Ü ¢Ü Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity. ¢Ü ¢Ü I ask myself ¢Ü ¢Ü Is all hope lost? ¢Ü ¢Ü Is there only pain and hatred, and misery? ¢Ü ¢Ü And each time I feel like this inside, ¢Ü ¢Ü There's one thing I wanna know: ¢Ü ¢Ü What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ¢Ü ¢Ü What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ¢Ü ¢Ü And as I walked on ¢Ü Through troubled times ¢Ü My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes ¢Ü ¢Ü So where are the strong ¢Ü ¢Ü And who are the trusted? ¢Ü ¢Ü And where is the harmony? ¢Ü ¢Ü Sweet harmony. ¢Ü ¢Ü 'cause each time I feel it slippin' away, ¢Ü ¢Üjust makes me wanna cry. ¢Ü ¢Ü What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? ¢Ü ¹ø¿ª¼öÁ¤ (http://club.nate.com/tsm) ÇÑ±Û±³Á¤
