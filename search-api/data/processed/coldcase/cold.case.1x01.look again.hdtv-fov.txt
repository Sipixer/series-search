I'm flying. Good as new. Look. Todd's sick of me. So maybe you're sick of him. Let's go back to Tim's room. He's cooler than any of them. You really want to? Maybe later. You're not supposed to have people here. Who says? Your mom and dad. You're gonna call them in Jakarta? Give the lady a beer for her silence. Is Jill coming? What do you think? I saw her today. She said maybe, maybe not. Please. She's coming. Who's gonna clean this up in the morning? Go watch TV, Bonita. There she is. Oh, hi, gorgeous.

Á¦·¹¹Ì ·¡Ä¡Æ÷µå(´Ð º£¶óæµ) ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/09/28 You writing? Yeah. How you doing, Detectives? Trash still here, chairs on the floor. They hadn't closed yet. Eight years on the line, never had a triple. Last out gets the action. This an overnighter? Kid who opens up found this morning. Looks like a straight robbery? Go talk to the scene man, kid. Register's raided. Let's get it dusted. It's a bad case of death. All three shot. Her throat's cut. Doer's got a gun. Why's he gotta slit her throat, too? Um, Detective? When you dust the register... We might find your prints? That's why we keep our hands full. All right, I'm knocking on some doors. We boring you in here? Stillman called. There's a civilian down at Central, wants to talk to you. Me? Asked for a lady in Homicide. I hear you were in the Badlands. Della's Chicken and Ribs. What's the deal with this civilian? Civilian? Probably some nut job. Vera said that he, uh... I told Vera to deal with her. I've been on since midnight. I got three murders to solve, and he's pawning his dog calls off on me? I know, Lil. He is one pain in the ass, boss. Yeah, look, she's right outside. Just chase her demons away. Your triple's not gonna go anywhere, all right? You better give Vera some hell. Like it would do any good. Detective Rush. Homicide. You do murders? I investigate murders. I want to tell you about one. What's your name? Bonita... Bonita Rafaela. You been smoking some pot today, Bonita? It helps with the pain. I've got cancer. Sorry. I saw a murder. A girl was killed on a tennis court. Where's the court? Chestnut Hill. At the house where I used to work. The boys were having a party. He hit her... over and over and over and over. You didn't call the police? I went to bed. I thought it wasn't my business. A girl dying wasn't your business? And when did this happen? In 1976. 1976, Bonita? 27 years ago, and you're just telling this now? I had a son. I needed to work. But now I have this cancer. Something die in here? Whew...These cases. The timing adds up. Jill Shelby, beaten at a neighbor's house, found the next morning. Case was never solved. Yeah, like the rest of these job. But now we got a witness. Are you saying we should open a 27-year-old case, Lil? There's new direction. Yeah, witnesses from that long ago are gonna be pretty shaky. Maybe. But then, time can be on our side. People who wouldn't talk then might be willing to now. Look at this maid. Mm-hmm. I mean, time passes. People's loyalties and circumstances change. Do you believe this maid? Yeah, I do. I don't know the assigned detective. Britt. I bet Jeffries does. Britt was top shelf. Got killed in Camden trying to pick up a fugitive. So he's not the reason the job went cold. Uh-uh. And I remember this one. It made him crazy. The girl's mother would come in year after year, Britt never had anything for her. who'd he look at for the doer? The two brothers, one being the boyfriend. A live-in cook made the list. And, of course, some folks thought a gang of black kids must have come to Chestnut Hill that night. The boyfriend his top pick? Yeah, it was rumored he had been violent with her. Todd Whitley? Oh, yeah. Cocky little jerk, as I recall. From a society family. No one would talk about those boys. The old man was too powerful. Put up walls Britt couldn't even get past. Someone should read the job again. Maybe those walls are shakier now. How about you? I got a job. But Vera might get a sense of achivement out of it. You spoke to the maid, Lil. Only 'cause he stuck me with her. This job deserves another look and Vera doesn't have the type of personality to get anywhere with society people. You give Vera my triple, you're gonna find him in Della's freezer. Excuse me, is Evelyn Shelby here? I'm Evelyn. Hi. Lilly Rush. How'd you find this house? Well, I'm a Detective Homicide. Is it about someone who stayed here? No, um... it's about your daughter. A witness has come forward in her case. Someone who worked in the neighborhood. So you don't know anything. We have new direction. Look, I came into Homicide every August, for over 20 years. Eventually, I figured out that Detective Britt was too much of a gentleman to tell me to stop coming, that her case would never be solved. You can only hope so long. So I should just forget about Jill? How about Todd Whitley? Should I forget him, too? Todd was lovely to Jill. Really, I... hear he knocked her around. What's lovely about that? I still see Todd Whitley... and Melanie. They're married now. Melanie... Jill's best friend? They became close after she died. And I'm not interested in stirring up more accusations against him. Well, I'm reopening the case. I'm not saying don't do your job. It's just that no one's been able to solve it after all these years. And... and I-I just can't get pulled in again. What kind of person doesn't wanna solve her daughter's murder? Someone in a lot of pain? Well, she won't help me with Todd, she thinks he's a golden boy. And the best friend's married to him. That's a tight inner circle. So Jill's own mom isn't on board, who's this for? You working a dead case instead of our triple? Talk to him. Unsolved isn't dead, Las. And she's got direction. Don't you? Yeah, but I also got three murders at this restaurant. All right. Who else can you go to on this? Well, not Melanie. So I guess that leaves the brothers. What was their party line on the abuse? The party line was don't talk to the cops. Going out on the street, boss. Right. Neighborhood survey on Della's. You coming or not? Let me just work this one for one more interview, then I'm back. Great. All right, what's your play with the brothers? Well, Todd's a superstar lawyer now. Eric is more of a fringe case. Divorced, drinking problem, doesn't exactly work. Sounds like he's your first stop. Eric? Yeah? Detective Rush. I'm heading out. I have a meeting. There's a 1:00 in Old City. It's not that kind of meeting. Oh. Um..I'm..It'll just take a few minutes. It's about Jill Shelby. You were in school with her, right? Chelsea Day? I can't talk to you. How come? They treated my brother and me like suspects back then. Well, it was an open secret Todd was hitting Jill. He loved Jill. People hit people they love. I shouldn't say anymore. Maybe you could just tell me what she was like. She was nice. When you were alone with her, at least. When you weren't alone? I don't wanna speak ill of the dead. It's okay. I hear it every day. She'd ignore you. She ignore you that night? She was at her worst at parties. I see dollar signs, already, Charlie. That was a $50 value. Thank you! Come on, Jill. Tell us what a kiss from Eric's worth. I can't. He's Todd's brother. You've already kissed two other guys. I'm not into it. Come here, Eric. So she was kind of a bitch to you that night. She didn't mean it. That was the just way she got sometimes. Mmm. Anyway, I need to go. Oh, did you letter in high school? You look kind of athletic. One year. Wrestling. Todd Whitley. Lilly Rush. Have a seat, Lilly. Who'd you row for? Uh, Chelsea Day and Penn. I'm still on the water most mornings. Impressive. This is about Eric I assume. You don't seem too shocked he might be in trouble. Patterns of behavior, right? Recognize her? What is this? A homicide investigation. Look, that was painful for a lot of people. I suggest you leave it alone. I can't do that. It's an open case. Why did someone like you become a cop? Oh, bad education, limited talent. You should be married, living the good life. Well, no one ever asked. So here I am working a homicide. Well, as I told the cops at the time, I was with my brother all night. Actually, a lawyer told them that in a statement three weeks later. So? Look... my father owned half of Philadelphia. People like to see families like ours in trouble. We hired a lawyer. Maybe your kind of people don't do that... mine do. Even if there's nothing to hide? I can't help you anymore. I understand you're married to Melanie now. She can't help you either. Do you still have a problem with violence? I know you once hit Jill hard enough to give her three stitches and all. Everyone knew the cops had it in for me over Jill. They were wrong then, you are wrong now. Ever hit Melanie? All right, Lilly, you're right. Someone did beat the crap out of Jill on a regular basis. But It wasn't me. Her father was a real son of a bitch. You sure know how to find people. I thought you'd still be living in Chestnut Hill. I like the city. Did you find something? Autopsy records and medical records. And? I just don't understand these injuries Jill had before she died. Injuries? Broken rib when she was 12.... a concussion ... a jaw fracture at nine years old. What's the deal? She played field hockey and soccer. Uh-huh. She was very active. Evelyn, my ex-husband was a mean drunk. I know the difference between a soccer injury and a trip down the stairs. Did your husband beat your daughter? He was in Houston the night she died. That wasn't my question. He's been dead nine years. And now you work at a Shelter for battered women and children. Where did you get that? The case file. I took this picture. I don't see how you can just forget her, Evelyn. Forget? I think about her every day. This ruined my life. Then it still matters. I can't look back. It's too hard. So you sell your Chestnut Hill house, pack up your old life and-and think you can just walk away? You can't walk away from her, Eveylyn. She's a part of you. There's now hope now. And what if you don't solve it? Where does that leave me? What if I do solve it? My husband doesn't want me talking to you. Todd doesn't want you helping with your best friend's murder investigation? I thought we put this to rest. It's important to me, Melly. So you came to the party with Jill but left alone? I drank too much. I had to go home and I couldn't find her. You made a big point in your interview that you were sure it wasn't Todd. The detective made a big point of asking about him. He was fixated on the Whitleys, but barely looked at Tim Dorn. This is the cook? He lived in our guest house, and he was with the girls that night. When we left for the party, he told Jill she should come by later if she wanted. When I heard she was missing the next day, Tim was the first person I thought of. All this information and I got one page on the guy the mother and best friend think did it. You gotta listen to the best friend. Teenage girls tell each other everything. Well, Britt wrote two sentences on him, then blew him off. It's hard to tell if he even worked him hard enough. Especially when he had it out for Todd. Dorn's up in Frackville. Locked up? Why do you think he's gonna talk to you? I'm an optimist. Lil, I got a wife at home. You don't have to come. You think it's a dead case. Let me just call her. Five years for forgery. I got a facility for it, gets me into trouble. You ever dabble in more serious crime? Like the violence done to Jill Shelby? No, Ma'am. I'm strictly a cerebral criminal. Pretty attractive, wasn't she? She was pretty cute, for a girl. You did tell her to come over that night. She came over a lot to get high. She and her little vixen friend Melanie. Well, that little vixen thinks that you killed Jill. Well, if you marry the prime suspect I guess you better point to someone else. Jill's mom also thinks you did it. A woman lives in a certain world. If the shining neighbor boy killed her daughter, that world's a lie. Britt has your alibi down here as going to bed at 10:00. I guess he must have kept his word. Actually, I was with a... friend that night. What friend? Bobby Jordan. This big, luscious college boy down the street. Neither of us was exactly out and proud at the time, so we asked Britt not to document the sleepover. Bobby's gonna confirm that? Well, I imagine he's come to terms by now. Did Jill ever talk to you about Todd? Oh, sure. Those girls told me everything. Like what? Teenage drama. They even told me things they didn't tell each other. Like all the while Jill was fretting that Todd doesn't treat her right, Melanie was doing him on the side. You can't be here. Gate was open. My partner, Chris Lassing. How you doing? Todd is furious at you. Uh-oh. Thanks to you his brother came here last night, drunk, after six years of being sober. Eric did? Look, I've told you about Tim Dorn. Why do you have to keep bothering us? Dorn's alibi checked out. We know about you and Todd stepping out on Jill back then. I... I don't have to talk to you. We have to arrest you? You don't want that, Lady. You should see our holding cell. Your headband will get all dirty. Why does this matter? 'Cause when you tell us one lie, Melanie, even if it's small, that makes us think you're hiding other things. Like whatever Todd did to Jill that night. It wasn't Todd, okay? I know... because I was with him that night. That is some top. It's new. You look like, uh... What? A patriotic street walker. It was in Seventeen. Why do you have to be a jerk? Why don't you go and comfort her? You know, you could use some time in charm school. Could I? I could give you a tutorial... upstairs. What about Jill? What about her? I'm obviously not proud of it. It sounds like Eric had pretty strong feelings for Jill. So? So, why'd he fall off the wagon just 'cause Jill's name came up? Two million people in this city, I gotta run into you? You think I'm thrilled seeing you? All right, look, I'm sorry if I was obnoxious in your office. More than obnoxious. It's just the way that you were looking out for Eric. It was... I hear he's drinking again. Don't talk about Eric. Todd, I know that you were with Melanie that night. Excuse me? Which doesn't add up with you saying you were with Eric. So I figure that you just said that to protect him. Okay, let's say I was with Melanie that night. You can understand why I wouldn't want the entire world knowing that, right? Right. So why not just say that you were sleeping? Why give Eric an alibi? You should drop this. Eric did it. That's why you can sleep at night and have a normal life, and he's a mess. You should just watch it. When did the hard drinking start? After he killed her? I can make your life very difficult. Eric kills Jill... you clean up after him. Brother's keeper ever since. Am I close? Tell me something, Lilly. What is the point of all of this after so many years? People shouldn't be forgotten. Even if they are my kind of people. Maybe they don't have a lot of money, they don't have lawyers... but they matter. They should get justice, too. I see. You're a crusader. I guess I am. Good luck. So, is sleep like an optional thing for you? I'm not tired. Guess who weighed in on your case today? Mmm... the commissioner. The commissioner? Apparently he and the Whitley's father were college pals. Todd called Bradley to tattle on me? What a baby. And now Bradley's wondering when you're going back on the line. He couldn't pick me out of a line up. Suddenly he's tracking my career? Screw him. Don't say that too loud in this building. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rush... your boyfriend's downstairs. I'm single. You sure it's not your boyfriend? One of the Whitleys... booked for DUI. You crash that nice car of yours, Eric? Thanks to you. I had something to do with it? All I did was bring up Jill. Why's that send you on a bender? My brother called our lawyer, who called the commissioner, who's a very close family friend. I heard all about it. Then why don't you take a hint and back off? 'Cause something tells me you and I are one scotch away from a good conversation. Hey, Lil. Hey. Hey. Las is in with Evelyn Shelby. Huh. I kept my own box on Jill. It's been packed away for years, but I thought maybe it could help. Good. Melanie told me about her and Todd in high school, behind Jill's back. Well, she was only 15. Mrs. Shelby, it looks like we're closing in on Eric Whitley. The younger one? Yeah, well, he doesn't have an alibi for that night. And, uh, he was pretty sick in love with your daughter. I was looking at her yearbook, and I remembered this boy. Ann Winters' son. A few years after Jill died he said something to Ann about the Whitleys getting away with murder. Why isn't this in the file? Well, it should be. John told it to the police. What's the kid name? Charlie Winters. If Britt talked to him I'd have a  record of it. He was meticulous. Well, are you sure your husband mentioned it to Britt? He told me he did. Could he have lied, Evelyn? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hounded him about it. He said it came to nothing. That I should stop brining it up. Stop pointing fingers at the Whitleys. They were a powerful family. I guess we both know what it's like to have a husband fail you. We'll find Charile Winters, Evelyn. We'll talk to him, and we'll let you know what he says. Thanks for coming out. I can't really leave the retreat. Sure. It's about Jill Shelby. So, now you wanna hear? Yeah, you told the cops you didn't see anything. Yeah, at first. But then I came to the Shelbys with some good information, and I got the brush-off. You come stoned in your VW van? So? Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's the one who told us about you. Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay? I tried to help her years ago. She wouldn't hear it. You're right, Charlie, but she's not afraid now, and we wanna hear. Okay. I was, um... Kind of passed out on a lounge chair. How could this happen? Just shut up. Why'd you have to wear this? What? It's ruined. That's what you were thinking about? That stupid jacket? Just leave things to me. So, they... got in their car and left, and, man, I just got the hell out of there. Why'd Eric care so much about the jacket? There was this... one year that Eric did wrestling, and... Todd couldn't wrestle to save his life. I think it was the only thing that... he could do better than Todd. Hi. How was it? Good. I need a couple of minutes. I... I have to tell you something that's gonna be hard to hear. Todd was seen with the murder weapon that night. But I was with him. You were asleep after drinking all night. He could've got out of bed later. This is the father of my children. He was involved with a murder, Melanie, that's someone that you don't know very well. Well, maybe he was just covering up for Eric. Even if that's all he did, that's accessory to murder. I wanna tell you something... but if I do, I can't go home. I can help you with that. They're talking every night. They're arguing. Todd keeps telling Eric to stay away from Tabby's. What's that? They have an aunt, Tabitha. She has a house in Chestnut Hill. It was... it was close to where we all used to live. Pack a bag for you and the kids. You're coming with me. Hey. Where's my wife? Safe. Hey, bitch, you tell me where she is. Is this how you handle women you can't control? This supposed to scare me? It's supposed to make you think. I'm not like the girls you're used to, Todd. You can't try to charm me, then when that doesn't work, talk down to me, then when that doesn't work, get aggressive. I'm not Jill or Melanie. I'm the police, and we're at the police headquarters, you moron. You gonna talk to me like that? What are you gonna do? Kill me in the parking lot of Central? You think you'll get away with it again? I know about Tabby's. I'll have a warrant tomorrow, and guys are sitting on it right now. Whatever you hid there, we're about to find it. So it's over. Okay. I can't protect him anymore. I did as much as I could. Why don't you come in, give me a statement? Okay. Flipped on his brother. Do you believe him? I don't know. I gotta find Eric. No meeting tonight, huh? Screw the meetings. Scotch and soda. Look, I can't talk to you. My brother chewed me out the day you came by. Really? 'Cause he's been talking to me a lot. Yeah, well, I guess he puts himself in a different category. He told me about you and Jill, and... that you were in love with her. She was his girlfriend. Oh, she'd hang around with you when, uh... no one was around, but drop you the second Todd showed up. Look, I already told you that she was like that. And that he found you two together that night. Look, I said I couldn't talk to you. What happened to your letter jacket, Eric? I don't know. Another. I don't think there's time for another. I have to arrest you. He told me you did it, and that you came to him for help afterwards, and you two buried the racket at your aunt's house. Why would I kill her? Because she humiliated you. She accused you of watching them. Oh, my God. So what, he's pinning it on me now? It's his story against yours. And you're the problem drunk who never got his life together, so if you have anything to give me,, you should do it now. Look, he ruined my jacket. He got his blood all over it. Hers, too. You didn't throw it out, did you? And Jill didn't humiliate me. He did. Hi, gorgeous. Where were you? Well, you can't really ask me that. That's my jacket. So you finally got a taste of her, huh? Now you have something real to jerk off to. Todd. Huh, have you seen him in the window watching us have sex? That's crazy. Up in the tree with his hand down his pants. Stop. Please. Well, you're the one who just screwed him. I didn't screw him. Give me some credit. I saw you all pressed up to him. Only 'cause you were off with Melanie. Just stop talking. Asshole. Bitch. Don't. Shut up! You're so pathetic. And you're such a prick. You shut your mouth. Screw you. Hey, slut... I said shut your mouth. # Creedence Clearwater Revival ÀÇ "Have You Ever Seen The Rain" # # Someone told  me long ago # # There's a calm before the storm # # I know # # It's been coming for some time # # When it's over, so they say # # It'll rain a sunny day # # I know # # Shining down like water # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yesterday and days before # # Sun is cold and rain is hard # # I know # # Been that way for all my time # # Till forever # # On it goes # # Through the circle, fast and slow # # I know # # It can't stop, I wonder # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yeah # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day #
