- Dad,it's slipping. {a6}October 17,2006 - Honey,let me help you. - It's okay. Exercise. It's good for me. King Warlord strikes again! Why is it guns all the time? I'm getting him karate lessons. Awesome! - How much are those? - I don't know. Not much. Probably not a lot. I knew a lot of kids who took 'em in Ohio. We can manage,Adam. Your job starts tomorrow. Don't need a pep talk,Emily. Honey? Are you gonna get the rest of the boxes out of the truck? Just give me a second,will ya? I need one second for my stuff,okay? Remember the night of the tornado in Cincinnati? Mom made us all sleep in the basement. No. We stayed up all night. Made popcorn. It was fun. Remember,Dad? Yeah. Gonna be a lot easier life here,guys. I promise. Pop... pop... Help me. Family massacre. Mom,Dad and son shot and killed. Dad's prints were all over the gun. The Jacobis. Dad was an out-of-work computer programmer. Looked like he was the doer. It was a John List kind of thing. The older kid,the daughter,survived a bullet to the head. Can't decide if that's lucky or not. You're alive,but you got to face knowing your dad tried to off you. We could never confirm the father was the doer, but now that Kim's awake and talking... Your boss wants a statement. Doctor says Kim's memory is spotty, but we can try. Boss wants to close the case. Meaning the DA wants himself on the front page with his arm around little orphan Kim and us doing the work for him. We can't all have bosses like yours. Hey. I'm Ed. Been working with Kim for the last five months. Detective Rush and Valens. - How's she doing? - Lot better since she came to a few weeks ago. Real progress. Hi,Kim. We need to talk to you about what happened the night of the shooting. Kim... was it your father who did this to you? He loved you. Your mom,too. - How do you know that? - I can see it in these photos. I don't really remember that night. I'm sorry. You were in the house with your family. Do you remember what you were doing? - Is she okay? - Kim,I'm right here. Was there a fight? Your father get upset about something? I don't remember! No,don't. Dad. - Please. - No! Always. Romeo. Kim,look at me. You sure you saw your father's body before you were shot? Means the dad wasn't the shooter. Maybe she should rest. Okay. I'm sorry,Kim, for putting you through that. Someone else was in that house that night. Someone calling themselves Romeo. Left a witness behind. Witness who's starting to remember. www.ydy.com proudly presents</font> sync:¸¡¸¡ Cold Case Season 4 Episode 24</font> Gun was registered to Adam. Prints on it were his. The Jacobis were on the verge of bankruptcy. Adam had recently lost an IT job in Cincinnati. Dad moved the family to Philly for work. Got fired a month later. Neighbor said Adam was depressed. Original investigation found the family computers behind the house, all smashed up,hard drives erased. - Presumably by Adam. - I can relate to that part. Let's get those computers. Maybe the Tech Unit can find something pointing to our shooter. Lil do the interview with you this morning,Scotty? Said she was stopping at home on her way back. Had a dream you were reading to me. Your favorite book when you were a kid. I can't remember the name. Brought you some lunch. Came back from work for that? Didn't want you going hungry,complaining nonstop. Mom,you okay? Yeah,I'm fine. Go on now before they wise up and fire you. You call me if you need anything. - You got my cell,right? - Yeah,yeah,I'm fine,so go. Go. Go get 'em,Lilly. The Velveteen Rabbit. That was the book. Made me read it a million times. The stuffed rabbit who wanted to be real, and the boy he belonged to. He became real,remember? When the boy let him go. Bet he missed him for the rest of his life. That stubborn old thing came back. Make sure the boy was okay. - He did? - Couldn't keep him away. Go on now,Lilly. Bye,Mom. Bye,baby. So you're the one who found the bodies,Mr. Reed? Our kids were pals. We shared a carpool. Waited in the driveway 20 minutes, then I went in. Is it true that the wife was the family's main breadwinner? Dental hygienist,plus parent in charge. - Kids didn't listen to Adam? - The daughter didn't listen, not when it came to that boyfriend of hers. Boyfriend? That wasn't in the report. You ever meet this guy? No. But one morning,it was my turn to drive the kids to school, and,as usual,the Jacobis were late. Adam,my hands are full. Please,just get his lunch ready. Hey. I just found something on this computer. We need to have a family discussion,young lady. - I found your online chats. - What online chats? That's none of your business. Don't read her e-mail. You are too young to write those... things to that boyfriend. Me and Rick don't talk online,Dad. We need to meet this Rick. And have you guys fight in front of him? No way. Martin and Jeff are here! What's taking you guys so long? I was just,uh... So,ready? No more computer for you,Kim. And no more cell phone. Adam,come on. Emily,if you'd read them you wouldn't trust her either. You know,just because you're miserable, Dad,doesn't mean the rest of us have to be. Teenagers. Glad I've got that to look forward to. Where'd Kim meet this boyfriend? School,I guess. Adam said the kid called at all hours,wouldn't leave his name. You ever hear Kim refer to him as "Romeo"? No. I did see him once,though, from my living room,at night. He was skulking around the Jacobis' house. Getting ready for a balcony scene? Rick Lambert? Detectives Jeffries,Rush. I didn't do it. Want to talk to you about your girlfriend Kim Jacobi. Whoa. The new girl that got shot? She was,uh, not my girlfriend. Her family thought different. Oh,man. Kim had the wrong idea about us. How so? I was breaking in the new girl. "Friends with benefits" is what it's called. Youth of today- real inspiration. We know about the online messages you two were exchanging. Nah,not me. Me and my mom don't have a computer. You think Kim could've been chatting with some other guy? Mmm,yeah. Name "Romeo" mean anything to you? Oh That's the dude finally spoke her language. - And what language is that,Rick? - You know,feelings. - What the hell is this? - It's not from you? Uh,no. And you better not be telling people it is. Well... you're the only person I know at this school. Read the frickin' card,yo. It's got hearts on it. "I'm the only one who knows the real you, "how unhappy you've been,Kim,for a long time now. - I've watched... " - Give it back,Rick! "I've watched you at school,"outside your house. "In fact,I'm watching you right now. " Um... ...stalker. "Always,Romeo. " "Always,Romeo. " Kim was needy. She was loving that card with all the sentiments and what not. Thanks for your insights,Rick. Hey,wish I could tell you more,but... Right,you're not her boyfriend. So maybe those online chats really weren't between Kim and Rick. They were between her and a secret admirer. Romeo Tech Unit recovered the shadow drives of the Jacobi computers. It's a mess,but they found the messages Adam was mad about. - Who was Kim writing to? - Montague01. That's Romeo. - I know my Shakespeare. - Same guy who Kim claims shot her. Messages go on for a month,then all online communication stops. - Week later,he sends her the rose. - What's that? Photo Kim sent him. High school insignia. Could be how he tracked her,sent her the flower. These two would chat for hours. All this soul-baring stuff. This guy's rap is they're like Romeo and Juliet,meant to be together. It's fate. - Did Kim respond to that? - Yep, till his messages took a turn for the loony a few weeks before the murders. "I see you crying in your bathroom at night. "Your family brings you so much pain. "If they were gone,we could love each other wholly. 'Violent delights have violent ends. '" He's offering to get rid of her family. Declaration of his love. She stopped returning his messages at that point. But maybe it was too late. Romeo decided to take out the Capulets. "Romeo,Romeo,wherefore art thou...?" I knew the man who shot my family? You talked to him on the computer every night for months. Told him you were lonely. Lonely? You ever meet him? Romeo I don't think I'd do that. He watched you some nights. Outside the house. Saw you crying in the bathroom. Bathroom? - I used to hide there. - Hide? From what? I remember steam on the windows. I could hear voices. - I wanted to disappear. - What were you hiding from,Kim? I tried to call someone,but I didn't have any friends. Because you don't tell me what's going on with you and I'm trying to help! Just figure this out alone! Did you like the rose? - Who are you? - did you? I liked the card. I'm sorry your parents are fighting. I'm used to it. I know you wanted to call someone and cry, but there was no one to call. How'd you know I wanted to call someone? Because... I'm watching you. I see you. Sort of. I'm your Romeo. Come to rescue you. Why do you care? I mean,why do you like a girl you've never even met? 'Cause... I understand you. Wanting somebody to really ask you how you are and care about the answer. I want that,too. How are you,Romeo? Better... than I used to be. I'm in love. Really? - Draw an arrow through it. - Why? Cupid's bow. - Good night,Kim. - Don't go. I can't believe I talked to him like that. You saw red and yellow lights in the yard? Stuart's laser gun had red lights. Yellow lights could've been from another gun. - Maybe he had a friend over. - Neighbor's kid? Could be he got a look at Romeo. I know that wasn't easy. Thanks. Who sent this? I don't know. It was him,wasn't it? Put a police detail on Kim 'round the clock. - Any luck tracking Romeo? - Canvas at the school was a bust. No high schoolers using his moniker? And no luck tracing the Jacobis' phone records to our stalker. Looking into their personal cells now. Thanks for coming back in, Martin. Sure You and Stuart played laser tag in the front yard at nights? - Am I in trouble? - Now why would you be in trouble? Jeff,if you have something to tell us about the Jacobis we won't get mad. Um... the night that Stuart died, I went over to his house. - What? - To play laser tag. And you saw someone outside the house? No. Someone inside. - Jeff! - Gotcha. Now you got to get me. It's late,guys. We're all hittin' the hay. - I can watch them if you want to go to bed,Em. - Oh,you said you were tired. What the hell is that? Oh,my God. Look,Dad. Who did this,Kim? Romeo,I think. Romeo? - Is that who you were messaging? - I never messaged anybody,Dad! I saw your screen name,Kim,and now he's been in our house; you need to stop lying to me! She's not! Kim didn't send those messages. I did. Why didn't you tell me? Emily was posing as her own daughter on the Internet? And she brought the stalker into her home - Hey. - Hi. Any luck tracking the slide show on the Jacobis' computer? Nope. Romeo's a hacker pain in the ass. - Got something off of Kim's cell phone. - One she wasn't supposed to be using? Teenage girls don't listen to their parents. That's good news for us. She made a call,night of the shooting. To Romeo? No,to her friend with benefits. Rick. - Homeslice forgot to mention that. - Right. - Hey,you see Lilly this morning? - No. Everything is okay? Door's unlocked. My mom died. Last night. Uh,no,Lil. I found her... she was alone... when... I sat here... with her. She was so... still. She called the office... I told her to call my cell... if she had... she... wouldn't died alone. Lil,you gotta know it wasn't your fault. - I should been here,scotty. - Lil,you did everything you could. Never say goodbye. I'm here for you, anything. You know that. Just wanna be alone now,okay? Yeah. When you need me, just say, "hey" I'll be there. Kim called you the night of the murder. - Got the phone records. - I didn't kill anybody. You saying that ain't quite good enough for us,Rick. - She called me. You're right. - Yeah,we know. She was crying about her family. So you head over there thinking she's vulnerable,up for some easy play? That is not why I went to her house. Then,why'd you go,genius,the night of the murders? 'Cause she was crying and I wanted to make sure she was okay. She was a really sweet girl. You know,I... Don't say you liked her. I kind of got attached,okay? Kim was a good person. Maybe she was a little depressed, but her parents,like,ignored her. - Sounds like you're defending her,Rick. - Why would you have to defend Kim? Like I said,she was depressed. get rid these danm computers. I'm sorry,Adam. I'm sorry,Kim. - It's okay,Mom. - No. No,honey. You don't have to tell your mother that putting you,putting all of us in da... Dad,stop! Don't let your daughter think this is okay. I went on the site thinking... maybe I'd connect with some old friends. Okay. Okay. And... I went to make my profile and all of the pictures of me were... And I don't want to be this person whose husband doesn't think she's appealing anymore, and her kids think she's boring and annoying, so... I used to look like you. I used to be so happy and vibrant like you. Is that what you think? That I'm happy? Well,yes. You don't know me. Only Romeo really knows me. Honey? Kim had a gun? She tried to talk to me sometimes about how... bad she felt. And I only made things worse. I could have helped her and... Maybe the Jacobis would have lived. Lil,I heard. I'm so sorry. I need to be here. Keep busy. Kim come with me. Sit here. It'll be a while. Ever read Romeo and Juliet? Crazy kids,those two. Do anything for love. Kind of like you. I don't understand. Well,Rick saw you with the gun. Gun? What are you saying? Is that the real reason you can't remember? 'Cause you don't want to? Why are you saying this? I would never do anything bad to them. Your mom put your photo on the Internet, pretended to be you. That's crazy. Your family didn't know you. They didn't even try. I didn't hate my family. I wouldn't hurt them. No? How do you know? I wanted to hurt myself... not them. Kim. Oh,my God! Adam! What? - I thought it was locked up. - There was someone in the house,so I took it out. - Kim,sweetheart... Stuart,go to your room. - No,let him stay. We can't stand to watch the two people we love most in the world tear each other apart. So you're tired from work or you need work. Is that more important than our family? - Fix your problem. - It's not that simple,Kim. We were happy before once. Remember that time in Cincinnati? The tornado. Maybe we should make some popcorn. That's a good idea. I'll do it. I know where it is. Dad! You saw him,Kim. You know who he is,don't you? Who is he? You're not going to take her from me. Not again. Hey! I'll kill her before I let you do it. I'll kill all of you. No one's going to get hurt,Ed. We're going to work it out. Shut up! Put your handcuffs on now. Cuff yourselves to the door. You,file cabinet. You,take the keys! Now! Come on. Let's go,lady. - Get his keys! - I'm going as fast as I can. I said shut up! Listen to me,Ed. I want to help you. I don't want anyone getting hurt. You understand? Give me the keys now. Get me a helicopter on the roof. I can make that happen, but it's going to take time. And I need to make a call. We got a situation in Homicide. I need to talk to your tactical commander. Get the sharpshooters into position. Third floor,east side. Hostage taker's a guy named Ed Marteson. Just got texted by someone inside. Marteson smuggled a.38 in with the wheelchair. It's Vera again. "Hostage taker at southeast window. " Southeast window. If your field of fire is clean,take the shot. - Hey,you miss,you're going to kill one of ours. - Back off,Detective. Let me do my job. That's why I got that job,Kim. To be close to you. So my face'd be the first you saw when you woke up. Ed,listen to me now. Let the others go. I'll stay. No! No one is going anywhere. SHARP SHOOTERS IN POS.GET DOWN. Do you feel happy now?

To your right. Hey! Hey! I hate liars. - You're gonna die. - She doesn't love you! She doesn't love you. She didn't even write those e-mails. You want to say that again? Shots fired from inside. One hostage down. White male,50s. - That's our lieutenant. - Stand down. Stand down. - I told you not to fire,you idiot. - You understand I outrank you?! Let go of me! - I'm getting in there. - What about him? Screw that guy. Lil. - They lied to you. But I won't. - Get away from me. Listen,you got to get away from those windows or they'll kill you. There's no windows in there. You'll be safe. - You're coming,too. - You don't need her. I'm going. There's a room behind that. It's safer. You better not be lying to me. They can see you in here. There,they can't. Come in and I'll kill them both! Shut the door. John. ??? Nick hurry up Bullet weakly troughed. Let's get a dress. Hang in there, boss. Hey.Where's Lil? in there I used to be an EMT. Which means I knew how to care for you when you got hurt. You got to know that it's fate with us. Look I have to make a call. Put it down. You want to get out of here,right? They're gonna come in if I don't call. Trust me. OK? I need a helicopter on the roof right now. We're outside the interview rooms.? You can't see in here,so... don't try anything. You're not in the interview rooms? You're in observation? That's what I said. What do you want me to do? Hey. You hear me? Hey. You want me to come in? Get him to turn away from the two-ways and stay down. - They're,uh...They're on their way. - You're lying. Maybe I should just kill you now! Why do you take such good care of someone who doesn't love you? She does. You're trying to make her into a different person who loves you the way you want to be loved, but it's not gonna happen. She wrote things to me. but you don't know. See... you hold on to the good things, but there were bad things,too. Right,ed? she rejected you. She rejected you. - That's not true. - Well,you shot her. Why do you think you did that? She called me her romeo. Promised to love me forever. But she lied. It's me. - It's me-- romeo. - Dad! No one ever rescued me from my family, but I'm gonna do it for you because I love you,kim. No,don'T...! - Don't! - Please! No! Oh,my god,adam! Mom! You've caused her so much pain. - But not anymore. - No,it's not true! Don't do it. Don'T. You-you can take me. You can take me, but just let my kids out,okay?
