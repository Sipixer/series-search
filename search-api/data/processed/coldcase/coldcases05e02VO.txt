allowed me to do so, I would tell you how these methods of birth control can be used, and what they do. But I cannot. I will be fired, so... Oh, ain't no thing, Miss Danbury. Carrie Swett can tell us. Ha. But can't you teach us about abstinence? That's legal, right? Oh, what do you need to know about it, Quinn? You live it. If you refrain from sexual intercourse, a practice known as abstinence, you will not get pregnant. And if you feel you can't abstain, well, let me give you a hint. These items on this sheet here might help. Yeah, Miss Danbury. Is it true that oral copulation isn't sex? That is so not true. And President Clinton is a liar. It's not technically. Yes, I'd like to hear from an expert. Shut up! Jerry! Okay, well, it's a form of sexual activity, yes. Whether or not you consider it as... You know what? I can't talk to you about this. But it's current events! Come on. You can't get pregnant from oral sex, but you can get STDs, so please be careful. Please. Or you'll end up like Carrie Swett. Jerry Wood, out! Now! Saved! Kidding, Swett. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£ºdingding Â¼ÖÆ£º¸öÈËID</font> I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie. Not a single time, never. These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you. You got here fast. You, too. We've been up all night. What's your excuse? Uh, late night with friends. You? What? I got a life. Yeah, right. You see Gordon at the office this morning? IAD guy? Thought he was done. Wants Scotty for round two. What's the deal with the van? Abandoned. Junkies been using it. Southeast does a search for narcotics, this turns up in the wheel well. Belonged to Carrie Swett. 15-year-old girl, assaulted and left for dead in Fairmount Park back in '98. Found partially nude. Blunt force trauma to the head. That area-- kids get busy there. Not that I remember. That was a theory. Lovers Lane turned ugly. Oh, Carrie had herself some boyfriends. Oh, that kind of 15. Hmm. So, who owns the van? Last and only registered owner is a Walter Peranski. Custodian at Carrie's high school. Wow. So, Carrie was pretty much open for business. Job gives this guy opportunity. Maybe her reputation gives motive. Think a janitor would know how to clean up after himself. -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Æ¬Ãû µÚ5¼¾µÚ2¼¯</font> Carrie Swett, 15, beat to death in Fairmount Park. Only child. Dad's in Ohio, out of the picture. Mother, Sheila, tends bar at a dive in Kensington. Says Carrie went out for a soda, 7:00 p.m. May 17. Didn't come back. No murder weapon at the site. ME says skull fractures are irregular, caused by a heavy rock. Carrie's shirt's off, but no signs of a sex crime. Doer couldn't close the deal, gets embarrassed, lashes out? Could be Carrie rebuffed him. Well, CSU flagged her footprints. Oh, she fought, tried to run. Yeah, looks like it. Carrie's wearing a ring on her wedding finger. Engraved with the name Timothy and a heart. Who's Timothy? Never found him. Guys they interviewed in '98 laughed at the idea of buying her a ring. They said,"I didn't take a dime to get her ready to go." Nice. Someone did care about Carrie enough to buy her this ring. Maybe. But then, where's he been all these years? Boss? You got a sec? I made an appointment with the shrink. Good. Know you weren't happy, me not keepin' it together. Well, it's required. You're mad I went in the room with him. Ed. I shouldn't have let it happen. You were shot. Nothing you could have done. It was my house, my guys. It wasn't your fault. It shouldn't have been you, Lil. Let me know when you're done your counseling. I swear to God, this is a mistake. Sit down, Wally. I-I never done anything illegal. What about ditchin' your van?ou It-it broke down. I didn't want to pay for a tow. Listen, what happened to that girl is a terrible thing, but it wasn't me! You know about Carrie Swett's reputation? Girl like that puts it on the glass. She's asking for it. She had very low self-respect, I thought. Yeah. She gave it out to everybody, huh? Why not you, right, Wally? She was a kid. Don't be perverted. How did Carrie Swett's shirt wind up hidden in your van, huh? Somebody put it in there. We look like idiots to you? No. Maybe... Hmm? Maybe...? The baseball team,the captain. I used to let him go in there with girls, you know. Frisky business during the lunch hour. Slow down. And this one time... Take a breath. I saw him with Carrie Swett. One time, I saw him go into my van with her! Who was this guy? He was captain of the baseball team back in '98. Uh... Uh, Jerry Wood. Jerry Wood. And you let himfor gettin' busy? I didn't think he was killin' anybody! Look, you got to believe me. No. I-I thought it was heavy petting. That's what I thought. We'll look into the guy, Wally. Just don't go thinking your ass is in the clear. I won't. You used to get busy with Carrie Swett back in high school? Yeah. Why? We're looking into a theory. Been talking to some guys. And there were a lot of guys. Hmm? Yeah. True. We heard she liked it rough. You know, maybe one of these guys is trying to give Carrie what she wants accidentallydeoes too fars could happen. So, how was she, when you two were hitting it, kinky? She was pretty boring, actually. Lots of kissy-kissy, blah, blah. I tried to mix it up once. yeah? How did that go? About the fourth time we had done it, brought her to this van in the parking lot. We found her shirt in that van. And when Carrie's dead body was found, no shirt. You get how that's adding up? Whoa. I didn't kill her. Whatappened in the van? It was just a prank. I shouldn't even be here after what you said in health class I'm sorry. Don't be mad. If you like me, why can't you be nice to me? 'Cause I'm complicated. Me, too. So, why isn't your shirt off, pretty girl? Do you care about me at all? I do. I think you're really different from other girls. In a good way? In a beautif way In a beautif way What was that? Is that a leopard print bra? Oh. We were just kidding! Wait! She runs away like a freakin' track star, so I ditched the shirt. Romantic guy like you-- you ever call the girl again, take her into the woods? The ghThshe , I had an away game. You're a Grade D slice of jackass, Jer. Better hope your alibi holds up. S The shirt we found had Carrie's name in it. She used to do that, so I wouldn't borrow her clothes. Didn't stop me. You see this picture? Hmm. Pretty girl. Real open-hearted. Sheila, you know if Carrie was hanging out with anybody from the baseball team? Here we go. Carrie and  the boys She was a pretty girl. People paid attention. But if you're implying that what happened to her in those woods was her fault. That's not what we're saying. We just want to know who she was spending time with. Like I told you guys all along, she was a teenager. She didn't exactly share the details with her ma. But I knew something was up. Meaning what? S Someone, something was making her change. I need new clothes. I'm sick of people looking at me all the time. They look 'cause you're adorable. Not adorable. S Sexy. I'm not the kind of girl you marry. First off, you're way too young for marriage-- That's not what I'm saying. Mom, don't you get sick of guys whistling at you and looking at your chest? You got a woman's body. I don't want it. Look, just ignore the boys. And don't let anyone treat you how you don't like. There's Tina. I gotta go. Uh, just exactly what are you guys doing here on a Saturday? Mom, it'Sthing. We just want to hang out and I don't haveo tell you everything! Sheesh. I didn't know it was an FBI secret. I love you, Care-bear! It kills me that she didn't know how special she was. Hmm. So, Carrie was going to school on a Saturday. T1 Who was this Tina? Never brought her around. I don't kno' Girls were never very nice to Carrie. Yeah. Thanks, Sheila. Every year on her birthday, I light candles and make a wish. Maybe this year, you guys'll find who did it, and my wish will come true. Found her. Friend Carrie's mom described. Tina Quinn. Oh, there's your Timothy. The guy from Carrie's ring? He's in the picture? Book from the Bible. Timothy. "Flee also youthful lusts; "but follow righteousness, "faith, charity,peace, "with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart." Hearts Wait Club. Tina's the president. What's that about? Fleeing youthful lusts, apparently. It's a purity ring. Carrie's ring. Purity, like... Like, till I'm married, this finger belongs to God, and so does my virginity. Veronica's babysitter has one. Doesn't stop her from getting busy on my couch, though. So, Carrie Swett was meeting this Tina on Saturdays to go to the chastity club. School prude's trying to reform the tramp. Guess there was a guy in Carrie's life after all. ??????????????? I've been talking to everyone. ecing together a complete picture of the hostage situation on May 12th. Right. Which is what we did last time. So, you fired your weapon, uh, let's see-- three times intending to take out Ed Ruzio. Oh, I did take him out. When you fired your weapon, what was your line of sight? I already told you. I was on the blind side of a two-way mirror. Rush and I had a verbal cue. She could see me, so that's how I got him. What was the verbal cue? It was "Hey." "Hey?" And when did you establish this verbal cue? It was, uh, that morning. In her apartment. What were you doing in your partners apartment? In the morning? Her mother died. I was checking in on her. I had time saved up, don't worry. Does your Lieutenant know that you violated the perimeter established by SWAT when you came upstairs the evening of May 12th? Yeah. You do disobey orders often, Detective Valens? What are you talking about? You know, like when you told Mitch Hathtcay that his son was molested and murdered by Cliff Burrell. Who told you that? You sent a murderer on a vigilante mission th  early ended in a man getting thrown off a roof. S Is that in my record? Oh, I can't tell you that. Only supervisors have access to personnel files. Have you ever had counseling for your anger problem? Screw you. Go find out who stole the quarters from the piggy bank. Carrie Swett. I think about that all the time. So tragic. She was a member of your virginity club? Hearts Wait Club. She came to a few meetings, sure. How's a girl like Carrie wind up at your club I asked her in the hall one day. You didn't have to have your V-card. That like Amex? You could revirginize. Take a vow and erase the past. Carrie was really into that. I can't imagine how hard it is to be a girl right now. ??????????????? and you see singers and actresses giving it up for free. How about us? Trying to stay strong when even the President can't. And that's why we're here. Because it's easier, I think, to make a commitment and stay strong with other people by your side. Definitely. Like a diet. Nathan, I don't know why anyone isn't talking about "that woman," Monica Lewinsky. My father was seduced by a girl like that, who knew hT1s married. Why would someone do that? I know why. You're lonely.. You want affection. And you think that after, it'll be different. They'll like you. And do they? No. And usually you don't even like yourself. God sees you,esand He doesn' S He forgis the things that you regret. diI y.di I want You can.ver.T1 ??????????? Nathan Nathan O'Doell. w You We loved him. He was only 22, but we thought he was very grown up. HeS Yeah. You went to his office, took your puty oath. After hours? It was you, Nathan and God. It wasn't weird. No, nothing weird about that. Nathan O'Donnell? Philly PD. Got a few questions we'd like to ask. Sure. Carrie Swett. Oh. I rememberer, of course. Why don't you come downtown with us, take us down Memory Lane? Wait, I, um... She attended a handful of Hearts Wait Club meetings, but I didn't, I didn't really know her. So, just a coincidence you left the school a month after Carrie was murdered? No, actually. It was rattling. Made me ly search ers. come on,let's go too'st,I remember the thing changed in the groop just before she was killed Changed how? I-I don't know if this means anything, but, um, that last meeting, the mood was weird, and Carrie was different. What do you mean? I used to have them share secrets. It was a trust exercise. But, uh, Carrie stopped trusting us. Sometimes  like I don't work out enough. And I'm gross. Okay. I think my parents are mad I don't do more extracurriculars. Um... I don't know. I guess I feel like nobody knows me truly. Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed with life, I want to go sleep and never wake up. Those are your deep, dark secrets? i thought this club was about trust and being  your true self. Why aren't you guys being real? What about when you have something in your mind nd at you can't share? God can lift that weight off your shoulders. Write down something that only God can hear. are you sure no one's gonn I 'sure. Noheyou' don't i'll see you next week Oh, my God. No. Carrie? She read that thing, turned pale as a ghost. You're saying she read one of these kids' secrets. You still got that can? ? No, it was, it was years ago. I threw it away. Didn't want to see what Carrie read? No, I... I guess I was thinking, "How serious could a teenager's secret really be?" Well, whatever it was, Carrie was dead that night. ?????????????? Our Hearts Wait Club kids are all here, boss. One of these do-gooders took out Carrie Swett 'cause she found out their secret. Not very Christian of them. At the very least, they might have something on each other, so remind them it's not high school anymore. Put on the heat, they'll probably snitch on each other in a second. My secret was about how I felt strange about sex. I had guilt issues. Big deal. I was raised Catholic. Laurie, we think someone killed Carrie for a secret she read. We were kids. That's crazy. Is it? You're saying nobody in that group had something to hide. There were things you just didn't talk about... but Carrie did. Like what? Have you spoken with Phil DiPreta? You think we should? No one else thought it was a secret-- how Phil was-- but he did. One time, after the first meeting Carrie came to, she made a big mistake. Whoo! Yeah, I'm trying to swear off guys, too, especially that one. What? Come on. I know you're afraid to just tell the club, but you should just be honest. I am honest. I don't know what you mean. Sorry, I got to go. It's okay to be gay. What? Shut up. Oh, sorry, I... I am not-- I am not that! You're just some nobody, so shut your mouth. Phil's gay? No. Ask him. He'll tell you it's the biggest sin there is. You're saying Carrie was off base. I am married with two kids. What do you think? So it didn't bother you, her calling you a gay? Yeah, of course it did. So maybe you two get into a fight, it gets out of hand. No. No way. Laurie said you were livid, says you're against all that stuff. Laurie? Well, of course Laurie would tell you to talk to me. She got something against you? She had something against Carrie. Her and Manny. The boyfriend? Pretended to be Mary and Joseph, so perfect. But that's not the case? And Carrie Swett knew all about it. Are you okay? I'm freaked out. What's wrong? Did you have a fight with Manny? How do you know if you're pregnant? You can't be pregnant. You guys don't... No, we do. I know, I'm a terrible person. I say I won't, and then when we're together I want to. No, you just need to use protection. He won't talk about it. After we do it, he cries. Why? You guys are in love. I think you're lucky. I'm not. I'm dirty. What are you guys talking about? You told her, didn't you? It's okayManny. Don't... talk to my girlfriend ever again or I'll make you pay. So Manny didn't want anyone to know about them knocking boots? He was the most repressed, controlled person ever, and that can poison you on the inside. I think. Carrie Swett knew that you and Laurie were making a mockery out of the club. Had a pregnancy scare? I was ashamed of that. We were lucky it was just a scare. Ashamed enough to pick Carrie off, let your secret die with her? Not at all. I slipped, yes. Sure did... a few times. I lost my way in high school, but I found my way back through God. Seems like once Carrie showed up, quite a few of you "lost your way." Anything you'd like to get off your chest, Manny? I usually try to stay away from female drama, but one time after school I saw something kind of weird. Carrie! Don't just run away from me. I don't get it. You made me feel like I was the bad... Carrie, come back. Carrie! You're looking for love in the wrong place. You're just like me. I am nothing like you. It was wrong and I am telling. No one will believe you. You're just some slut with a whore for a mother. After Carrie died, Tina kind of went funny. What do you mean? She walked around, like, with her hair all dirty and not talking to anybody. You don't think she was just mourning her friend? They weren't friends. Tina's friends play by her rules or they don't play at all. Carrie was done. No. No, I am not a person who yells. I am not a person who shoves. That is not me. Witness saw you, Tina. You were looking for love in the wrong place. Maybe you didn't deserve that ring? I was a virgin until my wedding night. You cannot slander my character. And where'd you say your hubby was now? He's in Iraq. Oh, Tina. You just tell yourself lies, don't you? We got the papers from the courthouse. He filed for an annulment three months ago. He says the marriage was never consummated. Can't let go of that purity pledge, huh, Tina? That's none of your business. What happened to you? Why are you stuck in time like the club never ended? Some kind of trauma? Yeah... actually, but you guys don't even see it. I've been having these... thoughts and dreams and I'm not sure if it's the devil inside of me or if it's God guiding me or what. What kind of thoughts? Sex thoughts. Okay. That's normal. About you. It's not normal. What's wrong th me? Hey, hey, heNE You don't even have to look at me. You can turn around if you want. Okay? Okay. one of them, we were in my house and I was like... "Let's go for a swim." In the pool? And then... I was like... "Don't wear your bathing suit, Nathan, and I won't wear mine." Uh-huh. Go on. So we were both in the pool... I... Sorry, are you...? Nathan! Oh, my God. What is wrong with you? Carrie! Carrie! Nathan was insanely mad. Said he'd never be able to be hired as a minister if she told. He say anything after she was killed? I don't know. He disbanded the club. ??????????????? trust you as a man of God. You were a snake in the grass. I was weak. Tina... kept coming to my office every week with these elaborate stories. Oh, right, so now Tina's to blame. No, it was my fault. Tina was a troubled girl and... instead of helping her, I took advantage. Carrie Swett knew what you were doing and you beat her to death. I am to blame for their corruption, but I did not lay a hand on Carrie Swett. You saying one of them did? The kids? I was supposed to be their guide and I was so lost. Nathan, if you know anything about it, you need to do right by her. I read it. The secret Carrie found. When? The day she disappeared after the meeting. I thought maybe Tina had written something about me, so... What did it say? "Carrie is going to die." Which one wrote it? I don't know. I kept them hidden away. God, forgive me. Well, one of you confessed. "Carrie is going to die." You wrote it down. You wanted God to take your burden away, but He didn't. Did He, Phil? I didn't write that. Phil. Calm down. You used to be good kids. Good students, traditional values. What happened? Carrie happened. She came and corrupted you. Talking to you about premarital sex, and you about being gay, and, well, you. Everybody knows about you. No? Oh, you didn't share with the group? Carrie saw you and Nathan. Nathan crossed a line with me, that is true. And you came back every week to let him cross it. Little Miss Virginity, exposed by the slut. Right? Please. Why is it some great mystery, how some screwed-up girl died? Didn't just die, she was stoned to death. Kind of fitting. But you know that. She was a corruptive influence on all of us. No, she wasn't. What we were doing wasn't corrupt. True. It wasn't until you went into the woods. See her footprints. Oh, she ran like hell, didn't she? Then she stopped and changed direction here, here, here and here. Four times. Something got in her way. Something strong wouldn't let her escape. One, two, three, four obstacles. You were all there in the woods with her. You killed Carrie Swett together. You all made Carrie die for your sins. You have to confess... ...to be forgiven. I hated her for using that word. Gay. So I tricked Carrie into coming to the woods with me. I don't want to be different. I don't want to be alone. You don't have to be. You can love someone. You can be who you are. You want to go for a walk? Sure. And then what? I can't do this. Manny, don't. Please stay. I wrote it down. What we were going to do. I wanted someone to stop us. I waited for her. With Tina. Tina convinced us. I wanted to get rid of Carrie, too, and everything she reminded me of, but then we were in the woods and it was real, and I wanted to run, but my feet wouldn't... Shut up! Shut up! What are we going to do when she gets here? What do we do? We kill her. We stepped out of the shadows. And I think right away he knew. And then we made a circle around her. I don't know who started yelling, but we were just calling her names. Bitch. Slut. Dirty whore! Please, Phil, help me. What are you doing? You have to stop saying things to me that are not true! Laurie. You poisoned us and now God doesn't love us. You guys... please! And then... I hit her. You're taking him away from me! We can't. Deuteronomy. A whore should be stoned. "So shalt thou put evil away among you!" No! Do it! I'm sorry. I'm... sorry. You guys, she's still breathing. Manny, do something. Manny! I can't! I let her die in the woods. I hit her. I helped kill her, t was a blur. I killed her. I don't know why I did. I killed Carrie. I killed Carrie Swett.
