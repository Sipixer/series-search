There's nothing's wrong with it,Zip. Just move it up an inch. Yeah,like that. Big difference. Hey,hey,hey,every detail matters in one of my pinups. That's why Monty knows I'm the best. Listen,this magazine is gonna be a lights-out,call-the-doctor smash. Cornucopias of cash,my friend. Cornucopias. Here's another fan letter from Beanie,Ree. "Dear Ms. Flynn,thanks for writing me back.¡± "I put your pinup in my locker today. You are prettier than all the stars" in the sky.¡± Oh,he's so sweet. Yeah,play with the straw,Ree. - So,how was the picture show last night? - Didn't go. Well,I thought you had a date. So did I.The rat didn't even call. Oh,you should have come over. Some of Zip's New York friends were in town. You party all night? Danced with the sunrise,koo koo. We're going national. My new mag's a go.Rita,they want you for the cover. Zip,you're gonna take the picture. To Rita... the soda jerk who changed my life. To everyone here. The only family I ever had. Let's paint the town red tonight!... Jones? We got to find another bar. Got one in mind? How about... Jones? Uh,Detective Rush? - Yes? - Yeah,Gus Medica. I'm sorry; this is the only time I could get here. Uh,we spoke on the phone yesterday. Rita Flynn? Oh,right,the pinup girl. It's a '53 homicide. Detective Valens.You a relative,Mr.Medica? No,uh,just a fan. Rita's pinup got me through the Korean War. My grandson was just deployed to Afghanistan. It has me thinking about Rita again. Uh,this book came out a week ago. She was a real bombshell. Oh,she was more than a great figure. Her smile gave me hope. Now,the book says that this is the first time that anything from Rita's crime scene has ever been published. Some records clerk moron probably buddied up to the media,let them have access to the box. Mr. Medica,you said you had new informatio on the case? Uh,yeah.Turns out I've had it for over 50 years. I bought this in 1955 at an estate sale of Rita's stuff. It's not your usual cheesecake. No... now,I'm a collector. This is unique. I've never,ever seen another one like it. Same clothes. Same position of the glass on the table. That's what I noticed: same outfit,same everything. Look at the ice. Almost melted in the crime scene photo. Papers back then had said it was probably some creep,broke in... So,who took this photo? Photographer's stamp. As good as a signature if we could make it out. May be a new witness. Or the one who set Rita's final pose. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Proudly Presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Sync: YTET-¼¸ºõÃ¿ÖÜÒ»¶¼±»ÀÏ°åÆÈº¦µÄ°îµÂÖí  </font> COLD CASE Season 6 Episode 09</font> Rita Marie Flynn.

Looked like an attempted sexual assault. No blood or semen,but her clothes were torn. Peeping Tom had been reported in the neighborhood.Never caught the guy. No record of this mystery photographer. Wanted to take a picture Rita didn't. She kicks his ass out. He comes back without knocking. An unregistered Webley .38 was found outside in the rain near the building. Matched the body bullet taken from Rita. Webley's made in England.Maybe it was registered there.Worth a look. Rita was on the cover of almost 30 pinup magazines. Those come dog-eared? Research.

We're tracking a photographer Rita worked with. Took this. Stanley Nopell? - You know him? - No. Wasn't even aware that she worked with other photographers. Seem surprised. Well,Rita and I were both under contract to Monty Moran,and... no,Rita was faithful to me on both sides of the camera. Here you go,pops. I'm yours exclusively. You won't regret it. We're like the immortal team of Buonarroti and Cavalieri. - Who are they? - No idea. I heard that line in a movie. Look,Rita. He asked me out. He's got blue eyes to die for. Isn't he a dish? Supper and dessert. - Who is he? - He's a banker. He's really sweet. Oh,Betty. This one feels lucky. Um,are you Rita Flynn? No,she's the Pope. - Can I have your autograph? - Sure thing,doll. Oh,golly. Drool is so charming. I used to jerk soda for that fella. Bet he didn't ask for your autograph then. Life's funny,ain't it,koo koo?

All that male attention make any boyfriend jealous. Ah,it's just part of the business. Long as she went home with me. Back in the day,you said you were home the night Rita was killed. Hit the sack early that night for a big shoot in the morning. What about Monty? He could've hired this Nopell guy for another shoot. If he was a photographer,Monty would have known him.He knew everyone. But you never heard of him? No.I told you I...I didn't. Stay in town,Zip. I might be back for a headshot. Rita... Yeah,she was a sweet kid. She was like a daughter to me. Yeah,to this day I blame myself. Why's that,Monty? Well,I made her famous. And with fame came the attention of men,good and bad. In those days,any creep could find her address in the phone book. - You own a gun back in '53,Monty? - No.Why? Well,police never took a statement from you back then. Well,I thought she was assaulted by some sick pervert. Did Rita have her picture taken by anyone besides Zip? Oh,guys always wanted to take her picture. See,the thing about a good photo,you can stare at it over and over and still find... a new meaning in it. We're looking for a photographer named Stanley Nopell. Took this picture of Rita. You ever work with him,Monty? Stanley Nopell? Never heard of him. Did Rita mention anyone in particular might have been bothering her? No,she never said anything. But,well,there... there was a fan. Took things a little too far. {\a6}(Ruth Brown's "I'll Wait For You" plays) Al,what part of "opportunity of Brobdingnagian proportions" do you not understand? Hey,what's the holdup? Zip's running late.Keep your hat on,koo koo. So what are you gonna wear for the big date with Blue Eyes? I don't know. I wish I could buy something new. Borrow something from wardrobe.No one'll notice. - You think? - Sure. But I want you to report back to me lickety-split after the date. I want to hear everything. Smile,you're on Candid Camera. Mr.DeMille,I presume. Sorry,boss.Traffic. All right,hup two.Folks,break's over. Oh,I forgot my lei! Beanie Emerson,yeah. He was the president of Rita's fan club. Sounds like he took to the job. The kid showed up everywhere we went. She consider him a friend? No,he was just a boy. Back then,we thought it was teenage hijinks. Right. Now we just call it "stalking.¡± Up all night trying to track this Stanley Nopell dude. - Any luck? - The guy's a ghost. No driver's license,voter registration-- like he don't exist. Well,we found Beanie. Got him in the box. He still go by Beanie? Research. How're you doing,Ben? Detectives Miller and Valens. This really about Rita Flynn? Really is.Understand you were president of her fan club. You bet.This was back in the '50s. So it was you? Snuck into Rita's apartment night she died? What?No. You broke into her dressing room.Figure apartment's a piece of cake. Still got the panty collection,Beanie? I was out of town with my parents when Rita died. Florida. That wasn't the question,Ben. Look,I was...I was 15. You know what those pictures do to a kid that age? Got an eyewitness saw you breaking and entering,Beanie. You were stalking her. Look,maybe I was a little bit too,you know,zealous. I admit,I did follow her around a lot. But it wasn't me she had to fear. (seducve bigand music plays) Betty? Betty,wait. Wait! What are you doing here? I came to show you something. Your dad said this was a restaurant. I told my dad I'm waiting tables. - Please,Rita,just go. - You need money? I could lend you some. - You got $500 for all of last years' rent? - Doesn't your dad pay for... My dad drinks away every penny I make from photo shoots. You were wrong,Rita. Men do like to see. And they pay for it. But,Betty,this isn't you. What if Blue Eyes finds out? How would he find out? - Oh,no,Betty,I'd... - Go to hell! Yeah,I thought they were friends. But that girl... she was angry. Ashamed or something. Shame. Guess that's something a panty sniffer like you don't suffer much,huh? - What's that supposed to mean? - Such a big fan of Rita, why didn't you tell somebody about this? I was a minor. I wasn't even supposed to be in that club. Well,thanks for your time... Beanie. Thank you. Hello. Are you here about the Bangladesh recovery? I'm Detective Rush,Betty. - Philly Homicide. - Homicide?I don't understand. It's about Rita Flynn. Rita?For heaven's sake. You told the police back then the two of you were good friends. The best of friends. You two ever get into a spat? No. She made a lot more money than you as a model. Now,how about you?You get paid enough to make ends meet? I suppose. You remember a club called The Red Curtain? Ms.Rush,that was a long time ago. My father was an alcoholic who needed my help. I'm not proud,but... I did what I had to do. Desperate people do desperate things. If you're implying I had anything to do with Rita's death... You lied about the fight,Betty. I was upset. Rita calmed me down.We had a heart-to-heart. - When was this? - At the club. Only Rita could find humanity in such a depressing place. (sultry jazz music plays) I'm so sorry. I just lost my temper.I'm under such pressure. You don't have to apologize,Betty. - I just want to help you. - I know. So what was that surprise that you came to show me? Remember when I was taking pictures? Ta-da! There's a great one of you. But these aren't glamorous. Ordinary life can be beautiful,too. Ordinary life?What are you talking about? I don't know.Real stuff. Remember when we were jerking soda,all the crazy characters who would come in? You mean like Half-a-scoop Lou? Yeah! "A full scoop's bad for the joints.¡± See,I miss people like that. Oh,yeah...See him? That's a face with a thousand stories. Get that camera out of here! Lady,you better destroy that picture,or so help me,I'll do it for you myself! Get off me! You know that guy? Regular. Named Reg Donaldson. Came back from the front with a few screws loose. World War II vet? Everyone walked around him on eggshells. The scariest guy in a scary place. You know if he carried a gun? I saw him pull it one night on a drunk who took his seat by mistake. So you saw this man pull a gun on someone; Rita's shot to death; and you never went to the police? Detective...I saw this when I was working as a dancer. Good to see you turned your life around,Betty. Think of anything else,give me a call. - Found something? - Maybe. Here. At first,I thought this was a lighter.You see that? Yeah,what is it? Here,look closer. Camera that took this was a Leica 3A. It's unique for the time.That's actually the self-timer switch. Are you listening? The Leica 3A,self-timer. Saying Rita took that photo herself. Exactly. Turns out that American shell-shocked war vet from the strip club spent time in a psych ward in England. Along with our gun.Check this out. ID unit says the photo Gus brought in was a self-rtrait. But the stamp says Stanley. It's that song she used to sing. "Istanbul was Constantinople. Now it's Istanbul... ""Not Constantinople. Istanbul was Constantinople.¡± "Now it's... Istanbul.¡± Rita... was Stanley Nopell. Saying she was a photographer? Trying to be,at least. Not a lot of female photographers back then,so she makes up a man's name. Snaps a shot of Reg Donaldson with a stripper. Yeah,married guy,caught red-handed. Guy's half off his nut already. Not a photo you want coming home to the missus. So this guy wasn't going after Rita the pinup girl. He was after Rita the photographer. Ever spend time in the UK,Mr.Donanaldson? I thought this was about Rita Flynn. Well,if you could answer the question... I was in England after the war. Pick up a gun while you were there? - No. - But you owned a rearm? A Browning .22.I worked nights in a bad neighborhood. Understand you spent some time under a doctor's psychiatric care. What is this? We've got witnesses saying you threatened Rita Flynn. What?You think I shot her? She had a photo that could have broken up your marriage. My marriage was already broken. I overreacted. I-I just wanted to be anonymous. Anonymous? I was pretty messed up after the war.Couldn't relate to people. Just a... bottle in a bar. Did you see Rita again,Reg? Yeah,she found me and apologized. Asked me to help her out,take her around the old neighborhood. - Where's that? - Tacony.She wanted to take pictures. She pulled me out of the dark. She said she was going to show me the pictures,but then I read in the paper that... What a world. Where were you that night,Reg? Same place I was every night: The Red Curtain,trying to forget. Rita mention anyone she was having problems with? No,she was in a good mood.She... said she was thinking about quitting modeling. Quick follow-up. Think Rita got that photo developed somewhere or could she have done it on her own? Lots of photography clubs back then. - Home darkrooms were pretty common. - Right. So...who are these people? Your great-grandfather in there or something? No,I-I found it inside a used book. Every time I look at it,I see something new.You know? That guy's derby hat there,that woman's smile. I wonder what made her smile. Yeah.I love the mystery of old photographs. - We'll never know. - Well,maybe we do. You see that guy?He's knocking boots with her. Just whispered in her ear,"My compartment,five minutes.¡± No. She just slipped a slow-acting poison in that guy's drink. - Why? - Well,it's her husband. She's gonna inherit a million bucks. Wicked imagination,Frankie. Is your cell phone dead? My phone?No. Quick follow-ups are phone calls. Unless there's another reason you stopped by. Yeah.I got reservations. - You and me. - Dinner? - No. - What did you have in mind? That a yes? Yes. Hey,Miller got a hit on the gun.Registered to a Philip Moran in London. Moran?Related to Monty Moran? His unRe. Couldn't be our doer because he died in January '53, ve months before Rita was murdered. Uncle could have given it to Monty. And Monty started a British version of See Magazine in 1950. Traveled back and forth all the time. Got a little gun problem,Monty. Haven't we already gone over this? Yeah,which means either you're lying or... you're starting to slip. Wasn't your magazine that got Rita killed. It was your gun. I never fired a gun in my life. Except the one that killed Rita. This was registered to your dead uncle. My God,I'd forgotten all about the damn thing. My uncle gave it to me for a gift. A Webley .38. Bullet from that gun ended up in Rita. That gun was stolen two months before Rita died. - You never reported it. - Look,this is ludicrous. I had no reason to kill Rita. She tell you she was going to quit modeling? Eh,she told me about it,but I wasn't upset. You invested a lot of money in her. Would have taken a big hit of your circulation. Yeah,but I was not about to let an asset like that walk out the door. Are you decent? - I used to be. - You should lock your door,cupcake. What have we got here? These are fantastic. Who took 'em? Me. Come on.Don't kid a kidder. No kidding,koo koo. You got more tricks up your sleeve than Harry Houdini. - I'm through with pinups,Monty. - Thought you were having fun. I'm bored of making other people smile. When I take these pictures,I smile. So you want to ba photographer? I don't know.Maybe. These are like the ones they got in Life Magazine. You could be a photojournalist,take serious pictures. You think? Oh,no,n-no,Rita. Uh-uh,I didn't sign you to a pinup contract 'cause I wanted your autograph,so... But can't we work something out? Tell you what.How'd you like 'em published? Come on.Hey,don't kid a kidder. You got a real way of understanding people. I can see it in those pictures,too. Now you're just trying to sweet-talk me. Hey,if I can't have you as a pinup girl,I sure as hell want you as a photographer. As talented as Rita was in front of the camera,she was even more talented behind it. Hell,I was even going to make more money that way. What a sell: "queen of the lens.¡± Still got some of her old negatives,too. I never could bring myself to print them. Who else had access to that gun,Monty? I kept it locked up in a small safe in the studio. Anyone else have a key to that safe? No,just Zip.Kept his expensive lenses in there. Did Zip know Rita wanted to leave modeling? I don't know,but I'll tell you one thing-- I was-- I wasn't sad to see him go. Package deal like that,I was better off without. Talking about Zip with Rita? All that time,I thought that blowhard made her look good till I realized it was the other way around. Yes,ma'am,uh,the pictures are ready. Are you aware of our two- for-one special on 8x10s? Special can wait,Zippy. You remember the safe Monty had in his studio? Safe?No. You should.He gave you a key to it. - That's where you kept your lenses,right? - I guess. Oh,yeah,come to think of it,uh,I stored a few of 'em in ther Along with his gun.Come to think of that? No,I don't remember any gun. Well,how about Rita telling you she wanted to quit modeling? - Well,that was just something she said. - Said she wanted to become a photographer. Please. Taking a few snapshots and doing what I do are two different things entirely. I checked your rsum,Zip. - You had a hard time getting work after Rita died. - I loved Ree. It took me a while before I could photograph a woman again. Yeah,especially since no other magazine would hire you. Barely lasted another year as a pinup photographer. - That's 'cause you were a hack. - You don't know what you're talking about. - I created Rita. - She outgrew you,Zip. No,it was a relationship.She...she needed me. She needed you to let her go,but you just couldn't do that. No.I was the photographer. I mean,we had a good thing going,the two of us. Till she had to go and turn everything upside down. ("Somewhere Along the Way" by Nat King Cole playing) These are interesting. Who'd you say did this? Me. What do you think? You want to quit modeling for this? They're ugly. Well,I'm...I'm just getting started. - I'll get better. - Stick to smiling pretty,baby. Don't ruin a good thing. Don't you believe in me,Zip? And what about "you and me all the way to the top of the top"? We can both do it as photographers. Look,I'm the photographer. You're a pinup girl. That's the way it is. I want to take different kinds of pictures. - Like a journalist. - Journalism takes brains. Dedication. No more sing-alongs in bars behaving like a tramp. My mother taught me to sing along like that. I told you that. She used to dance around the kitchen when I was a little girl, singing goofy songs to me. I was gonna teach our daughter the same thing one day. I don't think we want the same things anymore,do we,Zip? I think you should go. I knew as soon as I saw those photos.She was good. I just couldn't admit to it at the time. You couldn't handle that she was more talented than you. Instead,I was cruel. And that was the last time I saw her. I went to Monty's studio that night to get my prints of Rita. I knew they'd be valuable someday. Took me all night to pack 'em up. Anyone to back that up? Betty Sue was there.Trying on some of Rita's wardrobe for her date. Betty Sue borrowed Rita's clothes? Well,the kid didn't have any money. - Do you remember if she took a purse? - A purse? For her date.Did she borrow a purse? I don't know. She was awful excited,though.She,uh,made me take a picture of her. You still have that picture? I'm a photographer.Got a negative of every picture I ever took. Dig it up and print it. Betty Sue dresses for a night on the town. You remember when that photo was taken? I don't know. It's at the studio. Must have been a photo shoot. - Oh,Zip said he took it the night Rita was killed. - He did? You were at the studio getting ready for your big date. Oh,well,I'll be.I'd forgotten. You forgot a lot,Betty. I been going over these pinup magazines You chose Seems like a time capsule. Rita's "night on the town" outfit for your date with "Blue Eyes.¡± Quite a trip down memory lane. But what does that have to do with Rita's murder? Everything. You see that purse? You had it with you on your date. So how does it end up in Rita's apartment? I just figured Rita borrowed it from wardrobe. - Maybe she did. - No.No. The only way that purse gets to this crime scene is if you brought it. I did stop by. But I didn't hurt Rita. I ran your fingerprints,Betty. Matches the gun. How did you get my fingerprints? A report from the crime lab. And your prints are all over your office at St.Mary's. Patriot Act.Special subpoena.We dusted that place two nights ago. I didn't have a gun. You were Monty's assistant. You had copies of all his keys. The strip club was a dangerous place. You took Monty's gun for protection. Oh,that gun.Yes,I had it. I don't know how it got to Rita's apartment. Well,your date ended early,so you went to Rita's to talk about it. Just like she made you promise. Your date was at 8:00. The gunshot was heard at 9:00. Your date didn't go well,did it? A couple drinks to numb the pain? Two best friends,both working the soda shop. Years pass and everything goes right for one,but the other one... She's stuck taking care of a drunken old man. And Rita plays and dances. Everything was easy for her. I just wanted one day of her luck. One day when it was easy. What happened that night,Betty? I've devoted my life to helping others. Helping others or seeking atonement? Someone once told me God shines his light on those who ask for forgiveness. I hope so. Rita! Betty?What's wrong? You told me to come by after the date. Here I am. Sit down,Bets.You don't look too good. What's that? Nothing. It's just another picture I took. - It's of you.- Self-portrait. Monty found another magazine that wants to publish me. I had to come up with a fake name. Stanley Nopell.Get it? From your song. Good one. What's a girl gotta do to get a drink around here? Hey,hey,haven't you had enough? Betty,what happened? My date went real swell. Sat down for drinks. He was excited... a little nervous. Then you know happened? He gave me something. He did? - Well what did he give you? - This. He wanted your autograph. He only asked me out so he could meet you. No.No,that can't be true. He came to you that night. Because he was too nervous to go to you. He laughed at me when he realized I thought we were on a date. Oh,Betty. What's it like... ...to always be lucky? Betty,I'm not lucky. Harder I work,luckier I get. The men at the club-- they stare,stare. They never ask me for my autograph. They ask me for other things. Betty,you don't have to do that. Come stay here with me. Your dad'll be fine. If I can't make old Blue Eyes happy,then you should. You make everyone happy! Life's funny. Ain't it,koo koo? Go ahead.Sign it! Betty,don't do this. Sign it! Sign it! Betty... Betty,it's me. It's Ree.I'm your friend. Things can change for you. I started right where you did. That's what hurts the most.
