No time to think. Just let it happen. Paint's like your blood, Telling the whole world you've been up here. You all right, little man ? Leon ! Come on, man. I can't move, carlos. Just got to stop looking down. Look up. Look, you can do it. Come on. I got you. There you go. When it's darkest, men see stars. When it's darkest, men see stars. Ain't no stars, Leon. Not in my universe anyway. No stars ? What do you mean ? Ma kicked me out. I tell you that ? Like I don't even exist. "You dropped a bomb on me" by The Gap Band.</i> Ain't nobody bombing like Blaze. Take a picture. By the time I'm done, The whole city's gonna know my name. What, are you taking a trip ? No. A friend bought a condo in Boca. Thinking of investing myself. Oh. Looks quiet. It's probably a good place to write. What's that supposed to mean ? Didn't Hemingway live in Florida ? I need to talk to someone about my son's murder. Well, I'm detective lilly rush. My partner, scotty valens. What was your son's name ? Carlos Espinosa. Killed October 11, 1982. Someone sprayed paint In his mouth till he suffocated. I put his things in storage. Last week, motel where I work in cut my hours. Can't afford the storage anymore ? Like most, can't afford much of anything. When I was cleaning it out, I found this in his backpack. Yeah, seen these back in narc. It's a graffiti writer's black book. It's why I needed to talk to you. I told the police back then my son was nothing but a huffer. He was sniffing paint? Well, I'd catch him huddled up with a paper bag and paint cans, stealing money out of my purse... He never talked about graffiti ? We hardly saw each other. I had to work three jobs just to keep a roof over our heads. You thought he was an addict. So I kicked him out. But he was an artist... wasn't he ? You ever see Carlos after he left the house ? He'd sneak in after I left for work, raid the fridge. Left his backpack once. Next day, they told me he was dead. Look at this one. It was October 11, 1982. That's the day carlos died, right? T-u-r ? It looks like part of a bigger piece, but there's no other pictures. You know where this photo was taken ? I wish. Like to see it myself. You know who Carlos was hanging out with ? Other taggers, friends ? No idea. Mistake I made, kicking him out of the house. Lil. Something here. Carlos bombed over someone else's work. "nrke." Anarchy ? Some kind of insult ? That's a declaration of war. Hard-core punks in that world ? No way they're letting him get away with it. Well, maybe nrke got even, Dropped a bomb on Carlos. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com Bombers Carlos Espinosa. 16 years old. Body was found in an alley in kensington on October 11, 1982. Autopsy report indicates a skull fracture. M.E. found chips of paint in the gash on Carlos's head. Cause of death was asphyxiation. Someone bashed his head against the wall before that paint was forced down his throat. Assigned figured another huffer jumped Carlos, used his own can of paint against him. Murder weapon found under some debris... couldn't lift a print. Well, see if you can trace the can, locate the retailer. Victim had three healed broken ribs at the time of his death. Well, mom kicked him out, and Carlos was living on the streets. Lot of ways for a kid to get hurt out there. Any idea where he racked his supplies ? Well, mom said she found receipts in his jean pockets-- Uh, small stuff like gum. That's an old trick. Pay for something cheap, so no one's suspicious, then shoplift the paint. Well, the receipts were from a... Harold's hardware. I'll show them a photo, see if maybe someone remembers Carlos. Had a steady hand. Clean lines. Looked into nrke. The crew was notorious in the '80s for violent street justice. So, Carlos was killed in their hood ? Yeah, two blocks from their clubhouse. Well, we're going to need names. I'm meeting with the head of the graffiti removal commission, Uh, Don Bardwill. Been on the scene three decades. Says he knew nrke up close and personal. Curtis, hey. Uh, I was wondering... Yeah ? How you and your ex agreed on custody. That's what you were wondering ? Well, I wouldn't say that me and the soul crusher agreed on anything. So, you petitioned for visitation ? Wait. What's going on, Kat ? Jarrod sent me a letter. He got married, moved back to Philly. He wants veronica to stay with him two weekends a month. What are my options ? Well, you could play hardball, force him to file a custody complaint. Would veronica have to testify ? Strong possibility. What else ? I don't know. Sit down with the guy. There's probably a way to work it out. How do you work it out with an ex-banger who wants custody of your kid ? I could come. Uh, not as a lawyer. You know, just as your boyfriend. Yeah, okay. Yeah. But... Never said you were my boyfriend. I'll see you... later. Lil. Oh, hey, lover boy. We need to talk. - So talk. - In private. Got something to show you. So... Uh... Here, give me a hand, will you ? We're looking for a, um... Private criminal complaint. Filed by moe kitchener. That's it. Against one Lillian Rush. Let's see. You put a boot on his car. Harassed his loan officer. Gave him a night in the drunk tank with... Tico ? Yeah. He forget anything ? It's not the first complaint he's ever filed. Yeah, but this one's from the DA's office, Lil, not IAB. These guys can prosecute you for a crime. Thanks. Got it. I don't know what's going on with you, but... This could cost you your career. You done talking yet ? Hey, you're on your own. Always have been. Called me the graffiti gestapo back in the day. Colorful name. Cruised around in my mercury monarch with a gallon of paint, removers. People say these kids are vandals, crooks. Wonder why. Just neglected kids trying to show the world they exist. Painting murals gives them an outlet. Beautifies the city in the process. Yeah, you got that list we asked for ? Nrke, right ? It's here somewhere. Turbo 102. - This look like the same tag ? - Judging by the way The T's slanted, I'd say it's him all right. - Who is he ? - Good question. Guy's been bombing the city almost three decades. Are you saying he still hits places today ? Most bombers leave churches and cemeteries alone. Turbo's got no respect for anything or anyone. Do you know where this photo was taken ? Too small to make out any landmarks. Where'd you get it ? Kid we're looking into, Carlos Espinosa. This was his black book. Went by Blaze. Oh, I know that tag. You didn't mention Blaze on the phone. Is that why you asked about NRKE ? Why, is there a connect ? Blaze was new on the scene. Nrke taught him a serious lesson. "We want the airwaves" by The Ramones.</i> What the hell you doing, hermano ? Just trying to get my name on the map. You got to dis to get noticed. Nobody bombs here without going through me. This is nrke's wall. Fool, I am nrke. This is pretty. It's better than what was up there. Yeah. Who is this kid ? You think you got style ? This is my block. I'm the king. You'd better get somebody else to do your writing, man. You're cocky for somebody who's about to get his ass beat. Turn him over. I catch you capping my spot again, I'm gonna feed you this can. Hey, get out of here, narc, or you're next. It's what happens when you leave a bunch of kids on their own. You call the cops ? Drove straight to a pay phone. By the time they got there everyone was gone-- Including blaze. Explains the broken ribs. What about the thug ? Head of nrke ? Called himself tut. One thing I know : Nobody disrespected the king. Philly's finest looking for a new paint job ? Shop's a step up from tagging with nrke. Nrke. Haven't heard that name in a while. Understand you were the king. Took it pretty serious. Thought I was bombing the system, leaving my mark. Just a bunch of hoodlums running on the streets. Investigating the murder of Carlos Espinosa. Went by the tag of blaze back in '82. Not a bad throw up. Probably would've messed him up Real good if I would've caught him. Got a witness says you were doing exactly that. "Gonna feed you this can." Sound familiar ? Look, uh, back in the day, thought the only thing you had in this world was your name, Your reputation. Well, toy like Carlos disses you, you gotta show him you mean business, right ? But the boy came around a few weeks later, tail between his legs, and the king granted him a pardon. Believe this ? Fool's stupider than I thought. - I want to go. - Come on, Leon. - You got my back, right ? - Yeah man. "Let it whip" by Dazz Band. Bring us a punching bag, hombre ? It's cool, Leon. I got this. Drank too much, disrespected you and your whole crew. Hell, everybody knows the king's tearing it up all over. I got a peace offering. Next time, bring better beer. Come here. I saw your tag up on the Alleghany Water tower. Going higher next time. You got a lot of sack, climbing up there. Fall off a roof, go to heaven. Highest spot of all. Say, man, toy like you needs a crew. A place to crash. Throw slo-mo here some scraps. You all planning any pieces ? Burners ? Come on, man, this is nrke. All-out destruction, man. You know what I'm saying ? You want pretty pieces, you going to yourself a graffiti coloring book. All right. - Let me think about it. - What's there to think about ? Nrke reigns supreme, nobody comes close. Can we go now ? Yeah, man. Just-just give me a minute. Be careful, man. That chick's dangerous. Hey. I'm Carlos. Not anymore. Now... ...You're mine. "Talon" ? Thought he was gonna join the crew, make me look good. - And he turned you down ? - Can you believe it ? Thought I was giving him the keys to the castle. Now, who was the kid with Carlos ? - Never knew his name. - What about the girl ? Uh... Gina something. Always writing with that nasty orange. She part of your crew ? She wanted to be. Told her she had a sloppy hand with no style. You know how she got her tag, Talon ? Heard she clawed out some guy's eyes. Tried to warn Carlos, but once she got it in you, she ain't never letting go. Yeah ? Carlos's last piece. ID put it under a complex magnifier. Get anything ? The wall has oval-shaped bricks. There's one place in town with those bricks : the sewer system. Tagger's mo is to get his name up where everyone can see it. Why go underground ? The last piece he ever drew. Chance it could shed some light. Lot of sewers, boss. Distribute a flyer with Carlos's photo and a polaroid of his last piece. Pwd workers, homeless shelters. Maybe we get lucky. I tracked down the owner of harold's. Said Carlos was seeing one of his employees. Gina Lopresi. Yeah, fired her once he realized she was stealing all the spray paint. You show her photo to "king tut" ? Id'd her as Talon. Will's tracking her down now. Talon, huh ? Well, it's time we stick our claws in her. So, you, um... moved from Detroit ? Last month. Yeah, finally got settled. Unpacked the last box. And got the girls enrolled in school. I have two daughters, Connie and Cassie. We got a place with a bedroom for Veronica, too. Painted it her favorite Color. Purple. Lavender, baby. Right, lavender. 'Cause apparently there's a difference. Sorry. I gotta go. - Dame. - Ah, gracias. Your mother, she gets more beautiful every day. He does that to get out of doing the dishes. Think I don't know your tricks, viejo ? How's your knee, ma ? Doctor said it's fine. So, you going to grace us with your presence on Sunday ? I'm making arroz con gandules. Hey. Pierson. Got another purse snatching outside the dayley's market.</i> Same MO. Older hispanic lady. Taking her statement now. Uh... Hold her till I get there. Got it. I'm sorry, ma, I gotta... take this. It's work. It's always work with you, Scotty. When you gonna slow down ? Sunday. Arroz con gandules. Gina Lopresi ? Sorry, we're closed. Philly P.D. What can I do for you ? Nice stuff for a girl from the streets. Graffiti vandal turned boutique owner. Graffiti taught me skills. How to market my name, resilience, respect. What's this about ? Know where this was taken ? Never seen it before. Ever go to the sewer to tag ? Why would I do that ? To hang with your boyfriend, Carlos Espinosa. Carlos wasn't my boyfriend. You stealing all that paint from Harold's hardware just for yourself ? I did a lot of crazy things when I was a teenager. Racking paint for a boy I liked was just one of 'em. Crazy is a good way to put it. Arrested three times for vandalism. One for agg. assault. The assault was self-defense. Not the way the judge saw it. My stepfather used to beat me. One day he got the idea to toss me out a third-floor window. Clawed his eyes out to stop him. Fluorescent orange is still your signature color. I like orange. Is that a crime ? No. But this is... Heard he was killed. I didn't know it was like this. Carlos thought no one could touch him. He was wrong. Come here, I want to show something. Blaze and Talon. It looks alive. I've never seen anything like it. Your name should be up high. I see you. Yeah, who told you to look ? Why don't you just write your last name up there, too, Leon ? Use the name I gave you. Turbo. The fastest tagger in town. "Rapture" by Blondie. So, what's with you and speed bump ? Don't say things like that, all right ? He might start believing it. Sorry. He's got a raw deal, that's all. Pretty decent of you, letting him tag along. Everybody needs someone, right ? Get down ! Get down ! - What's wrong ? - Got some cop after me. He always knows where I'm at. I don't know how. He chased me down an alley with a flashlight, said he was gonna bash my head in. - What for ? - I don't know. Guy's obsessed. He's always buffing out my tags. I catch you, you're dead, Blaze ! That-that's him ! Run ! Carlos was different. Always taking care of other people. This the guy who was chasing Carlos ? Could be. Carlos's friend, Leon... You're saying he was Turbo ? That's what Carlos called him. Said he found him in an alley, eating out of the trash. Where can we find him ? Six feet under. He fell off a roof a week before Carlos died. Thank you. We'll be in touch. So, if Turbo's dead, Who's using the tag Turbo 102 ? I bet Don Bardwill knows. Hi. Detective valens. Thanks for waiting, belen. Your case is similar to another case I'm working. Yeah, I already told That other young man everything. Sorry to put you through this again. Can you tell me what happened, por favor ? Hoodlum came out of nowhere, pushed me down. Ran off with my pocketbook. You get hurt ? Scratched my knee. I'm fine. Did you get a look at the guy ? My eyes aren't so good anymore. What was he, white, black, latino ? All my groceries are in the trunk. My ice cream's melting. Help me get this guy off the street. Stop him from doing this again. I have to go. Belen... there are other women he's done this to. Women like you. You've spoken to them ? I... I know... What he did to you. I wasn't strong enough to stop him. I tried to scream, But he put his hand over my mouth. He... put his hand over your mouth ? My husband is the only man I've ever been with. He told me to stop looking at him. That was the only thing he said to me. You... you saw him ? Oh, yes. Things we gotta do... Get a nurse to see you... I don't know, no. Look, anyone that cares for you... They're gonna understand... It wasn't your fault. I shouldn't have been there. It wasn't your fault. You hear me, Belen ? I have to go. My ice cream's melting. "Graffiti gestapo." You get that nickname For getting physical with bombers like Carlos ? 'Course not. I was trying to clean up the streets, not take on gangs. Clean up the streets. That include chasing kids with your flashlight ? Threatening to beat them ? Might have tried to scare some punks. You ask me, degenerates had it coming. Someone's got to step up and do something about it. Right ? I was taking back our city. What, by stalking Carlos ? Hunting him down ? Hey now, I never stalked anyone. So how'd you always know where he was at ? I got calls when kids were bombing. Told me where to go. Always the same voice. You saying someone was ratting out bombers ? Don't know who it was. Didn't care. Made my job easier. What about Leon ? Chasing these kids around town. You finally catch one ? Don't know any Leon. Oh, Carlos's little friend. Took a nosedive 13 stories off a roof a week before Carlos was murdered. Sorry to hear that, but like I said, don't know anyone named Leon. Want to tell me why your name's on his accident report, then ? Says here that you were a witness to his death. The date's October 2. Ten-two. One-oh-two. Sound familiar ? Give you a clue. Leon's nickname was Turbo. One-oh-two-- the day he died. Now, you got photos of his tags all over your office. You know every single place that he hit. So tell us. Who's Turbo, Don ? I don't know. I just wanted them to stop. I didn't think it would go that far. When it's darkest, men see stars. When it's darkest, men see stars. Don't be scared, Turbo. This spot's gonna make the angels weep. I want to see stars, Carlos. - You want stars ? - Yeah. You got stars. Let me see that first. Emerson ? Now who's that ? You said there weren't any stars. That's what you said. Remember ? Did say that, but I was wrong. All right. Check this out. Freeze, you maggots ! Oh, somebody narced us out ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Let's go ! Come on, killer. Come on, let's go ! Come on, Turbo ! You can do it ! Get you, you little bastard ! - Help ! Carlos ! - I got you, man. - Carlos ! Help ! Carlos. - I got you, man. I got you. Get out of here ! I'll tell them it was just me. Go before the cops come ! Go ! Night... changed my life. Can't fix what happened. But I've tried to do some good. If Carlos was alive today, I'm sure... He'd be doing exactly what I'm doing... Giving these kids some hope. What the hell was that, Kat ? I'm trying to help you out here. I'm-I'm sorry. I... I couldn't take it. Well, that much I got. Look, if jarrod wants to see veronica, He's gonna have to go to court. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna have to warn you. His-his lawyer's gonna present a guy who's been clean for five years. I leave you alone at the table, and now you're defending him ? I'm just saying how it's gonna look in court. Look, judges try to give parents contact with their children. No, this is different, Curtis. He's an ex-banger. You're not. He's still her father. Not everyone deserves a second chance. I'm sorry you feel that way. In my book, Guy should be able to see his own kid. Ma'am ? - There a problem, lady ? - No. Got to move the car. Tracked the orange paint can that Carlos was killed with. Manufacturer sold it to harold's hardware. Store where Gina worked. Excuse me. I'm Eddie Clark. Work at the Fairhill soup kitchen. Saw one of your posters. I know this boy. Was there when he painted this piece. Don't hardly do it justice, though. Beautiful, ain't it ? Just like I told you. Spent a lot of time down here back then. Man, where... Where did you learn how to do that ? The streets. Must be some damn angels on the street you come from, 'cause I ain't never seen nothing like that. Got us an artist in the sewer. Ain't an artist. You tell that to them. What you... ? What you call it ? When it's darkest, Men see stars. That's what my friend always wanted. You got a gift, brother. A real gift. You could do something with that. What are they doing ? Maybe they want to see stars, too. Still come down from time to time to look at those stars. Remind myself how far I've come. You recognize those stars - From gina's clothing line ? - Yeah. Our famous designer said she'd never seen this mural. "Dead on site. Talon." What kind of girlfriend leaves a message like that? Recognize this, Gina ? So I capped his burner. Doesn't mean I hurt him. You want to read that for us? "dead on site." It was just an empty threat. You two have an argument? Almost 30 years ago ? You can't expect me to remember ancient history. You've been pawning carlos' stars off as your own for nearly that long. He wasn't the type to care if somebody was biting his work. Orange paint can that killed carlos was sold at harold's hardware. It's not like you think. I was all alone. I needed his help... but he wouldn't do it. Carlos, there you are. Gina. I've been looking for you. A junkie jumped me in the park. Hey. I needed someone to watch my back. I couldn't find you. "Only you" by Yazoo. Leon died. He fell. It's my fault He was up there in the first place. The streets aren't safe. That's why we need a crew. Look. It's the most I ever racked from harold. Now we've got something to offer nrke. What do you want with those thugs ? They've got a clubhouse, A place to stay at night. Think they'll let you in their crew ? They will if you take me. Tut said you can join them. You don't get it. They're bombing 'cause they're punks. I'm done with that. All right, I don't care about getting my name up. I want to do something. Help people. In the sewer ? Nobody's going to see your work down here. They already have. Look, I want to do something with this, Gina. You could, too, if you'd just... Bombers are getting clipped left and right. Nrke is the only crew Whose tags don't get taken down. You're right. Their tags never get buffed. Ever. Get away. I got to go do something. - No, no... - Just wait right here. Please don't leave me. I'll be back, I promise. He never came back. I was so mad, I slashed his mural. I heard the next day on the streets, he'd been killed. You said he took your paint ? Five cannons of my signature orange. Know where he went ? No. He was right, though. There's more to life than just bombing. Question is: Where did he go with that paint? Yeah, only the one can found at the crime scene. Wasn't any graffiti In that alley. Look. The wall behind carlos's body is completely bare. It seem odd to you a whitewashed wall in nrke territory ? Would have been hit a hundred times. That wall's got a story to tell. Let's peel back the layers. ******* Your liquor store, your gym, Your el stop, your dear mother's church. Playing a game-- this is your life ? Cops must be bored. Sit up. Listen to the lady. Above your liquor store, Turbo 102. On your gym marquee, Turbo 102. On the church door, turbo 102. That your tag ? Tut is my scribe. Yeah, in the '80s. Then the mayor cracked down, you needed a new tag, one nobody could connect to you. That... That all you got, huh ? Random coincidence in my hood ? Matched the paint samples from turbo 102 with auto paint In your body shop. It's expensive, but... You get it wholesale, right ? You got me, I'm, I'm turbo 102. You stink like a rat. Who you calling a rat, man ? I'm the king. Yeah, king snitch. Made anonymous calls about Carlos and his friend Leon. I ain't no rat, man. Lowest life-form there is, except for pigs. Got something else you want to say, hmm ? Come on in, Don. A snitch used to call him every day. Always the same voice. Now he loves to talk. Go ahead, say something. Say something ! Son of a bitch, you're a dead man, man ! That's him. Sit your ass down. That's police brutality, Man ! No, brutality is what they do to snitches in the badlands. Other bombers found out, you'd have been a walking corpse. Carlos was about to share Your dirty secret with the whole neighborhood. You had to shut him up. Look, I tried to give that fool an out. - But he wouldn't take it. - Little punk thought he was better than me ! Yeah, thought He could ruin your rep. Spent years Getting up, building my name. Yeah, you said a name was the only thing you had in this world. Reason I took his. Bitch thought he could get me killed, thought He could be king. There's only one king. what the hell you doing ? Been waiting for you to get here. Yeah, my boys been telling me you been putting up lies. I'm here to take 'em down. Your boys combing the streets so you can rat us taggers out? "Turbo 102." That's your new name ? I kind of like it. That's my boy you got killed with your snitching. Turbo 102. It's my tag now, bitch. Don't even touch it. Leave it alone, man. Said I'm gonna take it down. That's what I'm gonna do. I'll take it down myself If you lay off other bombers. You giving me orders ? I'm the king ! It ain't about staying up. We can do more, change things around here-- Everyone dying on the streets. You high or something? I said take it down. What's the life expectancy for a snitch ? Take it down. You might as well not even exist. Take... It... Down! Guess that's the only way you're going to stay king 'cause it sure as hell ain't your skills doing the trick.
