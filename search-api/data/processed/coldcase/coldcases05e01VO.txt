a bullet to the head.</i> I remember. Who is he? You're not gonna take her from me.??? Hey! I'll kill all of you. (gunshot) Hey! You're coming, too. RUSH: I'm going.</i> You' die. Shoot me! Do it now! the following story is fictional and does notdepict any actual person or event Pop says we're not supposed to go past Mrs. Mortenson's house. Who cares what your pop says? No, serious. He'll blow a gasket if we go to the pool again. So what are we gonna do? Hang out here in Snoozerville? He said a kid just got beat up really bad in Fishtown. Jackie's gonngo wee-wee in his diaper. Scaredy cat. Shut up, man. I ain't scared. So what are you waiting for, wusses? All right. To the pool. Fishtown teenagers Dylan Noakes and Teddy Nimmo were convicted today in the brutal deaths of three local fifth-grade boys. Nimmo was the only one to confess to the crime, calling it a "thrill kill." Look who bothered coming to work. Hey. Hey. Hey... You okay? Oh, yeah, they... they just took the stitches out. Ah. It's nothing. I'm fine. You look good, Lil. You do. The city's going all-out, huh? Yeah. Take a bullet, think they'd give you more than a Mickey Mouse band-aid. Didn't stop them from siccing IAD on our asses. JEFFRIES: Protocol-- said he's got to dot the "I's," cross the "T's," prove it was a good shooting. So, uh, you ready to jump back in the saddle here or what? VERA: ?? Nervous Nellies. Need a refill. Second that. Uh, get you anything, Lil? No, no, I'm good. Thanks. WOMAN: Are you detectives? You need something? You people killed my son. Teddy. Teddy Nimmo. Welcome back, Lil. I heard about that job. Your son and his buddy did a triple back in '93, '94. VALENS: We put him away, lady, we didn't kill him. Might as well have. Teddy hung himself. They gave me his stuff from the cell. I found this letter. "I tape their eyes shut "so they stay in e dark forever. "Just like me. Stop me. I am the monster." Must have been the real killer that sent him that letter when they first locked him up. Should've given it to his lawyer. Yeah? Teddy tried. Again and again. I just talked to that jackass. He never listened. Maybe 'cause your son wrotit. Ain't possible. Believe me. We're not gonna just take your word. My boy, uh, he couldn't write. He could barely read. They said he was a monster because  was used to smile at the trial. That's what Teddy does when he's scared. He smiles. My son, he woul't hurt a soul. We'll look into it, Mrs. Nimmo. No, you won't. We're just Fishtown trash, right? People like us... 'we don't matter. ??? Cops never released that detail to the public, doer taping the dead kids' eyes shut. Well, he had an accomplice, right? Maybe that guy wrote it. Well, then who mailed it? Postmark's from Philly. His buddy's doing life up in Graterford. Could be worth another look. Could be a wild-goose chase. And ito'cled. Well, if the killer's still out there... it's not. VALENS: The victims were last seen on their bikes outside the Raymes residence. Bodies found a day later. RU: Ran into the doers at the abandoned pool. Dylan and Teddy's "hangout." Our cause of death, blunt force trauma. Multiple blows to the skull, the face. Murder weapon never found. Criminal psychologist said the scene "reflected the frenzied, explosive rage of a severely disturbed and abused child." Or two of them. Teddy, raised by a crackhead single mom. Dylan, bumped around the foster care system since age five. History of abuse, petty crime, setting fires. On the stand, Dylan called himself a "nihilist." No beliefs, no loyalties, no purpose in life but destruction. I didn't know you worked this job. No, I didn't. This kind of massacre, everyone knew about it, wanted answers, blood. Glad to have you back. Good to be back, boss. Start counseling yet? Not yet. I... will. Joe Connelly was the assigned back in '94. Thinking we'd have a talk with Dylan, too. Teddy confessed. witness at the boys' school overheard them bragging about the murders, what's there to talk about? The letter, who sent it? Question Documents has it. Maybe they give us some answers. Joe Connelly was a good cop. Job's closed. You got any open jobs for me, boss? Counseling's not optional here, Rush. Get that done first. Yeah. I will. Gotta put in my shrink hours after that shooting. Make sure I'm not nuts. Gotta be to come back to this job. You know, I, um, I never got to say, uh, thanks. For what you did. I told that IAD jerk what a hero you were. As long as you don't make me do it again. Okay. Take a ride up to Graterford? Wasting our time. Got nothing but, right? So you coming? Found this in your, uh, buddy's belongings, Dylan. Nice try. I didn't write that drivel. Barely looked at it. Would you prefer a handwriting sample? Save us all this face-to-face? Heard about what happened to Teddy yet? Oh, shocking people... that get you off? You sure you want to know what gets me off, lady? We're out. Forget this ass clown. Locked in a dark room for hours, your letter writer. Little boy blue. Boo-hoo. You ever locked in a dark room, Dylan? I am now. All those halfway homes, mean foster mommies. Yomust hate the world. Killing those boys yr payback? Sure. I'm the fire-breathing dragon from Happily Ever After Land. Nice tat. I just got it. You want one? You didn't answer the question. You'll believe what you want. The truth's irrelevant. Truth being you're a murdering son of a bitch. Truth being we were 17 and stupid. We still believed. Believed what? That they wouldn't put you away for a crime you didn't commit. Here they come. Here they ar How could they give us life, Dyl? We didn't do anything. Where's my mom? Mom? (clamoring) Mom? MAN: You let my son die! I hope they kill you in prison! Jack! WOMAN: I want my son back! Let's give them what they want then. Land of the free, home of the brave. Guilty for... being a freak. Welcome to the U.S. of A. You're breaking me up here, homes. Stay a little longer, guapo.</i> I'll break you in for real. You promise? I'm done here. Attitude like that helped put you here in the first place. Being poor is what put us away. Not to mention your buddy's confession. He was a kid, okay? Mama's boy. No match for that cop. You saying Connelly forced Teddy to lie?</i> Cop forcing a false confesssion? No... that never happens. MAN: That letter is pure B.S. Dylan's a con artist. imo sociopath. Got a IQ of 190. He's playing you. JEFFRIES: Well, maybe he is. Just doing due diligence, Joe. You saying I blew the job? I'm just saying I'm doing mine. CONNELLY: Takes a while, beating a person to death. VERA: The kind of job that gets to you. Cost me my marriage. I hear that. We searched all night, and then I found them. It rained the night before they were killed. ??  Pool sck with mud... Think of anything else, you know where to find us. Appreciate your time, Joe. The night I go to arrest that punk, Dylan, you know what he says? What's that? "Think I'll be on the news tonight?" Now you tell me they didn't do it. The guy did his job. What the hell are we doing? Spinning our wheels. RUSH: Dylan's handwriting wasn't a match to the letter. Ain't what you call exact science. Could have faked it. Could've got some prison groupie to write it. The kid's a genius, right? No forensics connecting him to that kind of crime scene? Come on. And what happened to the murder weapon? They dumped it. Bodies were left where they're sure to be found, sure to be connected to Dylan and Teddy, so why hide the weapon? You're reaching, Lil. And you're reaching for my kung pao chicken. It's family style. So what? Do I look like your family? Connelly said there was a storm the night before the murders. Mud all over the scene, right? VERA: Yeah, so what? And the kids supposedly rode their bikes to the pool. So why no mud in their wheels? MILLER: Squeaky clean, every one of them. When Connelly was tracking mud all over the damn place. Pool wasn't the death scene, just the dump site. Somebody carried the boys the, and their bikes. ?? Thought I told you this job was closed. RUSH: Well, the kids weren't murdered at the pool. So? How'd Dylan and Teddy tranort the bodies? Didn't own a car, didn't even have licenses. They could've stolen a car to get them. No vehicle thefts reported in the vicinity of the pool. Well, could've carried them there at night. No one would have seen them. Okay, sure, so why go to all that trouble of putting bodiein the one spot connected to you? You're saying the dump site was a setup? Well, bodies were supposed to be found, pinned on the bad kids who hung there 24/7. So where were they killed? That's what we got to find out. You talk to any of the parents yet? Probably knew their kids' haunts. Sean's folks left the state years ago. Moved to Oregon. We reached out to George's family. Got shut down. That's understandable. Job's closed. Why dig up the worst memory of your life? Jack's parents are still in Fairmont. His mom was the last to see. Jeffries and Miller are having a talk. All right, Scotty, you're the assigned on this one. Yeah, sure. ut those monsters awa and you want to let them go. That's not what we're doing, Mr. Raymes. We wanted to ask about some other places Jack and his friends might have played. Why? We think your so and his friends were killed elsewhere, moved to the pool. Moved? Oh, my God. Is this really necessary? We just barely got our lives back together. I'm not really sure that my wife can go through this again. I've noticed a lot of empty factories in the neighborhood. Did any of the boys play there? No. I told Jack to stay away from those places. Boys will be boys. Not Jack, he was a good kid. He always minded his mom and me, and he would never've done anything without telling us. Got anything to add, Mrs. Raymes? I should have stopped him from going? JEFFRIES: Going where? Off the block that day. JACK: To the pool! Jack, where do you think you're going? Nowhere. Get over here, mister. I'm working the late shift tonight, so the last thing I need is you running all over town. Oh, Jack, not again with the wipeouts. Taking that bike away if you can't be more careful. I am careful, Mom. You've been to that pool again, haven't you? We can do wheelies and cool stuff there. And Sean and George will go home if we have to say in Snoozerville. And I'll be all alone! Look, you can go past Mrs. Mortensen's if you promise to stay away from the pool. Really, Mom? Go on, get out of here before I change my mind. You might want to zip up your backpack before your buddies see Lil' Duke. Why are you carrying him around anyway? 'Cause Lil' Duke keeps the dragon away. The dragon? I thought he'd be safe. I never should have let him off the block. Jack mentioned something about a dragon? I didn't think anything of it. Kids' imaginations and all. Jack had that stuffed imal the day he died? Police said they never found it. Maybe you will? It was his favorite toy when he was a little kid. He slept with it curled up in a little ball. He said it, uh, "kept the monsters away." I mean, not that he'd ever admit it. He was just a little boy, okay? He was the victim. Not them. The dron. Those boys were scared of you. Do you mind? This ball and chain kind of makes it hard to converse. You push them off their bikes at the pool? Bruise them? I scared them. I never touched them. Never came up in the first investigation, you bullying them. If I had told, it'd give Connelly more rope to hang me with. You know tha ??? stuffed toy after you killed him, Dylan? ?? Three little boys died. Someone's got to pay. Like the trash from the wrong side of the tracks. So, the whole neighborhood lies? Just the ones that matter. The cop, the wannabe cheerleader. The star witness who heard you take credit for the murders? Come on. Oh, u mean the attention whore? Year before the trial, she's running around school saying that she's got terminal cancer, right? And your lawyer never brought this up? I guess it slipped his mind. 'Cause you'reothing but trash. Did you kill those boys, Dylan? "Evil Triumphs." You wrote that. "When good men do nothing." That's the quote. "Evil triumphs when good men do nothing." Edmund Burke. Guess you're not familiar. We'll check out that witness. But if this is some kind of con... Spent half my life in here. I'm probably gonna die in here, too. I'm all out of cons. I didn't kill those boys. In court,you testified Dylan said,quote, "We killed those brats, bashed their heads in. It was fun" That was a long time ago. Why does it matter now He said you made it up. And you believe that weirdo? I found this in the court records,too. Restraining order you filed against your homeroom teacher. Claimed he was stalking you. What is this? Stalking, cancer... I mean, lp me out here,Heidi, 'cause from where I'm sitting you got a real problem with fact and fiction. Everyone said they did it, even our pncipal. Oh,so they must've,right? Dylan and Teddy poured pig's blood in assembly to protest the Rwandan genocide or whatever it was called,okay? They were freaks. ("Drain You" by Nirvana playing) Guess what I heard? When they found those little boys, their heads were like smushed pumpkins. Oh,my God,freak alert,12:00. I thought you'd be dead from cancer by now,Heidi. Um,do I even know you? From second grade, remember? I popped you under the jungle gym. I bet you killed those kids. Maybe we bash your head in,bitch. So,Dylan never actually said, "We killed those brats, bashed their heads in"? Teddy confessed to that cop,right? What else do you want? Homegirl basically made it up. No one questioned her story. Someone had to pay. Why not the Fishtown freaks? House of cards coming down. We go back to Connelly? And say what That your case sucked? How about "it's looking like a cover-up"? Checked out abandoned factories in Fairmont. Complaint came in the night of the murders. Six-foot-five homeless man, Caucasian,spotted in empty lot at the corner of Fifth and Allen. That's five blocks from the pool. And get this: the guy was agitated, freaked out, and covered in blood. Unis pick him up? No,complaint gets lost in the system. By the time it surfaces the next morning, our homeless man's long gone. Unbelievable. Gets better. Questioned Documents found what looks like a partial number in the upp right hand corner. Same kind of number evidence control uses in our investigations. You're saying the letter was mailed to Teddy from inside homicide? ???? Vera's canvassing shelters, soup kitchens in the area for a six-foot-five male. Needle in a haystack. Worth checking with the cops on homeless shuttle, see if they picked up any Jolly Green Giants on their sweeps. What about the letter? Well,evidence custodian back in '94 was a uni name of Jade Diaz. Only one who could've signed it out. Funny thing is,she transferred out of evidence control two weeks before the trial. You having a talk? Miller is. You realize this is a cop's career? A cover-up,too. Maybe. That's a big maybe. Step lightly. Always do,boss. You don't think she's ready to be back. Doer had to write it. Public never knew he taped up their eyes. Seen lots of evidence over the years. I don't recall that letter. Sorry. Oh. Well,according to your log, letter came in after Teddy's confession. Connelly must've seen it. But he had his doers, so he buries it. I'm due at roll call in 20. Want to speed this up? But you know the letter exists and you got access. So you mailed it to Teddy. You like being a cop? The job? Yeah. Me,too. Teddy hung himself. Two days ago. Oh... I thought you knew. Just turned 30 years old. What a waste. Wonder how he felt... when he got that letter? Knowing you believed in him. Only one in the world who did. Connelly interviewed the kid. Twelve hours Had me set up the tape for the confession. Tape? There was never a taped confession at the trial. You don't say. We know about the ta, Connelly. One that never made it to court. Don't you have open jobs to work? Bad guys to catch? Six-foot-five homeless guy,bloody, agitated,five blocks from the pool. He b enough for you? You saying I'm out of line? Pot calling the kettle black,bro. Excuse me? IAD's got it hard for you, and everyone knows it. That was a good shooting... bro. Someone's gonna take a fall. And from what I hear... you're their butt boy. Oh,yeah? l right, talk about the tape. You got no idea the kind of pressure we were under. Kid killers out there... must've been tough. They did it, but the little bastards won't own up. So what do you do? Let them walk? RUSH: Not a chance. So you brought in Teddy, the weak one. Crying about how he's innocent, how he wants his rights. Where were those dead kids' rights when they were being aten to death? They didn't have any rights. I already told you, we didn't do nothing. You saw those kids at the pool, though,didn't you? No. Not that day,we didn't. And you got mad at them 'cause they called you freaks, weirdoes. (laughs) Didn't they? No. Just you do that. You hit them over and over till they stopped moving. Just say it, and you can go home. And this nightmare is over. Don't you want to go home,Teddy? (crying): Yeah. Then just say it. We saw them at the pool. Then what happened? We stabbed them. You hit them, you mean,right? Thrill kill. Yeah... okay. We hit them. Over and over until they stopped moving. I want my mom. I want to go home. You got no right to judge me. Those boys did it. You sure about that... Connelly? Absolutely. Then why'd you bury the tape? VERA: My snitch swears he saw Big Foot here a couple hours ago. Your snitch's a money- grubbing pain in the ass. Yo! You seen a six-foot-five homeless guy here,mamacitas? I can just take you in for loitering. Been to every shelter, soup kitchen in the city. We're not gonna find him. Well,it's time to shut down Hooker Mart. No pay or play till you give me Sasquatch,ladies. JEFFRIES (chuckling): It's a fool's errand. They're not gonna talk to you. Look... you fly,I'll buy. Get me a couple of cold ones. You want to find someone? All you had to do was ask the right way, big boy. Where'd you get the dog, big man? We found it in your cart. From the Devil. You mean from the little boy,in the pool. How'd you know about that? 'Cause he's God,jackass. That's right. I see everything. I saw what you did to those little boys. I didn't mean to. Prove it. Tell me what happened. It was him... the Devil. He made me do it. All the evil in the world in those eyes. He ran... he dropped it. I took it... to show the world... what he did to those children. Looks like we got played. By the Devil himself. Put his cuffs on. DYLAN: What? Do it. (gans) You're pretty good. You had me going there. This how you get your kicks? Hey,I didn't lie to you... You were at the pool, standing over the bodies. We got a witness. You wouldn't understand. You're right. I got no idea what it's like to look into three little kids' eyes and beat them to death. Yeah,well,neither do I... You were standing over their bodies! You were holding Jack's bloody t in your hand! You want to believe I did it?! Then fine! Okay,I did it! I killed them! You're a monster... You've got no idea what that means. Why'd you tape their eyes shut? I thought I knew how cruel and ugly the world was. I was wrong. They were just kids. You know? We all were. Sometimes I dream that,um... they're still alive. And we all get to start over again. You saw Jack curled up with that stuffed dog? Are you sure? Like he was asleep. It was keeping him safe. Stooping pretty low bringing me in like this. Well,found your son's stuffed dog,Henry. Lil' Duke. It was left with him. Your son was,uh, afraid at nights. And your wife worked the graveyard shift. What's your point? Leaving him home alone with you. Night he died. You people are unbelievable. Those bruises Jack had. Dylan didn't give them to him,did he? I loved him. Ask anyone-- ask my wife. She's here. Look... you got the animals who murdered my child. Now,why don't you just leave well enough alone? Doesn't work like that. Hey,got to step out. Why are you doing this to us? I think you know why,Tanya. We lost our son. We're the victims here. You have no right. (chuckles lightly) What's it like? Cooking his meals, sleeping in the same bed, making love... with the man who killed your child? How dare you? My husband is a good man, decent, kind. It's so much easier to believe monsters do these things... not men. I don't have to listen to this garbage. We found Jack's stuffed imal. Lil' Duke. It was in the pool. He was holding it, just like he did at night when he was sleeping. I... I don't understand. Whoever hurt him loved him,too. I have to find my husband. If Jack was alive today... he'd be 24. A man. Able to protect himself. But he couldn't back then. He was just a little boy. Please,stop this. But you can protect him,Tanya. (retching) You can help him now. What'd you see,Tanya? (weakly): I don't know what I saw. You tried to forget, but you can't. It was the day we buried our son... that I saw... Honey. You found that. I've been looking everywhere for that thing. You must have dropped it. I miss him,honey. I miss him,too. He has flashlights in every room,you see. Why? Henry's always been terrified of the dark. He sleeps with the lights on. STILLMAN: You wanted to get caught. You were screaming to get caught. But no one listened. They already had Dylan and Teddy,the perfect scapegoats. But what gets you in the end is the people you love. Like what happened to you as a boy. I'm not following. Who locked you in a... dark room,Henry? Your wife isn't protecting you anymore. Enough with the act. I want a lawyer. I'm not talking to you. Fine. Maybe you should spend some time alone then. In the dark. No. locIf youk me in here,I'll kill you! I will kill you! You hear me?! Sit down,Henry. Sit down. Don't leave me in here. Please, don't leave me in here. STILLMAN: You promised yourself you would never let it happen again. No one would ever put you in the dark. Or they would pay. And that's why you taped their eyes shut. Make them pay forever. He was... he was a bad boy,that Jack. Sneang o So many... so many dirty d things in the dark... waiting for you. I told him to play inside with the others. Where it was safe. (sobbing): Nowhere is safe. It's darkness everywhere. Inside the house, inside the basement. de..Insi inside of me. Jack! How many times I got to tell you to put those damn bikes away? hi (wmpering): Don't. No. Please,Daddy. Don't leave mee. No,not the dark! (childre) atPlngease 't! He needs some help. (mockingly): Daddy.
