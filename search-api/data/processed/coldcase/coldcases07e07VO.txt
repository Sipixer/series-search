It has a swimming pool. Yes ! We don't know how to swim. Well, you can learn. - Right, Meesha ? - Yes, Mrs. Watson. You don't have to call us Mr. and Mrs. Watson anymore. We're family now. You can call us Alice, Kenneth. Mom and Dad. We already got a mom and dad. We're gonna set some rules. Curfew's 7:00 on school nights, 8:00 on weekends. Those streetlights cut on, y'all in the house. Hey, Meesha, look over there. Donalyn, roll up your window. ("P.S.K. What Does it Mean?" by Schoolly D playing) Donalyn, do you hear me ? I don't want you hangin' on that corner. My 11-year-old daughter died last week. Brain aneurysm. Sorry about your loss. That girl they found in the landfill back in '91... Donalyn Sullivan. Yeah. I tell you what I did... I get to go to my daughter's funeral ? Depends on what you got. I found her dead in the basement of my club. - When was this ? - November 18th. The morning after my 27th birthday party. We were having some plumbing done. Might have got hit with one of them pipes. Might've ? What'd you do with her body ? I wrapped it in this zebra rug I had. Put her in the dumpster behind Checkers on 29th. So you find a dead girl in your club, you toss her body in a dumpster instead of calling the cops ? I ran with the 26th Street Villains. If they'd caught me talking to some cops, I would have been six deep. What's a 14-year-old girl doing there in the first place ? Wild night. Could have snuck in. Now I know what her parents must have felt... losing a child. I want to do what's right. 18 years too late. Funeral home's holding my daughter's body. My wife is waiting for me. You said it was your birthday party, right ? I'm gonna need names. Club was abandoned in '97. The city's got ownership now. Hmm, your tax dollars at work. The M.E.'s office confirmed Donalyn was hit with an object. About one-inch round. Found a permit for a plumbing overhaul back in '91. Replaced lead pipes with galvanized. Detectives. Let's ???? at the pipe. Let's cut that section out. Perfectly good murder weapon. I'm guessing Sticky didn't have a permit for that. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Proudly Presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Sync:YTET- ÁµÉÏÏÂÎç²èµÄ°îµÂÖí</font> Read between the lines Donalyn Sullivan. 14-year-old foster kid. Biological parents both dead. She and her little sister Meesha moved in with Kenneth and Alice Watson April '91. Fourth foster family in five years. Seven months later, she's dead in a landfill. Assigned searched for predators. No recent rapes or regular pervs. Foster dad alibied out. In Baltimore with a friend the night Donalyn went missing. Foster mom was at home with the younger sister. Donalyn sneaks out, goes to Sticky's party. Next morning, foster mom files a missing persons. It's three weeks before her body's discovered at the dump. Hey, look who's back from the dead. Would of had a to-do with some notice. I thought I'd be hanging with the zombies till retirement. Still don't know how you did it, boss. Still got some juice upstairs, I guess. Glad to have you back, Kat. M.E.'s report. Piping in Sticky's basement fits the thread pattern on Donalyn's skull. Blood type's a match, too. Two items found on the victim. Picture of her biological mother and a busted audio tape. I'll take it to the sound hounds. See if they can work their magic. Let's bring in the foster parents and the sister, see if Sticky's club jogs their memories. You got it, boss. Hey, Nick. Still waiting on that doctor's report from you. - Thought that was more of an optional thing. - Only if you opt to wear the badge. I haven't seen a doctor since 1980. I don't even have one. Then find one. I don't believe it. I... Donalyn wasn't the type of girl to go clubbin'. More of a homebody ? Just wasn't all that social. She spent most of her time watching her sister. Got a guest list from Sticky's club that night. Recognize any names ? Friends of Donalyn's, maybe ? If she had friends, I... I didn't know any of them. Told the girls to stay away from those kids on 26th. You mean the kids at school ? These kids couldn't spell "school". Told cops back in '91 you were in Baltimore night Donalyn disappeared. With my pal, James McDonald. Fishing. You still got his number ? - Somewhere. - When'd you come back home ? As soon as Alice called, said Donalyn was missing. - She ever run away before? - Not that I know of. But Donalyn was a teenager. Had a mind of her own. She give Alice trouble ? Told Alice those girls didn't need sympathy. They needed discipline. You ever discipline them, Kenneth ? Alice got mad if I raised my voice. Didn't let me smoke anymore. Had all kind of rules. How was your relationship with Donalyn ? I was gone a lot for work. Did what I could when I was around. I took her to see Phantom of the Opera in New York once. She liked that. You and Alice divorced in '92 ? Losing a child like that... it just ripped us apart. So Ken being away, two foster kids, it must have been rough. Life of a trucker's wife. Might as well have been a single mother. You and Donalyn get along? Tried to create a family for her. Girl was mad at the world. Her mother was a addict. Died of AIDS. No father. A tough life for a kid. I was a first-time foster mom. Thought I could change the world. But what they say is true. It's harder with the older ones. "Ladies first" by Queen Latifah.</i> Meesh, I'm Queen Latifah. No, don't stop. - What does she want ? - Come on, you guys, keep going. I got homework. Hey,Donalyn,what do you say tomorrow we have a girls' day? Maybe... we could go shopping, get our nails done ? Whatever you want. Please, Donalyn ? What do you say ? Give me a chance ? Maybe ? I'll do it for the drama queen. Okay. I took what I could get. So Donalyn was close with her younger sister ? - Best friends. - Is that Meesha ? Yes. Convinced DHS to let her live with me after Donalyn died. Adopted her in '95. She's a doctor at Children's now. You're reopening my sister's case ? After all this time ? I don't understand. Got a new lead. You ever hear of Sticky's on 26th ? Club was owned by Virgil "Sticky" Jones. Yeah. She'd sneak up there whenever she could. Is that where she was killed ? I thought she ran away. You recognize any of these names ? How'd she get out of the house ? Just went out the back door. You ever tell your parents about Donalyn's night life ? I wanted a family, Donalyn didn't. After she left, after I thought she left, all I had was my mother. What about Kenneth ? Never saw him after they divorced. He was never much around, anyway. Wait... Zen. I remember him. Friend of Donalyn's ? I wouldn't go that far. We met him the first week in the neighborhood. He messed with the wrong new girl. Let the crowd get hype, then I'm about to strike him And watch me give him dap with a fist full of lightnin' So cool off, you don't want it with me "'Cause I freeze up suckaz when I cold get busy," "especially you, man, your style's a disgrace, you got a messed-up fade" "and your chain's a fake. And look at her," "she ain't fresh at all, she got dirty shoes" "and her clothes are small. I'm the black Balboa" "and I'm trained to brawl." "The only trainin' she got is a trainin' bra." "You got a mouth full of rubbish I'm-a take out the trash" "Here's a penny for my thoughts, "'Cause you prob'ly could use the cash "You a broke-lookin' player, a faker, a straight fool. " "Word on the street is that you got a little issue." You funny, right ? This is my street, bitch. 26... we never forget. I see you again... gonna earn my bones. Come on, Meesh. I always thought she was fearless, but she was just a little girl. Zen was a 26th Street Villain ? Heard he shot a guy for his Jordans. Happen to know his real name ? Yeah. I think Zeb Edwards. Thanks, Meesha. You'll let me know if you find anything, right ? All right. So, Zeb and Sticky were 26ers. Maybe Zeb ran into Donalyn at the birthday party. Got back at her over that "little issue" of his. Zen ? - Just Zeb now. - Zeb Edwards : popped in '92 for ag assault, '93 criminal conspiracy, 94 possession with intent. People say this and that. But 26ers never forget... what you told Donalyn Sullivan after she outspit you on 26th. Come on. I changed. Look,I'm a family man now. Were you at Sticky's birthday party in '91 ? Nah, it wasn't me. Why were you on the guest list, Zen ? Start talkin' straight, or I take out the bracelets. What you wanna know? The night Donalyn was killed, you two still beefin' ? - Nah, me and Sugar Dawn, we was friends by then. / - Sugar Dawn ? Yeah,it's the name I gave her. What kind of friendship you have with a 14-year-old girl ? Nah, it wasn't like that. I was her manager. Yeah, turned her into a bona fide MC. Back then, you either was a talent or you found the talent. All right, look, you wanna do this, you gotta look the part, all right ? Here, put this... Damn ! Not like I'm gonna hit you. I can do it myself. All right, where the earrings and the ring I got you ? You gotta put 'em on. Put your rings on. "Act Like You Know" by MC Lyte.</i> Put the hat on. Cool ? Ah, now there she go. That's Sugar Dawn. Zen, get the little girl outta here. Yo, she's dope, man. She got mad skills. Hey, you was on 26th and Sergeant first day me and my sister moved over there. Yo, Sugar Dawn, go ahead and spit that 16 real quick. "Fly Philly diva, sicker than emphysema" "Make you follow the leader in my Jetta" "four-seater Guys love Sugar 'cause you know they want to meet her" "Girls want to join her 'cause they know they can't beat her." Yeah, yeah. I got it. Yo, I'm tellin' you, man, she's gonna be the next Antoinette. She just another girl on 26th thinks she can rap. "I said it once, I'm-a say it again" "I'm like Nikki Giovanni" "when I pick up the pen" "So, Go Tell It on the Mountain" "I'll take it back to the Motherland now And I don't need a black medallion..." I know I can rap. All right, you can stay. Man, the only reason why y'all lovin' her is 'cause she's still in diapers. She a baby MC. I mean, she look like me, y'all got her rappin' like me, but she ain't me. Oh, I don't know. I think she got you there, Big Soph. Who, her ? - Man, get your finger out my face. - I know that's not what just happened ! I know you didn't just disrespect me like that ! You know, you getter watch your back ! Don't let me catch your ass on 26th, 'cause I got you ! I should've protected Sugar Dawn more. Big Soph was crazy. She at Sticky's party that night ? Yeah, she got a big recording contract. Sugar Dawn was supposed to spit for a contract, too, but she never showed. Yeah. Yeah, it was the night the Phillies ended the game on that triple play. You remember who was workin' the parking lot ? Last name Parker ? Emil Parker ? He'll be back Saturday ? All right, thanks. So, any luck with the foster father's alibi ? Number Ken gave us for James McDonald was disconnected back in '97. Ran down the forwarding number. There's no answer. Uh, where's mine ? I thought you gave up the cow. I'm gone a couple weeks and all of a sudden I'm vegetarian ? A/V department was able to save part of Donalyn's audiotape. Listen. Different foster homes but don't none of them care</i> And I hate to see my sister cry, 'cause that ain't fair </i> She's too young to understand how we ended up here</i> So I promise that'll change every single new year.</i> A/V's trying to rescue the rest of the tape. And I've been harassing DHS to open Donalyn's file. Know a gal over there. I'll,uh,reach out. Pretty heavy lyrics for a 14-year-old. Veronica's around Donalyn's age. I can't imagine her going through any of this. Thanks, Scotty. We got the big guns. The lieutenant and the lady detective. Deserve special treatment, being the voice of Philly Hip-Hop on Radio 99. And I'm on in 45. Looks like you're gonna miss drive time, Big Soph. Police harassin' another person of color's no big surprise. Ah, a couple of Philly cops don't scare you. Especially since you're so good with a razor blade. Served three years at Muncy for assault. Bitch had it comin'. You call me in for somethin' that happened a hundred years ago ? Remember Donalyn Sullivan ? Maybe you know her as Sugar Dawn ? Yeah, I remember Sugar Dawn. Yeah, me... me and Baby MC, we was cool. - You ever threaten her ? - She was a kid. Didn't tell her to watch her back ? Heat of the moment,maybe. You got signed with Killadelphia Entertainment in '91. Did. What's your point ? You got your big break at Sticky's on 26th. At his birthday party. So ? Same night and place Sugar Dawn was murdered. See where we're going now ? Like I said, I didn't see her. Donalyn was there to audition that night,too. She's dead, you're famous. Do the math. Look, Sugar Dawn was on 26th with the big dogs, but she was still wet behind the ears. I tried to help ! "Bad as a Mutha" by Queen Latifah.</i> Oh, you like rap music ? Hey, man... Yo, Baby MC, come here. For real, come here. I ain't gonna do nothin', all right ? How much you sellin' your tapes for ? A Hamilton. You buggin', right ? Zen didn't tell me how much. All right, check this. Look at homeboy over there in the fake Karl Kani's. You ask him for ten, he gonna shut you down. That's a five-dolla' brotha'. So you only charge people what you think they'll pay, see ? And another thing, you want to take all this off. All what off ? All that jewelry, unless you trying to get jacked out here trying to look like Big Soph and all. Come on. You still in diapers, so make it work. Never ask more than $15, all right ? Go do it. Go on. Go ahead. Hey, man, you like hip-hop ? Told you ! Where's my money ? - What money ? - From your studio time. - Zen said he'd front it. - Well, he didn't. Huxtable, she's just a kid. Is anybody talking to you ? Got $20. I could page Zen and see if he can bring some more. No, we're gonna find him together. Get in the damn car! Huxtable was serious about his paper. That was the last time I saw Sugar Dawn. When was that ? Two days before Sticky's party. That thing we talked about. Happy anniversary. Some guys bring flowers. A dozen roses ain't got nothing on six hollow points. You know I already got a piece. Yeah, but yours comes with too many questions attached. Still... think I could take it back ? Get some diamond studs ? Real ones ? No refunds, no exchanges. - Also, completely untraceable. - Seriously, Eddie. Look, you asked me what I'd do in your situation. A guy like that ? Well... Just be careful. You been under too long. Maybe things start looking kind of cloudy, huh ? Couldn't be clearer from where I'm standing. Scum out there wants you dead. - I'm just evening the odds. - Look, I told you before. I don't need protecting. Well, the beauty of a thing like this ? You can put it away. Forget about it. Unless the time comes when you need it. - Then you decide where you stand. - I already know where I stand. I'm just looking out, okay ? Diamonds, huh ? Wait. Let me think about it. Okay ? Huxtable, huh ? Whatever happened to good old street names like Chicken Legs and Fat Head ? Who's asking ? What can I do for you, detectives ? Mortuary playlist his idea or yours ? Keeps the mind active. Family business here is a long way away from that one-bedroom music studio you used to run. I'm still in the scene. I find underground talent. Post their songs on my blog. You know a Donalyn Sullivan ? Sure. She was a friend of mine. Remember her taking a ride in your Cherokee ? November '91 ? Just you and her ? - What are you getting at ? - Is that a yes ? Look, she was a little girl. Got an eyewitness, saw you throw that little girl in your Cherokee, take off down Broad Street. Okay, the whole neighborhood knew my family owned this mortuary. They knew I had money. Had to show them I was hard. Jack and Jill kid looking for some street cred. l had to play the game. We both did. What were you doing at Broad Street ? You know it's dangerous this time of night. What do you care where I'm at ? Everybody's not out to take something from you, little sister. Well you want your money, so there. That's all I got. Zen shouldn't have you out there. - I can take care of myself. - I got something for you. Back seat. James Baldwin. "Go Tell It on the Mountain". - I already read it. - I don't doubt it. I knew you were different. Don't need Zen turning you into one of Big Soph's clones. - Shoot, she ain't got nothing on me. - Your single sucks. Did you write it ? - Zen. - That figures. It's trivial. Trivial sells. How many tapes you sold today ? You got more inside you. Spit about something real. Not some cliche ghetto nursery rhyme. Oh, like you, college boy ? Fronting like your mommy and daddy ain't paying for your apartment on Chestnut. But I don't have what you got. You're more than just another MC, Donalyn. Everybody's got dreams. Don't mean nothin'. The difference is, you got talent. And you're smart. How old are you ? 14 and a half. And a half. What's that mean ? Maybe you should just be 14. - Let the half take care of itself. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Maybe. Hey,can you pull over at that pay phone for a minute ? Yeah. Um... I guess I got through to her. Cost her her life, though. Who'd Donalyn call ? Zen. She fired him right there. How'd he take that ? He was a 26er. So, how do you think he took it ? My father and I prepared her for burial. I hardly recognized her. Said you turned Sugar Dawn into a bona fide MC. Before me, she was just another girl roasting on 26th. But Sugar Dawn was looking to change her image. But she never told me. But she wanted to rap about more than cars and jewelry. She'd rap about a dog if I told her. - Sugar Dawn dropped you,Zen. - Please. I put her on the map. Well, the neighborhood map. But she wanted more. 14 and she already outgrew you. A 26er like you wasn't just gonna take that. Told you, I had nothing to do with what happened to Sugar Dawn. Y'all just be wanting to have the brothers all gripped up. You'll be gripping 20 years in Graterford, you don't drop that attitude and come clean. She fired me,all right? But that lasted about half a second. We on 1050 A.M.! I know it's only a indie station, but it's something. Skills of an MC boss... Go,go,go,go,go,go... Yo,we on the radio! All right,so look. Sticky's birthday party is tomorrow night, right ? Everybody's gonna be there. Now one of Sticky's boys promised me a one-on-one with Killadelphia Entertainment. You do "Goin' Off". I don't want to do "Goin' Off". What you talking about ? That's your single. I'm saying I want to do one of my own songs, Zen. - Spit about something real. - Aw, you playin', D, right ? - Come on, man, you're killing me. - I'm serious. What, you on some old Negro spiritual now from Huxtable ? Man, people don't dance to that. Maybe I just want them to listen. What do you know about life ? Nothing. "The room was pitch black when the chandelier fell" "The first time he reached out, I remember it well Whispered lies in my ear," "'cause he told me he cared" "I saw a different kind of Phantom In the way that he stared." What Phantom ? "Still my face can't reveal what I'm feeling inside" But you can see it if you look into my eyes Read between the lines. What are you talking about, D ? I do my song or I'm out. That's what I'm talking about. Girl blew me away with that song. Do you know who she was talking about ? Only heard the first verse. Next night at Sticky's party, I waited for her backstage. - She never showed. - Anyone verify that ? I got some names. She was like a little sister to me,man. If I'd have known she was in trouble, I would have done anything to protect her. You need to do what you need to do. I'm going to put you on blast, okay ? I...I wasn't expecting you. I got to work late. Just wanted to drop by. Everything copacetic ? Sit down. We about to have "the talk"? Uh, this thing that you did the other night. The gift I gave you ? - You didn't have to. - No. I wanted to. I'm saying, I like you either way. I don't need any grand gestures. Okay. Whatever my problems are, they're mine. I hear what you're saying. You want me to back off. I just need some room to maneuver. If that's what you want, that's what you get. Thank you. - Now,that thing... from the other night... - Yeah,I threw it in the Schuylkill. Well, no harm, no foul. - Got to do it the right way. - Just got to do it my way. Just got off the horn with James McDonald, foster dad's alibi. Finally grew a conscience, admitted that Kenny Watson's lying. - He wasn't fishing in '91. - So, where was he ? He was with his girlfriend Lisa Jackson up in D.C. Met her when she was 15. A/V finally salvaged the rest of Donalyn's tape. Got the other verses to her song. She called Ken the "Phantom". Guess he'd turned his eye on her. "He sees it, too, now he's telling me to run away." "But I got Babygirl with me. Where we gonna stay ?" Alibi's not the only thing Kenneth lied about. Mr. Watson ? Detectives ? Need to ask you some questions. Let me take the chains off. - Mr. Watson ? - You got to open that door right now. Perv knew we were on to him, boss. - Ate his gun before we could get him. - Took the easy way out. Should've killed himself in '91. Saved us the hassle. Any proof he was molesting Donalyn ? Jailbait magazines all over the place. Donalyn rapped about a Phantom on her audio tape. Think she was talking about Kenneth. Guy was a predator. Killed her to cover it up. We're gonna need more than that. Let's bring in Alice. Pick up Meesha,too.Find out what was really going on in that house. These are Donalyn's DHS records. Says she lived with a family called the Martins for a month, but not you ? It was the only time we were separated. She hated it there. Not the whole story, Meesha. Another girl reported she was abused there. Said Donalyn was,too. She never told me. She never told anyone. She ever talk about a "Phantom" ? Something she made up to scare me. "Lock your doors so the Phantom doesn't come." You know, kid stuff. Ken took Donalyn to see "Phantom of the Opera", though. Right ? What are you telling me ? Not me, your sister. But lately it's been getting harder just to pretend<i> 'Cause once again I see the Phantom when I see him </i> He sees it, too, now he's telling me to run away</i> But I got Babygirl with me, where we gonna stay ?</i> I remember that song... - I wasn't tryin' to hurt you. - Of course you were. He sees it, too, now he's telling me to run away</i> But I got Babygirl with me, where we gonna stay ?</i> What's that supposed to mean, huh ? Look at me, Donalyn. After all we've done for you. Man, he wants me outta here. He told me to beat it before something bad happened. - He didn't say that. - I've seen that look before. I know what comes next. - You don't know what you're talking about. - Think I'm some kinda little kid? You're 14. You don't know what I've been through. And I'm not about to let it happen again to me or my little sister. Let what happen again ? You say you love us, right ? Donalyn, please. I'm trying here. Kenny's trying. Meesha's trying. Everybody's trying but you. Oh, God. - Where are you going ? - I'm outta here. Donalyn, wait ! Don't go ! All this time... I thought Donalyn abandoned me. She was just trying to save me. You see Donalyn after that ? No. That was the last time I saw my big sister. What about Alice ? She said she stayed home all night with you. That true ? You divorced in '92. Irreconcilable differences. I'll bet it was a challenge when you found out about Kenneth'stendencies. There's no reconciling those,  right ? I-I don't know what you're talking about. You're protecting him ? Even now ? Kenny was a decent man. Hard worker, a good provider. No, he was a predator. He knew we had his number. There's a reason he offed himself. That's between him and God. He can't hurt you anymore, Alice. Can't hurt you or the girls. Tell us what happened. You'll feel better, I promise. He followed her to the club. To Sticky's ? I told him what she said. About taking Meesha away. He was supposed to talk some sense into her. But she wouldn't listen ? No. Said he hit her over the head with a pipe. He told me he killed her. It's a gripping story... Alice. What ? He couldn't have been at the club 'cause he was in Maryland. Lookit. Had a room at the Bethesda Inn with his 17-year-old girlfriend. Sevente... ? No. No, he-he came back home. He went after her. He told me. The only person who'd know Donalyn was beat with a pipe was the one did the beatin'... that's you. It's over, Alice. She was gonna take Meesha away. I couldn't let them go. You took Kenneth's side. No. No, God help me, no. I kicked Kenneth out. I wasn't... I wasn't going to let him near Meesha ! Please... tell Meesha I'm sorry. "It Takes Two" by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock.</i> Hey, Donalyn... What are you doing here ? We need to talk. Come on. I know you're angry, Donalyn, but you can't just keep running and dragging this little girl behind you. I've been taking care of Meesha all her life. Families talk. They stick it out. Well, we ain't your family. But you could be. You said it yourself, nothing happened. We're leaving tomorrow. Please, don't do this to Meesha. Meesha ? All you talk about is Meesha ! You don't care nothing about me ! Who do you think I'm talking about now ? You, Donalyn. Don't you want to be happy ? Hey, I'm not gonna pretend no more. I'm going out there tonight. I'm gonna get me a contract. Then you're never gonna see us again. You can't sing that song ! I won't let you take her away ! You're just a child ! Old enough to call our social worker. Tell her everything ! Then you'll never get any more kids ! Shut your mouth ! I won't let you do that ! You're not taking her ! Oh, no ! Donalyn ? Oh, God ! No ! Oh,no ! I'm sorry ! Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Donalyn ? Whassup, Philly ? It's your girl, Big Soph,</i> voice of Philly Hip-Hop Radio 99 FM. Gonna take you back to the '90s. Yeah, you know how we do it.
