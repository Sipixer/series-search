Found dead in an alley off Elkhart in the Badlands, morning of October 22, 1999. Cause of death : blunt-force trauma to the chest resulting in cardiac arrest. Assigned back in the day figured that 'hood, Gonzalo was looking for drugs, guns, or tail. Played for Double-A Reading. Guy could rake. Big league club invited him to spring training. Yeah, he'd have won a ring last season. The bat Eddie the Haitian says was next to the body. Bat could be a good match for the contusion that killed him. Initls: "ST." The proffer was asked out that. He said the letters were there already. Lumber could belong to one of his teammates. Nobody with those initials on the team. So now we got a dead baseball player's body being moved across town. Maybe our doer didn't want the lot connected to the body. I didn't even know there was a baseball diamond there. Detective back in '99 spoke to Jaime Reyes, Gonzalo's agent and a cousin, Juan de la Cruz. Says here Gonzalo's wife Piedad and son Andres washed near Key West day after his murder. Wanna double-check thastory along with this cousin. Find out what Gonzalo was doing on that field. I'll see what the agent remembers. Guy makes it all the way from Cuba, ends up ad in an alley. Oh, Cuban Pete's all over this one. Yeah, well... I'm half Puerto Rican. Maybe the doer's Puerto Rican. All right, everybody, listen up ! Sign-up sheet for the annual softball game against the fire department. We won't get hosed like we did last year. To that end, I've got a ringer in Patrol. The guy is unhittable. Been a rule change this year : mandated coed teams, so... - Sounds good. Sign me up. Can you catch ? Hell, yeah, I can catch. You throw like a girl ? You dance like a white guy ?

Located the victim's wife, Piedad Luque. All right. See ya later, Mom. Make sure you take the bus back. I don't wanna hear about you cutting through the park. Okay. Andres, ven aca. Please, sit. Does Andres know the circumstances around father's death? No. I never believed what they said Gonzalo was doing in that part of town. He was a family man. Wondering how Gonzalo could leave you and your son back in Cuba. He had no choice. None of this would have happened if they didn't taken baseball away from him. Who's "the" ? The Cuban government. They said he and some other players had contact with an American sports agent. That agent Jaime Reyes ? Yes. After the ban, it was a nightmare. No money, no food, no friends. That why Gonzalo left, to make a new start ? Hardest decision of his life, but once he'd made it, there was no turning back. *******03.20,1998 *** ********* And that was it. The last time I saw him. You had plans to join him ? When the time was right. Hell of a raft trip. Would have done anything to see him again. You stay in touch with him when he got to Philly ? It wasn't easy. Our phone calls were monitored ; letters opened. He mention any problem to you ? No. Juan said Gonzalo was very excited we would be joing him in America... Juan, his cousin. Yeah, he was my cousin. But Gonzalito was more like... like my little brother. I came to-to America... two months before he was killed. Juan, where were you the nigth Gonzalo was killed ? You guys are not Internal Revenue, huh ? I was, I was removing asbestos, off the bo at Liberty Towers. I worked my way up since then. You ever go to that old sandlot near Lancaster Avenue with Gonzalo ? Lancaster Avenue ? Yeah lot of pickup baseball games there. Familiar with it? Not that one. But Gonzalito-- he-he loved baseball. He would see a game and... stop to ask if he could play. He always had his equipment with him. Is this Gonzalo's bat ? No, not Gonzalo's. It's too heavy. He was a contact hitter. He could put the ball anywhere. You know anybody with those initials ? No. You play ball ? A little in Cuba. Pero olvidate-- when I got here, it was all work. Did youu happen to see Gonzalo the day he died ? I was busy working. He was training hard. Getting ready for spring training in October ? It what he loved. Couldn't believe all the things this country had given him. "537 Cuba" by Orishas. Oye,take off that garbage, huh ? ** ***** Mira. Take what you want, primo. - Primo... - It's all yours. Oye,can't have you looking fresh off the boat. You hungry ? ** You see this one ? This one's reserved for the day that Cuba's free of its oppressor. May it be soon... and may it be painful. Amen. Juan de la Cruz, welcome to the land of the Yankee imperialistas! Traidor...! .............. I still have that champagne. It won't be be the same when I can finally open it. ** On my father's side. I was born here,though. ****** ** ****** ****** Heo ? Chicos..... Gringa. No how much money did Gonzalo tends to make when he got called up, Juan ? Gonzo made seven dollars a month playing baseball in Cuba. He had no idea about millions. His,uh, agent managed everything. Jaime Reyes ? And his agent managed his money, too ? After he died, Reyes tried to screw Piedad out of what money was left. Detectives. Bourbon water ? No. We have so questions about your former client Gonzalo Luque. We spoke to Gonzalo's widow. She said it was your contarcect with him that got him banned from baseball in Cuba. I offered him freedom and a better way of life. And what'd you offer his widow after he died ? Everything Gonzalo had left, which wasn't much. He did what they all do : fancy cars, nice clothes, jewelry. We understand you managed his money. I run a full-service agency. There's a problem ? His widow thought that he should've been more of that money left over. Piedad never quite grasped the probate proces. Exactly how much did she grasp ? Lay the money out for us, Jaime. I'm gonna have to find Gonzalo's records. It could take a day or two. I put everything in off-site storage when we moved to our new offices. Well, you've done quite well for yourself. I started with a desk in my garage. Cuban players are good for business. Well, now, yeah, but.. Gonzalo was my first. With his skills in today's market, forget it, you're talking about top-of-league money. Watch this. Watch this. "Que Bueno Baila Usted" by Beny More.</i> Savage,Gonlo,savage! It's hard for a guy like that to see someone who's been touched by the baseball gods. - Who's he ? - Eric Hynes. He got demoted to right field to make room for Gonzalo. That's him on the right. This Hynes ever make it to the bigs ? No. No, he popped a domestic assault charge. And he was arrested for waving a gun around in a nightclub. Eric "showtime" Hynes. Showtime ? ST. Same initials on the bat. Nothing like having a signed murder weapon. Hell, ah, I remember Gonz. Boy had wheels in center field. Shame he got killed like that. Killed like how ? Messing where he was messing. You mean the Badlands or that sandlot by Lancaster Avenue? You trying to cross me up or something ? You're still on probation. Getting ready to start a hitting clinic. Pass on my technique to disadvantaged youths. Oh, domestic assault ough to go over big with the baseball moms. Yeah, why don't you give us some pointers on... How you take out your competition, showtime. Where'd you get that stick ? At the crime scene. The giveaway... the "ST" right here. Technically,"showtime's" one word, Einstein. May time to change your name to Jailtime, just to get a jump on things. I gave that to him. Told him he could grow into it. You and Gonz buried the hatchet. That's rht. To tell you the truth, I always felt a little guilty when.. heard they thought he was uptown looking for a little something something. You introduce him to some of your bad habits ? Nah, Gonz was a pretty straight arrow. I just showed him how to roll. Hey,Ha. Want a nipple for that Cuba Libra nursing there? We call it a mentira. Translation, Havana. It's a lie. Cuba's not libre. Hey, how about that ? That's Marisol. Mm, she's bringing it tonight ! You want to take a cut at that, Papa ? No, I'm okay. Uh, no, you ain't. What you need is a dip in the Caribbean. What's up, E ? Hey, Marisol, Marisol ! I want you to meet my man here from Havana. Gonzalo. Marisol. Yeah, Gonzalo here is fresh off the boat; he needs someone to talk to him in his native tong. ******* Oh, my man ! "How do you want it ?" by 2Pac.</i> Marisol had an eye for the guys who were gonna pull down the coin. You know he had a and kid back in Cuba ? He never told me about that. Gonz was real lonely. Marisol help relieve him of some of that loliness on a nightly basis. You see them together before Gonzalo was killed ? I don't exactly recall. How about you ? How about me what ? Where were you the night Gonzalo got killed, October 21 ? Fall of '99... I was patroling center field for the Taipei Gida. Had a nice little run over there in Taiwan... till I snapped a hammy. Son of a bitch ! There he goes again, direspecting the furnishings. I lost my ringer. Turns out the guy's wife works for those fire-dousing ferries, and she treated to cut him off if he pitches for us. Slow or fast pitch? Slow. I played a little beer league. Called me the Golden Arch. Let's see it, Mickey D. Ready ? We'll see you on the field. Marisol, your name came up in an investigation. Gonzalo Luque. Like a decade ago, I've moved on. Heard you had a thing for ballplayers. In our line of work, we get badge bunnies. Not into cops. Too controlling. That's a shame. Gonzalo another notch on your bedpost ? Okay, what is this about ? Your boyfriend's found dead, and you don't come forward with information. He wasn't my boyfriend. Well, then, maybe another player in your roaster took exception to the hours you were keeping with Gonzalo. I told you we weren't together when he was killed. It was complicated. Uncomplicate it for us then. Broke my rule... and fell for the guy. How come every time I ask you about them, you change the subject ? You know how things are over there. I... want to know about my family. Andrecito looks just like you. ** *** I write, I call. She's being careful. - Things are not so easy for her. - What ? She... she's with someone else ? She filed for divorce. Gonzalito, what did you expect ? I'm losing myself here, primo. - I need to get my son back. - No, no, no, Andrecito is just a kid. It is too dangerous. ****** Nothing is impossible here Juan. I'm gonna do what I have to do to see my son. He had this whole other life I didn't know about. They split up, but he wanted to get his son back. He still needed her to bring him over. Not what I signe up for. That's when I knew it was over. All right. Agent Scarcelli's faxing me Piedad's INS file. Maybe shed some light on what happened in Cuba between Piedad and Gonzalo. They broke up. He must have been a pretty convincing guy, get her chaperone his son across the Florida Straits. It's still a ticket out Cuba. Can't say I blame her. Ever been ? Nope. Don't you want to see it before there's a Starbuck on every corner ? I'll leave that to the tourists and hipsters sporting Che T-shirts. I know too much about what happens there : sip mimosas poolside in Havana. Got something ? Let me see Gonzalo's immigration file. Sunburned and blistered. Look like she spent a week at sea the way Gonzalo did ? Not on a raft, she didn't. More like overnight speedboat ride, point-to-point. Divorce wasn't the only thing Piedad was lying about. How was it you got to America, Piedad ? I told you already. You also told us you were married to Gonzalo. Failed to mention that you filed for divorce back in Cuba. Neighborhood spies were watch us. The divorce made it easier for us to escape. Or maybe you were pissed off 'cause he ditched you, came to Amica, got rich and dipp into who knows what ? No. When Gonzalo got suspended from baseball in Cuba, it destroyed him. He had to leave. But you divorced him after he defected. I had no choice. When Gonzalo came to America, the government threatened to take our house. I was protecting Andres. Divorce meant survival. We're trying to solve your husband's murder, but you keep lying to us. You look pretty good for just coming off a raft, Piedad. If you tell us again how you brought your two-year-old on a 90-mile raft trip. Andres is gonna come home to see his mom being hauled away in cuffs. - I was affraid... - Of what ? The man who brought us here. ******** *** **** ****** **** ****** ******** ** *********** *** ** ***** **** **** ** ******** **** Hello ? Hello ? Gonzalo went to see this man. In Miami ? No. He was in Philadelphia. He arranged the whole thing ? Yes. You think this man killed your husband ? Yes. We need a name, Piedad. All I have is my son. They already took Gonzalo. - You want to be safe ? - Yes. You make this right and tell us who did this to Gonzalo. The men called him "Oz". That's all I know... internal recycling ? Nope. But an old CI of mine is. Goes by Clifford. - As in big red dog ? - As in white boy with dreads. Guy's a walking Ghetto pages of the illegal import/export biz in Philly. He collects cans on the side ? Sells to the addicts after they get their returnable money. - Enterprising. - Yo, Clifford ! They try to do me like Rodney King ! Shut it, Clifford. If I stroke out, the last thing I gonna do is shoot your dumb ass ! Yo, blue, I ain't holding. That's good 'cause we need a name, Clifford. Oh, snap ! You looking tight, baby girl. - Didn't know it was you. - Called me "baby girl" again... I apologize for triculating. Clifford is at your service. Guy's name is Oz. You heard of him ? You trying to see the Wizard ? Why didn't ya say so ? Here to see the Wizard. Grab the rack. Come on. Osmany Leon. Take a walk. Come in. Sit down. Cafecito ? We're here about Gonzalo Luque. You smuggled his family out of Cuba. I don't even own a boat. Fence, import/export contreband... 'cause I'm guessing fluff an' fold ain't the one thing you were into. I'm a legitimate busiman. I'am a member of the Chamber of Commerce. Representing what ? The lollipop Guild ? I'd hate to disrupt your business here, Osmany. Screw up your cash flow, dinging your name on the street. You gonna shut me down ? Okay. Or you could tell us why you held Gonzalo's wife and kid in a motel room in Miami till he came up with more cash. It's important to give back to the community. Reunite families. Long as they pay the freight charge. Sounds like Gonzalo had a problem paying up. Bish to D4. Mate in two. Nice. I'm calling the cavalry. Have 'em toss this place. Gonzalo Luque and I had mutual interests. He wanted to get his family back and I wanted to send a message. Tranquilo. I did what I was told, paid my money, and now you tell me there was a problem ? These are the people that your friend arranged for me to pick up. Piedad and Andres. And... No, no. - Where ara my parents - You know those two ? Teammates back in Cuba. Look, this is a mistake. I paid for my family ! That's right. 40,000 was the family discount. Ballplayers are a premium. Reyes never told me about these players ! Well, that makes two of us, Gonzalo. You tell Reyes I need another 40K. I want my family ! Desgraciado ! Oyame. I get my money and you get your wife and son back. The rest its between you and your agent. Now, buena noches, Gonzalo ! Gonzalo wanted to reunited with his family. I respect that. But Gonzalo thought Reyes was gonna get his entire family over. We were both being gamed. Reyes came up with the money ? That same night. And I kept my word. I released Gonzalo's wife and son. Who were these players ? I like to look at the box scores. Lots of interesting information. Those are some big names. Gonzalo go to see Reyes ? Wouldn't you ? Come over if you want but... The only thing you have to worried about is... I'm in the middle of something here. Yeah, you were. This guy takes a whole lot more than ten percent. Please ! Butch, give me five minutes, okay ? Signed for $6 and $8 million a piece. That's a tiddy commission. They were worth it. Worth having Gonzalo's wife and kid held for ransom ? That's it. I'm calling my attorney. Why ? Only thing you need to worry about right now is immigration violations. But we'll leave that up to the feds, huh ? Unless you killed him. Look. Gonzalo wanted his familly here. I said to him that I was gonna take care of it. I didn't want him getting mixed up in that mess. You mixed him up real good, but you couldn't fool the great and powerful Oz. I was gonna fix it... By stealing Gonzalo's money to smuggle players out of Cuba Big league talent. Can see why you wanted those players so bad. Baseball players are a prized possession to Castro. By liberating them, I stick it to that bearded bastard. You're a real freedom fighter. Using Gonzolo's account to stake your little empire. Only one problem, Reyes. You got caught. I didn't kill Gonzalo. But he wanted to kill me. I trusted you, Jaime. You're looking at this the wrong way. How else am I supposed to look at it, huh ?! My wife and son are being held hostage and my parents are still in Cuba. Don't worry about it. We'll get 'em out. And I'm gonna cut you in on the deal. Wrong. I'm cutting you out. You fix this, and then we're done. Come on, Gonzalo. Gonzalo, don't. Come on, Gonzalo. I got a scout coming. He's going to try out your cousin. We're gonna make it work. I tried to tell Gonzalo but he didn'd want to hear it. I put the money back in his account. His cousin Juan-- what did he have to do with this ? Juan was the first Cuban player I ever tried to contact. His fastball used to top off at 95-plus. His change-up was a de-cleater. - Used to ? - Yeah, by the time he came over, the guy had lost it. But Gonzalo idolized Juan. k hands. Nice. Checked out Juan's story. Got some major holes. Starting with his immigration file. Turns out, Juan was on Gonzalo's raft. Wet-foot/dry-foot. Gonzalo reaches dry land and stay, Juan gets arrested in the water, sent back to Cuba the same day. Bet you that it was warm homecoming. 16 months later, Juan takes another raft, lands on Key Largo. Picked up along with five other rafters begging for water at a tbar. That and Juan's alibi has got many holes as softball team. Where'd you say you were working again ? The day Gonzalo was killed ? Liberty Towers. Construction a security. I spoke to your boss. Said you were working a jobsite off Lancaster Ave. Next to the lot where Gonzalo was killed. You think I killed him ? Gonzalito was like my brother. Didn't play just a "little" ball in Cuba, either, Juan. You pl with your cousin in the Cuban League. Right with the Industrials. What did they call you ? - *** - The cannon. Must have had a hell of a fastball. Till you and Gonzalo were banned from playing in Cuba. You were with Gonzalo on that raft. Gonzalo made it to dry land. You didn't. Got your repatriation order from immigration. April 6, 1998. Gonzalo got to stay. They sent you back. You went back to Cuba as a traitor. They threw you in prison, Juan. This is my grandfather and his older brother. The revolution split 'em up. One to Philly, the other to Castro's jails. Decades go by. My grandfather gets word from Cuba his brother's dead. A month later, my "abulo" is gone. From what ? Heart attack. My father, workingstiff said, "His heart didn't stop. It broke." What happens in Cuba stays with us. I know what they do to traitors in prison, Juan. Ballplayers ? They ripple 'em. Put you back out on the street, as a warning the others. It isn't just a game, is it Juan ? If I would have just made it that day... on the beach... You'd be playing baseball right now. Gonzalo would still be alive. All this time, we couldn't figure out why his body was moved from that sandlot. Then we realized, Epispal was only a few blocks away. You went to get the car. You were trying to get your cousin to the hospital. I was trying to save him. We know you didn't mean to hurt your cousin. You just... lost control. We're trying to help you here, Juan. He didn't make it. Eso, eso ! Juan. The canon is resurrected ! I heard the canon from the car, and I had to hit something ! What happened ? ******* In Miami? - SO - ye,primo,congratulati No. Reyes screwed me. That son of a bitch-- he gave my parents' spots a couple of ballplayers. ** ***** He thougth I was stupid, but I took care of it, got rid of him. You did what ? I fire him. Reyes was gonna get me a try out. Scouts were gonna... - Hermano, I'll get you the tryout and scouts.- When they see your fastball... Hey, man, you know what ? This is your first out right now. Now, give me the cannon. Come on. ***** I know you got it, man. *** Juan ? You okay ? You need to warm up more. Throw more pitches, man. It's just that you don't know. Don't know what ? You don't know what they did to me over there. ****** I'll pitch too, heh ? Hey, Juan, man. - I can't. - Yes, you can ! Mira, primo, no importa. Don't worry about, huh ? - I'll take care of it, all right ? - What are you going to take care of ? Mi familia ? My parents ? Primo. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't even be here. Juan, what are you talking about ? ** I built that raft ! I know that. To get us here. I know. To get us here ! Us ! They sent me back. - Everything's gonna be okay now, Juan. - No, it's not ! It's not. You want to know what they did to me in there ? Every time they broke my arm, they laugh at me. Se reyan de me ! We got a single, and we got a triple ! And we got a home run ! - Juan... Juan. - They took my arm. They took my arm away ! I have nothing. I have nothing ! I have nothing. No tengo nada ! Primo, no tengo nad... Primo ? Gonzalito ? Gonzalito ! Primo. Primo... Somebody help me ! Primo. Primo. Primo. Primo...
