It was about melding hearts and minds. How about melding your mind to the question ? I'll tell you the same thing I told the Man back in the day: I'm a pacifist. Pacifist whose organization bombed a draft station ? Terrorist Task Force could snap on some gloves, reinvestigate. I'm guessing you got a little more to lose now, Reuben. All right, maybe I had words with that GI. It doesn't mean I laid a hand on him. This about Daisy ? She your girlfriend ? Girlfriend ? It was free love, man. Only GI Joe wasn't hip to that. One, two, three, four ! We don't want your stinkin' war ! "Something in the air" by Thunderclap Newman.</i> Annabelle ? Want to know how it ends ? David. What are you doing here ?

You guys got a file a mile long on me, and you're telling me that you don't know who she is ? Humor us. Annabelle Bennet. The honorable congresswoman from New York. - Congresswoman ? - I didn't know. And your director just happens to open the case ? Listen, the director's motives are over my pay grade. Feel free to back out any time. Oh, I don't cut and run. Detective Vera, Detective Valens. Wow. Two of you for a break-in. Well, it's a slow day for homicides. Roy, honey, Nick's the one I... One of your high school sweethearts ? Which one are you ? The hockey player or the A/V guy ? Uh, hockey. A/V guy ? I'd love to stroll down memory lane, but... Yeah. Looks like he punched it in. Jewelry the only thing missing ? As far as I can ascertain. Tell us again what you saw. Well, we came home from dinner. Wednesday's our date night. Only if you promise. I promise. There's somebody in the house. Stay here. Guess I scared him away. You heard glass breaking after Roy entered ? Yes. That sound right, Roy ? All happened so fast. Probably just a crime of opportunity. Easy there, Kojak. We'll get some techs down here, to dust for prints, take some pictures of the door. Hey, you can't go in there. Excuse the intrusion, Congresswoman. So the FBI just barges in now ? When you keep us waiting an hour. Should I call security, ma'am ? We just need a moment of your time. Agent, do I need to get your assistant director on the line ? Sorry but, it can't wait, Daisy. I chair the subcommittee that votes on Bureau funding. You think that you're the first agents to land on my doorstep ? Congresswoman, I'm a Philly homicide detective, and I could care less about your political affiliations. I'm here to solve David Quinn's murder. What happened to him ? That's what we're here to find out. David cut through 500,000 people to find you. Not too many guys do that. He was stubborn. And I was foolish enough to believe in love at first sight. No matter how much we'd changed. "Colours" par Donovan. Found your note at the info booth. How'd you like it ? "Anything worth living for is worth dying for." "And anything worth dying for... is certain worth living for." I must have read it 50 times. Got home, needed to get my head straight. A month turned into two. Can't imagine what it was like. You hear these stories. Whatever you've heard, it's worse. What happened to you ? Well, now that I've found you, I... I'd rather not waste time talking about it. Oh, man, I think that's Joan. You want her, you got her. Come on. Careful. The most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I know what you mean. We're getting drenched. Come on, let's get out of here. We ran until we found a barn, and slept there. Never met anyone else like him. That's the last time you saw David ? Went to check in with some friends the next day. Um, got back, and he was gone. Do you remember the name of the farm ? It was a dairy farm, I think. Past a fork in the road and a windmill. I ran into some kids the next day who told me they tried to shack up there. Farmer chased them off with a gun. What's happening ? Jimmy Mota-- that piece of garbage who attacked your mother. Yeah ? What about him ? Took a deal. Three to five, sent him to Graterford. Oh, you got to be kidding me. Could be out in 18 months on good behavior. Thought you should know. Yeah. Thanks. Prints back on that burglary job. Most belong to the homeowners, except for these. Shelly Hewit. Teaches AP math over at Jefferson High. Got an AFIS hit off her mandatory background check and fingerprints. And she's got a few shoplifting charges on her résum a couple of years back. Megan works over at Jefferson. Maybe they're friends. Must be special friends 'cause the print concentration was on the bedposts and the headboard. Pop quiz, Shelly. What didn't you disclose on your job application ? Kleptomania was a by-product of my depression. My therapist said it made me feel alive. It work ? Till I got caught. Do you know Megan Easton ? Teaches history. Just "hi" and "bye" in the break room. Ever been to her house ? No. Help us out. - Megan's house was broken into. - Jewelry taken. What does your therapist say - about breaking and entering ? - I didn't take that jewelry. But you were in her house, right ? Your prints are all over. Headboard and bedposts, to be exact. See, what I can't figure out is why someone would break into someone's house, play patty-cake with the bedposts - and then just steal some jewelry. - Okay. I was in the house. But not to steal. What the hell are you doing here ? I've been calling. You said you were going to leave her. My... my wife is outside. Shelly, please. She's probably calling the police right now. I wore something special for you. Look, we'll say there was a break-in, okay ? The-the guy took the jewelry, okay, and, uh... and, um... and I chased him away, okay ? Don't you love me ? Of course. Of course I do, baby. Yes. Of course. Of course, baby. Look, we'll go away somewhere nice. - Do you mean it ? - I promise. Okay. You pack a bikini, all right ? So, let's get out of here before the cops come, okay ? Out the back. Please, all right ? - I'll call you. - Okay. "Bikini." Took me to Cleveland for a mortgage broker conference. Let me guess... Roy still plans on leaving his wife. We're in love. You keep drinking that Kool-Aid, honey. So hard to find a good guy, you know. Do you still have the jewelry ? Roy wanted me to pawn it, but I... I couldn't do that to Megan. Thought you could use some company. Well, I've got a U.S. News & World Report from '07 and a Highlights magazine. We don't have to talk. What else are we going to do ? I meant... you... want to be alone. I get that. How's your mother ? Stroke. They're not sure if they caught it in time. They let you in to see her ? Didn't know what to say. I mean, here's this woman who raised me. All I can see is this person I spent my whole life trying not to be like. I resented her for being a housewife. Most of all, I resented how proud she was of her life. So tell me... Yeah. What have I got to be proud of ? So this is Woodstock. There's the fork in the road. Annabelle said there was a windmill. Let's check it out. Can you believe that soldier came all the way out here to find her ? I guess he thought she was the one. What about you ? What about me ? Well, I just figured you had a guy back in Philly. Let me guess... a cop. And your last girlfriend was a 24-year-old paralegal, right ? Twenty-five. Grad student in biology. And she was my fiancée. What happened, she remove you from her profile ? Head-on collision two years ago. Sorry. I certainly know how to kill a moment. No, I... it's good to know who I'm lost in the fields with. We're not lost. Look, there's the barn right there. Come on, we're getting soaked. You always point a gun at everyone that comes on your property ? I got a right to bear arms, protect my livestock. You want to tell me what this is all about ? Woodstock. Milk trucks couldn't get through for days 'cause all the love buses they had blocking the roads. A soldier... David Quinn... he might have stayed in your barn ? What happened to this kid ? He was shot and killed. Ever own a .38 ? No, ma'am, just what you see there. Said his name was David. He was hooked up with some of them bohemians, but this kid wasn't like the others. I trusted you, Daisy. How could you ?! - Reuben, you're upset. - You knew about Xavier. You were the only one I told. It's time for you to beat feet, pal. Baby killer's a part of it, too. Admit it ! Stop it. Stop it, David, please ! "Piece of my heart" by Big Brother and The Holding Company.</i> This is who you want ? Reuben, wait. Got to talk to him. Annabelle. Made a mess of my barn. You think those tags are a joke ? Men die for the honor of wearing those. No, sir. I earned these the hard way. First Infantry. Big Red One. Why didn't you say so ? 101st Airborne. Tiger Force. He helped out around the farm. Bued hay, mended a fence. Sounds like a good army man. I wouldn't expect anything less. I was in 'Nam myself. Picked up a packet of shrapnel and... Damn war did a number on all of us. David ever mention this Xavier ? No, he just took off to find his girl. Hey. What, did you get a break in the case ? Sit down before I knock you down. All right, look... I made some mistakes. Save it, and before you try and throw Shelly under the bus, I know the whole break-in thing was your idea. No, i-it wasn't my idea. Look, things just got out of hand. What got out of hand was you banging your girlfriend in Megan's house. Oh, I get it. What, you still got a thing for Megan, huh? Listen to me, scumbag. You got one shot to make this right. You take that jewelry and you get it back to Megan and you tell her the truth. You remember what that is, right ? Now, get out of here before I lose my appetite. Here. I got it. You want to run it under hot water... ...tap it and twist. You with the advice. Veronica has been seeing her dad every other weekend. Not my place. Actually, she seems... happy. That's good. Here. Come on, give it up. I might have underestimated you. Well, wouldn't be the first time. It never sat right... the way we left things. Well, you went to New York. I didn't want to be the gal who slept around the department. Is that how it was ? Come on, John. We wound up together... any promotion I got would have been suspect. Never thought of it that way. Men don't have to. I wanted to be taken seriously. Did you find what you were looking for ? Yeah, I thought I did. Now they're going to take that from me. - 'Cause of the Shepard case ? - I don't retire, they're going to just pack me up to Anchorage. You gonna go back to New York ? Don't know what's going to be left for me here in Philly. What do you got ? Lenny "Xavier" Franklin... Reuben's second in command... was arrested two days prior to Woodstock for attempting to bomb a courthouse. This from the PRS file ? COINTELPRO. Back in the day, we had a rat in every camp. You're saying someone clued the FBI in on Lenny's plan ? Bureau safeguards the informant's identity by assigning them a series of classified numbers. So who has access to these numbers ? Well, the informant's handler and supervisor... ...and now us. Meet RM#157268. Annabelle wasn't a hippie chick. She was working undercover for the Bureau. So she was informing on Reuben. Could be David got in the middle. This comes out, our liberal congresswoman's image will be tarnished for good. Welcome to the FBI. Narcotics. - What ? - The cop, guy in Philly... he's... undercover somewhere. Yeah, just the way it is. And... I'm sorry about your fiancée. You know, in some ways, you remind me a lot of Yates. Well, without the... chip on her shoulder ? And the foot in her mouth. You'd make a good agent. Two more beers. - All right. - All right. Then I say... Hold on a second. Lose something ? No, no. Yeah. The keys. I'm sure they're back in the restaurant. Uh, they're right there. No. Okay, let's see, uh, wet roads this time of the evening. Ah, I'd say it'll take AAA about three hours to get here. You know, I had a blind date once who locked his keys in the car on purpose because he thought he'd spend more time with me. Oh, yeah ? Did it work ? Careful. Maybe we shouldn't drive. Yeah. Gambling with your career, you better be damn sure you know what you're doing. Feeling lucky, like I have the winning numbers. 157268. Sound familiar ? Your old informant ID. Here's another number for you-- FD-395- FBI Advice of Rights form-- just in case we have to arrest you at the conclusion of this interview. Perhaps I need to speak to my lawyer. Well, that's your prerogative. Of course, the press might have her file by then. Left wing Democrat informing on an anti-war organization ? That's a front-page scandal. I got busted for pot in my dorm. The FBI saw an opening. Promised me they could get the charges erased. If you informed on Reuben and his organization? I didn't want to disappoint my father again. What happened after you left Reuben ? Did you see David again ? Truth is, I was lost. Only thing that made sense was him. That guy, Reuben... you love him ? I got people in trouble. Narced on Reuben, his friends. Betrayed him. Why ? Had no choice. At least that's what I thought. I don't know what to believe anymore. You know, the other night with you... that's the first night I've slept in a year. I did things over there... things I can't ever undo. You had to survive. I fulfilled my obligation. Volunteered the first time. I don't want to go back. That farmer, uh... he's going to buy my old beater. And the money will be enough to get us to Canada. You're asking me to run away with you ? We can start all over. Get things back to like they were on the bus. - It's not that simple. - Yes. Yes, it is. Wait for me here. I don't know, David. It's okay. I do. "Get together" by The Youngbloods.</i> I waited around a couple of hours until I realized how crazy it all was. David came back for you. I don't understand. He crawled through the woods and died under that tree. I had a chance. I didn't take it. I never felt that way again. Director instructed us to keep your involvement out of the press. Thank you. Hey, Jimmy, give us a minute. What's up ? - You talk to Roy ? - About what ? That son of a bitch. Is this about the break-in or Roy ? He's cheating on you, Meg. The investigation took a turn, and it... turns out he's having an affair. Who is it ? Does it matter ? What does the break-in have to do with my husband cheating ? She was there that night. I'll spare you the details, but long story short, your... genius husband staged that robbery to cover it up. Guess I should have seen it coming. I want to know who you were texting It was business. Business that couldn't wait ? The-the Peterson deal is cratering. Can we go inside and talk this out ? Talk what out ? Look, don't want to fight anymore, baby. Please. How about we go away next weekend ? I'll leave my phone at home. Only if you promise. I promise. There's somebody in the house. Stay here. I just... kept thinking he was going to change. You can't blame yourself here. Nothing's turned out like I thought. What am I supposed to do now? For starters, you get rid of that bum. I'm 40 years old. Tough just to... start over. Things haven't gone exactly according to plan for me, either, so... Oh, Nicky. Never even asked how you're doing. Hey, you can't be in here. Got a sneak and peek warrant. We're taking a quick look around. I already told you, I had no beef with that soldier. I've got nothing but respect foanybody that served. See, that's what we don't get, Al. Why is a respectful vet like yourself getting into fights with other GIs? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, it says here you got into a brawl at an anti-war rally, brained a Veteran Against the War with a tire iron. Those men turned against their own. - Like David ? - Hey. Listen. He... Was going to run off to Canada. He helped me out, and he left. Well, then, how do you explain this ? It's a Ford Galaxie. David Quinn's car. Looked at your army records, Al. Wounded in A Shau. Board decided you weren't fit for duty, dismissed you. But you wouldn't give up. I can drive a tractor sunup to sundown, plow 800 acres of open fields, and I'm not fit ? David was fit for duty, but he didn't want to fight anymore. Look, you got to understand, I would... I would have died to go back. I tried to tell that kid, but he... - he wouldn't listen. - Tell him what? How much I love my country. I couldn't understand how another soldier would betray it. Going through my stuff ? Says you're due back at Fort Dix at 0600. Didn't tell me you were going back to 'Nam. Gonna hitch a ride back to base. Got the money for my car ? Do you one better, I'll give you a lift. No, really, don't sweat it. I insist. I'm not looking for a problem here. You a coward, boy ? What, are you... you going to force me to go back ? You have a duty. A duty to what ? War ? You must have seen stuff, too. What are you talking about ? Oh, come on, man. Tiger Force. Lurps. You were up close and personal. You u n't know what I saw. Know what I saw ? Children... ripped apart by bullets, women dragged into... into huts to do God knows what. Things I can't... I can't get out of my head. A little girl screaming in her... in her dead mother's arms. - Shut up. - Grip so tight, I have to... have to break her forearm just to get her free. Shut up! Shut up! I don't want to see that face in my dreams anymore. My girl's waiting. You got to go. - Honor your commitment ! - Why ? Why ? Why do I got to go, huh ? Tell me why !
