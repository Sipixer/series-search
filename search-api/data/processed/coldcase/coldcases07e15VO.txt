And those extensions ? They're awful. Something borrowed. Dan, help me. - With what ? - You want a hot bride, right ? Long hair, some makeup for once ? Well, I... I think Anna is beautiful. Well... There's a lonely groomsman in the bar who needs my company. See you at the altar. Don't lose those rings, cowboy. No, ma'am. My friends are very charmed by you, Dan. Oh, I'm-I'm glad. And I've been guaranteed page one of the society section tomorrow. He doesn't care, mom. This is the event of the summer. I have over a year in it. I care. It's been storybook. Now, maybe they'll let us into the Milton Club. Joan, let's leave 'em alone. Hey, thanks. Ed, you've been very generous. Well, she's my girl. You'll get the bouquet in the morning ? Bouquet, boutonnieres, veil. You two just get to the church on time. Yes, my mother is a social climber. And my sister's a slut. Yeah. But they're part of the package, babe. Well, honey, your dad's nice. "Sweet thing" by Keith Urban. For better or worse, right ? Anna... I can't go through with it. Hey. Looking sharp. Man, I hate weddings. Six hours talking to people you don't know. What's to hate ? Plus, Nova plays Uconn tonight. I'm guessing Louie ain't into hoops. How'd John get out of this ? He's at home, watching the pregame. Not too swift, huh ? Invites us, but not the boss. Why are we here ? I mean, I see Louie at crime scenes, what, twice a year ? I got roped into his bachelor party. At his chess club. Shoot me now. End of the night, though, after all the booze... I heard something interesting. Yeah ? That girl Louie's marrying... almost got hitched two years ago. Almost ? Groom called it off, night before. Few hours later, he's tossed off a balcony, ten floors. Cherry Hill regency. - Jersey cops clear it ? - Nope. Bride was top of the list, but they couldn't make the case. And now she's marrying Louie ? Hey, guys ! How you doin' ? Hey, Louie. Looking good. Yeah, you, too. You, too. See you in there, all right ? Yeah. Might not be such a boring night, after all. Cold Case Season 7 Episode 15 Two weddings This is really how we want to spend our night off ? Working a case ? It's that or the chicken dance. We gotta. For Louie. You go by Cherry Hill PD ? Yeah, buncha gorks. All glued to some football game. Basketball. And they weren't getting off their duffs for a Philly cop. You get anything ? Groom was Dan Palmer. Told this girl no-go on the wedding at midnight. Rough move. At 3:15, someone took him to task for it. Big scuffle on a hotel balcony, broken glass, tossed furniture... Dan hits the pavement. That's a lot of people with motive. Starting with the bride. - She give a statement ? - Whole family stonewalled. The lawyer swooped in, no interviews. Smart. Unfortunately. Who had access to the room ? It was a suite for the whole wedding party. So, anyone. Well, security recorded two key entries to the room, a few minutes apart, around 3:00 a.M. Dan and the doer. One other mystery : Dan had the wedding rings that night. But they were gone after the murder. Consolation prize. Poor Louie. Caught up with a black widow. I don't know. My mind goes to the dad. Humiliate my girl, stiff me for a hundred g's ? I say mom. Mess with the baby cub, she eats you up. She does look pretty fierce. I mean, what were you thinking ?! Go make a friend, Scotty. I got it. You're a bright spot on a dark day. Your daughter's wedding ? It's dark ? This isn't the man she was supposed to marry. No, huh ? He's probably a friend of yours. Louie... is more of an acquaintance. High school. Looks like you've climbed a rung or two higher than he did since then. I've done okay. Lawyer ? No. Banker. It's obvious, huh ? Well, Well, Anna went to Sarah Lawrence. Teaches at Whitman prep. That's classy. And he's a cop. - It's beneath her. - She's playing it safe. After the fiasco last time. Right. You know about it, of course. Everyone does. You like her first choice better ? That wedding was picture perfect. He was perfect. "Kiss a girl" by Keith Urban. All right, uh... glasses raised, ladies and gents. To Anna's mom, Joan, who chose the menu, the flatware, my suit. Get used to it, darling. And Ed, who let her blow all of his dough. But mostly to Anna... who found a stray on the side of the road and took him in. I was... aimless, never settling down... a lone cowboy. Of course, the... the beginning of something is the end of something else. But I have wandered enough. And all of those winding roads-- they led to you. I'm getting carsick. I love you. There are photographers here. We getting this load on film ? Ed, he's a prince. I don't trust him. I said give me one good reason. And ? "Too handsome." Ridiculous, right ? Sounds like Dan was the one that got away. He was Romeo. Tragic end and all. Couldn't have been too perfect though, right ? Getting cold feet ? I think my husband was behind that. No kidding. He didn't want the wedding to happen, and it didn't. Mrs. Coulson ? Showtime. I'm walking Anna down the aisle. - Where's your husband ? - Ex. Probably at the Pearl, boozing. He's not in touch anymore. Where's Vera ? Shoe issue. It's a quote. What'd you find out ? You're not so dumb. My dad theory ? Yeah, he had it out for the groom. And guess what ? He's not even here today. That's a conversation. Someone should track him down. Boss is available. Guy's watering hole is the Pearl. Your guy sold me $200 shoes. I got blisters already. And you're still wearing a rental. I like the paisley. Thanks. It's slimming. Poor rube. This is the first day of the end of your life. And you may have heard during our pregame introduction,</i> that the Fredrickson clan is well represented here...</i> Double scotch. Make it two. It's coming up. Why not ? The night is young. I got a lot to forget. What are you drinking about ? Oh, family, daughter. Yeah. Huh. She's running with a bad guy, and I feel I have got to do something. Mine's getting married today. And you're here instead. My ex-wife banned me. So, fine. Who needs it ? The guy a problem ? No. I like this one, actually. There was another one ? Yeah. Long story. Short version is he ran out on the wedding. Night before. That's nuclear. Yup. You get killed on the tab ? That was the easy part. Thing blew up our family. My daughter was crushed, wife turned shrew. You may be a better man than me, but I'd hunt him down. Truth ? I was relieved the guy walked. And why's that ? I have another daughter. Troublemaker. I mean, that night, I was in an impossible situation. So that poetic puppy dog toast ? Anna brought me home and tamed me ? Yeah. Bunch of twaddle. Sorry you think so. Dan, I'm 30 years old. I've been with many grooms. And ? Your heart's not in it. You don't want to get married. No, I do. It's a new chapter. That's snoozy. - Yeah. You don't know me. - I know your type. You like freedom, options. Scrabble at home with a brainy wife ? No, thanks. I've changed. Again, twaddle. You cannot have everything you want. You're dealt a hand, - and you make it work. - Dreamy. I hope my husband talks about me that way. Anyway, I should get back... You are who you are, Dan. Why don't you just face it ? Come upstairs. "Crazy girl" by Kelly Pardekooper. One daughter going after another's groom ? With abandon. That ends badly. Worse than you know. The maid of honor hits on the groom. And dad saw it all. So if I'm Anna, get wind of that... Then Romeo pulls the rug out. And I got double motive to smoke him. But twisted sister's the one up in the room with him. We shouldn't do this. We should just be like normal people, Enjoy the night. Leave it alone. Or we could fan out and talk to both the gals. - There's the receiving line. - I'll find the tramp. - So, what am I doing ? - It's a wedding. - Go meet someone. - I know enough people. Get some free booze. What's your beef ? Maybe the guys in the kitchen have the game on. - Valens. - Louie. Rush. Hope you're okay with this. Oh, I'm coping, Louie. This is my bride, Anna. Been dying to meet you. Are you colleagues ? Best cops I know, these two. And Louie's our favorite tech. I'm very lucky I found him. We met a year ago today. Whirlwind romance. I'd love to hear all about it. Anna, the line needs to move along. Maybe we can talk later. Hey, is the boss coming ? He never rsvp'd, but we saved a spot for him. - Yeah, he'll be here. Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. - Officer. - It's detective, actually. Homicide. Ah, shrimp. Primo. Lethal drinks, too. So, you gonna take a run at one of those guys ? Considering it. Well, you have to. It's a wedding. We think alike. And who are you here with ? Solo. So you're scoping, too. Well, trying to keep a lid on it. Well, the last wedding I was at, I ended up dirty dancing with the lady chaplain. I got that beat. Oh, do tell. It was Anna's first wedding, Which we're not supposed to talk about. Well, we can always whisper. I took the groom for a test drive. The guy who ditched her ? That was over you ? I can't help it if I'm Helen of Troy. Here's to little sisters trying to beat you to the punch. She's a good person. Better than you or me. God, I'm messing this up. What is my problem ? You're a jerk. Live with it. I'm not. I just... Just what ? - I can't talk about it. - Then shut up. "Before he cheats" by Carrie Underwood.</i> - Oh, man. - Ignore it. Danny, it's Phil. Oh, it's my best man. Hey. You made it, man. Yeah. Train was late. What is this ? You drinking ? Uh, just one or... Six. Dan, you're not going off the rails. It's not gonna work, Phil. Get downstairs and be with your bride. I don't know. Hey. This is a good thing for both of us. I don't think I can do it. Look, forget Baltimore. Okay ? Just walk this off, get back down to that dinner. This didn't happen. Hey, did you meet her ? Anna ? Um... Not what I expected. Maid of dishonor. Oh, well. No scruples, huh ? Your own blood. Cheers. She's the little sister. Getting married before me ? Inappropriate. Gotcha. So what the heck was in Baltimore ? I don't know. It's their hometown. So, how was Dan getting married good for both of them ? They were always talking about some fancy gym they wanted to buy. And Dan was about to marry rich. Yup. We're loaded. More booze ? Giddyup. Phil and Dan had a company named Hampden, inc. Baltimore ? Bunch of business ventures. All failed. They filed for bankruptcy twice. So, empty pockets. - I got to go. He's here. - Hey, boss, tough news. What ? You got to suit up and get to this thing.</i> What ?! Check your inbox once in a while. Oh, crap. So, somebody's charging flights to India on my business card ? Yeah, we're circling the guy. Just sign this and verify you weren't heading to bombay. Okay, no problem. This ever happen with Hampden, inc.? Uh, no. No. That company never got its wheels up. 'Cause you lost your partner. Dan. Yeah. How'd you feel about him jilting that girl ? So, this isn't about credit cards. March, 2008. You and Dan put a bid -  on Woodland Health and Spa. - True. You guys didn't have that kind of dough, but Anna did. Look, I wanted him to get married. Oh, sure. - No wedding, no gym. - No. No, not for the money. I liked Anna. - I liked her for him. - And why's that ? Because he was wasting his life. You know, too much drinking and cheap women. - Then Anna came along. - Yeah. She's a straight arrow. He started living right. But the night before Dan's wedding, he's holed up with Tenley. Yeah. Talk about cheap. Did Anna hear about that ? Dan and her sister in that suite ? I don't know. I hope not. What table ? Uh... 14. Eh... 11. Not for long. So, where's Kat ? She... said she wasn't coming if I was. I won't ask. Good move. So, what are you up to ? Trying to get the bride alone. Why ? I've got some questions for her. You're working at the wedding. Well... Yeah. I mean, you know, kind of. - Hopeless. - Well, she might have killed her first fiance. Am I supposed to just overlook that ? Well, maybe, for three hours. Take it up in the morning. Well, I have a soft spot for Louie. Okay. I know what we do. Can I get a club soda for the lady and a glass of pinot, please ? Thank you. Well, what's our plan ? Well, I am your drunk boyfriend. Cheers. Hey, lay off, already ! Good going, Curtis. - What ? - You're an idiot. Come with me. I'm sorry. Give him any chance to booze and he blows it. Is it coming out ? Absolutely. Not that it excuses his sloppy ass. - There. - I know the type. Probably out there hitting on a bridesmaid right now. You been with him long ? Too long. He's fun, cute, but... he's always disappointing me. Cowboy, huh ? Yeah, I don't know if they turn into good husbands. I don't think so. Well, my friends say throw him back. I agree. Speaking from experience. - You had one of these tools in your life ? - Yeah. I wasted a lot of time on him. It end badly ? You could say. And you know what ? The right guy was here all along. Anna ! Louie ? - What are you... - It's important. "You'll think of me" by Keith Urban.</i> Okay, I know you only know me from fire safety day. Right. But we've had talks and laughs. And the field trip with your students. And-and-and getting pizza after. That was fun. And-and sharing that ridiculously giant orange crush, 'cause we both love it so much! The forgotten soda. That kind of good time doesn't come along every day. Louie, this is my rehearsal dinner. That's why I'm here. I gotta take my shot. At what ? Marry me. Are you joking ? Most people, they think I'm an oddball, you know that ? I don't know anything about you. But you're interested in my work and my dogs, and chess strategies... I have to go back inside. Hey, we have a rapport. A wavelength ! I know once in a lifetime when I find it. And I'm here to grab my chance. Go home, Louie. So... You didn't meet just last year. We tell people that, 'cause it's easier than the real story. That I married my stalker. It's our little joke. Funny. So, Louie crashed the place ? He have a boom box playing Peter Gabriel ? Tried to steal Anna away. She gave him the high hat- go figure. Lloyd Dobler, incoming. Hey, hey, you guys mind ? Come on, here... Thank you. I didn't know I put you two together. Have a seat, Louie. So, tell us when you really met Anna. Whatcha mean ? We're not buying the whirlwind story. Methodical guy like you. Figure there must be a story behind the story. Are you guys working a case ? At my wedding ? Dan Palmer. Oh, geez. Well, Louie, you went to the hotel that night... - Where he got killed. - Ambushed Anna. I was being romantic. You got shut down. Next stop, the groom ? I did see that guy on the hotel steps. Where he died. But he was good and alive when I left. You know she gives out Graham crackers every Friday ? What ? Takes the lab goggles home on the weekends, and washes them for the kids. Twenty pairs. Are you talking about Anna ? I know these things about her. And I don't. I hope you know she's special. I hope you really love her. It sounds like you do. I'd make her happy everyday. Hello, yeah. Melanie ? She asked for me ? "Demons" by Kenny Chesney. I was a fool, but I'm no killer. You guys know me. Well, we also know you lied about this. 'Cause I was a fool ! Plus, how am I getting in that guy's hotel room? - That's a good point. - Bell. Shut up. - So, who was Melanie ? - All I know is an hour later, the wedding was off. God, and you guys are all disinvited to the champagne brunch tomorrow. Hey, Louie. What did you do ? New wrinkle with our dead groom. Mystery woman reached out to him That night. Suddenly, Dan was out of there. We're laying bets on the doer, boss. I got the skank. - Bride. - Mommy dearest. The winner gets a free pass on the wedding gift. I'll go Phil. Thought you bought his story. He's young, rich, good looking. I don't like the guy. Remember these, Joan ? You can't be here. Want me to tell Anna where I found them ? Hey, Ed, let's take a walk. - You're the double scotch. - That's right. Dance ? Excuse me ? My friend will take care of him. Let me take care of you. Now, you've had a few, Ed. - A few drinks, a few sleepless nights. - Du calme. Easy. Few too many years protecting that battle-ax. Can I see those rings ? Who are you, anyway ? I'm a homicide lieutenant; I know about Dan Palmer. She was my wife, so I didn't say anything. These were missing from his body. Turned up in her jewelry box. After Dan died ? I keep her dirty secret, and what does she do ? She cuts me out of Anna's life. Gets her thinking I torpedoed the first wedding, and I don't even get invited to this one. Well, the truth will come out now. Oh, she can fly to hell. I don't care. But Anna... I miss my girl. Exes, huh ? Miserable. He knows what a big night this is for me. So, what were those rings about ? The past. Care to elaborate ? It's nothing I'm proud of, Will. You have to face it to move on, Joan. You're wise, aren't you ? Learned a few things. Do you believe that people are better than their worst actions ? One hundred percent. My daughter... Tell me. Her first fiance... He sure had me fooled. I heard about that. Unforgivable. And I didn't think he should get away with it. Where do you think you're going ? Home. My daughter is in the bridal suite, - a broken woman. - I'm sorry. You're going to be on the society pages tomorrow. - I'm a complete heel. - 200 people are showing up at the church. I know, but I have to go. You may not do this to me. - To you ? - You will be here. 10:00 A.M. I'm gonna be long gone. I'll pay you. You can get divorced in a year. Quietly, amicably. Joan, please, just let me go. We've paid for the rings, the hotel... They're yours. I'm getting into the Milton club this season, because my wedding is going to be the event of the summer. I cannot marry her. Of course you can. I'm already married. Can we get a Brandy ? I never heard that part of the story. Only Anna and I know that. He told Anna ? He went right up to the bridal suite to come clean. And me ? I just sat down and cried. I've been crying ever since. So, Melanie's more than a side girl. She's a side wife. So why can't we find her ? I checked marriage licenses in every state. Nothing. Was he lying ? Get monster-in-law off his back ? Well, either way, this girl was big enough in his life he dropped everything for her. Well, she's our key. But she's a ghost. We've got to get back for the cake. Yeah. Wouldn't want to ruin Louie's night. It's Phil's myspace page from college. "Me, Dan and Mel." She looks just like Anna. Who's the girl, Phil ? - Where'd you get this ? - Who's the girl ? An old friend. An old friend Dan just happened to be married to ? Hey. - Hey. - To good guys, Like Louie. Husband material. Unlike Dan. Did I tell you his name ? Oh, bad enough he leaves you at the altar, but... Let's not talk about him. But then he turns the knife. "by the way, I'm already married." I'd kill him, too. Yeah. He was married. To Melanie. It was a long time ago. They were kids. And he thought that would just get swept under the rug ? I told you, Dan was a screwup. Anna was a new chapter. Let's hear about the old one. I don't think I like you anymore. You don't have to like me. You just have to talk. She was from Baltimore. They eloped. Cancun, spring break. And he just forgot to undo that mess, all those years later ? It wasn't a mess. They were in love. So why not be with her ? Why twist you around ? 'Cause something terrible happened. It was years ago. College. And you've been with her this whole time ? You know I have been with you. Haven't you ever heard of divorce ? I couldn't do that. But you could lie to me. Anna, she's in a hospital. She has been for eight years. Why ? There was an accident. In Mexico. We were on a boat, drinking. And ? She almost drowned. And they saved her, physically, but... she never came back, otherwise. The first three years, I visited her every day. She was there, but she wasn't. And she's still in Baltimore ? God, I tried to move on. Coming to Philly. New place, new chance. And meeting you, I felt good again. Glad I could help out. I wanted to start over with you. That's what I want. But I can't get over it. And tonight, a nurse called. She asked for me. She's never done that in eight years. And that's why your bag is packed. I have to go to her. My parents spent a zillion dollars on this thing. Every loved one I have is here. And you're leaving in the 25th hour, for a girl who's been gone for eight years ? You must be crazy. I'm sorry. Just... get your ass out the door ! Not a graceful good-bye. I could see doing worse. But I didn't. And actually... I understand now. He loved her. He loved her. And he wanted to love Anna, who looked just like her ? - He was trying to get it back. - Right. I knew the second I saw Anna... He was never going to go through with it. So he headed to Baltimore ? With Phil. Best man to the end. More credit card research, Phil. Is that right ? Two amtrak tickets to Baltimore. Purchased in the wee hours, night Dan hit the dirt. Well, sounds like you were gonna hightail it with the runaway groom. Makes you the last to see. I told you, I tried to reason with Dan... You tell us things, Phil, but you don't. Like you say there was an accident in Cancun, but you don't say that you were there. At the wheel of the boat, as a matter of fact. That's not something you want to relive. Wrecking a girl's life. And your best friend's. In fact, you'd do a lot to never talk about it again. Another half-truth I'm stumbling on, Phil ? You told us about Melanie. Finally. But not that you called her that night. 3:11 a.M... You call the hospital. Four minutes later, Dan is dead. But you had a key to the hotel room. You were with him. Calling his old girl. Why ? I been asking myself that same question ever since. You don't want to do this. I don't ? New chapter. Right ? I don't want to see Melanie after eight years ? Dan, she's gone. She asked for me. We both visited all those years. She never knew you. And-and-and... Now she does. I don't believe that. So, move on, right ? Even though she's all I ever wanted ? But you can't have her. And whose fault is that ? You know I'm sorry. But we can't bring her back. She is back. She said my name. You heard the doc, this is not possible... A nurse called me ! Dan ! Face it ! There is nothing for you in Baltimore. I guess I'm going alone, then. Okay, you know what ? Let's call her. What are you doing ? No, let's see if she suddenly remembers you, Dan. Let's see if Melanie miraculously returned from her eight-year wasteland. Hello. Yeah, it's-it's Dan Palmer. We-we talked earlier. How is she ? Yeah. Thanks. You... You're right. We're not going to Baltimore. Look, I'll... I'll order us some coffee. We'll-we'll talk. We'll... get things back on track. Dan, what are you doing ? She died. What ? They say it happens sometimes, Right before death. Clarity. Dan... Clarity. Wait. Dan. Dan ! No !
