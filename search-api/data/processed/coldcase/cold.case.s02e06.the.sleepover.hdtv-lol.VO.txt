ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - NSC ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ (http://club.nate.com/tsm) What are everyone's plans for the weekend? Ariel? Um, I'm going to the mall with Brandi and Tiffany, and then they're having dinner at my house. We're going shopping for an outfit for the dance. They're gonna be like the same, but we each get a different color. Mine's gonna be strapless. Great. Rita, what are you doing this weekend? Me and my mum are probably getting an iguana. But they're like really big when they're fully matured, so we'll maybe build their own habitat. That's terrific, Rita. Caitlin Gater, white female, 19. Park ranger found her a few hours ago. In the water? Yeah, took us a spell to get her up. People notice this ain't the best place to swim in laps? Name like Devil's Pool kinda says it all. Chestnut Hill kids come here and dive. Local tradition. The trick is you gotta jump far into the left to miss the rocks. That's how rich kids get a thrill, huh? Well, our girl went straight down to the rocks, never got back up. Drowned? With a little help. Bruises go around the back. He held her head in the water? That's not the only reason I dragged you out in the cold though. It's all right, our pleasure. What's with the marks? Magic marker, it looks like. In 1990, a little girl was found under water here. Broken neck, same marks all over her body. And 14 years later to the day this girl's killed. Big deal case, we worked it to death, but nothing stuck and it went cold. Think this is a copy cat? Detail about the marks were never released to the press. So, we're looking at the same doer. Good chance. Guy lays low 14 years. Why come back now? He got something to say.

No, Scotty. You sit. They did their due diligence first time around, eh? They had any ideas on these marks? First detectives wondered whether they're ritualistic but they couldn't find any pattern to them. It didn't match anything FBI had on file. Seventh grader at Chestnut Collegiate. Pricey prep school. Yeah, but Rita was a scholarship kid. Well, she and her mum and the other half was in Chestnut Hill. Mother's an art teacher at community college, tucks her daughter in at 10 pm. Next morning, she's two miles from her house. Blunt force trauma from hitting the rocks. Could've snuck out out to meet someone. Or someone snatched her, brought her there. We got any leads on who killed this new victim? We do now. Gil Sherman's bringing in a guy, caught speeding toward New Jersey with a car full of Caitlin Gater's clothes. He gave himself up when we flashed the lights. He confessed? For an hour straight. Guy's parents are here. I hear they want to see him. That's them. Detective Rush and Valens. Jason Beaudry. My wife Holly. This is a mistake. Neil is a schizophrenic and he's very confused right now. We know this is a bad time but I need to ask. Did you or your son know a girl named Rita Baxter? She was the girl who died at Devil's Pool years ago. No, we didn't know her. Are you trying to pin something else on him now? She went to school in your neck of the woods. We remember the story. It was tragic, but that's the only time I'd ever heard her name. This is wrong. You're taking advantage of a sick person. What's he on? Clozaril. If you bring it in, we can get that to him. He might be here a while. Neil, it's Detective Rush. She's got some questions for you. He ain't in a good way. He's seeing things. Neil, why did you go to Devil's Pool yesterday? Um, I, uh, I go every year on 16th of November. Why that day? - You know a girl named Rita Baxter? - Everything's the same there. It's always dead. So you go there every year? This year, you killed the girl. Why? If I touch things, they'll die. Did you put the marks on this girl's body? It was my first time. You killed this girl just like you killed Rita, Neil? No, no. Rita has the same marks on her body. No, I killed this girl, but not Rita. Sit down. He's got a pace. They do that. Why did you go to the Devil's Pool every year the same day Rita died? You're going away anyway, Neil. - You got nothing to lose. - No, I'm sorry. If we give him his meds, it'll be easier. Rita had a thing for cats, huh? Muse of choice and she was prolific. I could paper the walls in felines and costumes. I said, you're 12, what about boys? So../ We came across someone. Neil Beaudry. Big shot Chestnut Hill family, father's an importer. Oh, I know that name. Brandi Beaudry. She was in Rita's year, Chestnut Collegiate. That's Neil's kid sister. - What'd the boy do? - He's a murder suspect. A girl died at Devil's Pool, have the same marks on her. Rita went to school with his sister since she was 5. I'm sure he knows who she was. Parents said he didn't. All those people weren't around enough to have any idea who your kids knew. And while they are busy jetting off spending their bags of money, their daughter was tormenting Rita. She goes off to the water and with her mind, she calls the dolphins. They swim and they have a friendship even without like words. That sounds great. It's by the same writer as a wrinkle in time. Um, I don't know feel so well. All of a sudden? - What's wrong? - Please, mom. Could we go home? Hey, there's Ariel. - Mom, we're not friends anymore. - Why not? She's friends with Brandi now. - Brandi doesn't like me. - Well, then Brandi's an idiot. Brandi's mean. She always says, what are you looking at? At one time, she took my jacket and said it was from the Sears and gave it to the janitor, but I took it back. Rita, listen to me. Everyone who's ever been anything in the history of time has been a loser in junior high. In 6 years from now, you're gonna be in college and you are gonna be the coolest girl around. Because you're smart and you're different and you're wacky. And that's what's important in this world. Not what those idiot girls think of you. Girls that age, it's... It's like the Serengeti. Kill or be killed. I fought with my sister everytime I tried to change the channel from the Hardy Boys, she'd shriek like a banshee. Why Rita? Why'd he pick her? It's not for sure yet. That family, they just couldn't let Rita be. How you feeling? The medication makes me, um, under water. But a little clearer, right? Okay. Rita Baxter. Your sister had a thing for picking on her. You remember? Yeah. Do you ever see her? Sometimes. When you do, see these markings? On her skin all over. Black pen. You put those on her? No. But you put a mark on Caitlin. Why? To make her like Rita. And you wanted to hurt her like you hurt Rita? No, I wasn't poisoned back then. - Maybe without meaning it. - No. Okay, Neil. You don't understand. Go ahead. It was my first time. Okay, Neil. You, it's over. So, now you've gone to first base. You can go. We're done with you. Neil, come back and visit later. Not. So how was it specifically? Warm. Now, Rita's getting hot. When was that? The night she died. You're sure? My sister had her over for a sleepover. So, did you do something to Rita later that night? It wasn't me. I killed that other girl, but not Rita. Well, who did? It was the house. It's an evil house. Neil, the wack job can say what he wants. I know he's our guy. Parents were out that night, he was in charge. - That's opportunity. - And motive? He's a wack job. Whether Neil's telling the truth or not, we still got the three girls who never spoke up about being with Rita that night. 14 years, biggest case in Chestnut Hill and they clam up? That's shady. Brandi Beaudry, Ariel Shuman, Tiffany O'Connell. Those were the girls the mother remembers hassling Rita. Kill her over a game of Barbie, hit her with a dream Corvette? We went to the school the first time around. How'd the girls get overlooked? Three most popular girls in school having a sleepover with Rita? Violates a social order. Especially Buffy, Muffy, and the Trixie ain't talking. Sounds like it's time to introduce yourselves to the divas of the Chestnut Collegiate. Those are wrinkles. Do you see what I'm saying? I said creases. Brandi Beaudry? Yeah, I'm Brandi. Detective Valens and Rush. Homicide. If this is about my brother, I'd be by his side right now if I didn't have this party to plan. So, no. I'm not gonna help you put him away. We ain't here about Caitlin Gater. What then? Why didn't you ever tell anyone Rita Baxter was at your house the night she died? I don't know what you're talking about. Brandi, a girl was murdered. 14 years go by and you never say anything? You realize how that makes you look. She came by, okay? But she left in the middle of the night. I don't know anything about how she died. So, why keep the sleepover a secret? We were afraid. We thought we'd be blamed just because we'd been with her. I'm sorry. Seriously. But we were 12. So, what's your excuse now? Seriously. - Girls club code of silence? - Not at all. I haven't talked to Ariel orTiffany in like a million years. Is that an exact figure? High school, maybe. Let's start with this, Brandi. How's a girl like Rita wind up at a sleepover at your house? We invited her because we thought it would be funny to mess with her. We're brats. Who came up with this great plan? It was Ariel's idea. Hi, Rita. You could say hi back. Hi. Brandi thinks you're cool and she wants to hang out with you. I have to go home. Rita, this is a chance of a lifetime. It is way better being with them than being a nerd and gifted. Hey, Rita. Cute snickers. So, my parents are in the Bahamas and we're having a sleepover tonight. I want you to come but you can't tell your mom because well, I don't really have permission. Ariel, is this a trick? No, she for real wants you there. I do, too. I could sneak out after my mom goes to bed. She came over at like 10 and like two hours later, we hid her glasses from her. She freaked out and left. Who knows what happened after that. I mean, she died, obviously. But you don't know anything about that? If I did, I would tell you. I'm glad you know. I was wrong not to speak up. It was your idea though. To invite Rita to party and razz her. At the time, I thought I was giving her the keys to the kingdom, getting her to Brandi Beaudry's house. How's that? She was the most popular girl in school. Rita and I, not so popular. But when Rita got to the sleepover, you laid in to her like you planned. Not like I planned. I mean, I had no idea. I was JV. Those two are varsity bitches. Boys don't think you're anthing if you're fat. Here. See? Gross. Yeah. Look at her butt. Ariel, it's your turn to pick a spot on Rita. Right here. Back fat. You have a fat back like your mom. She's really ugly, no offense. I don't wanna do this anymore. Tiffany, way to go. Now she's pissed. So? Did you know there's a rumor that  your mom's a slut? Everybody's saying it. Explains the marks. Sick, right? So what happened after the fat fest? Rita ran out, didn't come back. Anyone go after her? - None of us. - How about Neil? I didn't see that. I guess it's possible. I thought Brandi was the ringleader. Why was Tiffany so nasty? Tiffany's dad and Rita's mom had a thing going. And Tiffany knew about it? But Rita didn't and Tiffany didn't let on. Maybe she was just waiting for the right moment. Why would she sneak out? And to be with those awful girls. Popularity stuff? I did have an affair with him. We thought we were discrete. I didn't think that Tiffany knew. Think Tiffany was capable of violence? I never really got to know her. After Rita, well, married men lose interest in a woman who can't get out of bed in the morning. You hear what Tiffany's doing these days? I only know she was kicked out of Collegiate in 8th grade. Drinking problem. She was the apple of her dad's eye before then. Drinking, that young? Sounds like something threw Trixie for a loop. Detective Valens, Philadelphia PD. Crap. Well, we know you had it in for Rita. Her mom having that affair with your dad. You ride her hard enough, she leaves the sleepover. Then what? Then nothing. Follow her into the woods. Get rid of her at Devil's Pool. You're way off, sorry. Now, here's a rich girl from Chestnut Hill wind up on house arrest on Mount Airy after multiple DUI's? How? Tequila. Something went wrong, Tiffany. - Real wrong. - That's your opinion. To me, I'm glad I got out of Chestnut Hill. / Yeah? Do me one favor. Is that bitch Brandi still a bitch? I knew it. What a bitch. I hated Rita and her slut mom about as much as I hated my jackass dad. But I didn't have it in me to kill her. No? Not like they did. Why does Sporto like the ugly girl? Claire's much prettier. It would suck to have red hair. Rita thinks the nerd is cute. No, I don't. Give me your glasses. Why? / Cuz I wanna see them. Eww, you're blind. You have weird eyes in real life, no offense. Can I have them back, please. No. My parents. Hide. Hide! Hi, there. What's your name, hun? Rita Baxter. Where's your brother? - Asleep. - Will you get him up? Why? Holly. Will you run the bath upstairs? Sure. How many people did my daughter have over tonight, Rita? Wall. How many girls were here? Um.. just one. Just me. So you're a liar too, Rita. Brandi, you wanna tell your friend what we do to liars in this house? The Beaudry's said that they were out of town that night. And you believed them, cuz they didn't look the type. What type's that? The lying and beating their kids type. Think they woulda hurt Rita? I got out of there after that. But you know things are bad when the biggest bitch in school looks like she's gonna piss in her Calvin's. Someone's been telling you lies. Yeah, you. Rita was at your house the night she died. Didn't you think that was worth mentioning to the cops? It's my daughter, isn't it? You talked to her. Well, keep in mind. She's a drug addict and a liar. Brandi wasn't supposed to have friends over unsupervised. So who got in trouble, Brandi or the friend? I'm sorry if we scared the Baxter girl. But we didn't touch her. Our children needed special attention. Sometimes, yes. We were physical with them. And other times, you were on vacation. We were afraid of her. When they're really little, you can't tell the difference. Biting, kicking. And she's older? And it's nothing normal kids stuff. What's that? We had a cat. The nanny came in and found her wrapping it up in a towel. Brandi said it drowned but what's the cat doing in a full bath tub. Right. She was capable of things no parent wants to think about. Like killing Rita? I have a meeting in 40 minutes and this takes 20. A wash-and-go is gonna have to do it today. I can't have my whole life thrown over this. Your parents think you killed Rita. My parents are freaks. - You gotta stop lying, Brandi. - What? Your mom and dad came home that night, discovered the sleepover. You said they were in the Bahamas. They were always somewhere. Maybe I got confused. We know they were violent with you and Neil when you were kids. But they said they had to be because you were disturbed, hurt things. If they're talking about that stupid cat.. Hurting animals means something, Brandi. I was an angry kid. Guess why? Tell me about them coming home that night. They didn't like when I had friends over. Mom. I told them all to go home. It's too late, Brandi. You lied. Dad, it's not her fault. I was in charge. Dad, no. No, no. Neil, honey, please. This is important. Dad! Dad! Hold. Done. She was supposed to go home. I don't know why she came back. And then my mom saw her. Neil and I were sent to our rooms. And in the morning, she was dead. Thank you. I know that was hard. No, I said it a million times in my head. Parents were right about the drugs. Brandi was picked up for forging up prescription back in July. Charges were dropped. Dilaudid. Synthetic morphine. That's heavy self medicating. And she's the healthy kid. Not the way her parents tell it. Brandi thinks her parents killed Rita to keep the abuse secret. And they're saying she's the violent one. Happy home. Maybe I'll go talk to Neil. They moved him to Western Psychiatric. You'll go see Elisa while you're there? Nah, it's not the right time. I know what your parents made you to do to your sister. The dunkin'. Yeah. That's what you did to Caitlin, right? You held her down. I didn't want to hurt her. Then what happened? / I uh... I go every year cuz I miss Rita. And this time I thought I saw her. But it was Caitlin Gater. I thought she was Rita. I don't know why. And you put those marks on this girl like Rita's to kinda recreate her? But this girl didn't care about me. She was afraid and screamed. I guess I needed her to be quiet and we were at the water, so I held her down for too long. Well, Rita was pushed not held down. I didn't do that to Rita. She was kind. I wouldn't hurt her. What about your parents that night? They never left their room after we were punished. And Brandi? She was violent, right? It was not her fault. What happened after Rita saw you in the bathroom? She tried to save us. I saw what your parents were doing. It's wrong. You should tell another adult. We could go right now and tell my mom. She could help us. It's not right. You're not bad. - We could go. - What are you talking about? Get out of my room. You don't have to be embarrassed. It happens to other kids too. Brandi. Nothing is happening. Get out of my room, loser. Get out. I can help you. We can go to my mom. I don't need your help. You're a loser. You are dead. Close the door. Why are you guys still here? We can't go home. It's two in the morning. Your parents didn't see us. We snuck up. Are you guys in a fight? I hate her and I want her to die. She needs to die. Right? Right. Right. What then, Neil? They kicked me out and I left her in there with all of them. We know one of you killed Rita. The two of you who didn't should save yourselves. You got something to tell. I'm getting a cup of coffee and I'll be back. It's better than a reunion, right. Yeah, I bet they're wishing we had an open bar. You've sure changed. Are they serious? This doesn't even seem real. Well, it's not me, clearly. Oh, clearly? - One of you said something. - There's nothing to tell. Ariel's pretty insistent. It was you, wasn't it? You'd love to see me go down. I think they can hear us. Middle school's over. I'm not hung up about you anymore. Tiffany's got something. - Are you threatening her? - It's okay. I mean, look at her. She's just sad. Guess what, bitch. Time to buy a diary. Cuz I'm not keeping your secrets anymore. Shut up. - Don't tell me what to do. - Tiffany, sit down. Ah, they're good and ready now. I'll pull Tiffany. Those two your best pals, huh? Brandi and Ariel. Friggin' time warp in there. Haven't changed much? Shows you what crap taste you have in friends when you're 12. You're different though. Ain't buying in to the games. I'm the only sane one of the three, not perfect though. Whatever you did, bet it wasn't as bad as them. They get their perfect lives. Me, I'm innocent and I get wrecked. That's cause I'm the one who saw her face. Well? We could poison her. Or hang her. I learned knots at sailing. I think I better go home. Guard the door. She'll get out. This is lame. When can we do ouija board? After we kill her. Blood sisters. Right. Eww. You have to. It's a pact. Ok, you're crazy. This is seriously the worst sleepover I've ever been to in my entire life. You can't leave. - Brandi wants to make a pact. - Ariel, get over it. Rita, come on. / No. She's ours. Whatever. I wasn't gonna go home. But? I went downstairs and I met the love of my young life on adult's liquor cabinet. I drank whatever was open. And right before I passed out, I thought, I gotta start hanging out with boys instead. This is killing me. Brandi's jonesing. Time for her afternoon dose. Why's she looking for it in Ariel's purse? You need a doctor to get Dilaudid. Ariel's a doctor. Yeah. She could lose her license for prescribing to addicts. Why is she doing it? Old time's sake. Think Brandi may have a specific old time in mind. You look like you could use some fresh air. Yeah. Junkies generally don't like these windowless rooms. What do you want? - Ariel's your supplier, isn't she? - What? Well, that connection dries up right here and now. You tell me what you got on her, you can go home and gobble up the rest of what she gave you. That's crazy. What are you Brandi, loyal? You're a survivor. You take what you need from people then lose them when they're not useful anymore. And I'm telling you, Ariel's tabbed out. What do you wanna know? What happened to Rita after Tiffany left her with you two? I got bored, said good night. Tiffany can't say anything. She'll be in a bigger trouble as us. I don't care. It's over. / What? I think you should go home with that loser. Me? No, why? I wanna stay. Because we're not friends anymore. No offense but I thought you were cool. You're not. You two are better off as friends. I don't wanna be her friend. I wanna be your friend. You're the one who brought her here and she ruined the sleepover. I want you two losers to leave my house. / But.. Get out. Don't sit with us at lunch anymore. A minute later when I looked out the window, they were cutting through the back yard heading to the woods. I could hear Ariel crying from all the way up from my room. It's just a lunch table. Talk about crazy. What are you looking at? Nothing. What'd you think would happen when you got caught? Sorry? You tell the hospital's a mistake? You had no idea Brandi Beaudry was an addict. She just told you she was in pain. She is in pain. Her life... You can't imagine. How long she been making you do things for her? It's just a favor that got mixed up. It was blackmail, Ariel. Always has been. Because she knows what you did. No. Do you hate me? It doesn't matter what I think of you. She was just a little kid. But I was just a little kid too. - I didn't know. - You didn't know what? I didn't know you'd live through it. My life is over. We'll be home soon. I don't want to go home. So what if she thinks we're losers? We'll be losers through Junior High. I don't care. My mom says everybody who's ever been anything in the world was a loser. I care. Just because you don't why do I have to suffer? In 6 years, we'll be in college and my mom said we'll be cool. I can't wait for college. 6 years? My god. Brandi's gonna hate me for 6 years. So what if those idiot girls don't like you? That's not what matters in this world. It's better to be smart and different like us. No. I don't want to be like us. But Ariel, in college we'll be considered cool. And... maybe before that we could be best friends to each other, if you want. No. ¹ø¿ª¼öÁ¤ ¼Õ¼ººÀ(shon9795@nate.com) ¸ÂÃã¹ý±³Á¤
