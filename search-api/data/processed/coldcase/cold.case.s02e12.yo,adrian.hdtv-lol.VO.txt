Look, you're killing him! Don't you see? Doctor! We need a doctor! I arrived for morning visits when Sonny had taken the turn for the worst. Sonny Carroll? Yes. / He has information on prize fighter who was killed? That's right. Sonny hasn't made a last confession. He wanted to talk to you first. Sonny? / Hmm? The police are here. This is detective Rush and lieutenant Stillman. Hi, Sonny. 'Course you'd have to be a pretty young gal. Serves me right. Sonny, you officiated in a boxing match back in 1976? And that kid died in the ring. Who died? Jerry Stone. What a gutless wonder. Jerry was gutless? No, me. I should have stopped the fight. Stopped it because Jerry was hurt? Real bad. Why didn't you? My hand was in the pot. Someone paid you off, Sonny? Fifteen hundred dollars. That was the deal. To not stop a fight that should have been stopped? Sonny? Do you really think he'll forgive? So, someone wants to do Jerry harm. And pays Sonny $1,500 to let the fight go on longer than it should. But, Sonny didn't say who. And he's not going to.

How's it going? What's up? On my way in. Thought I'd stop by. I called, but- Nah. I must have been in the shower. Hit your cell phone a couple of three times, too. Yeah, my cell...I think I left it at work. Mind if I come in? Yeah, okay. If you want. Have a seat. What's up with your furniture? What do you mean? Your setup is horrible. Couldn't be more... - awkward. - I was about to skip some rope. Gotcha. So, how long have you been doing this? Since, uh... pee wees? Wrestling. No, I mean... Pushing back the furniture. Ah, So, I don't like the gym. What? Too much room? Nah, too many people. Listen, Scotty, I, uh- Just wanted to say when my wife died... Well, I've been where you've been. Yeah, I know. So, if you ever want to talk... Guess you'll let me know. Jerry Stone. Twenty four. Died in the ring after going 15 rounds with Maurice "Mad Mo" Bell. Autopsy showed massive swelling on the brain as cause of death. So no question the punches he took killed him. Top Dog Boxing Club. December 19, 1976. Rocky versus Apollo, the real thing. Hmm, what's that about? The idea of the fight was to try and recreate 'Rocky', - the hot movie at the time. - Sort of gimmicky, huh? Ha, supposedly it lived up to the hype. 'Till someone got killed. Nick, the other fighter "Mo". Was he questioned first time around? The assigned put him through his paces but... boxer dies in the ring, what are you gonna do? But knowing the referee was on the take, that changes everything. So we figure out who paid Sonny. Maybe Gina will know. - Who's that? - Sonny's daughter. And Jerry's girlfriend. Says here, she was ringside when Jerry died. So Gina looks on as her own dad allows her boyfriend to get beat to death. Maybe it explains why she wasn't ringside today. She wasn't at the hospital? Start with her. Jerry was short on talent. Big on heart. He said that's why they picked him for the fight. Because they knew he'd never quit. No matter how badly he was hurt. No, he'd stay in and take the punishment. Like Rocky did. Now, you add a referee who's willling to let that happen. Gina, any idea on who could have paid your dad that money? No. Well, how about someone who had a problem with Jerry? Besides Sonny you mean? / Yeah. Nah. So, Sonny didn't care for Jerry? At fifteen, he made it very clear that I wasn't to see him. He said he was a bum. How so? He droped out of school, didn't work. But he could always hustle up money to drink. So, how did you two got together? Just another Friday night going nowhere, and... Then I saw something my father couldn't. ¢Ü Orleans  "Dance With Me" ¢Ü Drinking those eggs were so gross. What about his apartment? Yeah! That too. Isn't that Jerry Stone? Shh. Hi, Jerry. Hey. Oh my gosh, what happened to your face? My face? - Gina here can't stop looking at it. - Okay! Hey, I'll see you in a minute. So, did you like the movie? Uh, the love story part. You sorta look like Adrian. I do? Me, I've seen the flick three times. Yeah, Fifteen bucks for a locker and a corner man... Five dollar charge for shower and towel. Hmm, very true to life. So, uh... my looks are comin' on, huh? I said you looked, different. That's all. / Yeah? 'Cause I feel different. Oh? This movie's got me thinking, If some bum wants to be president in the United States, he really can be. President, huh? / Ha, ha. Well, I guess I'd better work one of the few fights first. My record's not so hot. I gotta go do my roadwork. Jerry. Ah...Are you looking for your own Adrian? Are you for real? Uh-huh. So, that was the beginning of me and Jerry. And the end of you and Sonny. Yeah...I told him that Jerry had changed. I said there was no stopping him now. But Sonny didn't believe it? Gina, just so you know... Your dad was genuinely sorry about Jerry. Yeah. Too bad he didn't feel that way before he let Mad Mo kill him. Detective Will Jefferys, Mo. And my partner detective Vera. Where you all park car, man? Up on the corner, we're good. Yo, Booger. Some good looking out for Philly's finest. You snug as a bug now, baby. Let's talk about Jerry Stone. Come on. At the weigh-in you said you were gonna murder Jerry. For real, and you did. Hey, hey, hey. Just talking bads, man. Selling up tickets. What about the press conference when you were talking about some black and white stuffs? Ah, just pointing out the differences. Our people was into James Brown. Jerry Stone and you all might have rather been square dancing, not any racist. It is a little bit. Still, it don't mean I murdered him. Mo, we looked into your juvenile records. Arrested nine times before you were fifteen. Two years in the lockup for putting step-pops in coma? Those records were supposed to be sealed. Don't worry. We taped 'em back up. I did't even know who Jerry Stone was. I- I didn't want to take that fight in the first place. Why not? Cat was what? 15-18-3.. something terrible like that? What's beating a chump like that gonna do for me? So why did you fight him? Tommy Sugar. The promoter of the fight. Man could sell you a house in the Atlantic Ocean. ¢Ü Parliament "Give Up The Funk" ¢Ü That's him in the maroon trunks. Don't nobody care about these cats. What? No, no- what, wait a minute! Look, how many fights you've won in a row? All of'em. And 21 out of 22 was knockouts. And what one of 'em was against a top five contenders. Hey, ain't no top five giving me a fight. man. You wanna know why? Why? / Publicity! You are a wrecking machine but nobody knows you. But if I get down with this fight? They will. And fighting this fool's gonna raise my status? C'mon. Let me introduce you to one of the great bleeders of all time. Jerry Stone. I've opended up faces many a time. But if he bleeds like this tonight imagine what you'll do to him. It's like you said. Nobody cares about this cat. I know I don't. But everybody, is gonna care about you. Yeah. C'mon, Mo. Huh? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! So you agreed to the fight and took Jerry apart. The ref should've stopped. I could tell why the boy's brain got wet I'm killing him, and he's hollering. He took the ring back! This kinda nonsense. The thing is, Mo. Your career didn't rise. It went downhill after that fight. Killing somebody has a way of throwing a man off-track. Not for Tommy Sugar. He's been Phily's top boxing promoter the last 25 years. Well that's some truth, and here's some more: The night Jerry Stone died, Tommy Sugar was born. It was 1976. The bicentennial. And 'Rocky' was as American as it gets. And you saw a way to exploit that. Saw opportunity. For one and all. That kind of timing don't come twice. So the pressure was on. - This fight had to live up. - No doubt. One thing for an underdog to go 15 rounds on the silver screen, another to make that happen in real life. I tribute to the young man who fought. And you did nothing to help it along? Like what? Jerry would bleed a lot. Which was a good thing, right? But if you were trying to remake 'Rocky', you need Jerry to go 15 rounds. So you don't want too much of a good thing. So maybe as insurance you paid the referee to keep it going. No matter what. Well, Sonny took a deal like that? Yep. Ha, ha, ha- I wish I'd known he was open for business. You know, where you ought to be looking is the C.Y.O. Catholic Youth Organization. Where I plucked Jerry from. A half a dozen fighters came to me crying the blues after being overlooked. So one of these sore losers from the C.Y.O. pays Sonny 1,500 dollars to see Jerry take the beating of his life? Your best fighters, always hold a grudge. The C.Y.O. was at it's height in the 70's. Instead of a kid sucking on cigarettes all day long he had a place to go. And Jerry Stone participated in the boxing program? Jerry would serve mass for me on Sunday mornings and then fight for me on Sunday nights. Which eventually lands him this bout with Mo. Right. Heard not everyone was overjoyed by that. You gotta be remembered that these kids had their noses pressed right up against it. And along comes Jerry, He's got a chance at a real professional fight. Anyone so jealous they might wanna see real harm come to Jerry? Pay the ref off to see that happen? Ah, deep down, these guys knew they were not better than Jerry. Just a bunch of ham and eggers. - Except, uh- one of 'em, I guess. - Who? Bucky Lowsen Best fighter we had. Better than Jerry? They wanted more of an underdog. He had too good a record. And how'd he deal with that? Bucky didn't like coming in second to Jerry that seem to be happening quite a lot. ¢Ü Marshall Tucker Band "Can't You See" ¢Ü Hey. Can I borrow the key to the gym, father? I want to work the bags a little. Mr. Carroll. Must think Rome was built in a day. Hey, go play some records. I'll be right over. You just won't give him a chance, will you? Why should I? A bum is a bum is a bum. Hey. Hey, I've looking for you. Buck. / Don't 'Buck' me boy! You get the message I left you? Look, Buck. This is Mr. Sugar's fight. - You should talk to him. - I did. My only way in that ring is if you were out. I'm sorry. I'm staying put. - Hey, sucker, we ain't through here. - Buck, Buck, back off. You want to start a donnybrook, start with me. Fine. Hey, Sonny. You seen Jimmy the jeweler lately? What are you talking about? Jerry purchased a fancy engagement ring. Seems to think he's marrying Gina. Bucky, give it a rest. Maybe you fighting Mo ain't such a bad thing. After he puts you in a coma, guess whose brawny shoulder's gonna be there for Gina to cry on. So, Buck and Gina had history. Sweethearts. / In high school? Elementary. He'd been carrying a torch for her since the fifth grade. How do you know that? Well, around here if you don't get the story on some kid after the mass? You believe your butt you would at the bar. So between losing both the fight and the girl to Jerry. Hmm, Buck was having a rough go. Alright Scotty, I'll see you then. Valens? Yeah. / He alright? We'er gonna grab some drinks. Good. Doing better than yesterday. You talked to him? Yeah. Buck Lowson's got a record. Two days before the fight, Buck robbed a convenient store. This says he was arrested in '78. Not '76. It took that long to catch him. How much did Buck get away with? Two thousand and a thing of peanut butter. And two whole years to spread it around. Yeah. But maybe only took two days before he burned all 1,500 of it. Right. Fifteen hundred. Sonny's asking price. I don't know what you're talking about! Buck, I might even believe you if not for the timing, I mean. You never stole anything else in your life. That's the god's honest truth. - Nothing before that day or after. - But that day is the problem, Buck. Because it was two days before the fight. - How do you explain that? - I can't. Start with the money. What d'you do with it? Buck, we know you wished Jerry ill. And that you and Gina go way back. Let him call a lawyer. I don' want a lawyer. I can't afford one. Fine. I'll make sure you get a PD. If you're lucky you might even get a good one. You think a public defender's gonna care about me? Alright, maybe not. But, Buck. If you're not gonna talk about the money, what are we supposed to do? Besides, if you're so innocent, what are you hedging for? Because I don't wanna hurt her. ¢Ü Bachman Turner Overdrive "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" ¢Ü Hey, Buck. - What are you doing here? - Well, what are you doing here? I'm waiting for Jerry. He's running, too. Oh, so suddenly he's humping early morning runs, huh? / Um-hmm. Priceless. Well, Buck. Here he is, so... Relax. He ain't gonna see us. Look. Got his head in the clouds. What a clown. He could run these steps like Rocky all day, it's gonna mean zip. No. He's been working real hard. Gina, the fix is in. What? Mo's taking a dive first round, Jerry's gonna win. It won't be a real fight? That'll hurt Jerry real bad. Hey, there's nothing you can do about. Except take advantage. What do you mean? You know what the odds are for Jerry winning in a first round knockout? What? / Twenty to one. That's why I ain't busting Balboa's bubble just yet. There're some real dough to be made first. Gina couldn't resist a sure thing. She was a gambler? I robbed that store so I could get her betting money. Did you tell her how you got it? No. I wanted to impress her. Not tell her I was scum. Had it bad for her, huh, Buck? My whole stupid life. So Gina acts all broken up for Jerry that the fight's gonna be a fake. But dries her eyes pretty quick. And places her own bet on it. Hey, boss. - Can I talk to you for a minute. - Scotty, hey, sure. What happened in that interview was 100% the wrong way. I mean, thumping on anybody. Doesn't matter who. You can't do it. Okay. I assure you, it will not happen again. Well, that's good Scotty 'cause it can't. Anything else? Well, I was hoping the uh-, suspension could be lifted...early. I didn't suspend you Scotty. I encouraged you to take time off. I'd like you to encourage me to come back. How are you feeling? Great. Sorry, Scotty. I can't do it. What do you mean? Why? Well, I'll ask you again. How are you feeling? I said fine. You're not ready yet. Boss... How do you feel, Scotty? Not...not that good. Hey. Come next week. We'll get you back on the job. I thought Jerry was your big love of your life, Gina. He was. So why let him go ahead with the fight you knew was rigged. 'Cause you had money on that fight. Yeah, I did. You took the dough from Buck and the twenty to one odds that came with it. Thirty to one, by the time I placed my bet. Hmm, couldn't resist it, huh? Have a bit of a problem. So all that talk about Jerry's big heart, and how there's no stopping him. Just words? No! But why should all the other shlubs make money off of Jerry and not us? So you did it for the both of you? Yeah. / Why are we gonna believe you? Because I did tell Jerry and it cost me. - Nervous about tomorrow? - No. No? Well, not like tonight. What's so big about tonight? ¢Ü Elton John "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" ¢Ü Well, what do you say? Jerry... Mo's gonna fall down on the first round. You're gonna win. What? Are you joking me or not? We're gonna make some money. Are you saying you put a bet down? Baby... Just go along with it. There's nothing that you can do. It's all set, huh? Jerry, this is our chance. We can get out of this stinking neighborhood. What, by being a bum? That's exactly what I'm trying not to be. I thought you believed in what I was doing. / Jerry, we're stuck. And when we are fifty we will still be stuck. We're not gonna get a break like this again. We'll make our own breaks. You really believe that? That's why I want this fight. To prove it. I guess I should take that back. We see it all so different now. Hmm, short engagement. To make matters worse, I had to go talk Frank Shavers what I'd done. Who's Shavers? From the old neighbohood I worked in his bingo parlor. If anyone had a bet on this fix, it was him. So you told him that Jerry knew about it. And to take his bet back before it was too late. What did he say? There is no taking bets back. So, Frank. You've been big money on this fix, then Gina opens up her mouth to Jerry. I wasn't pleased. So did you retaliate? How would I have done that? How about paying the referee 1,500 bucks to not stop the fight. No matter how bad off Jerry was. Getting me what? Jerry ends up maimed or dead, The boxing world gets the message: Don't mess with Frank Shavers. Ha, ha, ha. I'm not a thug, I'm a businessman. And it was a bad day at the office. So you never tampered with Sonny? I never suspected anyone had. Until now. We're listening. Jerry lasted fifteen rounds. That's incredible, really. But what's more incredible is, Only one person bet on Jerry to do just said. There you go Frank. It finally hit ya, huh? What's that? Three years from now, Mo Bell may be heavyweight champion of the world. That's what you're tangling with. There's no shame in knowing when to walk away. No? It's the same in respect to Gina. Return the ring Jerry. Let my daughter be. Drink in the night before the fight. Put it down. Every reflex has to be right, your mind clear. Father, it don't matter anymore. - What are you, freezing up? - No! Well then, fight! Then you'll have tomorrow night for the rest of your life! - You really think I can do it, father? - Son. I got money on ya. You too, father? You bet on the fight? Now I need you in that ring. Father... / Son. I've raised you from a pup. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for me. So, father needs Jerry to go the distance. That night, seized Jerry's wobbly. I didn't stick around but, Father was huddled up with Sonny when I left. Maybe father bought some insurance from him. Made sure his 'pup' got to the finish line. Putting money on Jerry not to win, but to make it fifteen rounds? That's a pretty specific bet, father. That's because Jerry set that goal for himself. I thought he could make it. And your winnings must've been sweet. I've threw in the towel for Pete's sake. Yeah. With twenty seconds remaining. Because of what I saw in his eyes. Jerry always looked bad. But this time I could see he was cooked. Or maybe throwing that towel was just an act. Huh, father? Look. I can't force you two to believe me. Did you know the fight was fixed? Fixed? Mo made a deal to let Jerry to win in the first round. And Jerry knew about it. No kidding? But didn't wanna go along with it. I wouldn't think he would. And if so, that explains why... Why what? That's why round one. He's been standing around for two minutes! - What the hell's going in out there? - C'mon! C'mon! C'mon, hit me! Oh, wonderful. The boo birds. C'mon, throw him a punch. C'mon! Show me something, chump! - You know what, Mo... - Don't talk! C'mon. C'mon! Stop it, now! Well, you're gonna fight me now, Mo! - What are you doing? - Give me water. What is your mind mush? Want water? I'll give you your damn water, huh? Huh? You've got the rest of your life to make eyes at that girl. - That's not happening. - What are you talking about? I took the ring back. Alright, fine. Come here. Get up. You, wake up! Okay, You get it on with this guy! - Get in there. - Now you want a fight, huh, father. Well, take a look! 'Cause we got one. So in the entire first round Jerry never threw a punch. Making it impossible for Mo to fake a Knock-out. I told Jerry I put some money on him but, He must have thought I'd taken this other bet. The fix. That poor kid. In the end he must have thought even I didn't believe in him. Hey. Hey. My man. Where've you been? Ah, per usual long day. Well, you're here now. We're celebrating. We got a cause or are we better without? I'm back on the job next week. No kidding? Yeah? Way to go. / It's good right? Tops. Tops, brother. Tops. What? Just that simple? Be simpler if I could get a roll in here. Yo, Christina. I'll go again, and get Nicky, too. How you doin'? Good. Didn't know you worked here. Yeah, it's fun for now. Although I find some of the guys who come in here are sort of...half ass. No kidding. Half ass, huh? Uh, but that was before you two came in. Perfect. I got it. Thank you, kind sir. You know, taking it back a sec... You're telling me how happy I'm back. Not asking how I'm doing. Thanks for that. When the hard stuff happens, I say walk it off anyway you can. Whatever. You're the goods, Nicky. But what you can't do? Is Rush's sister. You know what I mean? Oh, what do you think? What are you talking about? Hey, Scotty. Serious. Anyone but that, right? Mo said Jerry kept yelling he took the ring back. Thinking he was talking about the boxing ring. But now we think Jerry meant the engagement ring he bought for Gina. From Jimmy the jeweler. Jimmy still in business? / Well, in the day of the fight Jerry took the ring in and asked for the money back. Well, how much was it worth? Eighteen hundred. But Jimmy wouldn't give him that. He said that the ring had depreciated over three days he'd had it. So what did Jerry get for? Fifteen hundred. Even. We know who paid off Sonny, Mo. Oh yeah? Yeah. Jerry. Now, how does that make sense? Jerry knew you would open up his face bad. And the way he bleeds, he figures the ref'll T.K.O. him. It did pour out, sure enough. He wanted to prove he'd do the whole fifteen with you. Yeah, it sounds like old Jerry. Mo, could some of the things he'd be saying during the fight have been meant for Sonny, and not you? Yeah, didn't make sense coming my way. I'll tell you what else. I've never seen a guy change so much over the course of a fight. You mean Jerry? No, I meant Sonny. Before the fight he had no ounce of respect for that Jerry. But by he end? Brother had tears in his eyes. Jerry, I gotta call it. No. You can't. The deal was a deal. Attaboy, Jerry! Attaboy! C'mon, now! You're my great white hope! Attaboy! I gotta call it Jerry! I didn't like you wanted. Please don't take from me this... Please. That's it! That's it! Stop it! No more! No, I took the ring back! - No more, Jerry. - I took the ring back! You gotta stop! Please! A deal's a deal. I took the ring back! Let's go. Hang on, kid. Hang on, kid. Hang on, Jerry. - I'm not a bum. - I know Jerry. I'm not a bum! Hell no, kid. Doctor!
