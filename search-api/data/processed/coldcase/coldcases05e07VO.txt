No! -  Ow - Oh, oh. Frankenstein, are you all right?! It's not funny, Mom! I can't see. The mask takes away - my "perfil" vision. - Oh. I'll cut the eyeholes bigger. Don't worry, Dobber. You'll have the best costume tomorrow. Pops! Hi, Pop. I'm gonna be Frankenstein for Halloween. That's swell, champ. Hello, dear. Looking beautiful this evening. Supper ready? 20 more minutes. How was work? 'Nother great day. The Edgar Bergen Show! We're missing it. Well, go put it on. Thanks, pet. Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you special bulletin from Intercontinental Radio News. At 20 minutes before 8:00 Central Time, Professor Ferrell of the Mount Jenngservat Chicago, Illinois, reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars... ...Something's happening...ni out of the pit. The mouth is... kind of V-shaped with saliva. Those quivered pulsating monster or whatever it is can hardly move. The thing's rising up now and the crowd falls back. Lord, they're turning into flame! He's followed by the woods... - Mom. - Shh. it's all right. ...the vast pigs... At least 40 people, including six state troopers, lie dead in a field east... Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes... ...lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmland tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars... Hello? Yes. Oh, my God. All right. Felton, what is it? That was Mrs. Brown next door. The Martians are only a mile away. We have to go. But... Dobber, get your coat. Where are the car keys? In your pocket. We need to pack up our bags. Where's Loki? We can't leave Loki behind! The dog'll be fine. - I'll get him. - But, Audrey... He's just in the backyard. I will be right back. Get Dobber's things, Felton. I'll be right back. Extra! Extra! Read all about it. "Martians Take Audrey Metz?" Thank you, sir. Can you at least tell us if the police will be issuing a statement? Those yoyos are up early. We find Hoffa in this hole, boss? Not quite. Deceased female. Broken hyoid bone. Strangled. ME says the remains have been down there for at least 50 years. An old well. Clever dump site. Coins in her purse are all dated from the '30s. Hmm. A-W-M. Her initials? I ran them against all the missing persons records from the '30s. You two believe in Martians? Is this that woman that disappeared in the '30s? Audrey W. Metz. It was the end of the world. My grandmother was eight. Said she had nightmares for over a year. What the hell you guys talking about? October 30, 1938, Scotty. Orson Welles did a radio broadcast of <i>The War of the Worlds.</i> Only he made it seem like it was a news report. People believed it. Millions thought the Martians were invading. Mass panic across the country. And Audrey Metz disappeared that night. And the legend began. A lot of crazy rumors of what happened like, uh, Martians really did take her. Or the Germans. There were Audrey Metz sightings for the next 20 years. Like someone saw her scuba diving in Jamaica. Or working as a spy in Berlin. People got way too much time on their hands. Everyone thought Audrey traveled far and wide. But She never made it out of Philly. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- COLD CASE 507</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- SYNC:abbiemcgee</font> I still can't believe it. Martians? Didn't anybody know this was a prank? The power of radio in those days, Nick. Was the only live news source. Back when the news wasn't all about the latest starlet's drunk driving bust. "My wife and I heard it come over the car radio. "All we could think of was to get back home to see our children before the final attack." Well, churches around the country held "end of the world" prayer meetings. One guy heard the news post-shower, drove all night from New York to Florida in a towel to see his fiancee. Suddenly, everything precious in life became crystal-clear. Yeah. Who do you want to be with when the world ends? I wanna be with the guy that knows it's a hoax. Audrey was a 33-year-old housewife with a husband, Felton and an eight year old son, Robert. Family was packing to go. She went out back to get their dog, never returned. Cops had no leads. It was like she just vanished into thin air. Torn movie ticket found in Audrey's purse. Country's panicking, Audrey hits the movies? Maybe the usher did it. There's handwriting on the back. A-Y-S. More initials? Or second half of a word. Maybe part of an address she wrote down? Nick, you and Miller check St. Luke's Hospital. Elmer Gibbins, witness from back in the day, keeps calling, says he knows who did it. Elmer the same guy that saw her in Germany? Got to start someplace. Meanwhile, let's meet with any of the family still in town. When I was little, I liked to think all those rumors about my mom were true. Living on an exotic island somewhere. She used to read adventure stories to me. I always hoped she was off on one of her own. Anyway, that's what I had to believe. You notice anything different about her behavior before she disappeared? My mom was very happy. Week before she vanished. That a Hudson, Mr. Metz? Yep. 1930 model. Saw one of those at a classic car show few years back. Guy was asking 40 grand for it. Think ours cost $600. Lot of money in the Depression. Especially with your dad out of work for three years. Put a strain on their marriage? Of course. But they loved each other. Well, sometimes that's not enough. Maybe she chose that night to split. My mom would never abandon me. Dad, why were we always so mad at the Indians? Weren't they here first? Aud, have you seen my glasses? Come on, Dobber. No strange questions - at the table. - Put the book away, Sitting Bull. It's time to eat. Soup again? Stop complaining, son. But it doesn't make me full, Dad. I get tummyaches at night. Have my bread, sweetie. Work picking up? Any day now. Well, in the meantime we have bills to pay. Winter's coming. - We can't afford the gas. - Dobber, fetch me some water. What the hell do you think you're doing? We do not discuss these things in front of Dobber. When will we discuss them? We're in trouble, Felton. Things will pick up. You can't keep putting on a suit and tie and going to an empty office. It's my job. We're down to pennies, Felton. Maybe it's time you found other work. The WPA... The WPA will have me digging ditches. If it means putting food in Dobber's stomach, so be it. For the love of God, Felton, the boy's wasting away. I will not become a pampered poverty rat. What will the neighbors think? Who cares what they think? This is your son. I have a reputation. You think the neighbors care about reputations? Like Ralph Bodine, who put a bullet in his head when the stock market crashed? How about Ruth Cayler? I saw her selling apples... Pass the salt, please. Sounds like the marriage was strained. It was just the Depression talking. Their fights ever escalate? I was with my dad that night. We drove around looking for Mom until sunrise. I understand your dad lives here with you. Yes. He's not well. Alzheimer's. Any way we could talk to him? You're welcome to try. Hello, Aud. Have you seen my glasses? Mr. Metz... You look beautiful this morning. I'm... I'm Detective Lilly Rush, and this is my partner, Scotty Valens. We'd like to talk to you about the night your wife disappeared. What time's supper? Uh... Mr. Metz, do you remember the, uh, War of the Worlds broadcast? The Martians on the radio. Yeah, the Martians. Remember that? October 30. Dobber was going to be Frankenstein that Halloween. That's right. We searched all night for Audrey. Then I got the news... This just in: we can now confirm the Martian landing was a hoax, a radio show. The governor has issued a statement; it's all a hoax. We really thought it was the end of the world. Orson Welles, what a son of a bitch. Hello, Aud. Have you seen my glasses? Elmer Gibbins. Just had hip replacement surgery. Claims he saw Audrey back in the day. Doing what? Scuba diving? Well, well. How you doing, neighbor? Hey, Toni. You remember Kat Miller. Hi. Nice to see you again. I'll be down the hall. Sure. Uh, interviewing a witness. Right. Don't let me keep you. No, no. I, uh, I got a sec. How you been? Good. Don't see you much around the building. Busy. People keep killing each other, so... You? Same. People keep getting sick. Never changes. Nothing ever does. Well... it's good to see you, Nick. You too. Take care of yourself. Yeah. I can't believe you finally found Audrey. You knew her well? Yes, ma'am, saw her once a week at the 6th Street breadline. Real nice lady. Tell ya, I always thought they'd be too clever to get caught. "They"? The FBI, dipstick. Don't you get it? Audrey knew the invasion was coming. The store should've opened an hour ago. All we got's time, Audrey. Waiting is as close as I got to a purpose. I got to get home. Dobber's sick. Again? Is he getting any meat or fruit? Only when he dreams about it. The best part of my day used to be waking him up. I swear, he used to sleep with a smile. He'd always have a joke or a funny dream to tell me about when he woke. Now... I like to let him sleep in. Good afternoon, ma'am. If I may be so bold-- you're too beautiful for this much sorrow. I... Thank you. Come to 5th and Diamond. Yours will be the prettiest taxi. I don't understand. Rest assured, I only pick a chosen few. Good day. "Prettiest taxi"? Any idea what that meant? Some kind of government code. FBI. This man said he was with the FBI? Of course he didn't say it. He was an undercover agent, not a moron. Is this guy new? Total rookie. Figures. You see, Audrey was picked special. The FBI knew that the Martians were coming, but the Martians got to her before she could run. Then, the FBI covered it over. Right. Is the boss punishing us for something? Told you not to steal his paper clips. Miss her? Don't even think about it. Expect me to believe that, dipstick? Oh, here's a good one. Lady said, "I saw Audrey jogging with Hitler in Fairmount Park." Let me guess, she's alive and wants to make a statement. Called ten minutes ago. How about a dance boss? Ten cents gets you one song. Oh, this better be good. That guy told Audrey to meet him at 5th and Diamond, right? Used to be where the Palomar Ballroom was in 1938. Palomar Ballroom? What's that? Dance hall. Lot of young women worked there as taxi dancers. I talked to the guy who runs it now, real history buff. That's not a movie ticket. It's a dance ticket. For a dime-a-dance girl. - Mm-hmm. - That's right. Men would pay for dances would last the amount you paid-- like a taxi ride. Yeah. G-rated version of a lap dance. Guy who managed it was named Buzz Moran. He died in 1972. So this Buzz was recruiting Audrey. And that ticket says she took the job. Opens a whole new world of suspects. Yeah. My money says her killer was a client. The Palomar Ballroom. My, oh, my, that feels like a hundred years ago. How did you find me? The Palomar has photos from your day. You're the only one we found, Penny. You mean, I'm the only one still alive. Oh, I'll be gosh-darned. Now, who can imagine being that young? We're investigating the murder of Audrey Metz. We think she was a dancer there. Audrey... I read about it in the papers. You knew her at the club? Oh, you betcha, by golly. We got to be very close. She don't seem to fit the profile of a dancer. Oh, true. Most of us were working-class girls who wanted to dance professionally or be in the movies. Not many moms? Oh, gosh, no. I heard stories about the Palomar in those days. Cops were called in to break up a lot of fights. It could be a rough and humble place. It attracted a lot of dangerous types. How did Audrey handle it? Different class of gal. Had trouble with the tough customers. Have a pleasant evening. You must be Audrey. I'm Penny. Oh, you're gonna love it here. Oh, well, this is just temporary. Till my family gets back on its feet. Do we just stand and wait? You don't wait. You advertise. What if they touch you where they're not invited? Oh, don't worry. Most of these guys are Okay Joes. It's how I met my fiancee Crick. There he is now. The thing is, times ain't that bad. There's good if you know where to look. You think so? You betcha, by golly! Now the band's gonna play a slow one for you. This is called "Always." How ya doing, toots? Ticket doesn't pay for that, sailor. Yeah. What does? How about two sawbucks, you polish my golf shaft? Go to hell. Hey, relax. Let me buy you some giggle water. Warm you up a bit. Why don't you take a rest, pal. The lady seems tired. Why don't you mind your beeswax. You drunk, stupid or both? You wanna talk outside, buster? Sorry, my mistake. Thank you. The owner, Buzz, gave a talking to that sailor. He shipped out the next day anyway. So who was this knight in shining armor? Will Paige. He'd sit in the dark and stare at Audrey, night after night. He was this lonesome rich guy with nothing to lose, and... he gave me the heebie-jeebies. You thinking Will might've hurt her? He was awful violent. Rumor was, he quit the booze 'cause he got in a drunken fight and he killed a guy. Mr. Paige? Detective Rush and Vera. We're investigating the murder of Audrey Metz. I checked your record. Three drunk - and disorderlys back then. - You sent a man to the hospital with your fists, almost killed him. Glad I stopped drinking. Got a witness says you were stalking her at the Palomar Ballroom. Rich man with too much time on his hands? How'd you make out so well during the Depression? I was an inventor. Already retired. Sounds like you were just another guy out to buy a piece of tail. You get rough with her? Audrey wasn't like the other girls. Every night I bought up all her tickets. That's a lot of dancing. Oh, we never danced. My wife is desperately ill. Hospitalized. I found a strength I never knew I had. I did everything I could to help her. And then one day... You lost her? Yeah, I lost her. It's like life is just about survival. Like, love has... fled forever. You can't even see it in people's eyes anymore. You mean you and your husband? I truly loved him once, but... ...since things got so bad, I don't know him anymore. - You think he's changed? - No. What I fear is this is who he's always been. Or you're the one who's changed. Maybe I have. I know I'd do anything to protect my son. Maybe I've found the strength that I never knew I had. You were awful tough with that sailor. I was afraid. You were brave. I was thinking, "There's someone who can hold her own." I was also thinking how big he was, hoping you'd take the first shot. I forgot about that. What? Laughing. Maybe one night we should dance. Maybe. I should... get back out on the floor. Audrey? You're a damned disgrace. Sounds like her husband was a little jealous. He never saw me. Besides, there was nothing to be jealous about. I was still in love with a ghost. Felton didn't know about her dancing? Middle class housewife becoming a taxi dancer...? Scandalous. Tough for an ego - like that to take. - I suppose. I never saw her again. Maybe murder was the only way to get her to hang up her dancing shoes. This is absurd. I told you I was with my dad the whole night. Your mom was a taxi dancer. He found out. You knew. Might've mentioned that to us. Hasn't there been enough speculation and rumor about my mom? Can't you let her rest in peace? We just want to find out what happened. What happened is my mom was trying to feed our family. She sacrificed everything for me. Yeah, but your dad couldn't handle what she was doing. No. They came to an understanding. I told you, Audrey. You will not go back to that place. What do we have to show for these past two weeks? We don't have food to put on the table again! At least I can walk down the street without people thinking that my wife is a... People can think what they want. I applied for a shipping job at the Piper factory. They said I wasn't qualified enough. My God, I've got a degree from Dartmouth. Then we don't have a choice. Then I have to go back. It'll be our secret. You needn't be ashamed of me, Felton. Do you remember when Dobber turned four? That blizzard we got caught in? I had to push the car out of the snowbank. You called me your "hero." You still are. Tell your ma Penny's here. Tell her the good's gone, kid. - Penny? - Yeah. My mom had to take her to the hospital. She had bruises on her neck? Like she was choked. Same way Audrey died. You married Crick in 1939. Yes, we had 15 wonderful years... Well, then, the cancer got him. You were Crick's second wife. In the divorce records, his first wife said he was physically abusive. Well, that's not my business. Penny, we talked to Dobber, said you showed up at their house. Said you had bruises on your neck. I wanted to believe people were good. But I was wrong. What do you mean? Crick wanted me to sell myself. - I said "no," and... - He beat you? Maybe he did the same to Audrey. If anyone is to blame... it's me. You? I went to Audrey for help; I was so upset that night, I just... What is it, Penny? I was jealous of her and Will. I had to prove to Audrey that the world was a bad place. What'd you do? I told her Will Paige's real secret. You sure you're feeling better? You betcha, by golly. Hello. Hi, Will. Look, Buzz says I have to take other tickets. I can't... Just give me a minute. I need to talk. Where were you? I was worried. I'm fine. I can take care of myself. I bought a special ticket tonight. The song that was playing when I first saw you. It's how long this ticket lasts. "Always." Before I met you, I thought anything good in my world was gone forever. I started believing people that said life was just cruel. And then I met you. Love hasn't gone anywhere. It's right here in front of us. The cruel thing would be to ignore it. Will, I can't leave my son. He's all I have. I'll help take care of Dobber. Whatever it takes. I can't. Because of your husband? Because of your wife. I know she's alive, Will. You're still married. I thought you were the kind of man who faced the truth. At least my husband doesn't lie. You're the cruelest of them all. Audrey! Shot of rye, Mickey. Mr. Paige, you never drink. To hell with never. To hell with her. Are you sure the word "always" was on the ticket? Oh, yes. Positive. Same ticket that ended up with Audrey's body. Will saw her again. seems that you've got a selective memory, Will... You saw Audrey again. Only this time she was on to all your lies. Telling people your wife was dead? - That's cold. - Don't you people understand? She might as well have been. She was institutionalized for three years. Back then they called it "mood swings." She was bipolar? What difference is the name? The stigma of mental illness in those days was worse than TB. She never got better? There was a terrific new treatment... called a lobotomy. Left her good as dead. Both of us. I sat in the dark for three years. And then Audrey walked in. That was real romantic, homes. One problem. You were still married. Audrey left you in the dust. Maybe you killed her to keep her. She wasn't mine to keep. - But you found her that night. - No. She found me. I Thought I lost her forever. No feeling worse than that. But things change when it's the end of the world. How so? It was as if nothing else existed but her. ...in Washington, DC, early reports tell us that over 300 are dead or missing in the Capitol. This adds to the widespread devastation... Is that ticket still good? ...we have already encountered from the horrible Martian attack. Thousands are fleeing west from the frightful invaders from space with nothing but fire and destruction in their wake. This announcer cannot help but wonder if these are the end times our Bible has prophesied. It does say "Always." Leave with me, Audrey. It's not too late. Will, you know I can't. What are we going to do? Just hold me. Hold me one time before it's over. We had that one dance, and then she left. I drove around the rest of the night in a daze. And the Martians never came. I didn't have a radio in my car. I didn't even know it was a hoax till morning. But you had that dance. If I had let that moment slip away, I couldn't have lived with myself. Toni Halstead? She's a nurse. Toni... Halstead? she's ... Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. Toni? Toni! Toni? Ah, Toni. - Hey. - Me? - Hi. - What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm on a case. Guy thought it was the end of the world, had to see the girl he was in love with, and they danced to their song, and it made me think about that Sinatra song that was playing on our first date. - Sinatra? - I don't care that you hate my job, or you think we're no good together. I don't want to lose you. I can't live without you. Sinatra wasn't playing on our first date. What? Tupac was. Tupac? Sinatra was playing at the restaurant on our third date. Point is... I didn't want to wait until the end of the world to do this. Hold it! You think you can just waltz in here like some crazy-assed Jerry Maguire, and we're back together? Just like that? I was kind of hoping. Don't say it. Think about it. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting! I was talking to this, uh, guy. Had a car just like that. Said he didn't get the news about the hoax 'cause he was driving all night. - So? - Well, cars didn't have radios till 1932. That Hudson didn't have one. That's a 1930 model. You came over to talk about cars? Your father heard the news about the hoax when he was home. You really look for your mother till sunrise? She came home that night, didn't she? I... I had to believe the world was a good place. You saw her? No, but I heard her come home. I was... I was in bed, falling asleep. The next morning, I convinced myself it was just a dream. After a while, I started to believe that. Better than the reality. I swear I don't know what happened. My dad could never... He's... He's just a sick... old... man. Thank you, Aud. What time is supper? About 20 minutes. Felton? Yes. I can't believe it was all a hoax. Is Dobber all right? Dobber's in bed. Where were you? Answer me. Damn it! I was at the ballroom. I was with him. I finally had something to believe in at the end of the world. What did you have, Felton? Nothing. Is everything okay? Where's Dobber? I looked everywhere for the dog, and I had to help Miss Curran start her car, and... It was a hoax. What? The invasion-- it was a lie. Just like the one you're telling. You went to see someone. Yes. I had to. What did that place do to you? It made me strong. I... met someone... ...who made me realize that I'm still alive. What about us? Our marriage died years ago, Felton. Aren't you tired of playing pretend? I just want the girl that I fell in love with. That person doesn't exist anymore. Why should you have someone to go to? Felton... Everyone was afraid tonight. Do you know what scared me the most at the end? I had no one to turn to. My world was empty. Go to bed, Felton. You're tired. Don't you tell me what to do! Now fix me my supper. Fix it yourself. Audrey... you will do as you're told. - Felton, please. - You're my wife. You love me, damn it! I'm your hero! I'm your hero! In case you missed it, folks, there's no Martians. The only danger was in our imagination. Now let's all relax with some romantic music. Here's "Always."
