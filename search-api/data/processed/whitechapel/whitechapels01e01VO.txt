- Commander, how are you? - How are you? And that's why men like Joe are the future of British policing. No pressure there then. Keep back. Do not come any... closer. Listen, you've been told once. I don't want to tell you again. We need bold initiatives in community partnerships to ensure good practice within a management framework. This is about the effective delivery of sanctions to the stakeholders. Stakeholders? Five years ago we simply called them criminals. Excuse me, excuse me. - Night. - See you tomorrow. My God! I've got you, love. You're going to be all right. PCSO Bousfield to control. Receiving, over. Receiving you, Mary. Go ahead. Immediate assistant and an ambulance required at the old board school off Commercial Street. There you go, love. Christ have mercy. Fitz, coffee no sugar. - Two teabags, Skip. - Thanks. - Usual, McCormack. - People can't die at a decent time? Got your own crappuccino there, Kent? Right, what have we got? Let's get suited and booted, boys. All impressed with you in there. The good money's on you making commander in three years. - That's very generous. - All part of the plan, Joe. - Yes, sir. - No need to be formal. It's what your father wanted. He'd be proud. We've got a dead woman in Whitechapel. Probable domestic. No DI. - Bit of a rough squad. - I'll take it. - Ready to head up your 1st murder? - Absolutely. Good lad. Once you've ticked that box we can move you on. Get you out of the trenches and up to headquarters where you belong. - I don't know what to say. - How about thank you? Thank you, sir. Excellent. Commander Anderson's sending us a new DI. Good. - Cos we don't know what we're doing. - Another fast-tracker. Had I've have known, I'd have made vol-au-vents. I'll tell the others. Now that's a good look. - DI Chandler. - DS Miles. We'll get you suited up. This way. The victim's name was Cathy Lane. 43 years old. Mother of three. Separated from her partner. She was found around 2 am by a community support officer. Cathy was still alive then but by the time the emergency services got to her she was dead. - Who identified her? - We all did. Let's go. Have you worked a murder scene before? I'm not a virgin, you know. I've had my fair share. Oh, well, you'll be laughing then. Streak of piss. - Hello, Ray. - We've got to stop meeting like this. Wouldn't be the same without a dead body between us. - Morning. - DI Chandler. Can you see the cuts to her throat? On the side here we have the first incision. There is a second cut, more decisive, right round. This is a deep one. Seems to go all the way through to the vertebrae. - Do you want to get a look at this? - No, I'm good, I'm good. - There's not much blood. - No, it doesn't look like much. I know what you're thinking, she was dumped but you'd be wrong. It's all here. It's soaked into her clothing. She's sodden. It's Interesting, there's no struggle. There's a bruise here and more on the other side with... small petechial haemorrhages around the eyes, suggesting asphyxia. I think she was strangled first and this is how he dropped her. Just a snapshot based on obvious injuries. Patience. I want a plan of the area. Fitzgerald and McCormack are doing that. Witnesses. Mary Bousfield, Community Support Officer. This way. I saw a man with a long knife. He was over 40. Dark coat. About 5'10". Posh but shabby. - Had a funny hat. - Funny, how? Funny, unusual. - Had flaps. - Did you see his face? I'm really sorry. I know police aren't supposed to cry. I cry all the time, Mary. You should see my mascara run. Thanks. Let 'em get her off to hospital. Cathy Lane was a battered woman. She split from her partner 6 years ago. Always arguing about money for the kids. He wouldn't pay while she lived with other men. They'd have too much to drink, have huge rows. We were constantly banging him up in the cells for the night. Once he stuck a potato peeler in her head. Bang, like that. - I knew we'd find her dead one day. - Who is this guy? Rob Lees. He's a butcher. - Works with long sharp knives. - Let's go and talk to Rob Lees then. Don't you have a desk to go to? No... I don't. Let's go. - There you go, guv'nor. Lovely. - Cheers, thanks.</i> Police. Can I have a word, please, sir? - Hello, Jim. - Got a new boy? You'll get me into trouble. He's the boss. Can I help you, sir? - Rob Lees. - Rob's not here. - Do you know where he is? - Nah. His mobile's switched off and he's not picking up at home. Has he been at Cathy again? - Is she all right? - She's dead. Has Rob got a woolly hat? - A woolly hat. - No, he wears one of those... furry Russian things with flaps. Get Rob Lees' flat watched. Can we find out where his mobile is right now and get someone down to his local? He is, I know. But what can you do? We'd better get a move on. Before we go anywhere can we get something straight? - I'm in charge of this investigation. - I'm just showing you the ropes, son. I didn't expect this. Welcome to hell, gentlemen. I think the killer knelt by her head, held her with his left hand, then cut her throat left to right with his right hand. The blood would've run away from him. There are no cuts to her clothing so I assume her skirt was pushed up. The community support pulled her skirt down but she thought she'd been raped.</i> Take swabs but I haven't seen any physical signs of rape.</i> And here's the surprise. It's as if he's tried to gut her. On the left-hand side, two inches in, we have a deep, jagged wound. On the right-hand side there are four more cuts. The stomach has been cut in several places, and the intestines have been exposed. I think he stayed at his position at her head,</i> stabbed down, then draw the knife towards himself quite violently.</i> These cuts were done quickly. I'd say the whole attack would have been over in a few minutes. - She wouldn't have known what hit her. - Rob Lees is what hit her. - What can you tell us about the weapon? - It has a strong blade. Long? Like something you use for butchering meat? The thing is, skin stretches and soft tissues compress It's hard to talk about knife size. - I can only speculate very generally. - So speculate for me. Something like a hunting knife. - Or a boning knife? - I can't rule it out. Thanks, sweetheart. And there he is. Half the division out looking for him, Rob Lees turns up on his own doorstep looking like ten kinds of shit. Been up all night, smells like a pub. - Tell your mum you'll be home for tea. - Excellent. - What are you doing? - Going to interview the suspect. Why? DIs are supposed to sit behind their desk and drink herbal tea. I'll treat it as an office outing. Look, I know this guy. He's a liar, he's a manipulator. And what's worse, he knows his rights. So sit in if you have to, that's your prerogative. But I'm asking you to let me do what I'm good at. OK... sir? Fine. But I want this resolved as much as you do. So we do this together. We get it right and we get it over with. OK, boys, phones off. That's my seat. And that's my seat in there but we're all making sacrifices. This interview is being recorded and conducted at Whitechapel police station. The time is 10:15am. The date is 31 August 2008. I am Detective Sergeant Ray Miles. The other officer present is... Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler. - The solicitor present is... - Lydia Hart. Please state your full name and date of birth. Robert Lees. 11 March 1972. You do not have to say anything but...</i> Sanders, shut up. - Do you understand the caution? - Yeah, I understand. Where were you this morning at 2am? Drunk tank. Charing Cross. I got a ten-copper alibi. It checks out. They were looking in on him every half hour for the whole night. Where's the new DI? Probably with the commander begging for a transfer. Arts and Antiques Squad. Never got the chance to know him. Well, we won't miss hello. Got to be a record that. Shortest-serving DI. Rob Lees is no longer a suspect. Everybody. Listen, everybody, Rob Lees is no longer a suspect. Now that we... Now that we no longer have Rob Lees as a suspect... Now that Rob Lees is no longer part of this... Is no longer a s... Yeah. Now that Rob Lees is no longer a s... We've got to start over. We've got a description of the suspect, so let's find him on CCTV. He's wearing a hat with flaps, so he should stick out like a sore thumb. - Sanders, you're good at watching TV. - I am. You take first shift on that. Fitz, draw up a rota. Right, Rob Lees has been eliminated from this inquiry. We start afresh. Consider this a new investigation. I need some chalk. I might have some. I can wait. As long as it takes. Teacher's pet, arse licker. - Thank you... Kent. - Kent. Thank you, Kent. Right, our suspect is in his 40s, average height and build. Dark complexion, wearing a hat with ear flaps. It's a distinctive look so... let's start with CCTV opportunities and find this guy. - Great idea. We'll start tomorrow. - No, we start now. End of shift. Unless you're authorising double time. Oi. Sorry. Oh, dear God. What's his name? Spell it for me. Phwoar. Who's let off? You're a detective. Work it out. Tell him to wait upstairs. Got a bloke upstairs, says he knows everything about the murder. Miles. I beg your pardon? In your own time, Mr Buchan. She was lying on her back... skirts pulled up. She looked like she was drunk. Her throat was cut and her stomach had been mutilated. - You saw the mutilation? - Not exactly. Where were you standing when you saw her body? I wasn't there. Mary Ann Nichols was the first canonical victim of Jack the Ripper and she died on 31st August 1888. So? Jesus Christ. 31 August. Same date, same time of night. She also died next to a board school. - I was describing her injuries to you. - I don't bloody believe this. My book. It has all the canonical murders and some other events I think were linked. I think the man who killed your lady was copying Jack the Ripper. I'll bet she was lying on her back, head pointing east, eyes open, hands by her sides, palms open, legs out straight, slightly parted. - A perfect re-creation. - You're a Ripperologist, aren't you? Why, yes, I am. And I also host an excellent Ripper tour. A lot of the tour operators promote inaccurate theories. I pride myself on my strict adherence to the known facts. Here's a fact. You're a loser. Now get out before I nick you for wasting police time. Keep the book. It'll help you predict what the killer will do next. There are at least 4 more deaths to come if I'm right. Out! You should be grateful. I'm giving you a head start. They never caught the Ripper. Time and history have spirited his identity away. - Get out. - Thank you for your time. Every time there's a stabbing in Whitechapel they come crawling out of the woodwork. I hate Ripperologists. Right. - Forensics. - There's nothing. No prints, no fibres, no DNA. Nothing. - Witnesses. - Nobody heard anything. Well, they all knew there was a fire, they heard the fire engines. No one heard a scream, a struggle, nothing. Well, Mary Bousfield's a witness. Talk to her, see if she remembers anything else. Friends and family? Well, everyone I spoke to was very upset. There were no enemies. No motive. Right, so we've got no physical evidence, no witnesses, no known... no known motive. Right. I want everything done again. Knock on every door, talk to Cathy's friends, go through CCTV again. How can you conduct an inquiry like this? Look at the state of you, look at your desks. There could be actions here. Clean it up and log it in. I want paperless desks. Use your bins, you see? Use your bins. And empty them at the end of every night. Who's the office manager here? Well? - I am, sir. - Sort it out, McCormack. It's a disgrace! And haven't... haven't you heard of showers? Or irons. I mean, where are your ties? Where's your tie? - Get your feet off. Where's your tie? - I'll get one. It's no bloody surprise that potential witnesses aren't talking. You don't look professional. And it smells in here! Get yourselves organised. Self-discipline, self-respect, Deodorant. Go! This is what real policemen look like. This is what real policemen smell like. I wouldn't expect you to understand. Your courses may look good on paper but they count for nothing here. We're not paper policemen! This is a murder investigation, not a beauty contest! I think he's got obsessive compulsive disorder. Never known a man so obsessed with cleanliness in my life. Must be gay. Do you think? - I've got gaydar. I can tell. - Going to have a shower then? Am I going to have a shower? Fresh as a daisy. Oh, my God. I've found him! I've found him! This is from the camera at Puma Court just before the murder. There's the hat. Looks like a deerstalker. He looks like Sherlock Holmes. - Or Jack the Ripper. - Shut up, you nonce. What's he wearing under his coat? It's an apron. You can keep the book. It'll help you to predict what the killer will do next.</i> There are at least four more deaths to come if I'm right.</i> The Star's headline read "Leather Apron".</i> The only name linked with the Whitechapel murders.</i> A noiseless midnight terror. A strange character who prowls about Whitechapel after midnight.</i> Universal fear among the women. There was a great fire the night Mary A. Nichols died,</i> only streets away from where she had her throat cut and body mutilated.'</i> Shit. Hello! Are you all here for the world-famous Buchan's Guider Ripper Tour? Good-o. If you'd all like to step in, please. Save the old voice. Now, we will be visiting all the sites of the Ripper's murders as well as some of his regular haunts. So I must ask if everyone here is over 18. - Are you over 18, young lady? - Yes! Good-o. Now... This is a two-hour walk. And it is not suitable for those of a weak or squeamish disposition. It will be dark. It will be frightening. And maybe tonight we shall see someof the ghosts... of Whitechapel. OK, that's £10 per person, please. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Enjoy the tour. We're going off-piste tonight. None of the other tours come here. They don't appreciate its significance. This passageway was known as George Yard and it was here on a first-floor landing on 7 August 1888 that a terrible discovery was made. A woman, stabbed 39 times and left to die. Her name was Martha Tabram. And she may have been the Ripper's first victim. Some Ripperologists discount her since her throat wasn't cut, nor was she mutilated. She's not a Ripper victim, they say. Doesn't fit the pattern. A serial killer does not emerge fully formed. Even he must learn his craft. And Jack learned quickly. Let us visit the place where he killed his first canonical victim, Mary Ann Nichols! I think this man has killed before. I want to look for... previous in the last few months or so. A murder with overkill. 39 stab wounds to the torso and legs. - And this is from where? - It's an idea. - 39 stab wounds is very specific. - It might be nothing. - It is. The Ripper's for tourists. - You're ignoring the possibility... - There was no murder like that. - Are you sure? Course I am. It's my job to know. - Serious assault. Maybe she survived. - You are kidding. You've been given a job, will you... just do it? Sir. Kent, there was a fire on the night of the murder. It might be connected. - Find out all you can. - Yes, sir. And it's not Father's Day, you're not the world's greatest lover and... What does IOFB mean? I Only Fire Blanks. The wife got it for me after I got the snip. Get them off. No sense of humour, that's his problem. He don't want to be one of us. He's like a wife who wants to change all your bad habits. Another plastic copper. - Not a real detective. - Sarge! I think you should see this. Emma Jones. August 7. She was found with a lump on her head and 39 stab wounds. - Spot on, sir. - Did she identify her attacker? She said he was young, around 5'9" with dark hair and she reckoned he was a soldier. - Why? - She saw tattoos. - Thought they were regimental. - Which regiment? Sir, she was stabbed 39 times. She couldn't really say. A murder in a school yard, an attempted murder by a squaddie. - A connection? - I want to talk to her. - She's in hospital. - Kent, come with me. I've got to pack this in, buy a nice wee pub in the country or something. He doesn't look well. I hate hospitals. What do you think's wrong with him? Excuse me, Dr Phillips, please. I'm looking for Dr Phillips. Are you sure? Maybe I could help you? Dr Phillips, please. He's not here. I think he swapped shifts with Dr Cohen. - Maybe he can help you. - Thank you. I didn't treat Emma Jones but I am aware of her case. Does this account look familiar? 22 stab wounds to the trunk. Left lung penetrated in five places, the right lung in two. Heart penetrated once. Liver penetrated five times. Spleen twice and the stomach six times. The wound on the breastbone made a long instrument, possibly a bayonet. This is the attack on Emma Jones. No, it happened over 100 years ago. Yes, heart penetrated once. I see. In Emma Jones's case the knife glanced off the ribs. - The heart was not pierced. - Is that why she survived? - That and the ambulance. - I'd like to speak to her. That's not possible. She's in intensive care. - Even so... - In a coma. I'm sorry. Thank you. Why would somebody copy a hundred-year-old murder? They never caught the Ripper. Did they come close? Perhaps. But we'll never know. The real Jack probably committed suicide after the last murder. Maybe he plunged into the icy Thames taking his secrets with him. And we are left with his legacy - the birth of the serial killer. My book. An encyclopaedia of facts. All the clues you need to start your own hunt for Jack. Will you be the one to find the Ripper? - Thank you very much. - Oh, thank you. That was very interesting. Thank you. Good tour. Guten Abend. I normally get a few bites. Wasn't on song tonight. Too many Germans. They don't give much back. I like the Yanks. Great enthusiasm. And they like a souvenir. - Can I have a word? - Absolutely. You can buy me a drink. So, I suppose you're the Ripper's biggest fan. I don't think fan is the right word. I don't admire what he did. You seem to enjoy the murders though. All the details. - You pretty much live it every night. - Oh, dear. I am a performer for the tourist hordes, that is true, but... in my heart I'm a detective, like your fine self. You know what's it's like, the irresistible siren call of a mystery, the... delectable twist of a conundrum. We are slaves to that delicious eureka moment when the scales fall away and everything is laid bare. There's no eureka moment in what I do. I follow the bloody footprints and arrest the man holding the knife. But that is tragic. To be a detective and not have the fire. So you're more interested in being a detective than a Ripper. I'd be a poor man's Ripper. Only able to dispatch small dogs and ladies under five foot. On the night of the murder, I was watching my mother sing with the church choir in aid of the roof restoration fund. I fell asleep and disturbed everyone with my snoring. Can you help me? Yes. The man who murdered Cathy Lane... will kill again. This is the pattern. Emma Jones, stabbed 39 times. 7 August. Survived, just. Martha Tabram, stabbed 39 times. 7 August 1888. Died. Cathy Lane, throat cut, mutilated. 31 August. Mary Ann Nichols, throat cut, mutilated. 31 August 1888. The man who attacked and killed these women in 1888 was Jack the Ripper. The man who's attacking these women in 2008 is his biggest fan. - We have a copycat. - Here we go again. Come on. This is your patch. You should have spotted this. You should be ashamed that it's taken a plastic like me to work this out. All right, all right. - The Ripper only killed prostitutes. - Correct. So you think Emma and Cathy were on the game? - No. - There's nothing to suggest - either of them were toms. - Good point. Were they attacked in the same place as his victims? Those places no longer exist. Theslums were cleared and the roads changed. With the greatest of respect, these women were attacked in unconnected locations by different people. A soldier in his 20s, about 5'9" and a 40-something man wearing a deerstalker hat. Different people, different location. You had a theory but... you're new to this and it's easy to get carried away with all the history in the area. - Game over. - Right, who's hungry? The killer could be dressing up to match the historical suspects. Dressing up? So he's a perv then. No. No, no, no, no. So that the witness descriptions match what the police had in 1888. The police looked for a soldier after Tabram's death. The prime suspect with Jones's stabbing is a soldier. Prime suspect with Mary Ann Nichols, a man in a leather apron. Think about it. The guy in the CCTV had an apron under his coat. I thought Jack the Ripper had a black bag a top hat and walked through smog. I think that'd draw attention in Brick Lane, don't you? September 8th 1888, the next victim was Annie Chapman. I think on 8 September we'll have a murder on Hanbury Street. We need to be there to stop it. - I've heard it all now. - Total crap.</i> Joe, what you're proposing goes against all procedures. You gain nothing by chasing bogeymen and you stand to lose everything. - I can see a pattern emerging. - You're ambitious, that's good, but you're letting your ambition cloud your judgement. You want this murder to have meaning because death should be significant, but in truth most murders are banal. - I'm not imagining this. - Take my advice. Step back a little. Detach yourself. And if another woman dies? Then we never had this conversation. This obbo's a waste of time. No one will get murdered tonight by a copycat Jack the Ripper. So eat up. If my mother could see you now, do you know what she'd say? She'd say you shouldn't go chase any suspects till at least half an hour after you've finished eating. Half an hour? We'd be here all night, mate. Our historical murder won't happen till 5am. I thought I could eat but you take the biscuit. Come on. This is a farewell meal for our good friend DI Chandler. He gambled and he lost. This is his last supper... on expenses. Can we have more beers? When I eat curry I can smell it on my pits the next day. - Do you want one, sir? - No, thanks. You should. You look like a copper on an obbo. What he means, sir, is that you need to relax, Blend in. Make it look like. Nothing remains of no.29 Hanbury Street. And this is as close as we can get... to where the body of Annie Chapman was found in the back yard on this very night in 1888. And it was a terrible sight. He didn't just cut her throat. He tried to cut her head off. He split her open and threw her intestines over her shoulder... like a grotesque scarf. Not much left of poor Annie Chapman. Just a few sad belongings at her feet. Moving on. Good luck to you, sirs. We should check him out. He just seems to know a lot about it. It's his job. Funny job. Bloody waste of time, resources and my patience. I told you nothing'd happen. As soon as we're stood down I'm having a word with the commander. I'm having a slash. 5am, Skip. That's it for the DI then. Not so much fast track as bus fare home. You going to call it then, sir? I tried, didn't I? - You did save a life tonight. - Yeah. I'll put it on my CV. Where is he? Number four, round the back. Establish the perimeter. Get Dr Llewellyn. Get Miles and then follow me. - DS Miles, come in, over. - Skip. - Skip, we're up. - Oh, Jesus. He took hold of her by the chin and commenced the incision from left to right.</i> An attempt had been made to separate the bones of the neck.</i> The abdomen had been entirely laid open.</i> The intestines lifted out of the body...</i> and placed by the shoulder of the corpse.</i> It's the Ripper. - He was right, weren't he? - Yeah. Congratulations, you were right. All you have to do now is solve the unsolvable and catch the most famous serial killer that ever lived. Good luck. The double event is imminent. The night he killed two women, a soldier has been beating up girls and threatening to gut them. We've got a prime suspect.
