Currently, yes. You listen to talk while browsing room looking someone to sleep. People come here for advice, console, share stories. In bed with someone who knew in the group of singles. That is not true. People come here because 've gathered conveniently a collection of available premises within a group. That is why they are here, right? Correct. So I propose a party. - I care? - No. Go ahead. All in favor of one party, contribute some cash. So if I'm reading this correctly, this is something that the group would enjoy? You know what? Maybe it's time to bring our new skills to the field. Bring biscuits. You are not allowed to plan. You just have to go. A little problem with the party. - A little problem with my assistant.

Look, even with the airfare, it is still cheaper to use a provider of Baton Rouge - ... One of New York. - I wanted to serve the cakes. - The biscuits are not the issue. - There is an issue now? Of course there is an issue. Josie, the next time Trevor is here, there's no rest for the bathroom. - Mardi Gras! - Excuse me? That is the issue. So clearly, Cajun need a supplier, and I know a great -- great girl, great smile great donuts crab stuffing. You know this woman? I know, and great demand. Look, it would be a feast of Mardi Gras properly without it. Okay. Cover the cost to bring the supplier. Excellent. This is unbelievable.

I would love to help you with your party Mardi Gras in New York, Mr. Pierce, but I hired Brad Pitt pelarle for a grape on a rocket to Mars that day. J.T., I know you. One question, when one type of service deliveries appear in your business with a passenger ... you will rise to that plane </ i></i> I have been in the City 20 minutes, and you saw two types holding hands and the restaurant of "Seinfeld." Well ... Yes, go to the matinee of "My I", and have your bingo board of City of New York full. What is this place? This is where the party is. I was hired to cook for a party at a house in pornography. What happens to you those in blue states? No, no, no. It was a pornographic film, but it became a bar. Here. I took the liberty of Sign in to your room. I live in Louisiana ... not in a cave. I can see it is an apartment. For the rest of the world ... but for you, this is a hotel with all services. See? Have your mentitas, clean towels, fresh flowers. - This is Felix, the concierge. - I'm not a janitor. - Try to get your sex slave? - Let's see where the day takes us. Because all of my dress Good kitchen knives, - ... And my key ring is a whistle. - I promise I'll be safe here. Ago in New York always so cold? We have hot and muggy if you stay a while. Okay, who is ready to cook? I need a bowl of jambalaya ... - To carry. - Sale in moments. I do not know if that is okay come here for lunch. A person should eat in an atmosphere of calm and familiar, surrounded by beauty. Is that ... jambalaya? Well, yes it is. Like the jambalaya? I lived in Louisiana for a couple of years, so, well ... yes. God. That smells like if true. You have to try. In fact, I think I have an extra spoon. Man. Damn. That's good. Have any idea how hard it is ... find good food Cajun in this city? Sorry, but today is the day to steal a guy a bowl of jambalaya. You do not have to steal. I know where you can get more. You know what this is? It is a hurricane with your name on it. - How much money was in that hat? - Enough. Cajun crab sandwiches? Are excellent. I am anxious to know the cook, for which I paid. - Where is the kitchen? - Going through those doors. So ... can cover my turn on Friday? I have tickets for Madonna. - Perhaps, rabbit, maybe. - I really want to see it, Trevor, and I have already asked all others. Or you cover me, or an invention Health code violation and I closed the place. I think perhaps we can negotiate a deal. Yes! I am so happy that you have snacks like crab. That is, it's fun cooking for people who do not eat this kind of food every day. I am so happy that Trevor has contacted me. Yeah, about that -- When they met, and you Trevor? This morning at the airport. - No, no, I mean originally. - This was the first time I saw him, but it looks really nice. You mean you do not know before? Perhaps your family know his family y. .. Not that I know. No, but it has been incredible. Now, I'm sorry. I just -- I have to concentrate. This shrimp etouffee does not beat himself. Trevor. Why choose Robin to cook -- Watch this. What am I looking at? The human condition. Yes, of course, the human condition -- There is, in all its glory. Sabes? It is a fact that the way you dance is the way that you love. Is that true? Maybe you're a Jerry Lewis, you know? As one of those guys who move around. Or maybe you're the dealer, you know? Like when you're dealing, spreading. Sabes? Or maybe you're Space Ghost. And then there's the punishment. - I do not dance, so ... - My theory is confirmed. - Quick Jump ... only. - Why? Because I am part of percentage unfortunate of the population seems an idiot when dancing fast. What makes you think you can not dance? I thought it was a adequate dancer until I saw the video my first year dancing. My first and last high school dance. Wait a minute. Do not go to a dance after that? Girls are so sensitive to the fact of being teased and ridiculed. The key to dancing is getting caught. Sabes? Out of your head. That is what I have. So tell me why Robin knew that? Dr. McCrae. Joe ... What are you doing here? Trevor invited me. Of course he did. It turns out that we are both large Fans of Cajun food. Sorry. I knew it was not a party group for singles. Although I met Trevor in his office, so I guess that That makes sense. What is it? Because I'm still confused. Things should be clarified at any time. Someone wants lobster pie? Peaches! Joe. This ... Peaches is. Our cook is Peaches. No, not anymore. Joe was the only person I called so. We went to high school together. We have not seen in years. It's like a strange coincidence. Is that ... coincidence? Well, I might be somewhat responsible. I heard that Robin is a great chef of Cajun food, and I learned that Joe loves Cajun food, you know what? Who cares how it happened? Is the destination. Maybe I should use discuss this in the alley. If you and I are going to be fighting you better remove the earrings. I do not know how to fix this, - But you're playing with fire. - Love is fire, love is passion. It's so game. It's in the description of my work. Well, the description of my work is trying to help my patients, and prevent it from hurting themselves or others. And you're bringing together Robin and Joe to have a world of pain. This relationship is doomed. Are you sure you're not Greek? Because you are too dramatic. You are not a god. You are not omniscient. Joe stole the record or spy my sessions with him. Or something, and whatever you did was something terrible, because he is unable -- Not in a position to start anything now. And he and Robin and I will pay to pick up the pieces. Yes I did something terrible. I can not do this. I can not do this. I think now you get regodearte You know what? Robin, do not worry. I will fix this. - No. - Let him go. It is the opposite of a superhero. Is rare. In all my ... fantasies of "See Joe Adams again." The kiss was exactly true. You really should go to change my shirt. I do not want to walk around the festival appears that a baby vomited on me. Joe! Where are you going? Hey, come on! This is your golden opportunity! The girl for which he sighs, the girl to write to him when you were in Iraq. Dr. McCrae spoke to you about that? Because that is unprofessional. Look, the truth is ... was in the waiting room dropped when the cards and then, you know, I took the loan. Find Peaches and organized this meeting, so the two could be again. I did. Are you crazy? Not at all. I am colorful. Get letters from the trash half wet, half-burnt, and read it. That is not crazy? Of eccentric, maybe. Look, I loved those letters, and I really think that Peaches Also you will love. Stop calling it "Peaches." Not have given him the cards, or not? No. Never ... But ... But what? Did your other personality? It could have been left in her bed. Thinking that you and Peach -- I mean Robin could be on that bed tonight. And that might be the perfect ending, perfect for a night. Robin can not see those letters. I think that a harasser crazy. It is bad enough The Hague kissed it! Hey, no, look, I saw the kiss. There was nothing wrong with him. The problem was to go out shooting. I wanted to stay. Let's go back, okay? We can tell Robin to go out running to put money in the parking meter. I could sell it. - What I say, your seat. - I can go back to Peaches. - Why not? - It's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. Love is simple. He had a plan, okay? And this was not in the plan. I want those cards! Come on. That's what crazy love. Even where it is impractical, even when it's drawbacks -- Not be assumed that saw these. I am very happy to have. Yes, yes, yes. Coming. Hello? Trevor, you know where is Joe? Claire Bear! Good morning. - Joe Adams. What are you? - Happy to report that ... Joe and Robin are currently closed. - Joe missed his meeting today. - Anything that afflicts Joe, I predict that the moment my plan is fully implemented, he will be cured. You are greatly out of your element. I can say that I talk, please </ i></i> I will. In fact, I'm desperate by a change of underwear. So anyway, I venture there. </ i></i> Promise me that this is the last time I get a report about your underwear. Again. Show me what you got, buddy. Come to the left ... Right y. .. No! Come on.

I am opening the door. I do not pay attention. Remain in their field. Trevor? You can open your eyes. They are dressed ... And out of bed. And slept on the floor. You know, it was agreed that I use my bed, maybe I was not clear. - I slept in bed. - Me on the floor. You do not ... We must refamiliarizarnos, I mean, we have not had yet a real quote. Southerners. Well, OK, refamiliar√≠cense you. I have something in mind for the real event.

Please can you check in my bag, and see if I have an extra shirt? Robin! Wait, I can explain. No need to explain. Book a flight to Winnipeg tomorrow, and had no thought some reason .. by which might be mention it? I thought this could be something. I realized that not only was your weekend. Taxi! I could not tell, okay? I did not want to think he was a coward. - Only ... I can not return. - Go where? Iraq. Called me. I was supposed to report tomorrow. You are deserting? This moment, now ... That's why I could not tell you. Could not bear to see your reaction. You gonna cold. This war has ruined me. I close my eyes ... And I'm back there. Driving after a suicide bomb. It blew itself to a crowded market. I am looking without aid while a wounded colleague calling his wife. I can not do it again. I can not go back -- Do not you owe me an explanation. I read your letters. Children? I do not know how they do in Cajun country, but here in the big city, we require shoes and shirt. What? - is having lunch now. - She does not care. </ I></i> Why not tell me that Joe was fleeing the country? Because there is this thing called Doctor-patient privilege. - Sorry, Dr. McCrae. - There was not much you could do. Just give me a minute with Trevor, please. While we the issue of disclosure. Why does not mention that I was flying ... the high school girlfriend of Joe well you could play God? I am a God, okay? If I ever know I'm doing something divine, never finish anything. "Hi Claire, yes, I'm brushing teeth. " "Hi Claire, yes, I making toast. " "Claire: Yes, I am arranging a flight." See what I mean? I tried to make it perfectly clear that the relationship was doomed. You had to open the Pandora's box. And please, do not tell me that Pandora had a great rack. I still have. God! I was so close. I was going to close the deal in the couple tonight. - I had planned this great event. - I see. You are the victim here. No Joe, no Robin ... You. I quit my room. What was the big date? Would welcome them with dancing never had. Look at you. Mercenary, but sweet. I think they need this appointment. And frankly, it could provide some closure so they do not have to spend another ten years wondering, "what if?" I do not get credit for closing. Get it for love. Well, maybe you just this once, are not in your account. Perhaps this is something nice for two people whose relationship never had a chance. Think this is a good idea? Yes, I think it will be very beneficial. - This makes it easier. - What's easier? We need to borrow your car. Yes, the flight tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. to Baton Rouge, leaving from Newark. Thank you very much. Well, at least I will see you soon before I go to Canada. Yes I would like you to come with me. You know, the party's annual sloshball of Peachtree is the next weekend. We could use a bell. Sloshball? Softball, but ... Uncle Ronnie puts barrels at first base and third as well. For the fourth entry, Dad is a three layer and cry about how the South will rise again. And Mom and Aunt Sue despise the cake from the other. Es .. only anarchy. Okay. Get hats, kids. Let's experiment a rite of passage. Here is your bouquet.

Incubated these confabulations produced outside of bypassing, because it can not simply walk toward a woman and invite them to leave. I will have to happen tonight. Just preparing the bomb. Man, maybe I should spend more time in the secondary. You see, you missed all these secondary social because you were concerned about the dance. Could have been kissing all the time. You know how to do that, no? Okay, bring the whole the world to the dance floor </ i>.</i> Only  Scroll down a bit. Here it is, is perfect. </ I></i> Great smile, nice.

I left excited  # # Correct me. It is the study of "Hee Haw." We're going to love. "Corazon intrepid" Really? Think is the best option? That is not the relationship is doomed because Joe is afraid of return to Iraq? So, I do not know. If I choose a song, perhaps choose something that not emphasize the fact that Joe is going to desert. Joe told me he likes this song. And indeed, received the Cross of distinguished service, you know? It is an incredibly brave man. I sent him because he could not leave behind what she had seen. Is anguished, but not a coward. And I sent it to me, - And then do not listen to my recommendation. - But still -- Well, there are all kinds of courage, Trevor. With what Joe saw there, I think to get up every morning and face the day is an act of courage. And is this other guy, I think, experienced a tragedy in its past, and can not handle it. Choose fend inventing a fictional character. and hide under a false reality. What? You mean that pretends be Captain America or -- Wait. I see. - You speak to me. - Nothing's wrong, right? You know. It's funny. Is calling me a chicken woman who will not dance because they laughed at it 15 years ago. Listen. Yes! Hello. Guys, have seen Claire? Is there.

Will go to Iraq. I can not stop doing that. Not for me. If something comes to pass, I could not forgive. We have to find it. Come on. Come on! - Go to where? - I do not know. But I have to talk to him. Okay, let me think. Perhaps there is something about where Joe should report to your file. We go to the office of Claire. - Work on a Sunday? - No, well we have luck. May I ask what are you doing here? Thank you for coming so fast. I called when I saw in this disaster. So, it seems that someone in here and reviewed all the files, which makes me very badly, because, you know, I am a patient of Dr. McCrae. So, I am enough paranoid itself. - I am going to shoot, right? - I found the file! Your file. Joe, here is your. Thank you. I was in the administration and they called me -- Well, well, well. This man claims to be his patient? This man, in fact it is my patient, and this is my wife ... in charge of catering. I got it from here. Thank you. - Can explain. - I do not want to hear. - Joe will return to Iraq. - But is not ready. So I stopped. There is something here that where reports say? No, nothing, Trevor. It's just saying that paper, in my professional opinion, Joe is ready to go to Iraq. Something that his commander you disagree. So I know their commander. I do not like, but I know him. Get the information on the road. Joe Adams? Meet Joe Adams? No? Sorry. Dude, Where's Joe? - Joe Adams. Joe Adams. - It's in your company? - Joe Adams. Meet Joe Adams? - No. - Someone who is in charge? - Know who Joe Adams? Someone has seen Joe Adams? Joe Adams. It's in your company? Have any idea where is Joe Adams? Joe! Peaches? Are you supposed to be on the plane. Are you supposed to be en route to Winnipeg. Okay, look, there's still time. You can not do this. Not for me. That is, We had two nights together, you can not do this type decision based on that. Look, I managed to hide all my no attractive qualities. That is, collect figurines of children. Tejo costume for my dog. I ... I have seen "High School Musical" as 30 times. I plan to see it 30 more times. I'm going to Iraq, because if I do, means that perhaps can return some day and learn more about the nightmare you are. And if not I can never do that. May need a Southern restaurant in Winnipeg. Come on. You hate the cold. Perhaps I am accustomed. This large family you love so much? I could not ask that the leave, and you did not want. I want to do these 12 months. And get off my head, and for the first time feel that there is some place to go home. I want to go to church with your mom.
