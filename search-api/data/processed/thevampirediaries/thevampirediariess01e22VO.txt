I have lived in secret until now. I know the risk. But I have to know her. Elena... She's a dead ringer for Katherine. - I want the invention. - I don't have it. But Damon does. And you're gonna get it for me. I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she can give it to John who's gonna turn around and kill me. But it'll be useless Bonnie can take the spell off. You took a risk with Damon. How did you know that he was going to give it to me? 'Cause he's in love with you. I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. But when Elena finds out... She's never going to forgive me. Ow. This dress hurts. Suck it in, baby. [Music playing] [Indistinct chattering] Mrs. Lockwood: No, no, no, no. This lineup is all wrong. The marching band should be in front of the historical society. Matt, time to get on your float. Boys, I asked you to put the chair on the founder's float. Ladies, time to get on your float. Look at you, all retro. What are you doing here? Why wouldn't I be here? Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention. Isobel's gone. Heh. And it's Founder's Day. I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl. - Don't start with me, Damon. - Oh, you started it, Stefan, with that whole "I'm insecure, leave Elena alone" speech. I'm just enjoying that. As long as you heard it. Huh? What? [Chuckles] You have no sense of humor, Stefan. Actually, I just have no sens of Damon humor. Damon humor... Hey, look. I get it. I get it. I'm the better, hotter, superior choice, and you're scared now that Katherine's out of the picture that I'm gonna turn all my attention to Elena. But don't worry. Elena is not Katherine. You're right. She's not. Corrected by 4be1 Anna. Look at you. Heh. I know, it's stupid, huh? I'm part of the parade. But how are you? I've been... I've been so worried, and I feel awful. Why? You didn't kill my mother. Your Uncle did. Are you sure it was him? Who else would have done it? He doesn't understand, Anna. It's who he is. He hates all vampires. He's just doing what he thinks is right. Are you defending him? No. No way. It's just... I do understand where he's coming from. He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town, and he's just... He's trying to protect it. They do want revenge. Or, at least, they did. But that's why we separated from them. My mom wasn't after revenge. She just wanted her life back. I have to get out of this town, Jeremy. You're leaving? But I've been thinking. You could come with me. I could turn you. I mean, you said you wanted me to. Here. It's my blood. If you die with it in your system, you'll come back. - Anna... - I know you, what it's like for you... Being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand. But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way. You can shut it off. I can show you how. I wanted to. I did. But I don't think I can. I'm sorry. John? Is... is that even possible? Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager, and he was the one who brought her to your dad's office for the delivery. My who life, I've never liked this man. I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... I wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you in some typically inappropriate way. No, I'm happy that you told me. I just... I really hope that it's not true. What am I supposed to do? Do I just... Confront him and say, "Are you my biological father?" I guess when you're ready. I'm never gonna be ready. Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about. Jeremy hates me, and why wouldn't he? My journal gave him every single reason to. He's just hurt. He's confused. He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki, for taking away his memory, for lying to him. He's your brother. He'll forgive you. Just give him some time. Bonnie: - Say cheese. - Wait. Hide your cast. - It's not era-appropriate. - Seriously? - Yes. [giggles] - Ok. All right. [Shutter clicks] I want one with Bonnie now. Here, I can take it. I'll be on the float. Uhh. I said I was sorry. You made out with his mother, and then you beat him to a pulp. You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry. Elena: Jeremy. Heh. I was wondering where you were. You look great. You guys did a really great job on the float. - Go away, Elena. - Jeremy, come on, please. I don't want it to be like this between us. Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again? Then I can go back to being your in-the-dark little brother. Jerry, please. Just don't. You won't fix this that easily. Something like this doesn't just get fixed. [Crowd cheering] Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls High School marching ban. [band playing] Mrs. Lockwood: And for a little local history, Mr. Saltzman's students have recreated Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escorts. [Cheering intensifies] This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls. Mrs. Lockwood: Aren't they beautiful? What do you want? Just watching the parade. - Where are you going? - Away from you. I want to say something to you. - Just leave me alone. - Thank you. The device that Emily spelled could have killed me. I don't take what you did lightly, so... Thank you. - I did it for Elena. - I know that. But I'm still very grateful. And... I owe you. Enjoy the parade. Mrs. Lockwood: Let's hear it for the Mystic Falls High School football team. All right! Let's show them our support, everybody. This is the key. Once inserted, the device will be activated. It will work only once for an estimated time of 5 minutes. Mayor Lockwood: Yes. How does it work? It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear... Any vampire within a 5-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them. At that time, the sheriff's V5 deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, where we'll finish them off. And you're certain they're attacking tonight? I had a source. One of the vampires from the tomb... He confirmed the attack. Man: Everybody listen up. The plan stays the same. We wait till the fireworks start. Until then, blend in. Stay a part of the celebration. They'll never see us coming. They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864, which makes us their targets. This area here is the stage. This is where the founding families are gonna be. Any questions? We're taking an enormous risk. We're talking about our families, John. Anna. What are you doing here? It's the only way to draw them out and kill them... All of them. I like you better like this. The period look, it... didn't suit you. Is that an insult? Actually, Elena, is a compliment of the highest order. Look, I know Stefan is worried about our friendship. Did he mention something to you, too? No. Did he mention something to you? No. Nothing worth repeating. So, I think you should stop with the flirty little comments and that eye thing that you do. What eye thing? Heh. Don't make me regret being your friend. Ok? I don't believe that we can't fix this. I lied. I was wrong. But you're my brother, Jer, and I love you. And I have to fix it. So, just tell me. What can I do? You can go to hell, Elena. [Music playing] Damon, mockingly: I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them. - Being a teenager is so hard. - You dick. You do not talk to me like that. I'm not your sister. And from now on, don't talk to your sister that way, either. So, what, you're gonna kill me just 'cause I hurt else's feelings? Cut her some slack. She erased my memories. No, I did. She was protecting you. It wasn't her call to make. [Panting] Let go of me before I cause a scene. You'll be unconscious before you even got a word out. Let him go. You all right? Yeah. What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this. Damon turned Vicki. I killed her. She was a threat to you, and she was a threat to your sister. I'm sorry that it happened. I wish that it hadn't. Shouldn't have made me forget. Good cop, bad cop... I like it. - What are you doing? Hmm? - He was being a punk. Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business. - You stay out of it. - Oh, there's only one do-gooder hero role available. Oh, my bad. I'm sorry. Get over yourself. We both know that you're not doing this for the right reasons. See, there you go with that little jealousy act again. Uh, wh... what are the right reasons, Stefan? - Enlighten me. Please. - Well, see, Damon, it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing for nothing in return. - Right. - Yeah. And I know that that is an entirely foreign concept to you. I completely understand how you wouldn't get it. You want to use our town as bait? It's too dangerous. It's insane. We've gone over the plans with your deputies. They're all on board. You've gone behind me? Yeah, because we new that's exactly how you'd react. - Our children are here. - Liz, we need to do this. We have no choice. This is the reason for the secret council. Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose. I'm the sheriff. It's my call. And I say no. Richard, let me speak to the sheriff alone. John, you're not thinking clearly. I'm not gonna change my mind about this. You're still around? Here's something you need to know. The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight. - How do you know this? - I went to them. They think I'm with them, but I'm not. They want the founding families dead. When is this supposed to happen? When the fireworks start. John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them. Wait, then we can't be here. It doesn't work. It's been deactivated. Well, then a lot of people are gonna die. Where are they right now? They're already here, Dan. Remember, we don't know which of them ingest vervain. It's not about the feed. It's about the kill. You know what to do. - Rick. - Yeah. Come here. You keep those nifty little vamp weapons - in the car? - Yeah. Why do you ask? Because this square is crawling with tomb vampires. I think we might need a stake or two. Got it. [Chattering and laughing] - Uh, what are you doing? - Saving your life. 15 words or less... Tomb vamps are here. Founding families are the target. - Get her out of here. Now. - Wait. Wait. Where are you going? That's more than 15 words, Stefan. Wait. Jeremy's out here somewhere. Let's go find him. Come on. [Music playing] There was this time freshman year when Bonnie and I were in a fight. And we swore that we would never talk again. Caroline, give it a rest. Thanks. What are you doing here? I told you to go home. I decided not to. If I tell you to do something, you do it. - Get off me. - Mayor. Is everything ok? Please, Tyler, I need you to go home. Now. Take your friends with you. But why? What's going on? I can't explain. All of you need to get home. Now. Please. Yeah, ok. [Exhales] Here. [Keys jingling] Take my car. It's out back. Come on. Caroline, Matt, go with him. Anna, what are you doing here? My uncle could see you... I don't care about that. I needed to find you. For 150 years, Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home... Safe, prosperous, welcoming. And we have the founders to thank for that. And that's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's fireworks display to their legacy. [Applause and cheering] [Static] Get in position. Enjoy the show! [Fireworks whistling] [crowd cheering] Stay close to me. [Cheering continues] - Excuse me. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. [Door opens and closes] Do you have any idea what you've done? Yes. As a matter of fact, I do. [Clicking] [High-pitched squealing] [Grunting] Aah! - Aah! - Stefan? What's going on? What's happening? - My head. - What? My head. Uhh! Aah! - Aah! - Anna. Anna, what's wrong? - Anna. - [sobbing] Please make it stop. [Squealing continues] What the hell is that? What's the matter? - That noise. - Wait, what noise? - Oh. - Whoa. - Tyler. Tyler! - Aah! - Aah! Aah! Unh! - Dude! Hey! [Tires screeching] Caroline! The wheel! - Tyler! - Uhh! Aah! [Squealing continues] [Grunting] Ow. I got this one. There's one over there. Take this. Go. Go. Go! I don't know what happened. He just dropped. He's not the only one. Cops are grabbing everyone who's gone down, - injecting them with vervain. - What? They're rounding up the vampires. Please help him. Aah! Uhh! My head! [sobbing] Hey, I got one. Hey, what are you doing? What a you doing? Hey! Leave her alone! Hey! [sobbing] What are you doing? Hey! Leave her alone! Hey! Hey! Hey! Anna! Leave her one! Anna! The device is done. The only thing keeping them down is the vervain. We don't have much time. Let's finish this. Anna. [Liquid sloshing] You can head up. I'll take it from here. [Grunting] - Please. - Uhh. Uhh. [Gasps] - Are you ok? - It's like needles were piercing my skull, and then it just stopped. I saw at least 5 vampires go down. They were taking them to your family's old building. It's the Gilbert device. It has to be. But how did he get it to work? Bonnie unspelled it. Maybe she didn't. She did. We saw her do it. No, no, no. He's right. Think about it. We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires. So we could protect you. And Damon. Vampires. Where is Damon? I don't know. I haven't seen him since this started. Can you get my brother? Take him home? - Of course. - Let's go. [Door opens] Liz. Are you ok? - There's a key in... - What is going on? There's a key in my belt. I need you to get it. Uhh. I've been looking everywhere for you. Something's happened to Richard. - They took him. - Who took him? Your deputies. I... I don't understand. He's not a vampire. Let's go. [Grunting and groaning] Mayor. - Is that you? - What are you doing here?! I'm a vampire. What's your excuse? No, really. The vervain didn't affect you. You're not a vampire. What the hell are you? Mayor Lockwood. [Grunts] [Panting] Hey, are you ok? Your side took the biggest hit. - I'm fine. I'm fine. - No, they need - to check you out. - No, I'm fine. I'm fine. They're helping Tyler. - Pulse is steadying. - All right. [Pants] - What the hell? - What? What's wrong? His eyes. [Inhales and pants] - What happened? - Dude, don't scare me like that. Woman: Hey, she needs some help over here. Caroline! - Guys! Over here. - Over there. Hey. Caroline, hey. Wake up. I gonna get you help, wake up, Car. Wait, wait, wait. I can hear them. The building's on fire. Elena: - What? - Building's on fire. [Clattering] Where's Damon? With the rest of them, where he should be. It's over for Damon. - You're crazy. - Why? 'Cause I'm doing what should have been done 145 years ago? This is the right thing, Elena. Go ahead. You won't make it out. It'll save me the trouble of killing you myself. You know the building well. Is there another entrance in? Utility door. There's one around the side. [Grunts] Take one more step, and I'll alert those deputies - that they missed a vampire. - I'm asking you not to. That doesn't mean anything to me. As my father, it should. You know. I wasn't sure. But now I am. Bonnie: Hey! You can't go in there. The fire will take you out. He's my brother, Bonnie. Ahh. [Elena panting] Stefan! Elena! You... you can't go in there. - Bonnie, what are you doing? - I'm sorry I lied to you. [Panting] [Chanting] Bonnie, I've got to get in there. [Continues chanting] [Bonnie chanting] Damon. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on. Come on. [Chanting] [Chants] Bonnie... Bonnie, what is it? Are they gonna be ok? [Panting] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [coughing] [Radio chatter] The fire's out. The story is that the building's old wiring is what caused it. Did you see where Damon went? No, he just kind of disappeared. Figures. [chuckles] Ohh. I'm so glad you're ok. [Exhales] I try so hard... to hate him. I guess it's just pointless. You care about him. So do I. But I love you, Stefan. I know that you're worried about that. I just... You know, I... I know my brother. But I love you, Stefan. I know the trouble he can cause. I love you, Stefan. You. You have nothing to worry about. Ok? [Exhales] So Jenna called. Jeremy's home. I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes the rest of my stuff. And then I'll check on him. What are you doing here? Anna's dead. I figured that once they took her away. I know you cared about her. Yeah, I did. I saw her killed. I was watching and all I could think about was... I wanted to help her. But I couldn't. Why are you telling me all this? I took away your suffering once before. I can do it again. But it's your choice. Look... I know you think you took it away, but it's still there. Even if I can't remember why, I still feel empty. Alone. And making me forget won't fix it. It won't fix what's really wrong. What I did to Vicki was wrong. Sorry for my part. Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain. That they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity. That's very true. Is it easier that way? Is what easier? [Scoffs] Life. Life sucks either way, Jeremy. At least if you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad about it if you don't want to. Is that what you did? I did it for... I did it for a very long time. And life was a lot easier. [Crickets chirping] Hey, man. I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know what happened. It's ok, man. Alright. What's happening? Is she all right? Oh, there was some internal bleeding. We're taking her into surgery. What else did they say? Is she going to be ok? They're going to do everything they can. Tyler, have you talked to your mom? I left her message telling her I was here. You need to call her. What is it? It's your dad. [Exhales] [Indistinct chatter] Oh, hey. - Hey. - You, uh, you just missed Elena. I was looking for you, actually. Oh. Elena is my best friend. And because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire. I'm very grateful, Bonnie. I hope you know that. I do. But I hope you know that things have to change. Damon has to change. We both want the same thing. We both want to protect the people we care about. The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them. You saw what I was able to do tonight. I know who I am now. And if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood, I'll take him down. Even if have to take you with him. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Let's hope it doesn't. What are you doing here? A failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing. Which was... It's not important. I'll take this from you. Thank you. You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it. Tonight I... found myself wanting to protect it. How does that happen? I'm not a hero, Elena. I don't do good. It's not in me. Maybe it is. No. No, it's reserved for my brother and... and you, and Bonnie, even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me. Why do you sou so surprised? Because she did it for you. Which means that somewhere along the way, you decided that I was worth saving. And I wanted to... thank you for that. You're welcome. [Music playing] Hi. It's late. You should probably come inside. [Elena sighs] What are you doing? I don't want to talk about it. [Chuckles] You scared me. Sorry. Ohh. You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager. I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me. She was special. And part of why I hate the vampires so much is because what she became. How it ruined her. And I never would have sent her to Damon. Had I known she wanted to turn. It's my fault. I'm telling you this because I hoped maybe you'd understand. Thank you. Can I help? Sure. [Groaning] [Gasping] Katherine? Hello, John. Good-bye, John. [Groaning] I looked everywhere. Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff. I just gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital. Can you meet me there? Ok. I love you, Stefan. Jeremy?
