i have lived in secret Until now. I know the risk. But i have to know her. The original johnathan gilbert had an invention That was stolen by a vampire. Her name was pearl. I gave your device to damon. Why don't you ask him for it yourself? Mom! Mama! My wife isobel spent her life Researching paranormal activity in this area. What have you done to my wife? I turned her. Why do i look like her? You were adopted. This girl showed up, 16 and about to give birth. What else do you know about her? Just her name--Isobel. Stop looking. She doesn't want to know you. She's alive? Does that mean she's a-- Woman: hello, rick. Isobel. It's good to see you. You look good. I hear that you're a high-School history teacher? How--How is that? Where have you been, isobel? I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you. I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you. I wanted this. It's that simple? Yeah. You were supposed to mourn me and move on. You were my wife. And i loved you. How could i not search for you? Because i wasn't lost, rick. I understand that you know my daughter elena. Oh. And i hear that she's been looking for me. So... I want you to arrange for a meeting with us. You want me... [clears throat] To deliver a message? Heh. Yeah. Screw you... You selfish bitch. What do you want from me? I told you. I'm not gonna do anything for you. You better tell elena that i want to meet, Or i'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one, And i'm gonna start with your history students. Got it? I'm supposed to help build the miss mystic float For the founder's day parade. If i don't, i get the wrath of caroline. But i wanted to check in first. Well, i'm doing great. Thanks for asking. I'm checking on stefan. Oh, him? Oh. He's--He's terrible. What's the matter? He's just back to boring, Strait-Laced, off the junk. You've successfully cured him of Anything that was interesting about his personality. Don't forget who helped me. I hate myself. Hey, did uncle john mention anything to you About my field trip with the history teacher? No, i've still been avoiding him. Why? What's he up to? I don't know. But i'd love it if you could find out for me. I gotta go. I'm late. Have fun with the mystic queen. I know i did. Elena called. These are the specs for the history department's Founder's day float. We're gonna be recreating the battle of willow creek. Tyler's been nominated head of the production design. By who? By me. I've seen your sketches, and they're good. Look, i'm not really into the whole-- Yeah, well, you just pick your team, be creative, and... And don't screw up. Great. You want to help me out with this? Not really, no. Hey, mr. Saltzman. Come with me. We need to talk. Let's reference last year's miss mystic float. This is what they did last year. And it's exactly what we don't want to do. Ew. Yeah. Ok. So, what are we doing? Southern classic elegance. "Gone with the wind"? How did you know? You channel scarlett daily. So true. Yeah. Uhh. Where's elena? She's supposed to be helping. I don't know. Ok, what's the deal? What do you mean? Don't play dumb. You and elena are fighting. Spill. It's nothing. It's not nothing. You know, this whole float Is supposed to be about friends creating something together, And everyone is fighting. Matt and tyler hate each other. You and elena are on the outs. I--I don't like it. And i can't fix it if i don't know what's wrong. I can't talk about it, caroline. I'm sorry. Damon. Thanks for coming. Sorry i'm late. The dog ate my, uh... Never mind. What's all the furrowed brows? I saw isobel last night. Isobel's here? In town? You're late. I didn't realize there was a schedule. What's with the side show? Cherie is a little jazz singer That i picked up in a blues bar in brooklyn. And i got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in amarillo. He's gay? Not right now. He's very good to me. Hey, cherie? [Speaking french] I'm teaching them french. Ooh. I can smell the judgment coming off of you. Well, they're people, isobel, and you're treating them Like they're dolls. If we're gonna be partners, You really have to stop being such a hater. We're in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal. Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle. My lifestyle? So, i assume that you still don't have the invention. I'll get it. I said i would. Uh, you threatened to expose damon salvatore. That didn't work. You killed that pearl lady. Still no invention. I really don't think that your plan is working, john. Well, you being here isn't going to help anything. You failed, john. I'm gonna take it from here. Damon: did you ask about une john? Are they working together? No. No, they're not? No, i didn't ask. What about the invention? Didn't ask. Does she know about the tomb of vampires? I don't know. Did words completely escape you? No, i was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife To ask any questions. What did she want? She wants to see me, damon. Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting. We don't know why or what she wants. You don't have to see her if you don't want to. I don't really have a choice. She's threatened to go on a killing spree. I take it that's... not ok with you guys. I want to do it. I want to meet her. If i don't, i know i'll regret it. Thanks. Can you hear me? Thanks for coming. I'm nervous. But i'm happy that you're here. Love you. Hello, elena. You look just like her. It's eerie. You've met katherine? She found me after i turned. Genetic curiosity, i suppose. She would be fascinated by you. Is that how you can walk in the day? Katherine helped me obtain it. Who's my father? Not important. He was a teenage waste of space. A name would be nice. It would, wouldn't it? You ask a lot of questions. Why did you compel that man to kill himself Right after he told me to stop looking for you? Traumatic impact. Wish it would have been more effective. Human life means that little to you? Means nothing to me. It's just part of being what i am. No. It's not. I know other vampires. That's not true. Your boyfriend over there by the pool table? Stefan salvatore. Why stefan? Why didn't you go for damon? Or do enjoy them both? Like katherine did? we should be in there. No. Isobel made it clear We're not to step foot inside. I'm not gonna kill her in a crowded restaurant. You're not gonna kill her, period. She ruined your life, and you still want to protect her? She's my wife. Was--Was my wife. I looked for the woman i married, but she wasn't there. Whoever that is is... Cold and detached. [Scoffs] yeah. She's given up her humanity. Yeah, see, i don't get that. Stefan has his humanity. He's a good guy. Oh, you're a dick and you kill people, but i still see Something human in you. But with her, there was... There was nothing. You can turn it off... Like a button you can press. I mean, stefan's different. He--He wants the whole human experience. He wants to feel every episode of "how i met your mother," So he shuts his feelings out. The problem is, As a vampire, your instinct is not to feel. Isobel chose the easier road-- No guilt and shame... No regret. I mean, come on. If you could turn it off, wouldn't you? You haven't. Heh. Of course i have, rick. That's why i'm so fun to be around. Elena: why did you want to meet me? It can't be to just catch up. Because i'm curious about you. But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants-- Johnathan gilbert's invention. How do you know my uncle? I used to spend a lot of time here when i was younger. John had a crush on me for years. He was the first one that told me about vampires. So, what made you want to be one? It's a very long list of reasons, elena, All of which i'm sure you've thought about. That was your first lie. It's inevitable. You're gonna get old. Stefan won't. Forever doesn't last very long When you're human. I'm sorry, But i don't have what you're looking for. Sit down. And tell your boyfriend to walk away. I want the invention. I don't have it. I know that. But damon does. And you're gonna get it for me. He's not gonna give it to me. Then the blood will be on your hands. It was nice meeting you, elena. Hey, anna. Uh, where are you? What's up? Uh... Give me a call when you get this. How is anna? I like that girl. She has fire. Uh, i--I don't know. She won't return my calls. Girl trouble? No, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call. That's it. Is it the girl that i saw you with at the founder's pageant? You two are gettin' pretty hot and heavy, huh? When was the last time you saw her? Why? I'm just making conversation. No one else in this house likes me. At least i can talk to you, especially if you need someone to talk to about girls. Ugh. Please. So, seriously, how well do you know anna? I know anna extremely well. Well, know that you can talko me about anything. I'm here to answer any questions that you have. I'll help you in any way i can. Why? 'Cause your dad would want me to. I'm, uh, i'm good. [Music playing] uh-Oh, cherie. You won again. Hope i'm wearing my good underwear. Heh heh. It's just on blast from the past After another. No, no, no. cherie. Damon: it's good to see you, isobel. I was just having fun with your naughty little minion. How'd you find me? Searched all the neighborhood bank-Owned foreclosures And found the most expensive one. Oh, i should have known. You were the one who taught me that. Mm-Hmm. What are you really doing here? Well, you caused quite a stir when you blew into town. Oh. So, everyone except for me you would have hurt. I'm so sorry. Did you bring the device? What are you doing with john gilbert? We dated a few times when we were young. He was a little bit in love with me. I'm sure one of the many. You know, this little invention, what do you want with it? Oh, me personally? I don't want anything with it. I'm just doing what i'm told. You know, damon, we're on the same si.. [Scoffs] oh, yeah? Which side is that? Katherine's. She wants john gilbert to have the device. And i think that you know that she's not happy When she doesn't get what she wants. Why are you doing her dirty work? Don't kill the messenger. We both know that you can't control katherine. She does what she wants. [Scoffs] so do i. Oh, really, damon? You do? What should we do now? Oh, yeah. Resurface. Now that i have your attention, listen up. You do not come into my town, threaten people i care about. Going after elena-- Bad move. You leave her alone, or i will rip you to bits, Because i do believe in killing the messenger. [Whispering] you know why? Because it sends a message. Katherine wants something from me, You tell that little bitch to come get it herself. Hi. Hey. I couldn't sleep last night. You were obviously upset about something, And i just walked away. That's not me. That can't be us. You're my friend, elena. If you need me, i'm here for you. And i'm sorry i couldn't show you that yesterday. I met my birth mother. Oh. Was it... Are you ok? Uhh! Hey, man. Yeah? So, caroline tells me You've been on your own the past 2 weeks. Is everything ok? You're asking me about my mom. Seriously? Look, man, why don't i just have her give you a call when she walks back through town? Dude... That's not what i meant. Ok? I'm just trying to... I don't know what to say. Well, good, man. Don't say anything, 'Cause you're a dick. End of story. I know... Whatever. Bonnie: thanks for meeting me. I wanted you to see this. Is that emily's spell book? I've been going through it since grams died. Check this out. That's the vampire compass. Yeah. According to emily, johnathan gilbert Never actually succeeded in inventing anything. Emily secretly spelled them all with magic-- Compass... Rings... And the mystery device you told me about. Yeah, that's it-- Well, part of it. Damon only has the one piece. Emily pledged her loyalty to katherine. But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed. This was the only way she could think of to help-- To let johnathan gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices. Does it say what it does? Are you sure this is what isobel wants? Yeah, i'm sure. Why? This is a weapon... Against vampires. Elena! Hey. Um... have you seen stefan? I need to find him. No, not lately. Listen. Um, you have a second? Uh, yeah. What's up? What's going on? Well, it's anna. I left her all these messages, And she hasn't gotten back to me-- Not even a text. Anna? I didn't know that you guys were still friends. We're more than friends. Look, something could be seriously wrong. And if you know anything, you gotta tell me. I haven't talked to her, jer. Are you lying to me right now? Why would you say that? 'Cause that's what you do, elena. You lie. You lie about everything. I know what anna is. And i know that you know. So, tell me. Do you have any idea where she is? No. But jer... Jeremy. Wait. Jeremy! Isobel. What are you doing here? I'm your mother, elena. I want to be more involved in your life. I don't want you in my life. I understand that. You already have a lot of people that you care about. But i've been studying. Let's see if i got this right. There is the witchy st friend bonnie. Gonna stay away from that one. Oh... Sad little brother jeremy. And there's caroline-- Obnoxious caroline. I got all of my info from her, by the way. She had no idea who i was, and she wouldn't stop yapping. Oh. There's matt-- Friend, ex, yappy's future ex. Lots of connections there. Matt's not involved with us. He's involved with you. Isn't he? Look, you shouldn't be here. You need to leave. No. I have some friends here, too. Look. See that man over there standing next to matt by the float? His name's frank. He's very handsome. And he's also very handy. And he noticed that the axle was kind of rusted, Which is very dangerous. So, all you have to do Is apply a little bit of pressure, and-- No! Aah! Uhh! Boy: hey, get this trailer up! Come on, guys, lift it up, please! Give me a hand! Uhh! Aah! Come on, lift. Oh! Come on! Aah! Call for help. Caroline: ok. Why are you doing this? I'm showing you how easy it is To hurt the people that you care about. You're doing this just because of Johnathan gilbert's invention? Hand it over and the fun will stop. I told you, damon's not gonna give it to me. And i think that you underestimate how much damon cares about you. He'll kill you before he gives it up. Is that before or after i kill your brother jeremy? Elena: jeremy? Jeremy! The ambulance is saying 15-20 minutes. I have my car. I can take him to the hospital. Caroline can take me. I didn't drive. Then i'll wait. It's fine. You will not wait! Ok, you need to see a doctor. Tyler's driving. End of story. Go! I'll bring my car around. I see you're packing. That's a good sign. Won't be long now. Did you get the missing piece? Where is it? I don't have it yet. Then why did you call me here? 'Cause i have the next best thing. What the hell are you doing? Getting what i want. Yeah, but he's my nephew. And you're gonna let him go right this second. The gaudy ring on your finger-- It comes off. Come on. Come on, isobel. I--I know you. Ok? It's me, john. You can't hurt a kid. I'll kill him to prove you wrong. Really? Are you that far gone? Look, i know you've changed. Ok? But the old isobel is in there somewhere still. Isn't she? Come on. Let him go. Ok. Ok. Isobel: nice try. We'll see how you do without this. Where's the device? Damon has it. He's gonna be difficult to reason with. Then we'll--We'll go go him. I'll talk to him. He's not just gonna hand it ov, , pecially if it's harmful to vampires. What if it's not? Damon: absolutely not. Just hear me out. I'm not gonna give the device To isobel so she can give it to john who's gonna turn around and kill me. I like being a living dead person. But it'll be useless. Bonnie can take its power away. I don't trust her. I can remove the original spell. John and isobel will never know. No. No, i'll get jeremy my own way. Mm-Hmm. Stefan: really? How are you gonna do that? H? Because isobel is a vampire, And jeremy can be dead the second you walk in the door. Are you even up for this? I mean, no offense. You're no emily bennett. Emily knew what she was doing. I've been practicing. It's not piano lessons, honey. What's your favorite book? What? Name a book, Any book. Name a book. How about... "Call of the wild," jack london? Jack london. Great parlor trick. Elena: we're doing this, damon. And we're gonna do it my way. Now, give me the device. We're wasting time. I don't trust you. I tried to kill you. Hmm. You're right. You can't trust me. But you can trust me. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. What is she after? Your ancestor invented a weapon-- A device that's extremely harmful to vampires. We've been trying to get it. Why? 'Cause there's a group of vampires from a long time ago That wants revenge on this town. But why-- Why would a vampire help you kill other vampires? She has her own reasons for wanting them dead. Look, jeremy, No one ever thought vampires would return to this town-- Not in modern times. But they have. And we have to destroy them. All of them? No--There are some good ones out there. There's no such thing. I don't believe that. Well, your dad did. And as his son, that should mean something to you. How did my father know about all this? Who do you think taught me about the family history? Done. Damon: great. Now what? Now we give it to isobel. [Bell ringing] Where's the device? Where's my brother? This isn't a negotiation. Where's the invention? Where is my brother? Do you really think that i came alone? Do you really think that i came alone? For god sakes, call home. What? Call home, ask to speak to your brother jeremy. Hello? Jeremy. Are you ok? Yeah, yeah, i'm fine. Uncle john, uh, hit his head. It was an accident. And we're all laughing. [Chuckles] Yeah, but, um, i'm ok. I'll be home soon, all right? Yeah. You were never going to hurt him. No. I was going to kill him. Don't look for any redeeming qualities in me. I don't have any. But you took a risk with damon. How did you know that he was going to give it to me? 'Cause he's in love with you. Thank you. For what? For being such a monumental disappointment. It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact. Good-Bye, elena. As long as you have a salvatore on each arm, You're doomed. Katherine was smart. She got out. But we all know that you're not katherine. Sorry. Hey, it's anna. Leave a message. Jeremy, we have to talk about this. No, we really don't. I don't know what anna told you, But there are things that you need to know. Yeah? Because... I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it. You read my journal? And save me the speech about invasion of privacy, Because i read a section about damon erasing my memory, About what happened to vicki. Jeremy, please, you don't understand. The night that vicki died, It was like mom and dad died all over again. It was all over your face. And it hurt so much to see you like that. I just wanted to take away your pain, I'm so sorry. Just get out. No, jeremy-- Elena! Just get out. Please. Jer, i-- What do you want? I totally get it. You here as a history teacher. It's good. What the hell are you doing? You act like you don't care, And yet here you are hunting me down. I'm leaving. I just thought i'd say good-Bye. Well, you couldn't be bothered the first time, So why now? You hate me, good. Does that make it easier for you? I mean, what is the whole point of this exercise? What did you expect? You spent alalalisyingngngngngn, What did you think you would find? The woman who gave me this... I mean, you act like you don't care. But you cared enough to protect me after you left. I was a different person back then. Coffs] right, right, right. And that person is gone. The woman i married, the woman i loved, she's just--She's gone. You expect me to believe that? What are you doing? Well, i'm ring-Free. I'm vervain-Free, So either kill me or compel me, Because... I don't believe it. Not for a second. [Grunts] i wanted this. I needed this. And i'm going to regret it forever. This was my mistake. Not yours. You are not going to remember this. When you think of our marriage, You are going to have such fond And beautiful memories. But that's in the past now, And your heart's free of me. It's better this way. Good-Bye, rick. Anna? Hey, what are you doing here? My mother. She's dead. What? She was killed. Oh, my god, anna... Hey. Hey, i'm so sorry. I know i'm not supposed to be here, But i don't have anywhere else to go. Hey, it's ok. Would you like one? Ahem. Say it. Whatever it is, purge, get it out. It's about what isobel said. What about it? Well, i know that you and elena bonded, And i know that she cares about you, and, uh, I know you care about her. Well, this is going in an interesting direction. I'm just concerned about elena being hurt. She considers you a friend. Same here. Elena's a very good friend. Actually, she might qualify as my only friend. Is that a problem? So, at the risk of sounding like a, um, Like a jealous boyfriend-- Oh, there's no risk. You do. History will not be repeating itself Where elena's concerned. Do you understand what i'm saying? Sure. Do you... understand? Hey, whatever you say, man. I mean, honestly, we're just friends. And as her friend, i wasn't looking forward To telling her the truth, anyway. So, i'll let you do it. What truth? About john. 'Cause i know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other. What are you talking about? Am i the only one around here Who has the ability to put two and two together? Isobel. Hello? She dated john when she was 15. She gets pregnant, and ends up At the doctor's office of john's brother. Now, what do you think is john's role is in all of this, huh? I mean, go ahead, think about it. I'll wait. You get it? You there yet? Hmm? So, you think that john Is elena's father? Ding ding ding! [Scoffs] What proof do you have? I don't need any proof. I have the dna tests For john, elena, and [indistinct]. But i know how well you deal with these big bombshells, so... Sleep tight. Oh, and when you do tell elena, And she needs a friend to talk to about anything... I'm here for her. Hello? On your doorstep, You'll find what you've been looking for. And my ring? Don't screw this up. I got it. I won't fail. You better not. Katherine wants All of those tomb vampires dead. And i want to add two more to that list. Let me guess. Stefan and damon. I don't want this life for her. Well, it was always a part of the plan. Consider them gone. She's our daughter, john. We owe that to her. I know. So you're not going to tell me what happened? I did something bad, caroline. And i lied about it. To who? To elena. I pretended to do something I didn't really do. What are you talking about? I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. Grams would have never done it, So i couldn't, either. But when elena
