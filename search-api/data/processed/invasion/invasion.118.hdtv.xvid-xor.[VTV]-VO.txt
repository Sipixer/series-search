I saw a bunch of lights in the sky last night. Can you keep a secret, honey? I saw them, too. I don't remember what happened that night. My dad took your mom to the water so she wouldn't feel alone. He did this to her on purpose? My mother didn't have to be this way. I guess people are acting strange. A lot of guys didn't hang out with each other last year. I think he knows a lot more than he's letting on. I'm gonna find out why the air force is down here, and if there's a cover-up, who's involved. Now you can help me get the story, or you can be the story. It's your choice. According to my contact, they were after a missing weather plane. Then what's going on over there? Dave thinks aliens have invaded our town. These creatures take people's D.N.A. To create a new being, like a hybrid. - I am not an alien! - Then what are you? What's going on? Looks like you're having a litter. There's something really not right with the guy. I hope you never get shot, lewis, but if it should happen, be glad you're in the body you got right now. It's a hell of an upgrade. - Why would you wanna kill me? - You misled us all, Tom. I'm gonna send you to a mr. Szura. He runs a little camp down in the keys for the people just like you who have lost their way. A few haven't been behaving themselves. What are you doing?! But they're not around anymore. I'll do anything to protect my family. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm gonna find out what's going on. There's really nothing to worry about. Everything's under control. Invasion 1x18 - Re-evolution Transcript : RaceMan Sous-titrage : -Ez-, Keno83, RonanaSplit, Lucile76. I'm telling you, Russ, this is a bad idea. We shouldn't be here. Trying to find Szura on our own is crazy. We should go back home, get some help. Szura could be gone by then. Yeah... but our radio's jammed, Russ. Our cell phones aren't working. How we gonna call the cavalry if- Look, he murdered two people last night, Dave. - Did you not see that? - Of course I did. I also saw a lot of other people backing him up. Look, if you wanna go back and call for some help, go. Take the boat. I'll find him on my own. No, man. What is the matter with you, man? You got a death wish all of a sudden? I'm not going back until I've got some answers. And if you find Szura, what are you gonna do then, huh? Huh? You gonna kill him? What are you gonna do then? That's up to him. Hey, what if he's got this whole island booby-trapped? Well, I guess we'll find out. I'm telling you, we need to find a working radio... so we can at least contact someone just in case we're- In case we're dead? No. What the hell was that? It sounded like some kind of signal call. Oh, great. "The humans are here." Aw, man. It's them. What the hell happened to her? - She was pregnant. - Oh, I know... but what came out? I'm not saying I won't do it, val. I'm just saying there might be more interesting stories to cover. People already know that their lights are on, val. I don't know if that's necessarily news. All right. Yeah, I'm about ten minutes from the plant right now. Okay, bye. Are you okay? You came out so fast, I didn't see you. You need a doctor. You can take a shower now, Jess. I'm done. Thanks, Rose. What are you doing? I promised Larkin I'd help you get ready for school. So what do you want to wear? I said I can handle it, Rose. I don't mind. Did dad come home last night? Nah. Larkin said he's still working, so mr. Elmore is going to take us to school today. So... basically we have no parents now, is that right? That's, uh... that's the gun Tom gave me. Have you shot it yet? No. Why did daddy Tom give it to you? Maybe he wants to see if I know how to use it. She's waiting in your office, sir. - Did she say what this was about? - No. - Tom. - Sabrina. - It's good to see you. - You, too. I heard about your shooting. You look reMarkable. Good genes. But what can we do for you today? Well, this is kind of awkward. I'd like to keep this between us. Always. We had a psych patient go A.W.O.L. This morning. He's a young helicopter pilot, just back from a long tour in Iraq. We're hoping you can help us find him before the media gets ahold of this. Do you have any idea where he's headed? No, but we think someone may have picked him up. A couple of our people reported seeing an old green bronco near the west gate. An old green bronco? - Where are we going? - To the hospital. No. - Your leg is in really bad shape. - Well, it doesn't matter. Look, why don't you just let me off right here? No, I won't. Well, I am not going to a hospital. You understand? Okay. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Just right over to the table. Okay. Here. I'm just gonna go get the first aid kit, okay? William? Are you all right? May I have a glass of water, please? Sure. You think Underlay knows about this- that Szura's got his own little hybrid island here? Of course he knows. I'm sure he sent him half the people we saw on the beach last night. Yeah, but why? What are they doing? What's the big plan? That's what we're gonna find out. What is that, barracks? Looks like an old military base. Well, where there's a satellite dish, there may be a phone. I guess I missed "robin hood and the cambrian explosion" on amazon. It's the exact same layout across the hall. It's like japanese modern meets the bay of pigs. It's bizarre. Hey, Russ. Look at this. No phone. No internet either. This is a downlink station, Russ- only receives data. Russ, come here. Looks like they're pirating images off a satellite grid. West africa... brazil... cuba. You name it. Look at the water. They're monitoring temperature. These are different gradations in the atlantic currents. Why do they care about water temperature? Maybe they care about what's in the water. Let me know if this is too hot, okay? You're already healing. You've gone through some changes lately, haven't you? I was a lieutenant in the air force... 53rd weather recon. You're a hurricane hunter? My crew was, uh... stationed out of biloxi. We tracked storms, mostly in the gulf. We were sent into the eye of hurricane eve. You were on that plane that went down. Yes, ma'am. hold on to your hats, folks! We're going inside! All right, let's cut her open! drop the sonde and get us a reading. c- level pressure's at 9-3-6 kilowatts. What is going on down there? She's changed course. No, no, no. I'm seeing something else, something bigger- under the water. My screen's going nuts. I got lights- thousands of lights! Military? No! He's-he'S... oh, my god. I have to go. Why? What's wrong? Please, I want to help you. Did they send you? Do you hit me on purpose to see what would happen? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie to me! 'Cause I'm sick of being lied to. We won't lie to you, William. He's a psych patient. He took off this morning. The air force asked me to try to round him up. They mentioned an old green bronco, so I called your boss at work to see if you'd shown up, but... did they ask you to keep this quiet? Why? Because he told me a very different story. I think you should hear it. William? This is sheriff Underlay. Would you mind telling him what you told me? Hi. You weren't in Iraq, were you, son? Willie! What are they doing here? I called them. Hey, look, guys, there may have been a mistake. I'm not sure this is your man. Oh, he's our man, sir. Our colonel will be very grateful. Jesse? Hey. How you feeling? Okay. Better. That's good. Yeah, I never thought I'd say it, but I'm actually kind of psyched to be back at school. Brace yourself. What do you mean? It's just a whole different place. Nothing is like it was. Hey, man. Did you sleep in your car? You did? My dad kicked me out last night. I left a bowl of soup on the table, and he told me to hit it. - That's insane. - Yeah. His dad's got a little... "hurricane damage." Yeah, my brother, too. They both came back after the storm and were like, "hey... what do we need our family for?" I'm just afraid they're gonna toss my mom out on the street next. Better than tossing her in the water. That's what Kira's dad did to my mother. Right, Kir? He didn't do it on purpose. It just... happened. Right, it just... Tom just happened to take my mom to the water in the middle of a category three hurricane- Yeah, just stop it, Jesse. All right? Stop it. See you around, brett. Sorry. "survival"- an elemental word, yet it means different things to different people. To some, it may imply mere existence. To others, superiority. To some, peace. Others, war. But to us, it just means the future. We've all been changed for a reason- a reason that will become clear to us in the coming days. But for now, it is incumbent that we maintain our unified community, that we believe... well, at least now we know where everyone is. When'd they get an infomercial? And as mr. Szura writes in his book, there is nothing more empowering than taking control of your destiny... A book? We were able to adapt... you think she's talking about that, um, robin hood cambrian thing? The cambrian explosion was a time of massive evolutionary change on the planet. I mean, virtually overnight, all kinds of new life appeared. what, do you think that's what's going on here? You don't have to be an alien to wipe out a species, Dave. Humans are pretty good at it, too. We are all here because we were able to adapt... so these hybrids're... they're just another invasive species? Like the rabbits taking over australia? Melaleuca trees in the glades? That would be the best case scenario. What's the worst case? That they're actually our next evolutionary upgrade. Like we're neanderthals... and they're us? Maybe we should ask the priest. Sheriff Tom Underlay. I'm here to see colonel Lopez. She expecting you, sheriff? No. Well, I'm sorry, sir, - but without the prior clearance- - Get the clearance. I'll wait. Right down the middle. Do it again. - that was short. - That was short, though. - There we go. - Try again. And another score. - All right. - All right. Cool. Okay, the kick is up... Sweet! Extra point for the head shot. Man, I'm sorry, dude. You know, maybe you guys should play somewhere else. I'm sorry. Are we bothering you? 'Cause last time I checked, this was a public place. But if you've got a problem, maybe you should get out of here. Why don't you just take it outside? Damn it, that's my report. Why don't you clean that up, man? What did you say? You knocked over the man's drink. Why don't you clean it up? Oh, look at this. - Do you wanna go? - Come on, bring it, freak. That's enough, guys. You can either all sit down in here, or you can sit with the principal. It's okay, miss Currie. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I'm sure you can all work this out. Now... who wants to go? You scream, and I'll cut your throat. Russell. - Where's Szura? - I don't know. Yes, you do. Come on, get up. You're gonna take us to him. "For as long as we're the minority, "people will want to persecute us. "So we must live apart until our numbers are large enough to make a stand." What "stand" is your leader talking about, huh? He's not my leader. So you're not one of his little merry men? What's with this whole robin hood thing anyway? Is he planning some kind of big "steal from the rich, give back to the poor" raid or something? I have no idea. How did you get here? - The sheriff sent me. - why? Because I shot him. You shot Underlay? How about that? A fallen priest. - Why did you do it? - Because he misled me. I really believed that god saved my life the night of the hurricane. But now I know differently. And Tom knew all along. So what do you think saved you? Evil. I don't think he's gonna like your theory much better. You wanted your man, I got him for you. But I'm confused about a couple things- When did he get back from Iraq? A few months ago. Why? Well, you've got such a small hospital here, I figured, you know, you'd send him to the V.A. In miami. Is this what you came here to discuss, sheriff? Major. Excuse me? Well, if you're gonna make this formal, I retired as a major, colonel. I did a little research on the way out here. Lieutenant William Blount was a sonde operator for a c-130 weather plane out of biloxi. That plane disappeared during the hurricane, and you yourself told me that you sent a search and rescue team to look for them, which was also lost. Three crewmen died. Yeah, and a fourth managed to find his way to a ranger station in the glades, half bleeding to death because he was attacked by something in the water. His name was Paxton, and when I told you that he was at homestead hospital, you asked to help get him back to you, which I did. - What happened to that man, colonel? - That's classified. You also told me that you were worried about bad publicity then, too. But I don't think you need to worry about the press anymore. I think you should be far more concerned about me. How many more crew members from that weather plane do you have locked in this place? All of them. If we move a couple of ICU nurses into ER, we should be covered for tonight. I'll see who's on call. Hey, Kira. Why aren't you in school? It's lunch. Got a sec? - What's up? - I'm worried about Jesse. I saw him this morning. Has he said anything to you? About what? I told him about how dad took you to the water the night of the hurricane. He's pretty upset about it. He thinks that dad did it on purpose... to make you, you know, like him. When did you tell him this? Yesterday. I thought he already knew. I was actually trying to make him feel better. I'll talk to him. Can you do it soon? 'Cause things are really weird at school right now. Kids I hardly know are coming up to me and asking me which side I'm on. "Which side"? Yeah. I'm just worried that Jesse's in such a bad place right now, that whatever side he chooses is gonna be the wrong one. That's Szura's tent, but he may not be here. He comes and goes to the mainland a lot. There's no guards. No vehicles either. There still may be a phone, though. I don't care about a phone, Dave. I want Szura, and I want him now. Just follow me and be quiet. I don't think he's here. He's got Underlay's whole life in here. The guy's a big fan. Oh, wow. It's a war room. He's got maps of every county in florida. Has Szura told you what he and Underlay ultimately hope to achieve here? No. How many people are on the island? I don't know. A hundred? What does he think he's gonna do with a hundred people? I think evolution might be a little too slow for this guy, Russ. I think Szura might be planning a little cambrian explosion of his own. What are you talking about? Russell believes that what's happened to you, what's happened to all these people, may be some kind of radical evolution. I'm sure you have some quibble with that, but... I... I never even considered it. Well, I'm not surprised. Oh, no, no. I... I'm not one of those people who believe that god and evolution are mutually exclusive. Like everything else in the universe, I believe that evolution was part of god's plan. But... could it really be possible? At this point, I wouldn't rule out anything. Hey, Russ. It's a phone. It's a sat phone. Look, if we call in the troops, there's no going back. The world's gonna know about everything that's happening in our town. Mariel, Underlay... you... we're gonna have news crews as far as china tearing our community apart. And my kids... they may lose their mother for good. We don't have a choice, Russ. He's killed too many people. Make the call. Come on. He could back here any second. You don't really wanna face off alone with him. Yes, islamorada station? Yeah, this is florida parks ranger Russell Varon. I need immediate coast guard assistance. Well, thank you, miss Hundeen. And again, I'm so sorry about all this. It's all right. We've all been under a lot of stress lately. The transition's been tough on everyone. But we're gonna move on now. Right, Jesse? What about the other kids? Scott and greg- aren't you gonna talk to them, too? Of course. But from what I understand, they didn't initiate this. That's not true. So not fair. Why did this happen? Because they're hybrid bastards, mom. And it wasn't our fault. What were they doing? Acting... like they were better than us, which, well, I guess is true. Right, mom? I mean, isn't that why Tom made you one? Tom didn't make me anything. Oh. Right, I forgot. You're on the other side now, so... how am I ever gonna get a serious answer from you? Hey, Jesse! Come here. - I am on your side. - No, you're not. You're not even my mother. Your husband killed you. So do me a favor. Okay, Mariel? Do me a favor and-and-and stop pretending that anything's ever gonna be the way it was again. Because it can't be. You're not my mother. You may find what I'm about to show you disturbing. But I promise, we're all patriots here. I've seen those boxes before at the site of your downed... chopper. Would you like to know what's in them? Sergeant, could you bring one down to the lab for us, please? Did you know those two kids that Szura shot? Not really. The young woman was pregnant. Why would he kill a pregnant woman? If his goal is to build a majority, wouldn't he want all the people here having babies? Yeah. That might not be on his timetable right now. Or Underlay's. It's hard to lead an army while you're pushing a baby carriage. Hey, they're here. Why are there two boats? Who's that guy in the little one? Szura. How long has this operation been running? Since '96. That's the same year your plane crashed, isn't it? So you've been aware of these changes in people since '96? Well, not at this level. It's grown over time. With each new hurricane, we've learned more. But when we found the crew from this weather plane and discovered that they were all still alive... well, you can imagine how excited we were. Oh, my god. What are you doing with them? Testing them. And they've been incredible. They've shown reMarkable resiliency. Like you, after the shooting. They really are amazing creatures. They aren't "creatures." I'm sorry, Tom. I meant no disrespect. A lot of our funding has gone into testing, but even more has gone into cleanup. In order to keep a project of this size under wraps, we've had to cover a lot of ground. And... as I guess you know, each new being leaves a rather large footprint. Thank you, sergeant. It's a lot to comprehend, isn't it? So you knew about me since '96? No, we just found out recently. I've always considered you a loyal partner, Tom. But you have to understand why certain factions wouldn't want to bring you into this. What factions? Just know that everything that is happening here is in the best interest of the american people and your community. I am my community. What factions are you talking about? The ones that would have you in here, if you push this. - You mr. Varon? - Yeah. We got your call. What are you doing with him? We picked mr. Dennison up on the other side of the island. "Dennison"? Murder's a pretty serious charge, sir. And if one of his people has committed a crime- He committed the crime. His name's not Dennison. It's Szura. I'm afraid you're wrong about that, sir. Mr. Dennison runs a relief center here for the victims of the recent storm. Were you a victim of the recent storm, lieutenant? Where are these bodies you called in about? They were right here. They were right here! You know, ranger, I think the best thing you can do right now is to go home, take care of your family and just let the people who know what's best for the community do their jobs. What community is that? What community? The community that supports the killing of innocent people? The community that would take a mother away from her own children? That community? A community like him? Are you like him, or are you just on his payroll? Because either way, you're no better than he is. Will you be needing an escort, mr. Varon? Why don't you let him come with us? It's all right, Russell. Whatever happens, it's all right. So, father... perhaps you'd like to stop by my house for a little confessional. Mrs. Wade says you're doing very well in spelling. - Yeah. - Yeah? And I got all my words right. All your words? The hardest one is "united states," because it's actually two words. That's great, Rose. I bet your dad is gonna be so proud of you. What was that? Rosie, I want you to go inside and wait for me, okay? And I will be right there. Jesse? What are you doing? Shooting. I'm not too good, but... Where did you get that gun? Daddy Tom. Tom gave you that? Yeah. Wasn't he thoughtful? You've been in a fight. And you've been drinking. What are you shooting at? These are pictures of your family. Not my family. Jesse! No. You're more my family than they're my family. And you're not even my family. You're just my dad's wife. Give me the gun. No way. Now! I'm sorry.
