Our people will be fine. It's the rest of the town you should be concerned with. I know a lot more than you think I do. There is blood on the wall of that cell. I want to know how he got out. I would wait for you forever. - What's going on? - It looks like you're having a litter. - Russell! - You one of 'em? - What's goin' on here, Frank? - Go ahead and look! But I don't want to leave. This man may be coming after our family. Where's he hiding them? You and your family- all dead. We're not goin' with you. We're goin' back. What are we supposed to tell the kids? Tell 'em we love 'em. That's why we're doing this. Let me out, now! Invasion 1x21- Round up Transcript RaceMan Adaptation -Ez-, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 Tighten up your life jackets, ladies and gents, because we are going storm chasing. As we speak, hurricane Miranda is just two hours away from making landfall here. And if history repeats itself, she won't be coming in alone. During hurricane Eve, thousands of lights landed in the wat- jeez! This time, if the invaders come again, I'm gonna be there with this camera, catching the whole thing on tape. That way, nobody can deny the existence of extraterrestrials or the fact that they're in this town, because all the proof they need is gonna be right here on the screen. Hello? Dave, you get everything boarded up? Yeah. If the roof holds, I think everything should be okay.</i> You get everyone out of town? Yeah, the family's headed north. We're on our way back down to the sound to see if we can round up Szura's hybrids. Round 'em up? Round 'em up how? I don't know. But if they're primed for some kind of insurrection- then we'll kill 'em. You hear that? Yeah. Sounds like a great plan. Listen, stay close to the phone. We may need your help. Okay. Hey, Russ, be careful, all right? You, too. Thanks. - How many were out there? - At least a hundred. Maybe more. And they were just... - sitting underwater? - Standing underwater. Like an army. since initial reports had the storm landing in west palm beach...</i> Not my initial report. So many people in a panic, and many of them at this hour still trying to find...</i> You did everything you could, Larkin. You told everyone it was coming to Homestead. Yeah. How much longer to the motel, mom? I'm guessing at least another hour. Shouldn't we be on the main road by now? I think this is the main road. - None of the phones are working. - The towers must be down. I wanna call Lewis. I wanna see how he's doing. I'm sure he's fine, honey. The hospital's probably the safest place he could be right now. Yeah, I'd be much more worried about dad and Tom than I would Lewis. Lewis will be fine. He's not gonna hunt down the aliens. Mariel, look out! Oh, my god... You okay? Is everybody okay? - Mommy? - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Yeah, I think so. Rose, you okay? Uh, yeah. We're all right. - Maybe we can move it. - Well, you're not gonna move it. Um, Kira, Jesse? Let's see what we can do with this. Lewis. Oh... hey, guys. What's up? How you feeling? All right. Little concerned about the storm, I guess. What's wrong? You have any idea where the sheriff is tonight? Yeah, he took his family out of town. He's back. Sanchez called and said he came through the blockade on highway 1 about an hour ago. Did you try him on the radio? We think he killed deputy Munger, Lewis. We found Munger's body handcuffed in the passenger seat of his own car. Someone drove it off into a flatbed. He was decapitated. My god. Underlay was the last person with him. But the sheriff could never have done something like that. I mean, he couldn't! We think Munger was killed because he was different, Lewis. Different like you. And like me and Troy here. The sheriff is different, too. Yeah, but he seems to have forgotten that his job is to protect his people. We think he may have fallen in with some folks who don't want us around anymore... maybe some of the same folks who put you in this hospital. I don't believe you. The sheriff has always wanted everybody to live and work together! Then where is he? On a night like this, when his people and his town need him the most- Where is he? His time has passed, Lewis. It's time for us now. And it's time for you to decide which side you're on. Will you help us find him? I- I don't-I really have no idea where he is. Well, then maybe you know someone who does. Stupid freaking door. First aid kit. Come on, first aid kit. I'm bleeding to death here. - Is this the place? - Yeah. Who's that? Vargas-the guy I was telling you about. He was here earlier. I think he's working for Szura. What's he doing? Standing guard, I imagine. Stupid bastard. Let's go. Looks like someone else has been here, too. Hey. Hey, Vargas... Was he a friend of yours? No. So this is where you saw all these people in the water? Right here? Yeah, but I can't see anything now. I can't tell if they're still in there. They're not. They're gone. They're gone. Russ. It's their clothes. Why would they leave all their clothes? Let's go back in the truck. Why would these people be running around without clothes? I'm afraid they may have changed into uniforms. - Uniforms? - Military uniforms. Szura was supposed to be training these people to reenter society. As soldiers? The reasoning was that during the next hurricane, if some of the national guard were actually hybrids themselves, that it might make the transition easier for the new people. Well, you didn't... arm them, did you? Oh, no. I trusted the man, Russell. And in the beginning, he... he didn't give me any reason not to. Is there anything else that you'd like to share with me? Tt's no use, mom. It's not gonna move. We just have to all do it together. We've tried. It's not working! Hey! Hey! Hey! Larkin! - You folks all right? - We got stuck. I don't think we're gonna get out tonight. Can you give us a lift? Pretty crowded back there, but I think we can make some room. Great. You guys get on the truck. Come on. They're gonna give us a ride. - What about Carlita? - We'll take her. Come on. Come, honey. Come on, Rose. Come on. It's okay. Watch your step. You better hurry, ma'am. Mr. Szura, we've got another load coming. - Hey! - Mr. Groves, I'm Lewis Sirk. - I'm sheriff underlay's deputy- - deputy, yeah. Yeah, I know. Come in, come in. Come in, come in. I thought you were in the hospital. Yeah, I, uh, got better. This is deputy Buell and deputy Armis. I'd shake your hand, but I'm bleeding here. Mr. Groves... Dave. Dave, do you happen to know where the sheriff is tonight? Yeah, uh... he and, uh, Russell took everyone up to, um... uh... why? Why do you ask? Some of our emergency management folks need to talk to him. Don't you guys have radios? He's out of range. Well, I'll tell you what. If I hear from him, I'll let you know, okay? When do you expect to be hearing from him? I don't know, really. Maybe I won't. I don't know. You say he's with your brother-in-law? Yeah. Yeah, they went together. What are they doing? You know, I don't know what this is about. What are we talking about? How'd you hurt your hand? I cut it. Uh, I cut it on a door. You mind if I take a look? I used to work in an emergency room. Oh, boy, that doesn't look good. Where is he? Where is underlay? - Troy! Troy! - Stop! Stop! Please! I don't know! Damn it, man, what the hell is wrong with you?! Troy, I think mr. Groves is telling the truth. Oh, you think so? You think I'm telling the truth? So I think... that we're all gonna just wait right here until the sheriff or this brother-in-law decides to make contact. Does that work for you, mr. Groves? I don't think we're going in the right direction. I think we're headed back towards homestead. How far is it to the shelter? Not sure on that, ma'am. Well, can I at least borrow your radio? Call my husband, tell him we're all okay? This only operates on a special frequency. Won't be of any use to you. What's wrong with him? He's a hybrid. And he knows I'm one, too. Our best bet is to call all the different agencies- police, fire, emergency management- let them know what we're really facing. Won't make a difference tonight. Everyone thought the storm was going north, and that's where they are. They won't be able to get anyone down here, because in an hour's time, there won't be a road safe enough to travel on. Well, Szura's traveling. You see the size of those tire treads back at the sound? Yeah. Probably got the military to give him some trucks. Why would they do that? Don't they realize as soon as he's strong enough, he's gonna come after them, too? No, I don't think they do. We should go to your station and pick up a scanner. If he's running a bunch of trucks, he's gotta be in contact with them. How about picking up a truck instead? What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm sheriff underlay. This is... deputy varon. We had a report of some hazardous materials being transported out of town- mind if I take a look? Look, I'm late for a pickup. We're running hurricane evac. There's nothing here, Russ. - Where you headed? - Trailer park just north of here. We're gonna try and get those folks to the high school before this thing really comes down. Which high school's that? Which high school is that, soldier? - The local one. - Which local one? That shot was pretty close to me. His would have been closer. Come on. - Was he a hybrid? - Yeah. Grab his radio and see if we can find out where he was going. How come he didn't recognize you? I didn't send everyone to that island, Russell. Szura's gathered a lot of people on his own. Dispatch? I'm a little lost. You coming in or out? In. All right, you got a full load?</i> Yeah, we're full. Okay, then you just wanna get on 144 going east,</i> and take her all the way out to the water.</i> To the water? Yeah, toward turkey point. We'll see you soon. Roger that. We need help with unloading.</i> Okay, everybody out. Watch your step, sir. There you go. Right this way, please. Ma'am, there we go. Right this way. Thank you, sir. That line, please. Thank you. - Where are we, mommy? - I don't know. - What is this place? - It's a shelter. Here you go, miss. Right this way, please. Right this way. There you go. Right in this line right here. Just get in this line right here. No, it's okay- it's all right. Thank you. Here you go. - Not you. - What? - You're going someplace else. - No, I'm not. - You're going in this other line. - Mom? - Get out of my way. - Hey, let go of her! - Get out of my way! - Let me go! Let me go! - Mommy? - Let her go! Jesse! Jesse! - Mommy! - Rosie! Jesse! - Jesse! Let me go! - Mommy! You know, I never really trusted underlay. But I've always heard good things about you. Kira thinks you walk on water. Does she know you're hanging around with these guys? I'm just doing my job. Oh, this is your job. This is your job? Holding innocent people hostage, that's your job? Nobody is holding you hostage. Yeah- look, a crime has been committed. We have to find out who's responsible. This is a crime! This-whatever you're doing right now- this is a crime! Sit down, dave. I don't want to sit down, man! I always thought it was good cop-bad cop, but I don't see a good cop in here. Hell, man, you guys think I'm the only one who knows underlay in town? Hell, I- tell us where he is. Tell us, or I'm gonna rip your damn throat out! He killed our friend! Whoa. Whoa, man. Now, mr. Groves, you will tell us where he is, now. He's somewhere on the road. That's all I know. I mean, um... I might be able to find him for you. There's a satellite phone in the garage. Maybe I could call him for you. That sounds like a great idea. Let's go. Okay. I'll go. You stay here with Troy. You got a problem with that, deputy? All right, where's the phone? All right, hey, just chill, man, okay? Why is it so important that you find underlay tonight anyway? This hurricane's only getting worse before it gets better. Can't you wait till Tomorrow? - No! - Why not? Because by tomorrow, thousands of people are gonna be looking for clear guidance. We don't need people like underlay around, muddying the water. Muddying the water? You got a way bigger problem than mud, man. The phone! It's right there. It's on the table. Right there. Call him. Find out where he is. - Why don't you call him? - Do it! You know what his number is? He's got a whole operation. Genocide under the cover of a hurricane. If everyone dies, Szura didn't do it, nature did. We gotta get there. - And do what? - Stop him. - We gotta get those people out. - Get them where, Russell? Where are we gonna take them? We have to do something else. We have to do something else. I think we should split up. Okay, everybody out. Watch your step, sir. Right this way, please. Step-watch your step, ma'am. Hey, man. I think you're in the wrong room. Hey, we didn't get his I.D. Russell? Mariel, what are you doing here? We got stuck. A tree fell on our car, and the national guard picked us up. They're not the guard. I know. I knew it as soon as I got in the truck, but it was too late. Larkin and the kids are here, too. They're in some warehouse. - Which one? - I don't know. They're separating everybody. I was in a long tunnel with a bunch of other hybrids, and when they saw my I.D., they brought me in here. What are we gonna do, Russell? Listen, Tom's trying to find the main power station so we can shut this place down. Then maybe we can find Szura and create a little uprising of our own. In the meantime, I want you to take this. - No, you need it. - No, you need it more. Come on, take it, Mariel. Take it! Dr. Underlay? - Yes, you are dr. Underlay. - Who are you? My name's Szura. Open this. Would you mind coming with me? Where are my children? They're being looked after. I'm not going anywhere until I see my children. Your children are fine. There are others who may die if you don't come with me right now. How long does it take to make a phone call? Maybe I should go out and check on him. I think we can both go out there, Lewis. Don't bother. All right, watch your step. They took my mom away because of what she is now, didn't they? I don't know. If the phones worked, we could call my dad. They took all the phones. Section two, report to base.</i> Jesse, you stay here with your sister, okay? - Where are you going? - To get us some help. Kira, will you come with me? Jesse, don't leave from this spot, okay? See that guard up there? The one that was on the truck with us? Yeah. You think you could distract him long enough for me to get around him? Where are you gonna go? There's a ranger station about a quarter of a mile up the road from here. They'll have a radio. You shouldn't leave. Rose is scared enough already. - Let me do it. - No. Yeah, it's okay. You create the distraction. I'll get to the station and call Russell and dad, okay? Trust me, Larkin, I can do this. I can do it. Excuse me. Can I help you, ma'am? Do you know where there's a restroom I could use? I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait. Oh... I'm pregnant. I can see that, but there's nothing I can do. Are you telling me I can't use the restroom? There's not one available, ma'am. Are any of you hearing this? Ma'am. This man is telling me I can't use the restroom. Ma'am. I'm a pregnant woman. Don't touch me! Get your hands off me! I'm a pregnant woman! How dare you touch me! I'm a pregnant woman! Hey! Come back here! Stop! Hey, I told you to stop. - Dad? Dad! You're here! - And so are you, honey. Come on! Yes, thank you, gentlemen. Take a seat. No, thank you. Please, doctor, I assure you, this will be very brief. I'm sorry your husband isn't with us tonight. - I want to see my kids. - You will. Why was I taken from them? 'Cause they don't belong with you anymore. They're not a part of you anymore. The sooner you accept that, the better. What was that? My problem. You see, in most cases, nature takes care of itself. But this is a transitional period, and certainly not like any case that we've ever seen. This situation... I'm afraid I'm a little out of my element. Would you mind coming with me? - Where? - Upstairs. Is everyone all right? So far, but we don't know where Mariel is. They took her away. Yeah. Tom. It's dave.</i> We got a problem here. Yeah, I got a lot of problems right now, too, dave. Two of your deputies came to the house tonight looking for you.</i> They brought Lewis. - Lewis? - Yeah, he's okay, though. But these other two guys... these guys aren't so good. I think they wanted to kill you. Where are they now? We have the situation under control. Good, good. Then do me a favor. Tell Lewis to call colonel lopez at the air base,</i> and let her know that there's a major emergency</i> at the wharf. We need as many soldiers and trucks and evac equipment as they can spare, or a lot of people e gonna die. Does this have anything to do with Szura? Yeah, everything. But isn't the military working with him?</i> On the mass murder of their own people? I doubt that's what they signed up for. All right, we're on it. Hey, listen, after this whole thing is over, you gotta give Lewis a raise. I think he saved both of our asses tonight. I hope I get the chance. Talk to you later.</i> I want you to sit tight in here. If anybody should mess with you, you let 'em know you're my daughter. If that doesn't work, you use that. All right? I should have seen this coming. Foul weather is known to incite this in all kinds of other species. Incite what? Oh, my god. Gotta get those women to a hospital. Come on, you know that's not possible. Alma? What are you doing here? I'm-I'm having a baby. I can see that, but I thought your husband wasn't... She left her husband. Met a new man- like us. It's only been three weeks. I don't understand. I think it's more than one. They all need your help, Mariel. Damn it! I'm worried about Kira. Think she made it? I hope so. Folks, could you all to back up a bit?</i> Give us some room here. We're bringing in some cots tonight</i> so that you guys can be a little more comfortable.</i> Cots? Right as the storm's hitting, they're bringing in cots? Where's everybody going? Guys. Don't move. But he said to go over there. No. Don't move. I treated a pregnant hybrid woman. And based on what I saw, I'm not certain she could have survived childbirth. Whatever's inside them- what is inside of them is us - the future. And tonight, you are going to deliver it. I can't. Not alone... and certainly not here, without the proper equipment. Well, I'm sure we can find you a knife. mr. Szura? Yes? Can you get downstairs, sir, right away?</i> I'll be right there. Mariel, why don't you join me? We found him outside. He tried to get in the back. What is it about your choice of men? All right, I have to go. Leave him. Maybe you can assist your ex-wife in the delivery room. I'm sorry. I was on my way to find Larkin and the kids, and I just heard a scream.
