I hope it gets you what you want. Invasion 1x08- The cradle. Transcript RaceMan Adaptation - Ez-, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 - Is the washer working at your dad's ? - No, they still don't have water. - Sorry about this, mom. - Oh, it's fine. Well, Larkin offered to do it by hand, but I told her not to. She's still on bed rest. Jess, it's okay. This is your house. I'm just happy you're here. What's for dinner, mom ? Salad, baked potatoes and pot roast. - I don't like pot roast. - Well, Tom does. Well, why does he always get to choose ? Honey... why couldn't we have, like, chicken or something ? Jess... why is your head bleeding ? What ? No, really, why-what happened to your head, mom ? I... I don't know. Oh, my god. What-what is wrong with you ?! - Get away. - Jesse - Get away ! - Jesse, don't leave ! Jesse, come back ! Come back, Jesse ! Honey, you all right ? I think you were having a bad dream, baby. Here. You wanna tell me about it ? No. The air force guy I found had 12 symmetrical holes in his body. Whatever attacked him left this part of itself in one of his wounds. Mariel said it was still moving when she pulled it out. Possibly ingurgitating fluids. Sucking his blood ? Fluids, Dave. I'm checking to see if this thing came from a squid, not a vampire. So squids ingurgitate ? None that I know of. But there's a lot of creatures in the ocean we haven't been able to study. Well, look at that. Those cells create light. So it is a squid. I didn't say that. What the fisherman showed Larkin sounded like a taningia but... I mean, their photophores are huge. And they're located at the end of their tentacles. These things are tiny. They're on the ventral surface. So basically, this thing could be a squid, or it could not be. Which also means it could be an alien. That's a... That's a... - Baby. - Baby. Then take this corner tuck tightly, and sometimes they push back, and say, "no, thank you. "</i> "No, thank you. " She has just about had it. Yeah, who can blame her ? Larkin, do you want toast with your eggs ? 'Cause it kinda got burnt. Hey, hey, hey ! What are you doing ? Dad says you're not supposed to get up. Well, I need that book. - Here. - Thank you. I really, really think you should be resting, Larkin. I am resting. I'm dying of resting. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi, sweetie. - Why are you watching this ? - To learn stuff about babies. What do you need to know ? Everything. I never had one before. Why don't you just ask my mom about 'em ? I think that would be a little awkward. Why ? Because I'm having this baby with your dad. But why do we need another baby ? Russell ? Are you there ? - Hey, will you get that ? - Huh, oh, yeah. Hey, Lark. Hey, Dave, where's Russell ? We're at the hospital. Someone dumped a baby at his station. We're gonna get it to Mariel to check it out right now.</i> - Daddy has another baby ? - Oh, no, no. Can I speak to Russell, please ? Yeah, sure. Hey, honey. Hey, why would somebody leave a baby with you ? I don't know. Maybe they thought I was a fireman. Is it okay ? Yeah, it seems to be. Well, your daughter would like to know why we need another baby. - It's okay. - No, no, no. It's okay, just take it. Sweetie, can we talk about this later ? Fine. Anythingon the squid ? Uh, inconclusive. Did you call the department of defense ? I don't want you worrying about that stuff, okay ? Well, when am I supposed to worry about it, Russell ? When the military firebombs our house ? Those guys were up my butt ! Okay, look, I gotta go. "Up your butt ?" What if these creatures put holes in our bodies so they can, like, feed us information ? Like, they're moving in. Man, if I ever actually bought into your theories, what would we have to argue about ? I do think that squid thing was a ruse, don't you ? I mean, that fisherman that showed it to Larkin said the military hired him to catch it. How do we know they didn't just give it to him ? Throw us off the scent. Dave, even if the entire population of Jupiter landed in the everglades- - Jupiter doesn't have a population. - The military still wouldn't give a damn about us. Nobody gives a damn about us. He might. What is he doing here ? Tom ? Hey, Russ. Hope you don't mind. Russell, this is Helen Conrad. And this is herdaughter-in-law Christina. Helen called my office this morning and told me that her grandson was missing. I went out to see her, met Christina, and, well, it seems she dropped a baby off here this morning. That's your baby ? - No. - Of course, he's hers. - She doesn't know what she's saying. - I know exactly what I'm saying. The baby isn't mine. - We just took him to the hospital. - Oh, thank god. What can I do to get him back ? You'll have to prove that she's the mother. I assume they'll do a D.N.A.Test-see if there's a match. All right, then that's, uh,that's what we're gonna do. Come on, Christina, let's go. Come on, up. Whoa ! Whoa ! What is wrong with you ?! Russell, would you give ms. Conrad a ride to the hospital ? And I'll make sure that Christina gets there, as well. Listen, can you go home. Tell Larkin I'll be there as soon as I can ? Sure. All right, then,Christina ? So... how did your son die ? If you don't mind me asking. He was electrocuted in the storm. I'm so sorry. He and, uh, Christina and the baby were staying with me. Justin went out to get some supplies. I mean, nobody thought the storm was gonna hit so hard here. I mean, everybody said it was gonna be farther north and... anyway, when he didn't come back, Christina went out looking for him, and... well, we found his body later that night. We didn't know where hristina was for two days. Where was she ? At a shelter. Somebody, uh, brought her in. And when I-when I got there it was... her reaction was so strange. It was-it was almost likeshe didn't even know who I was. And then when I told her about... what had happened to justin, she had no reaction at all. And then she wouldn't event ouch the baby, or feed him,or even... or even a cknowledge that he was hers. Oh, thank god. Are you finished ? Can I take my grandson home ? I'm afraid not, ms. Conrad. Why ? She's not the mother of this child. What are you talking about ? We gave your daughter-in-law a full examination. She's never even been pregnant. it's not physically possible that Christina had a baby. So we had no reason to test her D.N.A. But she had the baby here in this hospital ! We have no records of that. Okay, I am telling you that this child is my grandson. Ms. Conrad ? Christina says that you're making this up because she feels you're distraught over the loss of your son, which is understandable under the circumstances. I'm sorry. I wish I could help. - Oh, my god. - Hey, hey. All right, where is she now ? She left after the exam. She said she was walking home. What, you let her go ? It really wasn't up to me. Okay, all right, I am gonna go get Christina. I am gonna bring her back here. You are gonna test her D.N.A. And then I am taking my grandson with me. - Mar, what is going on here ? - I don't know. Do you think she's lying, Mariel ? You think she's just invented all this ? - What is up with you today, Russell ? - That woman lost a son. And it sounds like she's about to lose a baby. - But it's nother baby ! - It doesn't matter ! Do you know that her daughter-in-law went missing the night of the hurricane ? Like you. - No. - Yeah. And ever since then, she's been denying her child. I mean, what is it about this hurricane that's made so many people so different ? What really happened to you that night in the water ? Do you know ? Do you ? Well, you have children, too. I mean, don't you think you at least owe it to them to find out ? I ran the plates. The car was definitely registered to the air force. - Really ? - Yeah. And the owner... died in afghanistan two years ago. Does Russell know you're pursuing this ? No. And I'm sure he would... hate it if he knew that I'd called you. I have to do something. Russell was gonna call the D.O.D., But he... anyway, I know that you have contacts with the military. - And so I thought that maybe you could - Larkin- No one's gonna bother you anymore. How do you know ? Because I called somebody after your accident. Do you know why that car was following you ? No. Because you were snooping around an air base, and you went into a classified area. What did you see in there ? Titanium boxes. Just like the ones that we saw when we were in Key Largo. And do you know what was in them ? No. Good. So you shouldn't have a problem anymore unless you keep digging. Christina ? Christina, I need to talk with you. Christina ? oh, my god. What have you done ? - Hey. - Oh ! Sorry. I heard the new son the radio. Did you find her ? Yeah, I came to find out what happened to her the night of the hurricane. Guess we've all gone crazy, huh, Russell ? You don't need to be here, Russ. I didn't have to go to the hospital this morning either. Russell's concerned I may have a little too much in common with Christina. I want you to go home, Mariel, please. I am not that woman. Maybe this isn't the best night to bring the kids over. No, you have 'em there by 6. We'll be there. What's going on here ? - We're painting. - Yeah, I can see that. But who told you to ? Larkin. Don't you like it ? Hey. What are you doing up ? I went to the bathroom. Are you sure these fumes aren't bothering you ? No. I kinda like 'em. Well, great. - How is Mariel ? - Why ? Weren't you with her all morning ? Isn't that why you weren't here ? Honey, I found a baby at my station. So I took it to the hospital. Then the mother- the mother disavowed it. And for some reason, the tests show that she never even had a baby at all. And then she goes home, and she kills her mother-in-law. It's been kind of an intense day. What's all this stuff ? It's research. I told you to leave this alone. I know what you told me, but I could've been killed. Why don't you care about that ? - I do. I said I'd take care of it. - When ? Have you called the D.O.D. ? Have you called the air force ? - Have you talked to Tom ? - Why would i talk to Tom ? - He's the sheriff. - Have you talked to Tom ? Oh, Larkin, you talked to Tom ?! Damn it, Russell, I have a right to know why this happened to me ! Yeah, and I have a rightt o protect you ! Since the hurricane, people are going nuts. I wish you would've seent his woman this morning, Mariel. - Larkin. - Mariel ? I meant Larkin. You know that. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But I am worried about her, too. Now I'm supposed to drop the kids off at her house tonight, and I don't want to. I don't trust her anymore. I'm not sure she trusts herself. Well, you're not married to her. Christina ? I'm not supposed to talk to anyone without my lawyer. - What do you want ? - I wanna know what happened to you. - You know what happened. - No. I don't. Did you have that baby ? - You're the doctor. - I wanna hear it from you. It's irrelevant now. That person doesn't exist anymore. What happened to that person ? What happened to your hospital records ? Somebody must've stolen them. Your husband and i had a very interesting talk this morning on the way to the hospital. He knows a lot. But he doesn't know everything. He told me how he survived a plane crash, and how it changed him forever. But we're not the same. I think that scares him. Does he understand what happened to you ? Oh, I think he understands very well. Why did you kill your mother-in-law ? Doesn't everyone wanna kill their mother-in-law ? No. She wanted to drive me to the hospital for a D.N.A. Test. - I didn't want to go. - So you killed her ? If she wanted the baby, she could've had it. She was forcing it on me. Do you have children,doctor ? Yes, I do. Have you felt... differently towards them since the hurricane ? Have you felt like... some part of you wasn't quite as connected to them anymore ? You might wanna take a look at that. You see, all I've done since they pulled me out of the water was look inside myself. I know who I am now. And thanks to your husband... I know what I am. So why are you still so confused ? Mariel, Lewis told me you talked to Christina. Her lawyer's gonna have a real problem with that. Yeah, well, I've been having a real problem, too. What did yous ay to her on the way to the hospital ? I tried to reason with her. I tried to get her to see how precious her baby was. Did you talk about you ? Yeah, yeah, a bit. What'd you say ? I said that I understood her confusion. That I'd gone through a trauma of my own. But the truth is, the thing I kept thinking about the whole time... was you. You have nothing in common with this woman, Mariel. And, though, you may have shareda similar experience, the outcome... is gonna be very different. She doesn't deserve to have a baby now. But maybe you do. What ? I've been giving this a lot of thought and... and, I don't know, maybe... with everything that happened today, um... wait a minute. And I know when we got married, - I said that I didn't want any more children, - wait, wait,what are you saying ? Are you saying that you want to have a baby ? Yeah, I am. Where does this come from ? Why are you saying this now ? Because I think the time is right now. - Tom... - What ? This feels... - very strange. - Yeah, I know. I guess I... something happened to me. No, something's happened to me. I don't... I really need o be alone right now. Honey- you know what ? You're not just gonna... brush over this and tell me that everything's gonna be okay. Not anymore. If I find out that you have been with holding from me... that you know more about what is going on with me than I do... how would that be possible ? I love you. I hope that's enough. What did you say to my wife ? She's very upset. - You're not my lawyer. - He's on his way here now. We're transferring you up to miami. Getting me out, huh ? Before I cause any more trouble ? What did you say ? I just told her the truth. You're the one who took my hospital records, aren't you ? It doesn't matter. If they ever do a D.N.A. Test, people will know the baby was mine. And then everyone will be very confused. Because this body didn't give birth to a child. I think you're crazy. And I think you're in a lot of denial. You're just tryingt o control everything. Trying to manage everyone. But you can't. Because even though we've all been through the same experience, none of us are the same. Are we ? And that's why you haven't told your wife the truth. You are just terrified of losing her. How do you know so much ? Call it mother's intuition. Where are Kira and Dave ? In the garagegetting some primer. It looks like you got more paint on you than on the walls. You having fun ? No. Rose. She heard you talking to Larkin about mom. Hey, sweetie. Why don't you trust mommy ? I do. It's just that your mom's just had a really, really tough time lately. But she's been getting better. I can tell. Yeah ? Well, maybe she is. I'm sorry I said I didn't want another baby, but I just... don't want you to love it more than me. Oh, Rose... that's never gonna happen. Does Larkin not want us here ? Of course she does. She's just, you know, she wants to spend some time with me, too, and we just haven't been able to do that lately. Want me to talk to her ? Honey... I've gotta take the kids now. D-don't. Hey. Come here. What are you doing ? Babe, where are we going ? B-baby... this is where you proposed. Oh, yeah. How about that ? Are you gonna do it again ? Do I have to ? No. I'm... I'm sorry... if I've been a little crazy lately. There's a lot going on and... I know. I love you more than I've everl oved anyone, Larkin. I just hope you know that. I do. I do. baby steps. Where have you been ? The kids are gonna be here soon. Went to the cove where you found me after the hurricane. Why ? Felt like a swim. Mariel... what do you want for dinner, Tom, pot roast or chicken ? I think Jesse would prefer chicken. What's wrong with you ? I saw myself... in the water... dead... rotting actually... but it was me... or at least what used to be me. Oh, my god. So chicken or pot roast ? - Mariel... - Don't. - Did you know ? - No. Did you ? No. Then maybe you need to go and see it for yourself. So ? So I-I went there... to the cove. Exactly where you said you were. And...
