Do you understand that? That's why we got away from Szura. Okay. You know about the lights in the water, right? What's wrong with the town? - I am not an alien! - Then what are you? Because we know you've been different for a long time. Our family is never going to be the same again, is it? You any closer to finding Szura? No. But if I die before it happens, you'll kill him for me, won't you? They're supposed to start school again tomorrow. Wonder how that's gonna go. I think I'm pregnant, you son of a bitch! Szura, don't lose anymore. Hey, we found him! We found Szura. Invasion 1x17 - The key. Transcript RaceMan Adaptation : Ez, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 Honey, what bag is the coffee in? Duffel in the back. I need the keys... and a map. And I don't have time to argue about it. - Good morning, Mar. - Morning. - Did you sleep okay, honey? - Yeah, all right. Yeah, not so all right. It's the kids' first day back at school today. I know. It'll be the first time in their lives that I haven't taken them. Well, I'm sure you could have. Did you talk to Russell about it? He wanted to take Rose. Jesse's not talking to me right now, so... Ah, he's just going through a hard time. He'll come around. I tried calling him. And I wrote a little note for Rose's lunchbox, but... Why don't you give it to me? I'll drop it off on the way to work. I think they feel like they've lost their mother, Tom. They haven't. And if we ever have a baby of our own, they'll see you're not that different after all. Here you go. Thanks for the ride. You okay? No. I don't know what I'm doing here. You've got to go to school, Jess. I'm not talking about school. I'm talking about here, in this town. If we're really being overrun by aliens, what are we doing here? All right. - You ready for your first day back? - Yup. You might make some new friends. How will I know? Know what? When people are, you know, like mommy. Hey, you brush your hair this morning? Yeah. You still got a couple knots in it. You remember we're not gonna talk about any of this stuff with anyone else, right? We don't want to scare anybody. But how will I know? You might not. But all you have to worry about is you right now, okay? You just be who you are. All right, come on. Let's go. Daddy Tom! Hey, sweetheart. Hey, how are you? Hey, Russ. Been workin' in the mines? Russ, this is Ms. Wade. She's gonna be taking over for mr. Gonzales. Hi. Sheriff Underlay's told me so much about you and your daughter. - Hi, Rose. - Hi. What happened to mr. Gonzales? Oh, I'm afraid that this last hurricane was too much for him, and he moved up to orlando. Yeah. Well, he's gonna be missed, but ms. Wade here is gonna fit right in. Can I talk to you a second? Sure. Excuse me. We haven't found anything about Christina right now. This isn't about Christina. Eli Szura. You told me you didn't know who he was. But the man we met yesterday from county services, the man that you called on the radio? That was Szura, and you knew exactly who he was. Szura killed my friend. I better not fd out you had anything to do with it. What friend? What friend, Russ? Daddy? Hello? Hey, Russ. I'm still at Healy's trailer. You forget about me? No, I'm on my way back to you now. I found something... in one of healy's coat pockets. It's a key. A key to what? I don't know. It's got something engraved on it, though. It says, "h-p-m 2-2-8." That's for a boat. For a boat? Yeah, H.P.M. Stands for highland point marina. Did you know Healy had a boat? No. Well, why don't we go down there and check it out?</i> I mean, I don't know if it's gonna get us</i> any closer to finding Szura,</i> but might be a computer on board or something.</i> What do you say? Russ? Nothing around here is ever gonna be the same again, is it? I love this town, Lewis, and I will not let it slip away from me. It won't, sir. Good always triumphs over evil. And which side are we? Good, of course, sir. Then how do you explain Christina Conrad? She's killed two people already- not exactly the poster girl for our future. We'll find her, sir. Our people are looking. Mr. Varon's people are looking. We'll find her. Or she'll find us. Just keep it cool. Get me to an exam room. Good morning, dr. Underlay. Good morning. Don't stop. - I have to check in. - No, you don't. Dr. Underlay? Do you need some assistance? No, thank you. We're fine. Where are we going? The examination room is right here. It's here. Get in here. So if we actually find Szura, do you have a plan for what we're gonna do with him? Russell? I'll have him arrested. I thought you didn't want the police involved. Not locally. We take him to Miami. How do we know what's going on here isn't going on there? I mean, Kira got attacked in the water. We thought it was just going in the glades, but if these creatures are in the ocean now, too, I mean, they could be anywhere. Look, I don't want to think about that right now, Dave. I just want to find Szura, make sure that my kids get through their first day back at school. Yeah, all right. Fine. 228. Well, let's check it out. It's filthy. - You friends with the owner? - yeah. - What's his name? - Healy. Haven't seen much of him lately. I thought he might have finally taken off for good. You, uh, you really friendly with him? You know him well? We're just neighborly. Did he ever find that island he's looking for? Island? He waslways talking about retiring to some island in the keys. Seemed pretty serious about buying one. - So he was looking for an island? - Yeah. Sounds like a pretty good idea these days. Since the hurricane, this place has gotten too strange. Hey, man. What's up? Nothing. Where you sittin' at? Uh, over there with greg and will. Well, uh... see ya. Jesse, right? - Anyone sitting here? - No. - I'm brett. - I know. - Strange, huh? - What's that? Well, the way things have changed. Come on, you see it too, right? I mean, look at that. Stephanie Johnson talking to Weidermeyer? I mean, come on. Sunglass man? A lot of these guys didn't hang out with each other last year. Yeah. It's kind of weird. Yeah. So your family make it through the hurricane okay? Because, you know, a lot of people didn't. Yeah. We made it all right. What about you? Not so much. So are you going to abandon this child like you did your last one? Well, not to split hairs, but that baby wasn't mine anymore. Because the body I'm in now hasn't given birth. Neither has yours, by the way. Is that hard for you- pretending that you still love what used to be your children? I do love my children. Right. Right. You just keep telling yourself that. Leave it! It's my husband. If I don't answer, he may show up here. Is that what you want? Calm and happy. Hi. Hey, baby. I got your note to Rose. You ever reach Jesse?</i> I, um... I talked to him briefly while he was on his way to school. Talked to Kira at the house today. She sounds like she's doing a lot better now. Good. Good. Are you, uh, all right? I'm actually just with a patient right now, Tom. Can I call you back? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Just, uh... just checkin' in, tellin' you that I love you.</i> I love you, too. Is this how you manage things for the C.I.A.? You have to be flexible, Tom. If everything goes according to plan, Christina will be found. Security on the island will be improved. I'll continue to isolate the bad seeds for as long as you think it's necessary. I've got Derek patched up. She tried to kill him. Some women are fickle that way, eh? Russell knows who you are. He thinks you murdered some friend of his. The park ranger? Yeah, the park ranger who shares children with my wife? The park ranger who we're gonna need to help contain this? Yeah, that one. - I can contain this. - No, you can't. This girl is running arod killing people in my community. And they're not going to hold you accountable for that. They're going to come to me. I really believe that we can all work together, Eli- the people in this town that have been changed and the people who haven't- if there's mutual trust. Feeling better? Um, yeah. Yeah, much. Good. Then we should be on our way. Great. - Where are we going? - To find your girlfriend. She's obviously very confused right now. She needs our help. - No. No, she's crazy. - No, no. She's pregnant. Oh, god! what is it? I just... it fee like it's eating me alive. I mean, it's only been three weeks. Have you ever seen anyone this big after only three weeks? Who's the father? She shot me. The bitch shot me, man. Well, I'm sure that was an accident. We'll find her. We'll take her back to the island, and before you know it, you'll be celebrating the birth of your son. My son? You know it's a boy? Well, no, but we can always hope, right? Yeah... I really want to. You know, I really want to be a father. I know. But she's just- she's just so nuts. She'll be fine. She just needs a little support. Come on. How are we gonna find her? The way every other species finds its way-instinct. I have no idea what I'm looking at here. Satellite photos of the keys I got from our weather station- 120 miles of them. Yeah, but Szura's here. - He killed Healy here. - He could be based out there. You know how many camps the C.I.A. set up during the cold war? No. Hell, the bay of pigs alone must have had... What does this look like to you? A road. Yeah. What's the date on that photo? It's november 14th. I just saw a picture of that same island. There. Look at that. This was taken in august- three months earlier. No road. So this is new. This is a new road... on what used to be an uninhabited island. Ready? Fire away. What is that? Why is it doing that? Is it twins? Triplets? What's going on? It looks like you're having a litter. if it can happen to me, it can happen to you. You and the sheriff hooked up since the hurricane? What is it about you that feels the need to hurt so many people? I have to replace your I.V. Bag. It's right across the hall. Keep the door open. Wait. Can't you just use this? Sure. Doctor? We need another liter- standard sux I.V. Can I see that? We just need to get more fluids in you. So show it to me. Thanks. What's up, guys? Let's get in there. Guess we can forget about making the basketball team this year, huh? Mariel? Dad? What are you doing home? I came to see you. No, you didn't. Yeah, I did. You came home from the middle of work just to see me? I came to check in on you, and- I'm your dad. What's so weird about that? Well, you've just never done it before. Oh. Well, I wanted your yogurt, too, so... You feeling okay? Am I gonna have these scars forever? No. They'll go away. But you're not gonna do that again, are you? No going in the water. You want to take a swim, find a pool. Here, hold this, baby. yeah? Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa. Are we gonna need that? Who knows? I'm sure Szura's got one. Did you tell Larkin that we're going to do this? I told her... that we might be gone a day or two. No, but does she know, Russ? She knows... what's at stake. Come on, let's go. We didn't see my dad for, like, three days. Filled out police reports, even hung his picture on the fence for the missing. How did you finally find him? We didn't. He just showed up one day. Acted like everything was fine, but I could tell he wasn't the same. What about, you know, your mom? No, no. No. In fact, she and my dad- I mean, she can't stand the way he is now- always screaming at him, crying. Yeah. I stay out of it. Rarely get home except to go to bed. Good news is, is that we're not the only guys that feel this way, you know? Couple of guys I hang with, same thing happened to them. Really? Yeah. Yeah, you know, they're afraid that if this keeps happening to people, we're gonna end up like- like shut-outs or something. I mean, I'm already a minority, you know what I mean? Yeah. I just think we should stick together on this, you know, maybe do something about it down the road. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Will you be needing anything else, doctor? No. Thank you. Hey. What did you do? Nothing. Just keeping you hydrated. I'm getting... out of here. You've done something very stupid. What's in that? What is in that? Christina. You okay? Yeah. I trusted you. I thought you, of all people, would understand I'm a pregnant woman. Oh, shut up. Hey, how many islands are out here? Hundreds. Well, then how are we supposed to find this particular one? Well, I've got the coordinates. Should be close, but I don't see a thing. We go too far? No, not according to this. It's gotta be up ahead. Speed up a little bit. - You all right? - Yeah. What the hell was that? I don't know. Russ, you hear that? Hey. - Russ, what the hell is that? - I don't know. How you feeling? A little better. So how was it being back? Weird. It's a great argument for homeschooling. You still mad at me for not telling you about Mariel and my dad? It's not just our family, Kira. It's a lot of people. You know that for sure? Well, at least we know we're not crazy now. And maybe my dad took your mom to the water so she wouldn't feel alone. What do you mean, "took her to the water"? The night of the hurricane. Wait. He took her? I mean, he did this to her on purpose? No. No, um, I don't think he knew it was gonna happen, I mean, for sure. But he took her. He... my mother didn't have to be this way. But he made her this way? Jesse. Jesse, wait. I can't get it from here. So what-what- what do we do? I gotta go in the water. What? - What about whatever's in there, man? - I don't think we have a choice, Dave. - You want to be stuck out here? - Well, no. You'll go in after me if there's a problem, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course I would, yeah. Come on. Oh! Whoa! Hey! Can you not point the shotgun at me? Oh, yeah. Sorry, man. - What, did you fix it? - Uh-huh. Look at this. Check this out. That looks like a channel marker. What's it doing way out here? That's a good question. - Come on, give me a hand. - Here, take this. Look at this. It's brand-new. So what's it doing out here? Maybe to help somebody find a remote island. - Let's go. - Yeah. So... plan on having any more kids? 'Cause if not, if you're thinking of adopting, I may have five or six I could throw your way. I could just disappear, you know... if you'd let me. Yeah, I've seen how you disappear. Christina! What the hell? I knew you were close. I knew it. See, Derek? You're like a homing pigeon. What are you doing here? Waiting for her. I was bringing her to you. I'm sorry, Tom. Get them both out of here now. Hello, Christina. It's gonna be okay, Chrissie. It's gonna be okay. Hey. You all right? What'll happen to that girl? She'll be okay. Everybody's gonna be okay. We won't be having any children, Tom. I don't know what's growing inside that girl, but... I don't want to be a part of it. Whoa. Whoa. There. - What? - See that? Yeah, I do. What is that? Pull over there by those weeds. Turn the light off. That's the island. They got a bonfire goin'. There's a lot of people on the beach. What are they doing? I don't know. There's a boat. Can we get a hand here, folks? Ladies and gentlemen, our missing friends have returned- Christina and Derek. Who's that guy talking? Szura. I know this has been a difficult time for some of you. We've all been through an extraordinary experience. We're no longer who we once were. We've moved on from the life we had, left friends and loved ones behind. And I know that many of you have questions about your future, fears... doubts. You all want to know that your sacrifice has been worth it. Let me tell you what I believe. I believe that we are the seeds of the future that no man could ever imagine. But this future is not guaranteed. There are those who will oppose it, oppose us. To reach this future, we will need the strength that comes from our sticking together. Our very survival depends on our unity, and that's why I've brought Derek and Christina back... so that they can be an example to all of us... to show us the consequence
