I'm not sure she trusts herself. Well, you're not married to her. You have a lot to learn. There's a little work camp down in the glades. I'm gonna send you there for a while, all right ? I think yore in a lot of denial. You're just trying to control everything. What is that ? Your husband's skeleton. I wanted to be your wife and a good mother to Jesse and Rose, and you have taken that away from me. No, I haven't. I'm leaving. You can't leave me now ! Even though we've all been through the same experience, none of us are the same. How do you know so much ? He's taken them. Tom's taken the kids. - Where ? - I don't know. Invasion 1x12- RaceMan Ez, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 Your problem, christina, is you're just not gettin' with the program. Sheriff talked to you after you abandoned your baby... told you how to behave... but you didn't listen. You just went home and killed your mother-in- law. That was not good. Why are we stopping ? No ! No ! No ! You bastards ! How long have the kids been missing ? I don't know. I just got home. I thought you guys had power. We did. Tom must have taken the generator. - Why would he do that ? - I don't know. Same reason he took the kids, maybe-to prove a point. All of Rose's sweaters are still here. What does the note say ? "Mariel, the children and i are going on a little adventure. "Should be good for everybody. Talk to you soon. " - Was he planning a trip ? - Not that I know of. Did you guys have a fight ? Huh ? Mariel... Why didn't you radio and tell me you were gonna drop the kids off ? I didn't drop them off- Larkin did, and only because Tom called and said you two had plans. - He called her ? - Yeah. So did she tell him you think we're aliens ? Come on, I didn't say that. You showed me a skeleton you claimed was my husband and told me you don't think I'm in my own body anymore. Did you say any of that to Tom ? No, not yet. Well, what did you say ? Will you stop walking away from me ?! I told him that I was leaving him... with the kids. Why ? Because of what he did to me. He took me to the water the night of the hurricane. He said he wanted to show me the lights. Now if I have changed, he's the reason. - He admitted this ? - Yeah. - Does he know that I know ? - No. - Does he know that... - that I kissed you ? No. Our secret is safe. Aren't I a good ex-wife ? Where's your radio ? That's what I'm looking for. So how many people know about me besides your brother-in-law ? None. Not even your wife ? No. Have you called your divorce lawyer yet ? Why would I do that ? To get full custody of Jesse and Rose. You should have a good shot now. There aren't a lot of alien rights groups in this state. Hey, whatever's happened to you, you're still their mother. Then promise me you won't tell anyone about me until I know what I am. I don't want people speculating, and I certainly don't want my children to be afraid of me. You promise me that ? When I know the kids are safe. Damn it. His office is locked. How about a window ? There isn't one. His office has no windows ? Maybe he's a vampire, too. Looks like it's just your house. You got phone service ? We didn't. Mariel ? I can't find the phone. Where are you ? In the bedroom. You only have one phone ? There's another in Tom's office. I found it ! Hello ? Hello ? What's in here ? I think it's where Tom keeps his guns. You think ? Well, I've never actually been in there. What if he keeps his radio in here, too ? I don't have keys for it. Do you have a key for the office ? Maybe. - Can I see the phone ? - Why ? 'Cause I want to make a phone call. Larkin, it's the phone ! Hey, the phone's ringing ! I know. The phone is ringing. Hello ? Honey ? Russell. We got power back yet ? Uh... no, no power. Where are you ? I've been trying to radio you. You left without saying good-bye. I'm at Mariel's. I was just worried about the kids. I told you, I just dropped them off. I know, but Tom took them someplace. Russell. Is there a problem ? No. No, there's no problem. I was just- I just wanted to see them, that's all. Well, if they aren't there, are you coming home ? Yeah. I'll be home soon. - Russell, what's going on ? - Nothing. Everything's okay. I'll see you in a little bit, okay, honey ? Okay. All right. I can't lie to my wife. You're not lying. You're just not telling her about me or Tom until I have some answers. - She's my wife. - She's also a reporter. She has an obligation to tell the truth, especially if it has greater ramifications for the town. Well, maybe she should. You may be fighting this thing, but the other people, the people in the survivors' group-what are they planning ? What do you mean ? They plotting to overthrow the world ? I don't know. Do you ? Honestly, I don't think they realize what's happened to them. I didn't. Maybe they're waiting for your husband to tell them. - Russell... - Okay, wait. Hello ? Hello ? Where's your husband ? Who is this ? You've poisoned my house. You've poisoned my house.</i> The number you are... Give me the key. Who's his decorator ? He's been collecting this stuf for a long time. Tom ? Tom, it's Russell. Are you there ? Hello ? Mariel. Tom. Where are you ? I'm with the kids. Didn't you get my note ? You didn't tell me where you were going. Why am I on the speaker, honey ? We have phone service again. Power, too. Yeah, how about that ? Did you make this happen ? With a little help from our friends. But we're the only house with electricity, Tom. Probably just a touch for me. I'm sure a lot of areas have power now, and I know cell phones are workin'. - Where are you ? - I'm with the kids. Can I speak to them ? Not right now. Tom, come on. I'll have them call you later. Why are you doing this ? Because I think you need some time to think about what's really important in your life. - Tom - I'll see you soon, baby. Tom, listen, don't hang- Who's ready for dinner ? Me ! Yeah ? Hot dogs, hamburgers and more comin' up. Yay ! This is a really cool idea, dad. Yeah. Kinda different, huh ? Who owns this place ? Friend of mine. Downstairs-pool table, music, video games. Rosie, there's a karaoke machine right in the closet over there, all right, baby, if you want to sing later. You're gonna do karaoke ? You never heard my version of "my way" ? No. I can't believe that. - Here you go, Tom. - Thanks, Jess. Chilly out here tonight, huh ? There you go, buddy. Did you guys find a movie you want to watch ? Uh... we were thinking "the shining. " Might be a little intense for Rose. She wants to do karaoke with you. Yeah, well, maybe I'll just watch her. So... why are we really here, Tom ? What do you mean ? Did you and mom get in a fight or something ? You just hustled us out of the house pretty fast, so... you know, she's not here. Look, Jess, you know your mom had a rough time after the hurricane, and it's definitely put a strain on our relationship, so I just figure why not give her a little break, you know ? So you just... called your friend on a dime and asked if you could borrow his cabin ? Yeah. He's a big developer up north, hardly uses the place. If he's a developer, then... why does he have a boat from the sheriff's department ? Let me know if you need anything else, Tom. He won't hurt the kids. How do you know ? Because he's not angry at them, he's angry at me. yeah, but he's using them to punish you. He's not going to hurt them. No, Russell. If it's Tom, he'll know you're here. I don't care. - Hello ? - Hey, Russ, it's me. - Who is it ? - It's Dave. Tell him not to say anything about this. I'm gonna go call Tom's station, see if they know where he is. What's up, Dave ? Hey, you gotta tell Larkin what's goin' on. Why ? Why ? 'Cause she thinks you're spending too much time with Mariel. She doesn't understand why it's such a big deal that Tom took his kids. Did you say anhing to her ? What, that Underlay's a walking corpse, that sometimes these creatures are known to eat their young ? No, Russ, I didn't think that was my place. Well, you're right, it's not, so don't say anything yet. Man, I don't think you're hearing me here. She's worried that something's going on between you and Mariel. Get it ? Did she say that ? Yeah. Yeah, she said she came home early from her trip 'cause she missed you. She's waitin' in the bedroom all lingeried and pregnant, and you just blew her off. Hold on a second. No, no, Russ, no, no, no. I can't hold on. Russ ! Russ ! Russ ! all right, who wants turkey ? Who wants beef ? - I want turkey. - You got it, honey. Beef. - All right. Sweetheart ? - I'll just have salad. No, come on. You gotta eat something. - You're gettin' too skinny. - No, I'm not. Yeah, yeah, you are. You're beautiful, but you're gettin' skinny. You know what ? I forgot the sodas in the car. Um, lettuce, Tomatoes on the table. Help yourself, all right ? Does any of this seem weird to you ? What do you mean ? Since when does he care about hangin' out with us ? It's a vacation. Yeah, but when are we comin' back ? Who cares ? We don't have school. - Are you not surprised that our mother's not here ? - She needed some time. - Now who told you that ? - Daddy Tom. Mommy and daddy have been having some problems, so daddy Tom thought it would be best to give them some time. And since when does daddy Tom know about our dad's problems ? And why does he care ? Do you think we should go look for games after we finish eating ? The ocean's so cool. And there's a boat down there. Really ? Maybe if you give my dad... What happened ? Oh, my god. What happened ? I'm gonna grab a towel. Answer it. Hello ? Mariel, Mariel. Dave. Hey, is Russell still there ? It's Dave. No. - Can he call you back ? - No. No, I gotta tell him something right now. It's kind of important, please. - He'll call you back, Dave. - Mariel ! Damn it ! Who did this to you ? There was two guys outside. They were watching the house. One of them had a cell phone. I think he may have been calling. We gotta get you to the hospital. No, no. Just get me some ice. What's going on here, Russell ? Why is this happening to us ? Hey, it's gonna be fine. We're all gonna be fine. What happened ? I'm gonna go grab some ice. Here. Russell, what happened to you ? I got into a fight. With who ? I don't know. Hey, close the door. Lock it. Hurry. What are you doing here ? I was worried about you. Here's the ice. I'm gonna go get the first aid kit. These cuts are deep. Sweetheart, it's gonna be fine, okay ? Everything's gonna be okay. I know. That's what you just told her. Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption I plan... I need to talk to you. Um, meet me downstairs in two minutes. ... One more much more than this I did it my way If Tom called and said everything was okay, then why are you so worried ? Because we don't know where he went. Did you ask him ? He wouldn't tell me. We got into a fight. I'm gonna go get another ice pack. What is going on here ? I told you, I came by to see the kids. But the kids aren't here, and they haven't been here. Russell, what did Tom and Mariel fight about ? Honey... is Tom angry because you're spending too much time with his wife ? No. - No, Larkin, don't get that. - Why not ? - Don't ! - What is everyone hiding here ? Hello ? What ? Someone just said I betrayed them. Give me that. - Who is this ? - Put it on speaker. Who is this ? What do you want ? for this to be over. Yeah, well, so do we. I know what you two are doing, and I am not gonna let it happen. You betrayed us all. Listen, you son of a bitch ! - I have to go. - No, Larkin, wait. I have to tell her. Larkin. Russell, I'm sorry, but this is all just a little bit too much for me. Please... Who was that ? I don't know. The reason I'm so concerned about Tom being with the kids is because he may not be human anymore. After his plane crash, one of these creatures in the water got ahold of him, and he's been changed. He's not who he was, and he may be driven to hurt the kids. This is crazy. Yeah, I know, but it's real, and it's happened before. In other parts of the world, where these lights have shown up in the water, the people who've come in contact with them, they've been cloned or replicated. Somehow, they've been given new genetic information, and many of these people have killed their own children. My god. Mariel is one of them, too. She's fighting it, and I am trying to support her, but it's obviously very difficult. She begged me not to tell you. Why ? She was afraid that you'd go public. Well, I think she would be worried about more than that. She is. We both are, believe me. Well, you both seem to be coping pretty well. Honey- I have to go. Okay, honey... I promise you that I wildo something about this, but I have to make sure that my children are safe. Me, too. What, Kira, I told you what I saw, and are you not concerned ? What you saw sounds like luggage. No, no. A big black duffel bag. Big. So ? What does that mean ? It means that I want to know what's inside of the thing. What do you think is inside of it ? I don't know. But this whole trip is crazy. I don't believe we're here on vacation. and I think that there's something more going on here. Your dad says that this place is owned by a developer, but then, there's a sheriff's department boat outside. So what ? Look, maybe you take a lot of trips with your parents, but I'm lucky if my dad even talks to me, so I'm not gonna start complaining. I like this. I like this movie, too. You'll ruin the surprise. What are you doing here, Jesse ? I, um, I-I was curious about what was in this bag. - Curious ? - Yeah. You saw me bring that bag in here, didn't you ? Daddy Tom, can we do another song ? Yeah, dad, where did you put the, um, the... Jesse ? I didn't want to do this now, but... guess I don't have a choice. - Open it. - Open it ? Yeah, open it. Help him out, guys. Presents ? Presents. That one in the middle there, that's for you, rosie, and the one with the red bow, that's for you, honey. The other one's for you, Jess. What's the occasion ? It's been exactly a month since the hurricane. This is my way of showing you guys how proud I am for the way that you've handled everything. - A book ? - "Robin hood. " - Wow. - That was my mom's. She used to read that to me, and I used to read that to Kira. That was your mom's. And that's my favorite picture of her. We took that the day that she found out that she was gonna have a baby. Dad... - Thank you. - You're welcome, honey. It's a gun. That's a colt 76. My dad gave me one when I was just about your age, and when you're ready, I'll teach you how to use it, with your dad's permission, of course. It's really cool, Tom. Thanks. You're welcome, Jesse. Now if you guys would give me a minute, I'll meet you upstairs, and we'll all call your mom and say good night, all right ? Okay ? All right. Hey, Tom ? Yeah ? I'm sorry I scwed up your surprise. It all worked out, right ? Yeah. All right, I'm gone. What ? Tom's office is sending someone over to take a report. Does anyone know where he is ? No. Sorry about Larkin. I'm sorry that she left. Yeah, I don't think she trusts me anymore. You haven't given her any reason not to trust you. Yes, I have. Has Tom read all these books ? I don't know. Well, he sure looks like a guy plotting to take over the world. - Hello ? - It's me. Oh, my god. Tom... Look, I know you've got company. But I need to talk to you. Alone. Give me the phone. - He has to talk to me alone. - I don't give a damn. Russell. Just get the door ! Bring my kids back ! You gotta tell me what's going on, Tom. What do I have to do to get your ex-husband out of our lives ?</i> - You Mr. Varon ? - Yeah. I'm deputy Munger, this is deputy Palmateer. I understand we had a little problem here tonight. You tangled with a prowler ? What happened to you ? Mr. Varon, would you like to file a report with the sheriff ? I have a feeling the sheriff knows everything he needs to know already. All right, then. You have a good night, and be sure to give our regards to ms. Underlay. He's gonna bring the kids back here first thing in the morning. - Where have they been ? - His friend's cabin. - And he's bringing them back for sure ? - Yes. Well, what did you say ? That I wanted them home, so he's bringing them. Hold on a second. He put us through hell, and he did it for a reason. Why is he suddenly backing off now ? What did you say ? I said that... I loved him. What else did you say ? I have to go to bed now, Russell. You're welcome to sleep on the couch if you want or go home, whatever you want to do. Mariel, what else did you say ? Nothing. Come on there, children. Home, sweet home. Daddy ! - Daddy, what happened ? - I got into a little accident. I'm okay. It was so cool. We fished and sang karaoke, and daddy Tom bought us all presents. Yeah ? That's great. - Hey, dad. - Hey. How you doin' ? - You look messed up. - No, I'm okay. Hi, honey. Are you sure ? Yeah. Ohh. I missed you. Hey, Kira. Hi, honey. Morning. Hey, mar. Hey. You got great kids, Russ. Thanks for letting me steal them for a while. Hey, guys, would you give us a minute ? - Why ? - So the adults could talk. - Yeah, you guys go inside. - All right. Russell, I'm sorry if I worried you, but I did it for a reason. I know your reason. I know all about you, Tom. Well, then you know how much I love your children, and you know how we always try to do what's best for them, so Mariel and I have decided that we're gonna let them stay with you for a while. - You're giving me custody ? - For now, yeah. Did you agree to this ? Is that what you talked about on the phone ? Yeah, I think it's best for everybody. Hey, no matter what our differences are, we're always gonna have the kids in common, and we never want to put them in a situation where they could get hurt... do we ? Mariel... What's the matter, Russ ? Isn't this what you've always wanted ? - You hungry ? - Yeah. Yeah ? Me too. Jesse, Rose, um... your dad is gonna take you to breakfast, and you're probably gonna stay with him tonight. Why ? It's your night. I know. I just thought... mom... thought maybe we could try something new tonight and maybe Tomorrow night, too. Mom... It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. You're crying. It's because I love you. You gonna get that, babe ? I think you should get it. let's go, let's go. Stevie ! Well, I see you've got another load, too. Welcome to camp, darlin'. Did you have a good swim ? Careful of her, Derek. She's a little prickly. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. We like that. Let's see what santa got us. Let me get that for you. Jeez ! Aw, check this out ! Oh, look here. Merry christmas. This looks like your size. What's going on here ? You're on the island of misfit toys, honey.
