She probably snuck in when I got home. I bet you were so scared. We were all scared, Rose. Rose, look at me. You know never to leave the house without telling somebody where you're going. I didn't know where I was going. Daddy ? Did you see the lights ? No. What lights ? In the sky. I saw a bunch of colored lights. It's probably another power line. I'm sure they're down everywhere. I love you. Love you, too, Daddy. Rose ! Hey, Rose. Here you go. You got that one ?</i> - Are all the phones out ? - Yep. Not one tower held. Got no electricity or water, neither. Everything's gone. Governor's already declared most of dade county a disaster area. - Russell !God. - Hey. What happened ? Where were you ? It's okay, honey. We're all okay. Right ? Yeah. Dad ! Hey !

Wow - We're all okay. That's all that matters, huh ? - Yeah. Where were you ? I called and called. Hey, what's he doing here ? Jesse, can you give us a second ? Why ? What's wrong ? - Mariel didn't make it home last night. - What ? Tom called on your radio this morning. He said that the last time he spoke to her, she had just left here, And he said she was very upset. All right, look, I'm sure she's just stuck somewhere. You know, like we were. Yeah. It's okay. - I'd say good morning, but... - Good morning,Tom. Did you have words with your mother last night, son ? This isn't his fault. I didn't say it was. Did you tell your Mom to leave last night, Jesse ? I told her to leave. That might not have been the wisest idea, huh ? Sheriff Underlay ? Come in, Underlay.</i> Underlay, come in, please. Yeah, come back. Come in. Hey. Jesse, it's not your fault. - He's just upset. - Yeah. It's just my mom, you know ? She's always so worried that something bad's gonna happen that she ends up... Making it happen. Sucks. Did you check the plate ? Check the plate. - It's a match. - 10-4.</i> They found the car. Don't worry, Rosie. We're gonna get this all cleaned up. Did they find mommy yet ?

Listen, I'm telling you, You want a good story, you go down to the abandoned Air force base. There's all kinds of secret projects going on there. I really gotta go, Dave. Right. Bye, Rosie. Bye. Bye, Rose. - Bye. - See ya. Don't you worry, kiddo. I'm gonna have this roof fixed for you in no time. You ever fix roofs before ? Yeah, sure, after Andrew, I did it for a living. What do you do now ? I'm kind of between jobs right now. What was your last job ? Well, I managed an apartment building with my girlfriend, but... She kicked me out, so... You're here. Yeah. Did you see the lights ? What lights ? I saw a bunch of lights In the sky last night. Dad thought they were sparks, But they were much bigger. Really ? Where'd you see them ? Landing in the water. Landing ? What, uh... What kind of shape were they ? Mom ! Mariel ! I don't understand why she would leave the car. She probably felt safer in here. These melaleuca trees are pretty tough. Why some people, you people, Want to spend millions trying to get rid of them, I don't understand. They're killing the park. They take 15 acres a day. Survival of the fittest. Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Mariel ! Mare ? Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay, it's okay. It's okay. Mom ? It's Jesse, honey. It's Jesse. Jesse. Hey, mom. Call the hospital, tell them we're coming. Tell them we're coming. Tell them we're coming. Look she's gonna be alright. I hope so. I wonder what happened to her clothes. It's hard to describe the emotion here, Peter. I've talked to so many people who've lost everything. Yet the overwhelming feeling seems to be hopeful. Families who's home were less damaged Were opening their doors to their neighbors, Helping them with their childrens, just helping them any way they can. It's a nice reminder that even in the most difficult times, The human spirit remains strong. This is Larkin Groves reporting live from Florida city. We're clear and we're out. - Great. - Good job. If your family isn't out here by tomorrow, call me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'd like to be on TV someday. Oh yeah ? Why  ? I don't know maybe 'cause you can help people. You know, like, when my mom died, I really couldn't believe it, you know. Until I saw the story on the news. Even though all these reporters were going on about how terrible it was, You know, two seconds later, they were laughing and talking about the weather. So in a way, it made me feel better. I'm not sure That's such a good thing. Me either. No, but my dad says television's important Because it distracts people from the truth. Like with this hurricane, I mean, you know, it's terrible, but on the news it'll just be a story. And at first the reporters will be serious about it, But after awhile they'll be laughing and making jokes, And then everyone will be distracted from what's really going on. What is really going on ? The truth. Where are my kids ? You know where they are. They're at Russell's. I want to see them. We're gonna have 'em back on monday. I want to see them now. Mare ? Hi, baby. Thanks, Ruth. We'll take it from here. Thank you, Ruth. How you feeling, sweetie ? I was telling the mayor that we felt that a quarantine might be in order, At least for the first few weeks. Do you really think it's necessary, Mariel ? We're so cut off as it is. We have no idea what's been let loose here, mayor. The I. C.U. is badly damaged. We're got hundreds of people missing. The water may be contaminated. Better safe than sorry. I'll have to clear it with the council. Of course. You do. Whatever you have to do. All right, all right. Let's go home. We're done here. What's happening to me ? You sure you saw the lights out here ? Yeah. We're a long way from home. So ? Must have been a hell of a lot of lights. There were. What's that ? What ? Right there, that shiny thing. Oh, hey, hey, sit down. Want to get bit ? Bit by what ? A gator, goofball. A gator won't bite you ? No, they're afraid of me. What is it ? I don't know. Could be a piece of a boat. Which part ? I can't tell ya, but... Whatever it is, it's stuck down there good. Why won't a gator bite you ? Dave ? Dave ? Uh, yeah. Let's get outta here, huh ? Thanks for letting me go back to my house, dad. This is your house. I mean my real house. - Hey, Bud. How you doing ? - Hey, Tom. - Hey. - What's going on ? Here she comes. Hello, honey. Slide that kitty right in the backseat here. Let your brother help you out there. All right. It's very good of you to let them come with us, Russell. Her mom really appreciates it. Thanks. - How's she doing ? - She's good, fine. By tomorrow, I think she'll be better than ever. Good. Here you go, honey. All right, I love you, Rosabelle. I love you, too, Daddy. Okay. Here, put your seat belt on. Jess, tell your mom I hope she feels better. Yeah. Okay, have fun. Thanks, dad. We'll talk soon. Hey, Tom, there's still a little something I'm confused about. What's that ? Well, just, you said last time you spoke with mariel, She was just leaving here ? That's right. We lost cell service pretty early yesterday. How'd she get through to you ? Must have stopped and used a pay phone. Thanks. Father Scanlon, just a few questions, please. How many hours were you in the water, sir ? Excuse me, can we just get a word, sir? The E. M.T. said that you were there for 16 hours. - Is that true, sir ? - Did you ever lose your faith ? I have to go. Father jeffrey scanlon, Obviously distraught after a terrible night in the everglades. Lifted from the water by paramedics seemingly in amazing health, actually. Let's go back to you in the studio. Poor guy. That's the second time I've seen that look today. Mariel ? Yeah. Completely disoriented, No clothes. How do you spend all night in a hurricane and not have a mark on you ? You did. Hi. Russ, can I see you for a second ? Yeah, you sure can. You took Rose out on an airboat today ? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I knew there was something weird about this hurricane, Russ, And I thought it was cover for the military, but I was wrong. Whoa ! Jeez ! What is that ? You tell me. It's a skeleton. Yeah, And the other stuff ? Where'd you find this ? In the water about 2 miles south of everglades city. - What, did rose see it ? - No, no, no, no, no, I dropped her off, and I went back to get it. Well, take it to the police, Dave. No way, Russ. They'll just cover it up. You think they want people to know that we have an extraterrestrial in our midst ? What ? - Are you drunk ? - No, I'm not drunk, Russell. Look at this thing. It's got spikes poking through its head and its neck. Like it just had the life sucked right out of it. Dave, this is a person. I know. He may have had a family. I mean, we need to find out who he is and what really happened to him. I know, and we will, we will, but on our own. I want to go back there tonight, And I want you to come with me. - No, Dave. - Come on, Russ. Come on, come on, come on. You've been studying weird plants and animals your whole life. I show you the work of one E.B.E. A what ? An extraterrestrial biological entity. Dave, will you stop ? There are no aliens. Then will you tell me what's going on here ? I don't know. Maybe a sea creature. We weren't in the ocean. All right, Dave. I'll admit this is interesting, But I'm not gonna go out there with you tonight. Come on, Russ, come on ! Look, I know that you don't care about aliens, But I know that you care about your wife and kids. So do I. And... I don't want them to end up like this guy. Russ, I have to do something tonight, and I'm asking you please to come with me. Were you really worried about me ? Yeah, I was. Dad said you were. I was worried about you, too. Know what, sweetie ? I think you gotta go to sleep now. Will you take me to school tomorrow ? There's not gonna be any school for awhile, honey. Will a hurricane come again tonight ? No. Mommy ? You smell different. What am I looking for ? Lights. In the sky ? No, in the water. Rosie said that when they landed, they didn't go out. They didn't go out ? No. That's what made me so suspicious. You ever been out this way before ? Yeah, after the '96 plane crash. A lot of park people were called in for search and rescue. Oh, my god. That might be what I found today. No, Dave, you found an alien. No, no, no, not that. I found a piece of metal in the water today. I bet it's from that plane. Well, maybe the martians shot it down. What's that ? Hey, hey ! Hey, right there. Look. Look. Did you see that ? There it is again. Right there. Straight ahead, Straight ahead. Slow down. What do you say now ? A fish. A jellyfish, maybe. Yeah, come on. All right, if that's a fish, where's the light coming from? Bioluminescence. Bio what ? It's a life light. A lot of fish have it to identify other members of the species, So they can mate or... Scare away predators... Or attract prey. Dave, I wouldn't do that. I don't think... Dave ! Dave ! Oh, my god ! That was no fish ! That was no fish ! Are you all right ? Are you all right ? - I think my leg's broken. - What ? My leg's... Be careful. Emergency supply centers are being set up all over the county, And volunteers are desperately needed, so if you think you can help out, Please, call the number you'll be seeing on our screen Or come down here to the homestead hospital And speak to one of these aid workers. Now we understand you have a family member in there, Larkin ? Yes, that's right. My brother Dave got into a bit of a wrestling match with an alligator last night. Did you tell 'em a gator did this ? For now, it's the most plausible explanation. Russ, It was an E.B.E. Extraterrestrial biological entity ? That's a dumb name for an alien. Good morning, Gentlemen. Good morning. Heard you had a little accident last night. Mind if I take a peek ? Be my guest. Gently, please. How you feeling, Mare ? Oh, much better. Thanks. Kids okay ? Oh, yeah, they're great. Rose decided it would be a good idea to give her cat a bath this morning, Which didn't go over too well, And Kira made Jesse breakfast, Which I thought was really sweet. I understand you ordered full quarantine for the area. Yeah, I think it's best. With everything that's been stirred up, We just don't know what's out there right now. Oh, you got that right. Well... You're a very lucky man. How do you figure ? Judging from the size of these teeth marks, That gator could have swallowed you whole. What makes you so sure it was a gator ? What else could it be ? You're feeling better now, aren't you ? Yeah. The first days are the toughest,
