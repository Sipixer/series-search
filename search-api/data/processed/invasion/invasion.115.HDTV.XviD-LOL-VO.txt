Why did you kill your mother-in-law? If she wanted the baby, she could have had it. She was forcing it on me. What really happened to you that night in the water? Do you know? Well, you have children, too, don't you think you, at least, owe it to them to find out? I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. She's not your type. What does he know? You have a lot to learn. There's a little work camp down in the glades. I'm gonna send you there for a while, all right? I think you're in a lot of denial. You're just trying to control everything, trying to manage everyone, but you can't. You bastard! So you two work everything out? She's a very special girl, sir. Yes, she is. She's also a very young girl. In many ways, she's a very naive girl. What happens in the water? I don't know. Why hasn't it happened to me? Welcome to camp, darlin'. You're on the island of misfit toys, honey. Once we go through basic training, I'm comin' back with a vengeance. Invasion 1x15-The nest Transcript: Raceman Adaptation: Ez, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 Hey. Sorry I'm late. Stevie caught me sneaking out of the bunkhouse. The current's moving north. If we leave now, we could be home by morning. Who wants to go home? Me. I hate this place. I feel like a prisoner. Oh, come on. It's just temporary until the sheriff says we're ready to go back. Back for what? They keep telling us how special we are and how we have to function as a team. A team for what? What is the big plan? Survival. But if our bodies... if they really are different... uh-huh, they are. Then there has to be a purpose. Why won't they tell us our purpose? What the hell do you think you're doing? Damn you, stevie, you got no right tellin' us what to do. They aren't my rules, Derek, they're szura's! Szura's in charge! Whatever he says goes- - What'd you do that for? - 'Cause I'm tired of this crap. He look's bad, chris. It's his fault. Dumb ass. Someone's been telling me what to do all my life. No more. No more. I'm gettin' out of here. Chris, wait for me. Wait for me, chris! Were you just planning on never talking to me again? Kira... I called you ten times tonight. I know. I'm sorry. I just-things are kinda crazy right now. Crazy because my father told you to stay away from me? I just came from the water, lewis. I almost went in. I still may. I don't think you oughta do that. Why not? What is this big secret that everybody's keeping? You, my dad, my stepmother, you all went into the water and came out different. Yeah, but I don't think that's such a good thing. It kinda messed me up. But it's something that you share... that you all share together that makes you closer. I just want to know what that feels like. Will you come in the water with me? And you can just watch and let me know what happens. No. But I want it so bad, lewis. I just don't want to do it alone. Please. Please. I can't. I'm sorry, kira. You're not my friend. You're not my friend! Daddy? Hey, what are you doing up? I couldn't sleep. What are you doing? Nothing. Are you looking for monsters? No, honey. There's no monsters. It's okay. I'm not afraid, as long as they stay in the water. I offered to put her to bed, but she wanted you. Oh, it's okay. Hey, dad, if I'm gonna be living here full-time now, can I get a phone in my room, like at mom's? Uh, you know what? Can we talk about this in a second? All right. Do you brush your teeth? Yep. All right. Say good night to your brother. - Night, Jess! - Night, Rose! - Good night, Rosie. - Good night, Larkin. Can we call mommy? Um, you know, I think she's still at work. I miss her. Ohh, I know, honey. I liked it better when I lived at her house, too, when we shared. Why doesn't she want us there anymore, dad? She does. She loves you very much. Then why aren't we there? I have to tell them the truth. I can't keep dodging their questions. They miss their mother. They don't understand why they're not with her anymore. Well, what can you say? "Sorry, kids, but mom has been cloned "by alien light creatures, think she might try to kill you"? I don't know. Maybe I could just tell them that she's sick. You know, she... she got infected by something. I think that would just scare them. I think the truth would scare them even more. Yeah, well, we don't even know what the truth is. You know... Mariel's a doctor. Has she ever run any tests on herself? I don't know. I think you should insist that she have some tests run so we can at least know what we're dealing with here. Where, at the hospital? That'll raise too many questions. You could have her come to your station. You could do it. You wouldn't have a problem with that? Oh, honey. It's okay. I've accepted my new jean size, and I'm feeling much more secure. You can hang out with your ex-wife as long as you want to, just so long as you come home to me. And me. Excuse me. Hey, baby. No breakfast? Nobody called me. Well, we don't usually hand out formal invitations. You know, you pop down to the kitchen, pull up a- you told lewis not to talk to me anymore, didn't you? No, I-I mentioned that you were 17. I'm not looking to date him, dad, and I don't really think that's the issue, anyway. I mean, Derek was my age, and as soon as he came back from the water, you told him to stay away from me. Why? Because I knew... he'd never be right for you. Because he'd been changed, like you, like Mariel, like half this town, for all I know. Kira, kira. You are perfect the way you are. No, I'm not. Kira, come here. Russell, I can't come there now. Because I'm on my way to work. I understand the kids have questions, but- kira, wait, I want to talk to you. Of course I care. I'm just- listen-Mariel, would you talk to her, please? Kira! Derek. Well, hey, there, girlfriend. What's up? Christina, this is kira. oh, this is gonna be fun. There's no sign of her out here, lewis. Check logan's bay and I'm gonna head up the coast a bit, then I'll meet you back at the station, all right? roger that, sir. the sheriff is your daddy? Oh, if I'd have known you were banging her, I would have gotten us off that island a week ago. Yeah, right. Ooh, could I borrow your hoodie? Where have you been? Uh... just away. Away where? Derek was a bad boy and your daddy sent him to devil's island, and that's where he met me. And who are you? Christina. He calls me "Chrissie. " Isn't that sweet? So what were you doing in the water, daddy's girl? My name's kira. Okay. I wanted to know what was out there. Besides us? - You got a car? - Yeah. Where? Up there. I didn't want my dad to know I was here. Good thinking. Well, kira... we could use a ride, and you look like you could use some fun. Um, yeah, we-we can't go anywhere with her. Why not? Uh, because if her dad finds out- and what is he gonna do, arrest us? Not if he wants to keep his little operation on the downlow. But he could send us back, chris. Maybe not... not if we have kira here to protect us. You really want to know what "different" means? Yes. Then stick with us. We'll give you the whole show. Derek, we could use some clothes. How about you take us girls shopping? What do you think, kira, little shop-a-thon to kick the day off? All right. All right! Two hungry shoppers, ready to roll. I, um... I called the hospital and told them that I'd be in after lunch. I thought about what you said on the phone, and maybe this is a good idea. I'm glad you changed your mind. What do you want to do? Well, I think we should start with blood work. I know when jesse was at the hospital, there was some confusion in the lab about your blood. Mm-hmm, well, there's no confusion now. It's definitely changed. It has much higher levels of hemoglobin. I think that's why I can stay underwater for so long. I didn't know that you could. But none of this is really what you're concerned about, is it? You want to know if there's something inside me that's gonna hurt our kids. I just think we owe them an explanation as to why they're not with you anymore, and since we don't have all the answers yet... I don't want them to be afraid of me, russell. Are you afraid of what we'll find? M aybe. What is that? That is part of one of the light creatures from the water. I pulled it out of a dead alligator. It's got human D.N.A. I was hoping to compare its tissue with yours. Wow. All right. Oh, my god, this is cute. God, do you believe what they charge for these things? - Hell, they make 'em for a nickel in china. - That's why I never shop here. - It's way overpriced. - Seems almost illegal. I like that one... for you. hey, maybe next time, you can put it in my pants. Shut up. Hey, what are you doing? What are you, a size 2 I love this. there. Now we can be twins. They're not gonna let him out of here like that. Sheriff's daughter. I bet you've had to be a good girl all your life. Come on. It's fun... and that's a big part of being different, kira, having fun. Look, my buddy actually told me that they order extra crap because they know it's gonna get jacked. It's kind of expected. Right. It's like company policy. that's cute, that's cute. I like that. There... it feels good, doesn't it? Yeah, actually, it kinda does. I used to beg my husband to take me to places like this, but he never would. He just wanted to lock me in the double wide and make babies. Wait, you're married? Not anymore. Any news about your daughter, sir? No. When was the last time you saw kira? Last night. She came here to talk to me. She was upset 'cause I haven't returned any of her phone calls. I hope none of this is happening because of me. She can't be like us. She can never be like us. I wish she could. Have you ever really talked to her, sir? I mean, about your experience, after the plane crash? I- I know she was really young, but I think one of her problems is that she doesn't feel like she knows you. You're her dad, and she doesn't know you. That's gotta be painful for her. What do you got? Yeah, put her through, put her through. Someone's seen her. Hey, Ellen, what's up? You saw kira? With who? You are gonna love this place, beach action right on the sand. Oh, shoot. My friend forgot to leave me the key. Doesn't look like anyone else is here. Derek, do you think you could break this little window? Break it? Oh, sure. We'll get it fixed. - Yeah, no problem. - Thanks. - Who is this guy? - Oh, he's just a friend of mine. He's out of town right now. Does he know you're coming? Sure, he lets me use his house all the time. Wow. Yeah. It's nice, right? What does this guy do? Farmer. A farmer? Yeah, his family owns, like, 10,000 acres of avocado groves or something. Derek, do you want to put some music on? Yeah. Who wants guacamole and margaritas? Mmm. Me. Good. Kira, do you want to try that dress on, see how it fits? Okay. Um, where's the bathroom? Uh... right there. do, uh... you really know who lives here? Sure. He's that fat son of a bitch I used to work for at the plant who used to pinch my ass all the time. - So he doesn't know you're here? - Hell, no. - You always been like this? - Like what? - Insane? - Never. I used to be the perfect daughter. I was the perfect wife and the perfect mother... until I wasn't. Do you have any idea where your baby is? Nope. And you're okay with that? It wasn't my baby anymore, Derek. When I came out of the water, my body was brand-new... and much perkier, I might add. I agree. oh, what the hell? It's okay. Mr. Moldiva. Hey. Do you remember me? What the hell are you doin' in my house? Christina, from the plant. Yeah, this is my house! I know. It's-it's really- it's nice. Yeah. So... what do you think? Oh, my god! What are you doing?! Welcome home, mr. Moldiva. Maybe you'll be nicer to your employees in the next life. Christina... so... let's get this party started. Tthe security guard was going to call the police, but I told him I wanted to handle this personally. I appreciate that, Ellen. I recognize this boy. I think heas in heather's science class, but I don't know the girl. Sir, isn't that the woman we arrested- it's okay, lewis. - I'm sorry to have to show you this. - No, that's all right, Ellen. - May I have that tape, please? - Of course. I'll make sure that I get it back to you, and if there's any damage, of course- I don't care about that. - I'm just concerned about your daughter. - Yeah, me, too. Thanks. I'm certain I recognized that young woman, sir. I'm gonna share something with you, lewis, but you've gotta promise that it stays between us. The girl you saw in the videotape is the one who killed her mother-in-law, and the boy is a kid named Derek culie. He used to be a friend of kira's. He started messing around with me, so I sent him to a little work camp that I set up down in the keys. It's a place for people like us who've gone through a transformation, but who haven't quite... adapted yet. Did you send the girl there, too? Christina Conrad? Yeah. I- I thought she was turned over to the F.B.I. The law clearly states she s- the law does not apply here, lewis, because there's no precedent for our existence. If I'd allowed that girl to enter the prison system, the world would think that we all behaved like her, and we'd be vilified, and I cannot let that happen. I must protect my people. And your daughter, sir, how do we protect her? We find her. baby, would you get me one of those limes? We can't stay here, chris. Why not? Because that guy is dead. Are you afraid he's gonna stink? There's a swimming pool out back. You should dump him in there. Stop her. You stop her. - Sit down! - I want to leave. I said sit down! Goddamn it! Look what you made me do! - You're crazy. - Right. - Please just let me go. - No. Derek... come on, Christina, she doesn't have to be here. Yes, she does. I won't tell anyone what I saw, I promise. I don't care if you tell anyone, dumb ass, but I'm not goin' back to the island, and right now, you are all I have to trade if your daddy becomes a problem. Derek, will you please take mr. Moldiva out to the pool? You want me to touch him? I... oh, my god. Chris, he's dead. You killed him. He's dead. What's wrong? What's wrong? I don't know. She-she probably has a cell phone. Just take it from her, and don't you dare let her out of your sight. Ow. Okay, okay, comen, come on. Come on. Get away from me! Ow! Hey, chrissie? Chrissie, you all right? Get away! It's kinda like freshman year at U.M. Except is my blood we're testing, not some poor lab rat's. When was the last time you had your blood tested? When tom was in the hospital he needed blood, so I gave him mine. How are things between the two of you now? Better. Things were pretty intense for a while, but they've settled down... for the moment. Your white count's very high. Lymphocyte count, too. Is it higher than the last time you tested? Yeah, much. Could be an infection. I don't have a fever. Sed rate is 50. Oh, my god. After all I've been through, I'm sick now? Look, this could be a lot of things. Red cells have settled pretty fast. I have felt... a pressure in my abdomen lately. It's not pain. It's just pressure. If I were the doctor treating this patient, I would order an M.R.I. Then that's what we'll do. Where, at the hospital, the place where nobody's supposed to know what happened to me? We'll find a way. Come on, Mariel. We have to do this. I just really don't need any more surprises right now. The red cross guy who found Christina conrad after the hurricane said that she'd been wandering on the beach near king's rock. She'd gone to see some guy she used to work for, but he wasn't home or he wouldn't let her in or something, guy wasn't clear. All right, when we get in the car, I want you to find out the name of her former employer. You think that's where she's at? We all go back to the place we were born, lewis. Hey, um, are you sure you don't want anything? You know, anything at all? My dad was right about you. When he said he didn't want us hanging out anymore, I thought it was because he thought you were too good for me or something. That's not it at all. He was trying to protect me. Look, kira, I didn't want any of this. Then why don't you leave? Right now, get up and walk out of here. - I can't. - Why not? I- I don't know. She's a psychopath, Derek. Was she like this before, or is this something that happens to you in the water? - I didn't know her before. - Are you crazy now, too? No, no. No. It's not like that. - Well, then, what is it like? - I-I feel like myself, you know? The way I was before, just... more. Okay, so then if she was a little unstable before, she's a complete nut job now. You shouldn't call her that. Why are you sticking up for her? I just feel this connection with Christina. It's, like, very powerful, like the way your dad feels about your stepmom. You know, protective, that's- that's how I feel about Christina. Do you think she'd protect you? No way. I don't-I don't think... Fine. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - You can't do that. - Yes, I can. Damn it, kira, get back here. You want to leave? Okay, let's leave. Derek, get her keys. No... scratch that. We'll walk. Where are we going? To the beach. We're going to do a little science experiment, and if you try to run, I will do to you what I did to him. Derek, please stop this. He can't. He is my boyfriend now. He'll do exactly what i want. And what I want is to take kira for a swim. How about that? Kira, you said you wanted to know what was in the water. We only have about an hour before the tech gets back from dinner. Okay. You're gonna have to show me how to use this thing. Pretty straightforward. Once I'm down, just hit "rotate anterior," and that'll move the bed into the scanner... Then press "image," which will start the imaging process. Ready. Oh, my god. Uh, 211, we're gonna need an ambulance at- He's dead, lewis. Call the coroner. 211, inform the coroner of a homicide at 2010 edgecliff. The red cross guy said that Christina walked to this house the morning they found her. Yes, sir. That means her birthplace must be somewhere down the beach. Get the car, follow me on the sand! It's a tumor. Right there. Well... now I know why my blood count's so messed up. Oh, my god. We don't know that it's cancerous. Hell, we don't even know that it's a tumor. Everything in your body is completely different. This-this could be something entirely new. We're gonna have to take a needle biopsy, which we can do in my office. There's an ultrasound machine in emergency you can wheel in there. I'm not gonna be able to handle the needle myself, so if I talk you through it... Sure. How are we gonna tell the kids about this? We could have gotten matching bathing suits, but I think this is much more elegant, don't you? I'm not going in. Oh, yes, you are. You see, we've only been told what happens. We've never actually seen the process. Besides, I thought this is what you wanted, to be different. It really doesn't hurt, kira. Hold on. I think this is the place. Yeah. I think this is where it happened. It's okay, kira. This is a lot better than... anything else. And when we're done... you can tell your daddy that you're just like him now. I think he's gonna be so proud. We've been told that you're supposed to see some kind of orange light in the water. It's supposed to be kind of pretty. I don't have to be like you. What? Even if I'm changed, I don't have to be like you. I won't be. When we get a clear shot at the mass, you should be able to guide the needle right into it. You want cells from the periphery, right? Yeah, but just make sure it's a good sample. Russell... if this biopsy shows that it's malignant, I want you to take jesse and rose. Hey, look, I don't want to talk about this right now. Listen to me-I want you to take them, and I want you to leave homestead. Why? 'Cause I don't want this to happen to them. Well, I don't know if it could, but regardless, if you're sick, they're gonna want to be with you... and so will I. You're their mother. Okay, just right here. Okay. Listen, hey, try to relax. With alligators, I'm pretty good, but with ex-wives, I get a little shaky. Where's my daughter? We dropped her off in town. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. What are you doing? Where is she? Let go of her, man. Where is she?! She's still out there in the water, come on, man! Lewis, lewis, go! You know, I never pegged you for stupid. Reckless, maybe, trash, definitely, but I thought you were way smarter than this. You can't do anything to me. No one can! If any harm should come to my baby, No! - No, you're hurting her now! - No, I'm not. Sir, I found her! What? What, baby? Tell me! I don't know. It's happening again! Tell me what's wrong. What? Ow! I think I'm pregnant, you son of a bitch Get me out of here, now! We need to get the car. Kira... all right, kira. Come on. Oh, god. Oh, god, kira. Get up. Come on, baby. It's okay. It's okay. All right. All right, here we go. Here we go. It's all right, baby. It's okay. Here we go. It's not cancer.
