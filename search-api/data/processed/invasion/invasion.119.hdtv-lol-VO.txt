down in the glades that an old friend of mine runs-a mr. Szura. I want to find out why the air force is down here, and if there's a cover-up, who's involved. According to my contact, they were after a missing weather plane. How many crew members from that weather plane you have locked in this place ? All of them. What are you doing with them? Testing them. They really are amazing creatures. They aren't creatures. I'm worried about Jesse. They're hybrid bastards, mom. - You wanna go? - Come on, bring it. Jesse, give me the gun. No way. The gun's mine. Invasion 1x19 - The son also rises Transcript: RaceMan Adaptation: Ez, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76 Dad. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. It's not loaded. Where are the bullets? In the tackle box. - Hey! - Hey, nothing! - What are you so pissed about? - This! Well, I've had it for a while now! Why is it bugging you? Because you shot it- while you were drinking. You were shooting at pictures of your mom?! What is wrong with you? Why are you sneaking in my room? You got no right to come in here and do that. That gun is mine! My other father gave that to me. Your other father is a sick bastard! And the only reason that i let you keep this gun is because you promised you'd keep it in the display box! I better not ever hear about you shooting any gun again. - You understand me? - How are you supposed to hear about it when you're not around? I haven't seen or heard from you in two days, dad! And if you're so concerned about our family, then why don't you check in on us once in a while?! I've been out of range. Oh. Oh! And now that you're in range, your wife tells you that I've gone all columbine! And isn't that nice- now I got another stepparent I can count on! She is worried about you, Jesse. We all are! You got bigger things to worry about than me, dad! In case you haven't heard, the town has gone "night of the living dead." Half the people aren't even human anymore! And from what I understand, my stepfather likes it that way! So if you want to be pissed off at somebody, why don't you be pissed at him?! I am. Where you going now? I'm going out. Russell, you just got back. Russell! Mariel... what are you doing? Cleaning. - It's 2:00 in the morning. - I couldn't sleep. You know, this could be a really useful space for us. Besides your guns, we could keep all kinds of supplies in here. Never hurts to be prepared. Prepared for what? Rainy day? Instinct is everything. Instinct is the key to survival. Most people distrust their instinct. They discount their inner voice because they allow their brain to rationalize that voice away. Well, we're not "most people" anymore. I didn't ask any of you to meet me on this beach, but here you are. Because you knew something was amiss tonight. You're feeling anxious. You should be. The threat from the outside that I've repeatedly warned you about is upon us now, and now is the time for us to take advantage of this incredible gift that we have been given... for us to rise up and act as one! Has the whole world gone insane?</i> It's the middle of the night, and I can hear</i> my hybrid stepmother downstairs scrubbing the closet floor while my hybrid father hands her dishrags.</i> Is this urge to disinfect part of your D.N.A. Now, too, or is it just that my family is still crazier than everyone else's? All families are crazy, Kira. Some just hide it better than others. So you're not in your bathroom, secretly fighting soap scum? No. though... I have been feeling a little restless tonight. I feel better now, though, talking to you.</i> I miss you, Lewis. How's, uh, school? Weird. All the kids are different now. Like me? No, not like you. They're not as nice. And a lot of them used to be my friends.</i> Oh. I'm sorry. It's like you can really feel these two totally separate groups forming.</i> And I'm worried that my stepbrother Jesse's going to a dark place with it all. Who is that? I have no idea. Russell. Do you have any idea what time it is? Tom? I don't think your wife's gonna like what I have to say. Russell, what are you doing here? Are the kids all right? Yeah, they're fine. We're just-we're having a little problem in the park. I was hoping that Tom could help before things really get out of control. Your buddy Szura is a murderer. He's killed at least four people that I know of, two of whom you sent to his island. I know all about the place, Tom. And tomorrow, the world's gonna know about it, too. Who has he killed, Russ? Christina Conrad, Derek Cooley... probably father Scanlon by now. I sent them to the island because he promised me he would protect them. - Do you ever get tired of lying? - I'm not lying! What, do you think you know it all? Maybe Szura was trying to protect himself. I don't know. I wasn't there. Is that the same reason you gave Jesse a gun? So he can "protect" himself? This has nothing to do with Jesse. Those people needed to be contained. The priest tried to kill me- what are you doing? Maybe you deserved it. You know, I'm sick of your games! This is no game! You are destroying my family, you son of a bitch! I'm trying to save your family, you stupid bastard! You may be stronger than we are, but i know you can die. Go ahead, kill me. Come on, Russ, do it. Do it, come on. Do it. You wanna do it, do it. Do it. - I can't! - Why not?! Because it's not loaded! I am done keeping the big secret, Tom. I mean, people are dying. You may not be killing them yourself, but you are party to it. You really don't get it, do you? I'm not your problem! Do you realize the military knows about those creatures in the water since '96? Since my plane crash. I've seen the pictures. - What pictures? - From hangar 42. Szura with the N.T.S.B... Szura with the wreckage. Szura with all the air force brass-I've seen them all. Your partner's a very popular guy. - Szura... with the military? - Come on, Tom. You can't keep denying it. Where are you going? - Find out what the hell he's doing. - You're too late for that. I already have a team going out to that island to pick him up. And when they do, you're gonna have a lot of questions to answer. This doesn't end with Szura, Tom. This ends with you! Are you sure you don't wanna bring anyone else along, sir? No, no, the fewer people who know about this, the better. But this island's pretty isolated. - What if mr. Szura- - Hey, outside. Come on. What if mr. Szura doesn't want to talk to us, sir? I don't give a damn what he wants. Is he really capable of murder, sir? We're all capable, Lewis. We all have the potential to go to our darkest place, but most of us manage to leave a light on. It's all in here- the hybrids' master plan. Everything-it's in here. Thought it was Szura's master plan. Well, he wrote it, but he had a lot of help. "The appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old ones are bound together." - You know who said that? - A magician? Charles darwin. Who's he? He's a dead english guy. Listen to your music. Did you know that 95% of all the species that once lived on this planet have died out? That blows my mind. Basically, the overriding message of this whole plan is that the hybrids are the chosen people, and our extinction is inevitable. And who knows what the fourth element is? Rose. Water. W-a-t-e-r. Excellent. Okay, so there they are. Those are the four elements- earth, air, fire and water. So what do you guys think they represent? Balance. The balance between all things in nature. For the world to function effectively, you must always have balance- economic balance, ecological balance, the balance between life and death. Ms. Wade, some of us don't know what you're talking about. Who can tell me what this word means? - How's life, man? - Beautiful. - You still living in your car? - Nah, I moved up. My grandmother's house got red-tagged, so now I'm sLeeping in her rubble. Sweet. At least I went a whole morning without getting my ass kicked. Oh, yeah, that's good. That's good, man. That's real good. Nice face, man. You're looking good. What's so damn funny?! Come on. Come on, man. Well, that was real subtle. Screw 'em, man. I feel like I'm in occupied france. The trains are rolling, man, and nobody is doing anything to stop them. My sister was almost drowned yesterday. They pulled her into the pool and held her under until she passed out. Was my girlfriend a part of that? Oh, yeah, she's one of 'em, too, now. Looks like I'll be looking for a new prom date. They're not all bad. Everyone's just scared 'cause they don't know what's going on right now. And you do? Not completely, but I'm not afraid. Maybe that's 'cause your boyfriend's one of 'em. He's not my boyfriend. Really? She hangs out with this guy who's my stepdad's deputy. He's 26. This isn't about Lewis, Jesse. Why don't you mind your own business, okay? Then why don't you? We can't just let this keep happening. 'Cause pretty soon, there's not gonna be any of us left. What about talking to your stepdad? Are you kidding me? The guy is one of 'em, too. Well, you said he's been this way for a long time. Maybe he knows how to stop it. He doesn't want to stop it. He took my mother to the water and made her the way that she is. And your dad, man-he probably took him to the water. And maybe he took your girlfriend. Who knows? He may have done this to everybody. Frank. - Hey. - Hey, Russ. Hey. I thought we were gonna meet down at the chief's office. Mona, could you give us a couple of minutes? Thank you. Â¿Que pasa? How are you? I've had better days. I've heard, um, Mona said you were pretty stressed out lately. What's up, frank? Well, um, after I got your call last night, we went through the whole mess with the coast gard. And this morning, the chief talked to the sheriff about- He talked to underlay? Why? - Because he's the sheriff, Russell- - He's also a murderer. Mira, the chief doesn't quite see it that way. Matter of fact, he thinks you've overstepped here. He thinks i overstepped? And this relief worker Dennison that you want arrested? His name is Szura. Whatever. He's very close to the chief. What? Yeah, and apparently, underlay knows and respects the guy as well. Oh, no, no... Frank, come on, man. Don't do this to me. Not you, too. Underlay said he's willing to go to this island and check things out for us. Underlay is the reason Szura is on the island. He's the reason all of this has happened. All of what? All of what, Russell? Yeah, I'll go talk to the chief myself. - He won't see you. - He doesn't understand the situation. You don't understand! The chief is not gonna talk to you! Â¿Me entiendes? In fact, he doesn't wanna even see you around here anymore. What are you saying? He's placing you on administrative leave. He just thinks that you should take some time and go home and be with your family. Frank... you listen to me, okay? None of us will have any family left if we don't do something. Â¿Me entiendes? I'm sorry. Did you sell me out? Did you tell Vargas you thought I should be taken off the job? Of course not. Well, then what did you say? That you've been working 24-7 since the hurricane, and that you've been having some issues at home. What issues? I work with you every day. The kids, your ex-wife, the sheriff, your wife. I've seen every side of the equation. None of that has affected my ability to do my job. I didn't say that it did, Russ. I think you're the best person I've ever worked with. You've got knowledge and character both. And I respect the hell out of you. Then what'd you say to him? That I love you and I'm afraid for you, Russ. I'm afraid for you and your family. Why? Because I know what's happening in town, and you can't stop it. It's the way things are supposed to be, Russ. You can't stop change like this. You can only live your life the best way you can and hope that whatever you leave behind has some value. Are you... one of them? Does it matter? Can I put my stuff in your locker? Sure. Why? I got about ten hybrids blocking mine. Maybe we should talk to your stepdad, Jess. What for? He'll do what you said. He'll try and stop this. - Dude, he's not gonna talk to us. - Maybe we can make him talk. Look, I know some guys. They might want to help us out. - What kind of guys? - Guys who can make people talk, even when they don't want to. You know where he is? Yeah, he went on some boat trip. He's gonna be back around 6:00. Where's he keep his boat? Black point Marina. Look, Brett, I don't like the guy at all. And I don't trust him at all, but, I mean, he is my stepdad. And he's the sheriff. Yeah, the sheriff that killed your mother. Look, my father finally kicked my mother out last night. I knew it was coming, but... come on, man, she called me crying. Crying like crazy... wanting to know if she could stay with me. What am I supposed to do with that, man? What am I supposed to do when she calls me, crying on the phone because my hybrid father kicked her out on the street? I just want some answers, man. Are you sure he didn't know we were coming, sir? Yes. I just searched those bypasses again. Everyone's gone. Place is completely deserted. Do you have any idea where they could have gone? Yes, Lewis, I do. I do. "God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life." That's Szura. And he's quoting the old testament. So he's using all of the big ideas to rally the troops, right? Yeah. But to what end? I mean, his book definitely supports the notion that evolution is inevitable. And the book is called "robin hood and the cambrian explosion." And robin hood says the best way to get the job done is guerilla-style. Robin had sherwood forest to do all his dirty work in. What does Szura have? The island. The water. When Russell and i were in Szura's bunker, we found a downlink station where they were monitoring the temperatures in the ocean. We thought maybe they were checking up on the lake creatures. But what if they were actually tracking the currents for themselves? Yeah, but for what purpose? I don't know. I don't know, maybe to ride into town on the crest of a giant... wait... look. There's a storm developing in the southern caribbean. Okay. The lights came in during the hurricane, right? And hybrids are basically amphibious, so wouldn't it stand to reason if you were a hybrid psychopath planning an invasion, you might do it under the cover of a storm? Hey. Front door was open. Oh, thanks. Tom is not here. I know. I got suspended from my job. Apparently, somebody at the top thinks I've become a liability. I'm sorry. Yeah, well... I... I'm thinking about going out of town for a while, and I want to take the kids. What about school? I'll get their books, their homework. I'll work with them. - Where are you gonna go? - I don't know yet. Okay, um... well, just tell me... when you're going, when you'll be back. I'd like you to consider coming with us. Mariel, whatever's happened in this town, I'm certain that it's not accidental. These changes have a purpose, and I'm afraid that that purpose is about to be realized. Did you ever tell Tom what's inside of you now? That you're basically carrying enough eggs to spawn an entirely new species on your own? - Not yet. - So what if you get pregnant? - That is really not your problem. - I disagree. You saw Christina. That girl had a litter growing inside of her. You think she could have survived? - It's not your problem! - I think it's all of our problem! And for our kids' sake, just think about what I'm saying. So does larkin know you're here? No, but she will. What about my husband? Is he invited to come on this little trip you're planning? I suspect he'll have other plans. I don't understand why you keep doing this to me, Russell. He's my husband! Whether you like it or not, he is my husband! - I know, Mar- - Get out of here. - Mariel- - Get out of my house! Just think about what I said. So you told Mariel everything and she wouldn't listen to you ? No. Your job... is this permanent? I don't know. They're all in on it. Szura, Underlay, the chief, the air force... You're Silkwood, man. You're Karen Silkwood- blowing the whistle the nobody wants to hear, you know what I mean? - Where's Jesse? - He's at his friend's. He called. He said he wasn't gonna be home for dinner. - What's he doing? - Daddy? Which state do you go to when you die? What? Our teacher told us that when we die, we leave our bodies and go to another state. Which one is it? Your second grade teacher taught you this? Yeah. - "The balance of life and death"? - It's my homework. - Who's this teacher? - She's new. Well, maybe it's time for a little parent-teacher conference, eh, Russ? Did Jesse tell you where he was going? No, but he promised he wouldn't be late. - Russell, where are you going? - I'm gonna go find him. Russell, come back here! You're not doing this again! You can't just keep leaving without giving me an explanation for what's going on. You know what's going on. Yeah! And it's affecting all of us. Me, dave, your daughter, your son- we're all feeling it. So stop acting like you're the only one trying to hold things together. You're not. I'm sorry. It's just a lot, you know? I do. Look, when Jesse called, he was with his friend Brett. I think I have his parents' number if you wanna try to call them. Okay. They got him about ten minutes after the boat came in. He was tying it up. Got him how? They said they knew what he was, that they just wanted to talk. - And he was cool with that? - I guess so. He's waiting for us. - What is this place? - It's my grandmother's. Nice, huh? You could thank F.E.M.A. Yo, man, what's up? Where is he? Swimming. What? Yeah, he was cool till we got him here, then he wouldn't give us his gun. So we took it from him. Oh, man! Oh, my god. Now I know he's not the sheriff. But a deputy's almost as good, right? Oh, come on, Lee! Man, what'd you do? I told you we just wanted to talk to the man, and this ain't even him. Oh, chill, man, he's fine. Hey, deputy. If you can hear me, raise your hand. Honey! Kira! - Is anybody here? - Back here, dad. Hey, Kira. Have you seen your... - stepmother? - She's at work, I think. What is all this? Does she know something we don't? We gotta get him to the hospital! Hey, Lee, this is messed up, man. Where's his radio? His radio's not here! What'd you do with it? - Beats me. - Damn it! - We don't need a radio. - Don't need a phone, either. hey! Hey! Stop! Hey, man, stop it! You stop it! Jeez, man, what the hell's wrong with you?! Oh, you want some? Huh? Back up, monkey. Back it up! Where's the radio?! Hey, man... - hey! Hey! Hey! - Where's the damn radio?! Put it on channel one and call my dad or stepdad, anybody! You come here! - Where? - Move! - What the hell are you doing? - You're going swimming! You wanna push people around?! You want to take over the world?! - I'm not one of them! - I don't care! Jesse! Jesse !! How much of this was Jesse? According to the other boys, he tried to stop it. How are they? One of them has a few broken ribs, but he'll be all right. Russell may have saved them all... Tom. Is he still here? Yeah, he's in my office with Jesse. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. I know. Water and batteries won't help. They help me. Kira. Everyone's gonna blame me for this, aren't they? I can't speak for anyone else. Do you? What did you think was gonna happen tonight, Jess? I don't know. I guess... - I didn't care. - Do you care now? I'm sorry that I haven't been around as much as you need me to be. And I'm really sorry about what's happened to your mom. But she's still your mom. And I'm still your dad. And no matter what, nothing's ever gonna change that, Jesse. She is still your mom. Okay? I don't wanna live here anymore, dad. Okay. Okay? Yeah, I pretty such got fired today, so... I'm up for anything. I was actually thinking that we should all take a trip. Where? Someplace dry. Hey, Russ. Can I talk to you for a second? Hey, Tom, I'm, uh... sorry about Lewis. I know you are, Jess. Is he gonna be all right? Uh, that may be up to us. Russ? My turn to take you for a ride tonight. - Where are we going? - Gas station. I want to show you something. It's been like this all day. They're all hybrids- the people, not the cars. I got home tonight and discovered that Mariel had packed the place to the rafters with emergency supplies. So I called a few stores around town, and all the major outlets have run out of water, tarps and batteries, so I drove to one of them. All hybrids there, too. Is there another hurricane coming? But nobody knows it. People... are just feeling it. These people are feeling it. But it's the rest of the people that I'm worried about. Szura's gone, Russell. I went out to that island this morning, and he and his group, they're just gone. Now I don't know what he's planning. But if we get hit with a storm- it's anything like eve was, everyone is gonna be distracted. Why are you telling me all this? Because I'm gonna need your help to stop him. What happened to Lewis is gonna happen again till we find a way to coexist. And right now... I'm just a little short on people I can trust. Yeah? Tom? It's him. where are you? In transit. There's some issues I need to discuss with you. Yeah, well, I got some issues I need to discuss with you, too. Put it on speaker. I had to leave the island. That ranger is a real pain in the ass. Where have you taken everyone? I'd rather discuss this in person.</i> Could we meet for breakfast tomorrow?</i> Eli... and, Tom... I know you're with him. All right. What do you want to do? - Thank you, miss. - You're welcome. - Is yours still not working? - Afraid not.
