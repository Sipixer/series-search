BE RIGHT BACK. -WHAT? -HOW IS HE? HE'S TERRIBLE. HE'S BLEEDING TO DEATH. WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE HIM INTO SURGERY. YOU CAN'T LET HIM DIE. I'VE TALKED TO SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS FAR MORE ABOUT THIS THAN YOU DO. HE TOLD ME IN OTHER PLACES WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN CHANGED DURING A HURRICANE, ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HAVE TURNED IN ON THEMSELVES. THERE'S BEEN MASS MURDERS,SUICIDE... WELL,WHO IS THIS PERSON? SOMEBODY WHO'S SEEN IT,WHO'S SEEN THE WORST. HE THINKS TOM MAY BE WHAT'S MAKING THE DIFFERENCE HERE BECAUSE HE'S HAD SO MANY YEARS TO ADAPT, HE MAY BE ACTING LIKE A STABILIZING FORCE FOR THE OTHERS. -THAT'S CRAZY. -WHAT ISN'T CRAZY? HE'S NOT LIVING IN THE BODY HE WAS BORN IN,NEITHER ARE YOU, BUT HE HAS SURVIVED,FAR LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE WE KNOW OF. PLEASE,MARIEL,EVEN- EVEN IF I'M WRONG, UNTIL WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS, THEN YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SAVE HIS LIFE. HE'S MY HUSBAND,RUSSELL. WHAT ELSE WOULD I DO? WHAT ELSWOULD I DO? SO IS UNDERLAY GONNA MAKE IT? I DON'T KNOW. DID YOU TELL MARIEL WHAT HEALY SAID? -YEAH.\-AND? I HAVE TO GO TO WORK. VAL JUST CALLED. SHE WANTS ME TO DO A PROFILE ON TOM AT THE 11:00. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY? WHAT I KNOW. YOU KNOW A LOT. WELL,WHAT IF TOM GOT SHOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS? WHAT IF THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DANGER NOW,TOO? MARIEL MIGHT NOT WANT HER SECRET OUT, BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. SO AM I. THEN LET ME GO ON TELEVISION AND TELL THE TRUTH. IT COULD BE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE. WHAT ABOUT THEM? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR MOTHER,LARKIN. THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW,LARKIN MIGHT BE RIGHTRUSS. THIS COULD BE TOO BIG TO KEEP QUIET. HELL,I MEAN,KIRA COULD BE ONE OF THEM. ONE OF WHAT? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT,HERE? WHAT? COME ON,DAVE,YEAH,FINE. THESE PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED,OKAY? BUT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY'RE A THREAT TO US, I'M NOT GONNA START HANGING EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,CAN YOU STAY HERE AND WATCH THE KIDS? WHERE YOU GOING? HEALY WANTS TO SEE ME IN PERSON. WHAT? HEY,WHAT IF TOM DOESN'T MAKE IT? WELL,THEN MAYBE NONE OF THIS WILL MATTER. HIS TEMPERATURE'S SPIKING. IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU WAITED OUTSIDE. NO,I WANT TO STAY HERE WITH HIM. PULSE OX IS 80. HE'S HAVING A REACTION TO THE BLOOD. -PRESSURE'S DROPPING. -STOP THE TRANSFUSION. HE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN. NO! IT'S NOT-NOT- WE CAN TRY AUTOLOGOUS TRANSFUSION WITH A CELL SAVER. NO! NO! NO! NO! -GIVE HIM MY BLOOD. -YOURS? -WE'RE THE SAME TYPE. -BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE- PLEASE. JUST DO IT. -I- I REALLY HAVE TO GO. -NO,MARIEL,PLEASE. PLEASE,WAIT. WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME? WHEN I CAN. YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 16 HOURS. YOUR SON MISSES YOU,I MISS YOU. JUST TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG. I HAVE TOLD YOU. I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU FOR SO LONG, BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT HEARING ME. I KNOW. YOU'RE UNHAPPY,OKAY? I'M SORRY. I'M UNHAPPY. BUT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT. KILLING YOURSELF AT WORK ISN'T THE ANSWER. IF YOUOULD JUST-HEY- COME ON,COME ON. COME WITH ME. LET'S TALK TO FATHER SCANLON. OKAY? I LOVE YOU,RUSSELL, AND I LOVE OUR LITTLE BOY MORE THAN ANYTHING, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND RIGHT NOW,I WOULD JUST REALLY RATHER BE HERE, I'M SORRY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE NEWS, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE THE SHOOTER. WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME THE EX-HUSBAND HAS GONE AFTER THE NEW GUY. YOU WANT SOME COFFEE? NO,THANKS. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? SHE'S DEAD. YOU KNOW WHO KILLED HER? HIS NAME IS ELI SZURA. HE USED TO DO CONTRACT WORK FOR THE C.I.A. WITH ME. WE WERE SENT DOWN TO CUBA RIGHT AFTER HURRICANE CHARLEY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE LIGHTS IN THE WATER AND SEE HOW WE MIGHT MANAGE THEM. -MANAGE THEM HOW? -FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. SO THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS? OF COURSE,AND I'M SURE TH'RE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WELL,WHY AREN'T THEY DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SZURA AND I WERE HIRED SO THAT THE MILITARY COULD KEEP THEIR HANDS CLEAN. IT'S LIKE THEY WANT TO KEEP TABS ON THIS. THEY WANT TO STAY ON TOP OF IT, BUT IF IT BLOWS UP IN THEIR FACES, THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. THAT'S THE REASON WHY I THINK UNDERLAY IS SO IMPORTANT. NOW HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS, TO CONTROL THINGS- HE'S KEPT HIS WIFE AT BAY, HE STARTED THAT SURVIVORS GROUP, HE MIGHT HAVE EVEN CONVINCED THE MILITARY THAT THEY NEED HIM. BUT IF THIS TURNS INTO CUBA OR BRAZIL... THEN A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE DEAD, BUT THE GOVERNMENT'LL STILL HAVE DENIABILITY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO IT,THE ALIENS DID. OH,MY GOD. I'VE GOTTA GET MY FAMILY OUT OF HERE. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO? YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA END HERE IN HOMESTEAD? IF THESE HYBRIDS BECOME THE MAJORITY, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. NO,AS FAR AS I SEE IT,YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE- YOUR CHOICE IS TO STAY HERE AND FIGHT THIS. YOU KILL THESE THINGS IN THE WATER, STOP THIS FROM GROWING AND FIND OUT WHAT THE MILITARY'S REAL AGENDA IS. -WHAT ABOUT MY EX-WIFE? -WHAT ABOUT HER? WHAT,ARE U SUGGESTING I KILL HER,TOO? RUSSELL,I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HEARING ME. WE'RE IN A FRAGILE SITUATION HERE THAT COULD EXPLODE AT ANY TIME, AND IF SZURA HAS HIS WAY, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. WELL,WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON? HIS OWN. HE GOT TAKEN WHEN WE WERE IN CUBA AND HE'S BEEN HUNTING ME EVER SINCE. HE'LL KILL ANYBODY HE VIEWS AS A THREAT TO HIS OWN SAFETY, THAT MAY EVEN INCLUDE UNDERLAY. BUT UNDERLAY'S A HYBRID.SO? DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE THE SA. SZURA WAS A SOCIOPATHIC SON OF A BITCH BEFORE HE GOT TAKEN AND THIS H ONLY EMPOWERED HIM. IF UNDERLAY IS SADDAM,SZURA IS ZARQAWI. HE'S NOT GONNA SIT BACK AND LET THE MILITARY RUN THINGS. HE'S GONNA WANT TO TAKE CHARGE. HOW IS IT THAT YOU WEREN'T TAKEN? I GOT SPIT OUT. I'M NOT A WELL MAN,RUSSELL. I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. THEY DON'T TAKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SICK. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. MY WIFE IS ABOUT TO GO ON THE NEWS AT 11:00 TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS WHOLE THING. THEN YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO STOP HER... BEFORE SZURA DOES IT FOR YOU. I*****************IT I WANT US TO FIND SOMETHING THAT UNDERSCORES TOM'S COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AND HIS YEARS OF SERVICE. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOTAGE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO '96. THIS IS HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE RIGHT AFTER THE PLANE CRASH. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME LIVE OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL. I DO. WE'LL RUN A HERO PIECE AND THEN YOU CAN DO THE WRAP UP FROM THERE. HE SHOULD BE OUT OF SURGERY BY THEN. YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO TOM,AREN'T YOU? HE'S HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. SINCE THE HURRICANE? I CAN PUT SOMEONE ELSE ON THIS IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE OBJECTIVE. NO. I CAN BE OBJECTIVE. I'LL WANT TO SEE IT BEFORE IT RUNS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME HERE. -I HAVE TO GO. -I KNOW. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE,REMEMBER THIS. REMEMBER HOW IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST MET. TOM... THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF ROUGH DAYS AHEAD, A LOT OF CHANGES. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'LL GET THROUGH IT... IS IF WE REMEMBER. HI. YOU'RE HERE? SO ARE YOU. YOU SAVED ME...AGAIN. YOU SAVED YOU. THE DOCTORS SAY THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A BODY FIGHT SO HARD TO LIVE. YOU'RE ALREADY HEALING,TOM. YOU GAVE ME YOUR BLOOD? HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED? I DIDN'T. WHERE'S MY CLOTHES? THEY'RE IN MY OFFICE. MY KEYS... SHOULD BE WITH THEM. GET MY KEYS... AND GO HOME. WHY? 'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO GET ME SOMETHING... FROM THE CLOSET. WHAT'S IN IT? EVERYTHING. THEIR REPORT IS TWO MINUTES,AND THEN WE GO LIVE! ALL RIGHT! HEY,HE MADE IT,YOU KNOW? UNDERLAY. JUST CAME OVER THE WIRE,HE MADE IT THROUGH SURGERY. I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAD WITH THAT... UNLESS YOU GOT SUSPECTS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. DO THE POLICE EVEN HAVE ANY SUSPECTS? LARKIN! GO SET UP,I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU. LOOK,YOU CAN'T DO THIS. -I HAVE TO. -NO,I JUST GOT BACK FROM HEALY'S. RUSSELL,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THIS HEALY PERSON IS. OKAY,IT DOESN'T MATTER,ALL RIGHT? THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU GO PUBLIC WITH THIS, NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA BACK THE STORY. YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG. THE MILITARY IS INVOLVED. SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SAVING ANY LIVES BY TALKING NOW,LARKIN,BUT YOU MIT BE KILLING US. THERS A GUY OUT HERE THAT DOESN'T WANT THIS STORY TOLD. I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOU TO PROTECT MARIEL,I DO. NO,IT'S NOT ABOUT MARIEL ANYMORE. BUT I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT HER ANYMORE. I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT US AND OUR BABY. AND I'M SORRY IF THIS MEANS THAT THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GET HURT. IT'S GONNA HURT ALL OF US,NOT JUST THE KIDS,LARKIN. I HAVE TO DO THIS. I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE. THANK YOU. -I WAS SO SCARED,DADDY. -I KNOW. I'M SORRY... FOR EVERYTHING. YOU LOOK AMAZING,TOM. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SHOT. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HANGIN' AROUND, BUT IT'S GETTIN' KINDA LATE,YOU KNOW? MAYBE YOU OUGHTA BE GETTIN' HOME. SHERIFF,MR. VARON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. SEND HIM IN. HEY. WE TRIED TO FIND YOU. CAN YOU GUYS GIVE US A MINUTE? EVERYBODY WAS JUST TAKING OFF. ALL RIGHT,GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU ALL SOON. GOOD NIGHT,BABE. GOOD-BYE,JESS. GOOD NIGHT,TOM. TOM,I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME. MY WIFE'S ABOUT TO GO LIVE WITH A STORY I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TOLD, A STORY BIGGER THAN YOUR SHOOTING. AND FOR NOW,IT'S A STORY I'M WILLING TO KEEP TO MYSELF, BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP. IS THAT THE BACKGROUND YOU WANT? -YEAH,THIS LOOKS GREAT. -ALL RIGHT. AND SO WE'RE GOOD,TWO MINUTES OR SO. LARKIN.DID YOU HEAR TOM'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? YEAH,IT'S GREAT NEWS. LARKIN,LOOK... HE'S A GOOD MAN. I KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS ABOUT BOTH OF US LATELY, BUT HE'S A GOOD MAN. 90 SECONDS. YEAH. RUSSELL STILL HERE? -UH,HE'S INSIDE. -MARIEL? I WAS GOING THROUGH SOME VIDEO FOOTAGE TONIGHT, AND I... AND I SAW YOU... HERE,ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO... WITH TOM. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU TWO WENT SO FAR BACK. YOU WERE STILL MARRIED TO RUSSELL THEN,WEREN'T YOU? I WAS. HE'S A GOOD MAN,TOO. YEAH. YOU KNOW I HAD A SECRET ABOUT WHO I AM, I BEGGED HIM TO KEEP FOR ME... BUT HE WOULDN'T DO IT. HE TOLD YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE MORE IMPORTANT. HEY,LARKIN. WE'RE GONNA GO LIVE IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS. I'M SORRY. IN EIGHT,SEVEN, SIX... YEAH. FIVE... FOUR,THREE,TWO,ONE. WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THIS MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH, ALL THAT HE'S ENDURED, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION- WHAT MAKES HIM DIFFERENT? WHEN I SPOKE WITH HOSPITAL OFFICIALS TODAY FOR COMMENT,DOCTOR- RUSSELL CAME BY AND ASKED ME TO CALL VAL AT THE NEWS STATION TO TRY TO GET ME TO... CONVINCEER TO PULL THE PLUG ON LARKIN'S BIG... STORY. I COULDN'T REACH HER. DID YOU FIND THE BOX? YEAH. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU OPENED THAT,DID YOU? I DID. AND WHAT DID YOU FIND? HOPE. OH. IN RECENT WEEKS, SINCE HURRICANE EVE HAS HIT US ALL SO HARD... TURNING SO MANY LIVES UPSIDE DOWN. WE'VE ALL HAD TO REASSESS... REASSESS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, AND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS FAMILY... AND THE PEOPLE WE LOVE. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT TOM UNDERLAY UNDERSTOOD ALL ALONG. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS. THIS IS LARKIN GROVES WITH THE CHANNEL 7 I-TEAM, REPORTING LIVE FROM HOMESTEAD HOSPITAL. AND WE'RE CLEAR. THANKS. HEY. I LOVE YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAY HERE,RUSSELL. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE STORY, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAY HERE. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. COME ON.
