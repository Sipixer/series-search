to rebuild this community as we rebuild ourselves. Some of us will rise to the challenge. Others won'T. if the military is working on something secret down here, I want to know about it. I went out on a limb for you. If you want to be a good reporter,talk to me. Just don't tell anyone you're doing it. You have all been given a second chance on life, and I encourage you not to squander it. Tom,what the hell does that mean? What is happening to all these people? we will all ultimately survive. Man,it's hot. How do I get a transfer to glacier national? Oh,yeah. I could just see you up there tagging grizzlies. Just gets hotter out here every year. we're getting close. Well,hello,boris. Do you see him? Yep. Looks like he made it through the storm safe and sound. Still tagged,still fat and happy. Hey,russ. Check it out! Auxilio! Auxilio! Ayudame,por favor! Auxilio. Ayudame. Estan perdidos todos. All right. Here you go,sir. Just have a seat. no pude salvar a mi familia. There you go. What did he say? Did he lose his family in the hurricane? Que paso? Perdiste tu familia en el huracan? ...es de havana. He came from havana. Anoche vio las luces. He saw lights? Luces? Eran luces en el agua? Lights in the water? Y despues? No pude salvar a mi familia. No pude salvar a mi familia. what did he say? He couldn't save his family. Okay,roosevelt,this is the last bag of ice we have before jesse brings us some more,okay? Okay. There you go you want to try,uncle dave? Mnh-mnh. No,thanks. I don't want to lose my natural musk. hey. You ready for my presentation? Yeah,I kinda gotta work,dave. This is about your work. This is where russell and i spotted our first E.B.E. What does that mean? That is an extraterrestrial biological entity. Russell thinks it's a fish. Okay,we'll pretend it's a fish. This is russell's ranger station,okay? This is where he found that bloody air force guy paxton. This is key largo. You saw downed helicopter wreckage, dead flyers,a hazmat team and a titanium box being loaded onto the back of a semi. Yeah,and I saw a hundred more boxes just like it at the air base, and people may be following me as a result. And underlay told you that the helicopter was searching for a missing weather plane,right? - Right. - Right! Then this is your story. Weather plane goes down during a hurricane. Search and rescue helicopter goes out to find it. They lower paxton into the water. Boom! He's he's immediately attacked by a school of... fish. Hearing all this over the radio, the air force sends out their cleanup crew. Shocked,they find a dead orange fish at the scene, and they immediately lock it into a titanium box-- they very same titanium box that you saw being loaded into the truck. How do we know that these boxes aren't just holding weather planwreckage? Hmm? I've had a minute to think about it,too. Maybe we're all just getting ahead of ourselves. The air force doesn't generally advertise when they lose a plane. Maybe that's their big secret--they lost a plane. So,uh,so these guys are following you because they think you have a tray table? I'm not sure anyone was following me. It could have been your paranoia rubbing off. Oh,yeah,that'S... Hey,daddy! Hey,rose. Hey! You're home early. Yeah,well,I'm not staying long. I just need to pick up some supplies. Supplies for what? Fishing trip. How can frozen water be so heavy? do you want to stop by the hospital and say hi to your mom? Nah. She'll be busy. I know she misses you,jess. whoa! Hey,marcia and greg. - You guys need a lift? - No. Come on.You're gonna melt. What do you want,derek? Just a sense of fulfillment,of helping other human beings. - That's all. - Go away. That's not what you said the other night at the bonfire. Okay,fine. Wait. No,it's okay. There's something derek and I need to settle. Sweet. stop acting like we slept together. You embarrsed? If I'd actually had sex wi you,I'd be embarrassed. I mean,the night's a bit of a haze, but I think I'm remember something like that. Kira,totally straight-- I woke up that morning feeling like I've never felt before. Really. Supercharged. And the last thing I remember was kissing you. Yeah,right. No,I'm serious. It was amazing. You were amazing. Whoo! derek! they'll probably let you off with a warning once they find out who my father is. Right. but in this case,that might not help. What's the hurry,son? Hello,honey. Hey,dad. Hello,sir. Have we met before? Dad,he's been over to the house. Wait in my car for me,honey. Dad! I'd like to talk to this young man alone. I'm not going to give you a ticket,son. Thank you,sir. But I am going to give you a warning. Okay. I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. Sir,I-- - hey,she's not your type. - Oh,we're just friends,sir. Well,I'm sure you have other friends. And if you don't,I'll be happy to find some for you... st not my daughter. what are you doing here? What do you mean,what am I doing here? I wanted to see you. How did you get in? Hopped the fence. I'm sorry about my dad.That was so lame. No biggie. It happens. What did he say? He said I had,um,I had good taste. No,he didn'T. So you gonna invite me in? What if he comes home? Does he ever come home during the day? your father said I wasn't your type. He did? kira! Hey,kira! Get in the closet. The closet? Kira? kira? Oh. Hi... I'm sorry. Uh,what are you doing home so early? Well,I finished my rounds early today.You okay? Yeah. Um,I was just resting. Oh. Okay. Well,I just wanted to check in. I'm going to take a quick bath and then go to my meeting. But I'll be home early,so I'll make us all dinner. - Okay? - Great. - Will you set the table? - Sure. Okay. Well,I guess I'll see you later then. Right. I'll see you later. Sorry. My stepmom's been trying to do this dinner thing,like,for a long time. It was hot in there,right? It's hot everywhere. Look,I,um... look,I think I should go. Oh,no,no. You're not going anywhere. This doesn't feel right. Sorry,kira. It felt right a minute ago. What's wrong with you? I think your dad was right. You're not my type. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents Sync:YTET-fisherchen -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Invasion ?? soon as I catch one of these things. Where you guys going,anyway? just a little fishing trip. He's going to look for the lights. You are? Yeah. - Well,can I come? - No. - Why not? - Because,jess,it's just not safe. Well,why is it safe for you? Jesse-- dad,I'm not a little kid anymore,you know? I can help you out. That's kind of why I'm here,to help you out. Russell,if he's going,I'm definitely going. Why don't you l go? You can take care of each other. Don't kill it,daddy. Just catch it. Before the hurricane, the biggest challenge I faced was whether to give somebody a crew cut or a trim. and the only person I ever thought of... the only person I even worried about was me. And I was alone. Now I don't remember exactly what happened the night eve hit. But I do know that something washed that man away. Because the man you see before you now, the man who survived that night knows his life has just begun. I come in here, and meeting all of you and hearing all of your stories, I've realized that the only way to truly move ahead is to do it with all of you. I'm just grateful that I'll never have to be alone again. that was cool,huh? I'm derek. I'm mariel. I know who you are.I've seen you with kira. Right. Yeah,we have a couple classes together. Well,I mean,we did,when there was school. Right. Hey,these meetings are really great,hmm? I,uh... is this your first one, or have you--you keep coming back, or you've been at a couple? Actually,this is my third. But I plan on coming to as many as I can. Yeah. Yeah,me too. What was your experience? If you don't mind me asking. No. Um... during the hurricane,I was fine. But almost a week after,something happened,and I,uh... well,I haven't been the same. This is gonna sound really weird, but do things feel different to you now? Like water... water feels completely different to me now. It's almost...almost like velvet. You know,I should be getting home,derek. Yeah. Sure. - Thanks for listening. - Sure. I mean,it's the first time I've told anyone about any of this. So... it helps to talk about it,doesn't it? Yeah. A lot. Um,can I... can I talk to you again sometime? You know,about...about all this stuff? Of course. Anytime. Right. Thank you. Higher,larkin! Higher? Looks to me like you're going pretty high already. Please? Just one more higher? Okay.There you go! Hey,rose? Let's play something else. Let's play hide and go seek. I want you to count to 100 and then find a really good hiding place in the house,okay? And then,after 100,I'll come find you. okay. Okay? One. Two. Three. Who are you? stop. Russ,why does this area look so familiar? This is where that plane went down. What plane? There was a crash here in '96. I was part of the search and rescue team. Was that the one with kira's mom? Yeah. How did tom live through that? What,kira's dad was on that flight,too? Yeah. He was the only one who survived. - Everyone knows that. - I didn'T. - So how'd he make it,dad? - I don't know. I remember reading something about him being trapped in an air pocket-- "underlay's miracle in mud,"they called it. No wonder the guy's so full of himself. He's invulnerable. hey,jess,slow down. What is it? What do you got? That's it. That's one of them. There's one. Jesse,get the net. No,jesse,hold on. Hold on! where did it go? I think it's under the boat. - What? - shh! Don't move. There it is!There it is! Follow it!Follow it! Follow it,foll it,follow it! Looks really good,honey. Well,you might want to taste it first. Kira? I met a friend of yours today--derek. Where did you meet him? At our support group. I guess he's been having a rougtime lately. Since when? - He hasn't told you? - No. But we're not really that close. At least,not anymore. Well,that's too bad. He seems kind of lonely. How do you know? I could just tell,talking to him. Why were you talking to him? 'Cause he's been having a rough time. Wow. What? The kid is something. You don't even know him,dad. I'm getting to know him. Well,hopefully the group will help. Oh,I'm sure he's just gonna blossom. What is wrong with you? Dad doesn't like derek. No,dad knows derek. Dad knows derek all too well. looks like it's slowing down. - Cut the engine,dave. - Why I don't i see any lights? Just cut the engine. Is it still there? - Yeah. - Okay,on three. One... two... three. I got it.You got it? You got it? come on. Here we go.I got it. Come on! Damn it,russ! Is it gone?Did we lose it? No,it's still there. I don't understand it. Russ,russ,russ!It's getting away! Russ,hold on.Hold on! Hold on! It's getting away! No more shooting,russ!You don't wanna shoot it! Jeez,I think you just missed it,dad. I don't think so. did you tag it?That was a tag? It's not going anywhere without us. You tagged it. - What are you doing here? - Just hanging out. Why don't you hang out somewhere else? I'm not interested in your daughter anymore,sir. I know that. But the person you are interested in... she's not available. I don't know what you're talking about. My wife told me you joined her group. You choose all your wife's friends? Let me explain something to you,son. I understand how you feel. I understand it better than anyone because I've lived with the feeling far longer than anyone you'll ever meet at that support group. But let me tell you something else,and this is the really important part. You don't matter to me at all. You have zero value in my life. And where mariel's concerned, the only value that you could ever have is by causing me problems. And that's not something you want to do. inhalation therapist to C.C.U. inhalation therapist to C.C.U. Hi. Do you know where I can find dr. Underlay? You need to go to admitting. No,no,I need to find dr. Underlay. yes? mariel? Oh,my god. How'd you do this? I was,um... I was trying to unscrew a light bulb. So you're going to the meeting tonight? - Hmm,I think so. - Yeah. Would you mind giving me a lift? Well,you know,I just don't think I should drive. we should have found it by now. we will.We just have to be patient. As long as there's a signal,we'll catch up to it. hey,dad,what happened to that old cuban guy you found? Yeah,what's up with him? You send him back to havana? No,mona took him down to the border patrol. Is he gonna be able to stay here? I don't know if he'll want to. You did. Well,my situation was very different. What situation? Dad came here in the boatlift in 1980 when he was only 10 years old... by himself. What about your folks? They were supposed to be on the next boat. There wasn't one. - What'd you do? - Waited. Yeah,and? Waited. this is just like "deliverance." let's hope not. Hey,you know,if we don't find the one we tagged, what do you say,russ? You want to head out into deeper water tomorrow? Maybe there's an E.B.E. Mothership out there-- hey,dave,why don't we just stop with that alien nonsense now,okay? That E.B.E. Word-- why don't you lose it? It's not a word.It's an acronym. Yourather is afraid of the unexplained,jesse. No,his father just doesn't need you explaining. How about when we find one of these things, we let science give us an explanation? You know,every scientist thought the world was flat until one lone visionary proved them wrong. - One. - Which visionary? Chris columbus-- famed explorer and director of "home alone." Aristotle proved the wod round. And he was seconded by the likes of roger bacon and thomas aquinas. Columbus--he just golost. But he still managed to wipe out countless native americans along the way. Okay,fine,both you guys mock me all you want. When the invaders come a-prodding, you guys are both gonna know the true meaning of "squeal like a pig." "the tall black figure was coming her way. "He was keeping very close to the houses across the street, "hiding in the shadowy places where there was no moonlight. "On and on it came,nearer and nearer..." you said this was scary. It's not scary. It seems scary to me. "On and on it came,nearer and nearer. "But it was moving in spurts. "It would stop,and then it would"-- "and then it would move on. And then it would stop"-- what is it? is everything okay,larkin? dad? Hey,jess. Why aren't you sleeping? I don't know. Why aren't you? Just thinking about stuff. Yeah,me,too. Dave doesn't seem to have a problem. Why do you think it's so important for him that there be extraterrestrials? Isn't there enough weird stuff on this planet? Yeah,I guess he just hates the idea that we could be alone. Well,we're not alone. Have you ever really tried to find out what happened to your parents? Sure. And? It's cuba,son.It's a brick wall. And they were dissidents. Was it scary for you when you first came out here? Of course. Thanks for letting me come out here with you,dad. You're welcome. Think you're really gonna be able to bring one of these things home alive? We'll see. It may not be so easy. It looked pretty big. Did your mom ever mention to y that she saw one - when she was in the water? - No. Think that's why she could be acting so weird? Dad? Looks good. Oh,yeah. Nothing like a week's worth of salt in a bowl to really hit the spot. You want me to make you something? You? Hey,back in the day,I made a mean spaghetti. What days were those? You're still upset about derek? Yeah,but for a different reason. Did you know that mariel's taking him with her to her meeting tonight? What? Yeah. She just called and said she bumped into him at the hospital, so she's not going to be home till after. What's up with that? I mean,the guy has been weird since the bonfire, but what's he doing with mariel? I just find that so weird.Don't you? do you need to check in with anybody? - Your mom or your dad? - No. No,they're out of town. - So you're all alone,then? - I guess. Well... not anymore. Derek,you know that I'm a happily married woman,right? And that I'm twice--or... nearly twice your age. Of course. - I'm gonna take you home - No,no,no,no,no. Look,there's something I want to show you. What? Can we swing by biscayne park?It's right on the way. - No,it's not. - It's almost on the way. Okay?Please. Well,what's in biscayne park? The water. kira. Dad? I'm at the church.Mariel's not here. I need you to tell me about derek. What do you want to know? What happened the night of the bonfire? Dad... I need to know what happened to derek! We spent the night on the beach. - And then-- - what beach? Where? Biscayne park. Dad? Dad? You ever been here before? Not for a long time. It's amazing,isn't it? You feel it,too? The pull? Yeah. It's hypnotic. I want to take you in. Derek... just for a couple of minutes.Okay? It's okay. - No. - Mariel,it's okay. No,derek,we have to go to our meeting.We're already late. - It's okay. Who cares? - Stop it. - You want this,too.I know you do. - Derek,let me go! - What are you doing? - It's okay.

I guess I do. My wife is not the answer. - No. - No. I won't mess with her. And I won't go to those meetings anymore. No,no,no,no,no. I want you to go to the meeting. - Oh,yeah? - Yeah. And I think with the right guidance, you could play a valuable role in this community. - You do? - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now listen to me. There's a little work camp down in the glades. I'm gonna send you there for awhile,all right? It's gonna sharpen you up a little bit. And then maybe in six to eight months... months? - You want something more permanent? - No. No,no. 'Cause I think that's the best solution for everybody. There you go. what the hell do you think you're doing? - Nothing. I was just-- - you're trespassin'. Sir... I'm with the park service. I tagged a fish last night, and I just wanted to see if it was in your net. - Did you do something to my son? - What? Stevie!Stevie,get out here! Sir,could you put the gun down? You recognize this fella? What's wrong with him? He's been like this since he got home this morning. Stevie,come here. This man thinks you stole his fish.
