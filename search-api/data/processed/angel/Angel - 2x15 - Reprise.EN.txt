A vampire wants to slay a demon to help grubby humans? I don't get it. There's a hotel here full of tortured souls... ...who need your help. Take them all. I'm trying to atone for 100 years of unthinkable evil. I never can. Never enough. Now I got Wolfram & Hart dogging me. You've done stellar work. The senior partners noticed. Darla had a shot at redemption, but they took it. For God's sake, help us. - People will die. - I just can't seem to care. Officer, wait! This man is-- You learn to live with many things, don't you? - This job is making me crazy. - I know the feeling. - What's next? - "Be sure all troughs are fastened... ...and sacrifices tilted as in diagram F-12... - ...for drainage into sacred bowl." - Yes, yes. And? "Using a diagonal motion, slit throat of sacrifice... ...with the pre-blessed ceremonial dagger provided." - It didn't see it. - Look under the packing. Hurry. - It's not in here. - Just give me the knife. You know.... I, well, couldn't help but notice the goats. Yeah, lot of goats. Goats, many. Those goats, guys-- That's our pre-blessed-- Ceremonial dagger? So sue me. Or have your bosses do it. This building's owned by Wolfram & Hart, right? What do you want? I wanna know what they're having you worship. None of your business. Who are you? Me? The type who hates to see good blood go to waste. We just get paid to do the slaughtering and say the prayer. - Praying to what? - I don't know! - How can you not know? - The ritual, it's in Latin. They said we should just sound it out. - They? - Like you said, Wolfram & Hart. It has to be done by midnight, or something will be pissed off. Good. - I don't see anything. - Not a trace. At school the kids'll never notice that a third eye was growing there. - This will come back in soon. - What? The hair. I meant the hair... ...that was in the back-- Not the third eye, 'cause that won't come back. - Right? - No reason it should. The curative charm seems to have worked like a charm. - We can't thank you. - Don't worry. It's what we do. - Kind of a mission. - No, I mean we can't thank you. And we can't pay you either. This bill, it's ridiculous. What? We didn't even charge you for the mandrake. - My husband says it's outrageous. - Does he? What would your husband consider a fair price... ...for the removal of the third eye from the back of your child's head? Well, nothing. Steve says one can't be bitten by a demon and have a third eye... ...grow on the back of one's head, so you're runn;ng a scam. And you won't squeeze one red cent out of us. - Come on, Stephanie. - Scam? The back of your kid's head was blinking! No, let her go. It's easier for the Sharps to call us con artists than to accept... ...that Skilosh spawn nearly hatched out of their child's skull. - Gee, wonder why? - Great. While they're indulging their denial, we have bills to pay. You know, she's right. Maybe the Sharps will come round. Right. People come round. - Where are you going? - To see what's up in the hood. I'll do more good there than here with you two. - Things will pick up. They're bound to. - It's L.A. The evil's probably tied up in traffic. You'll let me know when it gets here, right? I've been looking for you. Where are you going? - Lunch. - You think now is the time for lunch? You mean lunchtime? - The review's in two days. - I'm aware. So is everyone else. They've had the fear of-- "God" would be the wrong word. - They're just scared. - They should be. I dug up everything on the last 75-year review. It makes the Christmas purge of '68 seem fun. Half of mid-management was sacked. They used actual sacks. - I'll read it, Lilah. - You better. My ass is on the line too. We're supposed to be running this together. I suggested how to plump up our portfolios by Friday. Either we pass the review or we won't. You think a few dark rites and rituals will make a difference? Everyone else thinks so. Henderson pulled her first-born out of company daycare to offer it up to.... Brownnoser. Mom was right. I should've had children. - We'll stand on our record. - Then we're dead. Remember our collective screwups? Two of them are still out there somewhere. You'd tell me if they contacted you, right? He set them on fire, Lilah. Even vampires need time to recover from that. - It'd be like them to pop up now. - Don't worry. Someone's got to. We don't get a second shot at this. Nothing can happen between now and Friday to screw this up. Blood sacrifices, black masses, totems.... What does it mean? It's all over. It could be a raising, but I don't.... The prayers, the rituals, they're too generic. Boilerplate. - Are they summoning something? - Or trying to make it rain. Why is this so important to you? - Because it's important to them. - Therefore it must be stopped. I need you. I don't have the resources. - You need my help? - Yeah-- Get them for butchering animals without a permit. I can't do anything. I'm on desk duty till Friday's hearing. Hearing? Remember Atkinson, the captain at the two-three? He's blaming me for letting in a lunatic... ...who broke into his office and beat him up. He's filed a complaint. He raised zombie cops and released them in the streets. Once I explain that to Internal Affairs, this'll go away. They've just been looking for an excuse. You know what they say about me. I'm a cop. That's all I've ever-- I can't take a suspension. I would just-- I'm sorry. Are you? Because they might want to know about this too. You'd nothing to do with that. - Didn't I? - No. These dead people were threatened by an intruder at their offices... ...whom I picked up and released three hours... ...before they were massacred. - You know who's responsible for that. - Yes. But why is Forensics saying it looks like... ...the suspect or suspects didn't break in? They had to break out. The victims were locked in with their attackers. I am done helping you now. Sorry I'm late. I'd come home for lunch... ...but it's crazy at the office, with the review coming up. I didn't call, so you wouldn't have to get up. How do you feel? Stronger today, I guess. Good. You're stronger every day. Only because you saved me. I'd still be in that sewer if you hadn't found me. I don't know how you did it. Drusilla. She came to me. Remember? I told you. She's gone. - She'll be back. - No. You're the only one who hasn't abandoned me. And I never will. Here. It's cold. It's the only way to keep it fresh. Not the only way. At least it's human. I'm gonna go shower. You always shower when you come back from that place. Don't know why. You're never dirty. I'm always dirty. I don't care, substitute it with something. Be creative. Not even 10:00, and we're out of yak's bile. - We gotta talk. - You should've booked in advance. - You can't go onstage tonight. - I'm not here to sing. - That's what we call it now? - Something's coming. Really? I thought it was the nachos bringing in the morally ambiguous crowd. Lawyers. Easy. I know what you're thinking. The throwing-yourself-over-tables- twisting-their-heads-off part? Not a good idea. You've seen. You know what's coming. You wouldn't like it if I blabbed your personal stuff... ...to every Tom, Dick and vampire that walked in. Is it bad? I can't divulge to you what I read in another being. But I heard something in the men's restroom. It's coming Friday. It's got their legal briefs in a twist. What? Every 75 years, your friends at Wolfram & Hart have a review. The angst is not about the review, but more about the reviewer. - And let's just say it ain't Rex Reed. - What is it? It's evil. It's dark. It's merciless. Actually, it sounds a lot like Rex, doesn't it? Just tell me in one word what it is. Not likely. But I can tell you in two. Senior partner. - I need more. More information. - We all need more. You need more tether, 'cause you're at the end of it. I get this. I'm not asking you to rat out their destinies. - These senior partners are my destiny. - Are they? I haven't seen a destiny with you in it lately. It's all kind of murky. These messy rites and rituals you've crashed all over town... ...they mean nothing. Nervous children... ...trying to score points before Daddy gets home. I got news. Daddy? Not impressed. Stopping those won't prevent it from passing into our world Friday. - What is "it" and how do I stop it? - I don't know. Can it be killed? Most anything in this dimension can be killed. A downside of being here. That and the so-called musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber. "The Band of Blacknil." I don't know what it means. - I shouldn't even give you that much. - Thanks. "Home Office." Picked it up from them tonight. - What does it mean? - Maybe the source. Who knows? Stop pestering me. I am picking up one other thing. They'd really like to see you dead. - Good Lord. - Angel? May we help you? Excuse me, that area is for employees only. - You took the books. - You got the waffle iron. Hey, no! Not that one. I'm in the middle of it. Take this. Don't make me move you. Give him the book, Cordelia. Just give him the damn thing! Let him get the hell out. Here. - I don't even know what you are. - I'm a vampire. Look it up. What a jerk. Cordelia.... Anybody else, I'd say get laid, already. - Cordelia.... - But no, not him. One decent boff, and he switches to evil psycho-vamp. Which would be better for everyone. Him, 'cause he'd get some. Us, because then we could stake him after. Cordelia, ambulance. Oh, my God! If you have anything to offer in your defense, anything at all... ...now would be the time. - For God's sake, say something. - What am I supposed to say? They've dredged out every ugly detail. It's as if nothing had a context, and I'm supposed to explain? I was doing my job. Actually, you've been isolating yourself. You've withdrawn from your fellow officers... ...developed a fascination with bizarre and macabre cases. Even you can't seem to give an explanation as to why. Now your father, he was a respected veteran of this department. You discovered his body after he was murdered, is that right? Yes. And the case was never solved? No arrests have ever been made. That must be frustrating for you. - I dealt with it. - Did you? You took no time off after his death. You went right back on the job. - That's not your business. - It is when it affects performance. It is important when we suffer a loss of this nature... ...to take proper time to grieve. So we understand. - We're not judging you. - No, you're just firing me. - You stopped being part of the force. - What do I do? We will make available to you psychological counseling... ...at the city's expense, as part of your severance. You have no idea what is going on in this city. Is this where you start talking about monsters? We'll need your gun and your badge. I'm glad your father's not here to see this. You Denver? I don't believe it. You know, you changed my life that day. A vampire comes into my place... ...looking to kill a demon to save human beings? If that can happen, there must be good in the world. You've never heard of Home Office? How'd that go? It was a Thesulac. Paranoia demon, if I recall. I don't know. I think it killed everyone there. The point is, you tried. I walked out and let him have the place and everyone in it. We don't know where the Home Office is... ...but you think the senior partner is a Kleynach demon? Right. Kleynach. Many dark entities use the form of a Kleynach to manifest. A Kleynach doesn't have to rely on being conjured. They can come and go with that ring. - Tell me about the ring. - The Band of Blacknil. Simple thing. Plain. You wouldn't notice it in a pawn shop. But it's used to move between the dimensions. And that's what it'll use to get here. And get back. - Get back? - Well, sure. - Can anyone use the ring? - Say again? Will it take me back to the Home Office? Might. If you're insane. You realize what this Home Office probably is? - I think I have an idea. - Hell. Why the heck do you want to go to Hell? You're gonna go down there and destroy the whole lot of them! That'd certainly make up for the time that you-- Still, not a terrific idea. Suicide, really. - Will the ring get me there? - You gotta get it first. To get the ring, you gotta kill the Kleynach. How? I'm the one guy who can tell you. How? To kill the Kleynach and get the ring... - ...you need the glove. - You're making this up. Legend says the Kleynach rose from their demon world... ...raped and pillaged the villages of man. All who fought them were incinerated... ...whether they struck with fist or sword. But one brave and worthy knight, he had a glove... ...fashioned and blessed by all the Powers of Light. Whoever wore the glove could kill the Kleynach by grabbing it at the throat. Picked it up in '75 at a yard sale in Covina. Been using it as an oven mitt. And now I give it to you. No charge. Because the truth is, you did change my life. And I got a feeling this time, things are gonna go-- Better. That's right, Angelus. Go towards the bleeding mortal. Because that's smart. The ring's not about vengeance, Angelus. It's about power. We'll get to the vengeance part soon. I stood up to him. That's the important thing. You couldn't do it metaphorically? With a stern word? You had to do it in the "I'm standing Up now and popping 6 stitches" way? Before all this happened I never really considered... ...how dangerous your work was. Of course it's dangerous. Remember how we met? You were strapped to an altar... ...while the goddess Yeskah was called forth to consume you. But I grew up with that sort of stuff. Creepy-crawlies and scary monsters I can handle. But guns? Kind of makes it all a little too real. The gun was fired by a zombie, if it makes you feel better. You know, strangely, it doesn't. Ooh. Does it always seem like it's a battle worth fighting? Some less than others. Collectively, I mean. Most people don't even acknowledge the evil, let alone fight it. They don't have to use bandages to keep their insides from falling out. That's true. I don't suppose you'd ever consider maybe giving it up... ...for something else? Could you be with someone who would? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I should be wrapped in bandages... ...to keep my insides from falling out. This is difficult for you, isn't it? - I just don't like to see you hurt. - No. I mean breaking up with me. You two stick close. Crap! I knew you guys were a waste of money. You're not parking in the underground lot anymore. It's not safe. What do you want? I want the same thing from you that I took from Lindsey. - Hello, Ms, Morgan, Which floor? - Fifteen. You'll lead security all over the moment you step inside. Yeah, I'm counting on it. Good evening. Angphlmn Investigations. We help the helpless. How can we help you? What is "Angphlmn"? There are some names I'm not saying at the moment. What is it, Wesley? I just.... I'm not really feeling that great. Oh, well, your guts opened up. - Maybe I won't come in tomorrow. - That's okay, It's not like they're beating down the door. Stay home. Spend time with Virginia, Yes. And you, you should get out yourself. You're young, single, It's a Friday night... ...in the City of "Angphlmns." - There must be someone you can call, - No, then I'd have friends. I don't. That's not true. You don't count. Thank you. You know what I mean, Things are going to get better, Cordelia. For all of us. You'll see, I'll call you tomorrow. See how you're feeling. That'd be nice. - Good night, Wesley, - Good night. Oh, jeez, Wesley, lip-a-dee doo-dah, all right? - Hello? - Ms. Chase? Oh. Mrs. Sharp! We were hoping you'd still be in the office. The back of your daughter's head is still okay, right? We don't offer a money-back guarantee. But you never paid, did you? You do? Right now? No, that's great! You're on my way home, give or take 30 miles. Personal check? Normally not, but fine. Will you give me the address again? Okay, great. I'll see you soon. One of them is on their way here now. I don't see your co-vice president. It doesn't look good. Yes, sir. Well, find it. Deal with it. Is there a problem? Someone just let a vampire onto this floor. There! Security! Vampire! Stake the bitch. Okay. Home Office. Let's finish this. Congratulations. Great victory. - You're-- - Holland Manners. Not alive. Oh, no. I'm quite dead. Unfortunately my contract with Wolfram & Hart extends well beyond that. Hop on in. You've certainly earned it. No, not a ghost either. It's just me. Dead me. See? Home Office, wasn't it? I should mention the trip is one-way. If there are no objections, I suggest we get going. It's a long ride. This is exciting, isn't it? Going straight to the source. So, what's the big plan, Angel? Destroy the senior partners? - Smash Wolfram & Hart forever? - Something like that. Just what do you imagine that will accomplish? In the end, I mean? - It'll be the end. - The end of you, certainly. But I meant in the larger sense. In the larger sense, I really don't give a crap. Now, I don't think that's true. Be honest. You've got a tiny bit of "give a crap" left... ...or you wouldn't be on this mission. Now, there was something in a sacred prophecy. Some oblique reference to you. Something you're supposed to prevent. What was that? - The Apocalypse. - Yes, the Apocalypse, of course. Another one of those. Well, it's true, we do have one scheduled. If you were to prevent it, you'd save many people. You should do that, then. Absolutely. I wasn't thinking. Those people you save from that Apocalypse would await the next one. But, hey, it's always something, isn't it? You're not gonna win. Well, no, of course we aren't. We have no intention of doing anything so prosa;c as w;nn;ng. - Then why? - I'm sorry. Why what? Why fight? That's the question you should be asking yourself. For us, there is no fight. Winning doesn't enter into it. We go on, no matter what. Our firm has always been here, in one form or another. Inquisition. Khmer Rouge. We were there when the first caveman clubbed his neighbor. We're in the hearts and minds of every living being. And that, friend... ...is making things difficult for you. The world doesn't work in spite of evil, Angel. It works with us. It works because of us. Welcome to the Home Office. This isn't.... Well, you know it is. You know that better than anyone. The things you've seen. The things you've, well, done. If there wasn't evil in all of them out there... ...why, they wouldn't be people. They'd all be angels. Have a nice day. You've reached Angel Investigations, We help the hopeless, leave a message and we'll get right back to you, You did it, didn't you, you bastard? You made me trust you. You made me believe. No, it wasn't you. It was me, right? I couldn't take the heat. That's what they're gonna say, And you're gonna feel all bad, or you won 't care, But I won't care either, I won't feel a thing, What do you want, Darla? You want this? Or maybe what you really want is this. Maybe what you really want... ...is this. Don't play games with me. I'm not playing. I just wanna feel something besides the cold. Why are you laughing? Don't you feel the cold? What are you doing?
