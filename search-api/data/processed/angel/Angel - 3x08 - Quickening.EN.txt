Imagine what could have happened if you'd slept with Darla. - You know I'd never do that. - Hello, lover. - Darla. - Darla. - Darla. - This is impossible. Tell me about it, Daddy. You slept with her? How are you feeling? Get away! You'll be all right. I'll kill her for this. You're gonna have to find her first. Go on. Do it. - Do it! Do it! - The child, it has a soul. - No, it doesn't. - It does. Whatever this thing is, it's arriving about... ...three, two, now. Just tell me where he is. - We found them. - Go. Is your mother home, young lady? You take us to her. Father said not to let strangers in while he's away. We're not strangers. You're Sarah, aren't you? We know about you. You're the apple of your father's eye. Would strangers know that? So, lass, may two friends enter? - Is that a yes, then? - Yes. Ah, lovely. Such a good girl. Remind me to give you a special treat. They're trapped inside. - Your mom make you that dress? - What's all the fuss--? - Evening to you, ma'am. - Good evening. Burn it down if you have to. We can only stay a moment. We have a message for your husband. You know my Daniel? What is his message? I'll give it to Sarah. On my signal. Close your eyes. I have a surprise for you. Tell your husband, Mr. Holtz.... Never mind, I'll tell him myself. Where are they? They're at my house. Can't something be done about that horrible noise? - I think it wants its mother. - Let's send it to her. Do you want to do it, or should I? Are you going to do it... ...or am I? I know it seems like only a moment to you... ...but 227 years have passed since our agreement. Empires have risen and fallen. Mankind has harnessed the power of the sun... ...walked on the moon and turned arid deserts green. What of England? Has it survived the years and destruction? Yes. It went through a rough patch 60 years ago, but it's mostly unchanged. Warm beer, boiled meat, bad teeth. That's why I moved to L.A. Have you followed this history? American Revolution... ...Manifest Destiny, westward expansion, the Beach Boys? I understand enough. One thing baffles me. These visions, wars, the weapons of destruction. How is it no one has killed Angelus or Darla? That's why I brought you here. Because your fate and their fate are entwined. Then let's go. Let's finish this. I want Angelus. I know. I want him too, but we're going to do it right. I haven't waited two and a half centuries to mess it up. You've been tracking him? Yes, but not in the way that you imagine. There are other dimensions where time behaves differently. I have an ability to navigate those dimensions. - And is that why you haven't aged? - Yes. That, and I've had a little work done, mostly around the eyes. Now, get some rest. You're going to need it. - You figure out a way to do it? - No. I was thinking about the last time you were here. That. Kind of hard to forget. I know. I've tried. You came in here all, "The world's a lonely place." - I'd had a bad day. - So you threw me through those doors... ...pushed me onto the bed and took what you wanted? Seemed like the thing to do at the time. Come in. Sorry. We've had a breakthrough with the scroll translations. Some verbs Wes was using were problematic... ...because of the Nyazian trick of converting nouns and verbs... ...which he discovered by-- Sorry. I'll shut up so he can tell you what he found. The Tro-Clon isn't a person. It's a confluence of events. It not only involves you, Darla and the child, but other things we don't know. Doesn't it mean the kid isn't this evil thing we feared? Not necessarily. There are a few Nyazian phrases... ...related to its birth that I haven't completed. - It's important you do. - We need to know what's in the oven. I know one thing about it. Something's protecting it. - How do you know that? - Because I can't get rid of it. Sorry I asked. If I shot this in your stomach, it wouldn't do anything? - Fire away. - No one's firing anything. Angel's right. Something wants this thing to come to term. - After it's born, chop its head off. - What if it doesn't have one? - We'll need a big mallet. - A net. Or a flamethrower. Flamethrower? There'll be no throwing of flames. Not until we know what's going on. If anybody has a problem with that, they should leave now. Not you. Come on, guys. How about it? - Cordy? - You want me to protect... ...the vampire bitch who bit me and her evil love child? Okay, I'm in. Ow! You're a vampire. A punch in the nose shouldn't hurt that much. Not, "Ow, her nose." She's having contractions. - Morning, Ms. Morgan. - Morning. Could you take this to Pinderhook in Demon Resources for me? Sure. Uh.... Ms. Morgan, I hate to bother you, but I've admired you for a while and-- - I don't date guys from the mailroom. - Me neither. I just thought you should know about this. Wait. You weasel. You think you can blackmail your way onto me on my desk-- No. You got it all wrong. I respect you way too much to be attracted to you. It's just, down in the mailroom, I see a lot, you know? Different factions in the firm. There comes a time when a guy has to choose a side. And is that disk your way of telling me you're choosing my side? Who are we allied against, you and I? - Who is this common foe? - I'd rather not-- If you don't tell me right now, I am gonna have your skin peeled off... ...and stapled back on inside out. Mr. Park. Gavin. Remember those exterminators he sent to Angel's hotel? They don't kill bugs, they plant them. Hm. Good, That's it, Where's your weight? Balls of your feet? Don't forget to follow, Oh, God! You said.... "Ke-yi, ha, yawa, ow. " Someone doing an incantation? No. Angel started training Female 1 in martial arts. - I think she got in a lucky punch. - Hm. - Any tech problems? - Just a couple. Don't sweat it, though. That is a transcription of everything up to last week. How about that? I just asked myself, "If I were a cockroach, where would I hide?" And there you are! Did you really think you could blackmail me? Blackmail? No one cares. Bumping uglies with an old man who body-jumped into a vampire... ...is the closest you've been to a relationship in years. This is about something else. Thank you, Cyril. You're welcome, sir. What was that crap about choosing sides? He did. He's on mine. Is this your convoluted, pathetic way of asking for my help? Because you sure need it. You're understaffed, underfunded... ...and clearly undertalented. So, what have we learned here? We? There is no we. It was time you understood the full scope... ...of what I've been doing these past few months. Who is this unidentified pregnant female? I don't know. We lost audio for a couple of days last week. - I can pull the tape. - See? Need me. - Darla? - Impossible. Vampires can't give birth. Tell me about it. - Yeah? - Linwood, it's Lilah. You're not gonna believe what I'm looking at. How long since the last contraction? About 20 minutes. They're still real irregular. - Something's wrong. The pain.... - You like pain. This is different. I want it out. Now! That's what's happening. The first stage of labor. That's good, right? How long does it last? It varies. The whole thing, maybe 18 hours. Eighteen hours? No, that's too long. All right, okay. Easy. Just lie down. I'll be right back. We gotta figure out what's inside of her before it skitters out. We should get a demony doctor who knows how her vampire girl-parts work. - You know what I'm saying. - Didn't she try that shaman thing? Yeah, she did. I don't suppose she ever went to a normal doctor or a hospital? There's an idea. A hospital. Oh, wait. They don't admit vampires. - Who says we have to admit? - We don't need the right doctor. We just need the right equipment. I don't care. Just find somebody who can answer the bloody question. Heads will roll if the senior partners hear of this. They won't. That's why we came to you. Darla, pregnant. How'd we miss it? I'm sequestering the psychics in the conference room. We'll get to the bottom of this. A man works hard... ...builds something, waters it... ...grows rich and powerful... ...leaves his wife for a younger beauty. These are the reasons we take certain blood oaths. And to have it all vanish because.... I can't stress enough. There's no way we could have foreseen this. She's right, sir. No one could have known. Hi, you've reached the Tittles, - For Christine, press one, - For Bentley, press two, Or to speak to or worship Master Tarfall... ...Underlord of Pain, press three, Master, it's happened. The thing you have foreseen has come to be. We must tell the others. Another step, and it'll be your last. If you haven't come for a fight, you're in the wrong place. A fight's exactly what I'm looking for. Then be a man and show your face. I'm not a man. What I mean is.... - You're not human. - But masculine. You get that, right? You'll get more than a fight if you don't leave. Fine. My mistake. I thought you might want help killing Angelus and Darla. I don't need your help. I'll kill them myself. Not to rain on your parade, but, no, you won't. You'll die a bitter man and never see them again. - You don't know that. - I kind of do. It'll be over 200 years... ...before you get another chance to confront Angelus or Darla. Is this where the demon offers the broken man a chance to change that? I'll take you to them, two centuries into the future. - Through black magic and sorcery. - No, on a mule cart. Of course through black magic and sorcery. I'm a demon. - What do you want from me? - Your word. I want your word that when the time comes, you will show them no mercy. I don't mean to be pushy, but this is a limited time offer. Say yes, and I'll take you to them this very hour. Say no, and realize the one chance to avenge your wife and children... ...has slipped away forever. How you feeling? I haven't had blood in a day, and your spawn is trying to rip its way out. Paging Dr. Angel. I sent Gunn for an ultrasound machine so we can look inside Darla. - Is this a classroom? - It's a teaching hospital. How are you feeling, Darla? Something wrong? - I think the contractions have stopped. - Is that bad? - Do you mind if I--? - I won't bite. No, but that thing inside might. It may have been Braxton-Hicks contractions. A form of false labor. - False? - As in, not ready to come out yet. I'm way past ready. I'd cut it out if I could. - Here you go. One ultrasound machine. - Darla, up on the table. Don't you wanna see what's inside? You've kept me here long enough. Where are they? - It's not that simple. - I'm tired of waiting! Like I said, it's not that simple. You think I'd transport you two and a half centuries... ...if I could walk up to Angelus and stake him myself? Please. There are rules and forces at work far greater than either of us. Boy, you vengeful types aren't real good at playing with others. It's my street face. Now, put that on. I've lined up some men to help us. Are you now or have you ever been a vampire? Are any of your friends vampires? Seven of Cups. Queen of Swords. Jack of Wands. Thank you for coming. And correct me if I'm wrong... ...but the role of a psychic is to be psychic. To predict the future... ...so Wolfram and Hart isn't in this kind of predicament. I can't apologize enough, sir. You're right, you can't. I'm not without compassion. I'll give you a chance to save your job and your skin. No, you're not. You're gonna have me killed. Why couldn't you have had such foresight when we needed it? We are telling the truth. Thank you. Intelligence is coming in. No one knows how Darla got pregnant. There's a prophecy involving a vampire birth... ... but the scroll it' s recorded on is missing. Do you have any idea how many groups and cults... ...would kill to get their hands on this baby? - We gotta get it before anybody knows. - And we will. We need to get it, dissect it and find out what it means. Berlin on the phone. If they've heard about this in Berlin, Muncie can't be far behind. If the senior partners are looking to assign blame... ...the buck stops here, you understand me? Not exactly, sir. If the partners are looking to place blame, I'll have to step forward. That's inspiring, sir. Yes. I'll step forward and blame you. Darla was resurrected on your watch. I can think of no better scapegoat. You think this is over? Watch and learn, rookie. Yes? I understand. Well, then, let's take a look, shall we? I haven't studied one of these for a while. - Isn't that a head? - I think it is. - Or is that the head? - Maybe you're both right. It's not like I'm suggesting it's an evil two-headed thing. I see it. My little parasite. - Oh, my.... - What is it? - It's human. - Human, as in humanoid? As in cannibalistic, underground dwellers? No. Human as in.... A boy. - A boy? - A boy. A boy. You're carrying a boy. Great. I'm gonna have a son. I'm gonna have a son. Guys, as fascinating as an ultrasound image may appear, you should-- Me, a father... ...to a son. Do you know what that means? - We're surrounded by vampires? - No, it's a human boy-- We are surrounded by vampires. - So who has a plan? - "Don't let them kill us" sounds good. Behold the Miracle Child. The Miracle Child. - For his time has come. - The Miracle Child. The Miracle Child. Praise be. Praise be. Praise be. The buildings are taller, the machines more powerful. And you can get really great Thai food at 2 in the morning. People today are the same as they were in your day. They drink, they fight, they work hard, they fall in love. - They have families. - Yes, they still have families. I hope these men you've hired are ruthless bastards. - Go away! - It's Sahjhan. This is where we'll get your men. Very exclusive. These aren't men. Once again, gender, not species. I should have said minions. Have you seen Grappler demons fight? Not the sharpest pencils in the box but merciless in battle. Okay, guys, over here. Time to meet the new jefe, And, Flarmar, leave the head in the ring, okay? - Ready to command your troops? - Any other surprises I should know? I'm all for being worshipped, but what the hell is going on? - What do you want? - To protect the Miracle Child. That's good. We're here for the same thing. Die! As it has been prophesied by our great potentate, Ul-Thar... ...we vow our lives to protect this special child. Hear that? Our kid, special. Let's kill the humans and use their blood to nourish the mother... - ...and her Miracle Child. - Miracle Child. Guess I'm getting dinner after all. This should provide your ops unit with a tactical base. Plan and elevation drawings of every floor in Angel's hotel. I have surveillance capabilities to monitor the engagement from here. Excellent. I'm confident my men will capture the target. The larger question revolves around the extraction of the target's cargo. - Getting the baby from Darla. - Of course. - For that we've called in an expert. - You flatter me, sir. May I introduce Dr. Fetvanovich from our office in the Balkans? - How do you do? - He is a specialist... ...in paranormal obstetrics. We are very fortunate he's consented to help. It is I who feel fortunate. A vampire birth is... ...unprecedented. I look forward to dissecting both the mother and the child. You might wanna join the fight. Sorry. I'm gonna have to be Switzerland and sit this one out. You said you were just gonna kill the humans, right? Yes, just the humans. We will nourish you, slice you open... ...wear your entrails as a belt and eat your eyeballs... ...before we worship the Miracle Child. - Miracle Child. - Okay, I'm in. Gunn, we'll hold them off. The rest of you, get Darla to the car. I'd rather fight. Show these youngsters real carnage. That's thoughtful, but go. Charles, do you have an extra dagger? - This okay? - Perfect. On my count of three. One, two-- You make one move, and I'll slice the Miracle Kid into triplets. It's always the quiet ones. Wait! They don't know the knife can't hurt the baby. They do now. Vampires have great hearing. Here we go. Everybody out! All clear. We're clear, Alpha, move in, Let's go, men. Upstairs. Go! Alpha Team, move out. Delta Team, behind me. Lobby secured, sir. Let's set up out here. Oh, and get a hose. I'm afraid there might be some blood. And you can set the baby's cage next to Mama's. - I think we lost them. - Anybody hurt? Nothing Band-Aids and ice cream can't fix. - I'm good. - Darla? Darla, everything okay? Yeah, fine. - You all right? - It's nothing. It's the kid, isn't it? Seeing him on the monitor? No, I'm just disappointed the vamp cult didn't kill all of you. So where are we going? I'm famished, and we know how ugly that can get. - Where are we going? - Somewhere safe. Where's safe? Hotel's definitely out. - How about--? - Vegas? Sorry. Too high-profile. But we need to get out. - Actually-- - I hate it when you say that. "Actually" means your oversized brain... ...thought of something we failed to consider, right? Just other people know more about this kid's importance than we do. The only thing that can help us is at the hotel. We can't protect your child unless we get the scrolls. Okay then, quick stop. - Is this man with you? - Where's Angelus? Who is this pirate with the sword, and what is he doing there? I don't know, sir. But he called Angel by his old name, Angelus. - I need better audio. - Any second. - Hand over the vampires, - He's covered, sir, This has gone on long enough. I don't care who that man is, take him out. Take him out now. - Over. - Take him out! This should be sweet. - Picture! - I'm working on it, sir. Stop it! Gentlemen, please! - Burke's never lost. - It'll be over in just a second. That should do it. Anybody there? Over? - Why are you stopping here? - It's a few blocks. I'll go on foot. - Who says you get to be wheelman? - Who says it has to be a man? - The scrolls? - In the office. If I'm not back in five, leave without me. - Leave to where? - Anywhere. Somewhere safe. Angel? Yeah? Just get out of here. Angelus. I've been looking for you. - He said five. - It's been six and a half. - So typical of him. - Wouldn't hurt to wait another minute. What's the worst thing that could happen in another minute? Ask a stupid question.... Her water's broken. This is for real. Should be a blanket in the trunk.
