- He seemed fine. He was in Sunnydale for three days... ...tracking Buffy and that thing in your vision. Where's the crabby scowl, the morbid gloom? This means it cut deeper than usual. - Look out, here comes Hurricane Buffy. - You think? Maybe he's over her. You have much to learn, little Irish man. Oh, my God! - Don't do it, Angel! - Listen, it's not worth it. - It's not? - No. You can't let her get to you. You'll meet someone else. Give it time. Why don't you let me have that? Because I need it to level my desk. The floor's uneven. - You thought-- - Doyle did. You know how he jumps to conclusions. - Because you saw Buffy. - Look, I was there to protect her. She didn't even know I was there. Really? So you avoided her? Look, Buffy will always be a part of me. That's never gonna change. But she's human... ...and I'm not. That's also not gonna change. There's no need to stir this up again. You don't want to stir... ...but if my ex came to town and was stalking me... - ...and didn't say hello, I'd be-- - A little upset. Wouldn't you? Buffy. Buffy's here. In town. - What brings you to...? - I came to see my father. Thought I'd stop by. What a surprise! - Cordelia, how are you? - I'm good. You? I've been better. This is Doyle, he gets visions of people in trouble. - Nice to-- - And this is us leaving you alone. Well, um.... It's good to-- Can I get you anything? How about an explanation? Who are you, coming to my town, following me behind my back? - Sorry. - What is this... ...some new torment you cooked up? - I didn't want to-- - You can see me, but I can't see you? - What are we playing? - We're not. I wrestled with this decision. - Which you made without me. - I tried to do what was right. It's complicated, Buffy. It's kind of a long story. Your sidekick had a vision and you came to Sunnydale? Okay, maybe not that long. I wasn't important enough to even tell me that you were there? I'm trying to explain. It's because I felt you were important that I didn't tell you. I'm a big girl now, Angel. I'm not in high school anymore. A lot has happened since you left. I know. I respect that. I don't need you skulking around, trying to protect me. Unless I'm in some gigantic fight to the death... ...which I was last night. That was you helping me? I was in the neighborhood... ...skulking. That's the Slayer? That's our little Buffy. - She seemed-- - Bulgarian in that outfit? No, hurt. That happens when they're together. Come on. Where we going? They'll be here for a while. We have time for the Titanic director's cut. I'm sorry if I handled it wrong. What else was I supposed to do? I don't know. I just know that when you're around... ...whether I see you or not, I feel you. Inside. And it throws me. It throws me too. So let's stick to the plan. We'll keep our distance until a lot of time has passed. - With time, we should be able to-- - Forget? Yeah. So... ...I'm gonna go start forgetting. Angel! - You hear that? - "The Buffy and Angel Show." First they talk, then they punch. - Shouldn't we--? - Get our noses flattened? No, thank you. - Friend of yours? - Never saw it before. It was rude. We should go kill it. I'm free. Got a place I can change? It's heading towards the ocean. - Are you sure? - It's wounded, I can smell its blood. Oh, right. Handy skill. Maybe if your crack staff hadn't run off... ...they could've done some research. Find out why this thing wants to kill us. Just a rat. So you can put that down now. I don't know why you brought that. Because I know how to use it. Besides, it's a lot handier than your fighting ax. Unless he chops it in two. Can we just get on with the hunting? - I'd like this done by dark. - I can handle it. You helped me, and I want to be even. We're keeping score now. You getting anything? Because I sure smell sewer. Tunnel number one it is. Angel? You okay? I feel weird. I know. I do too I only came to see you so I could tell you face to face... ...not to see me face to face anymore. And I know there's a flaw in that logic. The next thing I knew, we were attacked by this ninja demon thing... ...and then we're on the floor on top of each other. It's just really confusing being around you. No, I meant I felt weird from the demon's blood. - It's powerful. - Oh. Okay. Let's pretend my little outburst never happened. No, it is confusing. When we're apart, it's easier. It hurts... ...every day... ...but I live with it. Now you're... ...you're right here, and I can actually reach out... ...and.... It's more than confusing. It's unbearable. But we have to bear, right? I mean, what else can we do? It doesn't work with us. It can't. No, I can't give you anything a real girl would want. No matter how much we miss each other. Or what we feel in the moment. If we let something happen... ...we'd want more. And nothing's changed. We'd only end up having to leave each other again. And that's the best-case scenario. Oh, boy. I was really jonesing for a heartbreaking sewer talk. I'm sorry.... I'm onto something back home! I'm heading toward a pretty good life, now that-- I'm out of the picture? That's why I left. You should have-- Could we just find this thing and get this finished? What if it went up? Into the day. Where he knows I can't go. But I can. I don't want you going alone. Look, it's best all around if we split up. I can handle it. There's a dive on Second near Beach, the Lone Bar. Demons go there when they need to get patched up. Got it. Be careful. I'm alive. When they fight.... - Oh, my God. - What? She killed him! Oops, it's just dust. I forgot to sweep under the rug. Trying to give me a heart attack? Don't blame me if he's too cheap to hire a cleaning lady. What's wrong? What happened? Did you do it with Buffy? Watch it, don't get too close. You walked in the front door, from the street. You've... ...got an umbrella. He's alive, Cordelia. - Alive? - Buffy and I were attacked by a demon. I tracked it and killed it.... Some of its blood mixed with mine. And you wound up with a pulse? I want to find out about that demon. My back. It hurts. - Everything's-- - More real? - Now that you're real? - Yeah. I'm mortal now. I have a mortal body. And I'm so hungry. Look out, he's gonna eat. Everything in sight. Oh, my God! Food. This is unbelievable. This is so.... It tastes so good when you're alive. They didn't even have fudge mint chip in your day. I want some. Can you get it? It'll go straight to your thighs. Chocolate. Chocolate. We need to focus here. - Try and figure out-- - I love chocolate. But not, as it turns out, yogurt. Orson! We're in a situation here. Right. I know. You're right. Let me think. Now my stomach's killing me. Cordelia... ...find Buffy in Santa Monica and tell her I killed the demon. Okay. Oh, wait! Don't tell her about me. Not until I know what it means. All right. - That's it. - It's a Mohra Demon. They're pretty powerful assassins. Soldiers of Darkness. They take out our warriors, like you and Buffy. "Needs vast quantities of salt to live." It was headed to salt water. "Veins run with the blood of eternity." There it is. Its blood has regenerative properties. Which explains what happened to me. It doesn't explain why. Who cares? The demon's dead, you're alive. It's happy, fun time. - What's going on here? - I don't know. I thought The Powers That Be had to step in. They could do this? I get the feeling you're not telling me everything. I'm not. - We're on a need-to-know basis. - I need to know. Is this permanent? Am I a normal Joe now? Can I have a normal life? I want to speak to them. That's not easy. The Powers That Be don't live in our reality. You have to go through channels. Dangerous channels. You know what? Start approaching. All right, all right. We could try the Oracles. If they turn you into a toad, don't say I didn't warn you. "The Gateway for Lost Souls... ...is under the post office"? That would make sense. The Oracles are unpredictable. Don't dilly-dally. Ask your questions, get out. Aren't you coming? I can't. I' m just a messenger, you're a warr;or. If your heart is pure, and I do this right... ..."We beseech access to the knowing ones"... ...we may just survive. You're in. Come before us, lower being. - What have you brought us? - Was I--? You bring no offering? I brought you this. I like time. There's so little and so much of it. - Well? - What's happened to me? - It's true. - He's no longer a warrior. It was the demon's blood. It wasn't The Powers That Be? "The Powers That Be." Did you save humanity? Avert the apocalypse? You faced a demon. Life goes on. My life, as a human? I'm not under some spell? The auguries say no. It was meant to be. From this day, you'll live and die as any mortal man. Privy to all pains and pleasures. You no longer serve that which we serve. You're released from your fealty. That's it, I'm free? - It didn't work. - Yes, it did. - You just went in. - What? Look at your watch. I can't. And next time remind me to bring a gift. I forgot. So, what happened? They're a little confusing. But the gist is... ...it's real. I'm free. - I can't believe this. - Me, either. What now? I've got this new life in front of me. Where do I begin? It's overwhelming. You can almost do whatever you want now. So the question is... ...what do you want? This plant was thriving just this morning. Now look at it. I'm telling you, where she leads, dark forces follow. Buffy gave it mites? How else do you explain it? - Jealousy? - I'm jealous of her? Oh, please! Just a theory. Jealous or not, our lives are about to kaleidoscope. How do you figure? Angel's only been human a day. The last two hours of which they've spent down in his apartment together. Don't they deserve some happiness after all this? Let me explain the lore here, okay? They suffer, they fight, that's normal. They get groiny with one another, the world falls apart. Well, he's not cursed anymore. - And you can't be sure they're.... - Oh, please! They've got the forbidden love of all time. They've been apart. Now he's human? I'm sure they're just having tea and crackers. - Would you like some more? - No! Thank you. - I'm sorry I kissed you. - You are? - Not for the kiss itself. - Good. Because as far as kisses go, I thought it was well above average. It was incredible. I just think... ...maybe we'd be asking for trouble, rushing back into things. Not that I don't want to rush. I do, believe me. Right. I mean, you spoke to the Oracles... ...and they said you were cured for good. But how do we know they speak for The Powers? I mean, they could be pranksters. - Or there's another loophole. - Exactly. And then we're in even deeper and it's "grrr" all over again. It'd be smart to wait a while. - See if this mortal thing takes. - Exactly. Even if it does, it's still complicated. You're still the Slayer. And I'm not sure what I am now. I don't know what my purpose is. I can't just wedge myself back into your life. It wouldn't be good. Not to mention, you just started college. And what about slaying? You might not be as focused. Are you gonna pull out a pie chart now? Because I get it. It's not necessary. I'm not saying I don't want you, Buffy. You know how much.... I'm just saying, it's worth the wait to know it's right. I need to be sure you won't get hurt. I'm glad I didn't fantasize about you turning human... ...only about 10 zillion times. Because today would've been a real letdown. So how does the mature plan go? You call me? I call you? What? We stay in touch. - Just not-- - Literally. Funny. - Okay, I'd better.... - Right. Remove the temptation. So we'll talk soon. And peanut butter, preferably crunchy. Got it. A perfect yum. This is a dream. You're human for like a minute... ...and there's fudge mint chip in the fridge. - God, I love food. - Food is good. Why didn't you tell me about chocolate and peanut butter? Well, I figured if your vamp taste buds couldn't really savor it... ...then it would only hurt you to know. By the way, I'm over the whole needing-to-be-mature thing. That time you just spent in the kitchen... ...that was enough time apart. Too much. Oh, okay. Mortal coordination leaves something to be desired. Wrong. It's just right. This is all working out nicely. I'm out of a job. Hey, not just you, you know. Who are you kidding? You know you're glad this happened. I'm glad for Angel. If that means I'm off the hook... ...with The Powers That Be, all the better. I'll be free to go out and make my own mark in the world. We had a cat that did that. Oh, God. What am I gonna do? I'm good for exactly two things... ...international superstardom... ...or helping a vampire to rid the world of evil. That makes for a short but colorful résumé. Whatever happens from here on out... ...at least I'll say goodbye... ...to the bone-crushing, head-wrenching, mind-numbing visions. - What do you see? - We got trouble. That's a good sound. Thump, thump, thump. It feels pretty amazing. I'm so glad we didn't logic ourselves out of this. We'll make it work, right? We will. I'm so sleepy. But I still want.... What? You couldn't possibly. I mean, not that I wouldn't. No, no. I'm spent. Pleasantly numb, even. You? For now. No, I want to stay awake... ...so this day can keep happening. Sleep. We'll make another one like it tomorrow. Angel? This is the first time I've ever really felt this way. What way? Just like I've always wanted to. Like a normal girl... ...falling asleep in the arms of her normal boyfriend. It's perfect. Hey. That Mohra Demon regenerated more than just you. - What? - I had a vision. It's regenerated itself. - Where? - In the tunnel. Then in a factory. I tasted salt. It could've been the margarita. It needs salt to live. It was very much alive in this vision. And angry. I'll kill it again. Yeah, but you're human now. They released you. You want to let that thing roam free? You saw it in a factory. We'll start at a saline plant in Redondo. But it can regenerate itself. We'll figure it out. Grab the book of Kelsor. You'll read, I'll drive. Doyle? I think maybe we ought to bring someone a little supernatural. Don't you want to wake the girl? Not for the world. It doesn't just come back. It comes back bigger and stronger. - We should get Buffy. - No. But this isn't your average demon. It nearly licked you before. I'm gonna have to do this on my own. I can't keep risking Buffy's life every time-- Just tell me how to kill it. "It regenerates until dark future it envisions is upon us...." "To slay the beast one must bring darkness to 1000 eyes." I only saw two. Stay glib. It makes me think we have a chance. - Easy. - The blood. It's never an easy sight. It's part of being human. I'm gonna kill this thing. Just remember that it's brutal, deadly and...here! Angel? Cordelia. - Is this antique? - Byzantine. Where's Angel? I won't feel sorry for myself. I'm organizing a little going-out-of-business sale... ...to subsidize the severance package Angel never set up for me. Did he leave a message? I'm in pain here, and all you can do is talk about Angel. Have you thought of how this turning-human thing might affect me? Regrettably, no. Look, if you know where he is, just tell me. - He told me not to tell you. - Is he in trouble? Are we in second grade here? Tell me. Maybe it's time you grew up... ...and realized that you can't have everything. You can't have Angel and save the world. Anyway, it's your fault he went to fight that thing without-- What thing? The End of Days has begun and cannot be stopped. For any one of us that falls, 10 shall rise. You hurt my boyfriend. - A great darkness is coming. - You got that right. This is the great warrior of darkness? Together, you were powerful. Alone, you are dead. - What do you think of the warrior now? - A little bland. Needs salt. A thousand eyes. Smash the jewel in his forehead! Buffy, are you...? Shh, shh. Don't talk. You're all right. That's all that matters. You're all right. It's over. And we're together. You again? - What have you brought me? - A rose vase. Ching Dynasty. Circa 1811. Lovely. Why are you here, lower being? The Mohra Demon said the End of Days had begun. That others were coming, the Soldiers of Darkness. - Was he telling the truth? - As far as such things can be told. What happens to the Slayer? What happens to all mortal beings. Albeit, sooner in her case. She'll die. Then I'm here to beg for her life. It is not our place to grant life and death. And ask you to take mine back. I can't protect her or anyone as a Man. You're asking to be what you were, a demon with a soul... ...because of the Slayer? This is a matter of love. It does not concern us. Yes, it does. The Mohra Demon came to take a warrior from your cause, and it succeeded. I'm no good to you like this. I know you have it in your power to make this right. Please. What is done cannot be undone. What is not yet done can be avoided. We are not to indulge the whims of lower beings. You are wrong. This one is willing to sacrifice... ...every drop of human happiness and love... ...he's ever known for another. He is not a lower being. There is one way. But it is not to be undertaken lightly. We swallow this day, as though it never happened. Twenty-four hours from the moment the demon first attacked you... ...we take it back. Then none of this happened... ...Buffy and I. But what'll stop us from doing the exact same thing? You. You alone will carry the memory of this day. Can you carry that burden? I'm guessing that expression isn't because... ...they were out of fresh OJ at the deli. - What happened? - Nothing happened. I just.... Where have you been? I went to see the Oracles. I asked them to turn me back. What? Why? Because more than ever I know how much I love you. No. No, you didn't. And if I stay mortal, one of us will wind up dead. Maybe both of us. - You heard what Mohra said. - We killed him. - He said others would come. - They will always come. That's my problem now, not yours. I won't stand by and let you fight, maybe die, alone. - Then we fight together. - Buffy... ...I'm a liability to you. You take chances to protect me. It's bad for you and the people we need to help. So, what? You just took a whole 24 hours to weigh the ups and downs... ...of being a regular Joe and decided it was more fun being a superhero? You know that's not it. How can we be together if the cost is your life? Or the lives of others? I know. I couldn't tell you. I wasn't sure I could do it if I woke up with you one more morning. I understand. So, what happens now? The Oracles are giving us back the day, turning back time... ...so I can kill Mohra before his blood makes me mortal. When? Another minute. A minute? No. - No, it's not enough time. - We don't have a choice. How am I supposed to go on with my life... ...knowing what we had, what we could've had? You won't. No one will know but me. - Everything we did. - It never happened. It did. It did. I know it did. I felt your heartbeat. Buffy. Oh, God. It's not enough time. Please. Please, please, please. I'll never forget. I'll never forget. I'll never forget. I'll never forget. So then, let's just stick to the plan. Keep our distance until time has passed. - Given enough time we can-- - Forget. Yeah. So... ...I'm gonna go... ...start forgetting. That was unreal. - How did you know how to kill it? - It's a Mohra Demon. I've had time to catch up on my reading. Yeah. Okay. - So I guess we've covered it. - Guess we did.
