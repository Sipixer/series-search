Why is it taking you so long to figure out that word? I don't know. The prophecies were written over the last 4000 years... ...in a dozen languages, some of which aren't human!. Let's get a demon to suck my brain out. That would speed things up. He's testy while translating. It's pivotal to what it prophesies for the vampire with a soul. Hurry and find out about Angel. I want to know what it says about me. If there is torrid romance in my future, massive wealth. I'll settle for enviable fame. It's an ancient sacred text, not a Magic 8-Ball. - Nobody gets my humor. - I thought it was funny. Oh. Hey, guys? Remember the lawyer who wanted out of Wolfram and Hart? - Lindsey? - They promoted him. Junior partner. After all you did, he sells his soul for 30 pieces of silver. Actually, he sold it for a six-figure salary and a benefits package. It's disappointing. He had an opportunity to change. He didn't take it. What? A little late for visitors. - Mr. Nabbit? - David? Heart in my throat. - I'm sorry. - That was awesome. Can we do it again? Are you-- Do you need help? Me? No, I just popped by to hang. I blew off a meeting. Tonight I'm dungeon master. - What do you think of my cape? - Shiny. You guys want to hang? Oh, wow, wow, wow. This is where it all happens. They're helpless, in agony. They have no one to turn to so they come here to you. Drink that coffee, sit on this couch. Unspeakable fiends of hell hot on their heels. What did I do today? Spun off my digital-pager network, made a million. All right, several. Big whoop. What does that mean? No more shopping in the PennySaver? It's just, you guys... ...your lives are so meaningful, so exciting. You fight demons! One could walk right through that door! You seen any cool demons lately? This hallowed ground is made ready. His time is at hand. For as it was written, he of pure darkness shall come into light. Welcome. I hope you had a pleasant journey. You, you guys are.... I never know what's going to happen here. - Good to see you. - You too. - Drop by again. - We'll hang soon. I know what it means. A very wealthy man with just no life at all? No. The word in the scroll. - That "shoe-shine" thing? - Shanshu. If it isn't Phygian but descends from the ancient Magyars... ...then the root is Proto-Ugaric. In which case it would mean.... We're waiting. Death. You said it was about the vampire with the soul. Angel's going to die? Oh. Anything else? He took that well. Is this a good time to talk about my raise? It's probably years off, after the coming battles. My raise? Apocalyptic prophecies aren't a science. And I could be way off the mark so no reason to be concerned. So it's good you're not concerned. Not even remotely concerned. - Pain...killer. - Painful, killer demon. Painkiller! A woman. Judging by the bag on her head, I'm guessing homeless. - Versus a slime demon. - Where? I smelled something awful, that would be the slime demon... ...who lives behind a waste treatment plant in El Segundo. - Do you need-- - Stay here and take care of her. - Enough with the smelly visions! - Here we are. Thanks. If I ever meet The Powers That Be, I'll punch them in the nose! You think they have a nose? You lost the scroll of Aberjian? - It was stolen from our vault. - We need it for the raising. - We understand. - It was my mistake. I'll fix it. You will do nothing. I will retrieve the scroll myself. Who stole it? - Angel. - Angel. I am summoned for the raising... ...the thing that was to bring him to us... ...tear him from The Powers That Be, and he has the scroll? We're aware of the irony. He possesses the prophecies. His connection is complete. - He hasn't had time to study the text. - No, and he won't. Access to The Powers shall be cut off from him and the scroll returned. - What can we do to help? - Leave it to me. Well, end of discussion. Told you. She listens to the nut calls on her scanner. Sure she doesn't use her brain chip? Detective, there was a lot of "otherworldly howling and wailing." Something about something slimy dragging a woman. I heard the call. Stay here. - You want backup, detective? - Or a Ouija board? You turn your back and they come for you. - You're safe now. - You sliced him up real good. He saved me from one of their spies. I don't appreciate the dental association watching me like that. - Hi. - What was it? - It won't hurt anyone else. - What was it? Slime demon. This town has everything. Demons, fiends, vampires.... I know this isn't easy for you. Most people can't deal with it. You should think about-- Someone who's not even a person lecturing me on most people. It's kind of funny. I can handle it fine. I don't care about most people or what they think. I do care about ridding this city of your kind. - My kind? - Your kind. The kind that killed my father. You think I would forget about it? I don't forget anything. Death. Every source says it's death. It's just a prophecy. It didn't come from on high. That's what a prophecy is. All right. Angel faces death all the time... ...just like a normal guy faces waffles and French fries. It's something he faces every day, like lunch. Are you hungry? The fact his death is prophesied... ...doesn't concern me as much as the way he reacted. What? He didn't scream as some of us would have. Angel's cool. Angel's cut off. Death doesn't bother him because there's nothing in life he wants. It's our desires that make us human. Angel's kind of human. He's got a soul. He's got a soul, but he's not a part of the world. He can't be part of the world. Because he doesn't want stuff? That's ridiculous. - I want that! - What connects us to life? I'm going with doughnuts. What connects us to life is the simple truth that we are part of it. We live, we grow, we change. - But Angel.... - Can't do those things. Well, what are you saying? That Angel has nothing to look forward to? - He'll always be here but cut off? - Yes. That sucks! We've gotta do something. - We have to help him. - I'm not sure we can. What is your deal? You bore everyone with your musty scrolls... ...then you say we can't help? - He is what he is. - He's Angel. He's good. And he helps the helpless, and now he's one of them. He's gonna have to want things from life... ...whether he wants to or not! - Morning. - Morning. Want some coffee? No, thanks. - How about a doughnut? Chocolate. - No. - Creamy fillings? - I don't want anything. Should I know what this is about? We were just discussing how you don't... ...want many things. You're cut off from life, and we want to help. - Good. - We'll start small. Keep it simple. How would you like a puppy? Right. A ficus? They're low-maintenance. Ant farm? - I have to go. - Where are you going? Rare book shops. I need references to translate the prophecy. Not smart to take the scroll with me. I'll lock it up in the weapons cabinet. Angel, I hope I'm wrong about this, but... ...you should see the Oracles. I don't need the Oracles. Well, think about it. Oracles. Get out of the house. Could be fun. - How dare you enter this sacred space? - Who are you? We don't like being called by a lower being. Never come here on a whim. - I'm not here on a whim. - We do not counsel your kind. Darkness is not allowed past this threshold. How did you get in? The old order passes away and the new order is come. He that was first will be last, and he that was dead shall arise. Yes, and he that is trespassing shall now depart. We shall speak no more. Yes, I know. Do you paint? I was looking for something for a friend. I thought maybe if he had a hobby.... He's a little detached. They say art is the best therapy. - Really? - Sure. It's used in mental institutions. Creating helps them get in touch. He's not crazy or anything. He's just different. Depressed. Well, he wears a lot of black. - How much are these pastels? - You get the entire set... ...some drawing paper and little pop-up easel.... You have everything he'll need, and then some. Thanks. - You're welcome. - He must be a good friend. - Yeah. Thank you. - Take care. Bye. Someone get some help! Call 911! Hello? Yeah, what happened to her? I'm her employer. She doesn't have any family in town. What happened? I'm on my way. I'm looking for Cordelia Chase. The doctor is with her. If you'll just have a seat. You have to let the doctor work! Try another five mils of Ativan. - Leave. - What happened? - Are you family? - Yes. I'm not sure what happened. - Is she mentally ill? - No. She's having a psychotic episode. There's no organic damage, but we can't seem to sedate her. Cordelia, can you hear me? Cordelia! Cordelia! - We tried drug therapy. Allergies? - Drugs won't help. I need to inform you, if we don't find a way to stop it.... Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! Wes! Wes, Wesley! Never a dull moment. - I have to go. - You're a witness. You can't go. - Want to try to stop me? - I'm glad we're not friends. I'm tired of you. There is a thing called the law! This is about life. I'm sorry about your father, but I didn't kill him. I'm tired of being blamed for what you can't handle! You want to be enemies? Try me. Clear! Okay, I got him back. Cordelia. I'm gonna fix this. I promise. I'm gonna get you back. I need you back. I come before the Oracles for guidance and direction. I ask access to the knowing ones. It's unfortunate. Things are unraveling. The dark ones broach our temples now. - Can you help me? - I can't stay long. I've been dead a while. So far I don't like it. - My friend-- - Is in trouble. It's his mark. - Who did it? - Vocah, warrior of the underworld. He wants you weak, so he opened her mind to all those in pain and need. - She doesn't have long. - How can I stop it? Vocah has the scroll of Aberjian. The scroll is what you need. - Wait. - Find the scroll. The words of Anatole can save your friend. - Where is he? - He is here for the raising. - The raising? - Like many, he hides behind man's law. Stop him. I will. Hungry people will appreciate this. This is God's work. If God was a busboy he'd look like you, Jesus. Toss it up, brother. All right! Heads up! Put them down. I know him. - What you got under the hood? - I need your help. I know you didn't come to see how I am. I'm fine. You getting enough iron? You look a little pale. It's traditional to humor people that do favors for you. I need another. If it's killing a vampire, I'm in. That's my idea of a good time. My people are in the hospital. One's in ICU, one's in the psych unit. They need protection. Who's coming for them? However he comes, he will fail. These people mean a lot to me. I'm getting that. We have prepared a holy place and anointed it with oil. We took the blood of the living and gathered the living dead. As it was written, they shall prepare the way... ...and the very gates of hell shall open. That which is above shall tremble... ...for that which is below shall arise. And the world shall know the beast... ...and the beast shall know the world. Are we late? Never be on time for a ritual. The chanting and blood rites go on forever. You guys follow us. - I know you covered all the bases. - Yes. Senior partners are watching this. - We can't let them down. - We won't. Robert Price let them down and they made him eat his liver. I don't know why I thought of that. - Five are without breath. - Yet they live. - Five are without time. - Yet they live. - Five are without soul. - Yet they live. They haven't even gotten to the Latin yet. - Five are without sun. - Yet they live. - What is it? - I don't know. Lindsey. Five are dead. - Say it! - Yet they live. - Get the movers. - Yes, sir. Get it out of here. Nice. Lindsey, give me the scroll. No. It belongs to us. "Us." You put your faith in Wolfram and Hart. - You said I had to make a choice. - And you did. Yeah. I had a crisis. I want to thank you for your help with that. - I see things more clearly now. - You don't see at all. I see that this was foretold and that doesn't bode well for you. I see that you're either the one with the power or powerless. Do you see what I'll do if I don't get the scroll? You need this to cure your friend. She is your link to The Powers. And since it's foretold that we sever all your connections, well.... Don't believe everything you're foretold. "And if the beast shalt find thee, and touch thee... ...thou shalt be wounded in thy soul... ...and thou shalt know madness. The beast shalt attack and cripple thee... ...and thou shalt know neither friend nor family. But thou shalt undo the beast. Thou shalt find the sacred words of Anatole... ...and thou shalt be restored. Three times shalt thou say these words: Unbind, unbind, unbind." - Hey. - Angel. Welcome back. I'll get Dr. Evans. I saw them all. There is so much pain. We have to help them. We will. We will. - Here is something. - What? The beast of Amalfi, a razor-toothed, six-eyed harbinger of death. No, wait, that's due to arise in 2003 in Reseda. I would've guessed Tarzana. Better cross-reference that. I don't know what they raised in that box. I'll keep looking. You've been looking for two days. You need to relax and recharge. Here. Eat. You too. Don't be embarrassed. We're family. What? It's just I'm not used to.... He's not used to the new you. I know what's out there now. We have a lot of evil to fight, a lot of people to help. I hope you can figure out what the lawyers raised... ...sometime before the prophecy kicks in, and you croak. - That was the old me, wasn't it? - I like them both. Oops. I may have made a mistake. The word that I said meant you were going to die... ...means that you are going to live. Okay, as tiny mistakes go, that's not one. Shanshu has roots in many languages. The most ancient is the Proto-Bantu. They consider life and death the same thing. It's part of a cycle. Only a thing that's not alive never dies. It's saying you get to live until you die. It's saying.... It's saying you become human. That's the prophecy? "The vampire with a soul, once he fulfills his destiny... ...will shanshu." Become human. It's his reward. Wow. Angel, human. That'd be nice. Wait. What's that thing about him having to fulfill his destiny first? It's saying it won't happen tomorrow or the next day. He has to survive coming darkness, apocalyptic battles, plagues... ...and some... ...several, not that many... ...fiends that will be unleashed upon the world. So don't break out the champagne just yet. Yeah, break out the champagne, Pinocchio. This is a big deal. I guess it is. Typical. I hook up with the only person who came to L.A. to get older. The senior partners were impressed with your sacrifice. Trust me. We'll even the score with him. Yes, we will. Beginning with what's in that box. We are all very pleased you're here. I know it's a bit confusing...
