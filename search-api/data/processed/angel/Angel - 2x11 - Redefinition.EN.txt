- Senses their futures. - Only when they sing karaoke. They brought her back. I need to know why. Why like this? Why human? I believe you said something about a massacre. For God's sake, help us. - People are going to die. - I can't seem to care. - What you did-- - Is wrong. You went too far. The three of us are all that's standing between you and real darkness. You're all fired. What just happened? Can someone explain to me what happened? - We were fired. - Canned. - Let go. - Axed. - Dismissed. - Booted. All right. I get it. But what just happened? Fired? Angel fired us? Looks that way. - I can't believe it. - Keep a level head. Perhaps he'll change his mind. He locked 20 lawyers in a room with two vampires. - I'd say his mind's changed enough. - Darla! It's all about Darla. Well, at least Angel's consistent. It's always some blond driving him over the edge. - What do we do now? - Think I'll get a burrito. What? By all means, if you're hungry. Hey, this was just a side gig. The extra cash was nice... ...but Angel wants to go commando.... No skin off my nose. Well, my nose skin is angry. And hurt. - And-- - Disappointed? I won't pretend to understand Angel's reasons. But maybe he needs to be alone now. And the best thing we can do for him is to let him be. Alone. I'm not ready yet, Too many years sleeping in soft beds... ...living in a world where I don't belong, I can't fight now, Not yet, But soon, - Sir, you should be in a hospital. - She saved me. - You should be checked out by a doctor. - There's gotta be a reason. - Why am I the only one left? - You're in shock. I'm the only one left. Hey, we've got a live one here. We do? Ma'am, can you stand up? Lilah. You've gotta be kidding me, He fired you? You're on a mission to protect the innocent. He can't fire you. What did he say, exactly? - "You're fired." - Oh. Can you file a grievance with the union? I'm not in a union. I'm-- I don't even know what the name of my job is. Was. You're a renowned specialist in supernatural aid and rescue. No, I'm just-- Renowned? To me you are. You saved my life. But you should be in a union. Father used union conjurers. - I didn't know. - Wizards are very progressive. Your father tried to sacrifice you. And I'll never talk to him again. Although I'm healing, thanks to a lot of therapy and a huge trust fund. You know what it is? He's jealous. - Your father? - No, Angel. You impersonated him to rescue me, and you were too good. I don't think so. He fired Cordy and Gunn too. All of you? Why? It has to do with Darla being made a vampire again... ...and being with Drusilla. The three of them have a very tangled past. I guess he doesn't want us in his way. Well, his loss. You'll get another job, just like that. What else can you do? Not much. When Wolfram & Hart take a life, they do it at a distance, I don't have that luxury, It's time, I'm not on their level, But I can get there, And when I do, I'll be right up close, I'll bring the fight to them, No messages? Are you sure? Check-- Thanks. - Getting the freeze-out? - Lilah.... You bitter because Darla didn't kill me? - More like bummed. - Sorry to disappoint. So I'm not the only one feeling the lack of empathy. - What? - No phone calls. No flowers. I could be nervous, but I'm just pissed. We're the only survivors. We're under suspicion. I don't like suspicion. Next we'll turn up dead in some freak accident. We did nothing wrong. That has nothing to do with it. If they're looking for a scapegoat, we might as well grow horns. A scapegoat, Lilah? They-- They wanted Drusilla brought in. I was following orders. And you honestly think that matters? Don't doubt for a minute someone's gonna pay, Lindsey. And we're the only ones left. Not the only ones. Lindsey, I've missed you. Close the door. If we'd wanted you dead, you'd have never made it out of the cellar. Now close the door. He's got cow eyes, big and black. Moo.... You spared me. Why did you spare me, Darla? Do you really have to ask? I love you. Shut up, Lilah. Look at you two. Such pretty scars. You put us in a difficult position. Did I? Smart young lawyers, hungry for their big break and... ...oops, boss gets eaten. Someone's got to step in. Someone pretty, with questionable ethics... ...and $1200 suits that look good on the 6:00 news. You think they'll promote him? Or you. In any case, that's why you're here. I've decided to keep the line of communication open... ...between us and Wolfram & Hart. - What for? - We can help each other. What is it exactly that you want, Darla? Power. During my stint as Wolfram & Hart's puppet, something occurred to me: I loathe being used. I believe I sent you a 15-body memo to that effect. We're gonna be big players in this town. You don't have what I want, but you have what I need. Money. Connections. We're no good to you dead. The senior partners are looking for someone to blame for your massacre. Surely they wouldn't kill both of you. Seems like a waste. Well, I guess whoever's left standing will be our liaison. - Liaison to what? - To the world above. In the meantime, we'll focus on the world below. This power that you want, does it have a target? - Maybe Angel? - Don't say that. Not everything is about Angel. I just want to have some fun. I thought you would make him your top priority. I spent 250 years without Angel. You think being human made me go all gooey? No. No, I thought you'd kill him. All in good time, my love. All in good time. They were just waiting for us. All crouched and hiding in that little back room. I don't usually hit the fast food places. The people are all greasy. But this was like Christmas! I'm ready, I've got the moves, Now I need to know what theirs are, - Bloody mary. - Want real blood? No. Bloodless, thanks. Thank you. We'll take a break and see who wants to sing next. Steady on, Wesley. Perhaps something by... ...Cat Stevens. - Your drink, sir. - Oh. Thank you. - Wesley! - Cordelia! How... ...odd to see you. What are you doing here? Me? Oh, I just came in for a drink. Because only demon karaoke bars have those. - You were gonna sing. - Dear Lord, no. No. I merely-- - What are you doing here? - Oh! Ah, well.... - I was in the neighborhood - You live 15 miles away. Well, you know L.A. It's all one really big neighborhood. I see. Come to find your destiny, have you? - And who is gonna help you? - Shania Twain or Madonna. I haven't decided. We're both at loose ends, since Angel-- - Pulled a total wig. - Quite. - I'm somewhat embarrassed-- - How do you think I feel? Gunn, what are you...? You said this was just a side gig. I can't have you seeing through my macho exterior. Oh, heavens forfend. I'll assume it's not Madonna. What song were you gonna sing? You wouldn't know it. I, for one, would like to point out the patheticness that is us. This is all Angel's fault. Hope he's happy now. Alone in his demon world with no one to talk to. I'll talk! I'm telling you, I don't know-- Is this how you get your rocks off? All right! All right! I heard about your girls. Godzilla, Darcilla, whatever. They've been looking for demons... ...to join some crew they're running. That's all I know, man, I swear. Okay! Okay! Okay! You didn't hear this from me but... ...you know that Bar and Bite Club off La Cienega and Washington? That's the only demon haunt they ain't been to. Hey, you're gonna cut me down, right? You're gonna leave me hanging? Hey! Hey! I'm spinning here, man! Freaking vampires. Wow, that was something. But no victims? That's where you lose me. - Who are you? - I'm Darla and this is Drusilla. Some of you know us by reputation. I never heard of you before. Now you never will. I trust we have everyone's attention. Good. We've come with a little proposition. Me and my girl aren't just the new thing in town... ...we're the only thing in town. And we're in the market for some-- Well, one doesn't really want to use the term "muscular slaves." Actually, one does. We're only looking for the best. Those creatures who not only excel at devastation, but revel in it. Our crusade is one of malevolent joy. - Eyes like needles. - Dru, I'm working here. He sees you. Sees what you were. - He'll never be alone again. - Stop. Just don't. He's watching you, my sweet, right now. Angel. He wants to punish us. He thinks we've been naughty. - He remembers when you were warm. - Shut up! As I was saying, if you think you have what it takes to join us... ...auditions are tonight, at this address. Winners get to foment mass destruction. Losers will be gutted and left for dead. Have a nice night. Come on. I'm not ready, Angel. I can still feel her, Her pain, Her need, Her hope, I'm too close, Too close to fight her, Lilah. Something happen? I can't do it anymore, Lindsey. - Do what? - The waiting. I sit in my office... ...and every time there's a noise or the phone rings.... - One of us is gonna die. - Everybody dies. But not everybody ends up turned into dog food. You got a 50-50 chance of surviving this thing, just like me. It's not good enough. - There's a way out. - How? We don't wait for them to choose. We choose each other instead. If we stick together, we can win. We could leave. You and me, tonight. - They'd have no choice-- - They'd hunt us down. No. Not if we took files as insurance. - Take files? - Yes. Look, I've heard the rumors. We both know it worked for you once before. You knew just what to take. You won't have to assume any of the risk. Just tell me which files to steal, and I'll get them. And then we can get out of here... ...and this mess, together. Are you in? Lilah, I would never steal files. I'm shocked at the suggestion. Forget about the frame job. They're gonna kill who they want. Just take it like a man. But see, That's what I'm saying. If Wesley hadn't been shaking his finger... That's what I'm saying. If Wesley hadn't been shaking his finger... ...and no, no, no, this whole Darla thing would have just... ...blown over. - What? - Blown over? - Obsessions don't just blow over. - Right. Well, you certainly didn't help by making him feel guilty about it. You shamed him into firing us. - You're blaming this on me? - Not blaming-- Yes, I'm blaming you. You get the blame. If I had to listen to you two, day in, day out, bitch, bitch, bitch! I would have killed you. That's rich, coming from... ...Mr. I-Don't-Take-Orders- Now-Where-Do-I-Stick-My-Ax? - What do you mean? - You've never... ...been very supportive of Angel's leadership role. - I remember a shroud-- - Hold on. Are you saying this is my fault? Well, you won't follow his directives. Was one of his directives, "Hire pansy-ass British guy"? My ass is not pansy. - You kids need another round? - Yes! What about her? Maybe if she'd had visions... ...Angel would've been too distracted to think about Darla. You have an obsession, you squeeze it into your schedule, no matter what! - So you admit it's an obsession? - No. I mean, yes, but no. - Hypocrite. - Ass-pansy! We are the champions We are the champions No time for losers Cuz we are the champions Vampires. Sloth demons. You know what's really, really evil? Tequila. - I need to be dead now. - Well, well. I can see the maudlin segment of tonight's binge is in full swing. Oh, don't be blue. I was very impressed with your musical recitation of pain. And when I say pain, I mean mine. You sang your hearts out. Yeah. Our hearts were out. You, Mr. Big Mojo Guy... ...are supposed to give us guidance now. She's right. We came, we sang, we-- We fought the urge to regurgitate. So spill, already. Not you. What are we supposed to do with our lives? Where do we go from here? Oh, I'd love to tell you, sweetie. But when the big guys talk, I shut my yap. And they're about to get real chatty. - You all right? - No! - What'd you see? - Alley. Not too far from here. A demon's dragging a girl. She's hurt. Bleeding. Let's go. I don't get it. Are we late? - We didn't feel late in my head. - Over here. It's hers. It's gotta be hers. But where is she? - If we had Angel, we could track her. - He'd also kill that demon. Did I mention his teeth? - I wish Angel was here. - Well, he's not. Angel's walked away from his duty. We're not going to. - So how do we find her? - Start with basics. First, we examine the area for any tell-tale signs... ...of a particular kind of-- Ew. There's different kinds of "ew"? No. Look. He took her up there. The building's abandoned. The front door was chained. How are we supposed to--? I didn't like that barkeeper. Can't get his eyes off my fingers. It's nearly midnight. We should get to the factory. My little bird is anxious. Recruiting demons is stressful, Dru. - He won't leave. - I don't wanna hear it. We could have 1000 soldiers, and he'll still come. Galloping. Who says this is about Angel? Can't I wreak havoc without him being involved? You miss him, like a heartbeat. I don't miss my heartbeat. It was a symptom of a disease I've been cured of. In a perfect world, Angel would be here... ...helping me torch this city. It's his job. But where is he? Probably flogging himself in church. Ooh, flogging! Ooh, churches.... We should be slaughtering the innocent. Laughing, as we rain destruction on this town. I see such pretty fire. Fire. Conflagration. In a perfect world, there'd be nothing here but ashes. And pain. So much suffering. The flames are lovely. They dance, and the fire licks like a cat. And the screams. Oh, it's like star music. That's nice, Dru. Now hurry up. We can't be late. It's always the same. A smelly, old, abandoned building. Are there no hideouts in Beverly Hills? Several, as a matter-- Look. Over there. That's her. But where's the--? Get her out of here! Come on, we-- - Get her to a hospital. - Yeah. - What about you? - I'm fine. It's just-- We should go before I pass out. Or possibly during. Nearly ripped us to shreds. But out of everybody here, which one of us is dead? Let's make this quick, okay? We weed out the losers and get out. I've got little patience left. Oh, it's beautiful! Dank and dark. It reeks of death. That's motor oil, Dru. Could we buy it? It could be our castle. We're broke. Though I suppose Lindsey could help out in that respect. - If they haven't killed him yet. - I like the girl. She's wicked. Sweet kids. Naive, but they're only human. I doubt they know what Wolfram & Hart's true plan for Angel is. But I have to say, my curiosity is piqued. Ten little soldiers all in a line A shot rings out, down to nine Ten? I'd be happy if we can find three who can hack it. Dead already? Bad soldiers! I should have known. A shadow. Why so far away, my love? Why don't you come over here and stake me? Angel? Angelus? Make it stop, please! That wasn't Angel. He's gone. He's all gone. It hurts! It hurts! It wasn't Angelus, either. Darla, help me! Help me, please.... Who was that? - And the fire? - They're alive. - Undead. - Whatever. - It was Angel. - So? Killed a dozen demons. Set the girls on fire. - Your point? - A little grimmer than usual. - Holland's vision lives. - Screw it. If anybody's going down, it's gonna be you. If that's what it takes. Sit down. I suppose you know why you're here. The senior partners have decided... ...that this should be a time of grief and reflection. We can never replace Holland Manners. He was a man of extraordinary talents. This leaves us with an opening in our roster. We need an executive vice president... ...of special projects. Mr. McDonald... ...your conduct at this firm has proved spotty, at best. You've stolen files, cooperated with our enemy... ...and disobeyed orders time and again. Miss Morgan, when you drove away the telekinetic Bethany Chaulk... ...you lost us a powerful potential assassin. Both of you have been negligent about informing us... ...of visits from certain ladies. Who, lest we forget... ...ate the majority of our contracts department. The truth is, neither one of you are qualified... ...to run special projects. As for your relationship to one another... ...your competition has been... ...vicious, destructive and... ...healthy for each other. That's why we've decided... ...to appoint you both as acting co-vice presidents... ...until such time as we see fit to narrow it down. Congratulations. This is a big step. The senior partners will be watching you. We're keeping the agency open. With or without you. You've turned your back on your mission, but we haven't. Someone has to fight the good fight.
