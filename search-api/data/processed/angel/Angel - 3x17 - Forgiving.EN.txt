Everything he's done for me, for us. - Sounds like a nice cult. - The vampire will devour his child, - Wesley's taken the baby away. - Everything you said is true. - You have to get to a hospital. - No, I just need to do this. - It went well? - Yes. Hello, I'm your father. - Come any closer, I'll snap his neck! - You will give us the kid. - We want the child dead. - Take him. You're looking into the darkest of the dark worlds. - Take him! - No! You've reached Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, leave a message. Wesley? Wesley, it's Fred, Please, if you're there, pick up, Please, Wesley? Wesley, it's Fred, If you're there, pick up, - Please. - Fred? It doesn't make sense. - He wouldn't take Angel's child. - He did. It's Wesley. Why would he do that? - We find him, we'll ask. - If Angel finds him-- He'll kill him, and we won't be able to ask. I should stay here in case he comes back. You go find Angel before-- Wesley's not coming back. No toothbrush, no razor, no Mossberg 12-gauge he kept in the closet. He wouldn't betray us. And he wouldn't leave without saying something to me... ...not unless he had a hell of an urgent reason! I don't think you're gonna find it there. Where are his diaries? - He kept diaries. - They're not here or at the office. Which is where we should be going to get a heads up on Angel. - We gotta find his diaries. - We gotta find him. If he was answering his cell, he would've the first 40 times. You telling me to quit trying? Sorry. Don't be. Keep trying. Come on, Wes, give us something. What are they doing here? So we can continue training. No more training, and no more practice. From here out, everything is real. Where's Captain Holtz? He escaped. With the vampire's child. As he and I planned. Captain asked me to pass on his praise. He wanted me to say that you fought valiantly... ...and with honor. - Where are they? The captain and--? - Gone. For good. - What are we supposed to do? - He told us to finish what he started. We're going to kill Angelus. I don't believe it. It's true. No, it can't be. The baby's not gone. I'm sorry, sweetie, but he is. Not like that. Not a portal. There's pulling, and there's noise... ...and there's nothing to hold on to, nothing at all. Baby.... He must have been so scared. I know. This is making less and less sense. You're saying that Wesley walked up to Holtz and handed over Connor? They'd been meeting secretly. I read that before Wesley attacked me. Then you read him wrong. He wasn't taking him for a stroll, Charles. When he left with that child, he didn't plan on coming back, ever. God. Why? All I care about is getting my son back. Then I'll deal with those responsible. They'll all pay... ...including Wesley. - Quor-toth dimension. Hear of it? - No. That's where the portal led. That's where my son is now. - Find out everything you can. - Yes. - We're going there, aren't we? - I am. - You're not going alone. - We're with you all the way. - Good. - It's just.... - What? - Don't we need to open a portal? - Yeah. - The last time we had to do that-- It wasn't any of us that knew how. The guy that figured it out-- - How can we do this without--? - We don't need him. - We don't? - No. We're gonna find the son of a bitch who opened the portal. His name's Sahjhan, some kind of interdimensional demon. He's been behind this since the beginning. So, Sahjhan. - Linwood. - Not much of a handshake... ...what with being incorporeal and all. You didn't mention you'd met. And with Angel too, apparently. All behind my back. No, it wasn't. It's all in my report, which I was making sure would be on your desk. Very considerate of you. That Angel. He sure keeps us hopping, doesn't he? We're in a war you can never win, Lilah... ...full of sticky moral quandaries. The side you choose should always be mine. If it's any consolation, I did have a gun to my head. Yes, I know. I'm sorry that happened. So Sahjhan opened a door to the Quor-toth... ...and in went Holtz and baby? - That's the long and short of it. - I know you made every effort... ...to preserve that baby for us. Gun at my head. Still, a big win for Holtz. If you call jumping into a cesspool hell dimension a win. Well, certainly not for us. I can't find Sahjhan. You sure you heard that? - Maybe you're not spelling it right. - I've tried every permutation. It could be a nickname, which would be in... ...Phisto 's Dictionary of Demons and Dimensional Spirits, Okay. But it's in Ga-Shundi, and I don't read Ga-Shundi. - You check the files? - Cordy's filing system isn't in English. She kept a list of time, space and shifting entities. - Under time, space or entities? - Let's just check them all. It's Monday. What time is it in Mexico? - What are you doing? - Calling Cordelia. - Why? - Why? - I don't want to ruin her holiday. - Angel... ...don't you think she'd want us to call? - Shouldn't we tell her what happened? - No. - Angel-- - She'll be back soon... ...and she'll have presents for Connor. He's going to be here so she can give them to him, okay? Okay. I'm sorry. No. This isn't working. Forget about all this, I've got to go. - Did he just say to forget about this? - Yeah, he did. You don't think he's decided to go deal with... - ...those responsible, do you? - We need to find Wesley. Yeah. Bro. Bro! Are you alive? Can you talk? Muggers, bastards. They leave you any I.D.? This wasn't no mugging. Now, you.... I talked to a couple of different sources like you asked. Angel, the news isn't good. This Quor-toth dimension is.... Everyone I spoke to is afraid of it. And these are not easily rattled people, and that's not all. The portal you saw opened wasn't a portal. There are no portals to Quor-toth. The only way in... ...is to rip right through the fabric of reality. This isn't about an interdimensional hot spot or conjuring an opening. To get to Quor-toth would require dark magics... ...the kind of power it takes centuries to build. I know this isn't easy for you, but you gotta hear it. Even if you get in, finding Connor would be like... ...looking for a needle in a haystack. The size of China. Needles. Should have thought of that. We don't have the resources to conjure up that much dark power. Oh, I think we do. Angel? - Who is this? - Linwood Murrow. Division president of Special Projects at Wolfram and Hart. - And you are? - Deeply troubled. You and Angel have a lot in common... ...abducting an employee of Wolfram and Hart. Then again, he might be too troubled to consider the consequences. Once the firm finds out what you've done-- They'd kill you before they'd kill me. Angel... ...this isn't a slimy demon you've got trussed up here. He's human. Marginally, but still, this won't bring Connor back. He better hope it does. What are you doing? At last count, the charges were kidnapping, assault and battery and-- None of which I intend to press. In fact... ...let's not press anything, shall we? Wanna find your son? The full force and faith... ...of Wolfram and Hart will be at your disposal. Who is Sahjhan, and how do I get my hands on him? If you'll just hit 3 on my speed dial.... Cell phone in my jacket pocket. Hello, Lilah? I'm sending over a client... ...and listen carefully because I have explicit instructions... ...on how to deal with him. Give him anything he wants. You should get a yard dog, because anybody could just walk in. - Getting in isn't the hard part. - Is that what happened to Wes? You lured him in, made sure he couldn't get out? He's a big boy. - He knew what he was doing. - Where is he? - Why should I care? - I'm telling you to. Great, let's have more violence. It's such a help. We lost a child, you lost Holtz. Isn't that enough already? No. So kill everybody? That'll make you happy? Oh. There is no happy for you. You're all living in here together, sharing everything. Except taking out the trash, I guess. I imagine losing Holtz is like losing a father. Or worse. The trash. I'll explain that later. Time for you to go. We won't go until you tell us about Wes. You're half right. About the not going part. No! Wait! Get the hell out of here. Kidnapping Linwood. You're really stepping up. The White Room. They just don't talk about it. I was here three years... ...before I heard of it. Did he tell you what's in it? - Answers. Up or down? - Up. He tell you how to get there? A guy in Litigation went to the White Room. He's in an asylum now. Wow. I should probably hold on to that. Hello. Angel. Lilah. Your fingernails are pretty. I love red. You have a taste for red too. And revenge. I know. So much more fun than forgiveness. So, what's up? - A demon, Sahjhan, has taken my son. - Do you want your little baby back? Baby's gone. You want Sahjhan. Nowadays you can walk right through them. But in the past, they were something else. They were all about torture and death. You can relate. Well, they caused a lot of trouble. Don't get me wrong. I like trouble, but I hate chaos. - So we changed them. - You made them immaterial. Smart boy. Now they watch, and they can no longer touch. - How do you capture them? - Well, there's your special urn. They're expensive and hard to come by. But you don't want his essence in a jar. You want someone you can sink your teeth into. You know these things always come with a price. Kill her. That's good for now. I see why they respect you. Now, as to your demon made flesh... ...it's a big ritual, all here. Can't wait to see how it turns out. - Okay, throw me away. - You want me to put you in the trash? Either Wesley took the diaries, or he tossed them. We're lucky we got here while it's still full. Yeah. God, somebody ate that? - Any luck? - Yes. - You getting anywhere? - He was meticulous. He kept separate diaries for all the major players: Darla, Connor, Angel. And he's frightened. What's he frightened of? I'm not sure yet. "Pending doom" sort of thing in the later entries. Some big prophecy he was trying to repudiate. It says here, "It can't be coming. It can't be true." That's doom-y. I guess we're looking for this prophecy. - I just don't know where we're gonna-- - I do. - "The father will kill the son." - Wes thought Angel-- Was going to kill Connor. Yes, and that's the prophecy! Wesley couldn't accept it, and he kept trying to disprove it... ...but the text and commentaries.... Everywhere he turned brought him back to the same place. This is great. I told you he had a reason for taking Connor. Yeah. Wes did the right thing. The only thing he could do under the circumstances. Now we have to find Angel and tell him right away. And he'll forgive Wesley for giving his son to his mortal enemy? Well... ...maybe begin to forgive. Angel, please do not do this thing. We'll find some other way. There is no other way. You know, not speaking would be a really good look for you. - How's that? - It looks about right. - What's next? - Next, we reconsider this. You're messing with primordial powers of darkness. Next. Is this how you want to get Connor? What's next? Human blood. "Corpus Granok Sahjhan Demonicus," Where is he? Where is he? What the--? Hey, come on! Now, this is more like it. Lilah, do something! Killing him isn't gonna solve anything. - You're wrong. - We had a deal! I gave you everything. What more do you want? - I want my son back! - Lilah! Whoa, flag on the play! The tech team registered a bioplasmic disturbance on National... - ...the same time as the spell. - Sahjhan? It flipped a 2-ton truck like a toy. - We need to talk. - Not now. - Fred. - There's something you need to know-- The father will kill the son! There's a prophecy in the Nyazian scrolls. Wes checked the translations. He went to oracles. He couldn't disprove it. They fed you Connor's blood. You said it yourself, he smelled like food. - Wesley tried to protect Connor. - He was trying to protect you. Same as we're doing right now. - Angel, the prophecy. - It's a lie. I'd never hurt Connor. - How can you know that? - I'd never hurt someone I care about. Now, move. - Let's go after him. - We can't. He lays a finger on you, I'll have to kill him. What are they doing here? There was kidnapping. Dark magic. It's bad, kids. - He's gonna pay for this. - Really bad. Don't run off now. The fun's just starting. I'm not your boyfriend. Find someone else to smack you around. - It has to matter. - He's not thinking about-- What the hell? In the back. Get in the back. - It's her. - In Wesley's car. Let's go. This way. - You all right? - I tried to stop. It's all my fault. - Hey, what's your name? - Al Stokely. It's not even my truck. Al, you wanna tell me what happened? I hit-- Oh, God. - I hit a guy, a man. - This man you hit, where is he? I don't know. There's no way he could have gotten up. Oh, God, those poor people. You didn't do anything wrong. It's all my fault. No. No, it isn't. I knew you were meant for this. Where's Wes? - He's not coming back. - What? It was all lies, every bit of it. All he wanted was the kid. To punish Angel. - He never cared about anything else. - I'm talking about Wesley. His car's here. Where is he? - We just want to hear his side. - His side? His side's funny. He sacrificed everything he believed in to save that kid. By helping Holtz take him to hell? I wanna hear it from the horse's mouth. - Your friend's innocent. - Is he alive? Where is he? Will you just tell us? Heaven, hell. I slit his throat. Stay down! No. I trusted the wrong man. Take us to him, and he better be alive! You call that a fight? Let me show you how we used to do it. So. My home... ...uninvited guests. - This can't end well. - This is the guy, right? Hi, Justine. I remember you. One of Holtz's groupies. You tried to cut off my head. Can't tell you how much I miss doing that. I also miss gravity, friction... ...and smashing things to pieces. - Let's start with your skulls. - Or yours. Angel. I'm guessing I have you to thank for the mortal-coil thing. Yeah. I'll tell you what. Take me to the Quor-toth world, help me find my son... - ...we'll call it even. - Really? You and me, buddy cops? Summer release? We iron out our wacky differences and bond? Don't think so. - You're taking me. - Couldn't if I wanted to. - You're lying. - No, that I'm telling the truth about. Your kid's gone for good. I can open the Quor-toth one time. That's why I chose it. Try again, the whole universe could go kablooey. - Bad for me, bad for America. - What are you lying about? Oh, well, I don't like to brag... ...but read any good prophecies lately? - You wrote the prophecies. - More a rewrite. - The father will kill the son. - Yeah. I flitted back and forth in time, changed the one that threatened me. Flitted in a manly way, just so we're clear. You're not my enemy. You're in my home, and I'm gonna kick your ass. But you were never really the point. - It was Connor. - Can't put one over on you, can you? Oh, wait. Already did. It's freaky to see your name in a prophecy... ...all carved in blood on an official scroll. The one sired by the vampire with a soul shall grow to manhood... ...and kill Sahjhan. Me! You planted prophecies, that Angel would kill his son... - ...and Wesley believed them. - Thank God he had some spine. Holtz was useless. He wanted to raise your kid as his own. I've got a knife over my heart for 1100 years and he's into petty revenge. If he'd killed it while it was in its mother, we could've avoided all this. Do I look like I need more skin problems? Fred! I had to put your boy down. Pity, kid had a big future. I mean, big. Oh, well. We all gotta go sometime. No. No! Don't do that! No! Holtz left it. What about Wesley? The park next to his place... ...that's where I left him. - Maybe she was lying. - No, he was here. How can you--? Right. The blood. We should get going. Sun's coming up. He can't be dead. We'll keep looking. Lorne's been calling hospitals all night. We need to get you indoors, man. We'll find him. Hey, I cleaned the pentagram as best I could. The dried blood, well, that's starting to be a look out there. - Thanks. - You know me. Like to keep busy. It's not right. All I wanted was to get my hands on Sahjhan. - Fred and Gunn tried to keep me from-- - Going too far? - Nearly got them killed. - Yeah, you did. I'm glad it didn't work out that way. You think Wesley is...? I don't know. I hope for the best. You know, there's a bigger picture here, Angel. In that bigger picture, there's a glass. If "glass is half full" is about to come out of your mouth, don't. No. No, this is more a glass half-full of spiked blood. If Sahjhan and the lawyer pulled off their plan... ...you'd have Connor's blood on your hands. - Don't I anyway? - No. Think you could have done more? You did everything you could... ...with the knowledge you had, just like Wesley. Maybe the way to start forgiving yourself is by starting to forgive him. Angel Invest-- Hey, Fred. Yeah. They did? And? And, okay, where? Yeah, he's right here. I'll tell him. Okay, thanks. They found Wesley? Hey. It's good you came, man. - He ask for me? - He can't speak yet. Trachea's messed up, lost a lot of blood. It's good you came. He's not completely out of the woods yet. You being here can only help. Can I see him? I'm sure he'd like that. Hey, Wes. I just.... I want you to know that I understand why you did it. I know about the prophecies... ...and I know how hard it must have been for you to... ...do what you did. You thought I was going to turn evil and kill my son. I didn't. It's important you know that. This isn't Angelus talking. It's me, Angel. You know that, right? Good. Son of a bitch! You're gonna pay! You took my son! You son of a bitch! Bastard! Code blue, 319, - Code blue, 319, - Go! You think I forgive you?! Never! You're gonna die! You're gonna pay! Hey! Hey! - You took my son! You took him! - Stop it! You took my son! - Angel, stop! - Never! I'll kill you! - Come on, stop! - You're a dead man, Pryce!
