two blocks around location, One Mary 20, do you have a name? - Where? - There, detective. It's the same guy. This makes three. He's just getting started. It's the city of dreams. A mystical oasis... ...willed from a desert. But even sunny, blond L.A. has its trashy, dark roots. And you've learned that the hard way. You've talked to the police, but they can't help, so you've come to us. I think it's about to speak. Nobody likes a smart-ass rogue demon hunter. What do you want, Wesley? Just thought we might compare battle plans from our respective fronts. I thought you worked alone. Even a solitary soldier such as myself recognizes... ...that an exchange of intelligence benefits the common struggle. - I brought in your mail and newspaper. - Oh, thanks. - So, what have you got? - Got? You wanted to compare skinnies on evil. Yes, skinnies. Precisely. Right. Well... ...everything seems quiet. Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by. And you? How's your end of the fight? I'm selling to an empty chair. What do you think? Quiet all around then. Well, I'll keep myself available. The situation can only escalate. We made a most effective team. Vanquishing that empathy demon in short order. Nobody gouged out my eyes, so I'm happy. Yes, most effective. Your cryptic visions. Angel's brawn. My highly developed powers of deduction-- - This isn't our mail. - Sorry? See here? The dentist office next door. Oh, I see. I didn't... ...realize. Something wrong? You stopped yammering. I suppose I should return these items to their proper owner. - Who were you talking to? - Nobody. And Wesley. Remember that license plate we got on that runaway case? You were gonna follow up. No go. The DMV's stalker-phobic and-- Wow, you look half dead. Which, for someone who's completely dead, would be kind of neat? License plate, Cordelia? I thought you could have Police Woman run it for us on the QT. - Kate. - Are you sure you're okay? For a guy who's 200-plus, you're not usually with the bags. - I'll do this now. - Hey! Look, I'm fine, Cordelia, all right? All right. I'll take the tunnels. I'm not supposed to release that information to a civilian. I know. - If it were anyone else. - I appreciate it, Kate. I know you do. So I don't mind. - I'll run it myself by morning. - No rush. Late afternoon. Evening will be fine. I won't mind getting my head out of this case. - Even for a minute. - Tough one? The first victim, Reggie Sparks, volunteered as a crossing guard. Jinny Markem, just started 10th grade. And Jessica Halpren, 25, worked as a waitress. Do you know what they have in common? What he did to them. That's all. That's not all. They have you. - The crime scene photos you wanted. - Thanks. Stop by tomorrow. By then, I'll have invaded a citizen's privacy for you-- It's pretty grim. I've spent the last 48 hours creating a profile. Being inside this guy's head hasn't been a whole lot of fun. Tabloids call him "The Pope." Probably thinks he's doing God's work. No. Just the opposite. This is about mocking God. That's my guess. - Detective, they're ready for you now. - Yeah, okay. Looks like it's show-- --time. Our suspect will be a white male. To the observer he won't seem a monster. His victims put up little struggle, so he's likely charming, attractive. At his core, he's a loner. Possibly a dual personality who, once the crime's done... ...retains no memory of the act, He doesn't see his victims as subhuman but himself as more than human. A superior species. Stalking his prey, getting to know them. He's likely unmarried... ...though he may have recently ended a long-term relationship badly. We look for a precipitating event in these cases. A painful breakup is always at the top of our list. Before failing, the relationship... ...may have marked an inactive period in his life, He would've regarded it as a lifeline, his salvation, But once ended, resulted in his recidivism, What's not in question is his experience, He's been doing this for a very long time and he will do it again, Jeez, Wesley. Hover much? - Where is he? Where's Angel? - Not here. - What's that? - What it looks like. It's rude coming into a vampire's office with one of those. - Could be misinterpreted. - You recall this morning... ...that mix-up with the dentist's mail and newspaper? That's when I saw this. Oh, my God. You cut up Dr. Folger's newspaper? - You'll get us kicked out of here. - What? No, the clipping. "Third Body Found in Alley." Not exactly front-page news. That is the front page. Still, note the modus operandi. - Mutilation with the religious icon? - I'm against it? I think you'd better sit down. During my duties as Watcher in Sunnydale, I did extensive research. Specifically on Angel, given his uncomfortable proximity to the Slayer. He looked comfortable to me. When I saw this story, it rang chillingly familiar. So I reacquainted myself with facts. Confirming, I' m sorry to say, my grim suspicions. In the 1700s, it was Angelus' custom to sign his victims... ...by carving a Christian cross into their left cheek... ...to let people know he'd been there. Okay. You get to leave now. You're not gonna accuse Angel like this. - Cordelia-- - No! I don't care how many files you have on the things... ...he did back in the powdered-wig days. He is good now. He's my friend. And nothing you can say will make me turn on a friend. - Cordelia. He's right. - You stake him, I'll cut his head off. Come no closer. I won't hurt you. That what you told Miss Third Body Found in Alley? Why should we believe you? Because I could take you if I wanted to. We're listening. I don't remember doing these things. Not exactly the confidence-inspiring denial I was looking for. - I've been having dreams. - Dreams? Killing dreams. Always the same. I stalk them, toy with them, mark them while they're alive. Before they can die from fear, I feed on them. So you've had nightmares. It doesn't mean you-- They're not nightmares. I've enjoyed them. Oh. You fear it may be more than dreams. An acting-out in a hypnogogic state. - Hypno-what-gic? - Sleepwalking. Vampires can't sleepwalk. He steps out the door, and he'd be in flames. Unless it were happening in the pre-dawn hours. Which is when all these murders took place. There's only one way to be sure. - You've got to make it tight. - Like I need instructions from you. My glamorous life. I make coffee and chain the boss to the bed. - Gotta join a union. - It's tight enough. If it turns out we're back on a liquid lunch? Better safe than cocktails. All we can do now is wait. Yeah. Maybe you're committing horrible crimes in your dreams. But I don't want to stay for your nocturnal commissions. - I understand. - Okay. Well, pleasant-- I mean, sleep tight. That's pretty much a given. There now. Isn't that better? Wakey-wakey. - We made it. - Great news, sports fans. There's been another killing. Maybe not-so-great news for the dead person... ...but at least now we know Mr. I'm So Tortured didn't do it. Yes, I did. There now. Isn't that better? Better. First kill. Aptly done. - Strange. She was my sister. - Yet you feel nothing. No. - I feel hungry. - You do learn quickly. And my father would disagree. It's time you shared with him what a fine student you've become. My father. Yes. - They'll be eating dinner. - A feast! Excellent. When you're invited, savor it, Penn. You won't recapture it. Family blood is always the sweetest. - I taught him well. - A real Psycho Wan Kenobi. Two hundred years' practice. I imagine he's got it down by now. Gallagher's changed his act more times than he has in the last two centuries. - Why is he doing the same old shtick? - It's a classic, isn't it? Every time he smashes that watermelon with the sledgehammer-- I don't know why. You suppose he's trying to draw you out? That he knows you're here? That might explain the dreams. I have a connection with those I sire. It means he's close. Neat. We can't find him and the cops stand zero chance of stopping him. - Kate. - What are you doing? - She's no idea what she's up against. - You're not going to tell her. You can't walk into a precinct with knowledge of these murders... ...and claim a 200-year-old Puritan's responsible. You'd be locked up faster than Lady Hamilton's virtue. - My apologies. - I don't know what that meant. She's good. She has resources we don't. - Eventually, she'll find him. - Bad for her. Or good for us. Hey. I have the info on your license plate. Are you okay? Not that the "brooding man of mystery" thing doesn't work. It does. A lot. - Can we talk somewhere in private? - Sure. Of course. What is it? - How's the investigation? - It's nowhere. Some inconsiderate serial killers often fail to leave us any clues. - He's reliving it. - What's going on? - It's complicated. - So make it simple. - Kate, do you trust me? - You know I do. Trust me when I tell you this is the man you're looking for. - Where did you get that? - Do you trust me? I don't get it. Are you protecting a source? Yes. I trust you. His next victim will be a teen white male from a low-rent neighborhood. Probably near a bar or a liquor store. He'll kill him... ...unless you use every resource to make sure he's not successful. - You told her everything? - Just enough to get her killed. We'll make sure that won't happen. Once you hook this up, she finds something, we'll know. - Where'd you get the radio? - Police car. Oh, dear. Let's add patrols here and here. Anything matching the profile gets reported. Okay. Mitchell, you'll ride with me. Could you buy me some beer? - Take a hike. - I left my I.D. at home-- Wipe. Ma'am, can you possibly pick me up some beer? It's for my mother. Are you old enough to buy beer? You sure about this? There's no discount liquor store here. - You remind me of a brother I had. - Whatever. We're going nowhere here. You! Right there! All units, backup requested at 3336 Channel Avenue, Use caution, homicide suspect believed to be at location, Search teams are on their way. He went in through there. Exits are sealed. We'll find him. - Watch your backs. - We got him. I'm going in. Meet you back here. Don't move! Do not move. I will fire! Ouch. Angelus? Angelus. - My God. It's been a lifetime. - At least. - We were to meet in Italy. - I remember. Hell, I waited till the 19th century. What happened? - Got held up in Romania. - Romania? - What's in Romania? - Gypsies. - Request assistance. - Join me for a drink. - That's not why I'm here. - Request assistance. Suspect sighted. Yes. Why are you here? - To kill you. - Detective Lockley, Go, Kate! Get out of here! Go! You know its name? Angelus, what's happened to you? - People change. - We're not people. Where are you? I shot him three times. I know I did. Then he got up. If I pull this trigger, will you get up too? - What are you? - You know the answer. A detail's been left out of the press reports. Something you've held back. Isn't that right? - What do you know? - The puncture wounds. The victims were all drained of their blood, right? Should I trust you more or less now? - You're not gonna stop him. - What do you mean? It'll take sunlight, decapitation, or a stake through the heart. - Children's stories. - It's the truth. No. I don't believe you. Even after what you saw, you won't let yourself. So you'll lose. - I've heard enough. - You haven't heard a word. And you won't. Not now, not yet. Because there are some things you're not ready to face. Here's everything with the M.O., dating back as far as I could find. Thanks, Chris. So you think this guy's a copycat, a history buff? Something like that. So you've discovered the seamy underbelly of a candy-coated America. Well, you've come to the right place. Here at Angel Investigations... ...we won't judge, but we will charge. Tell me how you heard of us. - From the police. - Really? Yes. The detective I spoke with was very enthusiastic. For the truly human touch, she said that I should come to you. Oh, good. Is it cold out? I'm trying to remember her name. What was it? She's about yea tall, attractive, natural blond. - Oh, yeah, Kate. Detective Lockley. - Lockley. Yes, that's it. She and Angel are tight. Really? So this is more... ...than just a professional relationship? He cares for her. Yeah. More than he knows. But that's our Angel... ...dour, but not afraid to get personally involved in his work... ...and you're pumping me for information, aren't you? Oh, crap. You're him. He. The guy. Apt pupil boy. You realize you'll never make it to the exit before I-- Go up like a match? Well.... He's back from his Up with People meeting. - Get me a stake. - It's 8 in the morning. Oh, you mean like-- Okay. What? You don't drink, so now no one gets to? I don't expect you to understand. I understand. I was a Puritan, remember? - It's gotta end. - Why? Because you say so? Yeah, how does that work, exactly? You wake up one morning and decide, "Okay, now I'm good!" No, Angelus. It doesn't end. It never ever ends. It just goes on and on. That's not the only thing that goes on and on. Here. Dust him. I'm sorry what I turned you into. A first-class killer? An artist? A bold reinterpreter of the form? Try "cheesy hack." You've been getting back at your father for over 200 years. It's pathetic. You've probably got a killer's shrine on your wall. News clippings, magazine articles, maybe a few candles. Oh, you are so prosaic. Nothing about a new vampire in town-- Maybe because he's here and has me by the throat. - Let him go. - You're right. My work was getting stale. I appreciate the critique. So look for something new, innovative. Something shockingly original. Think of the worst possible thing you can imagine, and I'll see you there. Hi. Can I come in? Oh, that's right, you have to be invited in. - You've been doing your homework. - Quiz me. I'm full of fun facts. Your friend was in L.A. before. Did you know that? Yeah. At least twice. Once in 1929 and again in 1963. Oh, and there was something in Boston in 19O8. I think he was there too. - So you believe me. - Yes, I believe you. - He's planning-- - Angelus. Isn't that what he called you? I looked it up. It's all right there. The demon with the face of an angel. A particularly brutal bastard by all accounts. - And, no, you can't come in. - I can't make up for the past. No, you can't. In fact, what's happening now... ...is really because of you. You made him, didn't you? Let me help end it, please. "Please." There's a word I imagine you heard a lot of in your time. Please. No. Don't. Thanks, but I don't need your help. I know what to do. Drive a stake right through his heart. When that happens, I suggest you don't be there... ...because I'll do the same to you. Here it is. Los Angeles Globe, 1929. "The suspect seemed like a quiet, normal type. The search is ongoing." - What are we looking for exactly? - I don't know yet. "In 1963, police tracked the killer... ...to a residential hotel called the Cloverwood Apartments. By the time they made their move, he'd already fled." They never caught him. It's the same place. New name and a face-lift. - That's happened before in this town. - Good old predictable Penn. - I invite you in. - That's only for humans. Breaking and entering a vampire's lair isn't a problem. Right. He's not here. So then we wait? Raid the icebox and try to think... ...of the worst possible thing we can imagine? Stop imagining. Good Lord. All those schoolchildren. He's finally changing his act. All right, listen up. You've all received one of these. This is the man we're looking for. And this man is how we're going to find him. His name is Angel. He's a private detective. Our suspect may make an attempt... ...to contact Angel, possibly as his next target. So we'll stake out Angel's place. How many men do you want? - Lots. We'll work in rotating teams-- - This is a terrible likeness. The mouth. It's all wrong. No! Attention, all units.... We're in. What about the schoolchildren? Shouldn't we be--? Stop! Stop! Hold it right there. He's here. Twelfth Street Station House, Secure area, use caution, - What are you gonna do? - I thought I'd stop everything... ...and tell you my plan. But better yet... ...why don't I just show you? Smell that fear. It makes the blood sweeter. - You know who taught me that? - I'm not afraid to die. Oh, I'm not going to kill you. But when I'm finished, Angel will. A bus full of schoolchildren, Penn? You really thought I was gonna fall for that? - Well, you could have. - No. Too original. You were right about one thing, Angelus. The last 200 years has been about me sticking it to my father. But I've come to realize something. It's you. You made me! You taught me! You approved of me in ways my mortal father never did! - You're my real father, Angelus. - Fine! You're grounded. You forget your own lessons, teacher. Never give up the advantage, remember? Living among them has made you weak! It sickens me to think that there was a time... ...you would've done whatever was necessary. - You missed. - No, I didn't. This vein on my temple is doing the cha-cha... ...because I just had one of those... ...bone-crunching, mind-splitting vision headaches. New job. This place is like where I grew up. Right. Yeah, I could see that... ...except for the cars, the buildings and the, you know, everything else. It's not so different. People moving through their lives. I wonder if anything changes. Sure it does. They do. You have. They were just dreams. They weren't even yours. It didn't mean anything. But I enjoyed it. It'd probably be okay if you never mentioned that part ever again. It's still in me. Sure it's in you. We all have something. But it's not the only thing that's in you. You're not him, Angel. Not anymore. The name I got in my vision-- The message didn't come for Angelus. It came for you, Angel. And you have to trust that whoever The Powers That Be, be-- Are. Is. Anyway, they know the difference. - Yeah. - People really do change. Yes, they do. And sometimes they change back. - If the day ever comes that I--
