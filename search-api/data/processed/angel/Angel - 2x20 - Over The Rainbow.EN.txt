- The two of you are...? - Cousins. Show the cleavage, say the line. Don't waste more of our time, princess. I just wanted to act. - You should've waited for me, - We waited for months, We're looking for someone working here. Fred disappeared 5 years ago. They never found her. Here it is. Fred was holding this book in my vision, The portal works both ways, Cordy? Cordy? Cordelia? Oh, no. Oh, my God, no. How could I have let this happen? No, she's here somewhere. She's just hiding. - What? - She's gone. Sucked into the portal. She's in the Host's dimension. Where's Cordelia? Angel? Wesley! Mr. Green Mojo Guy's cousin? Help! Right. Good one, Cor. Scream very loudly so the hell-beasts come to you. Worth a shot. So... ...silver lining. It's kind of a pretty place, when you look at it. Woodsy woods. Sunny and mild. Giant hairy hell-beast staring at me. That's incredibly frightening. Good hell-beast. You're a lazy hell-beast, aren't you? Yes! You'll stay right there while I run for my life. I don't know where she is. My world, sure, but who knows if she even.... Because there's the-- With the-- - I wish I could get drunk. - Let's be logical. Screw logic. We're getting Cordy back. We'll open up another portal. We'll go in after her. - Not a good idea. - I don't care. We're unprepared. Let's go to the hotel, do research-- No! I want to jump through the big swirly hole thingy and save Cordelia. We might never be able to get back. It's Cordy. Oh, crap. Maybe I have to stand where the portal opened. What, out of batteries? Is it out of batteries? I don't know. I don't know how it works. Damn it! I just got her back. There won't be any big swirly hole-jumping without a big swirly hole. Yeah, right. Back to the hotel, figure out how to make one. Maybe it's best that you can't get in. - What? - I'm just saying, my world? You don't want to jump into my world looking like that. - Like what? - Like a human. I can't die like this! Oh, thank God! And also, eew! Come here, boy! Seekul! Come here. Come on. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Good boy, Seekul. Really cute... ...thing you've got there. Personally, I've always been a real thing-lover. Good boy, good boy. You found me a cow. Who you calling "cow," mister? Um.... Uh-oh. A fine old cow. Good cow. Should fetch a pretty price at the market. Okay, but you're like Hindu, right? You don't eat the cows? Kind of a chatty cow, huh, Seekul? That'll drive down the price. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Start talking, About my dimension? Sure. I was there, I came here. I like here, I don't want to go there. Is that all? I need-- Sit. How'd you get from your world to here? Through a portal. - How did you open that portal? - I didn't. You're not helping. It's no secret that I hate Pylea. - Pylea? - My home dimension. Back then, I would've done anything to get out. So one day, five years ago, I'm in the woods... ...when suddenly, out of nowhere, a portal appears. Like an answer to my prayers. - You knew it was a portal? - At first, I didn't. But when I got closer... ...it goes all bendy, flashy light, whoosh through the portal... ...bang, I'm in another dimension. This dimension, which I love and adore... ...and will never, never, never leave. But then, who opened the portal? Gift horse. Mouth. So where did you end up in this dimension? In an abandoned building, unlike any I'd ever seen. That's when I realized I'd been delivered from hell. I created Caritas on that spot. So Pylea's a hell dimension? Cordy's stuck in hell? Not literally. - It runs a close second. - Hard to believe. Do you? Well, try this. They have no music there. It doesn't exist. Do you know what that's like? No lullabies, no love songs. I thought I was crazy, that I had ghosts in my head... ...simply because I could hear music. I didn't know it was music. I just knew it was something... ...beautiful... ...and painful and right. And I was the only one who could hear it. Then I wound up here and heard Aretha for the first time. Don't kid yourselves. Cordy's in a very bad place. - It's cold. - What? Put on a sweater. No, no, no. The hot spot is cold. Certain geographical areas are rife with psychic energy. These areas tend to function as dimensional hot spots. Natural gateways between worlds. Caritas is one such spot. - The catch is-- - Gotta have one of those. Creating a portal tends to deplete the hot spot of its psychic energy. And since we opened one.... The hot spot is cold. Can't open the portal. I was right. It was the batteries. The same probably applies to the one in the library. Why not then wait till the portal recharges? No time. We have to find another hot spot, and fast. - That's not our only problem. - Of course not. When separate entities enter a portal, they tend to... ...well, separate. Assuming we find a hot spot and open a portal... ...if we simply jump in, we could wind up on opposite ends of the world. - So Landok and Cordy... - ...didn't arrive together. She really is alone. Hey. Where have you been? We spoke hours ago. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It's fine. You bring him up to date. Two problems. Finding a dimensional hot spot and figuring out how-- I'm not going. - What? - Last night, I lost one of my crew. I should've been there. Sorry, but Wes said the trip was one-way and I can't. I know that makes me-- I don't know what it makes me. But I owed it to you to tell you face to face. I wish you luck. Please, find her. Tough decision. Poor kid. But I'm right there with him. Yeah. Me, too, I guess. No, about the "not going" part. You know I'm not going, right? What? It's your world. We need a guide. When I said I love this dimension and I'll never, never, never leave... ...which "never" did you not understand? - First Gunn, now-- I can't believe it! - I'm sorry. But I'll tell you what. I've got an idea about finding your hot spot. Back in a jiff. Gunn does have... ...responsibilities. Ties. - People to take care of. - So do I. And right now... ...you and I have to figure out how to save her. She's a good cow. Strong. Maybe a little talkative, but you can whip it out of her. Skinny. Ugly too. One pig. Two pigs. For this old cow? She'll probably croak soon. A pig and a pint, then. Flib liquor. Fine. Put the collar on. Since the last cow died, we're mucking out the flehegna stables ourselves. You should see my rash. I got it, I got it. Okay. Okay, look. First of all, I am a human being, not a cow. You can't just barter a human being. Second of all, one pig? One measly pig? Third of all, there's been a huge misunderstanding. I am an American and I have rights. Right now I'd like to get back to-- That hurt! Cows don't talk. They do their job, if they know what's good for them. Come by tomorrow and pick up your stuff. Come on, cow. If you think I'll follow you-- You've got another thing-- Ow. Coming. You don't know where you're going, You're lost. Miles from anything that grounds you. I get a deep sense of longing, separation. - Is this a bad time? - It's like you feel cut off. - Lorne! - Aggie! How's it going? You know the business. Vague predictions, lengthy pauses. Anything to keep the numbers rolling. - Hiding from the mob? - Don't get me started. It's Hollywood chic, going incognito, but this hat's chafing my horns. - So what brings you here? - Like you don't already know. I just want to see what kind of spin you'll put on it. Dimensional portals, psychic hot spots. I need one. - Why? - Some friends are going on a trip. And the big flashing neon warning light in your aura means what? Eat at Joe's. - Can you help me find a hot spot? - No. Gotta admit I didn't see that coming. There's ugly conflict vibes coming off you, pointing at that portal. You sure it's not the chili I had for lunch yesterday? Talk about conflict! They need it to go to Pylea, my home dimension. You're not going? Aggie, I'd rather have a hydrochloric acid facial. Or a hive of wasps nesting in my throat. Or watch a junior high production of Cats, See where I'm going? - Not Pylea. - Exactamundo. Well, that's too bad. Now they'll never rescue the girl. Come again? I can find your hot spot, but on one condition. You've gotta go. It's the only way you'll ever resolve... ...all these issues clouding up your aura. And be honest. Deep down, you've known you have to take that one last trip home. It's the "last" that scares me. Sometimes the journey's taken simply because it must be taken. Is that vague enough? Is that what I sound like? No wonder people complain. I could try a binding spell to fuse us together as we enter the portal. Good. Let's do that. We may emerge on the other side as a freakishly hybridized Siamese twin. Keep looking. This is the third reference I've seen to iron or metal. Could be how to keep us from scattering. We get handcuffed together? Who has handcuffs? Well, I... ...wouldn't know. But I don't think it'd work. What will work? It's been 12 hours since she went through that portal. - What do you want? - Angel. Good afternoon. Lawyers. Don't you people sleep during the day? Gavin Park and Mr. Hayes. We represent Wolfram-- Already bored. - We've come to appraise the hotel. - What? Your lease expires soon, and Wolfram and Hart may buy this building. You gotta be kidding. You couldn't turn me, so now you want to evict me. They're trying to annoy me to death. We'd like to walk around, if you don't mind. You think I mind? Very well. We'll contact your real estate company about your noncompliance. They'll send you a notice of obligation. After that, if you still refuse to cooperate... ...I'm sure that, in your lease, there must be one or two loopholes. How quick can we get out of this world? I want to go home. I want to be in my bed. I want to order some Thai food. I want to read the latest issue of Marie Claire, I want to be doing anything but shoveling demon horse poo! Woman has ears like a bat. There's gotta be a way to get this off. Don't do that. Who's there? What do you want? I forget. It's not important. If you take your collar off, bad things will happen to your head. It'll implode. So, don't take the collar off. I can't talk to you if you don't have a head. Okay. Are you a human? Keep shoveling. Go shovel. Where'd you come from? Los Angeles. How long have you been here? I was born here. I mean, not really, I just-- Sometimes I think I was. I mean, I don't think it was my thoughts. I forget certain words. How'd you get here? Tell me where "here" is first. Pylea. Well, keep shoveling! Geez! Another dimension. You're lost, I can tell. So many of us are lost even there, but it's true. I'm not crazy. Well, crazy, but I'm not wrong. So how do I get out of here? Oh, I forgot laughing. You don't. They use you as a slave, and then your body gives. Zip. Gone. Well, that's not happening to me, okay? I have friends who are gonna rescue me any time now. I tried to get back. I didn't have the math, which is strange, because-- - How'd you get here? - I'm pretty sure I.... I was sucked in by a portal. - A portal? - Yeah. Where was it? - Fugitive! - Oh, no! Get her! Get her! What's going on? What's going on? On your face, cow. On the floor. No! No! Let go of me! A disabled collar. Clever little cow. You should've stayed in the woods. Let go of me! - Wait-- - Face down! As soon as Wes solves our scattering problem, we leave. Don't know if we'll be coming back. It's 11:16. Cordy's been gone for almost 24 hours now. I think I've covered everything. Oh, the mortgage for the hotel is under the company name. The lease is up in six months. That's what they tell me. So, I guess that's it. Take care of yourself. How you holding up? Waiting for Wes to have that eureka moment. - Eureka! - Oh, geez, thank God. He actually really says "eureka"? I know how to get us through the portal! Let's go. Six packets of hefroot, four queeks, a bottle of flib liquor and a spatula. Vakma, is it? Earlier, that girl in the barn-- Shut up, cow. Trensiduf of the Gathwok Clan was right. You talk too much. You're spilling my viper's milk. I'm sorry. If I wasn't carrying every.... Oh, no. Stand up straight. That milk's worth more than you. Bad cow! Bad! A Drokken, it's attacking a villager. Near the forest, by a big yellow rock. - No one's gonna ask if I'm okay? - Cursed! My cow is cursed! No, wait. It's not a curse! You have to go save this villager, or the Drokken will-- Cursed! Cursed! Cursed! Cursed! Cursed! Here. Stop here. Here? Isn't this a movie studio? Makes a certain kind of sense, no? This is where Aggie said it was. And she's never wrong about hot spots. She was doing SkyBar way before Brad and Jennifer. You got the book? Good. Hold that puppy tight, okay? I don't want to be stuck over there, waiting for a mystical locksmith. All right, then. I suppose we should probably begin. Should I, I don't know, put the top up? Shouldn't be necessary. If I'm right, we only require a metal enclosure... ...to insure that we travel together. The car, top up or down, should do it. I'm almost positive. Almost? Ninety-six percent. It's not like I've ever done this before. - I'm under a great deal of pressure-- - Oh, suck it up, English. Gunn. How did you--? Got a phone message. Sounded like the captain of the Titanic going down with the ship. I just thought that someone on this side should... ...know the details, in case. A back-up man. Terrific idea. Now that he's going, someone should stay, mind the store. - Don't worry. Get me something nice-- - Shut up. - Everyone set? - Let's get a move on. Right. Here goes. Cool. - Ninety-six percent, huh? - Give or take. Gentlemen, take a good look. Now, say goodbye. The sun! The daylight! Quick, hand me a blanket, or I'll catch on fire! - Why am I not on fire? - Yo, that was phat. It is another dimension. Perhaps there's some.... Back up, Copernicus. That's suns. Plural. Suns, yes. Perhaps they don't have the same effect on vampires. Watch it, all right? Hey! Fascinating! Y'all see that bendy thing? - So we made it. This is your world? - Ah, yes. Home sweet hell. I'm not on fire. We're together! And we didn't merge into a freakish four-man Siamese twin. That was a risk? How come nobody told me? Everybody notice how much fire I'm not on? A beautiful day in the neighborhood. May I suggest we hide the car? It's a bit conspicuous, seeing we don't have convertibles here. Or, you know, cars. Maybe this is where Cordy came through. Could be. Let's gather branches and brush to cover up the car. Look, there's some over in that patch of sun. I'll get them! I'll give it to you. Tripping to an alternate universe? Pretty damn cool. - But I want to find Cordy quick. - Me too. I mean, for her sake, of course. If I know Pylea, she could probably use a friend about now. I'd just like to say that I don't know anything about a curse, okay? I just have these visions that-- I don't get them very often. We found the body by Dester's Rock. A Drokken beast ate him. Oh, God, it's you. I'm really sorry about that, honest. But I didn't make it happen, I just saw it. - Before it had come to pass. - Exactly. - It is the curse. - No, no curse! Just visions. They're not dangerous. I use them to help people. Enough. We must discover beyond doubt if she's cursed with the sight. We will commence the test. Test? But I haven't studied. - Not much with the humor, huh? - Bring the instruments. Now we shall see if you are truly cursed. - I pray you are not. - Please. I'll keep them to myself. I'll never mention them again. Please, no, no! No! That should do it. You ready? Yeah. We're a few miles from town. We'll have to walk. No problem walking in the sun. Yes, we're all heartily aware that you're not on fire. Shall we go? Don't forget the book. What's wrong? That's not funny. - I wasn't trying to-- What? - I don't have the book. - What? - You had the book. - I don't have the book. - Who had the book? - Wesley. - Angel. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. Whoa, whoa! Did we look in the car? I checked it to make sure we didn't leave anything. Oh. Like, say, the book! The book was in the car. That much we know. But perhaps its only function is to open portals to Pylea... ...in which case it'd be useless in Pylea, and therefore... ...it only exists in our dimension. Ordinarily, I handle bad news really well. I drown my sorrows in a cold gin and tonic, squeeze of lime. Except for they don't have them here! We'll figure out a way to get back. Right now, we got to find Cordelia. That's why we're here, right? She needs us. Let's go. You grabbed the book from me. You grabbed it. The tests are complete. It is the decision of the Covenant that the girl... ...is afflicted. She carries the curse of the sight. Remember, keep your heads down. Xenophobia. Kind of a watchword here. Why are they afraid of Xena? She's kind of fly. - "Xenophobia." Fear of foreigners. - Can we pretend I didn't say that? Over there is Blix's house, a boyhood chum of mine. We were buds. Always watching out for each other. Close as a Torto demon and its parasite. I'll make the approach. You stay here. Why? We might get beaten to death with sticks. Be right back. What? Traitor! Deserter! Betrayer! - We should run. Now! - Look, traitor! Traitor! Stop them! Traitor! - Seize them! - After the traitor! What now? Where do we go? Probably the nearest dungeon. We're surrounded. We've been through a lot together. We've faced some steep odds. I got the 20 on the left, you take the 50 on the right. I think we're winning! - Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan. - Constable Narwek. Lovely to see you again. How are you? Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan you have returned. Why? I've been asking myself the same question. Who are these cow scum? You are all dressed very strangely. They're humans. And they're my friends. Cows are not friends. They are creatures of labor, beasts of burden, no more. I don't know where you've been... ...but clearly you have abandoned the teachings of your people. Take him. We'll begin interrogations immediately. - You can't do this. - Watch it. Easy. You dare use your tongue in my presence? Unworthy trash. For the crime of assault against your betters... ...you are to be detained until our Highness passes sentence. I'm guessing community service is out. It's too bad. I really like those orange vests. Gunn, stop. Put these things away. The time has arrived, my brethren. She is cursed with sight. Measures must be taken. Blood must be spilled. It's no use. Thing's made out of a magical alloy. Really? How can you tell? I can't. I'm making myself feel better. You found anything yet? Sealed up tight. Six, seven inches thick. You? No. No, these impenetrable stone walls-- You say impenetrable, and I will kick your ass. I was always horrified by the Tower of London. It wasn't that bad. Yes? Well.... Compared to this place, I'm sure it takes on a nostalgic glow. I wonder if the host's okay. I'm sure "interrogation" just means some wrist-slapping. - That, or he's dead. - Shut up. - It may not be wrist-slapping. - No. Shut up. How we supposed to hear any-- I hear two men talking in the hall. - Vampire. - Talking about a girl with visions. A Covenant. A curse. Something about testing the girl for sight. He said she screamed. Those bastards! They're taking us to a castle. We're gonna be sentenced. They're coming. Out, prisoners. Be ready. Oh, am I glad to see you. You're so much less dead than I expected. - What did they do to you? - First there was the parade. Ticker tape, streamers. Honestly, I was so touched I almost wept. Locked me up, pushed me around, asked a bunch of questions. - We have a lead on Cordy. - You found her? No. We heard two guys talk about a girl with visions. - Yikes. I don't like that. - They mentioned a Covenant. - Something about tests. - We need to get out of here. Silence! Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan, you and the cows are not to speak. - De-bunch your panties, Narwek. - You are a traitor. You abandoned your life-giver, betrayed us... ...and now you consort with these animals. I will take great pleasure in watching them kill you slowly. Do we go in separately or together? We don't have time. I've never been sentenced to death before. Together? - Listen up. - After that... ...we'll hang their corpses in the village square. Prisoners! The day of judgement has arrived. The venerable monarch of Pylea... ...general of the ravenous legions, eater of enemy flesh... ...prelate of the blood rites and sovereign of death... ...is prepared to pass sentence upon you. One... Open the doors.
