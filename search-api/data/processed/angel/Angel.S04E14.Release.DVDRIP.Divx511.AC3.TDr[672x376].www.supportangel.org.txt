even blotting out the sun... ... those were the first steps to something bigger. We need Angelus. CORDELIA: Angelus. There's something bigger, something worse. The Beast has a boss. FRED: Angelus has escaped. - He's gonna kill us. - I know. Why do you think I let him out? We're gonna save Angel. I know who we need to help us do it. This is Faith, the vampire slayer. If Angelus needs putting down, I'll be the one to do it, not you. What is this, Angelus? She's here to seriously mess up your boss's plans. You are weak. You're nothing. You could not even defeat me. Ain't that the truth? [ROARS] You mean killing the Beast really does bring back the sun? [GRUNTS] Swing and a miss, slugger. Sorry about... I guess we'll have to take a rain check on that whole "eviscerating you" thing. - I don't know how... - What? CORDELIA: We're having a baby. WESLEY: Sit here. Hold this. I'll get bandages. No drama. I'm good. You were nearly killed. Could use a shower. Of course. Faith, are you sure you're okay? Little sticky. [SCREAMING] [GASPING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Compliments of the lady. Yeah, as if. I couldn't believe how easy it was luring the slayer... ...to my welcome-home- from-prison party. Wish I could've been there when she saw the Beast. Guy wasn't gonna win any personality contest, but he put on a good show. He slapped her around real nice. Like a little bunny? A bloody, whimpering bunny. When she was tenderized, I gave Rocko the shaft. Never saw it coming. Dumb-ass. Yeah, soul boy, nice job bringing the sun back. Oh, hey, Angelus. Buy you a warm one? Maybe after. After what? After I rip out your windpipe so it stops making that annoying talky sound. Wait! I have a condition. Go, boy! Dirty bitch! Tourette's. You've heard of it, right? Yeah. Causes uncontrollable impulses, like yanking out throats. [CHOKING] MAN: Hello, Angelus. It's time we had that talk. Release - Where are you? - Wherever you want me to be. I'm where it's warm and soft. [GAGGING] Hide and seek, huh? Okay, I'll play. Playtime's over. You've been a bad boy. Killed my favorite pet. Yeah, well, thought that might get your attention. Initiative. I like that, but you needn 't have bothered. I've had my eyes on you for some time. Hey, baby, how about a hit? - You like to watch, huh? - <i>One of the things we have in common.</i> I don't know about that. I'm more of a hands-on kind of a guy. You, scram! Hey, man. Okay, come on. You got a pair... ...or the wind you're blowing up my tailpipe is all you can muster? Hey, here's a kooky idea. Now that I've killed your little pet rock, how about a face-to-face? - Assuming that you've got one. - <i>Don 't...</i> - worry. We'll meet when you're... - ready. Oh, come on. Why the stall, huh? You whipped up a rain of fire, blotted out the sun, earthquakes... ...all to maneuver the Brady Bunch into releasing Angel's inner me, huh? - Don't you want to kick the tires? - <i>So beautifully...</i> - vain. But the whirlwind doesn't always revolve around you. Destruction sometimes is its own... - reward. Hey, you're preaching to the guy who ate the choir. But wait. It was you, wasn't it, huh? You pulled just the wrong strings to make them think it was their idea. Got them to yank that white, fluffy soul, and stuff it in a jar... ...and then gone, baby, gone. - <i>Couldn 't risk them...</i> - putting it back in you. I have wonderful plans for you, my... - sweet boy. Yeah. The thing is, as far as plans go, I make my own. So, you know, thanks for stopping by my head. You would dare to defy me? Defy who? A big, scary voice? Hey, I got one of those too. You want to hear it? You can kiss my vampire ass! That do anything for you? [KNOCKING] CONNOR: Hey, brought you another blanket. You've gotta keep warm. [SIGHS] - You okay? - Just a little woozy. Could be the whole "Angelus nailing me with the crossbow" thingy. Or it could be the baby. His way of saying... Hello? Hey, I got places to go, friends to kill. Well, not actually my friends, but you get the idea. You got any more bluster you want to blow up there? That's what I thought. Dude, whatever you're on, I'll give you the girl for a gram. You're sure Faith's all right? Yeah. When Wesley called, he said that she was hurt bad, but she's a slayer. - They're really strong, right? - For a human. God, I can't believe Angelus killed the Beast. He fought dirty. Maybe this means we did the right thing, bringing Angelus back. Right. He's a real hero. Connor... ...Angelus cannot fight his true nature. It's who he is. But by killing the Beast, he's made the world a little safer... ...for our family. You didn't have that the first time around. - But now you will. - I won't ever let anything hurt you. Either of you. I know you won't. But just remember, this is ours. Nobody else needs to know how lucky we are. - Are you ashamed of me? - What? - No. - Then why don't you want to tell them? Because they wouldn't understand. Our baby is growing so fast, it would scare them. And that fear might make them want to kill it... ...like they wanted to kill you. But trust me, Connor... ...it won't be too long. They're all going to know what's growing inside of me. Meet your new best friend. If he shows up, the sanctuary spell should keep us safe, but... But? There's always a but. When this is over, can we have a big "but" moratorium? Did I mention the only shots I'm good at involve tequila? Do you think Angelus is planning a repeat performance? - He's gotta know we'd be prepared. - Doesn't mean we drop our guard. If he pops a fang in here, thwack him where it hurts. Good night, not-so-sweet prince. I'll re-check downstairs. Make sure he can't creep into any tunnels. Yeah, if Lilah managed to break and enter... Thought you were more of a taser girl. Sorry. I've... How's Cordy? You know. Tired, I guess. - Maybe I should stop up and check... - No! She doesn't wanna see anyone yet. She just wanted some... ...soup. Really hot soup. Odd bird. And getting birdier. You don't think he and Cordy are still...? Could be the love bug, but I'm not picking up warm fuzzies. I just can't get a good read on it. Not much of the warm or the fuzzies going on. Why should they be different? He's probably just upset about Faith benching him. Anybody else think maybe that was a humongous mistake? Not unless we want Angel back in anything other than a dustpan. Connor's better off playing nursemaid, or whatever he's doing with Cordy. Yeah, but Wes said Faith kind of got demolished. She's supposed to be our best chance of getting Angel back. But what if she's not up to it? Squeaky clean. Let's blow. Right. Sorry about your bathroom. - Let's do it. - I'm not worried about the bathroom. Although I'm fairly sure my security deposit's a complete loss. I need to know you're in the game, Faith. All the way. [SIGHS] Five-by-five, boss. If I were a runic transcription guide, I would be... ...shelved wrong. ANGEL: Talking to yourself, Fred? A lot of that going around. You can't hurt me. We did a no-demon-violence thingy. Oh, the sanctuary spell. Shucks. Oh, wait a minute, I think I... Oh, yeah. Kind of thought you pesky Pls would be humming that old tune... ...so I picked up a little something. Lets me be as demon-y as I want to be. FRED: I don't believe you. How about now? What do you want? Maybe I just miss you. Well, since you brought it up, let's talk Beastmaster. - What do you got? - Nothing. Come on, Fred. All this raw material, brainiac like you... ...you must have a theory. - Lf I did, you're the last person I'd tell. Well, all right, then. I'll just have to figure it out myself, huh? Let's see, take these... ...and this. Thanks for nothing. I do know one thing. You're out of your league. What you're up against, he'll make you his bitch, just like the Beast. So if you're going to kill me, just get it over with. "Made in China"? Lorne! Can't beat a good book. [GUN CLICKS] Too bad. I was just starting to have fun. CONNOR: Why stop now? Connor! Well, isn't that interesting. Nice try, Fred. Think how close you came to stopping me when I'm slaughtering your friends. Toodles. - We track him, we find him, we... - Get your asses kicked? I don't know, wild guess. Sucky spell, huh? You think it would at least go to the sidewalk. Let him go. This is between you and me. It's never just between you and me, Faith. Wes will always be in the middle. That's it, do the math. Can you get to me before I snap his neck? You still that fast? Wes is just dying to find out. - Aren't you, Wes? - Do it! That's it, come on. Do it. Take your shot and save the world. Come on, what are you waiting for? All about choices, Faith. The ones we make and the ones we don't. Oh, and the consequences. Those are always fun. Don't worry about good old Wes. What's one more dead body to us? Come on. Where's my girl? GUNN: Faith! [COUGHING] Go! He's gone. Cordy! Cordy? [TOILET FLUSHING] CORDELIA: What? - Are you okay? - Sure. Except for the morning sickness that can't tell time. Good. I mean, that you're okay. - Why wouldn't I be? - Angelus. He was here again. Excuse me? He was? Downstairs. He caught Fred alone. Used a fake charm. Fooled her and took everything we had on whoever the Beast was working for. That son of a bitch. Nearly killed Wesley outside the hotel, but Gunn and Faith chased him off. Yay for our side. Lilah's book, that stuff from Lorne's head, why does he want all that? I don't know. But whatever Angelus is up to, I'm thinking it can't be good. Just lucky no one got hurt this time. So the sanctuary spell held up? No demon violence in the hotel? Yeah, it worked. He tries dancing in here and pulling a <i>Dark Shadows</i> again... ...he's gonna get a dart up his evil ass. FRED: Well, his ass moves pretty quick. He got the book and the Wolfram and Hart papers. Not your fault. Bet they think it was. Like they were any help. Supergirl wouldn't have fallen for a cheap hunk of crap like this. I'm just glad it was. If anything happened to you... Charles, can we maybe...? - What are you doing with that? - Changing the game. - Thought we weren't going for the kill. - We're not. But, if we get another chance, I want to tranq him. - By blowing his legs off? - You want some help? No. I need someone I trust to watch the hotel. - Someone who can actually hurt him. - I'm all over that. Be careful. Next time he shows up, he might be packing the real thing. We'll start with a perimeter sweep. I'll take point. Stay frosty. - Lf he's still in the area... - You'll let him escape again? This coming from the boy hostage? Angelus was right. You should have gone for him. He would've killed you. And how many will he murder now because you let that make a difference? Angelus is an animal. The only way to defeat him is to be just as vicious as he is. [PANTING] These aren't helping. Half of this crap is written in some archaic, proto-demon cuneiform. And I don't want to be rude, but I think the other half, they just doodled. [SIGHS] [SCREAMING] Don't make me puncture the other one. I just want to get some intel on this Beastmaster fella. I mean, this is an occult shop, right? Like, your job is to help me. - I don't know. - Sure you do. Has a penchant for rains of fire, blotting out the sun? Getting inside your head! MAN: Angelus! Oh, volume! - I am not well pleased! - And I'm not well deaf. Do you think me blind, little man... ... that I don 't see every move before you decide to make it? Dare to seek me out again and your insolence will be punished tenfold. Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh? Give me a migraine? You ethereal types with your big, swinging omniscience. When push comes to shove, though, you gotta send some overgrown... ...slag heap to do your dirty work. That's real spooky. Oh, that's great. You made me lose my shopkeeper. This isn 't the way, my sweet. We should be friends, you and I. No. And I'll tell you why. One, because I'm evil, so the friends thing, that's out. And two, if I had any friends, they wouldn't be living inside my head. Like you're forced to live inside Angel's? [LAUGHING] Because you're the voice in there, aren 't you? Just beneath the surface, buried under all that goodness. Fully conscious, fully aware, but trapped, unable to move or speak. Powerless to act on your desires. So thirsty, so helpless. It must be agony. I'm getting real bored with this game. Then how about a round of show and tell? Soul, soul, who has your soul? Oh, right. Me. More smoke and mirrors. Only a glamour, yes. But I assure you, my sweet, this very moment... ... I hold the real thing in the palms of my very corporeal hands... ... and I will restore it if you don 't behave. I'll put you back in your box, Angelus, and bury you so far inside Angel... ... you'll never claw your way out again. All right, what do you want me to do... ...master? - You really think he'll come back? - Measure twice, cut once. Yeah. - Since this worked so well the first time. - Not your fault. - I should have had him. - Fred, you got out of it alive, so... Because he let me. Why not? All the little mouse could do was squeak at him. Then next time Minnie will take a chunk out of his cheese. If you really think you did something wrong, don't do it again. That simple. Is it? Sometimes. Don't. - All we ever do is turn away. - Fred, l... I know. Whatever Wes was feeling, whatever he thought might... I should have told him it was never gonna happen. Think I don't know that? - That's not what I was gonna say. - But it's what you think. Isn't it? I'm sorry. It's not about that anymore. You know that. All I know... ...is, I miss you. Can't we just go back... ...before any of this? I just want to go back, Charles. I just want to... I... I should do a sweep. Yeah. Come on! I bruise easy. Gee, I wonder what color you'll be when I'm done. Ow! Let's not, shall we? It's cool, dude. No worries. I don't remember anything. I was drunk. I thought she was 18. Gonna work real hard on the not-understanding-that, Lumpy. Francis! Ow! Break his head open. See if there's any candy. - Hey, what do I look like, a pinata? - Let's find out. Whoa, whoa! Ease off the contusion. What do you want to know? - Where's Angelus? - Who? Ow! We've been breathing stale beer and blood half the night in pissholes like this. - Guess where it led us. - I'm telling you, I don't know nothing. On my mother's tumor. And even if I did, I'd never yak to a couple of fleshbags... ...that are about to get their internal organs sucked out of their... Strom demon. Face should grow back. - Eventually. - Think yours will? Oh, that Angelus. In here all the time, running his mouth. "Look at me, I'm so evil." Jackass. Never liked him. I'm on your side. Ow! Oh! - Where is he? - I don't know, I swear. He was in here earlier... ...and then he started mumbling to himself like a big, pretty freak. - And then he slipped into the back. - Back where? What the...? [YELLS] - You okay? - Dandy. [GROWLING] You know, most teenagers check for pimples. I'm not... I wasn't... You tried to take him, didn't you? You attacked Angelus inside the hotel... ...and got spanked by the anti-demon spell? I'm not a demon. I am. At least partly. Kind of a pre-req for the visions gig. You chose that. It's not the same. Why not? I mean, why do l...? - Cordy, I don't even know what I am. - I do. You're a daddy. And daddies need to take responsibility, Connor. You need to face the fact that we're special. Just like our baby's going to be. I'm really going to be a father. The best. And the only thing you ever have to worry about... ...is keeping us safe. So why don't you go back downstairs and see what's going on? I'd feel a lot better if I knew everything that was happening. FAITH: We're gonna get you out of here. Faith. FAITH: Can you walk? - No, but I can fly. - What did they do to her? WESLEY: She did it to herself. They shoot up, the vampires feed. Use them like a filter. I've read the effects can be quite intoxicating, for both of them. Hey, you're pretty. You want to make out? There was a vampire in here earlier. Tall, dark hair... Listen! - Okay. God, what's your issue? - Tall, dark hair, talking to himself. - Let go. - Did you see him? No, I didn't! Stop it! You're hurting me! She doesn't know anything. WESLEY: Maybe not. - What are you doing? - Shut up! The tracks on your arms. You've been here two days straight? - Answer me! - Yeah. Stop. Yes, four. Four days. Then you must have seen the vampire we're looking for. Angelus, I saw him. He... He... Please. - Where is he? - I don't know. Oh, I don't know! Please, stop! He was talking to himself. What was he saying? I don't know. It was like he was talking to someone else. It was all "a rain of fire" and "pulling strings" and "a soul." That's all I heard. Please stop. It hurts. [SCREAMS] Have you totally lost it? I avoided the main arteries. She'll live. If that's what you call this. Whatever's controlling the Beast, it's made contact with Angelus. So what? Torturing humans part of the new makeover? - Did what I had to because you couldn't. - I hit her. - You think that's new to her? - You crossed it back there. You have a problem with a little torture now? I recall a time when you rather enjoyed it. Yeah, well, it's not me anymore. You know that. Nice to have this along, though. Just in case. I remember what you did to me. The broken glass, the shallow cuts... ...so I would remain conscious. You think I'd hurt you again? This the part where you tell me you've turned a new leaf? Found God? Inner peace? We both know that isn't true. You haven't changed. You can't. - Wes... - Because you're sick. You've always been sick. It goes right down to the roots, rotting your soul. That's why your friends turned on you, why the Council tried to kill you. No one trusts you. You're a rabid dog who should have been put down... [GRUNTS] See? Wasn't so hard, was it? It's what you'll need to beat him. No. You have to be willing to take it all the way. I can't risk killing Angel. Not after what he's done for me. There's gotta be another way. Oh. Smacked in the noggin with a two-by-four wrapped in velvet. Yeah, that's what it felt like. I am so, so beyond sorry. Oh, go on. It's the first good nap I've had since the Apocalypse started. - So, what did I miss? - Angelus and his usual freak show. Everybody still has their necks attached. The sanctuary spell did its thing? - Yeah, it's working. LORNE: Hey, one for the good guys. And take two away. I let Angelus walk with Lilah's book... ...and everything Wolfram and Hart suckered out of you. I was gonna frame those. The vampire Moriarty strolls in waving the anti-mojo mojo... ...anybody would've done the same. - Mojo? No-jo. He waved this piece of junk in my face, and I went all spinal-paralysis. Put the blame stick down. Maury's been peddling these to tourists since L.A. Had cable cars. Fools the Bermuda shorts off them every single time. - Maury? - You know where this guy is? Yeah, sure. He hangs his horns in a shop down on Olive. - Why? - Call Wes. Now. Even if he got the fake hoodoo from Maury... ...why would Angelus hang around? - He wouldn't. But this Maury that Lorne knows may be able to help us find... ...where Angelus is hiding. ANGEL: No. But I can. Little birdie in my head told me you'd be here. Whoo! Exciting. Gotta do better than that, Wes. Come on, I'll give you one more. Strike three! Uh-oh. Vampire with a gun. I see why he likes this thing. Wow. You really have gone soft now, haven't you? Hey! You remember that time you tried to get Angel to kill you... ...because you felt all weepy over being such a bad little girl? Do you still feel that way? Do you still want to die? - No. - What's that? - No. - I can't hear you. No! [GUN COCKING] Too bad, because you're gonna. But not like this. Looks like we got a live one. For now. A little tired, sweetie? Want to take a break? Now, this is disappointing. You never used to bleed so easy. - Screw you! - Maybe after. I like my girls to lie still. Hey, buddy, how's it going in there? Good old Wes. Always count on him to tackle a bad situation and make it worse. I mean, hey, look how you turned out. But then again, I guess he really didn't have much to work with, now. [LAUGHS] Save the head trip, GQ. Wes told me you'd try to get under my skin. Gave me just what I need to scratch you out. Oh, don't tell me. The rousing, stiff-upper-lip speech. Rah, rah! Good over evil! Do what must be done! Hang in there, kitten, it's almost Friday! Is that what the scraggly, little ponce armed you with... ...to fight the big, bad bogeyman? Yeah. And this. ANGEL: That hurt, baby. I kind of liked it. [LAUGHING] How about you? There's my girl. Knew she was in there somewhere, dying to come out and play again. - Shut up. - I know how it feels. Forced to be someone you're not. Hurts to the bone. You try to bury the pain, but you can't get the hole deep enough, can you? No matter how much you dig, it's still there. Broken shards stabbing every time you breathe, cutting you up inside. You know, there's only one way to make the pain stop. Hurt someone else. Come on, Faith, you're not even trying. Or is that why you really came back, huh? Not enough to punish yourself in prison? Is that it? Looking for someone to beat the bad out of you? I could beat you to death, but it wouldn't make a difference. Nothing will ever change who you are, Faith. You're a murderer, an animal... ...and you enjoy it. Just like me! No! You're wrong. I'm different now. I'm not like you. But you will be. [CRIES]
