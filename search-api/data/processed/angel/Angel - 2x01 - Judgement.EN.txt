Without you by my side But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong And I grew strong And I learned how to get along You know what I'm talking about. In this city, you better learn to get along... ...for L.A.'s got it all. Glamour and grit, big breaks and heartaches. Sweet young lovers... ...and nasty hairy fiends who suck out your brains. It's the big wacky variety show called Los Angeles. You never know what's next. Let's admit it, folks... ...isn't that why we love it? I'll survive I will survive Hey, hey But why, Johnny? Why? - It's over. - No, I love you! I gave you everything, didn't I? - Yeah, and it's time to move on. - You can't! You're everything to me. I'm nothing without you. Nothing! Ow. Hey, ow! She hit me! I added that myself. She's spineless, begging this creep-- That was just amazing. You were Eleanor, body and soul. Where does she hit me? You're on fire! It's exciting. Let's do it again. Put the focus on how conflicted you-- Cordelia? Sorry. Duty calls. Sorry, lads. I'll have a rematch... ...another time. Ow! Can I help you? The club's for members and guests only. I might join. You can't come in without a pass! Is this the right place? It's a praetorian sacrifice. The quadrants match. Kwaini demons love muscle and mirrors. I'm not fooling around. I'll call the-- No reflection. I'll fix that. Stop that. - He has horns. - Steroids. Bad for you. I think it was a sloth demon. Sloth demons don't sacrifice adolescents. You I.D.'d a Carnyss. - Not the one last night. - It's a nice gym. One burned a month ago. Wolfram and Hart... ...raised it when Angel fought Vocah. At a gym, people encourage you to work out. You don't have to. You're eternal. May not always be. The Vartite Monster: Took two days to kill that thing. It's very Wolfram and Hart. Steam, sauna, fresh towels. How bad can it be? - You shower with lots of men. - I'll always be a loner. Vision! Just a sneeze. - Oh. - Oh?! Bless you. Sorry about this. Why not work at Wes'? We'll get a new office. I haven't-- Sneeze... ...followed by vision. You all right? I'll survive. What is it? A nasty demon. Didn't recognize it. Nasty...demon...unknown...origin. Awful lot of that here. He'll feel right at home. You can review the contract... ...you should. We'll talk Monday. Sign, or we'll sue your ass and kill your kids. Just kidding. Nobody wants a lawsuit. It's nice and gloomy in here. You're not handicapped, you're handi-capable. She likes Chopin and Brahms. She's not fond of the Russians. Hello, Darla. How are you? Feeling any better? - It's a beautiful day outside-- - Shut up. She's not a child. She's 400 years old. The prelude. In C minor. The preludes and the nocturnes. Much better than the waltzes. - He had consumption. - Died too soon. Lot of that around. He's here. - Chopin? - Angel. He's here in town. - You can feel him. - Always could. He hasn't helped us. He killed me. I remember now. With a soul in his heart. He's taken from both of us. So when you feel ready... ...we'll give some back. Angel. Been a long time. I'd love to see that boy. Eyes are farther apart. They look through you. This guy's not afraid of much. I say Northern Pakistan, Hindu Kush. Or the Tien Shenin in Kazakhstan. I need Suleman's Compendium. - Don't yell. You'll scare him. - Scare him? Dennis is sensitive. He wants to help. He's more a person than a G-H-O-S-T. We need an office. There! There! Prio Motu demon. It's a killer. "Ancient Ofga-beast, bred to maim and massacre." Goody. A pit bull. Now we know what we're dealing with. A Prio Motu. We need to find it. It's narrowed down to "somewhere." I can help. I've broadened our contacts to include the underlife. I know who can help. - Who? - Parasite named Merl. We'll pay the stoolie a visit. Make with the chin music till he canaries. I watched a noir festival on Bravo. He goes to a safe haven for demons. I meant to take you. It may be of use. - But.... - But what? It's a bit outside the box. I'm so excited And I just can't hide it Tonight's the night We're gonna make it happen Open your jacket. All right, step back through. I just can't get enough And if you move I'm so excited Your stool pigeon feels safe in a karaoke bar? In this one. It's a sanctuary. Oh, yeah I'm so excited I know I know I know I know I want you, I want you Move over, Pointer Sisters! I'm losing control, and I like it. I'm gonna go talk to Liz. Don't go anywhere. Next, Mordar the Bentback does a personal favorite. Make him welcome. I see someone feels zippy. It's hatching time, but life's more than eating your young. Here's what I see in your aura. Hello, Merl. - Cat got your tongue? - I have no tongue. Oh. - Keep the sucker away. - Can't hurt you here. Hates his own kind, beats on the demons he finds. If they waste my time. Looking for a Prio Motu. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You've never seen one up close. Prios are stone-cold killers. They got teeth that'll.... Sweeten this a whole lot. And keep my name out. Prios don't like it above ground. He'll be in one of those sub-tunnels off Redondo. They're nasty. Not a mosquito like you... ...turns to dust if you stake it. Good luck. Love the coat. It's all about the coat. Welcome to Caritas. - Meaning? - Latin for "mercy." Smart and cute. How about a number? I don't sing. Neither does Mordar. He's a foghorn on two legs. - Who is this guy? - He's anagogic. He looks like he eats enough. Psychic. He's connected to the mystic. When you sing, you bare your soul. He sees into it. This is about your spirit. I can't read you unless you sing. - I don't sing. - Come on, Angel. - I want to hear you sing. - No. - It's a good cause. - Who's the boss? You feel smooth, in the groove. Doesn't that come before a fall? Three things I don't do: tan, date and sing in public. See you around. I'd look fabulous in that coat. It's okay. I won't hurt you. Are you all right? Look out! It's all right. He'd dead. What did you do? Oh, my God. What have you done? What have you done? I thought he would hurt you. He was my protector. Stay away. I'm sorry. I was sent to-- I'm not exactly sure, but-- - Sent here? - By The Powers That-- It's a long story. I help people. You're joking, right? I hate this town. What did he protect you from? - Things you can't handle. - Like what? Like the Tribunal! I don't know you or what your deal is... ...and I don't care. He protected me. I had one friend and you killed him. Stay away from me. He was good? Yeah. And you.... Yeah. That's bad. Which, of course, you already-- Right. Look, he was a demon. I just assumed.... Why wouldn't you? Cordelia said he was a nasty demon. He looked nasty. I didn't say he killed, you did. That's what Prio Motus are. They hunt, kill. We're to think a creature can change its M.O. overnight? Turn into some noble protector and defender of.... Oh, God. I felt no fear when I saw him. Angel should have helped him.... Thanks for the obscure visions. We're doing great. I killed an innocent. He's a soldier, like me. His mission is mine now. It's a start. He protected a pregnant woman. - Find out what the Tribunal is. - We will. You didn't know. But somebody did. You're not on protected ground. The truth. - I told you where. - I'm out of time. - Why'd you lie? - The price on the woman. - Woman or the baby? - The kid. She'll be powerful. The Dark Ones want her and her mom dead. Local brokers offer hard cash, but that Prio was around. - Now that he's gone, we-- - Where is she? If I knew, would I be getting strangled? Nobody touches her. Too late. You know how many are after her? - Where'd he live? - Don't know... ...Boyle Heights, underground, by the DWP. An iffy part of town. Just take the car! Look out! You should go home now. You're welcome! People nowadays. Would it hurt to say thank you? Angel. Been a while. You well? Picture of health. You haven't aged a bit. - Got a situation. - No small talk. Go up to Broadway. See you at the crib. - Where's home? - Nice landlord off 8th. We keep the area safe, he cuts the rent. What's up? - Heard of a Prio Motu? - Is it like a '62 Chevy? I'll just say no. A warrior demon. I thought it was just roaches and vampires. What's he do? He's dead. He lived underground by the DWP. I know the area. You want to do it now? It's urgent. - How deep are these? - Pretty deep. We killed vampires here last year. Now we check it. - And the Prio "Mojo"? - Protected a woman. - He was good? - Yeah. - What scumbag killed him? - I'm the scumbag. Oh. Hold up. That wasn't there before. You feel any air coming out? I don't feel air. Guy kept a neat house. - "Kamal." - What's that? It was his name. Looking for something? - Like that? - I hate to ask, but-- - What you need? - I work with these people. He must see this. Say it's about the Tribunal. The Tribunal. You gonna stay and soak up the guilt? Something like that. You're safe. That's good. You shouldn't be here. You've no right. I know. It's not my choice. Kamal's mission is mine now. You sound just like him, with your missions... ...ancient laws, medieval honor. I don't care. I want to protect my baby. - I understand. - How could you? I don't! Six months ago I worked the register at Costco. I began as a stock girl and I moved up. I could provide for my baby. Now I just hope she's born. I want it too. Right. Because she's a seer or Joan of Arc. Well, you know what she is to me? My daughter. Not a holy mission. Oh, no, it's not exactly that. It's sort of my job. - Your job? - Yeah. Look, I got cards. And an office. It blew up, but we have an apartment in Silverlake. Let me help you. Let me help your daughter. We need the coat of arms. Kamal said to give it to the Tribunal. Maybe if I do, they'll call it-- What? Is it a round bronze talisman, about this big? - Yes. - Yeah. I already found it. Yeah? Where is it? What? I don't have it right here on my person. I know where it is. I can take you there. The address on the card-- Do me a favor. Stop helping. Get back! - I can kill this. Right? - Yes! Sure? You don't think he might be good? Kill it! All right, I think we should run. - Who is it? - Gunn. - What was that? - Something about a gun. What if it's a demon with a gun? Listen, whoever you are. We're armed and we know how to do battle. - If you know what's good for you-- - My name's Gunn. Angel sent me. This is a little embarrassing. Please, come in. Come in. Wesley, you've heard Angel talk about Gunn. He's a great guy with a really fly street tag. - What's he fly? - It's his street name, dorko. It really lets them know you mean business. - It's my name. Charles Gunn. Two N's. - Oh, Lord, will no one shut me up? I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, and this is Cordelia Chase. - It's nice to finally meet. - I've seen you before. - The Tan 'n' Screen commercials. - I saw you in bed. - What?! - This is none of my business. - You too. - Now, just a moment-- In the hospital, after the building blew. He sent me to look after you. - Right. - I'm messing with you. I hoped to fight demons, but I wound up with a delivery job instead. It may have something to do with the Tribunal. This could be an emblem or some sort of protective amulet. These all your cases? - Isn't this the well-oiled machine? - We set them up, we knock them down. Well, we did, until Angel knocked down the wrong-- I'm sure he's on top of it now. What? This way. - Where are we? - Come on. You've been here before. It feels creepy. Yeah. What's the Tribunal? Some other-worldly court. Supposedly, they can save me and my baby. You go before them with the charm.... I don't know how it works. Kamal said he'd be my champion. Screw this. I'm getting out of town. - Try and stop me. - They'll find you. Stay with me. - You can't protect me. - I can. We'll get the charm and I'll make this right. There's a gate in back-- Go to the address I gave you. Go! - Are you all right? What happened? - Is she here? The pregnant woman? No. - Gunn brought us the talisman, but-- - Working on it. I told her to come here. She doesn't trust me. Why should she? You can't see everything. You're just a vampire like everyone else-- - That didn't come out right. - I thought I was out of the tunnel. Sure, you did. Because the tunnel is, you know, it's something we all-- Are we talking a real tunnel or symbolic? I saw the light at the end of the tunnel... ...that, some day, I might become human. That light was so bright... ...I thought I was already out. Yeah, we all got a little cocky, didn't we? It's gonna be a long while till you work your way out. But I know you well enough to know you will. And I'll be with you until you do. - And your inevitable stardom? - I didn't say I won't have a day job. We've got something. It's medieval. A small badge or coat of arms to be presented when going before the: - Translated, the Chair of Judgement. - The Tribunal. A court to settle grievances. - With lawyers and stuff? - This is a little more primitive. - It's a fight to the death. - Kamal.... - Where would it be? - There's no way to tell. They could rise up in our reality whenever. We gotta find her right away, whatever it takes. There's only one way. You came and you gave Without taking But I sent you away Oh, Mandy Oh, Mandy That man will do anything to save a life. Stop me from shaking And I need you today Oh, Mandy How about that? A performer. Let's just call him "Angel, the vampire with soul." While I chat with "Tall, dark and rocking"... ...Durthock the Child-eater will open up. A Gorrishyn Mage stole his power... ...so he's feeling a little bit country. Let's give him a hand. You're just the hot ticket. One night only, two seats left, partially obstructed view. - So tell me. - You're all business. She's in danger. You're feeling guilty. You made an honest mistake. A lot of guys would have done the same. Of course, now she has no champion. - That's looking grim for her. - Where are they? Who's a little curt? Who's a little Curt Jürgens in The Enemy Below? The Tribunal will be wherever she is. - And where is she? - My question first. And answer true, because you know I'll know. Why "Mandy"? Well, I know the words. - I kind of think it's pretty. - It is, you big sap. There's not a destroyer of worlds can argue with Manilow. - The trial's at 4th and Spring. - How does it work? I can only tell you what I tell you. The rest is up to you. - Can I save her? - Try, and find out. - Where is your champion? - He's dead. - You have no talisman or champion? - I ask for asylum. Asylum is not ours to give. Two are chosen to meet in combat. One can save your life, one can take it. This is the ancient law. Your life is forfeit. You have no champion. Yes, she does. The trial by combat will begin. I really appreciate you coming through for us. But you know how you're not really good at anything? Can you do this? - I grew up around horses. - How long since you've ridden one? It's been a while. Don't worry, it's not something you forget. I can do this. Nice horse. Try not to make me look stupid out there, okay? All right. I guess that means go. The champion is defeated. She and all her issue are yours. I move to appeal that ruling. - She's safe now, right? - You have won. She's under our protection, as is her daughter until she comes of age. Are you okay? Yeah. - You sure seem to bleed a lot. - It's part of the job. Start over with a fresh slate. We're starting over with no slate. Of course. We shouldn't be keeping score. We're not running a race. We're doing a job, one soul at a time. You guys hold the fort. I have somewhere to be. Close off the yard, Cellblocks A to C, Hey. Hey. - How you doing? - Pretty good, I guess. I did sign up for this. Regretting the choice? Bad day. A girl tried to build her rep by throwing down with me. She had low self-esteem and a homemade knife, so.... Is she... ...you know... ...alive? She lives to tell the tale. I took the knife away. I can't say much for her wrist. - So you didn't kill her. - I really wanted to. Took a good beating from the guards too. - I'm sorry. - I've earned worse. Guys like us got it coming. - I had to sing Barry Manilow. - You're kidding. In front of people. And here I talk about my petty problems. - Wanted to give you some perspective. - "Copacabana"? "Mandy." I don't want to dwell on it. The road to redemption is a rocky path. That it is. Think we might make it? We might. - Food getting any better? - It's similar to what I grew up on. It's a little one-note, eating the same thing every day. I wonder what that's like. I remember all my life How you kissed me And stopped me from shaking Mandy, um.... look in their eyes I see them in-- How you kissed me And stopped me It's shaking. Freaks in the house, up front. Oh, Mandy
