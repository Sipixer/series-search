I repeat, we need immediate assistance. Get out.! As fast as you can.! Come on.! Let's go.! - Lawson, get those men forward.! - All right, you heard the captain. - Clear the compartment. Let's lock it. - Lock it down up there! - Dog the hatches. Get the men... [Screams] - Captain? Somebody help me! - Get in here! Oh, God. - [Growling] Help me! [Roaring] - [Captain Yelling] - [Bones Crunching] Captain! Tactical swept her hangouts, and our locators ran through their usual voodoo. Each came back with the same result. Eve has vanished. Well, I can't say I'm particularly depressed by that news. She did leave swearing vengeance. That doesn't usually go well for us. Well, the senior partners don't take betrayal lightly. Yeah, well, gotta figure they whisked her up shortly after they nabbed the scheming prince. - Speaking of which... - Uh, no news. But goin' off a company precedent, right about now... Lindsey should be boiling in his own filth. "Should be" is not gonna cut it. Let's find out for sure. Well, the White Room's empty. Our liaison to the senior partners has vanished. It's hard gettin' information anymore. We may be able to establish a new liaison through a-a... through a protocol... Uh, sorry. Must be tired. Um, we've got options. I'll get on it. It can wait till morning. Eve's vanished. Let's end on a high note. Whoa. Calling the patient before midnight on a Friday? Careful, gang. We might get to have social lives. Speak for yourself. I've got five or six hours of spell detailing to do. And I got a mess of briefings to go through. And I have to redo the entire Trask experiment. Knox really dropped the ball on that one. - Yes, he is unreliable. Good point. - So much for social lives. Well, should we at least meet back here in a few hours and talk about some work some more? Sounds lovely. [Fred] What did we do with our lives before we got these jobs? I seem to recall lots and lots ofJenga. Well, I'm outta here. If we're working... there's a client party down at Skybar with my name all over it. - That counts as work? - You been to Skybar lately? It's all frat boys and television executives. - Hey, if you're detailin' spells... - [Elevator Bell Dings] Maybe we should go over the portal incantations from last Monday's Mithroc retreat. Oh, God, Gunn. Don't even start. We got enough work for one night. Let's not worry about yesterday. Excuse me? - Hello? - Oh. Hi. I'm sorry. L-I was just trying to understand some of your equations here. I used to have a bit of a head for numbers. It's funny how you lose part of your mind when you stop using it. Is there something I can help you with? Oh, don't be alarmed, Miss Burkle. I just came to talk. - How do you know my name? - Do you like workin' here? - What? - You know. Do you enjoy what you do? Do you find yourself wakin'up in the morning... eager to start your day? Uh, I don't know. L-I mean, I guess I had my doubts at first. - But lately, I've been feeling... - Please don't try and run, Miss Burkle. I'd have to stop you. - What do you want? - Actually, I came to see your boss. Angel and I are old acquaintances. I was friends with him back in the day... back when he was in his patriotic phase. [Radio: Big Band] [Man] All right, calm down. Calm down. Now, when I say "calm down," I'm talkin' to you, of course. These guys I want wound good and tight, case you don't feel like listenin'. Sit down, son. We need to talk. [Radio Shuts Off] You ever considered joining the war effort? - No. - Well, it's a shame. Times like these, we can use... all the able-bodied men we can get. I'm not a man. I guess you already knew that. Everybody's gotta do his part. That's all I'm sayin'. Doenitz has been kickin' the holy hell out of us in the Atlantic. Allies are losin' up to a hundred ships a month to his U-boats. Their damn submarines are faster, stronger... and more powerful than anything we've got in the water. Say what you will about the Krauts, them sons of bitches know how to build a boat. Up till now, we haven't had much luck figurin'out what makes 'em tick. Two days ago, our boys managed to capture... what appears to be a T-class German prototype submarine. That's... great news. Yes, it is. Unfortunately, when they were bringin' it back here, somethin' went wrong. Late last night, we received fragments of a distress call. Somethin'was on that ship. Have you ever heard dying men screaming for their lives, Angel? Of course he has. [Man] That sub's stuck in hostile territory... and we need it if we're gonna win this war. It's down too deep to send divers. The pressure, cold... it'd kill a man. But... those aren't problems for you... are they? You've been on our radar for some time now, Angelus. - Name's Angel. - Oh, right. You have a soul now. I represent a relatively new agency... Demon Research Initiative... and we think that you might be the solution to our little problem. I'm not interested. Aah! [Coughs, Groans] We don't particularly care. We figure... we strap enough weight to you, you will sink, regardless of your interest. We need that sub, and we need you to deal with... what's on it. We had our intelligence investigate the submarine's cargo manifest. We think we know what attacked our boys. [Sighs] - How you holdin' up, Hodge? - [Nervous Chuckle] Tiptop, sir. We gotta keep it steady, sailor. If we're gonna get out of this, we need you sharp. We gotta figure out our next move. We got no means of controlling the ship from up here. And these bulkheads hold, we got maybe two days of air left. That's assuming that they don't figure out how to get through that hatch. What the hell were those things, Lawson? I bet you our friend Fritz here knows. Huh? Huh? What the hell were you sick bastards carrying? - [German] - [Man Screaming] - Shut up, Spinelli. - [Screaming Continues] - Help.! Aah.! - That's Lewis. Shh! - Christ, he's still alive back there. - Help me.! Help.! [Screaming] - What do you think you're doin'? - Get out of my way, Spinelli. They're dead. Nothing we can do to help them now. Stay here. I'll go alone. Guys! You open that hatch, we all die. You get that gun out of my face right now. Right now. [Loud Thud] What was that? - Moving on the hull. - [Clattering] Torpedo room. Bring the German. [Clattering Continues] It's in the tubes. What the hell is it? Could be another one of them. - I say we flush the tubes... - Shh! [Tapping] That's S.O.S. Open tube number one. You wanna tell me how a man gets 400 feet down without so much as a dive suit? Which one of you is Captain Franklin? The captain's dead. - Who's in charge? - Suppose that'd be me. Under Naval Op 407, I'm supposed to issue you... order Charlie Baker Oboe Victor. - Verification? - Nautilus. - Yes, sir. - All right. - [Clanking] - Somebody wanna get these things off me? I'm telling you. He's some sort of super soldier... like Steve Rogers or Captain America. Steve Rogers <i>is</i> Captain America, you eight ball. - What? - We're all that's left. An ensign, a helmsman... a handful of petty officers. Afraid we're not much. - Not against them. - What's your name, Ensign? - Lawson, sir. Sam Lawson. - Okay, Lawson. Keep everyone in this room. Lock it up tight. Yes, sir. Sir. I have seen what those things can do to a man. - I wouldn't go in there unarmed, not by yourself. - Keep it. You may need it. It's okay, Lawson. I know what I'm up against. Don't open up this door for anything other than me. Yes, sir. Angelus. They'll let anyone in here. Of all the bloody faces I expected to see down here. - You're a Nazi? - What? Oh, no. I just ate one. So, they got you too, eh? [Sighs] Nabbed me in Madrid. Sneaky bastards, the S.S. Don't ever go to a "Free Virgin Blood" party. Turns out it's probably a trap. You were captured at a "Free Virgin Blood" party? I know. Who would've thought? One minute I'm askin' a fella why all the virgins look like Goebbels. Next minute, I'm stuck in a box in this cursed ship. I feel better knowin' that they got you too. Though I can't say I'm surprised. From our company... it looks like they're roundin' up the baddest of the bad. - You'll have to introduce me. - Of course. But I gotta warn you, uh, they're a bit stiff. Oh, Angelus, this is, uh, Nostroyev and the Prince of Lies. Nostroyev, Prince of Lies, this is Angelus. - The Angelus. - Angelus. Used to be quite a terror back in the day. Haven't heard much of you lately, though. Haven't heard much of you ever. Nostroyev, Scourge of Siberia. Butcher of Alexander Palace. - Sorry. - I was Rasputin's lover! Uh, look, I broke these two out just shortly after I got free. Didn't know you were back there. Would've come for you as well. Suppose we had our hands full with the sailors, didn't we? [Sinister Chuckling] - Anybody still alive back here? - Nah. We just finished off the last of'em. What about back there? You save us anything? - Couple men left in the torpedo room. - Well, what are we waiting for? - No. - What? We're not killing any more humans. - Well, not right now. - Why the hell not? 'Cause in case you haven't noticed, Spike, we're trapped at the bottom of the ocean. - Yeah? So? - We're underwater? So unless you know how to operate one of these things, we're gonna need their help. Oh, come on. How hard can it be? Forward, back, up, down... - [Alarm Blaring] - [Hissing] [Alarm Stops] Tell you what. We'll leave one alive to work the boat... and eat the rest. - No. - Uh, yeah. Probably should warn you. He likes to pretend he's the boss. You may have made a name for yourself muscling around weaker vampires... - Hang on. - But I'm Nostroyev. I will tear you open and play... "Coachman, Spare Your Horses" on the lute of your entrails. Get out of my way. [Screaming] We don't kill the humans till we reach land. Is that clear? Heil Hitler. Hiya, Chief. Oh, come on. Don't tell me you don't recognize me. Spend time in a tube, you should know your crew like the back of your hand. Lawson. You see there? I'm touched. Aren't you gonna ask me how I got in here? No. You'd be amazed at how many people break into this building... - on a regular basis. - But I had a whole bit planned... about how I was always good with technology, and you, of all people, should know that. Yeah, sorry. This place might as well be a bus station. Seems like you're doing pretty well for yourself. It's a far cry from all those years you spent in the gutters eating rats. You've been following my life. I'm touched. I just check in every decade or so. Imagine my surprise when I found out that... Mr. Vermin Eater himself was suddenly fighting evil... and running Wolfram and Hart. [Chuckles] Mind explaining that one to me? Those two don't exactly go hand in hand. It's complicated. I find that's true about most things these days. I don't mean to sound like an old man, but... we used to live in simpler times, didn't we? Never thought I'd miss bein' on that sub. Things made a kind of sense. Keep your head down, watch each other's backs... And stay alert. Follow our lead. We'll get out of this. All right? [Angel] Lawson, this is Spike, the Prince of Lies. Put 'em to work if you need 'em. Spinelli, take Heinrich up to the galley. Then do a full systems check. You got five minutes. Start with the batteries. I want juice as soon as possible. O'Shea, you're at the helm. Tyler, you're gonna have to handle bow and stern for now. If we have to surface, we can't outmaneuver theJerries on batteries alone. I'll work on the engines once we're underway. - But right now, I just wanna get moving. - And where does the captain sit? Uh, right there. Oh. Right. And now, uh... who brings the captain his drink? Hodge, you're on communications. Hodge.! What should I do? Sit down over here, Prince of Lies. This bathysphere is perplexing. Let's get these bodies out of here. May I speak freely, sir? I recognize there's a lot goin' on here that I don't understand. But those monsters butchered my crew. Apparently, they're in the S.S. Spike's not in the S.S. He just likes wearin' the jacket. Yeah, that doesn't help me understand why we're workin' with 'em. Or keepin' 'em alive, for that matter. - I got 'em under control. - That's not the point. - He killed my captain, sir. - We may be able to use them. - We don't have much of a crew left. - I don't think we'll need 'em. - They're extra hands. - They're monsters. - And I don't know why we... - You don't need to know why. We gotta bring this sub in. Those are our orders. Isn't that the point? Following orders? There's a difference between orders and purpose, sir. Now, I didn't sign on 'cause I needed directions. Hell, growin'up, I used to make fun of the military boys. Always figured they wouldn't know how to tie their shoes... if someone didn't give 'em the go-ahead. Then I saw pictures of what the Krauts were doin'. Evil's spreadin', sir. And it's not just over there. It was on my ship. It killed my crew, and we gotta stop it. Now, I've been scared out of my mind since I signed on for this duty. But I can keep it together. I can even handle dying... if I know it's for a greater purpose. We got a job to do. That job is gonna help us win the war. I don't need you to understand every detail. Just know we're fightin' on the same side. I need you to trust that I'm gonna get us all through this... safe and sound. "Safe and sound." Guess now's not the time to argue semantics, is it? Did you care about any of it? The ship? The mission? The men? - Or were you just in it to save your own ass? - What do you want, Lawson? Same thing I've always wanted... to understand. Understand what, exactly? Why we do what we do. How you manage to always... You sure you wanna do that, Chief? Fairly certain I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again. Oh, I never doubted you. But you gotta ask yourself: Would I really come in here unarmed, knowing that, without an ace in the hole? Wouldn't make much sense, would it? What did you do? [Elevator Bell Dings] Now, I don't need you to understand every detail... but I do need you to trust that I'm gonna get us all through this safe and sound. Easy, now. That's double-aught wire wrapped around your crew's necks. Take a fellow's head clean off with just a little tug. Best not go roughhousing. Something might get knocked over. Whatever you want from me, this isn't the way to get it. [Chuckles] Already gettin' it. The worry in your eyes... fear of what might happen next. Which is right on the mark, 'cause I got a funny feeling... there is gonna be some blood spilled tonight. For old time's sake. Is that any better? Little bit. Stern plates are still dragging. Well, let's hope we don't have to control down in a hurry. - You need any help with the bow plane? - Chris has got it. [Chuckles] Well, keep an eye on him, all right, just in case. Any signs of life? Nothin', huh? I suppose the quieter, the better. Come on. When am I gonna get a turn? In about never. I'm playin' nice with the anchovies, like you asked. - At least let me have a go at the wheel. - Pipe down. - I'm tryin' to work. - Oh, "pipe down." That official sailor talk, is it? Well, ahoy, matey. You can just swab my deck. - Spike... - Captain. - What? - I wanna be called "Captain." I mean, hell, I did eat him. Check the torpedoes before I stuff you in a tube and send you for a swim, <i>Captain.</i> - We gonna have a situation, sir? - He'll do what I tell him. - 'Cause you know each other. From before this, right? - Somethin' on your mind, son? I just wanna make sure this boat gets to where it's goin'. That and my crew are all that matters. How they holding up? They knew capturing a Jerry sub could be a one-way ticket. But they're good men. They'll keep it together and they'll follow orders... or they'll have me to answer to. Good. Everybody keeps their cool, we might just make it out of this. - [Man Screaming] - Damn it! What the hell are you doing? You think I don't know? I am as ancient as the darkness itself. Yeah, you're real old. We know. Just calm down. [Prince Of Lies] They dare conceive such violations upon my temple. The Prince of Lies is not a slab of meat to be set upon by insignificant maggots! Put a sock in it. [Speaking German] I will suck the brain from your skull... and digest your thoughts like a sour pudding. [Yelling] [German] - You all right? - Nothin' a year of shore leave won't fix. He exploded. He stabbed him, and hejust exploded. Back to your stations. Now.! How does a guy just explode like that? The man's askin' a good question. - You really need an answer? - Might help if I heard it for sure. - Vampire. - Yeah, I take it back. Doesn't help. So what do you think set him off? I'm guessin'these had something to do with it. Anybody read Nazi? Right. Let's have it. Don't have time for this, Spike. Better hurry it up then... before I get peckish. [German] - How's that again, mate? - He says you're an idiot. You speak German? - Enough to get by. - Well, gravy. I'll menace, you talk. [Snarling] [German] [German] - [German] - He says it's research. - What kind? - [German] ... vampire. - What about vampires? - I don't know. It's technical. Somethin'about stimulation and control. They've been experimenting on them and cutting into their brains. That what got the Prince's coronet in a twist, didn't it? Found out you were gonna pop our tops and melon-ball us. They're tryin'to create an army out of things like you. Yeah, explains why they nicked us. Cream of the crop. Wanna build an army of vampire slaves... you start at the top with the generals. It's not enough what you're already doing in the world, is it? Only you and your Führer could come up with something this sick. [Chuckling] [German] [German] - Am I the only one don't speak Kraut? - You knew about this? - He did? - It's part of the mission. - What mission? Oh, I get it. You're playin' both sides against each other. - Spike... - No, I respect that. But if the Yanks are after this stuff, too, I'm eatin' the lot of'em. - No, you aren't. - Try and stop me. Spike, we need them, okay? I'm not gettin' trapped at the bottom of the sea. And I'm not gettin' experimented on by his government. We wouldn't do that. You don't win a war by doin' whatever it takes. You win by doin' what's right. - Yeah? Let me know how that works out for you, Popeye. - None of this matters. Your people are gettin' this ship and their men on board that are still alive. That's all. Spike, torch it. - Damn skippy. - [German] [Chuckling] God save the king Send him victorious - Happy and glorious - [Thud] What was that? Ow! Bloody hell! - [Explosion] - Bloody hell! - [Explosions Continue] - [Lawson] Depth charges. - Talk to me, Hodge. - Contact maneuvering, sir. - Multiple cavitations. - How many? - Hodge? - I'm pickin' up at least three... four destroyers. Four? We couldn't take on one in this condition. Splashes! - Sixty meters, fast dive! - Sixty meters, fast dive! Aye, sir! - Spinelli, bow plane. - Bow plane! Aye, sir! - Hold steady. Six degree down bubble. - Six degrees, mark. - What can I do? - Hang on. [Sonar Pinging] Krauts are shootin' blanks. [Explosion] - Hang on, men! - [Shouting, Indistinct] - Report! - Propulsion motor's down! We're dead in the water! - Go. Get it back up. - I d... - I'm not sure if I can. - Get sure fast! [Explosion] We're taking on water! Somebody secure the other compartment, now! - We're on it! - What..."We"? What do you mean, "we"? [Explosion] It's no good. The damn thing's stripped. Never... liked... the ocean. Hey, where's Fritz? Come on, Sally. Give it up. Screwdriver. Where the hell's the screwdriver? [Lawson] Funny what goes through a man's mind... when his life's hangin'in the balance. Boys talked about that a lot back on the boat. Always figured it'd be the special moments you freeze in time. Your mom singin' you to sleep at night. Sneakin'into the movies with your best friend. The way your girl's hair shimmers in the sun. But the truth is... the only thing that really goes through your head is... "Wow. This really sucks." And then you're gone. - Lawson! - I'm all right. - Easy, easy. - I'm all right. Try not to move. We're dead without propulsion. - Tell me what to do. - I'm the only one. I'm the only one. [Coughing] I'm not gonna let any more die. I can fix it. I can fix it. [Coughs] I know you can. Air's about gone. Your new boy better get the engines runnin' before the fish start floppin'. He'll get it done. Hope it's in time. The one on the end looks like he's done for. Be a blessing to put him out of his misery. [Engines Powering Up] Get 'em on their feet. We need to surface. Your lucky day, isn't it? - You did it. - I told you I could. Good work. Thanks, Chief. You too. - We're surfacing. - Yeah. Is that a sharp maneuver with Jerry still trollin' for us? We're out of air. Crew's not gonna make it if we don't vent. They swore to give their lives for their country, just like me. - Besides, I'm hungry. - They're still your men. But they're not the mission. Are they? You're new at this. I'm not. Let's take a walk. They look smaller. Eight hours to sunrise. Twenty miles from land. I just might make it. Hey. I'm sorry for what happened. But if I ever see you again, I'm gonna have to kill you. Aye, aye, Chief. Take good care of her. She's a good boat. Bloody brilliant. Turn the poor sod to save the ship... then make him dash for dry land before Mr. Sunshine scorches him a new one. You're still a dick. Yeah. I am. Bollocks. Did they at least torture you? Please tell me they did. Never gave them a chance. Jumped ship off the coast of Maine. Went underground till the war was over. - Like any other coward. - Wars are won and lost by men. You mean, like me? No, wait. That doesn't apply anymore, does it? - I never wanted to do this to you. - Oh, put your hanky away. I know how important the technology they pulled from the sub was... to helpin'us stop the Germans. Sounded like a fair shake. One person damned to make the world safe for future generations. Except these guys. Killing them's not gonna change the past. But it'll hurt you. Maybe that's enough. Never is. Then maybe I found my mission again after all these years. Being an evil son of a bitch not keeping you busy? We all need a reason to live, even if we're already dead. Mom, apple pie, stars and stripes... That was good enough for me till I met you. Then I had this whole "creature of the night" thing goin' for me... the joy of destruction and death... and I embraced it. I did all the terrible things a monster does. Murdered women and children, tortured fathers and husbands just to hear 'em scream. And through it all, I felt nothing. Sixty years of blood drying in my throat like ashes. So what do you think? Is it me, Chief? Or does everyone you sired feel this way? You're the only one I ever did this to... after I got a soul. Do I have one too? I don't think it works that way, son. Didn't think so. You gave mejust enough, didn't you? Enough of your soul to keep me trapped between who I was and who I should be. I'm nothin' because of you. You really want it to end like this? Sounds like a plan. Come on, Chief. Give me a mission. Really oughta do somethin' about security. [Chuckles] They'll let anybody in here, won't they? Fred gave me the Cliff Notes. So sailor boy finally came back for a yo-ho-ho, did he? Finally came back. Took him long enough. I know revenge is best served cold and all, but his must've been frozen solid. I don't think that's what he was after. No? Then what
