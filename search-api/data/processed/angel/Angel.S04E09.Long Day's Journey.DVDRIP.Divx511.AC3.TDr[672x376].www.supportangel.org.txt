- I'm a freak. Warm enough? Connor, this is where you were born. [MAN SCREAMING] GUNN: So, what the hell is it? WESLEY: Ancient alchemical symbol for fire. ANGEL: And destruction. CORDELIA: Connor, this isn't your fault. - What if it is? - <i>You never had a childhood...</i> ... or anything that's real. And if this is the end, I want you to have something that is. - It's over, Lilah. - You're serious. I believe a day of reckoning has arrived. ANGEL: <i>The girl.</i> Whatever she is, it came for her. The answer is among you. I'm just glad that everyone's safe and together again. Me too. Now... ...take your new boyfriend and get the hell out of here. [KNOCKING] Room service. Hey. Got you some nice O-positive here. Freshly nuked, for that right-out-of-the-jugular taste. Just put it on the table. Hmm, good likeness. Uh, you wouldn't mind if I ran screaming from the room, would you? Shut the door on your way out. All right. You want to play it this way, we'll play it this way. - Play what? - Angel, sweetie, why so down? - "Don't interrupt me. I'm brooding." - I'm not brooding. I'm researching. The apocalyptic Beast who's turned our city into an abattoir? Yeah, so is everybody else, Wesley included. - Downstairs, together. - I work better alone. [CHUCKLES] That's it, I see. It's all about you. Silly old Lorne, thinking it was about saving the world from ending. Welcome to the big leagues, Angel. You're a champion. You don't get personal days. There's nothing on this Beast, Lorne. I fought it once. It nearly decapitated me with my own stake. It's killed hundreds that I couldn't save. And it keeps showing up around my kid. - My kid who's... - Not entirely unmaking... ...with the moves on the Girl-Who-Might've-Been? You want to shove that into English for me? I know about Connor and Cordelia. It's a vibe, it's a thing. - I know. What can I say? - You can say goodbye. Take a hike. Connor's still gonna be your son, you know... ...when it's all said and done. And you may not find perfect happiness with Cordelia. But, Angelfood, you gotta remember... ...there's other fish in the sea. ASHET: Miss Raiden. Mr. Ashet. - It's an honor to finally meet you. - Yes. I suppose it would be. I apologize for your long journey when I can't offer better news. You haven't changed your mind? Mr. Ashet, I understand the amulets you want acquired are very valuable? Yes, that's because they're extremely rare and powerful. - Protective amulets. - Yeah. And considering the Holy Roller Revelations party... ...that seems to be going on lately, I can see why you might want them. But, as juicy as the commission is... ...I've got this problem, wherein... ...I'm very respectfully going on vacation... ...to Tahiti, sir. You have no idea who I am, do you, Miss Raiden? Or of the dire importance of recent events. I know enough to go to Tahiti. Well said. Perhaps, then, I won't kill you for your... Long Day's Journey Close one? Four blocks over. They're getting more frequent. A couple of times last night... ...I even dreamt I heard... - Screaming. It wasn't a dream. Things are falling apart out there. It's not your fault, you know. We should go over to the hotel today. Talk to my dad. - See if they found out anything new. - They would've told us if they had. Probably just safer if we stay put. Wish I'd known you weren't taking your turn on the bed. Maybe I wouldn't have this achy floor-neck. I didn't want to sleep there without you. - Oh, boy. - I heard that. I'm sure you did. - It's the super-hearing. - Whatever you say. Kind of makes you wonder where I got it from. I'm going to go wash up. Have you seen my... ...towel? - Super-speed. And super-strength too. Connor, we've been cooped up here together for two days straight. Because you won't take me back to the hotel. They don't want me there, do they? Angel doesn't want me there. They think I'm connected to the Beast. It's why you don't want me either. Angel knows we slept together. That's why you can't go back to the hotel. - He...? - He knows... ...Connor, all right? With his super-smelling and super-Tom-peeping... ...and I don't even know what else. But he knows. And he's extremely upset with both of us right now. We didn't do anything wrong. We hurt him. That's enough. What is it? A vision? What do you see? Nothing. I... I have to see Angel. How do you know I'll be here when you get back? Aren't you afraid I'm gonna run off and join the demon? I trust you, Connor. I don't trust him. You can't say that. Connor hasn't done anything wrong. You forgetting Angel's voyage to the bottom of the sea? Charles, the little girl in that white room was evil. I felt it. - When she said... - "The answer is among you." Who else could Creepylocks be talking about? It was probably a mind game to get the Beast... ...to come after us instead of her. - That's another thing. Connor's gone toe-to-toe with him twice... ...and barely needed a boo-boo kiss. That's not suspicious? Most of us have encountered the demon twice. We're still here. We weren't conveniently born in the exact spot it hatched. FRED: "The answer is among you." Have I mentioned I hate cryptic messages? Well, there's one thing I can decrypt. My sources have confirmed that without the little girl... ...the earthly contingent of Wolfram and Hart... ...is cut off from the senior partners, effectively neutralized. However, it appears that was not her only function. I've found an entry in Rheinhardt's Compendium for that same little girl. Or, rather, the entity presenting itself as one. Her name is Mesektet. - I figured Tiffany or Brandy. - So Wolfram and Hart... ...was just a day job. - Sort of. You see, Mesektet was one of five enormously powerful beings... ...which are linked to an embodiment of the ancient god Ra. Which makes them totems, right? Symbolic manifestations. Yes. Totems which, together, form an order called the Ra-Tet. Must be big. Never heard of them. Their origins have been shrouded in mystery since the dawn of time. Only the totems themselves know their true purpose. So maybe he killed this Mesektet... ...for another reason. I'll hit the Net. - Charles, you wanna update Angel? - Mr. Do-Not-Disturb? Doubt it. Don't know why we're bothering with the Ra-Ra's. "The answer is among you," remember? [DOOR OPENS] Rumor mill has Dr. Feelbad attached to another slice-and-dice yesterday. - Who was it? LORNE: Lovely woman. High-and-mighty, white-magic shaman type. That didn't even faze the Beast. - Tore her heart right out of her chest. - The m.o. Doesn't match. Mesektet had some sort of energy sucked from her. He didn't touch her heart. Lorne, you didn't happen to catch a name, did you? Like Ma'at? Yeah, that's the lady. - Another member of the Ra-Tet. GUNN: He's taking them out... ...one by one. - We can't assume that yet. This Beast has killed hundreds with his bare hands. Throw in the storms and quakes that accompanied the rain of fire... ...you could put the death toll in the thousands. Wes is right. Statistically, it's still a coincidence. Two points... Make a line, not a pattern. [STEPS APPROACHING] - Hi, guys. LORNE: Oh, hey, Cordy. What's up, Cordy? [SIGHS] Okay, I gotta go see Angel. I told you Connor can't be trusted. Look how weird he's made her. [KNOCKING] - What is it? CORDELIA: It's me. I know I don't have to be invited in, but it is polite. ANGEL: Go away, Cordelia. Well, you know that never works. - I don't know where to start. - Skip to the end... ...where you leave and we don't talk. Aren't you gonna ask how Connor is? - Like I really want a progress report. - That's not what I meant. He's scared. Scared that you think he's connected to the Beast. Well, you know, it does tend to show up whenever he's around. I swear, like father, like son. The two of you have cornered the market on teenage snits. - How about you stop being angry...? - How about you stop pretending... ...to give a damn about my feelings? I do give a damn. In fact... ...I give a whole lot of damn. That's why I came over here. To tell you... ...get over it. - What? - I had a vision... - Get over it? ...of the Beast. - I never really thought about that. Get over it. Why didn't I think about that? It's so simple. Angel. I'm sorry I hurt you. It was the last thing in the world I wanted to do. But you have to get past it, and you have to get past it now... ...because there are bigger things at stake. I know it's not fair, but it's the way it is. People need you. Your son needs you. Tell me about your vision. It was... ...different from any other. I felt like I was inside somebody else, listening to the demon talk. But I couldn't tell if it was in the past or in the future... ...or even where we were exactly. Who was inside you? I mean, who was it you were inside? I couldn't tell. But I did feel like there was more I wasn't getting. Like I was just scratching at the surface of something. - Maybe it'll come to me. - So, what did the demon say? Don't know. All I got was a visual. - Not much to go on, Cordy. - But it's something. A vision means the phone lines between us and the Powers That Be are still open. - Maybe they'll send us a clue. - As if somebody is up there watching. I was. But I'm back now. So you're gonna have to suck it up and deal... ...because things are going to hell. And you're the leader. So lead. The Powers are sending us a wake-up call, people. Sure, we've been... I don't want to say demolished. Beaten. And sure, it's slightly demoralizing... ...but from here on out, we're on the offensive. We'll find out its weaknesses, we'll go in prepared... ...and we're gonna fight smart. It's time to take down the Beast. We're all behind you, Angel, a hundred percent. But how can we be prepared when there's nothing on this thing? Yeah, and weaknesses? It's not a sure bet El Destructo has any. - Everyone has an Achilles' heel. - Until we find his... ...we'll be cooling ours. We got nothing without a new lead. - Gwen. - Hi there. Long time, no hand-to-hand. - I remember you. - That guy you killed? Yeah, that's him. Kicked you in the face too, didn't I, cherry? Sorry about that, I really do try to avoid contact. Mostly. - Cordelia, this is... - I know who she is. Caught your show on the Omniscient Higher Plane Channel. Thanks. So you're the girl who makes his heart go pitter-pat. Figuratively, at least. - You must be so happy. - I am... ...not having the best week, honestly. - Tell me about it. I mean, really, tell me, freak to freak. Is the world about to end, or what? - Something happen to you? - Met with a client last night... ...in the oil fields, which is odd, because I bagged for this guy six years. Big money. He never wanted to meet before. Fascinating as these details must seem to you... ...we're dealing with much more important stuff right now. Apocalypse. End of the world. Also, while we were talking... ...he got his chest punched out by a big demon with a head made of rock. Demon, okay? The whole nine. Cloven feet and horns and teeth and... He wasn't wearing lam<i>e</i>, though. The evil ones can't pull it off. It gets camp. This client of yours. Was anything removed from the body? Didn't see. But you are hands down the weirdest person I know... ...so I figured I'd ask you what's going on. FRED: Um, excuse me. Not that I don't still bear a grudge against you, because I do... ...but your client didn't happen to be a skinless saber-toothed tiger... ...or composed entirely of light, maybe? Light came out of his chest. - How did you know? - A pattern. That's three. - He's killing the Ra-Tet. GWEN: What's that? A mystical order. Each totem representing a stage in Ra's journey across the sky. Here's your client. Two others, these... ...are dead. That means there's two totems left. Manjet and Semkhet. The last sighting of Manjet was rumored two years ago in Belize. And Semkhet is said to live in a cave in Death Valley. Then that's easy. All we have to do is find Semkhet and protect him. LORNE: Well, won't that be a hoot. Looks like Semkhet is puddy-tat to the world's scariest 6-year-old. - It could be dangerous. - I'll take Gwen. Gee, I feel all warm inside. - Shouldn't we all go...? - We can handle it. The super powers? I'll catch her up on the drive. It's a four-hour trip. Both ways. I'm sure we'll find something to talk about. GWEN: Jeez! Where were you when they taught stealth in super-power school? - I did that on purpose. - That's pretty pathetic. If it's a lie or if it's the truth? - Aren't we here to protect this thing? - We are, unless it's evil. I say if it is, we prevent the Beast from killing it by killing it ourselves. So much for protecting it. Looks like it was ripped apart. Charring around the edges. This is definitely our guy. The Beast is systematically executing these totems. - Just don't know why. MAN: I do. He's gonna turn out the sun. What are you doing here? Standing in the remains of my fallen brethren... ...trying not to have an anxiety attack. - Who are you two? - I'm Angel, that's Gwen. - You got a name? - I am Manjet... ...Sacred Guardian of the Shen, Keeper of the Orb of Ma'at... ...and Devotee of Light. Off hours, I like Manny. - You're Manjet? - Right. - The last totem of the Ra-Tet? - Right. - I thought you were in Belize. - Was, till I heard Mesektet got whacked. Never liked that chick. Evil, right down to her Mary Janes. But family... What are you gonna do? What did you mean? The Beast is gonna "turn out the sun"? - Is that a metaphor? - Sorry, I don't speak "college boy." I said what I meant. This Beast you're talking about... ...he's looking for a way to put an end to daylight. He wants to blot out the sun permanently. So once the totems are dead, the sun disappears? Not disappears, exactly. And it's not just killing us either. There's props and a ritual and a chant and a thing and a... Suffice to say, it ain't easy. And folks in the Ra-Tet, they got some serious juice... ...which is why I never felt worried before. - But you're worried now. - Well, there's four out of five down. Let's just say I'm not looking forward to my retirement in Boca. So the lights go out. Then what? The city sinks into never-ending darkness, that's what. Vamps, creepies, crawlies. Things that go bump in the night are suddenly bumping 24/7. - The whole of Los Angeles turns into a... - A demon playground. Bingo. And that's before it starts to spread. California, North America. Eventually... ...hello, global blackout. The world is the devil's oyster. - Well, we gotta stop him. - You sure do. And good luck with that. Whoa, whoa. Where do you think you're going? Look, it's probably just a few hours till this guy catches up with me. I wanna spend my last moments with my oldest, dearest friends down at... ...the Pink Pony Lounge. I'll buy you a lap dance if I can watch. Forget that. We can take you somewhere safe. - We can protect you. - Right. Super Hunk and Spandexia. This thing takes out Mesektet, and you two are gonna protect me? I don't see anybody else lined up for the job. You think she'd give me a lap dance? - Any movement from the Beast? - Not a peep. Just trying to find ways to kill him. Which, by the way, there aren't any. That doesn't look like Semkhet. Semkhet's not available, sweetheart. Slight case of being... ...ripped open to death in a cave. Don't suppose I could interest you in a short, stocky orb-keeper? Guys, I'd like you to meet Manny... ...the last totem of the Ra-Tet. This... ...is a being of supreme power? - You ought to see me in my Armani. What happened to the second-to-last one? Somebody already ripped out the toy surprise. Good news is, we discovered the Beast's plan. - Which is? - To blot out the sun for all of eternity. - You guys got a john? - Right back there. Thanks, pal. Why did the small, yucky man say that? He's joking, right? Apparently there's a ritual using members of the Ra-Tet... ...to change day into night. Forever. As far as evil plans go, it doesn't suck. ANGEL: He's killed four of the five so far. I figure we keep Manny safe, the lights stay on long enough... ...and we find a way to defeat the thing. But where are we gonna hide him? We need a small, controlled space. - Secure the perimeter, guards at all times. - Kitchen's got a meat locker. Brilliant. Store the one thing that'll stave off perpetual darkness... ...in the home of the people the demon knows. You know what? You got a better idea, Einstein? Give me time. - I know a place. CORDELIA: Great. As long as it's not some nondescript tenement downtown... ...with discarded boxes in the stairwells and peeling plaster and... The faint odor of dead people. You didn't have to come if you didn't want to. But what if I have another vision? Better I be with you, right? Rather be here than at the hotel, plowing through annoying books... ...with the "symbolic manifestos" and the "Brilliant!" MANNY: Never trust the books or the bookies, kid. Real juju takes place on the q.t. That's why you can't find this Beast. He's too powerful. - I mean, taking out the Ra-Tet... GUNN: Speaking of... ...ain't you Tet folks supposed to be all mighty and colossal? "The midday totem is man. The neutral totem. The potential of every human soul." So you're just a guy, then? There's more to me than meets the eye. For example, I'm immortal. Unless I'm ritually murdered, of course. Well, it's too bad we came here, then. Because if you're gonna be ritually murdered, it'll probably be in a hellhole... ...like this. Come on in. My butler's already in Tahiti, so we're on our own here. I'll hit the kitchen for supplies later, if I can just, well, find the kitchen. The Axis of Pythia, that thing I used to find you on the higher plane? It's worth $33 million. I gave it back to Gwen when I was done. Let's get you set up in the study. I never pass up a good clich<i>e</i>. It's a panic room too. Twelve inches of solid steel, its own ventilation system. Homey. You should be safe here. Don't worry, I ain't expecting any miracles. So, guard duty. What do you think? You and me, first shift? Wouldn't it make more sense to split up? One super power per shift? That way, if horn boy shows up, we mortals might stand a chance. - Makes sense to me. - Okay, then, I'll take Denzel. GUNN: Actually, it's "Gunn." Not that I mind the freakishly accurate comparison. But keep your hands to yourself. Four hours on, four off. Bunk down off-duty, get as much sleep as we can. We're already tired. Got a long few days ahead of us. Hey, Gwen, don't suppose this joint's got Skinemax? GWEN: So then after the second gardener and the fourth nanny... ...I got sent to the Academy. Something tells me my origin story isn't enough to fascinate you. Oh, no, it is. I was just... Just thinking. Gunn, I already apologized for killing you. What more do you want, a wake? It isn't that. Then it's the English guy, isn't it? I saw the way he looked at your girl. A good thief is a master of body language. He starts talking with his body, he's gonna have a serious problem. I'm surprised. A few months ago, she was ready to wear sackcloth and ashes for you. When did the landscape change? Long story. [DOOR OPENS] - How's Manny? GUNN: Fine. Gave him some magazines to keep him occupied. Swimsuit edition. He's occupied. Come on. Show you where you can crash. So all this time alone together... ...could be good for us. Maybe we should talk. Maybe we shouldn't. Valid point. Angel, get up. Cordy. Cordy, come on, snap out of it. Jeez! I'm awake. What are you doing, falling asleep on watch? - I wasn't... - What's happening? ...asleep. Manny. - It got him. - Ugh, You think? So was that one of Manny's powers? Extra blood and guts? Because, I mean, that's a lot of blood and guts in there. No way all that came out of a normal guy. That was the Beast. It was looking for something Manny had. How do you know? Emptied out his head to find it. Ugh. Wait. Manny said he was an orb-keeper, right? Maybe he kept an orb. - In his head? - Where do you keep yours? ANGEL: Hold on a second. - She's right. - Of course. Semkhet, the demon in the cave. You said someone already pulled out the toy surprise. Did I? It's pulling something out of these totems. And you knew that. Something you're not telling me, Gwen? All right. My client? The Beast grabbed something out of him too. A little, metal boxy thing. You neglected to mention this fact. I thought the box might be worth something. Look, the apocalypse was coming, there was a giant killer demon. I panicked. I'm still a thief, and as a rule, we don't share information. GUNN: Okay, what about this cave demon? Think the big ugly went hunting inside of him? - It's definitely possible. - Yes. But what's impossible is thinking that somehow, some way... ...the Beast found where we were hiding... ...spiked the drinks we made ourselves... ...snuck through this unreasonably large apartment... ...on the tippy-toes of his cloven feet, right up to the vault... ...and killed poor Manny, unseen and unheard. Maybe whoever did it didn't have cloven feet. "The answer is among you." I can't be the only one thinking it. Don't be ridiculous. Connor doesn't even know where we are. - You didn't call him? - He doesn't have a phone. I can't believe you'd... Even if she didn't call him, that boy can track anybody, anywhere. I'd know if he'd been here. I'd be able to smell him. Same way you smelled whatever it was spiking your blood? This is impossible. I thought we were pretty clear on the whole "impossible" issue. Unseen and unheard. The security cameras. Got them in every room. We've just gotta rewind the tapes. In the meantime, call the hotel, tell them about Manny. Tell them about the toy surprises too. Let's find out what they're for... ...and how we stop the Beast from using them. Angel, about Connor... Check it out later, like we do every other lead. Go. CORDELIA: What's that? - That's nothing. The tapes go blank. It's like the electrics got cut. Let me check the system log. - You have to talk to him, Angel. - Who, Gunn? I just did. Connor, you dolt. And you know who I meant, so why push my buttons? Maybe because it's nice to make you crazy for a change. You can't seriously think he did it, when there are other, more liar-like suspects. Well, so far, he's the only one who's got a connection to the Beast. I've got the origin of the blackout. It kicked off in a small subset of the municipal A-14 grid. That's the one under this block. - About 10 minutes before your watch. - What does that mean? That somebody knew when you'd take over that watch... ...and somebody knew whose drinks to spike. - This is an inside job. - Funny how you were inside at the time. Enough. Let's just focus on the guy trying to blot out the sun. We'll point fingers later. It never would have happened on my watch. Gosh, no. Because you're Super Tramp. - What's the latest? - I checked out the ritual like you asked. Looks like there's some assembly required. Turns out these three pieces were inside the totems. Beast kills the totems, yanks out the pieces... ...and builds himself a big, old light switch. Well, what about the other two? What'd he take out of them? He sucked the energy out of the little girl... ...and he ripped the heart out of the shaman... ...but what's not clear is how he's gonna use them. These wings. They're metal, right? Get me close enough, and I can melt them. - That'll slow him down. - Lf we find him in time. He's already got all the pieces. Plus, we don't know where he'll perform this ritual. I'm not worried about slowing him down. I'm worried about taking him out. We may have a solution. We've done a lot of research, and we think we've found a way... ...to get rid of the Beast. A portal. Figures. We've tried conventional methods: Firearms, the usual weaponry. None of which seem to work. If we stand against it long enough and corner it, maneuver it into position... We could send this thing to the hell sweet hell it came from. - I know what you're thinking. - That we should've learned our lesson? Wesley and I have decided this is our only option. I know, but I don't gotta like it. Okay, so we've got everything we need to stop the ritual. Let's clear out of here and try to locate the Beast. [GASPS] Oh, my God. Another vision? The same one, only there was more of it. A massacre. So many people on the ground... ...dead, dying. The screaming was so loud. ANGEL: Did you hear the demon? No. But whoever he was talking to, they felt familiar. Like someone I know. Connor. I think it's time we bring him into this, Angel. If nothing else, he's our best chance at finding the Beast. [KNOCKING] Hello, Connor. Ah! - Oh, my God, Connor! - Angel. - What happened? - The Beast! It's upstairs. - Maybe it needs to do the ritual... - Where Connor lives. - Everybody gear up. Got everything? - Ready. Gwen, go for the orb or the wings. We can't let him finish the spell. Gunn, you and I'll keep the Beast busy so Fred and Wesley... ...can work the portal mojo. Cordy! Keep him safe. Dad. It's okay, Connor. I'm here now. Let's go. [CASTS A SPELL] FRED: He's already started. I should be up there. I can fight it. Don't worry, Connor. I'm sure they're doing okay. [CHANTING] The orb, don't let it... [GASPS] You are a worthy adversary. Oh, no. [CASTS A SPELL] - Angel. ANGEL: Yeah, I got it. Everybody get ready. What's it like when you pass out? What? Things get dimmer, right? I guess. What...? Now or never. We did it. Didn't we? [GASPS] But our strength is useless divided. Why is it still getting dark? BEAST: I told you once... ...you need not be my enemy. Join with me... ...Angelus. "The answer is among you." BEAST: We'll meet again. Soon. My God. The sun, it's gone. Completely obliterated. [DOOR OPENS] Angel, we have to talk. - I can't believe we lost the sun. - Angel, I think I've figured it out. So have I. The Beast knows me. No, it doesn't. It knows Angelus. Am I right? While you were upstairs, it came to me. I wasn't having a vision of the demon, I was having a memory of it. How's that again? When I was a higher being, I experienced everything you'd ever done as Angelus. But since I've been back, my memory's been fading... ...until The Powers decided to jog it, I guess. Angel, I saw you long ago, standing in a field of bodies with the Beast. You knew this thing, and you didn't tell us? No. I couldn't come up against something like that and not remember. "The answer is among you." That's what the little girl meant, isn't it? This was not about Connor. It's about... Angelus. I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast. I'd remember. Like you remember falling asleep before Manny got killed? - What? - An inside job. - What's that supposed to mean? WESLEY: It means you're a suspect. If Cordelia's right, we should admit the possibility... ...this Beast may have some power over you. To make you do things, to make you forget. And he has a plan. The rain of fire, taking down Wolfram and Hart, even blotting out the sun... ...I think now those were only the first steps to something bigger. I don't know what to say, because I don't know what the plan is. No. But Angelus might. There's only one way we're gonna defeat this Beast. We need Angelus.
