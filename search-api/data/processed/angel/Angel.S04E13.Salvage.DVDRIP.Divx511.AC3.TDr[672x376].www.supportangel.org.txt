even blotting out the sun... ... those were only the first steps to something bigger. We need Angelus. GUNN: Taking out Angel's soul, putting it in a jar. Hope we know what we're doing. CORDELIA: Angelus. He's dangerous. ANGELUS: Which is worse, Wes? Stealing my kid like you did, or banging him like Cordelia? There's something bigger. Something worse. The Beast has a boss. This humble token I offer, forged of my unworthy bones. CORDELIA: Angel's soul, it's gone. GUNN: She shows up after Angel's soul is missing. I can bring him back. I know how to re-ensoul Angel. [GRUNTS] CORDELIA: Well, it worked. Sing for Lorne, to prove it's really you. [SINGING] - It's him. It's Angel. - You're not Angelus. [GASPS] Guess again. Angelus might think we want to capture him. I think that's not an option anymore. - His scent ends here. - He doubled back. [SCREAMS] - He's gonna kill us. - I know. Why do you think I let him out? [SIGHS] Well, that's no fun. Lilah? Oh, jeez, fellas, this isn't what it looks like. A little too tart for me anyway. You know what I mean, Wes? Catch you later. [YELLS] - Is she okay? - She's lost a lot of blood. - Where's Angelus? - Gone. He killed Lilah. Oh, God. It's started. Salvage What are we waiting for? - Why aren't we going after him? - No need. He'll be back. How do you know? We're the ones he wants to hurt. The people closest to Angel. I say we dust him before he gets a chance. That kind of reckless thinking is what allowed Angelus to double back on us... ...giving him the chance to... From now on, we all stay close. And do what? If Angelus is coming back for us, we can't just be waiting for him to drop by. We need to do something. Board up the windows, make it safe somehow. - Don't you think? - Won't make a difference. If he wants in, nothing's gonna stop him. Birth of a notion, kids. We use the sanctuary spell. That anti-demon-violence charm I used down at Karitas? It won't keep Angelus from coming back... ...but it'll keep carnage down to a minimum. - That takes some doing. - I could call the Furies. They could walk me through a quickie version. Magic again. You people rely way too much on that junk. We use whatever tools we have. Yeah, only it never really works the way it's supposed to. That's why we're here, isn't it? Why he's loose? Cordy, why didn't it work? The spell to bring Angel's soul back. - Did we do something wrong? - I don't know. How'd you get so fooled, Lorne? Reading Angelus wrong like that. You were so sure he was Angel. Don't put this on him. I'm the one who let Angelus out. It's my fault. - It's nobody's fault. - I'll tell you whose fault it is. Powers that sit on their behind, sending us useless messages. We have to destroy her. What? The body, she could've been turned. Sired, you mean? No, there wasn't enough time. - You don't know that. - Hell, I don't. - It happened too... - No, he's right. We can't take any chances. I'll take care of it. [MUSIC PLAYS] [GROWLS] [LAUGHING] [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey. - Isn't that...? - Yeah. That's right, brothers and sisters, the rumors are true. Angel has left the building, and I am back. Welcome back. But, hey, I'm no different than the next guy. I put my victim's skin on one leg at a time. - Angelus, remember me? - Not really. Oh, come on. A little town outside Tuscany, 1845. Give or take. - Rosaria. - Rosaria. Yeah. Flew in with some of my friends... ...when we heard about the permanent midnight. A bunch of us are gonna raid a preschool later. You wanna join us? Have a little kiddie...? [SCREAMS] Everybody wants a piece of you. I'm looking for The Beast. A guy told me you know where he hangs his horns. You're him. Talking to me. Not usually impressed by vampires, but this is such an honor. Hey, could you sign a little something for my hell spawn? Make it out to Ashley. She's a beautiful little... Oh! Maybe some other time, huh? Where is The Beast? I don't know, I swear. I seen him, The Beast. Seen him a couple of times. Down by the buildings by the wash. Show me. Why so glum? It is kind of what you wanted, isn't it? I mean, deep down. Me out of the picture. Utterly, finally. You can't get out-er than this. Makes your life simpler, doesn't it? - Cleaner? - I didn't want this. Come on, what are you worried about, Wesley? You hated yourself for being with me. Or maybe you just hated yourself for loving being with me. Hey, semantics. In any case, we both knew sooner or later it would come to a messy end. For one of us, anyway. So ease up on that furrowed brow. You're free now. No longer encumbered with the secret shame of our relationship. It wasn't a relationship. There's a signed dollar bill in your wallet I think proves different. - You knew how I felt. - You don't feel. - The only true thing I ever... - You didn't love me. You couldn't. We'll never know now, will we? Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is the place. Right? You saw the thing, I didn't. - Where was The Beast headed? - I can't remember, man. Try remembering harder, Paco. I was trying to steer clear of the mammoth. You know what I'm saying. Listen to what I'm saying. I don't have time to... Hey. Hey, man, you want we should come with? All right, we'll just stay here. - You made him nervous! Damn. - Me? LORNE: Mm-hm. Yeah, okay. All right, well, not so fast, girls. Yeah, one at a time. Yeah, okay. "Violence restrained." Go on. That's everything we could find. - They say we need bloodroot. - Bloodroot? We just raided the spice rack in the kitchen. No bloodroot there. Uh, eighty-six on the bloodroot, ladies. Anything else we can...? Well, yeah, I have paprika, ginger... ...allspice, cloves... Cloves? That'll work? Got it. Beautiful. As soon as FTD is delivering in the city again... ...expect a big "Thanks a Bunch" bouquet from me, girls. <i>Ciao</i>. Sounds like we've got our home security spell. Right you are, missy. Soon as we sprinkle burnt clove dust on the perimeter... ...light a few candles, and cant a few choice phrases, we'll be... Hurry up and do it. Sooner we quit playing with magic tricks, sooner we find and kill Angelus. Wesley says we shouldn't go after him. I don't give a flying sluk what Wesley says. He's not my boss. Where the hell is he, anyway? How long does it take to chop off Lilah's head? Boss or no, he's right when he says... ...we stay together till we know what to do. I know what we have to do. Angel told me. Something goes wrong, I kill him. Oh, now you listen to him. Aren't we forgetting something? Angel's soul is still out there somewhere. There's still a chance we could bring him back. How many people have to die before we give up that plan? CORDELIA: I don't know, Connor. How many people have to die without Angel around to save them? It's way too late for that. I've seen his true face. And he's tasted blood. There's no going back now. He has to be destroyed. And I'm the destroyer. Connor, don't do this. It's too dangerous. Come back. You can't... [SIGHS] FRED: Cordy! GUNN: Get her to the couch. - What happened? - You fainted. You mean like this? - All right, let's get her upstairs. - I'll do it. We're not gonna be able to stop him. - Angelus? - Connor. First chance that boy gets, he's gonna kill Angelus. Yeah, more likely die trying. Trouble is, we can't keep that boy in check. Yeah, well, Angel aside, who could? [SHOUTING] 4-3-0-0-1-9, coming out! [BUZZING] [GATE OPENING] [SHOUTING] [GRUNTING] Okay, you got my attention. What's your beef, Deb? You really ought to think twice. Or not. Nothing personal. I need the money. - For the nose job? - Break it up. Come on, come on. Self-defense. She attacked me, Eddie. Yeah, I saw the whole thing. Come on, get her to the infirmary. - Wait, you saw? - Hey, caught us by surprise. I mean, who'd be crazy enough to try to take you out? LILAH: I know what it is. The reason you're having such a hard time with this. Why you're taking so long to, you know: [MAKES HACKING SOUND] The awful truth? You couldn't save me. - And this is the exclamation point. - Saved you from The Beast. For all the good it did. Wesley, you know that's not what I'm talking about. You couldn't save me from me. Is that what you thought? Me. Lover, I'm not even here. I'm just a figment in your devilishly handsome head. So clearly, it's what you thought. For all your supposed darkness, edge-of-the-razor mystique... ...there was always a small part of you... ...that thought you could pull me back from the brink of my evil, evil ways. Help me find redemption. Redemption. Angel's influence, I suppose. The whole "not giving up on someone no matter how far he or she has fallen." Oh, well. Too late for me. So let's just get it over with. That body's not gonna dismember itself, you know. I'm sorry, Lilah. No, Wes, we don't have that word in our vocabulary. Not people like you and... [WHISTLING] [LAUGHS] This how you treat an old friend? Kill the chick I was chasing... ...then lure me here with the scent of her blood. We were never friends, Angelus. I know. But calling you a "big, dumb hunk of rock" seemed a little on the nose. Come on, man, I'm teasing. It's been, what, couple hundred years? You still want to kick my ass? It's true, I long to crush your skull, but I didn't bring you here to fight. - That wasn't my instruction. - Your instruction. My master has requested you. Your master. Nice workmanship. Did you make this in shop for Daddy? Don't touch that. Sorry. I can see you put a lot of yourself into it. So, the attack on Angel Investigations, rain of fire, blotting out the sun... Stealing your soul. All designed by my master... ...to bring forth and keep Angelus. Well, hell of a plan. Real big-picture thinking. So when can I meet the big brain behind my liberation? In time. For now, you will take your orders through me. Or here's a better idea. No, I won't. Tell your boss I'm grateful for the attention... ...but I don't take grocery lists from the messenger boy. I will teach you respect. Look, you may have played those suckers at Angel, Inc... ...but I don't like having my strings yanked. And I don't like being kept in the dark. Figuratively, anyway. And if your boss was half as smart as he thinks he is... ...he knows I won't take orders from a lackey. What, you don't like "lackey"? Well, how about "toady"? Or "lickspittle." Come on, lickspittle's nice. Oh, wait, I got it. "Flunky." That's it. You're just a big, stupid, butt-ugly... ...slow-moving flunky. Rocky, if that's all you got, you better throw in the towel and call it a night. When the Beastmaster's ready to peek out from behind your skirt... ...have him give me a call. Well, you handled that brilliantly. He's not to be trusted. What about you? Letting him bait you into a fight like that. I haven't spent all this time and energy... ...so you can mess it all up with your petty jealousies. You know Angelus is crucial to my plan. My apologies, my master. You need patience. He'll come around when he sees what I have to offer. And if he doesn't, you can pull off his head and tear him to bits. Now... ...give Mama some sugar. LORNE: "Violence restrained, demons disarmed. For mortals within these walls, no harm. Protection and safety this charm doth endow... ...to make this shelter a sanctuary now." That it? Well, if we followed the recipe... ...should be cake. A demon-violence-free-zone cake. I don't know, Lorne, doesn't feel like anything's different. Because it's not. Like every other lame spell you people try, it didn't work. It never works. I pretty much concluded that magic sucks. I mean, if I were you guys, I would... [GRUNTS] See? It works sometimes. It also smarts like the dickens. - Sanctuary spell's working? - Yeah, like a charm. Literally. - Good. It'll make this easier. - Make what easier? - Where's Cordelia? - Upstairs asleep. She still feels weak. Make what easier? - We're gonna bring Angelus in alive. - No, we're not. Thought you said capturing him wasn't an option. - Changed my mind. - Change it back. We get rid of Angelus, then what? We still have a Beast we don't know how to kill. We know it's working for something much worse, but we don't know what. We're caught in the middle of a maelstrom... ...and we can't get out without our champion. We're gonna save Angel. And I know who we need to help us do it. They told me my lawyer was here to see me. You my lawyer now, Wes? Hello, Faith. - How are you? - Still alive. Never thought I'd live to see you paying me a visit. A lot's happened. Whatever it is suits you. I mean, you're looking good. - You know what's going on in L.A. - Seen the news, sure. Never-ending night, rain of fire. Team Angel must really have their hands full. You don't know the half of it. But you're here to fill in the blanks for me. Why? We need you. Well, I hate to wet the paper for you, Wes... ...but I'm kind of unavailable right now. Maybe you wanna check back in a few decades when my parole comes up. - You need to know... - It's Armageddon again. I dig. Last thing you need is me in the mix. Besides, Angel will come shining through in the end like he always does. Angel's gone, Faith. Angelus is back. Step away from the glass. [CAR ALARM GOES OFF] - You okay? - Five-by-five. FAITH: A kid, Angel's got a kid. WESLEY: Connor. A teenage kid, born last year. I told you, he grew up in a hell dimension. Right. And, what, Cordelia spent her last summer as...? A divine being. Uh-huh. Can I just ask, what the hell are you people doing? Leading complicated lives, obviously. Unleashing Angelus to help you stop this demon who put the lights out. - That's just... - The Beast. The demon who put out the lights, called The Beast. Gas to the flame, that's all I'm saying. I wouldn't worry about the police coming after you. Not yet. With everything that's happening... ...an escaped convict won't register on their radar. I'm not gonna kill him, Wesley. Angelus. Angel's the only one in my life who's never given up on me. There's no way... I know. That's why it had to be you. - I'm just wondering if you're up to it. - Lf I'm...? You have no idea what it's like out there. It's a vampire, demon free-for-all all the time. Maybe you're a little rusty. Maybe I am. Maybe we should find out. Well, what did you have in...? [GROWLING] Ah... She's the one you want. Slayer. [YELLING] Thought you could use a little release. Feel natural? Eh, it's like riding a biker. LORNE: Relax, boys, the spell's working. I've still got the slight migraine to prove it. Yeah, but if Angelus shows up, I wanna be ready. WESLEY: We are... ...now. Sweet crib. Everyone, this is Faith the vampire slayer. Hello, Faith. I'm... Fred. Yeah, Wes kind of gave me the skinny on you. Oh. CORDELIA: Faith? - What the hell is she doing here? - Nice to see you too, Cor. - She's here to help. - Oh, gee, that's great. Oh, wait a sec, wasn't she convicted of murder... ...and sent to a correctional facility for, like, a gazillion years? Murder two, 25 to life, for the record. So now you brought psycho-slayer out of retirement to kill Angelus? You have every right to feel that way about me. You have no reason to trust me. But I don't have loads of time, so why don't we save it till after this is over. Okay, let's get down to it. We're gonna keep this hunting party tight. - Gunn, right? - Yeah. Love the name. Hear you're a good fighter. - I hold my own. - That's a shame. You're with me, Wes and the kid. The kid has a name. Connor. Arm yourself how you like. I want you to carry the tranq. If I can't take him down, I want you to be ready to take the shot. In case anyone has any other ideas, this is a salvage mission... ...not search and destroy. Okay? No, not okay. You think you can just breeze in here, telling everyone what to do? If you think I'm not gonna kill Angelus if he comes at me, then... Listen up, junior. When I need a bloodhound, I'll call you. If Angelus needs putting down, I'll be the one to do it, not you. So is there anything else you're not okay with? Good. Show me the weapons. [SCREAMS] Help me. It's all right now. I've got you. - I don't know how to thank you. - I do. Scream for me. VAMPIRE: Slayer? You sure? Just got word. She's in town. Hi, Dawn. Yeah, it's me. Is your sister home? She is? It's the other one. So, vampire slayers. I was told about them. How come you're always girls? I don't know. Better at it, I guess. - Haven't seen what I can do. - Let's not. He was here. Just. FAITH: Eyes and ears peeled. Watch the periph. Hey, nobody make a move until l... [YELLS] You deficient? What did I just say? - He was attacking. - You thought it was Angelus. Can't listen, you're no good to me. Someone take him back to the hotel. What? The kid's got a history of not doing what he's told. - He'll do what I tell him. - Yeah, sure I will. [GRUNTING] I get it, you're a super-being. Are you a murderer? Because I am. And if it comes down to you or Angelus... ...you haven't shown me a thing to make me want to take your side. I like her. Come on. - Do you know where we're going? - Not especially. How do you expect to find Angelus without Connor? The old-fashioned way. The kid's not the only tracker. Something will turn up. A trail of bodies. A telltale clue. Maybe a carpet fiber. So much for the element of surprise. We'll have to come at him from two sides. You take low. I'll hit him high. [GRUNTS] Pretty ballsy, mister. Creeping around my buddy Angelus. Come on, pretty boy. Our buddy. ANGELUS: Hey, Faith, nice to see you again. You're looking choice as ever. Oh, that's right. We've never really met, have we? So, what are you waiting for? Come out and give me a kiss. No, no, no. You come to me. That's it. Getting warmer. Warmer. Warmer. You're smoking hot. But then again, you probably knew that. Honey, I brought a guest home for dinner. [LAUGHING] Let's eat. - What is this, Angelus? - This is a slayer. Say hi to the nice Beast, Faith. You dare to bring a slayer here? Hey, I'm doing you a favor, Stonehenge. She's here to seriously mess up you and your boss's plans. So the question is: What do you do, hotshot? What do you do? Smile, Faith. Thought you'd enjoy a threesome. Sure. Let's get it on. Oo-wee! Watch yourself, big guy. Girl's on fire. Ooh. That's gonna sting in the morning. Nice. [GRUNTING] ANGELUS: Come on, Faithy. You're not even trying. Better get up. You know, somebody should break this up. This is all you are? I had heard the slayer possessed great strength. But there's no real power here. My master's power is beyond all limits. Beyond your petty imagining. You are weak. You're nothing. You could not even defeat me. Ain't that the truth. I mean, look at this guy. Pretty much the only thing that could do damage to that thick, stony hide... ...is himself. Or maybe, I don't know, maybe a piece of himself. [ROARS] I knew it. I knew it! [YELLING] Faith. Oh, crap. You mean killing The Beast really does bring back the sun? I thought that was Angel's retarded fantasy. [GROANING] Oh, well, what are you gonna do? Take the bad with the good, I always say. Anyhow, I just wanted Beastie Boy here to soften you up. I like my meat nice and tender. [GRUNTS] Ooh! A swing and a miss, slugger. Sorry, but... God. [LAUGHING] Okay. Well, I gotta give you props. Nice move, really. We'll just have to take a rain check on that whole "eviscerating you" thing. Just you and me now, Faithy. Catch you later. Check it out. We got sun. Well, ding-dong, The Beast is dead. I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. Where are the others? Yeah, let's hear the war stories. How'd you bring that monster down? It wasn't us, not Connor and me. She must've fought it. Faith. Beast must've attacked her, and she must... It's gotta be. - Hey, where's Cordy? Does she know? - She's up in her room. Hey, what about Angelus? If that girl can take out The Beast... ...my money says she'll have Angelus hog-tied and back here by dinnertime. Hey, isn't it incredible? It's wonderful. She did it. Faith. She's... ...amazing. - Connor... - I had no idea what a slayer could do. A weakness for slayers. You're definitely his son. Connor... ...we need... There's something you need to... I don't know how... Well, I know how, but... What? What is it? We're having a baby. Touch it. This... It's impossible. How could...? All I know is, there's a life growing inside of me, and it's ours. We're connected now. You and me... ...forever.
