right under my beak? GUNN: You're a Power that was? ANGEL: <i>We're saved.</i> CONNOR: <i>She's amazing.</i> LORNE: <i>Eternal bliss.</i> WESLEY: <i>Tell us what to do.</i> FRED: You're hurt. I scrubbed till my fingers bled, but I couldn't get out... JASMINE: Fred? I can't believe Fred's evil. We'll find Fred, but not tonight. Tomorrow will be easier than today. Good morning, Los Angeles. Thank you for inviting me. WESLEY: <i>If she's out there,</i> she's a threat. We have to kill her. [THUD] MOTORIST: What...? - All right, now I'm getting mad. - We'll find her. We'll do a lot worse than just find her. There! WESLEY: Sorry. - Your jacket... - A woman just gave it to me. She said Jasmine wanted me to have it. Isn't that sweet? Isn't Jasmine the best? - Jasmine's the best. - She's wonderful. We should split up. She can't be far. Magic Bullet [CHATTERING] LORNE: I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do, really. Next. - I'm too late, aren't I, for a room? - Yeah, afraid so, buckaroo. Singles, suites, even mouseholes are booked. Pilgrims are pitching tents in the parking lot. Try saying that three times fast, and you'll get a sense of the day I'm having. I'll give you my house if I can stay. It's nice. There's a pool. Sorry. It doesn't work that way around here, partner. Jasmine doesn't want your things, and neither do I. I just want to be near her, you know? I saw her on the news last night... ...and I want to say thanks for making me feel... Preaching to the choir. I thought Our Lady of the Perpetual Seabreeze was the real deal... ...till the divine Miss J. Walked right through that door and into my ass. Which is where my heart is. Physiologically. I could show you an x-ray. [CROWD GASPS] Hey, don't be shy, Slim Jim. Go get some of that gorgeous goodness. Hello, and thank you all for coming. [IN MANDARIN] [SPEAKS IN MANDARIN] ANGEL: How do you do that? Mandarin's not tough when you've been around a zillion years. No, how is it that you always know exactly what each person needs to hear? Just look into their hearts. Or sometimes it's right on their face. - Senor. MAN: <i>Si?</i> [IN SPANISH] Gracias. Muchas gracias. - I wish I could see what you see. - You will. [DOOR OPENS] JASMINE: Hello. My love is all around you. Will you excuse us for a moment? - This close, and she pulled a Houdini. - What's a Houdini? She escaped. Fred's obviously learned a trick or two here at Angel Inc. But we'll catch her. - I'll find her. Bring back her scalp. - No. Jasmine wants her alive. Right. Fred lives until we understand why she rejected Jasmine's love. - Why would anybody reject love? - Because she has a history of doing that. Whatever the reason is, we have to find her... ...so Jasmine can straighten her out. Would you like to come with me? And you, my friend, will you join us? Yes. Thank you. Bless you all for coming. Think she'll ever pick us? If we're lucky. But not before we find Fred. Um, hi. You probably don't remember me. Three days ago. Mass hypnosis. You wondered if it was possible. I read those books. Some whacko theories, by the way. All of the mass hypnosis theories seem highly flawed to me. I'm looking for mind control that could affect everyone across the board. I might have a book on that. FRED: Astral Projections. Satan 's Dictionary? You must get some pretty colorful customers in here. Used to. You're the only customer I had since last time you were here. Oh. No demand for photo books of serial killer autopsies... ...when you're living in a utopian wonderland. You know what I mean? I hadn't really thought... Must be hard. Hard? Are you kidding? It's great. Great? Really? Yeah. Look at me. I've never been happier. Sure. I see it now. You're practically glowy. I was flicking through the radio the other night. There's nothing really good on since Art Bell retired. But ended up listening to this woman talk. Jasmine. Yeah. You too, huh? What a breath of fresh air she is. I listened for almost an hour. I'm a new man. I used to be obsessed with mind control, read everything I could get my hands on. And you don't believe in it anymore? I believe. I just don't worry about it anymore. So you don't worry that it's possible for someone to send out... ...a biological or electronic trigger that overrides your own sense of ideals... ...and replaces them with an alternative agenda... ...that reduces you to little more than a mindless meat-puppet? Wow. People used to think that I was paranoid. I mean, don't get me wrong. I've still got the implants in my head. The CIA is still listening in. It just doesn't bother me anymore. Instead, I beam Jasmine's love up to their satellite. Share the love with those MK-ULTRA bastards. That'll teach them. Hey. Now I get it. - You do? - Yeah. I know what you're doing. You want to fight fire with fire. Make sure the government and the other savages learn about Jasmine's love. Exactly. That's exactly right. Why should we be the only shiny, happy people? We don't need to use the evil tools of "the man"... ...when we have "the woman." We need to trust that Jasmine's love will reach the world just like it reached us. Oh, happy day. CONNOR: She's been down here. How old were you when you realized you could track like this? I don't know, 5, 6. Didn't exactly celebrate birthdays in Quor-toth. Holtz made up a game so I could practice. Oh, you mean he'd hide things for you to find? Kind of. He'd tie me to a tree and then run away. What? You know, so I'd have to escape and then find him. - One time it only took me five days. - Five days? He abandoned you and...? Connor, that's terrible. That's... Why I'm so good at tracking. Fred rested here for a while. CONNOR AND ANGEL: Jasmine wants us back at the hotel. JASMINE: Before the time of man... ... great beings walked the Earth. Untold power emanated from all quarters. I sound like the prologue to one of those movies about magical dwarves. - Hobbits. And you watch movies? - I love movies. Well then, you should know this is the greatest story ever told. Sweet. The site will be ready in a couple days. Let me know when you want it online. Soon. I don't understand why you don't go into a TV studio... ...say "Scoot over, Regis" and sweet-talk your love to the world. It's not time yet. There's still a lot I have to learn. [KNOCKING] Come in. ANGEL: You called us. CONNOR: How'd you do that? - We felt it. - We're all becoming connected. All of us. And now that you're all here, I want to test that connection. - We're going to find Fred. - Isn't that what we've been trying to do? This is different. No more running around town. Everybody join hands. I can't do this alone. Not yet. I want you all to close your eyes. Now, picture Fred. Picture what she looks like. Her face. Her big brown eyes. The way she styles her hair. The clothes she likes to wear. The sound of her voice. What she looks like when she smiles. Now concentrate. Where are you, Fred? I'm looking for you. FRED: 219. WOMAN: Sure. Here you go. Thanks. I see her. I see Fred. [CHATTERING] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] There's nowhere to run, dear. My love is all around you. Fred, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, Fred. Ow! - Lorne, a chair! LORNE: What happened? CONNOR: Her hand got hot. - She's badly burned. - Call a doctor. No, no. I'll be fine. I just need to rest. - We should get you a doctor. - I'm fine. I saw Fred, clear as I'm seeing you. Obviously, there's some painful kinks to work out, but it's a start. - She got away, didn't she? - Yes. But don't worry. Everybody who loves me now knows what she looks like... ...knows to catch her, knows to call us. There's no place Fred can hide. - What do you want us to do? - You already know. She's right. There's work to do here. We have a hotel full of people... ...people who have needs. Know what they say about people who need people. They're the luckiest people in the world. You sneaking peeks at my Streisand collection again? - Just kind of popped out. JASMINE: This is what I'm talking about. Everything is becoming connected, the same way I saw Fred. - Are you saying we're becoming psychic? - No. What I'm saying is... Hot water just went out on the third floor. And there's a plumber in the lobby who can help us. That's what I'm saying. Now, I need to rest. Focus on healing my hand. Oh, there are a pair of sisters in the lobby... ANGEL: Blonds. LORNE: The Bailey twins. GUNN: I'll ask them if they'd like to come up and visit you. Exactly what I was thinking. This is only the beginning. No one will ever have to feel Lonely again. [TIRES SCREECH] FRED: Oh, get off! Get off! I'm vegetarian! Really? With those choppers? Okay, I eat fish, and occasionally vermin. But that's it, I swear. - You believe me, don't you? - You're still breathing, aren't you? More like hyperventilating. You scared the cream cheese out of me. [FRED GROANING] What are you doing? Don't do that. - Come on, get a room. - Sit down. Any monkey business, and I'll chop you down like a cherry tree. - So are we just gonna sit here like this? - Maybe. Can you give me a time frame? Because I got a bladder the size of... Shut up! I'm trying to figure some stuff out. WESLEY: <i>Consider her armed, dangerous</i> and quite possibly insane. Don't let her grace or gentle beauty fool you. Winifred Burkle is a monster... ...a siren, hoping to lure you away from Jasmine... ...and onto the rocks of heresy and destruction. Amen to that. Now... ...Lorne has a few important announcements... ...and as I understand, a very special surprise. [CROWD APPLAUDS] Blessings and moon pies, brethren and "sistren." I'll cut to the chase and start with the hourly Jasmine report. Her Royal Yumminess is currently resting after a particularly exhausting day. No word yet whether she'll make a drive-by this evening or not. Good news for you third floor faithful, the hot water's back on. Okay, and now it's time for that big surprise we've been talking about. Tonight, we're going to try kicking it a little different at Fellowship Hall... ...because tonight... Tonight is open-mike night. That's right, that's right, love bugs. So anyone who wants to share their joy... ...about good Queen Jasmine is more than welcome. So who wants to get the ball rolling? Why I love Jasmine, by Linford Ditweiler. I love Jasmine because she makes food taste good. [SOBS] Jasmine rocks! Jasmine rocks! [CROWD CHANTING, CLAPPING] [SINGING] I have 37 cats... ...and I've just changed all their names to Jasmine. [SOBS] [SINGING] We should do this every night. Drafty in here, what with that hole you smashed in the roof. You mind if I quest for fire? Forget it. I'll just freeze to death. Not like I care anymore. - On the run like an animal. - You don't live here? - Do you live in a dirt hole? - No. - Do you want to live in a dirt hole? - No. Why do you think that I live in a dirt hole? - You're a demon. - I'm an executive demon, thank you. I had an office and an assistant and a beautiful porcelain cup for my tea. Now I live in a dirt hole because of those "Jasmaniacs" and their demon jihad. Wait. You're here because of Jasmine? Me too. I'm a fugitive too. Wow. Amazing. Two beings, dissimilar as you and me... ...discovering a shared link against a common foe. The irony. My feelings for you are changing. I feel... ...warmth. Wait. No, I don't. That's me wetting myself because you wouldn't let me pee! - Thanks for nothing. - Hey, I'm new to this fugitive thing. I've been trying to suss out all night how Jasmine controls people. - We have to stop her. - Okay, fine, we'll stop her. But not tonight. Not till I've had a little shuteye. I'm beat. Hey, these yours? Because I've never seen them before. Why would anyone keep a stash of these tasty little...? I mean, disgusting, meaty things like this laying around? Okay, so not a vegetarian. Finger food? [GROWLS] [FRED SCREAMS] I got your demon jihad right here! Here I am. Come and get me. Fred. Hey, Fred. - You know my name. - You're famous. I'll chop out your implants, you come any closer. No need to worry. We're under strict orders not to hurt you. So Jasmine's coming for me? Yeah. Hey, could I get your autograph? Anything for a fan. - Who should I sign it to? JASMINE: To me, of course. And to reward you for your faithfulness: Dallas, November 22nd, 1963. There was no second gunman. Oswald acted alone. Oh, my God. You know that I love you, don't you, Fred? And there's nothing you can do or say to make me stop loving you. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I forgive you. No. I'm talking to Angel. I hope he can forgive me. Dumb idea for such a smarty. You know bullets don't kill me. Wanna see how they work on you? Look at her. No. Angel? I'm sorry. I had to show you. - I'm so sorry. - Show you what? No, it can't be. No. - My blood. - Dad, what's going on? Don't. He's been infected. I'm sorry, Connor. He's as dead to us as Fred. I loved you so much. We need to get you out of here. You ruin everything. I don't understand. How did it happen? Let them go. - They have to be stopped. - I need your help. - Wow, so much blood. - Stay away from it, both of you. - We need to clean this up. - I'll do it. No. - Burn it to the ground. - Okay. You want me to stay here? As scrump-tilly-icious as these are... ...they'd be tastier if our cocoa-colored queen were here. I heard that. I keep shoveling pie into my hole and still feel empty. Anybody else picking up on some weird feelings? Something's definitely off. But without Jasmine around, I can't sense it specifically. - You getting anything? - A visual on our lovely leader. A visual? Really? Some gift you got there, Kreskin. Where is she? Over yonder. Shouldn't Angel be with them? I'll make this brief. Fred infected Angel. He's gone. Lost to us. GUNN: What? Don't worry. I'm not so easily undone as that. Any idea how she did it, how Fred turned him? Yes. My kindness turned him. By being loving to Fred, I opened the door to her hate. By trying to save Fred, I lost Angel. It won't happen again. We must eradicate their hate. You. You. And you, come with me. Connor. I can't believe Fred managed to sway Angel back to the dark side. Evil, not evil, evil again. I wish he'd make up his mind. I guess the good news is it doesn't matter anymore. Jasmine says Angel has to die, he dies. Angel? You okay? Bullet feels like a bee sting. - That's not what I meant. - I know. I don't want to talk about it. I think you do. I miss her so much. I never... I know. It's been over a week, and I still cry. Part of me wishes I still believed the lie. Well, why don't we? I mean, I'm not exactly clear on... Jasmine's blood. It was on the bullet that hit you. Somehow, it breaks her spell when it mingles with ours. It must've got in my system when I was trying to get the blood off her blouse. You did the right thing, Fred. It took a lot of courage. [CRYING] ANGEL: It must've been hard for you. I'm sorry. I've been so alone... ...and scared. I'm not like you... ...not a champion. Everything I see says different. We need more of Jasmine's blood. We have to help the others. - We'll never get close to her. Not now. - Then we need another way. What? It's pretty horrible, but may... [PEOPLE CHATTERING] You think they bought it? I did. I mean, I didn't hear anything. WOMAN: Angel. MAN 1: You're dead, Fred. I'm thinking they didn't buy it. MAN 2: Get them! Stand guard. No one comes into the hallway. Over there. Take off your clothes. [CLATTERS] FRED: I can't even count all the ways this is wrong. It's not like she'll feel it, right? I mean, she's... Brain dead? Expression doesn't exactly leave a lot to the imagination, does it? Just makes what I have to do a little easier. ANGEL WHISPERING: I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, she's awake. Cordy? Cordelia, can you hear me? We're right here. She grabbed my hand. Angel, people in comas, sometimes their bodies just do things... ...mumble words, maybe even open their eyes. It doesn't necessarily mean they're waking up. But it could. Stranger things have happened. Like Cordelia giving birth to a beautiful ebony goddess? Not the example I was looking for, but yeah. I know. Sorry. Maybe we should get this over with. Is that enough? Any more room at the inn? Look at this. Pigs in paradise. Mind if I pay my respects to the woman... ...who made peace on Earth a possible possibility? Thank you, Cordelia, for your sacrifice. For bringing our Jasmine into the world and... Hey, hey, what are you doing to the...? [MUFFLED YELLING] You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. My sweet boy. Where are those people? I ate them. Cool. You're sure you can do this? Hallelujah. Hey, I'm praising Jasmine. How about you? - Yeah. - Okay. Tonight, the role of Judas Iscariot will be played by Krevlornswath... ...of the Deathwok Clan. Hey, feeling the love, huh? Thank you, Jasmine. Feeling the love. Hey, good news, my devoted darlings. Jasmine's pulling you off stacking duty, wants to see us ASAP for a little TLC. Really? - I haven't sensed anything, have you? - No. Everything else has been feeling pretty clear. What happened to you? - What do you mean? - Your wrist. You've cut it. Oh, it's... That is... That's a long, boring story. Come on. [THUDDING AND GRUNTING] How did you figure it out? It was Angel. He figured since Cordy gave birth to Jasmine... ...they might share a blood link as well as a mystical one. We hoped Cordy's blood would have the same effect when we exposed you to it. - Thanks for nothing. LORNE: Yeah. You slashed this wrist, and I'm ready to do the other one myself. Everything we believed... ...deception. How do we convince several million people that Jasmine's message is false? It's impossible. Even if we're able to develop a synthetic analog to the blood, there's... I mean, how do we fight something this huge and powerful? I don't know yet. But what I do know is that I'm not leaving this hotel without my son. I'll get him. I've kidnapped him before. What? Hey... - No! - It's gonna be okay. - You've been lied to. We all have. ANGEL: Don't make this any harder. Let go! ANGEL: Easy! Don't. - I'll kill you! - It'll pass. Right, because Lord knows he's never tried that before. You're back with us now, Connor. ANGEL: Sorry. The only way to make you see. What you're feeling is normal. We're all feeling it, the sadness. It gets better after a while. Jasmine. You understand why we're here? [CLANKS] They're here! Come quick! They're here!
