...so quit blaming me! We were impressed with your sacrifice. We'll get even. - He killed me. - He took from us. We'll pay him back. Why are you so good to me, after what I did? Because you and I are one. We made you some tea. Great. It's on the table in front of you. Table seems far. You must be tired from sleeping the last three days. He's the world's oldest teenager. Can he be having a growth spurt at 248? Two forty-seven. If we garner some paying clientele soon, we're financially sound... - ...through last Wednesday. - What? Where's it all going? There's the fixed costs: the mortgage on the big hotel, my salary-- My salary is fixed too. What if every time you identified a demon in one of your old books... ...we gave you 10 bucks? Or a chicken pot pie. I have another idea. No! Get a vision. It doesn't happen like a hit to the head. Let's test that theory with one of my books! Stop arguing. Something will turn up. It always does. Guys.... Like that. Are you all right? - Want to sit? - No, I'll throw up in my head. Did it look like this? No. More mushy and more moldy. It was growing right out of the wall. Maybe I'll just.... Mush monster's not going anywhere. We have to find the place. Its human disciples are killing each other over how to worship it. This is why, personally, I rarely go to church. I thought it was funny. So did I. God, I miss you. What did the place look like? I didn't doze off. Here I am. Where were we? Ascertaining the place in her vision. - Ascertaining. Here we go. - You are so weird lately. It felt sacred, in a twisted, demonic kind of way. It's underground, like in a tank. - Full of pillars. - A water tank? Could be. St. Bridget's in Fremont. A convent built on native burial grounds. Land's cursed. Eight murders in two years. Then it burnt up. Not as bad as what happened at Our Lady of Lochenbee. I dig convents. Anyway... ...the state dug a water tank there. We'll need help. Call Gunn. He's on the payroll. But not like me. He's more an outside contractor. - Can we really afford--? - Wesley. Calling Gunn. You're not paying me enough for this. My Uncle Theo always said, "Stay out of religious wars." - You have an uncle? - No, but it's good advice. - Is it a Thrall demon? - Yeah. Kill the Big Ugly, and the rest will stop killing each other. Yes, that's the theory. Thrall demons can be tricky. At least they're killing each other and not... Intruders! ...us! I'll get Fat Head! Watch my back! Or keep beating on that big guy. Angel, it's over! Stop! - Teamwork's a thing of the past now? - The job got done. Take the car. I need to.... He's just.... He hasn't been sleeping well lately. - He's off his game. - Since when is it a game? Thought we were meeting in the square. I ran into Lord Nichols. Horrid little man. He was dickering over price with a prostitute. Can you imagine? - I told him I'd do him for free. - Very charitable. I so loathe cheap royalty. - They all taste the same to me. - My boy does have the touch. - Darla? - Yes? Why did you kill the streetwalker? Oh, I just liked her. Guess what's next? - What is it? - Surprise. You have to guess. The three daughters. - All virgins. - Close. The middle one is delicate and unique. Did you find me a saint? Better than that. She has the sight. Visions. She sees the future. She is pure innocence. She sees what's coming. She knows what I'll do to her. I'll have to use care. Now you're learning. Down, boy. Let the plum ripen. You always come up with new things. It keeps me young. Here you go, sir. Franks! A dollar off! Franks! Franks! Dollar off with coupon. Hot dogs! Franks! A dollar off with your coupon. I really need some help, They say he handles things. Unusual things. I need to see him right away. He'd like that, soon as he returns from an important case. I'll take a report and give you a list... ...of our payment plans. Well, it's my wife, Claire. She's really a lovely.... Go on. It's all right. She gets abducted by aliens on a regular basis. Aliens? - From outer space? - It's quite common. One minute she's there, and the next.... She always comes back in a day or so. What is it you'd like us to do? I trust Claire. But I found this receipt from a hotel... ...two weeks ago, when she was supposed to be in the Trifid Nebula. - We'll figure this out. - If it's not aliens-- Is that...? Meet your new best friend. - You think my wife's cheating? - Probably. He likes you. He's jumping right in. He didn't seem that-- All the greats are eccentric. Holmes, Marlowe.... - Those are fictional-- - Right. That gives him a leg up. Terrific way to treat our paying customers. Especially since we have so many of them. See his file? He has Visa, MasterCard, a problem. Just what we need. But if you want to be rude... ...I guess it's your shop. Angel? What are you--? Personal bubble. Personal bubble! I need to speak with you. Cordelia, you shouldn't be here. - Did I do something? - He felt my hair. - What? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Haven't been myself lately, because of her. I saw her, here in town last night. Oh, no, not again. Look. I like Buffy as much as-- Not Buffy. Darla. Darla the vampire? Your sire? Been dreaming about her like crazy. The dreams have been so.... I thought I was losing it. But she's here. She's alive. Impossible. You killed her 3Â½ years ago. I know. But it was her. - Vampires don't return from death. - I did. And I saw her. - Where? - Between the clowns and a big hot dog. Walking on the promenade. You said you were having dreams lately. Maybe guilt over killing your sire. Right! Guilt. Who loves guilt more than you? You need to go back to work. We have a fun new case. Aliens, adultery, it's a corker. I dream about her because she's here. You think she's here because you're dreaming. He's falling apart. That's wonderful. Unhinging a man with all his strengths and weaknesses is tough. I created many of his strengths and weaknesses. I have a pretty good handle on them. We're counting on that. You gave us invaluable information on Angel. Nobody knows him like you. Especially the side we're interested in. So, what is the plan exactly? I tease him to death? We want him dark, not dead. And the best way to his darkness... ...is to awaken his nastier urges. He did that to you? What's it feel like? Doesn't feel like anything. Can I? It's very smooth. You don't feel anything? Not in my hand. How is it... ...seeing him again? Strange. He betrayed you. Everyone betrays you. That's not what eats at you. Yeah? What does? Missed opportunities. He got a soul and it sickened me. All that power wasted on a whining, mopey do-gooder. God, I could eat his eyeballs. Our plans for Angel are more long-term. But if you must, then... ...be my guest. You're fun, for a human. I've a special interest in this guy. Lots of people do. Jack. What brings you to Siberia? Hello, Kate. - You've been sick. - No. Busy, then? Too busy to call and say hi? We were friends. - Thought you'd be different. - I supported you. I objected when they transferred you. You don't like regular work. You got the scanner going day and night, chasing the bizarre. Did you think they'd promote you? --working on 4O5 and Pico, A friend of a friend thought you might want this. Thanks. Stay out of trouble. Now? You sure about this? Marty, aliens abduct me when the mood hits. The mood hit as soon as Harold left for work. No kidding? Yeah? - You're not in the mood? - I'm in the mood, I'm deep in the mood, I'd love to abduct and probe you now. - But I still got lots of repairs, - I hope nothing is broken, No, It all works, So let's go upstairs, Claire. Do I know you? I've been listening over there, recording you... ...while my associates tailed you, taking pictures. I don't like doing this. Your husband knows. Tell him the truth. Stay or leave, I don't care. But this.... - We had a paying client! - It wasn't worth getting paid for. Easy to say when you don't need food to live. That's her. Oh, sorry. Guess you didn't stay dead, did you? - You trying to pass for a human? - Excuse me. I know your voice, Darla. I can smell you. I don't know you. Leave me alone. - Whatever you're up to, you won't win. - I don't think-- - Is everything all right? - No! This man was.... My name is DeEtta Kramer. My husband is getting the car. I don't know any Darla. It's you. I know you won't step in that sun. Step over here-- - Stephen! Stephen! - Angel! Stephen! Are you okay? Guys, that was really fun. Public humiliation, running from hotel security... ...and the nifty outfit telling so many conventioneers: "Pet me, I'm a whore." - There's a silver lining. - Silver lining? The woman went in the sun. Obviously she's not a vampire. Angel... - ...made a mistake. - You think? We have to come together and help him. You're among friends. - We won't condemn you. - Right. You're crazy. You need help. It was Darla. She's back and she's human now. I know her scent. Angel, you can't just sniff a person and.... - You had sex last night with a blond. - How--?! That's unbelievable. You had sex? - She's not in here. - Who, Darla? DeEtta Kramer, the name she's using. Run a title deed search. Find her address. - I'll try some other avenues. - Okay. Wesley, I need a few bucks for the cover charge. - Cover charge? You're going to-- - Do whatever it takes. Everybody have fun tonight Everybody wang-- Fun tonight Everybody wang chung tonight Everybody have fun tonight Everybody have fun tonight Everybody Everybody have fun tonight Everybody Everybody have fun tonight Everybody I'm very sorry. Tell me about Darla. Give me a sec. You're sending out some huge vibes. My fillings are still humming. Rico... ...refill my drink. Win my devotion. - You saw something. - I saw lots of things. - You're at a junction. - So talk. So, no. - No? You won't tell me? - You're in trouble. Big trouble. Let her go. That way lies badness. You give murderous demons free advice, but you won't help me. I set people on their paths, okay? This is way off your path. - Go home. - Tell me where Darla is. I know you won't start anything in here. You're a good boy. Have a drink before you go. It's on me. Angel Investigations, solving big problems for less. - It's me. Did you get an address? - It's him! Angel, we really think you need to-- Address, now. DeEtta and Stephen Kramer own a home... ...at 1409 Galloway, Studio City. Got it. What are you looking at? He hung up. You really stood up to him. "I don't bend to him like you, Wesley." Don't start with me. If I sound like that, shoot me. I'm joking. It's not for you. It's a tranquilizer. You mean if Angel really goes crazy like he did before? Think that'll do it? I better call Gunn. Thank you. Of course, sweetheart. Was that too much? If we're married, would I still be holding your chair? That was fine. Now just eat. Actors try to find the truth in the moment. Truthfully, I shouldn't be holding your chair. This linguine smells so, you know, true. I'll mime eating. I gotta watch the figure. So is he watching us right now? Just nod and smile, Stephen. What did this guy do to you? All this trouble to get even? Not that I mind working. Last year, I did this puppet theater and-- If you don't shut up, I'm going to kill you. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Lindsey, can you hear me? I hear you. How's the linguine? He's here, I can feel him, We know, Give me a few more minutes, Hurry up. Who are you talking to? I'm shutting up. This is all just precautionary. When things get bad, Angel's a.... - We trust him. - I see. He doesn't turn evil every time he gets cranky. He turns evil? Forces can revert Angel to Angelus, who he was... ...before he got his soul. How evil a vampire was Angelus? As bad as they come. Especially when he was with Darla. We're researching her to see if she has some kind of resurrection powers. Maybe she's a vampire cat with nine lives. So he and Darla together is bad. They ravaged half the world, until Angel got a soul. Imagine Bonnie and Clyde, if they had 150 years. So he thinks his girl is back. If he's back to his old ways, how bad can it get? Hello, love. You made a mess out there. Blood and habits everywhere. Convents. They're just a big cookie jar. Black sky. It wants a little worm in me. No. No. What is she doing here? I thought you killed her. No, just her family. --eyes like arrows. Like needles. This one's special. I have big plans for her. Snake in the woodshed. Snake in the woodshed. Snake in the woodshed. Snake in the woodshed. - So do we kill her during or after? - Neither. We turn her into one of us. Killing is so merciful, isn't it? The pain ends. But to make her one of us.... She's a lunatic. Eternal torment. Am I learning? Lindsey, I'm waiting. You're on. Have fun. - 911, What's the emergency? - I'm DeEtta Kramer at 1409 Galloway. There's a man outside. Oh, my God, he's breaking into the house! He's gonna kill us! Help me! - Help me! - I didn't sign up for this. - Do it. Make it look real. - That was illegal. Help me! Somebody help me! My God! Someone help me! Don't hurt me! Please, no! What did you do? Why did you? He was my husband! She should have her own series. Don't hurt me! What did you do? Turn around! On your knees. Do it! You'll pay for this. - In the attic. - Right. - Seal the house. I want SWAT, now! - You got it. He's on the roof. There he is! Go! Take the back! Move around! I don't understand, They shot him. How did he get away? Adrenaline. They chased him for 16 blocks. Don't worry. He can't hurt you now. They said you recognized him. His name was Angel? That's what he told me. He started following me a few weeks ago. He said he helped the helpless. I told him I didn't need any help. He kept calling me Darla. He said he knew me or this Darla from a long time ago. Today we were at the hotel and he showed up again. Then tonight, he came here. I told him to stay out, that I was calling the police and he broke in. This will sound crazy, but something is wrong with his face. And he was biting. It isn't crazy. I want you to know I'll find him, and he'll pay for this. Thank you, detective. Contact the hotel security for any tapes of the... ...incident with Mrs. Kramer. Make sure the coroner is careful to preserve the scene. You all right? Just adjusting to the idea that a good-guy vampire can go bad. It takes time. We've been there. 99 percent of the time he's good. He's helped us. I respect loyalty a lot. That's good. But if the bad Angel returns, I'll kill him in two seconds. Where is he? He's not here. Check every room. He's dangerous. Bullets might not work. If you see him, call me. Do you have a search warrant? He killed Stephen Kramer and kidnapped his wife. - He wouldn't. - It's not the person he is. He's not a person at all, is he? You want to help yourselves out here, or go down with him? So be it. - New player? - He's a friend. - And what's your name? - Charles Gunn. Let's see some I.D., Charles. - You got any priors? - I forget. Montgomery, check it. Whatever you think Angel did-- Who's Darla? So you're what Wolfram & Hart brought back in that box. And they brought you back as human. They think I won't kill one. Wanna know what I think? I think they don't know me that well. You feel what this place was like before they excavated it? It was a convent. You know how much I like convents. Come on, Darla. You and I are too old to play games. I need to talk to the real you. It's been a long time since I said this to anyone. But you can scream all you want. I'm not gonna scream. There's my boy. Well, look here. "Disturbing the peace. Resisting arrest. GTA, assault." You've led a rich, full life. - I get around. - I know this guy. He helps people. I bet this stuff happened a long time ago. - Some of it was when he was a minor. - Uh-huh. Some of it was in the last two weeks. Oh. Word to the wise. These two and their boss aren't good for you. I can see you're looking out for me, detective. Let's not get off-track. We want to find Angel too. No, you don't. You want to protect him, even though he's lost it. He stalked that woman because he thought she was this Darla. He knocked down the door... ...and killed her husband. I know what he is, and I know he hasn't changed. No, he hasn't. He's still a vampire. Not helping. So how'd he get in the house? She invite him in? Of course she didn't in-- The only way he could've gotten in uninvited... ...is if the real owners were dead. She isn't DeEtta Kramer. - You're grasping at straws. - Are we? This is a daguerreotype of Darla, taken over 100 years ago. The woman who said she was DeEtta-- Look familiar? That's enough. I'm pretty familiar with the international sign for enough... ...and you have a ways to go. You're hurting me. I like it. What's the play? What kind of game are you running? Just having a little fun. Been out of commission too long. You know. They didn't bring you back for fun. The dreams, the frame-job. What's the plan? Get me so screwed up I go bad again? Trite, I know. What do you expect? They're only human. Better embrace that mediocrity. You're human now. But I'm still me. I remember everything. Everything we did, everything we can do. Yeah. But the bitch is... ...you have a soul now. Pretty soon... ...those memories will start eating away at you. No matter how hard you try... ...you won't be able to escape the truth of what you were. Believe me, I know. But you can escape. You can escape it all. Remember what it's like to get lost? Every thought a million miles away. Every part of your being alive. All you have to do is let me... ...give you one little moment of happiness. You took me places and showed me things. You blew the top off my head. But you never made me happy. But that cheerleader did? We were together 150 years. We shared everything. You're saying never? You couldn't understand. I understand, all right. Taste something fresh, you think you're touching God. - It wasn't-- - You bet your ass it was. In the early years... ...you would've said I was the definition of bliss. Buffy wasn't happiness. She was just new. You know... ...you're getting awfully bent over this. I couldn't feel that with you... ...because I didn't have a soul. But then I got a second chance... ...just like you have. What a poster child for soulfulness! This is no life, Angel. You weren't just any vampire, you were a legend. Nobody could keep up with you. Not even me. You don't learn that. It's innate. It was in you before we ever met. You said you can smell me? Well, I can smell you too. My boy is still in there, and he wants out. He's nowhere to be found. Some of you stay here in case he shows. I'll be sure and mention your cooperation in the report. We did more than that. We solved the case. Whoever did away with the owners of that house is your killer. - You don't get it. - The fact that he's innocent? While you're fighting your battles of good and evil... ...the innocent are the ones in the crossfire. Those are the ones I care about. Like that man tonight. Or the real owners of that house. The ones I chalk up to your boss. You can't blame Angel-- He's trying to do what's right. That's right, he's good. I keep forgetting. And why did he kidnap that woman again? You're going to feel it. What you did. That man you got killed. - Please. He was an actor. - I'm serious. Like a heart attack. And just about as much fun. - Hurt anyone else and I'll kill you. - Yeah? - Isn't that against your code? - I'll make an exception. You'll miss those dreams. You should hear what you say in your sleep. Nasty things, Angel. - Things-- - Stop it. No, you stop! No matter how good a boy you are... ...God doesn't want you. But I still do. What, no goodbye kiss? It's us. We didn't see you all day. We just wondered if everything was copacetic. I didn't go bad. I was never worried about that. - Mr. Fussy Pants assumes the worst. - What? I didn't.... - I never-- - Anything else? Can't think of a thing. Angel. - Careful. - What do you mean? It's just with Darla back, in league with Wolfram & Hart... ...there are many forces against you. There's going to be trouble.
