Rest here. You rest now. I'll put your stuff here. I'll be close. Angel. Yeah? Nothing. Bitch. Not you, obviously. I'm so sorry that I allowed this to happen. It was Faith who allowed her elbow to collide with my face. Not your fault. At least you only got the elbow. If it's any consolation, it looks like you were tortured by a larger woman. - She's still here, I assume. - He gave her his bed. - Wesley. - Angel. I didn't expect to see you in today. How you feeling? - As well as can be expected. - Good. Doughnuts? Developed a sweet fang, have you? - You got jelly? - Whole selection. Won't she find it difficult enjoying delicious jelly doughnuts... ...if she is, one assumes, bound and gagged? - We already went through this. - You were right. The police are ill-equipped to hold a slayer. I see why you didn't turn her over. But I don't see why the woman who brutally tortured me last night... ...this morning, gets pastries! I don't have anything else downstairs. Do you want to let her starve? There are more humane ways to deal with a rabid animal. - She's not an animal. - No? She's a person. Don't forget, we don't give up on people. Don't take the moral high ground with me after what she did. I believe in helping people, not coddling killers! Not long ago you wanted to rehabilitate her. Not too long ago I had full feeling in my right arm! - She wants to change. - There is evil in that girl, Angel. It doesn't matter what she wants or says she wants. She'll kill again. - He'll come around. - Wesley? Sure! People always get a little funny... ...right after they've been sadistically tortured. Well, you'd know. I need you to sign these. - You see why we have to help, right? - Totally. Here. We can't arbitrarily decide who's worth saving. Oh, I know! And this one? Thanks. - Wait, those were all made out to you. - Yeah. "Paid vacation"? Like I'll stick around while psycho case is loose downstairs... ...with three tons of medieval weaponry? Not! Oh, and I'm thinking: Sugar high? Maybe not a great idea. They gotta check in the back. - See if the neighbors heard anything. - Right. - Kate. What are you doing here? - I'm a detective, Kendrick. See? I'm detecting. - Heard we have a fugitive. - Yeah. Felony arrest warrant from Sunnydale. I've seen it. Is she the one who threw the party here? The victim identifies her as his mugger. Put him in the hospital, stole his keys and wallet. We're lifting prints now. I bet we get a match. Anything else? Why are you examining a crime scene you're not assigned to? - It looked interesting. - Right. - You've heard the rumors. - What? You know, she supposedly has some supernatural powers? - Really? - Come on, Kate. Everyone knows you've gone all Scully. Anytime we get a weird case, you're there. What's going on with you? Scully is the skeptic. Huh? Mulder is the believer. Scully is the skeptic. - Scully is the chick, right? - Yes. - But she doesn't want to believe. - And you want to believe? Oh, I already believe. That's the problem. Faith? I have doughnuts. I understand what you're going through... ...and I want to help. But there are a few things you must do. First... ...I need you to give me that knife. You should be resting. I've been asleep for eight months. You rest. - We found her. - Where? - She's with him. - Is he dead? Well, he is a vampire. So technically, yes, he is dead. But not by her hand. - She is his house guest. - What? Our assassin hasn't done her job because she's rooming with the mark. - We hired her to kill him. - I did say "assassin." - He invites her to stay the night. - He's not easy. He can't be bought. He can't be killed, even by a vampire slayer. - Rumor has it he used to date one. - Who else knows about this? No one outside of this room. Not yet anyway. The senior partners won't like it. We conspired with her, paid her half up front... ...and now she makes us look like fools. So the question is, how are we gonna fix it? I say we kill her. Faith, no! - You killed a man, - I don't care, Faith. You're in no condition to leave. If you go, you'll run for the rest of your short life. - It doesn't matter. - It does matter. It matters to me. Why are you doing this? Why are you being nice? Stop it. You gonna move or do we fight? - Am I your prisoner here? - No. You're not. - So I'm free. - Don't know about that. But the door's open. Where will you go? Back out in that darkness? I once told you that you didn't have to go out in that darkness. That it was your choice. Well, you chose. You thought that you could just touch it. That you'd be okay. Five by five, right, Faith? But it swallowed you whole. So tell me: How'd you like it? Help me? Yeah. Hello, Wesley. So, Los Angeles. California. Who knew you'd end up here? It was as good a place as any to re-evaluate my life... ...after being asked to resign from the Council. And the weather. I find it... ...dry. They wouldn't give you dosh for the fare home? No, they wouldn't. Alchemists on the board of directors, and we still fly coach. Miserly bastards. A frugal lot, to be sure, but not stupid. And willing to admit they've made a mistake. - Made a mistake? - How would you like to come home? - Back to England with us. - Home? The Council's willing to reinstate you to your rightful position as Watcher. It was a nasty business in Sunnydale, but nobody blames you. Really? I rather got the impression they did when they sacked me. As I said. Mistake. One that can now be corrected with your help. We know where she is, and we know you have access to her. - No. I couldn't possibly. - Loyalty to a vampire now, is it? It's all right. That's not why we're here. A rogue slayer, Wesley. Far more dangerous than any single vampire. - Surely you understand that. - All too well. Then you'll help us? Why come to me? You know where she is. Take her yourselves. You three are the best. The Council's elite. The-- She cleaned your clocks, didn't she? She's betrayed our calling, the Council, you. She has power and the willingness to use that power for evil. She must be stopped. So how does this work? There's no simple answer to that. I won't lie and say it'll be easy, because it won't be. You want to change. Doesn't mean the world's ready for you to. The truth is, no matter how much you suffer... ...or how many good deeds you do to make up for the past... ...you may never balance out the cosmic scale. I can promise that you'll probably be haunted. Maybe for the rest of your life. So how does this work? Power level, time, start. - That popcorn gonna be enough for you? - Yeah. I can live off the stuff. - Tell Cordelia I'll pay her back. - It belonged to Wesley. - Maybe we just don't mention it, then. - Maybe we do. - Are you saying I gotta apologize? - Think you can? I don't know. How do you say, "Gee, sorry I tortured you"? I'd leave off the "Gee." And I think you have to ask yourself; Are you? - What? - Sorry. There are things you can't take back, no matter how sorry you are. - I've got experience in that area. - You've done this for 100 years. - I can't handle 10 minutes. - So handle the next five. - I don't think I can. - Yes, you can. - I hate that it hurts like this. - It's supposed to hurt. All that pain you caused is coming back on you. Feel it! Deal with it! Then maybe you've got a shot at being free. I gotta be the first slayer in history sponsored by a vampire. I've got experience in that area too. Oh, God. "B." How will I ever make things right with her? This isn't about Buffy. There was only one person who tried to be my friend... ...who went out of her way when I didn't deserve it... ...and I screwed her. Not to mention her boyfriend. Only him, literally. - Faith, we never actually-- - Not you. The new one. Oh, my God. - Angel, I'm so sorry. I-- - No. There. You can say it. That's good. Good. Thank you for coming down on such short notice. We can rely on your professionalism? We've had trouble with freelancers in the past. Do you take cream? No. All right. Here's the target. Don't let the picture fool you. She's tougher than she looks. We're not talking anything elaborate, no slow or painful death. - Well, some pain would be good. - The point is, we want her dead. Yes. Dead. A lot. Just so we're clear, we won't put any of this down on paper. This is strictly a handshake deal. Not that hands are necessary for us to do business with you. That was speciesist of me. I apologize if I-- --offended you in any way. Careful. The sedative in that syringe... ...is powerful enough to bring down a man twice your size or a slayer. - How does it work? - How do you think? You jab her with it, don't you? A little pressure on the flesh and she'll feel it. - You intend to take her alive? - Yes. She'll be out long enough to take to England. There, she'll begin her rehabilitation. The Council believes she can be rehabilitated? We have every confidence. Signal us as soon as it's done, and we'll take care of the rest. Thanks. I have some conditions of my own. Just one, actually. - Don't harm the vampire. - Don't be a ponce! You won't get any help from me. - We have no quarrel with the vampire. - Other than him being one. He's a special case. He's reformed. He has a soul. In point of fact, I've confronted more evil, slain more-- --demons, done more good, while working with Angel... ...than I ever did while in the Council's employ. - We'll make every effort. - No. Not every effort. No harm. I must have your word. Done. Where's the dough? What'd you do with it? --final round, We'll be right back, Coming up next on the Channel 3 News, local council-- Everything okay? It was scary for the four minutes I was alone, but I survived. left-fielder Drew will step into the box, batting ,321 on the-- LAPD, in conjunction with the Feds, are looking for this woman, The felony suspect from the California town of Sunnydale... Faith? ...has fled to Los Angeles in recent days, - Witnesses identified her... - What? ...as involved in several assaults, Police want your help in finding her, It's okay. We knew about this. Nothing's changed-- Anyone with any information about this suspect... ...should call law enforcement immediately, Do not approach her, She's violent and unpredictable, Any questions? Listen to me. You're safe here. You hear me? You're safe. No. Hey, hey. Shh. Hey. Sit down. It's okay. It's gonna be okay, all right? All right. Buffy. - I didn't know you-- - What--? How-- - What are you doing? - She-- We were attacked. "We"? - You and.... - Faith. You and Faith. - It's not what you think. - You think I can form a thought now? Giles heard that... ...she tried to kill you. That's true. So you're punishing her with a severe cuddling? - Is that why you came? To punish her? - I was worried about you. Buffy. Oh, God. - Didn't think I'd find you, did you? - Let's talk. - Talking isn't in order now. - She needs help. - You have any idea what she did to me? - Yes. Do you care? - She wants to change, a chance to-- - No. No chance. Jail. - You think that'll help? - Buffy. - I'm sor-- - Apologize and I'll beat you to death. - Go ahead. - This is not gonna happen. You'll have to stop me. - Don't do this. - Go upstairs now. - You think I'll-- - Back off. - I'm not letting her out of my sight. - Go! Don't you move a-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Faith. - Going somewhere? - No. Just wanted to be alone. Angel downstairs? Yeah. Right. - Well? - Strike two. Ridiculous. The first assassin kills the second one... ...sent to kill her, who assassinated no one... ...until we hired the second assassin to assassinate her. - Okay. This obviously isn't working. - You think? - We've gone about this wrong. - Meaning? As lawyers, it's a mistake to work outside the law. - He's being ironic. - Not at all. It's time we moved this fight to our own turf. I'll take care of it. - She's not gonna run. - Why would she... ...when she has her brave knight to protect her? Got you. Does she cry? Pouty lips, heaving bosom? - I thought you needed help. - You think I wanted this to happen? You hit me. Not to go all schoolyard, but you hit me first. In case you forgot, you're stronger than me. You did it for her. You were three seconds from making her run. - She's at a crucial stage. - She's playing you. - She tried to kill you! - That was just... - ...a cry for help. - No, that's when you say "help" aloud. - She did bad things to you. - You've no idea. You've no idea what she's going through. But, of course, you do. I'm sorry. I can't be in your club. I've never murdered anybody. - Faith, I told you-- - Slight change of plan. - Get your coat. - What's going on? The Council's team is coming. They'll expect her to be drugged. - How many? - Three. - I'm afraid you came at a bad time. - I'm feeling that. - Why'd you bring them? - I pretended to help. - Why aren't you? - They're killers. - They've surrounded the building. - We'll go through the sewers. - She left. - She'd head for the roof. - Buffy can protect her. - That's not her agenda. - The sewer's our best route. - If they don't know about it. - It wasn't for her. - I know. It's because I trust you. More than three gun-toting maniacs, at any rate. Why should I listen to you? I despise you and everything you represent. And when I say "represent" and "thing," I do mean your clients. Be that as it may, I have information that will be of interest to you. While it's true we differ on many issues... - ...we do have one thing in common. - Our bodies are both 80% water? An enemy. - I don't know-- - Sure you don't. We can't be clear because the law isn't clear on such matters. Take for example the creatures that murdered your father. They couldn't have been brought to justice, even if they had lived. And personally, I feel that you were totally justified... ...in taking whatever extralegal measures that you found necessary. - What do you want? - There are beings. Beings not governed by the laws and strictures we humans have devised. This man is such a being. He feels he's above the law. Which is why he gives aid and comfort to a known murderer. The woman you're looking for? She's with him. You're not gonna run, Faith. What do you want to do? You gonna throw me off the roof again? Any reason why I shouldn't? There's nothing I can do for you, "B." I can't ever make it right. So you're gonna take off, let us clean up another one of your messes. It'd be easier for you. Till you get bored with guilt and come back to shake things up? - That's not gonna happen. - You're right. It's not. Angel said you wouldn't give me a chance. I gave you every chance! I tried so hard to help you, and you spat on me. My life was just something for you to play with. Angel, Riley... ...anything that you could take from me, you took. I've lost battles before... ...but nobody else has ever made me a victim. You can't stand that. You're all about control. You have no idea what it's like where nothing's in control or makes sense! There's just pain and hate and nothing you do means anything-- Shut up! Just tell me how to make it better. That's coming from the roof. - I didn't give you the signal. - Shut it. Vampire. We can make it to the other building. Go. - Weatherby, listen to reason. - Reason? A Watcher working for a vampire. It's perversion. I must take this guy out. The guy up there'll go for me. Stay here. Okay. Keep her steady! Weatherby. Do the sacred oaths you swore as a Watcher mean nothing to you? As a matter of fact they do. I swore to protect the innocent. - Get to the roof. - What? - Now! - Bastard! One hundred and eighty. That's for calling me a ponce. Down! Take it down. Faith? Where is she? You got one shot here, Angel. Where is she? Arrest him. Start with aiding and abetting a felon. You'll like your cell. It faces east and has a great view of the sunrise. - What? You know what he is. - Who are you? - She's nobody. - Wait. This is murder. - It's okay. - It's not. - Get her out of here! - You are not taking the fall for her. Buffy. I'd like to make a confession. You should've told me what was going on. I didn't-- I didn't think it was your business. - Not my business? - I needed more time with Faith-- You needed-- Do you have any idea what it was like for me to see you with her? - You went behind my back. - It wasn't about you! It was about saving a soul. That's what I do and you're not a part of it. It was your idea to stay away from each other. - I came because you were in danger. - I'm always in danger. You came for vengeance. - I have a right to it. - Not in my city. I have someone in my life now... ...that I love. It's not what you and I had. It's very new. You know what makes it new? I trust him. I know him. That's great. It's nice. You moved on. I can't. You found someone new. I'm not allowed to, remember? Seeing you cuts me up. The person I share that with is me! You don't know me anymore. Don't come here and expect me to do things your way. Go home! See? Faith wins again. Go. You all right? For a taciturn, shadowy guy, I got a big mouth. - Do you want to go after her? - Yes. I don't know how much my opinion counts but... - ...you did the right thing. - Yelling at Buffy? No. The other thing. I didn't do it. Faith did,
