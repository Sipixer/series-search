kill a Kek demon. Could be useful. Only if Kek demons weren't extinct. They are? Oh, dear. Well, perhaps there's one hibernating. Ready to awaken and embark on a grisly rampage. I'll keep my fingers crossed. They're done! Nobody touch! - She's making brownies. - Is that what I smell? I thought I'd tracked something in. This was handed down by my mother... ...from her housekeeper. I improvised. You're gonna love them. Me? Doesn't Angel have to--? Get to try any? They're brownies, not red blood cells. Oh, I wasn't thinking. More a drinker than an eater, I suppose. Maybe if he branched into solids, he'd keep a decent knife around. That is not appropriate! It's for killing extinct demons. - Angel, make her stop. - Cordelia-- That blade is old. Who knows what effect her cooking may have on it? "Effect"? Cordelia, put down the very sharp knife. Well, they don't smell right. I think Mr. Too Much Cologne is the pot calling the kettle stinky. Cordelia! Doyle! I mean, um, Wesley. Wesley. Let's just, um.... No more fighting, all right? - Where is it, Stephanie? - What? I didn't take it! Give me that. Stop it! - You took my card! - I didn't touch it! - What'd you do with it? - Stop it! Mom! Okay. That's it. - She took my card. - I did not! You did! I had five and now I have four. There are children in India who have three. - It's time for bed, anyway. - Mom! No! You heard your mother. It's time for bed. Do we have to? Pretend to read any good books lately? I thought you went home. You called him Doyle. It just happened. I hope Wesley's okay with it. Who cares about him? This is about Doyle. You never say his name. - I say it. - No, you don't. Look, you don't have to be Joe Stoic about his dying. I mean, I know you have this unflappable vibe working for you. But you don't have to do that for me. - I'm not unflappable. - Great. So flap. I miss him. Me too. I've been around death before. A lot. I've lost people, I've killed people. And you are dead. Sorry. I shouldn't have let it happen. Angel, it wasn't your fault. - It hurts. - Yeah. No, it, it really, really, really-- Easy. What'd you see? 1256. That's the house. Angel? - Are you all right? - Yeah. You're bleeding. Are you gonna cry? I don't think so. I don't know. Let me think.... Uh, no. No, not gonna cry. - What's your name? - Ryan. Ryan, you want to tell me what you were doing outside? Ryan! You know better than this. Now say thank you to the nice man and come inside. Ryan! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? He was in the street. He almost got hit. Paige, he's fine. Oh, God, my baby. It's cold. Let's get him inside. You saved him. Thank God you were here. - Yeah, uh, thank you. - It's okay. Scamp, isn't he? Oh, you're hurt. Your shoulder. You come inside. You scared me. Sure you don't want to go to the emergency room? You may need some stitches. It'll be fine, really. I'm not a big bleeder. We just moved in. We're still a bit jumbled. It doesn't get any easier. Every new place, you have to start over... ...finding friends... ...people to talk to. Ryan's asleep. He's out like a light. He seems like a nice boy. He is. Thank you so much. That must be the millionth time I've said that. Really, thank you. If there's anything we can do for you.... Money? Seth's an investment adviser. Do you need some advice? No, nothing. Thank you. He probably just wants to go home and get cleaned up. How did Ryan get in the street? Climbed out the window. We have burglar bars. But he must be able to fit between. We didn't even bother checking that. Where was he going? Going? He wasn't going anywhere. Think he was trying to get away from something? Why would he want to get away from his own house? Oh, dear. - This bother you? - No. Lot of health nuts these days. Like anyone needs to live forever. No one needs that. She'll be right back with the bandages, then you can go. Right. Paige was telling me you're new in town. - Where did you--? - What? This was much worse. Oh, it's just a scratch. Seth was telling me about where you lived before. Akron. One winter there was enough. You know what? Strikes me you never told us your name. Angel. Jones. Angel Jones. Angel. Honey? See? Angels. I collect them. I think they're around all the time, don't you? I think... ...there are beings. It's a nice thought. Like someone's looking out for us. Keeping us out of danger. Tonight you were our angel. I was just in the right place. It's getting late. - Come to dinner. - Paige. Tomorrow night. Say yes. Let us pay you back for looking after us. We've taken up too much of Angel's time already. Can I bring something? Something's wrong in that house. The wife wants to talk, but the husband doesn't. I'll be back tomorrow. - Be careful. - I am. Be especially careful. Plakticine. - I found it all around the house. - So now we know. Someone in there is possessed by a demon. Thanks for your help. Mom told the truth about Akron. Before that, Miami and Baton Rouge. All within the last three years. Let me guess. Couldn't lose the black cloud. Like it was fitted with chinstraps. Everywhere they go, there's been reports of disturbances, and... ...yuck, animal deaths. In Akron, a friend of the family went missing. He's still missing. What is this stuff anyway? It's kind of pretty. It's the bodily excretion of an Ethros demon. No one could've said "demon poo" before I touched it? It can't hurt you. Only the demon itself is dangerous. How dangerous? Tends to go in for mass murder. Remember Lizzie Borden? Killed her parents with an ax? I remember the children's rhyme. Why are they full of death... ...and cradles falling and mice getting tails cut off? The whole thing needs a rating system. Don't you think? Yes, well.... What the rhyme doesn't say is, she was possessed by an Ethros. An adolescent Ethros. This amount of plakticine... ...we've got a grown-up demon. Someone's got a squatter in their head. What do we do about it? Evict him. Exorcism. I'll find someone who can perform one. Not too many priests go in for it these days. Who do we exorcize? Which one's the demon? They were afraid of the father. A father doesn't have to be possessed to terrorize his children. He just has to-- We'll find out soon enough. The first step is getting him to show himself. A little Psylis Eucalipsis powder ingested by the host-- And what? Dad goes "Rrrr," head spins around? Essentially. Okay, so how do I get someone to eat Eucalipsis powder? I made brownies. More Brussels sprouts? No, thank you. I'm full. Everything was...very good. Roast was a little dry. No. It was full of roasty goodness. I think we're ready to try your brownies. I'll get the coffee. I didn't like the Brussels sprouts. They were gross. You seemed to like yours. I hid one in my mashed potatoes too. - What are you laughing at? - Angel's funny. He hides it well. Look, kids. See what Angel made for us? - What's your secret, Angel? - I use chocolate. That's why they're brown. Which gives them their name: Brownies! No hot chocolate tonight. This is your treat. - Dad! - It's not fair. Kids, shh. Company. Ryan! What's wrong? Your son's possessed by a demon. Ryan's bad. - Ryan's always been bad. - Stephanie! Baby.... Do you hear me? - Paige, listen. He's okay. - What do you mean, he's okay? - The demon had to show itself first. - You did this to him? I just used the brownies to-- You put something in our food, you poisoned him? What were you thinking? I thought you were here to help us. You're not an angel. Paige, it's okay. Seth, he did this to Ryan. We both know that is not true. What's wrong with Ryan has been wrong for a long time. You say you can help my son? All right. What do you need? A phone. I found our demon in the boy. We're not ready. I have a priest, but we can't find him. I need a binding powder. Everything is in the pantry. We can hold him for a while. We're coming to you. How is she? She's just.... It's been so long. This isn't gonna be easy. For the last three years... ...it's been all I could do to hold this family together. Now you come here and give us a reason for all the terror... ...and a way to end it? Maybe you are an angel. Can someone watch your daughter? - Yes. Why? - The rest of you are coming with me. My assistants. I'm Cordelia. Sorry about the possession. Uh.... Hello. Should I put plastic down? Are we expecting any vomiting? I saw the movie. The powder will control him while we find the priest. He doesn't need a priest. Paige. Listen to me. The only way through this is to let us help. Your son is possessed. Deep down, you know this is true. You know it. Cordelia will stay with you until we return. Don't break the circle. He'll ask you to come to him. Don't do it, don't touch him. He's been exposed and he's angry. He'll kill you. You got that? Jeez, we got it! Circle, angry, kill. Go to church already. Hail Mary, full of grace.... Sister? Sorry to disturb you. I hope you didn't lose your place. Not at all. How can I--? You would come in to a place of worship? - I'm not what you think. - No? Okay. Yeah, I am. But I'm trying to help a child possessed by an Ethros demon. Which is why we need to find Father Fredricks. It's rather urgent. He's behind the church. Thank you. Progress, at last. The last grave on the left. He's.... The father's dead? Six months ago, a family came to Father Fredricks. Their daughter was possessed with a demon. A very powerful demon. Father Fredricks saved the young woman. But he couldn't save himself. It was an Ethros demon? If the child you are trying to save... ...really is possessed with an Ethros, my prayers are with you. Both of you. Because what you're dealing with... ...is very, very smart and very dangerous. Even more dangerous than you. Mommy? Where are you? Mommy, I'm scared. I need you. Are you there? Couldn't I just take him his toys? Please? You heard what Angel said. We have to wait. But why do we have to wait? Things were going really well this time. Can't we just keep on like it was? Paige, no. Not after Ohio. Ohio? A friend of ours... ...the kids called him Uncle Frank, died in a fire. That was an accident. It wasn't Ryan. I'm scared, and it's so cold in here. Mommy? And that isn't Ryan, either. Paige? I'm not going to him, okay? I'm playing by the stupid rules. Good, we can stay busy. You'll get caught up... ...won't even hear your son's pain. Mommy, I need you. I'm so scared. Come here! This is just too cruel. It's almost over. Angel's good at this kind of thing. And Wesley.... They'll be right back with the priest. You can't do it. I know the ritual. We have the supplies. You aren't ready. It takes tremendous strength. - Mental strength. - Resistance. I understand that. I possess a certain-- You don't even have sales resistance. How many Thighmasters do you own? The second was free, with Buns of Steel, The priest was an expert. An Ethros killed him. - You're saying I can't do it. - That's right. So our only option is, you do it. - That was vulgar. - But I made my point. All right. You'll do it. But I'll be right there with you. See, honey? Mommy's right here. I'm not going anywhere. Nobody's gonna hurt you, sweetie. It's gonna be okay. Paige, come away. You wanted to see him. There he is. And he's gonna be fine. He's not fine. Look at him, Seth. Look at him. He needs me. Mama? Mom, I can't see. Something's wrong with my eyes and it hurts. Why won't you help me? I'm here, baby. I'm right here. No, Paige! Latin is the ritual of choice for an Ethros. Good. Come on. - What? - I know how the priest was killed. When an Ethros is cast out, it seeks another body to inhabit. The demon leaves so rapidly, the inhabited rarely survives. - That's a problem. - I dare say. Ryan! - They're here. They're coming. - Mommy? No! Paige! Angel! Mommy, I'm so glad you're here. Paige, open the door. So glad.... Ryan, no! Ryan, stop it! Angel! - Let go of your mother. Let go! - Hurry! Listen to me, Ryan. I said, stop it! Let her go! It's retreated. - It's gone deeper. - That's likely. From now on, do exactly as I tell you. Understood? Anything? Ethros demon, Ethros box. This is what's used to trap it. The demon goes dingy when it's forced out. Bad sense of direction. With one of these, it'll go right into it. "Confined for a thousand years." It should work, but without one of these.... It'll try to make the jump to the nearest warm body. Right. So you're safe, anyway. Maybe we can build one of these. "An authentic Ethros box is made of 600 species of virgin woods... ...and handcrafted by blind Tibetan monks." Nope. Don't know any. Melrose and Robertson, next to the yogurt shop. Blind virgin monks? No, Rick's Majick 'n Stuff. He should have one. - Better hurry. - Okay. What's happening? Your Latin sucks. I know your tricks. You can't deter me from doing what must be done. You? Do something? You can't do anything. You couldn't even watch. Everybody knows you got fired. Nothing you do is right. Nothing's gonna make him proud of you. Skimming the surface of my mind. Very good. But a mere parlor trick. Here's one for you. How many crosses am I holding? Mistreated for years and still not good enough. Not good enough for Daddy, or the Council. That is to say.... Lose your place? You think these people want you around? I invited him here. You're stupider than he is. Tell him why he's a fool to trust you. Tell him how you plan to kill him. - That's not true. - He's afraid of you. I'll show you fear! Blessed be. Uh-huh. I need an Ethros box. A lady who knows what she wants. Yes. Just pop it in a bag and I'm out of here. - I don't have one. - You don't have one? Well, what's that? - That's a Shorshack box. - What's the diff? About $20. It's not available in a mahogany finish. Looks the same. Made by blind Tibetan monks? Made by mute Chinese nuns. That's craftsmanship. I have an Ethros demon and I need a box. Will this work? Probably. Shorshacks are smaller than an Ethros. Might be a tight fit. How big could the demon be? I mean, it's in a little-bitty boy. I'll take it. I think you'll enjoy this quality item. Shall I have it gift-wrapped? That was too close. I let my guard down. It won't happen again. You're not going back in there. It could've killed you, Wesley. And my son? What about him? - Angel, we don't have a choice. - The good fight, yeah? Guess who's here, Angel. He's talking to me right now. Doyle wants to ask why you couldn't protect him. - What are you doing? - Ending this. - So all they had was-- - Get it ready. You let him die. Just like he's gonna let me die. Aren't you, Daddy? Two great protectors. Get back. Do you renounce Satan? And all his works? And all his pomps? Now get the hell out! Ryan? Uh-oh. Plakticine! Clearly, it came up the elevator shaft. - So it's up here somewhere? - No, it's long gone by now. And good riddance to it. No, it'll possess again. We shouldn't have sent the Andersons home. It may repossess Ryan. I don't think so. Not right away. What are you thinking? It had to expel a lot of energy to escape like this. It'll need time to recharge. You think it's taken on corporeal form. It absorbs the elements it needs by manifesting itself physically. Which means if we find it in time, we can kill it. He needs a hostile environment that's damp... ...returning to primordial volcanic basalt for regeneration. - Huh? - Sea caves. Why didn't he just say that? We're close. Come on. Angel? Before we go any further, I want to assure you... ...since we'll be fighting side by side.... What the demon said before-- I know you're not planning to kill me. But you're willing to. And that's good. Now come on. - You. - Did you think this was over? You are a fool. You think to destroy me? These forces are beyond your comprehension. Yeah, well, it's a hobby of mine. You great putrescent bully! Pick on a child? You think you're impressive? I am Ethros! I corrupted men before they had speech to name me. The child was but the last among thousands. One more heart to corrupt. One more soul to suck dry. Well, chalk up one exciting failure. You didn't get that boy's soul. What soul? She has more marshmallows than I do. We'll have to write the Nestlé Bunny about that. Drink up. It's way past bedtime. Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? Nothing. That's what I found. No conscience, no fear, no humanity, Just a void, I couldn't control him, I didn't manifest until you brought me forth. I just sat and watched him destroy everything around him. Not from evil or any other reason. - He doesn't seem to remember any of it. - Good. That boy's mind was the worst hell I've known. The marbles, that was you. When he slept, I could whisper in him. I tried to get him to end his life. You put him in front of the car. I had given up hope. I'm not afraid of death. The only thing I fear is in that house. He's with his family. We have to hurry. Yes, you do. Good night, sweetheart. Ryan? - What's going on? - I don't know. - Open the door! - Ryan! - Ryan, open the door! - Ryan, sweetie! Ryan, open the door! Stephanie! Listen! Open the door! - Ryan, open this door! - Ryan! Open this door! Open the door now! Open this door, now! - What are you doing out there? - Stephanie! Ryan, open this door! Do you hear me?! Stephanie! Ryan, open this door now! Mom, Dad, help! - Stephanie! - Mom, Dad! - Stephanie! - Stephanie! Stephanie! Everybody out! Go! Go! Go! Social Services will take over now. They'll want to speak to your son. Can we see him? Not until tomorrow. - What'll happen to him? - We'll know after the evaluation. Thanks for coming by, Kate. I won't be able to cover for him anymore. They're gonna want to know about Ohio... ...and everything. I wanted to protect him. I know.
