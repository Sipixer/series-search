I got dosed with demon DNA for that man. Wesley's taking the baby away, for good. - Daniel! - It's the Quor-toth. Hi, Dad. - You're not alone. - I know. - You stole my son. - I kept your son alive. - What will he do? - Angel will deal with Holtz. - I can't. - You said you'd do anything for me. Hi. What you got there? I know you have grave concern for Angel's welfare, so I made Mock-na. Oh, Mock-na. Which is...? A soothing brew to relieve tension. - Kind of looks like muddy water. - Yes. The mud gives it body and flavor. There's no plock-weed in this dimension... ...so I made do with creeping fig and sour grass. Though it is not true Mock-na, it is very close. So it's mock Mock-na. Please. Well, that's.... I can feel the tension draining. And a little sediment going down the wrong-- Tasty. Might I relieve you by gently and then more rapidly rubbing your schlug-tee? I don't really.... Maybe later, at home. I don't feel comfortable doing it in the office, Groo. Doing it? - Sex. - You wish to have sex? What? No! Sh! I was proposing a massage of your schlug-tee, your tense neck muscle. But it is always an honor to make sex with you. Later, at home. I understand perfectly. Angel. Is not who I am, princess. I know. He's back. You didn't happen to hear? - Hear what? - Good. So how did it go? - I found Holtz. - And? I didn't kill him. Maybe you're growing as a person. What did you do? - We talked. - About Connor-- Steven. Yeah. Did he come home? No, he's still out with Gunn and Fred. You said "home." It's a long story, but Holtz wants what's best for him. And what's best for him is living here with us? That's great! Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you. Yes, it is a happy time. This didn't have to happen. Your father was gonna leave. - He just wanted to talk to Angelus. - Leave? Angelus won. He could've just walked away. It's my fault. - He'll pay. - I'll help you kill him. No. You don't want to kill him? After what he did? What do you want to do? This one might work better. He'd have southern exposure. Not too close to my room. I don't want him to feel like I'm hovering. But not too far. I want to keep an eye. What do you think? I think it's just as good as the last five we looked at. It's not about the room, it's about Connor-- I can't get used to calling him Steven. Neither can I. It's what Holtz-- It's what he wants to go by. Okay, Steven, Connor, whatever. It's about your son living here, getting to know his father. I don't even own a TV. He'll want to watch TV. Not too much. After homework and chores. He'll need clothes, weekly allowance. - What's good? 50 cents? A dollar? - Yeah... - ...if you're Tom Sawyer painting a fence. - See? I'm so out of touch. He's gonna hate me. No, he's not. He's gonna love you. How do you know? Because you're you. - Me. A vampire. - You. A vampire. Who drinks blood, stays in shadows and is older than all his friends combined. You're all those things, plus cheap. But none of that matters. Why not? Because you have the biggest and best heart of anyone I have ever known. He's a smart kid. He'll figure it out. It's gonna be all right. - You're really-- - Aren't I? Feeling better, or do you need to keep looking at rooms? Both. - He can have mine. - What do you mean? Leaving. On the midnight train to Georgia. Actually, it's the 9:18 p.m. flight to Vegas, but where's the poetry in that? Is this because of Connor? - Steven. - This is because of me. Buddy of mine's got a club, and he needs a singer and a seer. - What about rebuilding your club here? - That's a great idea. Except every time I do, you all destroy it. It was only...three times. I got the big love here, and I'm grateful, but it's time to move on. - But some of this is because-- - The not-so-little nipper? Not gonna lie. Kid's in the mix. Clearly not loving the demon-kind. I know it's his upbringing, but I loved that baby. I just wouldn't.... What? Turn my back on him anytime soon. No white cliffs? Not in this neck of the woods. Sorry. - Looks like where he came from, though. - England? Maybe it's like the ranch. - The ranch? - Where I was supposed to grow up. In Utah. He told you about that? - That was our dream. - He always told it. Before sleep. Him and me, where no one else could ever find us. Yeah. We should-- We need to bury him. No. I'll do it. No. He was bitten by the beast. He may rise again. You said you'd do anything for me. I will do as you taught me. I will cling to the good, and I will lay waste to the evil. Sleep now, Father. And forgive me. Mind if I join you? On many levels and with great intensity. How's your throat? You want a lozenge? Life's something, huh? One day you're pivotal in the battle. Next thing you know, you're on your own. No one even cares what you think anymore. Well, I care. You care? As one human being to another. Just kidding. I care that your great, big brain is going to waste. Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't Angel Jr. without precedent in human history? You're wrong. Mesopotamian, Greek, Hindi, Celtic myth, the Bible... ...even Darwin, all support the coming of something that wasn't possible before. Okay, the impossible is here. But what does it mean? Is it the herald of a new age, better things to come... ...or the mass destruction of everything we hold dear? Yes. Every child carries into the world the possibility of salvation or slaughter. And one born to two vampires carries it in spades. My people will root for slaughter. And your people-- Sorry, your former people... ...they won't know what to do if things turn sour. No. If the kid's the next Stalin, do you kill him? You can't. He's Angel's son. On the other hand, if you just watch while he kills Angel... ...or somebody else, that cute girl from Texas, say.... Wow. Times like this, glad I don't have a conscience. I think you should leave now. What was it like when she cut you? Are you terribly anxious to find out? - Nobody's here. - Good. Bad. We gotta find Angel and tell him we screwed up. I get your point. - Where is everybody? - I am here. Cordelia and Angel are upstairs trying out bedrooms. For Angel's son. I'm not telling a 16-year-old boy that. He's gotta know the facts of life. My record with the man-woman thing isn't.... I don't wanna say "tragic farce." - Why not? You're still telling him. - You could help. He'll have questions. Like, "What do you do with a woman's schlug-tee?" You and your vampire hearing. Next time you eavesdrop, I'm gonna.... Easy there, sailor. You use that kind of language at home? Where is he? - Uh.... - He ran away. He overheard us say you were going to Holtz. - Then that's where he went. - We were there. We didn't see them. All he'll find is an empty room. He won't know what's happened. - What's happened? - Holtz left. He wants Steven to live here. That's good! - As long as we tell him before-- - He is here. How can you tell him before he's--? Oh. Hey. You all right? I went to see my-- He wasn't there. Yeah. I'm sorry. He's-- He left, Steven. He gave me this letter for you. He says my place is here now. With you. It wouldn't have to be forever. Maybe just give it a try for a while. Okay. We'll give it a try. It's me. Can I come in? Brought you a bookcase and some of my favorite books when I was your age. Want to get some breakfast? Are you hungry? Not really. We can go out. I'd have to wear a burka or something. Hey, we'll stay in, hang out together. Tonight, we'll do something special. You ever been to a movie? No. We'll go to an action movie. You'll love it. Anything else you want to see or do, just say the word. There is one thing. What? I want to know how you do that. Fight? Yes. - You got that down pretty good already. - I want to learn... ...to be like you. Well, there might be a thing or two that I could show you. Stake! Vampire! Behind you. Civilian! Protect her. Protect her! Where's your balance, huh? You lose it... ...you lose. Don't worry, I got you. - You're doing good, kid. You got heart. - I want to be the vampire. - I wanna be in a hot tub. - Who's gonna clean this stuff up? Yeah, it's been a long day. - Had enough? - No. I want to learn. Is this kid a chip off the old block or what, huh? - He's chippy. - Hey, Cor... - ...do you wanna go to the movies? - Yeah! I mean, I'd like to. I can't. Groo and I are supposed to... ...have some one-on-one time, so.... Right. You should do that. Okay. Vampire. You're a vampire, you're not in Cats, - Innocent bystander. - By-sitter. Close your eyes. Feel it. Where's the attack gonna come from? Good. Good! Hi, honey. It's me. And I got your favorites: tuna and ice cream. How about tonight you try not mixing it together? There you are. Wow, you look nice. What's wrong? I am. Wrong. For you. What? I am not the one you love. He is. He is? Who "he"? Yo. - Hey, Lorne. Come on in. - Well, you're in a good mood. Yeah. Taking the kid to the movies. He's gonna love it. No subtitles or dreary leitmotif, all bloody action? - You bet. - He'll love you for it. I thought I'd stop by and say arrivederci, Angel-hair. - You're really going. - I'm really going. - Sorry. - Don't be. Here. I got you something to remember me by. "Songs for the Love. Lorne." I get it. - "Lovelorn" because your name's Lorne. - My publicist's idea. Her name's mud now, but the tunes are good. And that's not my real gift. This is. It's mutual. The way you feel about Cordelia is how she feels about you. I love Angel? What are you talking about? I love... ...you know, us. You two are so obviously connected. - You finish each other's... - ...sentences, you laugh at the same... ...jests. When he grieves, when he is hurting.... Her heart breaks for you. In my heart I've known the truth for some time. I have just been struggling to find the courage to do what is right. Bubelah, stay open. Connor's back, your whole life's coming together. Sometimes things do work out. I gotta skidoo. Take good care of yourself. And keep in touch. I'll drop you a line. Let you know where to send the gift basket. I don't know what to say, Groo. Tell me I am wrong. That I should stay. That you love only me. Pretty cool, huh? You emptied the jumbo tub? Free refills. - I love this woman. - Sh! Don't skimp on the butter. It's all right. It's make-believe. How'd they do that? Go, go, go! Get down! Out! Tie me up, threaten me with sharp objects, but don't let me go. Chowder-head. Kid's pretty good. I can't wait to get my hands on him, cut him open, see what makes him tick. - Get back! - No, - He wants to protect his son. - We were counting on that. What weren't you counting on? - Get off! - The kid wanting to protect him. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Abort! Abort! Abort! Abort! Drive! Drive! Okay. Easy. - Now we're even. - Now you're dead. What, you're gonna kill a human in front of your son? Set an example? I vote yes. You're not human. We should probably both-- Stay away from my father. I'm not your enemy. We can help you, Steven. My name is Connor. Let's go home. I don't feel.... And even if I did, it's impossible. - It's ridiculous. - That's right, it's-- Whoa. Maybe on some level I've always known it's true. I have? It is? - I'm in love. - I am? I am. With Angel, right? - With Angel. - Just checking. I'm scared. But I know it's right. I know somehow it's all gonna be all right. It is? Really? Thanks for the tip. I got it! He's whistling. Never heard him whistle. He's happy. - Angel Investigations. We can help you. - Hi, - It's me. - Hi, Cor. - How are you? - I'm good. You? - I'm pretty good. - Angel... ...I need to talk to you in person. Is it something bad? No. No, it's something good, I think. It sort of depends on how you feel. - About what? - Well, about me. Oh. Could you meet me tonight? Tonight? Sure. Okay. Where? I love Point Dume, There's a viewpoint, it's the first turn north of Kanan, - Really pretty spot. - Point Dume, viewpoint, First turn north of Kanan. We'll meet there. - About an hour? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. - Yes. - Good, Okay, then, we'll do that, Oh, God, oh, God. - I have to go out for a while, son. - With Cordelia? Yeah. You gonna be all right? She's beautiful. And she cares about you. I like her. I'm glad. It's good to see you happy, Dad. - Now he's humming. - He's really happy. - But not perfectly happy, I hope. - No. Just checking. You know that sinking feeling you sometimes get the morning after? It arrived early. It's like a little death. Several, in fact. Get out. What, no sweet kiss? No "When can I see you again?" Watch the dirty looks. That's what got me going in the first place. I'll give you this: You sure know how to channel your rage, frustration and hate. Always a bigger turn-on than love. You still here? I'm starting to like you. But don't go making more of this than it is. I'm not one of the doe-eyed girls of Angel Investigations. Don't be thinking about me when I'm gone. I wasn't thinking about you when you were here. So your former boss has a soul, and you're losing yours. Well, you're just new all over, aren't you? Slowpoke! I'm late, I'm late. And it's not a date. I hate those things. We're just gonna talk like two grown-up adults. I have some feelings. He may have some feelings. He may not even know I'm insane until he hears my feelings. Oh, no. No, no, no! Not now! Oh, sh-- Connor. Dad. What are you doing here? We're family, and I wanted to show you how I feel about that. Connor. It's all about balance. You lose it... You lose. Don't be... ...frightened. - It's a little late for that. - Sorry. You remember me? I'm-- Yeah. Skip. You tend to remember your demon guides. What is going on? I think you know. I'm dying. No, no. You're not dying. - Not dying? - No. - Say that part first. - Sorry. It's not the end, it's the beginning. You're a great warrior, Cordelia. The battle we're all a part of is fought on many different planes and dimensions. You've outgrown this one. You've become a higher being. - Me? - You. You took on the visions at the cost of a happy, normal life... ...and even when they were killing you, you wouldn't let them go. The big test was The Powers making you part demon. They bet the farm on you. Power corrupts, and they gave you a lot of power. The glow-y thing. Which you used well, to fight evil and heal Connor.... And only that one time as a night-light. Bad dreams. Skip, I don't understand. I think you do. It's ridiculous. I'm just a somewhat normal girl... ...who has visions, glows and sometimes blows things up with her new power. - I'm a higher being. - Yes. And when you say I've "outgrown this level," it sort of implies-- You're moving on to a new one. - Now I'm really scared. - I know. - I also know you're ready. - Oh, no, I'm not. The universe begs to differ. - And deep down inside, I think-- - Yes. All right? Stop saying I know. Maybe I do know. Maybe, if given enough time, I might even get used to the idea. But... ...I don't have enough time, do I? Easy. Talk to me. Talk to me. - Okay? - Okay. I don't know what's wrong with you, but you're gonna talk! No. Of course not. Why would The Powers give me time for the most important talk of my life? I'm on my way to-- I'm in love, with Angel. What you're being called to do transcends love. How is that fair? I can't leave without telling him. I won't. He has to know how I feel. Why does this have to be now? There's work to be done in the higher realms. Can you at least tell Angel for me? Sorry. Not allowed. Then I'm not going. How could they possibly do this to me now? This is the last test, isn't it? Connor... ...why are you doing this? You murdered my father. No, I didn't. I swear. He's lying. I'm not lying. She knows it. You're the prince of lies. That's why you wouldn't let them kill me at the drive-in. So you could. Killing is too good for you. You don't get to die. You get to live. Forever. Cordelia? I ever encounter those Powers That Be, we're gonna have a talk. A big talk. You're doing the right thing. I'm scared. But I know it's right. I know somehow it's all gonna be all right. What do I do? Just say yes. I already have. Some day you'll learn the truth, and you'll hate yourself. Don't. It's not your fault. - I don't blame you. - Liar! Listen to me. I love you. Never forget that. Connor! Connor, never forget that I'm your father and that I love you. Connor! Connor! Connor didn't want to come for a midnight snack? It's okay. I'll scrounge something up here. He's not in his room. You didn't see him? No. He's gone? Again? Did you ask Lorne if--? No, because Lorne doesn't live here anymore. Not used to that yet. I'm sure Connor'll-- I'm sure it's nothing, but we should tell Cordelia or Angel.
