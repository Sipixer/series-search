- I didn't. He's been down there for three months, and you knew. - I believe you're looking for this. - What you did to me is unbelievable. I love you, Connor. Now, get out of my house. - I had to raise him. - For what? Fighting people like you. What you're being called to do transcends love. - You've become a higher being. CORDELIA: Me? ANGEL: I need Cordy. Now. The Axis of Pythia. It's an ancient relic... ...said to be able to find souls or entities across dimensions. ANGEL: Entities like: - Cordelia. ANGEL: There was all this light around her, made up of pure joy. It felt sort of permanent. - Cordelia? - Who are you people? Try it again, honey. [ENGINE FAILING TO START] Let's see. Yeah, one more time. He's just making it worse. Your father's trying to get us home. You okay? Dad! Can I help you? You're in trouble. No, we're fine. I like your hat. Really, thanks for stopping, but we've already called for help. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, you guys are just in time. Not sure if we need a jump or a tow. I will jump! [SCREAMING] BO Y: No, Mom! Mom! You okay? CONNOR: Hey. Is that your family? Dad! WOMAN: Oh, honey. BO Y: You all right, Dad? GUNN: Okay, but three is where I draw the... ANGEL: Cordelia? Who are you people? My God, it's you. You're back. Don't you remember? Angel. Um, you see her too, right? I'm not just... No, man, it's real. It's okay. We're friends. You know us. Fred? Gunn? You're dazed, or something must... Thank God you're back. So we know each other? Yeah. Really well. Okay. Um... Who am I? Slouching Toward Bethlehem ANGEL: What do you remember? I don't know. Numbers. Animals. Flossing. - But not us? - Or me. I don't remember me. You're Cordelia Chase. You work here, with us. You've been gone for a while, but you're safe now. It's okay. We're friends. We're here to help you. - I've been gone? - What's important is that you're back. Are there other people here? FRED: Um, not to sound all movie-of-the-week... ...but I think you might have some kind of amnesia. Like, maybe you fell or banged your head. Shall we take her to a hospital? Hospital? I don't need a... Not yet. Maybe later. I don't think seeing a doctor will solve her problems. Neither will seeing green. You know what might help you remember? Seeing your things. You want to check for her things in the garden? GUNN: Checking away. ANGEL: Hey, Fred. You want to help me look in the office? Sure. Excuse us. That could have been a disaster. "Hi. Welcome back. You're safe. By the way, there's a green demon behind you." Do you think we should tell her? We live in a world of demons. She's bound to find out. Yeah, sure. But let's be smart. I want her to remember who I am before... ...I freak her out with the "undead, drinks blood" part of my resume. Angel, aren't you curious about why she's back? I hadn't even... I was just so happy to see her. Why is she back? I don't know. But if Cordy's been where we think she has... ...anything's possible. Okay, that's creepy. So's that. Couldn't really find anything of yours in the office. That's okay. [PHONE RINGING] - Shouldn't someone answer that? - The machine will get it. You really don't have to be afraid. Easy for you to say. I don't know that. Don't know you, this place. CORDELIA'S VOICE: We canâ€™t come to the phone right now. - But if you leave your name and number... - But that voice... Thanks, and wait for the beep. Oh, my God. It's me. MAN: <i>Yeah, this is Murray</i> down at the spa. Listen... I work here. You better get down here. That demon broad came back. Looks like she's gonna try and hatch her blood-sucking little... We're here! Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be right there. Did he say demon broad? Yeah. His, um, wife. It's an ugly divorce-case thing. You know, private-eye stuff. I should get Charles and terminate it, before the situation multiplies. Okay. I'll just stay here and help Cordelia settle in. - So... - I want to go home. You know where I live? This is it? Everything? ANGEL: Fred and Gunn moved everything over... ...from your old apartment after you... You remember that? You wore it when we went to the ballet. The ballet? For real? You and me? We all went, but, yeah. It was pretty special. I thought maybe you'd remember, because... It's too bad. We had a... ...really good time. Working together too. I wish I could remember. Me too. I want to help you get those memories back. Great. But not tonight. I understand. If you need any... I will. You really are among friends. Cordelia. Hi, I'm Cordy. I'm Cordelia Chase. I'm... Just breathe. Just breathe. Sunnydale. Okay, popular. No real surprise there. "Cordelia, homeroom was fun. Too bad it burned to the ground." What? "Hey, how about that giant snake?" "Dear Cordelia, thanks for the flaming arrows." Flaming arrows? That's cute. Cute. Hot. Yikes! Okay, out from the mental ward. Cute again. Was I a spy? Whose...? [SIGHS] [MAN SINGING IN DISTANCE] LORNE: Okay, okay, jughead, that's enough, that's enough. Look, I'll make this simple. You? You have an addiction. You know it and I know it. If you don't stop snacking... ...on you-know-who's, you're gonna end up on the wrong end of you know... [SNIFFING] What? Hello? Somebody down here? [RATTLING] Hello? Oh, my God. [DOOR OPENS] GUNN: How much do I hate those nasty babies? Tell me about it. I couldn't squish-squash fast enough. I know we get paid to do it, but that's the kind of mayhem I'd do for free. FRED: I'm gonna be washing their brains out of my hair for a week. GUNN: Turn around. FRED: What? GUNN: You don't want to know. FRED: We should go upstairs. Cordelia doesn't want to know we do this exterminating. GUNN: Almost got it. When will fang boy come clean with her? Spill the really real? FRED: I'm sure the time will present itself. It's okay! Cordelia... I can explain. Wow. How did I...? I am a spy. I get it now. You're all spies. Probably Russian. You brainwashed me to believe we're friends... ...so I spill the beans about some nano-techno thing you want. - So I look Russian to you? - Black Russian. - That's a drink. - Says the head spy. Nobody here is a spy. Those two guys are lawyers, weird as that may seem... ...from Wolfram and Hart. They must know you're back. - Keep her in the hotel so she's safe. - Safe? Is that some kind of joke? Your friends here were just talking about murdering children. And there's singing and blood and pointy things. And did I mention the singing? I mean, what the hell is going on here, Angie? - Angel. - Whatever. I know things seem weird, maybe even scary. You have to believe me when I say we're trying to do all we can... ...to help you get through this difficult time. The Cordelia that we know... ...the person who you're trying to remember, is very much at home here... ...bizarre as that may seem. So I ask you to look inside... ...to believe me when I tell you that you're safe... ...and you're among friends who only want the best for you. I believe you. So I'm not a spy? No. Am I a mom? That's my son. That's Connor. But, no, you're not his mother. So we weren't a happy family? Not like that. And you and me? We weren't...? Weren't... Together. Not exactly. - Was I a nun? - A what? Were we not a happy family because I was a nun? I was going through my stuff and I found all these. Get off me! I'm getting, I'm getting! Just stop with the clobbering! Cordelia, stop it. It's okay. He's with us. Hey, if this was about that missing lingerie, that was for a friend. Tell me it's Halloween and he isn't what I think. Trick or treat. Don't you remember Lorne? You're old buddies. You want to know why we call him Lorne? What I want is answers, and I want them now, mister. Okay. Maybe we haven't been 100 percent honest because, well... ...we were afraid the truth would scare you. Yeah, and the lying and deceit have been so comforting. You're right. Our mistake. I think it's time we came clean about everything. That's everything? It all makes perfect sense now. I was a cheerleader, a princess and a warrior. And I have visions and super powers. And I'm the target of an evil law firm because I've spent the last three... ...months living on a higher plane, fighting for the forces of good... ...who wage a battle against demons and evilies and squishy bug babies... ...because all that stuff's real, and that's the world I live in. I think I know why I don't remember any of this, because, hey, who'd want to? Um... Sea Breeze? I know it's a lot to take in. Says the vampire with a soul and his wacky gang of sidekicks. Not a sidekick. I think there's a way we might be able to sort this out. - Pick a song. - Yeah. What? - So Lorne can read you. - You sing, he sees your future. Hopefully he can explain what happened and how to get your memory back. I can't just sing. I don't even know if I'm musical. - Am I? - Sure. You remember any songs? Well, there are so many. How do I pick? It doesn't really matter. Kind of a ballad man myself, but just pick anything. [SINGING "GREATEST LOVE OF ALL"] Does he look a little green to you? I mean, more than usual? Great. Enough. Okay! You were great. You were great. Everything's great. We're all just... I see a very, very, um... Was I really that bad? It wasn't you. It was the song. It reminds him of, um... Oh, come on. You guys aren't even good liars. This is ridiculous. - Where you going? - Out. Away. - Does it matter? - But it's not safe. - Oh, right. Because of evil ninja law firm. - We'll come with, just in case. You keep saying I was a higher being. Don't make me turn you into a rat. Can she do that? Come on. How about a sandwich? Let's go to the kitchen. - We have cookies. - I don't want a sandwich. I don't want cookies. I want to talk to Angel, sans sidekicks. I am not a sidekick. Lorne? - Talk to me. What did you see? - Go away. If it's that bad, I need to know. It's that bad. Good night. - I need details. - I got none. Just a splitting migraine, a tummy full of rattlesnakes... ...and a suspicion I'm gonna lose my lunch if I don't start drinking myself silly. Come on, Lorne. You gotta give me something. Do the words "slouching towards Bethlehem" ring a bell? Or how about "despair, torment, terror"? And I'm not referring to missy's choice of song. Although that was horrifying in its own right. What I saw was jumbled. It was pieces, flashes. It made my skin crawl away and scamper under the bed. Evil's coming, Angel, and it's planning on staying. It's not a secret. What isn't a secret? Us. The firm knows that we're... ...doing this. Isn't it their job to know this sort of thing? The sordid details of their employees' lives? Yeah. I just thought I should tell you. Sordid. [MEOWS] Angel knows too. I don't work for Angel anymore. And I could care less what he thinks. You faker. That's what you said when he was sleeping with the fishes. We both know how that played out. That was different. So Angel knows about our relationship. Big deal. - A dollar. You owe me a dollar. - Oh, damn. You called this a relationship. You lost the bet. You said it first. Sign it first, as proof. Proof of what? Of now. Of this. How big is this dump? Angel? Mr. Bumpy Face? Hello? [RATTLING] [FLOORBOARD SQUEAKING] Look, I don't want cookies or juice... ...or you two following me around. So just back off. You smell good. What do you want? I want a snack. - You're not safe here. - You think? Can you get me out of here? ANGEL: How could you let her wander off alone? The words "grown woman" come to mind. The gal has a history of whupping ass. You saw the hurting... ...she put on the Wolfram and Hart dudes. Could she turn me into a rat? What if Wolfram and Hart came back? What if there were hundreds of those things? What if this is how it starts? The slouching and the Bethlehem. And they've taken her because of what she knows. - Even if she can't remember. - Have you been caffeinating your blood? Is there something you're not telling us? There's a something, but this isn't it. That was a client of mine who had a fatal habit of snacking on humans. - And you let it in here with Cordy. FRED: Hello? Back to the something. Is that why you ran out while Cordelia sang? Well, A, I wasn't running, I was fleeing, and B, yes. How horrible is this thing? I haven't read the Book of Revelations lately but I'd probably start there. Well, is that all you saw? That was the tip of the berg, pumpkin nut. What I got from Cordy was dense. A big, fat, tummy-clenching onion from hell. The more layers you peel, the more you cry. Or vomit, in this case. But I'll tell you, this is one itch that Daddy's done scratching. Look, we've gotta find Cordelia before... We have to find her. She's out there alone with no memory. Probably terrified. CORDELIA: How cool is that? CONNOR: I love that one. I wish I had killed it. CORDELIA: Funny way to express your affection. I love you. Bang, you're dead. I gotta ask. Why were you at the hotel? - You live there? CONNOR: No. CORDELIA: Just decided to drop by? CONNOR: I saw you were back. So we know each other? We're friends? You were nice to me once. What about the others? You friends with them? CONNOR: This way. Um, if we're going to be climbing ladders together, maybe... ...you could throw a name at me. - Connor. Connor? Really? That's funny. Angel has a baby named Connor. Did he name it after...? Oh, my God. You're him. You're Angel's son. It's not like I got to choose. What is this place? CONNOR: Home. This is home? If you're Angel's son, why don't you live with him? CONNOR: They didn't tell you? I sunk him to the bottom of the ocean. To punish him. You're serious. I tried to kill you too. I was new to this world. Didn't understand. Put a knife to your throat. Sorry. Thank you. You're the first person who's been straight with me. Who's told me the truth. That means a lot. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [GROANS] Yeah? Hold on. She's back? And you got a positive visual of her? You're sure that it's her? She's with the kid? That's unexpected. No, I'm here. Put an extraction team together. I'm on my way. - You're leaving? LILAH: No rest... ...for the wicked. You should go back to sleep. Do you really have to go? Why? You missing me already? CORDELIA: You're not leaving. - I thought you were sleeping. CORDELIA: Just don't go, okay? I'm locking the door. You're safe. CORDELIA: Then why am I so scared? I'm trying to remember... ...little things. Do I have brothers and sisters? What's my favorite food? Who was my first kiss? There's nothing there. Just... ...an empty... Do you know how Lonely that makes me feel? You like shoes. And donuts. And you're very brave. CORDELIA: Really? Donuts? And you're brave. When was I brave? Now. Tonight. You've lost everything... ...and you're still strong. I have this horrible feeling that something bad is gonna happen... ...or maybe has happened, and I can't remember it. And I don't know what to do or who to trust... ...except you. I don't know why... ...but I trust you. Why do I get the feeling that you've lost everything too? I had nothing to lose. Don't go too far, okay? FRED: She's gotta be somewhere close. - Then Angel will find her. What if she's not on her own? What if she's been taken or... She's out there somewhere. ANGEL: Nothing. We're gonna have to widen the search. Call hospitals, police stations. She couldn't have just disappeared. Okay, once, but not again. Somebody has to know where Cordelia is. WESLEY: I do. A bit careless, misplacing her after all the effort to find her. We didn't find her. She just showed up. With no memory, no idea who she is or where she's been. Fresh start. Doesn't sound so bad. What do you know? Wolfram and Hart are planning to extract her. Already tried. They'll try again. She might have spent time with the Powers That Be. Wolfram and Hart will consider her valuable. And I doubt your boy will be able to stop them. My... She's with Connor. You have that on good authority? You don't seem too concerned. Connor's my son. I'm sure he's taking excellent care of her. [GASPS] Someone's here. - Do you remember how to fight? - What? They're coming for you. I set traps. But you'll have to fight. Do you know how? One way to find out. Cordelia! Aren't you the stud. CARLO: Ms. Morgan. It's done. Mm. Music to my ears, Carlo. I'm going home. Tell the boys it's fourth and 10. All units punt. - I repeat, punt. MAN: Let's go, let's go! That's right, monkey boys, don't mess with the Big Dog. It's better than "sidekick." Did they hurt you? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I didn't expect so many. You tried. I appreciate it. And I really like what you've... ...done with the... Nice. We should probably get you back home. Actually, I'd like to stay here... ...with Connor. I don't think that's the best idea. Connor's a great fighter. I helped train him. But you need more than just muscle right now. You're right. I need someone who won't lie to me, like you did. All of you, I know you were trying to help. But the truth is the only way to do that. And that's what Connor's given to me. Keep her safe. If it makes you feel better, I would have chosen you. Thanks. But no, it doesn't. Hey, just remember, man, it's not really Cordy. Well, not all of her. Maybe she's right. Maybe we should've just spilled everything from the start. Played it all card-up. You mean demons and monsters and vamps card-up? Wouldn't have worked. She's confused is all. Give her time, she'll see the truth. - Who the real champion is. - Damn straight. If Team Angel hadn't shown up, Wolfram and Hart would have... [CREAKING] - Oh, my God. - Lorne? Is he alive? What happened? Who did this? - Wo... - Wesley? Not again? - Wolfram and Hart. - Okay, but why? - I thought Cordy was their target. - They must know Lorne read her. Wait. Are you saying that Connor's place was a decoy? We fell for it like rookies. They weren't after Cordy. They were after what Lorne saw when she sang. - They sucked it out of his head? - How much? What did they get? They had a demon. I wouldn't talk. And the thing burrowed inside... ...and took Cordy out. ANGEL: Lorne? How much did they get? All of it. They tricked us. Wolfram and Hart or Wesley? He showed up with the tip about Junior. How do we know he's not playing us? We don't. But Wolfram and Hart may know more about Cordy's doom-and-gloom thing... ...than we do. And that's a problem. [KNOCKING] - Oh, a drop-by. That's a surprise. - Is it? Well, that it took you so long, yeah. You played me. LILAH: You played yourself. On the phone. You wanted me to hear that so I would tell Angel. Free will. - Look it up. - Lilah... I was just doing my job. You're the one who decided to take what you overheard... ...and give it to the good and plentys. So before you go all righteous fury... ...figure out who you're really mad at here. - What was the real plan? LILAH: Let's just say... ...I could have Lorne's brain in a jar but I left it in his head since he's your friend. What's that supposed to do? Lull me into trusting you again? If I thought you'd ever trust me, I would've never played you like that. It's never simple, is it?
