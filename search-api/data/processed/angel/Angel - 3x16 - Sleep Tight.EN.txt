- Got it? How? - Swiped it. Things have been slow since Cordelia and the Groosalugg left. You've been holed up with all those prophecies and books. You okay? That the vampire will devour his child is certain. - When will it happen? - It's already started. The evil beside you. Earthquake, fire, blood. - It's okay. - Earthquake, fire, blood. Jeez, Wes. Don't you know what you're supposed to do? You pick them up when they fuss. Daddy's here. Sorry, I don't know what I was-- I didn't sleep well. You look like hell. And not the fun one, where they burn you for all eternity... ...but the hard-core one. You know, Nixon and Britney Spears. - You're awfully chipper today. - Yeah, it's weird. Maybe it was the earthquake, but I barely slept, and I have all this energy. I could drink a horse. Speaking of earthquake... - ...you realize we have no insurance. - Yeah, bummer. - And your room is-- - The wreck of the Hesperus. Don't worry. The best part about owning a hotel is there's plenty of rooms. I'll move to another one till it's fixed. Who is that singing? - Lorne's seeing a client in the garden. - She's good. Do you want to see the lady sing? I fell so far A light went on in my heart You're gone Now I'm left alone in the dark Do you see anything? I see you're plenty scared. It's all right, keep going. My soul is aching Hey, now, no fussing. Do you wanna see something cool? Sure you do. Look. You like that broadsword? That's your old man's favorite. Wes, he's gonna be crawling in no time. We gotta start baby-proofing this place. Take him. Yeah, it's all right, it's your Uncle Wes. He loves you bunches. He's just English. Are you crazy? It's the best state. What's wrong with Texas? Texas doesn't hate the black man. Texas loves the black man. Well, most of Texas. Anyone with a brain. - What's so great about California? - Everything. It's got the climate... - ...the ocean. - The earth that swallows you whole. - The Lakers, the music. - The traffic... - ...the smog. - It's got you. - Okay, you win. Morning. - Hi. Glad to see you're using the company phones for important calls. - Want me to pay? - Chain them up. - What? - Let's chain and lock the weapons. Better safe than sorry. Isn't that right? He likes you, I can tell. I like him too. I was thinking perhaps I'd take him to the park or beach. Just the two of us. Maybe in the next day or two. Sounds great. Count on it. Guys, there's something you should-- Can you come here for a sec? Everybody, this is my friend Kim. It's all right, they're professionals. Take it from the chorus. My heart is breaking In two No love No light left, no you I'll hack your eyeballs out and rip your children in two! It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Catchy finish, huh? Kim came to see me a couple of years ago. You put me on my true path. She was wasting in medical school when she should've been a singer. Who needs more doctors when you can have singing demons? The demon part is new. Singing demons, flying nuns. Good one, G. She hooked up with this band recently and-- They were mellow. Organic types. Never did drugs or played a diminished chord. I like nuns. How did the Flying Nun fly, anyway? Was it God or magic? What? You think about these things sometimes. Please, continue. They started changing. Stevie, the lead guitar, grew a seventh finger. - Seventh? - He already had six. I just thought-- I don't know what I thought. Raw, the drummer, sprouted this spiny thing on his back... ...and they started playing this beyond industrial, trash-noise funk. Day and night. And then it happened to me. You saw it. - Am I gonna turn into that? - No. You're human, they're not. It isn't permanent. It's an infection. It's cured by taking 2O milligrams of cylenthiam twice a day for a month. A mystical antibiotic. I'll get you some. I thought your saliva was suspect, being green and all. No offense, Lorne. Under the microscope, it showed traces of penloxia. - They're Wraith-ers. - Wraith-ers? Demons that can make themselves look human for a time. Then they revert to what they really are. - Why look like musicians? - For the chicks. Musicians get the chicks. They're gonna appear as dentists? Let's take them out. - Where are they? - In the rehearsal space. It's an old loading dock behind the Shop 'n' Go in Echo Park. Wes? You have to kill Wraith-ers. You, Gunn and Fred go. Lorne, stay with the baby. I have some business to do. Shouldn't we call Cordelia and the Groosalugg back into action? If one of us gets hurt, say, killing Wraith-ers, we'll need some backup. I don't want to disturb her. It's just a couple of Wraith-ers. Three, actually. Piece of cake. I'm up for a little kick-ass. Who's with me? Good. He'd be sucking the life out of you right now. Never take your eyes off a vampire. Feel where your fellow soldiers are. Trust each other with your lives. Never, ever trust a bloodsucker. Keep practicing. Get him up. - I don't like it. - They'll learn, or they'll die. Not that. They're coming right along. I don't like tea in these cotton cups. It's called Styrofoam. I'll get you some china ones. Thank you, Justine. Are you ready? Yes. - What are you not sure of? Is it me? - No. It's these people that work for Angel. We may end up killing a lot of them. We might kill them all. I'd follow you to the gates of hell to kill vampires, Daniel. But people... ...even evil people who help vampires, are another kettle of fish? They chose Angel. That makes them enemy soldiers. So I guess that makes it all right. Mr. Wyndam-Price. - Nice to see you again. - What the hell do you want? Don't be rude, Justine. He's our guest. And in the throes of a very difficult decision, I imagine. You want some apple? I hate your zit-face smile That's why I cut it in two Scoop out your blood Your brain, your bowls And when I'm done with you I throg your mother, brother Uncle, sister And your little dog too Dude, you're paying for that window. - No, I'm not. - Are you the A and R guys? This isn't even the whole band. We got a killer chick who sings. Hey, baby. Don't worry about the window, homes. We're not the A and R guys. We're just here to kill you. Dude, they want to kill us. Okay. But they're still paying for the window. I got first ride on the hottie. - Get them out of here. - Be careful. Come on, take it like a demon. That was fun. I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Your soldiers or mine. I share your hatred of violence. I've meted out less of it than Angelus has. - Angel. - Whatever you wish to call him. I will never agree that he's absolved from his past by the presence of a soul. He's a vampire. End of discussion. And I bet you a dollar this one's here to stab us in the back. Who did you lose? What? You're here in Holtz's army, ready to kill others, die for the cause.... You must have lost someone very important to you. That's not your business. Her twin sister, Julia, was murdered by vampires. You lost family. I'm sorry. Angel and the people I work with are my family. When I say I don't want to see anyone get hurt... ...I mostly mean them. But I don't stab people in the back. You're an honest man. I trust you. - And you can trust me. - It's funny, I don't. Your problem isn't me. Your problem is your friend who's gonna kill his child. You know you have to do something about it. You know if you don't, I will. Don't misunderstand me. I won't stand by while an innocent child is murdered. But I won't endanger other innocent lives unless I'm forced to. How long do I have? I'll give you one day. You may not trust me, but I trust you to do what's right. One day. After that... ...everyone will get hurt. So Sammy's at the Flamingo. Frank, Dino, Peter, Joey and Shirley are all front row center. Sammy starts singing "I Did It My Way. " Then he stops and says, "I can't sing this song in front of you, Frank. " The crowd loves it. They're laughing. Then Frank calls out, "Hey, you're short... ...you're one-eyed, and you're Jewish. Don't be intimidated." And the crowd goes wild. - How'd it go? - The Wraith-ers are no more. - Tore them apart. - Literally. He has been so good the whole time his daddy's been gone. Do you miss your daddy? He's here. I think Connor needs some papa love. He needs a lot of things. All day, every day. That's how kids-- He needs a bath, he needs a bottle. What Connor needs is to grow up. - Something wrong? - No, everything's great. I got a kid that cries, pees, moans, and never gives me a moment to myself. - It's all right. - It's really not. Connor, shut up! - Don't yell at him. He's just a baby. - He keeps it up, he won't be. You better get a grip. What's wrong with me? - Something's not right. - You could say that. When did you start drinking so much blood? - I don't know. A few days ago. - Where'd you get it? Same butcher as always. It's pig's blood. This last batch just seemed so much more.... What? Tasty. You were hyped this morning, then you went all Tyson on those demons. Then you crashed, had another drink, then you started throwing things. Like my Aunt Viola and her Southern Comfort. Hey, vampire. Need to drink something red. Doesn't make me a blood-aholic. Unless someone's spiking your drink. Let's find out. Daddy! Hey, there, kiddo. How's my boy, huh? - Hi, honey. - Hey. For God's sake. I know you're better at following people than this. So, what's the play? I just need to talk to you. I'm alone. He doesn't know that I'm.... - I want to talk to you about him. - Holtz? Great guy. Not overly tall. Is this the part where you offer to help me behind his back? Do you believe in anything? Or is it all just a big scam to you? You're a soldier. I respect that. You think your boss is noble and good. I respect that. Trouble is, he's not. - You work with a vampire. - Who, in fact, is noble and good. Quirky, but there it is. Holtz talks about justice, but he wants revenge. He's driven by it, blinded by it. He'll kill anybody who gets in his way. You're wrong. You don't know him. All that he's done for me, for us all.... It sounds like a nice cult. He gave you his word. He'll keep it. You're the one who's blind. How so? What you're about to do to your friend. It's easier to hate Holtz than yourself. There's enough to go around for both him and me. Be careful. You are being careful. I didn't even hear you leave. Want to hold him? He's sleeping. Maybe it's not such a good idea right now. So there's more to pig's blood than meets the eye. - There's just a trace of-- - Human blood in it. I feel it. It's his. It's Connor's. How do you know that? The past couple of days, he's smelled like food. They've been feeding you your son's blood so you'll like it and want more. Who's "they"? Who do you think? Like a cat. Can't hear you... ...but I'm starting to be able to feel you when you're near. Isn't that nice and creepy? - How'd you find me? - Your assistant. - I'll have his arms broken. - Already taken care of. And am I next? Lilah, there are so many things I could do to you. With transfusions, I could keep you alive indefinitely. I am experienced. My own son. How could you? It's my job. Don't you get tired of the femme fatale act? Whiskey, straight. Lots of it. How about just once you talk to me like a person? I've been doing this a long damn time. I've had to be better, smarter, quicker than every man at Wolfram & Hart. So it's a feminist thing. It's on her. It's a survival thing. I made a lot of devil's bargains, and I stuck to them. As a result, I live somewhat dangerously and quite comfortably. My mother, who doesn't recognize me, has the best room at the clinic. I put on my game face and do what I have to. You wear a game face long enough, it stops being removable. Wow. We have spent so much time and money on you... ...you're so pivotal to the coming cataclysms, I forget how dense you are. The game face, the one I worked so hard to get, I became that years ago. Just like you've become simpering and good from yours. You're the poster boy for human. Thank you, I don't want it. Speaking as one non-human to another, I'm sorry if I hit a nerve. You think you can awaken some buried spark of decency in me? Is that the way you "help your helpless"? I am not helpless. I'm glad you came. I was feeling a little... ... "what's it all about?" And now I know. It is all about making the rest of your eternal life miserable. Shall we drink to that? You backstabbing, traitorous bitch. I have a lot of work to do. I can't be in every time-space at once. And I find you drinking with my sworn enemy. Sworn enemy? Really? Have we met? Because I don't remember swearing. Sahjhan, he found me. So you all are in cahoots. Ethereal time-traveling demon.... You're the screwball that brought Holtz back. How's that working out? He's not fond of demons. You'll learn nothing from me. Other than, you're his sworn enemy who brought Holtz back... ...and when that failed, you came to me. Idiot. You think my life is easy? I'm jumping from dimension to dimension. I don't always hear. Sometimes it's just a visual. I saw you two all chummy. So why do you want to kill me? He wouldn't tell me either. Not that I need a reason. I was just curious. Did he boink your demon bride? Eat your mother? You really don't know who he is. You will pay. For what? Well, whatever his grudge, I think you just made him madder. What are you doing? Hi. I'm taking Connor. Where? To my place. We're going to the park in the morning. Angel knows all about it. - Are Fred and Gunn--? - Out. Getting food. That girl can put away the chow. Here, I heated up a bottle. Hey, Angel didn't say anything about.... He probably forgot. He went off in a hurry. - What happened? - He was acting weird this morning. I'm sure you noticed. When he came back from killing the Wraith-ers.... It's okay. It's your Uncle Wes. You like your Uncle Wes. We're gonna have a great time. All right. That's a boy. That's a boy. Angel. Where is everybody? Fred and Gunn went for food. Lorne had to go out. I'm watching the baby. I packed up some overnight things. We talked about me taking Connor to the park, and the one near my place.... It's full of kids. I thought he could spend the night with me. That's probably a really good idea. - You want to say goodbye? - Okay. Hey. Hey. Sleep tight, big guy, huh? Daddy'll see you real soon. Check on him a lot. You have his pediatrician's number? His formula? I've got all that. You ever hear of a time-traveling demon named Sahjhan? No. The guy that brought Holtz here. He thinks I'm his sworn enemy. I don't know him. Can you hit the books before you go? Where's Lorne? He doesn't show his face pronto, Fred'll eat his hoagie. I will not. I already had two. Unless he's really not here. - He had to go out. - Where? Where'd you say he went? I don't know. He didn't say. I think he had to see a client. I've got better reference materials for your demon at home. And Connor's getting sleepy. Why don't I look into it there? Okay. Just call me if you find something. I guess.... I'll see everyone tomorrow. Hey, Wes, what's the closest emergency room to your place? Drew Medical, one minute away. Top infant-care center. Don't worry. Well, my first whole night without the kid. This'll be good for both of us. He can bond with his Uncle Wes... ...and I can get some rest. - We'll stay up with you. - Really? Thanks. He's just a little guy. I'm sure he'll be-- Is someone in Wes' office? Won't you come in. How's fatherhood treating you? I like it. You know, I met a friend of yours tonight. A demon named Sahjhan. - What did he have to say? - He was cryptic. Actually, he was long-winded. I didn't get what his deal was. He hates me. Do you know why? I don't really care why. Where is the little nipper? He had to go out. Sorry. I know he'd love to meet you. I'm sure he'll turn up. You've made a nice life here. Did you come here to fight, or should I make some tea? I want to keep Angelus alive. - But not well. - Come on! - Come on. Are you hurt? - I don't think so. The baby.... Call Wes. Jeez, Lorne, they got you good. You better sit down. What? They didn't do this to me. Wesley did. Wesley? What are you talking about? Earlier, when he came for the baby... ...Connor started crying, and Wes hummed a lullaby, and I read him-- - I don't know why he did it. - Did what? He's been to see Holtz behind your back, twice. He's not taking the baby overnight. He's taking the baby away. For good. That's close enough. Justine? He's everything you said. It's true. What happened? Well, he didn't keep his word. He took everybody... ...and he went after the baby. And when I questioned him.... Bastard. I'll kill him for this. You have to get out of here. - You have to get to a hospital. - No. I just need to do this. It doesn't make sense. Why would Wes do that? You misread him. I read him right. The gash on my head proves it. He isn't answering his cell, pager or home. Where is he? - Should we get them to a hospital? - No. Holtz knew Connor wasn't here. He would've torn the place apart. - He was stalling. - Buying Wesley time to get away. Holtz is the key. I want Holtz. If I find Wesley with him-- We don't know the whole story. I don't think getting too pumped-- - I don't care what you think. - Easy. - He took my son. - I know. I'm just saying-- - He took my son! - Get your hands off me! Stop it, both of you! This isn't helping, damn it! Back off! Only one thing that matters now, and that's, where is Connor? - Where's Holtz? - You think I'd tell-- I'm gonna count to three, then I'm gonna bury this in your face. 2239 Santa Elena. It's a big Victorian in Silver Lake. - We better find Wes before he does. - We should start at his place. I'll stay here in case he comes back. And this time I'll be ready. What do we know? No Holtz, no baby. These don't know where Holtz went. Get them off the street. - So we're in the right place? - Yeah. Excuse me? Yes, ma'am. But Holtz didn't come back here after the hotel. - Where'd he go? - We had him, and we lost him. We're picking him up again. Just give me a moment, please. Spring Street. - Downtown. - Near the Sixth Street Bridge. - Let's go. - Sixth Street Bridge. Let's go. Hustle, hustle, hustle. It went well? Very well. You're paying for my dental work. Hello, son. I'm your father. That lady with the black eye is your mother. Your name is Steven Franklin Thomas... ...and you'll grow up with me on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. What's it like in Utah? It's pretty. Let's go. Come any closer, I'll snap his neck! - Who are they? - They work for me. Oh, the attorney. Yes. You are gonna give us the kid, Captain Holtz. - Don't. - That's cute. You'd rather see the fanatic with the baby than us? Those are automatic weapons. They didn't have them in your time. They fire 16 bullets per second. And if they were gonna use them, they would've already. They want the baby alive. Something we all have in common. Not all of us. You do not want the child alive. You want him dead. That's our arrangement. Yeah. I'm a lawyer. Have you met me? We have a new arrangement. I'm keeping the baby. - You can't do that. - Ignore the loudmouth with the bad skin. He's impotent in this dimension. - We're leaving. - No one's going anywhere. - Don't shoot. - Yeah. You really don't want to. Your bullets won't kill me. But mine will kill you, and her first. He'll be dead before I hit the ground. I know. So I'm going to leave now, right? With me, he gets to live. Anyone tries to take him, he dies. Take him. Whoa. No! What is wrong with you people? I will take good care of him, as though he were my own son. He'll never even know you existed. But come after me.... You will, though, won't you? Maybe I should just-- No. Please. Take him. You look into the Quor-toth. The darkest of the dark worlds. I can widen the portal, and you'll all be swallowed by a world you can't imagine. Or you can keep your word and kill that child. Now! Don't say I didn't warn you. - Kill it. - No! Daniel! Daniel! No! No! Wow. I didn't count on that. Kind of takes care of my problem. All right, then. Have a good summer. Well, I'm looking at a mountain of paperwork. Should we do something about...?
