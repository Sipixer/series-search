everything you ever did as Angelus. I love you, Angel, but I can't be with you. This is where you were born. You never had a family or friends or anything that's real. CORDELIA: And if this is the end, then I want you to have something that is. Last night will always be special, but it can't happen again. Take your new boyfriend and get the hell out of here. - Get over it. - What? There are bigger things at stake. Connor's scared you think he's connected to the Beast. It does tend to show up whenever he's around. ANGEL: We discovered the Beast's plan. MANNY: To blot out the sun for all of eternity. WESLEY: The sun, it's gone. I had a vision of you, long ago, standing in a field of bodies with the Beast. - This wasn't about Connor. It's about... - Angelus. I don't know this Beast. But Angelus might. We need Angelus. NEWS ANCHOR: Officials from... ... the National Weather Service remain baffled... ... as to the cause of this strange phenomenon. All that's being reported at this mid-afternoon hour... ... is what meteorologists are calling, quote, "a localized abnormality"... ... confirming earlier reports that outlying areas remain unaffected... ... while the sun over Los Angeles has, for all intents and purposes... ... been blotted out from the sky. The mayor's office scheduled a news conference for 6:00 this evening... ... regarding this bizarre development and what it may mean for the city. GUNN: I'll tell you what it means. As soon as vamps realize this town's open for business 24/7... ...there's gonna be a huge rise in undead tourism. We just gotta find a way to bring back the sun. Working on it. Failing miserably, but working on it. I could really use some help deciphering some of these symbols. Or all of them, really. I need Wesley. His expertise. Yeah, well, rogue warrior took off without a word. After Electro-Gwen decided to skip town when the going got tougher. Not big on the teamwork, either of them. You're wasting your time. "The answer is among us." [INAUDIBLE] He knows. He's part of the plan. - He doesn't remember. - So he says. You saw him yourself, making a pact with the Beast. It wasn't Angel in my vision. It was Angelus. - He is Angelus. - Believe me, you've never met Angelus. Me neither. But I'm starting to think maybe it's time we did. Maybe Wes is right. Big Beastie has got to be stopped, and I'm out of ideas. If there's a chance Angelus has inside info we could use... You think he's going to turn it over? I think it's worth a try. Not gonna happen. The Gypsies cursed him with a soul so he'd feel remorse... ...to make him suffer for all the people he slaughtered. Removing that soul is the only way to change Angel back into Angelus. A lot easier said than done. CORDELIA: The Gypsy curse was specific. For Angel to lose his soul, he would have to experience a moment... ...of perfect, pure happiness. And right now, happiness of any kind is in kind of short supply. - You sure? - Sorry, bucko, I got nothing. Your choice of "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" threw me a wee. I'm personally not huge with the Vicky Lawrence love. Doesn't make sense. I remember everything Angelus did, I did. Every family butchered, every child slaughtered, every throat ripped out. I remember every detail of all of it. So how come you don't have a smidge of any recollection... ...of a giant magma demon with ram horns and goat legs? Hey, all's I can tell you, stud, is if it's in there, it's buried deep. Deep inside Angelus. Then that's where it stays. Even if I wanted it... ...there's no way to bring Angelus back. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CRASHING] Rumor has it you possess certain skills I require. I need a soul extracted. Awakening - Did Lorne help you remember? - No. - Anything at all? - Nothing. - What've we got? - A puzzle with missing pieces... ...and some cryptic gibberish. Angel, whatever power this device had... ...got swallowed up by the Beast. It won't bring back the sun. - Without the orb, it's as useless as... - Us. Face it, man, we're losing ground. Pretty much the only victory we can claim is that we're not dead yet. Okay, look, I know things haven't been going our way lately, but things change. We're not down for the count. The Beast is not our only concern. Until we figure out how to end eternal darkness, it's a devil's playground. Just the way you like it, huh? Something to say, Connor? You got a problem? - You. - Hey, Connor. Acting like the big leader. Like we don't already know what we know. And what do you know? Everybody thought it was me. CONNOR: Maybe even I was starting to. It was you. You're the one who's working with the Beast. - I'm not. - Well, then you're a puppet. Either way, everything's going to hell because of you. You're the reason that the sun is gone, that I don't have a home. You're the reason that she... It's you. You're the reason my life sucks. Get over it. Not to be a buttinsky, but could we get back to the pep talky thing? I'm not one to turn down a little pep, but I'd much prefer we had a plan. WESLEY: Here's one. Him. Who's he? Wo-Pang. He can deliver Angelus to us. - Thought you said... - Me too. Fred, would you mind brewing some tea for our guest? Sure. Right this way, Mr. Pang. Any special tea you...? WO-PANG: How about orange zinger? Oh, okay. ANGEL: What do you mean, deliver Angelus? Wo-Pang's a shaman. Order of the Kun-Sun-Dai. Dark mystics? You brought a dark mystic here without talking to me? He claims he has the power to extract souls. - Claims? - More importantly, he can restore them. Once we learn what Angelus knows about the Beast... We're not bringing Angelus. - You don't have a choice. - I do. That was it. - Wanna hear it again? Not bringing. - Don't make it harder than it has to be. There's no plan B, and we're running out of time. People are in serious danger. Then unleashing Angelus is the last thing that we should do. If he's here, I'm not. I won't be able to protect anyone from the Beast, or from me. It's only temporary. We'll take all the necessary precautions in the interim, contain you. I'm not blind to the risks. - I know what Angelus... - You have no idea... ...what Angelus is, Wesley. All you know is what you've read in books. You've never had the pleasure of his company. And you're not going to. Get rid of the shaman. [DOOR CLOSES] They're all going to die. The flowers... ...plants, trees... ...without sun. Just realizing. I just came to say... ...that I'm on your side. Angelus is the jumbo family-size bad of bad ideas. He'd be a danger to all of us. You made the right call. Wesley, the others, they don't get it. But you do. Well, if I didn't when Angelus was loose and killing in Sunnydale... ...then reliving his past horrors in virtual, wide-screen Sensurround... ...during my tenure in floaty-ville pretty much makes me an expert. Right. Do you...? Do you think Connor's right? That I'm being used by the Beast without even knowing? No. Are you just saying that? Yes. I don't know, Angel. It's possible. Well, if I am, then I'm already a danger to you. All of you. Well, not like Angelus would be. I mean, he's... He's smart. Excuse me? Well, you know what I mean. - You're saying Angelus is smarter. - No. I mean... ...you're smart. He's just... - Ingenious. - But in that twisted, sadistic... ...ruthless kind of way. - Like the Beast. Yes, exactly. They think alike. Always a step or two ahead of us. I mean, what is it about evil that jacks up the IQ points? It's like whenever... What? Angel? We're gonna need a cage. LORNE: A cage? - A strong one, 10 by 12... ...steel-reinforced, 2-inch bars, maybe 3. ANGEL: I'll make some calls. He thinks something like that will hold the Beast? It's not for the Beast. It's for him. That's it then. [CLANGING] - You got it? - Yeah. The cage is solid, man. All right, tell the shaman we're ready. Hey, listen, Angel-cakes, if it's all the same with you... ...I think I might sit this one out upstairs. You know how dark magic unleashing unspeakable evil gives me the heebies. It's okay. Tell Cordy and Fred they don't need to be down here either. Gotcha, chief. Break a leg. ANGEL: Connor. What? Look, I know you like to think that I'm the enemy. But if this works, I will be. ANGEL: I'm gonna become the one thing you were raised to believe I was. The thing I never, never wanted you to see. Yeah. I think I can handle it. Uh-huh. Well, just keep in mind that whatever Angelus says... ...whatever he does, remember... ...he's not your father. I am. ANGEL: No matter what happens... ...or happened... ...I love you. Look, one more thing. Since I'm gonna be out of commission for a while, I want you to, you know... ...take care of everybody, keep them safe. That means if anything should go wrong with Angelus... ...you're gonna have to kill me. - Okay. If anything goes wrong. Right. I got it. - What is that? WO-PANG: It is the Muo-ping. The receptacle that will house his soul. Cordy, I don't want you here. Yeah? Tough. WO-PANG: It would be wise for your safety to add a second lock to the door. Do as he says. Angel... ...you don't have to do this. Now she tells me. WO-PANG: Close your eyes and don't speak. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] WO-PANG: Time to say goodbye. Gunn! CORDELIA: Hurry! WO-PANG: Fool! Why would I help you? I serve the Awakened One. Little help here, please. So this was all a setup, this whole soul colonic thing. For what? That's what I'd like to know. ANGEL: Why does the Beast suddenly want me dead? Did Angelus welsh on our pact? Is that it? Okay, then maybe you can shed a little light as to what the Beast's plan is. Or maybe I should just start taking you apart now, piece... ...by piece. Well, so much for that font of information. Gunn, see if he has anything on him. He's got something on him, all right. LORNE: Is there any part of this guy that doesn't have writing all over it? Scratch that. I don't wanna know. - Can you translate it? - Most of it. Definitely scripture. A recorded history of the Kun-Sun-Dai. They're acolytes of the Beast, all right. GUNN: That's why we couldn't find... ...anything written about Beastie Boy in the books. They have it on their asses. WESLEY: Hang on. - What is it? WESLEY: There's a passage here. - Difficult to... Fred, could you...? - Oh. Uh-huh. It's detailing the acolytes' victory over the Bosh M'ad sometime in... I think in the third century. What's Bosh... Whatever you said? The Opposers of the Awakening. The Bosh M'ad forged something to destroy the Beast. WESLEY: The tooth of light. - They made a tooth? To the best of my interpretation, a weapon of some kind. How'd it work out for them? It was never used. The Awakening was centuries away. In the meantime, every last one of the Bosh M'ad... ...was wiped out by the Beast's acolytes. So this tooth thing must have had them worried. What happened to it? Never found. The Opposers kept it hidden. So now we have to find a tooth in a haystack. We don't even know what the weapon is. It's a sword. The sword of Bosh M'ad. CORDELIA: I can see it. Pretty. I know where it is. - Where? - It's here, under the city. Well, that's a break. Did you hear that? There's a sword. ANGEL: A sword to kill the Beast. You wanted to turn me into Angelus by having an evil shaman cut off my head. Not that that wasn't a swell plan too. Sorry. Was that an apology? I was careless. Made a mistake that almost cost you your life. Would've made pulling you out of the ocean a waste of my time. Yeah, that would've been a drag. It's just the first time I ever heard you apologize... ...about anything. So we gonna go get the sword, or what? ANGEL: I don't get this. WESLEY: What? How is it a sword from the third century is conveniently located... ...here in Los Angeles? I don't think it is. I mean, I get the impression that somehow it's accessible... ...from, like, 100 points all over the world. How's that work? I don't know. I just get the visions, not the Cliff Notes. Over there. What's that? The way down. That's a steep grade down there. Gonna have to take it a little slow. Watch our steps and stay... ...together. Oh. - Connor. - Found something. Easy, easy. What are those? Holiday decorations left over from some S & M bondage party? [LOUD CLANGING] Wood. Why did it have to be wood? We have to pass through the corridor without ringing any of the bells. I knew you two would get me in trouble some day. Cordelia, freeze! Your sleeve. - Oh, no. - It's a dead end. Who booby-traps a dead end? That's just not right. There's something here. - Assyrian? - Hebrew. Rashi script. Can you read it? Well, they're just random letters, one on each stone. Unless... This is it! You did... - You didn't. - There's a pattern. Hebrew letters have numerical values. Aleph is one. The letter with the next highest numerical value would be <i>he</i>. Five. - What happened? What happened? - He was wrong. I don't know. I don't know what else... Nine stones. Yes, that's it. It's not their numerical value. These are the first letters of the nine antediluvian patriarchs in Genesis. That would've been my next guess. - So which one do we press? - <i>Aleph</i> was Adam. So in ascending order, <i>shin</i> for Seth. That one. - Now what? - <i>Kaph</i> for Cainan. Which one's <i>kaph</i>? - Maybe that one. CORDELIA: Maybe? I don't have enough shirt to bandage both of you. Come on! Connor, go. Both of us. Now. Which way now? - Don't look at me. - We should split up. Connor, go with Wes. Cordy and I'll go to the left. - I'll go with Cordy. - Connor... - What difference does it make? - We don't have time for a discussion. Just go with Wesley. I'm sorry about that back there. Connor. He's still confused about things. I've really made a mess of a messy situation, haven't I? Some really rotten decisions I'd love to take back. But... But I don't know if you ever could... Could? Whoa. Could what? What could I ever...? This has gotta be the place. So where's the sword? CORDELIA: Okay, great. - It's gone. - Maybe. What maybe? I don't see it. Do you? No. The light must be coming from somewhere. Angel. It's some kind of dimensional hub. That's why the sword can be in 100 places... ...at once. I'd say things are starting to look... Angel. Can we get out of here now? ANGEL: Cordy! Angel! [CORDELIA SCREAMS] CORDELIA: Angel! ANGEL: Hang on! [CORDELIA SCREAMS] [EXPLOSIONS] Uhh. Uhh. Uhh. Oh, my God. Are you...? No, no. No, no, I'm good. Uh. I'm good. See? I missed the pointy end. What? We could have died. But we didn't. What if we had? What if we'd been deep-fried trying to save the world again and... And I... ...didn't have the chance to tell you. Tell me what? I'm sorry for what happened. For what I let happen with Connor. I was lost and frightened. I thought it was the end, and I wanted to be with you. But I couldn't. Oh, God, to do what I did. ANGEL: It's gonna be all right. CORDELIA: No. You need to know that I can look back and see every horrible thing... ...you've ever done as Angelus, and it doesn't matter anymore... ...because when I'm with you, all I feel is the good you've done as Angel. I know I've hurt you. I know I don't deserve forgiveness. Cordy... ...I don't care what you've done in your past either. I don't know if this is right, Angel. Stop talking. Okay. Connor. CORDELIA: Connor! Connor, wait. ANGEL: Connor... - Leave me alone. Can't we just talk about this? Don't move. - Don't tell me what to do. - Connor! Ow. That hurt. Yeah. I can really see why she wants you. Connor, I know you're hurt. You don't know anything, Dad, except how to take things away from me. Be careful. Why? Nothing in this world is the way it ought to be, right? It's harsh and cruel. Because of you! This isn't the place for this. It's your fault. It's all your fault. - I shouldn't have been born! - Grow up! You think you're the only one who ever felt like that? - Wished his father were dead? - Yeah, but mine already is. It's not all about you, Connor. What you want isn't always what people need. She was mine! She was mine. No, she wasn't. I'm sorry, Connor, but you need to understand that. Connor. FRED: Oh, my God. - Thought you guys might be dead. - Don't stop thinking it yet. - Is that it? - The sword of the Bosh M'ad. The slayer of the Beast. Can I play with it? Where's Connor? Patrolling. WESLEY: We have the sword. WESLEY: Now all we need is... [CRASHING] My bad. All we need to do is locate the Beast. Well, most of my connections have am-scrayed to dimensions... ...a little lighter on the stomping your entrails out. All I could Kolchak was a rumor of bad mojo rising... ...in the warehouse district. - That's where we'll start. Wait. We found some relevant passages in the Paranych Grimore... ...which we were able to cross-reference with Wo-Pang's butt. Either he's got one hell of a funky mole, or there's only one way to kill the Beast. - How? - Piercing its brain with the Bosh M'ad. - Sounds like a plan to me. - And what about the sun? One good poke in the coconut should take care of that too. When the Beast is dead, the energy used to block the sun should be released. There's a catch, isn't there? One small eensie. Always with the fine print. Took a whole lot of power to pull off permanent midnight. Which will all be released when I kill the Beast. As far as we can figure from the text... ...nothing human will survive at that close a range. I'm not even sure that you can. I'll let you know. CORDELIA: You won't fight this thing by yourself. There's no choice. There's always a choice. Not for me. ANGEL: I have to do this. You've made a difference. Each of you. Not just to me, but to the world. ANGEL: We've been pushed to the edge so many times... ...done things we were sure could never be forgiven. ANGEL: But we're always there for each other when it counts. We've never let the darkness win. ANGEL: And it's not because of the Powers That Be or the super strength... ...or the magical weapons. It's because we believe in each other. Not just as friends or lovers... ...but as champions. All of us, together. Angel, wait. You just said it. We're stronger together. You can't do this alone. I'm not. Drop the Hallmark crap. That might placate the shiny happys... ...but I'm working with a little more investment. I can't lose you. Not now. Not when we're just starting... ...whatever it is or could be. We'll figure it out when I get back. But what if you don't? It's not gonna happen. You don't know that. Hey, I've never been more sure of anything. I'll come back, Cordelia... ...I promise, for you. But first, I gotta do this. I gotta find the Beast and... Oh. There he is. I grow weary of your cowardice, Angelus. If you will not stand with me, then suffer the agony of my wrath. Is that what I think it is? Go. - No! Get out of here! - No! ANGEL: All of you! I can't do this with you here. Go! No! Angel! - That stings. - Not as much as it's gonna. We could rule this world. Why do you oppose me? Rain of fire, blocking out the sun, and you just kind of piss me off. It doesn't have to be this way, Angelus. I'm thinking it does. Did you really think you'd win? The boy joins the father in death. No, in kicking your stony ass. Such arrogance. So much like Angelus. His name is Angel. Consider your ass kicked. [BEAST SCREAMS] CONNOR: Dad. You came back. Like I'd let you take all the credit for saving the world? CONNOR: You're right. It is harsh and cruel. She was the only thing that made it hurt less. - Connor... - But it's not me. I could feel it in her touch. In her eyes. She loves you. It's always been you. I'm sorry. She was too old for me anyway. Is this what it feels like? Being a champion? Pretty much. Connor? CORDELIA: Oh, my God. - You did it. - We did it. All of us. Ohh. Now, could one of you do me a favor... ...and sweep that up? Must be hard, seeing everyone so happy because of what you did. Bringing the light back... ...but not being able to go out into it. There's no place I'd rather be... ...than here with you. - Cordy. - No. Whatever it is... ...whatever the reason or excuse or logic... ...we're here now, together. Everything is the way it's supposed to be for once. Angel... ...haven't we waited long enough? Ah. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Buffy? No! Oh, God, no! WO-PANG: Illusion becomes reality. WO-PANG: It is done. Angelus. [LAUGHING]
