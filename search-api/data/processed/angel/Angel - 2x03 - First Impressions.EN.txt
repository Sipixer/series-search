Why can't we fight together? I'm on my own. You won't be happy until you get close to death. It's not gonna happen, little sister. Goodbye, Alana. I killed her. She was the reason, man. - It's haunted. - It's rent-controlled! I have a roommate that I never see. Hey, Dennis, put that back! We'll even the score with him. Beginning with what's in that box. We're all very pleased you're here, Darla. - He's here. - Angel. I'd love to see that boy. "Send in the Clowns" and "Tears of a Clown," both in one night! Well, I was sort of going for a medley. - More of a due-dly really, wasn't it? - I couldn't come up with a third. I've never seen you open up like that before. - You've been practicing, haven't you? - A little. - Where? - In the shower. It so shows. You really put your heart into it. - Question is, what happens to it now? - It? Your heart, big softie. It may not be beating, but it can still break. - What do you mean? - You've come to a bend in your road. Whether that slows you down is up to you. There are hills and mountains Between us Always something to get over Darla. I was afraid you weren't coming. - I've been here the whole time, silly. - You have? Just waiting for you. Aren't you going to ask me to dance? Right here, right now Right by my side Yeah I still can't believe you're here. I mean, I killed you. I'm over that. Have you told anyone about these dates of ours? No. I want you all for myself. I know how you feel. It's so strange. But good. But good. Somebody get these two love vamps a room. - This place will never get clean. - It's just a little dust. Oh, this isn't mere dust. This is Son of Dust. This is the kind of dust that spawns generations of baby dust. - I give up. - We'll just move back to your place. And I'm dusting. Where's Angel? - I believe the word is "Hello." - "Where's Angel?" summed it up. - We got work to do. - He's still sleeping. Sleeping? It's 3:30. I've been up since dawn. Sort of missing the whole "Creature of the Night" angle. - I know I said 4:00. - You had an appointment? He didn't brief you? We're meeting a snitch downtown. - The guy has a line on Deevak. - Deevak? Demon in my neighborhood. He hurt two of my men. Can you go in and knock on his coffin? He doesn't use a coffin. Haven't you heard the expression "Let sleeping vampires lie"? He'll rise on his own. He always does. Maybe we can help. To find Deevak, I'm gonna need more than C-3PO... ...and Stick-Figure Barbie with me. No offense. - Very little taken. - He's a badass. I need serious muscle. Demons of the underworld, beware! Your time on Earth is drawing nigh! - David, hi. - I got here as quick as I could. We paged you two days ago. I was in Kuala Lumpur. Hostile takeover. Identify yourself, traveler. Are you also a fellow demon-killer? Who is this guy? David Nabit, meet Charles Gunn. Gunn, Nabit. Pleasure's all mine. So where's Angel? - He's still sleeping. - At 3:30? I've been up since dawn. Sorry I'm late. I stand ready to fight the good fight, sir. What do you need? Financial advice. Okay. Good. This is our new base of operations. We're leasing with an option to buy. What are you willing to put down? - "Nothing" would be good. - Oh, easy. You could finance and take over the owner's payments... ...or get a preservation grant... ...and restore the original decor and get a tax break and a loan... ...or you could try for an FHA and get a PMI. Is anybody else getting warm? Do that "tax breaks, FHA and PMI" part again. I'll have my money guy run some numbers, and we'll.... Thanks. Is this demon-fighting cool or what, huh? - We need to move on this. - Relax. We'll make it. Relax? When you need a favor, I'm there. First time I need your help, you sleep all day. Cordy, you're driving. Me, drive your car? So cool. - We're gonna need some bribe money. - Wait a minute. - Thought you wanted to move on this. - They'll slow us up. To go against Deevak, we need help. Pick me up in the back. - Good. - Shotgun. Too late, he split. Maybe he heard what a pleasant person you were. There. - Who's Gunn? - Me. You Jameel? Here's the money. Keep it. I changed my mind. Fine. You're gonna tell me where Deevak is. I know you have a rep, and I ain't looking to make no new enemies. I can't help you with Deevak. He'll know it was me. Demon's got eyes, ears and teeth all over. There's a chance he had some vamps tail me here. I don't see nothing. Good. I'm just here to pay my respects and get home before sundown. You better tell me what you know. I'm sorry. But Deevak scares me a lot more than you do. Gunn! - Scared now? - What are you doing? - I got people dying. - I didn't do anything! Think I care? It's survival of the fittest, and you don't look too fit. - Let go. This is my case. - It was. Now it's mine. - Angel! - I told you I was being watched. - I'm so sick of dust. - I can't lift my arm. - This vamp did a number on my ribs. - Afraid I threw my back out again. Lovely. Grease stains all over my new outfit! Maybe my pain isn't physical, but my dry-cleaning bill will be huge. We still didn't find Deevak. - Probably for the best. - How do you figure? We're not prepared to face Deevak in our condition. You ready to pack it in? I thought you were the demon experts. We should've been able to lick them faster than that. We need to regroup. I'm gonna track down Jameel and make him talk. When you do, you may wanna be more Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential... ...and less Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs, I haven't seen a movie since Denzel was robbed of the Oscar for Malcolm X, Later. - That was quite a performance. - Talk about wound up too tight. No, I mean Denzel. Oh. Well, he's always great. What about you? Who doesn't love Denzel? No, what you said before. It's true. You've never had such trouble with a simple vampire. Off day. Let's go. - Home sweet hotel. - Just bring the car back tomorrow. - Are you okay? - I just need some sleep. That seems to be all you've been doing lately. - Not that I'm judging. - Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Jeez, Dennis. It's like a meat locker in here. Did you turn down the thermostat again? Thank you. What is it with ghosts and cold rooms? Dennis! Phone! What's that ringing? Nothing, darling. It'll stop. Where's it coming from? Ignore it. Why are you so good to me after everything I did? Because... ...you and I are one. See? I told you it would stop. Wesley, where are you? Are you there? Wesley? Where are you guys? I don't know what I should do. I had a vision. It's Gunn. He's in trouble. I think it's bad. Where are you guys? I'm going over there. When you get this message... ...get Angel and meet me at Gunn's, okay? I need a weapon. Okay, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Gunn? Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? Saving you from a killer demon! Not a demon? And I didn't just save your life? Right. - What are you thinking about? - You. Us. - You seem sad. It's just.... I have to go. - Where? - Away. - I'll go with you. - You can't. I'm in danger. I'll protect you. You're too busy protecting everyone else. Wesley? Stop it! - You made her go away! - Angel, it's me! - What are you doing here? - Gunn's in trouble. Can't breathe. - Gunn can't breathe? - I can't breathe! Oh, sorry. It's quite all right. Now, about the naked thing. - I'll get dressed. - Much appreciated. No, no. - There you go. Good as new. - I think you cracked my skull. Well, that's new, right? - Where are you going? - Walking you out. You're going home. Don't dismiss me. I know what I'm talking about. Like how you knew Joey was a demon? I was just trying to help you. It helps a guy's rep when a white beauty queen comes to his rescue... - ...in front of his crew. - You are in big-time danger. I saw you in a vision, fighting for your life. You were so scared! I don't get scared. I do. Sometimes I get terrified. Right now, I am scared for you. Be scared for me back at your place. I won't leave until you're safe. I don't want a sidekick, so go home. - No. - Thanks for coming. Drive safe. So where's your car? So where's your car? Angel is not gonna be happy... ...when he finds out I let his car get stolen. What are the chances that a vampire has insurance? I'll find the car. How are you gonna do that? There's a couple of guys that jack vintage cars. We'll look until we find it. Then what? Just ask them to give it back? I'll say please. You'll use your charm, like you did this afternoon with that pigeon stool. It's "stool pigeon." You have no clue about me. - Paging Mr. Rationalization. - Ms. About-to-be-thrown-out-of-a-car! Be rude, but I'm not going anywhere until I know you're safe. Me, rude? You showed up, attacked my boy... ...then hijacked my life. I find your car, you give me my freedom back. That's not how it works. You need protection. And how do you plan to protect me? With some weak ladysmith battle-ax? Ask Joey and his cracked skull how weak it is. Besides, I've also got this. - Mace. - Mace? Squirt in the eyes. Think I'll be jumped by a purse-snatching demon? It'll have to do, because I'm your protector, whether you like it or not. Somebody better attack me soon. I can't take much more of this. - What are you waiting for? - I don't think it'll fit. Yes, it will. Put it on. I don't need a helmet. It's the law. Do you want us to get pulled over? No. Then what's the problem? Well, it's just, you know... ...the visibility issue and the hat-head thing-- Why do I get the lady's helmet? Stop being a wanker and put it on. Looks good. Hop on board, gorgeous. You'll pay for this. It isn't here. New acquisitions are in the garage. Getting a makeover, I bet. - What you looking for? - '67 Plymouth convertible. Give me a few days. Cordelia, meet Henry. New to the neighborhood? - Someone stole my friend's car. - '67 Plymouth. - Wasn't me. Convertible, you said? - Yeah. Desmond's your man. He can't pass up old convertibles. Come on. You won't find him at his shop. Tito's having a party. Everyone's invited. Desmond'll be there. - Where you jack these cars from? - Around. They look like neighborhood cars. Now you want to start something. Jack cars in Brentwood. Leave the neighborhood cars alone. Business is business. You should mind your own. I might have to put you out of business. Let's go. - Surprised you didn't wet yourself. - Him? He's nothing, Deevak. Name's Gunn. He thinks he runs this town. I know who he is. The trouble he's caused. Tonight, it ends. - Gunn, what are you doing here? - I was gonna ask you the same thing. We'll catch up later. - You should be in the garment district. - It was dead. So you thought you'd party? - It's just a little fun. - It's you not obeying orders. We got two men down. Want to make it three? Go home. I got things to take care of, then we can chat. Go! Short enough leash, or do you get all warm on the power-trip thing? He needs discipline to survive. Now shut up and stay close. I'm not one of your toy soldiers you can just boss around. I don't even want you here. Too bad. I am here. And I don't take orders. Well, except from Angel. And he usually asks nicely. Besides, I know how to behave at a party. Trust me, I know how to blend. Okay, not exactly blending. I'll just shut up and stay close. Hey, stranger. Hey, girl. Looking good, Veronica. We've missed you at the store. You should stop by. I've been busy. Who's your friend? Who, me? I'm no friend. I'm just here on business. I'm a working girl. That came out wrong. Obviously, I'm not a working girl. Not that I couldn't be if I wanted to. I could. That sounded stuck-up. Not that I could be a working girl and you couldn't. Far from it. You'd make a great.... Could you point me to the hors d'oeuvres? We're looking for Desmond. - You seen him? - He's around. I'll catch up. - You better. Don't forget about us. - Never. You friends with every Criminal in town? - You're assuming they're criminals. - Aren't they? Like David Nabit? Think he got rich by being a good citizen? Actually, he did. He made millions creating software for blind people to surf the Web. He set up a foundation that donates $20,000,000 a year... ...to countless charitable causes. Let me know when some of that trickles down here. - There he is. - Who? Car thief guy? It's him. Desmond! G-Man. Can I get you a brew? You can get me the car you stole. - What makes you think I did it? - Don't play with me. Hey, I had no idea that-- What's happening? You're bleeding. I'm gonna take care of you. Try to relax. Okay, try to sit up, okay? Come on, easy. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. She needs a doctor. Now! - We need a doctor. Where's a doctor? - This way. Dr. Thomas! What happened? Glass in her neck. She took it out before I could stop her. It may have hit an artery. I put pressure on it, but her pulse is weakening. - She passed out. - Will she be okay? - Let us take care of her. - Will she? Your friend saved her life, but we still have work to do. Let us do it. Come on, she's in good hands. She almost died. - But she didn't. - No thanks to me. It's not your fault. I let my guard down, and she-- They were coming after me. - Take it easy. - I can't. I can never take it easy. When I do, someone like Alana pays the price. Alana? Veronica. I can't stop. I can't ever stop. Don't you move a muscle! Where is my car? Excuse me. Do you know Charles Gunn? Someone said we might find him here. No, I don't know. Maybe he got hurt. - You look like you're hurt. - No, I'm fine. What happened here? I'm not sure. It all happened so fast. I don't know who they were looking for... ...but they were strong, like they were on drugs. I just need to lie down. If you've suffered a head injury-- No, I'm okay. Really. I was lucky, compared to the others. You sure you're okay? Yeah. Thanks. Good. Now start talking, huh. There is a God. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You drive it out of here, I'll follow you home. Just as soon as I find the keys. You don't have the keys? I left them in the car when I went in to save you. - Every second counted. - You are one high-maintenance chick. The keys are here. Somewhere. You are killing me! Can't you hot-wire it? I am not a car thief. Well, High-Moral-Ground Boy, help me find them. Looking for these? Go. - Not a chance. - Go! I'm not leaving you! How touching. A woman willing to die with her man. He's not my man, he's just a friend. About the willing to die part-- You must be Deevak. Damn, you're ugly. And you're the big bad Gunn. Heard you were looking for me. Hey! You found me. How's it feel to meet up with someone even nastier than you? Not good, by the sound of it. Stop it! You're killing him! Survival of the fittest, bro. Right now, you don't look too fit. Oh, my God. Cordy, ax! Angel? Angel, look. I found your keys. This substance doesn't appear to be coming off. - What is that? - Demon blood. Or demon pus. Or possibly both. Anyone know how to hot-wire a car? - Hey. - Hey. You finally saved my life. Guess I should say thanks. Yes, you should. - And no, I didn't. - What? Deevak wasn't the danger in my vision. - He wasn't? - No. Then what was? I'm looking at it. It's you. You're the danger. - Excuse me? - It's how you live your life. You don't just face danger, you create it. You're on a self-destruct mission. You need help. I don't buy this Dionne Warwick crap. You know it's true. You need some serious saving. I've got my work cut out for me. Is that right? Well, yeah. Plan on having me in your life for a while. At least until you find some peace. Could be a while. That's okay. Helping people is what me and my friends do. Lucky me. Hey... ...how about that "thank you"? Honey, you're home. - Hi. - You look beat. What's wrong? Nothing. You save any lives today? A few, yeah. Did any of your friends say thank you? Not exactly. Typical. Next time I see them I'm going to say something. - It's okay. - No, it isn't. - You give, and you give, and you give. - I'm used to it. Always the protector, never the protected. I have so much to make up for. And you have. You take care of so many people. But who takes care of you? - You do. - That's right, I do. Come on. Come on. Lean back. Now, you just relax... ...and let Darla take care of you. - How's that? - Good. I'm just getting started, baby. I know how to please you.
