The Host. He helps demons. Reads their souls. Only when they sing karaoke. Darla. That's her. You're what Wolfram & Hart brought back. - I remember everything. - You have a soul now. Soon those memories are gonna start eating away at you. What did you do? What am I? You allowed her to escape, you facilitated it. - She needed help. - You know what she was. What we were. Turn me back. I can't bear this pounding in my chest! I can't. - Darla, wait. - No. Don't look for me again. Don't you think we should check on him? He's been in that cellar a long time. I keep hearing a "chucka-chucka" sound. - What's he doing? - How should I know? He barely says "Good morning, and get me a glass of blood." He's so distraught about-- Don't say Darla. I'm sick and tired of hearing about her. If I hear the name Darla one more time-- He's not distraught, he's obsessed. I thought... ...you'd be a man and talk to him. I was a man. I said...things. - Like what? - Like... ...did he prefer milk or sugar in his tea? - It's how men talk in England. - Shh! Listen. It stopped. He's coming. - Hi, guys. What's up? - Nothing. So you were doing your laundry? There's a washer and dryer in the cellar. Don't you love when they're still warm? "Wrinkle-free." Right, after you iron it for about 15 minutes. Good to see you being domestic. Yeah. You seem all calm and homey. Are you on drugs? I know I've caused you a lot of grief over Darla, and I apologize. Darla may never need my help. I can only be there for her if and when she decides to come around. But I can't do it for her, and I know that now. We had tea. In the meantime, there's nothing I can do but let go. I found Darla. Wasn't easy, but my knowledge... ...of L.A.'s motels paid off. - You lied to us. - I did, I know. Why? Figured you'd nag. - Royal Viking Motel. - Near skid row. She's not living off Wolfram & Hart now. They'll look for her. - What do you think they'll do? - Let's get there first. If you expect us to go with you on a wild goose chase, guess again. We're not going to enable you in your addiction! Didn't we learn anything from the tea? You're a hard one to find. Thanks for coming in. Did I ever have a choice? Of course. We would never force you against your will. It wasn't my will to even be here. I never asked for this life. Well, no one ever does. God doesn't give us a say. God wasn't the one who brought me back. True. What do you want me to do? Go back to him? There's nothing between us anymore. You misunderstand. We didn't invite you here to discuss Angel. This is about you. You're not our prisoner, Darla. You are, however, our moral responsibility. You probably don't remember your first few weeks with us. No one remembers their first days of life... ...but that's when these were initiated. Did you know anything about this? We'll deal with this any way you see fit. It's up to you. We just thought you should know. - She ain't here, bro. - No. But she was, not long ago. - I smell the fear. - Don't envy that talent. Not based on what I'm getting with my human smeller. Not even for free cable, you know? She chose this place for a reason. - How'd you-- - Motel. She didn't live here. I wouldn't call it living. Looks like maybe she was expecting company. In the form of you. No blood. - Nothing new, anyway. - You smell that too? - Room's seen a lot of it. - Step down from her last digs. When you're desperate, you do what you have to do. Don't these people know who we are? I think they do. Explains the lynch mob. Look, we should all rest. It'll be dawn in a few hours, and she won't last carrying us both. I hate the French. We should go to Romania. In Italy you wanted France. In Romania they know how to treat a vampire. You said you were craving rich food. Something French. The valley seems quiet. I told you, we lost them back in Arles. This man Holtz. How does he keep finding us? We stay in the best hotels... ...order room service, eat the waiters. People talk. Holtz is no mere mortal. Of course he is. He's just a man. A vampire hunter. Drove us into a barn, like animals. All right, then, let's be animals. At least for tonight. Unless... ...you're too tired. - Shouldn't we keep watch? - I can see the window. And we'll hear hoofbeats, should anyone approach. You always make the best of it. You have to admit, the chase can be exhilarating. Especially with the proper companion. Bastards! That's great. Really, very threatening. Getting to you, isn't it? When I was a human... ...I didn't have much luck with women. - Hard to believe. - Had a skin condition. But now, something about the teeth. Chicks go crazy for it. You've got girlfriends everywhere, I imagine. Mostly I just kill them. Dump the bodies. That must be very lonely for you. We're lonely, we creatures of the night. Doomed to walk the earth. How long have you been...? An eternal child of darkness? Since '92. 1992? It's already the last century. And in all this time, you've never considered... ...making yourself a mate? How do you mean? Well, isn't it true that some vampires choose a mortal7. Someone they can sire. Someone who too can walk those lonely nights... ...hunting with them, feeding with them. Joining with them. That'd be weird. Weird? It's mythic. You read too much Anne Rice. You've got no idea.... Teach me. You want me to make you? You think I came in here for the snacks? Sweetheart, in this bar you are the snacks. I live nearby. We can go to my place, you can do it there. You're serious about this. So what? I make you and then... ...you'd be my immortal babe? Yes. That sounds like commitment to me. Then use me as long as you like... ...any way you like, then discard me. No strings. There's an alley out back. What if I just kill you? Drain you and leave your body. I'll take my chances. I should probably mention... - ...I'm not clear on how this works. - What? I never did it to anybody. And I was out when it happened to me. I'll walk you through it. Drink. When you feel my heart start to slow, stop. - What are you doing? - Saving you. I wasn't in danger, Angelus, believe me. I always pick the stupid ones, didn't you know? - I can take care of myself. - I was saving you from yourself. - Who asked you? - This isn't the answer. You don't even know the question. You do this, I won't leave you alone. Next time, it'll be you on the end of this stake. I'm sorry, but I don't want that. Not again. I won't let it happen twice. - Where are you going? - I'll try the west side. - Another dive? - What do you care? This isn't you. We had 150 years together, but you don't know me. You really want to be made in an alley? I wanted you to do it. That'll never happen. I do what I have to do. Anyway, you were made in an alley. - That's not the point. - What is? The point is, you were undead for 400 years. You've been human for a few months. Give it a chance. - I don't have time. - Yes, you do. Don't throw this away-- I'm dying. What? Yeah. And not sometime, not later. Now. Right now. They showed me my medical files. The tests say... ...I've got two months left. So excuse me, I'm in sort of a hurry. - How many men are there? - I can't die like this. We could flee to the hills. We can't make it on foot before sunrise. We'll not make it easy for them. Between the two of us, we can go out with a reputation. Even death, with the right companion-- I hope you survive. If you do, maybe we'll meet again in Vienna. Angel's back! He has Darla with him! Hi. You're planning on sleeping over? I'm dying. - So just one night? - Dying? - He doesn't believe it. - What? Wolfram & Hart showed her some files that say she only has a few months. - So more than one night? - You think it's a trick? Of course it's a trick. They're playing mind games. - To what end? - I don't know. - You just won't believe it. - I can't believe them. They can't be trusted. I don't trust them. But I know mind games. So do you. We've played them together. You were just soulless demons. They're lawyers. She's right. We were amateurs. And if you're wrong? I'm not. And I'll prove it to you. Can you watch her for a while? I'll be back soon. - Sure. - Don't worry about it. - You can't keep me. - You're not a prisoner. I've heard that a lot lately. Just give me a chance, okay? So. First up, you're a prisoner. I have to concur with that. - You've got our friend all in knots. - Can't say we like you much. So, sorry about the dying, but if you try to escape... - ...we will hit you. - On the head. With very large and heavy objects. Okay? - Maybe I can't come in but-- - Wipe your feet. What? Wipe your feet. Come in. Jeez, I invited you in already. Do you really need to throttle me? Need to? Yes, she's dying. Those medical reports are real. Want a second opinion? Here. How about a third? How about a tenth? I used every connection we had. That's my own doctor. They're all the same: Syphilitic heart condition. Terminal. Darla was a working girl in the New World. Had syphilis when she was human. She's human again. Picking up where she left off. Today that can be cleared up with antibiotics, if you catch it. We're about a month and, what-- 400 years too late? You didn't believe it either. So it's true. I had to be sure. Why? Why? I don't want her to die any more than you do. Do you love her, Lindsey? Is that what this is? Look at you. A few months with her, you're a schoolboy. I was with her for 150 years. But you never loved her. - I wasn't capable, neither are you. - Maybe not. But I'd save her if I could. You can, and you won't. You've got a choice. Waste her life searching for a cure that doesn't exist. Watch her die. Or use your only real power. You can make this disease go away. - By killing her. - Giving her life. Eternal life. Then what, Lindsey? You can be together? If I were to do it... ...how long do you think it would be before she hunted you down? Gotta say, that thought almost makes it worth it. But there's another way. I'll find it. Not only is she putting his life at stake... ...but ours. After 400 years of death and destruction... ...it seems to me you get voted off the island. Am I right? You're back. Was it good news? Give me a minute, will you, guys? Jasmine. It blooms at night. I remember what that was like. I told you it was the truth. - Darla. - I have to go. We'll find a cure. I've been around long enough to recognize a lost cause. Unless.... That's exactly what they want us to do, Darla. I don't care. I don't want to die. - I can't do it. - I need it. No, you don't. I don't know what you need. I wish I did. I don't know either. No... ...you do. You're the only one that could. You just can't see it. You need help. Ill wind blow away let me rest today You're blowing me no good What does that mean? It means, Ground Control to Major Tom, may not be able to save her. I'm gonna do it. You're gonna help me. I sense pain and anger. Still testy? Because you sent me to a swami whose impostor tried to kill me? It was painful. I'm still reeling. I feel your pain, trying to kill me and all. People try to kill you every day. I mean Ramone. Overheard us and betrayed me. A world-class bartender. He made a Sea Breeze that took you to Tahiti. He's off the menu now. - Can we get back to Darla? - If you'll shush up and listen. You're only misleading the sunshine I'm needing Ain't that a shame It's so hard to keep up With troubles that creep up Aren't you reading her? I'm a channel surfer. You're a big hunk of hero sandwich. You want to save the girl. I can see why. But you're missing the crucial point here. Not everything can be put back together. - She can't die. - Why do you care so much? She had more than most of us. 400-plus years. As a vampire. Before that, she was-- She never had a chance. No good Someone get my heart. That girl's ripped it right out. I know I'm probably going to regret this. In fact, being prescient, I'm sure of it. There is one way. - It's a bit of a quest. May kill you. - I'll take it. All right, big fella, you asked for it. You're about to face hell and high water. Go to this address. What is it? Where we find out if you're ready to take the plunge. - Well, here we are. - I don't think this is right. He said I had to take the plunge. - Into an empty pool? - Sure. With water you'd miss out on all that skull crushing. Maybe he meant another pool. Something in the koi pond. Very Zen. It's a test. A leap-of-faith thing. Then don't do it. A green-faced lounge singer asks you to do this, and you do it? Why? I'll either be back with a cure... ...or you're about to see something funny. You certainly have faith. Now we'll test your valor. I shall be assisting you with the trials, sir. - Darla. Why is she here? - You wish to save her life? - Yes. - She's your collateral then. Should you complete all three trials, she will be made whole. - What happens if I don't? - She dies instantly. In the meantime, Darla, relax with a beverage in our antechamber. No. It's better this way. Soon, no living thing will be safe in here. Nobody said-- Sorry for the misunderstanding, but life is the bargain here. By entering, you have placed hers in the balance. Along with your own, of course. You'd best get ready now, sir. This is no time to be dwelling on the negative. Your trials will consist of three challenges. I'll need your shirt and shoes. Unarmed combat? Well, you'll be unarmed, yes. Okay, three challenges. What are they? That's for you to discover. Shoes and socks, please. You've seen this before. Give me something. - I've never given information before. - How many asked? In theory, the first test is child's play. - That gate opens, you walk through it. - That's it? - What's the catch? - That would be telling, wouldn't it? What's two and three? I wouldn't know about the last two tests. Nobody survives the first one. Best of luck. You must be the catch. Seventeen seconds. Twice the time others have lasted. - Call this off. - Impossible. The tests can't be stopped. - I need to see what's happening. Now. - If you insist. But please remember, you did ask. Hey, I defeated him! Open up! This how a guy like you gets his rocks off? I have no feelings about this contest, miss. Do you? Why don't you just kill him? We don't want anything, miss. The journey is all. Where it leads is not our concern. Holy water. He's quite remarkable. Yes, he is. Well played. You've fielded our strokes from end to end. My hat's off to you, sir. Of course, there is one final challenge. - What is this? - I think you know, sir. Stakes. You call this... ...a test? - Only way it works is you kill me? - Exactly. You do understand this third test has no catch, as you put it. Death is the final challenge. We can't restore one life without taking another. In order for Darla to live, you must die. My apologies for any discomfort this causes. I really can't imagine the pain. How about we switch places? My death wouldn't balance a thing. Yours-- I die, Darla lives. Yes. I'm unaware of any deities the vampire worships. But if you'd like to pray... ...now would be the time. Don't do this. - What are you waiting for? - For you. I need your permission. You've earned a choice. Accept your death so that she may live or.... Or what?! Leave. Refuse the challenge and walk away. No one will stop you. - Our doors are open. - What about Darla? - Oh, she dies. - No deal. I expected as much. A pity. I like you. Spare me. I'd very much like to. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Isn't the world a better place with you in it? You can save so many people. It seems she can barely save herself. The world can be a very bad place. Take yourself out, and how long will it be before she stumbles? I don't know. No, you don't. Are you still ready to give your life when she can promise you nothing? Yes. As you wish. No. Do it. No! Angel! Congratulations. You've passed the third test by accepting death. No one's ever gone that far before, in terms of sacrifice. - Kudos. - Pay up. Of course. You're a lucky woman. Soon you'll have your whole life ahead. Use it wisely. Hey, unless this fortune cookie crap is some new torture... ...let's get on with it. This way, miss. - What? - What is it? - This is very embarrassing. - What is? Not to mention unprecedented. She's been given new life once before. By supernatural means? - They brought me back. - What are you saying? - I can't help you. - We had a bargain. She's earned a second chance. She's living her second chance. But you played magnificently. You should've told us she was brought to life before this. I truly am sorry, sir. The fact of the matter is, there's nothing I can do. Angel. It may be different. We don't know. Maybe, because, you know, I have a soul... - ...if I did bite you-- - No. We don't know what it'll do. Angel, I've seen it now. Everything you're going through... ...everything you've gone through. I felt it. I felt how you care the way no one's ever cared before. Not for me. - That's all I need. - It's not enough. It is. How could The Powers bring you back... ...and take a second chance away like this? Maybe this is my second chance. To die? Yes, to die. The way I was supposed to in the first place. I'm not gonna leave you. Every moment you have left, I'm gonna be by your side.
