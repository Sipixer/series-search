People are drawn to it, People... ...and other things, They come for all sorts of reasons, My reason? No surprise there, It started with a girl, She was a really, really pretty girl. No, I mean.... She was a hottie girl. She had.... I mean, her hair... ...was.... You know? You kind of remind me of her. Because.... Because, you know, the hair. I mean, you both have hair. A shark! Oh! - We want to cash out. - Yeah, sure. Girls are nice. Here you go, pal. Thank you. Come on, let's go. Let's go find some real fun. You really know the doorman? You can get us into Lido? I don't want to go clubbing. I want to party right here. Hey, back off! Shut up and die. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Anyone seen my car? It's big and shiny. Piss off, pal. Breath mint? You shouldn't have done that. Oh, my God. They were.... Go home. Thank you. Get away from me. I like the place. Not much of a view... ...but it's got a nice "Bat Cave" sort of air to it. Who are you? Doyle. - You don't smell human. - That's a bit rude. As it happens, I'm very much human. On my mother's side. I come uninvited, so you know I'm not a vampire like you. What do you want? I've been sent. - By the powers that be. - Powers that be what? Let me tell you a little bedtime story. But I'm not sleepy. Once upon a time, there was a vampire. He was the meanest vampire in all the land. Other vampires were afraid of him. He was such a... ...bastard. Then one day, he's cursed. By gypsies. They restore his human soul. Suddenly, he's mad with guilt. "What have I done?" He's freaked. Okay... ...now I'm sleepy. Well, it's a fairly dull tale. I feel it needs a little sex. So, sure enough, enter the girl. Pretty little blond thing. Vampire slayer by trade. Our vampire falls madly in love with her. Eventually, the two of them get fleshy with one another. The moment he-- I guess the technical term is "Perfect Happiness." But when our boy gets there... ...he goes bad. He kills again. It's ugly. When he gets his soul back for the second time... ...he figures he can't be near her... ...without endangering them both. What does he do? He takes off. Goes to L.A... ...to fight evil, and atone for his crimes. He's a shadow. A faceless champion of the hapless human race. You wouldn't have a beer in here, would you? No. You must have something besides pig's blood. You've told me the story of my life, which since... ...I was there, I already knew. Why aren't I kicking you out? Now I'm gonna tell you what happens next. This vampire, he thinks he's helping. Fighting the demons. Staying away from humans to avoid temptation. Doing penance in his little cell. But he's cut off... ...from everything. From the people he's trying to help. I still save them. Who cares if I don't stop to chat? When was the last time you drank blood? Buffy. Left you with a bit of a craving. Let me tell you something. That craving's gonna grow. One day, one of those helpless victims you don't care about... ...will look too appetizing to turn down. And you'll figure, "What's one against all I've saved? Might as well eat them. I'm still ahead by the numbers." I'm parched from this yakking, man. Let's go treat me to a Billy Dee. It's not about fighting and gadgets and such. It's about reaching out. Showing them that there's love and hope. - Spare change? - Get a job, you lazy sow. It's about letting them in your heart. It's not just saving lives, it's saving souls. Hey! Possibly your own in the process. I want to know who sent you. I'm honestly not sure who sent me. They don't speak to me direct. I get... ...visions. Great splitting migraines that come with pictures. A name, a face. I don't know who sends them. Whoever sends them is more powerful than us. - They're trying to make things right. - Why me? You got potential. - The balance sheet ain't in your favor. - Why you? We all got something to atone for. Had a vision this morning. When the blinding pain stopped, I wrote this down. Tina? Pretty girl. Needs help. Help with what? That's your business. I just take the names. - I don't get it. How am I supposed--? - Get into her life, remember? Get involved. Look, high school's over, bud. You gotta make with the grown-up talk now. Why would a woman I've never met talk to me? Have you looked in the mirror lately? No, I guess you really haven't. I'm not good with people. That's the whole point of this little exercise, isn't it? Are you game? Tina, I gotta do it by seniority. Everyone wants to work extra hours. It's just.... I just need.... I'm good for Saturday nights. If people want to go out... ...I'll double-shift, whatever. You're on the list, okay? Thanks. Sure is a cute... ...doggy. So, do you...? How late are you open? You talking to me? Wow! Good reflexes. Thanks. These come out of my paycheck. So... ...are you... ...happy? What? You looked sort of down. You been watching me? No, I just.... I was looking towards there... ...and you walked... ...through there. You don't hit on girls very often, do you? It's been a while. I'm sort of new in town. Do yourself a favor. Don't stay. You never answered my question. Am I happy? You got three hours? Do I look busy? I get off at 10. I suddenly feel underdressed. Did you want a drink? I know who you are, what you're doing here. Stay away from me. Tell Russell to leave me alone. I don't know any Russell. - You're lying. - No, I'm not. - Why were you watching me? - Because you looked lonely. I figured then we have something in common. Oh.... I'm sorry. - I'm really-- - It's okay. No, it's not. I'm sort of having relationship issues. Who's Russell? I'd like to help. Only help I need is a ticket home. And that wasn't me asking for money. Where's home? Missoula, Montana. - You've been there? - During the Depression. My depression. I was depressed there. - But it's pretty. - Yeah. Lots of open land. Lots of nothing else. I came here to be a famous movie star... ...but they weren't hiring. Well, I have a fabulous... ...Hollywood party to go to. Hence the glamour. Girl giving it owes me my security deposit. It was nice threatening you. You need a lift? Tina! Smile for the camera. Who is this hunk of tall, dark and handsome? Just a friend. Margo, I really need to talk to you. Grab yourself a drink, I'll be right there. Cute. Everyone's a star. Who's Russell? Someone I made the mistake of trusting. Here I am. - This won't take long. - I wouldn't leave that one unattended. You are a beautiful, beautiful man. - Thanks. - You're an actor. - No. - That wasn't a question. I'm Oliver. Ask anyone about Oliver, they'll tell you I'm a fierce animal. I'm your manager as soon as you call. I'm not an actor. I like the humor. I like the whole thing. Call me. This isn't a come-on. I'm in a serious relationship with a landscape architect. You know, they asked me to come and read a third time. I'm an actress! I don't put up with things like that. Cordelia? Oh, my God! Angel? Nice to see a familiar face. Are you living here? Yeah. You? Malibu. A condo. Not on a private beach... ...but I'm young, so I forbear. And you're acting? Can you believe it? I just started it to make some quick cash... ...and then, boom. It was like, my life. So... ...are you still...? Yeah. There's not actually a cure for that. Right. But you're not evil? You're not here to... ...bite people? No, I gave a friend a ride. Oh, good. I better get mingly. I really should talk to people that are somebody. But it was fun! It's nice that she's grown as a person. She doesn't have the money yet. Who's that? Stacy. He's just a creep. Can we please go? Yeah. He wants to see you, that's all. Okay. Okay, no problem. Damn it! I don't know you. Don't get involved. Tina, get in the car. You know what? You're not gonna shoot. Good call. Nice party, huh? A little too fabulous for me. You have one new message, Cordy, it's Joe at the agency, No luck, again, Having trouble booking auditions, Networks say they've seen enough, No need to call, I'll buzz you if something changes, Bye, You have no more messages, My Girl Scout training. I can live out of this bag for days if I have to. I made some tea. Thanks. - Do you take milk and sugar? - Yeah. Because I don't have those things. I don't get a lot of visitors. At least not ones you like. I have relationship issues too. I guess this is the part where you comfort me. Not like you didn't earn it. No. This is the part where you have a safe place to stay. You don't want-- You have enough people taking advantage. Boy, are you ever in the wrong town.... Thanks. Did Russell have a last name? You don't need to know it. You've done enough already. This is L.A. Guys like him get away with murder. Who did he murder? I don't know. Maybe nobody. He likes.... He likes pain. I mean, he really does. He talks about it like it's a friend of his. And you don't leave him. He tells you when he's had enough. I knew this girl, Denise. She tried to get away. She disappeared off the face of the earth. He finds you. Not anymore. No! No! - Tina. - No! No! It's all right. He was here. I'm here. Easy.... Did Denise have a tattoo on her left shoulder? She had a rose. I think she was murdered. There've been others. He picks girls with no one to care. You don't have to be afraid. Look, you're safe here. Why do you have that? You knew who I was when you walked in there last night. No, I didn't. Look, I just-- I had your name. It's complicated. I'm sure. Big complicated game that Russell is playing with my head. - What's he paying you? - He's not. You're just like him! You stay away from me. Please, listen to me. Russell. I've been looking everywhere for you. And here you are right under my nose. Oh, I own the building. Most of the block. Are you gonna point that at me all day? What did you do to Denise? - Nothing. - I want the truth, Russell. She wanted to go home. I bought her a ticket to Pensacola. She's dead. What do you mean? She called me yesterday. She's thinking of going back to school, wanted my help. Look, we both know I live outside the box... ...but I don't go around killing my friends. If you're sick of L.A., if you need rent.... You know, I only want to help you. Just tell me what you want. I want to go home. Done. Poor thing. Who's been spinning your head like this? I don't know, I thought you hired him. He turned into something. It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen. Well, you're young. The guy was called Stacy. First name or last? I don't know. Probably done some time. - I can ask around. - Great. Gray '87 Mercedes 300E. Gonna need some serious work on the bumper. - Call the chop shops. - I know a couple. He leads me to Stacy, Stacy leads me to Russell. You couldn't have known she'd run. Let's get to work. - You can't cut yourself off-- - Doyle. I don't want to share my feelings. I don't want to open up. I want to find the guy that killed Tina and look him in the eye. Then what? Then I'm gonna share my feelings. Mr. Winters, the Eltron merger is a go. They caved on everything after you... ...negotiated with their CFO. We'll bring the papers by tomorrow. She had something, didn't she? I was sorry to kill her so soon. Actually, you haven't seen her in several weeks. You were in conference yesterday when the unfortunate incident occurred. We've located a witness who says he saw a dark-complected man there. Impressive. Wolfram and Hart is a full-service law firm, Mr. Winters. It's our job to make sure that our clients' lives run more smoothly. Who is this? Fresh face. I think we should meet. Should I alert the firm that she may constitute a long-term investment? I don't think so. I just want something to eat. Where does he live? Whatever she was to you, you better forget it. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Russell? Let me guess. Not big on the daylight or mirrors. Drinks V8. You get in his way, he'll kill you and everyone you care about. There's nobody left I care about. "I am somebody. I matter. People will be attracted to my positive energy and help me achieve my goals. I am right where I'm supposed to be..." ...and not dying for something to eat! Hello. Cordelia Chase. Cor, it's Margo. You were such a hit at my party. Oh, thanks. Well, guess who saw my videotape of the party... ...and guess who wants to meet you. A director? A manager? An assistant to an assistant who wants lunch? Russell Winters. The investment guy? Oh, Cordelia. He is a lot more than that. He helps people get started in their careers. He knows everyone, and he wants to meet you tonight. Tonight? He'll send a limo for you at 8. You're really going to war here. I guess you've seen a few. Fourteen. Not including Vietnam. They never declared it. "People will be attracted to my positive energy... ...and help me achieve my goals." Oh, yeah. Best of luck to you. I got money on the Vikings tonight, but I'll be there in spirit. You're driving. Wait a minute. No, no. I'm not combat ready, man. - I'm just a messenger. - And I'm the message. I'm Russell. Thank you so much for coming. That'll be all, Franklin. We'd like to be alone. Wow. What a nice place. I love your curtains. Not afraid to emphasize the curtains. I have old-fashioned tastes. I grew up in a nice home. It wasn't like this, but we had rooms that we didn't know what were for. Till the IRS got all huffy about my folks not paying their taxes... ...for, well, ever. They took it all. Margo tells me you're an actress. - That's going well? - Oh. Yeah, it's great. I've had a lot of opportunities. The hands in the LiquiGel commercial were almost mine by a few girls... ...and, well.... It's not everything I.... How you doing? I think we're lost. We're looking for Roscomere. Hey, what are you watching there? Is that the game? Tie him up. I'm out in 10 minutes or I'm not coming out. I've tried really hard, you know? Usually when I set out to do something I succeed at it right away. But I don't know anybody... ...and I don't really have any friends here. Now you know me. And you don't have to worry anymore. What do you want me to do? Just tell me what you want. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm getting all weepy in front of you. I probably look really scary. I finally get invited to a nice place... ...with no mirrors... ...and lots of curtains. Hey, you're a vampire. - What? No, I'm not. - Are too. I don't know what you mean. I'm from Sunnydale, we had a hellmouth. I know a vampire... ...when I'm alone with him in his fortress-like home. I'm just feeling a little lightheaded from hunger. I'm just wacky and kidding. Truth is, I'm glad you know. We can skip the formalities. Russell Winters. Angel? I have a message... ...from Tina. You've made a very big mistake, coming here. You don't know who he is, do you? Oh, boy, you're about to get your ass kicked! Angel! Kill them! Angel! That's it. I'm gone. Damn it! It's a good gate. I had a little bit of an accident. We'll talk later. - Got it! - Finally. I thought I'd faint while barfing. Sorry. Okay, so it's over, right? We're gonna be okay. You put the fear of God in that Russell guy. He's not gonna come looking for me, right? The Eltron mutual trust binder is ready for your signature. Local authorities have no information on the intruder from last night. However, we do have several top private investigators that-- --are looking into his whereabouts. I believe we've located him. I'm with Wolfram and Hart. Mr. Winters has never been accused... ...and shall never be convicted of any crime. Ever. If you harass our client, we'll bring you into the light of day... ...a place, I'm told, that's not all that healthy for you. Angel. We do things a certain way in L.A. Well, I'm new here. But you're a civilized man. We don't have to go around attacking each other. Look at me. I pay my taxes, keep my name out of the paper... ...and I don't make waves. And in return, I can do anything I want. Really? Can you fly? Guess not. Set up an interoffice meeting at 4:00. It seems we have a new player in town. There's no need to disturb the senior partners with this. Not yet. Hello? Hello? What happened to Russell? He went into the light. Yet you don't seem to be in a celebrating mood. I killed a vampire. It didn't help anyone. You sure? There's a girl upstairs who's happy as can be. Oh, my God! A cockroach. In the corner. I'd say it's a bantamweight. Okay, first thing, we need to call an exterminator. And a sign painter. We should have a name on the door. Okay, I'm confused. Doyle filled me in on your little mission. So if we're going to be helping people out, maybe a small charge. A fee. Something to help pay the rent... ...and my salary. You need someone to organize things, and you're not rich... ...Mr. I-was-alive-for-200-years-and- never-got-an-investment-portfolio. - You want to charge people? - Not everybody. But sooner or later we are gonna have to help some rich people, right? Possibly, yeah. Hand me that box. We should charge... ...based on a case-by-case analysis, but with me working for a flat fee. I mean, that is...if you think you can use me? Of course, this is just temporary... ...until my inevitable stardom takes effect. Good choice. She'll provide a connection to the world. She's got a very humanizing influence. You think she's a hottie. She's a stiffener, all right. Can't lie about that. - But she could use a hand. - True. There's a lot of people in this city need helping.
