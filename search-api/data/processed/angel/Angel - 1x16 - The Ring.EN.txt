I don't know, how about "Demon Database"? A name rife with single entendre. Why isn't Wolfram and Hart here? - They're lawyers, not demons. - Fine line. They have a lot of entries. Did you know there's 12 species indigenous to L.A. County? Do they have the Vigories of Oden Tal? Nope. There's still a place in this world for traditional research. Some ugly critters in here. Someone ought to create an intrademon dating base. Like "Archfiend.org, where the lonely and the slimy connect." I was just joking, grouchy. When did you last have a dating base? For your information, I lead a rich and varied social life. Every night it's Jeopardy! then Wheel of Fortune... ...and a cup of hot cocoa. Look out, girls, this one can't be tamed. It may not be as intoxicating as a life erected on a push-up bra. Hey, if anyone's wearing a push-up bra around here it's.... - Angel. - Do you need a counselor? No, I'm way too "single entendre" to benefit from therapy. - Don't take it personally. - That's rich... ...coming from Mr. Don't Talk to Me Before I've Had My Oat Bran. Children, we have company. - Is one of you Angel? - I'm Angel. I'm Darin MacNamara. I checked around. You have a reputation for handling unusual problems. A richly deserved reputation. You all right? I think I'm gonna pass out. I'm sorry. It's just-- My brother Jack.... He was kidnapped last night. I found this in my mailbox today. Do you know who did this? Well, that's why I came to you. They weren't people. I'm a few years older than Jack. My brother and I haven't exactly been close since we grew up. I made something of my life, and Jack didn't. Thanks. I don't know what they want. There was just-- You were there when he was taken. Jack called me last night, asked me to come over. He has a gambling problem, said he was in over his head with a bookie. - Which one? - Ernie Nellins. He works at a sports bar in Silver Lake called Shots. I've paid him before. I told Jack this time to go to hell. I wanted him to suffer the consequences of his actions. - I didn't know this would happen. - It's not your fault. I felt guilty so I went over there, and there were these.... I don't know, creatures. Dragging him away. I tried to stop them. - You haven't heard from anyone? - No. I'll pay anything to get him back. He's my little brother. Look, my Colleagues will start looking... ...into whatever kidnapped your brother. In the meantime, write down everything you saw. Okay. Thank you. - What about the bookie? - I thought we'd have a little chat. This is wheat grass. I ordered the Kiwi Cooler. Give me that. How do you drink that swill? Give me two. Mind if I play, Ernie? - Game's invitation only, pal. - Then invite me. It's been a while, so I might be a bit rusty on the rules. But I think my jacks beat your pair. No, I'm not looking for a fight. Just for him. You should try wheat grass. It's good for digestion. - Who are you? - A friend of Jack's. Jack doesn't have any friends. Just people he doesn't owe. His brother will pay his debts. Out of my hands. It's not about the money anymore. - It's about making Jack an example. - Piece by piece? - Makes an impression on newcomers. - Where is he? - They didn't say and I didn't ask. - It doesn't mean you don't know. There's a place... ...in Beachwood Canyon, WelI, not exactly in Beachwood Canyon, Under it, actually, Okay, I'm in, What did Darin write about the demons that took Jack? Bald, ultrawhite skin, slime. There's always slime. It's why I don't gamble. You make a small wager one day... ...and then Beetlejuice-y albino comes a-knocking. - Claws or hands? - He wrote "clawlike hands." - Could be a mixed breed. Smell? - Sulfuric. Add a Porsche and hair plugs and I've dated this guy. A lot. - Other distinguishing characteristics? - An eerie, high-pitched wail. Probably when it's preparing to fight or mate. First I say "yuck" and then I hit search. By the time you get done entering all this into your fancy database... - ...I could've located it-- - Got it. "A Howler Demon." Yikes, - Where's Jack MacNamara? - Not here. - Where is he?! - We sold him. Who did we sell him to? Okay, go ahead. - Thank you. - Thank you. Next, please. Tickets. You're quick. - Thank you. - No problem. Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! The winner, Tom Cribb. Time: six minutes, 22 seconds. If you're keeping track, that was Cribb's 7th career kill. Our next contest features one of the more popular fighters. A rare find, from the barren wastelands! A true champion who's got it all, skill, speed and strength. Let's give it up for the "Menace of Venice"... ...the "Titan of Terror"... ...the "Umpire of Agony"... ...the one, the only... ...Val Trepkos! You made it. Most don't. Careful, Jack. You should've seen what he did to the Howlers. You set me up. It was a group effort. Let's get a look at those teeth. Teeth tell a lot about the bones. I told you to be careful. This one's got some attitude. That's good. He'll be a crowd pleaser. I asked for a room with a view. Guess you don't speak English. We'll have so much to talk about during the long winter nights. Listen up, slaves. There's only one rule. It's real simple, so you demons can remember. Stay inside the red. That wristband will make sure you do. I know what you're thinking. You want to tear my throat out. But you won't. Because there's only one way out. When that band comes off. And the only way that band comes off is after your 21st kill. I'm not killing anyone. Then you'll be killed. Either way, fans get their money's worth. Please let us know if you hear from him. Thank you. - Cop lady hasn't talked to him? - No. She seemed like she didn't care either. - He's a missing person. - He's only gone one night. He was supposed to check in with us and didn't. And he's not someone who tans well. He's probably holed up, waiting for nightfall. Maybe. But still, something's very wrong. Our client, who should be waiting by the phone, is nowhere to be found. Right. Keep trying to track him down. - What are you doing? - Following his footsteps. - You're going to the bookie? - That's where he went. Who gets his jollies cutting off people's extremities? That's why I'm taking this. Along with a few other things. Looks like good gruel. Who the hell are you? I'm Angel. What you are is a soon-to-be-dead slave. Shut up. - Cribb, that's mine! - And now it's mine. Give it back. Open your mouth again, I'll close it for good. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Angel, guess how many vampires I've killed. Catch you later. - Why'd you do that? - You're welcome. I can fight my own battles. I got two wins already. So just another 19 and you're out? That's right. You think I can't cut it? You want a piece of me? No, not really. What's wrong with you? Don't be rocking the boat, this is life and death. All right, girls, listen up. Here's tonight's card. Lasovic, you're fighting Baker. Trepkos, you're the main event. You'll go against Mellish. That's an execution. Shut your trap, slave. No one's talking to you. I'm walking out of there tonight. You better know that. No! - We paid good money for that one. - It's all right. It's an object lesson for the others. - We'll have to find a replacement. - What about Captain America here? Ice helps keep the swelling down. You got a hard head, boy. Stop that. Who's this? Wesley Wyndam-Price. I'm looking for my employer. - He asked about Jack MacNamara. - I'm kind of busy here. Where is he? Your boss? He gave me $200 to answer his questions. I'm a businessman. Make an offer. The man I work for means a great deal to me. I will not give you a single red cent. What I will do is beat it out of you if I have to. You're from another country? Are you Robin Hood? Please drop those. You can go now. Now where is my employer? Ladies and gentlemen, the MacNamara Brothers welcome you to a night... ...of high-voltage entertainment! - I heard something interesting. - What? - I heard the vampire has a soul. - I wouldn't know about that. When he's fighting, do you think that would be a plus or a minus? Depends on what he's fighting for. So you'll give me odds on him to win? I'll give you even money. I'll take that bet. Shouldn't go out there cold. Look, you did me one. Baker's fast, but his left eye got hurt two fights ago. Stay on his left, tie him up. You can drive his head right into the wall to get the kill. I'm not gonna kill anyone. You on drugs? It's not like you have a choice. All right, girls. Showtime. Baker's challenger makes his ring debut tonight. He's a highly skilled fighter with a taste for blood. Let's welcome Angel! That vampire's not even fighting! Those two are perfect. - Did you bring the badge? - No. - You said you--! - Sir, madam. I'm Detective Andrews. This is Detective Yelsew. Show them your badge. Write down their license number, 4, 3, Peter, Charlie, Edward. What are you doing? Sir, if you could give us your name. My name is Matthew Winslow, as in Winslow Multimedia. I'm a friend of your boss, Chief Tyler. We'll give him your best. Could I see your tickets? You'll be hearing from my lawyer tonight. Are you aware that you've purchased tickets to an unlicensed event? Answer the detective! If it's illegal, what are all these people doing here? We're trying to do you a favor, Mr. Winslow. Something's going down tonight. Something with the Man. - A raid? - We're not at liberty to say. But we could just go on home? I think that would be wise, sir. You almost blew it! I saved us. "Something's going down with the Man?" Idiot. Thinks he can get out of this by pulling a Ghandi. I think we found our missing client. Oh, my God! What is this? These Octavian matches date back to the Roman Empire. I'd heard rumors of a revival. Couldn't they just do West Side Story? What's with the bracelets? If they cross the red line while wearing one, they disintegrate. Oh. Oh, my God. Angel! Angel! Official time: seven minutes, 33 seconds. This marks the first of what promises to be... ...many more kills by the vampire, Angel! Angel! Angel! Trepkos and Mellish, showtime. Wait. If no one fights, no one dies. Quit moping. You're alive. Baker isn't. One lucky kill don't make you an expert. That wasn't the first life I've taken. Or the 21st. Trepkos, Mellish, let's go. We can fight them if we stop fighting each other. - Now. - I'm giving you another way out. I'll kill him quick. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up... ...for one of your favorite fighters, Val Trepkos! - We gotta call the police. - That's a bad idea. If they're not already in on this... ...then MacNamara would destroy the evidence. He'd kill the fighters. We've gotta get Angel out of there. To do that, we have to get him out of the cuffs. - They were made by ancient sorcerers. - So get an ancient key. I might be able to make one myself, if I could get one of the cuffs... ...which won't be easy-- Unless you procured one while I wasn't looking. - Well done. - Thank you. That was the most exciting match I've ever seen. My favorite part was when you stuck Baker with the knife. Kind of put a damper on the brotherhood spiel. What'd you expect? You're a demon, like the rest of them. The difference is, they know their place. Somebody needs to put you in yours. You and your brother. Someone may...someday. But not you, and not today. Why put off till tomorrow what you can do today? Any closer and he's dead. Tell me how to get this off. How does it open? Is there some kind of a key? Where's the key, Jack? Check his pockets. Cribb. Trepkos. Any of you. A little help would be nice. Or I can just do it myself. What did I tell you, huh? Now you're really alone. I got you. Get his brother! Look at him! Is this who you're all so afraid of going up against? How does it feel, Jack? Tell them how it feels to be in here. Come on! How does it feel to be a slave? Tell them! - Let him go. - As soon as you let us go. What do you think you are? Moses? You'll listen if you want your brother back. - Last chance. - Come on, Darin. There's only one way this can play out... ...so let's just get it done. He's your brother. Now he's my dead brother. How do you feel? Like I was hit by lightning after the truck ran me over. I remember you. We didn't get a chance to meet. I'm Lilah Morgan. You're a fight fan. And a lawyer. - Let me guess, Wolfram and Hart. - I'm an associate here. After some arm-twisting, I convinced MacNamara to sell your contract. He knows keeping you would be too much trouble. Congratulations, you're free. As long as I pretend it never happened. That MacNamara and his circus don't exist. That is the deal, isn't it? It's a big city, Angel. A lot of people need your help. You're a good Samaritan and this pact with the devil is just an act? Sometimes you have to compromise. Look the other way when Wolfram and Hart are involved? I prefer to think of it as picking the battles you can win. There's not one reason why we can't work together. You're right. There are about a thousand. I saw what you did to Baker, so I know you want to survive. This is your only chance. Take it. Thanks for the champagne. Relax. Take me back. Don't people get enough violence watching Springer? Cordelia, do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate. You've been concentrating all night. It's taken this long to translate the text. I need something that conducts electricity, but not too much of it. This cuff is half magic, half medieval technology! If I've read the alchemists correctly, all I need-- Ouch! Are you okay? Perhaps something that conducts a little less electricity. He was free. Bloodsucker's crazier than I thought. Think you're proving something by coming back? They didn't help you before. They won't help you now. They know the only way out of here is by himself. You'll find that out soon, because tonight you're gonna fight Trepkos. Smart money says he's walking out. You're his 21st kill. Too thick. Tick, tick, Wesley! I don't know what else to try. We need something supple enough to thread... ...but strong enough to spring the release. Horsehair. - Horsehair? - From Keanu. My palomino before the IRS took him away. Horsehair. Well, we tried just about everything else. Ten thousand on Trepkos. Tonight's match features a new favorite in the ring... ...a vampire. Please welcome, for the second night in a row... ...and still fresh from his first kill, Angel! His opponent is a favorite who needs no introduction. This marks his 21st and final fight. Let's give a special welcome to a true champion, Val Trepkos! Is this how you want to pay for your freedom? With 21 bodies? You'll always be their slave even if they take that cuff off. - I'll kill you quick. - I won't let you. Vampire's gonna get his head ripped off. Maybe his heart torn out. What a loser. Can you help me? I'm a little lost. I'm looking for the ladies' room. They said it was this way. Or is it up a level? Excuse me! Come here. Yes, you. I need to see Angel. Tall fellow, prominent brow. Yeah, he's dead. - Dead? - He will be. He's fighting Trepkos. Who the hell are you? A friend. Perhaps we can help each other. - I have a key. - A key? Help me save Angel and I'll get all of you out. If we band together-- Give that back! Hey! - What happened? - One of them took my key. Angel can't last. We have to do something now! We will. Killing blow! Killing blow! Angel! Angel! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Killing blow! Both of them. Call them off. Screw you. Give me your wrist... ...loser. You stupid slave. You had your 21... ...but you had to ruin it for everybody else. Trepkos... ...catch. - Easy. - Thanks. - Thanks. - It was a good fight. I could've taken you. Angel, you don't look so.... - It's a good thing you heal fast. - Yeah. It's also a good thing you found me. We weren't gonna let anything happen to you. I mean, beyond the slavery and the severe beatings. Wesley came up with the key. But Cordelia came up with the key to the key. You both did great. I think we did a good thing here tonight. Yes, we set the captives free. Actually, didn't we set
