I know. You keep saying that. But I need Doyle. You can fold time. Bring him back. To what end? To nullify his noble death? - To leave his atonement unfulfilled? - If it means he lives. - He doesn't so that you may. - You do so that others will. He's my friend. If that is so, then so shall it ever be. - But it is of no consequence. - The war rages on. Do not come to us again on so self-serving a matter. There's one consequence, even by your generous standards. He was my sole contact to The Powers That Be. Without his visions, I'm fighting blind. All will soon be made clear. For every door that closes, another opens. And for every one that opens.... - What are you looking for? - Nothing. Doyle's special coffee mug. Doyle didn't have one. Don't you think he should've? I guess I thought it would make me feel better... ...if I could hold something that he left behind. Some evidence he was here. But there's nothing. Almost like... - ...like he never-- - Cordelia. Get out. - What? - I mean, of the office. Take the day off. Go live a bit. I can manage here. I know what you're doing, Angel. - What? - You're pushing me away. - Close yourself off. - That's not-- I've got news for you. We're all we've got now. You don't like sharing grief, but it's the normal way of dealing with loss. I'm not going anywhere, so get used to it. I'm staying right here. I gotta go. Audition. If it wasn't a national, I'd blow it off. - Don't go if you don't feel up to it. - Reverse psychology. Very cute. - I'm going. - I'm not-- - Don't get any ideas. I'll be back. - Right. - You scared the heck out of me. - You? I scared you? Look in the mirror lately? Every chance I get. You're him, right? You're the guy. The vampire with the soul? - I'm Angel. - You gotta help me. Please. I mean that's what you do, right? You help the helpless. You protect the, what do you call them? The helpless. - Something like that. - Should I stay? - That's okay. - Break a leg. - Excuse me? - I sense a little performance anxiety. - Little trick, picture everybody-- - In their underwear. I was gonna say dead. But, hey, if that underwear thing works.... So... - ...what's the problem? - Call me Barney. First off, you should know, before there's any misunderstanding... ...I'm a demon. - I appreciate your candor. - Secondly, it's 3:45 in the afternoon. Middle of the day. Why aren't you in your coffin? Coffin. I hate that stereotype. - Do you know anything about vampires? - What I learned from TV. Vampires don't use coffins. It's a misconception... ...made by writers and the media. We can move around as long as we avoid direct sunlight. Got it? Sorry. Didn't want to push any sore spots. Okay, let's try this whenever you're ready. Action. Look at this wine stain. I can't meet your folks like this. Don't worry, honey. It's no problem with extra-strength StainBeGone. - Extra-strength StainBeGone? - Yep. Now StainBeGone is more effective at melting away... ...stubborn blood, wine... ...even grass stains. See? Just spray it on... ...and rub it in... ...and in minutes... ...the stain is gone. It's completely gone. - Okay, that was.... - Good. That was good. - Very nice. - Good, good. But I think what we're going for is more of a-- - Happy. - Happy, yeah. - An "up" feeling about cleaning. - Because stains are-- - Not good. - Exactly. I'm sorry. It's an interesting choice. Let's try again. We'll go from: - "StainBeGone is more effective." - Yeah. Now, StainBeGone... ...is more... ...effective! Grass stains! - Okay, nice adjustment. - Thanks. We'll let you know. - What's hunting you? - I don't know. But whoever it is... ...he's unstoppable, like a machine. Been on my tail through a few states. Ever since Phoenix. Pulled out all the stops to shake him, but he keeps on coming. You think he means you harm? He's not tracking me to tell me I won the Publishers Clearinghouse. He's an assassin, - Is he a demon? - He could be, He knows all the hangouts. Wherever I go... ...he's just a step behind. It's a miracle I've eluded him this long. Why you? - What do you mean? - Who are you? That's what I'm saying. I'm nothing. I'm a nobody. I'm just a guy trying to get by. No different from everybody else. Been my experience that when one is being pursued tenaciously... ...it's because the pursuer has a strong grievance. Hey, I never said I was a boy scout. I'm an Empath demon. I can read emotions. Gives me a slight advantage at cards. Blackjack, poker, and for the fights. So you're a cheat. I think of it as going with my strengths. Look, whatever. I'm a demon. Sure, I'm evil. But, hey, I'm not, you know, "evil." You don't have beef with anyone? No one. But like my old man always said, "Can't please everybody." So you gonna help me? Hi. Everything okay? Okay. Cordelia, that was-- I think you're acting out of grief. - You're confusing our-- - I didn't feel anything. - Did you feel anything? - No, that's what I'm trying-- That means that I still have it. I can't believe he did this to me. - Who did what? - Doyle. I thought our kiss meant something. Instead, he used the moment... ...to pass it on to me. Why couldn't it have been mono or herpes? I didn't ask for this responsibility, unlike some who shall remain lifeless. I have nothing to atone. If they know what's good for them, The PTB better stay out of my head. Powers That Be. - You had a vision. - Boy, howdy! You know how they look painful? They feel a whole lot worse. Another door opens. - You're my link to The Powers now. - I'm nobody's link. I lost control of my entire central nervous system with that vision. And I'm not certain, but I think I may have drooled a little. - It's my first audition in weeks. - What was it? StainBeGone. A national, no less. Probably never call me again. - What was the vision? - Who knows? It was a thing. - A thing? - An ugly, gray, blobby thing. - What difference does it make? - This could be a dangerous thing. I want it out. If kissing's the only way to get rid of it... ...I will smooch every damn frog in this kingdom. Oh, thought I heard voices. Barney, you remember my associate, Cor-- --delia? Maybe not every frog. Boy, I gotta say, I like the way you people treat your clients. Excuse me. - He's a client? - Something's after him. - The ugly, gray, blobby thing? - You tell me. Try sketching it. In the meantime, Barney would feel safer downstairs. Babysit him. - Where are you going? - His apartment. He thinks it knows where he lives. Behave yourself. I don't want to find you two necking on the couch. Hello, Angel. Wesley. - Never thought you'd see me again? - I didn't think about it. What are--? Hup, hup, hup. I'm the one asking questions here. And I think it only fair to warn you: Any sudden movement and I'll be forced to-- Right. You had a question? Interesting look for you. Motorcycle. The Watchers' Council trying out a new image? In point of fact, I no longer work for the Council. I believe I am of greater value to the cause, working autonomously. - They fired you. - Hardly. With Buffy unwilling to follow orders... ...there was no opportunity to function as Watcher. And that's why I became a rogue demon hunter. - You're a demon hunter? - Rogue demon hunter, yes. I'm on the trail of a nasty bugger right now. - I suggest you stay out of my way. - Easy, tiger. I think you're making a mistake. This demon seems harmless to me. He's left a trail of mutilated corpses. - Mutilated? - Each victim possessed a unique power. Telepathy, poisoned tongues, healing hands. The physical source of their power was ripped and torn from their corpses. - He's collecting powers. - To what purpose, I can only guess. The fiend's cut a swath across half the continent. Almost caught it in Phoenix. Got a fair look too. - Kind of short? Ruddy complexion? - Short? No, on the contrary. Quite enormous and powerful. More of a yellow-green. It seems to be secreting some sort of viscous fluid. Like that? I hear drawing can be very therapeutic during a grieving period. - What? - I'm sorry. Couldn't help sensing your pain. You just lost someone close to you, didn't you? - Angel told you? - No, I'm empathic. I feel your feelings when you feel them. - It's a gift my kind is blessed with. - Really? My kind believes in privacy. You shouldn't nose around other people's feelings without asking. You're right. I'm sorry. Just trying to make conversation. Wait. Barney, I'm sorry. I'm just going through a difficult time right now. I'm just-- Missing your friend. - Why don't you tell me about him? - Doyle? He drank too much and his taste in clothing was like a Greek tragedy. And he could be really sweet sometimes. You'll like this. He was half demon, a secret he kept from me forever. I guess that's why he sometimes smelled weird. You remind me a little of him. I'll take that as a compliment. That's him. - Barney. - He's after me! Barney, it's okay. The books are over there. Good lord. Cordelia? Angel never mentioned. Well, what a nice... ...surprise. - Didn't work! - No? I think it went better than last time. No. It was just a kind of experiment. I was trying.... Wesley? What are you doing here? Are you working with Angel? A lone wolf never works with anyone. I'm only allowing Angel to assist me. - Wow. - I'm a rogue demon hunter now. Wow. What's a rogue demon? So you're saying, all this time your friend wasn't hunting me... - ...but what was hunting me? - That's about the size of it. - Why is the other thing after me? - It wants your empathic ability. The feeling feelings thing? - What kind of demon would do this? - A Kungai. - Kungai? - The description matches. It's of Asian origin, very deadly. "A powerful race of demons, the Kungai possess a Tak horn... ...capable of consuming its opponent's life force." - We're lucky to have escaped alive. - Hey, I know these Kungais. They're relentless killers. - You gotta take it out. - I'm on it. I have to find it first. Hang on. It's of Asian origin. I tracked it through an Asian district just north of here. - Koreatown. - It's very likely it's hiding there. - That's where I'll start looking. - Don't you mean "we"? - I work alone, Wesley. - The hell, you say. This demon is mine. Angel! I know how to track him. You're not catching him without me. I had somebody at my side. He's dead now. I won't let that happen again. I work alone. - You don't even know where to start. - I have an idea. Yes. Well. - Are you all right, Wesley? - No. These pants chafe one's... ...legs. Hey, do you know where they do the shiatsu massages? That's kind of nice. - What is it? - I don't know. I don't know! I don't know. You're frustrated. That's one spooky talent. You can just look at me... ...grinding my teeth, grunting, and sense that I'm frustrated? - Amazing. - It's good at sensing sarcasm too. - Can I help? - Only if you can explain... ...why I have to suffer splitting migraines... ...getting visions so vague they require closed captioning. What do you mean, visions? My friend Doyle used to get brain flashes, messages from The PTB. The Powers That Be. Visions of all sorts of stuff. People in trouble... ...things causing trouble, places trouble's happening. - And he left you that inheritance? - I'm never gonna forgive him. What? Choosing you? Trusting you with an enormous responsibility? Believing that you were the only one worthy... ...of such a rare and important gift? Did I mention the drooling? I get the impression Doyle didn't have much by way of possessions? No. No, he didn't. Seems like he gave you the most valuable thing he had. I hope you like your coffee black, because the boss's lightener... - ...is O-positive. - Black is great. Hank, it's me. Of course I got the Kungai horn. In a safe place. But listen... ...I think I just found something even better. It's strong and a little clumpy. I can't brew the old-fashioned way. I'm more the "auto-drip." Sorry. Yes, you are. - What? - Sorry. Pathetic, really. Thanks for that insight, Mr. Emotional Radar. - How old are you? - That's none-- Twenty-something? With your head in the clouds... ...and your feet in shoes you can't afford... ...all self-absorbed, full of regret. Poor little Cordelia with her delusions of an acting career. - Delusions? - You don't think you'll succeed? - You're a terrible actress. - You've never seen me. - How could you possibly know? - Because you know. You feel it. Your entire being is whispering it to me right now. Me, on the other hand? You must admit I'm a fine actor. Fooled you. You dislike the truth. No wonder Doyle never showed his demon half. You don't know anything about me or Doyle. I know you let him die. - That is not true. - No, but it feels true, doesn't it? Mixed in with all the pain and grief, a healthy dollop of guilt. A nagging thought that, somehow, you could've saved him. If you'd been nicer to him. If you'd let your walls down. If only for one freaking second... ...you gave a damn about anyone besides yourself, huh? - Let me-- - Shut up! So you hate your gift, the visions? You'd love to rip those pretty eyes out of your head. I know I would. - I don't know your language. - I do. I think I recognize the dialect. Then it's good you came by. - The wound wasn't fatal. - It wasn't. Look at his head. His Tak horn's broken. Not...stick...not...not dying... ...horn. I think he's trying to say his horn was taken. Yes, but by whom? Good. Terror. I feel it. You have no idea what a rush it is. Keep it coming. The horn was taken. His horn was taken for something. The "Klu-Ka." I don't know that word. Yes. Fish...fish will die... ...not fish.... More...die more? Oh. He says more will die. - Okay, how? Who? - No good losing patience. He's dying and I'm not fluent. A vision. I'm having a vision. A demon! A creepy, little-- You! It's definitely you! - You're in great, great-- - Danger? Pain. I really don't want to hurt you. Bruises bring down the price. Help! But not by much. Hit the cherry? Slam the cherry? Oh, no. Oh, dear. Stop? Stop the demon? Red... ...heart...reader. He was trying to describe his killer. Demon...heart...reader.... Empath demon. Barney. That's too much trouble. I'll get the eyes and dump the body. We get an extra thousand if the seer's eyes are intact. Drop it. Fine. - Shouldn't you be cataloging flesh? - Yeah, whatever. Cordelia! Cordelia! - This is all my fault. - We both left her here. Neither of us knew. I should have. All this time, I've been tracking the wrong demon. - If anything happens to her-- - It won't. I won't allow it. This is me, looking for a clue. Feel free to join in. I'm a fraud. The Council was right to sack me. Yes, I was fired. I had two. Two slayers in my care. One turned evil and is now in a coma. The other's a renegade. Fire me? I'm surprised they didn't cut my head off. I'm useless. A fool. - A sniveling, great-- - Ugly, gray, blobby thing. Yes, I'm an ugly, gray, blobby-- What? It's a sculpture by Van Gieson. Maiden with Urn, Cordelia's vision. Could be where Barney took her. So we ascertain this sculpture's whereabouts, Cordelia's whereabouts. - Then you rescue her. - We rescue her. I need you. The Kungai said Barney wanted the horn for something. "Klu-Ka." You're the only one here who can translate that. You with me? Good. Got it. Maiden with Urn was sold to the Ramsey hotel chain in '82. Twelve hotels around here. It's got to be in one. I keep finding a translation for Klu-Ka... ...which translates as "caller sale," whatever that means. Caller. Caller sale. Yes, of course! I know what Klu-Ka is. - What? - "Auction." Sold! For 20,000 to number 118, the dapper gentleman in the aisle. Well done. You are the proud owner of an authentic Tak horn. Stab your enemies with it. It'll drain the life out of them. An investment in peace of mind. Next up, lot 32. We're very lucky to have this here today... ...a rare and beautiful find. I'm not a seer! I had a vision once... ...and I'm sure it was something I ate. The magnificent eyes of a seer. Your own pipeline to The Powers That Be. The possibilities are endless. Keep her as a slave... ...remove the head as a trophy or harvest the eyes. In any case... ...a unique party icebreaker. It doesn't get any better than this. We'll start the bidding at 2000, do I hear 2000? Two thousand. Do I hear 2500? Two thousand and five. Do I hear three? Three. Eight thousand, do I hear nine? Eyes of a seer, folks. I don't have to tell you what a rare find this is. Nine thousand. Nine gets me 10. Do I hear 10? 10,000? Ten thousand, do I hear 10? Ten thousand! Do I have 11 ? 11,000? Eleven thousand from the gentleman in the back. Do we have 1 2? Seer's eyes going at 11,000, do I hear 12? Ramsey Hotel, recently redecorated. The Van Gieson sculpture used to be there. Eleven thousand it is. Going for 11,000 once, twice-- Hey! You'd pay double for cataracts. My eyes are flawless even without visions! That's the best you can do? I have 12,000 from the gentleman. Do I hear 13? Thirteen? - Going for 12,000-- - You know what these eyes can do? They can see stuff, like danger... ...and evil, and locations of buried treasure! Thirteen thousand. Do I hear...? Have some huevos, guy! Whitey here's stepping all over you. You gonna take that from his kind? Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen, 17. - You decide, - Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty thousand from the gentleman in the center! Going once, going twice-- Thirty thousand! Sold for $30,000 to the lovely lawyer... ...from Wolfram and Hart. - You'll be happy with your purchase. - We don't need the body. My employers want the eyes extracted. An extraction is a very delicate process. We run the risk of damaging the gift. - It'll cost you an extra thousand. - Extraction is always included. - Not seers. - I never heard of that. There's never been something like this on the market. An extra thousand or you take it as is. - Go ahead. - Alrighty, then. Hank, give me the extractor. But.... I want to do it. You know that! - I've been begging-- - Hank, you're embarrassing yourself. Hand it over. - Convention halls? - Downstairs. - Where's the auction? - We have no auction. Where is it? It's in the Tulip Room. That way. Be a good girl and hold still. This will only hurt a lot. The sculpture's not here. As usual, one step behind. Hey, have you got a number? Hank, stakes. Get Cordelia! You all right? I'm so far not. Right, wrists. Wesley, come on! Okay, let's get out of here! Follow me! You! Butcher an innocent girl, huh? I'll thrash you within an inch of your life. Then I'll take that inch! Our merchandise was taken off the market. Three guesses by whom. Feel this, feeling-creepo! I never doubted for a minute you'd find me. I was lucky. I had a rogue demon hunter on my side. Glad I could be of service. Not that he didn't have it coming. He was a horrible, evil monster. - He did kill a lot of people. - Mutilated their corpses. Plus, he started the bidding on me at a paltry $2000. This I framed for saving my life... ...and as a reminder that something of Doyle's is here in our office. Well, I'll be off then. Farewell, Angel. Who knows when our paths will cross again. Wesley. - Do you know where you're headed? - Rogue demon hunters rarely do. Wherever evil lurks, wherever the dark forces threaten humanity... - ...that's where I'll be. - Oh, okay. Keep in touch. Yes. Yes, I will. But now, the evil lurking everywhere bids me onwards. So, I go. - Take care! - Yes. No rest for the wicked fighters. Through storm and rain, heat... ...famine... ...deep, painful, gnawing hunger... - ...I go. - Breakfast? Ooh! I suppose so. One of the perks of the job: After a night of fighting evil, we get eggs. - Toast? - Please. I'm famished. He's a good cook,
