DARLA: We did so many terrible things. CORDELIA: Did you and Darla...? ANGEL: Once. It was a dark time. Impossible. Vampires can't have children. - We did. WESLEY: It's human. You have a boy. - I'm going to have a son. DARLA: Our baby's gonna die. This child, it's the one good thing we ever did together. [CRYING] - I'm Mr. Dad. LILAH: Daniel Holtz. Angel massacred his family. He spent the rest of his life seeking revenge. Holtz: Go out and find others like you. People who have suffered as we have. GUNN: Wes thought Angel... FRED: Was going to kill Connor. LORNE: He's taken the baby away. HOLTZ: I'll take care of him as my own. - Son of a bitch! I'll never forgive you! You should have trusted us. Don't come back to the hotel. WESLEY: If you're offering a job, not interested. LILAH: Don't think you're too good for us. FRED: What is it about you that makes me melt? It's that I love you. - Connor. JUSTINE: Don't make me do it. HOLTZ: Come on, Justine. I sort of need to talk to you. I'm late. I'm late. ANGEL: What are you doing here? What you're being called to do transcends love. - You've become a higher being. - Me? - You murdered my father. - I didn't. She knows it. Connor! Never forget that I'm your father and that I love you. CORDELIA: I know somehow it's going to be all right. CONNOR: You don't get to die. You get to live forever. LORNE: Here you go. FRED: Thank you. GUNN: You gonna eat all that? FRED: Till I'm fat and happy. LORNE: These look good too. CORDELIA: Stuffing? CONNOR: What's that? CORDELIA: Sweet potatoes. LORNE: Pass those over here, doll. CONNOR: Are they good? CORDELIA: Try them. Back in Pylea, they used to call me sweet potato. Really? Yeah, well, the exact translation was "Fragrant Tuber," but... [CHUCKLING] You're not hungry? No, I'm starving. I just... I wanna freeze this moment. You. Connor. All of us. Safe and happy and together. Considering what we went through over this summer. To family. To family. As long as it's not mine. [CHUCKLING] You can't toast with an empty glass. - It's not bad luck, is it? - Angel, relax. Things are back to the way they should be... ...and nothing is ever going to break us apart again. And if anything tries... ...I'm going to have to go all glowy and personally kick its ass. I like it when you glow. Well, play your cards right... CONNOR: Do I have to watch this part? I could poke your eyes out. Come on, Dad. It'll stick up like yours. You should be so lucky. Let's eat. FRED: Rolls? LORNE: Hmm. Those look good. CORDELIA: Careful, those are hot. GUNN: Now we're talking. CONNOR: I like this. CORDELIA: I thought so. - Can I get the...? CONNOR: Delicious. - Carrots. FRED: Smells so good. GUNN: Get your hands out of my plate. FRED: Peas? CONNOR: Can I have the rolls? WESLEY: The salt, please. FRED: Kill me now before my stomach explodes. CORDELIA: Try the gravy. - It comes in a little boat. Could I get the...? Cordy, what...? Now look what you've done, silly. Freeze the moment, Dad. It'll last forever. Deep Down [GUNN GASPING] GUNN: You okay? - No. You? - Nope. - Nice we still do things together. How we doing? About the same. [FRED SCREAMS] FRED: Charles! Hang on. [GROWLING] GUNN: Your ass better be insured. - Worry about your own ass, <i>ese</i>. Warm bloods rolling down my street hassling my <i>hermanos</i>. It ain't gonna fly. - We're looking for the girl. GUNN: Tell us where she is. Who, Marissa? I thought you guys were supposed to be a couple detectives. Or was that before your buddy Angel went bye-bye? - We found you, didn't we? - And look what it got you. We just want to talk to her, that's all. Condemned building off Figueroa. Top floor. And tell her I want my CDs back, yeah? GUNN: We'll pass it along. - No, you know what? Better yet... ...I'll tell her myself. [GROWLING] Angel left you a little toy? More than one. Charles! [SCREAMING AND GROANING] [GRUNTS] Did you see that? Wasn't that cool? [CONNOR CHUCKLES] That was cool. FRED: You can't run off like that when we're supposed to be working. We've talked about that. - Their gang was getting away. GUNN: Let them. What you don't do is divide your strength. - Sorry. FRED: It was different in Quor-toth... ...but you're in Los Angeles now. You're taking on a big responsibility. You have to start thinking about more than just yourself. I know. I know. That thing with the axe was cool, huh? Yeah, that was tight. Now you get to clean it. - Vamp's dust. Nothing to clean. - Two coats of polish. We gonna tell him? - I don't wanna get his hopes up again. - What about yours? We have to keep trying. I'm not saying we shouldn't, but we spent the last three months... ...chasing dead ends trying to find Angel and Cordy... ...and the only thing we're closing in on is an eviction. It'd be a lot easier handling this crap with Lorne pitching in. Where's our future-reading empath when we need him? Mr. Big-Hit is too busy "Danke Schoen"-ing tourists... ...to care about us. - You try him again? - Like, 60 times. He's lost the mission, bro. We're about to lose this whole place, and you know you can't say "bro." We need to start hustling up some paying clients. We will, as soon as we find Marissa. Can I say "dog"? Oh, this looks good. "Condemned tenement on Figueroa." Could be her. Evil Dead was probably messing with us. Not much chance she knows anything. Angel's car was found by the bluffs. That used to be her feeding ground. She might be able to tell us what happened... ...if we can find her. CONNOR: Find who? ANGEL: Cordelia. - I didn't think you were coming. - You know me better than that. Better than anybody. [CHUCKLING] I don't know if that's true. Yes, you do. It's so beautiful here. ANGEL: Yes. Yes, it is. Just the way it should be. But it's not. This isn't how it happened. I know. I like this version better. It was Connor. He was here. He... I can't remember what it was like... ...not knowing you. Not being close to you. I'm in love with you, Angel. Deep down, I think I have been for a long time. I needed you to know that. I need you, Cordy. I need you. [ANGEL BITES] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [CORDELIA SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] So why didn't you tell me? We wanted to be sure. We don't even know if Marissa saw anything. - But she could have. FRED: Maybe. We're gonna talk to her and find out. - I'm coming. GUNN: No. - It's only one vamp. We can handle it. - He's my father. If she knows what happened to him, l... Okay. Go get your weapons. - Think that's a good idea? - I'll keep an eye on him. Getting information is a finesse job. He's a blunt instrument. You wanna tell him no? You saw how much he's hurting. How do you think he'll feel if all Vampirella saw was sand and seaweed? This is it. No Angel, no Cordy. We can't find Holtz... ...his psycho girlfriend's gone. Nothing. - There's still Wolfram and Hart. - We'll stroll into their guarded offices... ...and ask Lilah for help finding out what happened to their archenemy. But we're broke, so it'll have to be pro bono. I didn't say it would be easy. How's "impossible"? They're too big. Without Angel here, we can't afford to piss them off. - Maybe we should think about asking... - No. Well, I'm glad we talked it over. - We already asked him for help twice. - We'll ask him again. Wesley doesn't give a damn about us. Have we given him a reason to? He's made his choice. Now he has to live with it. [MOANING] That didn't suck. Well, maybe just a little bit. Perhaps that's something we can expand on next time. What makes you think there will be a next time? Because you can't resist me. I think you have that backwards. Where are you going? Snack break's over. Time to get back to work. And Wolfram and Hart does its best work after dark. The sun's bad for your complexion. Ask Angel. Oh, right, you can't... ...because of the whole "wanting to smother you with a pillow" thing. Wouldn't think kidnapping his son would have such a negative effect. You thought you were doing the right thing. I hear that can be confusing. Have you tried talking to him? Maybe when he gets back you could... [CHUCKLING] What? I have no idea where Angel is, Lilah, or what happened to him. And I really couldn't care. Wow. That was cold. I think we're finally making progress. Come on. Doesn't it bother you just a little bit, the not knowing? That part of my life is dead. It doesn't concern me now. No, it doesn't. It's time. Let's go for a boat ride. JUSTINE: So, what's it gonna be tonight, captain? Bicycle? Old tire? Or maybe we'll get real lucky... ...and catch us a nice shopping cart. Here's a wacky thought. Why don't you swim down there yourself? [BEEPING] No contact. We'll try the next grid. Do you really think finding Angel's gonna change anything? Everything changes. I guess anything's better than sitting around in my cage... ...with nothing to do but to fill my bucket. Perhaps you should've considered that before slitting my throat. The great Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. The shining beacon of all that's good and pure. But, wait, no. That's before he started... ...banging the enemy and keeping the slave girl in his closet. You were always a slave, Justine. You just couldn't see the chains. Thanks, swami. I'll meditate on that. You think she'd be disappointed? Who? Your sister. That's where it all began, isn't it? Sister murdered by a vampire. Consumed with the need for revenge. - For justice. - Is that what you call it? Turning a son against his father? Angel got what he deserved. We all get what we deserve. You and Holtz deserved each other. You two have so much in common. Pain, loss. Deep-seated lack of anything approaching humor. I don't know. We had a few laughs. Getting you to steal Angel's baby, that was a good one. Better than tricking Connor into sinking his father to the bottom of the ocean? Well, that was worth a couple of yuks too. Not much of a plan though, was it, really? Easy to figure out which door to kick in when Angel went missing. And not much harder to persuade you... ...to betray everything Holtz had given his life for. Not that it was worth very much. But you should know. You're the one that ended it. I'll take away your bucket. Or we could do it the loud way. It doesn't matter. Looks like she's out. Man, that's just nasty. I don't know how people live like this. FRED: Helps to be dead. - One more reason to stay pink and rosy. - Word. So, what do you think? From the smell, I'm guessing she still lives here. Should we wait... ...for her to come back or...? - No. [MUSIC PLAYS] We won't have to. FRED: Marissa, stop. We just want to talk. - I don't know anything. GUNN: You psychic? MARISSA: No. - Then let us ask a question. - You know the bluffs by the beach? - No. You used to feed there. Those bluffs. Three months ago a friend of ours went missing there. Tall? Good-Looking? Weird hair? FRED: You saw him? I see a lot of things. What do you care? He's my father. If you know... [CONNOR SCREAMS] You never let your guard down! FRED: Connor! If he ain't dead, I'm gonna kill him. What did you see? Look, whatever I saw, whatever I didn't see... ...it doesn't matter, okay? Come on, handsome. It'll be our little secret. GUNN: Connor? Connor! FRED: You all right? - Where is she? She attacked me. I had no choice. Maybe you would have if you weren't playing hero. Do you know what you just did? [CLATTERING] Connor! Three months of this and he dusts our lead. You know he wants to find Angel. How do you think he feels? It's not like he talks to me. After everything he's gone through, you need to be a bit more patient. He's just a boy. You sure about that? Offspring of two vampires? Last I checked, that's not supposed to happen. And jumping off a six-story without busting your coconut... ...kind of sways me to the side of "not just a boy." Come on, Fred. His nickname back in Quor-toth was "the Destroyer." Unless you put "Conan" in front of that, it's not a good sign. He's Angel's son. That's all that matters. [SIGHS] ANGEL: Beautiful, isn't it? The way it should be. What, no hug? Just get it over with. What's the rush? I'm not going anywhere. CONNOR: No, you're not. [CHUCKLING] What are you laughing at? I'll tell you later. [GROWLING] [GRUNTING AND GROANING] Dad! [SCREAMS] [CHUCKLING] Thanks. [SCREAMING] [MUSIC PLAYS] Go easy, Mabel. Remember, they're paying to see the green. - Two minutes. - Thanks, sweetie. Bon soir. Lorne? Lorne! Hey, it's Fred. I've been trying to get a hold of you. I'm sorry, hon. I've been booked out the "wa" and past the "zoo." If I get any hotter they'll have to stamp me out. Lorne, I know you're busy, but we really need your help. We had a lead, but it, uh... ...kind of died. Did you talk to your connections? Have they heard anything about Angel? Not a peep. But if I Miracle-Ear anything I'll send up a smoke signal. That's my cue. Take care of yourself... ...and make sure Fluffy's getting enough love. Lorne? GUNN: He have anything? - No. And who's Fluffy? Are you Fluffy? - He called me Fluffy? - He said, "Make sure..." Wait. You don't think he was referring... ...to anything of mine that's fluffy, do you? Because that would just be inappropriate. Like deserting us? No leads, no clients. Pretty soon, no roof over my smooth, delicate head. I could make you a paper hat. It's going to be okay. Angel and Cordy are out there somewhere. No matter what the Powers-That-Screw-You... ...throw at us, we're going to find them. LILAH: You found Angel? Young Gavin's had a breakthrough with the psychics. Brain boys finally earning their keep. So where is he? They haven't pinpointed his exact location yet. But they have ascertained that he's safe and immobilized. Really? Maybe you can lead them in a rousing chant... ...and get them to muster up a little more vague. He's contained and out of play, which suits our purposes just fine. If our purpose is to get caught with our prophesies down. Angel is supposed to be a major player in the Apocalypse. The little pet project the senior partners... ...have been working on since the beginning of time. Three months, and all you've been able to ferret out is nothing. Lilah, Gavin's work with the psychics has uncovered some invaluable intel... ...in a variety of unexpected areas. Care to enlighten us? What I do in my personal time is none of Gavin's business. But everything's my business. I'm not sleeping with him for information. Please don't tell me it's the chiseled jaw. If you have his confidence, we can play it to our advantage. He doesn't know anything. There's nothing to take advantage of. Except you. [ELEVATOR PINGS] Staff meeting in an hour. Don't be late. Gavin. [BEEPING] Solid contact. Definitely metallic. Probably more junk. Could be anything down there. Better have a look, then. WESLEY: Justine. Come on. [GRUNTING] Congratulations. You're the big hero. Your friends will throw you a party. I wonder what the cake's gonna look... Blood? WESLEY: Animal. JUSTINE: Why hurry? He's not going anywhere. WESLEY: A vampire can exist indefinitely without feeding. But the damage to brain function from starvation can be catastrophic. Slowly. All your energy wasted to save that thing. For what? A happy ending? Everything like it was? He hates you. They all do. And they're never going to take you back. - This going to be the yelling thing again? - No, no yelling. - He looks like he's going to yell. - I do not. - He always looks like he is. - I'm not gonna yell. - Where have you been? - Out. We were worried. I'm sorry. I shouldn't run off alone. You'd think I'd know that by now. It's that big, thick melon. Your dad's got one just like it. Angel's always flying off, getting into trouble. - I'm not like him. - You're not as strong yet, but... Like I care what you think? What'd you say? It's been a long night. Why don't you go wash up. I'm fine. I try to be nice, and you see what he does? He keeps pushing. It's like... It's like he wants me to lose it. He's testing you. With Angel gone, you're the alpha male. Damn straight. - Don't let it go to your head. - That's not the direction it's flowing. [PHONE RINGING] Let it ring. What if it's a client? Then the big dog better close the deal. Angel Investigations. Why is it like this? LORNE: That's the age-old, bubby. I'll fire you off a postcard if I noodle an answer. Life should be beautiful and bright. But no matter how hard I try... ...everything I touch turns to ashes. There goes that encouraging hug I was planning. Snap to, buckaroo. The only one turning to ashes is that patricidal pup of yours. Hell, I'd take him on myself if I wasn't just a crappy hallucination. WESLEY: How is he? - How do you think? - He won't shut up. ANGEL: I have to stop him. You want to bitch-slap sourpuss over there for practice? I'm your cheering section. Angel. I have to do it. Shh. You need to rest now. I should've killed you. [JUSTINE CHUCKLES] And me without my camera. He's been down there too long. Pig's blood isn't enough. - He needs more substantial nourishment. - Like what? Screw you. I'm not feeding that thing. No. Your blood's too thin. [MUMBLING] LINWOOD: We've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's get to it. But first, let's talk about Lilah. Everybody had a chance to review her file? Good. Recommendations? If I could just have a few minutes to explain. Your record speaks for itself. Volumes. Your failures at Wolfram and Hart... ...outstrip your successes by an uncomfortable margin. Perhaps you would fare better at a less central office. One of the third-world dimensions maybe. - Sorry. - What was that? I said, I'm sorry. I've made mistakes. But fear was never one of them. Is there something you'd like to share? Why haven't we contained the vampire offspring for study? We're assessing that situation. The same way you're assessing Angel. Why aren't we trying to pinpoint Angel's location? Lilah, this is my corner of the sky. I decide when the sun rises and when it sets. Lack of long-term vision has always been one of your shortcomings. And lack of courage has always been one of yours. You're afraid of Angel and his son. And that's the reason... ...for your daring strategy of "wait and see," isn't it? You're afraid. And fear breeds weakness. I'm hurt. Is that really what you think of me? Yes. And Mr. Suvarta agrees with me. You spoke to a senior partner? He was really very helpful. Had some great hints on office furniture. This is outrageous. Are you telling me that you went over my head? [BEEPING] Just under it, actually. Mr. Suvarta didn't think Linwood's corner of the sky was sunny enough. You're all reporting to me now. Get out. Gavin. Please, remove that. [KNOCKING] - What? - I brought you a snack. I'm not hungry. You're always hungry. - What is it? - Bologna. No tomatoes? No tomatoes. - What do you say? - Thank you. You're welcome. - Is he still mad? - What do you think? Sorry. I can't imagine what you've been through, Connor. Being taken away by Holtz, raised in that place. It must have been horrible. I know you're still hurting. But I promise... ...it's not nearly as much as you're gonna hurt... ...for what you did to your father. [SCREAMING] FRED: You think that's what Angel felt? When you did it to him, did he scream like you? CONNOR: Why are you doing this? - Don't even try. FRED: We got a call from an old friend. Been playing a little Ahab. - He's out there right now on his boat. - With Angel. That's right, Sparky, Daddy's coming home. I guess there's gonna be a spanking. He's been down there all alone for three months, and you knew. Is that what you did to Cordy? Stuff her in a box? How could you do that to us? We took you into our home... ...we cared for you, and all this time... How could you do that? How could you...? GUNN: Fred! [FRED SOBBING] JUSTINE: He'll turn on you. He won't be able to help it. That's what he is. Sooner or later, he will turn on you and all your friends! You just going to leave me? You can continue being a slave, Justine, or you can live your life. Your choice. FRED: I would have done anything for him. Now all I want to do is hurt him. CONNOR: Go ahead. - Hurt me some more, Fred. - Shut up. You think I care? You get used to it. You don't feel anything, do you? There's nothing inside. Why don't you open me up and find out? - How could you do it to your father? - He's not my father. Yes, he is. He got what he deserved. And how soon before we deserved it? [DOOR OPENS] I believe you're looking for this. Angel. - My God. - Is he gonna be all right? WESLEY: In time. Maybe. [ANGEL GROANING] GUNN: He's out of it. FRED: Oh, God. GUNN: It's okay. FRED: Look. GUNN: He's gonna be okay. What do we do? Wesley... Where are you going? I'm done here. Why take so long to tell us about him? You knew what he could do to us. You're human. He wouldn't have hurt you. I thought you were safer not knowing. We were safer? You really don't care anymore, do you? He'll need more blood. I'm fresh out. [ANGEL GROANS] FRED: It's okay. - God, he's freezing. - I'll get some more blankets. [CLATTERING] FRED: Connor. [SCREAMS] Sit... ...down. You're too weak to take me. You really think that? So... ...how was your summer? Mine was fun. Saw fish. Went mad with hunger. Hallucinated a whole bunch. You deserve worse. Because I killed Holtz. Except I didn't. I tried telling you that while you were busy offshore dumping me... ...but I didn't know the whole score. Holtz killed himself. Actually, he had your buddy Justine do it with an ice pick... ...just to make you hate me. Even if... - You still deserved it. - What I deserve is open to debate. But understand, there's a difference between... ...wishing vengeance on someone and taking it. So now the question becomes... ...what do you deserve? Daddy's not finished talking. Wesley told me everything that's been going on. So as far as I'm concerned, what you deserve rests on one answer. Did you do something to Cordelia? No. - He's lying. - No, I'm not. GUNN: Just happened to disappear the same night. I'm telling the truth, okay? I know. I can tell. Done enough lying for me to know the difference. The truth has a better sound to it. Less nasal, you know? Get up. What you did to me was unbelievable, Connor. I got stuck in a hell dimension by my girlfriend... ...for a hundred years, so a few months under the ocean... ...actually gave me perspective. Kind of a M.C. Escher perspective. But I did get time to think. About us. About the world. Nothing in the world is the way it ought to be. It's harsh and cruel. But that's why there's us. Champions. Doesn't matter where we come from... ...what we've done or suffered... ...or even if we make a difference. We live as though the world were as it should be to show it what it can be. You're not a part of that yet. I hope you will be. I love you, Connor. Now, get out of my house. Angel! All that talking, it really takes it out of you. FRED: He needs rest. - I need Cordy. Now. Wherever she is, whatever she's going through. We have to find her. God, I am so bored.
