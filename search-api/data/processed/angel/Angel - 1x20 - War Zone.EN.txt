- Camembert, I believe. What? No, money. I like to smell a little money once in a while. She's not kidding. Hide some and watch her. It's uncanny. There he is. - Mr. Nabbit, hi! - Oh, hi. - Glad you could come. - Thanks. - Thanks for having us. - It's a pleasure. Who are you? I'm Cordelia Chase. We spoke on the phone. Oh, right. So, you must be Angel? Nice to meet you. This is Wesley. - Lovely party. - Isn't it nice? Oh, my God, is that Welling Harding? I have no idea. I don't know most of these people. I don't even talk to the people. They come and I think they have fun. - These are crab. - If it's a bad time.... Miss Chase said that you could only meet at night. It's more convenient. And we'd be less conspicuous during the party. I think it's good. We won't be interrupted. I always said I'd make a billion dollars in the software market... ...and learn to talk to girls. I'm still working on 2, Tell us about your case. My case. It somewhat has to do with blackmail. - Go on. - Familiar with Dungeons and Dragons? I've seen a few. - The role-playing game? - Oh. Game. Right. I used to play a lot in high school. It's cool. You get to be someone else. A wizard, warrior. World is magic. Fighting troglodytes and romancing demon princesses. It's a rush. Did someone find out you were a nerd? No, that's public record. But some of us got really into it. Especially the demon-romance part. And then we heard about this place where the real.... - We joked about getting tail. - You went to Madam Dorion's. Just once. - It's a demon brothel. - Or twice. In Bel Air, I believe. There are many stories about it. - And how many... - Twelve times. - ...people knew about you going? - Just my friends. My security guys already identified the guy with... ...the pictures. Lenny Edwards. I can't find him. We'll see if we can do better. If my stockholders see these pictures-- - They won't. - Don't worry. We're discreet. We'll mingle here for a few hours, so no one suspects. Hey, David. Nice to see you. Nice seeing you again. Yeah. I have no idea. When I moved here I thought it was all glamour... ...but there's an unseen world. More than one. Got him! Bobby! Bobby! No, no, no! - Dog him. - Gunn, come on. Go! - They're back! - Open up! Keep a look out. Let's get him inside. Come on. It's gonna be all right. Get them in. I got you. Just a couple more steps. You're gonna make it. Three more. All right. Here we go. Easy, easy. Yeah. There we go. - Hey, Gunn. - Right here, man. He picked me up like I was a baby. He's dust, Bobby, forget about him. - I'm not a baby. - He needs a doctor. Not anymore. James? How are we fixed for tonight? We took canned food. Wasn't much behind Mel's. We got that. I told them we don't take squatters. Everybody eats. Okay, you guys are lucky. We don't do vampires. Sorry. - I just came to talk. - Sorry. You know Lenny Edwards? - If I did, I won't tell. - Discreet, good. It's essential. Is it discreet for a client to be photographed here... ...and then blackmailed? - What? - Bad for business, I guess. If I can find Lenny Edwards, maybe I can stop it before word gets out. - Who's the girl? - Not sure. The client's David Nabbit. Lina! Talk to Lina. - He's a pretty one. - He's a vampire, Lina. Really? We can make an exception. Just don't do that face thing, and we'll get along great. Look, Ma, no hands! That's not why he's here, Lina. I'm looking for him. Your boss wants you to cooperate. Vampires. Seen my brother? - Gunn, we need to talk. - What up? - What happened to Bobby? - Not that. That's done. - We're dying, Gunn. - Everybody dies. I'm making sure that when we die we stay dead. It shouldn't have happened. You're reckless. - I do what I have to. - You do more than that. Three weeks and no teeth. You had to ring the dinner bell like that? You couldn't go another day without death. - I like this? - You love it. You won't be happy until you're dead. - You're wrong. - Well, I hope so. Because I don't want to lose you too. Not gonna happen, little sister. All right? It's never gonna happen. Chain! You found them? He led me right to it. It's close, right around the corner. - Nice. - Next to the blue jean factory. Now we can do some real damage. Incoming! Moving fast. Rooftop to rooftop. - You were followed? - No. Let's check it out. - What do you want? - Big question. What do I want? Love, family, a place I can call my own, but you know what? - What? - I'll never have any of those things. Unless things go the way I want them to, neither are you. - Where's pictures of David Nabbit? - Don't know him. You only get one lie. I should have told you. Look, pal, you're obviously not from around here. But trust me, you do not want to see my bad side. You show me yours, I'll show you mine. Now I'm from around here. I'm taking over, understand? I will dog you every night until you bring me what I want. Are we clear? Yeah, okay. See you tomorrow. - Vampire is moving in. - Yeah, he ain't gonna stay too long. This should take care of your expenses to date. I appreciate what you did at the party. At the party? What we did at the party? - It was a wonderful party. - We had a good time. It meant a lot. You were paying us to be there. I do that all the time. You guys actually hung with me. I'm in charge of the.... - I think there must be some mistake. - I think Mr. Nabbit can write a check. No mistake. I believe in rewarding good work. This is generous, Mr. Nabbit, but we're not finished yet. It's only money. And it's David. You guys call me David, okay? I like David. It's such a masculine name. It feels good in your mouth. Well, David. You won't be disappointed. We'll earn every cent of your confidence in our firm. - Bye. - Bye. - Feels good in your mouth? - I was flustered. - You're a sneaky son of a bitch. - You have the photos? Yes. And a little something extra. Love that. Whatever he pays you isn't enough. Get him! Come on! Speed up! Alonna! Don't shoot. - What are you playing at? - We're not playing. - You'll get killed. - You first. Let's dust him. For some reason, I think you don't like me too much. Maybe I'm just overreacting. You pretend you're different from them? Yeah. I'll pretend I just saved her life. You put a lot of work into this. Some clever stuff. I'm impressed. I have a few suggestions. - We're not interested. - Yeah. You should be. Who do you think that would've killed? - We're on the same side. - Same side of what? I didn't come here to kill you. It don't matter why you're here, or what you are. If you come here again, don't count on any long goodbyes. Nice work. Nabbit will be greatly relieved to get these back. Oh, my. It's upside down. Not something you'd have framed. - How does it feel? - I can't imagine it's pleasant. I'm talking to Angel. Oh, right. Sorry. It feels-- It feels better. - You should rest. You look-- - Like I've been beaten and stabbed? - Want to see the check again? - I want to find those homeless kids. - They're living together. - How many? Six, seven, maybe more. A couple weren't older than 16. Twenty minutes' ride from billionaires and crab puffs, kids going to war. This isn't something new. They've been pushed to this. I understand their stake-first- ask-questions-later state of mind. It's how they survive. And the idea of a vampire in a white hat... ...probably seems a little give-me-a-breaky. They're gonna get killed. There has to be a nest in the area. - Find out where the kids live. - Consider it done. I'll find the nest before they do. He'll have to be close, probably a 10-block area. It'll have to have sewer access. Can I see that check again? Street trash. That's what they are. Just stupid, human street trash. For 70 years we ruled this neighborhood. It was our neighborhood. Decent people used to live here, working people. And now? You can't even finish one without wanting to puke! And whose fault is it? Theirs? I don't think so. It's our fault. We let this happen. We got lazy. We dropped our guard. Ty, you ever been lured into an ambush before? Of course not. Ty's been around for as long as me. He's survived, like me, because he's smart. But they did this to him... ...and that means that they could do it to any one of us. And why? Because this street trash ain't afraid to go for the heart. And now that's what we're gonna do. No more picking them off one by one. We concentrate on the heart. Take the heart and the rest will fall. I can't hear it. - He could be useful. - Don't listen to her. There's something different about him. He knows things we don't. - He didn't have to do it. - He would've died. - Maybe. - No "maybe." We'd have killed him. - Guy bugs me. - Everyone bugs you. - You bug me the most. - What? I'm trying to keep you alive. Don't trust him. If he's not looking to kill, what's he want? Why would he come to a place like this? Where are they? - I got some food. - I'm not hungry. When did you eat last? Seems like just yesterday. - Poe went shopping. - Alone? Jason had his back. They were fine. - Like last time? - No cops, no chase. Come on, you eat this. They got some other stuff. Hamburger, and some apples and lots of other stuff. We'll have a home-cooked meal. - What? - Get everybody out. - What is it? - Just do it, go! Come on, everybody! Get up! Get up! - Get everybody into the daylight. - Don't they have to be invited? Chain! - Cops? - I don't know. Are they in? Where are they? Go, go, go! I don't see nothing. - There is nothing. - Oh, God. Alonna! Gunn! Gunn! You know? There's nothing like riding in a convertible with the top down... ...to make you see the sun and sand. - Smell that salt air? - That's not salt. I don't think it's air either. But reality's a choice. You see what you see and I'll see what I see. A man in an alley pushing a shopping cart. - I see a tan lifeguard-type with-- - No, over there. These kids have electricity in their building. Maybe they tapped a power line and run it illegally. If I find the tap, it will tell us where they are. Ask this guy if he's seen our young vampire killers. I'll check for any taps. You ask and I'll check for taps? You can imagine him as a buff, young stud... ...while I am stuck with the naked truth. Ask me in. You'll get a lot of people killed. I suck, okay? - You don't want to be here. - They want you to go. I don't need advice from some dude that's dead. You have no idea what it's like down here. Some of you will die. Maybe all of you. People die all the time, some just for talking too much. - We're done. - I can help. Unless you want to die, then you're on your own. - I'm always on my own. - You don't have to be. Why not do this together? You figure it out. Let's go. Hold up. Give me 10 minutes to check it out. If you're not back in 10? Come on down and kill anything that moves. Alonna? Hey, big brother. - What took you so long? - Oh, God. You're not... ...dead. Well.... No. Don't be sad. I'm not. - They killed you. - Do I look dead? I'm stronger, faster and better than ever. Want to see? Right track, but the wrong team. All that rage and hatred we got? We'll keep it... ...except on this side there's no guilt, no grief. Just the hunt and the kill and the fun. How often did we go out during the day? Alonna, I can't do this. You were made for this. All that misery and moping, gone. I wasn't gonna let you get hurt. I protected you. You were my sister. I still am. So why don't you kill me? Why don't you? You can't! You got the guilt. I got the best guilt cure. I can free you. Our family can stay together... ...forever. Trying to open that? - They locked you in? - No, I love meat lockers. You should've tried to call us on your cell phone. You probably forgot you had it. Those things hardly ever work. Besides, it was a lot easier and quicker to just.... Look, I'm the boss here. I make the calls, and I have to go. You're welcome! Remember when we were kids in that shelter on Plummer Street? Second floor was all rotted out. You used to dare kids to cross, and of course you were the best at it... ...because you were the bravest. I wanted to be like you so bad, so I went up, and the floor gave out. I would have broken my neck, but you'd been watching me the whole time. You were standing below, and you caught me. You've always been looking out for me. You don't have to anymore. It's my turn to look out for you now. - How? - Look at you. You're running, hiding, cold and hungry. Is that living? You're the one falling now. Let me catch you. Don't you want to stop falling? I'm gonna fix it. Say goodbye to everything you ever knew. Goodbye. Let's get out of here. What are you waiting on? How did he get out? Yo, don't. We're leaving. - Leaving? - I don't think so. She was so sweet, your sister. So smooth going down. If you know what I mean. You wanted a war? Well, this is it. - Here is the deal: You can go. - What? If you go now, and I never see any of you again... ...you get to live. Are you high? L.A. is mine, you'll want to stay out of it. These kids, my town, off-limits from now on. Who the hell are you? You know who I am, fool? The name's Angelus. I wasn't actually talking to you. Do we have a truce? Or do you want to die? Truce? We can take them. They'll take some of you. You came all this way, you're not gonna kill any vamps? I already did. I asked for a coffee. I know it must be in here someplace. Are you all right? You haven't said a word. I was just thinking about those kids. Yes. That place was pretty awful. And I thought my first apartment was bad. Can you believe people live there? It certainly gives one a sense of perspective, doesn't it? It does. And I think, perspectively speaking... ...I might want to prostitute myself to billionaire David Nabbit. Cordelia. What I mean is, he's a nice guy who wants companionship. I could use some security. - So when I say "prostitute," I mean-- - Prostitute. - For instance. - Do you think you could? I don't know. I could probably learn to love him. Looks aren't everything, or chemistry. Personality, that's important. That makes up for a lot of other.... It's not what's on the outside that.... Yeah. Never mind. I'm fine here. Poor, alone. - What you doing here? - Skulking, professionally. I'm glad for what you did, okay? But I don't need no guardian angel. It's not gonna change things. They'll keep coming, and we'll keep fighting. I know. That's it? You ain't gonna talk at me, be our daddy figure? What can I tell you that you haven't already learned? - I killed her. - You didn't. Near enough. She was the reason, man. How come you do it? How come you're out here? What else are we gonna do?
