you've never seen. We were together 150 years. We shared everything. - It's Holtz. - A vampire hunter. How does he keep finding us? We have a message for your husband. - You remember Caroline. - Hardy screamer. It'll be 200 years before you find Angelus. I want your word you will show no mercy. That's her. Darla. She's back. God doesn't want you, but I still do. - You still have a soul. - Get out. - It's impossible. - Tell me about it, Daddy. - You're carrying a boy. - Great. No one knows how Darla's pregnant. Prophecies mention a Tro-Clon bringing the ruination of mankind. But the scroll is missing. Her water's broken. Get this baby before anybody finds out. I don't care who that man is. Take him out now. Angelus. I've been looking for you. Holtz. My God. You have no god, demon. The Tro-Clon. The prophecy. "Raised up from darkness to bring darkness." It's you. Holtz, whatever brought you here-- You did. You and your demon bitch. For 200 years I slept. For 200 years I dreamt of nothing, but this moment. Which would explain why you look so well-rested. You haven't changed. Actually, I have. While you were sleeping, a lot changed. Really? - Somehow things seem the same to me. - You're wrong. I will have justice. No. I don't think you will. There's no justice for the things I did to you. You didn't do them to me. And you didn't do them alone. Find the female. If he's here, Darla can't be far. Or are you going to tell me that's changed too? - She's gonna pop right here. - The contractions are more frequent. You think? Angel not back with the scrolls? The prophecies would guide us. Women have given birth without them for years. We could really use Vaseline and a catcher's mitt. She's not ready to deliver, but she's moved into the active stage of labor. We can't stay. It's too exposed. - He should have been back. - Something happened. It's up to us to protect his unborn child. Darla, we're taking you out of here. Relax. Try to breathe, like this: I don't... ...breathe! Papa? Papa. Sarah? Sarah. - Sarah. - Mommy won't wake up. Quiet now. - Captain-- - Don't come in here. - Sweet Jesus. - Get out! We have no idea who he is. We ran the surveillance tapes... ...through face and voice recognition. He's not in the system. - A new player. - Or an old one. - Go. - He addressed Angel as Angelus. That suggests personal history. - An old friend. - Not likely. Angelus had no friends. - The status of our surveillance? - We're working on it. You hear from Cmdr. Burke or Dr. Fetvanovich? Units were deployed in Angel's hotel, but that's all we know. Actually, that's all you know. - I, on the other hand, know nothing. - Sir? I could never have been involved... ...in such an ill-conceived and, in the end, botched operation. - Because you were never here. - Correct. - But we were. - You were. I'll expect a full report at Thursday's staff meeting. When I hear about this for the first time, I will be shocked and appalled. Good night. He's gonna crucify us. They don't crucify here. It's too Christian. You're still human. How'd you manage this? So the question becomes: Now that I have you, what's the best way to get her? - Only dark magics could bring you. - She was the trick, not you. - Darla was the unpredictable one. - Was it a demon or something else? What if I just kill you now? Would she somehow sense it? Would that bring her bursting in through those doors? Did something come to you or did you seek it? She might show herself in the service of revenge. - It can be a powerful motivator. - Yes, it can. What'd you have to give up for this second chance? Give up? I had nothing to give up. You saw to that. We took a lot from you, that's true. But we didn't get everything. - We couldn't take your soul. - What do you know of a soul? I know yours will be destroyed... ...if you allow yourself to be used in the service of evil. You're a good man, Holtz. A righteous man. And you're being used for some purpose other than justice. Could it be you really have changed? I don't remember you ever pleading so cravenly before. And I remember you used to work with men. Smack him again. That hurts. Well, you know what they say, birth, painful. Generally for mothers, not bystanders. How long have I been out? Not long. But we seem to be between contractions now. - Yeah, she's been doing that. - Hormones. Come on, then. Darla, do you feel well enough to travel? Good. Doesn't anyone want to sit back here with me? - We're good. - Yeah, it's comfy. I promise I won't throw anyone out of the car. Not while it's moving. It's not that we don't trust you. I mean, we don't trust you. But the fact is, your water broke all over the back seat. What? What are you waiting for? - I presume we have a tire iron. - Yeah, why? We got a flat? And how about a hurling ax or some sort of heavy mallet? Also, a shotgun wouldn't be a terrible thing at this juncture. Are you still concerned about my soul, Angelus, my vampire priest? Excuse me. You've got her? Good. Bring her in. Lilah. This isn't her. - She isn't even a vampire. - No, I'm an attorney. Let me guess. Dead guys all over my floor.... Friends of yours? If I knew you were torturing him, I wouldn't have interrupted. - I'll wait until you're finished. - He'll be dead by then. - Really? - You say you're an attorney. You deal in man's laws. I deal in God's. Ah, right. A good guy. Do you know what he is? Vampire cursed by gypsies who restored his soul... ...destined to atone for centuries of evil, wacky sidekicks. I'd have him killed myself, except my employers have this "policy." - What does she mean, cursed by gypsies? - Long story, Holtz. I'll leave for 20 seconds. That should give you enough time. I'll find people to clean this mess. I've got an early meeting. - I can't allow you to leave. - What do you mean? Sure, you can. You said you worked for the law. No, I didn't. I said I'm a lawyer. I don't care about the law. - Lilah? - What? Duck. Search the grounds! The men you sent to kill Angelus were brave. - Good. - They fought to the last. I get that. Send more, I'll do the same. No one will have him but me. They weren't sent for Angel. This was meant for his girlfriend. - You know of Darla? - Sure. Tell me, these gypsies, did they curse her as well? - Has she too been re-ensouled? - Darla? No. She's free-range evil. If you do catch up with her, we can do some business. My only business with Darla is to send her back to the hell that made her. Yeah, okay. Whatever. Harvey? It's Lilah. I got a job for you. Angel Investigations. Yeah. Full cleaner service. Thanks. - Keep them away from the car! - Don't let them get behind you! Charles! Thanks. What are we looking at? - Holtz? - Yeah. - Who hunted you through-- - The late 1700s. - It wasn't his great-great-grandson? - No, it was him. Maybe he's the one to rain down ruination. The prophecies said the Tro-Clon would be a confluence of events. And an 18th-century vampire hunter appearing... ...in the 21st century seems con-fluey. - He's here for the baby? - He doesn't know about it. He wouldn't have to. That's the tragic beauty of a cosmic convergence. He just plays his own small part. He's looking for Angel and Darla and finds Angel's unborn child... ...who wasn't evil as we feared... ...but was meant to be some messianic figure. But Holtz kills it and his vengeance somehow triggers the end of the world. Or not. It could go either way. Have you thought of a name yet? We must find Darla before Holtz does. - I'll find her faster alone. - Of course. Find a safe place for her to have this baby. We can do that. Hey. Be careful. Angel, the scrolls. You didn't manage to...? No. I'm sure we'll be fine without them. Nyazian. Exquisite. I recognize the Ga-Shundi cross-text. Quite a find. Do you know what this is worth? Hopefully enough to cover my ass. These notes should speed things up. Another translator worked on this. I don't recognize the handwriting. - The idiom indicates an Englishman. - I don't know. I don't remember. It wasn't that worm Forsche in Ancient Symbols and Icons, was it? - It was somebody else. - He's only got that one eye. Don't worry about it. Outside contractors. I highlighted the part they concentrated on. - You highlighted an ancient scroll? - In yellow. Can you translate it? With sacred prophecies, it's more an interpretation than a translation. I'm just looking for the gist. What does it say? Let's see. "Bring forth... ...appear...born." Something about a birth. - What about the birth? - It's unclear. Make it clear. - Well, this should be fun. - No, it shouldn't be fun. What it should be is done by morning. Or I'll have your family killed. You knew. You knew, and you didn't tell me. So I left out one teeny-weeny detail. Didn't seem all that important. Not important? Angelus with a soul? - It doesn't mean anything. - It means everything. See? This is why I didn't mention it. So Angel has a soul. Big whoop. So did Attila the Hun. And a big heart when it came to gift-giving. He's still a vampire. Angel, not Attila. - He's not the same. - Of course he is. His hair's shorter, spikier. He's using product. But it's the same guy. No, he's changed. He's different. I don't know what moral mind games you've been torturing yourself with. But don't let his soul get in the way of what you swore to do. - "Get in the way"? - That's what this is about. Angel has a soul. Now you're wondering if things are murkier, ethically. "Things"... ...have never been clearer. Releasing his soul to suffer for all eternity... ...only makes his destruction more just. More fitting. - Then what's the problem? - You have me hunting the wrong prey. Ah, right. Because an Angel with a soul... ...is a slightly different challenge than an Angel without a soul. - I must know everything. - Right. No, got you. My mistake. You've kept nothing else from me, then? No. Nothing I can think of. You always did love a view. Look at it. Listen to it. Can you smell it? This world, this horrible world. Why would anyone want to bring a baby into it? To make it better maybe? Or to destroy it finally. Why does everyone insist on planning my son's future before he's born? All right then, how's this? It doesn't have a future. - Darla-- - Not with me. Darla. - I can't have this baby. - What? - I can't let it out. - Not sure you have a lot of choice. I know it wants to come out. I can feel it. It's ready. I can't let it. I can't let it because.... Because.... You love it. Completely. I love it completely. I've never loved anything as much as this life inside of me. Well, you've never loved anything, Darla. That's true. Four hundred years, and I never did. Until now. I don't know what to do. Well, you'll do the only thing that you can do. - You'll have it. You'll have it and-- - What? We'll raise it? - Why not? - It's impossible. This whole thing is impossible, but it's happening. What do I have to offer a child, a human child, besides ugly death? - Darla. - You know it's true. I know you love our baby. You bonded with it. You spent nine months nourishing it-- I haven't been nourishing it. I haven't given it a thing. I'm dead. It's been nourishing me. These feelings I'm having aren't mine. They're coming from it. - You don't know that. - Of course I do. We both do. I don't have a soul. It does. Right now, that soul is inside of me, but soon it won't be and then... - Darla. - ...I won't be able to love it. I won't even be able to remember that I loved it, and I want to remember. She wants to have it here? This is a terrible idea. Can't you see I'm getting ready for a grand reopening? Gorsh entrails next to the maraschinos. I can't have a baby here. I just had the booths Simonized. Lorne, should we tell Angel and Darla they're not welcome? Of course not. Caritas will always be a sanctuary. That is, if some people ever finish the work they promised to do. How's the job coming? - We'll finish by your opening tomorrow. - New security system? Routes the new spells to prevent both human and demon violence... ...creating a carnage-free Caritas. But balancing that interspecies flux is trickier than I expected. That's not the only tricky thing here. You hum as you work. - Yeah, so? - So? I just read you, buster. - What are you leaving unconnected? - You questioning my work? - No, I'm firing you. Get out. Out. - I'm union. Gotta pay me for the day. Out. I'll finish this myself. How hard could this be? You won't let me hurt it, will you? You'll protect it, right? From me, I mean? - Yeah. - We've found a place. Is it safe? By the time you get here it'll be safe as houses. Okay, try that. Nope, still not working. Okay. Try it now. No. Hey. Darla. We should get going. I can feel a storm coming. You okay? Another contraction? No, it's something else. - You've got something? - Yes, I believe I do. I must say, whoever you had working on this before was very close. - These notes were helpful. - Great. What does it say? He had trouble here with the tense. Ga-Shundi tenses are tricky buggers. I'm riveted. What does it say about the birth? - Actually, it's funny. It doesn't. - What do you mean? You said it did. - I did. - But it doesn't? - In a way. - I have a gun. The prophecy is not so much a birth announcement as it is an obituary. - Obituary? - Yes. The prophet is telling us there will be no birth. - Are you sure? - Quite sure. "For surely in that time when the sky opens... ...and the heavens weep, there will be no birth. Only death." - Only death? - Just death. Just death. Captain? Captain, we beg you. Let us take you out of this place. - It is the devil's work. - Not the devil. Just a demon. What are we going to do? Whatever we have to. Papa, no, please! Please! No, Papa. Papa, don't! Let me go! No, Papa, no! Don't! Don't! Don't! No! No! No! Okay. I'm convinced I got it that time. Let me see that. Just a few more steps, that's it. Okay. All right. Guys, a chair, a chair. Jeez, what happened? Thanks. You're welcome. You gave us quite a scare. But I guess you're used to that, what with being a scary thing and all. I'm sorry about that. I don't know what got into me. She's in a lot of pain. - How frequent are the contractions? - It's been an hour. She was well into the active stage of labor. - She just stopped having them. - But the pain she's experiencing. - She's experiencing something else. - That's worrying. - Angel. - Darla? - Angel. - Let's get her to my bedroom. Easy, now. We'll get you right in here. It's time to get to work. You found him, then? - Tell him. - Don't forget what we discussed. You'll get your money. I got mouths to feed. Plus a family. Some of them have mouths too. Just tell him what you heard! Lorne, should we tell Angel and Darla they're not welcome? Of course not. Caritas will always be a sanctuary. - She okay? - She's tough as nails. And immortal, so that's in her favor, healthwise. How about the baby? What? What is it? I think you need to prepare yourself for the worst. - No. - The baby's heartbeat is very faint. What do we do? I'm not sure we can do anything. Her body isn't a life-giving vessel. I don't know that it's equipped to bring a baby to term. So, what are you saying? Just let it die? - What about a C-section? - Normally that's what we'd do. But the mystical force that's been protecting the pregnancy-- - Is gonna end up killing it. - That's my fear. This doesn't make any sense. This whole thing is a miracle, right? You don't just get half a miracle, do you? The Powers brought her this far and protected the baby all this time. We don't know that. We don't know that it's the Powers that have been protecting it. What if Darla's carrying the thing in the prophecy? That scourge of mankind that will plunge the world into darkness? What if what's happening to Darla now is the Powers doing something? How? By killing my kid? You always have to be so damned honest? What?! Hey, hey, it worked! I fixed it! Yay, me? How you doing? He finally stopped kicking. Did he? I guess he figured he finally got your attention. You called him "he." That's the first time you've ever done that. He's dying. Isn't he? No. You lied much better when you didn't have a soul. - I can feel the life slipping away. - Then don't let it. You have to fight for this. Please. I don't know how. My boy. My darling boy. I told you I had nothing to offer this kid. Some mother. Can't even offer it life. Maybe I should go in there. Apologize. Best to just stay here. Wait this out. I think both Angel and Darla just need a little time alone. This isn't gonna end well, is it? Okay, everybody's drinking. I'm buying. - Oh, hello. - Hello. We're not open. Come back tomorrow night. It's the grand reopening. Here, here's a flyer. Thanks. Run! - What's going on? - Just run! Run! - What is it? - We're under attack. You have double-protection sanctorium spells. It's a thing with the door, the stairs and the world. - You can be outside and chuck stuff in. - I just said that. - We gotta get out. - Holtz. - Back door? - What? - Move the bed. - How is that possible? I would've mentioned it before, but it wasn't the right time. No, it's the perfect time. - What's behind the bed? - An old loading dock door. My God, what we did to him. I know. - You got an ax, a hammer or anything? - Buddha head. Rhino. That's why this is happening. His family, his children.... What that must have been like for him. - Doesn't seem so funny now, does it? - Darla. We could use some vampire strength here. Cordy, Fred. - Go. I can't. It doesn't matter. - I'm not leaving you. All right, go get my car. It's out front. I got you. Go! - Fred, go with them. - It's okay, they'll come back for us. - You're going to be okay. - No. No, I don't think so. Once he's gone, I won't be okay. I won't be okay at all. I don't know what I'll be. Angel, our baby's gonna die right here in this alley. You died in an alley. Remember? I remember. I wanna say I'm sorry. I wanna say it and mean it, but I can't. Aren't you gonna tell me it's okay? No. No. It's really not, is it? We did so many terrible things together. So much destruction. So much pain. We can't make up for any of it, you know that, don't you? Yeah. This child.... Angel, it's the one good thing we ever did together. The only good thing. You make sure to tell him that. Do it. Now's your chance. Do it. Finish it while you still can. You can't just let him walk away. Not now!
