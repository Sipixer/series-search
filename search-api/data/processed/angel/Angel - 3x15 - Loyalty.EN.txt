Now's your chance. Do it. Finish it while you still can. You can't just let him walk away. Not after what you swore to me. Go out and find others like you, people who have suffered as we have. - What's this? - Take Groo someplace nice. You'd like that. - What about my son? - He has a role to play. I've located commentaries on the prophecies concerning your son. You gotta admire the loyalty. All night here, hitting the books... ...logging serious alone-time delving into the secret mysteries of.... Man, Wesley needs a life. I wonder if he found anything new about Connor. Don't touch that. They're just in a specific order. I'll be lost. What time is it? Time for Wesley to wakey-wakey, isn't that right, Connor? I must have lost track of the time. I meant to go home. Road to hell, right? You find any answers in all these stuffy books? He already knows the answer, he's looking for the question. Have we heard from Cordelia recent--? Wanna see Connor do something cool? I'm teaching him how to die. Don't. Ticktock, Wes. Running out of time. Running out of time. Morning, Wes. You been here all night? You'd think somebody was killing him. All night, the screaming and crying.... - Colic is the worst. - I hold him, I walk him. Nothing works. Have you tried the vacuum? Sometimes the white noise from a motor will put a colicky baby to sleep. You know, I read about that. The problem is, I can't run the vacuum while my older one is sleeping. You could try taping the sound. Leave it playing by the crib. I should have thought of that. Mr. Dad to the rescue. Mrs. Ferguson? Excuse me. "Mr. Dad." Check me out. I'm Mr. Dad. You okay, Wes? Just a bit tired, is all. Probably good you got out of the office. You've been all holed up with all those prophecies and books. I've been working on a particularly difficult translation. Is it about Connor? Anything we have to worry about? - Mr. Angel? - We're up, kiddo. - You coming in? - In case you forget to ask anything. Always better to have an extra pair of ears, right? It's like a.... It's like a soft gurgle. Or a wheeze. It might be a wheeze. I heard it last night when I fed him. Hear it? I hear a normal, healthy heart. You don't understand, I got, like, really good hearing. I mean really good hearing. Well, most first-time parents do. This wheeze or gurgle happened while you were feeding him? - Is that bad? What is it? - In my professional opinion... ...it's called digestion. During your exam, you didn't notice anything abnormal about him? Wes, what kind of question is that? Did you? No, your son is just fine. When will we get the results from the blood test? - In a week. It's just a precaution. - But Connor's healthy? As healthy as a human being can possibly be. - Did you hear that? Thank you. - No problem. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks. Angel? You can let go of the doctor now. Right. Come on, kiddo. Yeah. Thanks. Take care. And they bitch about my cold hands. Yeah. Did you get turned around? You're supposed to be in Exam 3. My mistake. No last name, no bank account. How you ordering stuff off the Web? It's not hard. You hack into the shipping database... ...find somebody who's ordering what you want and substitute your information. Except that would be high-tech robbery. I memorized Cordelia's credit card number. Low-tech robbery. - Some kind of boomerang vamp stake? - No. They're itty-bitty hockey sticks. Check this out. How cute is this? - Seriously. - You got too much time on your hands. - Come on, you think it's adorable. - At least I'm manly enough to deny it. Things have been slow since Cordelia and the Groosalugg went on vacation. I'm actually jonesing for a throw-down with something mean and nasty. Cordelia hasn't called once w;th a vision. Do they have phones there? Maybe they're not near a phone. It's a vacation. They're not gonna waste it all in a dark hotel room... ...together, where food's delivered and there's no reason to go outside-- - Hockey's a great sport. - It's the whitest sport known to man. - But the games are indoors, at night. - Got you. I know it's a little early to think about stuff like this... ...but I can't wait to watch him, you know, grow up. For him to lose his first tooth. Learn how to ride a bike. I wanna help him pick out a tux for his senior prom. I just can't wait to see who he's gonna be. I know that's mushy, but he just makes me so happy. - He shoots, he scores! - Sure, of course, with no defender. - Bring it on. - I think Connor is gonna be a center. - What you got? - Controlling the puck. - Ditching the left wing. - Come on. Taking it all the way to the crease-- Yeah, you know, this isn't regulation size. Excuse me. Is this Angel Investigations? I need your help. Last Monday night, my son Timothy snuck out of the house. He left to go to the pier. He loved the lights on the Ferris wheel. So I went after him. I searched the pier, the arcade.... Nothing. So I sat up all night and waited for him to come home. When did he return home? Right before dawn? Yeah. But his face was.... There was something wrong with his face. And he was so angry. He was calling me names and pounding on the door... ...and screaming at me to let him in. It scared me. I was afraid of my own son. And then he just... ...went up in flames. If you'd let him in, he would have killed you. - At least he'd still be alive. - No. What came to your door wasn't your son. It looked like him, but it wasn't him. Maybe I could have found a way to turn him back. When somebody becomes a vampire, there's no turning back. No matter how much you believe there's some part of him you can save... ...all that's left is an evil thing. You say your son went to the pier that night? - Gunn, why don't you do a little recon. - I could gear up and take care of it. No. If there's a nest, we go as a group. Strictly reconnaissance. Fred and I will check it out. If I could have found that thing myself... ...I would have killed it with my bare hands. It made me afraid of my own little boy. I don't understand any of this. I don't know what to do. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce heads the staff at Angel Investigations. Doles out assignments, specializes in reference and research. This woman, Fred, is the science expert. It's unclear if she's a fighter. Finally, Charles Gunn. Big, strong, could be a formidable opponent... ...though he seems a bit impulsive. We may be able to use that. Good work, Aubrey. Thanks, boss. I don't understand. How can these people work for a vampire? - I once made a pact with a demon. - So you could get to Angelus. So you could kill a vampire. I'm sure they believe their reasons are good, however misguided. Things aren't always black and white, good and evil. What about Angelus? He's evil. Chains would be good now. I knew you were meant for this. We need to get moving. Events are happening quicker than I could've hoped. Thank God. I'm starting to get bored. You know, my barber has the same problem with his scissors. Hence the bad haircut. Love the whole chained, undead look you got going on. Really sets off your fern. Stand down, Justine. It's only Sahjhan. "Only Sahjhan"? See, that's the trouble with you, Holtz. If you'd only done what you'd-- Can we have a little privacy here? - No. - Fine. You owe me a dead vampire. Yes, well, how should I put this? What are you going to do about it? Nothing, that's what you'll do. It's all you can do, or else you wouldn't have brought me here. You've done your part, Sahjhan. Now let me do mine. What is your part? Recruiting a bunch of paramilitary Moonie freaks... ...to play Candid Camera with Angel's buddies? That's crap. Admit it, you're a coward. And I bet Caroline would agree. You remember her, don't you? Your dead wife, mother of your dead kids. How'd they die? Who swore revenge? Any of this ringing a bell? - Get out. - Or what? You can't kill me. But I can trap your dimensional essence in a Resikhian urn. They last a lifetime. That is, if you live forever. This isn't over, Holtz. I know it's dangerous. I don't care. You're a wizard. Because it's the right thing to do. Then because I'm paying you an obscene amount of money. Do it and call me. - Hey, Wes? - What is it? - You're busy, I'll come back. - What can I do for you? Nothing. I just wanted to compliment you. You were really there for that woman, Aubrey, who lost her kid at the pier. Thank you. You've been working so hard, staring at all these books. As a book-starer myself, I know how crazy-making that can be. You should get out of here. Go for a walk. You deserve it. I was thinking maybe you could call Aubrey. Her paperwork says she's single. She probably needs a friend. Fred? We're not here to date. We're here to do a job. Now, why don't you go to the pier and do your job. Is everything all right? Are they taking care of you? No, Mom, this is Lilah. You called Lilah. Do you need anything? Do you need money? No, Mom, I can't come over. I'm in Los Angeles. You know that. Don't cry. Mom, please stop it. I'm gonna have to call you back. - You don't have an appointment. - That's it? No "Wow, how'd he do that?" No screaming in terror? You 21st century types are so jaded. You're Sahjhan, aren't you? I may be jaded, but I do my homework. And there's a girl downstairs with records on everything. - My company rocks. - Yes, I'm familiar with your firm. In this and other dimensions. You're a time shifter. You recruited Holtz in the 18th century... ...put him on ice so he could pop up and stake Angel when he's least expecting it. Considering I have yet to dance on Angel's pile of dust... ...I'm imagining that Holtz isn't working fast enough for you. And you think my firm could expedite the process. More or less. Wolfram & Hart's official policy is to let Angel live until he is useful. I'm sworn to obey that policy. Is there some other way we can help you? I have a plan. But for it to work... ...I require a very rare and valuable ingredient. Getting it will be difficult, if not impossible. - I need the blood of Angel's son. - Got it. Got it? How'd you get it? Swiped it from his doctor's office. I don't know what good it will do you. Boys in the lab said it was completely normal. That's because they're looking for the wrong thing. So I'm looking for anything suspicious... ...like small, dark places where somebody could get grabbed... ...any blacked-out cars or vans, or pale, bumpy people with sharp teeth. Don't worry about seeing any actual vamps. The sun's still up in the sky. Even so, as professionals, shouldn't we be aware--? Ring toss. Want me to be all macho and win you a prize? - Charles. - All right, you can be the macho one. Look at that stuffed bunny. Could you win it for me? - This is so wrong. - You're right. I don't want the bunny. - We're supposed to be working. - No, we're doing some bogus recon. - Still, it's our job. - Actually, this was my job. Wes never said to bring you. Probably sent me so he could chat up my girl. Wesley wouldn't do that. I'm your girl? Wes knows about us, and you didn't let me know? You knew he was interested in you. Now he knows we're seeing each other. I don't think he likes the idea of us dating while we're working together. He said something to you, didn't he? You got my back, right? You told him what we do with our personal lives isn't his business, right? Oh, you bet I.... Didn't. I like you and I want to keep liking you. Then do. Maybe when we're out like this, we should just work. No. Can't do it that way. Maybe I'm greedy, but I want it all. The great girl and the great job. I'm not giving up either without a fight. How about you? Good. Now, how about we go looking for some vampires? It's coming at you. I have to leave for a while. Wes, what's going on? You've been on edge for days. Talk to me. I just want to make sure everything's okay. You mean, with Connor? You didn't mean to give Uncle Wesley such a headache, now, did you? I won't be long. Hey, Wes? Thanks. You're a good friend. Isn't he? We should be getting back. Hang on. I'm getting a tingle. I thought we were gonna keep that out of the workplace. Not that kind of tingle. I don't see anything suspicious. Except that guy trying to break into that building over there. The carousel closed hours ago. - Is that a vampire? - Only one way to find out. - Charles, what are you doing? - My job. I didn't walk the pier all day just to go home and file a report with Wesley. - Let's finish this. - We're not supposed to be doing this. When I say "go," run! - Get out of here. Go! - But-- - They're gonna kill him. - Maybe. - Shouldn't we do some--? - No. That's not why we're here. Behind you! Well, what do you know. Fred, why are you still here? I got your back. Well, actually, I got his back. Thanks. Thirty-four degrees, 12 minutes north... ... 118, 21... ...west. This... ...must be it. You're supposed to be a statue. Guess you are. Sort of. If this doesn't work, I'm gonna kill that wizard. Accept this offering, and open the gates of truth. How dare you call on the loa? I come in supplication, O great one... ...begging for answers to questions only your power can reveal. You have answers, human. You search now only for the question. Is it true? Will Angel really kill his son as it says in the prophecies? That the vampire will devour his child is certain. The dark question you harbor is only, when? No. The dark question I harbor is, how do I stop it? It cannot be stopped. It has to be stopped! There must be a way-- Your insolence is displeasing. You try chatting with a cranky hamburger. You risk your life, human, calling on the loa. Perhaps what you really seek is death. The pain in your heart begs for it. Then do it and be done. Nothing else will stop me. Simple mortal, your pain is just beginning. Betrayal and agony lie in wait. And time is running out. Yet still you ignore the question. All right, then when? When will this happen? The first portent will shake the earth. The second will burn the air. The last will turn the sky to blood. An earthquake? That's the first portent? - We live in California. - Earthquake, fire, blood. Be heedful of the signs, human, and trouble the loa no more. I need a drink. Scotch, 30-year-old, two ice cubes. Certainly. Not on your best day. Bye. Enjoy. Sorry I'm late. Kind of ironic, my being a time shifter and all. - It's on. - It's on? Our plan? The Angel plan? On. I outsourced the labor, buried the costs. We shouldn't have any problem with the firm. Good seeing you. Okay, but let's skip the small talk and get down to business. I time-skipped 133 years for this. Would a little conversation kill you? Right. 'Cause we're on a date? I met you here so we could talk freely. So let's talk freely. Would it impress you if I told you I invented daylight-savings time? Why do you want Angel dead? It's the only thing I couldn't find. Boy, all work and no play. I have my reasons. How about you? Dyed-in-the-wool company gal... ...why risk it all to kill Angel? We have our history. Well, same here. - Are you afraid of him? - No. Then what are you afraid of? You may be insubstantial, but I can still smell the fear. Wow. Where does the time go? So when does this plan go into effect? It's already started. Hi. Sorry to interrupt your staring. You looked into it. Aubrey. I didn't hear you come in. Please. I got your message that everything was taken care of. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. It might have been too late for Timothy... ...but at least those monsters won't be able to take someone else's son. "Monsters." I don't recall mentioning there were more than one. Well, you did say before that there could be a nest. Well, thanks for the check. We'll mail you the receipt. Look, I know it's none of my business, but are you okay? No offense, but you look a little rough around the edges. I'm not sleeping very well. Would you like to go out? Get a cup of coffee or something? You mean, with you? To be perfectly honest with you... ...I could use a friend right now. Ever since my son was.... It gets lonely. You're good. I like the "lonely" thing. - What? - Yeah, "lonely." That was a nice touch. - Moves like a fighter, not a victim. - Yes. You set up my friends. They could have been killed. But they weren't. Your friends are still alive. My little boy isn't. I'm sorry about your son. Is that how Holtz found you? Because of what happened to your son? You're right to protect him. Holtz is one of the good guys. He has every right to hate me. And if he ever comes close to any of my people ever again... ...or tries to touch a hair on my son's head, I'll kill him. And anyone who gets in the way. You might wanna mention that. Good boy. That's my little guy. Your first earthquake. Behind you! This tiny girl.... Outsized, outmatched, outnumbered. And she survived. Why? Because she was willing not to. She was prepared to die for the cause rather than abandon her comrade. We, too, must be willing to die. But more so. Study this carefully. You'll be fighting these two very soon. Perhaps sooner than I expected. They found you out. - I'm sorry. - It's not important. I am annoyed you allowed yourself to be followed. Don't blame her. I would have found you eventually. Maybe we should cut out his tongue. - Send a message to Angelus. - Maybe. Or perhaps you could lie on the floor and gag for a while. I didn't come here to fight. I'm not your enemy. But you do have trouble making the distinction. - You're fighting the wrong man. - Angelus? No. Angel. He's not Angelus anymore. He's a good man. - He's not even a man. - Nevertheless, he has a soul now. Yes, that he might know the pain he's inflicted on his countless victims. A brilliant curse, I admit. Gypsies have a knack for creative vengeance. Where they fail, however, is in the execution of justice. And that I will have. If it's a sacrifice you require, take me. Angel's no more responsible for the crimes of Angelus than I am. Was it your hands that held down my wife as she was violated and murdered? That wrapped around my son's neck and snapped it like kindling? Were yours the hands that clutched at my daughter... ...as she was turned into a creature damned for eternity? Angelus is in his nature. The beast will re-emerge. You've seen it, you know it. And that is why you are here. You're afraid he's going to kill the child. And you're right. Your infiltration was more successful than I had realized. I don't need prophecies to tell me what is plain. So long as the child remains with the demon, it's not safe. Well, I must have misunderstood. I thought it was a blood vendetta. You really want to protect Angel's son. - You don't believe me? - Not sure, really. It could be the low, scary voice that's giving me trouble. It's time to make a decision, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce. My army is strong and will only increase in number. Fight against us, and this war will become a bloodbath. This isn't war. It's revenge. What's wrong with revenge? It's all some of us have left. I can't know what it's been like for any of you. You might, soon enough. When I put my son's body into the ground, I had to open the coffin... ...just to know that he really was in there. You also may discover that a child's coffin, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce... ...it weighs nothing. Barely touched your food. - You feeling okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Look, I've been thinking about yesterday. I'm not really mad at Wes. You were right. I should have stood up to him. I understand his position. He's the boss, we gotta respect that. His job is to keep things tight. That's a lot of pressure. You aren't changing your mind, are you? I mean, about the wanting it all? As long as we're not smooching on the job... ...or being sucked underground by a plant demon... ...I say, why not go for it? What if we can't manage it all? The job, the romance.... Emotions are tricky. They can cloud our judgment, like at the carousel last night. What if it doesn't work? So we're back to that? What if Wesley makes us choose? I've been fighting vamps and demons since I was a kid. That sense of doing good... ...of waking up in the morning and making the world safer, better.... I've always had that. But I never had a Fred before. If we have to, I choose you. I came on too strong, didn't I? No. You came on just right. Look, let's try not to worry too much. Wesley's a good man. He'll do the right thing, He always does, Come on in. I'll get you some food. You're hungry, aren't you? Have a nice walk? How you doing? Really. I've had better days. I know the feeling. I figured it out. How I really knew about Aubrey. All that pain, that rage. Only way she could deal was to join Holtz and take her revenge. You know how I knew that? Because you would have done the same. Scares me. You know? If anything like that happened to Connor, I don't know what I'd.... I love my son. Love can be a terrible thing. I used to think that. I thought love... ...was something that swallowed you whole, ripped you up inside. But what I feel for Connor, even that fear... ...Wes, it's.... It's not terrible. It's beautiful. What's so funny? Life. Life is funny. Listening to stupid people talking to hamburgers is funny. Worrying about things that will never-- It's all so incredibly funny and beautiful. Got you. Wes, get out! It's okay. It's okay, it's all right. Earthquake, fire, blood. I thought we were gonna
