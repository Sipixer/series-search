at the Physics Institute. - Winifred Burkle. FRED: Thank you, professor. - Why are you dressed like that? - Isn't this what you like? Leave them on. - Can we not do this? - We haven't touched each other since... - Since we murdered Professor Seidel. - No, since I did. I'm sorry. I've been here before. Oh, my God. Connor, this is where you were born. You've noticed an increase in paranormal activity. You stepped in some on your way in. That's everything Wolfram and Hart could decipher from Lorne. - The Eye of Fire. WESLEY: Alchemical symbol for fire. ANGEL: And destruction. I hate to be the demon that cried "apocalypse nowish," but... ANGEL: <i>Whatever's coming,</i> that's where we'll find it. The Kimball Building's there. CORDELIA: <i>No one's safe.</i> It's coming, and no one can stop it. Do you really think she's safe with him? CORDELIA: You never had a childhood... ...or family or friends... ...or anything that's real. And if this is the end, I want you to have something that is. [BANGING] [ANGEL GRUNTING] Habeas Corpses RADIO ANNOUNCER: A series of earthquakes... ... and what authorities are calling meteor showers... ... have ravaged the Southland tonight, igniting fires and explosions... ... throughout the L.A. Basin. As fire and rescue teams assess the ongoing threat, government officials... ... are asking people to stay in their homes and off the streets. Many... [PHONE RINGS] This is Fred. No, that's right. Yes, ma'am. Angel Invest... I know. It is scary, but... But if she's only an hour late... I'm just saying, maybe it's a bit early to panic. A little fire falling from the sky doesn't necessarily mean the end of... Oh, my God. I thought you were dead. I got back here, and it was empty, and I panicked... ...and the radio and the fires. - I know, baby. I know. Me too. It was the end of the world, and all I wanted was you. But you're safe now. All of you. Yes. All safe. What about Angel? Where's Angel? We got separated. I'm sure he'll be here soon. What about you? You okay? I'm fine. I just needed some air. I didn't know I'd be gone so long. Looks like there's other things I didn't know. Time for updates later. We need to regroup. Think about getting back out there and mixing it up with that demon-y thing. That's not what Angel would do. Thanks for your opinion, and I don't remember asking. What demon-y thing? Oh, I believe he was referring to the big, bad... ...possibly invincible demon-y thing that nearly killed us all... ...before he ringmastered tonight's Cirque du Flamb<i>e</i>. Is that the "pain, suffering and despair" thing you saw when you read Cordelia? Afraid so, peanut. And if there was ever truth in advertising... Charles, if he's really that big and bad, maybe we should wait for Angel. If he couldn't stop him... So we wait because we don't know what Angel would do? Would I do what? Angel. You're hurt. I'll be... Let's talk about it in the morning. What about Cordelia and Connor? Has anyone checked in on them? - Angel? - They're fine. You saw them? Man looks like he was hit by a tank. I don't remember seeing him that down after a fight. Can't really blame him. No one likes to lose, whatever the circumstance. Morning. Did the world end? Not exactly. So that's a good thing. Don't do that. - Do what? - That. The look. The happy puppy look. Makes it harder. Makes what harder? You're very special, Connor. Last night will always be special. It's something we both needed. But it happened because of unusual circumstances. - Understand what I'm saying? - Yeah, that it was special. That it can't happen again. But... Why? You're Angel's son. It rained fire last night. Never a good sign. And a giant demon-y beast crawled out from the earth where you were born. - You think it's my fault. - No. - I told you last night I didn't. I said... - You said a lot of things last night. You said that it didn't matter anymore. - That we were real. - And I meant them. Yeah, then. Today, it's all my fault. - You know, the fire, demon, all of it. - Don't be... - Look, all I said was... - That I can't be with you. Connor... [DOOR SLAMS] [KNOCKING] - Okay. I was just checking. - I'm alive. Not by much, from the looks of it. I left you a couple hundred messages last night. Don't feel obligated to return any. - And you're all right? - I'm fine. I slept at Wolfram and Hart. FYI, safest place to be in case of an apocalypse. You, on the other hand... I bet I could make you feel better. LILAH: You know, it's weird. Rain of fire. Whole city burning. Why do I feel a chill? I can't do this anymore. Yeah, yeah. I heard it a million times, cowboy. We both know how this song ends. You, me, broken furniture. It's over, Lilah. You're serious. After what I saw last night... ...I believe a day of reckoning has arrived. And you just reckon you'll toss in with the good guys? I'm choosing a side. And the girl of your dreams just happens to be on it. Hmm. What are the odds? This isn't about Fred, or anyone else for that matter. It's about right and wrong. And you have such a clear grip on those concepts. I've made mistakes. You're making a big one now. I could wear the glasses again. Don't embarrass yourself. There is a line, Lilah. Black and white. Good and evil. Funny thing about black and white. You mix it together, and you get gray. And it doesn't matter how much white you try and put back in... ...you're never gonna get anything but gray. And I don't see your Texas gal pal wearing that color. Come to think of it, she prefers black. FRED: I don't get it. I've run its stats through every database... ...cross-checked against prophesies, and still come up with squat. How can a creature with that much firepower not leave a parchment trail? There is a trail. Problem is, the trail guide was drawn by a crackhead. Hey, Cordelia. - You guys survived the night all right? - Yeah. You know, it was... Scary, nasty and nervous-making? The sky should not be made of fire. Angel around? Hibernating in his cave. You have a minute? I was hoping we could... ...talk. About... Well, about Connor. - I already know. - You do? Really? Well, then, you're handling it a lot better than me. Can we not do this right now? Listen up, daddy dearest. The fact that this hell-beast you're looking for crawled up... ...out of the ground in the exact spot where your son was born... ...seems what we should be talking about now. The same spot? Really? You said you already knew. Of course I knew. Doesn't mean anything. It could be a... - Coincidence. - Strange things happen. Like a vampire giving birth? Oh, wait. That happened in the exact same spot too. What are you...? You think Connor's connected to this thing. Me? God, no. He's a sweetie pie. Then why are you telling me? Because your son stormed out this morning, and he really does believe it. Listen, Frank, I don't care if you have to LoJack the damn thing. Sugar? Find that beast, or I swear to God, I will... - "Boil you alive." - Shut up. Boil you alive. How hard can it be to find a giant, horned thing? Or a decent cup of coffee? Why are you still here? Intel confirms the creature triggered the pyrotechnics last night. They're just not sure why he did it. I'll tell you why. Because it can. It's the 800-pound gorilla. It can do whatever the hell it wants. I get that. Other than charbroiling everything in sight, I don't think it has an agenda... ...and that makes our job tricky. What job? The senior partners want us to try and cut a deal with it. - You can't be serious. - It wants the same things we do: An apocalypse, end of the world, yadda, yadda, yadda... Partners feel it might speed things along, save a few bucks. - But what if it's not interested? - They'll change its mind. I'm not losing this one. I have questions. Connor. The last few hours haven't brought enough surprises. You really threw us for a loop here, kiddo. Sneaking in the building. You really are like your old man, aren't you? It's time to find out. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I want to know why I'm here. What I am. A timeless question. And one we're more than happy to help answer. We have an in-house lab. We'll do a few easy workups. Psychological, physiological, neurological... ...and focus on exactly who or what you are. Then we'll slice you open and start poking around. - I got a different idea. - I'm open to any suggestions. That demon you're seeking, I think I'm connected to it. - I want to find out how. - Sure. No problem. Gavin, why don't you get our young friend a copy of your report? Then we'll sit down and have a nice, nonviolent conversation. [RUMBLING] It's here. It's here. The Beast. It's probably just an aftershock. They sometimes make the power go out. Try a walkie. This is Gavin Park to the front desk, over. - Come in, front desk. MAN: <i>This is the front desk, Mr. Park.</i> We're kind of... Oh, no. Oh, my God! Tell him to stop whining and report. Oh, God, somebody, please! Oh, God! I told you. LILAH: Go downstairs and check it out. Gavin, ask yourself this question: What are you more afraid of, a giant, murderous demon... ...or me? Be right back. You have any idea what this thing wants? Everybody dead. [SCREAMING AND CRASHING] [VOICES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Let me down the stairway. Let me out. Let me out. LILAH: What exactly is this thing? CONNOR: I don't know. I think it's been following me. - And you're just gonna kill it? - Gonna try. And we're heading towards it right now. Best of luck. MAN: Let's go. Stay to the right. Keep moving. Keep moving. Try not to worry. [YELLING AND SCREAMING] Hi. Uh... Hi. Aw. [GUNSHOTS] I can help you. Anything you need. Connor. LILAH: I don't understand. Stay with me, Lilah. - Why are you here? - I have a man on the inside. What's that? - That's the fat lady singing. - Lilah! The building automatically shuts down under full-scale attack. When you say "shuts down"...? Windows, doors, air vents. Nobody gets in or out. WESLEY: Stay with me. There must be a way out for someone like you. Think. - A back door, something. - Around the corner. Supply closet. What are you stopping for? You gotta be kidding me. - Will it kill him? - No. It might distract him for a moment. LILAH: Gavin. Poor bastard. - Lilah? - It's in here. - Come on. Where is it? - You sure this is the right closet? Yeah. Third floor in lobby. Okay, here it is. [GRUNTING] [BANGING] [GROANING] Now what? Now you disappear. You get patched up and leave town. Turn tail and run? It won't quit till everyone at Wolfram and Hart is dead. Go underground. Change your name. - Don't make its job easy. - Wesley. - Connor's trapped up inside. - What? I don't know if he's alive. It's the third-floor conference room. Not that there's a way back in. I just thought you should know. Can you not do that? Oh, sorry. It helps me think. I didn't mean to snap. CORDELIA: I'm ready to crackle, pop myself. Last 24 haven't exactly been normal. We're all tired. Wonder why. Just meditating on the problem. Yeah, asking the inner Lorne for a little backup. We're assuming Connor and the devily guy have this alley in common. But isn't this alley right behind Caritas? Or at least what's left of it? Yeah, that whole block is a big fat interdimensional happening hot spot. Except this thing didn't emerge from a portal so much as a pothole. [DOOR OPENS] - Oh, good. More bad news. - Can you just try to get along? - He was your friend. - Heavy on the "was." You know where it is. - The Beast. - Inside Wolfram and Hart. - And so is... - That answers questions. They're probably having a big sit-down, breaking bread. It's killing everything that moves in there. I've heard worse news. Your son is trapped inside. - What? - Oh, my God, Connor? Why would he be there? I don't understand. Lots of things I don't understand. - We're going in after him. - Won't be easy. Building's locked tight. There's no way out. But I bet there's a way in. I mean, I know you run your own shop... ...but inside data on Wolfram and Hart, pretty amazing. Yes. Well, part of the job. LORNE: Flashlight? - Yes, please. He's gonna be fine, you know. Connor's a champion, like you. He's special. Right. Like me. Special. - Somebody should stay here. - Oh, me, me, me, me. Sergeant Stay-At-Home volunteering for duty, sir. - Gunn, let's go. GUNN: Angel, assuming we can... ...get inside the evil empire, same big beastie's in there... ...who spanked our asses six ways to Sunday. What's different? We're not going for the monster, we're going for Connor. So the Big Bad understands that? I don't know the answers, don't know most of the questions... ...but what I do know is I have to go into Wolfram and Hart and find my son. Now, as far as us versus the Big Bad is concerned... ...there's only one smart way to play it. We see it, we run like hell. Works for me. Excuse me. Stay here with Lorne. - Uh-uh. Connor's in danger, and l... - Cordelia... ...I don't want you there. It's too dangerous. Way too dangerous. I can't risk it. Fred, get a move on. Happy hunting. We'll stay here and keep the home fires burning. Bake some nice healing muffins. This is it. I believe there's a door about 30 meters up. GUNN: You believe or you know? Every time you believe, somebody gets drilled or falls into a portal. - Charles. - I'm just saying... Well, I'm doing. Shut up. I don't give a rat's ass about what's going on between you. Put it away. We're here for Connor. I don't see how we're getting up there. Showoff. Oh, my God. I know they all worked for an evil company, but this is... [GASPS] What? Heard something. Power's down. We'll have to take the stairs. GUNN: Just so I'm clear on the plan. - Third floor. Get Connor, get out. [GASPS] - Sorry. Feeling a little goosey. - For good reason. Be quick, be quiet. As far as we know, that thing's still around. GUNN: I don't get it. Wolfram and Hart is evil, the Big Bad is evil. Why go all <i>Terminator</i> on your own team? Maybe all it wants is to eliminate the competition. Doesn't give us much to look forward to, does it? Wasn't Gavin...? Over here. - He's not in here. - Let's be certain. No, she's right. He's not. That's good. Means he's still alive. Or that Sherlock got his facts wrong again. No. I can smell him. Connor was here. We should split up. You three take one stairwell. Sweep each floor. We'll meet up top. Connor. Jesus! Thank God you're alive. - How'd you know where to find me? - It's a long story. - We've gotta get out. - I have to kill that thing. - This is my fault. - We can't kill it. And, no, it's not. We've thrown everything we can at it. It's not enough. We need to go. Gavin, how did...? - He looks dead. - He is dead. Technically, he's undead. He's a zombie. What's a zombie? It's an undead thing. - Like you? - No. Zombies are slow-moving, dimwitted and crave human flesh. - Like you. - No. It's different, trust me. Come on. CONNOR: Why are they doing this? Why are they zombies? ANGEL: I don't know. But we need to find the others. That's odd. - What is? - Shouldn't Angel be swooping in now? Charles! What's going on?! [MOANING] - What the hell was that? - Zombies. Yeah, thanks for the newsflash, Captain Obvious. It's locked. - Charles, you're bleeding. - Zombie broad tried to snack on me. She bit you? Worried I'll turn into a mindless meat bag? - I don't think that's how it works here. - Lf it is, don't let me be one for long. - You'll do the same for me? - Oh, yeah. [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] Damn it. Got it! FRED: Come on! Gunn. Get her out of here! - Charles! - Go! You kill a zombie by stopping its brain activity. Cut off its head, smash in its skull. Luckily, they're slow and stupid, so we have a chance of beating them. [MOANING] Unless, of course, there's hundreds of them. - We've got to go back for Charles. - No. I need to get you to safety. - Now what? - We wait. Then we fight. - Why are they doing this? - I don't know. Perhaps it's some building lock-down protocol or some security voodoo. You think it's something the Beast can do? Reanimate the dead? Anything is possible. All I know is, they want us dead. - Fred? - Charles! Zombies, my ass. - Connor. - We got what we came for. Let's go. - Wes? - I know two exits: Third floor and lobby. - Too far. - We can make it. Not all of us. Too many dead men walking. All right, look, there is one other way. The white room. An interdimensional space at Wolfram and Hart. - Sounds kind of portal-y. ANGEL: More like a gateway. There's a little girl there. Or something old and evil that pretends she's a girl. - You've seen her? - Once when I was trying to find you. She might be able to help us. So fight seven floors of evil lawyer zombies or sweet-talk a nasty little girl. - You know where my heart's at. - Yeah. I gotta disagree. I say the white room. How do we get there? Gonna need your help. Do what you can. ANGEL: Fred? - Working on it! Come on, Fred, think. Bypass switch for a shutdown command. ANGEL: Come on, Fred! Angel! ANGEL: Guys, let's go! - Remember the code? - Photographic memory. - What? - Maybe you forgot. I didn't forget. Let me try again. GUNN: That's Gavin. I know that guy. Hold up. Hate seeing someone I know like that. Even someone I know I hate. No time like the present, Angel. Here's hoping she's in a good mood. FRED: Oh, no. - It was waiting for us all along. - No, I don't think so. It wanted this. The girl. Whatever she is, it came for her. Is there a way out of here? The answer is among you. [CHANTING] Home. She sent us. Oh. Dad? You're safe. FRED: Does it still hurt? GUNN: It's okay. Well, hail the conquering heroes. And how the hell did you just do that? That was awful, what it did to that little girl. Oh, it killed a girl? Not really a girl. Something ancient and evil dressed like a girl. What's it say about the Big Bad Wolf if he can stride right in... ...and suck the energy out of evil Red Riding Hood? I don't know. Other than it'll take a force far smarter and stronger than us to defeat it. Oh, like there's a lot of that just lying around. Hey. I was... ...really worried. I bet. The folks out there are feeling pretty discouraged. Yep. I'm just glad that everyone's safe and together again. - Me too. - Yeah. Now, take your new boyfriend... ...and get the hell out of here. Oh, God.
