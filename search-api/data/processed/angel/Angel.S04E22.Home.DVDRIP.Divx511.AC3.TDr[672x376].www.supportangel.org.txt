- This child, it's the one good thing... ...we ever did together. LILAH: <i>Daniel Holtz.</i> LORNE: <i>He's taken the baby away.</i> MAN: <i>Wolfram and Hart.</i> - Our firm has always been here. We go on, no matter what. That didn't suck. CONNOR: We have to destroy her. I'm sorry, Lilah. - Connor... - Hi, Dad. You never had a childhood or a family or anything that's real. I want you to have something that is. JASMINE: <i>Cordelia.</i> - Where is she? She's exactly where I need her to be. I know she's a lie, Jasmine. My whole life's been built on them. I guess I thought this one was better than the others. - You still love me? - Yes. Jasmine's dead. Connor killed her. He's just given up. I think he's gonna do something. He might... End world peace? You already took care of that. Congratulations. - Lilah. - Angel. What's the matter, Ace? Didn't think you were the only one... ...that ever got to come back from Hell, did you? [CLEARS THROAT] Speaking of which, could I possibly get some ice water? - What are you doing here? WESLEY: She's not here. It's not her. It can't be. A signed dollar in your wallet says different. WESLEY: It's a lie. - Lah. It's a Li-lah. You're the one with the preternatural senses. You tell him. It's true, Wes. It's her. But how? She was dead. She's still dead. Vampire? Please. Angelus drank from me, it's true. But like with most men, it was a one-way street. I was dead already. Besides, my Wesley made sure I'd be spared, just in case. It's okay, lover. I never felt a thing. I'm sure that's true. GUNN: I don't get this. If she ain't alive, or a vampire, what the hell is she? I'm just the messenger, that's all. They'll be sending me back to Hell once I'm finished. - Who's they? ANGEL: Wolfram and Hart. The contract she signed with them extends beyond her death. Standard perpetuity clause, I'm afraid. Always read the fine print. - What's your game, Lilah? - No game. In fact, game over. Guess what? You win. Which is why I'm here. I have been authorized to make you kids an offer. You can't think there's anything we'd want from you. I don't think you'll want it, but you'll take it. Because this... ...is the offer of a lifetime. Just not, you know, mine. HOME Do you want to run that by us one more time? What was unclear? I think the part where you offered us Wolfram and Hart. Just the L.A. Branch. Just the L.A. Branch. Hi. From another dimension. What the hell does that mean? Means we give. You win. We're moving out. The senior partners are ceding this territory to you. And to prove it, they want to give you controlling interest in our L.A. Office. You get the building, assets, personnel, letterhead, paper clips, all of it. It's yours to do with as you see fit. But there is no Los Angeles office of Wolfram and Hart. The Beast destroyed it. Oh, it's back, re-staffed and zombie-free. We're bigger, better and shinier than ever. And we want to give it to you. You want to give us your evil law firm? - We ain't lawyers. - Or evil. - Currently. - What we're offering you... ...is a turnkey, state-of-the-art, multitasking operation. What you do with it, well, that's up to you. - Why? - I thought that was obvious. You earned it. Think of it as a reward. - A reward for what? - Ending world peace. - That's not what happened. - No? - Jasmine was creating a slave state. LILAH: Right. Where the slaves are full of giggly joy and love. Oh, what a nightmare. - She was eating people. - They knew what they were getting into. Her stomach?! World peace comes at a price. Jasmine understood that. She consumed, what, a couple of dozen souls a day? Now, weigh that against ending the suffering of millions. - But you fixed that. - No, we didn't. I mean, we fixed it, but not in the way that you're trying to make it sound. Jeez, it's not like it was a criticism. Anyway, I'm dead and running late. Think about our proposal. If anyone's interested and wants the tour... ...there'll be a limo waiting outside just before dawn. And, hey... ...good job. We ended a nefarious global domination scheme, not world peace. Right? [SIREN WAILING] [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Hey. - You okay? - I lost something. Something I need. I can't find it. I can't find it! - I know. It's okay. - You can help me look. I don't think I can. I think it's gone. Hey! You don't want to do that. What you're feeling right now won't last. Let's just put this away, okay? That's right. Listen... ...you're going to go home, and you're not going to do anything stupid, okay? Home? Yeah. You got one, don't you? Yeah, yeah, I got one. Look. That's Sarah and that's Jill. That's my home right there. That's your family. That's your family, and you were just gonna leave them like that? How were they gonna feel if you didn't come back? - I don't know. - You don't know? You have to know that! I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. CONNOR: You were gonna leave them, huh? Think about this! Think about this! Huh? Huh? WESLEY: Angel's battle with Jasmine took place here. She was moving east, probably towards Cordelia. If we find Connor, I suspect we'll find her as well. Kid needs a leash, if you ask me. If we work outward in an ever-expanding perimeter... Ever-expanding perimeter? That won't take weeks. If you have another idea, I'm ready to hear it. Can't help thinking it might cut down on the workload if we got a little help. Got a few extra employees. Or a turnkey, state-of-the-art, multitasking operation. You can't possibly think that's an option. I know it is, I was standing there when the dead lady offered it to us. Come on, Wes. How long you gonna be satisfied... ...sticking pins in maps and blowing dust off your books? Sorry. I shouldn't have said it like that. No, no. - They are rather dusty. - That's not what I meant. Couldn't have been easy for you, seeing Lilah again like that. Oh. Yes. That was awkward, wasn't it? You decapitate a loved one, you don't expect them to come visiting. Loved one? Figure of speech. ANGEL: You're back. - Anything? LORNE: Oh, plenty. Just not any on Connor or Cordelia. I'm not saying we ended world peace, kids, but, it's a mess out there. And considering the banner year we've had... ...that's up against some pretty stiff competition. - What do you got? - Not much more than you left me with. If Connor doesn't want to be found... We'll find him. We won't stop until we find them both. We'll do whatever it takes. Okay, well, don't you think maybe we should consider... Consider what, Gunn? What should we consider? Working outward in an ever-expanding perimeter. You want to get into that limo when it gets here... ...that's up to you. It's not a decision I can make for you. For any of you. But know this. Before the ride's even over... ...before you even cross through their doors, you'll be corrupted. - Where are you heading to? - I'm gonna find my son. See if I can get lucky, pick up his trail. - I can't believe he thought you meant... - I'm going to bed. Yes, I should be heading home myself. It's late. Well... ...night, all. - Night. Good night. I don't know how long it's been here. Since before I arrived. I thought I'd be the only one. And I thought for sure I wouldn't be. Although I wasn't expecting it to be you. I just figured... ...well, if they are up to something... We should know what it is. I get that. - Well, we three. - Looks like. What are the odds the humans would be the most corruptible? Maybe we should just go back inside. - What if Angel's right? - Yeah, and what if he's not? All we're gonna do is take the tour. WESLEY: Hmm. Go into this with our eyes open and our wits about us. - There shouldn't be any... ANGEL: Surprises? What the hell. [LOUD MUSIC PLAYS] LORNE: An evil limo? I get that. Does that mean you don't restock the cherries? Hi. - Mr. Angel, good morning. MAN 1: Morning, Mr. Angel. Good morning, Mr. Angel. Good morning, Mr. Angel. - There's no way this is gonna go well. - Good morning, Mr. Angel. MAN 2: Good morning, Mr. Angel. WOMAN 1: Mr. Angel, welcome. MAN 4: Mr. Angel, greetings. MAN 5: Good morning. Well, you've all made it. What a shock. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so best we get started. - Let me introduce you to your guides. - Guides? Separate guides? Of course. There are five of you, all with specific interests... ...unique areas of expertise. It seemed the most efficient way of doing this. Prioritize and personalize. - Divide and conquer, you mean. - Oh, you're so cynical. See? This is gonna work out great. We don't split up. We came here together. We're gonna take the tour together. - Right, guys? - Do I get her? Look, if we'd wanted to harm you, we'd have blown up the limo, right? If you'd prefer to be armed during your stay here, we'd have no objections. Just because we tried to kill... ...or corrupt each and every one of you at one time or another... ...doesn't mean we can't be trusted. She's right. We've made deals with them before. They are honorable, in their way. I doubt we'll be in any danger. She was right about the limo. Do I get her? I think we'll be okay. Lorne, Preston will show you around our entertainment division. Hi. Big fan. Huge. Love your work. I had this prepared. Confidential list. Peepers only. Thought you might want to take a gander at our roster. Just a rundown of some of the talent we represent here. I don't think you have to tell me what you represent here, young man. I know. Evil. Pure evil and the... Which is also apparently everyone I've always wanted to meet. Follow me. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, Rutherford Sirk. I think you'll find you two have a lot in common. It's a pleasure. Shall we? Charles Gunn... ...Lacey Shepherd. I think you'll find you two have nothing in common. - This way, Chuck. - Are you gonna try to corrupt me? - Wouldn't dream of it. - We'll have to work on that. Knox, Fred Burkle. Hi. Knox is the star of our science division. - Nice to meet you. KNOX: You too. Well, this should be... ...fun. Yeah. Well... ...what do you know. - Yep. Just you and me, boss. Come on, Charlie. Let me show you around the Chocolate Factory. GUNN: Pretty slick. - What is? - You know... ...giving each of us our own little tour. - It's a good way to isolate Angel. - Is that what we're doing? Be a big coup, bringing Angel over to the dark side. Vampire with a soul. Champion. It's gonna look good on anyone's letterhead. LACEY: Why do you assume Angel is our priority? GUNN: You telling me he isn't? LACEY: A priority. Though you each possess gifts we feel would be useful. Well, I see what the others got. Fred's big brain. Wes' training. Lorne's mind-reading thing. Guess I just don't know what you guys expect me to do around... ...here. Though I think maybe I'm starting to figure it out. Bet I'd look real smart in one of them blazers. Oh, I'm sure you would. But we have much grander plans for you, Mr. Gunn. You do? Grander? Let's go upstairs. FRED: So are you a lawyer? You don't look like a lawyer. No, I'm strictly R & D. Although, occasionally some D & D. D & D. Dungeons and... We actually have a dungeon. I can show it to you later if... I manage the science division. Seem young to be a head of a whole science division. Oh, I'm not the head, I just manage it for the department head... ...which I guess, you know, would be you. - Wow. - I know. Everything modern technology has to offer, at your fingertips. Everything state-of-the-art, cutting edge. That's one of my creations. You might want to get out of the lab more. Personal organizers have been around for a while. I mean, not that it's not a nice PalmPilot. I'll bet your buddy Matthew Partney... ...at 6200 Crestwood Boulevard in Lubbock, Texas would agree. Hey, how'd you know about Matt? Hacks into any electronic device within a hundred yards. I patched into your cell phone's address book. You're like the MacGyver of Wolfram and Hart. You're not wrong. I can make practically anything out of... ...a fully equipped, multi-million-dollar lab. Our ancient prophecies wing. - Looks as if your wing's been clipped. - Appearances can be deceiving. It's actually the most comprehensive collection... ...of prophesy archives to be found anywhere. Choose something to read. Go on, anything at all. Something rare. All right. The <i>Devandire Sibylline Codex</i>. Translated or Sanskrit? - Surprise me. - I'm sure I will. Devandire Codex, Sanskrit. The template you're holding provides access... ...to anything stored in the firm's locked archives... ...relating to prophesies, omens, revelations and so on. Impressive. And does the Watchers Council know... ...you stole the only known copy of the Codex when you left? There is no Council. Not anymore, no. So you opted to, what... ...play for the other side? Cross the line? These are complicated times. Lines become blurry. How did you know? Something about Watchers and... ...libraries. LILAH: Money, clothes, women. - Did I mention we have a juice bar? ANGEL: This is what you came back for? To play <i>Let's Make an Evil Deal</i>? LILAH: Show him what's behind door number one, Bob. I know it's not much, but... ...the Taj Mahal was a bit of a commute. ANGEL: What, am I supposed to swoon? It's an office. With your own private elevator. Care to take it for a spin? What's it gonna do? Drop me in a vat of holy water? I was pushing for that, but they went with the motor pool. Figured you'd like to stay mobile, with all that rushing... ...to save the day you're so fond of. - Thanks, but I have a car. - Now you have 12. - What am I gonna do with 12 cars? Anything you want. That's the point. Or haven't you been listening? I have. And I'm done now. Wait. I forgot to show you the best part. You're gonna love this. [GASPS] - I'm not bursting into flames. - Nope. Necro-tempered glass. The whole building's fitted with it. Helps keep those uplifting, wholesome rays from charbroiling the boss. And 30 percent more energy efficient. It feels even better when you're naked. I could turn around. - Close it. - Promise I won't peek. - Well, maybe just a skosh. - Close it, Lilah. Goodbye, Mr. Sunshine, hello, Gloomy Avenger. Make that goodbye. I'm not taking the job. It's not a job, it's an opportunity. Oh, an opportunity to be part of the problem. If that's what you choose. - Really don't. - Again, your choice. Think of what you could do with the resources of Wolfram and Hart. The difference that would make. Nothing in this world is the way it ought to be. It's harsh and it's cruel. That's why there's you, Angel. You live as if the world were as it should be. With all this, you can make it that way. People don't need an unyielding champion. They need a man who knows the value of compromise... ...and how to beat the system from inside the belly of the beast. The beast's belly? Doesn't that usually mean you've been eaten? Maybe. While you've been namby-pamby-ing around for the past 90 seconds... ...six innocent people have died. Don't worry... ...there's always six thousand more just around the corner. Or up the coast. - Sunnydale. - That nifty bauble comes with the file. Apparently it's crucial for some kind of final battle. Guess they're in short supply up Sunnydale way. A bit gauche for my taste. But, hey, not a slayer. Buffy can handle herself. But isn't it more fun when you handle her? Keep the intel. Not interested. Not in this case. So how about open homicide? Missing persons? I knew there had to be a reason you took the tour. Dead, not stupid. - What do you know? - About where Cordelia and your son are? Not a thing. But you could find out in about 10 seconds. All you gotta do is pick up the phone, boss. I'm sorry what happened to you, Lilah. I really am. Me and my friends will be leaving now. [PHONE RINGS] Yes? Of course. The senior partners would like you... ...to test all the amenities before you make your decision. Bomb units have been called to the scene where shoppers... Cool. Is that high-def? ... are being held hostage at this hour. Police are trying to identify the suspect from these security camera pictures. So far, no motive is known for the siege... - <i>... and the suspect has refused to...</i> - Wow. Really does have your eyes, doesn't he? - As tense drama unfolds. Watch the head. It comes off kind of easy. - You set this whole thing up. - I've been busy with the "being dead." The senior partners, whoever. Get them on the phone and make it stop now. Love to, but we didn't have anything to do with it. - But you know who did. - Yeah, I'm looking at him. You're the one who raised him, or didn't. Can't imagine how the kid turned out postal. You don't know a thing about Connor. Let's keep it that way. One-time offer only, Angel. Walk out that door, deal's off. Stay, it's all yours. People like you, this place, that's what's wrong with the world, Lilah. I will never be a part of this. Not the way you're hoping. Now, let me tell you what the deal's gonna be. This is the longest damn elevator ride I ever took. - How big is this place? - It's time. Time for what? Oh, no. Hey, we better not be going where I think we're going. The answers you seek lie within the room. Only thing I seek is the lobby. I already rubbed elbows with Little Miss Muffet. Don't need a repeat with her replacement. And here I am thinking I'm getting seduced, well, I'm getting screwed, all... - right. Come on, you got the wrong guy in here. This room's for the big... [GROWLING] ...cats. I think I preferred the little girl. [SIRENS WAILING] [GIRL CRYING] Shut up. - You've gotta shut... CONNOR: Hey! - I told you to be nice. - I'm sorry. You're not holding her right. Why don't you hold her right? - I think you broke my arm. - Do it right. Shh. It's going to be okay. It's gonna be okay. You got in. Thought you might. I was wondering how long it'd take you to get here. How'd I do? A little slower than I would've thought. But then, you always did like to take your time. So you finally made it. Got behind the facade, and here it is. Every dirty little scheme, every secret. All that evil, great and small. Just imagine what you could accomplish with that kind of information. You wanted me to see this. - You knew I'd... - <i>Die Hard</i> your way up here? Come on, Wes. Who knows you better than me? Perhaps you don't know me as well as you think. What are you doing, Wesley? Standard perpetuity clause. You broke in here for my contract? - I'm here to release you from it. - Wesley... You've suffered enough. I want you to find some peace. Gallant to the end. But I knew what I signed up for. It's done. Look in the drawer. Flames wouldn't be eternal if they actually consumed anything. But it means something that you tried. Connor? Son... You might not want to move. The people are rigged too. You can't save them all, Dad. You don't know who's gonna be first. Could be any one of them. Could be me. Could be her. [WOMAN CRYING] ANGEL: Son... ...you have to listen to me. - This is about Jasmine. - Jasmine's gone. I know. We all felt it, that perfect love. - Then when we had to give it up... - I didn't feel anything! I can't feel anything. I guess I really am your son because I'm dead too. You're not dead. You're just starting your life. No, you just weren't there before. I know. - I'm so... - Do not say you're sorry! It doesn't fix anything. Okay, then let me say this. - I love you, son. - It's a lie. - It's not. - It's always a lie. My dead mother couldn't even love me. You're wrong. She did. No. No, she knew she couldn't. She sacrificed herself because she loved you. You tried to love me. At least I think you did. - I still do. - But not enough to hang on, Dad. You let him take me. You let him get me. You let him get me. Cordy... ...you swore you loved me. Where are you now? Connor, you have to believe that there are people who love you. Jasmine believed you when you said you loved her... ...but it was all a lie. - Jasmine was the lie. No! She knew if you found out who she was you'd turn against her. And she was right. That's just what happened. People like you... ...people like this, none of you deserved what she could give you. She wanted to give you everything. I know how that feels... ...because I want to give you everything. I want to take back the mistakes... ...help you start over. You can't start over. We can. You and me, we can change things. There's only one thing that ever changes anything... ...and that's death. Everything else is just a lie. You can't be saved by a lie. You can't be saved at all. ANGEL: Run. Hurry up, all of you. Go! I really do love you, Connor. So, what are you gonna do about it? Prove it. [LORNE SINGING] Hi. Oh, let me tell you, when this cruise ship sets sail... ...I will be on the Lido deck. I mean, it's unbelievable. Secrets of the universe. Like Siegfried, evil. Roy, not so much. Oh, and balance? Very, very important. Guess we're all straggling back. Some more straggly-like than others. Are you...? Just... ...a lot to take in. You look... Did they make you taller? I'm doing this. Hope it's not just me. But if it is, that's all right too. As much as it pains me to admit it, there's probably a great deal... ...we could accomplish with the resources available here. I can't believe it. Are...? Are you saying we should take the deal? ANGEL: I already took it. Angel, wha...? What? You took the deal? Executive decision. - I didn't think you'd... LILAH: Know a silver platter? I'm impressed with the lot of you. Team Angel, all growed up. It's taken care of? Cordelia's safe and sound. Probably getting a manicure and a blow dry as we speak. You found Cordy? - And she's...? - Still in a coma. But, hey, doesn't mean she can't look her best. She'll receive the finest care, medical and metaphysical. If there's a way to get her back, we'll find it. Good. Just one more piece of business. I gotta see him. I'm sorry, Angel, but that wasn't part of the deal. Value of compromise. Remember, Lilah? I need to see him. You're the boss. There will be a limo waiting outside. It'll take you to see Connor. Thank you. Who's Connor? CONNOR: You just opened up a whole bottle for yourself, didn't you? I don't know what you're saying. You know, you've got your pick. - Any college you want to. - It's really not a big deal. - Top tenth percentile is. - Is Tracy going to the same college? DAD: Bad idea. - We haven't really talked about it. No, I love Tracy. It's a bad way to go. - Tracy's a vegan. AUNT: So? - At least she doesn't live on Pop-Tarts. - Maybe I'll go to school overseas. Like Russia. Is anything further away than Russia? - Don't you even joke about it. DAD: I feel a toast coming on. AUNT: There he goes. - To the top 10th percentile. Okay, whoa, whoa. Enough. That's all I had to hear. Since it's my special day, and I'm all brilliant... ...and I'm forced to spend a few months with you freaks... Mean! I get to make the toast, okay? To family. SISTER: I should get wine for the toast. CONNOR: No, really? Well, I wasn't talking about this family, I meant... [CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
