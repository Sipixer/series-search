- Boring. They use you as a slave. - Fugitive! - Oh, no! Handsome man saved me from the monsters. - You gonna be all right? - I'm fine. Go. These visions are killing me. Get dressed and get out. Next time I see you, I'll kill you. - He's a hard shaman to find. - You know what they say... ...life's full of surprises. No, Gunn, you misunderstand. I mean, I'm not saying that we act differently. I just think we should be gentle in our-- - Evening, Cordy. - Hey, Cordelia. - How was that? - It felt genuine. B plus, C minus. A girl can tell. Fred, if you feel comfortable enough grading our sincerity... ...how about joining us for the meal? Wasn't that the point of coming downstairs? I guess that'd be okay. I don't mean to rush you back into the 21st century, but use chopsticks. Or a fork, maybe. You remember forks, don't you? Who could forget? Fork. Pitchfork. Fork it over. Fork in the road. One I'm not ready to take yet. - Hello, again. - Nice day. - I know what you're doing. - You do? - Told you. - You're being fake nice and sensitive. Poor Cordelia's on edge because she hasn't had a vision in a while. For your information, I look forward to my next vision. - You do? - Why not? The Powers That Be chose me. - Who am I to refuse? - Great. How about using that vision thing to find out where Angel is? Because I don't care. Cordelia doesn't choose to have a vision. The Powers send them to her. - Think of them as gifts. - "Having my head torn open... ...and hot lava poured into my skull" gifts. Excuse me. Uh, hi. I didn't hear you sneak up on us. Must be those tastefully expensive Gucci loafers. Our fault. He's not a client. He's Gavin Park, attorney with Wolfram and Hart. Pleased to meet you. New player? Now that we've had this lovely reintroduction, I suggest you piss off. - Is there a problem? - No, no problem. - No, Mr. Park was just leaving. - No, actually I just arrived. This is a list of 57 violations for your hotel... ...including earthquake proofing, asbestos and termites. I've filed a copy with the city planning office. Gee, 57. Is that a lot? I'll be in touch. Yeah, okay... ...minion of darkness, Satan's toady. But that is a nice suit. Fred! Good to see you out and about. It is, isn't it? Out and about. I've been forking with Gunn. You all right? Talk to me. There's a coin and two clawed things. It's in Chinatown, I think. An herbalist shop. - Ah! - Easy. - Okay. - Come on. Okay, I'm fine. It just caught me off guard a little. Go find the coin. It has a hole in it. - Yes? - Cordelia... ...that beast you saw, did it have four or five claws? Five. You're certain? Pretty certain. - Anything of interest yet? - Sure, lots. H is a fascinating letter. Helicopters, helium, hernias-- - Did you happen to notice "herbs"? - I did. Oh, right. There are, let's see.... Five herbalist shops in Chinatown. - You got a name for these things yet? - Circling. We looking at either a Wan-shang Dhole or a Cantonese Fook-beast. I say we figure out what they are after we find that coin. Sounds like a plan. Hey, Fred, I need you to do something for me. I told you, it's about finding the coin. - It's me. - I'm fine. I'm not leaving until you open the door. I mean it, Cordelia. Open up. See? Fine. - They're getting worse. - I'm feeling better. Once I get a little protein in me, I'll be good as new. Honest. Go declaw those things. - Fred will take you home. - I don't need to go. There's nothing else you can do here. Just get some rest, okay? - No-- - Okay? Okay. Five herb shops, we've been to four. How come it's always the last place we look? I suppose it's one of the unwritten laws of being a dick. A sleuth, a gumshoe, a Sherlock. You use the word "dick" again and we're gonna have a problem. - What's the name of this place anyway? - Van Hoa Dong. It should be up here on the left. How was Cordelia? She said she was fine. - You don't believe her? - Here we go. Next time, we're hitting the last place first. - Your kind not welcome here. - Can't a brother buy some tea? - Not you, him. Vampire not welcome. - This is a public facility. And any being may enter. We're looking for an ancient coin. You think some fancy flipping and a little hollering can intimidate us? - Okay, that creeps me out. - You two take Grandma. Damn, Grandma and Grandpa got game. If we can just find that coin before they come to. Guys, over here. Asbestos disposal? What? I think that's mine. My printer's down, so I networked into yours. Thanks for asking. This hasn't been announced yet, but I've been moved into Special Projects. - From real estate? - With karmically damaged property... ...not to mention demon infestation, the partners felt I'd be useful. I'm working on something aimed at Angel Investigations. If you're interested, I'd love to have you on my team. Your team? I'll be right in. Let me tell you about your team. You don't have one. - You may have Lindsey's old office-- - I earned this office, as did Lindsey. He sacrificed his flesh and blood, had his hand cut off fighting Angel. What are you doing? Building code violations. - I'm fighting Angel in my own way. - Yeah, I bet he's really terrified. Okay, ready for bed. Face washed, teeth brushed. Tired, tired! You can go now. Fred? - Okay, you can go now, Fred. - Sorry, it's been so long. Not a problem. Take it with you. Enjoy that peanut-y goodness in your own home. - Wait, Angel said that-- - That you should wait until he calls. But, as you can see, I'm fine. I'm better than fine. - I'm right as rain. - I never understood that saying. How is rain right? Or wrong, for that matter. I suppose if there's a flood, it's wrong. And speaking of floods... ...what's it like to have a vision? Wow. You know, next to you, I am downright linear. Do you see things, or smell them, or just know? In-your-stomach know. Like in fifth grade, when I saw Grayson Wells, I knew we'd go steady. We didn't, but looking back, it feels like we did. Is it like that? Okay, time to go. Has anybody ever told you you're exactly like Lassie? You're like Angel's Lassie. Sure, he does the saving... ...but it's your visions that tell him that Timmy's trapped in the well. He really needs and depends on you. Well, thanks. I'd be flattered, except that Lassie's a dog. Dennis, a little help here. See, I'm not alone. I have a ghost. Bye. We'll have to.... Are you all right? It was a demon. An icky, boil-covered demon. A storefront downtown on the corner of 5th and something. And there was a key. I should draw you a picture of the key. Cordy. Oh, God. Cordy, we should talk about this. - You can't ignore it. - I don't wanna talk. What's there to say, except gross, yuck and unclean? - Like you're not thinking it. - Has this ever happened before? Earlier tonight. Are you saying your visions had a physical manifestation? Yeah. - Did this have anything to do with--? - The yuck monster? Yeah. It must be a mistake. The Powers wouldn't do this to me on purpose. I mean, I'm a part of their team. Why would anybody do this on purpose? We have to figure this out, and now. Gunn? I had this auntie who got this crusty stuff on her back. - Turns out she was allergic to fish. - That was helpful. Why would The Powers communicate in this way? Maybe we could ask them. You used the word "communicate. " Everything's made of energy, right? Light waves, radio waves, X-rays, even brain waves are all electric energy. The visions are being communicated somehow. Maybe we could trace the frequency. Yes, of course. Well done, Fred. Gunn, go to the hotel and get me some books. We need to research that coin. Angel, find that demon and the key. I'm not going anywhere. You see what the visions are doing to Cordy. We have to assume that the coin and the key are very significant. So is Cordelia. If I go out, how can I help her? By trusting me. I have an idea. I want the key and I want it now. Which key might that be? - Man. - Did you lose the original? It looks like this. Yes, of course. This should only take a moment. I know you're disappointed you couldn't go with Angel. Right. Why would I want to be with a cute woman... ...when I could be out slaying an ugly, boil-covered demon monster? - I can't apologize enough. - Hey, I just follow orders. It's just that I'm still so jumpy. But I guess that's why you're here-- - Who are you? - Exterminators. You can't come in. At night? I don't think so. Get some of them books out of Wes' office. You'll be okay. I need to talk to this nice man. Show me your work order before I start doing some exterminating. - How is she? - We're finding out. Did you get--? His Royal Badness. Would you talk to her? She's resisting the process. Process? Oh, my idea. The Host reads people's auras. That connects him to The Powers That Be. I'm thinking-- Sure, he can reverse the process and trace the calls to The Powers. Way outside my area of expertise. But, hey, who knew William Shatner could sing? Okay, bad example. Was it there? I'll be ticked if I'm Phantom of the Opera and there wasn't a key. - It was where you said. - Good. Why won't you let Lorne trace the visions? I'm not morally against letting demons into my subconscious for a lookie-loo. But with The Powers That Be doing this whole Book of Job thing... ...it's more noise in my head. - Maybe he can make the noise stop. - Yeah. - Isn't it what you want? - Yes. No. Well, no. I hate looking and feeling like this. But if I lose the visions... ...I wouldn't be able to help you anymore. You wouldn't need me. That's not why I need you. You're important. The visions are just extras, like a Hurst shifter or Craiger wheels. - Did you just compare me to a car? - It was a very nice car. - I guess it's better than a dog. - Cordy, let us try and help, okay? Okay. All right, like I told you earlier, you shouldn't even feel a thing. You ready? Now, I want you to relax. Picture yourself outdoors, in a field or on a mountain. - I like the mountains. - Beautiful. You're on a mountaintop. It's warm, the sky is blue, full of fluffy clouds. You're Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, You're relaxed and you're spinning, and the camera's swirling, and-- Careful, honey, you've got some power. Sorry. All that spinning was freaking me out. My fault, my fault. I just love that movie so much. Ready to try again? Let's go looking for The Powers That Be. See if we can reach out and touch someone. If we don't have your 1099, Payroll can't cut you a check. I know, I know. Hey, you know a good tax guy? Let's just finish the job, then we'll talk about taxes. You're the boss. John Hancock, and done. - You remember what we talked about? - All that fire? How could I forget? Cordy? Cordy! - Well? - I think she got the message. Is Lorne going to be okay? He's fine. He's unconscious, but he's fine. You're the one I'm worried about. Am I a bad person? Am I a horrible person? I know I can be snippy sometimes. This isn't happening because you're bad. If anything, it's because you're strong. Stronger than you realize. I'm not. I know what I said earlier... ...but I don't want the visions anymore. I tried to be brave, I did. But I'm just scared now. I'm scared all the time. I mean, look at me. What could be so important that The Powers would do this? - I don't understand. - I don't either. Angel, I really think you should hear this. This better be important. - Did you make contact? - The visions aren't from The Powers. Sure, steal my thunder. Next time, you can get thrown across the room. - Who's sending the visions? - I don't know. But it's local, earthbound and pretty authentic. A person can mistake it for the real deal. - Someone's hacked into her head? - Transmitting false data. I know it's a mile-long list, but start looking at enemies. Who wants to get to you? Who has the resources? And who'd be willing to mess up a pretty face like Cordelia's? Concentrate. - Damn it. - Jeez, I hate traps. Don't you? I was gonna knock, but you seemed so focused. I hated to interrupt. - How did you get in? - Why didn't the vampire alarms go off? Your colleague Gavin, he helped me out. Colleague, mortal enemy, however you play it here. So can we get down to business? I think you might be looking for these. What do you think? - I think you might be right. - Good. Then we're done here. You got what you wanted, now it's over. Actually, it's not over. You'll need these to complete the mission. There's no mission. We're through. That's where you're wrong. We're just getting started. There's a man who's unfairly imprisoned. You'll save him. Isn't that what you do, save people? You'll need those to complete your mission. I see. I do this for you, you stop sending the killer visions. No. You'll do this for me because I tell you to. I know what you're thinking. You could kill me, but you'll never be able to stop the visions. Those skin problems on what's her name weren't intended. Just a side effect. Her name's Cordelia, and you will help her. So where's this jail? This is why I chose you for the mission. I needed a man of character. A champion of good, a warrior. And someone who could travel in and out of a fortressed demon dimension. How's Cordelia? Fred and Gunn are looking after her. You figure it out? I think so. Something you won't like to hear... ...is that both artifacts are objects of good. - The Chinese guy and the boil guy.... - Aligned with the forces of good. Damn. So hard to tell these days. They should wear lapel pins. Well, the inscriptions on the coin and the key match. They work together to transport you to the other dimension. Do we know what this dimension is like? Besides fortress-y and demon-y. Based on the burn scars Cordy received... - ...fire's not out of the question. - Fire. And if the man is imprisoned, I'd imagine there may be guards. Guards. If Wolfram and Hart are behind this mission, it can't be good. Just because Lilah tells you this man is wrongly imprisoned... - ...doesn't make it so. - You're right. - This violates what you stand for. - Right again. Then you'll let me go too. Right-- No. I need you to stay here in case anything goes wrong. Now, show me how it works. I believe it's fairly simple. Ready? This should take you there and bring you back. You're sure I can't come with you? Take care of Cordy. Sure, because it'd be too easy if I could actually defend myself. I've still got the key. - Hi. - Hi. - You're not supposed to be here. - Yeah. What about him? Him? He's supposed to be here. Do you know how bad a guy's gotta be before he's sent to us? We're a very high-end institution. - And it's your job to keep him here? - Yeah. I'm Skip. Angel. So you live in here, Skip? No, I commute. It's not too bad. About 20 minutes. What keeps him in the fire? My will. How come he's not screaming in pain? He is. My will prevents him from being heard. There's only so many "The pain! Make it stops" you can listen to... ...before it bugs the crap out of you. I see your point. You're a vampire? How come it smells like you work for The Powers? Because I do. But you're here to try to rescue this guy? We're on the same side. Shouldn't you help keep him here? I know. Long story. Involves a girl. I don't like it any better than you. So I really can't talk you out of this? Sorry. I wish I could. I guess we'll just have to agree to-- --disagree. Skip, are you okay? Good. Sorry about this. You know what to do, anything goes wrong. Pop goes the weasel. No one at the firm thought you could do it, except me. You're a remarkable man. Yeah. And you're an evil bitch. Let's finish this. Take care of Cordelia, you get your guy. This should only take a moment. Hello? Wesley, it worked. She's okay. It's just business. Right. Just business. Don't come at me through Cordelia. You play that card a second time, and I'll kill you. I'm glad you're feeling better, but.... You're not really a foodie. I know. But I saw this great big industrial kitchen that we have and never use... ...and I thought that-- One of these days, we should get someone in here that can cook. Here we are. Here we are. Angel? What you did for me was... ...unbelievably selfless and brave and amazing. It's great to know that my next vision... ...will just be painful and not turn me into the Elephant Man. I hear a big "but" coming. What if that guy you freed is someone that's truly terrible? They won this time, and it's my fault. It's not about winning, it's about what's at stake. In this scenario, you were way more important than winning. I can't worry about that guy I set free. I did what I had to do. I'll just deal with the consequences when they happen. You're a difficult man to find, señor. Do you know why I'm here? You are my last hope. I've been told you're very powerful, very wise. I've tried everything, and I can't get rid of it. I ask you: What is this thing growing inside of me, and how is it possible? - The father is also a...? - Vampire? Yes. Though not a very good one. - I will need some blood. - Well.... I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Men are such babies. This has never failed me. I cannot help you. No man can. This is not meant to be known. Yeah, yeah. Like I haven't heard that before.
