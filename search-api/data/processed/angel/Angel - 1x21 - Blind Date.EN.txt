Turn them on and let them go. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Here you go. - Nice doing business with you. Wait, miss! Okay. Demons with one eye, demons with 12 eyes, some with double vision. No blind demons. - Perhaps Angel's found a new species. - What? Helen Kellerus Homicidalus? - It's possible she's not a demon. - You think? Maybe she's learned to hone her senses around her disability. Angel said it was like she anticipated his actions. A handy skill, in a fight or on a date. Unusual to be certain, but not necessarily demonic. Someone like that stands out in a crowd. For an assassin, I mean. - Decidedly. - Maybe even have a record. One assumes she's done this sort of thing before. - Vanessa Brewer. - What? You found her? It doesn't always have to be weird. Sometimes real human people can be just awful. - First arrested in '93. - She fled the scene of a homicide. No charges. Arrested again in '95. Charged with aggravated assault. That one never went to trial. And finally arrested in '99 as a suspect in a double homicide... - ...for which she's now on trial. - She was on bail when Angel met her. But that's not the real whammy. Look who's defending her. We request the court's compassion in this obviously mishandled affair. The D.A.'s attempt to link Miss Brewer... ...to this brutal crime is almost laughable. To think that my client, with her particular disability... ...could physically commit such a murder... ...is beyond the realm of belief. Hey, hold it! She obviously doesn't see the way we do, but she can see. In a sense. The eye's only capable... ...of registering a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. But if she were equipped to see outside that range-- She'd be Superman. What's the diff in how she sees? She'll look at cell bars. Why are we still talking about this? Because Wolfram and Hart's representing her pro bono... ...which means she's probably still working for them. I can't believe you got her off on all charges. Not since Ostrosky vs. California... ...have I seen such devious legal maneuvering. And now the big brass are smiling upon you. You're the man of the hour. Is there something you want? Is it me, or is there something kind of hot about her? I'm just saying, I wouldn't say no. I'd be too scared to. - Lindsey, come say hello. - I think she likes you. You remember Lindsey McDonald, our point man on Miss Brewer's case? Did an excellent job. - Thank you, Lindsey. - You're welcome. - It's nice to see you again. - You too. Bye. Got a sec? Does she unnerve you? A little. Two minutes with her, I feel like my spine's been fused. Still, one has to admire her talent and her work ethic. - You okay? You look stressed. - I've been putting in the hours-- Well, that's a big part, the perspiration. But the other part, the inspiration... ...you've had a rough year on that end. - I've made some bad choices. - Well, I'll say. - Sending the rogue slayer after Angel? - Among other things. But you had success in court. You're pulling out of it. I'm fond of you. I'd like to see you move up. - I'm glad to hear that, sir. - Not everybody will. This is kind of our harvest time of year... ...where we separate the winners from the dead weight. I have to say, you don't seem that happy lately. Could I take a wild stab as to what it might be? Sure. It's your age. You're a young man. You've hitched your wagon to our bright star. But now you're starting to feel, "Is that all there is?" - Sometimes you question things but-- - I did crazy things when I was young. Searching and all. Took me a while to realize how the world was and where I belonged. Actually, the world isn't that complicated. It's made for those who know how to use it. - Yes, sir. - Don't give me that "Yes, sir" crap. I want you to think about these things. You won't be happy till you find your place in the world. Enough of the old guy's lecture. Down to business. I doubt she had a happy childhood. - Sir? - Our blind friend, Vanessa. She was terribly abused, the details of which are tragic and shocking. You should create them. Sooner, rather than later. She'll do something that requires a strong defense. Strong defense, alibis, creative alternatives to incarceration. She's an invaluable tool to some of our most important clients. What will she do? There's some children arriving. They pose a threat. Some children? Is this too shocking for you? I'm thinking it might be, for a jury. Which is why I'm thinking her terrible childhood drove her to it. Not guilty by reason of insanity. But she probably won't be caught. Who are these children? It's best we know only what we need to... ...without forgetting the important part we play in the whole. You'll want to get right on it. - They acquitted her. Hung jury. - I'm sorry, Angel. How can I fight evil if they won't put it away? - It's not your fault. - No, it's not my fault. I didn't cause it, and I can't fix it. I can't do anything about it. Well, she's guilty. She's guilty and they let her go. I saw her murder a man, and I can't even testify to that in court. - Maybe in night court-- - It's their court, not mine. - Whose? - Their rules, their game. - You mean the Wolfram-and-Hart types. - I have no place in their world. - Angel--! - How can I fight if I can't get in? You have a place. We'll fight elsewhere. It's still their world, Wesley. Structured for power, not truth. It's their system, and it's one that works. It works because there's no guilt... ...there's no torment, no consequences. It's pure. I remember what that was like. Sometimes I miss that clarity. But not the "trying to kill your friends and family" part, right? Just checking. Nothing ever changes. I need your help. What do you mean? I want out. You probably think this is a trick. Are you afraid of me, Lindsey? You think maybe I might kill you? No. I'm smelling a whole lot of fear. Big, stinky, mortal terror. So, no. I don't think this is a trick. I think it's a big joke. I don't like this any more than you. - I don't have a choice. - Yes, you do. You sold your soul for a nice office and a company car. You think you got me all figured out? You know everything about me? - Everything I need to know. - Your father was a merchant, right? Linen and silk? Did pretty well? Had servants until you killed them? Just the one. Well, our files aren't a hundred percent. But I guess it's fair to say you've never seen real poverty. I'm talking dirt poor, no shoes, no toilet... ...six kids in a room. After flu season, we were four. I was 7 when they took the house. Came right in and took it. And my daddy's being nice, joking while he signs the deed. My choice was to be stepped on or get stepping... ...and I swore I'd never be the guy with the stupid grin on my face... - ...while my life got dribbled out. - Sorry, I nodded off. Get to the part where you're evil. I found out about a job. The blind woman. Vanessa Brewer. - That you got off. - There's a new contract. - Save the lawyer talk-- - She's gonna kill some kids. I've worked pretty hairy deals. Comes with the turf. But this.... What do you know? Almost nothing. Some kids from overseas, job's in a few days. I need more. There's some files. They'd be in the firm vault. - Get them. - I can't go back. - You understand what that place is? - I don't sense resolve-- They constantly watch you. Other companies have drug testing... ...they have mind readers. They'd kill me. That's an acceptable risk. You're panicking. You can't believe how bad you let things get. That's not change. You gotta make a decision to change. That's something you do by yourself. Most people? They never do. I get myself killed, that'll convince you I've changed? It's a start. Vault's at sublevel 2, opposite the boiler room. - Sewer access? - Burn your way in. Why are you going? I thought he was doing it. - Two-man job. And the vault? - My pass. I need it to get in because of tight security... ...but I can leave it downstairs for you. - Again, I say-- - It's guarded. Demon. Doesn't like unauthorized visits. - What kind of demon? - Pregothian, I think. - I'll get you a profile, weaknesses. - Right. I'll do my best with security. You gotta move fast because-- Damn it! - What? - The threshold has shamans. They can sense a vampire crossing the threshold. - Won't be a problem. - Seems pretty simple... ...except for the "you'll get caught" factor. "The righteous shall walk a thorny path." Yeah, I can get ahold of one. But why would I want to? For justice and doing the right thing? Not interested in some rich guy's heartbreak. You're low. Just my opinion. - Give me one good reason. - It'll be very dangerous. Okay. Entering sublevel 3, Priority clearance required, Lilah. - You scared me. - Me too. I'm sorry. I'm always in too much of a hurry. I think we all are. - Oh, yeah. Doing some research? - Only when I want it done right. I can make myself look stupid, but I hate it when some clerk does. I was under the impression you never touch a book anymore. Little secret between you and me. If the amoebas find out you're willing to read, you lose their respect. Personnel approaching security office, - Hello, Mr. McDonald. - Howard, got a minute? Sure. I saw the Series 7500 video surveillance system you suggested. Do I need cellular override and digital link? - It seems a little overkill. - Better safe than sorry. They said it was true, but I didn't believe them. Damn, here it is! Evil white folks really do have a mecca. Now, girls, don't get riled up, You just step on my foot? Was that my foot you stepped on? Are you assaulting me Up in this haven of justice? Somebody get me a lawyer. My civil rights have seriously been violated. I get it. You all can cater to the demon and the dead man... ...but what about the black man? I'd love to stay and chat, but.... Yo, fellas! We got a vampire on the premises. Repeat, a vampire. Well, looks like you got your hands full so.... Thank you, Wesley. What's all the excitement? A vampire in the lobby, did I hear that right? Never a dull moment. We're done. Get out now. Can you believe this? It's a sweep. I'll never make my lunch. What is it? Mind readers. Shouldn't we have been memoed? That's why they're called random mind readings. It's Lilah. It looks like I won't be able to make the 1:00. Great. I have to say this is a shame. It's just a shame. Whenever I hear of disloyalty, it hurts me. Hurts me personally. But this sort of thing must be dealt with quickly... ...and cleanly. And unambiguously. - I'm sorry, Lee, I truly am. - What? No. You've been in secret talks with Klein and Gabler. They approached me. You planned on taking clients with you. You don't understand. They misread me. I wanted them to think-- Terminating an employee is never pleasant. That's all. Lindsey. Why don't you hang on for a minute? - Lindsey? - He's not with you? That can't be good. Something must've happened. You're not going back? If he made it, he'll come. If not, there's nothing I can do. We're busy. - So you got the files then? - Right here. - Which one is it? - I don't know. We'll have to find it. Angel, what's this? I'm not sure. - Ancient Aramaic, if I'm not mistaken. - Yeah? - Was there a reason you took this? - Yeah. And that would be...? I don't really know. Well, I'll get to work translating them. Guys? Might want to translate this first. - It's encrypted. - I bet the rest of these are too. Great. What a pity. You can't get that out of the carpet. Believe me, we've tried. Are you afraid? I can see why. You betrayed this firm by allying yourself... ...with someone who has given us a great deal of grief. You've stolen important documents from our vault. Tried to sabotaged an extremely important case. And in the course of this egregious behavior, you lied to us. More importantly, to me. Did I leave anything out? No, sir. Did you actually believe I wouldn't learn everything? Lindsey, this is a delicate moment. I nod to Phil behind me, and he'll put a bullet in your head. I didn't want to lie to you. I didn't want to betray you. I just wanted out. Well then, you're in a crisis, son. A crisis of faith. Do you believe in love? I'm not speaking romantically. I'm talking about that sharp, clear sense of self a man gains... ...once he's truly found his place in the world. It's no mean feat, since most men are cowards and just move with the crowd. A very few make their own destinies. They have moral courage, and they know how to behave in a crisis. Like now? Like now. You have everything it takes to go all the way: Drive, ambition, excellence. But you don't know where you belong. And until you do... ...we both have some important questions to answer. Now, my first one is: Do I nod to my friend behind me? No. No, I don't. Because I know you, and I know something about character. What you actually need is a few days off to think about it. And I'm sure once you have, you're gonna do the right thing. I can-- I can go? You can go. Lindsey. I believe in you. Look deep enough inside yourself. You'll find that love. I'm back to the desktop, Willow. What do I do now? Okay, done that. Back to file list. Any luck? She's been on the phone for two hours. Guess what they've been doing? - Saving the world? - Well, yeah. They've been breaking encrypted computer files too. - What are the odds, huh? - I know. What? - Oh, no one. Just Wesley. - Cordelia, can she get us in? - Willow says hey. - Hey. Okay. Yeah. I see it. Tag file. Okay. Left click. There it is. Back door. We're in. Thanks, Will. Personnel file, Vanessa Brewer. She lost her sight when she was 21. - On purpose. She did it to herself. - Oh, dear. And she spent five years in Pajaur, studying the Nanjin... - ...which explains her power. - It does? Yes, the order of the Nanjin, cave-dwelling monks. They believe enlightenment is seeing with the heart, not mind. So self-mutilating, psycho assassin chick reached enlightenment? She's more sensitive to her surroundings than a sighted person... - ...which makes her unstoppable. - No one's unstoppable. What's her job? Here it is. Lindsey was right. Children. Three of them. Seers. Found in different remote areas, brought together for the first time. They're blind. Together, they have power to see into the heart of things. A holy triumvirate. As they mature, so does their power. Which makes them a real threat to Wolfram and Hart. Sorry I'm late. - I hope you didn't worry. - We figured you were dead. So you made it out okay. Yeah, but they'll soon find out which files are missing. We gotta move fast. When do the children arrive? They came this morning. They're at a safe house until their mentor arrives. - He's coming in tonight. - Not safe. There's an address. Intercept the mentor. Keep him away from that house. - We'll bring the kids to him. - Okay. Get the kids out of here! It's all right. You're all right. The children are safe with their mentor. Good. They have an important role to play. This is how Wolfram and Hart knew of their coming. - You know what it is? - The Prophecies of Aberjian, I think. For centuries, thought lost. I translated some of the text. It mentions the children you saved today. I also believe I know why you were drawn to it. There's an entire passage about you. It doesn't call you by name, but it tells of a vampire with a soul. - This doesn't surprise you? - No. - You said you didn't know what it was. - I didn't, but-- - Somehow you did? - Yeah. There is a design, Angel. Hidden in the chaos as it may be... ...but it's there. And you have your place in it. Holland. Hello, Lindsey. I'm sorry. I did what I had to. You saved the children. That's very noble. - I brought the disks back. - Of course, you made copies. A few things. Just enough to keep me safe. - What does safe mean to you? - Not warring with Wolfram and Hart. - Having my own life. - Haven't you learned anything? No one has that. We're all parts of a whole. Like Wolfram and Hart. I picked you when you were a sophomore at Hastings... ...not because you were smart... ...or a poor kid who had to do better than anyone else... ...but because you had potential for seeing things as they are. It's not about good or evil. It's about who wields the most power. We wield a lot, and the world's better for it. - I didn't come back-- - Why did you come back? To return some disks? Take a moral stand? I don't think so. You called me by my first name. You never did that before. You wouldn't have had the nerve. But you're different now. You stood up to us and won. You know how many people have that nerve? I can count them on one hand. I need people like that working for us. - You're offering me my job back? - No. I'm offering you a new job. A permanent one, with a thundering raise and ungodly benefits. In fact, I'm offering you this very office. I'm going upstairs. What I'm offering you, Lindsey, is the world. I know you pretty well, and I bet you'll take it. You may not know me as well as you think. As I told you, it's a decision each person has to make for himself.
