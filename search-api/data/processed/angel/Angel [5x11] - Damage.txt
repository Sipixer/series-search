please pick up extension 432. [Man Shouting] Hey, Doc? Running low on diazepam... again. CallJacobson over at county and see if they can spare any. Give me one. Okay. Um... "In a mellifluous manner." Seven letters, ends in a "Y." Give me another one. Dr. Rabinaw.! It's Phillip. - What happened? - L... I don't know. He started convulsing right after he took his meds. - How much lithium did you give him? - Lith... No, he gets Thorazine. Thorazine? He's manic-depressive. He doesn't need a sedative. I'm sorry. I must've gotten them mixed up. Who didn't get their Thorazine? - Oh, God. - [Loud Pounding] [Rabinaw] Peterson.! [Pounding Continues] - [Pounding Stops] - [Sighs] It's all right, Dana. It's me, Dr. Rabinaw. Remember? Just take it easy. I want you to listen to me. You're very sick... and we just... want to make you better, okay? - [Bat Clatters On Ground] - Oh, no. - No! - [Orderly Groaning] [Flesh Tearing] Yes, I know, but he wouldn't have pled nolo contendere ifhe'd known... about the exculpatory evidence being withheld by the prosecutor. Look, set up a meeting with Judge Braeden, closed chambers. Well, screw the D.A. He's the one trying to pull a fast one. Let him read about it in the paper. You sure that's a good idea? Playing chicken with the district attorney of a major metropolitan city? Just a little professional rivalry. You want ugly? See us go at it on the golf course. You play golf? Since... What? All part of the mojo the big boys installed. Half the cases that cross our desk are settled out on the links... before they ever make it to trial. Nine holes instead of a jury of your peers. Just what the founding fathers had in mind. Well, sometimes you gotta work the system before it works you. That our new motto? Look, I know our move to Wolfram and Hart hasn't been all flowers and candy. But we've been able to do some serious good while we're here. Lives saved, disasters averted, with all our fingers and souls still attached. End of the day, I'm thinkin' we made the right choice. Maybe we made a mistake comin' here. - What's goin' on? - Parasite Eve, right on out the door. - You're firing her? - Well, that's one option. A generous one, considering she tried to kill you. Okay, first, the parasite she allegedly sicced on you wasn't meant to be fatal. No. Just send you into a permanent hallucinogenic coma. And what's with the "alleged"? You don't believe I know it was her? It's not about what I believe. It's about the evidence. This isn't a courtroom, Gunn. Things work with a bit more immediacy in the real world. She's liaison to the senior partners. You don't get to be that without serious juice. Move against her without solid proof, and it could end in a long, bloody fight. Okay, fine. I think I liked you better when you just wanted to hit people. Rational thought. It's an acquired taste. Wait a minute. So we're not gonna snap Twiggy into little sticks? - Gunn's right. We can't risk it... yet. - We'll restrict her access. Keep a closer eye on what she's up to. Play her like she's been playin' us. Boss, we just got a tip some loony's hatched from the bin. - A who did a what? - A girl over in the nuthouse went all <i>Cuckoo's Nest.</i> - Hacked up a couple of guards, went over the wall. - Really not our department. - Notify the authorities. Make sure they're on it. - Okay. But they better bring a priest. Looks like this chick's gone all kinds of <i>Exorcist.</i> - Wait a minute. She's possessed? - Duh. Didn't I say that? - I'll get a team together. - No. Wait. I don't wanna go stormin' in with troops until we know what we got here. I've seen a few of these possession cases. They have to be handled very carefully. Real finesse job. Oh. [Chuckles] Well, fancy this. Bitty slug I saved you from scramble your brains after all? Come to check yourself in? - What are you doin' here, Spike? - Didn't get the memo? - Hero of the people now. - Then go and annoy them. When I'm done. Heard one of the simples went for a stroll. And I'll get her back, without your help. Goody for you, 'cause not offering it. Look, shouldn't you be out on the streets, protecting the city from people like you? - I go where I'm needed. - Which isn't here. - Gentlemen, may I help you? - Can I help you? - Other way around, Doc. I'm... - Here to get your patient back. Angel. Wolfram and Hart. A lawyer? I already told the police everything I know. Well, let's go over it again, just in case you left out any details. Yeah, what he said, but with a bit more of a threat at the end. [Rabinaw] She was a special case. Her family was murdered in their home when she was ten. Whoever did it took Dana and tortured her for months. She was found one day naked and bleeding... wandering the streets, barely functional. - Nearly catatonic ever since. - Looks like she snapped out of it. Several months ago her condition changed. Increasing levels of agitation... accompanied by explosive outbursts of inhuman strength. - Right. Demon possession. - That's ridiculous. - Look, you're not helpin', Spike. - No, I'm doing. You can hang out for the show-and-tell me nothing. I got a demon needs repossessing. Ta. Sorry. He's... Is pathological idiot an actual condition? May I suggest that you stop your friend? If he finds Dana, he's gonna wind up dead like the others. Yeah, but he'll just end up comin' back. What isn't he tellin' me? Rabinaw videoed all his sessions with her. Show me. [Munching] Um... Uh... Hey, you gonna pay for those? Excuse me. Miss, you can't just eat those like that. You gotta take 'em up to the register and pay for 'em first. Hey, come on. Knock it off, would... [Screams] [Moaning] [Girl Whimpering] All right, now. You just stay right like that. I don't wanna have to hurt you. - [Speaking Foreign Language] - [Nurse] And that's with the Thorazine. - These tapes are all of her? - Most of'em, yeah. Rabinaw's planning on writing a book on her. That's why he doesn't want anybody to know about these<i>. Putz.</i> You're the one that called Wolfram and Hart? My cousin's a paralegal there. Told me about the big shake-up. - Lots of positions opening. So I thought, hey... - Uh-huh. Maybe if I tipped you on this, I could get my foot in the door. Oh, wait. [Speaking Another Foreign Language] They're pretty much all like that. Bunch of monkey gibberish. - It's Romanian. - Oh. You... You understand what she's saying? Yeah, I do. [Siren Wailing] [Ringing] - Wyndam-Pryce. - [Angel] Wes, it's me. Check with our police informants. Get her last known sighting. I need a tactical assault team on the ground in five minutes. - Nonlethal ordnance. - You think that's wise? - I've been brushing up on demonic possessions... - That's not what's happening. Look, there were drawings of demons in her room. Hundreds of them. Some with a little girl in them. I thought it was Dana, but they're all different. It's not her. Are you sure? Multiple personality manifestations... are often associated with cases of possession. It's notjust the drawings. I saw a tape ofher. She was speaking a half dozen languages. One of'em was Romanian. Likin'the view, are we? What say we have a nice, quiet chat about mistreating little girls? Demon to demon. She was yelling about being chosen. She's not a demon, Wes. She's a Vampire Slayer. What are you grinnin' at? [Grunts Loudly] Oh, yeah. Look at the big, bad demon hidin' inside the helpless little girl. Why don't you come on out of there and let's have a proper go, mate. Or you could do that. [Speaking Foreign Language] Sorry, luv. I don't speak Chinese. What happened? I just thought I'd see what it was like to bounce off the pavement. - Pretty much what I expected. - Stay out of it. Tactical's on the way. Oh, right. Sure, she'll hang around till they show up. - You should have waited. - Hey, keep your knickers on. At least now I know what we're dealing with. It's a Chinese demon. Maybe a water dragon or one of those elemental thingies. What? - A psychotic Vampire Slayer. - How many times you gonna keep saying that? Just trying to wrap my lobes around it. A psycho Slayer. - And you let her get away. - At least I was trying to stop her. - Oh, how'd that work out? - At least I know the game now, don't I? I killed two Slayers with my own hands. - Think I can handle one that's gone daft in the melon. - You're not handling anything. Wes contacted Rupert Giles. He sent in his top guy to retrieve her. - [Chattering] - [Wesley] Angel. - We were just about to... - Spike? - Oh, for the love of... - Spike? It's you. It's really you. [Sighs] My therapist thought I was holding onto false hope, but I knew you'd come back. [Sniffles] You're like... You're like Gandalf the White... resurrected from the pit of the Balrog, more beautiful than ever. [Sighs] He's my Frodo. He's alive. You two know each other? [Sniffles] Uh, yeah. Uh, we... we saved the world together. I mean, Buffy helped, but it was mostly us. So what happened? Last I heard, you went all pillar of fire down in the Hellmouth. Can we save memory lane till after we contain... this psychotic super-powered killing machine? We were just about to bring everyone up to speed on Slayer mythology. I'll take it from here, Pryce. Best they hear it from an expert. Oh, right. Let the top man have a go. Please, enlighten us. Gather round and attend to a most unusual tale. A tale I like to call... the "Slayer of the Vampyres." [Clears Throat] Eons ago, on the dark continent, three wise elders decided... to fight evil with a taste of its own <i>sinistro.</i> They took a young girl, and they imbued her with the power of a demon. Thusly, the first Slayer of the Vampyres was born. But, alas, the existence of a Slayer is often brutal and short-lived. And the Primitive, as she was called, boasted no exception. But the elders had foreseen this inevitability... and devised a way for her power to live on. In every generation, one is chosen. Yes, attractive, slender woman. There are many Potentials, as we experts call them. Hundreds, maybe thousands per generation. Each of them experiencing vivid dreams... some say nightmares, of the heroics of past Slayers. But only one can be chosen. That's, uh, really great. But we actually know all that. You think you know, my good man. You think you know. Wait. So if there's only one Slayer... what is little Miss Whack Your Head Off doing scampering around? A little Sunnydale surprise. Six months ago, Buffy, Vampyr Slayer extraordinaire... had her lesbian witch make with the <i>beaucoup de magie.</i> - One light show later... - All the Potentials become Slayers. An army of Slayers. Brilliant stratagem. But with the Watchers Council destroyed... how will these new Slayers receive their necessary... Mr. Giles and a few key Sunnydale alum... have been tracking down the recently chosen... guiding them, training them, giving them the full <i>X- Men...</i> minus the crappy third act. But this Dana girl, she's an anomaly that no one could have foreseen. Tortured, traumatized, driven insane by Yoda-knows-who. And then the dreams of demons and superpowers she's always had suddenly become real. The dreams of Slayers are usually just that... dreams. But Dana's mental instability may be making them seem more real. My hypothesis exactly, Pryce. I see Mr. Giles may have been wrong about you. That explains why that skirt was yappin' at me in Chinese. Must've thought she was the Slayer I took out back in the Boxer Rebellion. You mean the Slayer you murdered. Well, I didn't have a soul back then, did I? Right. 'Cause having one now is making such a difference. You corporates go ahead with your talky-talk. Anybody needs me, I'll be out doin' his job. Spike. - You think this is a joke? - Only if you're the punch line. We're the last two people that should be confronting her. She's a Slayer. She has every reason to hate us, and she's unstable. In her mind, there probably aren't any good "vampyres." Vampires. She exists for one reason... to destroy creatures like us. Dance of death. Eternal struggle. Right. Got it. - You will, when she's staking you in the heart. - What do you want me to do? Go all boo-hoo 'cause she got tortured and driven out of her gourd? Not like we haven't done worse back in the day. - Yeah, and it's somethin' I'm still paying for. - You should let it go, mate. It's startin' to make you look old. [Elevator Bell Rings] [Girl Whimpering] Hey, you okay? Hey, you okay? You hurt? Miss? You need some help? Maybe Spike was right. Maybe we should just get out there and find her. And then what? Kill her? What's happening isn't her fault. She is non compos mentis. Not that it'll matter when she's staking you in the pump. We know that she's been sighted at these locations since her escape. Tactical's doin'a nonengagement sweep, but they'll have to cover over at least 60 blocks. That'll take days, if we're lucky. We have to narrow it down. Witnesses say it was like she was looking for something. - We have to figure out what. - Well, why not start at the source? - The asylum? - No. Where all this started for her. - She was abducted from home, right? - That was over 15 years ago. Houses have long memories, Angelcakes. You just gotta know how to get 'em to talk. [Sighs] All right, fine, set it up. But let's get Andrew in on this. See ifhe knows... anything. - Um, I don't think he's here. - What? Where'd he go? Right. We can play cat and mouse all night. Or I could wedgie you unconscious and be done with it. Bravo. I see your senses seem to be as... well-honed as your Viggo Mortensen pectorals. What are you doin' out here, Andrew? This is where the action is, bro. On the mean streets. Can you dig it? Go back to Wolfram and Hart. Don't have time for games. That's good, 'cause Andy ain't playin'. You're not the only one who's changed. Mr. Giles has been training me. I am faster, stronger and 82% more manly than the last time we... [High-pitched Screaming] Hardwood floors, central air... original wainscoting throughout. She's a real charmer, from top to bottom. The walls scream with the blood of the innocent. I'll be in the car if you have any questions. And remember, it's a seller's market. You sure this guy's reliable? [Lorne] Oh, yeah. Vernon's top-drawer. He does all Tom Arnold's readings. - What are you pickin' up? - [Exhales] Fear. Anguish. Pain. He needed them to suffer. Who? She doesn't know him. She tries to be still. Invisible. But he senses her. [Screaming] She's gone. Where? Where did he take her? [Inhales Deeply] Dark. The floor is cold. The air is thick with dust. [Sniffs] And the smell. Sickly sweet like molasses. A basement. That's where her pain lives. [Spike] Let's try the blue one this time. [Andrew] Well, mostly I talk to Rupert. But we all check in. Xander is in Africa. He sent me a mbuna fish. And Willow and Kennedy are in Brazil. They're based out of Sao Paulo, but, um, every time I talk to them, they're in Rio. [Sniffs] [Sniffs] What's it smell like? Blood, I mean. Metallic, sort of. You ever taste a penny? No. Wait. No. Smells like that. So, uh, heard from Buffy lately? Yeah, of course. Uh, she's in Rome. Dawn's in school there. Italian school. Oh, Rome, eh? Never pegged her for the expatriate show. Yeah, she was rounding Slayers up in Europe. Decided she liked it there, I guess. I think that, uh... - [Groaning] - [Clinks On Ground] I think she needed a break from California. Wait a minute. She doesn't know you're alive, does she? I don't think so. I mean, I don't know. Does she? No. No, no, she can't. I mean, I would have heard about it. - We would have had a conference call. - [Exhales] Why haven't you told her? Hello, Buffy, it's Spike. I didn't burn up like you thought. How are things? Do you want me to tell her? 'Cause I'm really good with those delicate, personal... No, don't tell her. I'll take care of it. Got it. You're a loner, playin' it cucumber, as in "cool as a." - Just keep your mouth shut. - No problem, brother. [Andrew] You're a troubled hero. A creature of the night. - El criatura del noche. - [Spike] Please stop. Living by his own rules, unafraid of anything, anyone. - Hey, how'd it go? - I want to find the guy who killed Dana's family. His name, his past, his whereabouts, everything. - Police never caught him. - Well, we're not the police. Search our files, talk to our contacts, raise the dead if we have to. Just find him. Lorne, I wanna know where he took her after he abducted her. The psychic narrowed it down to a basement that smells like molasses. We can do better. Start cracking the whip. You got it, chief. Danny, we're gonna need a whip! So I say, "Well, the two of us disagree with you, hombre." And he's all, "The two of you?" And I say, "Yeah, me and my electric net." And then... - What's wrong? - Blood. Smells different. Stronger. Like nickels? Dead end? It's her blood. All right, pet. No getting away. Got your scent locked in now. I can track you for miles. No escaping. That's right, no escaping. All the same, don't want to have to hurt you. It doesn't hurt if you hold still. [Chuckles] Right. Heart and head. Have to get home. It doesn't hurt if you hold still. You're a real sack of hammers, aren't you? Hey, don't worry. I used to date a girl who wasn't all there. Heart and head. Stab the heart, cut off the head. - Only way to be sure. - That's Slayer talk, isn't it? - Keep cutting till you see dust. - Right. Let me explain. You got visions, right? Vampire, Slayer memories kickin' around in your head. Which is tough, 'cause it sounds like you're past midnight on the crazy clock anyway. Please don't. I have to get home to my son... to my Robin. Robin? Oh, hey, you're talkin' about Nikki, the Slayer I offed back in... Uh, yeah, you probably don't want to think about that, pet. - William the Bloody. - No, no, no. That's not gonna lead anywhere good. You wanna focus on what's real. - Head and heart. Don't be scared. - Now, we're gonna... [Screams, Groaning] You little minx. - What did you do to me? - Yellows make you weak. - Not weak anymore. - [Groans] - All right, now you've made me mad. - Don't cry. They can't hear you. [Whimpering] Stop! Daddy's gone. He can't hear you. Goin' down, luv. One way or the other. Piece by piece, yellow makes you weak. Brown makes you sleepy. [Shudders] Can't hurt me anymore. You crazy little... - I never... - Shh. Hold still. Count backwards. Ten, nine... eight, seven... - Tactical found the body here, Fourth and Camden. - Great. She's staying in the area. Let's get aerial surveillance up, thermal imaging. - Have 'em go block to block, five-mile radius. - What are they lookin' for? I mean, this is an industrial area. Most of the buildings have a basement of some sort. - Lorne, any luck with the psychics on this place? - No, nothin' new. It's still cold, creepy, and smells like molasses. What about... I almost said the words "molasses factory" out loud. Whiskey. Oh, God bless you, kitten. I was just about to suggest the same thing. No, I mean when you're cookin' up whiskey, it makes the whole room smell like molasses. Look for a distillery. Get maps from ten years ago. - Andrew... - We were attacked. I think she got him. I think she got Spike. Piece by piece. - What did you do... - Shh. Stay quiet. I'll let you go. [Exhales] You hammer sack. What did you do... to me? Losing all your pieces. Not weak. Can't touch me anymore. Oh, God. I can't feel my... No! No more Daddy, no more Mommy, no more hands. You can't touch me ever again. I never touched you. - Shut up! - Stop! You've got it wrong. Your brain's all jumbled. I never hurt you. It wasn't me. I've done my share of bad, but you're not one of'em. It's someone else. [Girl Crying] You've got me confused with another man. Let me go! Let me go! Stop! Look. Visions are mixing with your real memories... right, all stuffed in your head. Other Slayers, other places... New York, China. [Speaking Chinese] That's what you're remembering... other Slayers. You killed her. Yes. But... You killed them both. That and worse. But I was never here. It doesn't matter! Head and heart. Keep cutting till you see dust. Dana, look, I'm here to help you. The man who tried to hurt you, his name is Walter Kindel. He tried to rob a liquor store five years ago, and the police shot him. - He's dead, Dana. - Hold still. He can't hurt you anymore. [Panting] Can't hurt me. Not weak anymore. That's right. Strong. Slayer. - [Grunting] - Now! [Man] We got her. Move in. - [Angel] Get the med team down here, now.! - [Man] You heard. Let's go. Get it prepped, put surgical on standby. We'll be there in ten minutes. Oh, for God's sake! Tell the shaman no cadavers. We've got his hands. Go, go. Chain her into the van. I want armed guards ridin' with her in the back. - That's all right, boys. I'll take her from here. - What? Totally appreciate your help on this one, big guy. Never could have found her without you. But you've got enough problems of your own to worry about. Get out of the way, Andrew. She's a Slayer. That means she's ours. Yeah. Sorry. Not how it works. Load her up. Don't hesitate to tranq her if she so much as... I don't think you heard me, Angel. You think we're just gonna let you take her back to your evil stronghold? Well, as they say in <i>México...</i> no... we're not gonna let you. She's psychotic, and I'm not turning her over to you. You don't have a choice. Check the view screen, Uhuru. I got 12 Vampyr Slayers behind me, and not one of them has ever dated you. She's coming with us, one way or another. You're way out of your league. I'll just clear this with Buffy. Where do you think my orders came from? News flash... nobody in our camp trusts you anymore. Nobody. You work for Wolfram and Hart. Don't fool yourself. We're not on the same side. Thank you for your help, but, uh, we got it. So that's it? Just gonna let him take her? [Angel] She's one of theirs. They can handle it. Besides, you heard the man. We got enough problems of our own to worry about. [Footsteps Approaching Slowly] Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, Doc? I'd give you the finger, but apparently... I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off. A lot of pain? More than I'd like. But not as much as you would. Just what I deserve. [Sighs] I didn't say that. No. I did. The lass thought I killed her family. And I'm supposed to, what, complain... 'cause hers wasn't one of the hundreds of families I did kill? I'm not saying you're right. 'Cause, uh, I'm physically incapable of saying that. But, uh... for a demon... I never did think that much about the nature of evil. No. Just threw myself in. Thought it was a party. I liked the rush. I liked the crunch. Never did look back at the victims. I couldn't take my eyes off them. I was only in it for the evil. That was everything to me. It was art... the destruction of a human being. Geez, I would've considered Dana a masterpiece. What happens to her? I don't know. Um, Andrew and the Slayers took her. Didn't trust us to help her. Andrew double-crossed us? That's a good move. [Chuckles] Hope for the little ponce yet. Though the tingling in my forearms tells me she's too far gone to help. She's one of us now. She's a monster. She's an innocent victim. So were we...
