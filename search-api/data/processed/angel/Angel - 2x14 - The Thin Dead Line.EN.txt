Oh! Dad, no. Daddy! Nice plan, Custer. You can't go in uninvited. You need us. It's not what I expected. Doesn't fit anymore? - You went too far. - We're all... - ...that's between you and darkness. - You're all fired. - For God's sake, help us. - People are going to die. I just can't seem to care. What I wouldn't give for a roving band of Prechian demons now. Without the ritualistic slayings, of course. Of course. Something to fight. Good to be done. A little action. We could buy a star map... ...find out where Steven Seagal lives. Think he got to be a star without demonic help? I say let things be quiet. Quiet may be good for mankind, but bad for business. - We need to make a name for ourselves. - We can't agree on one. Unless you came around to-- - Nope. - Give it up already. New name or not, we need to be out plying our trade. Generating word of mouth. We can't expect evil to walk through the door. - Can we help you? - I'm looking for Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. - I'm Wesley. - I'm Francine. My daughter, Stephanie. - I'm Virginia's friend from the club. - The country club. One of Virginia's rich friends? You certainly came to the right place. She says you specialize in the strange. The stranger the better, as far as we're concerned. Tell us the problem. Trust me, we specialize in strange. There's nothing we haven't see-- There's an eye in the back of her head. Something bit her after swim practice. When she woke up, that was there. Did you see who or what did this to you? It was dark. She doesn't remember. She's been in shock since then. I'll pay whatever it takes. Can you fix it? - Consider us already on it. - You came to the right place. - Who would do this? - We'll find out, but it'll take time. You'd be surprised how many nasty things are out these days. He's right behind us. - Oh, God. - We gotta move now. Pass these out, then get Eva to go into storage. I bought a lot of sleeping bags in case we got crowded. Open up. Please? Open up. - I know it's past curfew. Let us in. - 10:00. You know the rules. I know, but you can't leave us out here. There's something-- - We gotta come in. - We're full. - There's no more beds. - Please, we'll sleep on the floor. Anne, don't make us go back out there. - Hey, Merl. - Jesus. Can't you, you know, knock? You don't make that funny expression when I knock. - What are you doing? - Packing. - You're not going anywhere. - Yes, I am. As in far, as in now. Who's gonna tell me all the fun facts about my friends? Big meeting tomorrow, top-level Wolfram & Hart brass. I think it's a new demon account. 9:30, Diaghilev. That concludes my career as an informant. Consider it a freebie. - Just like everything I've given you. - 9:30? Tomorrow. Good luck. Hope you bust that evil law firm wide open. - Why the rush to relocate? - Well, let's see, there's...you. And every crook and monstro who thinks they can waltz in... ...and pound me for information. Without paying. At least that British guy understood what a working relationship was. Had some respect. You only care about yourself. - You're in no position to judge-- - How is old Wesley, huh? Or the other two you fired? They doing all right? Gee, let me guess. You never even bothered to check. - This had better pan out. - 9:30, at Diaghilev. Pleasure doing business with you. Make sure to get full names. No tags or nicknames. I don't want new kids to slip through the cracks. - I was getting a vibe. - Yeah? - See if she's interested. - Okay. - Let me know. - Kenny. Can we talk for a sec? How are you? It's been a while. Fine. Crashing different places. You know me and shelters. Too many rules. I need my freedom. - So why'd you come in last night? - It was cold out. - It was 65 degrees. - I'm from Florida. 65 degrees is like the Arctic Circle. Kenny. Why'd you come in? - Cops. - What? Cops. They've been hassling everybody. What else is new, right? But these guys.... - We were hanging down on 39th-- - Panhandling? No, washing my Mercedes. This cop comes and hits me so hard, I thought my teeth were coming out. He hit you? - What were you doing? - Nothing, I swear. After he punched me, he threw Les into a wall. Then he reached for his nightstick, so we ran. - He wasn't arresting you or-- - He just said, "No loitering"... ...slugged me in the mouth and chased us for a couple of blocks. - We got a big problem. - Good luck solving it. I mean, who you gonna call, the cops? I know someone who can help. Annie! What's up, girl? I ain't seen you in a minute. Come here. What brings you here? I wanted to see how the other half lives. Oddly, it's not that different. Come on. We like to think of it as Early-American Dilapidation. - Hi, I'm Cordelia. - Anne. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Nice to meet you. Anne runs a teen shelter on Crenshaw. - All this time and you still remember. - I get it. - I've been busy. - If you're not too busy... ...can I run something by you? Kenny's not the only one. The others all say the same thing. No provocation. No reason. The cops are terrorizing them. Renegade cops. Not exactly my usual. Oh, that's right. You used to hunt-- - It's cool. They know what's what. - What? I still hunt vampires, but I've learned there are worse things. Like overzealous cops beating on my kids. Speaking of which, I should really get back. The shelter gets jammed after sunset. I'll go with you. It's not safe to be alone. I'm going to the center to see what's up. And miss out on this exciting case? - Wesley's friend got bit by a demon. - Are they okay? - For the most part. - But she grew another eye in her head. That sounds...handy. What kind of demon does that? We're trying to figure that out. Then we'll de-oculate her. - Just the one in the back. - Ah, yes. Angel Investigations, home of the wicked, high-creep factor. - Angel? - Our company, after our former boss. - We're changing it to the Gunn Agency. - No, we're not. - Once these narcissists get some sense. - But, Angel, that-- Not the guy in the black trench coat? - You know him? - He tried to help me out a while ago. - He did? - Really? But it was just a scam to screw this law firm. Well, he hasn't changed a bit. Come on. - Thanks. - I got your back. - I ain't been here in forever. - It's been a while. - The cops are tripping, G. - Define "tripping." Out for blood. Les got busted up. The cops stopped me. He got his gun, looking to put a cap in my ass. It's outrageous. They're gonna kill someone. Could you give us a minute? I have some paperwork I could do. - You guys playing her? - No way. She's no fool but she has a blind spot. She wants to trust you. This ain't no scam. We're the victims. Right. So, what was you doing when the cop pulled his piece on you? - Nothing. - So I haven't seen you dealing on 5th? - You telling me it wasn't you? - It's history. I gave that up. Do the cops know that? It's not a street sweep the P.D. does every six months to shut up the moms. Okay? This is war. And everyone's a target. She speaks true, G. 100% true. Keep your hands where I can see them. Sorry, officer. Have I done something wrong? Turn around. Face the fence. Put your hands on your head. This is a mistake. - You're under arrest. - You don't want to do this. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Should you be unable to afford one, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand your rights as I... ...have.... Well, if it isn't Charles Gunn, brother-at-large. - Meet Rondell and George. - Hi. Greetings. I got the camcorder. What's up? A problem I promised we'd check. - This about cops cracking skulls? - You know about it? - Who doesn't? - I didn't. - Someone could've told me. - You weren't around. You been moving on up, playing demon detective with the new family. - "Deluxe apartment in the sky." - It's Christmas when you call. Maybe I shouldn't have called. You're free to go. - We made the trip. - Don't do me no favors. I'm not. The favor's for these kids. Now, you got a plan or don't you? It's simple. You roll the camera and wait for them to hassle us. - How do you know they will? - We'll be "walking while black." Come on. - Haven't seen you in a while. - Been busy. Yeah, me too. Couple of open cases I'm working. Two women killed in a clothing store. Lawyers from Wolfram & Hart slaughtered in a wine cellar. - A real tragedy. - You seem pretty broken up by it. - We're still looking into this one. - Good luck with that. - Didn't find your vampire pals in time. - I did set them on fire later. Sounds like you enjoyed it. But murder's always been up your alley. I guess this isn't the best time to tell you I just killed a cop. I wouldn't joke about that, even if you are immortal. Of course, this is a cop that keeps talking, even after decapitation. They don't teach that at the academy. Wanna tell me who it belonged to? That's him. - Officer Peter Harkes. - Know him? Well enough to be at his funeral six months ago. You wanna take a ride? Yes, we can handle the eye thing without you. That's not the point. Just that maybe we should back you up on this. Because I don't want you to get hurt. Of course I do, but-- Hello? - Gunn's about to do a stupid thing. - What did he say? To find out if cops have been brutalizing and killing people... ...he's gonna tape cops trying to brutalize and kill him. - You're joking. - Nothing says "I'm onto you"... - ...like getting a police beating. - You couldn't stop him? Hello! Gunn, stubborn: synonyms. That can't be his plan, can it? I mean, it's really a dumb plan. Gunn majored in Dumb Planning from Angel University. He sat at the feet of the master and learned well how to plan dumbly. - We're gonna have to let him do this. - I'm sure he'll be fine. - He wants help, he knows where we are. - We'll work our gig, Gunn has his. - Let's save him from himself. - The third eye's not going anywhere. That one. - He never saw who shot him. - Catch the killer? He's no genius. He's up for the death penalty. He died six months ago? - Around then. - The ground's been disturbed. - Someone's done some digging. - How do you know? A lot of cops buried here? Yeah. - How about him? - Kevin worked Vice. - What's going on? - Dead cops are back on the street. - What? How is that? - Zombies. Reanimated corpses that walk and talk. Somebody else pulls their strings. Is it--? My dad, is he...? No. - Ground's undisturbed. - You sure? I'm sure. You okay? Who's doing this? Give Emma a hand in the kitchen. - Sorry, no more-- What--? - Is Gunn here? No. He left a while ago. Why? - Where was he going? - 45th Street. - I'll start there. I have my phone. - Check in with me! - Right. - Looks like you could use some help. My staff's too scared to come in. - Where shall I start? - How are your laundry-folding skills? I'm an actress. I can fake it. Hey! That's my-- Sorry. I have a shirt just like that. The girl at the store said it was a one of a kind. Big fibber. I'm all out of beds. Come on, it's not safe for man or beast out here. I'm very sorry. But I really don't have any free beds. You don't have to worry about me. I can find someone willing to share. Oh, yes. Plenty of candidates. - I think it'd be best if you left. - You should probably go. This is a shelter, right? It just so happens, I'm in need of shelter tonight. Hey! Hey! Let him go. I don't want any trouble. See y'all later. Whoa! Watch out, man. - Jackson. - Lookie here. You been ducking me lately, Ray? - No? You think I'm pissed at you? - I don't know. You're shaking, Ray. What you got to be nervous about? You don't think I'm gonna kill you, do you? - Huh? - No. I'd never kill you here. Not in front of all the pretty ladies. You know I'd never kill you here. I'll set up so they don't see it... - ...or we can't Rodney King the cops. - That's if we find any. - Never had to look so hard for trouble. - Look, 45th Street. - So? - This is gang ground. They catch us, they'll take us out. - Even cops don't come here. - I said you're free to go. I say I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna do it. Damn. Somebody have an apocalypse and forget to invite us? - What are you doing? - Doing? Nothing. Taking a walk. Hands on the wall, spread your feet. You're arresting us? - Do as you're instructed. - I wanna know if we're being arrested. - Turn around, face the wall. Now. - I ain't arguing with you... ...but I'd like to know what law we broke. We should know if we broke one so we don't repeat it. I won't say it again. Officer, wait! He's a friend of mine. A very good friend. I'm sure he hasn't committed any-- Wesley! He's got another gun! Oh, man! Oh, man! - Let's get out of here. - Get Wesley. - Is anyone else cold? - We'll take you someplace warm. Help me pick him up! Come on! Come on! I shot him. I shot a cop. - Not much choice. - We gotta move! I killed a policeman. Look, he's dead! - Don't look that dead. - Let's go! - We have a situation. - Any loose ends? We have witnesses. I need backup. Hold up. I gotta try to stop his bleeding. Go! Around here. Let him down. Easy! Take it easy! 911, you've got to call 911. - Screw the cops. They did this to you. - An ambulance. Oh. - All right, go down and keep watch. - Okay. - Tell them no sirens. - 911,what is your emergency? It's pretty quiet in here. Can I help you? I'm investigating complaints about how officers handle things here. Isn't that for Internal Affairs? I'm taking a personal interest. - Where is everyone? - Only a few of us at the desk tonight. Not a lot going on? Crime's down in this precinct. We do things right. - Who takes credit for that? - It's a team effort. But the captain got the ball rolling. - Can we talk to him? - He's not here. You can try again later. This captain, is he running things by the book? I don't have to tell you who used to rule the streets. The scumbags did. Hell, I was afraid to drive to work myself. Oh, really? We got a tougher policy. - Ambulance ain't coming. - Shut up before they hear you. - I'm not doing very well. - You'll be fine. Getting shot like this? I seen people shot worse than this, never even slowed them down. It's here! Come on, hurry. Move! Okay, one, two, three. - Meet me at the shelter. - All right. Hey, I'm with him. It's all right. We're almost there. Something's going on here. I'll go see what it is. Hey, let us through. No! Don't! Hey! Hang on! Stopping? What are you doing? Trying to survive. Help me get him inside. Come on, Wes. - Here, take this. - Come on, man, I got you. Annie, open up! It's G! Open up! Hurry! - My God, what happened? - They shot him. - Who? - The cops. They're not human. All passengers are onboard. - We have full containment, - Wait for backup. Secure the entire section. Clean house. He had no right. I know, man. Wesley. - What can I do? - Apply pressure to the wound. Okay. Good. Hang in there. It's okay. - Are we safe? - Lock all the doors. Keep away from the windows! You heard him. Let's go, come on! Damn, that looks nasty. Jackson? What are you doing? How do we keep the cops out? I say let them come, bro. I know how to handle cops. That lifestyle working for you? - Don't get all high and mighty. - You don't bring down the community. I'm just doing my thing. Why does nobody care they're clamping down on this neighborhood? - Because they're racist pigs. - That and people like you. A thug with a gun, keeping the cycle going. - Not my problem. - It's my problem! They shot my friend! Yeah, a white man dying. Not exactly losing sleep on him. Hey, we can't afford this. Not now! - All units in place, - Go. And keep it quiet, No gunfire, - He's going south. - No, come on. What? There's internal bleeding. We gotta get him to St. John's, fast. - We can't go back out there. - He's going to die. We're taking him to a hospital now! I don't care who's out there! Get the door. - Where are we going? - Hospital. That sounds sensible. They're here. Use this bat. Everything against the windows. Move! Quick! Okay, nail this shut. Check the kitchen door. Can I help you? - What are you doing? - Looking around. - Who are you? - Angel. Well, Angel, if you need something, someone downstairs will help you. I need to talk to you. - About what? - About some of your more... ...dead cops. Maybe we should talk about you instead. How do I stop them? I'll repeat the question. Move, people! All circuits are busy, Please try again, This is no time for circuits busy! If the circuits are busy, get new ones now! Push them up. - How do I stop them? - They're good cops. They died on the streets! - You should've left them. - I won't betray them! Okay, let's go! Get the kids in the back, upstairs! Gunn! Gunn! Help! - Get out. - How are you controlling them? The entrails? The door, it's giving! Run! It's the idol of Granath, the zombie god. No! The kids. Wesley! Get the ambulance ready. Help me pick him up. Sorry. Looks like the streets just got safer for me. Time to go to work. Let's go. Come on, sweetie. - Here we go. - Okay. I took care of our little cop problem. Crime reports from that precinct. There used to be a murder every two weeks... ...a rape every two days, a robbery every hour. That's what we gave back to the community. I can live with that. You learn to live with a lot. This job is making me crazy. I know the feeling. For you, detective. Thanks. Wyndam-Pryce. Doesn't he work for you? Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? I feel I should be in pain. A gunshot will do that to you. And yet.... Is this morphine? Well, it's bloody lovely. What are you doing here? I heard about Wesley. Great. Too bad it takes a gunshot wound to make you give a crap. Wesley doesn't need you right now. We don't need you.
