Synch : Gaillots. He's much improved... Shaun. He's well. I had Zippy kiss him. Thought I'd take a shot. Hi, Shaun. My name's Dr. Smith. You got hurt a few hours ago surfing. I'm gonna ask you to do a few things for me, okay? If you understand me, you just blink once for yes and twice for no. Do you understand me? Okay. - I'm going in there. - No. You're not. Well, if he doesn't come out in a couple of minutes, I'm going back in there... Pretty quick. She's got some voice on her, this girl. Played the girl in "the phantom of the opera. " I had tickets twice... To see the show. Oh, yeah. Here's some blood-drinking Vampire cocksucker On sale for half a ham sandwich. Oh, God, hail Christ. Pray for yourself you don't see this man, you fucking vampire reptiles, 'cause I will cut you into 50 fucking pieces before you get your first question out. Well, you seem perfectly fine to me, Shaun. I know that tube is uncomfortable for you. I'm gonna go outside and tell your family how you're doing. Then I'll come back in and I'll take that out for you, okay? Okay. Good. Shaun has recovered. Once I get the tube out of his throat, I'll come back out and we should talk. - We can't come in now? - Not till the tube's out. It can be uncomfortable for relatives to watch. You're gonna pay for that, pal. Bird shit in my pocket. I took a dump. Zippy kissed him. Shaun's much improved and well. Bill thought he'd give it a shot. Shit in bill's pocket. No no, I got my eye on you. The end is near. I know. You told me. I'd like to bone you, Kai. You are one smooth-talking city dude. Oh, who's this now? Shit. Do you mind? There's reporters around the corner. I'm just working up to making a break for the parking garage. Can I ask how your grandson's doing? He's gonna die. And my wife doesn't want me up there. I got to leave her the car. I can give you a ride if you want. I'll bring my car around. We can go out the other way. That's where the blind dago's supposed to come in. What is this a different version? When I examined Shaun on admission, His neck was broken. His spinal cord was severed and there was no brain function. Your grandson had passed away by every meaningful measure, But now... He has come alive. Showing no sign of any of those injuries. How badly damaged is his brain? He's... he's fully responsive. And the monitor is showing normal electrical activity. Everything that should move, does. I don't think his brain is damaged at all. How long is he gonna have to stay in here? This is a very important And delicate part of this conversation. No hospital is equipped to deal with what happened to your grandson. If he stays, what'll happen to him here is in the hospital's interest and will be of no benefit to him. So you're saying we should take him home? As a physician, I can't say that to you. What's the word, Kurd? Hey, dad. Here's this fucking idiot. Are you gonna get in the fucking car? Well, I didn't know if you saw me 'cause I didn't want to frighten you. Are you gonna get in? How you doin'? How was the flight, good? Give me your hand. Oh! Oh, that's broken! Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I'm half-thinking I'm gonna need a reason to find out what's going on in there. Take you in as an injured friend. - Absolutely. - I take you in, you need attention, I'm in there on the ear about the kid. Right. Who's that? Look. - Oh, sh... what's that? - Oh, shit. Oh, christ! Get out! Scare the snakes off! - Go ahead! - Where's the snakes? The reporters! Scare the fucking reporters over there! - Where? - Over there. Over there! Hey, I've been attacked! I'm injured! Look what's happened to me! Help me, please! Please! Who's a doctor? Are you a doctor? Look at me! No, no! Over there! Over there! There's one over there. Please help me. It's broken! I've been attacked. I'm injured! I broke my wrist! I broke my wrist! I knew it was fucking wrong. Letting him compete. I'm sure it's what he wanted. Well, the mistake is not him wanting it. The mistake is me letting him. Sometimes, I think... You have to let people follow their heart. And that whole heat... Every ride... It was beautiful to see. What was beautiful? Watching him milk a closed-out section to impress a bunch of fucking judges? That's not surfing. Yes? Oh, hi, yeah. I'm glad you called. Can you tell the lab that the film looks good? - Are you with him? - Yeah. I don't know what's going on, but the whole family just left here with Shaun And it looked to me like his eyes were open. He was moving his arms. No, I... I don't know about that reel. Has anybody called Mitch? No, but probably they will soon. Well, just play it out. You do any good with him? Yeah, I like the way the film looked when I saw it. Yeah, well, smart girl. You know, that's flapping your fins for an audience. That's letting dipshits define you by a number. So other dipshits can compare you with other numbers so the other dipshits. It's know who to pay to wear their sunglasses So the dipshits in the malls know which ones to buy. I just... I shouldn't have let him go out. And... What I'm doing here... Instead of being at the hospital... For me and for her. But I suppose that's... What it's come to, between my wife and myself. Would you like to walk? I'm a friend of the Yosts. And, um... Can you tell me anything about Shaun? His eyes were open. Looked to me like he was moving his arm. - Can you tell me anything about that? - No. You're probably not allowed to talk to anyone Who's not part of the family? This is a restricted area, sir. Thank you. Thank you for the work you do. When my brother-in-law got shot one time... Nobody felt like cooking. One wonders, Ramon, why that comes to mind. When the Yosts get home, they'll be sad. They'll have no food. Should we take them a nourishing pot-luck dinner? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Something which can be heated easily and served without fuss. May I be your wheelman once I've seen to room 24? Only to close the door I left open As I fled. Or you could leave closing the door till tomorrow. I intend no confrontation with what I saw within, only to mark the boundary between us. Didn't the poet say, "good fences make good neighbors"? No skipping. - Animate or inanimate? - Inanimate. Inanimate. Do you hear the dead man singing within, gentlemen? I'm half-deaf from the leaf blower. No, attorney dickstein? Surfer's ear... exostosis of the ear canal. I alone then am... Favored by that jovially croaking Post-coital falsetto. Winsomely caricaturing debbie boone. Maybe we could get him some pea soup. Dark knee socks. You're suggesting we go to a pea soup restaurant, am I correct, Ramon? Now that the door is properly closed. Yeah. Come. - Come. - We'll take mine. Yeah. I won, dad. Good job. Can't I get out of bed? It's a three-ring circus out there now, Shaunie. If you get out of bed, we'll be up to five. What a stupid fuck you are. Almost got this put on. Explain to me the difference between you and a monkey in a tree. Yeah. I don't know. Would it distract you if I asked you a question? I called you yesterday, Butchie wanted to buy an ounce. Don't give him no dope, sell him shit, right? Could you explain your thinking, If you think I could fathom it? He's got some insurance, settlement, Butchie. Thinks he'll deal instead of just use. What he's gonna do is o. D. And die. Long term, we lose a client. All the weight I move, you think Butchie's two dime-bags a day means anything to me? No, absolutely not. Moron. So, our angle... Is what? - No, I'm asking. - I don't know. Not why I told you not to sell to him. Not what I flew out here for... To see shape changers in a rearview mirror. - You see 'em now, you see 'em? - Shut up. Yeah, I go weeks on end not knowing what I'm up to. Believe me, it's gonna be a zoo out here For that family to deal with. And you're too fucking ignorant to realize it. God, what a fracture. When I was a kid, there were still some of those old-timers down here in those driftwood shacks. Dempsey holder. You know your history. Well, like I said... You like vintage. Well, you love a thing, you want to pass it on, or... You have. Have you met my son? Now, Shaun... You should also know, you've had an effect On a lot of people. You know, who you are. Come to my hotel. Straight to fucking voicemail. Well, if dad's surfing, he's not gonna have his phone on him. I'm not a family spokesman, I'm a retired police officer. Let's give the yost family a little privacy... What's that, Bill? Gawkers, press, candle fanatics. We're on the precipice of a clusterfuck. I'm thinking I'll go out and thin it out. - I'd appreciate it. - Happy to do it. Come on, Zip. Why don't you press yourself up against the door and make it impossible to do what she's asked me to do? Jesus christ almighty. John wanted to go look at some boards at the shop. I'm gonna bone Kai, Butchie. I may have to break her jaw first. No floor boning, we'll just clear off a couch. Make her see god, John. I'm gonna try hard enough. Yeah, we'll go out back. We can jump the fence. Where is that guy from? Cincinnati. Shaunie won. Maybe I should leave your dad another message. I went off on him. Yeah? When it looked like Shaunie was gonna die. I bet dad held his end up. Last few days have been a little strange. I'm not confusing you two with the huxtables. Is that freddy out there? Yeah. Why am I surprised he's not in hawaii? 'cause he flew out to beat my balls off. I don't want any trouble here, Butchie. We're all right. I mean, he drove me to the hospital. He's not surfing. His boards are in the garage. I mean, if you go up in the air like he did. It has to fuck with your head a little. - Who, freddy? - No. I don't know. Go tell Shaunie I'll... I'll be in in a minute. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. Sure. Excuse me. I have to ask you your business with the Yosts. My business is none of your business. I believe I just made it my business. - What is your name, please? - What's your name? Bill Jacks. I'm a retired police officer. And you don't want to make me ask your name again. Retired cops don't get my name, What time it is, or pissed on if they go up in flames. Well, that would be a mistake by you pertaining to me. Then go up in flames. I'll piss on ya. 'cause I will kick your ass, retired or not. I'm a friend of the family, all right? I'm a friend of the family. Then they got two friends looking out for them. And you look out for them how? By seeing when their backs are turned so you can steal their drapes? I've flown a long distance on my own dime To look out for these people. I don't have to fly because I live nearby. Well, pin a rose on your donkey nose. Being you won't tell me your real name, Here's a made up one: Do not impede me looking out for these people, Dipshit-who-looks- like-someone-smashed- his-face-in-with-a-board. Susan, make your own decision about those exposures and we'll go over 'em at the lab. This is bullshit. Get him over here. Really? Yes, really. They brought him home. - I may take a ride over there. - Well, make it fast. I'm standing around like a fucking wannabe. It's the girl who called earlier. Susan. She's been following the story. They've taken Shaun home. Turn around. Maybe you want to find yourself a board, John. People take hours with that. Could be our full date. Where do we bone, Kai? If we were gonna bone, my trailer's out back. What does "bone" mean, John? I don't know, Butchie instead. Touch my tits. Tits don't ring a bell. - Are we gonna bone? - We're going to my trailer. Boning doesn't necessarily ring a bell. I'm not tired. Okay, you know, you can read them mags. No need to stay in bed. Why does Gram want me to? Well, she saw you get hurt. - I'm okay now. - You were hurt. You remember anything, You know, after you wiped out? You got fucking done, man. Owned hard. You know, Gram... And Gramps too, they thought you weren't gonna make it. A lot of people. I woke up, I had a tube in. Yeah. One time I put icy hot in the crotch of this guy's wetsuit. And Bill was there. And Zippy. And then you got better. But before that, they didn't think you could. Zippy was dead the day before yesterday. You thought he was dead. Can I go out on the half-pipe? Your Grams is out there smoking a cigarette. She's always worried. Now you understand... you go out there, You can't just hug her and say "I'm okay, Grams" and start to boogie. I let you go out there, you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but you have to let Grams do what she has to do. - Cool? - Thanks, dad. You know, because something really did happen to you, Shaunie. Don't go to the front of the house. There's a lot of people out there. - Okay. - They heard something happened. They're just curious, that's all. Okay. Yo, dad, call mom for christ's sake. All right? It's not what you think. Just call her. Hi, Gram. What are you doing?! Dad said, you know, I could ride a little while. - Did he? - And not to go out front. So dad was full of instructions. Did he tell you to break your neck for the second time today? Gram, I feel like a dork in there laying around.</i> Well, isn't that too goddamn bad? You listen to me! Don't listen to that fucking idiot! You stay in here till you hear me say you can leave!</i> Did you build that half-pipe? No, ma, you did. And what you did is blow smoke in the phone! "yeah, ma! I'll be right there, ma! Sorry I couldn't help, ma!" I didn't even tell Shaun you were gonna come help! 'cause I knew what the odds were! "where's my dad, Gram? Where's my dad?" Now you want him to break his neck. We're bonin' now, aren't we? Now we're boning, Kai. Boning, John, Is when you put your joint in my pussy. That's your joint. Here's my pussy. Now we're boning. Has anyone ever called you slow, John? Challenged? I don't know, Butchie instead. You know, if we did bone... I'd feel like I was getting over on a hot slow guy. See god, Kai. Motherfucker! Fuck! Did you slip me a roofy? - I slipped you a roofy. - Shut up, John. - You don't know what you talkin' about. - I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm so dizzy. My piercings feel like they're in a furnace. They were in a furnace. Shut up! Don't do that to me again, John. Never. You fucking hear me? See god, Kai. If that's what it's like, I don't want to. That's what it's like. Thanks. Where's the girl in the porsche? Yeah, where'd she get to? What you do, celebrate your birthday over there? Busy winchell's. It's burnt. Burnt. It rains, it pours. Why did she bring him home? He recovered from his injuries. - What are you talking about? - A miracle? What are you gonna say? Tell him that the bird kissed him? Zippy, Jesus Christ almighty. Mr. Yost, can I have a second of your time, please? Forget it, forget it. - It's a simple question. - Only a few seconds! Why don't you pick that cigarette of yours off my driveway and swallow it? Obviously an exhausted and very relieved...</i> There's another fucking drug casualty. I'm so happy about Shaun. Do you notice? I'm smoking in here. If we'd done things my way at the hospital... He wouldn't be alive. I looked for you when we were leaving. Yeah, I had the phone off. Just coming to terms with how it seemed like it was gonna be for Shaunie. Maybe if I ask if you had the phone off, you'll tell me where you went. I walked away, Cissy. I... you know, I'm not trying to turn away from that. You know, and I'll... Take whatever time I have to... To live into what that means. I'm... I'm also not gonna deny... The things you said to me in that room. You know, it's gonna take some time living into those, too. You want to see Shaun? He's in his room? Over there. What you said to me in the hospital shamed me, Cissy. And it made me recognize how my shortcomings. Have hurt you. And I mean, that's... That's on me to deal with. But I'd just as soon... Shaunie not see me right now this fucked up. Not being as bright as you, Mitch, So full of the wisdom of the east, Sounds like you're saying what's right for you Is to do whatever you fucking want. - Oh, Cissy... - Which isn't exactly fresh news. Anyways, we're a little busy here. Go do your heavy thinking. Whoever drove you from the hospital. Can give you a lift. Which is another way of saying... Yeah, we do need time apart. I'm going. There's a mob outside. I'll go over the back fence. Everyone better get used to that. Maybe not you, Mitch. Doc! Physician? Can we ask a couple questions about the Yosts? Just one question. Is that the bay, or the ocean itself? Yeah, you smell the smoke. I usually do it outside. So how is Shaun? Breaking my balls to let him skate. Well, I take that as a good sign. What do you want? - Sorry. - No... It's a good question. Are you here to examine him? It's important to me not to misrepresent myself, Miss. Yost. I'm confident the diagnosis of Shaun's condition That I gave you and your husband in that waiting room was correct. Shaun's x-rays showed catastrophic spinal injury. His E. E.G... the test that measures brainwaves, Was essentially a flatline. Now, people don't survive those injuries as vegetables, Let alone recover fully. Yet I don't doubt if you let me examine Shaun, I'll confirm that he has recovered. Which brings us face to face with possibilities that, I've been taught deserve no more than a friendly pat on the head. Which brings me there... here... Watching a stranger tie himself in knots is... Probably not your idea of fun just now. But... Room's in back. Thank you. You know, I smoke sometimes... A couple a day. Dad? Hey. Fuck. It's some mess out front, huh? Yeah, and now I got a nail right in the back of my knee. Well, you're hanging there like a side of beef. Oh no no no, god! Don't, don't! Get away! I don't want to tear the artery. - We gotta get you off there, dad. - Just wait. Wait. Just... fuck! - Now come on, here we go... - Okay, you know what? Put your... put your thumb above it just to stop the circulation. Just shut up, dad! God damn it! Just to stop it from spurting! Oh, what a fountain? - Oh, fuck, is it spurting? - No, I'm fucking with you. You're off the hook, dad. I guess you heard about Shaun. Yeah, that was... something, huh? Here, come on. Let's go clean it up in your fort. Where are you going? Thanks. - Now? - Yeah. Good. Now bring your fingers toward your face and touch the tip of your nose. This sucks. Okay. You can open your eyes. I want you to push down on my thumb with your chin as hard as you can. Hard. Good. Done. We're all done. Very good. So, was I dead or something? You... you looked pretty banged up when they brought you in, Shaun. But obviously you're fine. If I had any doubts, I'd restrict your activities. Did you think I was gonna die? No, sir. No, I did not. Well, I'm sure glad I got the chance to be your doctor. Thanks for taking care of me. Sure. That's my dad. - Hey, dad. - Hey. I was just out here rippin' a few. - I'll see you, Shaun. - Can I skate? Whatever's okay with your grandmother. See ya. - What'd the doctor say? - He wouldn't restrict my activity. Did he leave? He's out back with my dad. When did your dad get back? I guess he came over the fence. I was a jerk before to your dad. I'm sorry I scared you... Getting hurt. I guess the doctor meant you could skate. He said you had to say it was okay. It's okay. I mean, maybe wait till your dad's done talking to the doctor. Okay. Because he was scared too, your dad. Okay. Thanks, Gram. Okay. You find a place to light, would you, doc? I'm having a problem with my implants, doc. Implants? It's palaka the ice-cream man. - You know me? - No. No? 'cause I know your father. Yeah. Listen, that guy... that guy in the back, Is that the guy I saw coming in? How do I know who you saw coming in? You make a good point. Anyway, he's a doctor? He identified himself as a doctor to get past the heat. - Yeah, he's a doctor. - Yeah? Good. Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. Thanks, dude. You know steady freddy? I do delivery work for him. - I thought he was in hawaii. - No, he... he's here. He broke my wrist. That's why... 'cause, you know... Anyway, I'm glad you're better. Yo, cool. Hey, I was... you know, we were in the parking lot when you booked. I was the guy who stood off the reporters. I mean, never mind. Don't worry about it, I got you covered. Yeah, I passed out. They got that fucking hot. But that's not the first place you'd think of for implants. Well, it was sort of a "fuck you, Who gives a fuck?" you know? 35 fucking old-schoolers write to a magazine. Butchie Yost and his fucking aerials! Stink finger to the entire fucking sport! Good, douche bags. If I'm such a bad guy, deal with these. Sensations of burning like you felt with your implants. Can be caused by I.V. Drug use. What's drug use got to do with the price of eggs? You've got a phlebitis which should be looked at... Where you shoot up. If it breaks off, That clot can go places in your body that you'd prefer it didn't. You should be a doctor. It's also possible that what you felt had nothing to do with paresthesias. Whatever that means, doc, I'm busted for being a dope fiend. Why would that make you ineligible for a paranormal experience? And as Shaun's father, Maybe your eligibility's enhanced. - You met my old man, right? - Mitch, yeah. Up in the air yesterday. I saw it with my own eyes. Off the fucking ground. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a connection. Listen to this, doc: a guy shows up at my door. He creates money in his pants. Plastic. A platinum fucking credit card with an unspecified upper credit authority. His cell phone... Unlimited calling minutes? You know, plus as far as getting high, The last couple days have been One fucking interruption after another. You know, I should be on the floor dope-sick and I don't feel that bad. What's the matter? I am so happy. You take care. Go ahead, Shaun. Go on out on the half-pipe! But we're bringing them some nutritious soup. I don't care if you're bringing a sikorsky helicopter. Saw plenty of them, didn't we? We can't let you in. We let you in, we gotta let 'em all in. You need a smack? No, I don't need a smack. I got my eye on you. That's that shape changer.
