Before you were born, your mom and I sold your soul to the Devil. - You going to tell Andi? - I'm not going to tell Andi. If she knows, she'll never go out with me. You can make her go out with you. You're just going to bring escaped souls back to hell. That's cool, right? - But how am I supposed to capture them? - This will help... A vessel hand-crafted in the bowels of perdition</i> by the iniquitous and the vile. - That will work. - Word of caution... I don't accept failure. You finally found the one thing that you're good at.</i> You sent an escaped soul back to hell. Cady. Hey, it's me. Um, I haven't talked to you since you left. I hope everything's OK. Give me a call when you get this. All right. Bye-bye. Are we really going to discuss this? I mean, seriously, Benji, we are living next door to 2 demons. Demons. All right. As cuddly and cute as they are, I cannot live in the same building with 2 cat-eating, horny freaks, all right? - We're moving out asap. - Moving out where? Your mom doesn't want you living in the house anymore, and I don't have another place lined up. What about you, Sam? Look, I'm the last person who wants to live next to demons. - Thank you. - But we signed a lease on this condo. We break it, we don't get our deposit back. Money. Money, schmoney. Come on. If I had been worried about money my whole life, where do you think I'd be? You'd not be broke, right? They do do our laundry, though. I love when my boxers smell like lemongrass. And that beer tasting party on saturday? That may have been the best night of my life. They definitely amped up our style. Dude, check this sweater out that they got me for my birthday. - What? - When was your birthday? Monday. We totally spaced. - Why didn't you say anything, dude? - It's fine. Steve and Tony took me out to this awesome bar called George Ultra Lounge. Dude, that's a gay bar. Oh. Yeah. That explains a lot. OK. Look, we're getting off topic here. Steve and Tony smell terrific, and yes, they have great taste in beer, but they are demons. Let's just try to avoid them. You know, let's just chill out this relationship, put a little separation between us. - All right. Fine. Whatever. What, it takes 3 of you ladies to get a stain out of my chair? It does if you want it done right, which is the only way we know how to do it. You no likey? Get out on the floor right now, you nimrods. You're done in here. Let's go. Here you go. She's ready. Nimrods? That's a good one. Hello. Good job, sir. Good job. Got Ted with the old slip and slide, huh? Hey, Sam, can I borrow you a second? So. So, what's up? I just wanted to apologize for what I said about Cady the other day, for being weird. - I was totally out of line. - No, no. It's OK. She's... She's visiting her mom in New Mexico. We're trying to work stuff out. Oh. OK. Good. And I know you're just trying to be a good friend. That's the thing, Sam. I wasn't trying to be a good friend. Actually, I wasn't even being a friend to you at all. What do you mean? I tried to deny it in the beginning because I really... I don't want to ruin this friendship. And... god. It's kind of embarrassing, because it... It took me seeing you with Cady for me to realize the truth, and... the thing is that I see you as more than a friend. I like you. I like you. I don't know what to say. There's nothing to say. I'm sorry. You know what? I just really needed to get that off my chest. That's all. It's nothing. What? Season 1, Episode 13 - Acid Queen For www.forom.com This is the third text from Steve and Tony. - Maybe I should write back. - No. Absolutely not. Stay strong, OK? Yeah, but I miss Steve and Tony. I mean, they're like our cool, fun uncles. Benji, have you ever had a cool, fun uncle? Uncle Hector. Uncles are creepy by definition, OK? Have you not been watching your S.V.U.? Where you been? I was driving around a bit. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - He misses Cady. - Oh, is that it? You miss your girlfriend, Sam? It's cool to admit it, you know. Real men share their feelings, OK? That's what Tony says. Actually, Andi... Not it. Not it. - Damn it. - Yes. Go get the door. - Guys, guys. - Yeah? It's Steve and Tony. We... Hey, guys, what's up! Hey. We were in the neighborhood. We thought we'd stop by, say bonjour. - Bonjour! - French. Is now a bad time? Is it a... what time is it? Oh, it's... phew! We made some apricot... Very good muffins. You boys might like them. They're delicious and nutritious. - Hot stuff coming through. - Come in. So. Haven't seen you guys around in a while. Something wrong? - Wrong? - What would be wrong? You've ignored my texts. You avoided me in the parking lot, Sam. We were supposed to do some yoga the other day, but I wound up doing downward-facing dog all by myself. All right. All right. I forgot. I guess we're just a little confused because we thought we're having a great time, things are going well. And what happened? - Is it something we did? - Something we said? No. No. You're right. You're right. Look. Uh... this is tough for all of us, OK? But you 2 deserve to hear this in person, I think. Right now, right here... From Sam. Tell them. Look. Steve, Tony... - You guys are great guys. - Thank you, Sam. It's just we're... We're just going through some things right now. Wacko. We just thought it would be best if, for right now, if we didn't hang out as much. - Are you dumping us? - And it's not you. - It's us. - Oh, man. It's us. I mean, we need time for ourselves, space, to think about things. That was a mistake. God. What are we doing? We shouldn't have done this in person. We should have done this over the phone or text messaging, - something less personal and brave. - You know what? We're leaving. Before we do something... that we regret. - Sam. - Like what? Come on, Steven. - Those muffins look good. - Sorry. Oh, man. I'm going to barf. Something we'll regret? What the hell does that mean? That means we're about this close to becoming demon dinner. Hey, you guys want a Sock, Sam, and Ben muffin? They're delicious and nutritious. We really got to find a new place. I think I heard Steve crying through the wall last night. No. No, you didn't. That was Tony. He's got that weird nasally, quivery Streisand thing he does when he's upset. But they are demons, all right? I've got to stay strong on this one. I'm not going to break. - It's hard, man. - Sammy, would you please do something? Poop! What are you doing? Sorry, man. I'm just... I'm distracted right now. - Clearly. - What, about the demons? - No. With Andi. - Great. Here we go. Andi. Andi told me she likes me. - What did you just say? - Yeah, I know. Please tell me you professed your undying love for her. I can't do that. I have a girlfriend. God! You and Cady are on a break, Sam. Yeah, something that she suggested. Isn't this kind of what you always wanted, Sam? - Yeah. Yeah. - OK, then. Come on. You've been dying to get with Andi since the beginning of time. I say you got to go for it. What, and just break up with Cady? Doesn't that make me look like a jerk? You're better off breaking up with Cady and getting together with Andi than staying with Cady and secretly pining for Andi. You sound like a 12-year-old girl right now. Well, pardon me for being in touch with my feelings, Sam. OK? But you could take a lesson from me. Hey, Andi. Need help with this? Yeah, thank you. - Thank you. - All right. - Hey, um, about the other day... - I feel like an idiot, Sam. I really should have never put you in that position. I know you're with Cady, and I know that the timing sucks, and I just shouldn't have put it out there like that. But I did, and I know I can't take it back. - And I'm just really sorry. - Oh, no, no. Don't be sorry. You just... you surprised me. Yeah. I get it. I finish this up for me, please? - Yeah. - Thanks. Bubbles? That's so lame. Say, "cheese." Serious question for you. Are you a boob man, ass man, leg man? - What's your preference? - I'm not having this conversation. I've always been more of a leg man myself. - Would you stop it? - Come on. What's a little locker room talk between friends? We're not friends. Look at this sea of beautiful fish. Who wouldn't want to play the field? All right. Let's get on with this. What's behind the curtain? I thought you'd never ask, Dorothy. Hold onto your ruby slippers. - Oh, my god. - Nasty, huh? - She's burned. - She was, yes. With acid. Damn shame, too. She was one of the beautiful people, spent years perfecting that size zero physique. Now, who cares about the body when you got a face like that? - So, the soul did that? - Gold star, Sam. All those lovely scars are courtesy of Miss Nicole Manders herself. But why? Well, what else could invoke so much wrath in the female species? Jealousy, Sam. Our little scarred model there beat out Miss Micole for a very lucrative fashion campaign. Narcissism. One of my favorite virtues. Hey, guys. I'm going to take the stairs. The stairs. Yeah. I'm driving as fast as I can. Thanks, guys, leave me to take the heat. Are they gone yet? Yes. They're gone. Can one of you guys explain to me how to make my heart explode so I never have to feel this pain again? The Devil gave me the name of a soul... Nicole Manders, nicknamed Nikki. What are the odds a narcissistic soul changes her appearance - when she comes back from hell? - Not likely. As cosmo says, you find a look for yourself and you stick with it. Oh, my god. She's hot, especially for a dead chick. Says here she was jackknifed in prison 2 years ago. So much for miss congeniality. She plead guilty to attacking her younger, hotter sister with acid. So, what, we're dealing with a hot soul who's going around killing even hotter women? Is it wrong that I'm aroused and disgusted at the same time? Probably, but you shouldn't beat yourself up over it. Thanks, Benji. It says here that Nikki used to work at Seattle style. What the hell is that? You're a real culture vulture, aren't you? Seattle style. It's only Seattle's hippest up-and-coming fashion magazine du jour. What? I read fashion magazines on the toilet. It's a thing that I do. Lay off! Maybe I should be reading Seattle style, too, huh, Sock? We got to find somebody we can relate to. You know, someone on our level. I know a brother when I see one. Come on. That's good for me, too. Kendell, thanks, man. Thanks for talking with us. Hey, no problem. Anything that gets me away from my desk for 5 minutes ain't all bad. Working at this job with all these hot chicks around here? - This job's awesome. - This is a dream job! I like this kid. Kendell, have you ever seen this girl? That's Nikki, Nikki Manders. Hot as hell, isn't she? Total nut job, though. She actually got into a fight here with another girl a couple of years back. - Management fired her ass. - Who'd she get in a fight with? Angela. Who's Angela? She's here. - That's Angela. - Hello. Her and... Please, please don't touch her. - I just... - Yeah. Actually, her and Nikki were competing in this in-house modeling competition. The winner got a phat 2-year modeling contract. Let me guess... Angela won and Nikki freaked out? Security literally had to escort Nikki from the building. - That's hot. - Is Angela around? - You think we could maybe talk with her? - No. She's not in today. She writes this column for our magazine called "It girl." You know the column "It girl"? Anyway, she prefers to write back here at night. She says that she likes the quiet. I think Angela might be the next "It girl," if you know what I'm talking about. She's such a party girl. She loves this place called the crush lounge. She goes there every ladies' night. All right. Bathroom's all clear. No sign of her on the dance floor. She must have left. - No, hey, guys. - Ladies. High fashion model? Guarantee you she's hanging out right in there. Is that vip or something? Guys, guys. Angela's in there. Look. Son of a bitch. We have to get past that bouncer. I know. I'm on this. Check it out. All right, look, sir. My tight, toned, well-defined man mountain. How would you like a little finsky for all your troubles, - if you know what I'm saying? - What is he doing? Not... enough. OK. All right. OK. He shoved me. That's assault. That's Nikki right there. That's Nikki right there. Damn it, I'm tired of dancing with this guy. It is go time, Sam. - We've got to get you in there asap. - You think you can take him? No. Absolutely not. We can hold him down long enough to get you in there for sure. - Let's do it. We can do it. - Just one thing. One thing. Listen. My bail money is in my mom's dresser, second drawer to the right. - Right. Right. - OK. Let's go, Benji. Coming at you! - I got him! I got him! - Benji, he's like a bull! I got him! I got him! Hey, Angela, come here. I want you to meet someone. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Cady, hey. It's me again. Give me a call back when you get this. I really need to talk to you. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye. If it isn't our lovely ex-friend Sam. - Hello, Sam. - Hey. Didn't expect to see you guys here. Well, if we'd known you were working here today, you wouldn't have. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Just to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, Sam, what did Tony and I ever do to you? Well, you guys, you didn't do anything. Well, you sure act like we did. No, it's not what you did. It's... It's what you are. I told you. - No, you said it. - It's 'cause we're gay. No! Of course not. - It's not... - Well, then, what is it, Sam? - What is it? - You guys are demons. Well, I mean... I'm speechless. I don't know what to say about that. I don't know what to say. - The homophobe thing, all right. - I don't agree with it. I understand it. But fallen angels doomed to walk the earth for eternity, that weirds you out? - We exist. - It's not normal. It's biology versus society. What's normal, Sam? You're a reaper. I play racquetball with Gladys. She told me. - I thought this was the 21st century. - Apparently not. I mean, does he even know that I'm one of the top publicists in town, or that Steve here is a home security engineer, that he's designed over a dozen... a dozen? - More like 20. - 20 complex security systems, OK? For you ungrateful human beings, to keep you safe, OK? What more do you want from us? All right. All right. All right. Have you guys eaten anybody? - That's offensive. - We don't have to listen to this. That's offensive. Well, I don't know. How long you been there? Um, well, we've been here for a while, actually. It's not... weird. - Those poor kids. - I know. The look on their faces. So, how's everything going with the place? It's good. It's coming along. It's shaping up. - Yeah? - You should come by. Yeah, definitely. I will. - Maybe Friday. - Friday's good. All right. OK. I'm going to go back to work now. - OK. - I'll do it. Not true what they say about blondes. I think brunettes have all the fun. Would you take that off? You're freaking me out. - What are you doing here? - Just checking in, man. Just wanted to hear the latest gossip on your little love triangle. - Two-timing takes skill, you know. - I'm not two-timing anybody. I'm going to break it off with Cady before anything happens with Andi. Well, you just remember the most important woman you're juggling. You're on the clock, buddy. You find that soul quickly, or more women will die. You don't want that on your conscience, do you? - Do you? - No. Get back to work. Dude, where's Nikki? Angela writes here at night. This is our best bet. Benji, you got anything yet? Negative. Nothing so far. Damn it. Dude, it's been, like, 3 hours. You think anything's going to happen tonight? - I don't know. - Stakeouts suck. You can say that again. New lesbian zombie flick coming out Friday night. - Want to go? - Oh, I can't. - Why not? - Andi's coming over. - What? - Nice! Yes! Yes! Andi asks you to jump her bones, you just going to go ahead and jump them? - Well... atta boy. - I'm proud of you. - Guys. - Yeah? - Bogey on radar. - She's here. Get the bubbles. Get the bubbles. Benji! Quick! Go! Where did she go? - Don't tell me we lost her. - Let's check the lobby. What in the world happened in there, Sam? Didn't you ever blow bubbles as a little kid? - It's harder than it looks! - Stop it. There's no technique to blowing a perfect bubble. All you got to do is pucker up. Anybody else hungry? I'm starving. I got a craving for chili eese fries that just got insane. No, I'm good. Drop me off at the condo. All right. I'll see you guys in a minute. OK. We'll bring you back some doggy bag, all right? All right. Hi, Sam. How'd you find me? I've been waiting for us to be alone. Run all you want, baby. Run all you want. Sam. I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's right. Don't thank me. Of course. You swing both ways. Hey, at least I swing, baby. I really need you to leave. And I need to give you a friendly warning about your 2 little demon neighbors. They're small-minded, stubborn, useless bureaucrats. - Totally pathetic. - Someone's extraordinarily bitter. Well, you would be, too, if you had to deal with them every day. Don't go there, Sam. - They're not worth your time. - I got it covered. Don't worry about it. You just keep your head in the game. Before somebody really gets hurt. There's that pea-brain now. - Steve. Hey. - Sam. Ben told me I could find you here. Look, can we sit down for a second? - I'm sorry about before. - Not as sorry as I am, kiddo. Billy, can I get a mangotini and a, um, lager? I just... I wanted to say thank you for... - You saved my life. - That's right. I did do that, didn't I? - Well, I guess we all make mistakes. - And I'm trying to apologize. You're trying. You're not going to make this easy, are you? - Thank you, Billy. - Look, I assumed that... You assumed what, that Tony and I were cat-eating knuckle draggers? - That's demophobic and it's racist. - I'm not a racist. No? Then you're just extremely rude. You know what? You're right. You're right. We assumed the worst about you. Everybody does. They hear "demon," And that was stupid. That was an ignorant thing to do. We're sorry. From the bottom of our hearts, we're really, really sorry. You and Tony are great guys. That's all that matters. Well, it's a very nice gesture, Sam, but it's a little bit too little, a little bit too late. The Devil's right. You demons are so stubborn. Wait, wait, wait. - You've spoken to the Devil? - Yeah. I don't know why me. He just shows up and wants to talk. The Devil doesn't just hang with anybody. That's not his style. You are special, Sammy. The question is, why are you so special? Probably 'cause my parents sold my soul to the Devil. Yeah, yeah. I know. No, I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh. Tell you what... Why are we fighting? Do you know why we're fighting? Why are we fighting? We should not be fighting. - All right. - I forgive you, and I will make sure that Tony forgives you, too. Thank you. - Where... where is Tony? - He's swamped. He's doing publicity for this Seattle style magazine party tomorrow night. Seattle style magazine party? They throw this amazing party every year. It honors the 20 most beautiful women in the city, so it's a lot of pretty girls. You know... Now that... We're... we're good... friends again... You and Tony could do me the hugest favor ever. You do not waste any time, do you? - I know. I know. - What do you need? You think you could get me and the guys into this party? Aren't you just the little heterosexual? I'll tell you what I'm going to do... I will talk to Tony, and I will see if he can work his magic. Thank you so much. You're welcome. - OK. - Attach L5, L4... - This way. - L2 to L1 and align the holes in your. All right. Tonight at this party, we're going to track down the soul, right, and we're going to blow her ass back to hell. Tony should be here any minute. And then, the hottest chicks in the city are going to be at this party, right? Dude, look at where we work. I promise you it will be a step up. - What's wrong with the... - What up? - Tone. Hey. - OK. I am so sorry about everything, OK? What happened before? I apologize for my foolish, foolish friends. Hey, we really missed you, man. Well, Steve and I missed you guys, too. It's all water under the bridge. I got you the tickets for tonight. - Thank you so much. - Oh, tonight? Andi, this is Tony, our neighbor at this condo. He's getting us into this fashion party tonight. I am finally going to bag a model. I thought we were doing something tonight. I feel like I let the cat out of the bag. It was going to be a surprise, but Sam got you a ticket as well. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I... It's a party for the 20 most beautiful women in the city, but if we're all being honest, they can't hold a candle to you. Right, Sam? Looks like it's going to be one hell of a party. Oh, my god. I have never seen so many beautiful women in my life. I know. It's like bringing a fat kid to a donut shop. OK, guys, eyes on the ball. We got to find Nikki. - Yeah. Where's Andi? - She had to close up shop. - She'll be here soon. - OK. - You have the vessel? - Right here. Sock! Focus. I'm sorry, Sam. I couldn't help but notice that that poor brazilian supermodel isn't wearing any underwear. Please, woman. Show some respect. All right. Listen, tonight, we have to find Nikki. Nikki. Yeah. OK. We find Angela, Nikki's bound to be close by, OK? All right. We're going to do a quick lap. You wait here and look for Andi. - 'Cause you guys are looking for Nikki! - Nikki. Yeah, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki. - You look... you look beautiful. - Thank you. - You look great, too. - Thank you. Um, do you want to get a real drink? - Yeah. Yeah. - OK. Great. Ladies. Hey, how you doing? Oh, wow. Hey. I just wanted... Hey, how the hell do you talk to these girls? How do I talk to these girls? Here's Angela right there, OK? Stand up straight. You look good. - Watch and learn. - All right. Hi, there. How you doing? I was wondering if you believe in astrology, because I actually read palms. Oh, yeah? - Prove it. - OK. I will. Bye, hot lady friend. OK, listen. This one right here, this long one? That's your life line. And it looks to me... Yeah, it looks like you are going to lead a very long and fruitful life, - so that's good, right? - That's good. It's very good. This one right here, this... oh. That is actually concerning me a little. I don't know if I should tell you what this one means. What? What? Tell me. OK. This one means that, um... You're gonna be my baby mama... Benji, take notes if you wanna,... - Smooth. - Come on. Grab the champers. Let's go. - Hey, I'm sorry that I was so late. - Oh, whatever. You're here now. So... Lot of beautiful women here tonight. No one as pretty as you. I'm really glad you came tonight. Me, too. You know, I'm not going to pick this up. No. No. That's OK. You should. Hello? Cady. I'm glad you called. I've been trying to reach you for days. Where have you been? Listen, uh, Cady, we really need to talk. I can't right now. Cady, I gotta go. Sock! Ben! Let's go! Nikki's going after Andi! Go, go, go! You the valet? Thank you. Thank you. Here you go. Come on! Let's go, let's go. - Excuse me. - Yes? Are you OK? Your hand's bleeding. Andi! - What the hell is going on? - Come on! Go! Jeez! Go, go, go! - Sam!|- Hold on! Sam, who the hell is that? Oh my god! This is new. Up until now, I've only burned pretty people like me. You take a look in the mirror lately? Say goodnight, bitch. It's going to be OK, man. - Yeah, what if she's not? - Are you kidding me? That's Andi we're talking about. She's like superman, the girl version. If I hadn't picked up that call from Cady, I could have stopped this. This is my fault. - It's not your fault, Sam. - Of course it is! I'm always putting you 2 in danger, - and now, I'm doing it to Andi. - Listen to me. I do not want to hear any of this, "I'm the reaper, "I put my friends in danger" bologna right now, OK? We're in this together. Unity. We know what the risks are. We know what's involved, and we got your back, bro. All right? You guys are good. Thank you. Hey, nice job on catching that soul, kid. I knew you had it in you. Oh, by the way, I took care of that stolen car thing. Turns out that that valet guy was running a chop shop. Who knew, huh? I'm trying to get a refill on my xanax. Think I can slip it through the system? Look, we got to talk about this whole collateral damage thing. Yeah? What about it? Sock, Ben... they know they put their lives at risk when they help me out, but Andi? - She almost died last night. - Well, get used to it, kiddo. The people you care for are fair game. No. Not Andi. I have to protect her. Oh, will you stop with all the lovey-dovey crap? Just take what you can get in life. Love 'em and leave 'em. No strings attached. - Shouldn't be like that. - Oh, come on. A lifetime of meaningless, cheap one-night stands won't be so bad. Who knows? In time, you may learn to enjoy yourself, like moi. By the power of zeus, she lives! How you feeling, Andi? A little hazy, but... - Yeah. Concussion. - Yeah. - Hey, did the doctors x-ray you? - Good. 'Cause I have a theory about radiation. If you're exposed to enough in your lifetime, you have a greater chance of developing cool mutant powers. Thing is, I don't really think I want mutant powers, Sock. - Well, we're just glad you're OK. - Yeah. Me, too. Hey, why don't we go and, uh, scope out some candy stripers. Childhood fantasy of mine. Who was that last night? What are you talking about? - It was a car accident. - No, no, no. That woman, that thing. - You have a concussion. - I know what I saw. You need some rest, OK? I'll come back later. Thanks for saving my life. No, Andi, I didn't save your life. I almost got you killed. No. Look. There's things that... I won't ever be able to tell you. Losing you is a risk I'm not willing to take. I'm sorry. Hey, good boy, Sammy. My heart's bursting with pride. Want to go to a strip club? I know one with a great free buffet. Sam. Hey. Are you OK? Oh. Uh, yeah, Yeah. Probably shouldn't talk about it. Well, I heard you walking by... Demon ears. - Got a minute? - Yeah. What's up? Come inside. Sam. I need to talk to you in private. Come on in. What is this place? Have a seat. This? This is a place where we can talk openly, where anything we say stays between us. Nobody on Earth can hear us in here, Sam. Or spy on us. Not even him. The Devil. Sam. I've seen a lot of bounty hunters in my day. Truth is, you're different. - Different how? - The Devil talks to you, Sam. You have any idea how weird that is... The Prince of Darkness to sustain a friendship with a reaper? He finds you fascinating, Sam. He opens up to you. All of us have our reasons to fight the Devil. Tony and I, we have our reasons. And you have yours.
