Ben: EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON, SO I KNOW THAT FOR-- THAT'S INTERESTING. WHAT HAVE WE HERE? IT'S OK. THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND. HI. OH, IS SHE, NOW? WELL, WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT ALLOWED. PERHAPS I HAVEN'T BEEN CLEAR. WELL, NOW I'M GONNA BE CLEAR. IF YOU'RE FREE TO DATE IN THIS MARRIAGE, I AM, TOO. IF YOU'RE FREE TO GET PREGNANT... GOOD FOR YOU. MY, MY, MY. WHEN DID WE ACQUIRE TESTES? YESTERDAY. YESTERDAY. NOW I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN. THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND. UM, UH, TRY TO BE DISCREET. EXCUSE ME. THIS IS AWKWARD. SARA, I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. CLEARLY YOUR "HUSBAND" HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE. TED, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. THEN WHAT IS IT, BEN? YOU MARRIED HER, DID YOU NOT? YOU FILED PAPERWORK WITH THE HOME OFFICE. OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. ACTUALLY, TED, UM... BEN AND I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. SO... I SEE. I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU... ENJOYED THE LIFESTYLE. IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE TURNING THAT TRIANGLE INTO A SQUARE-- JUST LET ME KNOW. A CHASER FOR MY MAN, SAM. THANKS, BUT I'M GOOD. REALLY? YEAH. FROM WHERE I SIT, LOOKS LIKE YOUR LIFE'S STILL IN THE CRAPPER. AH, THAT SO? GREG IS ONE SELF-LOATHING HISSY FIT AWAY FROM ANOTHER CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. YOUR GAL'S IN DANGER. YOU YOUSELF ARE IN DANGER. IT'S WHAT WE CALL IN THE BUSINESS A CLASSIC CLUSTER "F." PRETTY PROUD OF YOURSELF. PRIDE IS MY FAVORITE CARDINAL SIN. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. KILL GREG. YEAH. OOH, SAY THAT AGAIN. ONLY, THIS TIME, USE A RUSSIAN ACCENT. I DON'T THINK SO. PLEASE. WELL, I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHEN I'D SEE THAT AGAIN. WELL, IT'S NICE TO PUT A GIFT TO GOOD USE. IT'S NOT FOR ME. IT'S FOR GREG. COME AGAIN. I'M CANCELING YOUR DEAL WITH GREG. HE WON'T GO TO HELL, HE WON'T HAVE POWER OVER ANDI, AND THE CHAIN SAW MANIAC GOES AWAY. EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NORMAL. TELL ME I'M WRONG. YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA USE THIS CARD FOR YOURSELF, SAM, GET BACK TO YOUR REGULAR LIFE? IT'S A LOT TO GIVE UP. NO, IT'S NOT. BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR ME. THERE'S ALWAYS A CATCH, RIGHT? YOU'D FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SCREW ME OVER. YOU'RE WISIN' UP, PAL. MY LITTLE BOY'S BECOMING A MAN. SO I'M GIVING IT TO GREG, AND I'M BETTING EVEN YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS ONE. OH? CONGRATS, BUDDY. YOU JUST GAVE UP ETERNITY FOR A WORKPLACE CRUSH. WHAT A SUCKER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME. MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT? GREG. I MEAN, NO, DON'T GET ME WRONG. HE'S A TOOL, AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE, BUT STILL. BUT WHAT? I MEAN, HE TRADED HIS SOUL FOR ME. IT'S FLATTERING, BUT CRAZY. KIND OF ROMANTIC IN A WAY. NO, JUST CRAZY. LOOK, SHOOTING STAR.
