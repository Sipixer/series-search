Who are you? Hey, I'm sorry Andi broke up with you because you're the son of the devil. And even though your dad evil, I thought you guys were a great couple together. No. No, don't be sorry. I'm not ready to give up yet. If I keep pushing, working some angles, using my charm, I know I can get her back. You think that's the right idea? Maybe you should give it a little space for a while. No, space is the enemy. I'm not done until we get back together. Good for you. Sometimes you've got to look reality in the face and say no. Morning, buttheads. - Hey, you guys seen Kristen around? - Think she's in the shower. Really? Brought shower coffee. Sock! What are you doing? Come on, I've seen your cash and prizes before. Get out! My father will catch us. What? Relax. My mom and your dad moved out. We're good. They could visit anytime. This is not acceptable. What? Come on. What are you so worried about? My father cannot know I date my stepbrother. All right, sure, look, he'll be shocked at first, yeah, but so is the father of every girl I've ever dated, all right? But eventually, I promise you, he will settle into a nice, grudging acceptance. No, you don't know my father. He does not change his mind. Ever. Go on. Don't let me interrupt. Come, come on. Can you believe this? She doesn't think that I can charm her father. Me. - Unbelievable. - I know, it's nuts. - Could you put some clothes on, please? - I'm too upset for clothes, man. Is that flax? This stuff's really good for you. -= 207 =- " The Good Soil " Sub VO :  ¤Aka¤ Subs-Addicts" [Sub-way.fr] Man, so hot. Corporate's making me fill out all these stupid responsibility matrix forms. I swear to god, if I don't take a break, i'm gonna kill someone. You guys want to see a movie tonight? Bloodier the better. I choose Sam. What? You guys broke up, I had to choose a side. I chose Sam. Wait, why do you have to choose any side? I know what you're trying to do here, Andi. This is an ugly and awkward situation. I made a choice, it's Sam, live with it. Nobody's saying that we don't want to be friends in the future? We just think that in the time being maybe we should take a break. A friendship break. While Sam heals. That's too bad, 'cause I had a pretty cool assignment I was gonna throw to a couple of friends. A cool assignment? We just got in a new shipment of hammocks, really nice ones, and I need people to stretch test them. Stretch test? You know sleep in them for a few hours, see how they hold up. - I choose you! I'm on your side. - Break's over. When do we start? Are they here? Thought so. Try not to chew on it, OK? Remember what happened to your squeaky toy? None of my other girlfriends ever played fetch with me. I like to be special. Baby. guess what saturday is? Our 2-month anniversary. You're right. 2 months ago I kidnapped you and forced you to be my boyfriend. The details don't matter. What matters is I want to do something special for our occasion. Anything you want to do, OK? Unless it involves sacrificing an animal. But anything else, i'm in. You know what, there is something that I want to do. It's something that's really important to me, and I think it'll take our relationship to the next level. Reverse cowgirl. No, silly, I want to take you flying. - Right, yeah, flying. - It's such an amazing experience, Ben. At night, I go up to the mountains, and I swerve through the clouds, and I buzz along the treetops. It's so moving, baby. And I really want to share it with you. - It sounds awesome. - Really? - Well, let's go right now. - No, let's not. Why? I think we should save something so special for our special day, that's all. You're right. You're right. OK, we'll save it for saturday. This is gonna be so great. Great. I just don't understand. I mean, this is like every relationship I've ever been in. - There's always a fatal flaw. - What's the fatal flaw this time? Nina wants to take me flying, but I can't. I don't want to die. Have you tried telling her how you really feel? OK. Tut-tut. Talking about feelings, Sam? Come on. We're discussing Ben's fata not yours. Benjamin, look at me. Come here. Look at me. I want you to forget all about this fatal flaw poppycock. It is nonsense, all right? You are going to fly. - You think so? - I know so, buddy. - Bring it in. - Go get her! It's so sad. She's totally dumping him. Great. What the hell is Morgan doing back? He's here? I Miss that guy. Little bit. - Afternoon, fellas. - What's shaking Morgan? Let me tell you where I was 12 hours ago. The French Riviera, surrounded by topless super models and Champagne. And now I'm here, at the work bench, surrounded by toilet plungers. You didn't have to come back. Not true, Sammy boy. Dad ordered me to. Wanted me to do more of that training stuff with you. Just believe in yourself. There, training complete. You know and I know that I'm really bad at this job, but you were born for it. You're great at this. And I'm above it. No offense. So, I have a proposition for you. You catch a soul for me, and I'll give you - $10,000. - Morgan, no. I do not work for you. Fair enough. 20,000. Hold on. Hold on one sec. We've got to catch the guy anyway. Why not make a little extra cheese in the meantime? - We don't need his money. - I need his money. - I want his money. - For what? For a new hot water heater and jet skis. It doesn't matter what for. Listen, don't we deserve a little something to show for all the crap we put up with around here, just once? - All right. - All right. So, you catch me the soul, i'll take credit, dad's off of my back, and I'm out of your hair. And you're all the richer for it. Can you smell it, Sammy? - Sweat and cigarettes? - Desperation. Intoxicating. My boy Morgan show his face yet? Everything's fine. He's going to help with the next soul. That's what I wanted to hear. I knew we just had to light a fire to that kid's rear end. Speaking of next soul. Wait. Wait. Uh, actually never mind. I don't feel proud about this one, Sam. I mean, one could say that I'm even feeling a little guilty about it, - you know. - What does that mean? Well, he was killed while coveting. - So? - So, it's the commandment. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. This poor schmuck was mentally undressing some broad, then the next instant. Hit by a truck. He was just looking at her? Didn't have sex with her? - That is stupid. - Yeah, tell me about it. You know, in the old days I used to get the souls that ate shrimp. Can you imagine how unsatisfying that was? Wait, so you can go to hell for just thinking of something? Yeah. Don't blame me. I didn't make the rules. You know, you're right. Why should I feel guilty about this? This one's on the big guy. Now, get me my soul back. Guy's named Billy Boyland. Died back in early nineties. This was one of his favorite hangouts back then. Excuse me. Hi, can I get... Still is. Look over there. A little bit of whipped cream and 2 cherries. Do I know you guys? - Is that a dodgeball? - Good guess. Well, yeah, I've had a lot of those thrown at me over the years. It's also a vessel to send you back to hell. Come on, I don't want to cause any trouble, but I mean, you guys know why I went to hell, don't you? Coveting? Isn't that a little unfair? Heard every excuse in the book, billy boy. It doesn't matter. - Do it now. Nobody's looking. - No. Wait, wait. Please, just let me eat my dessert first. Eternity is such a long time for no pie. - OK, fine, fine. Hurry up. - Thank you. It's delicious. - You want some? - Sure, I wouldn't mind. Don't worry. Sorry. I got it. Here, have some. - That's not bad. - Vessel him now, the pie's ours. - Where'd he go? - What? There he is! There he is! Son of a bun! - Son of a bun! - Billy, wait! Wait, Billy, wait! He's got a weapon! False alarm. - Sam, give me that vessel. - I'm doing this myself. Please. Is there anyway you will let me stay out? There's literally nothing you can say or do right now to sto this from happening. I'm a virgin. - Say again? - I died before I ever had sex. Just let me stay out long enough so that I could fulfill that dream. - What? - Sock, what are you doing? - He said the magic words, Sam. - What, the magic word is "virgin"? - Ask anybody. - It's true. It's your dream to have sex? You are looking at your dreamweavers, my man. We are going to get you laid. We got to get this guy some action? It's going to be tough, but not impossible. II got a plan. Follow me. Listen up, man. If we're going to make this thing happen for you, you are going to have to pay for sex. Are you cool with that, big guy? What? We're all going to chip in for a really lovely and discreet lady. High-class, I like it. Now, before we get started, is there anything weird that you're into? No. No, I'm not paying for sex. If you're not going to cooperate, then we got to send you back. But I did have an idea. What if, - what if we try the encounters bar? - Why would you want to go there? The clientele is a little more... Mature. Mature? All right, I know what's going on here. Yeah. Our boy Billy's into the older ladies. The cougs. I'm talking about? That's smart. They get the job done fast, righ dirty thirties, whorey forties. The surprisingly tender fifties. You, my friend, are a genius. We're gonna hit happy hour, pop your cherry. Sock, is that what you're wearing? Today's family portrait day. You must look presentable. - Change. - Right, right, pics with the fam. It's gonna be good. I'll finally a little quality time with Morris. No. No quality time. Do not talk to my father. Do not even look at him. Do you understand? He's gonna love me. OK, why don't the gentlemen step aside so I can get some shots of the ladies? Absolutely. Beautiful ladies. I get it. You guys look great. Hey, man. Thought you had some pretty rad poses back there. We should hang some time, me and you. Know what I mean? So what do you what do you like to do for fun? You like to... Like to golf? I like to golf. Get out the old 9 iron. Got a good short game. - It's, what about ping pong? - He likes fly-fishing. He's-fly-fishing? That's aces. I'm the biggest fly-fisher of all time. I love it, I love it. He's going fly-fishing tomorrow. You should take him, Morris. Uh, fly-fishing is typicly a solitary pursuit. So... Come on, honey. Very well. Tomorrow we fly-fish. Perfect. OK, good. Won't let you down. Yeah, I'm gonna kick some fish ass. Encounters Bar happy hour 5pm seafood sampler $4.99 Welcome to the jungle, boys. Time for a little big game hunting, cougar style. They look like regular ladies to me. Lock and load, bitches. You tag 'em, you bag 'em. Please stop talking like that. That's her. That's the one I want to talk to right there. - Come on, I need a wingman. - Not it. Not cool. You guys know I stink at not it. Come on, Billy. Good afternoon, ladies. What has this fine day brought for you? We just got back from a conference. A conference. Wonderful. What do you do? I'm a pharmaceutical rep. And I'm a psychotherapist. Psychotherapist? So you deal with emotional issues, people looking to overcome their fears and forge meaningful and lasting relationships? Well, you could say that. Fascinating. Would you like to get a drink with me? Sure. Hi. You look lovely. Thank you. And it just seems like whenever things start to go well in a relationship something always comes up. In this case, you know, it's the flying, but... Maybe I'm unlucky or maybe I just haven't found the right girl yet. I don't know, I just... Well, my guess is the problem lies with you. You sabotage your relationships. I do that? Perhaps because you don't lieve you're worthy of love. Until you love yourself, you're not going to be able to love others or be loved. You're right. You're absolutely right. Thank you, you're... Very good. - Is this still therapy? - It is for me. - We got to go. Billy's on the move. - What, really? You believe it? Our little virgin's all grown up. You don't mind, I just... - I'm sorry. Just... - It's OK. - I guess we just wait out the night. - When the sun comes up, we nab him before he does the walk of shame. Good stuff. - What's going on? - Oh, my god. We must have dozed off. Do you think Billy escaped? Did you look both ways? Hey, guys, what's up? Good god. We thought you might have skipped out on us. No way. I don't want to be anywhere but right here. Last night was amazing. Well, I'm glad you got to do this, Billy, but, you know the deal. I can't go back to hell now. I can't. You guys, Cindy and i, we connected. On every level. I think we're soulmates. A lot of guys confuse sex for love the first time. You just met this woman at a Random bar. Come on, Billy. Actually, I knew she'd be there. I was sort of following her. She was the girl I was coveting when I died. When I got out of hell, I found out she'd gotten divorced, so I knew I had to take a shot. And this time there is no covet. Now there's only love-it. That's good. Hey, Tiger. Your pop-tarts are ready. These guys friends of yours? Pretty much. I'm gonna be late for work, so help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I love you. I love you, too. You can't send me back, Sam. It's just not right. Hey. You free for lunch? I think it's best if we kept a professional relationship right now. Right. Yeah, no, this is completely professional. It's a work problem. It's just... It's for my other job. Well, can't Sock or Ben do it? Well, this problem really needs somebody who's... Smart. I can see your Dilemma. OK. Yeah, I could use a break. Look how happy they are. I mean, how am I supposed to vessel this guy? - I don't know. - String cheese? - Yeah. Thanks. - No problem. It's just-it's so unfair that the devil is always ruining true love, you know? And I'm just trying to figure out a way just one time the devil doesn't win, because love is worth fighting for, right? Strawberry? - What are you doing? - Having snacks. Oh, my god. - What? - This was all a set-up. You just wanted to get me in the car so that you could talk about love. - That... that is crazy. - Is it? Then what is this for? Later? All right, fine. Yes, this is somewhat of a set-up. Fine. But you know, you've got to give some credit. - I'm trying to win you back here. - Give you credit for what, Sam? You trying to trick me, manipulate me. Do you know who that sounds like? And the devil. Come on. I mean, you're being influenced by them more and more every day. No, but I'm trying to do something good. I mean, isn't that... Aren't you the least bit charmed? That's not the point. Andi, no. Wait. Where are you going? I don't know. I don't know. I'm walking home. Hello. Baby? - No. Wait, wait. - What? - Don't look. Don't look. - What? OK. All right. You ready? Open your eyes! I decorated with human furniture! Oh, yes, it's lovely. I just wanted you to feel at home. Oh, baby. What's that? I got good news. Now, remember how I said I didn't want to fly because I wanted to save it for a special day? - I was afraid. - Of flying? No, of loving myself and letting myself by loved. And that's good news? That's great news because I figured it out- How to love myself. I just have to remember how wonderful I am. And that's where this comes in. My vision board. It constantly reminds me of my best qualities. "Friendly." That's me. I love that about myself. I'm very friendly. The Brooklyn Bridge. I'm just like that Bridge. I bring people together. I do not collapse under pressure. These guys, just like me with Sock and Sam. Then gentlemen boys, friendship, bromance. Is any of this making sense? I think so. So, do you want to go flying tomorrow or not? I do. I absolutely do. Tomorrow night for our special anniversary, you and me, we're flying to the moon. Baby, you would suffocate and freeze before we got there. But OK, tomorrow. - Hey, what's that one? - Nothing, I just like bunnies. Oh, god. Poppa weewee, that's cold. - Where are your waders? - Waders? I don't need them. I like to feel the water. It helps me locate the fish. Know what I mean? Here we go. All right. I got it. You are a terrible fisherman. Yeah. You know, I just thought maybe it'd be a good idea for you and I to come out here and bond a little. You know, spend some quality time together. I mean, look at this. Look what we're having. Good times. GTS. Yes, good times. Listen, I feel like I could, I could ask you anything, dad. So here's one for you, and, this is purely hypothetical, by the way. What if, you know, I wanted to ask your daughter out on a date? That is outrageous to consider. Yeah. Yeah, I know, but I'm serious, though. You know, I know the whole stepsister, stepbrother thing is a little weird. That's of no importance. Look, Sock, - you're certainly a nice boy. - Thank you. And, a funny kind of clown. You could just say charming. Kristen would not date you. You aren't good enough for her. Excuse me. Not good enough? You have silly clown hair and big honking clown nose. Honk honk. Is that funny? Really funny. I'm a big laugh to you? Check this out. Your daughter wasn't laughing when she gave herself to me. So... You... Soiled my daughter? Soiled? No. No, not soiled. No, no. I made the sweetest love to your daughter. You know, I cherished her virginity. I cherished every moment of it. What the hell was that for? All right! What do you, what do you want me. Hey, Sam. How are you? I'm doing all right. I just wanted to check on you. It's all good in here. You, still a grape guy? No thanks. Do you have a second to talk? Yeah, sure. And now I'm supposed to send this guy Billy back to hell, even though he's not evil and even though he found the love of his life. Sam, I actually envy the guy. I'd rather be a soul running free for one day than to be stuck in this decaying body forever. He's out there getting friendly with the ladies. I can't even get close to your mom or... Any other woman for that matter. You're right, because you're a decaying body. - Thanks, Sam. Rub it in. - No. No, I'm saying, I think I have an idea for how to keep Bill out of hell. - I don't know about this. - No, this is gonna work. It has to, 'cause I don't have any other ideas. I don't know. I mean, digging up a grave seems wrong. I mean, disturbing the dead is some bad Mojo. In this case, the dead is across town sleeping at his girlfriend's house. We're just disturbing his old corpse. So you think that dodgeball's gonna work on his dead body? Maybe hell will think it's a mix-up. If not, we got to send billy back. Either way we get to enjoy the night air and desecrate a cemetery. Found it. "Billy Boyland. Born 1971. Died 1993." Dug up 2009. So how'd it go with you and Kristen's dad? Weel, he called me a clown, said I wasn't good enough to date Kristen, and attacked me with a fishing rod. Had to escape by swimming across the lake. That's terrible, Sock. Honestly, compared to some other times when I've met the parents, it didn't go that badly, Benji. You know, he didn't pull a gun on me, didn't try to rip off my genitals. Sounds like he's got a soft spot for you. - Finished. - Yeah? - Is that Billy? - I don't know what that is. He was hit by a truck. All right. You always were good at dodgeball. EPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES got my vessel? Got my money? Place the vessel on the mat. It looks like it might be too big. Right. Yeah. - Have a nice day. - Wait. There's not i don't have to sign anything? I just want to make sure I get the credit. OK, great. Thank you. Perfect. - What's that? - Red notice. What does that mean? It means there was something other than a soul inside. What'd you put in there, potatoes? What? No, no. I didn't even... Sam's the one that got the soul. Hey, douchebag. What did you do? I didn't do anything. It was probably just a glitch. - Well, you got to fix it. - I- what do you, I'm nofixing! Stop it. Don't you ever try to screw me again. This was amazing. Thank you. My pleasure. So... You ready? Completely ready. Let's do this. This is the perfect night for flying. I say we fly out to the water, cruise along the coast a little bit, and then we'll fly inland. I can't do this. What? Look, I know how important it is to you, but I can't do it. I just now realized that it's not that I don't love myself enough it's that I'm super afraid of flying. And falling. I'm sorry, Nina, i'm sorry, but no, no, no. - Can I tell you a secret? - Of course. A long time ago I had hemophobia. That ain't right. My cousin's gay. No, hemophobia. It's a fear of blood. Well, you love blood. I know. See, that's what's crazy. I- I just had to confront my fear and immerse myself in it. And then once I did that, it was great, I loved it. And now I could bathe in it every single day. That's... Nice for you. No, but I can help you, too. The question is, will you let me? Yes, Nina, please help me. Perfect. What are you doing? No. No! You jammed up the system, Sammy. The system is made of cogs, and every cog must play its part. - Please stop. Please. Please stop. - This little cog here had to muck up the machinery? And now look what you're making me do. I'm sorry. I'll get Billy. Please, I'll get him, I swear. No, you won't. You can't. And the sad thing is, I won't be able to get him either. The ender will. What is "the ender"? My failsafe. I had it created for the rare occasion when a soul gets lost or some idiot tries to brinG a corpse back in its place. The ender is released, tracks the soul down and destroys it. Utterly destroys it. And that means one less soul for me in hell. Well, just call the ender off. Oh, god! Call it off? Can you call off the terminator? You can't reason with it. You can't stop it. Well, isn't there anything we can do? He dye's been cast, buddy. Nice going. Your pal Billy's gonna wish he was back in hell by the time the ender's through with him. Missed me! - Hey. There's my hero. - I came to warn you. There's this thing called the ender. The devil says it's coming to destroy your soul. Why can't anything ever go right for me? I'm sorry Billy, but, you know, you lost your virginity, and you fell in love. But I'm still a virgin. What? I wanted to connect emotionally before we connected physically. You better start connecting physically quick because I have a feeling you're running out of time. I can't rush it, dude. It's not just about me, it's about Cindy's pleasure, too. It says so right on the coom box. Maybe I can buy you some time. But we need to get you two out of here. It was amazing. I mean, one second I'm about to eat the sidewalk, the next I'm soaring through the city, cradled in Nina's arms, her demon breath keeping me warm. Focus now, Benji. Come on, this has to be the perfect love chamber. Kid's gonna need all the help he can get, know what I mean? Just one second. Nice. Smile, smile. Hello. Welcome to storm command central. We have everything for you to feel safe. We have flashlights on the dresser, and then we have daiquiris and lotion on the nightstand. Also, please feel free to peruse my collection of adult erotica, - both in print and Dvd. - Why did we have to come here? Well, it's safer to wait out a storm with friends. Exactly, so we're gonna leave you two alone and check out the weather channel. Billy you let me know when. I'll let you know when the storm passes. Good, great. Let's go. Come on, guys. You know, I can't believe he's not done yet. I'm impressed, man. Billy's a stallion. Smart. Girls talk to each other. You're only as good as your last job, you know what I mean. Look! Holy crap, this is bad. Come on. Go, go, go, go. We have to get Billy. Come on, Billy. Is it gone? What just happened? Hey, guys. Finally up? You dog. Boppidy boppidy. How does it feel to finally lose your virginity? How does it feel, boys? Let me just show you. I won't be needing this. Intercourse cured your asthma? Nobut Cindy's a pharmaceutical rep, so she gets them for free. - Congratulations, buddy. - Aces. Do we know what happened, why the ender didn't come for me? - Ben has a theory, actually. - Yeah. So, during the act of love, or at the exact moment of consummation, 2 souls became one. Yours and Cindy's. Well, it's like the ender lost your scent. They say the devil has no dominion over true love. So, am I out? Yeah, I mean, the devil thinks you were destroyed by the ender, and I don't even have a vessel to capture you, so yeah, that's it. How could I ever repay you guys for this? I'm going to spend the rest of my days making Cindy happy. - Good luck, Billy. - Good luck, Billy. Something good happened here today, boys. The geek escaped from hell. Geek banged a cougar. Ge walks away a little less of a geek. And we helped. Looks like we're his fairy bone-mothers. That is a nice feeling. Finally a happy ending to this crap job. - No kidding. - Isn't that Morgan? Wait, wait, wait. - No! - Stop! Wait, Morgan, stop! - What are you doing? - Hey, it's the fellas. Dad told me you tend to fall for those sob stories, so he sent me to do the job you couldn't do. Give it to me. Easy, man. Your conscience is clear. You didn't want to send him to hell, now you don't have to. I'll do it. And everyone's happy, right? Hey, you got a second? That depends. You're not going to pull out some champagne on me again, are you? No, no. This is strictly work-related. I wanted to ask you if I could leave early tonight there's something I have to do. I'm going to need a better reason than that, Sam. Morgan took him. Morgan took Billy, he's back in hell. - I'm sorry. - You know, it's not fair. I... I try to do something good, something to make this whole thing tolerable, and it's always taken away from me. Well, if it makes any difference, you have the rest of the night off to do whatever you need to do. Thank you. I'll make it up to you. You want company? You know, as long as it's not a date. No, it's definitely not. Where you been hiding all day? And, where you going? Back to Japan. School's over, and I'm going home. Going home? Why? You were in school? Yes, Sock. Hotel management school. Don't you remember me studying all the time? You were gonna leave and you weren't gonna tell me, Kristen? How could you do that? I was afraid it would be too painful. OK, you don't have to leave. I talked to your dad already, and once he gets tired of beating me, we can eventually be happy together, you and me. I'm so sorry, Sock. In Japan I was afraid of having my life planned out for me, so I decided to come to America to discover who I was. And then I found you. And you... Helped me discover so much about myself. I came to America as a girl, but because of you, I leave it as a woman who has discovered both her sexuality and her ability to manage an extended-stay hotel. Right. I owe all of that to you. You're welcome. Sorry, Billy. Did everything we could. You know, this ground looks freshly dug up. Yeah, we did that. The OK. Well, he was happy for a little while. I mean, it has to mean something. I hope so. You're trespassing. You can't be here. I'm going to call the cops. Alan, wait! Dammit.
