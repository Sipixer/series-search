- You didn't tell Andi? - No! I'm not gonna tell Andi. If she knows, she'll think I'm a freak. She'll never go out with me. - Flowers aren't from me. - No, they're from Greg. I know you've been distracted by all this Greg business, I took the liberty to dig up some dirt on him. Well, you know, Greg's dating twins, ok? 2 slutty twins. They're his sisters. Someone gave me the wrong information. Who? Who would say that? He's in the bathroom. Oh, man. Look at that crazy. Hey, these are all about the world trade organization... The G-8 summit. Hey, wait. What was this soul gonna do? Sam! Sam! Can I have this after we capture him? - Sock! - Hey, who's out there? This is a private residence! I don't think you can be in here. Leon, get out here! Listen, I'm all better now. I'm not killing anybody anymore. We can see your wall of insanity, ok? We know what you're planning. No, no! That's my thought board. My therapist told me to make it. Do we have to come in there or are you gonna come out? Well... Ok, then. I want you guys to know I've worked very hard on my psychological health, so what I'm about to do is very difficult for me. It's really going to hurt my heart. There's no freaking way I'm going back to hell. Well, this just keeps getting easier and easier. Season 1, Episode 6 - Leon For www.forom.com Wow. I'm not usually a morning person, but I kind of like knocking a soul off first thing. Get the rest of the day to myself. I knew that guy was going down easy. He came out, we sucked his ass up, and boom, end of story. Sock, I almost got killed. Whatever. We've almost been killed way worse than that. Uh, Sam, where's Gladys? Can I help you? - Yeah. Is Gladys here? - On vacation. - Do you know when she'll be back? - No. Is there something I can help you with? That? I'm just wondering if you want to take that. Do I want your snow globe? I mean, is there a place where stuff like this gets turned in? Sir, this is the department of motor vehicles. Right, right. Is there anybody else who could maybe help us? Do you want his snow globe? Yeah, I'll take that. I'm just gonna come back another time. - Thanks, guys. - Thank you. Halloween is an extremely important holiday to me. The one time of year when a person allows his feelings to take flight... His wishes and desires to be known to the world. Ted, uh, you do realize Halloween is still two days away? Halloween is not a day, ok? It's a season. Which brings me to my special treat. Who wants to be our lucky pumpkin? Huh? Oh, come on, guys. You get to dress up as a beautiful pumpkin and bring joy to children... and pass out coupons. You're not going to be the pumpkin, Sock. Racist. Andi. Hey. Ouch. - She still mad at you? - Andi! Andi, come on. Andi, yes! You can be the pumpkin. No. I really don't want to be the pumpkin, Ted. I-I'll be the pumpkin. I'll... Me. Not her. Ok. Sorry, Andi. I guess Sam wants it more than you. Ok. I got something seriously cool to show you guys. All right. You ready? Sock, stop messing with the vessel. Shh, shh! Ok. Do it! Uh...what do you want me to say? It talks! I know! I know. I heard it coming from Sam's locker. How'd you get into my locker? Oh, bolt cutters. Look, I think I'm gonna hide it in Ted's private bathroom so he thinks the toilet's talking to him. What do you think? - No. We're not doing that. - I'll do that. Just leave it alone. Ok? We don't want to break it. Listen, I was just wondering, any chance I can get out of here for therapy at 3:00 today? No, I am not letting you out. Well, why not? Uh, let's start with the original problem. Leon, you were an assassin. You mean shooting President McKinley? Are you going to hold that against me? Yes, yes, I am. That was a hundred years ago. I'm completely over that now. I've been out of hell over a year. - I haven't tried to hurt anybody. - You shot at us. Self-defense! Leon, you're going back to hell. - Do no touch him. - Oh, come on, Sam. Why are you doing this? Why do you care? Because he's the devil's bounty hunter. You got that right, Sock. This guy really does have a stick up his ass. Stick up my ass? What are you, talking about me behind my back? No, no, it was a joke. But doesn't every joke have a grain of tru to it? Don't touch it. Hey, what's up? - Stocking the candy, huh? - Yep. All right. Is that what we're doing now? One-word answers? Andi, come on. I'm sorry, ok? I didn't mean to sabotage you and Greg. I'm sorry I even got involved. I was just-- I was truly just trying to be your friend. What can I do to make this up to you? I'll do anything. Name it. - I just can't. - Can't what? It's not what you said about Greg, ok? It's what that said about us. And if you could do something like that, then maybe our friendship isn't what I thought it was. Honestly, I just really don't know how to be friends with you anymore. Oh. That's a problem. I just--I can't. What the... Hello, Spike. Perfect timing, because my day didn't suck enough yet. Surprise. What's up? Very little. O-kay. This is gonna sound weird, but are you all right? Holidays always depress me, Sam. Holidays? What? Halloween? I thought you'd love this time of year. I detest it with every fiber of my being. Back when it was the Ancient Celtic Festival of Samhain... Now that--that was a holiday. Dead rising from their graves... Damaging crops, causing trouble. Good times. But now you hate it. It's the commercialization of evil. The one day when not a soul on earth fears me, or even believes in me. I become a party gag. A plastic mask. It's only one day out of the year. Are you trying to make me feel better, Sam? Yeah. I guess I am. How weird. In any event, I let hell take a holiday on Halloween. Then everything grinds to a halt, paperwork gets backs up. A few days of vacation sets me back a hundred years. It's a nightmare. Ahh. That's why I couldn't turn in Leon. The DMV demon was on vacation. The whole thing makes me sick. You want to hear a really scary story? This used to be a slaughterhouse. Turn of the century they were butchering a thousand head of cattle a day. And when it rained, the streets would run red with blood. - Ahh. - Then in the 1940s, a serial killer terrorized this neighborhood. Under the cover of night. He chose easy victims... You know, runaways... vagrants... prostitutes. He brought them all here. They called him the butcher. And this little guy, he was on the torture team for the butcher down in hell. Spike may not look like much, but can he make grown men cry. So the butcher's on the loose? He's already claimed one victim. And he's going to try to kill again. Here. Police finally caught the butcher, but they never found any of his victims. There were rumors about what he did with the bodies. Oh, no! She is crying her eyes out on the inside, man. Yeah, somehow I doubt that. Oh, come on, you guys can handle this. You made a tiny little mistake. She's gotta forgive you sooner or later. She doesn't trust me. She thinks I'm a liar. - I can't blame her. - Yeah. Oh, here, by the way. Took him with me to trivia night at the bar. - What? - Dude knows his history. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You took him out with you last night? Are you insane? Listen, you can't just keep him cooped up in your locker all day and night, it's cruel. Cruel? Sock, he's a murderer. It was a mistake. I realize that now. It was all misdirected anger. I wasn't mad at President McKinley, I was mad at my father. See? Therapy's working wonders. Last night at the bar, he was totally helping me through all my mother issues last night. - What mother issues? - Well... The breast feeding. And how I never wanted to stop. And Leon explained to me that that is ok. I'm ok. And I can help you too, Sam. Tell me about your childhood. My parents sold my soul to the devil. So. Ohh. Uh, well, that's some abandonment and betrayal... And I'm gonna guess there was a lot of bed-wetting. - Ok. - Listen, listen. The point is, Leon is trying to make himself a better person. Ok? He made mistakes. Just like you made a mistake. Doesn't everybody deserve forgiveness, hmm? You know what I'm saying? Hey, Ted. How come you didn't dress up for Halloween? Pumpkin costume is in my office, Sam. Thank me later for having it dry cleaned. The last pumpkin was quite the sweaty betty. Scare up some savings at the Bench. Scare up some savings at the Bench. 30%... I hate this costume. It's so humiliating. Well, I think you look like a very pretty pumpkin. - I look like an idiot. - No, you don't. You know, Leon said that you might have some self-esteem issues, and I can clearly see that now. - Enough with Leon already. - Scare up some savings at the-- He's right though. Look at you. You're embarrassed, you're all afraid that people will look you in the eye. This is not the Sam I know. Thank you. You're not helping! You know what, you are letting the pumpkin own you. You need to own the pumpkin. - You own the pumpkin. - Excuse me? - You own the pumpkin. - I would kill to own the pumpkin, ok? I would kill somebody to be in your place right now. Embarrassment does not compute up here, Sam. Matter of fact... I think I might get into my Halloween costume right now. Sock? What are you-- what are you doing? Getting into my costume. I just told you. Ah! I am underwear man. I'm underwear man. Give me the flyers, give them, give them. Listen to me, Sam. Listen to me. If someone tries to humiliate you, all you need to do is just look that person in the eye and humiliate them right back. Show them you're the cat's nuts. You know what I mean? Watch this. Hi, there. Welcome to the Work Bench. Happy Halloween. Totally dominated that guy. See? It's that easy. You feel better about being the pumpkin? Yeah, yeah. I kinda do. It's actually kinda liberating. I can feel every littl breeze. Let's check it out. Come on, come on. All righ, Sam. Open it up. What is it? - Some kind of thermometer. - It's a meat thermometer. You stab it into a pot roast, turkey or something. Right, right. The butcher. Meat. Makes sense. The butcher? That's a pretty good name. Yeah. If I was a serial killer, I'd want my name to be something more effective like murder man and killbot. Well, it seems user-friendly. Stab it into the soul's trachea, no problem. What's with the hell hound? I think he's supposed to help us find the soul. So how do we nab the butcher? Find his hide-out. I don't know where the devil took me last night, but for a change, he gave me a lot of background on the guy. Good. Let's look him up. We need the computer. No. Hey, they got some candy up front. You want some candy? Don't care. All right. I tried. Come on. You're out of here. Type, Ben. Found this on a serial killer website. "Barney Kirkwood, a-k-a the Butcher of Ballard, a particularly brutal killer, active in the forties. Nearly escaped prosecution because the bodies were never found." That's him, that's who the devil was talking about. Now they think he chopped up his victims and fed them to his dogs. - Now that's gross. - You're supposed to be the helper, huh? - Where is he? - He is called the Butcher of Ballard. And Ballard is only a few miles away. - Let's go. - Yeah. Let's do it. No, I think we're wrong. This isn't where the devil took me. Looks completely different. I don't know, then if... he's in another neighborhood, we're screwed. Look at that. "Rebecca Cashman." "Last seen leaving work at the flower market two nights ago." Wait a second. This is it. This is where he took me. You think he's still got the missing girl? I doubt it. Said he'd already killed once. But he's coming back tonight. Thank god it's not a full moon tonight. Yeah, I would hate to have to catch the butcher under a full moon. It's getting late, we should head-- Have you seen Sock? No, he disappeared as soon as we got back. Hey. Hey. - What's up? - What? Nothing. I was just remembering a really funny thing that happened. Oh, yeah? What? Uh...I was just... having a private moment-- - Little joke for myself. - You have brain damage. Maybe...probably. All right. So, go on. So, Ted hears my voice coming out of his toilet. And he says, god, is that you? And I said, yes, Ted. This is god. And I've got Abe Lincoln with me and we both think you're a huge douche bag. And then he started crying, going, ooh, ooh, honest Abe, please forgive me. S, uh, so, what does the butcher look like now? I don't know... What is it? What is it? Whoa. Lassie's going nuts. Oh, Sam, is that you? Are you playing a joke? It's not funny. Look! I got to stab it! Go, go, go! Sam. Listen, Sam, what do we do? - I have to get close enough... - But that's insane, Sam! Just wait. Maybe it went away. - Maybe it thinks we left. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's coming! - Stab it, stab it now. - I got to do something. - Do it now, Sam. Do it now. Look out! Aah! I dropped it, I think. I lost the vessel! I lost the vessel! I'll see you in hell, buddy. Spike. Oh my god. You're the number one. You are the champion! Ahh! I've never been so afraid in my entire life. - What was it? - The butcher. Hell must've turned him into some kind of dog monster or something. Pretzels for the hero, huh? You saved our asses! - Take that, take that. - You know, I'm gonna have to get up close and personal with that thing if I'm ever gonna capture it. - That's suicide. - Tell me about it. I have an idea. You're gonna hate this idea but... Tell me. Anything. Right now. All right. I say we ask Leon for help. - No, no! - Why? Sam! We wants to help us. He knows things. - He's an escaped soul, too. - You brought him?! What? He waited in the car, he's fine. Listen, listen, Leon. Leon, just tell him what you told me. Go. I was just saying, I think I know this "butcher" guy. He used to hang with some friends of mine. Right, right. All the bazillio of people in hell, and you knew this guy. The one guy we're looking for. Sam, I can tell you're under a lot of stress, and that must be difficult for you-- Stop talking! Why do you listen to this guy, huh? Why? Do you have a better plan, Sam? Sam, maybe we should really consider letting him help us. I mean, maybe he really is rehabilitated. - Man, come on. - Even god forgives sins. I mean, and if you're truly repentant. If you're truly changed, I mean, is it fair that you spend an eternity in hell? I can't believe-- I can't believe this. Leon has to go back to hell. Okay? Period. Excuse me! Hi! I need somebody to take this soul! Can you, uh-- Can you send someone up please? No? No, hey, listen. I need--I need somebody to take this soul. I'm gonna kill him! Can you get the devil for me please? I just need to talk to the devil. What are you doing? No. Have ever you thought about some anti-anxiet medications, Sam, or yoga, or maybe journaling? - I mean, that's-- - Shut up. What the... Well, don't look so surprised. You're the one that wanted to talk to me. Can you-- Can you go? Oh, please with the modesty. I'm like a doctor, Sam, it all looks like you awe meat to me. Hey, listen, as a friend, I got to tell you, you're losing it, man. Take him to hell. Please. Take him away. There's nobody down there to give him to. You just have to wait until Halloween's over like everybody else. Just one more day. Well, can't you just hold on to him then till then ? - What's the big rush? - He won't stop talking. He's making me fight with my friends. I just--I really need him to go away. How's the girl? - She's not talking to me. - That's what I thought. Sam... if I can impart to you one piece of knowledge, just one kernel of truth that I've gleaned over the entirety of my existence, it would be this: Betrayal is the defining trait of humanity. Your friends will always let you down. The girl will always leave. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. And your so-called friends are proving my point. You're not angry at Leon. You're just upset because you're realizing the weakness of your species. The most untrustworthy, unreliable creatures on this earth... except for bears. I know this is a hard lesson for you to take, and I'm sorry I have to be the one to teach you. But it's best you understand now. You know, in a way, I'm the most trustworthy person you know. And that's just sad. No. Goody. Midnight. Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween! Scare up some savings at the Bench. You want a scare--no, you don't want to scare up... - Hey, Andi. - Hey. - You on break? - Uh, no. Ted wants you to go to the loading dock when you're done here to help with a shipment. Ok. Great. Wait! Uh... Are you going to any Halloween parties tonight? 'Cause I was thinking... You know, I think that we should just talk about work stuff. Only. From now on. Uh, yeah. Yeah, great. Yes. Let's talk about work. Tonight, have a couple beers. I can practice my sales pitch on air conditioner filters. I think it might change the way you look at the world. No, Sam. Work talk should stay at work. Because those are the new rules. I... I think those rules are stupid. Ok. Well... It's not about what you think, Sam. Why not? Andi! Why not?! Son of a bitch. Sock! Leon's gone! He got out! Ok, ok. Don't be mad. All right? Hands up. Hi, Sam. Did I scare you? Say him you're sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here to help. Take it easy! Hey! Guys, guys! Everything's cool here. Everything's cool. No, no everything is cool! What is wrong with you? Sam, I said don't be mad. And I said, do not to touch him! See, guys, when you play the blame game, nobody wins. Stop, stop, stop with the stupid therapy crap, ok?! Sam, he is trying to help us. Ok, Sock, Sock, my man. Listen, I am Sam's responsibility. Hey, you know what? How about-- how about - I prove myself to you? - How are you going to do that? Well, you know, this guy that you're after, mainly attacks at night. My theory is, he's a day sleeper. - So? - So, you find him during the day when he's sleeping, the element of surprise. Boom, you've got him. And you know what? If I'm wrong, if I'm wrong, I'll go get back in that vessel myself. Ok? No complaints, and if I'm right... Well, we're work out, you know, what my reward is. I'm bringing the vessel. One stupid move and you're going back inside. I'm... Let's go for a ride. So... you guys been friends a long time? Guys, this makes me sad. I feel like I'm the source of all this conflict. Can you please just stop talking? You know, I just--I just feel like--oh, here it is. It's coming up right up here. A chinese restaurant? The soul is at a chinese restaurant? It's not that easy. I mean, I got to, you know, talk to my people, find out where he is. And--and, um... I should probably go in alone, you know, being seen with hell's bounty hunter might be a little bad on my street cred. You understand? Right? All right. Hey, Leon, grab me some mu shu, will ya? Leon! Never mind! I'll just starve. This is ridiculous. I'm going in. No, no, no, no, no, hey! Listen, if he wanted to escape, he would've as soon as I let him out of the vessel. Just sit tight. He's trying to help us. Trust me. No, Sock. Clearly, I can't trust you. Why--why will you not just give him a chance? You didn't let him out to give him a chance. You let him out because you thought he was funny. All right, ok, maybe that did play into my decision on that, all right? But I just think-- no, Sock, don't think! Ok? You never think! You play with a hula doll and almost get us killed! You spend more energy trying to fit 75 gumballs into your mouth than help me! It's not cute anymore, ok? It was a hundred gumballs. 100. Oh, god. Leon needs a nap. Where's the butcher? Uh, oh. You know how to get to the pleasure pit? - The strip club? - Yes, sir. I got a hot tip. Oh, I hate the way you squeak through your nose when you breathe. The stuff you put in your hair makes you smell like a pixie's ass. Your mutant pinky toe. Your one bushy eyebrow. I hate the way you put ketchup on macaroni and cheese everytime you eat it. Oh, and you wear mandles. You said the mandles were ok. I lied, Sam. Mandles are never okay. I was being nice. Hey, guys. Guys, you got one more stop. We are really close, and, oh, um, could we drop off Cinnamon? - Her place is on the way. - Hi, guys. You know, I think I'm gonna catch the next soul on my own. I think that's a great idea. Good. Good. Ohh. Oh, yeah, hey. I got a line on him. Bring the vessel. It's going down. - Well, we're here. - Are you kidding me? You took us all over town to bring us back here?! I told you, I had to talk to some-- We've already been here, Leon! We know this place. I am such an idiot! Follow me. Ha ha! Boom! How'd you know about this place? I told you. I know people. Oh, man. He's there. All right. Let's do this. Do you have a flashlight? Of course. Dude, what are you doing? This is not about you, Sock. So, I'm still going to hell after all this is over? Leon, put the gun down, man. You know I have to send you back, Leon. Ok. Hand over the vessel. - What? - Whoa, whoa. Slow down. - This is nuts. Ok? - Hand it over! And now, get in the hole. - That thing will kill us, Leon. - No, not you. Just the bounty hunter. - Leon, you don't want to do this. - I know I don't. That's why I'm going to let dog boy do it for me. Sock, come on, stop messing around. Listen, did you really think I was going to let you put my best friend down that hole by himself? What are you doing? No, if Sam goes in, I'm going in. - Sock, don't. - Sam, just stop. Sock, that is... That's a really beautiful gesture. You're really decent, but... really stupid. - All right, ok. - Ok. Take it easy. Boy, my therapist... is going to be really disappointed in me. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna hug you, ok? - Yeah, ok. - Like a man hug? Yeah, that'd be nice. - Sock? - Yeah? What are you-- are you feeling my ass? - No. No. - What are you doing? There's something in the backpack. Do you think it'll work on that thing? Ahh! I don't know! Let's chuck it, chuck it! Throw it! Sock! Are you all right? Sam! Sam! - Sock? - Yeah! I'm fine. I found the vessel! Throw it! Throw it to me! Sam! Sock! Spike! Good dog! Sam! Oh, god! That was incredible! Holy. That was too close. Are you ok? Oh, it's just a flesh wound. You? I think so. I'm really glad you didn't get eaten by the dog monster. Yeah. I'm glad you didn't get eaten. All right. Let's get out quickly. Come on. What are you doing carrying me? I tell you, as soon as I get my leg sewn back on, I am treating you to a big frosty beer product. Wait. What about Leon? Don't worry about that guy. I know exactly where that little traitor is. So my father says, "why can't you act be more like your brother?" Which that--ohh. That just hurt. You know? That hurt because... my brother ends up being an opium addict, so, you know, that didn't work out very well for him. Plus, every time-- Hello? Oh, no. Ok. Security says someone is trying to break into my car. Let me just check on it. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. No rush.  No rush. Guys! Guys! Hey! Guys, guys! Hey! Oh, wow! Oh, you're alive! That's great! How's therapy, Leon? Therapy? Uh... it's a process. Huh. Process. Yeah. You got a lot of issues, man. I do, I do! You know, and it's weird, because I'm genuinely-- I'm genuinely happy that all of you guys are alive. Then, you know, I'm sad because I'm going back to hell. So I'm carrying around all these conflicting emotions. I'm carrying around seven stitches. I wonder what's worse. Oh, yeah. I guess-- Not this time, bro. Good one. Ok. Here's how it's going to play, all right? You let me go, and I don't blow your friend's face off. You're not going to do that, Leon. You couldn't do it before. And you're not going to do it now. You've been going to therapy. Working hard on yourself. You really want your therapist to come in here and find two dead bodies on the floor? Oh! Sam. Put the gun down, Leon. You're not that person anymore. Yeah, ok. You're right. You got me. I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't really want to blow your face off. No problem. I did really want to break your wrist though. Still might. I'm starting to think I need the structure of hell for a little while longer. You know? I'm gonna work on myself down there for real. Maybe go freudian this time. Five sessions a week. I'm gonna make you proud, guys. We'll miss you, Leon. Shh. It's our turn. Hey, Gladys, you look... rough. Good vacation? We party hard in the underworld. Oh, woman, please. We need to party together. Place the vessel on the mat. Yeah, um... Can you take good care of it? Or that, either way. This is fairwell! And not good-bye! I made a mistake. I totally admit that, and I have apologized for that, - on numerous occasions. - Sam-- I'm not finished. You and I started out as friends, and even if you don't think it was real, I did. I still do. So you have to forgive me, because one mistake is not enough to just throw everything away. Everybody screws up. I will, you will, and I'll probably, definitely do it again. But I miss what we had and I'm not gonna let it go that easily. So... You practice that speech? Yeah, I did. In my car. - Good acoustics. - It was good. You usually don't take a stand like that. You're right. You're absolutely right. You deserve better. Good, great! I got to be honest with you. I was completely miserable. I just can't stand being in a fight. I'm so bad at it. I don't know, you're pretty effective with the whole silent treatment. Yeah, but I have a stomachache all day. So... What should we do? We do what friends do. We, um... Get a beer after work tonight? Ok. Yeah, that sounds really good. All right. Yeah, all right. Yes! - Hey! - You look happy. Oh, I am. Halloween is over. My demons are back in hell torturing the damned. All is right with the underworld. All right. Is this gonna take long? Ted wants me to get back, take care of some thanksgiving stuff. I just wanted to see my favorite employee. You know, you were the only one of the lot of them who actually did his job these last few days. I'm touched, Sam. Great. Why don't you and I go out on the town tonight? Huh? - We'll get a limo. - Can't. I've got plans with Andi. Andi who isn't talking to you? Andi? She is now. All right. Tomorrow night then. Meeting Sock. Yeah. All that crap you said about humanity and betrayal and stuff? You're totally wrong about that. - Am I? - Yeah. You are really negative, you know? It warps the way you see the world. You should think about that a little. Maybe... talk to somebody. Professionally. Anyway, I'm gonna go. Good talk. Sam, I invented therapy. Ok? So that the wicked could justify their actions. I'm starting to be able to figure out when you're lying, as well. Thanks to Raceman
