WELL,IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. HEY,HOW ABOUT HELPING SAM OUT OF HIS DEAL WITH THE DEVIL? WELL,THAT'S A... THAT IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER. YOU KNOW,I MEAN,ONCE YOU SELL YOUR SOUL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A ROCK SOLID DEAL. I CAN'T THINK OF HOW ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN BREAK THAT. YEAH,BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN SELL HIS SOUL. HIS PARENTS DID. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. ANDI,MY DAD'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE CONTRACT FOR MONTHS. IF THERE WAS A WAY OUT OF THIS, HE WOULD'VE FOUND IT. WELL,MAYBE TONY CAN LOOK AT IT. WILL YOU? YES,YES,SURE, -BRING IT ON BY AND I'LL TAKE A GANDER. -GREAT. HERE WE GO. TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE. WE PUT THESE TOGETHER WITH PHOTOSHOP. SEE? THERE'S OUR FAKE WEDDING. FAKE APPLE PICKING.

BENJAMIN,WE NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE US. OTHERWISE,IF THEY DON'T, YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL AND I'M GONNA GET KICKED OUT OF THE COUNTRY. I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN. SO STOP YOUR WHINING AND GET YOUR SHIRT OFF,NOW. FINE. BUT NO FULL FRONTAL. WELL,LET'S JUST SEE HOW IT GOES,ALL RIGHT? HOLD IT. -HEY,SAM. -OUT ALREADY? YEAH,I JUST STAYED DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO WORK ON MY TAN. -WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -I CAME TO GET YOU. NOT "GET YOU" LIKE A MONSTER. GET YOU TO GO OUT. OUT WHERE? I SUGGEST CLUB RENDEZVOUS FOR TONIGHT. THE LADIES THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE. MAYBE TOMORROW WE'LL HIT THE GADABOUT ROOM. IT'S A SATURDAY NIGHT INSTITUTION. WHY WOULD I GO OUT WITH YOU? BECAUSE IT'S FUN. BECAUSE I LIKE YOU. AND BECAUSE WITH ME AS YOUR WINGMAN, YOU'LL BE SWIMMING IN SWEETIES WITHIN THE HOUR. DO YOU OWN A TIE? LISTEN,IF I DON'T BRING YOU IN, THE DEVIL WILL KILL ME. I'M SORRY. IT'S MY JOB. AND I RESPECT THAT. BUT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL REASON THE DEVIL'S OUT TO GET ME? JEALOUSY. HE WATCHES GUYS LIKE US OUT THERE ENJOYING OURSELVES. BUT WHAT DOES HE ENJOY? UH,MAKING PEOPLE MISERABLE. EXACTLY. BECAUSE DEEP DOWN HE'S MISERABLE. HE WOULDN'T KNOW A GOOD TIME IF IT BIT HIM ON THE ASS. HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF FUN. HE'S A FUN SUCKER. THINK ABOUT IT. I MEAN,WHAT'S MY CRIME? I LOVE WOMEN. THEY LOVE ME. IT DOESN'T MAKE ME A SINNER,SAM. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS THIS IS YOU. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO CATCH YOU WHEN I GET THE VESSEL.

LOT OF LIMBS RENT FROM A LOT OF TORSOS. BUT EVERYBODY STARTED SINGING LIKE CANARIES. NOW HELL IS SEALED TIGHT AS A DRUM. AND NOW,IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THERE'S A DEMON ABOUT PITCHFORK DEEP IN MIKE'S ASS AS WE SPEAK. MIKE WAS JUST IN MY ELEVATOR. NOT NOW,WINSTON. NOT NOW. I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU,SAMMY. I HAVE SOME SERIOUS EGG ON MY FACE. YOU KNOW,I'M STARTING TO FEEL THAT MAYBE TORTURE ISN'T THE WAY TO GET WHAT YOU WANT,YOU KNOW? LIKE MAYBE PEOPLE JUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR SO THAT YOU STOP PULLING OUT THEIR FINGERNAILS. I DON'T GET IT. -WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH THIS GUY. -I'M NOT OBSESSED. I SIMPLY DEMAND A MODICUM OF RESPECT FROM THE SOULS IN MY DOMAIN. I WON'T BE DISSED,SAM. BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU, HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE THAT BAD OF A GUY. THAT'S HOW IT BEGINS,SEE? "HE'S NOT THAT BAD OF A GUY. -ALL HE'S DOING IS CHASING TAIL AND HAVING FUN." -WELL,YEAH. AND WHILE YOU'RE STANDING THERE DEVELOPING YOUR MAN CRUSH, YOU COMPLETELY IGNORE THE DESTRUCTION HE CAUSES. -WHAT DESTRUCTION? -WHAT DESTRUCTION? WHAT DESTRUCTION,SAM? THIS IS WHERE I CAUGHT MIKE. IS HE HERE? NO. HE DOESN'T NEED TO COME BACK. THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. JAMES AND LUELLA CARVER LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FOR ABOUT AS LONG AS THEY WERE MARRIED. 24 YEARS. HAPPY,SOLID YEARS. YOU KNOW,THEY NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED BEING UNFAITHFUL TO ONE ANOTHER.NOT ONCE. THAT IS UNTIL MIKE VOLTA ENTERED THE PICTURE AND SET HIS SITES ON LUELLA. THIS IS WHAT MIKE VOLTA DOES. HE TAKES LOVE AND COMMITMENT AND DESTROYS IT EVERY CHANCE HE GETS. BUT,HEY,OTHER THAN THAT HE'S A GREAT GUY,RIGHT? I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. I WANT HIM BACK,SAM. NO MORE EXCUSES. I'VE NEVER SEEN A FAMILY ALBUM WITH SO MUCH NUDITY. IT'S,UM,JARRING. GOT TO KEEP THINGS FRESH,HAVEN'T YOU? SO,SARA,HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

EXPECT TO BE IN FRONT OF A JUDGE MONDAY MORNING. YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE HOME MONDAY NIGHT. AND YOU WILL BE IN JAIL. THANKS FOR THE LAUGH. SAM'S BEEN IN THERE A WHILE. -HOPE EVERYTHING'S GOING OK. -YEAH. THINK MIKE WILL BE AT THE CLUB TONIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WORTH A SHOT. -SAM SAID IT'S ONE OF HIS FAVS,SO AWAY WE GO. -ALL RIGHT.

I OWE HER THAT MUCH. COMING IN,GLADYS. SAM. I'M GONNA HAVE MY BUDDY LOOK AT THAT CONTRACT RIGHT AWAY. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BREAK THIS DEAL WITH THE DEVIL. I PROMISE. THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT NEWS. OK,GUYS,COME ON. EULOGY TIME. HERE LIES GLADYS. AND SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. OH,THE GODDESS OF THE DMV. WAIT A SECOND. SHE A DEMON? YEAH. YEAH,SHE'S THE ONE THE DEVIL'S BEEN LOOKING FOR. THE SOUL KILLED HER. REALLY? JUST A SECOND. UH! THERE WE GO. WHAT DID YOU DO? SHE'LL BE FINE. MORTAL WEAPONS,THEY CAN'T KILL US. GLADYS? AH! AAH! WHOA! WHOA! THANKS. NO PROBLEM. GLADYS,THE DEVIL KNOWS SOMEONE'S HELPING MIKE ESCAPE. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE FINDS OUT IT'S YOU. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. WHERE IS HE? DON'T HAVE A CLUE. AND I WOULDN'T TELL YOU IF I DID KNOW. THANKS FOR NOT BURYING ME ALIVE. GLADYS,JUST TELL ME ONE THING. WHY RISK IT ALL FOR THAT JERK? I MEAN,HE TRIED TO KILL YOU. YOU DESERVE BETTER. I JUST GOT TIRED OF BEING LONELY. NEXT. CAN I HELP YOU? YES,I BELIEVE YOU CAN. HELLO,GLADYS. YOU KNOW,I HEAR THAT CONFESSING ONE'S SINS IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL. FIRST OFF,YOU'RE A COMPLETE MORON TO EVEN BE IN THIS SITUATION. NO ONE DISPUTES THAT I AM A MORON. I TRIED TO STOP HIM,BABY. NO,YOU DIDN'T. NO,I DIDN'T. YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE. YOU'RE GONNA BE CHARGED,THERE'S NO AVOIDING THAT, BUT IF YOU PAY THE FINE,YOU MIGHT AVOID JAIL TIME. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE? UH... NONE. I DO HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH 2,000 BUCKS. NO,NO,HE DOESN'T. NO. WHY ARE YOU TELLING HER THAT,BENZINE? YOU'VE BEEN SAVING THAT MONEY FOR FORMULA ONE RACING SCHOOL. REMEMBER? THAT IS YOUR DREAM. THAT IS OUR DREAM. YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE THAN TWO GRAND. TRY DOUBLE THAT. OH,I GUESS I CAN BORROW THE REST FROM MY GRANDMA. YOU COULD. WILL THIS COVER SARA,TOO? SARA HAS NO CHANCE. THEY'RE GONNA DEPORT HER. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HER. HEY. HEH HEH. GOT YOU A PRETZEL. I'M BEING DEPORTED,AREN'T I? I'M SO SORRY, AND IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I HAVE TO PAY A HUGE FINE. I KIND OF FIGURED THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AND I MADE ALTERNATE ARRANGEMENTS. I HAD A VERY CANDID DISCUSSION WITH OUR IMMIGRATION OFFICER. HE HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT A B-R-I-B-E. A BRIBE? IF WE PAY HIM,HE IS WILLING TO 'LOSE' THE FILE. I DON'T GET KICKED OUT OF THE COUNTRY, YOU DON'T GO TO JAIL. OK,BUT WOULDN'T THAT BE DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL TO COVER UP SOMETHING ILLEGAL? I MEAN- MM-HMM. SURE. I MEAN,IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY YOUR LITTLE FINE AND JUST THROW ME TO THE WOLVES? THERE ARE NO WOLVES. THEY'LL JUST BE SENDING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO MANCHESTER,BEN? SMOKE STACKS. CROWDS. BLEAK. ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR ME TO LOOK FORWARD TO THERE IS MY OLD STOOL IN MY FATHER'S MUSLIN PLANT. THAT'S RIGHT. MUSLIN. IF WE POOL OUR MONEY TOGETHER, WE CAN PERSUADE HIM TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE? I CAN GET 2,000 RIGHT AWAY,BUT- WITH MY 3,THAT MAKES $5,000, WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A BRIBE,RIGHT? BEN... I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY,SWEETHEART. EVER SINCE YOU AGREED TO HELP ME OUT, I COULD SEE THAT YOU WERE VERY SPECIAL. SO SELFLESS,SO READY TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE OUT AND SO RARE. WITH ALL THIS IMMIGRATION BUSINESS, I KIND OF LOST SIGHT OF THAT. FORGIVE ME? SURE. IT'S FANTASTIC. I'LL NEED THE MONEY BY 5. OH,CASH ONLY,PLEASE. SAM,SAM,LOOK. Sam: HEY. HI. GLADYS,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR MIKE, THERE'S A CHURCH OUT ON RANGE ROAD. HE'LL BE THERE TONIGHT AT 5. WHY? HE LIKES TO CRASH WEDDINGS AND SLIP IT TO THE BLUSHING BRIDE. CLASS ACT. WHY ARE YOU TELLING US THIS NOW? YOU WERE NICER TO ME THAN MIKE EVER WAS. THIS IS MY CAT,FANCY. IF YOU'D LOOK AFTER HIM,I'D GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. HE HAS A SKIN CONDITION, SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SQUEEZE HIS PUSTULES EVERY NOW AND THEN. YEAH. GLADYS,WHAT HAPPENED? I'VE BEEN REASSIGNED. BACK DOWN TO HEAD OFFICE. NO. NO. SAM. WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. I MEAN,YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT? I DUNNO,TALK TO THE DEVIL. GET HIM TO LET HER GO. NO,ANDI. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT ASKING THE DEVIL FOR A FAVOR IS A BAD IDEA. BESIDES,GLADYS IS A DEMON. I BET SHE HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS IN HELL. THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL FOR HER. YOU THINK? SHE'LL BE FINE. BUT I COULD BE WRONG. THE CEREMONY SHOULD START ANY MINUTE MIKE'S PROBABLY KNEE-DEEP IN SOME HONEYMOON BY NOW. LET'S GET IN THERE. HEY. Sam: WHOA,WHOA,WHOA. YOU LOOK AMAZING. WHAT'S WITH THE FANCY PANTS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU TOLD ME DRESS UP. I DID NOT. YES,YOU DID. WHAT,YOU GUYS COULDN'T EVEN WEAR ONE OF YOUR TUXEDO T-SHIRTS? I MEAN,I KNOW EACH ONE OF YOU HAS ONE. ACTUALLY,THERE'S JUST THE ONE. WE SHARE. IT'S A ROTATION. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST DO THIS. ALL RIGHT. HI. HELLO. UH,NO. SORRY. I SAW "WEDDING CRASHERS" AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN. OK. SORRY. THAT'S IT? THAT WAS YOUR BIG PLAN? HE SAW THE MOVIE. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHAT? ALL RIGHT. PLAN B TIME. SET THE JOINT ON FIRE,SMOKE 'EM OUT. SPLIT UP,CIRCLE AROUND THE BUILDING, FIND ANOTHER ENTRANCE. MY PLAN B WAS BETTER. HEY,DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE BRIDE ANYWHERE? UH,YEAH. ACTUALLY,SHE- SHE JUST RAN UP THAT WAY. UH... MIKE? Man: ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT ME. BUT TELL ME. ISN'T THE BRIDE JUST GLOWING? MIKE? JUST COME OUT. MAKE IT EASY. Mike: HOW 'BOUT YOU RECONSIDER MY OFFER? YOU AND ME NEED TO JUST GET CRAZY AND HAVE SOME FUN TOGETHER FOR ONCE. YOU KILL PEOPLE,MIKE. YOU TRIED TO KILL GLADYS. AH,COME ON. I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T DIE. YEAH,WELL,SHE GOT SENT BACK TO HELL. REALLY? TOO BAD I WON'T BE JOINING HER. YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT SHUTTER FINGER,SAM. HOW MANY FLASHES DO YOU HAVE LEFT? CRAP. YEAH,YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT MY WAY, BUT YOU HAD TO BE A HERO. I USUALLY WORK ALONE,SAM, BUT WE MIGHT'VE MADE A GOOD TEAM,YOU AND ME. YEAH,I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU DO. I'VE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES. BUT SAM,THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THE BEST PART. THE MOURNING AND SUFFERING OF HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR LOVED ONES CRYING OVER YOU. THAT HOT,LITTLE GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS, I BET SHE'LL NEED A LOT OF COMFORTING,SAM. A LOT. ALMOST,SAM. SO CLOSE. NO MORE FLASHES LEFT. AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE ME,YOU CAN'T CATCH ME. IF I WAS A NICE GUY,I'D MAKE THIS QUICK. BUT I AM NOT NICE. OHH! BOY. I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. HUH. CAMERA REALLY DOES ADD 10 POUNDS. IT'S SARA. MAYBE SHE'S GOT AN UPDATE. HEY,WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD? DID HE TAKE THE BRIBE? HELLO,MY DARLING. YEAH,HI. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IMMIGRATION? OH,NO. THIS IS VERY AWKWARD. THERE WAS NO BRIBE. I MADE IT UP. WHAT? WHY? WELL,I'M AFRAID I'VE GONE "ON THE LAM," AS THEY SAY. BUT YOU HAVE MY MONEY AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEND ME TO JAIL. BEN,WE DID TRY TO DEFRAUD YOUR GOVERNMENT. WE BOTH KNEW THERE WAS A RISK OF IMPRISONMENT,DIDN'T WE? THANK YOU,DARLING. BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE GOING TO JAIL. BEN,YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? JAIL WOULD ACTUALLY BE VERY,VERY GOOD FOR YOU. YOU NEED TOUGHENING UP. YOU'RE VERY EASILY DUPED. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT TO HOP. BUT LISTEN TO ME. VERY GOOD LUCK TO YOU. AND PLEASE KNOW THAT IN MY HEART, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY FIRST HUSBAND. I LEFT YOU SOME MAC AND CHEESE IN THE FRIDGE. YOU WEREN'T GONNA EAT THIS,WERE YOU? NO. GO AHEAD. I'M NOT HUNGRY. WE HAVE A PROBLEM. DON'T TELL ME THAT,KENNETH. I PROMISED SAM THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF THIS DEAL. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS KID? WELL... PRETTY WELL. WHY? SOMEONE WENT THROUGH THIS AND VERY CAREFULLY REMOVED EVERY PAGE THAT REFERENCES WHO SAM'S FATHER IS. WELL,THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? MY GUESS,TO HIDE THE IDENTITY OF SAM'S REAL FATHER. WELL,WHO IS IT? YOU KNOW,FOR A GIRL TAKING HER MAN TO THE JOINT, YOU ARE REFRESHINGLY UNDERSTANDING.
