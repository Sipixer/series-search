A liaison working with other departments, agencies, outside help. Psychics. You got to do something quick! I can't hold it for long! - I accept. - Excuse me? The job, the job you offered me, Karen... I accept. It's great to be back. I'm warning you guys. Gus knows karate. - I don't know karate. - Yes, you do. I study wushu. It's Chinese. Dude, trust me. Karate sounds more intimidating. I've only had two lessons. 2 more lessons than they've had. Come on, man. My dad wouldn't let me take karate, so now you got to do this. You do it. I don't fire people well. - You wanted the assistant. - I wanted a girl. He's the only one that would take the job, Shawn. What does that say about us? We'll do good cop/bad cop. - Who's bad cop? - You. You're the unscrupulous boss with a chip on your shoulder. I'm the nurturing-confidant type, who's like, "dude, Gus is a jerk, "but I've got your back. Together we'll take that sucker down." Together, then. Fine. Ken! And it turns out business is just a little slower than expected. You guys hired me four days ago. Much slower. The thing is, my dad got a job at the police station, right? So we assumed that we'd get more cases. He assumed. I called this from a mile away. Exactly. Wait. - Holy crap, you're doing good cop. - I know. - Did somebody move my desk? - I didn't see anyone. How many days a week are you here? Two, three, depends. I just deal with the consultants. - But you don't tell me what to do. - I'm not sure. I am. You don't. Think of it like Santa Barbara's having a slow news day, - but with murder and stuff. - And like the real-estate market, - crime will always trend upwards. - The only thing we know for sure, it's gonna pick up. And that real estate is a sound long-term investment. But mostly that crime's gonna pick up. And that's a guarantee. Excuse me, Mr. Chiang. Can I get a photo of you and your family for the <i>Santa Barbara Courier</i>? Ladies and gentlemen, please have your raffle tickets ready</i> when entering the Chinatown festival.</i> Psych 501 "Romeo and Juliet and Juliet" Timing: Psych Team She didn't come back on Monday? Not yet. Just let our people do their work. If and when we get the ransom call, we will determine our course of action. Mr. Chiang... I'm the resident psychic here. My name is Shawn Spencer. This is my partner Jonathan Jacob Jingly Smith. You're saying his name is John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? That's correct, sir. We used to share the name. I changed mine because of all the people shouting when I went out. I don't remember calling you, Mr. Spencer. Didn't have to, chief. This case called me. - It called collect. - Right, which was odd, because I'm also on Twitter, and the cases usually tweet me. Now, let's be honest, chief. Kidnapping is my thing. This case is tailor-made for a psychic. I guess it does make a little bit of sense. You called Shawn in? - The case called me. - Collect. Naturally, this is your call, Henry. You now oversee our consultants. So this would officially be your first hire. Okay, then. My answer is no. What? May I speak to you in private? What the hell was that about? It's my job to determine if we need a consultant, and right now I don't see the need for one. You have had 5 opportunities to hire us. Now, what is this really about? - Do you know "persona non grata"? - Why are we talking about food? There's a reason they created the position I'm in. You burned a lot of bridges around here. You made a lot of sloppy mistakes. You're must to earn your way back. Things are gonna be different. - So unfair. - Is it? My results speak for themselves. You hold me to a different standard. I do not. - You buried my easter eggs. - I left loose dirt to indicate a dig. Yeah, under a camouflaged tarp covered with bricks and broken glass. That was the giveaway! Pardon me for trying to challenge you. It took me three weeks "to close" the egg investigation. I was eight. Just so you know, there's still two eggs you haven't found. You're sick. Well? What happened? Two things... One, we're getting him fired. - Two, we're on the case. - You convinced him to hire us? Define convinced. Have we searched the girl's apartment? - They just finished. - We'll need that address. - You guys got hired on the case. - Define hired. The police have already been here. She was kidnapped far from here. It's been hours, Gus. Still no ransom demand. I'm telling you, this is not your standard kidnapping. God, everything's so neat. - Maybe she's a neat person. - Or maybe she's hiding something. Look at this closet. It's full of new purchases. Please tell me we're taking that to the police. We are... Just not the ones working this case. - Bring that to Lassiter. - What would be the fun in that? I want you for this. - Chief wouldn't hire you guys, huh? - I got case-blocked by my own father. Don't you think it's time you got back up on the horse? It's a temporary reassignment. It's pretty common for cops when they experience something traumatic. I know the whole Yin thing was difficult for everybody, but at this point, it just feels like you're hiding here at this giant post office. - It's city hall, Shawn. - We have a city hall? I just need a little time. And I am perfectly content staying off of this case. Really? Did you know there's no ransom note? Did you know that Bekki Chiang stands to inherit approximately $20 million and is already being groomed for an ambassadorship at 19? Not my case. It's Lassiter's. It's an old Hong Kong 50-cent piece. - Which dynasty? - 1978. Look at that. Somebody's helping already There is one other thing. It's counterfeit. A smart rich girl with a secret holding on to counterfeit money? And just what are you doing here? The mayor asked to see me. - e don't believe that. - You're free to believe what you want. Don't say that to Gus. He'll tell you that Michael Jackson isn't dead. - He learned how to fake his death. - Which implies that Elvis is alive. Elvis died two years ago. Is there no end to your gullibility? I told you that two years ago. He was a cashier in a shoe shop. I'm not having this conversation with you now or ever. We're not sure what the deal with the wrapping on the hand is. And he leapt a wall into the crowd, so he's athletic. Kept his face covered the whole time. Couldn't get a clear shot of him. He knew there were cameras there. Carlton, I have a lot of work to do here, so if you wouldn't mind... My god, we're on the same page. You were trying to lure her out of this dungeon by using details. I am not. See, it's not just me. You're concerned about her insisting on staying down here... The unreturned phone calls and the ever-so-slight darkening of the hair. - I hadn't noticed. - I like it. Now, would you guys please just leave me alone? Way to go, Spencer. You are not on this case. What? Lassie, we've clearly crossed a threshold. Tomorrow we should wear jumpsuits... Nay, t-shirts. I'll be thing one. You be thing two. - Excuse me. - Wait. Before you go, one question... Who would counterfeit a 50-cent piece, - Honk Kong, 978 dynasty? - 1978. Ooh, that makes so much more sense. You can't seriously tell me you think the triads are involved in this? - Athletes. - Chinese gangs. - Athletic gangs of Chinese men. - Very serious gangs. - How do we speak with these triads? - You don't speak with them. - I need to make an appointment. - There are different gangs within the triads. What triad are we talking about? The golden? - The dragon? - Regular. We're primarily interested in medium. - Venti. - Venti is large. Well, then not venti. We'll speak with both gangs. No. Spencer, you will stay away from these people. They are legitimately dangerous, those gangs are on the verge of war for years. Now, if you'll excuse me, the free information train has left the station. Figure it all out for yourself. Please. Like we can't do that. - We need information. - Wait. You aren't here to paymy last day? - I believe I did pay. - We didn't pay. We paid him in gratitude and life lessons. I shouldn't have opened this door. Don't think of it as not being paid. Think of it as a surprise two-year vacation. - Unpaid. - We'll hire you back someday. Probably not soon. Why are you guys here? We need information on counterfeiting Hong Kong coins. And the Chinese mafia. We need you to explain the ending of crouching tiger, hidden dragon to us. What? You guys think that 'cause I'm Asian, I'm supposed to know all this stuff. That's borderline racist. - No. - Racist. No, I hardly think so. - Inappropriate? Insulting? Stereotype? - Yes. Sure. - Not racist. - Maybe a little racist. Gus, please. Now, Ken, how many triads do you know, and/or are you one of them? That definitely crossed the line. Just tell us what you know, and we will get out of your parents' house. Okay, the only thing I can think of is there's this place where the golden triad used to hang out. The only reason I know that is because my mother used to forbid me to go there. Gus, all I'm saying is that sometimes your jokes don't land. Okay, Shawn, you want to impose some restrictions on me, then I want to go over some rules too. What rules? In the past, you've offered me up as some sort of sacrificial lamb - to the situation. - Name one. Wait. Never mind. You're right. New rule... from now on, any cover story or fake I.D. Must be run past me - and approved. - Approved? In writing three days in advance. - Gus, you're kidding? - No. I need the proper amount of time to concoct my alter ego That best complements yours and the situation. - Don't know where I'll live in 3 days. - That's the deal. Take it or leave it. So he is a pharmaceutical salesman Who moonlights at a psychic Detective agency, And once at camp, he wet his pants. - Water splashed on my pants. - I'm sorry. You guys are cops? Nope, not cops, though sometimes we work with cops And occasionally against them. If this was Saturday, I'd have a better story. Right now all I want to do is talk to some triads. Either kind. You guys know you're gonna get killed. You're absolutely right. What were we thinking? Gus? Yes. See what I mean? See what you mean? We got lucky. We have been following this guy. If he's a triad, He is the most boring gang member of all time. I think Ken gave us a fake lead to pay you back for asking him for a loan. It was a loan with interest. The interest was life lessons, Shawn. Those are some heavy firearms. Something's going down. Run back to the psych office, grab our ninja costumes. How could that possibly help us? - We'll need to get closer. - No, we are staying here. Ten seconds ago, you were complaining about being bored. Now, it's too exciting? It'd be great to get some consistency from you emotionally. If something illegal is going on, it's our duty to call Lassie and let him get shot. - Golden triads cut off hands. - One at a time, which, technically, - means we have four opportunities. - I'm not moving. They won't even know we're here. I blame you. He said something about taking us to the boss. If only I had time to submit a fake identity. Dont mock me when I'm about to die. You know I bond with authority. This is a win for us. I will talk my way out. - How? - You know how much I love Yao ming. - That's got to count for something. - Just leave me out of this. Okay, first of all, this is some sort of huge misunderstanding. I know and respect that you are a very busy man. Running a crime syndicate is a full-time job. And we do not want to bother you any more than we have to. Mr. Chiang. I know you. You're the psychic from the police station. Yes. That's correct. - They hired us on this case. - The chief said they did not. - I don't know why she'd say that. - She said it to you. Yes, she did. Chief. That's a little act we do to throw people off. To throw who off? Mr. Chiang, I found this coin in your daughter's apartment. It was hidden. My fear is that she's mixed up with some pretty nasty criminals. This is my coin. I gave it to her to symbolize our past. Now, I will say this to you. And I will speak slowly so you understand. She's not mixed up in any of this. This... Criminal activity? What you think you see here is not criminal. It seems pretty criminal to me. Our mistake. It's just a handful of buddies hanging out, taking some surveillance photos and carrying semiautomatic weapons. You have an idea of who took your daughter. - I do not. - And you wouldn't lie to me. You're a psychic. You tell me. Are we free to go? All right. There was a curlicue thing here, but the whole thing looks like a dragon. I know this, 'cause I saw something like it at a panda express. Can you tell us what it is or not? - Dude, my parents run a best buy. - I told you. - About the best buy? - I told you he would be offended. - He's not offended. - I am very offended. He's excited. He's getting a taste of the action that you and I get into, if we hadn't had to let him go. Do you realize that I've done more work for you since you fired me? Yes, we do. Have you seen this dragon? I probably saw something like that spray-painted on a wall. - Where? - Chinatown. - What? - Where in Chinatown? A martial arts studio. Why does this have orange chicken sauce all over it? It got me in the mood for some panda express. Can you tell us what this is? Dragon triads. Shawn, what do you want from me? That's what they were doing. They were surveilling their enemies. - Who did what? - Who cares... Who cares to know who capptured us The question is, what would happen if the dragon triad kidnapped someone from the golden triad? - Ridiculous It would never happen. - Let's just say it did. It would start off a gang war. It's beyond suicide. No, she's right. Goldens and Dragons can't be seen In each other's territory. Oh! I'm gonna have all of you banned from this building. - Excuse me. I'm here for a class. - This class? - Yeah, I believe it starts... - In five minutes. Five minutes from now. I'm usually ten minutes early, so I'm already feeling behind. This class is for five to eight-year-olds. Yes. Yes, it is. And, uh, that's what I call, uh... Discrimination. - Discrimination? - Yes. - And eism. - Who are you? - I'm his lawyer. - You brought a lawyer? I keep a lawyer on retainer at all times. There is so much injustice that you practically can't leave home without one. And today it paid off. Right. Okay, well, I will see you in court, then. Now... perfect. Now, I'll need a statement from you, and as we plan to try this in civil and criminal court, I'll need the police here as well. Can I use your phone? Or do you only let the white people use that? - Who said anything about white people? - You just did. The words "white people" did not come out of my mouth. There they are again. Luckily, I had my hand recorder on for that one. And by the way, I am now disclosing that this conversation is being recorded. Re... recorded? Okay, this is crazy. Crazy? You want to know crazy? I sued 300 businesses last year alone. I sued a hot-dog cart and got everything but the wheels and the buns, which I won in the civil case two months later. Dude. I think he gets it now. I know, but the words are coming out of my mouth faster than I can think. - Bring it home. - Now, if you don't mind, Before I start snapping evidence photos, I'm a little parched. So can you tell me which one of these fountains I'm allowed to use? That one. I mean... Y-you pick, sir. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four... - Ow! What? - Focus. - Sorry. - You have no focus. Why? I... look, it's just... You want to know the truth? My dad never let me take karate. This is not karate. But it's pretty much the same thing. - Not the same thing. - All right. Now turn your eyes around and follow. One... And... - Did you find out anything? - Yes. I'm awesome at karate. - Wushu. - Yeah, that. I'm awesome at it. You were in there for 2 hours, and you did kung fu? No, we stretched our groins. We meditated. Did you find out anything about the case, Shawn? Upstairs is the headquarters for the dragon. They may hide the girl there, - But that's not important. - Not important? - I kicked a board in half. - No, you didn't. You're right. But it splintered. Do you have any idea what this means? I sat for 2 hours while you fulfilled a childhood dream. Let's stake this place out tonight. And I'll need $300 for the initiation fee. You signed up for class? - They are the bad guys. - Upstairs. Master Wu is not affiliated with these hooligans. - Chief. - How we doing, O'Hara? Good. Great. Great. - Great. - Great? - Great. - Great. You know, there's no shame in feeling what you're feeling. That yin case is the kind of thing that can shut a person down. You too, chief? Look, I will come back to work when I am ready. I'm not here to force your hand... just wanted to ask. I just... they say to take some time. - It's recommended. - Of course. Just make sure you know when the healing ends and the delaying begins. Of course. I will. Thank you. Great. So here you go. Stoplight safety project. Track and compare every light, cross-refernce with each stop sign. Tell me if two years isn't enough of a sample to draw a conclusion. I'll have McNab bring the rest down later. Good luck, O'Hara. That's it. I think that'swhy my dad wouldn't let me take karate. Because he knew, he knew I was too good, too dangerous. One moment, I'd be mastering the high kick. The next, I'd be holding a beating heart in my hand. - Uh, Shawn? - What? Is that our...? Kidnapper. Only one way to find out. That 2d-floor window's open. I saw this in a Jackie Chan movie. - Climbing bouncing from wall to wall. - You can't bounce to the 2d floor. I think you're neglecting my martial arts training. You talk of the one class you had today? Yes, Gus, I am. You know what? Just give me a boost. All right. We're in. Hey, man, we know you're the kidnapper. And we can do this the easy way or the... You must be out of your damn... We're not with this guy. Actually, we just now met him. - After we broke in. - Accidentally. We fell through a window. In our defense, this is the guy that's stealing stuff. He already had the safe open. Which he didn't have to crack, which means he's a pro. He stole a jacket, which is a weird thing. Agreed. Especially since he had a sweatshirt. It's not that cold. So you see, we're a couple good Samaritans. We don't expect a reward. - Silence! - You don't get it! We don't want to fight. - We're evenly matched. - Evenly? It's 3-on-3. I've had my lesson. You have your karate. It's not karate, Shawn. It's wushu. Sounds more authentic. It sounds delicious is what it sounds. - I'm going in. - What? Gus, those are cleaning supplies. Maybe we should just chill out and wait for these guys to kill each other. - He went that way! - I'm trying to stay alive. Gus, that is our kidnapper. I can scale that in a single leap. - What? - Shawn! - We lost him! - Right behind. - The guy we're chasing? - I'm talking about the guy chasing us. My spiritual senses are out of control. I can't believe I didn'tdid it earlier. We got lucky because we hid like little girls. Gus, don't be the ten tigers of canton. We've reached a new level. I rest my case. Couldn't get a clear shot of him. It's as if he knew there were cameras.</i> Dude, that's it. That's her jacket. We found her. - I'll call the police. - No, no, no, Gus. That was so us last week. We've been riding everyone's coattails this whole time. I say we take him down now. What do you mean now? Shawn! - Are you coming in? - I was waiting. - It's been 10 minutes. I could be dead. - If you recall, I didn't want to go in. So you leave me with our suspect? What was your plan? I was waiting to hear if there was any scream. Depending on how bad it sounded, I would advance. And if there was any pleading, - that was also a variable. - Holy crap. Are you checking email? I need to be productive when I'm nervous. Just come on. God bless! Gus, this is Sang Tan. His father is the leader of the dragon triad. This is the lovely Bekki. And they are in love. And your father's the leader of the golden triad? - I get it. It's Romeo and Juliet. - Kind of. Our relationship was discovered. I had to get her safe. People die from these kind of indiscretions. I went to her in the alley, and we ran. Things got out of control. You need to tell the police that this is not a kidnapping. - It's not that simple. - It's pretty simple. I'm pregnant. My father will never stand for this. I've been chosen to take over for him when he retires. There's no changing that plan. I just need a day to get some cash and get some things in order. You're part Chinese. You must understand. - You're damn right I do. - You told him you were Chinese? Gus, I am part Chinese... Now. We'll never make it like this. Can you help us? - Of course. - No. Let me get this straight. You're saying that we should stop the investigation. Yes, indeed. Chief, there is more going on here - than meets the eye. - That's certainly a tactic that we've never tried before. And what are you also suggesting... That we cross our fingers and perhaps hope for the best? I have an idea of what we could do. Don't. Don't do it. Don't... Chief. Before, moments ago, It was fuzzy. I'm upgrading it to crystal clear. Wait, I want to be sure. Yes, crystal clear. This is not a kidnapping. Really? If it's not a kidnapping, why did we just get this? Wait. I'm getting something else. Look, I'm telling you I'm right. I know she was here. She was standing right here. I can see it plain as day... Right next to the man who some believe to be - her kidnapper. - Sure? As sure as I am that the guy who just friended Gus online is not the guy who played R2-D2. His name is Kenny Baker. Why would he want to be friends with you? - Why would Elvira want to be friends? - Her name is Cassandra Peterson. We found Bekki's bracelet, a few other belongings. She was indeed here, so good work, Mr. Spencer. - Thank you. - Just a little late. Chief, look at this. - What is it? - It's traces of blood. You were here. You had to go out and play psychic, now the girl might be dead. There are a lot of things in play. She didn't get kidnapped. She ran off with the guy. She's in love with a dragon triad, And here's the kicker... Guess who the leader of the golden triads is. Arthur Chiang. - You knew that? - Of course. Cops tried to nail him for years. Why do you think I wanted you off this case? - Do not say you're protecting me. - I wasn't protecting you. But these are seriously dangerous people, Shawn. Dad, you're not listening to me. I've got this. It's Romeo and Juliet, West Side story. I don't know which one is the jets or the dolphins. - Sharks. - That is all that is going on here. And how do you know all this? - She told me. - She told you. Ah. Any chance she said it under duress? I caught them kissing. Ah. Did he have a gun? I'm assuming not. That's exactly what I'm talking about, Shawn. You got played, kid. What? Now go home. You've done enough. That doesn't even... I know what I saw. - They lied to us. - They didn't lie. Maybe they were in it together. They needed money. They fleeced you because you're either romantic or stupid. I know when people are in love. What now? You know Romeo and Juliet, right? DiCaprio and Danes? - It's a play too. - Sure it is. What if I said Bekki Chiang got mixed up with the triads, the golden ones, and fell in love with a dragon? She didn't get kidnapped. She's out there making kissy face with her guy pal. There's a ransom note. Aha! You are following the case. Only enough to know that you're wrong. Really? If it's not a kidnapping, why did we just get his? Wait a minute. That was no ransom note. No money was asked for. I don't follow you. That doesn't make any sense. Why would he send a photo that'sincite a panic? - Who's he? - Romeo. - The son. - The son? - The Tan family. - Which one? - What do you mean? - There are two. - Two? - Two sons. This is Sang Tan. He's number two in the gang. Now, this is the other brother. - Which one did you meet? - I met them both. Teno is an enforcer. He's somewhere in the middle. This guy's the toughest member of the crew. Why isn't he next in line? He's a big problem. He crosses territorial lines. This guy likes to poke the bear. Goldens and Dragons have been at peace. This guy has inciting troubles. The only reason Teno makes sense as a leader is in a time of war between the triads. And I don't see that happening anytime soon. Our relationship was discovered. I had to get her safe. I do. And I know who kidnapped the girl. - Shawn, this is a bad idea. - We got this. It's the brothers. And I just realized what you do when brothers are fighting. What? You tell their dad. I can't believe you called a meeting with the head of the dragon triads. Summit meeting. It was easy after I revealed I had jaw dropping information about his two sons. - Just get to it. - Hi, there... Mr. Han Tan. Or, is it Mr. Tan Han? See, I get confused, because the back of Yao Ming's Jersey says Yao, not Ming. Shawn. Let me start off by saying I love ping-pong. And general Chao's chicken. And your version of checkers. I find your fire drills to be immensely entertaining. Bowie's China girl... - The naked version. - That goes without saying. I have also practiced the ancient martial art of wushu... Under the tutelage of your fine people. - Shawn, get on with it. - I am endearing myself to him. Stop endearing. Your son wants to start a war between the triads. Teno, the mean one. Maybe you have your own way of differentiating them, but for me, I think he's the meanest. Maybe it's the tattoo or just the general demeanor. Use of brow. Sometimes you just get a vibe about someone. Shawn. Hold that thought. I don't think he speaks any English. Thank God. I thought it was just me. What do we do? I have set plan "b", And until then, we're just gonna have to use an international communication method. You're not going to attempt charades. - One word! - Oh, my gosh. West Side Story. - That's three words. - Your son Sang... The nice one, dark sweatshirt, is in love with Mr. Chiang's daughter. - Also nice. - Very nice. Here's the part you won't like. She is pregnant, preggers, with your grandbaby. There is a Chinese bun in the oven. She's actually not showing yet. There's not a bump at all. Safe to say that we're in the 1st trimester. - Shawn, this is not working. - I am working my butt off. He's giving me nothing! Don't worry. I can hear plan "b" right outside. I didn't do anything, man. What are you people doing? Go suck yourselves. Thank God you're here, Ken. - Why am I here? - We need a translator. - We solved the case. - But we can't tell anybody. And they can't understand what we're saying. Dude, I speak nine words of Chinese. Six of those are numbers. Let's not panic. We can use this. Which numbers do you know? Enough! I understand you. You do? Man, you let... Mr. Han... Tan... Han... You have spent ten long years working very hard to keep peace between yourself and the golden triads. And your son Teno wants to rip it apart. If you know where he is, you have to tell us. If I'm found with the kidnapped girl... The bloodshed will never stop. - We cannot get involved. - Right. But we can. So if you know where he is, you got to give him up. I'm about to solve a kidnapping. I need you to bring backup. - Shawn, call Lassiter. - Nope. Not doing it. - Stop it. I am not coming. - Nope. It's got to be you. Listen, Jules... Yin came after me too, okay? I'm not gonna let this guy keep me from living. I need you,</i> or I go down alone. Well, with Gus. You know what I mean. - You all right? - He's just outside. Wake up. Wake up. We need you. Wake up, Sang. - What are you doing? - I'm trying to wake him up. - We need him to help us escape. - I've got us covered. Don't say it, Shawn. You are not a kung fu expert. Technically, no, not yet. But I didn't show you this, man. These are mostly just stretches, but there's some lethal combinations here on page three. Teno... We got you. - I figured it all out. - Really? Yeah, really. You felt betrayed by your brother here, right? More than that, you were jealous that you weren't selected to take over. See, Sang's a little soft in your eyes, isn't he? Unfit to lead. But a war between the triads, that would be your opportunity to shine... Teno, the enforcer. You knew who it was the night we left, isn't that right? - This is the guy that's stealing stuff. - the safe was already open.</i> Which he didn't have to crack, which means he's a pro.</i> And he stole a jacket, a weird thing to steal.</i> You were the one who discovered that your brother was consorting with your most hated enemy. Our relationship was discovered. And we led you right to him. He's right behind us! You broke into that room, and you took matters into your own hands. 'cause luckily kidnapping fell right in your lap. And all you had to do was snap a ransom photo, make up enough evidence to put the blame on your brother there, and wait. Wait for a war that you had always wanted to start. Oh, relax, dude. Whoa. With the mouth. Dude, I have made it through all seven levels of Shaq Fu on Nintendo. And Gus can attest to that. Sang, wake up. All right, let's do this. I execute this properly, no can defend. You got it, Shawn. You got it. Help is on the way! Any minute now, Shawn. Your sensei teach you how to fight with a stick? Be like water, Shawn! I got your back, Shawn! Crouching tiger, Shawn, crouching tiger! Help is coming! Help is coming! Fists of fury! Fists of fury! Wushu finger! You're not helping! I'm coming. Oh, man. Really? Oh. Good work, Jules. Yeah, he had just surrendered before you got here. He surrendered when I walked in, Shawn. Oh, God. You know, dad, none of this would have happened If you just had let me take karate lessons as a kid. But you know what? I get it. You saw that I had too much potential. You knew that I would be way too dangerous to train. I didn't let you take karate because you had zero control of your body. I had too much control. You used to run around karate-chopping everything in the house. - I thought you'd kill yourself. - All right. Agree to disagree. But know this. From now on, I can handle the rough stuff. I'm my own person. My body's a weapon. I don't need you to protect me. Fair enough. But in return, you never put me in a position of having to lie for you. This isn't just about you anymore, kid. I'm in this game too. You find a victim, you find a perpetrator, you call me before you put your hand to your head. - First? - First. - How about first-ish? - No! Thanks. I was about to say the same thing to you. - Maybe I needed a kick in the pants. - I would never kick you in the pants. - You didn't give up. - And I'll never give up. What do you think? Should we hug? We could. There you are. - Rain check. - There you are. Chief said you were working on aproject. Thought you could work on these too. You're going to ply me with additional work? - Carlton, these are your taxes. - Hey, I'm trying to help you. And this is how you help me? Well, you're here. It's already working. My spine might be liquid. Did you tell the cops you single-handedly took out Teno Tan? That was an assumptionthey made. - From what? - I may have left out two verbs, an adjective, and the words "Juliet arrived." But it was mostly facts. - You have to sign your statement. - Not if we leave right now. - How about some panda express? - Had that last night. - Pick up stix? - This morning. - P.F. Chang's? - You know that's right. 52, take two. A-mark. Roll. Gus, those are cleaning supplies. One more time. Let's go back and do that again. He assumed. I called this from a mile away. Holy crap. You're doing good cop. We can do this the easy way or... You must be out of your damn... We can do this the easy way or... You must be out of your damn... - What are we waiting? - Seatbelt.
