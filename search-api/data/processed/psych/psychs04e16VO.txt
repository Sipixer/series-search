He only resurfaces when he feels there's a worthy opponent. That is Mary Lightly. He's very familiar with the patterns of our killer. - Question regarding the {\whole }Mary thing. - My father's name was Mary, his father before him was named Mary, his father before him was named Craig. I forbid you to be a part of this. This guy knows about you. - {\He knows }About everybody you care about. - He's got my mom. This switch has such a light touch, and then boom! You're gonna rot in a cell with four padded walls. The end. I'm gonna write a book. Our story. - Guess I have to find a new hobby. - Tours, racquetball. That could work. All right, last chance. You really want to do this on a Friday night? {\pos(192,220)}<i>The Little Mermaid.</i> Without Gus? {\pos(192,220)}Apparently Gus has a strange aversion to Rene Auberjonois. It's a <i>Benson</i> thing. You really want to see this flick? Dad, don't say "flick". And I'm barely tickling adolescence. - Why do you want me to grow up so fast? - All right, I know the running time. I'm gonna be back here in exactly 116 minutes. Awesome. Bye, Dad! Is that you? {\} 'Scuse me. Just hurry. Just kiss the knees in a touch, guys. Thanks. You're very sweet, both of you. Your drink. I'm... That's my bad. I'm sorry. That's just awkward. Where have you been? You missed the first third of the movie. Let me guess: dude has a creepy voice and a mommy complex. All I care about is the shower scene. Wait for it... Did you know that Hitchcock appeared in all of his films? - Everyone knows that. - But did you know that he was also obsessed with women's Japanese household slippers? Wore them everywhere, even to bed. - That's not true. - No, it's not. It's part of a new bit I'm working on called completely random, untrue trivia. You guys like pie? When I was nine years old, my mother gave me my first haircut. - Here's your milk, doll face. - Thank you. Mary, you seem disturbed. Even more so than usual. I'm almost afraid to ask, why don't you tell us what's really on your mind? I'm assuming you've read this. {\} Are you kidding? We're in it. If I'm not mistaken, and I am paraphrasing here, I'm introduced on page 11 as a thick-tufted boy genius who ice skates through life on polished blades of snarky eloquence. That is an exact quote. {\Do you remember }What was I described as? Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside, the fastidious wrinkle on the brow of Psych. True, but she also said you had skin of pure cocoa velvetiness. She also she would like to use that skin to make children's dolls. I'd buy that doll. The point is, you know Yang almost as well as I do. You're the only other person who would know that none of this is possible. Come on, Shawn, the projectionist. We didn't get to the drive-in till 11:26. How would Yang have had the time to do all that and strapped your mother down with incendiary explosives? Look, Mary... I know that Yang was a big part of your life. But she is behind electronic gates now, and she can't hurt anyone anymore. Yang wasn't working alone. - You didn't {\give}start racquetball{\ a fair shake, did you?}. - I will not wear short pants, Shawn. I think it's time for you to go home, Mary. I am home. I live here. - Say what? - I never left Santa Barbara. I've been here since we caught Yang. You should have told us. We would have gotten you a house chilling gift. A belated welcome to you, and forever good-bye. Don't go, Shawn. You will regret it. Good luck at the creepy arm grab awards this year, Mary. I think you have a real shot... at winning. Shawn, thanks for coming out here. We think that this just happened, so if there's anything to get psychically, I wanted you to take a look while things are still fresh. - What happened? - It isn't pretty. The victim's a caucasian female, approximate age, mid-40s. Strangled, dropped here like a sack of potatoes. Body's still warm. I know. What's the matter? You've forget to take your crime scene pills? - Do you know this woman? - She served us our pie. What the hell does that mean, She served you your pie? What is it? Psych 416 "Mr. Yin Presents" Timing: Psych Team {\pos(192,220)}All right, you were the last customer{\ in this place last night}. What do you remember seeing? Nothing, she brought Gus's milk, and I never saw her again. - I couldn't {\even }find her to pay the bill. - Wait, you didn't pay the check? So what happened to my $20? I folded it into a tiny sailor's hat for a special friend. Here we go. - It's Yang. - She's in jail. Indeed, this is the work of Yin. {\pos(192,220)}Back off, this can get sticky. {\pos(192,200)}- What is that? - Crossword puzzle. {\pos(192,220)}It's from yesterday's paper. {\pos(192,220)}There's two clues highlighted. 12 down and 6 across. {\pos(192,220)}"A Good Man Is Hard to blank. - "Blank, Myself, and I." - I got it! {\pos(192,220)}A Good Man Is Hard to Find. {\pos(192,220)}Me, Myself, and I. {\pos(192,220)}The answer is "find me". {\pos(192,220)}I think that bailiff from <i>Night Court</i> is spot-on. - Perfect, we can start by... - No, Jules, we don't start, period. {\pos(192,200)}You guys want another crime scene? You want another dead body? {\pos(192,200)}Go ahead, engage. But we can't play this game again. {\pos(192,220)}I wish I had the luxury not to follow a lead in a murder investigation. {\pos(192,220)}Fine, you do what you have to do. {\pos(192,220)}Gus and I are going straight to the source. {\pos(192,220)}You coming or what? Solitary confinement in a mental institution? Feels redundant. {\pos(192,220)}- I smell crazy. - I crave sweet, sweet marshmallows. {\pos(192,220)}- And why are we wearing these? - It's a preventative measure. {\pos(192,220)}She gets overly stimulated by color. What about my face? I knew you'd come. She's cute, right? {\pos(192,220)}I got the googley eyes for her, but she's playing hard to get. {\pos(192,220)}I can't stand it any more. What did you think of the book? Honestly? I thought Bruce Campbell's was better. We're here to ask you one, simple question. The answer is yes, Shawn, they do allow conjugal visits. But I think we'd have to get married first. - I am a fully-ordained minister. - {\That's }The most disgusting thing I've {\ever }heard. Mary here seems to think that you are not the sole mastermind behind this nasty venture. I don't think, Shawn, I know. Do you, Mary, quite contrary? Do you now? I think we can help each other out. - This isn't <i>Silence of the lambs</i>. - It's totally <i>Silence of the lambs</i>. - That makes you Frankie Faison. - I know. We're gonna catch this sicko{\ with or without you}. {\I thought }I'd give you one shot at redemption. Make no mistake: you're going to hell either way. Speak now, or we're out of here. See you. I never said I didn't have a dance partner. So there really is a Yin to her Yang. If you think I'm sick, you ain't seen nothin' yet. - What are we doing here? - Retracing our steps. We were here {\last night }for the Hitchcock festival. It was a triple feature. Guster, I don't care how many movies you saw. Spencer, what the hell are we doing? There's two clues highlighted. 12 down, 6 across.</i> 12 down. 6 across. He was here! 12 down, 6 across. He was sitting right there. I think we were in the same row. Then you must have seen him. What did he look like? Just hurry. You're very sweet, both of you.</i> Your drink. I'm... that's my bad.</i> - I don't know. - There's something here. "Oh, Shawn, don't cry over spilled soda. "But, tsk tsk, you were 20 minutes late, so now you'll have to play catch-up. " - You two need to go back and see Yang. - No, she is not... The puppet master anymore. Yin is working alone. What can you tell us about Yin? What's his game? There is no game. It's the law of opposites, okay? Yang had rules... The ticking clock, the keen rhyming schemes, nothing but order. Yin, nothing but chaos. And you can bet your sandy bottom that as soon as you figure out the rules, they'll change. - Let's go to the movies! - Seriously, not again. I'm not gonna watch you act like a court jester for a second round{\ of this nightmare}. The necktie around the waitress, that's straight out of <i>Frenzy</i>. We're {\clearly }dealing in themes and motifs. Him knowing we were here last night, our clues are gonna be found in Hitchcock films. That's very good, Gustus. Okay, we've got a lot of cinema to cover. Gus and I'll take {\the }<i>Cannonball</i>{\ run series}. You take <i>Hooper</i> through <i>stroker ace</i>. Those are Burt Reynolds movies. We really have our work cut out for us then. Think, Shawn, think. Try and find something. You didn't see his face, but you can pick up on something. You can do it, Shawn. The feet, the shoes. Something. I'm cold! And hurry up. We don't have all night. - You can do it, Shawn. - Come on. Focus. Think. See something. Show me your face! Look at me! Come on, Shawn, the projectionist. We didn't get to the drive-in till 11:26.</i> How would Yang have had the time to do all that?</i> Come on, Shawn. It's me. It's always been me. I don't think we're speaking to the mouse.</i> The mouse is speaking to you. I don't think, Shawn. I know. Look what happened to our window. I know who Yin is.{\pub} Mr. Spencer, this is outlandish. - Just hear him out. - Mary Lightly all but confessed {\pos(192,240)}to Gus and I when he said {\that }he had spent the last 13 years of his life with Yang {\pos(192,240)}and had no idea what he was going to do without her. {\pos(192,240)}Mr. Spencer, I have to ask: {\pos(192,240)}why are you just now receiving these psychic signals? Why didn't you tag Mary as a suspect the last time around? He did. It was the first thing he said when he saw him. - He was being flippant and jackassy. - Our track record speaks for itself. {\pos(192,240)}We can either do this together, or we can follow you around {\pos(192,240)}and conduct our own investigation. {\pos(192,240)}All right, Mr. Spencer. But you're on a very short leash. How do you suggest that we proceed? Keeping in mind, of course, we haven't a shred of physical evidence. - We do nothing. - Nothing? How seinfeldian. Chief, we let him hang himself. We keep him close, we play along. We catch him red-handed. I got Yin's next clue. I found it on my doorstep, along with a can of matizallego sarnes in olive oil. It took ever ounce of willpower I had not to open them up. Sweet. Sock it to us. "Take 39 steps by 12:05. "Wait for it. "Coordinates north by Northwest. - "Make a wish." - Wait for what? More Hitchcock. No, it's just a motif. Try to think through it, chief. - He's showing off. - We're all ears, Lightly. You really are all ears, Carlton. Spectacular. I've delivered this clue, and I suggest that we all think about it analytically. Northwest, northwest. Northwest mall, northwest air. Northwest... Park and picnic. That's it. I play dominoes with some Jamaicans there on Sundays. There's a set of stairs that leads up to a penny fountain. "Make a wish." We have less than a half hour. Mr. Lightly, {\you ride }with my detectives. - Let's go! - We'll be right behind you! Come on, we're taking a detour. We're close. His house should be right here. That's it. That's the address. Damn, Mary. I think Mary would want you to have a can or two. Shut up, Shawn. Dude, it's Ben! - He wasn't kidding. - That hat belongs in my wallet. What's with all the numbers? It's Pi. Don't be Topher Grace running on the beach at the end of <i>Good Company</i>. The value of Pi, Shawn, as in mathematics. Right, with the... Do we like Pi, he asks. This dude has problems. Quick. Arrest that fat kid. There's no time. No, there's less than a minute. Damn it, Mary, come on! What are you wearing, ankle weights? Of course I am! I've got a thigh spasm! It burns so deep, you guys! Go on without me! - Damn it. - What do you think? Just come on, Mary! Dude, a ticket stub. He was definitely at the movie theater. He sure was. Oh, hell, no. 36, 37, 38, 39. It's 12:05 on the dot. What the hell are we supposed to be looking for? Wait. I think I have something. That's the north line. "North by northwest." That's him! Where the hell is Mary? Son of a bitch! What is it? "It's time we met in the flesh, don't you think?" It's his next move. He's just working out the wording. "736 la porte avenue, industrial lane. "Curtain's at 9 P.M. "Come alone." Who is it for? His next victim. McNab, do not tell me that! Someone on that bus must have seen something. What happened? Where were you? - Cut the crap, Mary! Start talking! - Didn't you see at the bus stop? It was him! I tried to stop him, I tried, but it was too late. He was wearing a... very stylish fedora. We know. We got off on the next stop. We must have missed him {\by a matter of}for few seconds. Of course you did. He knew exactly how much time it would take. He probably rehearsed it 100 times. He totally manhandled me. I dropped my shoe. Spencer where the hell are you? Yeah, thanks for nothing. Is Shawn okay? He's fine. His tire blew. Get in the car. Shawn, are you sure this is where we're supposed to be? Absolutely. This is one of the strongest visions I've had in years. "736 la porte avenue, industrial lane."</i> I saw this place, I saw Mary's face, I saw his watch. Look at that. It's show time. Let's bag this degenerate. You two stay put. Of course it's locked. I'm gonna take the east exit. Copy that. I'll head around back. Take it from behind. Let's try and keep this P.G. rated. Damn it, I told you to stay in the car. He's probably keeping an eye on that door. We know-we're gonna walk the perimeter. Go back to the car. This door opens, or you see anything that doesn't look right, honk the horn. Go, now! Shawn, what are you doing? We're out of here. We're locked in. - What are we looking at? - I don't care. Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i> What are you up to, Mary? Dude, I'm getting serious deja vu right now. Wait a minute. Oh, my gosh. He's gonna shoot somebody, Shawn. He has a gun. This is <i>Psycho</i>! We were wrong! Mary is the victim. Get out of here! There's gotta be a way out of this room! I'm sorry, Gus. The clue was meant for him. {\I don't understand.}What about the notebook? All recreations. Not first drafts! I should... I should have told you guys, but... I wanted to be heroic. This is detective O'Hara. We need a IM... With a flare gun? I was really counting on the element of surprise. There... - What the hell happened? - There! He was right there! - Could you take care of Ben? - You hang on. There's help on the way. Do you think they have racquetball in heaven? I know they do.{\pub} {\pos(192,240)}You're interrupting my exercise time{\, Shawn}. I only get 45 minutes a week. {\pos(192,240)}Aside from shock treatments, this is all I have to look forward to. That and hell. - Roll it back, Reginald! - Who{\ the hell} is she talking to? Look, your partner wore ankle weights to throw me off. I was wrong about Mary. I know. Such a shame. My lady guard friend told me. Please don't beat yourself up, Shawn. The guy creeped me out. This was an honest mistake. We need your help. Little brooding brown one. I've already given you all the help you need to catch Yin. How? You just seem bat s. crazy to me. Never... judge a book by its cover. No matter how sexy that picture might be. - Give me the book. - Shawn, I read{\ this book} it cover to cover. I've pored over it. Cover to cover. What? Look{\ at that}. Nice. She drew a self-portrait just for you. But what does it mean? Chief... Yin sent another clue. We have the address. The time will be 9:00 pm. He wants you all to show up there, where he has created his own movie set. - I'm done watching movies{\, chief}. - Exactly, detective. You now, are the movie. He's cast you all as archetypal characters from Hitchcock's canon. There will be clues that lead you to catch him, based on{\ the plots of} those films. You serious about this? We're{\ just} supposed to play dress-up all night? We will do whatever it takes, detective. He is giving us an opportunity to catch him before he kills again. Now, I'm not sending you in there like sitting ducks. He{\'s made it very clear that you are} wants you to come alone. But the only way that this is going to work is if I set up a team on the outside and cover the perimeter. - Snipers? - You bet your ass. Karen... I got your message. What can I do? He's called you out{\, henry}. You have a history with him as well. - Sean Connery? - Dad, you can say no. {\Shawn, }The last time{\ this happened,} you put your life on the line, we almost lost your mother. I'm gonna be right by your side, son. End of discussion. All right, people. This ends tonight. All right, chief, no sign of{\ human} movement. We're gonna gain a better vantage point. Okay, proceed, but keep me posted as to your coordinates,</i> and make sure that everyone is tuned in.</i> Snipers are in place and will go at my ready. So no false alarms. Wait a minute. I think that's meant for me. That scene from <i>The Birds</i>, Tippi Hedren's attacked in the car. What are you talking about{\,Lassiter}? Didn't you see <i>Marnie</i>? Half that movie was me and Tippi driving around{\ in a car}. That clue is all me. You do realize you're not {\actually }Sean Connery{\, right}? Oh, I'm sorry. {\No, }I got lost for a moment there, because I literally thought I was talking to Rod Taylor. - Who's Rod Taylor? - I am! {\Look, stop. }We can't be sure. You should both go and check it out. "Need a ride?" It's clear. - {\All right, }We're in the vehicle. - <i>Watch yourself.</i> {\Well, }Look at that. That's a wheelchair. Up in that window there. Looks like that's my clue. Be careful. Canada lee? Lifeboat? Do you see any water{\ around here}? There wasn't even a puddle. Yeah, I don't know how it fit into this either. Maybe it is just a prop. There's no ignition, not even a place for a key. This place is creepy. I'm almost at the door. Open it and then run away. It's locked. Yin in screwing with us. What are you seeing? Gus, it's rear window. I can see all of you. I can see everything. Question is, what actually matters? - That's Ernie's bar from <i>Vertigo</i>! - Kim Novak. This is me{\, Shawn}. I'll signal{\ everyone} if there's anything. Proceed with caution, detective. We're in a tunnel{\ now}. How the hell's he doing this? What is... What is that? - What are you doing in here? - We can't see you{\ in here}. That music is playing so loud we can't hear{\ anything}. Stay where you are. I have a clue. "Draught us a couple cold ones, and let's make a toast "to you falling head over heels for me." {\Gus... }Relax. It's why we're here. I'm going to do this. Talk to me. Talk to me, Gus! Cover your eyes! I'm gonna shoot out the window! O'Hara, somebody, come in. What happened? - Car was a trap! We lost contact. - Something happened in the bar! I know this is hard. We're ready to take the call{\ when it comes in}. There's nothing more we can do. It's my fault. Dammit, Spencer, this is not your fault. Detective O'Hara was my responsibility. The tunnel wasn't on {\any of the }schematics, the son of a bitch knew it. {\There's no way }We couldn't{\ have} know{\n}. Unless you're a psychic. I{\ just} spoke with your mother. I wanted her to know that you were safe. She's fine. She's at a hotel in New York at a conference. I told her to stay put. Doesn't Abigail get in tonight? What time is it? - It's almost 1:00. - Her flight gets in in half an hour. We can't afford to let you go. {\Shawn, }What happens if a call comes in and we need to {\be somewhere halfway across}cross - the city in 11 minutes? - I have to pick her up. Don't worry. We'll send someone to get her. Someone she knows. How was Uganda? It was rich, compelling, a must-see. What is this about, Buzz? Can't{\ really} say. I'm{\ just} here to{\ make sure} get you home safe{\ly}. Why wouldn't I be safe? This is ridiculous, and I am beyond jetlagged. Just tell me what is going on. Please, Ms. Lytar. Just following my orders. "Ms. Lytar"? Really? What are you doing? Oh, my God! Are you okay? Somebody help me! It's Abigail. Hey, Abs, sorry I couldn't pick you up myself. Hello, Shawn. I have good news and bad news.</i> The good news is that our femme fatale is still very much alive.</i> The bad news, for you anyway, is that I have now met the girl next door.</i> I understand your predicament. They're both so you.</i> But we can't have our cake and eat it too.</i> So I'm doing you a favor here by forcing you to choose. Choose? Who do you care about more?

Shawn, you can still save Abigail... "Hands on my face." It's a clock. - Half past four, this could get messy. - "I'll drop by." She's Kim Novak in <i>Vertigo</i>. "I'll... drop by. " - Instead of a bell tower... - It's the clock tower! Detective, wait. A civilian has been taken as well. She must be given priority. If we had the slightest clue... You've got other units, chief. I'll be going to get my partner now. Detective! Can you tell us where Abigail is? I can't. There's no way to save them both. It's Jules. We know where she is, we follow Lassie. We save Juliet. I'll drive. Henry, go home. - Your role{\ here} is finished. - Not a chance{\ in hell}. You, too, are a civilian, and therefore an unnecessary risk. - All right, I accept. - Excuse me? The job you offered me, Karen. I accept. Cut me a little slack on the wardrobe. It's great to be back. Gus, wait. The cover. Yang didn't draw herself. She drew Abigail... on the pier. I think I know where she is. - Let's go{\ get her}. - No{\, no, no}. I could be wrong. - {\You }Go with the chief, {\. You }help Lassie. - {\Shawn, }You're not going alone. {\Gus, }The only way that I can not be there for Juliet is if I know that you are. And I won't be alone. Boats. All right, don't worry, son. If she's here, we'll find her. She's under the pier, isn't she? I see you, sweetheart. Blink once for yes, and two for no. Are there any explosives that I can trigger by coming in? You've got to be kidding me! Take the stairs. I'll man the point and set up a perimeter. We've really come full circle{\, huh}? This is where I stood you up on our first date. Thanks for showing up this time. - How was your trip? - Awesome! It's just rope! {\Please }Tell me you {\still }carry your swiss. Of course I do. I taught you that. Come on in! The water's great! You just concentrate on your breathing. I promise not to try anything while I'm down there. It's getting higher! Hurry! We're almost there. We're almost there. O'Hara! My God. All right, don't worry. We'll get you out of this! You gotta do something, quick! I can't hold it for long! Good work! We got you. We got you. - All right. - You all right? We got her. It was close, but we got her. She's OK. God. Thank God. Abigail's okay too. She's good. Gus, he was here. I saw him. I could have touched him.</i> {\But }I had to let him go. You had no choice. You did the right thing. You know, this game isn't over. I know. Thanks for being there, buddy. Juliet's Okay. Good. Good. Listen, you take care of your girl. I'll go talk to the cops. All right? How about the swiss, huh? Never leave home without it. No, I mean{\, uh}... I think you've got my knife, I've got yours. Did we get switched up? Look at that. God, yours is so much bigger than mine.{\pub} You warm enough?

I mean, what if I said that I was willing to learn how to compromise? Yeah, and meet you halfway... on everything. You make me laugh. And... you make me feel like I'm a little bit crazy. And I know that if I just let myself, I could completely fall... But there's a lot of things that I want to do. I'm not just kindergarten teacher who wants to settle down and make a family. {\I want to- }I want to make a difference. I want to inspire people. And I can't do any of that if I'm dead.

That's why I chose you.
