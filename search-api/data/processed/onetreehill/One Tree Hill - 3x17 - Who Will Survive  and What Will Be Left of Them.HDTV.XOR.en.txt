- Get away from the door. We got to get you somewhere safe. No, don't leave me, please. You're gonna tape a line down the center of the room. Go on! If I say I love you right now, will you hold it against me? - Don't push me. - He's not gonna do it! - Back him up! - Listen to him! I promise you, whoever steps into that hallway is gonna die. It's never gonna be the same. This is wrong, man, all of this. This is your fault. I just wanted it to stop. Just take it all back. Let me talk to him. Jimmy, please. - I'm sorry. - No! He's gone, Danny. He's gone. Over here, Danny! I found something. It's a raven. What's wrong with it? I think its wing is broken. We can nurse him back to health. Come on, help me catch him. He'll fly again. You'll see. No! Why did you do that? Why'd you kill him? He was weak. I want to go home. "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove. I would fly away and be at rest. My companion attacks his friends. He violates his covenant. His speech is smooth, yet war is in his heart. But you, oh, god, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. As for me, I trust in you." And now we ask for the strength to navigate the stages of our grief as we lay our brother Keith to rest. The stages of our grief -- anger, fear, guilt, depression... acceptance. Dan. And the first seeds of grief -- I guess everybody's just gonna change and go back to Karen's. People are definitely gonna change. Will you unzip me? I love you. I love you, too. It's all so uncertain. God, I love you. I never want to come that close to losing you again. I need you to be safe, okay? I told you I'm not going anywhere. They expected 200 people at his wake. They got like 2,000. People loved Keith, you know? I was the worst mechanic on the planet. But he gave me a summer job because he knew I needed the money. We hung out that summer talking old-school basketball with him, me, Skills, Mouth. And Jimmy. Jim's funeral's on tuesday. Jimmy Edwards killed my uncle. Do not talk about him, not in my mother's house. Peyton, hi. Hey. Lucas, I'm so sorry. I want to thank you for saving my little girl. Thank you. Hey, buddy. Hey. I'm sorry I haven't checked in lately. I've just been with Lucas and Karen. Of course. I'm glad you're okay. I mean, you're gonna be okay, right? Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. I just have to do some physical therapy stuff. Well, can I get you anything? Any food? No, I'm okay, really. I just came to see Karen. Okay. Peyton. I'm really glad you're okay. We are the worst family/friends in the whole world. We really should be at Lucas'. You're right. Just stay here for a second. Okay. When  I was a kid, I had this morning paper route. And every morning there was this moment right around dawn, and I would just stop, breathe it all in. You could almost feel the magic in the world. But lying here with you, I feel that same stillness. And I can almost believe that the world's not as screwed up as I know it is. My mom's coming home. She called. At least you won't have to live alone in this big giant house. Yeah, but she will. I want us to live together. I want to be your husband again, Haley. That sounds so good to me. But I have a roommate named Brooke. That doesn't matter. And our dream schools are 3,000 miles away. Doesn't matter. And neither of us have jobs. It doesn't matter. You know how long it took me to realize that? The amount of time it takes to pull a trigger. I love you, Haley James, and that's all I need to know. That doesn't mean it's not gonna be hard. Doesn't mean it's not gonna be confusing. But whatever it is, we'll face it together. You are quite charming, you know that? You haven't even seen my "a" game. Oh, lord, help me if that's true. It's Scott, by the way. You called me Haley James. Haley James Scott. And it always will be. Welcome back, students. Today as we return to our school with heavy hearts, you will note some changes. At the entrance to our schools, you will see metal detectors. They are here for your safety. You  will see an armed police presence on campus. They are here for your well-being. We can try to make the school safer. We can try to protect you. But there are no precautions that we can take to heal your hearts. Hey. Hey. Let's just go to class, okay? Come on. I urge you to reach out - to your teachers and counselors. - Just give me one second. Form grief circles and talk about it. If you're feeling scared, if you're feeling vulnerable or confused, don't keep it inside. Let it out. You are not alone. And this is your school. Hey, roommate. Hey. This is the saddest thing. It's... the material for Karen's wedding dress. I ordered it the morning... Listen, I have some good news. Okay. Nathan and I want to be together again, like for real. Haley, that's awesome! Yeah, but it kind of sucks, though. I'm gonna miss you. You've become a really good friend. Yeah, you, too. When am I losing you? As soon as we can find an apartment, you know? - Okay. - Yeah. Whenever that is, you go, be happy. Life's too short, you know? Hey, kiddo. How'd you do at school? Fine. I'm just tired. Well, the doctor said that would happen, so just take it slow. Can I get you anything? Mnh-mnh. No, I'm fine. Okay, listen, uh, I cancelled my next run. Dad, you can't protect me every second of every day. Well, that sucks. I never want to feel the way I felt when I got that call saying my baby girl was on the way to the hospital. I got one other call like that in my life. That's two too many. How much allowance am I giving you, anyway? Ellie gave me those albums. I just can't bring myself to play them. Hey, Luke. Rachel. You  sent me this? Maybe. What are you doing? Nobody has all the answers. But we all have our "whys." Like, why did this happen? Why didn't we see it coming? Why do people watch "American Idol"? Come on. Welcome to detention. Hi, boyfriend. Do you really think a party's appropriate, Brooke? It's not a party. It's more of a cleansing for every kid in this school. Everybody's here. Everybody's invited. Everybody's together. So just check it out, okay? We've got coed bathrooms, science lab for drugs and pharmaceuticals, health class for condoms and people probably using them. Spanish class has kick-ass margaritas. And there's the tutor center for anybody who needs a little extra help. Tonight we're all together, and we stop judging each other and let everybody heal their own way. If you need to do this alone, I understand. But if you need me, I'm here. Hey. We should really stop meeting up like this. I never did thank you. Hey, it's okay. God, I'm such a girl. You love me. Okay, that is so not fair. You probably just want to kiss me again. Dude, shut up. Okay, I kissed you, but I... I thought I was gonna die. And you took care of me, so, you know... Yeah. I know. If I told you I loved you, would you hold it against me? Luke, when I said that... Because I do, Peyton. But it's okay, because, um... there is this other girl -- I mean, you might know her. Her name's Brooke Davis. And I am completely in love with her. You don't know how good it is to hear you say that. 'Cause I thought everything was gonna get weird again, and I really don't want it to. We're okay, right, you and me? We're good? All right. I should go. Peyton? I'm sorry about your mom -- both moms. I don't feel like I've been there for you the way I should have, and I'm just sorry for that. You know how proud Keith must be of you right now? I don't know if that's true. It is. Let Brooke help you out with this, okay? Don't shut her out. Why,  did she say something to you? No. I just -- I know how you are. I'm the same way. She gave you her heart, Luke. You should give yours back. I'll see you. Hey, don't kiss anybody out there. You suck, you know that? Hey. Want to come dance with me? Everybody head to lockdown! I've got a shooter here. Shooters in the hallway. Come on, everybody. Pull your head out of your ass and show some respect. Lucas! Please stay. I can't, Brooke. It's not right. Why not? You wouldn't understand. You weren't there. I may not have been inside that school, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't there. It doesn't mean that I don't carry that day around with me like everybody else. I was there. And if a party helps to bring us all together and helps everyone to deal with it, then why not? Rachel, you know that this is wrong. Somebody died in that hallway. No, Luke. Two people died. I'm sorry, Brooke. I know you're trying to help me with this, and I love you for it, but I... I just -- I can't. What's up, my brother? Nothing. So, listen, the guys talked and decided... we're not gonna go to Jimmy's funeral tomorrow. I  mean, Mouth's kind of tore up about it, but we all loved Keith. It just don't seem right. Do you think there's a heaven, Skills? Do I think there's a heaven? Yeah, you know, like the pearly gates, angels. I don't know about all that. Maybe some chrome gates and some freaky angels. No. But I do think there's something else out there. And I do think that whatever we do in this world matters in the next. Before you came in, I was thinking about Edwards... how he could take Keith's life. Look, he wasn't right, dog. Jimmy was sick. So if that's true, is heaven the kind of place that will hold that against someone? Because if not, Jimmy's a victim, too. And right now in your world beyond this one, Jimmy and Keith are in the same place. I can't figure out what kind of place that would be. It's a place you and I wouldn't understand. Or a place that doesn't exist. Oh, I love this song. You think that's okay? To, like, love a song and feel good when you hear it and, like, laugh and be happy and be so in love with somebody your heart aches? I mean, is that okay right now, or is it just too soon? It's never, never too soon to feel like that. Danny. Danny, I'm waiting. Why'd you do this to me? I saw the light. I doubt it. Truth be told, I couldn't sleep. Can I help you? No, Dan. You can't help me. You were horrible to Keith. Is it any wonder you can't sleep? Doesn't mean I didn't love him. Well, that's great, Dan. But how's it feel to know you can never take any of it back? And for the rest of your life, all you'll have is regret over a relationship you could have repaired with a few kind words. But you couldn't even find it in your heart to do it. Maybe I'll find those words with Lucas. No. Don't push me, Dan. Come on, Karen. He's old enough to make his own decisions. Like when he went back into that school, or when he pulled me out of the dealership fire. Did you pull Dan out of the fire? Mom -- Did you? Yes. You selfish, stupid boy. Did you think about me? Just once think about me and what my life would be like if I lost you? Running into burning buildings, high schools with guns -- did I raise an idiot? I know! Okay? I know! It's my fault! If I didn't go back in there, Keith would still be here. And I know that. And I'm sorry. Well, sorry isn't gonna bring him back, is it? You have to let it go, Mouth. It's not your fault. I wasn't thinking that. Yes, you were. You have this ridiculous notion that, because you were friends once, you could have saved him. What's so ridiculous about that? Because you couldn't have. I was his best friend, Rachel. How many times did the guy call you in the last year? Come on, look around. Everybody's here tonight. Geeks, stoners, jocks, maybe a few old friends who forgot to stay in touch. That's how it's gonna change. But everyone's still divided. We stick to these rigid circles of friends based on sports we play or hobbies we like or how attractive or unattractive we are. When's that gonna change? H onestly? Probably never. Look, that's human nature. People stick to their own kind. If you want it to change, then change it. I'll help you. How? Dance with me. Hey. Hey. Here. What is this? It's my door key. Actually it's your door key. - Brooke, it's your place. - No. It's always been your place, both of yours. I was just keeping it warm till you came to your senses. Thank you, Brooke. Thanks. How's Lucas doing? I don't know. He left. Just trying to give him his space, but it's hard, you know? Anyway, you kids be happy. One of these days, you'll make the rest of us believe in true love. I want to go find Lucas. Okay, let's go. Okay. Hey, hold on. Why did you do that? Because I don't think you're gonna like me 10 seconds from now. But -- I released the time capsule. It's not your fault, Mouth. It's mine. You're right. I don't like you. Hey. Here. I'm taking my predictions back. They're not gonna come true now, anyway, not without Keith. Luke. My mom thinks that this was my fault. She would not say that. Yeah, she pretty much did. We shouldn't have gone back into that school. She's wrong. Luke, Keith would have gone back into that school if you were in there or not because that is who he was. This is not your fault. She's right, Luke. You did what he did. You went back in there to save a life. Otherwise we might have been at Peyton's funeral. But I couldn't save Keith. Neither could I. He loved you a lot, Luke, just like we do. And so does Brooke. You think none of your predictions are gonna come true? Look at the first one on your list. "This year I'll try again with Brooke." Brooke? Brooke! She's gone. Coach, I can explain it all. It wouldn't matter, seeing as how I'm not here right now. Not that I approve of any of this, but... I guess kids getting drunk in school beats kids getting killed. Been meaning to talk to you. The truth of the matter is I've been busy... crying like a baby. They were gonna get married. Keith was gonna be my dad. He was your dad. No matter what any science or papers said. He was the man who influenced your life more than anybody else. I saw it in you every day. I just want him to come back. I just want him to come home. It's not fair. I'm gonna tell you something. When my wife... died, things got pretty dark there for a while. Nobody could talk to me. And then one of my former players -- kid may have been the worst player I ever coached -- waded into that darkness and pulled me to safety. Kid's name was Keith Scott. He said, "coach, I know you want some answers. But what is the right answer? Because there is no answer. There's just life." Just life. Lucas, be the man that Keith taught you to be. Anything less will make this a much greater tragedy than it already is. Danny. Why'd you do this to me? It's not gonna work, you know. I'm not gonna carry this around with me. I did what I did, and it's done. Danny. So you come around all you want, ghost. You won't scare me. As a matter of fact, tonight I'm gonna sleep like a baby. You want to know why? Because you started this war. I just finished it. I just finished it. This is Karen's wedding dress material. If only it were raining. I think I can take care of that. Come on. Hey. Do you know a Pete from "Freak Out Boy," tattoos, goofy grin, about as tall as a fire hydrant? - Fall Out Boy. - Yeah, whatever. I can't believe I'm about to say this to my high school-aged daughter, but he is waiting in that limo. Don't be long. Okay. I want you to know something. If anything ever happens to me, - if you ever lose me -- - Nathan. I want you to know how happy you made me, how wonderful my life was with you and... I will always be with you. Nothing's gonna happen to you. I know. I know. You're right. But if it does, I just -- I want you to be okay, Haley, and know that you made me happy. You wanted rain. It is not possible to be this in love. Hey, pretty girl. Hey. I was gonna sleep in my car, but I heard a noise, and I think it was a bear or something. Well, where were you parked? Right outside here. Well, have I told you how much I love you today? Not really. Well, I do, and even when I don't tell you, it means a lot to me to know you're there. It means everything. I am here. We both are. I know. It's good being here... especially with you. I wished that it was me. I know that's horrible, and I know that's selfish, but... I watched you rescued Peyton, and you told me you rescued Dan. And sometimes I just wish you could rescue me. From what? From all of it. Okay, then. I will. If you promise to rescue me back. I promise. There's something else I need to do. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. How's the leg? Oh, it'll be okay. How's the boy? It'll be okay. - Oh -- - I'm sorry, Peyton. Why? Because I shouldn't have left you there. I thought you were behind me. - Brooke, don't -- - No. I should have made sure. Okay. You're my best friend. And you want to know what made me feel better when I was trapped in that library? It was knowing that Brooke's okay, you know? My best friend, she's safe. I love you for that, P. Sawyer. But there was something else that made you feel better in that library -- my boyfriend. And I guess I can't hold it against him, can I? I mean, the boy I love protected the girl I love. - And it's the girl that he loves, too. - Brooke -- No. We both know it's true. Okay. - What -- - come here. No. Come here. All right. I want you to listen to me. I care about Lucas, and I always will. But he's insanely in love with you. And you know what? So am I. You're my Brooke. I'm not gonna hurt you again. Okay, 'cause I really don't want to hurt again. Come here. You're something, you know that? I get shot, and you're the one that needs consoling. Sorry. You want a lift? Yes. I do. - Okay. - Hold on. Oh! Please don't fall! Ow! - Come on. - No, I got you. - Am I that heavy? - No! I got you. I got you. Go. Okay, ow. Ow. Oh, boy. What? Dad? What did you do? I know your room's like some holy land forbidden to fathers, but I thought I'd make you some shelves. You know, sweetie... people will things that have given them great happiness in their life, things that have helped them make sense of the world. I'm sure that Ellie hoped that when you played these albums that you would remember her and she would be with you in the music. Thank you. But where's my bed? I don't think you have room for a queen-sized bed. I'm bringing two singles in here now that Brooke's moving in. What? Really? Best friends should stick together. Welcome home. This is gonna be amazing. I have to teach you the scrunchie system. No, no, no, no, no. No nudity in our room, okay? But, oh! Speaking of boys, tonight after the party, I hooked up with Pete from Fall Out Boy -- we made out. Oh, Peyton, we're gonna find you a boyfriend, honey. You don't have to lie about it. No, I -- Now, how do you feel about a round bed? Whatever you say, roommate. Hey, ma, you okay? What are you doing? It's what Keith would have wanted. Absolutely not. You go to your room, and you change. No. I said go change. It's what Keith would want. Transcript: Raceman - Synchro: Amariss
