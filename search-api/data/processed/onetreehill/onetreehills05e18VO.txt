capture:frm@xxy sync:frs@will</font> let me take this part. You're a cute kid. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, you. Whatcha got there? What's that? I think you drank too much. I think you're right. Nathan: damn. Think somebody got thrown through a plate-glass window. Dude, it seriously smells like ass in here. And rotten cheese. Go away. Ew, and bad breath. I said, "go away." Ho... Holy crap. What? Have you seen your head? Not lately. You have a mohawk. I do? Awesome. Can I get one, daddy? Sure, if you want to look goofy like your uncle lucas. Kind of like he has a tail... Just on his head. Jamie, why don't you go get luke a bottle of water, huh? Okay. I thought we were gonna see you at that school-board hearing. Yeah. They suspended you, luke. 10 games. There's only 11 left. Not for you. Here you go! All right, jamie. Let's get going. Okay. Bye, uncle lucas. Cool hair. Wait for me right there, okay? Look, luke... I know from experience whatever answers you're looking for... You're not gonna find them like this -- trust me. I know it sucks that lindsey's dating, and it sucks that you grabbed that player, but don't make it worse. The darkness doesn't have any answers, luke. Okay, you silly rabbit. We're going to the beach. Yes, we are. Just me and my funny bunny. Did you hear that? Did you hear what I called you? Did you hear what mama -- Hello? Yes, this is she. But... There must be some mistake. She has eight days left. But she's recovering from surgery, so... No, I understand. Okay. Bye-bye. They want you to go home today. But that can't happen. Oh, well, well. What...what is all this not sure. I would laugh if this whole thing wasn't such a mess. What whole mess? You, your head -- All of it. You and I are going for a drive. But, first, we're gonna fix the ferret above your face. why? We're taking a drive because I'm your best friend and you need me. And we are fixing your... Very punk-rock haircut because I have a 5-year-old son who unfortunately wants to look just like his uncle lucas. so, How's the comeback going? It's not a comeback. Quentin says it is. Quentin's wrong. And, by the way, nobody's sporting the faux hawk anymore, dude. I'm bringing it back. So, what team do you think you're gonna play for in the nba? Jamie, come here. I know you're really excited about this, but... I'm probably never gonna play in the nba. Sure, you will. Geez, kiddo. You're playing with rolled-up socks? What happened to your ball? I lost it. I got to go feed chester I got to ask you something. Did you tell peyton that you hated her? Maybe. I was a little wasted. Luke, you can be such a jackass sometimes. She is in love with you. You probably broke her heart. Oh, I didn't break her heart. You're being dramatic. i'm being dramatic. Stop here. The light's green. Just stop. All right. We're sitting at a green light. Now what? Just wait for it. Haley, the light's green! Wait for what?! Kind of like peyton's heart, don't you think? I'll be right back. You shouldn't stay here. Okay. hey. You said it made you feel better. It's gonna be okay. All right. All clear, you goof. No peyton? No. You need to apologize to her. Hey, remember all the water-balloon battles we used to have up here? Don't change the subject. Actually, now that you mention it, it was junior year, the boy-toy auction. We had that water-balloon fight up here, and you saw my tattoo of nathan's jersey number for the first time. You mean your slutty little tramp stamp. I am <i>so</i> barely your friend right now. Sorry. The point is, I was so scared that night. I was falling in love for the first time, and I was so unsure. But I did it. And while it hasn't been easy, it has bn everything. We're not kids anymore, luke. You know... It really hurts me to wat what you're doing. Lindsey said no, hales I said yes. Don't give me that, luke. I'm being honest with you right now, and you need to be honest with yourself. What do you want? If lindsey's the girl that you're in love with, great. If it's peyton, great. If it's brooke, just please... Stop hiding your heart. I mean it. Hi. How's your day? Well, I cleaned the bathroom, washed the news van, returned some shoes for the weather lady because apparently the straps cut into her "cankles," and they hired a new sports guy -- steve. How about I buy you some lunch? Come on. Reverend howard carter. I did a little research. Man of faith, lived a good life. Tough run, though. Diabetes, stroke. You know, it's not exactly benevolent of you to lie there and take a heart that could be put to better use. In fact, it's really quite selfish. Don't you agree? "yeah, I agree. Yes, I do." Morning. Good morning. The reverend was looking a little uncomfortable. Would you like to give him this pillow? Actually... I just might. Hey, look. It's my mom doing the walk of shame. Maybe we should hire a nanny for <i>you.</i> Out with a guy you met on a porn site. Not porn -- erotica. Hey, buddy. Thought you might want to go for a swim. No, thanks. It's been a while. I don't think I've seen you in the pool since your accident. It's okay. I have to feed chester. Jamie, are you afraid? no. I just don't want to. Are you sure? It might be fun. No, thank you. Well, I think I found the problem. Brooke: you did? Yes. Uh, you have an incredibly cute baby here, and you don't want to send her home. But are you sure she's well enough? Brooke, angie's tough days are over, okay? And she was very brave about them. It's time for you to be brave. But I was supposed to have eight more days with her. We were supposed to go to the beach. Well, that's how the program works. They take the first flight available. Anyway, look, um... When the silence sets in... And it will -- Be proud of this. Okay? You've done a great thing here, brooke. But it's time for angie to go home... Today. Yeah. So you got something for me, man? Just shut up and check the ball, "q." oh. Crossover's a little rusty, son. Huh? Fake this guy. Ha ha ha. Where that a.c.c. Game at, nate? Hmm? First-team all-american? Nba lottery? Huh? ugh, Up out of here, man. Damn it! The fadeaway, nate? Really? Are you serious? The fadeaway is weak, man! Weak! Come on, man. Let's go again. No, man. I'm not feeling today. I'm done. Hey, j. Scott... Why don't you run out in the hallway and get us some waters? Okay. hey. You see any hot psycho nannies out there, you run back in here, okay? Not funny. What's going on, nate? I'm just out of shape. No, man. That ain't it. That is <i>not</i> it. Now, every day we do this, and every day you play soft. Well, maybe that's because I can't do this anymore. Really? Maybe you just scared to, right? Huh? Easier to have your dream taken away than give it a shot and fail, right? I'm not scared. Right? You not scared? Well, you playing scared. I'm not scared. You playing scared! I am <i>not</i> scared, man! I'm -- I'm afraid to go in the pool, daddy. Yeah, but, uh... You went in the pool all the time before your accident, jamie, and you loved it. You know you can still do it. I know. I'm just...scared. It's okay if you don't play anymore. Thanks, son. Haley: i'm dying here. You okay? Huh? Yeah. Uh, I-I just got a weird e-mail from mia saying she met this guy out on tour that said he knew ellie. So it just caught me off guard. How come you're dying? Oh, because I'm having trouble writing lyrics for this melody that you liked. Okay, what do you got so far? So far I've got nothing. All right. How about... "i hate you, bitch. You ruined my life"? Does that do anything for you? You know what? I do have some words for you, even though they're not mine. Lucas and i, we used to write our predictions every year before the school year started. Sort of what we hoped would happen. Lame. You know you're jealous. Kind of. Anyway, I'm gonna violate my friendship rule here because you're at, like, code red. "peyton sawyer will become peyton scott." That was, like, eighth grade. He got a little cocky sophomore year. "make out with peyton sawyer or more." And, "this year, i'll talk to peyton sawyer." "try again with brooke -- Brooke davis." Well, that... But, you know, this is how much he doesn't hate you. It's a whole lifetime's worth. I know. I know. That's -- That's what he writes. But what he says is a totally different story. Sometimes people write the things that they can't say. Come on in. It's open. hi. hi. This is nice, luke. Lindsey, what are you doing here? Uh... I needed to talk to you about something, but... You wouldn't answer your phone. You look good. You look hung over. Yeah, well... There's a girl I almost married started dating again. And after that, well, things just kind of went dark. The book's done. Oh, come on. The -- the ending needs work. I haven't even written a dedication yet. You can e-mail the dedication. The book's done, luke. It's perfect. So... I think this is goodbye. And goodbye shouldn't happen over the phone. Lindsey... Do you ever Miss me? I should go. What you doing, buddy? Looking at your trophies. You know, someday, you're gonna have your own trophies. Think so? Oh, yeah. I know so. Trophies, awards -- Maybe even a monument. And then maybe someday you'll have a son of your own that's even greater than any award or accomplishment. Come here. Don't be afraid to be great, son. Okay? 'cause you are. And the world isn't strong enough to beat james lucas scott. I promise. We love you. Hi, I'm steve, the new sports guy. Hi, steve. That's the better sports guy. The truth is, I'm scared, okay? The countdown's on. And I've got to wait for this damn beeper to go off before I can get a heart... After <i>you</i> get one. You're the one who's lived a good life. I'm the one who needs time to make amends. So why don't you just take one for the team, huh? And if you do... I'll use my time for redemption. Okay? You suck, carter. I love you, little girl, and I always will, okay? You're gonna have a great life. Don't forget me, okay? I'm james lucas scott! You got my message. I told you not to come. I know. She's gone, luke. I know. You did it, buddy. I knew you could. Come here. All right, you ready? Yeah! One... Both: two, three. Okay, carter... It's up to you. But sometimes a guy just needs a sign there's some hope for him, you know? Hope. ??? And telling the new sports guy off. But I should pbably get back to being shunned. I'm sorry it's so hard for you now. You know something? I stand by what I did. Luke was really hurting, and it just felt insidious somehow to broadcast that pain. Mouth, how many men's basketball championships has ucla -- 11. I don't know what to do now. Omaha. Not without you. Then I'll go, too. Really? U'd go with me? yes. I'd go anywhere with you, marvin mcfadden. Jamie, you're tracking water all over the house! I can't get him out of that pool now. Dude, dry off and get your jersey on. We're going back to the gym. We are?! Yeah. Nathan and jamie scott. Oh, jamie! You know what? You still make my heart race. You do. I'm serious. Feel this. ????and love and joy right now because of you. It's my other boy. All right. I'll see you. I love you. hey. Wow. Very peyton. Lindsey stopped by today. She's here? Uh, not anymore. I had to go see brooke. The trifecta. How nice. What did lindsey want? She wanted to tell me that my book's done. Well, everything except the dedication. She said I could e-mail that to her. I'm thinking about... Taking off for a little while, you know? Lucas, please stop running. Come on -- You got to let go of this dark weight you're carrying around. This morning... Nathan told me the darkness doesn't have any answers. He's right. You saw him after his accident. And look at him now. Yeah. You know that romantic notion that all the garbage and the pain is actually really healing and beautiful and sort of poetic? It's not. It's just garbage, and it's pain. You know what's better? Love. The day that you start thinking that love is overrated is the day that you are wrong the only thing wrong with love and faith and belief... Is not having it. Woman: hey, they want to do a conference call about the lucas scott galleys. Okay, just, uh, have them call my cell. And then you should take off. Thanks. Hey, lindsey, did you tell him? No. Bye. ??? Hi, luke. Just got your dedication...and... I guess I'm one of those lost souls because... I lied to you. I said I was seeing someone, and I wasn't. The truth is... I was afraid of the immensity of your love, and I thought... Well, I just wanted you to know. You asked me if I Miss you. Of course I Miss you. That's all I do. hi. hi They're supposed to call me as soon as angie's home safe. Where's peyton? I don't know. Probably at work. I didn't tell her angie was leaving for sure. And you told me not to come to the airport. Why? I don't like you guys to see me like this -- Vulnerable. That's how I always see you, brooke. And I think it's kind of beautiful. You know, um... I've been thinking about all the things you've done for... Angie and rachel and me and... All kinds of people. You save people, brooke davis. It's what you do. Thanks for letting me share that. You call me when she's home safe, okay? Hey, luke. We've been through a lot -- Me and you. I wouldn't have made it through today or a couple other days without you. So, thanks. You're welcome. This is for you. I love you, lucas scott. You know that? I love you, too, brooke davis. Okay, come on, guys! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, come on, come on! Rick, where are your pants?! Coffee accident. Well, we can get them at the break. Jerry, we're gonna lead with the ucla signing. Where is it? Right here. All right. Let's get it done. You're all set. I'm good. I got the prompter. Uh, you sure? Watch and be amazed. Okay, guys. Countdown begins. In 5, 4, 3, 2... Cue music. Go, camera one. Graphic out. And cue anchor. Good evening. I'm rick hunter. And this is the channel 11 evening news. It's national letter of intent day for big-time college basketball programs. Aneve gold is here with news of a local signing. Steve. That's right, rick, big news out of masonboro, where local phenom shane dorset has committed????on the west coast at ucla. Could have been you. Obviously the local poweouses are disappointed, but dorset cited ucla's once-proud legacy -- What's that? The prompter's down. Uh, go to rick. I-I don't think you want to do that. Uh, have him fill. Steve, fill. Um, as many of you know, ucla's mascot is a bruin, um, which is kind of a cute bear. Oh, for god's sake! Where's the prompter?! It's not up yet. Bill: should we go to commercial? All right, say exactly what I say. Dorsetited ucla's legacy. Just look at the camera and say, "dorset cited ucla's legacy." Dorset cited ucla's legacy. The bruins have 11 men's ncaa basketball championships... The bruins have 11 men's ncaa basketball championships... ...which is more than any other school. ...which is more??? They won seven consecutive titles from 1966o 1974. They won seven consecutive titles from 1966 to 1974... A streak that was broken by north carolina state in one of the greatest final-four ges of all time. Of course, sports fans may remember the last big area signing was tree hill's nathan scott, who played locally at tree hill high, gilmore college, and was ultimate a first-team all-american at the university of maryland. ...and ultimately was a first-team all-american... We'll be back after this. I'm -- say your name. We'll be back after this. I'm say your name. And we're out. Thank you. And for my encore... I quit. And it's the same guy that said he knew ellie. Oh, mia, if you see him tonight, can you have him call me? Hey, I got to go, okay? bye. I don't hate you. I remember the first time I ever saw you... All skinny arms and... Tanglemess of hair. It was hard letting you go, peyton. You know, it... It was hard losing you, peyton and it was hard seeing you again. And it's...still... Really hard. I know. While I'm asleep, I have this dream where... We're back in that hotel room in l.a., and you proposed to me. And every single time, I say yes. It's just a dream, right? It's my dream. I'm sorry. He... They did all they could. I'd like to send flowers. Well, if you want to leave your name and number... My name is dancott, and my number is 1. Come on, nate. Nba'a pipe dream, boy. You might as well give it on up. Come on, dad. You can  it. My god. What the hell was that? I don't know. I just... I can do this. I'm gonna do this. Oh, got it. Here you go. Let me give you a hand here. There you go. You folks be careful. You could get yourself killed out here. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, it's me. Look, I'm at the airport, and I've got two tickets to las vegas. Do you want to
