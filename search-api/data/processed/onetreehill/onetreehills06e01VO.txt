These are for you. Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you. How was your day? It was good. It is good. You know, i can't believe it's been a year. Time flies when you get what you wish for. Is it? Is it what you wished for, peyton? If i say it's more than that, Are you gonna tease me for being a dork? 'Cause it is. Well, i made dinner reservations for tonight if you want. Actually, i was thinking maybe we could just stay in and have a quiet dinner, And there is a chance i could be rocking some slightly dirty-Girl lingerie underneath these jeans. I think i need to sit down. Why? You okay? Yeah. You look nice. Thanks, but i still haven't gotten ready yet. Doesn't matter. How come after a year of marriage You're still so sweet to me? Because you're you. And because you deserve it. You make it all too easy. I better get ready. Hey, linds. It's easy with us, isn't it? Yeah. It's the easiest. There he is. Come on now, son.

Oh, i got it. There you go. Let me give you a hand here. Hi, it's me. Look, i'm at the airport, and i got two tickets to vegas. Do you want to get married tonight? You folks be careful. You could get yourself killed out here. Getting married, huh? I hope so. I don't know. We'll see if she shows up. She'll show. I want to tell you something, son. It's the most important thing there is -- Love, Finding the right person to spend your life with. I know i made the right choice. That's where they get you -- Thinking you got a choice. Love finds you, son. You don't find love. It's got a little bit to do with destiny, fate, What's written in the stars, And a lot to do th the simple fact That most women are smarter than we are. And wily. Your sorry butt never had a chance. But if you want to believe that you had a choice in the matter, I'd say you made a good one. Why is that? Because she showed up. And she sure is pretty. You are such a mess. You can't just call a girl from the airport. Peyton, i know this sounds crazy. You're a mess, lucas scott, But you're my mess, and i love you. I ??? Because ??? S none of your business. As a matter of fact, none of my actual business Is any of your business because i fired you. No, you were my mother. I fired you from that job, too. Look, i have to go. Someone is at the door. And don't bother calling me back. Just talk to my lawyer. I have nothing left to say to you. Bitch. Well, i have a few things to say to you. Unbelievable! I can't understand why you've become such a hurtful, spiteful little snot to me. But it is what it is. I can take it. Our company, however, cannot. Our company? I'm sorry, i believe it's my company, Because you were fired, And i do not recall inviting you in, You botoxed vampiress. You see? This is what i'm talking about. You're such a child, and a fairly stupid one at that. It doesn't matter that you fired me. I'm your legal partner, missy. It's my company. I'm the designer. No, it's our company -- 50-50. At least it is for now. And what is that supposed to mean? Designers come and go. It's the brand that matters, and i grow the brand. And the board knows that, and they can fire you. So, what? You're gonna have a magazine called "b. Davis" Without b. Davis? Paul frank doesn't work for paul frank. Happens all the time. Really? And what are you gonna sell, mother? Magic beans? Without my designs, you have nothing. I know it. You know it. And as soon as the board sees my unbelievable new line, They'll know it. And you'll be the one who's out on her nip-And-Tucked ass. We'll see about that. Get out of my house. I hope this new line Is by far the best work you've ever done, Or it's "goodbye, company, hello, community college." If you can get in. This is ridiculous, the way we have to sneak around. Yeah. We're making out in a car like high-School kids. Yeah, but personally, you did rock that cheerleading outfit. Not the point, but thank you. Oh. Okay. You right. We just gonna have to go public. Yeah. I'm gonna say, "nate, look i'm dating your mom -- Sleeping with her, doing all kind of freaky stuff to her." So, you want to tell him, or should i? Sneaking around is kind of hot. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, buddy. What you doing? Working on an idea for clothes over bros That's totally gonna fix brooke's inventory problems. Are you okay? I quit my job. Okay. You know what? It's their loss. Thank you. Can i ask you something? Were you serious about moving with me to omaha? Yes. Well, they have that sports job for me, But i have to be there in three days. I'll tell brooke i'm leaving. I know it's sudden, millie. It's okay. She'll understand. Life's sudden sometimes. I know it's sudden. This is real, isn't it? Yeah. Tell me again. Yes, it's real. Good. I'm glad.

Well, the thing is, Brooke doesn't want you to see the line, And brooke's my boss, so i'm afraid i can't help you. Can't or won't? Won't. You don't like me, do you? No. Because you feel i've mistreated you. No. Because you're an evil bitch. You're gonna payor that. I wouldn't recommend that. I mean, broken leg, broken ribs. It's gonna be a little hard for you to speak for a while. Quite a bit of trauma to your throat. And if you can't speak... You ??? Do you know her? No it's okay. I was hoping you might recognize her from school. It's hard to tell from that. It sucks that you had to go through that. I'm sorry. It's fine. In the grand scheme of things i have to deal with, This is really nothing. Why, what else is going on? Oh, do you remember someone by the name of victoria davis? ??? Yeah. It's okay. Me, too. I actually wanted to tell you and peyton about it at the same time. Is she here? I have not seen her. She didn't come home last night. I don't know if i should be worried. Well, apparently not. "Don't worry about me. I'm fine." Peyton. "Don't worry about me. I'm fine." Well, at least she's being thorough. Oh, it's not from her. What? Lucas. No! Okay, uh, responsible "I have not been attacked by psycho derek" text message sent. Good. Responsible "i know i've been dark lately, But everything's okay" message sent. Oh... It's from you. Hmm.

Still here. Did you think it was a nightmare? Because it is for you. You know... When i think how jamie and i would be together right now If it wasn't for you -- Well, it wasn't very nice what you said to me in that hotel room. You said if ever came back, If i ever came near jamie, You'd kill me. Didn't you? You strangled me, and you took jamie. And i suppose you thought that was the last of me. But it wasn't. I've been watching you with jamie. I've been biding my time. And now, well... Here we are. Mom. Oh, for god's sakes, mom. What? What is going on with you? Is this some kind of grandmother midlife crisis? Would you keep it down, please? The neighbors will hear you. She's a grandmother. My mom is a grandmother. Nathan, stop it. Just... Just go away. I want to know who he is, mom -- Mr. Porno. Give me a name. No. Why? Because i want to know who's responsible For you losing your mind like this. Oh. I'm gonna find out. And put some clothes on. Jamie's home. If he sees you topless, he's gonna be scarred for life. I know i am. Man, that was close. I told you this was a bad idea. Shh. Where's my top? You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. I can't go. What? Why? Victoria. Ohh. I just got chills when you said that. She's trying to take the company from brooke. Can she do that? Apparently, she can, And i told her you were leaving, And she thinks i'm going with you, But brooke needs me right now. She's been so good to me. Yeah. Hey... I love you... And i want to be with you, and i will, but -- You stay, And i'll get us settled in omaha. It's the right thing to do for brooke. But it's really gonna hurt. The funny thing about painkillers -- It's such a delicate balance. Not enough morphine, And you'd be in horrible, agonizing discomfort. Too much, and... well, you'd be dead. Your head must be spinning right now. How did jamie's sweet nanny carrie get to be your nurse? Well, rest assured, i am a very good caretaker. When my father got sick, I had to move in and do everything -- Feed him, bathe him, medicine. I mean, eventually he died, but still. Anyway, what's it gonna be? Dead... Or agony? Agony.

This ring was my mom's. I know it's...selfish -- You know, getting married like this. No friends, no family, no ring. It's okay. But i want to be selfish with you. And it's been way too long. And life just always seems to get in the way with us. And i know this is las vegas, And it's not exactly how you imagined it. But it's gonna be romantic. I promise. This isn't right. No, it's okay. It is. I just want to be your wife. Peyton, i want that, too. I do, but, i mean... What the hell was i thinking? I mean, this is supposed to be a dream come true, not... ...this. Hey. I got an idea.
