Your mom is gone, Peyton. But your biological mother is alive. Are you and Haley fighting? My problem is with anybody who just vanishes and then waltzes back in and expects to be instantly forgiven. You know, we could totally have a summer-like fling, just in the fall. And non-exclusive. There wasn't a moment when I was away that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill. I'm going to High Flyers. Unlike you, I'm taking my heart with me. We're not brothers. We're not even friends. Three months ago, someone tried to kill me. And when I find out who did this to me -- and I will find out soon -- the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble. Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "Live each season as it passes. Breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each." Well, well. Look who's starting a fire. Rise and shine. Nice of you to knock. I didn't want to wake you, sleeping bitchy. Besides, I had to get the list ready. What list? This list. What is that exactly? Since you and I are both officially available again and tonight is the end-of-summer beach party -- which means partial, if not total, naked nudity -- I have made a list of all of the available guys, so that we can avoid the pain and hardship of another Lucas love triangle. You mean the Lucas that you're supposedly dating? Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't get any of that. Did you just say something about me puking at a rave? I said, "the Lucas you're supposedly dating." Non-exclusively. - Huh. - What "huh"? I have dated multiple guys before. Yeah, I know. In fact, you are the queen of the multiple-boy dating scenario. I'm just surprised you're doing it with Lucas. You know what they say. When it comes to boys, I'm full of surprises. But I thought you were the new, responsible Brooke. Uh, so last season. Responsible Brooke is good, but party Brooke is gooder. Check it out. I get Lucas, Mouth, half the guys on the team -- I put my first choices here, but we can totally mix and match. Any and all lifeguards, Nathan's uncle Cooper -- so hot -- Larry. Whoa! Larry like my dad Larry? Of course! He's my hot-dad fantasy. Peyton, he is a total dilf. And, besides, I gave you Dan. And I get Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters. You get Jake, as promised, Nathan -- but he comes with an asterisk, because nobody knows what is going on with him and Haley in high school married limbo. The other half of the guys on the team, Anna -- because, well, you never know, and she was totally into you. And all the river court boys -- Skills, Fergie, and Garbage. Junk. Right. And, finally, the rest of the Foo Fighters. Why do you get Dave Grohl? I want Dave Grohl. No way. So I get a fugitive and a married guy. Fine. You take Dave Grohl. I'm taking Anna. - Deal. - Deal. Okay. Nighty-night. Thanks. Bye. You're back. Maybe. Maybe you're just high and seeing things. So I guess you're still pissed at me, which, personally, I think is crap. But you tell me. Are we friends? I'll tell you what. I'll play you for it -- game to 11. Make it, take it... for our friendship. Game. Where are you going? You lost. I guess that means we're still not friends. Hiya, new roommate. Getting all moved in? Uh, with the six feet that you gave me? Yeah. Sure. Good. Thank you. Hey,  great idea. What? Wearing your wedding ring -- it's like a total aphrodisiac for some guys. I just need it to be an aphrodisiac for one guy. Why? Do you have a new guy? For Nathan, Brooke. Hmm, I see. About him -- I notice you haven't unpacked. A little naive, don't you think? No. No, I'm just stalling. I mean, it's like if I unpack, my split with Nathan will be more real. I hate to say it, but it's real enough already. Yeah, I know. Okay. No, no, none of that. Come here. I have a surprise for you. Come on, come on. This will be fun. This is totally gonna cheer you up. Whoa! Wha-- this is amazing. When did you do this? Last night, while you were sleeping. You totally sleep like a dead person. Shut up. This looks awesome. Thanks. By the way, I'm kind of gonna need to ask for next month's rent now, 'cause I sort of spent this month's rent on the couch and the rugs and things. Okay, although you really shouldn't have to pay for this stuff yourself. We're roommates now. I'll go half. - Really? - Yeah. I  was hoping you'd say that, 'cause I kind of ate half your rainbow sherbet last night while I was hanging the wall mural. Where'd you get it, anyway? The freezer? The wall mural. Oh, Peyton made it for me. It's the french riviera. Gosh, I haven't talked to Peyton in, like, forever. Lucas filled me in on her mom situation. What the heck? Yeah, the mom situation's on high alert right now 'cause Ellie's back in town. How's Peyton taking it? Well... There she is now. She's sending me a last-minute flyer for the party tonight. Speaking of which, you are not allowed to sulk tonight. I don't sulk. You sulk. You're a sulker. But tonight, you're gonna have fun. After all, it's a party. It's supposed to be... dark and depressing? Well, you asked how she's taking it. There you go. Hi, Peyton. Last time I saw you, you were slamming a door in my face. So let's have it. What's that? The heart wrenching, yet inspirational tale of a young girl's complex decision to part with the daughter she desperately loves. Actually, it's not that complex. At the time I got pregnant, I liked drugs more than I liked you. That's it. I'm a different person now, Peyton. But those decisions are still mine. I can't change that. And what? So you -- you're just coming to make peace with yourself? That is so screwed up. You can't just crawl out of your hole after 17 years and cause a plague like some kind of locust. For what it's worth, I crawled out of my hole a long time ago. Your father wouldn't let me see you. I don't believe you. You used to sit under a bridge by the river... you and a brunette girl who wore a little too much eye makeup for a 10-year-old. She tried to see me... like seven years ago, but you sent her away! That's right. How could you do that? Because I'm your dad and it was my call. Unbelievable. - Peyton. - Forget it! Peyton! Hey! I understand you're upset. But don't be slamming doors and stomping your little chicken ass around this house while I'm talking with you. I am still your father. But you're not my father, are you? When Ellie gave you up, she agreed not to see you. Had your mother lived, we would have told you. It would have been up to you. But when she died, I decided it would be too hard, too confusing for you. Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe it was a mistake. You know what, dad? This -- this is you, okay? Kind of a broken record lately, don't you think? You know, Peyton, one of these days you're gonna grow up and you won't have all the answers. You weren't even 10 years old when Ellie showed up. She had a drug habit, she moved around a lot. It wasn't even a year after your mother had died and  you were in a pretty rough place emotionally. And if you ask me, you still are. And guess what? So am I. I could not risk exposing you to her. No way -- not then. Fine! Fine -- not then. Okay, but what about sometime in, oh, I don't know, the last eight years? What about then? Or, like, what about now? I suppose now is up to you. Hey, you. "Hey" back at you. 1972's outside. It wants its furniture back. You mock, but you don't know. Try out the couch. Nice. No, I said... try out the couch. I like this couch. I thought you would. Oh, way too early in the day for me to see this. Well, what hour would you prefer to watch us? Oh, how about never o'clock? Or maybe, uh, I don't know, quarter after stab out my eyes? Either one's really good for me. By the way, that couch has not been staingarded yet. You may want to get a room instead. Well, if we get a room, then you're gonna be stuck on this tiny couch. That's a good point. Give me a minute. We'll go to the beach. Brooke asked me to help her out. And by "Brooke," you mean your part-time girlfriend Brooke? Yeah. We're gonna set up for the end-of-summer thing. What's  up with that, anyway? Well, you see, there's a season called "summer," Haley. And when that ends, another season called "fall" starts right up. Oh okay. Rephrasing -- what's up with the part-time girlfriend stuff? I don't know yet. Right now, we're on Brooke's terms. But I'll keep you posted. Oh, gee, thanks. I also came to check on you. I was worried about you. Nathan was in a pretty bad mood this morning at the river court. I thought that might have something to do with you. Nathan's home? You... didn't know he was back? No. No,  I didn't. I'm sorry, Haley. I thought you knew. Can you just, um, tell Brooke that I'll see her tonight? Well, well. If it isn't my beloved daughter-in-law. Haley, it's so nice of you to come by and check on me following my accident. Oh, by the way, I think I found a pair of your black gloves. Leather, right? Uh, no, I-I don't own any black gloves, Mr. Scott. I know your parents aren't around, so call me "dad." I'd really just like to see Nathan. He didn't tell you he was coming home. Sometimes I'm so proud of that kid. Can I fix you a drink? I hear you rock stars are big drinkers, right? Well... suit yourself. Deb said you moved out. Yeah. It sucks, huh? My marriage is over. Who knew you and I would have so much in common, after all? Could you please just tell Nathan that I'm here? Oh, he's not home. We had an agreement. Hi, Larry. Long time. Not long enough. You'll forgive me if I skip the love and go straight to the "you've got a lot of nerve" part. Peyton is a real mess right now. - I'm sorry about that. - You caused it! No, I think you caused it by not telling her about me. Don't even go there, Ellie! You agreed to stay away! Yeah, well, things change! You have a right to be pissed. I said I'd stay away, but my situation has changed. And now I would like to get to know Peyton... with your blessing, of course. That is not going to happen. You gave her up. You have to live with that. And now, thanks to your change of heart, so does Peyton. Stay away from us. You think this is enough? For a campfire, not a bonfire. I'll get some more before I pick you up, all right? Oh. I was thinking about riding in with Peyton and playing the field tonight. The field. Right. We said non-exclusively. Yes, I know, but... Well, I'm not sure you're gonna be able to handle this whole non-exclusive thing. Oh, ho! You don't say? Well, I mean, pretty soon you're obviously gonna fall for me. And then you're gonna have to break up with all those guys and that's just gonna get ugly. I see. I'm just looking out for you. Well, thanks, I think I'll be fine. - You're sure? - I'm sure. Well, since the work's done, I think I'm gonna go for a little swim. You, uh, want to come look out for me some more? Sure. I'll catch up. Okay. What's up, mom? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Sure. - What does "woot" mean? - "Woot"? Yeah. You know, I have this hip new café. I need to be s sure that my vocabulary is current. Right. Well, "woot" would be like "yahoo." Oh, okay. So I would go like, "woot!" No, mom. You would never go like that. As a matter of fact, never do that again. But if "woot" is "yahoo," then what is "what-what"? You want to know the difference between "woot" and "what-what"? Yeah. You know, like, "what-what!" Mom, seriously -- never again. You got to lay off the hip-hop. This is Andy's influence, isn't it? When's he coming back, anyway? Well, I'm not so sure that he is coming back. Why not? Because, Lucas, Andy wanted kids. He wanted to start a family and I'm not sure that I want the same. Oh. So, what? Your first kid was so rotten that I scared you from trying again. Essentially, yes, that's it. Andy's a wonderful guy. He deserves a family. And then there's Keith. What about Keith? I've been thinking about him a lot. As a matter of fact, I, uh, thought I saw him in town the day I left for New Zealand, the day of the fire at Dan's dealership. You know, maybe I should go. I got a lot of errands to run before this beach party tonight. End-of-the-summer beach party -- what-what! Hey. I saw your car. I-I didn't know you were home. Yeah, I know. Did you get the letters I sent? Yeah. It's good to see you. Look, Haley, I can't do this, all right? What? You can't do what? You can't talk to me? You didn't even tell me you were home, Nathan. What were you gonna do, pass me in the hallway at school and not say a word? I didn't even know if you would be in school. I told you, I'm back for good. Anyway, um, I don't know if you heard, but I'm staying in our apartment. Brooke rented it and asked me to be her roommate. You and Brooke, huh? Yeah. I did not see that coming. Oh, by the way, if this basketball thing doesn't work out, you may have a future as a painter. Nathan, we have some decisions to make. Yeah. Yeah, we do. Yeah. Well, uh, I guess I'll beat the beach tonight. There's a party. Yeah. You've changed. Yeah. I guess I have you to thank for that. Okay, not exactly your finest hour in party attire. But who knows? Somedy might go for the homeless-girl look. You know I don't even want to go to this thing. I know. But because Mouth is throwing himself his own personal pity party over Erica Marsh, you, P. Sawyer, as you know, are my D.J. Besides, this is the last end-of-summer beach party we're gonna have before we're seniors. Oh, come on. You know you were gonna have another chance next year after you flunk out and have to repeat a grade. See? That's the spirit... sort of. A little mean, but it's a start. Speaking of mean, please don't be to Haley tonight, okay? Let's party. Come on. It's about time! Can we light the bonfire now? Can  we? Can we? Oh, look, it's Tim. I had a dream you died. Darn. Check it out. I brought some really cool stuff to burn. I got cleaning supplies, some army men, some rotten fruit. And there's this dead animal down the beach that would burn really cool! Come to think of it, Tim, you might burn really cool. Let's sacrifice a virgin. Sweet! Like who? Crap! Cops! Hey, Brooke. What's going on? You got cups for us? Sure, boys, right this way. I'm sorry. I thought they were 5-O. I-I'm sure there's still... some... People have had fire rituals since the beginning of time. For some people, it's witchcraft. For others -- religion. But for us, it marks the beginning of our senior year! I know we have to go back to school soon. But tonight, as long as this fire burns, summer is still ours. Look who it is -- the kissing bandit. Did you fondle anyone while I was away? I should apologize. I won't, but I should. That kiss was a reckless mistake, sort of like Lucas. That was a joke. Funny. No wonder you're getting a divorce. How's that going, by the way? Why? Are you ready for round two? Hmm. I'm sorry, I just threw up a little in my mouth. Could I just have a coffee, please? Sure, just let me spit in it first. Or maybe you could drug it. You know, Karen, as I recall, you were pretty angry with me the day of the fire. You know what, Dan? If you're looking for people who were pretty angry with you, you might start at "A" in the phone book. You mean "A" as in "Andy"? Or maybe "B" as in Boozy? What do we hear from rag-doll Keith these days, anyway? What are you trying to say? The fire wasn't an accident? Why? Is that what you're saying? You know what? I think I'm gonna play the old "right to refuse service" card. You can get out. You said I could have a coffee. Well, let's just call that a reckless mistake. Hmm. Fair enough. Say "hi" to Andy for me. That is, if you ever see the little guy again. You know what? If someone did try to kill you, I'm sorry they failed, Dan. Maybe next time they won't... whoever they were. Who wants to swim with naked Tim? Who wants to get drunk and have sex with him? I know they call its kinny-dipping, but you want to try anyway? I'm pregnant, you idiot. I'm cool with that. Hey. How's that casual-dating thing working out for you? So-so. It could be worse. Nathan didn't even show up. I don't blame you. What's that? This music, it's enough to drive anyone to drink. Mom stuff? I don't know. I don't feel like I owe Ellie a thing, you know? But I still feel guilty sometimes for freezing her out. Yeah? I mean, is trusting someone always gonna be impossible in my life? Maybe I should at least try with her. There's that look again. What look? I don't have a look. Dude, you've got a tell the size of J.Lo's ass. What have you got on Ellie? Luke, if I'm about to make a huge mistake, please, just help me out. The thing is... I saw her buying drugs in the park today. I'm sorry. No. God. You know what? It -- it makes all the sense in the world, you know? She said she was clean, but, so far, all she's done is lie. Anyway, so... Is this a funeral? Will you please play something that doesn't make me want to shoot up and die? Thank you. I need a drink. If I were looking for a guy to go skinny-dipping with, would you be that guy? Can I be that guy in 20 minutes? Mmm... I'll give you 15, then I'm going wide with the offer. How come you're not at the party? How come you're not in the gym? You know that little one-on-one game? That was a joke. You better get yourself in shape. Otherwise you're gonna be completely worthless to me this season -- instead of mostly worthless, like you are now. I know why you're here, Nathan. Haley's not going away, you know. Dude, for once, could you just mind your own damn business? As soon as you forgive her and try to work things out. She loves you, Nate! And is that supposed to make everything okay? Yeah, it is. You're an idiot. You know something, Nathan?! I've tried with you! But sometimes I wonder why I bother! - Then don't. - Fine! I won't! You want to be a coward? Fine. Stay here and hide. Don't go to the party. But if you think I'm gonna let you mistreat Haley, you're wrong. Don't try it for a second. Because if you do, I'm gonna hurt you. Jackass. Well, at least she won't drown naked. Hey, Tutor Girl, check it out. The stars are blue. Do your song. Uh, no, thanks. Why not? 'Cause I don't want to. Oh, come on, don't be stuck up. Look, I'll sing the Chris Keller part. - Tim, I really don't want to sing. - Please? Let me -- Nathan's back. Lucas. Hey. You having fun yet? Are you? Yeah. You know, we're never gonna be here again, Luke. Seniors, summer -- you got to enjoy it. No, you're right. We should enjoy it, you know? But do you think that if we're never gonna be here again, then maybe we should make it mean something, too? Brooke Davis! Do not put your clothes on! Um... The field calls. Hey, girly. I left you like a million messages. Where have you been? Around. Drinking, huh? I should probably join you, with the night I'm having. It's like, Tim wants me to play, Nathan won't even talk to me. Well, it's not like you don't deserve it. Hey. Can I talk to you? I wanted to say I'm sorry. I should have told you I was back in town. It's okay. Not really. Look, I've been avoiding you because I'm still mad, Haley, about everything. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Do you know the last two times I came to the beach? For our wedding and to burn the wedding wall. So that's what happened to it. Well, first I broke it in half with the keyboard I bought you, and then I burned it. Sorry. Nathan, I need to ask you something, and I really don't want you to take it the wrong way, but... I need to know what you want from me or from us. What are we now? I don't know. What do you want us to be? I don't know, Haley. I can't answer that right now. I can. I want us to be together. Why? I mean, we're so far away from who we used to be. Why even fight for it? Because I love you. Listen... Basketball season's coming up and I'm -- I'm gonna concentrate on that. So you should do your thing, whatever it is -- school, music -- something other than me. Because I really don't know when I'm gonna be ready for us again... or even if I'll be ready for us at all. Nathan, don't say that. God -- Haley, i'm not saying it to be mean, okay? I don't -- I don't like hurting you. I'm just trying to be honest. I'm gonna head back. Nathan... I'm not going anywhere. Okay. And then... ... there were two. That's not so bad. This is how we started last school year, and look how good that turned out. Let's take a walk. Give me a minute. What's going on, guys? What's up? You got a second? Sure. What's up? I'm the guy for you. I know we're just part-time, and that's cool. You know, do whatever, have your fun. But one of these nights, you're gonna realize it. I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis. You'll see. You guys take it easy. Here. It used to be my cocaine vial. I thought you might like it, considering you were buying drugs today. It's gonna be okay, Hales. As a matter of fact, I think that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship... again. Transcript: Raceman - Synchro: Amariss
