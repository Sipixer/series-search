Lucas: have you ever wondered what marks our time here... if one life can really make an impact on the world... or if the choices we make matter? Sometimes, in order to move forward, You have to go back. In this case, just a few minutes. So, the doctor said you're fine, you and the baby? Yeah. We're fine. We are all gonna be fine. Listen... there's a reason that i played so bad tonight at first. What do you mean? Nathan, look out! Aah! Haley! Haley! Baby! Baby! Oh, god! What happened?! They just hit her, man! I'll call 911! Lucas, stay with her. Son of a bitch! What did you do?! Nathan! He's dead. You killed him, son. Go on. Dad? Hay needs you, nathan. Your child needs you. Go! She's been hit by a car. You've got to help her. She's pregnant. Man: what's her name? Uh...haley. How long has she been pregnant? I don't know. A few... come on, haley. If -- If sh-- He passed out. I got him. Hold on. Heart's not beating. I got a full cardiac arrest. Requesting backup. Hey! Excuse me. Can you tell me what's happening? Hi, luke. Keith, it's you, right? You're alive. Not exactly. What do you mean, "not exactly"? All in good time, luke. We don't want to be late. Late for what? Haley. What happened to her? You don't remember? I... there was an accident. It was no accident. I was right there with haley. I was standing right there. Oh. My heart. Your heart isn't the only one that's breaking right now. Come on. There's been an accident. Lucas and haley are in the hospital. It's bad, peyton, it's really bad. Come on. I'll drive. It's not fair. Peyton -- All these bad things keep happening ther. Good things happen to her, too, luke. Like you. Okay, look, i don't understand this. I mean, what are you, keith? An angel? A bad dream? More like a guide. A guide? To where? Luke, you just had a heart attack. You're not even breathing right now. So, what -- I'm dead? Not yet. Well, then you -- No, i'm dead. Sorry. And what about haley? Haley's not good. Nathan? What's happening? How's haley? She's being prepped for surgery. She has multiple fractures of the legs, some head trauma, Possible collapsed lung, broken ribs, And a good deal of internal bleeding. What about the baby? With this kind of severe trauma... we're gonna do everything that we can. But right now, our priority s saving your wife. So... is she gonna be okay? Is she gonna lose the baby? Well, that hasn't been written yet. You know what? This sucks. All these decent people, And bad things keep happening to them. I mean... you were a good guy, keith. So? So, you got shot for it! Peyton lost both mothers, she gets shot and attacked. Haley's now in surgery. Meaning what? Meaning...what's the point of being a good person If this is how it goes? So, you're asking if, by being a good person, Have you changed anything? You know, considering apparently I'm lying on my deathbed right now, yes. Well, let's take a look. Recognize her? No. Is it brooke? What happened to her? Why don't you go ask her? It's okay. Go on. Hey, brooke? What's wrong? Get away from me. What's wrong? I said get away from me! What? What is this? This is the world that would have been If you had led a different life, luke. What about real life, huh? Real life is still there. Nathan... how's haley? She's in surgery. And lucas? I don't know. It should have been me. It was all my fault. No, it wasn't. It was an accident -- Like the bridge. No, it wasn't. And now haley's in surgery, and even if she makes it, The baby could -- She could still lose the baby. And lucas could die. My dad's in jail. Nathan... i wish i would have died under that water. None of this would have happened. It's ok Nathan Why'd you have to save me, keith? Huh? If i would have died, t hen there's no daunte, And there's no accident. And haley and the baby are fine. Come on, keith! You can save me, but you can't answer me? Thanks for nothing. So, it was you. No, it was him. Most people are stronger than they know. They just...forget to believe in it sometimes. It's my fault. I wanted to win the state championship. I could have let him lose that game. I should have been more supportive of him and haley. Right. Well, let's take another look at that world -- You know, the one where you're a lesser guy. Come on. Do you have the new haley james album? On vinyl. Nice. Yeah, i got a promo copy right here. You know she's from tree hill? Yeah, i know. I take it you're not a fan. She never went back, luke. I don't believe it. They loved each other. Yeah, they did. But you never went to new york to ask her to come back. That doesn't mean she didn't love him, That they weren't meant to be. But without you, haley stayed out on tour, And by the time she came home, Nathan's pride was just too much to overcome. Pride gets in the way Of a lot of good things in this life, luke. Journey. Man, i used to love journey. Keith. Oh, yeah. You remember when you went to that beach party And how you took the time to go and talk to nathan? That mattered, luke. It all matters. Come on. All right, step away from the cure albums. Hi, max. Hi, peyton. So, i heard about lucas. How's he doing? He's not so good. Haley's not so good. Nathan's not good. Nobody's good. I guess i should be in church or something, But somehow i ended up here. Hey. First time you ever came in here, You remember what you were looking for? No, and hopefully, you don't, either. "Like a stone" by audioslave. At least, that's what you said you were looking for. I kind of always thought you were looking for a little faith. Most days, i think you still are. Then again, i'm 32. I live with my parents. What the hell do i know? I just want to believe everything will be okay. Lucas and haley and the baby -- I just really, really want to believe it's gonna be okay. Yeah, i know. I tell you what. Middle bin, four albums in -- That's where your answers are. Latoya jackson? All right, five albums in. La rocca. Track 10. It's on me. And, peyton... ..you're way too young not to believe it's gonna be okay. Thank you. www.1000fr.com present Capture:FRM@ Sync:FRM@Ð¡D</font> Seeing your mom still takes my breath away. Even though, technically, you don't have any breath? I do. I just saw myself in the hall. I guess i'm still breathing for now. She feels guilty for letting you play. It's my fault. I didn't take my pills. Yeah, you know what? That was a pretty stupid thing to do, luke. I was trying to win a state championsh. Anyway, are spirits allowed to call people stupid? I'm dead. I can say whatever the hell i want. Yeah, well, it wasn't very nice. Not taking your pills wasn't, either. Yes, i know that, but you don't have to call me stupid. So... what if i don't wake up? I don't know. You tell me. You don't know. You know, for a spirit, you suck at this. What do you want me to say? Well, i want to know if there's a heaven. I want to know about eternal life and all that stuff. I want to know... if we're ever gonna see each other again. Well, we're seeing each other now, right? Man, you really suck at this, keith. All right, get out. What are you in such a hurry for? We're running out of time. For what? The reason i came here. Why are we in the high school? Keith? Oh, god. What is this? I don't want to be seeing this. Take it away. Take it away. What is this? This is where i was murdered, luke. You know that. But why are you showing this to me? I don't want to see it. We got to talk about what happened here, lucas. There are things you need to know. Do you remember what you saw that day When you carried peyton out of the school? I saw jimmy pointing a gun at you. I still can't believe he killed you. Then why do you? I shouldn't have gone back into that school. Luke... no, you would still be alive if i'd just stayed away. No, luke, i wouldn't. How can you say that? You still can't see it, can you? It's okay. You will. Thought i'd find you here. I remember when i found you down here After your mom died. THAT WAS 8 YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW ELLIE USED TO WATCH US DOWN HERE? SHE TOLD ME THAT ONCE. IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE THAT THIS TIME, PEYTON. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE LUCAS AND HALEY THE WAY YOU LOST ELLIE AND YOUR MOM.
