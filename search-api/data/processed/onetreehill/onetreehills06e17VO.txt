I thought I was in charge of the school paper and had final say on what went in it. You do. And I have final say on whether or not you work here. That was the Charleston chiefs. You're looking at their newest point guard. I had sex last night. It was a mistake. It was supposed to be you. I know. Brooke says she needs a buyer in New York for costumes. Maybe I should go. I think that might be best. What's that. Grandpa? That's the thing that makes noise when it's time for me to get better. I want you to have this. It means we're going steady. This is so wrong... but it's... so right. You need to go. Why? What did I do? You know what you did. Most girls like that. Well not me. I'm gonna take a shower. And when I get out. I want you gone. I don't understand why it's such a big deal. Because I don't do that! I'm a mother for God's sakes. Look Brooke. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Okay? Really. I promise. You promise? I promise Okay you caught me a little off guard there. Understandable. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I freaked out. Just as long as it doesn't happen again. You have my word. Never again will I say the words "I love you." Even though I do in fact love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Quit it! Millie? Marvin. What are you doing here? Picking up the rest of my stuff. I'm sorry. I talked to Skills. He said you'd be at work all day. That's funny. Skills told me to be here all day to wait for the cable guy. Now I'm thinking he just unplugged the cable. So, how's New York? It's nice. I missed it. It's a really exciting place to be. That's good. You know things have been pretty exciting in Tree Hill. People are losing their minds over this movie business. And I met the guy who's playing me. It's totally weird. I could have sent that to you. I came to get my car. I'm driving it back. I thought the whole point of New York was that you didn't need a car. Yeah but I've decided to stay on a more permanent basis. So... I guess this is goodbye for a while then. Actually it's goodbye forever. Hello? Anybody home? Geez! Haley. Sorry. I'm really sorry. You know bad hearts run in my family. I know. It's a good thing I know cpr. What is this? You send me a cryptic text telling me to meet you at this strange address. What have you been doing in Charleston? What do you think? Have we ever spent this day apart? No. Come on. You couldn't come home this weekend so I just decided to bring home to you. Happy anniversary Nathan Scott. Since it's just you and me tonight I am going to let you stay up past bedtime and watch "Thomas & friends." I'd rather watch "Gossip girl." It's so bad for me. Keep dreaming. Okay you're pretty good at math so I'm guessing Orval is joining us again for dinner. If he even touches my pepperoni I will kick his imaginary butt. Easy nanny Deb. It's not for Orval. That was fast. The pizza's here. Hello Deb. You're looking... old. Grandpa Dan! There's my guy. What do you wantDan? I invited him. Don't you know there's a rule about letting pregnant women lie? Is that "lie" as in "sleep" or "lie" as in. "of course you're the baby's father"? No. It's "lie" as in "sleep." but that too. You know you're gonna feel really bad about that when you see my surprise. Really? Has the surprise anything to do with the reason you didn't come to bed last night? Maybe. You ready to have your world rocked? Not so much. You got morning sickness again. Yeah sure. You okay? Let's get you to bed. The doctor said you need to take it easy. I want to see the surprise. It's not a good idea. I want to see it. Peyton... Like you said this is our house now. It's beautiful. Peyton... I'm just gonna need a minute. We haven't even picked out names yet. I was thinking "Anna." "Anna" for a little girl after my mom. Come on. Don't. Or maybe. um... maybe "Sawyer" for a boy... Sawyer Scott. We need to take a couple days and process this okay? When I think about all the time I thought maybe I didn't want a baby like I... like I couldn't handle it... Peyton, it doesn't work like that. The universe doesn't punish you for being afraid. I know. I know. But I can't do it. Listen the doctor... I know what he said. If you have this baby... you could die. It doesn't matter. I'm gonna have this baby. The doctor didn't say something could happen to you. He said there was a very good chance. Peyton he said we could lose the baby anyway. Look, we... we don't have to make this decision now okay? We can...take a couple days before we go back in. Okay? For an abortion. That is not what the doctor called it. That's what it is. Look, nobody is gonna say... That's what it is! Okay. If you would like to talk about it then call it what it is. How could this happen in a month? I had some pain early in the pregnancy. Why didn't you tell me that? 'Cause I didn't want you to worry and they said it was nothing. This isn't nothing. Maybe it is. What does that mean? Well it means whatever happens, happens. That is really selfish you know that? Excuse me? Okay fine! You want me to be the bad guy?! Fine.We'll call it what you want. But if continuing this pregnancy means I lose you... then we end it. It's not an "it. Luke, this is our baby. All right? You... you saw its heartbeat. You saw its little tiny fingers and its toes. Stop it! Stop it! No. I'm not gonna stop it! I want you to think about it okay? Well then we'll try again okay? Okay? We can adopt okay? I mean, if your parents never would have adopted we never would have met. I know. I know honey. And I love you for that. But this little life inside of me... it's you and it's me. And I want him to have your goofy squint and I want her to have my chickeny legs. I don't need this kid to look like me. I don't care about that. I care... about this child growing up without a mother. Look what it did to you. You are really trying to guilt me into this. Hell yes I am. That is exactly what I'm gonna do if in the end it keeps you alive. You are such a dick. Well. Then fine I'm a dick. What are you doing? It was too soon. Stop it! Lucas Eugene Scott if you don't stop it right now I will beat your ass! You sound like a mom. I am a mom. A while back. I had a dream... that something happened to you. It got me to thinking about my life without you and I... I can't... No. I can't live that life. I can't. You talk about how I'm always saving you Peyton and I can't save you from this. We can't even think like that, okay? Will you just please look at all the stuff you and I have survived together? I mean, car crashes and bullet wounds and psychos. Are we really gonna let some doctor lay odds on us? And okay. Even if something does happen to me you're gonna be okay. And you can raise this baby on your own just like your mom did. And how am I supposed to feel about the child that took you away from me? God. I don't worry about that for a second because you are not that person. And you will never, ever, ever be on your own. You have Nathan and Haley and... Brooke. And just think about all that sexy Jake Jagielski single-dad tail you're gonna rake in. Not funny. I'm sorry. It's not funny. Because I would haunt your ass just to make sure you never had sex again. How can you joke about this? 'Cause I'm scared. Ttaught me to believe in fate. I mean, that's what "The comet" is all about, right? It's about accepting your fate. How can this be fate? Maybe it is. Maybe... maybe the whole point of you and me and every single moment that we've shared together has just been leading us here. Maybe you and I are meant to create this life because maybe this life is gonna change the world. I can't accept that our story doesn't have a good ending. Our story already has the greatest ending. No matter what. 'Cause we're together. I need to know we're making the right choice. I just... What? Okay c... c... come... come here. Sit down. Sit down. I'll call an ambulance. No. Wait. He's kicking hard. Do you feel that?! Yeah. It is okay for you to love this baby. It doesn't mean you don't love me. I can't live without you Peyton. Honey you don't have to, and you're not going to. I know it. I can feel it. We are gonna live happily ever after all three of us. Millicent wait. Wait for what Marvin? What else is there to say after goodbye? You're not wearing your glasses. I had Lasik. I see 20/20 now. Well. I guess it was a month of firsts. Okay. If you're done making fun of me. I have a long drive. Hang on. That was mean. I... I was angry. Maybe I still am a little. Trust me... there's nothing you can say that I haven't said to myself a thousand times. Well, maybe there's one thing. I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? For driving you away. It's my cellphone bill. It's $300. Text-messaging fees. Most of those were texts from Gigi and a lot of them were my replies. Why are you doing this? It's cruel. I'm not trying to be cruel Millie. I'm doing this because you're the one who deserves to be angry and you need to know that you didn't screw this up. I did. And I didn't even really realize how wrong it was until I saw it there in black and white. Why did you do it? I don't know. Maybe I... maybe I got some kind of rush out of it. I can't give you a reason that won't sound like an excuse. But if I'd never gone down that road then you never would have... you know. So before you walk out of my life... I need to know if you can forgive me. That's really noble Marvin but, you're a guy, you have needs. Gigi made you feel special in a way that I obviously couldn't. That is not true. You made me feel special every single day. But never at night. All those nights we slept beside each other, there were so many times I'd lie awake watching you sleep and I'd just want to rip your clothes off and attack you. Why didn't you? I was scared... that what we had was so special that sex would mess it up. That the promise of it could never live up to the real thing. But now I realize that our relationship wasn't that special. Don't say that. We were amazing together Millie. And... I know we can be amazing together again. The mistakes we made will always be there between us. But maybe if we start over... maybe the past won't be there in our next relationships. So the mistakes go away but we're with the wrong people. We can't just go back to being Mouth and Millie. I don't want to go back. I want to go forward... being this version of us. What do you mean? I mean, things were always so easy between us before but this is real life. Yes, we made mistakes. We screwed up. Maybe we can be that couple that finds our way through it to something better... something we both know is worth fighting for and protecting. I... I don't have all the answers. Millie. I just... I know that I miss you. What do you miss about me? I miss knowing that my day was gonna start with you, knowing that I was gonna come home to the one person who really got me. I miss the fact that around 2:30 every morning you snore for exactly seven minutes. I do not. And I miss... I miss the glasses. The glasses aren't coming back Marvin. I can't rewind the clock and take any of it back. I know that. But I didn't love you for your glasses. I love you for you. I love you too Marvin. But it's not just about you forgiving me. I have to forgive myself and I can't do that if I'm seeing you every day. I have to go. Or you could stay. I'm sorry. To seven years. Seven years. I can't believe you talked me into marrying you when I was 16. I know. What the hell was I thinking? That's like Jamie bringing home a wife in 10 years. Stop it. That is  so not gonna happen. We'd totally be hypocrites. That's true. Where is the boy anyway? Your mom's watching him for the night. And who's gonna watch him when we do a dime for breaking and entering? Don't be such a wuss. I've got everything figured out. Time for fortune cookies. Okay. Okay. "You are a master of your craft" in bed. Now, that is true. It does not say that. No but you can add "in bed" to the end of any fortune and it works. What? It works every time. Try it. Try it. Where do you come up with these things? "Prepare yourself for a big change," in bed. Well you know what they say about the seven-year itch. Fortune cookies suck. It got the "change" part right. I know the last couple weeks have been hard on you... taking care of Jamie, working full time. Yeah, that's kind of what I meant. Um... listen, uh... I haven't exactly been working full time. What? Why not? It's just like, uh, you know. I consider it a vacation... an unpaid one that may never end. Haley, what the hell happened? You know that paper I told you about that Sam wrote for school? Yeah. It was incredible and important and maybe a little pg-13. and Principal Rimkus told me I couldn't publish it in the school paper. So of course you did. Yeah. Are you mad? Yeah... at Principal Buttkiss. That's very original. Thank you. Anyway she suspended me, so... but it got me thinking you know, about where we're headed and just the bigger picture. And? Well, for instance...what do you think if Jamie and I come here? You want to move to Charleston? I know. It's totally crazy, right? But on the other hand you're gonna be spending a lot more time here than you will be in Tree Hill. Next you're gonna tell me that we already bought this house. No. But the realtor is a friend of a friend in case we wanted to check it out. You are just full of surprises tonight. I'm just getting started. This place is practically falling apart. It must be dirt-cheap. I think it's beautiful. It kind of reminds me of the old Granville house in "it's a wonderful life." You know... the one George and Mary used to throw rocks at and make wishes. See? Isn't this perfect? Jamie would love it. Chester would love it. I'm sure this place comes with things that could eat Chester. Come on. This could be my music studio! Oh, and... it happens to overlook the driveway with a basketball hoop. So whenever I need inspiration I can watch you play... shirtless. I mean, you just got this all figured out, don't you? Well, I'm just dreaming. Baby, Tree Hill's always gonna be our home. And I don't want to leave forever. But at the same time, we never said we'd stay forever. Okay. You want to dream. Let's dream big. You should get back to your music, but I'm not talking about writing songs in some creaky., old house. You should get back on the road. Yeah like that's ever gonna happen. I saw that look in your eyes after that U.S.O. show. You get the same rush from the crowd that I do. And one attention whore per family is enough, don't you think? We could make it work. Like we did last time? We are not the same couple we were then. We're much stronger now. We also have a child to think about. He has school. It's a good thing his mom is the world's greatest teacher, whose speciality is tutoring Scott boys. I don't know baby. A different city every night? Living out of a bus? What kind of a life would that be for him? It's the kind of life most kids dream of. I'll tell you what. Come here. Pretend like we're outside right now throwing rocks at this house. You tell me your wish wouldn't be to go back on tour. It would. I knew it. Nathan. We would have totally separate lives. What would that mean for us? Phone sex. I'm serious. This is our marriage. You can't take those kind of chances with marriage. You got to play defense, do you know who you're talking to? Have you seen my defensive stats? Look. There's only a couple of things that I'm certain of in life and one of them is that. No matter what happens you're gonna be the one wheeling me around when I'm 80. Besides. I just... I couldn't live with myself knowing that my dream kept you from pursuing yours. You're so amazing. I know. You got lucky. Think about it will you? Yeah. I'll think about it. Besides what do you want with an old house like this? There's too many rooms. You forgot how much fun we're gonna have filling them up with kids. Really? All these rooms? All of them. It's a big house. Apparently you missed the part about me wanting you gone. What are you still doing here? I didn't know you dated Ryan Reynolds. What are you talking about? Where did you get that? This website. It's called whosdatedwho.com. It lists everyone you've dated for the past five years. They can't do that! You're a public figure. The rules of common decency don't apply. But this is all wrong. I never dated him. I never even met him. Well yeah, I would have dated her, but no. Colin Farrell, nice. Remind me to get tested. Very funny. You can't believe everything you read on the internet. Yeah but even if you can believe half of it the sheer volume... wow. Okay. Playtime's over. Six hours of battery life sweetheart. Why are you doing this? Because I'm trying to figure out why you got so freaked out about what I said. By examining my ex list? So I dated a few guys in New York. So what? You weren't in love with any of them? I didn't have time for love okay? And even if I had Victoria would have never allowed it. So there it is. So then the last time you were in love... Now I get it. Yeah. It was a long time ago. Where are you going? If you have more than one copy of Lucas' book I'm out of here. Look I'm sorry if it's weird for you. You still love him? No. I don't. Yeah. That's what Peyton said. First of all. Peyton fed me that story long before she told it to you, so I've been there. And second, I love her, but I'm not Peyton. I'm sorry. It's just that I've already been in a relationship that had the stench of Lucas Scott hanging over it. And how do you think I feel? I'm the girl who's dating the guy who came to town in the first place to get Peyton back. Okay not exactly true, but... point taken. Yeah. It sucks always being the footnote in someone else's love story. But you're right you know. You're not Peyton. Lucas and Peyton's story is all about romance and destiny and fate. But you're different. Um... thanks? Brooke Davis writes her own story like you did with your career and your company and with Sam. You choose your own path. Yeah. But you can't choose who you love. You're right. You don't. But you choose whether or not you open your heart to love. What do you want me to say? How about "I love you too Julian"? How about. "I like you a lot"? This is all happening really fast. What happened to just having fun? And you know it's not as simple for me. I have Sam to think about. Don't do that. What? Don't hide behind Sam. I'm not hiding. Yes you are. And you want to know what I think? I think you do love me... or you could love me... but you're just too stubborn and scared to admit it because the last time you really gave your heart to someone it got broken. And I get that. I've been there. But somewhere along the line you gave up on the idea that you deserve to feel this way again. But you don't see what I see Brooke. You deserve this. So I'm gonna try one more time. I love you. I'm in love with you. I'm so lost and completely in love with you. I have been ever since I saw you doing that ridiculous molly ringwald dance. Julian... I... I care about you so much. Never let it be said that Brooke Davis is easy. Julian. I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. You know what? It's okay. Someday you'll let someone in. Today's just not that day. I don't want this to change anything. No it won't. It won't. You know you were right. It's my fault. We were just having fun and I just... you overwhelmed me a little bit. It's too soon. It is a little too soon. Yeah. I know. I'll tell you what... why don't you go get ready for dinner? We'll pretend the last hour never happened. Are you sure? I mean... can we really do that? Yeah. In fact in the movie business we do it all the time. It's called a deleted scene. Go pull yourself together Brooke Davis. You look a mess. I'll wait for you. Okay. Can I have some ice cream now? It's okay with me if it's okay with your... granny Deb. One scoop. Yes! He's a good kid. He's a great kid. Who unfortunately drank the Dan scott kool-aid. As soon as he's asleep you're gone. How about the comic stylings of the good Dr. Seuss? How about a story about daddy when he was little? You want a story about your dad? Okay. Let's see. There was this one time we all went down to disney world. That was when your dad was even younger than you are. And we were at the petting zoo and I wanted to take a picture of your dad petting this big brown goat, when this bratty kid walks up and whacks the goat with a big stick. That's when the goat hip-checks your dad 10 feet across the petting zoo. He didn't even know what hit him. Grandpa. Why'd you and nanny Deb stop being married? Well J-man... life's like a long race. And some couples were meant to go the whole distance and some were only meant to go halfway. Do you still love each other? Time for you to hit the hay. What about mommy and daddy? Will they ever stop being married? If there's one thing I know it's that your mom and dad are gonna make it all the way to the finish line. I love you buddy. I love you grandpa. Well the boy's out. I guess the same goes for me. I remember that trip to Disney World. The only ride Nathan would go on was the tram to the parking garage. So the two of you spent the whole day on it talking basketball. Yeah. That was a great day. We drove 600 miles to ride on a bus. Still a great day. Yeah. We were supposed to be  this couple tucking our grandkids in together. Nobody sets out to have a failed marriage Deb. It ends with a million little mistakes. And a couple  really big ones. Whenever I think the man I fell in love with is still inside there somewhere... I remember that you stood in that hallway looked your brother in the eye and pulled the trigger. I've done my time Deb. It'll never be enough. Keith won't get any time back. You want to talk about Keith? Let's talk about Keith. You're right. In a single moment of hatred... I made the greatest mistake of my life. But I did it because I thought I was getting revenge. Okay. It's time for you to go. No. No. No. Not yet. I thought I was getting revenge 'cause I thought Keith had poisoned that bottle of scotch and left me there to burn to death. But it wasn't Keith. Was it Deb? I... I... I don't want to hear this. It was you wasn't it?! You want to walk down memory lane tonight? I thought the reason Keith was trying to kill me was 'cause I hired Jules to sleep with him. And the reason I did that was 'cause in one of the worst moments of my life I walked in on my wife cheating on me with my own brother! From the way I see it... I pulled the trigger... but you loaded the gun. I've done my time Deb. Have you? You don't think I've thought about that every day for the past five years? How I left Karen without Keith, Lily without a father. And that's why I hate you. I hate you for killing Keith and I hate you for the guilt I feel! It's good that you're gonna die soon Dan. It makes me believe in justice. Now get the hell out. Grandpa? It's time for you to get better. This house is starting to grow on me. It's been a great anniversary. But you did all this for me. And I didn't give you anything. That is not exactly true. You've given me an amazing life so far. Who knows? Maybe someday when my body's completely wrecked and your singing days are over, we can come back here and... grow old together. What do you say? Yes!I say yes! Happy anniversary Haley James Scott. George Bailey. I'll love you till the day I die. Okay. I think I've gotten pretty presentable. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. I'll be right there. Who's that? It was the production office. Apparently one of the locations fell through. I got to go down and figure it out. Tonight? Do you want me to go with you? No. It'll probably take a while. Okay. Well... come over when you're done. We can still have dessert. I'll probably just crash at the hotel. But I'll see you tomorrow. You look beautiful Brooke. Someday. This scares me Peyton. It'll be okay. And what if it's not? It will be. We are gonna dance at this kid's wedding. And we're gonna spoil our grandkids together. I know it. I'm doing this. I'm having this baby. No.
