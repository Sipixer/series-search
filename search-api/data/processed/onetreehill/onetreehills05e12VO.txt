Where did you go,uncle lucas? We drove the back road to tree hill,and we saw all kinds of wonderful things. Well,where were you going? Everywhere. Anywhere. But where we ended up really wasn't the point. It was the things we saw and the people we met along the way. Who was with you? It was just my mom,my uncle,and me. Where was your daddy? He wasn't there. but something happened that day -- something magical. What was it? What happened? My uncle let me drive. were you scared? No,I mean,the truth is,I'm not sure I ever felt safer. That day,in that car with my uncle and my mom... was one of the best days of my life. Just like today. That's gonna make for one beautiful bride. I want to come home,haley. I love you. I have to get ready right now. I can'T. You shouldn't have done that. I wanted to. Yeah. So,you want to talk about this? Well,you hate my book and you think I picked the wrong girl to spend the rest of my life with. - What's there to talk about? - Stop it. You know that I love lindsey. Oh,but i don't? I mean,I think I do,but I guess I'm just lying to myself. Is that your story? Geez,see if I read anything you write ever again. Look,hales,you can't say that the manuscript I gave you is about peyton. It's about yearning and want,luke. I think you wrote it about peyton because you still love her. And I think it's about a guy watching the sky. But thanks for caring. Well,whatever you do,just don't show those pages to lindsey. I already did. - Mom! - And? - Lucas? - Mon Oh,my gosh! Oh,I missed you,baby boy! Oh,I missed you,too! Haley! - How are you? - Good. Oh,and who is this? It's me,aunt karen -- james lucas scott. No,you are not james lucas scott. Jamie scott is a baby. I got bigger. You got bigger! Oh,my goodness.Look at you. Where's lily? Yeah,ma. Where's my little sister? Your little sister is with andy. I think it's really great that you and my momare back together,andy. ******** I think it's really great that you're almostgonna get married. Well,I mean,till your fiancée meets me. I got to talk to my momabout getting rid of you. Listen,um... I love your mom... and lily,but I want youto know something. I'd give it all up if keith could be hereon your wedding day.

How much have you grownin the last week -- a foot? Maybe. Aunt karendidn't even know me. All right. Ooh,and,daddy,did you see mama? She looked pretty. I'll bet. You know the drill,right? You're gonna lead lindseydown the aisle with lily,and then when you getto me, you're gonna give methese two rings. Treasure! Nice,huh? And worth,like,all the moneyin the world. So when I give them to you,don't lose them,okay? 'Cause uncle lucas can't finish his secondbook,and he's poor. I'm sorry you're poor,uncle lucas. Thanks,jamie. Hey,daddy,when you married mama,was it your best day ever? Actually,I think the dayI graduated high school was my best day ever. How come? Well,'cause that's the dayyou were born. Now,lace 'em up. Chop-chop. Got any intel for mewith my girl? Not really. She misses you. She's still stubborn. Same as last week. But I'll tell you,it kind of sucks for youthat my mom's here. Why's that? Well,she raised a son with a really great uncleand no husband. Dan sucks. Flowers for the bride... who's clearly not here. Sorry. Both:I'll take 'em. Dude,you got to give methis one. If I take these flowersto lindsey,I get some face timewith haley. Forget it,man. Lindsey's been staying with haley to make itall romantic. I haven't seen her in a week. So? It's bad luck. Besides,what do you thinkis gonna go down before your weddingin a church? Oh,you underestimate me. Lucas,you're going to hell. Listen. You and lindseyare good,okay. You're still in thatblissed-out,best-underwear,she-still-laughsat-your-stupid-jokes phase. My jokes aren't stupid. That's what you think. Look,the point is,I need this,okay? I'm fading fast here. Haley: Oh,flowers from a gentleman. Hey,we can help you outwith that. Hey,look who it is. Sorry,bad luck. "Hey,look who it is"? No wonder you're fading. Lily. Oh,I sure did miss you. You think you can letyour big brother lucas in and come say hello? No! You're bad luck! How did i get so lucky? You know,if I knew beingengaged would be like this,I'd have proposedwhen we met. It's the book. The book? My book? I love it,lucas. I love what you wrote,and I love that you wrote it. It's so romantic. Okay,we can definitelytalk about this later. You know,can I ask you -- How do you mean "romantic"? What? Well,I'm glad you like itand all,but I didn't reallyexpect "romantic." I mean,it's about a scientistand the stars. Luke,are you kidding me? I cried so much. He's justthis lost little boy,and then he seesthe comet,and suddenly,his life has meaning. And then he waits his whole lifefor the comet to return. He has faith that it will,even though science and hisintellect tells him it won'T. His heart still believes. It's beautiful,lucas. And heartbreaking. It's an epic love story. It's about a comet. It's about lovein its purest form. When I think about how it camefrom your heart and your mind... it makes me so happy to knowthat I found you... and that I get to beyour wife. Thank you. I love you,lindsey. I love you,lucas. I'm sorry,we're closed! Oh,my god. Do you hate me? No,I am proud of you! I missed you! How's lily? Oh,she's good. She's very girly. But you'll see herat the wedding. God,unless I'm so latethat I miss it. I'm supposed to be there -- you're supposed to be there! I just wanted to come byand see the caf? and see youand maybe catch peyton. - She's on her way. - Good. How's she doing? She's a mess. She's trying to put ona brave face and be noble, - but we all thought this wasgonna be her day. - Yeah. And how are you? Are you happy? You are doing so well. Thank you. It's hard,but I'm -- I'm happy. At least I'm trying to be. Can I ask you something? I made lindsey'swedding gown,and it got me to thinking about how I was supposedto make yours. It's okay. It's not okay,and somehow you managedto make it okay. And I just wonder,I mean,I've always wonderedwhere that strength comes from. That dignity and gracethat you have put on in the face of everythingthat's happened in your life. Because I really want to bethat kind of person someday. You already are,brooke davis. You've come furtherthan anyone I know. And if you want to knowa secret,you've just scratchedthe surface. Thank you. Hey,brooke,come on. We're gonna be -- Thank you for my office! Oh,you are so welcome. I-I know we have to go,but there really is somethingI wanted to tell you -- both of you. You know,in life,if you let it,you can always come upwith reasons to give up. But if you don't,you might just find lovein places you never imagined -- in a new relationshipor in your work... or in your children. Whatever it is,just don't give up on it. And if you don't get it,well,you might getsomething better. That's what you haveto call me. I do not. Do so. Say it. "Aunt lily." You look like cinderella! I cannot believe we don't havedates for this thing. What kind of boyfriendtakes his guy roommate camping for the weekend? Jake gyllenhaal? ******* - Ah,what up,what up?Who want a beer? - I do. You're tailgatingat luke's wedding. Like you don't want one. I'm designated driver. So,what up,P. Sawyer? You got a plan? A plan for what? To steal lucas back. Oh,so I'm the only onethinking like that,huh? Okay,look. Here's the drill. When they say,"does anybody have any reason that this thing shouldn'tgo down?" Bam,that's you. They don't do thatat real weddings,skills. They should,though. You know,that's good drama. Anyway. How about this? I say we drug lindsey first --even though I love her. Then we throw youin the wedding gown,so when lucas lift upthe veil,bam,it's on. Um,skills? That gownis tailor-made,so,no. And peytonis gonna be okay. Right. You know I love you,P. Sawyer,right? But,baby girl,you are so far from okay,man,you ain't evenin the same area code. Wait. Maybe lucas will saythe wrong name on the altar just like ross didon "friends." Okay. How about this? How about peyton puts ona nice dress,watches lucas get married,gets wasted, and has drunk,meaningless sex with some guyat the reception? Yes. Hey,baby,I ever tell you howsexy you look in that dress? Maybe we should head in. Hey,uh,aren't youwatching jamie? You know what? You right. We got to get one for him,too. Let's do it! See y'all inside. I meant what I said. You're gonna be okay. No,I know. I know.I just -- I just needa minute,you know? Okay. I'll save you a seat. Can I help you? Hello,haley. Save it. You're not goinginto that church. And you're not gonna talkto my son,my husband,karen,or lucas,for that matter. You should be carefulabout being so bossy. I've been in prisona long time. Kind of sexy. Don't screw with me,dan. This is the last conversationyou and I will ever have. Enjoy your reprehensible,miserable life. Nathan:You ready for this? Yeah. I'm ready. All right,well,I'm not muchfor speeches,but,um... you're a good guy,luke. You're a good friend,and you're a great brother. Whatever life throws at you,I got your back,all right? Thanks. All right. That's us. What are you thinking,mrs. Scott? Big things. Big,important things. Like,"this isn't how I picturedmy wedding night"? No. Like,this is the night we'regonna tell our children about,and our children'schildren. I'd like to havekids someday. - A son with your eyes? - No. A little girljust like you. I am gonna love you forever,haley james scott. I promise. You're welcome to watchfrom here,but I'm sure you can find a seatdown below. No,I'm fine. My son's the ring bearer. - It's you. - What? When all my dreams come true,the one I want next to me. It's you. It's you,peyton. We give thanks today -- for lucas and lindsey,for their open heartsand their willing spirits, and for their closest friendsand family. May we all be changed by whatis said and witnessed here. I got you,P. Sawyer. Behave or I will spank you. ********* ******* It's a lot to process,I know. But now you knowwhy I came home. Brooke,are you sure? I mean... are you sure? I'm sure. My heart is sure. This is what I want. It's a mysteryhow we fall in love, who we fall in love with,why we fall in love. But we do.

But when you fixed my car,you fixed my heart. And when you proposed to metwo years ago,I just wasn't ready. And I was lost and scared,so I said "someday,"but someday's now,luke,it is. Someday is now,and I love you. Please don't leave me again. People always leave. Do you promise to be trueto her? Peyton: At least,that's what I should have said.
