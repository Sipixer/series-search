yeah. i'm just really happy for you. i got to go. hi. it's brooke. i know this probably seems out of the blue, but do you think you could meet me at my store? i thought you were gonna come meet me. i chickened out. you're just gonna have to join the mile-high club on your own. i just kind of did. i'm kidding, i'm kidding. so,um... when would you like to get married,peyton sawyer? oh,i love that question. um...i don't know. why don't we find a place we both like, and then we could pick a date? okay. well,until then,how do you feel about living in******** moving in with me? well,considering the last 48 hours, i'm pretty sure we already have been living in sin. yeah. i'd love to. i do want to spend one more night with brooke,though. she sounded sad on the phone, and i'm gonna miss her. you got it. my god. brooke? hi. honey,what -- what happened? were you robbed? yeah. last night. oh,my god. i'm not gonna cry. oh,it's okay. i'm not gonna cry. hey,baby. how was school? pretty good. come on. hey -- grandpa dan. come on. let's go. what's up,man?

let's see what you got, dr. j. yes! nothing but net. did you call the police? no, and i don't want to. brooke,you have to file a police report, or your insurance company won't accept the claim. i don't want to. i have plenty of money for this. well,do you know what's missing? the computer, cash from the register, and the sketches for my new line. oh,honey. i'm so sorry. but i really think we need to call the police. no. i don't want the press involved in this. so you can't tell anyone,okay? not haley and nathan or peyton or anyone. please. okay. thank you. come here. deb,you own a gun, right? i do. i want you to teach me how to use it. jamie was happy to see you at school today. haley didn't look very pleased,though. pretty soon, when jamie goes missing, she'll remember that grandpa dan kept coming around. as a matter of fact, she saw his car there practically every day. how does it feel to be the prime suspect,huh? what's on your mind, skills? oh,nothing. actually,when you first started dating haley, how hard was that for you to keep that from lucas? d. it was probably harder for haley 'cause they were friends, but i didn't like lucas. you didn't like uncle lucas? it was a long time ago, big ears. why? where's your head? just thinking about the rules of it all,you know -- how sometimes the heart just wants what it wants. so,what's going on, skills? you sneaking around with some hot girl and not telling us? yeah,what's going on, sk-i-ills? hey. my ears aren't that big. * is there anybody in there? * well,mr. fields,you've certainly come a long way. it almost seems as though you're starting to enjoy "les mis√©Rables." oh,come on,now. don't get crazy on me. you asked me to read the book, and i'm reading the book. i've also noticed how you are with jamie and nathan. i appreciate it. i'm telling you,man. jamie -- that kid right there -- he is gonna be the man. i'm serious. he already got some things going for him. well, i think he likes it thathe star of the basketball team makes him feel special. well,i got a little brother his age. yeah,he always watching me and copying me and whatever. i ju -- i don't know. i just try to keep it fun for him before he grows up and life gets harder. quentin,what do you want to do with your life? besides basketball. besides basketball... i don't know -- i guess,uh... get married, raise a family. yeah? you want kids? i mean, i think about it sometimes. when i look at my little brother or when i see j luke, i don't know. i think maybe i'll have a son of my own someday or,you know, a little girl. that'd be all right. yeah. well,like i said,you've certainly come a long way. a-plus,mr. fields. a-plus? a-plus. what? i got a -- nice. so,i guess this means i get to go ahead and stop reading this book? no. i -- not even -- i can't... okay,that's good. just a little lower now. okay. ahh. perfect. hi. hi,mama. what is this? i won't let you hop on the bed,)? so you're hopping on the pop? it's fun. you should try it. maybe i will. hey,um,where's deb? i have no idea -- again. hi. hey. um,i-i don't have very long. oh,okay. good. sorry. how was your day? i had to lie to jamie about us. then...something else happened. wait. come on. sit down. what's going on? well,i-i can't really talk about it, but,um... i have a friend who's going through some really emotional stuff. and she wants me to keep it a secret. okay. i'm just not sure i should. well,how'd you find out about it? she called me. well,without knowing the situation, i'd say that she called you for a reason. and if she ain't really tell nobody else about it, then that means that she respects you and probably thinks that you're the one person that just might understand what she going through. yeah. that makes a lot of sense. i mean,is there anything i can do? you just did it. hey. we just had our first real conversation. it was nice. yeah,it was kind of nice,huh? i mean,it wasn't better than that cheerleading outfit,but... it was nice. brooke, i'm home! brke: okay, don't freak out. why? oh, my god. brooke, what happened? lindsey came by and said, "peyton's a bitch." and i said, "peyton is not a bitch."</i> and she said, "yes, she is." and i said, "well, maybe you're the bitch, bitch."</i> and... but you should see her face. brooke... i was doing laundry, and i got all tangled up in one of the sheets, and i fell face-first down the stairs. oh, honey. i'm sorry i wasn't here. why didn't you call me? i did, but you said you were getting married.</i> is that why you sounded so bad on the phone? oh, i'm so sorry. no, it's okay. really, i'm too sore to hug. okay. but congratulations. thanks. it's kind of sudden, right? are you kidding? the rest of the world's been waiting on you two idiots since high school. he asked me to move in with him. really? do married people do that? i really am happy for you, p. sawyer. i might be a little happier if it was your bony ass that fell down the stairs,</i> but still... i'm gonna miss this. me too. * i smell a little monster sneaking up behind me * what's up, beastie boy? can you help me make a cape? sure. how come? well, quentin really likes mine, and i thought maybe we could make one for him, too. i think that's a very nice idea. i'd be happy to help you, sir. do you smell that? no. i-i smell a bigger monster. uncle lucas! you're gettingting heavy. did you know that daddy didn't like you once? what? when? when he was dating mama. i have big ears. good looking out. kid's got my back. so, speaking of sneaking around, uh, where have you been the last few days? with peyton, maybe? actually, we're engaged. get out! dude, i just shaved your head from your last engagement gone wrong! i know. i know it sounds crazy. but we just spent the last couple of days together, happier than either one of us can remember. and i know i have been all over the place. but my best friend told me, "pick a team." and you were right. you're happy? we both are. that's all that counts. besides, the only people that tear happy people down are those that are unhappy, so you go do your thing. i got your back. thanks. thank you. for what? for always helping me, for giving me a place to live and for the record label and...for being my best friend. you really are a good person, brooke davis. and what do i get out of it?</i> great friends... great life... good karma. i don't believe in karma. i try to be a good person, and bad stuff happens anyway. like what kind of bad stuff? like falling down the stairs? yeah, something like that. you missing angie? i don't really want to talk about it. okay. ll, let me ask you something. if you don't believe in karma... what do you believe in? justice. * I'm not sure i'll see you again * make sure we make it bigger, mama. q's a li-i-ttle bigger than me. a little? you think nanny deb wants help? oh, i think nanny deb's taking a nap right now. she sure has been tired a lot lately. yeah, she has, huh? where did i put my scissors? *i'm trying to change your dream* *and don't you see me?* *would you come back?* *would you take this chance?* hey. masked avenger, get up. what? i know what you've been up to. i was gonna tell you. deb, i will not have a junkie around my son. oh, wait. what? i found the pills. o...kay. come on, deb. nathan's pain medication for his back. this bottle was full a week ago, and now you're out all night and you're always tired. you think i took those pills? well, unless you've been fighting crime in that thing, where the hell have you been? i've been having sex. well, i have. and i haven't taken a single one of those pills. i believe your husband's back</i> has been bothering him lately. we know what you've been up to, nathan. and don't try and blame it on deb, because she has been having sex. ugh. have you been taking these pills? and don't say... yes. yes. yes? yeah. those are my pain pills for my back, and my back's been in pain. this bottle was full a week ago. i know. i've been taking two a day, which is what the prescription says. but -- you know, contrary to popular belief, some people can take pills without turning into a junkie.</i> i'm going back to bed. look, if it makes you feel any better, i could probably play through the pain, but those pills really seem to help. i just want you to be careful. i will. are you okay? yeah. yeah. sorry. can we at least just go see the doctor and talk to him about everything now that you're playing again? sure. we'll go tomorrow. okay. you know what the worst part about being a fugitive is? being a fugitive. all that sneaking around, constantly being pursued. see, that's where you come in.</i> grandpa dan, just out of prison, hanging around the schoolyard, and then jamie's missing and grandpa dan's missing. i'm sure the manhunt will be extensive, but they'll be looking for you in a black s.u.v., not in a shallow grave out by the swing set. you know what i love most? the fact that no one checks up on you because no one likes you. yeah, they'll all miss jamie, but no one's gonna miss you.</i> all i have to do is burn your i.d. and that pager. and, by the way, a beeper -- what are you, a drug dealer on "miami vice"? you did get one page, though --</i> right after i hit you with that car. so i guess your table's ready at the cheesecake factory.)y it's alive! well done. what does it want to say? your plan sucks. you know, that pain you're experiencing is your body telling you to slow down. you can't handle the pace you kept before your accident. which is not to say you can't have a basketball career again, if you're smart about it. what does that mean, exactly? can you tell us the risks to him if he plays again? well, it's the "exactly" part that's a little tricky, haley. nathan's back is held together with medical ingenuity and a few miracles. the miracle part isn't exactly scientific.</i> but it's possible that i could play for 10 years and be fine, right? oh, yeah, it's possible. but here's the worst-case scenario. you cause your spine enough trauma to end up back in that wheelchair -- possibly for life. * how many times... * how come peyton's moving out? because she's moving in with me.</i> we're getting married. what happened to lindsey? it's a long story, kid. were you ever in love with mama? what do you mean? like love love?</i> no, we were always, uh, just friends. why? just wondered. were you ever in love with aunt brooke? long story. here. make yourself useful, knucklehead. when you get married, do i have to be the ring bearer again? not if you don't want to. good. 'cause last time, it didn't work out so well. * left al your plan sucks. really? the guy can finally speak, and he's a frickin' talking parrot. don't make me get the ball gag. now you're just turning me on. okay. i'll play your little game, parrot. why does my plan suck? the pager. there's a number on the back of it. call it. is this a trick? call it and find out. my plan doesn't suck. they're getting married, huh? yeah. the doctor scared you, didn't he? right about the time he said "paralysis." * frame ghost, left perfume on pillow * * room without a halo * i was watching you practice with the team yesterday. you looked so happy -- somebody that was doing exactly what they were born to do. you still love it, don't you? yeah. i do. and the truth is, i could probably slow down and try to play a little differently. no, you can't. that's not who you are. you can't do that. can i tell you a secret, though? that's what i love about you. i remember the first time i saw you play when i was tutoring you. you were like a rock star out there. masonboro. you sat with keith, and you wore that goofy hat. whatever. i scored 35 points that night, and each basket was like my own personal version of a haley james pickup line. it worked. i played that game for you, haley, and you know what? i'd give it up for you, too. 'cause as much as i love playing the game and the person that i am when i play it, i love being a husband and a father more. *i don't fear anything in this place we're in* this is the last of it. no brooke? no. she was gone when i woke up this morning, and she's not picking up her cell or at the store. that sucks. i really wanted to see her. a little help here. whoa. i got you. hey, peyton. it's a beginning, not an end. * all that i am made of * * and all that i have * * when you are near me * * when you are here * * i see that all that i am * * you're all that i am * stop smiling! call the number. aagh! "call the number, call the number"! you want me to call the number? i'll call the damn number! pay as you go. no caller i.d. my "plan sucks," says the cripple in the restraints. emergency medical response team. may i have your name and the number on your pager, please? i-i'm sorry. i think i've dialed the wrong number. who is this? emergency medical response team. and unless you're on the waiting list for a heart transplant, you've called the wrong number. i'm sorry. shut up. i said, "shut up!" brooke? it's deb, honey. brooke? hi. i was in the neighborhood. thought you might want to have a little girls' night. no, thank you. brooke... i lived a lot of years feeling powerless and alone. i was pissed off and medicated and scared to death. that's not going to happen to you -- not if i can help it. now, get dressed. what does that mean -- emergency response team? huh?! speak! it means... i have less than six months to live. and even if i kidnap my own grandson, then i'm only a suspect for a few months. then i'm dead. and where is he?</i> which means your plan sucks. stop saying that! you hear me?! stop saying that, and keep your mouth shut, or i promise you i will kill you right now! without that heart... i'm already dead. go! hi. this is brooke. and this is peyton.</i> leave us -- call us --</i> you said i was supposed to go next.</i> no, i did not. yes, you did!</i> leave a message. bye. i told you i was gonna go next.</i> * the only way that we knew was wrong * * got me hanging on and on * * it's everything you want * * and everything you need * game. damn. one more, man. let's go. that's it. i'm done today, man. what? that's soft, man. you ain't never getting to the association like that. all right, we'll see about that. so, you're leaving? just like that? what the hell are you thinking about, nate? i'm thinking i got a really hot wife and an awesome son waiting for me at home. hey, nate. i'm happy to be a part of it, man. what's that? the comeback. don't call it a comeback, man. oh, it's a comeback, baby. it's a beautiful thing to watch, bro. tomorrow morning -- rivercourt. and, q... thank you. * reminds me of who you are * * it's everything you want * it's so awesome, mama. quentin's gonna love it. dude. don't you have the apartment all to yourself now? where's the party? yeah, well, you got a whole house all to yourself. not anymore. peyton's moving in. we're getting married. well, well. you want another drink, or should i just wait till you propose to brooke? nice. how about i bu you a drink, huh?</i> okay. i mean, unless it's a bad time. nah. i was just gonna talk to q about something. but i'll see him tomorrow. all right. let's go. let's roll. hey. can i get 20 on pump number 1, please? have a nice night. hello? oh, my god. lucas, what is it? ??? he's dead.
