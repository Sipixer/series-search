He found a picture of you once. What'd you tell him? I told him you were dead. It's mia. She's the magic, Peyton, and I'm telling you, her spark is getting squashed by this ass of a singer. Oh, this is for you. It's supposed to bring good luck. I know we just met, but I just wanted you to know that I'm here. Good to know. Any student who walks out that door fails this quarter.

Prison. Did you tell jamie my dad's in prison? - Maybe. - Why? Because he's in prison. Why, what'd you tell him? We told him he was dead. Man, how am I supposed to know that? I mean, he be asking me stuff. Well, you have to lie to him, man. He's having nightmares now. Look, you know, he be tricking me. He get all, like, cute. Yeah, I know. He does have that going for him. Well, all right, you said he asked you stuff. What else did you tell him? Not much. Just the truth. Like? Like "the man" killed tupac and biggie, never date girls named bevin, and santa claus is black. You say anything about the easter bunny? A bunny that lay eggs? You know how many questions he would ask me about that? All right, just stay clear of the whole dan thing until we figure out how we're gonna handle this, okay? Fine by me. I won't say a word. can I help you? Is that your room? It used to be mine. Want to see it? You sure? I mean, I could be a psycho. You don't know.It happens. You're not a psycho. You're Peyton. Come on. It's different. - molly. - Molly.Yeah.God! You know, when I lived here, the walls were red. A red bedroom? That's crazy. Oh, no. It was everything I wanted it to be. But I mean, this is nice, too. - Thanks. - Yeah. So, you really loved him, huh? Lucas? What, are you some kind of psychic? Was it really true love always? One would think that since they charge by the hour for this little venture, you might be more punctual. Um, you're brooke's mom, right? Victoria. Also known as the money behind this, whatever this is. And you're the producer? Yeah, I'm Haley. I'm sorry. It's nice to meet you. I'm a good friend of brooke'S. Ah, brooke has so many good friends since her success. Having said that... I'd like to have a listen to our investment. Okay, I'll just give Peyton a call. No, I really don't have time for that. And god knows what gutter Peyton sawyer is lying in. So, if you don't mind... you know what? I'm gonna wait in there. Yeah, that's fine. Um, that person creeps me out. Listen, you're gonna do great. You're fine. We just want you to play her a few bars of "no good, " and we'll make her happy, okay? Right, like that old thing could ever be happy. So, obviously this is the acoustic version, but Mia really is great, and I think you're just gonna love her. So, if you want to come into the booth with me... I'm comfortable here. - Thank you. - Okay. Okay, Mia! Whenever you're ready! The song is called "no good." She's really nervous. Can you blame her? It's like she's playing a private concert for satan's wife. okay. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you. No, no, no, no, no! The song's called "no good"? Appropriate. Okay, so, this is a huge waste of money. I would say it was a waste of time, but you all failed so quickly, it really wasn'T. So when you locate Peyton in that gutter, you let her know I'd like to speak with her before this catastrophe goes any further. Okay, so, tell me again, what happened? She walked in... we walked in and bitch-toria was there waiting. Next thing I know, she scares Mia half to death, then Mia's gone. - Gone where? - I don't know. She just packed up her stuff, said she sucked a bunch of times, and then took off. Can you blame her? She must have been humiliated. That was ugly. Can you just give us a few minutes? What is Lindsey doing here? She came with me. We're gonna have lunch. I don't want her here. You know how temperamental artists are, Haley. So, apparently, are label owners. I don't want anyone in the studio. Anyone or Lindsey? Anyone including Lindsey. Look, I know everyone loves her. That's great.Fine. But right now Mia's gone, and she's in here running her mouth about how ugly everything is. She didn't mean anything by it, Peyton. Don't get mad at Lindsey just because Mia's gone. I'm not mad at her. - You sound mad at her. - I'm not. I -- maybe I just don't like her. Well, you don't have to... I'm gonna go, Haley. Yeah, I'll see you. Hey, Mouth. You guys scared me. What's -- what's going on? - We're hiding from Alice. - Why? Have you met Alice? Carlton. E wocausrking on the weekends sucks, and we've all had it. That's why... you got to talk to her. Me? Why me? You're the only one that's ever stood up to her, Mouth. Listen, guys, I don't know. Look, Mouth, either you talk to her, or we go with plan "B." What's plan "b"? We pool all our money together, we hire a hit man, and take her out. I say plan "B." Come on, guys. She's not that bad. Come on, Mouth. Admit it. You hate her, too. And do you know why? Because Alice is a bitch. Peyton is a bitch! Your mom's a bitch. What happened? She went to the recording studio and freaked out Mia, who is M.I.A. Imagine that. And now I don't have an artist. I'm sorry, Peyton. I'll talk to her. Well, it's either that or my fist talks to her face, and that's gonna be a longer conversation. I will. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm gonna see you at home. I got to find Mia. My mother. - Oh, no. - What? - It's him! - Who? The hot guy I met at the opening! Hey, honey. - Step aside.Hot guy coming through. - What? So, listen, I need to buy a gift for my boss's birthday. Something nice. Just please don't spend my entire paycheck. I will come up with something. Okay, cool. I'll come back by later. Got to quell a mutiny at work. Bye. Bye! Excuse me? He's cute, huh? But he was buying a gift for someone. Oh, please, like Mouth's dating his boss. You, um... you like the crew, right? Crew? Yeah, you know, the guys at work. If by "like" you mean "loathe." I think you'd really like them if you got to know them. And I know they'd like you. Right. Like that's what I'm gonna do -- go have beers with harry. It's jerry. Exactly. See you at the office. I'm coming in, daddy! You need your water wings, fish face. All right. Got it? Okay. Style points for a big splash. Let's see what you got, jimmy-jam. Perfect 10. Perfect 10, buddy. - Come on, nanny carrie! - Hold on. Perfect 10, huh, dad? Throw me, daddy. Jamie, your dad has to do his rehab. That's okay. Come here, you little monkey.You ready? You splashed me! - So? - So? Not so fun now, huh? Splashing a little kid, huh? You got a problem with that? Let's see what you got. - Get her, daddy! - Yeah, get me, daddy. ********** Mama! Mama! Mama! Jamie! Honey, I'm here! It's okay. Mama's here. No! I want my other mama! Nathan, did you hear what jamiejust said to -- ****** Good morning! Not really. Can I fix yousome breakfast? Uh, no, thanks. I'm thinking I might dropa few pounds. Oh, come on. You look great. Yeah. Where's Jamie? With skills. And Nathan'sat physical therapy. So you'll just have to deal with all this nicepeace and quiet. Thought I might gofor a quick swim. Um, carrie... I don't want to sound weirdabout this, but, um... could you not wear a bikiniin the pool? Oh, my gosh. Of course. I'm so sorry. It just seemskind of inappropriate, you know, around Jamie. You know, you're absolutely right. It was poor judgmenton my part. That's okay. And, you know, everything else is great. You're really doinga wonderful job. Thanks, Haley. I appreciate that. And I am so sorry. It won't happen again. It won't happen again. I'm serious, mother. Peyton was really upset. And anyway, this is my money. So just stop. I don't understandwhy you act like this. "Why?" Well, let's see. I'm staying in a motel. We have modelsthat are a size four that should be a size zero. My daughter is hell-benton destroying her company. First of all, I'm not destroying anything. And second, zero is not a size! Our models are... tall! Tall and fat! Well, maybe you should go backto new york... I mean, if you're this unhappy here. You have my word, all right? I won't meddle in Peyton'sso-called record label. Thank you. What I will not do, however, is hold my tongue when I thinkyou're making a mistake. Now eat your breakfast. Oh, I don't knowif I should. I am a size four, after all. But you're not a model. You're my daughter. You're far too talentedto waste your life as a model. So eat. Nice work, kid. You're halfway to sleepingin a van and checking in to rehab. Daddy's in rehab. Different kind of rehab. What other kind is there? Um, you want to goto the river court? Did you knowmy grandpa dan? Yeah, I think we'll goto the river court. Uncle skills, how comethey sent my grandpa away? It's clean. I promise. Nathan: You told Jamie my dadwent to prison because he didn't cleanhis room? Look, man, I was stuck. I mean, he come up to you with thosebaby-seal eyes like... I mean, he just gets youall confused, man. Well, you're supposedto play dumb, not scare the hellout of him. Look, I panicked, all right? Anyway, man, I don't like lying to him. Nate, you got to talk to him. We need to talk. Did you tell Lindseythat you don't like her? Kind of. What the hell, Peyton? She's been nice to you. Okay, in caseyou haven't noticed, I have a few other problemsto deal with right now. Do you see this office, this big, empty office for a labelwith no artists? You mean the label Lindsey recommendedI help you with. Okay, I can't do thisright now. You have to apologizeto her. Luke, Mia is missing, okay? Brooke's mom is killing me. I quit my job, I moved back home, and I can't do thisright now. - Can I help you? - No. No, you cannot help me. That is the last thingthat I want. Go home to your girlfriend, luke, please. Okay. What's so important coach got to see me onthe weekend for, man? Well, well. Mrs. James-scott. Have a seat, Q. All right. So, mrs. Scott here says that you recently left her class despite the threats of receiving a failing gradefor the quarter. Yeah, that was justa little misunderstanding. But it's all good now, right, mrs. J-s? Uh, no, quentin, I warned you about that, and I'm gonna stand by it. But I do know how importantbasketball is to you, so I figured out a way for youe to makup your grade. This book is called"les misérables." Do you know it? Good. I'm glad. Now you can read itover the course of the year, turn in biweekly book reportsfor extra credit, and as long as you meetyour deadlines, you'll remain eligibleto play. And if I don't? I'm not gonna givepreferential treatment to any studentin my class. What do you say, Q. Do we have a deal? I'll think about it. That's a great move. Shame no one's gonna see itthis year unless you read the book. Gosh, man! What is this, bad cop/dumb cop? I said I'd think about it. What's it to you, anyway? Well, it matters to Haley, so it matters to me. She tends not to give upon people as easily as I do. Or maybe wifey'sjust a little afraid I'm about to break her man'sscoring record, huh? So she assigned mesome crap book 'cause she knowI won't do it. Here's the problemwith that theory -- you're not good enoughto beat my record. Right, you don't think so? No. Okay. There's one thingthat every great player has, and that's the willto do whatever it takes to be the best. I don't see thatin you, Q. And at this point, you don't even have a team, so, um, maybe you should thinkabout that. And what team you got, washout, huh? You so great, right? Where your team at? I have a team. Every day, I wake upand I put on the uniform -- mistakes, regret, what could have been. And if I could go backand change all that just by reading a book, trust me, I'd read the book. And if not... well, lcome to the team, Q. Yeah, that's good. And I could do a whole lineof t-shirts with slogans like, "zero's not a size"... and "my mom hatesall my friends." Hey, she's not horribleall the time. You haven't been aroundfor the last couple years. She cares about me. Brooke penelope davis! I'll be in the back. Did you schedule a conferencecall with macy's? - Yeah, 'cause I was thinking - - well, don't! In case you have to hear it, you have zero business sense! Mom. Let me finish. For the last three years, I've been calling the shots, and look how this companyhas grown. You're a talented designer, brooke, but you don't spin the strawinto gold. I do. Truth be told, you are not smart enoughto do it. Ice queen! Stop being such a bitchto your daughter! And did my daughter pay youto say that? No, I came up with that onefor free. Well, I advise you keep yourlittle underachieving mouth shut because my relationshipwith my daughter is none of your business. No, it is when you tear her downand call her stupid. See, the truth is, you're actually worriedshe's smart. And that's a threat to you because when she figures outhow to do the business side of this company, goodbye, victoria. You're one to talk. Once I convince brookethat you're just another leech sucking off the money teat, you will be broke and worthless. I meant what I said. Stop tearing down your daughter. She might have to biteher tongue with you because you're her mother, but you are not mine. No, I am not. As a matter of fact, it's quite clearyou never had a mother. Yeah? Oh, my gosh.Lucas, I didn't -- it's okay. Lindsey... will you marry me? Say no. It's what I didwhen he asked me. Did you fall asleep? Yeah, I guess. Well, you better get ready. We're having dinner with Nathanand Haley, remember? Oh, yeah. All right. Did you talk to her? I-I tried. Well, I mean, yeah, I think she knows my position. So... we all heard. You're in linefor the on-air reporter job. It's because you stood upto her. That's why. She must respect that. I don't know. I... what's with the powwow? Want to get back to work? You get back to work. You hag. Whoever you are, you're fired. Security! Where the hell is my cane? Haley! Hey, have you seen my -- oh, um, where's --where's Haley? I think she ran out for somelast-minute dinner stuff. I told her I'd do it, but she wanted to. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. So, are we not supposedto wear pants tonight? Funny. I think I overdidmy rehab, and so I'm havinga little trouble. This might not be the mostappropriate job for you. Stop it. Nannies are like doctors. You let your doctor see youlike this, don't you? That depends on wherehe takes me to dinner. You know, Haley asked me notto wear a bikini in the pool. She said it was inappropriatearound Jamie. - There you go.You good? - Yeah. Listen, carrie, I'm sure that Haley didn't meananything by it. I mean, I know she likes you. Yeah. It's just kind of ironic, you know? I mean, if she's worried about someone getting turned onout at the pool, she probably shouldn't let yougo shirtless. So, what's going onwith your writing, luke? How's it coming? Good, actually. I'm kind of on a roll lately. You got to to beloving that, linds. Yeah, the editor sideof me is. The girlfriend sidemisses her boyfriend. So, how'sphysical therapy, nate? Pretty good, man. I'm sore a lot these days. I spend a lot of timein the pool. Yeah, he's been lookingreally good in there. - His rehab's going great. - Yeah. Where's your head, hales? Um, quentin. I gave him a second chanceto kind of turn things around, and I'm not sureif he's gonna take it. He willif he wants to play. Lindsey: Well, sometimes youjust don't know about people. I mean, I gave Peytona second chance, and she didn't take it. I have to tell you, I felt so horrible about that, and I know Peyton did, too. Victoria has literallybeen driving Peyton crazy. Thanks, but there's more to itthan that. Peyton feels like she hassome sort of jurisdiction over lucasbecause of their history. I was really hoping it wouldn'tbe an issue, but clearly it is. Lindsey... Peyton's got a big heart. Yeah, to go alongwith her big mouth. I know I wentto an ivy league school, but if she keeps it up, she's gonna get her ass kicked. Okay! Easy. Sorry. I didn't mean that. I know she's a friendof yours. I just wanted her to like me. Yeah, it sounds like it. What's so funny? Uh, I'll tell youwhat's not funny -- the factthat you're down here instead of upstairs sleepinglike you're supposed to be. I'm not tired. - I'll get him. - No, I got it. Jamie, bed, now. Daddy, can you take me? Jamie, you're gonna listento your mother, okay? Now, go on upstairs. We'll be up in a coupleseconds to tuck you in. He is so cute. He uses it. Trust me. And now he's scared to deathto go to bed because of dan. But can you blame him? Hell, I had nightmares about dantill I was, what, 19? - Think we should go talkto him? - Yeah. Excuse us. Hey, and you are not allowedto clean at all, okay? You just make lucas do it. All right. All right. Cheers, ladies. So, carrie, how's everything going? Really good. By the way, I completely agreewith what you said about Peyton. Just because someone has historywith a person doesn't mean that's whothey should be with. Buddy, I've been lookingfor that. It keeps me safefrom grandpa. Haley: Um, baby, listen, we, uh... we try to protect youfrom things because we love you, and that's why we didn't tellyou the truth about grandpa dan. The truth is, um... he did some bad things, and he needed to go away. Is he ever gonna come back? Maybe. Someday. But no matter what, you're always gonna be safewith us. Mommy and daddy are never gonna let anythinghappen to you, okay? Okay. But just in case, can you maybe checkin the closet and under the bed? Yeah, I think so. It's pretty nice, P. Sawyer. Fully stocked barsteps from your office, complete with a hot bartender, might I add? Sorry to bother you. Can I get an autograph? Yeah. - It's amy. - Okay. Well, okay! So, aside from noticinghot bartenders, how has yourlove life been? No comment. She sleeps around a lot, but there's no one special. You can be fired. You know that. Um, yeah, but then she'd justcome work for me, and you'd still bepaying her. Okay. I'm not calling myselffamous or anything, but the celebrity makes ita little hard to meet somebodyyou can trust. Oh, I'll get it! All right. Everything all right, guys? Oh, poor thing. We all have stuffwe're afraid of. You know I'm deathly afraidof clowns? No, I swear to god. It's really sad. Hey, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to sayI've been thinking about it, and, uh, I'll do whateverit takes to remain eligible. I'm really gladto hear that. All right, 6:00 A.M. Practice, Q. Yes, sir. I guess I'll leave y'allto it. I got a bookI got to start reading. Nathan:I'll see you out. Way to go, coach. All right. You madethe right decision. I'm comingfor that scoring title, and when I'm done, I'm gonna erase you. Yeah, that's whatI would have said. Oh, that looks good! Thank you. Brooke:You're welcome. - So, you guys ready to go? - Yeah. Hot bartender guycoming this way. I told youhe couldn't resist. Brooke davis? Could you maybe sign thisfor me? Who should imake it out to? You can make it out to trickfor $37. It's your bar tab. I thought you were askingfor my autograph. Not really an autographkind of guy, especially when I have no ideawho the person is. Brooke davis. I have a line calledclothes over bro's -- clothing. More ofa t-shirt-and-jeans guy. Maybe if your namewas levi strauss. Uh, my name is Peyton. I actually have an officeright in there. This is millicent. And you know... - brooke, right? - Yeah. - She makes clothes apparently. - Yes. Well, I'm owen. Let me know if you want my autograph. Nice work, B. Davis. Shut up. Let's go. You know what? I'm gonna meet you at home. So hot! I'm sorry I disappeared. I just needed timeto think about everything, and, honestly, I don't think I'm the one todo all this with -- start your label with. Why, 'cause you're scared? Because I don't thinkI'm ready, and I know how importantit is to you. Okay, Mia. Why do you write songs? What do you mean? When you think about yourcareer, what do you want? What's gonna be enough? I don't know. All right, maybe you're right. Maybe you're not ready. I want to help someone. I want to reach that girlor that boy who wakes up one day and feelslike it's not worth it anymore. Why, 'cause you've beenthat person? Maybe. It's like... I don't needto be famous, and I don't need all the moneyin the world. It's not about that. It's about that girlwho's having a horrible day, and she hears your song, and for five minutes, there's hope, you know? It's like, for five minutes, the world's not such a scaryplace for her anymore. You askedwhat's gonna be enough -- that'll be enough. That'll be more than enough. Okay. I take it back. Maybe you are ready. you're working late. Someone has to, right? mom, I know this has all beenreally hard on you, but I just need youto trust me, okay? And no matter what happens, I just wantedto tell you that... I love you... and thatI appreciate you. And... maybe I don't saythat enough. Of course I trust you, honey. More than that, I love you. And I'm so proud of you. I wouldn't miss thisfor the world. Come here. you're working late. Someone has to, right? Mom, I know this has all beenreally hard on you, but I just need youto trust me, okay? And no matter what happens, I just wantedto tell you that... I love you, and thatI appreciate you. And... maybe I don't saythat enough. Whatever. You can lock up. Lucas:I saw your light on. Which isn't that surprising. I know how hard you work. You know... you haven't been yourselflately, Peyton. I mean, not the Peyton I remember. Well, I haven't been that Peytonfor three years. What's going on? Okay. I went by my old house. There's a teenage girlliving there now. And she showed memy closet door. And you knowwhat that said? "Lucas and Peyton. True love always." "Always, " lucas -- that's what we were supposed to have until you showed up in L.A.Three years ago and ambushed me. If by ambushedyou mean proposed to you? Oh, yeah. Out of the blue. A proposal that was drivenby some insecurity that I have never been ableto understand. Insecurity? Right. Let me tell you how you get"always, " Peyton. When a man asks youto marry him, you say yes. You don't say noand call him insecure. I never said no! I said that I loved you and that i did wantto marry you someday. And -- oh, god, luke! I wanted to so bad... but you gave up on us. - I gave up on us? - Yes! By proposing, i gave up on us? No, by not waiting, you gave up on us, and you knowthat's the truth. That's great, Peyton! You want to talk truth, let's tell the truth. Okay. You gave up on me. That's why you didn'tsay yes! You didn't thinkI could do it. You didn't think I could getmy novel published. Maybe you just didn't care, because it wasn't about youor what you wanted. Well, if that's the truth, if I never cared, then how come every timeI see this stupid book, I buy it --every stupid damn time, luke? You said I was great! You said I could be great! You said we were destinedto be together! You said it to the world, you said it to me, and I wish you never had because you did not meanany of it! Oh, god. I'm gonna go. Okay, you know what? I want to pay rent. I don't know how, but I'llfigure it out.I just -- whatever this is, I don't feel right about it. It's called me being niceto you. - Well, it needs to stop. - Maybe you're right. Tough day. Sucks about carlton, huh? Well, you're lucky. Guess Alicekind of likes you. God help youif that ever goes south. Night, buddy. I'm gonna head home. By "home, "I hope you mean my place.
