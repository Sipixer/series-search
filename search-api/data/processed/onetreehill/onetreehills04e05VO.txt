I'M THRILLED FOR YOU AND HALEY. BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU LOVED HALEY? A YEAR? YOU'VE LOVED THE GAME MOST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU'VE WORKED HARD, AND DUKE RECOGNIZES THAT. IT'S A HELL OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT, SON. HALEY'S DREAM IS TO GO TO STANFORD. INTERESTING. I THOUGHT HER DRE WAS TO GO ON TOUR. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ALREADY LET HER DO THAT, DIDN'T YOU? DAD -- I LIKE HALEY. I WAS WRONG ABOUT HER, OKAY? BUT IF SHE INSISTS ON GOING TO STANFORD, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO LET HER GO -- ALONE. SHE'S PREGNANT. I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT IF SHE LOVES YOU -- I MEAN TRULY LOVES YOU -- THAN HALEY WILL PUT HER SECOND DREAM BEHIND YOUR FIRST AND FOLLOW YOU TO DUKE. HEY, I PLAYED BALL AND HAD YOU. YOU CAN DO IT, TOO. THE DAY I SIGNED MY NATIONAL LETTER OF INTENT WAS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE. THIS COULD BE THAT DAY FOR YOU. BUT IF HALEY TAKES THAT AWAY, AFTER YOU LET HER GO ON TOUR, THEN SHE'S NOT THE PERSON EITHER YOU AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS. THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW, DON'T YOU, SON? I WASN'T A MONSTER BACK THEN. I WAS JUST A KID CHASING HIS DREAM HIS WHOLE LIFE AND FINALLY EARNED IT, JUST LIKE YOU. HOW COME EVERY TIME YOU COME AROUND... OKAY, I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE ODD COMING FROM ME, BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY? IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY. BESIDES, YOU'VE BEEN SO UNHAPPY LATELY, I THOUGHT PPY HOUR WAS THE WAY TO GO. CHEERS. SO, HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE, ANYWAY? IT'S WHERE I MET COOPER. OH. I'M SORRY, RACHEL. NO, IT'S OKAY. I MEAN, ACTUALLY, WE MET ONLINE FIRST. I POSTED SOME PICTURES, AND COOPER REPLIED. A LITTLE LIE ABOUT MY AGE, SOME GREAT SEX, A STOLEN LIMO, A BRIDGE, AND A BRIEF HOSPITAL STAY LATER, AND HERE WE ARE. I COULDN'T DO IT -- THE WHOLE LIE-ABOUT-MY-AGE- ON-THE-INTERNET THING. NOT TO MEET A GUY. I MEAN... YOU ALREADY DID. WHAT? NO, NO, RACHEL, JUST BECAUSE I AM SINGLE DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN PIMP ME OUT ONLINE. IS A GUY COMING HERE? NO. HE'S ALREADY HERE. WHAT DID YOU -- HE'S A PART-TIME MODEL. YOU ARE A 23-YEAR-OLD FASHION DESIGNER... NAMED PEYTON. VERY FUNNY. HI. HI, I'M...PEYTON. I KNOW. I'M NICK. WELL, I'LL BE GOING. HAVE FUN. USE CONDOMS. BYE. SHE'S -- [ CHUCKLES ] NICK, AS IN SAINT NICK? NOT REALLY. [ CHUCKLES ] NATHAN? HI. I'M HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE... TO ANNOUNCE THAT I'M GOING TO DUKE. I THOUGHT WE AGREED WE'D MAKE THAT DECISION TOGETHER. WELL, PLANS CHANGE, DON'T THEY? [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S BEEN CONGRATULATING ME ABOUT THE BABY AND TELLING ME HOW WONDERFUL IT IS, EXCEPT YOU. A PART OF ME THINKS IT IS WONDERFUL. PART OF YOU? HALEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT, UM... WHATEVER IT IS, WE'RE GONNA FACE IT TOGETHER AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. HALEY, I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO YOU. THIS WHOLE THING SCARES ME TO DEATH. [ SIGHS ] LOOK... DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME? TO DUKE? TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE. NO, I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW. MY DAD SAID YOU WOULD SAY THAT. [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW WHAT, NATHAN? IT IS REALLY NOT ABOUT WHAT SCHOOLS WE GO TO OR WHAT DREAMS WE HAVE. BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU WANT, I WANT THAT FOR YOU. I JUST REALLY THOUGHT THAT THE NEWS OF YOUR CHILD WOULD AFFECT YOU MORE THAN THE NEWS OF A SCHOLARSHIP. I'M NOT GONNA FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT. [ DOOR CLOSES ] can you believe this? DEREK. IS IT ANY WONDER I HAVE COMMITMENT ISSUES? YEP. YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE OF RELATIONSHIPS. THANKS. CRAP. TURN AROUND. WHAT? JUST TURN AROUND. I HAVE TO CHANGE. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT A CREEP HE TURNED OUT TO BE, YOU KNOW, AND I JUST LET HIM WALTZ INTO MY HOUSE. LIKE, "HEY, I'M A CRAZY PSYCHO. CAN I COME IN?" AND I'M ALL LIKE, "YEAH, SURE. YOU WANT TO SEE MY BEDROOM?" AND HE'S STILL OUT THERE. THEY'LL FIND HIM, OKAY? ALL RIGHT? THE DETECTIVES -- THEY SAID THEY'D CALL WHEN THEY DO, AND THEN WE'LL FINALLY HAVE SOME ANSWERS. UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME. I PROMISE. YOU'RE ALWAYS SAVING ME. OKAY. YOU CAN TURN AROUND. WHOA. IS THIS YOUR WAY OF SAYING "THANK YOU"? NICE TRY, A FEW OF THE CHEERLEADERS HAVE TO BE AT NATHAN'S PRESS CONFERENCE. OH, WOW, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. WOULDN'T YOU BE SAFER JUST TO AVOID THE WHOLE THING? NO, I'M NOT GONNA HIDE OUT 'CAUSE OF DEREK. NO WAY. WELL, ACTUALLY, I MEANT BECAUSE BROOKE MIGHT BE THERE. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] WELCOME TO MY HISTORY, HALEY JAMES SCOTT. [ SIGHS ] [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] HOLD ON. HELLO. Wilcox: Lucas, it's Detective Wilcox. We picked up Derek. THEY GOT HIM. Could you come down to the station? I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE A FORMAL STATEMENT. SURE, UM... I'M ON MY WAY. THEY WANT ME TO GO TO THE STATION. SHOULD I GO, TOO? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. WOULD YOU APOLOGIZE TO NATHAN FOR ME? YEAH. OKAY. I'LL CALL YOU. WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME BY MY HOUSE? ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? NO, UH, NO WIFE, NO MOM. JUST LYING BITCHES, LIKE ME. I REALLY WANTED TO HELP YOU, NATHAN. AND MOST OF THE TIME, THAT MEANS SEX IN MY WORLD. BUT THAT WASN'T FAIR TO YOU AND HALEY. PLUS, THERE'S ALL THIS COOPER STUFF THAT'S GONNA TAKE YEARS OF THERAPY. HOW'S HALEY DOING? SHE HASN'T SAID IT, BUT I THINK SHE'S AS SCARED AS I AM. SHE SHOULDN'T BE. UNLIKE THE REST OF US, THIS BABY'S GONNA HAVE TWO PRETTY GREAT PARENTS. GOOD LUCK. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND WELCOME TO CITY HALL. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO HOST THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, NOT JUST AS YOUR MAYOR, BUT AS AN AWFULLY PROUD FATHER. AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A YOUNG MAN WITH AN ENORMOUSLY BRIGHT FUTURE -- MY SON NATHAN SCOTT. GREATEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I CALLED THIS PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY TO ANNOUNCE WHERE I PLAN TO PLAY BASKETBALL IN COLLEGE. I'VE HAD A LOT OF GREAT OFFERS, BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO PLAY AT DUKE UNIVERSITY. SO, UH, THAT'S -- THAT'S WHERE I PLAN TO GO. BUT... [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, MY FATHER SAID THAT TODAY WOULD BE THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD. IT IS. BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF BASKETBALL. YOU SEE, TODAY I LEARNED THAT MY WIFE, HALEY, IS PREGNANT. [ CROWD MURMURING ] AND WHILE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE HONOR TO RECRUITED BY DUKE UNIVERSITY, I GUESS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU TODAY IS THIS. WHERE I PLAY BASKETBALL -- IF I PLAY BASKETBALL -- IS NO LONGER A DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE ALONE. IT'S A DECISION THAT I'LL MAKE WITH MY WIFE AND MY FAMILY'S BEST INTERESTS AT HEART. AND WHEN I DO, I'LL LET YOU ALL KNOW. AND MY WIFE COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY, SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE THING TO HER. HALEY, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WE'LL FACE IT TOGETHER. BUT I PROMISE YOU, I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD.
