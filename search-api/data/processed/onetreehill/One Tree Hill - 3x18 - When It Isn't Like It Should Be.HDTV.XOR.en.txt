Me and your mom talked it over. I'd like to adopt you. I want to be your husband again, Haley. In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School created a time capsule that was to be opened in 50 years. You want to know what things were like 50 years ago. There's not a single person in this place worth remembering. Everyone here is a loser. Now, I may have to get you out of here, but nothing will happen to you. I promise. You got to let me try to talk to him. Luke... I love you. Now go. I wanted them to like me. Jimmy, please -- I'm sorry. No! He's gone, Danny. I released the time capsule. I don't like you. Hey, Luke, we got to go. So, mom, I'm gonna take off, okay? Hello? Well, I'll be on my cell if you need anything. Don't take it personally. She's been through a lot. I know, but she just seems so hopeless. Yeah, we're all gonna get our hope back, Luke. It's just gonna take some of us longer than others, you know? Henry James wrote, "Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact." I have a feeling this is gonna be a great weekend. Yeah, it will be nice to get away. Hopefully to get everybody to stop talking about you-know-what. Hey, does anybody know anything about this place we're going to? All Rachel said is that it's some kind of cabin. Does Rachel really have to come? Can't we just leave her? Uh, considering it's her family's place, I don't really think we have an option. I'm just saying think about it. Hey, party people. Hey, baby, you ready to conquer the great outdoors? If you say so. Skills. That didn't sound very enthusiastic. Yeah, Skills isn't really the outdoor type. That's okay, Pete isn't either, and he's gonna try to meet us there. Who's Pete? Fall Out Boy? He's Peyton's imaginary friend. Brooke, he's not imaginary. You saw us together at the concert. And now he loves you. Wasn't it nice of Pete to put your bag in the car? You guys, he's coming. You know what? Kanye rolling through, too. Skills, we are only gonna be gone for two nights. What is in that thing? Look baby, if gonna be in the middle of the woods, I need all my stuff -- cd, dvd, mp3, my pillow. Wait, but you know we're not staying in the woods. There's a cabin. Think less rustic. How much less rustic? Now, this is my kind of roughing it. I thought you might like it. Come on. Rachel, this place is awesome. It's been in my family for years. We hardly come here anymore. My dad mostly loans it out to clients. Uh, the kitchen's fully loaded. There's a river for fishing, a TV's in the garage, plasma screen upstairs, and a hot tub in the back. There's five bedrooms. Take any one but the master. Let's check them out. Man, this is nice. What does Rachel's dad do for a living anyway? I don't know. Maybe he's like Tony Soprano. The would explain her personality. Look, Rachel did a very nice thing by inviting us here. Maybe  this would be a good weekend to take it easy on her. But isn't the point of this weekend for us to get back to normal? If Rachel and I aren't back at each other's throats, it's like the terrorists have won. Look at you. What? Your smile. I've missed it. Here's something to make you smile. My latest letter. Ooh! Yay, more mail. This one I really think you're gonna like. Oh. This weekend is so gonna pay off for you. You better grab a bed. The good ones are going fast. The couch is fine with me. Mouth, don't be stupid. Tell you what -- why don't you just bunk with me? Like I said, I'm good. So that's how it's gonna be. You don't think I know what this weekend's about? This is about you trying to relieve your guilt over the time capsule. If you hate me so much, why'd you even come? I came for my friends, especially Lucas. But make no mistake -- I'm here for everybody but you. Nice jump back there. You too. I think we totally scared the crap out of some cows. You know what? Maybe we should be careful. I don't know, given our family driving history, one of us is bound to end up in the hospital. Hey, check this out. Haley's ring? Yeah, I swiped it a couple minutes ago. I need you to hold onto that for me. Why? 'Cause I'm gonna ask her to marry me. Okay, I'm sorry, but didn't you already do that? Yeah, but... I  was thinking about Keith and your mom and how they never got a chance to stand in front of their family and friends and  tell everybody how they feel, you know? Yeah. And Haley and I never did that, either. So now that we're back together, I want to do things the right way. Dude, these things are awesome! I just scared the hell out of some cows! So what do you think, man? You gonna help me out? Yeah, but you do know Haley's gonna freak when she notices her ring's gone. Oh! Oh, this cannot be happening. What? My ring is gone. - Your wedding ring? - Yep. - Why'd you take it off? - Is that important right now? Okay, Haley, calm down. Just stop -- hey! Stop. We'll find it. Think -- where'd you have it last? I don't know. I had it in the car ride on the way over here, and then I just started unpacking. And then I went -- oh, to the bathroom, I think. I think I should have took it off when I washed my hands. Oh, my god. If I washed it down the drain, Nathan's gonna freak out. Haley, chill, okay? Even if it is down the drain, we can still get it back. Do you have a pipe wrench? Oh, sure. In my purse next to the belt sander. Listen, jokey, go find a pipe wrench or I'll find one and beat you with it, okay? I'm so glad I invited you. I'll get the toolbox. Okay, time to cry. Okay, need to find Lucas. Hi, guys. Have you seen Lucas? Yeah. He's out in the woods driving ATM's with Nathan and Mouth. Oh, did he say when he was gonna be back? 'Cause I need him for something. Anything we can help you with? No, this definitely requires Lucas. I'm gonna take a nap before dinner. Just -- Bye. She was horny, right? Oh, yeah, definitely. You ready to get in? Maybe for a couple minutes. The hornets about to play the rockets, and I really want to check out that big screen. But wouldn't you rather check out my big screen? That really don't make no sense. But somehow I don't care. What is that? Well, hopefully it's the crap hiding your ring. So we sift through it? Oh, no, no. We don't sift through it. Look, maybe it's not in there. Where else have you been? To check out the other bedrooms. Aah! Sorry! Doesn't anybody knock anymore? Did you find it? Not exactly. That was not what it looked like. You saw nothing. Brooke, I am so sorry. I was just looking for Haley's ring. I had no idea that you'd be in there "brooking" yourself. Very funny. Now I suppose you're gonna blab about this to everybody. Brooke, I promise. I won't say a thing. - Haley, find your ring? - No, I found a nickel and a really gross assortment of drain hair dating back to the late '80s. Your wedding ring? Nathan is gonna kill you. Yeah, I know. Thanks, Brooke. The bathroom's a mess. Are paper towels in here? Why's it locked? Sorry, this cabinet's off-limits. Why? What's in there? It's just private. You know how people don't like private things revealed. So, look at the time. Um, oh, hey, the guys from Sunkist called. They're hosting this club night not too far from here, so I thought maybe we could go? Tonight? What about my ring? Haley, we will find your ring. In the meantime, just hide that finger. Why are you wearing those mittens? It's like a million degrees in here. Um, my hands are just cold today. So, you never said anything about my letter. Oh, your letter. It had a, uh, surprising effect on me. Well, I hoped that it would. Yeah, who knew words could be such a turn-on? I'm having the best time. Me too. Apparently, not everyone else is. I'll be right back. If you're coming over here to say, "I told you so," save your breath. Haven't heard from "Pete" yet? No. Well, maybe "Pete" lost his phone. Okay, this whole "finger quotes thing" is starting to "piss me off." Listen, some guy named Rudy keeps asking me to dance, so if you could help me out, that would be great. Go. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I was just thinking about how beautiful it is here. It's weird, but... sometimes I have these moments where I feel like Keith is here with me. He is. What are you thinking about? Truthfully? Whether it would be completely pathetic if I checked again to see if Pete's called. I'm sorry, Peyton. It's not your fault, Mouth. No, not for that. I mean about what happened to you, you know, with your leg. Well, that's really sweet, Mouth, but it's not necessary. Sometimes I forget to remember how really... wonderful life can be. So I'm trying not to do that anymore. That's great, Peyton. Good for you. Good night, Mouth. Good night. Mmm, something smells... ...yummy. Hi. Pete? What is this? Peyton, um, I saw him standing here and just sort of thought I was dreaming and went for it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Pete from Fall Out Boy is here. I know. So, I thought you were blowing me off. I said I'd be here. You guys are so adorable. Hey, Pete from Fall Out Boy. I'm Rachel. Thanks for letting me crash your party. No problem. But if you really want to thank me, there'll be a mushroom and goat cheese omelette waiting for me when I finish my shower. Do we like her? Pete from Fall Out Boy. You showed. Didn't anyone think I was gonna show? Hey, come on. I got to show you something. Oh, okay, what do you want to show me? It's freezing out here. This. Are you proposing to me? Lucas, this is really Naley. No, no, no. This is Haley's ring. Nathan stole it. I'm holding on to it till he proposes again tomorrow. Like a re-proposal? She's already had one. Well,  Nathan wants to have this big, fancy wedding. Oh, that is so romantic. Oh, what is so romantic? Oh, is that my ring?! Yeah, I found it. Surprise. Oh, my god. Thank you. Where did you find this? Uh, it was on the thing next to the other thing. I've been looking for this everywhere. Thank you so much. You're not gonna tell Nathan, are you? Nope. I wouldn't do that. Thank you. Oh, god. You're the best. Now I'm pretty much dead. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's an oak tree, and over there, that's a slippery elm, or, to use its latin name, ulmus rubra muhl. Right. That's great, baby. We've been walking for a while now. Shouldn't we drop bread crumbs or something? Hey, look -- badger droppings. Yeah, baby, look, I'm not looking at that. Skills, relax. I have an awesome sense of direction. I  always know where north is. - Right. North, huh? - Yeah. Okay, I got a little experiment. Close your eyes. Now  open your eyes. Now point north again. There. North. Ha! Before, when you pointed, you pointed that way. Yes, you did -- before, when you pointed, those berries was on your left-hand side. Now what side they on? Skills, I said I'm good with directions, not this whole left-right thingy. Great, so we lost. I don't know how I let you talk me into this, man. So, thanks for going on this walk with me, Pete. The doctor says it's good therapy for my leg. No problem. And, you know, your friends are pretty cool, too. Oh, god. You should have heard all the crap they were giving me before you showed up. I was starting to get scared you were gonna be my Snuffleupagus. Your Snuffa-what? My Snuffleupagus. You watched "Sesame Street," right? No, I was more like a transformers kind of kid. Oh, no. Okay, well, Snuffleupagus was, like, this big, hairy, mopey... elephant thing that only big bird could see, and so whenever he talked about him to other people, everyone thought big bird was just making him up. Right, so Snuffleupagus would just show up and start cooking everybody breakfast. Okay, maybe something like that. So, this is, like -- I don't know. I just never would have pictured this -- a famous rock star showing up in the middle of nowhere to hang out with a girl he barely knows. Actually, that's not true. What is? I mean, even though we just met each other, I feel like I know you pretty well. How do you figure? Well, I've listened to your podcasts and your artwork, your dad, everything with Ellie, that Jake guy. Okay, well, um, if you're gonna put it that way, I guess I probably know you pretty well, too. I mean, I know all the lyrics to your songs, like, "My pen is the barrel of the gun. Remind me which side you should be on." So a hot girl quotes me to me. Is that wrong if that turns me on? Maybe a little. So since we know each other so well, I guess it's okay if I do this. You know what? You're right -- this walk was a good idea. Okay, so it was a bad idea. Why would you even show the ring to Brooke? I don't know. I was excited. And you know how Brooke likes these kind of things. Well, the proposal's ruined now. I mean, you don't need a ring to propose. Just adjust your plan a little bit. Because that's all Haley and I ever do. I mean, ever since we got married, nothing's gone the way we planned it. Something always gets in the way, like music or High Flyers or Chris, Dan. But isn't that just, well, life? I mean, everything doesn't have to be perfect. No, but this does. Why couldn't this one moment just work out the way I planned it? Just once, you know, for Haley. You know what? You're right. What are you doing? We're going to go get that ring back. You're right, Nate. You and Haley deserve that perfect moment... at least once in your life. Skills, what are you doing? We have to keep walking. For what? So we can get more lost than we already are? Look, baby, let's just stay put. Once it gets dark, somebody'll come looking for us. Okay. I'll make you a campfire. With what? Girl Scout motto -- always come prepared. Okay. A fire will keep us warm and attract the rescue helicopters. Look at my baby. Look at the little Scout. These matches are pretty old, but... ...they still work. Okay, cool. Let's see the fire. What? That was the last one. So, how mad was Nathan? Not thrilled, but I told him I'd get the ring back. Great. So get it back. How? There's no way Haley's gonna let that ring out of her sight now. Lucas, there's always a way. - Hey. - Hey. You're not seriously wearing your ring in here, are you? Yeah, why? Swirling water, the drain... You know what? That's a really good point, actually. Thanks, Brooke. Yeah. Brooke? What the hell? Hey, Lucas, it's getting dark out. What are Bevin and Skills doing? They're gonna miss dinner. You're right. You got a flashlight? Perfect. Be right back. Bevin?! Skills?! Bevin?! Skills?! - You hear that? - What? That voice. It sounds like Lucas. Where's that light coming from? Oh, come on. Skills?! Bevin?! Skills?! Bevin?! That is Lucas. You guys coming to dinner or what? That house been there the whole damn time? I told you I knew where north was. Yeah, I guess between me losing my ring and Bevin and Skills losing themselves, it has been a pretty eventful weekend. I thought you were gonna get that ring. Brooke's working on it. Well, you're running out of time. Hey, guys, I've got an idea. How about we play "I never"? Oh, yeah, that always turns out great. Come on. It'll be fun. I'll start. I never... had a gold record. Okay, Pete, you do one. Okay. I've never spent a cool weekend in the woods. Okay, that was lame. - Okay, that was rude. - Really? Yeah. Okay, my turn. I never got caught "brooking" myself in the bedroom yesterday. You said you weren't gonna tell! We didn't shake on it. Wait, "brooking" yourself? What is that? Brooke! Okay. Come on, Brooke. Drink up. Wait, hold on, Bevin. Why you drinking? You even know what that means? Mm-hmm. I "Brooke" myself all the time. She keep on talking like that, I might have to "Brooke" myself. Okay! Can we please stop calling it that?! Yo. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I was just trying to think of an "I never," and I realized I never spent enough time with him, you know? Keith. But it's weird. Even though he's gone, a part of me just still feels really happy for the time that I did have. I think that's what this weekend's about -- not regretting our pasts but appreciating everything that we've got now -- great friends, great memories. And you know what? I think it's exactly how he would want it. Hey, Brooke. You here to give me a hand? Sorry, it just, uh, slipped out. That's funny for a girl who should be watching her back. Brooke Davis, are you threatening me? Let's just say payback's a bitch. Look, I know you have your issues with Rachel, but we all really needed this weekend. You still glad we came? Of course. I'm with you. Well, we still got to get that ring back. Yeah. Any idea? No. You? Wait a second. Got something? Yeah, but it's not subtle. Oh, Haley, I'm so sorry. I tripped over the table. Here, here, here. Let me soak this in club soda. You should go take a shower. That's not a bad idea, actually. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. This is terrible. This is really bad. Take care of that. I'll be right back. I had a really great time today, Peyton. Yeah, me too. I probably should go sleep on the couch, though. Yeah, you should. But... you're not going to. So, how many tattoos do you have anyway? Let's see... 37. No, wait, 38. I just got your name on my lower calf. You all right with that? Shut up. Stop it. So, what about you, Peyton? You got any tats? Um, I just have this dark angel between my shoulder blades. Really? No. Can you imagine what my dad would do if I came home with a tattoo? I'm in high school. Right. Speaking of which, how's this supposed to work, anyway? What, me and you? Yeah. I mean, we're just in two totally different places. You're this rock star. I'm just trying to pass A.P. english. I mean, I feel like the answer's to not over-think things. We're just having fun, right? Yeah, sure. And then we'll figure it out. So, that's your solution -- we'll just figure it out? Why not? Too easy? Whatever it is, can you figure it out soon? I'm trying to sleep up here. Mouth, how long have you been up there? Since you guys came in and started making out. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Mouth! Did you know he was up there? Totally. I thought you were cool with it. Oh, god. Oh, crap. - Hey. - Hey. You've done a great thing, Rachel, having everyone here like this. Even if it's all about me relieving my guilt? I was wrong. People are healing. Lucas, Haley... Peyton's really healing with that Pete guy. Still doesn't make up for me opening the time capsule. You know, I never asked why you did it. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I just... I just want to understand why you opened the time capsule. I don't know. To mess with people, I guess. I thought if I opened it, it would reveal everyone for who they really were -- you know, just throw a wrench in the works and watch them squirm. But I didn't want anyone to die. I'm gonna tell everybody that I did it. No, you shouldn't. Why not? At least then they'd have someone to blame. Rachel, there was so much more going on with Jimmy than anyone knew -- more than you could have known. But the time capsule set him off. And if it hadn't, something else would've. I looked at the capsule, too, Rachel, and it was wrong, but people are healing now. Peyton and Lucas, the people who were hurt the most -- it won't do them any good to take them back there again. I say bury it and keep it buried... ...just like the time capsule should have been. What about you? Can you forgive me? Only if you can forgive me. So, you want some company in there? I think I can probably squeeze you in. All right. What are you -- I'm sorry, Mouth. I wish I could take it all back. Yeah, me too. What's that scar there? When I was 6, I went on this camping trip with my mom and Keith. It was the first time I'd ever gone fishing, and I accidentally hooked myself right through the thumb. Ouch. Yeah, hurt like hell. Well... I started crying. So Keith takes out his pocket knife and cuts his thumb, too, and said if we rubbed them together, then we'd be blood brothers. That's sweet. Well, now, whenever I look at that scar, I can remember that time and feel good. But what about my mom? You know, you said that everybody will heal eventually. But what if she doesn't? I mean, she's just so... angry right now -- tortured. I know. But you've done everything you can, everything right. And whether she shows it or not, in her heart, your mom knows that you're there for her. Promise. So, what do I do now? I don't know. Have faith that she's gonna get better. I was going through Keith's belongings, and I found some things that I thought you should have, things that might mean something to you. The adoption papers that Keith filed to father the child that you abandoned. Invitation to Keith's wedding... his wedding to Jules, that is, or Emily or whatever the hell her name was. The wedding to the hooker that you hired to seduce your brother. Keith Scott Motors. He loved that place... ...at least until you swindled him out of it. Karen. You killed him. You may not have pulled the trigger, but you let him go into that school. Karen, I had no idea Keith was going inside. I was trying to keep everyone safe. I had responsibility as the mayor. Responsibility as the mayor?! What about your responsibility as a brother?! What about your responsibility as a father?! You had two sons in there, Dan! Where were you for them? While Keith was lying there... ...dying... ...where were you? I wish it had been you who died in that school. Thank you. For what? I know you didn't want to come here, Skills, but you did anyway. Of course I did, ma. You're my shorty. I always wanted to be someone's shorty. See, the key in whisking is the more you whisk, the more air becomes trapped -- makes eggs spongy. You look happy. You too. Oh, man, this view is so beautiful from the dock. Well, you know, docks are kind of special for us. Remember the time Dan busted us for drinking? Oh, don't remind me. Although, I have to say, I did kind of enjoy throwing up on him. So, Haley, I couldn't help but notice you've had your hands in your pockets all weekend. What's that about? I guess I can't really hide it from you. I lost my ring. Twice -- and I'm really sorry. And you're probably just really disappointed -- You mean this ring? Yeah. Where did you find that? I kind of stole it -- twice. Haley... What are you doing? Over the past year, I learned so much about life and love. And even if I could, I wouldn't take back all the bad stuff that happened between us... 'Cause it brought us here,this moment, this river. Marry me, Haley. Marry me again in front of all our friends and our family. Always -- always and forever. So, this is it, huh? Peyton, it sucks that I have to go, but I'm gonna miss you. Is it okay if I miss you? You better. Oh, Peyton, don't worry. He's just leaving on a rock-concert tour. It's nothing to be concerned about. You're funny. Brooke, let's go. Sorry. I'm coming. So, any chance you'll be riding home with me? Forget it. Get your ass in the car. John Steinbeck once wrote...
