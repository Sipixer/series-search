Petition for annulment? It’ll be like the marriage never happened. There’s... no way that he signed this. It’s over, Haley. Jake Jagielski. You have the right to remain silent. I love you. I love you, too. Did we have fun? You tell me. It’s okay, Deb... I’ll be here when you get out. I’m coming home tomorrow, okay? Don’t come home, Haley. Nathan... Coz I don’t want you to. And Hansel said to Gretel... let us drop these breadcrumbs... so that together we find our way home. Because losing our way would be the most cruel of things. This year... I lost my way. And losing your way on a journey is unfortunate. But, losing your reason for the journey... is a fate more cruel. The journey lasted eight months. Sometimes I travelled alone... Sometimes, there were others who took the wheel... and took my heart. But when the destination was reached... it wasn’t me who arrived... it wasn’t me at all. And once you lose yourself, you have two choices: Bye! Find the person you used to be... or lose that person completely. Because, sometimes, you have to step outside of the person you’ve been. And remember the person you were meant to be. The person you wanted to be. - Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy... - The person you are. Tree Hill student council is pleased to welcome- No. As president of the student council, I promised you guys a good time... I’m Brooke Davis and I’m an idiot, but, please welcome- Jimmy Eat World, that’s a great idea! Brooke, it’ll probably never happen. Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, you got The Wreckers and Pelthead to come and play; you can totally land Jimmy Eat World and when you do, I promise I won’t break up with you to run off and join their tour. That’s it, isn’t it? That’s why your heart’s not totally in to finding a great band for the end of the school year. Haley and Nathan. Yeah. That, and- Jake. You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot. I thought I could help. Well, you just pissed them off. There are two tragedy’s in life:- one is to lose your heart’s desire. The other is to gain it. Now the little that Shaw realised at the time that his words would be the basis of your final. I’d like you to write an essay on the meaning of Shaw’s quote. It’s due on Monday... and then your school year will be over. I guess Haley’s not coming back after all, huh? Game to eleven? I’ll give you ten and the ball. Game. See? You’ll be back in no time. Shooting weak-ass jump shots: that’s your game. I can hardly jump, man. Look, I know you don’t wanna hear this, but if you blow off this English final, you’re not gonna even be eligible to shoot the... ‘weak-ass jump shots’. It’s about loss. I can help you if you want. You don’t think I can write about loss? Hey sexy! What’s wrong? I’m dead. I tanked my calculus final. Are you sure? Maybe you did okay. Erica, we hung out all week and I was totally unprepared. And you can’t exactly bluff your way through math, you know? God, my parents are gonna kill me. Hey. Hey. You wanna go on a road trip this weekend? Okay, where? New York, to see Haley. Alright, odd I know, coming from me, but we do have finals. The essay. I’ll bring my laptop. Whoever sits shotgun can do the typing; whaddaya say, huh? And why Haley? Why now? Because we started the year together... and I can’t end it without seeing her. Okay. I’ll go, we can talk. We need to talk. What’s wrong? Well, I don’t want you to be alarmed, but, my mother took a spill in New Zealand. That’s terrible. She’s asked me to come home. Well, you have to. And I don’t know how long for, coz there’s a bit more to it. I may have a problem coming back into the States; I’m not a citizen and, well, Dan’s trying to get me deported. Deported?! What is wrong with you?! Why can't you simply stay out of my life?! Why can’t you? Oh, please, I’ve been ignoring you for the last seventeen years! Have you? Coz you’ve been coming around quite a bit, Karen. I mean, with all your anger and outrage. Some would call it... passion. Don’t flatter yourself. Just back off Andy and Lucas. And leave my world alone. Isn’t that what this is really about? God! Next time... that’ll be your face! You guys ready for the summer? Yeah, me too. But, first, let’s give it up for the girl who made this happen tonight; my bestest friend: Peyton Sawyer. Peyton, Peyton, Peyton... Jake... You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot. I thought I could help. Well, you just pissed them off... at first. Then, you clearly weren’t going away, so they went over Nikki’s testimony line by line. And they found something. She lied, Peyton. She said that she’d been away at college but she wasn’t. She hadn’t been there in months. Well does, does that even matter, you know? Is that enough? Yeah, any lie is a lie under oath. Once my attorneys get a hold of her transcripts, the judge is gonna lift the court order; I’ll have sole custody of Jenny for a new hearing. And a chance to testify against all her other lies. That’s... that’s so great, Jake. When d’ya get out? A day or so, probably. And I’m gonna come find you as soon as I do. You did this, Peyton. You’ve given me hope; and I love you so much for it. Hey, hey, come on, don’t cry. Haven’t you ever cried when your happy? Come in, Nathan. How’d you know it was me? I can smell the confusion. That was a joke by the way. Nobody ever laughs at my jokes. That’s coz they’re not funny, Coach. Little bird told me you were moving back home. That little bird’s name Lucas? He cares about you. So do I. You’ve come quite a distance this year. I think moving out of that house has been good for you. Coach. Look at me. I’m a mess. Nah, you’re just a little bit broken. But it’s nothing that a summer at High Flyers couldn’t fix. - Could’ve fixed. - Still can. Dan Scott’s not the only one with pull in this town. The only thing that held you back as a player last season was heart... and I’ve watched that change over the past year. And I’ve been so proud of you. That camp has world class trainers. They can mend the physical part. I have a hunch, once that happens, the game will heal your heart. I dreamt about it; in the hospital... about going to that camp. I don’t know. My mom’s coming home soon. Gotta think about it. Promise me you’ll do that. How great is this? Dinner together, steaks on the grill. You not punching me. So I got some good news today. What’s that? Whitey thinks he can get me back into High Flyers. Well, as much as I love hearing you talk about basketball again, I really don’t think camp’s a smart play for you right now. - Dad, its High Flyers. - Exactly my point. You’re injured Nathan. You don’t want the scouts to see you like that. Plus, there’s your mother to consider. Listen, I don’t like to burden you with these things but you’re a man so I’m gonna be honest with you. Your mother’s pill addiction started when you moved out. Now, in no way does that mean you’re to blame, coz you’re not. But... she’s gonna be vulnerable when she comes home. And she’s gonna need you more than ever. Okay, guys, as student council president, I have one final duty before the summer begins and this is it. Tree Hill High, school is out and it is time to party! Please welcome Jimmy Eat World! So, it’s kinda weird; us... living under the same roof. Isn’t that weird. Yes it is. I mean, who would have thought this could have happened back when... we were together? You been talking to Peyton much? Little bit. I wish I was in her life more, you know? Guess I know what loss you’ll be writing about for your essay. I lost myself this year, Brooke. And what I did, I lost the people I truly care about. Oh, by the way, um... when we get to New York... I hope you’ll understand if we spend most of our time with Haley. It’s just... important that I focus on her today. You know? Of course. Everything else can wait. Lucas! Oh my gosh! Hi. Oh, well, it’s about time the tribal leaders came to collect their squaw. Oh, shut up, Chris. Yeah, shut up, Chris. Alright, I’m going. Oh... I see you couldn’t stay away from me. Out! I’m sorry. Oh, it’s good to see you too, Brooke. Yeah, you too, fugitive girl. Well, so what’re you guys doing here? We bought your English assignment. My- Oh my gosh, finals! Oh, god, that just feels like a totally different life. Let’s go, diva. Hey, Joey D, this is my friend Lucas and my friend Brooke. What’s up, guys? Ah, sorry I gotta drag her away but we’ve got three meetings and a satellite radio interview. - You ready? - Um... I’m just feeling a little... flu... ish. Haley... Yeah, I- It’s totally going around. Cover for me? Really, because I’m just, I’m sick as a dog here. No, no, wait Haley, no, no, wait... guys? I’m gonna be sick It’ll be okay. Dan can’t actually affect me legally. Yeah, but if you leave the country, then- Yes, it could create a bit of red tape that would hold up my return to the states. I’m gonna miss you. Unless you come with me. Bring Lucas. Take the summer... few years beyond that. Oh, Andy, I would love to. Honestly, there is nothing I would want more... but... with Deb’s troubles and the businesses and- Keith. Come on in! What do you think? No this is what I’m talking about. So... what-... what do you guys wanna do today? Wanna... take a limo to see the city? You wanna- I was thinking maybe we could just talk. Yeah. Um... I’m in New York city and my parents have resumed allowances; I would be crazy not to shop right now so I’m gonna leave you two alone. Okay? Good luck, see ya, bye. What you walked in on in the dressing room was innocent. Sure. It was, look, I’m not with Chris, okay? We were just kidding around like... We used to do? Yeah. I miss you so much. I’m sorry, Danny. Oh, this oughta be good. For what? Whatever you need me to be sorry for. Well, that’s a long list of screw-ups, Whitey. I take the blame for all of them... if it’ll help get Nathan into High Flyers. Ah, I see. You didn’t come here to apologise; you came to negotiate. I came to say I’m sorry. Dan, you were a great player... maybe I was a lousy coach... maybe I shoulda listened to you more and eased up a little bit. But... we can bury all that now and do what’s best for Nathan. And you think High Flyers is what’s good for him? I think... he needs to get away... and bathe himself in the game that you taught him to love. The game that... gave you all the hopes and dreams that it gave me. If saying ‘I’m sorry’ will help your son; a kid who, by the way, I think the world of... then I’m sorry. I was wrong. And I mean that sincerely. You know what, Whitey, you’re right. I was a great player... and you were a lousy coach. You still are. Erica. Come on, Mouth... give me some... mouth. You’re supposed to be helping me. Take it from someone who was obsessed with trying to be perfect: It’s not about perfect. It’s about living your life and doing the best you can. You’re pretty great, you know that? Yes. I’m so great... that I’ll make you a deal: for every sentence you write of your essay... I’ll give you a kiss. You think I could get an advance? Jake’s getting outta jail! Ah, that’s... that’s great, Peyton. He’s getting Jenny back, too, so I’m gonna go see him right now. Tell him I said ‘hey’. Hey, Nathan? I’m sorry I’m happy. Sometimes they come back, right? Jagielski, long window. Peyton, you don’t have to- Hi, Jake. How’s your sex life in there? What d’ya want, Nikki? I just came to say goodbye. You’re leaving before the hearing? Yeah... this game’s gotten old. Well, I guess it’s just as well. Once the judge hears my side of things, it’s not gonna matter if you’re there or not. You know it. Do you know how it feels, Jake? Knowing that you’ll never see your daughter again? Knowing that she’ll never be a part of your life? You’ll never see her walk... hear her laugh or watch her grow. Goodbye, Nikki. Goodbye, Jake. Oh, one more thing. Yeah. The next time you wanna hide my daughter... you’ve gotta do better that Florida. Do you know how it feels, Jake? Never to see your daughter again? Because you will. Nikki! Say goodbye to daddy, bunny. Forever. Nikki! Guard! Nikki! Somebody stop her! She’s got my baby! Nikki, come on! Nikki! Nikki! I’m guessing you’re here because of Nathan. Kind of. You know that he told me not to come home, right? You know that? Look, mostly, I’m here because of us, Haley. You know, I was... sitting in class... and... I looked over and saw your empty seat... and it struck me; that not too long ago, it was just you and me. Yeah. Suddenly, it felt wrong; that you weren’t there. You think I was wrong for leaving. Here’s what I think: you stood by me when I left the Rivercourt because a voice in my head told me that it’s what I had to do. So I’m here for you, Hales. And I always will be. Even... when I don’t understand it. Thanks, Luke. Thank you. Because... sometimes I don’t understand it either. Um, oh my god, Haley James? We just saw you play last night, could we get an autograph. Um... yeah, sure. Oh, thanks. - What’s your name? - Jennifer. Lucas and Haley aren’t back yet! But you can come in to the Devil’s lair. Drop your things... have sex with Chris Keller! Whatever. Here’s the deal: Brooke Davis thinks Chris Keller can self-serve Chris Keller; in other words, you can go- Oh hey, Brooke. What’s going on? She was just hitting on me. Hey, we missed you at the on-air. How’s the flu bug? Oh... it’ll pass, thanks. How’d it go? Well, without you, there’s more time to talk about me. It went great! What? I can’t breathe... there’s no room with Chris’ ego! Can we go?! Yes, let’s go. You can show me what you got. Hey, you can show me what you got, too. Lucas, it was good seeing you, buddy. Wow, yo-you angry or you just hitting on me? You ever tried singing with you jaw wired shut? I guess you’re angry. Do you think this is a joke? Because it’s not! You’re messing with people’s lives; people I care about! Messing how? You mean having sex with Haley? Coz I never did that. Okay? Is that what you needed to hear? How’s Nathan doing, anyway? Don’t go there. Oh, come on, man, you don’t think I think about the guy? I’m a song writer; I carry all that crap around. Well, then you should know how he's doing! He's terrible! Well, he should be. Haley’s a great girl. It would suck to lose her. And you don't feel the slightest bit guilty about that?! No, and I’ll tell you why: this is a one in a million chance we’re taking here. You gotta be selfish as hell; you’re either all in... or you’re out. You don’t think I’ve tried to talk to her about it? In the middle of the night on some random bus ride? Hell, man, I’ve talked to her a lot more than you have these past few months. Listen, Luke, I know she’s your friend, so... you can hate me for helping her chase her dream, but... I’m just trying to help her, now. You know? That same way you are. The rest, it’s up to her. Hey. Tell Brooke I said ‘hi’. You don’t lock your door at night. No one can hurt me. Nah, that’s where you’re mistaken. - Is that right? - That’s right. You see, I know about your little tax evasion scam... and more than that...I have proof of it. You know, I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about. Really? I see you’ve got a... new security system installed. Who installed it? Gotta diversify your portfolio, Dan. Security’s good business; I should know. I own the company that put your system in. I have your ledger. You’re bluffing. Well, we’ll see about that. You know, leave all this. I plan to redecorate when I buy this place, anyway. Oh yeah, sorry about today with the fans, earlier. - We were talking and, I just, I’m sorry- - It’s okay. It’s okay; actually, it was kinda cool to... see how far you’ve come. You know, I’m proud of you. But? It’s killing him, Haley. I guess I just don’t understand why it has to be one or the other: music or Nathan. I noticed you weren’t... wearing your wedding ring. It’s not because of the record label. And it’s not because I don’t love him. I just... I feel like I don’t deserve to. Things were so much simpler when it was just the two of us. But it’s not. - Hey. - Hey! How’d your essay go? I did the best I could. Nice try, Hargrove. Lucas... we’ve got to get out of town before I spot another sale. I’m gonna go find somebody to carry these. Here, um... it’s my English final. Pulled an all-nighter. Aren’t you... supposed to be trashing hotel rooms or something? You know, what kind of a rock star spends the entire night doing an English final? Well... I am still Tutor Girl. Right? Besides, it was... it was a pretty easy topic for me. So... maybe this means you’re coming back soon? No. I’m not coming home, Lucas. This is my life, now. Oh, um... I need you to... give this to Nathan for me, please. Please, Luke. So I guess this is goodbye? Yeah, I guess so. I... will always be there for you, Haley. You’ll always be my best friend. Hey. Come here. It’s all gonna be okay now. Peyton... - I have to go. - What? No, don’t. - Stay here. - Nikki found Jenny. What d’ya mean? She has her, Peyton. What? How? I don’t know how, okay? But I have to go, I have to find her. I’ll go with you! - No, you can’t. - But... Peyton. You can’t. Why not? I mean, what’s the point of school and grades and all of this if I’m not... God Jake, I can’t be without you, I love you! You’re meant for better. - I’m not! - You are. Hey, look, I don’t know, maybe I’ll find Jenny sooner than later. Maybe I’ll be back- You won't! You know you won’t! Come here. Listen to me. I need you... - to get past this. - No! I need you to forget about me and move on. Okay? You’re too amazing to carry this around. You’re too full of greatness and... I love you too much. But I have to go. No! You know, I can’t have Jenny be with Nikki. Jake! Thank you. You know, I coulda held you in my arms forever. It still wouldn’t have been long enough. You miss Haley, don’t you? You gonna be alright? Yeah, it’s just hard to let someone go, you know? It’s okay that you’re into Peyton. I’ve been avoiding it the whole trip, but I found the things in your closet; and its fine. I just wanted to say goodbye before I left. You’re leaving now? Tonight? I think it’s best. For mum... and for you. Andy... Oh, and... I need you to give this to Lucas. Of course. Andy. I love you, you know? I do. And I love you, Karen. But, somehow, it just... doesn’t seem to be enough. George Bernard Shaw once wrote: ‘There are two tragedies in life: one is to lose your heart’s desire... the other is to gain it’. Clearly, Shaw had his heart broken once or twice. Where you been? Went to see a friend. Yeah? Anyone I know? Not really. You know you’re bleeding? Yeah. It should probably hurt, but... it’s kinda weird; I don’t feel anything. As far as I’m concerned, Shaw was a punk. Coz you know what? Tragedies happen. What’re you gonna do, give up? Quit? No. I realise now that when your heart breaks, you gotta fight like hell to make sure you’re still alive. Coz you are, and that pain you feel... it’s life. The confusion and fear... that’s there to remind you that somewhere out there is something better. And that something is worth fighting for. This year, I got everything I wanted and everything I wished for... but, in a way, I lost even more. Haley, the new tour posters are here. What’s this? Um... nothing, you know, just... stupid kid stuff. What d’ya think? Wow! Shaw was right: as we strain to grasp the things we desire... the things we think will make our lives better... money, popularity, fame... we ignore what truly matters... the simple things: like friendship, family, love. The things we probably already had. So, Mr. Shaw thinks that getting your hearts desire is a tragedy? I say he’s wrong. I mean, clearly, Shaw never kissed Erica Marsh. Yes, losing your heart’s desire is tragic. But gaining your heart’s desire... it’s all you can hope for. This year, I wished for love. To immerse myself in someone else and to wake a heart long afraid to feel. My wish was granted. And if having that is tragic... then give me tragedy. Because, I wouldn’t give it back for the world. Hey. Need some help? Nah. I figure if I leave all my stuff here, my parents are gonna have to let me come back for senior year. Look, are we ever… gonna talk about Peyton? And the stuff you found? It’s not a big deal. Actually, I was… kinda relieved. Relieved? I thought you might be into me. And… that would’ve ruined everything because we’ve become friends… and that’s exactly what I needed. And… it’s exactly what I want. But you seemed… upset… that I held onto all that stuff; you still do. Finding that stuff was kind of like… evidence. Reminded me of what happened… and how it happened. And I guess my heart just wasn’t ready for that. How you feeling, Ms. Scott? Coach! How you doing? Well, I guess you’re waiting for Danny. Uh, yeah, yeah, he… planned to pick me up. I was… hoping he’d bring Nathan. I lied. I had one of the girls at the office put you back an hour. I thought you and I might… have a talk. Any chance you could tap that thing? Sorry, we’re closed. Well, I hope so because if this is open, you’ve got problems. Where’re you taking this? - Over there, but… - I got it. Uh… thanks. No problem. If I had a dollar for every keg I’ve carried, I’d be a rich girl. Bartender? Only when I’m not killing people or saving the world. Well, if you’re looking for a job, I can put in a good word with the owner. Actually, I’m looking for Peyton. Oh, um… I’m Peyton. Oh. I’m Ellie. I write a column for Alternative Press. You know it? Know it? I read it cover to cover. Which column? Actually, it’s a new one. But I heard some high school girl got The Wreckers and Jimmy Eat World to play her club night. And I wanted to know more. Whaddaya say? I’d say I’m really flattered, but… I think last night was my final show. Well, I assume there’s a reason for that? Yeah. Sounds like the makings of a great story. No thanks. But it was really nice to meet you. It’s nice to meet you too, Peyton. Luke, find the combination and Dan is… finished. Hey. What’s up? Nothing, you? I thought you said you were done spying on him. I am. Then what’s in the bag? Just… bringing this back to you. You gave me your word, Luke. I know, and I’m done. I promise. Giving up on your dreams? Mom. Oh, my boy. I have missed you. It’s gonna be okay now, mom. Yeah. So, what’s all this about? Nathan’s moving home, Deb. We’re gonna be a family again. Welcome home. - Hi-O! - Oh God! What? You scared the hell outta me. You don’t know anybody who has IM named ‘WATCHMEWATCHU’, do you? Hmm... sounds pervy. Sadly no, why? Doesn’t matter. Sup? It’s actually what I came to ask you. Couldn’t find you at the club last night; figured maybe you stayed in with Jake. Jake’s gone, Brooke. Nikki has Jenny. Oh, Peyton, come here. What happened? I can’t, coz if you hug me, then I’m gonna start… bawling again, so… some summer break, huh? Well… I mean, he’s coming back, right? He’ll… find Jenny and then he can slap Nikki and then he’s coming right back to you! I just know it. Thanks. Okay, I’m sorry, I’m changing the subject; how was your road trip with Lucas. Um… fine. Fine? Is this gonna get sexual? I don’t know, that’s kind of up to you. What? It can wait. You’re head is spinning. Brooke, considering you’re leaving, tomorrow, it can’t wait. Spill! Okay. Um… I was snooping through Lucas’ things; kind of on purpose, and found a bunch of your stuff that he saved and I think he’s still into you. Like I said: bad timing… seeing that Jake just left, or maybe good timing? Brooke, I’m sorry. I know you have feelings for Lucas. Phantom feelings. Like… when you lose a leg and try to scratch it. Lucas was my… gangrene infected, amputated limb. Really? I was so insecure when I was with him, Peyton… and this whole thing just reminded me that I don’t wanna be that girl again. I won’t be. Marcus, I don’t understand, he was supposed to be there by now. Well… can you leave him another message in case he checks in? Andy Hargrove. Thanks. Karen? Oh my gosh, Deb! Welcome back! You look like you just saw a ghost. Well, I think I did. How you feeling? Uh, good. Great actually. I just… I need to keep busy. Are you sure? I mean… you don’t wanna take some time? Uh, no, no, absolutely not. Well, okay. Let’s talk. Okay. You’re not going away, are you? Not this time. That’s a rad jacket. Thanks. I stole it from Courtney Love. Really? Yeah. She was being a bitch. So I took it. Have a seat. So, the editors at THUD are thrilled about your story and they say I have to talk to you. Is it that bad? Well, if there’s no House of Freaks at TRIC, there’s no story. And what about the rest of your life? Is it that bad? What do you know about it? Well… your eyes are puffy which, from experience, screams textbook crying eyes. You have your hair up so you’re probably not planning on impressing any boys today. I’d say you’re nursing a hell of a broken heart; and not the school-girl crush kind, the real thing. Um… okay. Uh… well, I mean, I started TRIC to escape it all, you know, and… bring people together; let the music drown out the white noise in life. And tell me about your life. What is the white noise made of? Oh, god, I mean… everything unnecessary… like… cliques and… greed and popularity and harassment- The song remains the same. Yeah, as far as I can tell, it does. Looks like we’re both getting better. You love this game, don’t you? Depends on what day you ask me. Nah, you loved it every day since you could hold a ball. So… why aren’t you going to the camp? You talk to dad? Talked to Whitey. He said you’re staying because of me. Whitey also drinks a lot, mom. Then you’ll go. Look, uh… dad told me about the pills; about how you started taking them because… Because what? Because I moved out. Is that what he told you? I took the pills because you moved away? Yeah. That son of a bitch! Nathan, listen to me; you misunderstood me when I said that I wanted us to be a family again. I want us to be a family again; you and me. Will you come with me? Yeah. But what’re we gonna do about dad? Huh, he won’t just let us go. We’re getting out, Nathan, together. Your father can burn in hell for all I care. Where is the combination? Damn! Game over. Brooke? Um… I found it while I was packing. Just… kind of felt like I should try it on. Can we talk? Yeah. I can’t let you leave tomorrow without saying this. Lucas, if this is about Peyton, I don’t- I love you, Brooke. And, I know: just friends, but… I need you to know how I feel. I can’t believe I’m hearing this. Brooke, don’t go. I can’t believe… you would walk into my bedroom - formally your bedroom; but that’s besides the point - and knowing our history… blurt out that you love me. Coz I was hoping you would. Brooke? It took you long enough. This has gotta be a dream. Lucas! Do not make me join you! Uh… a little privacy here. No, you have been in the shower forever. By the time I even get in, the water is gonna be... ...cold! Are you taking a cold shower!? - No, the hot water just- - Gross! You are. You know what, next wet dream, tell Peyton I said ‘hi’. Eww! Mom, can we get a lock on the bathroom door? Going somewhere? Like New Zealand? You know, Keith was right. He once told me that I… I hide my heart and I run from love. I did that with Andy. I’m just being dumb; we don’t even have money for two plane tickets to New Zealand, right? We have enough for one. Look… mom, I love you… but… I’m a big boy now and I’ll be fine on my own. It’s your journey to take. If I thought he was coming back soon, I wouldn’t even consider it. - I know. - But you’re… Dan… is pulling the strings as usual. Not for long. Let me ask you something: are you not helping me move you because it brings back bad memories or because you’re a lazy pile of crap? You mean… bad memories like these? Oh god. We started off the school year this way. Yeah, don’t remind me. - You were never happier. - You were never hornier! Oh yeah? You want some more of that magic? - Don’t- - Come here. - No- - Come on. Okay, stop it! Ah! Come on. - Will you stop! - Well, well! First Lucas, then Jake, now Nathan. I guess slutty’s in season! And why is bitch being a Brooke? I don’t know, maybe because I’m leaving for the summer; possibly forever and my best friend is off… giving interviews and having… pseudo-innocent foreplay with kinda married guys. Okay. Hi, Alternative Press? Editorial please. What’re you doing? I know that you are needy right now and so I’m postponing the interview until after my best friend is gone for the summer. Hi, Ellie Harp, please. Oh, okay, um… maybe I have the name wrong. She’s doing an article on Peyton Sawyer and the nightclub TRIC. Oh, are you sure? Okay, thanks. You okay? The woman said that she knows all the columnists at the magazine and she’s never heard of Ellie Harp or the story. So… maybe you have the wrong magazine? Yeah, maybe. Every transaction is listed. The actual sale price and the price Dan declared to the government. He’s done it a thousand times Deb; it’s a federal offence. Prison? So… why are you bringing this to me? He’s my husband. And he’s my father. But… I figured you could use it to get away from him. To get out. You’d do that for me? Yeah, and for Nathan… and Keith… and everybody else he’s hurt. So… this is it. This is the smoking gun that can bring down Dan Scott. Yep. Looking for something? Where is it? Where’s what? Don’t play dumb with me! Where’s the ledger?! Oh, you mean the ledger that exposes my husband’s illegal activities over several years? Tell me that ledger doesn’t exist, Dan. You don’t see the big picture, Deb. Oh, I think I do. Just give me the damn book! You told Nathan that my addiction was his fault. What’re you talking about? You knew I wouldn’t come back unless Nathan was living here. Take another pill, Deb? You’re delusional. No, I was delusional: loving you, thinking you’d change. But I’ve got clarity now, Danny-boy, and I finally see you for the pathetic, broken man you are. Lemonade? You know, a guy like me works his entire life trying to build something. Trying to make his mark in the world; to provide for his family, working hour after hour to turn the seed of an idea into a successful business. A fraudulent business. A fraudulent business owned by my wife. You know, it’s a shame that ignorance isn’t an excuse, Deb, because when you turn in that ledger, both of Nathan’s parents will be felons. Hell, you’ll just go from one institution to the next. Today: the drunk tank, tomorrow: prison. You bastard. No, Deb, the bastard would’ve been Nathan; that is, if I wouldn’t have married you. And made us all so happy. Where’s the ledger, Deb? Hello? You can run but you can’t hide. Who is this? It’s Ellie. Where’d you get this number? Well, I- Leave me alone and don’t call me! Mom? Nate. What’s going on? You sounded freaked out on the phone. We’re gonna have to stay here for a while. What happened? Nathan, I’m so sorry. It’s just… your father has done some things. - What things? - Nothing that concerns you. But Lucas found something. Lucas. He was trying to help us. But it-it doesn’t matter now. What does matter is that you remember I love you… and I always will. We were gonna get out. And we still are, okay? I promise you. But… for now, that has to be our secret. I want you to go to High Flyers. Forget it! I’m not leaving you here alone with Dan! Nathan, I’ll be fine! You go to that camp and don’t look back for a second, do you understand me? It has to end. Yes… it does. Ah, here we go again. Oh, don’t mind me; I just need your measurements. Alright, I’ll play along; my measurements for what? For the pine box they’re gonna put you in. I’m about to bury you, Whitey. You crossed the line, Whitey; talking to Deb, meddling with Nathan. You know, I occupy a seat on the school board; I think we’re gonna make some changes next season. Don’t you threaten me! Oh, it’s not a threat! You’ve got some health concerns, don’t you? Bad eyes and all; that coupled with the first round playoff loss. Which you coached! Because you were ill! You know, it’s a shame you never won the state title, Whitey, because as far as I’m concerned… you’re never gonna coach again! You better be careful, son. You mess with my livelihood, I’ll mess with yours. Speaking of threats. You know, most people… when they go they leave the world a lesser place, but not you. No, the world won’t even blink. Well, you’d know, wouldn’t you, Whitey? You’re playing with fire, Danny… and you are about to get burned! Bring it on, old man. Okay, I’ve spoken with Deb so she’s gonna look after things. And all my numbers are near the phone. - Oh, and if Keith calls- - Mom… go. If you need anything… well I’ll only be… half a world away. Go find happiness, mom. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, he still hasn’t checked in? Oh-no, no message, thank you. - What’s going on? - Where is it? Where’s what? Whatever it is you have on my dad, where is it? Nathan, look. Lucas, you said you were done! Nate, you don’t wanna do that! I wanted to tell you… Nate. I was just… waiting for the right time. You went to see her. You’re just full of lies, aren’t you? Nathan! You don’t wanna push this right now, Lucas! Trust me! So the prodigal son returns. You looking for this? Or, maybe, you’re looking for this. Go on, take a closer look. How stupid do you think I’d be? Who keeps money in the ceiling? Or a ledger of their criminal activities? Uses jersey numbers as a combination. Although you did figure that out so you’re not entirely dense. Why? Why? To test your loyalty, Lucas. You know what the shame is? I would have given you the world, son. I would have welcomed you in with open arms. But you failed the test. And for that, you get nothing. For that, you are nothing. So it was all a lie? The money in the ceiling, the bank account in my name. No, the account was real. I built that since you were a boy, but that’s gone now, too. So’s your heart medication. The game’s over, you lose. No. You’re wrong. Because I can finally let you go. I mean nothing to you? You mean nothing to me. I’m out. That’s where you’re wrong. You’ll never be out. Son. We’ll see about that. Okay, that is the last bag, box or suitcase I shift this summer. Your cab’s on the way. - I don’t wanna go! - I know. And I don’t want you to go but life sucks like that. But, hey, you are going to be back in no time and then we will be seniors and oh what fun we will have then! Like what? Hm, like… kidnapping… and… getting married and… burning letters from guys before we read them. Speaking of, where is our boyfriend? I don’t know. I guess he’s not even coming to say goodbye to me. Suppose it’s a test… for the new me. I’m sure he will be here. I, on the other hand, will not. What!? I promised Karen I wouldn’t sleep on TRIC and I’ve gotta return the keys to Deb. I’m sorry. I’m gonna miss you, Brooke Penelope Davis. I’m gonna miss you, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer. Hoes over Bros? Buds over Studs. I thought you weren’t talking to me. I’m not. I’m going to High Flyers. Nate, that’s great! When I get back… all this brother stuff is over. What? You lied to me, Lucas; about my dad… and about going to see Haley. I’ve got enough of that in my life. Nathan, I was trying to help. Yeah, well you can stop that now. All I need you to do for me is knock down shots next year, that’s it. We’re not brothers. We’re not even friends. Well… I’ll see ya, Brooke. Have a nice summer. Oh, thanks, everybody. Talking to yourself? What, is your… summer job driving a cab? I put your stuff in the car. So I guess this is goodbye? Tell me that was a goodbye kiss. I wanna be with you, Brooke. What? I’m sorry. I know we’re friends… it’s just how I feel. What about Peyton’s stuff? I keep that stuff as a reminder of how badly I screwed up things. With you. To remind myself, if I ever get a second chance… I’d never let you go again. I don’t know what to say. I, um… I gotta go. Brooke? You think… you could ever- Lucas… I’m sorry. I… I gotta go. Bye. Have a nice summer, Brooke. Jake... I know it’s late. I- You’re right… it is late. As a matter of fact, it’s half past the crazy bitch so leave me alone! Peyton, I can explain. Explain what!? That you’re a stalker… or that you’re insane and you’ve been sending me creepy e-mails?! I didn’t send you anything. Yeah, right. I called your supposed magazine; they’ve never even heard of you. My name is Elizabeth. Great, so even your name is a lie. Like your middle name: Elizabeth. It’s where you got your middle name. Who are you? I’m your mother. Oh, Nathan, I was hoping that was you. I’ve been here, alone, all night! I had… something to do. Oh, honey. I know this is hard for you but, I promise you, we’ll be free soon. I know we will. Do you need help with anything? No, I just… I have one more bag in the car. Okay. Hi. Looks like it’s just you and me this summer. Tennessee Williams once wrote: ‘We all live in a house of fire. No fire department to call. No way out. Just the upstairs window to look out of- while the fire burns the house down… with us trapped, locked in it.’ Synchro: Amariss
