I'm a virgin. Really? Did someone call for a nanny? Grandma! I'll edit the book because I believe in it. And I believe in you. But we can't be together. We will be. You think about him much? Lucas. Every day. Hey! I've seen you,okay,outside of the school. I've seen you driving past the house, and now you just happen to be at the hospital? Nathan,stop. I was just getting a checkup. - The truth is,I was hoping ... - no,don'T. Dan,don't hope. You hear me? There's no hope for you. Millicent. They're giving me a baby. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Sync: Öíâ¤ÁúÁú   </font> One Tree Hill Season 5 Episode 15</font> Okay,it's okay. Angie,it's okay,sweet girl. No,don't cry,baby girl.Please! Don't you want to sleep? I do,brooke. Okay,you know I love you,all right? And I love baby angie,but I also really,really love my sleep, and I haven't gotten any in like three nights. Yeah,and it shows. Thanks. As if I didn't know I look like amy winehouse pre-rehab. Peyton,I'm sorry. Okay,she didn't come with instructions,but I will figure it out. I promise.I promise. Hey.Hey.Hey. Come on. Crying I'm the purple monkey,and I sure wish you'd stop crying. Hey,baby! Who wants a pacifier? Look! Ooh,who wants a bottle? You hungry? Crying continues How about,uh,brooke's boob?Huh? Hey. Hey. Look at the dancing animals. Aren't they funny? Hey! Oh,my god,did you think that was funny? Look!Look!Hey! No. No,we like that,remember?It's funny. Brooke,really? She's finally sleeping. I think the crying wore her out. Hey,I'm sorry about the stuffed-animal thing. I just ... I was desperate. It's fine. But,I mean,do you think angie's illness has something to do with her fussiness? It's not supposed to. If I were having heart surgery,I'm pretty sure I'd be a little fussy. Yeah,but the doctor said her heart condition doesn't even really affect her now. It's just that,if she doesn't have the surgery,it'll cause big problems later. For now,she's supposed to be a regular little baby. Well,she is,and regular little babies cry sometimes. Sometimes. Peyton,she cries all the time. I feel like she doesn't like me. Oh,no,come on. She's gonna love you. You'll see. Yeah. This don't look like virgin underwear. Give me those. I'm just saying. If they belonged to my girl,she ain't gonna be no virgin no more. Dude,shut up.And how do you even know about that? Fergie. How'd he know? Junk. You know he tried to get with her,right? I'm just playing,man. He overheard you two talking the other night. You know these walls are thin. Well,I don't care that she's a virgin. I actually think it's nice. Hey,there's something to be said for it. Knowing exactly where your girl hasn't been,or has been. That's not what I meant. Millicent's just pretty amazing. Dude,you are so whipped. I mean,I probably would be,too,considering that she 10 times hotter than that cougar you was chasing. So,uh,I thought you were guys were gonna get it together. You know? Maybe clean this place up and hold off on the friday-night water fights. Man,you asking for a whole lot. I'll tell you what. Let me have them drawers. I'm just playing,man. All right. Somebody looks older today. I do! You? Why would that be? It's my birthday,mama! It is your birthday! - I'm 5! - You're 5? Don't I get my kisses? Oh,okay. That's five and one for good luck. So,what do you want for your birthday? - I want two things. - Okay. I want a wii,and I really want grandpa dan to come to my party. Knock,knock,knock. Hey. So,how is my favorite grandson doing on his birthday? I'm your only grandson. And a handsome one at that. So,what does my handsome grandson want for his birthday? Hello,son. What do you want? Do I have to want something to say hello? Yeah,dad,unfortunately you do. I'd like to stop by and wish jamie a happy birthday. It's never gonna happen. Look,I know I screwed up as a father,but I'd like to be a good grandfather. Well,you should have thought of that before you killed jamie's great-uncle. You're not coming to that party,dan,or anywhere near my son. Yeah,I mean,my office is a disaster right now, but the recording studio's gonna be really cool when it's done. How's the tour? Oh,mia,that's awesome. Yeah,and your album's selling really well,too. So you just keep doing your thing and believe in your art, and we'll all live happily ever after. So,tell me more about the tour. - Hey,coach. - Hey. What's the status on quentin? Well,if he would channel his stubbornness into his recovery,he'd be fine. How 'bout your recovery? What are you talking about? I just wanted to come by and make sure that you're okay. Isn't it your son's fifth birthday today? Oh,that's right.There's lots of mom things you could be doing. Yeah,there's a friend thing I want to be doing,too. You know she's gonna be there. Yes,I know,hales. You told me at least like six times. I know lindsey's gonna be at the party. I'm just saying,if it makes you uncomfortable,I can ask her not to come. I know,and I love you for it,hales,I do,but the way I see it, lindsey knows I'm gonna be at the party,and she's choosing to come. Look,I told her that one day she's gonna come back to me. Maybe this is that day. tell me you finished the sketches. Sketches? You're kidding,right? For the macy's presentation. She hasn't slept in three days,and neither have I. And she's so cute,but this meeting is huge for "C.Over B. " Macy's is the larges macy's is the largest department-store chain in america, and if this doesn't happen,then I've let you down,I've let myself down, and I've probably somehow let my parents down. Okay,milly,look at me. We are gonna be fine. I'm gonna be complete those sketches.And they're gonna be nothing short of fantastic. - Really? - Really. Under control. First,tell me something. How cute do I look with this baby? Aren't I so angelina? So angelina. I know! Did you hear that,my girl? Let's say "hi. " "Hi,aunt milly. Hi,baby. How's my baby girl doing? Busy. Really? I thought your little mini-me flew the coop. Mia?Yeah,she's out on tour,but that doesn't mean my job stops. Did you know her album is number 2 on itunes? Yeah,I do,but you ain't on itunes. You cyber-stalking lucas,right? Oh,come on. Don't act like you ain't check his facebook profile about 50 times just to see if he done changed his status from "engaged" to "single. " You can't fool me,P.Sawyer. Internet is a dangerous place. What do you want,skills? Well,I kind of need help locating jamie's birthday gift, and you gonna be the girl to help me find it. Well,I would love to,but ... no "buts," 'cause you ain't got one. Both laugh Now,look. I told nathan I was gonna get this wii, but that's about as easy to find as willy wonka's little golden ticket. So we got our work cut out for us. - Oh,"us," huh? - Yeah,us. Now,I'm gonna get the wii,and you gonna get up out this gloomy-ass office. I was thinking of making the guys pumpkin bread. I thought it might make them like me m-more. I don't think I've ever seen the floor of this place. Did you know your couch was brown? Did they do this for me? Because the last thing I want is to be a burden. No,we've been talking about cleaning the place up for weeks. So this has nothing to do with me? Just boys becoming men. Well,it's kind of nice. Uh,why don't we go out for lunch? But we just bought all this food. Well,then,we'll have a lot to eat later. guess who I saw this morning. I have a feeling I'm not gonna like this. Dan showed up at the gym. Don't you find it creepy that your dad hangs out around a high-school gym? He's dan.It's all creepy. What did he want? He wanted an invite to jamie's birthday party. And don't worry,I told him it's not gonna happen. Well,you're stronger than I am,'cause jamie's been asking me all week if his grandpa dan's gonna come to his birthday party, and I have been dodging the subject altogether. Excellent parenting. Yeah,thanks. I don't blame him for wanting to get to know his grandpa. I just wish his grandpa wasn't dan. Me too. We just can't trust him. I know. Who can't we trust? Hey,buddy. You excited for your birthday party today? You were talking about grandpa dan,right? So,can he come? I'm sorry,jamie. Grandpa dan's not gonna make it today,okay? Voil? One down and a zillion to go. Does this say,"I'm cool,a tad slutty,and well-priced"? Thank you. It never gets old hearing how great you are. What? What? No! We were doing so well! What? What is it? Are you tired? Are you hungry? Do you hate my spring line? What? Apparently,you're not into feathers. That's okay. Man,I can't believe we found this thing. You seem pretty excited,skills. Who's the game really for? Well,it's kind of for jamie,and kind of an excuse for me to spend a little bit more time at the scott crib. Excuse?Since when do you need an excuse like a worship to you? Yeah,it ain't him,though. It's nathan and haley. I don't think they really want me around jamie since the whole almost-wedding thing. No. I mean,that's ... dude,that's crazy. Nathan and haley love you. Yeah,but I got they son kidnapped. It just kind of changed things. Look,I don't think it's you. I just think they've been going through a lot lately. Yeah,but that's naley we talking about,though. They always be going through a lot. Well,hey. I know one thing,and that's ... if you don't ask for something, you can't just expect for it to happen,you know? Yeah,you're right. So,you talk to lucas? You want him back,don't you? It doesn't matter what I want. And,yeah,I did talk to him,and he's clearly in love with lindsey. Hmm.That's sweet. And total crap,but,hey. I just want him to be happy. What do you think about this one? Think lindsey will like it? I think it's just like the other four shirts you tried on. Yeah,but this one's blue. Lindsey really loves blue. The right shirt's not gonna bring her back,luke. Ah,maybe I'll just try the first one again. You're my best friend,so I say this out of love. Hey,look at me. You got to give lindsey time. She'll come back if she's ready. Have you guys been talking much lately? Yeah,a little bit. I mean,we e-mail about the book. Just about the book? Yeah,she already knows where I stand on everything else. Okay,um,I've been giving you a lot of space because ... well,because I think I know you pretty well,and I think that's what you need. But you know that I'm here for you,right? Yes,haley,I know that. And I thank you. But you're friends with lindsey,too,and I don't want to put you in the middle of this. Okay? I got to change. No,no.No. Yes,I'm friends with lindsey,but you are my best friend,and I love you, so if you need me,you better put me in the middle ... or else. This one. Hi,guys. How was your day? So,what are we gonna do? It's a new episode of "tila tequila. " Did you want to watch something else? No. We're cool. Fergie's a big fan of yoga. It's actually pilates. I can change it if you want me to. Um,actually,we have to go. We told haley that we'd help her set up for the party. How dumb is wrapping paper,man? All you do is rip it off. Yeah,but how great is it that you got jamie a wii? I got him legos. Yeah. What's going on,skills? I shouldn't have had those beers that day at the wedding,man. Dude,it wasn't your fault. Yes,it was,'cause I should have went with him. Yeah,that nanny shouldn't have fallen off the crazy train. But what if something bad would have happened to him? Skills,jamie's fine. You can't go down that road. I just want nathan and haley to know I'm sorry. You know,twon,I think it's pretty great how much you love jamie and how good you've been to him, but something tells me nathan and haley know it,too. Yeah? Then how come they don't let me come over no more? And the crazy nanny's gone,so I know they need help. Look,I don't blame them. I just wish I could take it all back. I just wish they'd forgive me. They will. And you just got to forgive yourself. That is so not cool. Who ordered the creepy clown? I did. He does balloon tricks. Hiya!It's bucko the clown! Glad to meet ya! I always liked clowns. Besides,look at the size of his feet. Hey!How's the baby? Wake her up.I'm leaving her here. Oh,that bad. Let's just say i could sleep better at a metallica concert. But she looks so cute today. You'll get the hang of it,brooke. It just takes some practice and learning how to function on no sleep. We're getting the "no sleep" thing down. Oh,yeah. It's just so hard. I'm trying to be patient,but I can't get any work done with her wailing all the time. Do you have any chicken fingers?! Do you have an inside voice? Brooke,we are outside. No,it's okay. Ohh.Damn kid. That's what cute little babies grow up to be. It's okay.baby It's okay. Children talking indistinctly So,you nervous? About what? Your face-to-face with your ex-fianc? She's not my ex-anything. Well,haley said you tried on like eight shirts today. It was five. And that's privileged best-friend information. Well,I've got the privileged-husband card. Good point. You really still think she's the one? Yeah,I do. Good. You boys ready to sing? You're the singer. You can't afford me. All right. Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear jamie happy birthday to you Make a wish,jamie Something you really want. I know what I want more than anything! Brooke,peyton. and deb. Do,dump,or marry? I'd marry deb. I'd much rather do deb. Keep dreaming. Whatcha talking about? I got to take a leak. Me too. Do those two do everything together? Who,dumb and dumber? Yeah,pretty much. But I love them,though. Skills,you know,I'm really enjoying living with you guys, but is everyone okay with me being there? You really want to know? Please. They hate me,right? Nah,it ain't like that. It's just that our apartment's always been a guys' crib. You know,no rules. I mean,we got video games and beer,and sometimes we have these ridiculous water fights. You know,just guy stuff. I'm killing the fun. I mean,we're trying to clean up our act,but bad habits die hard. Come on. Hey,birthday boy. You want to help me change her? She's a girl. That's gross. Where's owen? Owen was not ready for an emotional relationship that had responsibilities exceeding those of pouring drinks in a bar. He didn't like what was under the clothes,did he? He never got what was under the clothes,thank you very much. You want to play a game or something? I'd love to,sweetie,but I'm a little busy with angie right now. Can we play later? Hey. You want to know a secret? You know why I decided to take care of angie? 'Cause of you,buddy. You showed me how awesome kids are. You know nobody's ever gonna replace you,right? Okay. Now,I've been really busy with this one, so I haven't had time to get your birthday present, but I think this year you're old enough to pick out your own. I am? I think so. What do you think of that? Whoa.That's a lot of zeros. Yeah,don't spend it all in one place,huh? Happy birthday. Who's that? Who's that? It's jamie. I think she likes you. I grabbed you a corner piece. with extra frosting. I was wondering what our first words would be. Well,it was either that or "I think about you every day. " Yeah,I'm glad I led with the frosting. So,how's the book coming,luke? Good. Uh,I took your notes on chapter 7,but I'm still not comfortable with the ending. You'll find it when you're ready. - So. - so. I was thinking I might stop by after the party. That'd be great. Hey! Hey! There he is. So,does your party rock or what? Are you coming home? Well ... 'cause uncle lucas really misses you. We're still working on that,buddy,but,uh,thanks. Now go play with your friends. Cool! This is the best birthday ever! You talk to him? There's nothing left to say. There's always something left to say. Or I don't know. Maybe you need to just start moving past all this. I wish it was that easy. Well,maybe one day you'll wake up and life without lucas ain't that hard to face. Maybe. But until that day comes,I just want to let you know,I'm rooting for you,P.Sawyer. You talk to nathan and haley yet? Oh,well,they was getting some animal balloons made and ... you're being a wuss. Man up,dude. And if you're not gonna do it for yourself,then do it for jamie. I'm sure he misses you. Yeah.You too. It's a rabbit. Well,I was thinking a tiger might be more appropriate. I'm just getting warmed up. Very,very impressive. Excuse me. Deb. What are you doing here? Wow,deb,you look. awful. And I've barely seen a woman in five years. You're not coming in. I just want to wish my grandson a happy birthday. It'll be a lot happier when you leave. Come on,deb. Step aside. I'll find you a few pills you can pop. I said no. Is everything okay? Who's this clown? I'm bucko. Be careful,bucko. He's done time. Haven't we all? Just see that my grandson gets this,bucko. Hi. Peyton. I can't believe jamie's 5. It's crazy,right? So,how have you been? Fine. Well,not really fine. Let's just say fine. there's nothing for you to say. No,there is,okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way things turned out,and I'm sorry for the way I treated you, and I never wanted ... I just. I'm so sorry. I can't blame you,peyton. Please,do. Blame me,'cause it would make me feel better. I can'T. It's not your fault. Because I could have said "yes. I know it's a party and all, but can I talk to you guys for a second? Uh,yeah. Sure. I just want to apologize for what happened again at the wedding. Skills,it wasn't your fault. Yeah,I know,but you trusted me,and I let you guys down. Look,I know I should have went to the bathroom with jamie, and I understand why you don't want me to babysit him no more. Oh,antwon,that's not it. It's more about us than it is you. To be honest,we've ... we've been having a hard time just trusting him with anyone lately. Yeah,but you know I'd give my life for that boy. We know that. Jamie's lucky to have you. So are we. I promise. Hey,guys. Uh,jamie's chomping at the bit to open his presents. wait,wait,wait,wait,wait! Okay,go ahead. All right. Hmm,wonder what it is. Thanks,uncle lucas. How'd you know it was from me? It's a book. How boring can you get? Okay,what next? Look,daddy. It's your number. It is,huh? Jame,who gave this to you? I don't know,mama. There's no card. All right. The party turned out fantastic. Thanks for all your help. Oh,it was my pleasure. Yeah,jamie loves having his grandma around,and so do we. You have something ... - It's not what it look... - ah The less I know,the better. Add that to my list of clown nightmares. What's up,little man? You have a happy birthday? Get everything you want? Almost. Almost? That ain't good. What you wish for? Like,the coolest thing in the world. Oh,like a hot girl that likes to kiss other hot girls? No,like a wii. A wii? What's that? Never mind. Well,you still ain't opened my gift yet. It's a wii! Thank you,thank you! It's awesome! And you ain't think I knew what a wii was. I'm not that old. You want to play with me? I would love to. Come on. - Hey. - Huh? Does everyone know more about babies than me? Perks of having a little sister born when you're 18. How's it going? It's great ... when she's not hungry or tired or gassy. Except she's always hungry or tired or gassy so. I remember when lily was born,and she had this thing where she wouldn't sleep unless someone was holding her. Sounds like a lot of girls I know. You're doing great,brooke. All I can think about is her pre-op appointment with the heart surgeon. I'm freaking out. - You want me to come with you? - No. You don't have to do that. I know,but.I'd like to. Okay. Thanks. I saw you talking to your runaway bride in there. Care to give me any spoilers? Uh,you know,I think I'm gonna see how this one plays out before I go and write a book about it. There's my cue. You're doing great,too,lucas scott. Hi.Lose your key? I didn't feel right using it. You're coming home? No,luke,it's empty. I came to get the rest of my things. Oh,I just thought maybe you were coming back. Maybe you could just spend the night,you know? So we could at least talk a little. What's left to say? lindsey,I love you. I love you,too,luke,but it takes more than love to build a marriage. I'm willing to learn. Whatever it takes to make you come back. " keep the key. This is your home. I didn't know pilates was so ... sensual? Didn't know you guys were into yoga. - It's pilates. - It's pilates. I didn't know pilates was so. erotic. So,mouth,where's your girlfriend? Easy. No,I mean,seriously,where'd she go? I don't know.She said she had to run out. And her name's millicent,by the way. Hi,guys. Oh,please tell me those are for us. Milly,what's going on? Stashed throughout the room,you will find various heavy artillery. I want you all to consider your next move very carefully. Come on. Tell me again how great I'm doing. Yeah,I know how you feel,kid. I have to get these sketches done for macy's,and she just won't stop. Come on in. So,how was today? Just like every day. Well,there's always tomorrow. Peyton,are you really in love with lucas,or are you just in love with the idea of him? If I'm being honest. maybe a little bit of both. I think I miss what i thought we would be. She adores you,luke. Well,maybe she can put in a good word for me with lindsey. It's kind of strange,isn't it? Is this how you thought our lives would turn out? Yeah,with me being stood up at the altar and you taking care of a kid that's not yours? Not exactly. Do you ever want to go back? I remember being 16,and everything just seemed much easier. Would you do it differently? I'd try to appreciate the things I took for granted. But I think we have to go through all this stuff,you know, to get to the places we want to be. Yeah. Well,I should go. At least if you want to get any sleep tonight. How are the designs coming? Good.I just have a few more. Stay. And finish them. I don't mind. Really? Yeah,it's kind of nice. Yeah. Sometimes when you're young,you think nothing can hurt you. It's like being invincible. I think it's bedtime for the birthday boy. One more game.Please? Yeah,please? All right,one more game,but then it's off to bed. your whole life is ahead of you,and you have big plans. I got you. Big plans. To find your perfect match. Cover me. 1.2.3! The one that completes you. but as you get older,you realize it's not always that easy. I told you to stay away from my family. I know. Then why did you give jamie my first jersey? I was just sorting through some old stuff, and I thought your son might appreciate a piece of his father. This is for you. It's not until the end of your life that you realize how the plans you made were simply plans. You're giving me the beach house. We've had some great times here,nathan,before. before all of it. Maybe your family will,too. I don't want it. I don't want any of it. Thud Son. I have a bad heart. You're just realizing that,dad? At the end,when you're looking back instead of forward, It's my hcm, son. you want to believe that you made the most of what life gave you. I need a heart transplant. You want to believe that you're leaving something good behind. I have six months to live. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Sync: Öíâ¤ÁúÁú   </font>
