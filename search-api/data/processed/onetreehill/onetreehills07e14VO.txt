You don't have a job. Your honor... She does have a job. She works for me. How did we get the funding for the movie? My father and I put up the money, because I believe in you. All day long I've been trying to figure out How to get past the you-and-alex thing. Maybe right now, you need to work on u, And I need to work on me. Goodbye, brooke. Hey, tay. You remember... I prefer to call him my new boyfriend. Sync by fant0m www.addic7ed.com Haley, stop! Sorry. Just trying to wake taylor and david. I'm sure you did, Alonth the rest of the neighborhood. How long have you been up? Since I dreamt that my sister Was screwing my other sister's husband. Ex-husband. Did you dream that, to that'so weird. Did I kill them in yours? No, actually, you played it cool. Well, then you really were dreaming, Because there's no way to play this cool. This is the most uncool thing taylor's ever done. Morning, kids. Good morning, slut. You can get your things and go. What's wrong? Are you still mad about me and david? That's so last night. You like that outfit enough to get buried in, Or you want to go put something on? Why? It's nothing hehasn't seen before. But if you insist. Come... are you gonna say something?! "I love you"? Good morning! Oh, hey, I almost forgot. We're late for the video-game shoot. Better get going. Have a good day, hales. Love you. Bye, mom. This house is perfect for the movie. How were you able to get it for free? What can I say? I'a great producer. No, it's lucas' house. He said we could use it. How's rehearsal going with alex duprÃƒÂ©? I see she and peter are... I think it's important for a director and actor To establish boundaries early on. I know he's a little high-maintenance, But the guy's talented. Besides, the clock was ticking, And we didn't have much of a budget. Alex. Alex Dupré, this is my father, paul norris. It's nice to finally meet you, paul. Nice to meet you, too, alex. I've seen u in the trades. I've seen you in the tabloids. That was the old me. Good... I shouldn't have to tell you How important this film is to both julian and myself. You don't have to worry about her, dad. She's here to work. Yep. I'm a professional. You're certainly dressed like one. Oh, thank you. I picked it out myself since we don't have a wardrobe person. Could we get to work, please? Bye. I haven't hired a costume designer yet. Why not? The person I wanted didn't work out. Dare I ask what's in the box? You're staring at it like someone sent you a severed head. It's julian's stuff. He broke up with me last night. Oh, honey, I'm sorry, dear. A head would have been an improvement. I want to take it to him, But I just don't think I can see him right now. And I really don't want to see alex. Even if herhead were severed? Stop talking about severed heads! Okay, how abou I take care of the box? Okay? I mean, we run a multimillion-dollar company. I'm sure we can afford a courier. There's no need for unnecessary drama. Before I forget, Millicent is working with us again. Shll be in this morning. So much for our security deposit. Sorry about the mess. I'll clean it when I get back from work. I'm not worried about the place. I'm worried about you. Are you okay? Not really, but I'm trying. Have you thought about going back to rehab? Yeah, I've thought about it. Well, leme know if there's anything I can do to hp. How long are you staying? I'm not sure. Maybe...A day or two? But you'll be here when I get home? Yeah. That helps. Come on. You cannot expect me to honestly believe That thisthing between the two of you Is anything more than some sick joke. What's so sick about it? David's a great guy. Quinn couldn't see it. I can. Can't you just be happy for us? You know what would make me happy, Is throwing you out a window. But I'm gonna settle for you using the front door. That's no way to treat your sister And possible two-time brother-in-law. Good morning, haley. "Good morning." Yeah, don't "morning" me, david. You will have to forgive my sister. She's cranky this morning. Hopefully, she'll be in a better mood tonight. David and I are cooking dinner for everyone tonight. No, that's not happening! You can't... That's not happening... not tonight, not ever. Why not? Quinn already agreed to it. I'll see you tonight. David! How can you do this to quinn? It's no worse than what she did to me. I told them we spt together. What? So, now you want me to go to dinner with your ex, Who probably wants to kill me, And your sister, who's obviously insane? Yeah, it's okay. You don't have to come if you don't want to. I just... I don't get it. I know why david wants to hurt you, But why would your own sister go along with it? You have to know taylor. When we were kids, she tried stealing my boyfriends. And now she's after my ex-husband. So, I guess she never grew up. And that doesn't bother you? A little, but not nearly as much as that does. See, how cool is your dad? I mean, not now, of course, But he is gonna look great in this new video game. When do I get to play? Well, the game won't be ready for a month, But we shod be able to get you a prototype to play tonight. You look good covered in balls. Now I know how taylor feels. Hey, speaking of, I, uh... Take it you heard about this dinner tonight? Yes. I got a very angry text message from my wife. You coming? No, I, uh, think I have some work to catch up on. Quinn's okay with that? I mean, if haley's this pissed, I can't imagine how upset quinn must be. It's strange, but she seems okay. She was more upset by kylie showing up For a swim in my pool this morning. Who is kylie?! Some chick who took a whore bath in clay's pool this morning. My god, quinn, that's awful. Must just make you want to rip david's head off And punch taylor right in her fat face. You shouldn't let them get to you. How are they not getting to you? David has a right to be upset with me, And taylor'slways been a bitch. So what do you want me to do? Uh, I don't know, say no when they invite you to dinner. Clay makes me happy, haley! Why shouldn't david be happy? I mean, I can't imagine that Taylor is the one for him, But if she is, I'll deal with it. Just like that? If they want to throw their relationship in my face, I have to let them know it doesn't bother me, right? No! Not right! And let me tell you something. If nathan and I got divorced And he and taylor showed up playing kissy-face, Not only would I never see them again, Nobody else would, either. So you're saying I should kill them. I mean, it's a little extreme, don't you think? No, you're right. Having dinner with them is so much more sane. See you tonight. How you holding up today? Still upset, I see. "Clothes over psychos" Coming this fall to prisons everywhere. Hey, brooke. Alexander coyne. Millicent huxtable. Nice to meet you. Do you need help with anything? Just ask victoria... 'cause you work for her. Wow. You're a mean boss. You're like an evil disney character Who feeds her servants porridge and pays them in buttons. Lauren. Hi. What are you doing here? Hey, I just talked to antwon. He said you were back in town. Oh, looks like you had one hell of a party. I'm sorry I missed it. Yeah, I missed it, too. But, uh, at least I get to clean it. Do you want some help? Come on, we can pretend we're csi And re-create what happened. I don't think I want to know. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. First one who finds the couch wins? All right. Can chuck come over and play the new game tonight? Yeah, of course. You two are friends again? Yeah. We homies. See? Sometimes friends, they fight, They get mad at each other, but then they make up. Like mom, aunt quinn, and aunt taylor? Exactly. They're mad at each other now, But eventually it'll blow over. Hey, what's going on? Well, let's see taylor try and cook dinner With no pots and pans. You and chuck play upstairs tonight. I can't find alex. Have you seen her? Have you checked your hand? It's usually on her ass. What do you need her for, anyway? I want to put my hand on her ass. Why don't you just leave her alone and let her act? What's the point of being in a movie with alex duprÃƒÂ© If I don't get to sleep with her? The point is that she's a great actress Who wrote an amazing script. Oh, sure, but it doesn't hurt that she's gone down more times than the sun. If you see her, tell her I'm in my trailer. Brooke thought you might want your stuff back. Sorry, man. I don't appreciate you sending your boy toy To deliver my stuff. W... well, I don't appreciate The dumping you delivered to me last night, So I guess we're even. Oh, come on, brooke. You broke up with me when you left. I just had the nerve to call it what it was. And I didn't need to send an alex to do it for me. I just needed some space! Well, you got it. Hey, there. Oh. It's me, by the way... Quinn. Just in case you were wondering. I mean, you never know who's gonna stop by For a swim, right? I'm sorry about this morning, quinn. I didn't know she was coming over, And it won't happen again. Just her or all the others, too? I don't know who you think I am. I know exactly who you are. Maybe who I used to be. It's okay. It's only been a couple of months. I can't expect y to be a different person. No. But you can expect me To be the type of guy that you can count on. I'm coming with you tonight. Really? Yeah. Wow, I didn't see that one coming. You know what else you didn't see coming? What are you doing? I'm spoiling my appetite. Haley, if you're so against this dinner, Then why did you agree to it? It's a bad idea. Of course it's a bad idea. It's a terrible idea. But if quinn and taylor say I should be fine, I'm gonna be fine. You seem fine. Oh, I am. I'm gonna sit at dinner like a perfect little angel. And I'm gonna say, "oh, that's so nice, taylor." "Um, taylor, that's a really funny story." "Would you please pass the potatoes, taylor?" Only there won't be any potatoes. Hey, brooke! S'up? Hi. I was just feeling a little lost, So I thought I'd come see the most stable couple I know. The suspect started here, But he couldn't hold his liquor, So he stashed the wounded soldier And made a mad dash for the bathroom. How would you know that? Splatterattern. Looks like he projectiled from over here. That is really gross. Yeah. You can clean that up. So, are you here for good, or is this just a visit? Uh, I'm not sure. I really only left 'cause millie and I were having problems. I thought it would do me some good. You know, out of sight, out of mind. Did it work? No. She was just out of sight. I'll clean the vomit. That makes me sick! Taylor is awful! I thought alex was a bitch. Ye, I know, right? And don't worry about alex. Julian obviously still loves you. Brooke, he stayed in tree hill to make his movie. Yeah, well, heade it very clear today That he does not want to see me anymore. He is probably just upset. You guys are way too good together not to make it. Just give it some time. Okay. Fine. Don't worry about this dinner tonight. You know, it's gonna be over before you know it. Actually, nathan's betting we don't make it through dinner. He said he thinks I'm gonna attack taylor Before the salad is served. Well, can you blame him? You've been arrested more times than anyone I know, "jailey." I hate my name. Let the wild rumpus start. Thanks, hales. You'll be okay. Enjoy your last supper, judas. If you're going to act like a porn star, The least you could do is take your bloody clothes off! Oh, oh, hold on. Okay, alex, come he. We're in the middle of rehearsal here. Are you okay? No. He keeps hitting on me. And when I wouldn't say hello to his "little friend," He got mad and said I wasn't right for the part. I think he's trying to make me quit. Okay, I'll take care of it. Just do your best. Could you do me a favor, peter? I'm not big on favors. Oh. Okay, then, I'll make it an order. Take it easy on alex. Maybe you could give her some direction Instead of just yelling at her. Whatever you say, boss. Let's take it from the top. Chuck's here, buddy. So, where's this brand-new game that's not even out yet? Right here. It's really cool. We'll see. I get to be your dad. Nice to have you back, chuck. Whatever. You're not using the good silverware? Good silverware is for good people. They're lucki'm not making them eat off the floor. Are you gonna be civil tonight? Just try, haley, please. It's only one night. Look, we've weathered dan's crap for years. This should be easy. Got it! You must be quinn's boyfriend. And you must be her crazy sister. I'm not crazy. I love him. He's all I ever dream about, And I dot care if anybody else gets that. So I'm going back to him. That's awful! Just awful! Can't you do anything right? Obviously not. Cut deeper next time. How's that fodirection? When he comes to, tell him he's fired. Okay, let's get this over with. Can we say grace first? You're religious now? Well, I have been calling out God's name a lot lately. Thank you, God, for my wonderful family, For the food that we're about to receive... And for david. His chest... Strong arms... ...Home theater... Oh, she does love the home theater. Amen. Amen. Amen! Amen. How's your hand? Better than his head. Thanks for sticking up for me. You've had to do that a lot lately. I'm pretty sure nobody thinks I can do this movie. Since when do you give a crap about what anybody else thinks? It's just... ...What if I screw up? You won't. Have some faith in yourself. I do. I won't let you down. I know. What was I saying? You said, "watch this." So, uh, I think we're all curious. How exactly did you two get together? Glad you asked. It was just another boring d at the gym When who should accidentally Walk into my stripper aerobics class? David. Quinny's got herself a smart one. Yes. David. He was so embarrassed to leave, He stayed the entire class. And it was quite a workout. I gave him a private session later that night. And the rest, as they say, is sex. I'm really happy you two found each other. Okay, if nobody else is gonna say it, then I will. Please don't, haley. Taylor, at any point, did it occur to you, "hooking up with my sister's ex-husband... That might be kind of insensitive...And whorish"?! Funny, no. David, you and quinn just got divorced. How can you sleep with someone else so soon? Especially our sister! Oh, you want to talk about insensitive and horish? Quinn had sex with this bozo when we were still married What? Actually, uh... We've never had sex. I just told you that we did. Yes, nate, I would love another beer. Good idea. Boy, can you clear a room. David. How could you lie to me about something like that? Becausyou weren't letting go! Okay, I needed you to move on, And I thought the only way you'd do it is if you hated me. Well, mission accomplished. I do hate you. David, listen to me. You know what? And say what you want about taylor. At least she's been honest with me. I thought contract negotiations were tense? It is insane in that room. And david's bigger than I remember. So you really haven't slept with her? Shut up, man. I like her. I can tell. You came here instead of hiding out somewhere. Yeah, I thought I owed her that much, Especially after the whole kylie thing. Hey, I don't suppose that we could just Hide in here for a while and not go back? Probably not. Anyway, you're the one that added "falling insanely in love with quinn" to my contract. Probably should have added sex to that, too, huh? Why did you send alexander to drop off julian's stuff? He's really upset! What happened "no need for unnecessary drama"? Yeah, well, that drama was very necessary, dear. I needed to show you that he still had feelings for you. Whatever you do with that information is up to you. Mother! All right, enough said. I'll keep out of it. Now, onto other business. Millicent... you're shutting her out. What do you care? Well, I've never been a fan of millicent's, But she was always there for you. She believed in you when your own mother didn't. And now she needs someone to believe in her. More important, she needs a friend. No, she doesn't. She has you. I am not the friend type. Now I know whoy reminds me of. Who was that guy that you dated freshman year? Dan thomson? Whatever happened to him? You told him you'd sleep with him if he broke up with So he did... And then yo did. That's right. I'm the sister who actually sleeps with guys. Do they give you a medal for that or just a shot? We have cupcakes for desse, In case anybody wants them. I bought them for jamie, but taylor doesn't seem to have a problem Taking other people's stuff. I wish I could be like you, haley. Just eat whatever I want and get fat. Your lip is about to get fat! All right, that's enough. I can't take this anymore. If anybody needs me, I'll be upstairs with the kids, Having a more mature conversation. Your dad sucks! Excuse me? Chuck says your character isn't that good. I said he sucks. And he hasn't even made one basket yet. Well, I'm sure my character is fine. Why am I crying? Because you got dunked on three times, And then a fan threw a soda at you. I thought you were supposed to be good. I was. I am. Give me this. I heard you fired peter. Yeah, I haven't had a great day. I also heard you knocked him out. His day was worse. You seem to be moving backwards as a producer. We start filming in a week. You have no costume designer. You knocked out my director. In fact, all you do have Is an unreliable, uninsurable actress. We've both invested a lot of money in this movie. Find a way to fix it. Hey, why couldn't I do that? I guess only a scott can play a scott. Come on come on, come on! Boom! Game! Eat that, chuck! Who sucks now, huh? You do. When you're, um, done with your "mature conversation," Can I talk to you for a second? Will you talk to david? Will you help him realize that what he's doing is wrong? Please, please. Okay, yes. I'll be right down. Okay. I'll be down in a sec. All right, guys. I got to head back down. Everyone still fighting? Afraid so. Dude, your family's lame. Hey, you. I shouldn't have lied to david. Quinn, don't beat yourself up. Look, I think everyone has done things in their past That they regret. I know I have... He said about kylie. Yeah, it just makes it hard When our pasts are swimming in our pools And cooking us dinner. I know. What's up? What? What's so funny? Just tell me you know how messed up this is. I was just trying to show quinn... Yes, it's messed up. Okay. That's all I wanted to hear. So you're not mad? Well, I can't say I totally support what you're doing, But, um, I also didn't like The way quinn handled things, so... Thanks. But I got to say that you are handling this Way better than I would have. It helps that you're here with me. Thank you. I'm happy to be here. But I'm also happy to leave. I'm just saying... Yeah. Anytime. So, are you really into taylor, Or was this all just to get back at quinn? We're actually having fun together. She's the first person that's made me smile in... Longer than I can remember. Well...That's good. Just make sure you like her for the right reasons And not because she reminds you of her sister. So we're cool? Yeah. But if haley asks, I yelled at you, and you're sorry. I am. Okay. The place looks great. Thank you. Yeah, just don't ever Look under the third cushion. There are bad things under there! How lame is it that I actually had fun cleaning? Can you tell how starved for company I've been? I know how you feel. I don't know anyone in l.A. Besides skills, And I barely see him 'cause he's so busy. Yeah. Being alone sucks. Skills misses you. You know that, right? I know. It's just... Being alone sucks. Yeah. Sorry about this morning. I'm sorry, too. I should have brought the box to you myself. But I just thought it would be too hard to see you. That makes what I want to ask difficult. The movie shoots in a week, And we don't have a stume designer. And the reason we don't Is because I was planning on asking you when you got back... Which is why I'm asking you now. We just broke up. I know. Good timing, huh? But you're the only one I trust, And I need the best for this movie. I would love to help you, But I don't know if I can do that. Just think about it. Okay? You... you don't even have to look at me If you don't want to. Okay, I'll...Tnk about it. Thanks. Haley. I'm sorry. We were wrong to come here. Thank you. That means a lot, david. Don't apologize. We haven't done anything wrong. You know, maybe david hasn't, But you have been a problem your whole life, taylor. When haley got her first period, You tried to convince her that she was dying! You told crazy uncle frank that I... That I had a crush on him? Oh, in high school, you had sex in mom's car And then told her it was me. Well, to be fair, it was with your ex-boyfriend. And now you're sleeping with david! Why are you getting so mad at me About going after quinn's leftovers? You went after mine. I want you to admit That what you're doing is wrong! No! Say you're happy for me! Taylor, I'm so sick of You're such a bitch to everyone your whole life! Haley! Taylor! Give us your blessing, haley! Dude, I take it back. Your family's cool! I got five bucks on my mom. Oh, yeah! You lucky, If nathan hadn't stopped the fight, I'd ve one less christmas card to send. Oh, no. You mean I wouldn't get another christmas card If Jamie dressed hasn't out whatever would I do? Enough already! Just stop! Just stop, please! Did you get what you wanted? Are you satisfied now? Nightly. Just promise me you won't hurt david. Like you did? Yeah. He's been through enough. He doesn't need you pretending to like him Just to get back at me. Who's pretending? I do like him. Fine. Fine. "Fine." "Fine." No. No! It's not fine!It's not fin! What is wrong with you two?! I'm happy. Quinn's happy. What do you want, haley? I want you to admit that you're a bitch! That's fair. Fine. I'm a bitch. Fine. What's going on? I t know, but they're not trying To kill each other anymore, so... That's good, right? If those three can work through their differences, Then maybe... Not a chance. Millie. You holding up okay? I'm getting there. Marvin came back last night. That's great. It must be hard to see him After everything that's happened. It is. But it was harder not seeing him. Millie? Can you help me with this? Sure. Thanks. You leaving? I never should have come. I'm sorry I lied to you. I did it 'cause I wanted you to be happy. Are you happy? I'm getting there. You happy? I am. David. This is yours. Just maybe don't give it to taylor. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll be okay. You didn't have to do all this. You shouldn't be living this way. So, are you leaving soon? No, I think I'm gonna st for a while. Really? Why? Because you shouldn't be alone. You really think I'm the best. Of course you are. Soet me get this straight. I'm better than everybody else on the planet Who could possibly do this job? That's right. Well, I guess if I am the best And you need the best... Then I have to do it. It wouldn't be fair otherwise. When do I start? As soon as I find a dictor. You don't have a director? Did you hire anyone for this movie? The last guy didn't work out. What a shame. Too bad you don't know anyone who's... Always wanted to direct... Who knows the movie really well. I'm thinking someone whose name rhymes with "shmulian"? You know anyone like that? I don't think my dad would go for that. You know, I've never directed before. Make him go for it. Tell him you hired the best costume designer on the planet, And she'll only work with you if you direct. Because, p.S., that's now the deal. Have your people call my people. Another blast from your past? Ah, I had the locks changed today. Thanks for sticking with me through dinner. I know it was a pretty miserable time. I kind of actually enjoyed it. Keys to your house, sir. Thank you very much. Now you will be the only person with a key to my house. You and the maid, that is. You didn't have to do this. Yeah, I know, but I wanted to do something To show you how important you are to me. I know I've said it, But this way, you have proof in case you ever forget. I was just lucky I was able to find a locksmith On such short notice. You're about to get even luckier. Finally. Can we tell everyone at the next dinner? Come on. Thank you, jessica. I made a list of directors Who won't mind working with a suicidal actress And a psychotic producer for minimal pay. I want to direct. I know this movi I know how to deal with alex, And I got you to keep me on track. What do you think? You were at the top of t list. We have less than a week before we ro. Better get to work. Yes, sir. I cannot wait to get into bed And forget about this awful, awful day. Why? It was a good day. What was good about it? Well, of all the crazy drama today, None of it was ours. There were no psycho women stalking me or my family. There were no contract problems. There was no dan. I'd take a million days like today. Yeah, I guess you're right. It was a good day. Your... Your family's crazy.
