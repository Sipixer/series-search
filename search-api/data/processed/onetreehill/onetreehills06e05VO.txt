Lucas and i set a date this morning, So i have to ask you a really big favor. Okay. If it's about money, it's probably not the best time. Oh, god, stop it! I need a dress! And if it helps, i promise to pay full price. Is my best friend down? Sure. Do you want the lindsey strauss tear-Away train? It's what all the runaway brides Are gonna be wearing this season.

I can do that. Wow. Who peed in your cheerios? I just had a thing with victoria. I don't mean to take it out on you. For the record, it is very nice to see you so happy. Thank you.

You are so musically challenged. I guarantee you, you have like 30 songs on your ipod That he's played on. And...he knew ellie. So it's like this window into a world That i've never gotten to see. I mean, you cannot imagine what it's like to finally find out What your mother was like when she was young. Maybe a little. Brooke, what happened with victoria? Nothing. It's not important. I'm fine. Let's get to work on the dress, huh? [ Telephone rings ] Scott residence. Yeah, this is him. Yes, sir. Uh, yes, sir. I could be there today, if you want. Absolutely.

You didn't give me a chance to pay. [ Laughs ] I didn't give you a chance to pay? When exactly were you planning on paying me? Was it after you assaulted me and called me a bitch</i> Or maybe after you ran your thieving little street-Urchin ass down the block? [ Bells jingle, door opens ] Um, excuse me. Can i help you? Man: yeah, you can. I got a work order here To box up all your remaining store inventory For shipment to new york. What? Says who? Victoria davis. Swell. It's your lucky day.

Uh, close. It's a -- It's an aristocrat. Imagine if that guitar could talk, the stories it would tell. [ Chuckles ] oh, i don't know. This baby's been around some pretty crazy stuff. It's probably best that she doesn't speak. [ Laughs ] Was it around when my dad fell in love with ellie? Yeah. It was. So, what, was it, like, love at first sight or what? Pretty much. I mean, they met on tour, and... I don't remember which one it was, But i remember that she fell for your dad instantly. What about him? Did he like her right away? Well...you know, they tried to play it cool, Like it wasn't a big deal. But it was. I mean, everybody knew that they were just meant to be together. Um, i should probably let you get back to work, huh? Yeah. Right. [ Clears throat ] I'm just gonna be right out here if you need anything. Right.

The owners have spared no expense. [ Chuckles softly ] i see that, sir. It's just "bobby." Just "bobby." Come on. Let me show you around. Make no mistake. We want to win here. We've got some good players on our squad, Some of whom you'll meet today. I know that with the right coaching,??? And all that begins right here.

[ Groans ] [ Normal voice ] so, what would it like for its last meal?</i> Haley? You okay? Um... Nathan was right all along. Dan...really has gone off to die. What do you mean? I just got a phone call from his hospice nurse. She thinks it's only a matter of hours now. I'm so sorry, deb. Oh. Oh, please. It's just... [ Sighs ] it doesn't sound like dan. What do you mean? Well, i would have expected a little more grandstanding, That's all. Well, she says he's asking for jamie. Thinks i should bring him by. Do you think jamie should see him like that? I don't know. After everything he's been through with quentin And now seeing dan's gravestone, I promised him he could see his grandfather. So, what are you gonna do? [ Sighs ] I don't know. Oh, i wish nathan were here. You're here. Hey. So, how was your flight? You ready for today? Yeah, um... it -- It was fine. Listen, there's something i really need to talk to you about. It's important. And i probably should have talked to you about it a while ago, but -- Look, i don't want this to be awkward for either of us, All right? We have to work together, So let's not do the heavy emotional thing. I'll be okay if you're okay. Okay? [ Chuckles softly ] Wait till you see what we have planned for you today. It's gonna be great. Starting with this. [ Chuckles softly ] So, what do you think? I think it looks amazing. * ...running down my face * So, these are your all-Time favorites? Um, some of them. Some of them just look really cool.</i> Hmm. Okay, five albums... Five that you couldn't live without If you were stranded on a desert island. Really? Show me a person's favorite records, And i'll tell you everything you need to know about them. Okay. Fine. But you're gonna have to write yours down, too. Okay. It's a deal. I caught a young girl shoplifting the other day. I was pretty hard on her. Did you feel threatened by her? No. No, i actually felt myself feeling jealous. Jealous? I realize i let the company matter too much. You know, we spend all this time building something up, And then we don't enjoy it. We just sit there, Terrified that someone's gonna take it away from us. And she didn't answer to anything or anyone. And... that made me jealous. What are you going to do about that, With regards to your company? Well, it doesn't matter. I don't have to worry about clothes over bros anymore. And why's that? I gave it all away. I signed the company over to victoria. Do you regret that? * away * * away * So, you liking what you're seeing so far? [ Chuckles ] are you kidding me? It's great. I got to say, this came out of nowhere. I'm really, really grateful you called. No, no. Pleasure's all mine. I got to tell you, i've had my eye on you for a while. I watched you win those two championships at gilmore. I saw you play at maryland. Well, thank you, but i'm more interested in the future. Good. I'm glad to hear you say that. 'Cause we could really use a good, young coach like you. Y-You want me to coach? No, no. I thought you wanted me to play.</i> Well, nathan, your playing days are over. Come on. You must know that. [ Scoffs ] * away * All right, number three --??? Oh, that is so predictable. "Physical graffiti." Whoa! Whoa! That's cheating. That's like two albums, really.</i> Okay, fine. Number two -- "Nevermind," And not just because you played on it. "Exile on main street," And that "nevermind" thing is a rumor. Supposedly. Okay, so that leaves number one. What do you got? Oh, that's easy. It is the first record i ever bought -- Elvis costello, "my aim is true." What? [ Both laugh ] Hey, why do you think, in all this time, My dad has never reached out to me? I'm not sure i can answer that -- At least not in a way that's gonna make you happy. Why'd they give me up? Peyton, we, um... I-I mean, all of us were really screwed up then. You know, ellie never planned for you, And you got to understand That it just never would have worked. Hey, i was wondering, um... If maybe you wanted to come by tonight. 'Cause, hopefully, lucas will get home early, And i know he would really like to meet you. And i just... [ sighs ] I was hoping you could tell me all about my parents. I want to know about my dad. Be careful what you wish for. Please. Okay. Be there. * and only the heartaches have given me sight * Hey, it's nate. Leave it. [ Beep ]</i> Nathan, hi, i'm really sorry to bug you up there, But, uh...it's about dan. I need to talk to you. I got a phone call from his hospice nurse this morning, And it's not good. You should call me. I love you. Bye. [ Telephone beeps ] What's a hospice? Is something wrong with grandpa? You said he was okay. I did. I know i did. Um... It turns out grandpa's really sick. But he's gonna get better, right? [ Sighs ] come here. [ Sighs ] Sometimes people get so sick That they can't get better. Is he gonna die, like quentin? [ Sighs ] Yeah. Yeah, i'm afraid so, buddy. I didn't get to say goodbye to quentin. Do i get to say goodbye to grandpa? [ Inhales, exhales deeply ] Yes. Yes, let's do that. Come here. Look, i apologize if we got our lines crossed here. I just thought that you understood I was interested in you for the coaching position. And i-I appreciate it. I'm flattered, okay? I really am. But i'm not ready for that yet. I can still play. Nathan, that was no small injury you suffered. It was spinal-Cord, right? Yeah. Yeah, it was lower-Back. Well, most guys wouldn't even be thinking about coming back.</i> They'd just be thinking about walking right. I'm not most guys. And i can appreciate that. Look, i've been rehabbing, okay? I'm in shape. I can play. You just have to let me show you. I have the utmost respect for you wanting to play again. You're a warrior. You always have been. But i'm looking for a coach. Now, i've always valued how smart a player you were. And i know that you've been coaching. Nathan, this is where your future is. All right. [ Cellphone beeps ] I hope that you will think about it. I know that you will be a great asset here, Very popular, and great for attendance. I know you'd do a good job. * i wrote myself a letter * * wrapped it up in plastic * * put it in a hole... * [ Cellphone ringing ] Hello? I know you're in the middle of it. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Kind of a break in the action right now. What's up? Peyton? Um, nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice. Peyton, what's going on? It's mick. He's my father. Wait. He said that? I mean, he told you?</i> No, no, not yet. Um, but that's what tonight's about. He's coming over for dinner. But you're sure he's your dad? Yeah, he slipped up, and i just -- I know. I mean, i-I honestly think i've known since the minute we met. But... he's my father, luke. It's gonna be okay, peyton. You think so? [ Laughs ] 'cause i'm kind of nervous. You're gonna do great. I just wish i was there. Luke, they're ready for us. Hey, i'm sorry, but they need me. Um, i'll call you as soon as i get out, okay? Okay. Luke? Yeah? I always feel better when i get to talk to you. I love you. Thanks. [ Chuckles softly ] Love you too. Bye. [ Cellphone beeps ] So, there you have it, lucas. You'll have signings in all the major markets. We're looking at a major ad buy in print and radio. And we're working on all the regional and national talk shows. That sounds great. All that's left to discuss is the schedule. We want you to start strong, so omaha's up first on the 24th. Your first book sold very well there. Next -- Um, excuse me. I have a problem with the chicago date. We -- The schedule's pretty firm at this point. Yeah, i'm -- I'm sorry, but i can't. Lucas, chicago's our second-Biggest market. A change is gonna cost a lot of money. I understand but i need to change okay? Luke, can i see you in my office for a second? Lucas, what are you doing? This book launch is a really big deal. I know that. I just -- You know they didn't even want to do a book tour? They didn't.</i> But i made them because i believe in you and i fight for you. I appreciate it. What could possibly be more important than chicago? My wedding. [ Sighs ] It's peyton. We're getting married. [ Chuckles softly ] And that's why i can't go to chicago. I see. I wanted to tell you, okay? But... Then why didn't you? I just... I'll talk to them about chicago. Lindsey. * there's someone like me * I guess i was right all along about you and peyton. But i wish you could have done this over the phone. * there's someone like me * So, do you think i was foolish to give my company to my mother? Do you think you were foolish?</i> Do you always swer a question with another question? Does it bother you? In my humble opinion, It was never truly going to be your company As long as she was part of it. Yeah. After i did it, i felt great. At first, i felt liberated, But now i just... I feel kind of empty. Everything that i worked for is gone. I just have this store. And even that's empty now. That freedom you were jealous of can be scary sometimes. Have you talked to anyone else about this? No. I saw my best friend today, And i couldn't bring myself to tell her. Why do you think that was? I don't know. * you're hiding out so painfully * I feel a little... A little bit like i failed. You know? I'm watching all my friends move on with their lives -- Haley and her family, And millicent is moving to be with mouth, And peyton with lucas -- And they're all moving forward. And it's like i am stuck here, standing still, and... Brooke, you're 22 years old and the founder Of a multi-Million-Dollar corporation. I'd hardly call that standing still. But it's gone. You'll do something else. You're intelligent, you're creative. You'll figure it out. Right. But what if i don't figure it out?</i> You will. But that's not the real question. Then what is? All you've talked about is your work, brooke. But when you mention your friends being happy, You define that happiness Strictly in terms of relationships and family. The question is, Why are you so insistent going through life alone? * every day, we try to find * * we search our hearts and our minds * * the place we used to call our home * So, what do you think? [ Chuckles softly ] I don't know. Listen, letting go of playing is hard. It was for all of us. But it doesn't mean you have to let go of basketball. I have to talk to my family about it. You do that. I'll stall for a few days and wait to hear back from you. [ Sighs ] [ Elvis costello's "alison" plays ] [ Sighs ] Okay, dad. I'm waiting. * oh, it's so funny * * to be seeing you after so long, girl * * and with the way you look * * i understand that you are not impressed * * but i heard you let that little friend of mine * * take off your party dress * I never meant to hurt you. Not then... and not now. I know. The thing is, i saw it coming all along. I just tried to wish it away. It wasn't fair to me or to you.</i> * i only know it isn't mine * Chicago will be fine. I'll make it okay. Thank you. Well, i should go. I'm gonna miss my flight. Okay. [ Sighs ] All right. Lucas. You forgot something. [ Sighs ] * my aim is true * Lindsey -- It's okay. You know, the first time we met -- Right here -- I told you i was pulling for the couple in the book. * my aim is true * Goodbye, lucas. * my aim is true * * my aim is true * * my aim is true * It's not too late, you know. Too late for what? To stop all this. Mm. I'm afraid i can't do that. Yes, you can. Please. I'm begging you. "Please"? [ Chuckles softly ] Where's the big scary guy from the motel, dan? The guy who was gonna kill me? I guess you're not so tough when the shoe's on the other foot. You touch one hair on jamie's head, And you'll get to meet him. You crazy bitch! Aaah! No! Aah! Looks like someone needs a little something To make sure they're on their best behavior. Aah! Gah! Ohh. No. [ Panting ] No. [ Dog barks in distance ] No. No. Well, well. Look who's here. [ Parking brake engages ] Okay, pal. I need you to stay in the car. I'll be right back. I just want to make sure we're in the right place. I want to come with you. Just stay in the car. Keep the doors locked. I'll be right back. I promise. Okay. [ Car alarm chirps ] Dan? Dan? Oh, god, dan. Dan, it's haley! Wake up! Haley? Help. I have jamie with me. Get jamie. Dan, what is going on?

Open up. No! Mama says you're a bad person! Oh, that's not true. I love you. Remember? Now, open the door, buddy. No! I want my mama! I am your mama now! Now, unlock that door this instant! No! Looks like somebody needs to learn some manners. Jamie! Dan: haley. Haley, you have to get up. Haley. Wake up. Haley. You have to wake up. Jamie! Jamie! I'm sorry i got mad, sweetie! Just tell me where you are, jimmy-Jam. I won't be mad anymore. I promise. [ Singsong voice ] i've got something special for you. [ Cornstalks rustling ] Ohh! [ Breathing heavily ] Shhhhh. It's mama. Shh. [ Cellphone beeps ] one message.</i> Haley: i'm really sorry to bug you up there, nathan.</i> I just -- I really need to talk with you.</i> It's not good. You should call me, okay?</i> I love you. Bye. [ Cellphone beeps ] It's gonna be okay. I promise. We just have to get you out of here, okay? Okay. [ Cellphone rings ] [ Sps ] Run! ?Ccarrie: jamie! Jamie! Run, jamie! Run! Run! Guess there's more than one crazy nanny in this town. Bitch. [ Ryan adams' "if i am a stranger" plays ] Are you okay? * for all the hours here that move too slow * * there's all this letting go * * that won't pass * [ Horns blaring ] * if all this love is real, how will we know? * * and if we're only scared of losing it * * how will we last? * How's jamie? He's -- He's scared to death. He's gonna be okay. How are you? This was a 1995 dom pérignon ros? I was saving it for the day i was rid of dan scott for good. Laughs ] A girl can dream, right? You saved us. How did you know? How did you know that we were here? I knew something was up when i saw the address. Dan always hated the woods. Aaaaah! [ Gunshot ] God, i hate the woods. * i will try and be there for you * * if i can * * but what if i can't? * Are you okay? [ Clears throat ] I'm fine. Excuse me. Uh, just the check, please.

[ Laughs evilly ] I already called the police. They're on their way. So? What are they gonna do? I'll get out, and i'll come back. [ Laughs evilly ] Do you remember what i told you i'd do If you ever came near my family again? I told you i'd kill you. But you didn't. I'm not dead. Sure you are.
