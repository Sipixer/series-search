Let me get you some water. Millicent. They're giving me a baby. There's something missing up on the wall. There used to be another one. What was it? That was your grandfather's jersey. Grandpa dan? Why'd they take it down? Because of the bad things he did. People decided they didn't want it up there anymore. You do bad things sometimes, daddy, And yours is still up there. Not that bad. Quentin: ho, ho! There he is! * i said it's j.

There are perks to having a very famous designer as a roommate. You get tons of free stuff. Speaking of, check out all these demos. Wow. Looks like things are picking up, huh?

That's really great! She -- She's really the kind of girl that deserves it, you know? I know. Now i just need to find another one. Well, i already did -- You.

Actually, that was just to butter you up, 'Cause i really need to ask you for a favor. You are a crack-Up. What is it? Anything. So, you know how you're looking for the next great artist And you really trust my instincts and everyth Do you have a demo for me? I do. Haley, that's awesome. Who is it? Haley james scott. Yes. Look, man, the doc says it's gonna be a little swollen from time to time. Why y'all sweatin' it so hard? Because we're 4-8. Maybe that's 'cause of the coaching. Easy. Look, i'm just sayin. Man One of them disappeared for a month. The other one can't be trusted. All right. I want you to palm these. Please. [ Chuckles ] There. You happy? Not quite. Palm the balls... And hold them there. For how long? I don't know. 30 seconds? Shouldn'shbe a problem, right? I do this, and all this nonsense goes away 30 seconds. You see, the thing is, "q," It's not so much that we're 4-8. We're 4-8, and you shooting like trash. Yeah, that's 'cause they doubling me, man. Dole-Teams never bothered you before. See, you're one of the best shooters i've ever seen, "q," When you're healthy. The other ones -- Well, they're right here in the gym. Even me, uncle lucas? Especially you, jamie. See, you and quentin are the best shooters we got. When you're healthy. Nothing like a second opinion. And this time, we'll come with you. Go. I have news, boyfriend. I might be getting a promotion and staying in tree hill! I might be getting a promotion and leaving tree hill. What? Why? Before i got the job with the local stati I sent audition tapes everywhere. There's a good station in omaha, And they saw the ravens feature i did, and... They offer me a job In nebraska? Yeah. The nearest clothes over bro's location to omaha is this one. Yeah, i figured. Well, is it really that much better than where you're at, marvin? I mean, like you said, you've already done one feature here. Maybe you'll get to do more. Maybe, but it was really just 'cause they were in a bind. This w be a full-Time on-Air position. It's a small market, but it's a great opportunity. You should take it. But -- If it gets yloser to your dream, then you should take it. I don't think it's that easy. Why not? Because you're part of my dream, too. Milly, i know we just started out, but i love being with you, And i... I guess i was hoping we had a future...together. Was that too early? Did i freak you out? I freaked you out, didn't i? No. No, no, no, no. There is no way those words could have been too early -- Not coming from you. Just promise me that if you do take the job That i can have your room, because i'd really like to find a place to stay That's not pay-By-The-Day. What? I know it's really rough, but i was thinking -- Yes. But it's okay if you want -- Will you stop? The answer is yes, okay? I've been waiting for the opportunity to go out and buy the next haley james record, So of course i want to record it. It might be kind of fun, huh? Well, you did have a major-Label debut that did pretty good, So it is good business for me, but, yes, it's gonna be a blast. Yeah. What do you say? I say it's exactly what i need right now. Well, guess what. Me What? I mean, you never know where the next miracle's gonna come from. It's brooke. Oh. Hey, brooke! Hey, what's going on? Brooke: it's a miracle! Uh, yeah. We just said that. What, did you bug my office? They're giving me a baby! Um...hold on. Wait. What? What? The lady from the agency called this morning, And they're sending me -- A purple monkey? You're adopting a purple monkey? No, not adopting and not nkey. I'll explain it all later. Peyton, how crazy is this? No, brooke, honey, that's awesome. God, haley and i thought we had big news. Why? What's your news? We're gonna make an album together. Oh, whatever. I'm getting a baby. I have to go. I'll call you later. Excuse me. Wow. Today's kind of fun. Listen, "q," i know it looks grim, But, hey, we'll have that thing off by the playoffs. Playoffs? Man, we 4-8. Hey, we're gonna figure it out. All right? Just, uh, hang in there. Yeah, i'd like to speak to coach taylor, If you don't mind... Alone. We'll be downstairs. "Q," keep your head up, all right? Listen, kid -- Thanks for nothing, man. I trusted you, all right? I put my ass on the line for you every single night, man. Quentin, you needed this. I needed this?! I -- You know, i needed a scholarship. I needed you to keep your mouth shut. That's what i needed. But you went all uncle tom on me as soon as massa lucas got back, huh? You know what? When your wrist heals erything's okay, I'm gonna let you take that back. But for now... Just consider yourself lucky. Hi, grandpa. Hi, jamie. You boys want to jump me again, now's your chance. Hey. We'rnot ha ving this. Not having what, son? You following jamie around. I've seen you, okay, outside of the school. I've seen you driving past the house. And now you just happen to be at the hospital? Nathan, stop. I was in prison for a long time, okay? I was just getting a checkup. But the truth is, i was hoping -- No, don't, dan. Don't hope. You hear me? There's no hope for you. I guess i just don't understand. Grandpa dan seems nice. How come everyone's always mad at him? You love chester, don't you? Well, what if grandpa dan hurt chester And took him away so you could never see him again? I guess i would be really mad at him... And sad, too. Yeah. Well, that's how we feel. I just think that's kind of an awful thing to say. Yes, i'm mad. Oh, you don't think i should be mad?</i> I thought i was just gonna have one baby in my life, but fine. I have to go. Holy cow! Stupid owen. A little baby talk, and he totally freaks out. Well, nothing like foisting a baby on a guy you've almost kissed. And a confirmed bachelor, at that. Whaty? Whatever. He's gonna come over later, And we're gonna talk about it or fight about it, But it doesn't matter Because baby and brooke are gonna be fine. Yeah, i think "baby and brooke" needs a little explanation -- Like who, when, and how, for starters. Okay. So, the adoption agency has this program Where babies from other countries who need major surgeries and stuff come over to the u.S. And doctors donate their time to fix them up And then they go home. Oh. That's great! It's kind of a "whenever they can squeeze you in" sort of thing, And the agency had a family at was supposed to host the baby Drop out, so they said this could be a great trial run for me. When does the baby show up? Is it a boy or a girl? And are his parents coming, too? Okay. She's a girl, and she gets here tomorrow. Her parents don't come with her, And they didn't tell me what's wrong with her. They're just sort of gonna hand her over, And we go from there. And check it out. I got her... A purple monkey like the one i used to have. That's so cute! And did you get her anything else? Yeah, i got all this stuff. I mean, like, you know...food... Or, i mean, a crib. ...and stuff. I got a little sidetracked? Okay. Why don't we go to my house And we'll go through some of jamie's old things? Really? Yes. Come on, you purple monkey. I'm so excited! Me too. Hey, what you doin'? Looking for places to live. Well, stop, because i've found you a place. With me. I passed on the omaha job. Marvin... I feel like i'm good at what i do, millicent, And i'll just work hard and Hope the station gives me another shot. Are you sure? That i'm doing the right thing? I don't know. But about us? Yeah. I'm sure. I don't want to leave you, millicent. But you said you needed a place to stay, And i thought... you should move in with me. But...i can't. I mean... Look, i know it's soon, but you'll save a fortune on rent, And you'll get to see me every day. I mean, what do you say? I'd like to, but i just can't. Sorry. But i'm really glad you're staying. Haley, thank you. This is great. Sure. Listen, have you given any thought to how difficult it's gonna be to give this baby up After the surgery? You know you got to fought for her brooke I know. But she needs help, right? Yeah. Nathan: hey. What's going on? Hi. Hi, aunt brooke! Hi, best boy ever! I have a surprise for you. What is it? Hey. I found the car seat. Surprise. It must have been good to spend time with your mom and lily and andy. Yeah. I think we all needed it. Plus, the view wasn't too bad, either. Yeah, i'm sure it was beautiful. So, uh, you and haley are gonna make a record, huh? That's great. Actually, i was meaning to ask you -- I mean, it's totally cool if you say no, But, um, i was thinking, to cut down on studicosts, Maybe i would build a small studio in the office. But it's your space, so... I think that's a great idea. I mean, i'll ask my mom, but, yeah, i think it's smart. I don't blame you, peyton. Luke... at all for any of it. I feel bad for you, i feel bad for lindsey, And i feel responsible somehow. And i really hope that doesn't come off as arrogant, okay? But i know this hurt you. She's coming back, peyton. She loves me. And i love her. It's gonna be okay. I hope so. It's open. That kid's a lot hairier than i thought he'd be. Very funny. And "he" is gonna be a "she." I guess you talked to owen. Yep. How you doin'? Okay. A little freak out but okay. Is he with you? No. Weird. He's coming over soon. Actually, he's not. That's kind of why i'm here. Oh. Okay. You know, brooke, owen's my friend, And i know he's really into you, but... He's just kind of always been about his independence, too, you know? I guess i didn't know. He's just a little thrttd with all the baby stuff. Yeah, he said that on the phone. Look, did he send you over here to talk to me? Are we in junior high now? He didn't send me over, And he's not coming by either. Then why did you? Well... I'm taking off. I thought i'd say goodbye and congratulations. And maybe i want to see your face one more time. Probably why owen's not coming by. What is that supposed to mean? Well, he probably figures If he looked in those eyes one more time, He'll cave on the whole independence thing. Anyways, call me if you need anything... Someone to talk to, new carpets... I don't know, a husband... I'll see you around. Hey, brooke? Don't take the owen stuff too personally. I won't. Yeah, you will. I know how you are. It's -- It's just a big deal. It's kids. I mean, i know it's just one, But if you really want a family, something that's like forever... "Forever" scares a lot of us. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Can i talk to you? Sure. Come on in. What's, uh -- What's wrong? Um, maybe nothing... i hope. Okay, just have a seat. What's up? Well, i think i'll stand. Actually, do you have something to drink -- Some water or an apple martini with a cherry, if you have it? Okay, you're kind of freaking me out. The last time someone entered the apartment like this, It was skills, and he thought he'd killed chester. Jamie's bunny? Yeah, but it turns out he was just, like, a really heavy sleeper, apparently. Well, it's not that. It's just i know i sort of freaked you out When you asked me to stay here, and, well, there's a reason. Great. I knew it. What? I figured this was just too good to be true. There's just a reason we can't sleep in the same bed. Oh, no. What? This is like "the crying game," right? Marvin! Hairy back? Marvin. Well, it's either that or you're completely repulsed by me. I'm a virgin. Really? Yes. And considering your last gross boss-Lady hookup, You're clearly not, and i am just not ready to -- How did i find you? What? Such a perfect girl who's smart and sweet and... So awesome. Go on. Milly, i would never pressure you about sex. I just -- I want to be with you. But -- I mean, we could even get two beds, if you want... Although, if i catch you sneaking into mine, I'm telling skills. I am so into you, and... I want you here. Will you say yes? Okay. Yes. If you think it can work. It can. It does. So, i see you know cpr, And you're also a lifeguard. Yes. Have you ever kissed any of the husbands you worked for? Okay, uh... No. Well... Sorry. So, nathan... haley tells me you like to watch your nanny swim naked in the pool? I guess i deserved that. Hey, brooke. You okay? I think i made a big mistake. I think it's a little late for that, isn't it? If i wanted a "little late for that," I would have called peyton. You are supposed to say, "no, you didn't. You're gonna be fine." No, you didn't. You're gonna be fine. It doesn't count now. So, you got a purple monkey, huh? Just like you had. You remember that? Of course. I do know some things about you, brooke davis. You're gonna be a great mom. I'm not even gonna be a mom. I just fix her up, and then i have to send her back. Well, if you didn't do it, who would? Owen thinks i'm being selfish. He thinks i just want what i want. Well, i'd say it's the opposite. Right? I think it's great that you're willing to help  little girl get the care that she needs And get to the rest of her life. So do i. But what if i do something wrong, luke? What if i hurt her? What if i break her? I mean, i rushed into this, and i'm scared. You know what? When it comes to single moms, I had a pretty special one. And it's good that you're a little scared. But you're gonna do great. Thanks. Thanks for coming over. You think she'll like the purple money? I think that she's gonna love the girl who gives it to her. Yeah. Jamie's out cold. I wish i could sleep like that. Yeah, tell me about it. So, i'm sorry you couldn't find a nanny that you could trust around me. Too soon The truth is, i just want ja all to myself right now. But i also want my job and i want my music And i want alone time with you. Well, you should take a break from that. Let me go through those things. I'll try to find a person that's really ugly with a lot of great references. Actually, you can't, Because i thought you might want to get a workout in. You know, our therapist said that We should focus on the things that we love, so... I think she's right. I'm probably really gonna suck, you know. You are gonna find out sometime right? Thank you, hales... For everything. You're welcome. Thank you back. You lucky, man. I was gonna break that scoriatitle and pull that old laundry up off the wall. Luck has nothing to doth it. I'm just better than you. How you holding up? How you think? If somebody would have told me your old sorry ass would be back playing before mine, I would have laughed their ass out the gym.

I'm kind of pissed off. Why? What happened? Just some nonsense quentin said to me. You know, sometimes that kid's got a big mouth, man. What's up? Uh, millicent is gonna move in after all. Fine with me. Hey, about time we classed up the place a little bit, huh? Well, speaking of, you think we could? You ow, straighten up a little and straighten up a little? Oh, you talkin' about all the sex talk And foul language, right? Yeah. Good luck with that. Come on, skills. I'm not saying everybody has to be a saint, But millicent's a girl, you know?

Actually, i think i'm gonna record that album with peyton. Really? Yeah. That's great, haley. Yes, it is. Yeah. How'd your workout go? Not so good. But you know what? Whatever happens, we're gonna be fine. Yeah, we will. Deb: hello? Who is that? That's the new nanny mama hired. Did someone call for a nanny? Grandma! What did i tell you about that? Grandma deb is way too young to be a grandma. Sorry. Nanny deb! Oh, i like that so much better. Hi, mom. Hey, mom, you look great. Ooh, thank you. ?? It's been said that the saddest thing a man will ever face</i> Is what might have been. But what of the man who's faced with what was?</i> Or what may never be? Or what can no longer be? You did the right thing, skills. And one of these days, "q" is gonna realize that. Now we just got to figure out a way to win without him. Choosing the right path is never easy.</i> It's a decision we make with only our hearts to guide us.</i> But sometimes we find our way to something better.</i> Hey, brooke, come on. We got to get to the airport to pick up that baby. I think i need to do this alone. I'm gonna be okay. Okay. Okay. Sometimes we fight through the regret and remorse of our mistakes --</i> Our malice and our jealousy And the shame we feel for not being the people we were meant to be.</i> And that's when we find our way to something better...</i> ...or when something better
