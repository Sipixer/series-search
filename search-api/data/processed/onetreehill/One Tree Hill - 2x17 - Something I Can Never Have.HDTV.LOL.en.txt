Let them think you're a couple. But we're not a couple! You a couple in real life? - Um, actually- - You know, the music never lies. Somebody bashed in my car windshield last night. I mean, could things get any worse? You wanna ask me that again? I fell in love with Keith for real. I want him to know who you really are. I'm sorry. She left. Jules!? Jules?! I didn't do anything. You – sick – bastard! I found out about your arrangement and I went to Jules. And I threatened to tell the truth. My dad got that job... in California! We're moving next week. What're we gonna do? I don't wanna go. Nikki. What're you doing here? Go get Haley. She's your wife. Charles Bukowski once wrote; There will always be something to ruin our lives. It all depends on what or which finds us first. You're always ripe and ready to be taken. Well, well, well. Isn't this the picture of a perfect family? What're you doing here, Nikki? Oh, you mean why am I not in Seattle? Right, some skank writes a random city on a napkin and I… catch the first flight out! No. We had a court hearing a few weeks ago and imagine my surprise when you didn't show up. I guess you didn't have your mail forwarded to… 'Seattle'. So, since you didn't show, the judge granted me sole custody of my daughter, which, for the brunette impaired, means that Jenny comes home to mommy. You're lying! It's cute, she talks for you. But I have a feeling that a judge would have a problem awarding custody to a high school drop-out who kidnapped his baby anyway. Well how do judges feel about women who abandon their children, huh? I don't know, there was no one in court to ask. So she's mine now. Hand her over. Forget it! She'll never be yours. You know, I don't even believe you, anyway. Oh, you can not believe me all the way to jail if you want- Oh, ho, ho, she fights for you too! Fine… we'll let the police deal with it. See you soon bunny. Don't go. I just needed to say it. You have to stay! We're finally friends again and now I'm leaving. I really liked being the girl behind the red door. Mom? What're you doing here? I was waiting for Keith. He never came home? Guess not. Yeah, he wasn't at Jules' apartment, either. Any idea where else he might be? If I had two guesses, they'd both be at a bar getting drunk. Why didn't you just tell me what was going on? Coz I knew you'd tell Keith. You know, and I thought… moving with Dan… was the only way to… get him to leave Keith alone. You should have told me. I'm sorry I hurt you. You have no idea how hard this has been. I have an idea. So how did you find out about Dan's arrangement with Jules? What arrangement with Jules? Keith…! What arrangement? Dan… paid Jules to be with you. So, both of you knew about it… and you said nothing!? Keith, wait, wait, wait! Let's talk about this. Everyone I thought I cared about… lied to me. What's there to talk about? I'm not gonna need a ride home after school. I'm going to dinner with Peyton. How romantic. Velma picking you up in the 'Mystery Machine'? She's not gay, Felix. Well, everyone at school thinks she is. Yeah, because you painted 'DYKE' on her locker! It practically wrote itself. That's not funny. Look, whatever! She's always jealous of me hanging around Brooke and you know she has a crush on you. That's not true. Why did we leave our last school, Anna? Because once the rumours started, we couldn't stop them. And no one cared if they weren't true. You cried every day, remember? Yes, Felix, I remember. And I wasn't gonna let that happen again. I knew if I painted 'DYKE' on Peyton's locker, everyone would think she was gay. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! I was friends with her! Really? I haven't seen you guys hanging out as much since then. You see, Anna, you're so predictable. One well placed rumour… and you go running off, scared. Besides… better her than you. Little formal for work, don't you think? Did you set me up? Huh? Jules, the wedding, was it just all a big lie?! What?! Of course not. We're brothers, Keith, I would never do anything to hurt you. Especially with the woman you're gonna marry. I'm sorry, I can't keep going, it's just too good. What can I say? Of course I set you up. How could you do that? Well, I just pictured you screwing my wife over and over again and then I thought about the heart attack it gave me and after that, it was easy. Where is she? I honestly don't know. Check in the yellow pages under 'W' for whore. Oh, wait; she's not that bright, you better check under 'H'. Hey, come on, Keith. Get off him. - Hey, calm down, man. - Get off me!! By the way, you're fired, too! Can you believe that guy? Congratulations, Dan, I got nothing left to lose. But you do. Remember that. I can't believe this is almost our last time walking to class together. I can't believe I'm getting weepy about walking to class. I feel like somebody needs to yell out 'Dead girl walking'! Ben geek staring! God! I just, I can't imagine what it would be like to not have you to talk to every day. I'm gonna get you a web cam. That way it'll be like you're living with me. Or… I could just live with you. You could. Yeah. You can. You spend most of your time at my house anyway. This is such a good idea, I'm so excited. I'm gonna find a phone and call my mom. Why not just use your cell? Uh… my parents put me on that 'pay as you go' plan… I haven't paid- Then go. Go! Hi. I have to tell you something. Alright, tell me on the way to class, I'm running late. - It's gonna upset you. - Well, that seems to be the trend this week. Are you leaving town or here to steal a baby? Felix is the one who spray painted your locker. You know what, um, I'm not all that surprised. I thought I saw him goose-stepping down the hall. I'm really sorry. Anna, you're not the one who owes me an apology. Well, I wouldn't hold your breath. Felix isn't the remorseful type. He owes you an apology, too. You know, he might have… spray painted 'DYKE' on my locker but he was talking about you. He might not know that but you do. I know. Haley, come on already, we're gonna be late for our own wedding reception. Okay, just give me two more minutes. The shower massager has three speeds. Yeah, and you have one: slow. Would you quit complaining. I need the extra time. Besides, people expect the bride to look beautiful. Yeah? What about me? Don't be silly, no one would ever expect that of you. Oh, okay. That does it. Nathan! We're gonna be late, we're gonna have to do it together. Mom, I wanna stay with Peyton. I don't wanna leave school right now! Oh, that is ridiculous, you and dad are never even home. No, mom! - I spend all my time at Peyton's house anyway! - You look about as happy as I do. - You okay? - Come on! Yeah, I'll be fine. I just… have some things going on. Nothing I can't handle. Because it's totally unfair! Yes, it is! Have you told her how you feel? Nah... Anyway, she's moving. At least she'd know, that's something. You're encouraging me to hit on your brother's girlfriend? Yeah, well, I like you better. I barely even knew her last year… and now I can't imagine life around here without her. No, I hate you! She's so sweet! They said no. Why? Because this week they've decided to be parents. They said that since you have no adult supervision it would be the same as having me stay alone. Are you kidding?! Charlie Brown has more parental supervision than you. Yeah, well, they also… think… What? They think you're a bad influence on me. Unbelievable! Have your parents even met you? Only briefly. I can't believe they won't let me stay with you. My mom is being such a major bi- -tch. Well, if it isn't the other woman… and my favourite travel agent. Any other places you'd like to recommend? Yeah, far away from me! Unless you'd like you next period to come out of your nose. So, I showed up at Jake's this morning with Tree Hill's finest and guess what, no Jake, no baby. Where the hell are they? Phoenix. Are you even sure Jenny's your daughter, coz… I mean, she doesn't look like a bitch. Well, we'll see who the bitch is once Jake spends some time in jail. It'll still be you. Look, I'm tired of these games. Then leave! You don't even care about Jenny, okay? You're just doing this to get back at Jake. You know, only someone without a mother could think that. You know, you'd better leave before Jenny knows what it feels like to be motherless. Oh, wait, she already does! Tell Jake that the longer he hides, the worse it's gonna be for him. Don't let her get to you, Peyton. No judge is gonna side with that psychopath over Jake. Looks like they already did. I don't even think Jake's going to court to challenge it. You think he's gonna run again? He might. If he thinks that Jenny will wind up with Nikki. Damn it! I hate Mondays. Come on. You wanted to see me? Mr Tagarro, close the door please. It's the one without 'DYKE' painted on it. Haley, what's wrong? My parents. What happened, are they alright? Yeah, they're fine. I'm just being stupid, I… When they were here, I spent all my time at Lucas' house or with you and now that they're gone, I just… wish I could see them again. Haley, they're in Georgia. I'd hardly say they're gone. Well they're not here! My house isn't even my house anymore. It's like my whole family just, like, packed up and left before my high school graduation. Not your whole family, Hales. You still have me. I'm not going anywhere. And your house is here too, it's just… smaller and a lot more… apartmenty. Yeah. I know, I just… Urgh, I don't mean to be such a baby about this. I just really miss them. Pack a bag. We're going to Atlanta. Uh… yeah, right! I'm serious. We can't do that, we're broke, and we have to go to school. I'm sure I can scrounge up enough money for gas and screw school! You're a year ahead of everybody and there's no way I'm gonna flunk; I married my tutor. That's really sweet. It's not that big a deal. Hey, yes it is, alright? Now, listen, I may not always be able to give you everything but I can do this. Come on; let's go see your family. Thank you. You know, as long as I have you I have everything I want. But we're still going. You brought it on yourself, Felix! I can't believe you. Do you know how bad this is?! Mom and dad are gonna have to buy the school a new wing to get me out of this! You are missing the whole point! Everything is always about you. You never stop to think about other people! And you do? Did you even consider what would happen to me when you turned me in? You totally screwed me over when I was the only one looking out for you! You were looking out for yourself! You couldn't handle anyone thinking that your sister was a lesbian! Whatever. The whole thing would have blown over if you would have just kept your big mouth shut! No one's gonna even care when they find out I did it. Even Brooke? Can I help you with something? Oh, hi. I'm Charlotte. My parents are looking at the house. It's cute, I guess, for the 'Sticks'. The 'Sticks'? Oh, you live here, right. Must be a huge drag, like, what do you do for fun without cute boys or good parties? Well, well. We have a nightly banjo duel and then there's the cousins swap and on Friday nights we all take baths together. Oh, look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to insult you. I guess I'm just… bitter about this move. Yeah, I know the feeling. Hey! Hey! Maybe Tree Hill's not so bad after all. Well, cya. Who was that? The new me. Any word from Keith? No. Do you think he's gonna be okay? Not for a while. Keith was right; I should have told him. You though you were looking out for him, Lucas. Your heart was in the right place. Yeah, it may take some time, but eventually, he'll understand that. So, when're you moving home? I'm not. Like hell you're not! What reason on Earth could you have for staying?! If Dan could do this to his own brother… who knows what else he could be up to? Look, I'm his one weakness. I gotta stay! Hi, you've reached the Scott's, um, - my wife and I are- - Your wife? What do you, like, own me now? Yeah, I do. Hi, this is Nathan and Haley Scott, please leave a message… or… not. That's the worst thing I've ever heard. Shut up, it rhymed, I like it! - Oops! - Message has been erased. Oh fine, let's just do one together, okay? Wait a minute, isn't that something only really cheesy couples do? Yeah, well we are a really cheesy couple, Mister. - Good point. - Okay. - Hi, you've reached Haley- - And Nathan, I live here too. Yes, Nathan lives here too because we're married! And, uh, we can't get to the phone right now because we're, um… We're having sex? I mean, just, we're having really- - Okay. - ...hot sex. Oh! Oh, we're still on. Uh, leave a message! And, uh, we'll get back to you when we're done! This is crazy. I don't wanna get anybody else in trouble. I should just go. Jake, you need to be smart about this, and running isn't smart. You need legal help. Settle it that way, especially if Nikki's already done that. I can't afford a lawyer! I can. I got a great attorney. I can't ask you to do that. You're not, I'm offering. Thanks! I mean… I appreciate it but… costs aside, there's no guarantee that I'll win. It's true, but at least this way you get a chance. I'll make a call. Okay. So, that's great news! Yeah. But if there's even a chance that Nikki could get custody of Jenny, I can't take it. Keith, I am so sorry! Yeah, me too. Wait, please! Karen, haven't you already done enough? I wanna help! Look, I didn't know about Jules until right before the wedding… and the only reason I know anything is because I was worried about Lucas and… so Andy and I hired a private investigator to look into Dan. I had no idea that he was involved with Jules. Well it doesn't really matter anymore! - Does it?! - Of course it does! If she truly loves you… couldn't you still love her? I don't know. I guess I'd at least… like a chance to… I guess I'd at least like to find out the truth. Her real name is Emily Chambers. Everything in that file is what the investigator found out about her. Emily. Dan… is a monster. But he gave me Lucas… and, despite his worst intentions, I have the one person I love most in the world. Maybe you can, too. You know, TV might be more entertaining. There's nothing on TV I wanna see. Talk to me. My whole world's being ripped away from me. So is Jake's… and yours… and all I can do is sit here and watch it happen. Tell you what, let's change that; I'll kill Nikki for you… No, really, at least that way… Jake would stay here, I'd be sent to a prison in North Carolina and be close to you and Felix could come and give me multiple conjugals. That was a joke! Yeah, um… Brooke, you know how they say 'misery loves company', um… there's something I gotta tell you about Felix. We are finished! Look, let me explain. No, I can not believe you would be such a hateful scumbag as to writh 'DYKE' anywhere, let alone on my best friends locker!! Brooke, wait. I am so glad I am moving, I had no idea I was a greying wizard's next door neighbour! And you actually had me starting to think you were a decent guy! Look, I was trying to protect my sister, Brooke! Look, I did it the night at the dance when Peyton and I argued and you dumped me! I wasn't thinking. Well, what a surprise! Look, I was in a dark place and I took it out on Peyton, I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right, you are sorry. So why don't you crawl back into your dark little place and die there! Brooke? Brooke?! Lucas, coming in to say goodbye? Actually, I think I'm gonna stay. Well, at least for now? Look, as messed up as it was, you did keep your promise to leave Keith alone… so I need to keep mine. And, well, you're also paying for my HCM medicine and since I really don't wanna die anytime soon… I need it. What about your mom? Well, she's not… too happy with me right now. I think… besides you, I'm… currently her least favourite person. I'm sure that's not true. But I'm thrilled to have you. Thanks. Nathan, I'm slipping, you're gonna drop me! Drop you? If I wanted to, I could shoot you across this room like a three pointer. You want me to try? Don't you dare! Well, we're gonna do this the right way. Now, since I couldn't get the fancy honeymoon suite… I figured I could, you know, at least carry you across our one bedroomed threshold. Oh my god! I wanted everything to be perfect. I know you didn't get your dream wedding, or your dream honeymoon- I got my dream guy. Well, yeah, you did get that. Honeymoon suite, huh? Listen, we don't have to do anything, alright? It's not why I married you. You gotta be kidding me. Oh, what've I gotten myself into? I'm here for Haley Scott. Haley who? Haley James. Are you on the list? I'm her husband. Oh, that's great. Tell her I said 'hi'. Okay. Nathan, oh my god! What're you doing here?! I wanted to see you. I needed to see you, I- I'm so glad you did, I miss you. Listen, I asked you to marry me because I wanna spend my life with you. I still want that. I love you, Haley. I love you too. So I came here for you and I'll be here for you no matter what. I'll go with you on the tour, I'll wait for you, whatever you want me to do. I'm not giving up on us. I'm not giving up on our marriage. I don't know what to say. Oh, no-no, Chris and I aren't together, I promise you. It's never been about that. You're not wearing your ring. I love you. Oh, I do, but I feel like… maybe we rushed things a little bit, maybe I… I rushed things a little bit. We're so young and I wasn't ready for all this. You and the music and… now it's all happening at once and… it's really hard! I don't know if I can be… who you need me to be. All I want you to be is my wife! Is it too much to ask? Haley! We're ready. I have to go. Um… God, can you just wait here and I will… meet you after the show and then… we can talk and… I don't even- I'm really happy that you came. I love you. I love you. Please welcome back, Haley James! Mom and dad are sending me to military school. At least there won't be any lesbians to scare you. Yeah, well Brooke dumped me, too. You know… no matter where we moved or how we fit in, you always had my back and I always had yours, always! Now you turn your back on me coz I wrote 'DYKE' on some stupid chick's locker? She's not stupid. Peyton has been more of a friend to me than you have… and she didn't do anything to deserve you tagging her locker! Who cares? I care! It's a hate crime! It's just a word. It's not just a word… it's who I am! Peyton isn't gay, Felix. I am. So you wanna spry paint 'DYKE' somewhere… do it on my walls! Spray it on me! What're you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! The rumours… they weren't rumours. They aren't. Shut up, Anna! No! I won't 'shut up'! You think I've been running from this?! I haven't! I have been carrying it around! And if you think what you've been doing is protecting me, then you're wrong! You have been making me afraid to be who I am! Well I won't be afraid anymore. Now you know the truth… I'm gay. So, do you still have my back? Sorry about you and Felix. Yeah! Are you okay? Yeah, it's just… every time I see something in Tree Hill, it's probably the last time so I feel like I have to take mental pictures of everything, you know? Well… make sure… you make me look good when you take my picture. So, what're you gonna miss most about me? I can only choose one thing? Yes, and it has to be something good; not… how much you'll miss hanging out with me or how hot I am! Hmm… neither one of those, huh? - No. - Damn! I miss the girl behind the red door. Come on. This is all my stuff, I don't understand. I… had my mom talk to your parents and they said that you could stay here till the summer. They didn't… want to, Brooke, but… my mom can be really convincing. You did this for me? I wasn't ready to lose you yet. So, you, gonna stay or what?! Yeah, of course! Oh… I wasn't ready to be lost. Thank you. So much for painting happy little trees, huh? I think you might wanna start locking your door if a man with a baby can take you by surprise. Well… if every surprise is this man with this baby, then… the door stays unlocked. I was worried you skipped town again. No, no, I'm gonna stay. Look, I said when I came back in town, I wasn't gonna run anymore, I meant it. If Nikki's ready to fight for custody… then so am I. Well, what if she shows up tonight? Well, lock the door, just in case. Look, Peyton. I know this is hard. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, it's just… the last time I left town it was me and Jenny and now it's… me and Jenny and… you. You guys have been great. Chris Keller's up next. Dinner's in ten minutes. Okay. Thank you, Karen. You know you saved my life, right? Don't thank me yet, Brooke. Sit down. Now, I know your parents are a lot more… hands off. Yeah! But I'm not gonna make it easy on you and sometimes you're not gonna like me for it. When you're in my house, you live by my rules. There will be no staying out all night. No boys sleeping over. No- It's just like having a real mom. Alright! Okay. Keith, are you leaving? Look… I know I made the wrong decision in not telling you about Jules and Dan… and I'm sorry. But you gotta know, Jules loves you. You mean Emily? You should have told me the truth, Luke. I've always been honest with you. I just, it though… I thought we meant more to each other. Maybe I was wrong. Look, Keith, where're you going? Don't know. You coming back? For the first time in my life… I don't know if I have anything to come back for. Synchro: Amariss
