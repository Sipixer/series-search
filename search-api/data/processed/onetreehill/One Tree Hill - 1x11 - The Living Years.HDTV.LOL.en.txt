- Hostility stays outside, Dan. - Things have just gotten out of hand, - so, we thought we could use some… - No, you thought. - … objectivity. - Define “gotten out of hand”. Nathan? Pass. We reached the breaking point two weeks ago when my son… - You hear that? “My son”. - Deb is speaking now, Dan. When our son collapsed on the basketball court after taking drugs to boost his performance. The kid made a mistake, he knows that. His father has been bullying him about the sport since he was old enough to hold a ball. Is that true, Nathan? His mother is so quick to put the blame on me, but up until recently, job always came first. Yes, but I changed my behavior Dan, you haven’t. You cant seem to loose this unhealthy obsession you have with basketball, - and how Nathan plays it. - She blames me for her shortcomings as a mother. Okay, I think we got some things out in the open. Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem? - Part of. - But you still like playing? I don’t know anymore. Great, nice break through Nate. Thanks, Doc. - Dan. - Hustle up! No way this is helping. You’re right, Dan, we don’t need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious. I’m not his only parent, Deb. - Hey why don’t you ride with your old man, Nathan. - Stop it, Dan. Come on Nathan, lets go. Let the kid make up his own mind. What do you say, son? Nate? Nathan! Here we go. This is the writer I was talking about. Somerset Maugham? Well its, “Maugham” - Human Bondage. - Bondage! Yeah, its not like that. So, you’re good. Are we done here? Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time, you know, hang out with each other. And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky? Haha, it’s the smell of old books. Like I said! Come on, its my turn. Please? Just keep it legal. Wait, you sure your parents wont come home? They could. But, this isn’t their Jacuzzi. Brooke… whose house is this? I don’t know! Does it matter? Here you go. Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty. Oh! Sorry. Things have worked out pretty well, huh? Karen’s café gets to stay open, and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law. So, how are you doing with things? Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday. Dan and counseling. It’s kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar. Well, if you think it would help, I’d be happy to talk to Nathan. I think he’d like that. I know you like my women, Keith, but come on! Deb’s still my wife. Won’t be for long if you keep this up. I’m taking Nathan to dinner tonight. Do you have a problem with that? - Yeah. He needs a break from you. - You can't stop me from seeing my own son. Oh, actually I can. By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer. Your choice. Tell him I’ll pick him up at 7. Tell Nathan to come see me. I’ll do what I can. Peyton? Peyton! - Where’s Peyton? - Dressing for school is my guess. Who are you? I’m the guy who’s about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass. I’m her dad. Who are you? Oh. Sorry. The front door was open and I thought… I’m Lucas. Larry Sawyer. Hey dad, do you know where my… What are you doing here? Oh he’s trying to rake me to death. What?! I thought you were… nothing crucial. I’m gonna go put this back. - So, who’s the guy? - What guy? The one that’s got you smiling. That’d be my dad. Oh, I’d be smiling too but for entirely different reasons. Dude, that’s my dad! Don’t go all horndog on me. There’s a line! Speaking of which, I really don’t wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask. When has that every stopped you? I need to connect more with Lucas. I thought you guys were already doing that. I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far. Can you help a girl out? Yeah. You know what? Give him this. Travis. Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him. Great.  Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him? Just friends. I know, sorry. You’re a goddess. Did you finish ‘The Little Prince’? No, I just rented the movie. This book is stupid. Nathan, you’re not going to pass French if you keep renting movies. Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read. So, are you ever going to tell me how it went? The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not. Wow, what did you say? I  didn’t know what to say. Nobody’s ever asked me that question. Wow, that’s really big. This last couple of weeks without it, I mean if I didn’t play I might actually have a life. - What would you do? - I don’t know. At least I’d have some time to figure it out though. Besides, I’m sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right? You think? I think you’re really brave. To consider rebuilding who you are. I don’t know if I could do that. You could. - Well, I gotta go. - Oh yeah. Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right? Yeah, I’m just not sure if I do. I’ll see ya. All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy. - Hey. - I got you something. But I don’t have anything for you. And yet you do. A couple of songs on there that made me think of you. Of course most things do. I didn’t know you were into Travis. Are you kidding, I love Travis. He’s the best. Who? Travis guy. Are we not in the same conversation? Check out tracks 8 and 13. You’ll love them. Bye. Thought you might want that back. I already have it. So do I. Tracks 8 and 11? Totally you. So what are you doing? Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke? - Why would I do that? - Well, I asked you first Look, don’t underestimate Brooke. She’s full of surprises. Its just part of her charm. She told me to listen to track 13. There are only 12 songs. Honest mistake. Yeah, I guess. Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad. I had no idea he was there. It’s cause he usually isn’t. I thought you were happy with your setup. That’s what I tell him. I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own, and how responsible I’m being even when I’m not. He loves his job, you know? And after my mom died, it’s just not fair to ask him to give that up. But I miss him when he’s away. You tell him that? He worries. It’s just better not to. So listen, I don’t have a lot of quiet time these days. You mind if I just sit and read while you draw? As long as you don’t act out the parts. Alright. My mom said you wanted to see me. Yeah. Hand me that ratchet, would you? So how are you holding up? Why? Are you going to report it back to my mom? It’s not like that, Nate. Look, I know you and I haven’t talked very much. And I’m sorry about that. But that’s just fall out from your dad and me. I know you’re going through some tough times so, if you need anything... Well, let me ask you something. You played basketball in high school, right? - Only for a little while. - You didn’t enjoy it? What are you kidding me? I loved it! But there was no pressure then. And then I didn’t love it so much anymore. Your dad came up and just made everything a competition. So then you just walked away? Only looked back at the cheerleaders. It’s just a game, Nate. Not a life. Hey spirit girl. That cheerleading thing always throws me off. What? Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it. My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it’s just kind of our thing. - Oh cool. - What’s up? So, um, I need some advice. About Nathan. I don’t know if its crossing a line. Okay, funny wasn’t what I was going for but.. I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess I’m everybody’s go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right? If it’s too weird then… No it’s cool. What’s going on? Well, um, Nathan’s talking about quitting the team. And I just, I don’t know what to say. Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can’t help you out much. But you’re so much better with him than I ever was. He’s lucky to have you. Thanks. I  don’t want to keep you from your practice. Hmm. Go Ravens. Hey, um, I didn’t mean anything, about your mom. It’s cool. Okay. You could have told me Travis was a group. It’s not like it’s some big secret. Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that. I felt so stupid. You’re not stupid. You guys just don’t like the same things. See, that’s the problem. He brings up art and books and I’ve got nothing. - Hey you. - Hey you. And you. Welcome back, gentlemen. Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus. Suicides. Now. Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski. Come on, Coach. It’s either this or I miss practice. Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up. I’ll take her, Jake. Yeah? Thanks, Peyton. Glad to. Alright, gather around. Where’s Nathan? Tim, you’re his girlfriend, where is he? I don’t know, coach. He was at school today. Alright. I’ve got some offensive sets worked out here. Line up at the low stacks. So I had an idea. Okay. Remember when I read that Steinberg book? Steinbeck. Yeah, that guy. And then you did something that I wanted. Oh yeah, yeah. Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded? But in a fun way. I’m thinking we should try that again. Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first. Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you. And I want you to know… almost everything about me. - What’s going on, Brooke? - Nothing. I just... I want to know you better, Luke. So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along, and then we trade. Are you busy after practice tomorrow? Yeah, I have a date with you. Half with olives. We aim to please. Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara. What? You know how I like to kid around. Yeah, you’re famous for it. Dad, you really think that’s gonna help what’s going on? Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I’d try again. We’ll be okay. Right. You just focus on your game. Whitey kick your ass today? I didn’t go to practice. What’s going on with you, Nate? Nothing, I just need some time. Okay? No its not okay. It’s career suicide. - Dad, Keith said… - Keith said! You talked to Keith? You take advice from Keith you’ll end up spending the rest of your life running a second rate auto garage. Is that what you want? I told you. I don’t know what I want. That’s just freaky. Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team? I didn’t tell him he could quit. He wanted to talk, we talked. Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes. So you neglect him most of his life, I’m out of the house a week, and there you are? He surprised me, Dan. You know, Nathan’s a good kid. You got him so screwed up he doesn’t know what he wants. Deb got her hand up your back, Keith? Deb’s the best thing Nathan’s got going for him right now. - She’s trying to save him. - What the hell do you think I’m trying to do? I’ve been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny. I don’t mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring, but leave the good one alone, would you? Hey Peyton. Missing these? Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet. I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with. She was shaking them like a pom pom. Maybe she’ll be a cheerleader. Or President. You gotta think big. Alright, you never know. Whatever makes her happy. You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are. Well, its really not that hard. I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked. She’s just so cute. And I think about watching her grow up. I couldn’t imagine not being there. You know, I bet you’re a really great dad. I don’t know. Some days I wonder. Hey Nathan. Hey. Missed you at practice. Look man, you don’t have to be nice to me cause I’m going out with Haley, okay? I’m not. Team sucks on a day without you man. Ask Whitey. I’m  trying to avoid him. That’s cool. Do what you got to do. Usually do. Am I hallucinating? Did I just see you talking to Lucas? No, he was trying to talk to me. The whole nice guy thing’s wearing kind of thin. You want to walk to English? Actually, I think I’m gonna cut out of here a little bit early. Wanna join me? Are you serious? Yeah, why not? You up for it? I can’t, Nathan. Alright. Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I’ll catch you later. Okay. You know what? Catch me now. - Oh My God! - Nice, huh? So, are we trying to get killed? I told you, my dad’s in Charlotte, it’s okay. I’ve never seen you like this. Now you have. - Let’s go inside. - Okay. - Okay, 1...3...5... - Okay. - Got it? - Yeah I’m good. Oh, stop moving the pier. Nice knowing you. You’ve got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you’re training? - Can we do this later? - There may not be a later for you. - Oh, oh Mr. Scott... - Was I talking to you? Get in the car. I’m driving you both home. You’re mother’s going to love this. You getting drunk on her watch… There’s some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about. Why does interesting scare me? No, no. Listen, the company’s been hired to do some flood control. They want me to supervise. How long is it going to be this time? Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months. So, what’s the upside? It’s a lot of money, sweetie. Way more than I make now. We could be good to go for a while. Maybe even afford that art school you talk about. Is this something that you want? I only want to do this if it’s right for us. You should do it, dad. What happened to you? Nice to see you too. Yeah, I missed you in sixth period. Yeah, I kind of skipped. You can get your jaw off the floor now. He’s got you skipping school? Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed. Alright. Lucas! What are you doing? I’m taking care of my little girl. You are such a trouble maker. Daddy stop it, come on. Don’t. Stop. Hey, sit down, Rake Boy. Hey. I’m never gonna live that one down. Probably not. It’s okay, he can be way worse. What have you got there? - You’re reading Faulkner in school now? - No, I just love his stuff. So what did you do last night? I saw you with Peyton. What are you talking about? You two just looked pretty friendly. Well, that’s because we’re friends. And what are we? Well, I thought that we were dating. Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton. How messed up is that? Brooke! What was that about? She's mad. She saw us together last night. I’ll talk to her. Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night. You okay? You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over. He had just told me about this horrid job he’s taken in New Zealand, so he’s gonna be gone for like ever now. Well, did you tell him not to? It’s important to him. Yeah but he doesn’t know it’s important to you. You’ve got to stop pretending everything’s okay… he might surprise you. Oh hey. I almost gave up on you. - Lost track, sorry. - It's okay. You still hung over? I’m not as bad as your dad’s pants. How great was that? Horrible. Let’s just tackle some geometry, okay? Or, Bottle Rocket is playing at this theater downtown. We could take the train. Are you serious? I promise I won’t get your drunk, okay? We are doing equation’s on the train. Alright, it’s not exactly risky business, but there’s always the ride back. Is this one mine? No. I… This girl I know missed a pop quiz in English Lit yesterday. Haley, you got an F? Mr. Kelly said I could make it up. It’s no big deal. It’s shocking, I’m human, I know. Let’s go. Hey, check this out. New web cam with 2 way voice capability. Sweet, huh? No more hunt and peck. That’s great. Daddy, I just… Hey, and since I missed your last birthday, I got a little surprise for you. You’ve been yammering about working with oils. Wow, um, these are way too expensive. Not anymore, thanks to Global Dredging. - So, you already took the job? - Yep, made the call this morning. Well, congratulations. Yeah, yeah, well you and I are going to go out and celebrate, what do you say? - Okay. - Let me go change. I’ll be quick. You know, sometimes we hold back to spare each other’s feelings, and our own. So maybe it’s good that we have a session without Nathan. Holding back hasn’t been our problem. - How is he doing? - He’s out of control. - He’s skipping school. - Basketball practice. Yesterday we caught him drinking. Sounds like he wants your attention. He was a good kid before. Worked hard. Kept busy with sports. He needs to find himself outside of sports. Right, take away the one sure thing the kids got. Tell me about basketball, Dan. Uh, you put a ball through a hoop. - What do you think Nathan gets out of it? - He gets structure and discipline. And he gets to know that he’s the best at something. And also, you can relive your past and feel good about yourself. Okay, time out. Um, lets talk about the two of you for a minute. I mean outside of Nathan, let’s explore what makes you work as a couple. I mean, who are Deb and Dan Scott? Well, you’re late, practice was over about 5 hours ago. I drove past and saw your car. Don’t you ever go home? Sometimes I think this is my home. Well, is this a hit and run or a sit down? Sit down I guess. Good. I don’t know what I’m going to do, Coach. Nathan, nobody can make you do anything you don’t really want to. By nobody you mean my dad. Let me ask you a question. - Let’s take your father out of the picture. - I wish. Let’s take out all the pushing, the pressure, the training that you’ve got to do to be as good as you are. Now ask yourself one simple question. Do you really love this game? I do. I just hate what it’s doing to my life. Then you may have found your answer. You wanna know what I think? I’m sure you’ll tell me. I think he’s trying to have the best of both worlds. Who? Lucas? He uses you for some sort of intellectual slash emotional thing, and me he just uses. Come on, you know he’s not like that. He’s a guy, Peyton. I mean, follow the nature trail and they’re all the same. Brooke, you could have any guy that you want and now you’ve got Lucas, okay, so can you please just sit back and enjoy it? He likes you! I like you, okay? So trust him, trust me, maybe try trusting yourself, okay? Doorbell broken? She never hears it. She always has her music on. I tell myself I’m doing what’s best for my daughter. That she should have whatever she wants. What I think she wants is you. Did you see her comic strip today? What strip? It’s supposed to be anonymous. Our secret, okay? Yeah. Hey Haley, you got a sec? Hey, you planning our next road trip? Actually, I thought we could just talk. Oh yeah, sure, what’s up? Well, look. Haley, I’ve had a lot of fun with you lately. But, I’m trying to apologize. For dragging you out of class the last couple of days. Oh Nathan, I had fun. And you got an F on your exam. Well, so what? You know, I make my own choices and I choose to be with you. That’s the thing. Look, I like to be with you too, but the real Haley, the one that I got all crushed out on, you know? I don’t want to see you change. I like you. And I like the fact that somebody like you sees something in me. Somebody like me or me? You already know the answer to that. You waiting for me? Actually, I’m just hanging out with your dad. Oh God, help me. Listen, you should probably talk to Brooke, she’s convinced she’s not being a good enough girlfriend. Oops, am I interrupting? Actually, I was just gonna... Please tell me that’s laundry. My ride’s on the way. I’m headed out tonight. You said you were going to be here till Wednesday. That was before I turned down the job. What? They managed to find me a 3 week gig instead. Then after that, I’m only taking locals, so we can be a family again. Daddy, don’t joke with me It’s no joke, hunny. Peyton, I love what I do, but not nearly as much as I love you. You’ve been alone enough, no more. I love you, Daddy. You better. Just promise to keep talking to me, okay? - I want to know what’s going on inside that pretty head. - Okay. - Mr. Sawyer, your ride’s here. - Oh, I gotta go. Okay. Lucas, you keep an eye on this one for me, alright? I will. I’ll leave the light on for you. Oh and by the way, I like your comic strip. Hey. Keith said you were at Peyton’s, again. Actually I was with Peyton’s dad, if that makes any difference. Whatever. Luke, can we talk? Yeah. Okay, I’m not sure if we have a problem, or if I have a problem. What’s the problem? In a nutshell, you’re you and I’m me. Yeah but if I was you, you’d be dating yourself. What I mean is, I do what I do, and I like what I like, and that’s just who I am. I know, and that’s what I love about you. Okay, but the music that you listen to and the books that you read, I’m not into any of that stuff. And I never asked you to be. Okay? You know, I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re different. Okay. I’m sorry. It’s just that you’re the first really great guy that I’ve ever dated and that really scares me because I never gave a rat’s ass before, okay? But I do now. That’s good, because I give a rats ass about you too. You’re mother know you’re here? Yeah, she said it was cool as long as we didn’t kill each other. I’m sorry for all the crap I’ve been pulling lately, dad. I figured. Everything okay? Not so good. Well, you’ll bounce back. Dad, how did we get so screwed up? We’ll get through this, Nate. How? Everything’s basketball with us, Dad. And now you’re yelling at me, and mom... Mom’s yelling back at you. I’m starting to wonder, is this all because of me? Nathan… I mean, Dad, look... I know you’re upset with me missing practice and everything, but I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be the player you were. I’m starting to think maybe... maybe you chose the wrong son. Nathan, you have to know, whatever you do, whatever you decide... you’re my son, and I am proud of you. I love you. Hey. I was looking for you. I’m done. Just thought you should be the first to know. Me? Yeah, you wanted my world man, it’s all yours. “And the little prince said to the man” “Grownups never understand anything for themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always explaining things to them“ Synchro et trad : Amariss
