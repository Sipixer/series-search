You're not lucas! You're brooke davis! Yeah. Hi. You're... wearing me. Clothes over bro's is my line. Yeah, i - I love it. Thanks. And you are so pretty in person. Thanks. So are you. Okay, this hasn't happened to me since college. Right. Okay. Um... Wow, uh, this hasn't happened to me since college. Hi, luke. Brooke davis. Oh, i missed you. So, what do you want to do today? I don't know. Play, i guess. Yeah, me, too. Don't you have a job? What are you, the man? I don't see you paying any rent. That's because i don't have any money. Well, that makes two of us. Now, let's just go over the drill. If we see any hot chicks today, who are you? I'm an orphan who needs surgery, And you're paying for it, 'cause you're rich. Good man. Bl-Bl-Bl! Whoa! Soapbox derby. Man, when i was a kid, i always wanted to do this. Me, too. It's a good thing you're still a kid, 'Cause we got two days to pimp your ride. Can uncle mouth help me pimp my ride? I don't think so. See, uncle mouth finally got a j-O-B. That spells "job." Man, you're getting way too smart. It was a lot easier when you was 3. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm marvin mcfadden, and sports is coming up next. Alice: what, exactly, are you doing? Oh, the station called about the field-Reporter position? Field reporter - Little ambitious, don't you think? The job that we called you about Is an entry-Level logger position. We could hire a monkey to do that, But the freaks at peta would more than likely picket. But i guess i assumed - First door on the left. You watch the games, you highlight the best plays, And you leave the log for on-Air. If you cannot accomplish that, You are currently wasting my time. I'm sorry, but you are still looking For a reporter, aren't you? The answer to your question, yes. Let us be honest - You don't really have the face for it, do you? All right, good morning. This is actually my first official day as a teacher, And you're my first official class. So, congratulations. Uh, my name is... Haley... James... Quentin: that is some fine ass. All right, first of all, That's no way to talk to a girl, any girl, And second of all, that is absolutely no way To speak to a teacher. I'm sorry. It was me. Just trying to give you a compliment. What's your name? Quentin fields. Okay. Sit down, quentin. Yes, ma'am. Won't happen again, miss james. Actually, it's mrs. Scott. Damn, that ass. Okay, all right. Get out. You need to go to the office. Oh, to the office. Maybe we could go together, huh? Maybe you could just spank me right here. Yeah, that's right. Ooh, harder, mrs. James-Scott! All right, settle down. Spank me, mrs. James-Scott! I said, "settle down!" Class! Class!Class! Class!Class! I have just - I have just - I - I -I - I -I - Baby, come back! Hey, how much do you love me? I went to see lindsey, luke's girlfriend. I have good news and bad news. All right, luke and i haven't been together for three years. It's not why i'm home. I totally believe you. Fine. Ooh, the office. They're just figuring out i'm not in milan. I bet ctoria's having a cow. You think maybe you should call And let her know you're alive? No. No, i have a more important question to ask you. What happened after lucas finished his book? Hello? Lucas: hey, it's lucas. I know it's been awhile, But i'm having a book signing in l.A. In a couple of days. Yeah, i know. I mean, i read about it. Yeah, i've been pacing the house for the last hour Wondering if i should call, Considering how we left things. No, it's okay. It's actually really good to hear your voice. Yours, too. Well, i was hoping, um... I'd love to see you if you're not too busy. Um, yeah - Yeah, okay. Sure, i'll be there. That's great, peyton. Well, then, i - I'll see you soon, then. See you soon. Ame is lucas scott. I'm the new head basketbal coach of the tree hill ravens. This is antwon taylor. He's the new assistant head coach. You want our credentials? They're hanging right there. I must congratulate you. For some of you, it took only four years To destroy the legacy Coh durham took 35 years to build. Nice work. So, as of today, all 12 roster spots are available. It doesn't matter if you played last year. In three days, we'll have our final roster. If you want to be on it, then i would advise you go hard. Skills? I would definitely go hard. One-On-Two drill. Everybody line up at half court. Mama, i'm gonna race in a soap-Opera derby. What? Hey. How was your first day? Um, horrible. My first class, like, attacked me, And i ran out in tears, And principal turner had to finish the rest of my classes. I'm sorry, hales. They were awful, so mean - Especially this one kid, Who was, like, sexually harassing me. What? Who was it? Him. Hello, there, mrs. James-Scott. We'll see you later, okay? You're late. Yeah? I'm also your leading scorer. No, you might have been a leading scorer on a team That won three conference games all last season. but you are not my leading scorer - Not yet.</I> Whoa!Whoa! Whoa!Whoa! man: seattle is on the clock right now.</I> we'll get to the commissioner in regards to their pick.</I> they going big? They going small?</I> Man: somebody help! Somebody! Well... Well. Don't look away. The second and third greatest nights of your life Just walked back into your world. You looking all rock star totally does it for me. Very heroin chic, nate. I like it. What are you guys doing here? Well, lucas tells me that you can walk, But you need a little incentive. So we have come up with a drill. For every step you take... We kiss. Mmm. Hey, it's good to see you. Nathan... Hey! Hi! Hi! What are you guys doing here? We came to see you and - Oh, jamie, sweetie, come here. There's people i want you to meet. Come on, it's okay. This is brooke and peyton, and this is our son, jamie. Peyton: hey, jamie. How are you? Nate? I missed you. Man, i've always wanted one of these things. Yeah, me, too. Me, too. I think we should paint it red. You know, the red racer. Yo, kid, talk to me about the cape. What's the real? I'm a superhero. Is that right? Why don't you fly to the kitchen and get me a beer? So, what's your take on the team's former leading scorer? Quentin? The kid's pretty good. the kid's really good. Now we just got to figure out If we can get him to play a team game, you know? Can i have pudding? You can read, right? If the pudding says "junk" or "fergie," you can have it. Thank you. Hey, and just one, okay? No, i mean, it's like, I don't know if they lost all those games Because they didn't have enough guys on the team like him. or maybe they just lost because of him.</I> You know who he reminds me of. Yeah. Hi, daddy. Did you see my basketball? No. You okay? "I'm fine, wife. How was your day?" "Oh, you know, husband, my day really sucked, But thanks for asking." And mine didn't? That's just a little selfish, don't you think? No. No, i don't think. And i didn't see you lose your dream. Maybe you need to open up your eyes. Where's jamie? Jamie? Jamie! This belong to you? Wine delivery from new york city. Wow, i called for that wine two years ago. Get in here! Hi! Ahh. Come on. Can i just ask why you decided to become a nanny? Honestly, because i get paid To work with some really great kids. Eventually, i'd like to maybe go back to school And study to be a pediatrician - Someday, when i have someone else's life and income. Look, haley, i know when you go to interviews like this, Both sides are trying to figure out How crazy the other person is. Are you doing that, too? I get it, but i've taken enough of your time. You have my references, And jamie seems like a wonderful boy, so just let me know. Either way, it was great meeting you. It was great to meet you, too. Thank you so much. Look, mama! Me and daddy made mud! I'm sorry. Who am i kidding? How soon could you start? Well, imagine that. Brooke dav What time is it? Like, 8:30. Oh, no. I told haley i'd take jamie! That was some wild night, baby. What time is it? Like, 8:30. Oh, no, i'm late for work! Jamie, have you seen my shoes? I'm supposed to go and pick up - Jamie. What are you doing here? Mommy brought me over. She said not to wake you. Right. You ever had a wine hangover? I had a floppy-Eared bunny named chester. I got to go. I'm late for work. It's great to see you, brooke. Hi, jamie! Well, well, well. Somebody just got strike two. Look, alice, i think we got off to the wrong start. I just want you to know That i'm honored to be a part of your staff, And i'm looking forward to working for you and learning - I really don't like you. Well, um, what can i do to change that? Quit... before i fire you. Jamie, this thing is really awesome. Yeah. Yeah? What? Aren't you excited about big Ace? i guess, but it's supposed to be my car,</i> And they're not letting me do anything. Well, then, you better stand up for yourself, huh? What do you mean? Well, like, what color do you want it to be? Red and blue like daddy's, But they want it red, like elmo. And i hate elmo. Grover's so much better. Grover's blue. I so agree with you. Blue it is. You've got to take a stand, jamie. If you start giving in now, It's just gonna get worse, trust me. I'm glad you're my godmother. Me, too, buddy. Now let's go get some paint. Come here! I t you! Hi, principal turner. Haley, i thought i'd join you for a few days. I can do this on my own. I know, but you're young, And sometimes, the students take advantage of that. Let's get you walking, and then you can run. Skills: run, run, run! Pick it up! Blue team, two-On-Two zone! Two-On-Two zone! We don't play no zones, coach. You do, if i say so. You stay in man to man, i can do this. Just take me home, peyton, okay? I'm not feeling this today. Maybe not, but the doctors are. The doctors weren't the ones With a piece of glass in their spine And nerve damage four f'ing months ago. Anyway, it's not like i'll ever play basketball again. Hey. You know what? First of all, shut up and take a look around. You have a life that any one of these kids would die for. And what's really sad is that most of them probably will. So, that morning, i'm reading an article About how she's recently sober, And that night, She's in the booth next to me at a club, wasted. And then my label signs her to a record deal. I'm sorry. I can't be a part of that. Here's to not being a part of it. Here's to taming my demonic english class. No, no, we're not going there 'cause this song is insane. Yeah. Mouth! Hi! My boss hates me. So, shut up and dance. I think that's lindsey. Hey. Hey. Hey, come here! Hi! How are you? Hey, you. I want you to meet my best friend - Not that guy. I don't know where she went. Skills: so, here's the plan. I figure we do a couple test runs, You know, work out the kinks. Then tomorrow night, big-Game james here Gonna smoke all those little brats. Yeah, boy. All right, i give to you the red racer! The blue bullet. Brooke helped me. Yeah. Look, well, it don't matter. You ready to try it, flash? Figured that much. So, check this out. We're gonna use this mannequin for the first run. All right. Let's roll! Ohh. Oh, man, we gonna have to fix that. Hi. Oh, hi. Lindsey. Peyton. I know this is awkward, but i just wanted to say hi. And i know i don't know you, but i feel like i do. At least, the version of you from the book. You seemed really brave. Thanks. Anyway, i hope to see you around, peyton. Take care. Damn it, i really didn't want to like her. I know, but she's great, right? Sorry. Haley? Oh, carrie, hi. Hi. Oh, my gosh, i probably look like a boozehound. I was just celebrating with some friends. You look fine. You look great. Really great. Thanks. Listen, i just want you to know That i appreciate you taking a chance on me. I'm gonna take good care of jamie, i promise. Oh, i know you will. You're gonna do just fine. Oh, thanks. Well, i'll see you soon. Okay, you have a great night. Bye. Bye. And, mouth, who was that? Oh, that's carrie. She's our new nanny. I'm sorry. Have you lost your mind? She cannot be your new nanny. Why? Uh, well, for starters, have you looked at her? She is way too hot. Okay, you two need to stop. Why does everything have to be about looks? Maybe she's a great nanny or a great field reporter. Shouldn't that be the point and not her looks? Besides, if haley doesn't hire her, I won't get to see her in a bikini. Nice. Damn, she was hot. I've got to go, you guys. I need to check up on nathan. Seems like another life. It was, for you. I mean, i appreciate you coming back and everything, But considering the way your phone's been blowing up, You have a very busy, very great life to get back to. Okay. I have a very important friend who needs me. why did you come home, peyton?</I> I guess i was looking for that inspiration i felt When we wrote our names here, you know? I was fearless then, brooke. So, what happened to that girl? That girl became assistant to the assistant. So, if you want to be the girl You thought you could be back then, Start a label, peyton. Do it yourself. I am serious. Peyton, i want to invest in your label. I believe in you. Okay? Unless that's not really why you came home. I'm gonna return those phone calls real quick. Ask about the record label. I'm supposed to ask about the label. Yeah, brooke wants me to start my own label here. Are you gonna do it? I met lindsey tonight. She seems wonderful. How long have you two been together? Why didn't you come to the book signing In l.A. Two years ago? Wow. This is a great turnout. Listen, luke, i know this is your first book as an author, But it was also my first book to edit, And i had the best year doing it. So, i just wanted to say thank you And i'm proud of you. Okay, you ready? Yeah. I guess everybody's here that's coming. Hi. Luke, i knew we weren't meant to be. I should get home. See you. Hey. Thought you'd be asleep by now. How was your night? Good. I met peyton. Let me ask you something. Do all of your ex-Girlfriends have to be so damn pretty? Not like all my current girlfriends. Oh, "all" better mean "one." Do you know if they're back for a while? Brooke and peyton? I don't know. Brooke wants to help peyton start her own record label, Maybe in tree hill. You think she'll be good at it? Yeah, she'll be great at it. Then if she needs help, you should help her. And i'll try my best not to be insanely jealous. Hey, as soon as brooke and peyton get here, We're gonna take off, okay? I'm not going. What? James is counting on you. I don't want anybody seeing me like this. Has it occurred to you that this isn't about you? Haley, we're here! Hey! Hey. Hi. So, i have a surprise. You're gonna like it. I made jamie a little something for his race. Look, mama! Oh, my goodness, look at this! This is a real racing suit! And i even made you a sponsor, p. Sawyer. Oh, yeah? Oh.

Hey, baby. What's going on? I don't want to race, mama. Well, you don't have to, but are you sure? I mean, i think it's gonna be really fun. I want to talk to brooke. What's up, handsome? I don't want to do it, but i like my racing suit. The suit's yours, But are you sure you don't want to race? It's my life. I'm taking a stand. Is that okay? Yes, that's okay, honey. Come here. Sorry, uncle skills. Skills: it's okay, buddy. You hear that? My man is taking a stand, blazing his own trail. Follower. Well, he didn't race. He was afraid. You might know something about that. We're all afraid. Yeah, but he's 4, And he needed his dad, and his dad wasn't there. Nice work, dan. Are you gonna say anything, Or are you just gonna sit there Like you have for the last four months? You gonna get drunk, maybe pout a little, cry? You don't get it, do you? I used to be somebody, haley. Do you understand that? Do you understand what that means? I used to be nathan scott, and i was great. And i should have walked away, okay? I know that, and i didn't do it. And now i'm nothing, and i have nothing. You have nothing?! You have a beautiful son who is here! i am here! You have got to figure out Who you're gonna be in this, nathan, Because this version of you does not work for us. I cannot keep living like this, okay? Do you understand what i'm saying? One more night like this, nathan, and i promise you, you will have nothing!</I> Little early, don't you think? Usually don't start my hard drinking till at least noon. Come here. I want to show you something. I talked to my mom, And, um... we decided we want you to have it. Rent-Free, under one ition - That it becomes office space for your new label. Luke... And i've already talked to brooke, So i don't think you have any more excuses. You know that four years ago I would have jumped at this. But what? Doesn't seem so cut-And-Dry anymore? 'Cause it's not. I wrote a novel, and i can't ite a second one. Mouth's boss apparently hates him. Nathan missed his dream by a breath. That's life. So, you couldn't change the world from los angeles. Change it here. I know you can do it. And so do you. Just think about it. i was there, luke. At your book signing in l.A. So, i just wanted to say thank you And i'm proud of you. Okay, you ready? Yeah. I was there, lucas. I was so proud of you. But we hadn't talked in a long time, And i saw you with lindsey, And i figured you guys were together, Which, clearly, you are, and... I like her. I do. But do you remember when you first joined the ravens, And you took all my sketches over to thud without asking? And do you remember what you said that night That you entered the gym for the first time? "Your art matters. It's what got me here." Yeah. It's like you touched my soul. And a few days ago, i was ready to quit again. But you saved me With the words you wrote about me in your novel. So, if you're struggling to write the next one... You should know... That your artters, lucas. It's what got me here. Morning. Sit down, mr. Fields. I think we need a little break, hmm? Like, for the rest of the hour. What do you say, class, huh? Who's with me? Any student who walks out that door fails this quarter. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm just gonna fail you. Say goodbye to extracurricular activities. Say goodbye to sports, like basketball. Do you understand that the rest of your life Is being shaped right now? It's up to you. You can walk out that door and fail this class And just take your chances. Or you can sit down, listen, And learn from somebody that's been there. The choice is yours. The rest of your life is a long time. And whether you know it or not, it's being shaped right now. You can choose to blame your circumstances on fate Or bad luck or bad choices. Or you can fight back. Aah! I'm nathan scott, And i have too much to lose. Haley: things aren't always gonna be fair in the real world. That's just the way it is. But for the most part, you get what you give. This somkind of joke? No, i'm afraid you didn't make the team. You understand, without me, you're gonna lose every game. Oh, i think you're wrong. But if you are right, Then we're going to lose as a team. Mr. Fields? I hear you've been disrupting your english class. I wouldn't recommend you keep that up. This ain't over. it's "this isn't over." Haley: let me ask you all a question. What's worse - Not getting everything you wished for... Well, congratulations, men. You are the new tree hill ravens. Let's go to work. ...or getting it, but finding out it's not enough? I do love my company. I just... I want to run it from here. I know it wasn't the plan. It's my life. I'm taking a stand. Bye. It's perfect. I'll take it. Thank you. Help me with this. Come here. Haley:he rest of your life is being shaped right now. With the dreams you chase... The choices you make... Jamie, wake up. Hey, we're going out, okay? Get ready. Where? It's a surprise. And, hey, buddy, bring your cape. ...and the person you decide to be. Lindsey: you remember why i gave you that? We went to dinner after the signing. It was our first date. You coming to bed? Actually, um... I think i'm gonna write for a while. That's great, luke. You know, son, there's gonna be a lot of times in your life When you're afraid. Being afraid is okay, But if you don't work through that fear, You might miss out on some pretty great things. Are you afraid, daddy? Sometimes. You? Sometimes. Then we'll do this together. On the count of three. One, two, three! The rest of your life is a long time. And the rest of your life starts right now.
