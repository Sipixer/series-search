Oh, honey. I know this is hard for you, but I promise you, we'll be free soon. I know we will. Hi. What are you doing here? I want to come home, Nathan. This is really bad timing. Nathan, we have to go. What's going on? It's urgent. It's your father. We have to go now. Sorry. Haley. Come with us. Looks like it's just you and me this summer. Peyton, what's wrong? Come on, let's get you home. Mnh-mnh, I can't be there alone. Will you stay with me? Hey, you got to talk to me. What's going on with you? I've been getting these creepy e-mails lately. Then, tonight this woman shows up, and she knew things about me. What kind of things? She says she's my mother. My mom's dead, Luke. I was there in the hospital. I watched her die. What? I did something tonight, Peyton. And I can't take it back. It's your father's car. He was working late. Mrs. Scott? My husband was inside. They didn't tell you? Wait here. Captain, Mrs. Scott's here! Okay, putting aside the fact that I do look pretty good, considering I've been on the plane for like a day and a half, you cannot ambush me at the airport with flowers and a nicely tanned end-of-summer body, considering the way we left things... ...three months ago. Okay. Actually, I'm just here to pick up my mom from New Zealand. I didn't think you were coming in till tomorrow. You thought wrong. Oh, look, there's my cab. Quick, maybe you can tell me you love me or something. Hi, honey. Welcome home, mom. You haven't missed a thing. It's about time. I knew you couldn't go an entire summer without doing something here. Whatever. You don't know me. Oh, I think I do. Okay, so, check it out, Tom Sawyer. If you're lucky, I might let you help me. And if you're really lucky, I might even let you pay to help me. What do you say? Brooke's home. Went to the airport this morning to pick up my mom, and poof -- there was Brooke. Poof? Poof. What are you gonna tell her? You're not doing this again? You've turned Nathan's room inside out how many times over the last three months? Those annulment papers got to be here somewhere. Dan, you know what the doctor said. Getting agitated is just going to make your burns itch. Isn't this really about the dealership? It's nearly rebuilt. You'll be going to work soon. It might bring back some bad memories. I had a dream. I was at the office. Everything was normal. Then my arm was on fire. You still don't remember how it happened? I was drinking... ...and passed out. Then I was on the outside... ...on the edge of an inferno. Everything in between is black. I suppose our survival skills are more than we know. At least Nathan will be home soon. Which home, Deb? This one or with Haley? Yo, big time! You got a letter, man. Letter?  From who? I don't know, but whoever it is, she smells hot. You better just hope she doesn't meet me. Hey. That was your mom on the phone. She said she’s gonna spend the night at the hospital with your dad. Unbelievable -- should have a Scott family discount. I'm really sorry, Nathan. About my dad or about us? About everything. So, what are you doing here anyway? Tour playing Tree Hill? No. They wanted me to become a solo artist and record a record or something, but... it didn't matter without you. None of it mattered without you. I made a lot of mistakes, Nathan. That's right, and if you left the tour for me, you made another one, because I'm leaving in the morning. I'm going to High Flyers. Oh. Well, good. Good, you deserve it. You deserve to have whatever you want. Well, listen, there's no more apartment, and I put all your stuff in storage, so you can spend the night in the guest room if you want. Nathan, there wasn't a moment when I was away that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill. That's great. But I'm still leaving in the morning. Unlike  you, I'm taking my heart with me. You talking to me yet? Yeah. Good. And I brought you flowers. Oh. They're very nice. Where did you get them? Neighbor's yard. Look, I'm sorry about the airport earlier. Ah, it's cool. No, I felt stupid for jumping to conclusions and maybe a little jealous that you weren't actually there for me. It's good to see you, Luke. How you been? Tell me that was a goodbye kiss. I want to be with you, Brooke. Look, I know it wasn't fair how I told you I wanted to be with you when your cab is just parked right outside. I just saw you slipping away, and I guess I panicked. It's okay. Really, it is. I actually had the whole summer to think about this, and I thought we could totally have a summer-like fling, just in the fall... and non-exclusive. Non-exclusive? How's that work? Well, we hang out, we go to movies, we have fun. Do we kiss? You bet your ass we kiss. Do we do more than kiss? Maybe... but we also date other people. What do you think? I kind of think you're a genius. Oh, you're just figuring that out now, are you? I missed you, Lucas Scott. I missed you, too, pretty girl. Hmm. Call me later. I have to go deal with Peyton's whole "I'm your mother" scenario. Right, that one's pretty messy. Yeah, so I've heard. You leave for a couple months, crazy moms start showing up, and there's all these things you don't know. Yeah. Did you hear something? Look, Peyton, I locked all the doors. I didn't hear anything. You're fine. Okay? So, Brooke said you kept some of the stuff from when we were sort of... whatever we were. She thinks you're still into me. I told Brooke I wanted to be with her today... before she left. Nice timing. I'm a real piece of work, huh? I mean, every time I play it in my mind, this... "idiot" light keeps flashing at me. Like... "Shut up, shut up." Yeah. Either you say too much or, like me with Jake, you don't say enough, and then they're gone. Yeah. Sorry about Jake. Yeah, me too. It broke my heart. It's been a tough year on hearts. So, it's too bad we had to be this desperate to hang out again, huh? Well, we didn't have to be. We just are. But  I'm glad you're here, you know. I know we kind of lost each other for a while, but, hopefully, that's over, right? Especially considering our history. It's always gonna be there, isn't it? You and me? Hi, sweetheart. Is it true? Honey, look... You said you wanted to talk about it face-to-face, dad, so we're face-to-face. Is this woman my mother? Your mom is gone, Peyton. You know that. But your biological mother is alive. I never knew your father. We only met Ellie. We asked that she not make contact with you unless you requested it. You know, sometimes it's hard for me to look at you without seeing your mom. You got so much from her in such a short time. What did I get from her -- exactly? Other than lies? Just wanted to make sure you have everything you need. You mean, other than you? Sorry. That wasn't fair. This is really weird, Nathan. I can just call Peyton or Lucas or something. No, Haley, it's late. Besides, what's the difference? You turn the lights out, it's all the same darkness, right? Nathan... You know... you know when you took those drugs before the game where you collapsed? You made a mistake... but...  I know you promised yourself that if you had a second chance, you would do things differently. I know that I hurt you. But I promised myself that, if I could get you to listen, I would tell you that... there was never a day on that tour when I didn't think you were the best part of my life. You can't just say that, Haley, not after months of silence. Why? It's the truth. - Really? - Yeah. What about the day you signed the annulment papers? The papers that you initiated? Yeah, after I drove a thousand miles to see you and you didn't even call me after I left. That must have been a hell of an encore. Nathan, you just walked away! Well,  it beats running away. I did call. You called our answering machine, Haley! Because I knew you were gonna hang up on me anyway, so I had to leave a message! I didn't even play it. I deleted you. Well... then you deleted... this -- I was being childish when I walked away from you for the tour. You gave me an ultimatum the night that I left, and I fought back for all the wrong reasons. And I was being stubborn and I can't take that back. I wish that I could. Did I want to go? Yeah. I loved it. I loved every night of it. But I want you to know something, Nathan. There was never a night where I loved it more than I loved you. Pretty angry, huh? Yeah. You'd think after three months, this would have gone away. I don't think that's ever going away. You can probably tell that Nathan's not here. He moved out before he left for camp. Yeah, I know. I'd say "welcome back", but I don't suppose you're staying. No, I am. Oh, well, you might be staying, but you're not staying here. I just rented this place... for me. How you feeling, Mouth? Mouth? Um, weak. I'm feeling seriously underdeveloped. Could have fooled me -- who would have thought you could move all this stuff in here by yourself, huh? Yeah, who knew? Here. Thanks. So, are any of these guys the reason you don't want to date Lucas? No, I date Lucas, just not exclusively. So it's kind of like with Felix? God, no. Felix was a physical thing. I go for some romance with Lucas. - But you won't commit to him? - No, too much drama. I don't know, Brooke. I felt larger than life when I was with Erica. I'd give anything to have that back. You and Erica broke up? Yeah. Why? What happened? She got popular. See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. It is so much better to play the field. Davis? Come on. Hey, Mouth, nice work. Why is that? Brooke gets a place of her own, and you already got her in the bedroom. Oh, easy onthe skanky innuendo. I'm gonna get some more stuff. You could get the couch. Yeah. All right, total reverse déjà vu. I moved all of Nathan's crap out of here three months ago. Oh, but this is gonna be so much better, because this is our new post-game party palace. All it needs is a P. Sawyer make-over, a little paint, a couple of those creepy "nobody understands me" drawings that you do, and a batch of hot boys. Hence the skanky innuendo. Hmm -- first thing we'd have to do is cover up Nathan's hideous paint stain. I don't know. I say you leave it. We can't leave it, Haley's gonna be here now and then. She can't be looking at that. Why not? It's her fault it's there. You and Haley fighting? That depends on which Haley we're talking about -- Haley Scott, the nice girl that played Tric, or Haley James, the not-so-much-of-a-wife that left town and never called, because her I have a problem with. Do you ever think maybe it just got to be too much for her? Like, leaving the whole Chris thing out of it, maybe she just got scared of needing somebody too much. Needing them so much, she just abandoned them? Okay, you can hate me for saying this, but maybe your problem isn't so much with Haley as it is with Ellie, your returning birth mother? No, Brooke, my problem is with anybody who just vanishes and then waltzes back in and expects to be instantly forgiven. And your problem is you're not gonna have anybody to help you paint this place if you keep telling me what my problem is. Sorry. Too angry? Just a smidge. - Dialing back. - Thank you. Look... all I'm saying is we both know what it's like to have your heart broken. Maybe Haley just needs a little help, whether or not she's to blame. Hey. Are you okay? Depends. Are you home for good? Or for bad. Ah, good. Your mom didn't sleep for a week when we brought you home. Every cough, every gurgle, she'd be up and have you in her arms immediately. One time, I -- I teased her about it, and she said, "I'm always gonna be there for her. No matter what, she's gonna know her mother loves her." Honey, we were gonna tell you... together. But when she died... I guess I didn't want to confuse your grief, and... ...I felt so powerless that I couldn't protect you from losing her. You know, I look at this drawing and I think you can be mad at me if it helps. But you leave your mom out of it... because she never lied to you. And she loved you with all her heart. And this other woman, Ellie, she doesn't change who your mom was... So don't you... Don't you dare. Who is the sexy world traveler? - Deb! Oh, it's so good to see you. - Hey, welcome back. So, what do you think of the place? Well, Lucas said it was different. It's pretty edgy, but I like it. - And change is good. - Yeah. How have you been? Well, as you know from my e-mails about Dan,  I have been one miserable bitch -- you? Well, I've been the miserable part. I'm sorry. I guess that means Andy's not back. Not yet. We'll see. Hopefully, he'll be back soon. Have  you heard from Keith? No, I haven't. I guess you haven't either? Hey, can a girl get a decent cup of Joe around here? Oh, one song per cup. Oh, I've missed you, kiddo. I missed you, too. I could use a cup of gin -- I mean, coffee -- myself. Karen? Yeah, please -- coffee, not gin. I'll have gin. So, what brings you around, miss jet-setter? Ah, well, considering what they pay the opening act, I was kind of hoping for a job. I asked Haley to come back to the café if it's okay with you. Oh, of course -- we'd love to have a big pop star performing in our hip, new café. Actually, I was kind of hoping to waitress like before. Oh. Well, table 5 needs a clean-up. Let's see what you got. - I'm on it. - Alright. Well, we were out of gin, so I went with, uh... coffee. Thank you. You know, um... I had my first performance right here, just for Nathan. Have you talked to him since he left for camp? No, he never picked up, so I wrote letters. Are you awake? Yeah. Will you talk to me, please? I don't know what to say to you, Haley. And part of me just wants to find the right words to hurt you... the same way you hurt me. I am hurting, Nathan. You mean, because I made out with Chris? Because I turned my back on us and walked away? Oh, wait, that was you. Always and forever. What? Nothing. Hales? Nathan, please, I just want to talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Haley, I can't do this. I'm sorry. You need to go, all right? Please. I understand... if you don't love me anymore. Always and forever. That's what sucks, Haley. I still do love you. I always will. I just can't trust you. Dan? You found the papers? These are our divorce papers, Deb. You've recovered, and so have I, but our marriage isn't going to. It's time to end it. "But if he could once return to that certain starting place and go over it all slowly, perhaps he could find that thing he was missing. " A divorce is fine, Deb. You seem surprised. But I guess, at a certain point, the fire burns out. I think I'll go for a walk. How much for a broken heart with a side of regret? Um... more than you want to know. So, when you're done here, bring your stuff to the apartment. Why? Because you're moving in with me. why would you do that? Because you need a place to live and I need rent money to pay for my newback-to-school wardrobe. So the way I see it, you move in, I look hot, you don't get crabs at a shelter. Works for me. The whole summer, and I still can't get used to that hair of yours. What?! You did yours last spring, and mine actually looks good. Hey! Plus, Ellie had the whole long-hair thing, and I don't want to look anything like her. I met her once before I knew who she was. You haven't heard from her all summer? No, not since I slammed the door in her face. The weird e-mails stopped coming? Yeah. Why? She's back, Peyton -- Ellie. I saw her today. Yo, big time. Gonna see you at that party, right? Maybe, we'll see. "Maybe, we'll see?" All right, but if you don't show up, I might booty-call that girl that sent you that letter. All right, all right. Hey, yo, Nate, you can't get it all back at once, man. Take it slow. Give it some time. Pretty soon, you'll be back, better than ever. All right? All right. Catch you later. Okay, here's the deal. I got room for you but not a lot of pity. You did what you did, and it's done. Take it or leave it. I'll take it. All right. Come on in, roommate. - May the grace of God be -- - Yeah, okay. I got to tell you, padre, this isn't exactly my home court, you know. Never had much use for religion. I guess what you call kindness, I call weakness. But... no man is bullet proof. I know that. After all, they crucified your boy, didn't they? What troubles you, my son? What me troubles me is how I've made mistakes... ...how I lie awake at night, keeping company with regret, fallibility. I've not been the man I intended to be. That troubles me. And you've come seeking absolution? Yeah, I suppose I have. Let me ask you something. Is it possible to grant forgiveness for sinful acts yet to be committed? I'm afraid I don't understand. It's simple, really. Three months ago, someone tried to kill me. They drugged me and left me for dead. I pretended not to remember. But, in fact, every night since, I've tried to piece it together. And when I find out who did this to me -- and I will find out soon... ...the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble. Aren't you afraid of swimming alone? Well, beats being alone on land. Looking for me? Sort of. How come? I just want to know if you want to hang out, grab some food. Keep it casual. Casual is good. Have a seat. This is gonna work, right? What's that? Us dating, nothing serious. It's working for me. How about you? Absolutely. It's good. So, when are we gonna get to that kissing part anyway? Oh... I'd say right about now if you know what's good for you. At this moment, there are 6, 470, 818, 671 people in the world. Some are running scared. Some are coming home. Some tell lies to make it through the day. Others are just now facing the truth. Some are evil men, at war with good. And some are good, struggling with evil. Six billion people in the world. Six billion souls. And sometimes... ...all you need is one. Transcript: Raceman - Synchro: Amariss
