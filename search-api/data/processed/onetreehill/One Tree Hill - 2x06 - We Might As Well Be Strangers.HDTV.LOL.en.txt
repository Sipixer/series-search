- I’m actually a mechanic. - I like mechanics. It’s my first college class. And you’re taking it with Hargrove? This gut’s tough. My name’s Andy Hargrove, welcome to my class. It’s called ‘Dare Night’; one night, two teams, multiple dares. Oh! My gosh! - What do we win? - A night to remember. I’m in it to win it. Three dollars and… eighty cents. Katherine Anne Porter once said; There seems to be a kind of order in the universe… in the movement of the stars and the turning of the Earth and the changing of the seasons. But human life is almost pure chaos. Everyone takes his stance, asserts his own right and feelings, mistaking the motives of others, and his own. Felix, let’s get going! I don’t wanna be late! Your skirt’s a little short isn’t it? I’m just looking out for you. Can we just go? Sure, as soon as you discover pants. You know why? Because first impressions are important Anna. And yours says all night. You know what, I’ll ride the bus. Anna okay! - Come on! - No! - I’m just playing. - You’re being mean! Let me guess. One of your ‘Friends with Benefits’ hoes didn’t wanna pay her deductible? Gross, that’s my sister. Wait! You mean after they had you, your parents rolled the dice and kept breeding? It’s risky. Funny! You know, I was thinking about this whole ‘Friends with Benefits’. Felix with Brooke. FWB. Hmm… IYFD… In Your Dreams. I saw you in 87; against Williamsburg. You put up, what, thirty-five points? - Thirty-seven. - Man you were unstoppable. You play college ball? How long until we have the results. The doctor will call in a day or two but… his numbers look… good for a guy who just had a heart attack. I tell you what I’m gonna put this on warm-down for you, okay? There, better? How bout that? - Good, it’s good. - Alright, hey you take your time man. How am I supposed to pass a stress test with some orderly reminding me my best days are behind me? Come on, he says you’re doing fine. Thanks. You must be happy; in forty-eight hours… you won’t have to wait on me anymore. Well I’m not going to put my mind on waiting for a phone call. Word in the paper, there’s gonna be a meteor shower this weekend. Thought maybe I’d got out and watch it from the beach house. Good for you, Dan. Maybe we could watch it together. You’ve been with me every step of this recovery Deb. We could go out there and… I could make you dinner. Just to say thanks. That’s all. Sorry, we’re closed. Yeah, I know... I was just wondering if I could post this flyer on your board. I’m… auditioning bands for a local talent night. ‘All-Ages’ night. Tell you what, you can post it if you take your shirt off. - Excuse me?! - Emo’s crap. Gives punk a bad name. - You think? - I do. Huh, well I guess those who can’t do, sell records! You insult all your customers this way? Well since we’re not really open, you’re not really a customer. Whatever, I’m going to school. Don’t forget your Get-Up-Kids lunchbox. You know, its real punk to be up at seven a.m. doing inventory. I never went to sleep. Hello? Jules, its Keith. Keith, you know, the guy who took you on that drive. Gotcha. Well the reason I’m calling is the… follow-up customer satisfaction survey. On a scale of one to ten; how happy were you with the service at ‘Dan Scott Motors’? Well the guy who helped me was nice and… kinda cute. But he waited a whole week to call me and when he did, he came up with some lame excuse about a survey. I’d give him a seven. Well you think we could, uh, bump that up to an eight or a nine? Maybe over dinner tomorrow night. Maybe if he comes to my place and cooks for me. Okay. Hey Coach. Scott! How you feeling? Oh, like a school girl in springtime. What can I do for ya? Well… I just wanted to talk to you about your surgery. - Keith had told me that... - Who gives a damn what Keith says? It’s not his life. Okay… I just don’t know why you’re not going through with the surgery. Lucas, do you know how my wife died? In surgery. Like twenty thousand other people a year and I don’t plan to be one of them! - Look, Coach. - No, you look! We are not in season, there’s no practice. Now I want you to turn around and get out of my office and mind your own damn business! This club night, is gonna rule! Not according to the jerk at the record store. What are these auditions? Oh… I think Peyton’s having like an ‘All-Ages’ night at the… at Karen’s Club. She’s kinda looking for bands or something. - When do you go on? - Not! Stop it. Hales! It’s one thing to play at home for you, it’s another to get up in front of a crowd to do it and there’s no way. Nathan, letter came for you through my office. What is it? How the hell should I know?! Do I look like the damn postmaster general?! A meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes through the cloud of dust left behind by a comet, in its orbit of the sun. Here you go. Lucas, you’re wanted in the office. Take your books. Hey. Anna? What are you doing here? I’m sorry I didn’t call you after ‘Dare Night’. Give me a chance to explain. I mean, you owe me that. I owe you? I got you out of Science didn’t I? Where did you get this Hall Pass anyway? I swiped it, when I met the principle. Look, I’m sorry I blew you off. My brother’s kind of… overprotective. Because we haven’t gone to the same school in a few years and... Wait, Felix is your brother? Um… yeah. I figured you’d connect the dots sooner or later. Anyway... I told Felix that I hadn’t met any guys and… I don’t know, I just didn’t wanna have to deal with him so I didn’t call you. I’m sorry. I figured when Felix saw those pictures of us in the photo booth, he’d let you know who I was. You know, I still can’t figure if he’s screwing with me or what. I never gave him the pictures. Why? Because it wasn’t just about ‘Dare Night’ for me. Me neither. That’s a decaf latte with one shot of Irish cream. Thanks. Ah, you’ve been pouring me free coffee in the café a week, I figured I’d return the favour. Well unlike you I need an ‘A’, consider that coffee my apple. Um, so look. I was wondering if you were available tomorrow night, to… to watch the meteor shower. Just the two of us? Well I could… schedule a… class… felid trip if it makes you feel safer. Oh no no no. That’s not it. It’s just that… going back to school was a big step for me. And you’re afraid that you’ll screw it up. Like… I don’t know, dating your professor. Yes. Karen… I wouldn’t ask you to hang out with me if I thought it was gonna compromise your studies, or my job. You know, unless… unless you, you know, simply don’t wanna hang out with me - because that’s okay too. - Oh no, no no, I do. That’s... not it. Good. So... so what do you say? Tomorrow night? Okay. Good. Well I’ll leave you too it. Oh and, hey, I know it’s kinda short notice so… bring Lucas along if you can’t find a sitter. Love to meet the little guy. Oh I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem. Okay. Stars. To the human eye they appear very close together but as you know, in reality... ‘High Flyers’ is like this Allstar basketball boot camp. And this guy Milt West, he scouts the best players in the country and invites them down to Florida so they can work on their skills. And invited you. Wow. Nathan, I’m really happy for you. You deserve this you’ve… you’ve worked really hard. Okay, could it get any worse? My love life is non-existent, my parents are having a yard sale to sell everything that we own and I had to beg them to keep my car. Okay. You might not be rich but you are still Brooke Davis; the most popular, least studious girl in school. Maybe so, but being poor and horny is no way to go through life. How am I supposed to have fun? Boys won’t care about the poor part, just as long as you tell them about the horny part. To top it all off, if my parents go broke, I might actually have to study to get into college. My God the horror! I know! How the mighty have fallen. I think I need a little recess. What do you get when two, flaming, stellar bodies collide? Okay, here’s the thing; we are not dating, we are not going out, we are nothing. I am not your wife, your shrink, your mommy. There’s no romance, no crappy poetry, no PDA and no spooning. This is purely physical. If we have sex, it’s gonna be safe sex; we’re ‘Friends with Benefits’ and in fact, we don’t even need to talk. - I can live with that. - Great! So, there’s this new girl, named Anna, in my algebra class. She be the ‘Dare Night’ mystery girl? Yeah. Also happens to be Felix’s sister. Nice! D’you know bout that? Just found out this morning. Well don’t hold it against her man, she can’t help it if her brother’s an ass. So ‘High Flyers’? I mean, what I wouldn’t give, three months in Florida, playing basketball at that camp. Is it three months? Yeah, I think so. Why? That’s all summer. I mean, we can’t live for three months off Haley’s café paycheque. And even if we could, I mean I don’t wanna be apart from her that long. You guys will figure it out. Nathan, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity… you know that. What are you doing here? I just wanted to say hello. You’ve said it. Nathan got into ‘High Flyers’. And he couldn’t have done it without you so I… I just thought you’d care to know. Son! The mistake you’re making is - you think I care; about you, about the team, about anything. I lost the only thing I cared about a long time ago. You know, I have this picture in my room of the team… from your five-hundredth win. And the man in that photo still looks like a guy to me that still cares about something. We need you, Coach. Not just to win games, we need you in our lives! Have the surgery. Oh, I figured this summer out. I thought I would call Karen - see if I could stay with her and Lucas for a little while, till you get back or like, rent a room from her. We’ll save a ton. - Think she’ll go for that? - Oh please! Before you came along, I practically lived there anyway. - Then I’ll pick up some extra shifts at the café... - Haley, you work enough already. Hey, you’re gonna go to this camp if I have to sell a kidney. It’s only three months, I just… wish I could go to Florida with you. Isn’t this Brooke’s house? Hey! Be careful with that. It’s Venetian and I’m not talking Vegas! You finding anything? Uh, just this picture frame. - Just take it. - No, I insist. Thanks Mouth. - Hi! - Hey. I didn’t recognise the address. We won’t buy anything. It’s okay. We sold my pride around eight thirty. I’d rather see you wearing my clothes than any of these fifty year old wannabes. So I’ll give you the ‘Good Friend Discount’. Okay. Thanks. - I’m gonna go look around. - Okay. - How do you do it? - Do what? You gave up your family’s money to be poor, Nate. You know what they say Brooke; money can’t buy love. Maybe so. My mom sure had a good run; renting it for a while. Excuse me. What are you doing here? Pool’s closed today. You didn’t get my text message? Thought you might wanna… hang out. Okay; amendment to the rules – hook-ups will be initiated by me where and when I say and I say not here, not now! I’d like to buy this dollhouse. Oh no. It’s not for sale. But there’s a price tag on it; one fifty. Well it’s a misprint. The one should be a four. Four… fifty! You okay? My room - five minutes. You gotta hang your wrist. You know? Freeze after the release. Like Jordan did when he beat Utah in the finals. What about following the ball? Following the ball is following your miss. Right. You play? A little bit. We beat the crap out of our lady of peace every year. So… what d’ya say? Quick game of hog? How bout this; for every shot I hit… you tell me something about yourself. Okay. And what do I get when I win? What d’ya have in mind? I win… we watch the meteor shower together. And if I win? If you win, we watch the meteor shower together. Smells good in there. Oh I… brought some wine. Nah. I’m more of a beer girl. So this place is... it’s nice. Thanks! It’s early… American… garage sale. I have to say, you really know your way around a kitchen. Which is impressive since it’s not even yours. Thanks. You know, I would have invited you over to my place but everything’s still in boxes from when I moved back so... Charleston right? I guess I keep thinking if I don’t unpack then, you know, maybe the move still happens. Is that you oven timer? Actually… it’s the smoke alarm. Oh boy! You know what I’d love? I-HOP. Perfect. Okay… my confession is; I didn’t tell Felix I was coming here tonight. But I’m going to. I swear. Granny. From the free-throw line. Nice shot! Thank you. So whatta you got? I confess that I’m sometimes selfish. I don’t always give back as much as I get. Well, well. I believe that’s… H… O… G. And… did I win? Looks like you owe me one meteor shower. Why don’t we just call it ‘Club Suck’? Hey thank you, that was, that was… - Really… something. - Great. That was great. Um… we’ll… let you know. That was the last of them. Well, we can go with the balding wedding band, or the bad ballad guy. Great, so club no-name has no acts. Huh, Nathan just sent me an MP3. Nathan? Oh that’s ah, that a virus! You don’t wanna. Stop! Why did we even bother having auditions? Haley this is awesome! It’s... Oh, it’s the rude record store guy. Um, can you just put the CD’s by the side of the stage? Thank you. How many other songs have you written? I dunno. A few! Alright, well you’re gonna open. Uh, no! I’m not! I have… major stage fright. You learned an entire cheer routine in three hours and, you rock the house. Okay, with a group, I can not do it by myself. No! You’re gonna have to find someone else. I’m sorry. I think you just found your man. Hey, this is Peyton and you’re great! - Yeah I know. When do I play? - Um… well seven thirty... You’re okay but we had a lot of really good people show up today. - So… we’ll call you. - Whatever. Not Emo enough for you? Hey, I heard your song, it’s not bad. The key of ‘A’s kinda crap but… you pulled it off. Okay, are you out of your mind? He’s clearly the best. Yeah, he’s good but… he’s a jerk! And… he’s like… arrogant and self-righteous. Peyton, you’re not dating him. Just put the club first. I am. I don’t need him Haley, I’ve got you! Think about it, okay? You can do this. So I thought you said we were gonna watch the meteor shower from your yard. Um… actually, this is my yard. You’re kidding. You’re not kidding? No. I… I bought it a year ago. Its real-estate right? It’s good business. My house is about half a mile up that way. Well it’s… its very beautiful. Yeah. Yeah it’s a little of the south island and North Carolina, you know? So how does a New Zealander end up here anyway? Wow… let’s see... my dad died when I was fourteen and my mom figured we’d better move to the states before I turned into a rugby bum like him. And… did you know there’s a One Tree Hill in Auckland? - Yeah, I’ve heard that. - Yeah. It’s a volcano. Or it was twenty thousand years ago and now it’s a park. We used to picnic in it sometimes so when mom saw this tree Hill on the map - figured it was meant to be. So she raised you all by herself in a foreign country. She must be quite a woman. Yep, she is. I dunno, thinking back, I would have loved to have seen her do something like go back to school after dad died. You know? So she could get to live her own life rather than… always having to sacrifice so I could live mine. Table for two? Can’t believe they sold my dresser. Got anything to drink? Water, if the plumbing’s still hooked up. You sure you’re okay with this whole… ’Friends with Benefits’ thing? Why wouldn’t I be? You know, it’s just most girls I know – unable to hook up without the emotional entanglements. Well, try having your boyfriend hook up with your best friend and see if that’s not tangled enough for you. Lucas and Peyton? God, why am I even telling you this? I thought I made it clear; we don’t talk! If I wanted to have a conversation, I’d find someone with half a brain. Did I mention its ‘Friends with Benefits’? Hmm… don’t kid yourself. Your only advantage is that you live thirty seconds away. So, no friends. Not for me! Just ‘benefits’. Close the door on your way out. So now… Nathan and I are cool. And that makes Haley your… sister-in-law? Weird, but yeah. I thought I had a complicated relationship with my brother. Yeah, what is Felix’s deal anyway? He’s not as bad as he seems. So why didn’t you tell Felix about me? It just… never came up. Look Anna, I like you. And… I think… if we hang out… I’m just gonna like you more. But I don’t wanna sneak around. You gotta talk to Felix. You know, I never thought I’d have my brother, Dan, to thank for a night like this. Must be pretty different going from fixing cars to selling them. Nah. Truth is, I always had it in my plan. What d’ya mean? Well, I had the idea to open a dealership… long before Danny ever came round to it. I just didn’t have the capital. Then when I saved enough, Dan decided to open his own place, with his wife’s money. He stole your idea. Well you know, he had a family by then and… I hoped he would do right by his other son Lucas. So, I taught him everything I knew about cars. Well that was pretty selfless of you. Yeah well, I’d never have done it if I knew what an ass he was gonna become. Well, being a good guy has its own rewards. How were the auditions? You should not have given that music to Peyton. - She liked it didn’t she? - Yeah! But I’m mad! Hales, you wouldn’t hear it from me. Besides, I’m supposed to believe in you when you don’t believe in yourself. It’s what you’ve always done for me. Okay, I’m not mad anymore. So then you’ll play? I will, okay, maybe I will. Um, you know, when you get back form camp this fall? Yeah, about… camp. I didn’t get in. Well, what do you mean? They said it was a sure thing! Yeah I know but… it turns out they made a mistake and... there’s some other kid they have to give the spot to. - I’m sorry. - Yeah, me too. But hey, since I can’t go to this camp, that means you… can start playing your music now. Tell me that you will. Okay. Okay. I’ll try. - Oh did you see it! - No. Oh, blink and you’ll miss it. The meteors always streak from north to south. Right near Percius. Where’s that? Next to Andromeda. He’s protecting his wife. Right there, you see the figure of a woman? Oh, yeah. I see it now. She’s chained at the wrist, just like in the story. Um, it’s late. We should get back home. Well, we’ve had a lot to drink. Maybe we should spend the night here. I don’t have my things. I threw our overnight bags in the car. Just in case. I’ll take the guest room, of course. So. What time do you wanna sneak around tomorrow night? I’m gonna talk to him, okay? I promise. You understand where I’m coming from though, right? I mean, at a certain point, I gotta stop talking about wanting to be a different guy… and start being that guy. I do understand. And… I know you think you have to work at it, but you’re already a good guy, Luke. At least I think so. Get anything at the mall? Not really. That’s a first. I went out with a friend. You kiss all your friends? - You’ve been spying on me? - So you like Lucas? I don’t know Felix. It was just a first date. Half of the kids in this town were conceived on the first date. Look, I don’t know how much you know about him… but he’s done some things. That’s no secret. He told me that he screwed some things up! Yeah, Peyton – while he was dating Brooke. Look, he’ll do the same thing to you Anna. He’s a bad guy. No, he might have made a mistake but he’s not a bad guy. And I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. It’s be nice if you’d do the same for me. See, that’s how guys like that get away with this stuff. Girls like you, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Oh! You just took ten years off my life. It’s one o’clock in the morning. I have been worried sick. Where have you been? - I’m sorry, it just... - No, after midnight, you call. I really hope I don’t sound like that! How long have you been home? Oh, bout five minutes. Well then we’re both grounded. Clearly a rookie mom. Next time, try sneaking in the window. So, did you have a good time? Yeah, I did. Good. Hey. I’m making pancakes. Oh, I’m sorry, Dan, I’m going home. What’s the hurry? We’ll go back in a few hours. Oh, no we won’t. Coming out here was a mistake. I can’t… keep pretending that things are normal. You’re better now, so… I’ll send your things over. It’s the doctor. - Dan Scott! - Hi Dan, this is Doctor Connelly. I just received your test results back from the lab. You’re doing really well and we can now start talking about a more strenuous exercise programme. I see. So call my office and set up an appointment. Thank you doctor, I will. Thank you. It’s not good. I’m gonna have to stay with you for a while. Come in! - Hey man. - Hey. Wanna help me with this table? I’m rearranging so Haley has more room to practice. - Yeah man, where do you want it? - Right there. So Haley told me you didn’t get into ‘High Flyers’ after all. Tough break. Yeah, it’s too bad. You did get in. Nathan, man you’ve been working for your whole life for this. You can’t say no. You know what it’s like to hit a game winning shot. The whole crowd loves you… everybody treats you like you’re a star. I get to feel that every time I play. I mean, you know, you’ve felt it. Now, it’s Haley’s turn. I mean she’s an incredible musician, Luke, and she’s ready to give it a shot. So if I got to camp now, for three months, who knows where her head’s gonna be. I just really want her to feel, like, the thrill of the crowd. She deserves it. Well what about your future? I already know my future. It’s with Haley. Welcome to ‘TRIC’. - Nice space. - Oh, Rick. Here you’re looking for bands. Suppose we’re working together after all. I guess… we’ll be partying together too. Mouth! I… I knew this meant a lot to you. So, I got the address off the woman’s cheque and… I bought it back. Thank you. Yeah! Hey Dan, Milt West from ‘High Flyers’. Uh… your son, turned me down. So, what? You saying he’s not going to the camp? You told me you could make this happen. Says he doesn’t wanna be away from his wife. Sorry. So I… I want you to know that I met somebody. Well that’s cool. So did I. Well, mine’s younger than me. I mean a lot younger. Okay. Well if he’s younger than me, I’m not calling him dad. Oh, this came for you. Synchro : Amariss
