My sister, quinn, got married by a friend of hers Who got ordained on the internet in like 30 seconds. Is that even legal? yeah. Anybody who's ordained can sign a marriage license. The ceremony's just symbolic. huh. How cool -- don't you think that would be so awesome, To get married by a friend of yours, Somebody who's known you most of your life? I do. Sweet! who should we get? You. Y-- me? Come on, you're my best friend and peyton loves you and... I just ordained you. [ gasps ] So, uh, god, you're gonna be great, you know that?

As much as i love a wedding, I love you and your baby more. If anything happens to me, I want you to take care of lucas... If when the baby comes, if anything happens, okay? Nothing's gonna happen. brooke. You shouldn't talk like that. Honey, we have to talk like this. Okay? everybody else has avoided it. I just really need you to hear me out. Okay.

I've been kind of busy, And he's working on a new movie, you know? Are you scared? I'm scared i'm gonna miss it all -- My life with lucas and the baby... And my friends and my family... ...and you. [ crying ] it's not fair.

[ laughs ] Check, check, 1, 2. check, check. Chase adams, you look hot. Get over here and kiss me. [ chuckles ] My boy looks good in a suit. Boy's gonna wear a suit more often. [ chuckles ] So, what's your take on weddings, catalano? Hmm. big fan. you? Mm. more of a reception guy. Awkward family members, open bar. Slutty wedding sex. Totally slutty wedding sex.

Hey, adams, play your cards right, It might be you having the slutty wedding sex. [ chuckles softly ] Got to wear more suits. [ chuckles ] Knock, knock! Hey. Hi. you look nice. well, thank you. Now, get out of that ratty thing And try on one of these tuxes. I didn't know exactly what size you were Because i couldn't ask peyton 'cause i want to surprise her. Brooke, you didn't have to do that. i know. But if a girl's gonna have a last-minute shotgun wedding, The least her boy can do is rock a little hugo boss. Now go. I will wait. Hmm. [ laughs ] All right. ?you know ? ?things never turn out the way i want them to ? ?but we're all, all born innocent ? Hell of a view. [ laughing ] hey. Yeah, it's really beautiful out here, isn't it? i didn't mean that view. Ohh, i was worried about you. did your practice run late? Yeah. oh.

Lucas, you cannot do that to me. First of all, i am not anybody's pity date, And second... What does he look like? [ chuckles ] Oh, the girls really seem to like him. Who is it? is he hot? Uh... I'm just gonna go over here now. Julian: from the look on your face, I take it lucas didn't tell you he invited me. No, but it's good to see you. I guess now it'll look like we both actually had dates. Yeah, actually, the thing is -- Julian, we should probably -- brooke, hi! Brooke, you remember -- missy, the other me -- of course. Hi. Come on, baby. we should probably get a seat. Yeah, okay, one sec. No, she's right. you should go. It's good to see you. i'm so scared. oh God, i'm so scared. Skills: mouth. Sorry. Honey, you're just supposed to film the wedding, okay? It's a happy day. think happy. I am so pissed right now! that whore stole my man! Okay, but it's their wedding day, So don't you think it's time you let it go? Not peyton, you dork. missy. Who is missy? missy me -- the other brooke from the movie.</i> Oh, sure, right. Yeah, i have no idea what you're talking about. Okay, focus. Julian is here. He brought missy, that little slut actress, As his date. He's unbelievable. what is he thinking? That you said no. Would the bride like to wear red today? I can't believe i'm gonna be eight months' pregnant on my wedding day. Can i talk you into 8? with a real minister? Haley, you are gonna be great, all right? Just speak from the heart. And if you get in trouble, go with song lyrics, Like, um... "after the fire, after all the rain, I will be the flame." That's pretty good. Cheap trick. You look beautiful, peyton. Thank you. I have to pee. Mmm. I always liked that cheap trick song. Yeah. it's good. it's good. Mouth: there's the altar haley put together. That's happy. There's skills hitting on jamie's teacher, miss lauren. They're clearly planning on having slutty wedding sex, And that's...happy. Hey, guys, say hi to the camera. Hey. What's crackin', luke and peyton? Hey, it's about time this thing goin' down. Man, we've been waiting since our days back on the river court, Back when luke used to talk about How nathan wasn't good enough for p. sawyer And how he planned on stealing her away. I remember luke used to talk so much trash about nathan, man. Okay, i think we're good. Hey, lauren. hey. So, uh, how's jamie? Man, jamie scott on lockdown, bro. Um, antwon... [ laughs ] That damn kid -- ...is a genius. Hey, macaulay, this is denzel. where the hell you at? Hey. [ laughs ] [ exhales sharply ] hey, handsome. [ both sigh ] You okay? Yeah. No, not really, actually. They called up nino. [ groans ] Clippers were looking at both of us. They decided they needed more scoring. I'm sorry, baby. The thing is, I taught nino how to play shooting guard. I fed him the ball. And now he's in the nba, and i'm...not. You were being a good teammate, And somebody's gonna see that. The chiefs have never sent Two guys to the pros in the same year. Okay. I'm sorry, hales. Hey, stop it. you don't have anything to apologize for. You do great. We're proud of you. we're proud of you every day. Okay? Okay. All right. i love you. I love you. There's the groom. Mouth: cold feet, luke? you hiding from peyton? No. brooke. Why brooke? Because i invited julian, and he brought a date. Ouch. I'll, uh, edit that part out. Hey. hey. [ instrumental music plays ] D'accord, c'est Ã  nous. Whatever i said before lindsey's wedding, just go with that. God, you suck at this. [ chuckles ] Wow, the minister's hot. Hey, shh! [ laughs ] Mia: slutty wedding sex. Stop it. Just saying -- considering your history, She might want another 30 seconds in heaven from you. [ music continues ] 45 seconds -- And every single one of them outstanding, thank you. You look beautiful, brooke. Hotter than julian's skanky brooke-a-like, right? Right?! Yeah, totally. right. absolutely. [ wagner's "bridal chorus" plays ] Okay, um, you can sit, everyone. Wow. Well, we are gathered here today before god and nature To join lucas scott and peyton sawyer In holy matrimony. Nice work, hales. Thank you. Now, some of you may be wondering Where the word "matrimony" comes from. Well, interestingly enough, the word "matrimony" Is from the latin root word for "motherhood," Which i think is really appropriate today. [ laughs ] [ coughs ] [ both laugh ] Well, the thing is that, uh, every, um... Rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song. Poison? of all the lyrics ever written, You're gonna go with "every rose has its thorn" by poison? I'm sorry, i'm sorry. oh, i just -- i don't -- Really, skills? Jamie scott! Macaulay! Boy, get your ass back over here. You're killing me, man. [ laughter ] Okay. oh, wait a minute. Ohh, uh... "peyton sawyer will become peyton scott." Lucas wrote this in the 8th grade. I remember him talking about her constantly, And not just in the 8th grade, in the 9th grade And the 10th grade and 11th grade. And, finally, in our junior year, Lucas gathered up his courage And talked to peyton for the first time Right here at this lake... And she was a bitch. [ laughter ] He said, "haley, i talked to her!" And when i asked him if the fantasy was finally over, If he could finally admit That peyton sawyer was human after all, He said, "no. "peyton sawyer is not human. "she's an angel. And she's my angel." I believe in true love. I believe in love at first sight. I believe love conquers all. And that doesn't mean there's not gonna be hard days Or difficult things to deal with, because there will be. But finding that person who does it for you And knowing that that person loves you back -- It just makes everything so much easier. "peyton sawyer will become peyton scott." That was the dream. And here we are 10 years later, And we all get to witness today a dream come true. Okay, luke. ?darling, so it goes ? ?some things were meant to be ? Peyton... I've loved you since the first time i saw you. And this ring and these words Are just simply a way to show the rest of the world What has been in my heart for as long as i've known you. I love you... Peyton elizabeth sawyer. [ laughs ] I always have, and... I always will. [ breathes deeply ] [ laughs ] Lucas scott... We've been through so much together. And despite how confused i've been Or lost i might have gotten, There was always you... Finding me and saving me. You deserve to be adored, So that's what we're gonna do -- your baby and me. [ crying ] we are going to adore you for years to come. I am so terribly in love with you. And i always will be. ?falling in love, in love with you ? Well... By the power vested in me by oneminuteminister.com... [ both laugh ] ...i know pronounce you man and wife. Lucas scott, you may kiss your bride. Finally. [ applause ] ?falling in love ? ?falling in love ? ?with you ? [ chuckles ] Well, well, nick lachey. Brooke davis. Sounds good in here. thank you, thank you. But, uh, you just kind of ruined it. Oh, i'm sorry. i just haven't seen you in forever. And i wanted to come say hi. Well, i'm glad you did. you look great. Thanks. you too. Perfect. okay. I'm gonna need you to go ahead and put that on. [ laughs ] wh-- Okay? ?oh oh oh ? ?ooh ooh ooh ? ?oh oh oh ? ?ooh ooh ooh ? ?so you see ? ?you've got me back again for more ? ?and it seems ? ?your song is in my head ? ?this is war ? ?mystery ? ?how i could feel you breathe me ? ?i was sure ? Lucas... congratulations, my man. What the hell were you thinking bringing movie brooke, huh? I'm thinking movie brooke is the only brooke that likes me. Maybe so, but i invited you to be real brooke's date. And she's gonna lose her mind. Why? did she say something? You're trying to make her jealous, aren't you? Am not. [ laughing ] right. Luke, you invited me to your wedding. i brought a date. that's it. Hey, lucas, congratulations. hey. Mm-hmm. Aw, somebody has a type. Luke, julian, i'd like you to meet my date, nick lachey. Hey. nick lachey. Hi. julian: hi. how are you, man? Oh, my god. Yeah. hi. Missy, come on. but -- But -- bye. So, who got married? Unbelievable. i know, right? She's so not making me jealous With the guy from "dancing with the stars." No, that was drew. he was so awesome on that. Whatever. "laguna beach," then. No, that was some other tool. So, i guess nick lachey's gonna be pretty happy tonight. Brooke davis, slutty wedding sex. Okay, just -- just a little. Um, champagne makes me a little wild. ?hey ? [ laughs ] Oops. oh, okay. [ both laugh ] We need to talk. I'm having a little problem with you and miss lauren. Wait, jamie, you're the one that fixed us up in the first place. I thought you was okay with this? I thought i was, too, But first granny deb and now my teacher? I don't know, skills. I'm...sorry, bro. I never meant to hurt you. You really like this girl, huh? I do. a lot. Okay, but just stay away from madison. [ chuckles ] ?that you left me hanging ? ?like you did ? ?it was brave ? So, i remember everyone was totally rooting for stacy keibler, But i thought that drew was, by far, The better dancer and cuter, too. Cool. i'll, uh -- i'll be sure to tell him. Julian: sorry about that. I was just hanging with the guys at the bar. Like who? Oh, you know, just my boys. We're like a gang of guys, you know, Just a band of boys, really. Like a boy band. Hmm. So, julian, how'd you and missy meet? They met on a movie. oh, yeah? A failed movie, actually. Have i mentioned how great your new song is? I totally think it's gonna be a hit. Is it hot in here? yeah, it's like crazy-hot in here. It must be like, what, 98 degrees? Ow. What's with guys in tree hill punching me? You teased him about his boy band. Well, yeah. You used to love them. I know. [ laughs ] That guy is so cool. How -- how the hell am i supposed to compete with that? Um... [ sighs ] [ exhales sharply ] Did she tell you what happened? Not really. And that's how i know it must be really hard for her. She tends to struggle through the big stuff all by herself. I miss her so much, peyton. Well, maybe you should tell her that. I got to get back out there. You cleaned up pretty nice today, sawyer. I'm happy for you. Talk to her. Aah. Haley said you came out to get some air. I thought you might want to talk. She told you. Nah, i got it off the wire at the station. Sorry, man. You know, i'm happy for nino. i hope he sticks. It's not about that. Sure. Listen, i, uh, called the chiefs to get a quote, And they asked me if i had seen you. They said you were unexcused from practice. Yeah, the wedding was last-minute. I wanted to be there for luke. Bobby just didn't see it that way. Is that all it was? I don't know, mouth. Maybe this was all just a pipe dream That i needed to let go of at some point, Get on with my life in the real world, you know? Well, i'm around if you need anything. Thanks, man. I'll see you in there. Nate, for what it's worth, If i could play the game like you can, I'd play wherever i could Till they wouldn't let me play anymore. Thanks, mouth. How are you feeling? Like a princess. [ both laugh ] Look, i know it's not exactly how we planned it. It's better. You feeling okay? i mean, the doctor said -- I'm fine. I'm better than fine... husband. [ both laugh ] Mia: hey, everybody. First, i just wanted to say congratulations To lucas and peyton. [ applause ] This song is called "sweet silver lining," And it's about being brave In the face of obstacles and pressures and the unknown. And i wrote it for the bride, who's also my boss and friend. [ intro plays ] Come on and dance with me. Hey, you know what the doctor said. Dance with me, you fool, or i will go find julian. Fine. i'm gonna go ask nick lachey to dance. [ both laugh ] ?...home ? ?downhearted and hoping ? ?i'm close ? Buy me a drink, sailor? I never drink with the clergy. How about a dance, then? Come on. ?there's a reason for everything ? ?that comes and goes ? ?but so many people are looking to me ? ?to be strong and fight ? ?but i'm just surviving ? ?and i may be weak, but i'm never defeated ? ?and i'll keep believing ? ?in clouds with that sweet silver lining ? ?and most days ? ?i try my best ? ?to put on a brave face ? ?but inside ? ?my bones are cold, and my heart breaks ? Let's dance. ?something's keeping me safe and alive ? ?but so many people are looking to me ? ?to be strong and to fight ? Nathan, be here with me. I'm sorry. You do look beautiful tonight. Yeah. Come here. ?and i won't give up like this ? ?i will be given strength ? ?now that i've found it ? ?oh, nothing can take that way ? ?so many people are looking to me ? Haley, what are you doing? Kiss me. Oh, haley james scott, this is a women's bathroom, You're a teacher, and your son is out there. The door's locked, i'm not a teacher anymore, And our son is dancing. Now kiss me. I don't care if you're not in the nba. You are my husband, and you are so damn sexy to me. ?...never defeated ? ?and i'll keep believing ? ?in clouds with that sweet silver lining ? ?oh, yeah ? ?sweet silver lining ? ?ohh, yeah, ohh, yeah ? Brooke, i'm gonna take off. Are you sure? why? I think you've made julian jealous enough, don't you? Is it really that obvious? It is when you kiss me. and you forget -- i've had a real brooke davis kiss.</i> I can't believe that guy ruined it for me. It makes me want to punch him all over again. [ laughs ] Thank you. Yeah. I'll just, uh -- i'll just leave the tux with haley, okay? Okay. Oh, brooke, i know julian left with missy, But he's clearly still into you. You think so? Oh, yeah. good night. So, i guess that's another date gone wrong. What do you mean? Our dates. the damn kids. [ both laugh ] Deb broke up with me because she said i should have kids. After our last two dates... man, i don't even like kids. You are lying. You love jamie so much, and he loves you back. And i think a guy who appreciates kids is so sexy. Hmm, really? oh, yeah. You know, the date's not over yet. You still got that leash? [ both laugh ] Julian: can i have this dance? No, thank you. You either dance with me or say you love me -- It's your choice. I thought so. I thought you left. Nah. i was just avoiding you and nick lachey... And putting ice on my eye. What happened to missy? She left. I, um... [ chuckles ] ...accidentally called her "brooke" at the bar. [ laughs ] How's sammy? I don't know. She, uh... Went to live with her birth mom. Oh. I'm sorry. that must have been hard for you. And sam, too. i mean, you know she loves you. Yeah. I wish you would have called and told me. You know what? i'm sorry, julian. I can't do this. What? you can't dance with me? I can't -- i just -- I miss you. My girl was kind of dirty tonight. She was not. She was. But i liked it. I skipped practice to be here today. I didn't want to miss the wedding, you know? I'm getting tired of missing everything else. Are you really getting tired of missing everything, Or is your ego just bruised because nino got called up? I'm getting tired of failing. [ sighs ] Come here. ?so we lie here in the dark ? ?all the wrong things on fire ? That little boy's hero is his father. The rest doesn't matter. ?to be with you ? ?just to be with you ? ?in your wedding dress ? ?to have and to hold ? You blew it up tonight, you little rock-star goof. Did you have a good time? Yeah. i'm a little bummed, though. I don't think anybody actually had slutty wedding sex. Well, not yet. Right. 30 seconds of heaven. Ha ha. 45. [ chuckles ] Bourbon is a good, honest drink. No, it's not. Saw you dancing with brooke. Didn't you have a date? Yeah. She did, too, right? What happened to them? Oh, my god, you look just like drew. And you totally look like brooke. Brooke. Hi. I saw the light on. i thought maybe brooke was here. I'm julian. Of course you are. Victoria davis. [ laughs ] Of course you are. Would you ask brooke to call me, please? You do realize the name of the company Is clothes over bros, yes? My father always made me feel like i wasn't good enough. Anytime i had any success, He would remind me of my failures. I see that in brooke. She's so talented and good-hearted and beautiful, But she carries around this feeling That she's not good enough. And she has you to thank for that. Nice work. Are you finished? No. not yet. I love your daughter. I'm in love with her. And one of these days, she's gonna love me back. And when she does, i want you to understand something. You're either gonna learn to be nice to her... Or you won't be in her life. It was nice to meet you, victoria. Feels like i've known you all my life. ?just to be with you ? ?in your wedding dress ? ?to have and... ? Okay. you ready? This feels vaguely familiar. Uh-huh. All right. And open. [ laughs ] Lucas scott, it is beautiful. Well, thank you, peyton scott. Say that again. Peyton...scott. Oh, god, i love the way that sounds. We should get you to bed. It's been a long day. come on. It's been a perfect day. [ laughs ] I think you could handle maybe just... One more surprise. What? i didn't get you anything. It doesn't matter. Just wait right here, okay? Stay. [ laughs ] Hey... ...i love you, peyton scott. [ laughs ] ?let go ? ?thought i'd lost you ? ?thought i'd lost you ? ?i gave you away ? ?thought i'd lost you ? ?i'm jealous of the moon for how it moves the waves ? ?in your wedding dress ? ?to have and to ho-o-o-ld ? ?even at my best ? ?i want to let go ? ?go ? [ door opens ] Hey, peyton! Oh, ms. scott? Peyton! Oh, god. No, no! Oh! ohh!
