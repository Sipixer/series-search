?? MY NAME IS LUCAS SCOTT. I'M A SENIOR  AT TREE HILL HIGH SCHOOL. TREE HILL IS JUST A PLACE  SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. MAYBE IT'S  A LOT LIKE YOUR WORLD. MAYBE IT'S NOTHING LIKE IT. BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER... YOU MIGHT SEE  SOMEONE LIKE YOU OR SOMEONE  LIKE MY BEST FRIEND,HALEY. IF YOU'RE MARRIED,A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND NOT SURE  IF YOUR HUSBAND IS STILL ALIVE, THEN I'D SAY YOUR WORLD  IS A LOT LIKE HALEY'S. TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO  BE THE BEST DAY OF HER LIFE. BUT IT'S AMAZING HOW THINGS CAN  CHANGE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE OR,IN THIS CASE,IN ABOUT 29 MINUTES. WHAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT RACHEL GOT DRUNK AND STOLE OUR WEDDING LIMO. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR UNCLE COOPER SLEPT WITH RACHEL. SHE'S 17. WHAT IS HE,LIKE 30? HE MUST NOT HAVE KNOWN. I MEAN,HE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN,RIGHT? WHEN WE SLEPT TOGETHER THAT NIGHT,YOU KNEW I WAS 17. RACHEL,ENOUGH. MAYBE IT COULD WORK,COOPER. YOU KNOW? WE'RE GOOD TOGETHER. MAYBE THE AGE DIFFERENCE DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOES MATTER,ALL RIGHT? NOW,LISTEN TO ME.WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS LIMOUSINE BACK TO THE RECEPTION, AND THEN YOU AND I NEVER HAPPENED. ISN'T THERE ANYTHING I CAN SAY TO KEEP YOU,COOPER? NO. I'M SORRY,THERE'S NOT. WELL,THAT'S TOO BAD. BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I'M PREGNANT. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. PULL OVER. NO,I'M NOT LETTING YOU OUT OF THIS CAR UNTIL WE TALK ABOUT THIS. NO! HEY! GET YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL! I SAID,"PULL OVER!" LOOK OUT! THAT WAS COOPER. COOPER! COOPER! HALEY,CALL 911. NATHAN,DON'T! I LOVE YOU. DON'T. NATHAN! NATHAN! NATHAN! OH,GOD. HELP ME! HELP,PLEASE! OH,STOP! STOP! OH,LUCAS! COOPER WENT OVER THE BRIDGE,AND NATHAN JUMPED OVER, AND HE HASN'T COME UP FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. NATHAN! OH,GOD. NATHAN! OH,GOD,NATHAN. DID YOU CALL 911? I DID! I CALLED! HELP HIM,LUKE! NATHAN! IT'S COOPER! I CAN'T FIND THEM! WHAT?! I CAN'T FIND THEM! WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE'S DOWN THERE. NO,THE CAR IS EMPTY. NATHAN! NATHAN! NATHAN! I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE LATELY ALL I HAVE TO DO IS THINK OF ME AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE LATELY ALL I HAVE TO DO IS THINK OF ME AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND I'M TIRED OF LOOKING 'ROUND ROOMS WONDERING WHAT I GOTTA DO OR WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN ME I CAN'T FIND HIM! NATHAN! NATHAN! NATHAN! OH,MY GOD. HALEY,DON'T LOOK. OH,GOD! NATHAN! THINGS THAT TAKE 14 MINUTES --  BOILING AN OSTRICH EGG, MICHAEL JACKSON'S  "THRILLER" VIDEO. IT ALSO TAKES 14 MINUTES  TO GET FROM THE MOLINA BRIDGE TO TREE HILL HOSPITAL. IN THOSE 14 MINUTES,THREE  LIVES HUNG IN THE BALANCE. FOR THE REST OF US,THERE WAS  NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT. I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT  "THE WAITING ROOM." SOMEONE SHOULD CALL DAN. DAN SCOTT IS MANY THINGS -- THE MAYOR OF TREE HILL, A ONCE-GREAT  HIGH-SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYER, AND NATHAN'S FATHER. HE'S ALSO MY FATHER,BUT HE NEVER CLAIMED ME. BELIEVE IT OR NOT,I GOT  THE BETTER END OF THE DEAL. I WAS INSTEAD RAISED BY MY MOM WITH HELP  FROM MY UNCLE KEITH... UNTIL KEITH'S LIFE WAS TAKEN. YOU ARE NO LONGER MY BROTHER,YOU SON OF A BITCH. YOU DO NOT EXIST TO ME. HEY,ANY NEWS,MOM? WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS PREGNANCY. KEITH WOULD BE SO HAPPY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HAVING HIS BABY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT PREGNANCY. WHOSE TEST DID YOU FIND AT THE RECEPTION? WAS IT BROOKE'S? I'M NOT SURE YET. I'M YOUR MOTHER,LUCAS. AND CONSIDERING THAT I WAS PREGNANT AT 17, I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF WITH MY SON AND HIS GIRLFRIEND. NATHAN'S AWAKE. SO,WHAT,THE WEDDING WASN'T ENOUGH? YOU NEEDED EVEN MORE ATTENTION? THANK YOU,LUKE. FOR WHAT? FOR SAVING MY LIFE. I JUST GOT COOPER TO SHORE,MAN. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAVED EVERYBODY. YOU'RE A HERO,NATE. HELP ME! HALEY! IF I SAY I LOVE YOU, WILL YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME? BROOKE,I THINK I STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR LUCAS. YOU'RE A BACKSTABBING,TWO-FACED BITCH,PEYTON. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED,THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER. AND IF WE NEVER SPEAK AGAIN FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES, THAT WILL BE FINE. YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE OH,NO I MUST BECOME AGAIN OH,NO I MUST BE GETTING SO OH,ELIAS,YOUR BRAIN'S ON FIRE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS YOU KILLED ME. SHUT UP,YOU LITTLE SMART-ASS GHOST. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MY SUGAR GOD I WAS IN LOVE NOW I'M ALONE,ALL ALONE ON THE COUNTRYSIDE WHAT AM I DOING? NO. I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS. YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE. YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE YOU MADE THE WRONG MAYOR SCOTT,IT'S THE POLICE. YOU,UH,CAUGHT ME RED-HANDED. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,MAYOR,BUT YOUR SON'S HAD AN ACCIDENT. WHICH ONE? MAYOR SCOTT,DO YOU KNOW HOW BADLY HURT YOUR SON IS? MAYOR,WILL THIS AFFECT HIS BASKETBALL CAREER? I APPRECIATE CONCERN FOR NATHAN,BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST A WORRIED FATHER WHO NEEDS TO SEE HIS SON. LUKE. HEY,SKILLS. WHAT'S UP,MAN? BEVIN HEARD ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. HOW ARE NATHAN AND HALEY DOING? I THINK THEY'LL BE OKAY. COOL. HOW ABOUT YOU? I'M FINE. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? 'CAUSE BEVIN HEARD YOU AND BROOKE HAD A LITTLE FRICTION AT THE WEDDING. MAN,YOU KNOW BEVIN BE HEARING THINGS,DAWG. LOOK,UH,BROOKE KIND OF FOUND OUT THAT I KISSED PEYTON... AGAIN. WOW. WELL,IT'S A GOOD THING YOU IN THE HOSPITAL 'CAUSE YOUR SORRY ASS IN BAD SHAPE,BRO. THANKS. IT WAS THE SCHOOL SHOOTING. PEYTON WAS SCARED. SHE KISSED ME,AND I LET HER. WELL,LOOK,JUST IN CASE BROOKE DECIDES TO SHOW UP, I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING TOO CLOSE TO YOU. LOOK,IF YOU NEED SOMETHING,DAWG,CALL ME. SAME GO FOR HALEY. LUCAS. AND TRY NOT TO MAKE OUT WITH HER,PLEASE. HEY,HOW'S NATHAN? IS HE OKAY? YEAH. I THINK SO. HE'S AWAKE. RACHEL AND COOPER ARE STILL UNCONSCIOUS. I'M SORRY. PEYTON SAWYER IS A GOOD FRIEND. BROOKE DAVIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND. AT LEAST,FOR NOW SHE IS. SLUT. BITCH. WHORE. WELL,I KNOW I'M NOT IN HEAVEN 'CAUSE THEY'D NEVER LET BROOKE DAVIS' SKANKY ASS THROUGH THE GATES. AND YOUR ASS WOULDN'T FIT,AT LEAST NOT THE OLD ONE. HOW ARE YOU? IS COOPER OKAY? I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED? WE WERE ARGUING. ABOUT WHAT? I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT. BUT I LIED. I'M NOT PREGNANT. I JUST WANTED TO SCARE HIM. BROOKE. I TRIED TO CALL YOU. YEAH,I KNOW. I CAME AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR VOICE MAIL. I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY. AFTER YOU LEFT THE RECEPTION,I FOUND YOUR PURSE AND... IT HAD A PREGNANCY TEST IN IT. WE ALL GOT THE SAME PURSE AS WEDDING GIFTS. IT HAD THAT PERFUME YOU WEAR. LOOK,THE TEST WASN'T... I'M NOT PREGNANT,OKAY? I PROMISE. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I JUST WANT TO GO HOME. YEAH,SURE. I UNDERSTAND. HOW ABOUT YOU,HALEY? NOT EXACTLY THE HONEYMOON YOU PLANNED. IT'S OKAY. LONDON CAN WAIT. HOW'S THE KNEE,DOC? OH,IT'LL BE FINE,JUST SORE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. I'D LIKE TO RUN A COUPLE OF TESTS,IF YOU DON'T MIND. YEAH. UH,DEB,DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE? WE,UH,HAVEN'T EXACTLY... ...TALKED ABOUT YOUR CONFESSION,HAVE WE? YOU TRIED TO KILL ME IN THE DEALERSHIP FIRE. GO AHEAD,SCREAM FOR SOMEONE TO ENFORCE YOUR LITTLE RESTRAINING ORDER. WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU. YOU SON OF A BITCH. THAT WOULD BE NATHAN. YOU SEE,HE'S THE SON. YOU'RE THE BITCH. YOU LISTEN TO ME. NO,YOU LISTEN TO ME. YOU DON'T KNOW THE HELL YOU UNLEASHED WHEN YOU BLEW IT, AND NOW IT'S MY TURN. SO YOU BE AFRAID,DEB. BE MORE THAN AFRAID. IT'S OKAY. I'VE GOT IT. I WAS GONNA SURPRISE YOU WHEN WE GOT BACK. IT'S THE LONDON BRIDGE. THANK YOU. IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T GO. I MEAN,THE WEDDING WASN'T CHEAP. NOW WE'VE GOT NEW FURNITURE TO PAY FOR. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THOSE HOSPITAL BILLS, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. OH,GOD! HALEY! IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE SAFE. YOU'RE HOME NOW. HEY,UM... BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO TELL ME. I GOT ACCEPTED TO STANFORD. WELL,I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,HALES. EVEN THOUGH WE JUST SPENT YOUR TUITION MONEY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER. HEY. EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH,UH,NATHAN'S HOME,AND RACHEL'S AWAKE. WE'RE JUST WAITING ON COOPER. LOOKING FOR BROOKE? SORT OF,YEAH. I SAW HER AT THE HOSPITAL, AND SHE SAID THAT SHE KIND OF WENT OFF ON YOU. OH,YEAH. SHE PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME TO GO BROOKE MYSELF. I'M SORRY,PEYTON. I MEAN,I DIDN'T THINK THAT KISS MEANT ANYTHING, BUT,APPARENTLY TO BROOKE,IT MEANT EVERYTHING. SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE,DID SHE, ABOUT ME OR...US? LIKE WHAT? NOTHING. IS THAT LETTER FROM HER? ACTUALLY,NO. YOU REMEMBER WHEN ELLIE CAME TO TOWN AND TOLD ME SHE WAS MY BIRTH MOTHER? IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN. WAIT,YOU HAVE A THIRD MOTHER? NO. NOT EXACTLY. WH-- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? FROM AN ALBUM SHE LEFT,ONE OF HER FAVORITES. IF THIS IS TRUE -- YEAH. APPARENTLY,I HAVE A BROTHER. I'M SO SORRY. I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE INEBRIATED. SEVERAL WITNESSES SAY YOU MADE A BIT OF A SCENE AT THE RECEPTION, SAID YOU WERE PRETTY UPSET WITH HIM. NOW,WHEN YOU'RE UP TO IT, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TAKE YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT BRIDGE. I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED TO HEAR HOW A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER COULD JUST LOSE CONTROL OF A VEHICLE LIKE THAT. I MEAN,I HAVE MY THEORY,BUT,FOR YOUR SAKE, YOU BETTER HOPE HE WAKES UP AND TELLS ME THAT I'M WRONG. SMELL THAT,FERGIE? HMM? IT SMELLS LIKE... A BASKET BY SKILLS AND A VISIT BY LUCAS SCOTT -- BOTH RARE OCCURRENCES. HEY,YO,MOUTH,STAY OFF THE CRACK PIPE,DAWG. WHAT'S UP,BABY? GOOD,BROTHER. HOW'S NATE? HE'LL BE OKAY. WHAT ABOUT RACHEL? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET? I THINK SHE'LL BE OKAY. NO WORD ON COOPER YET,THOUGH. SO,LOOK,I GOT A FAVOR TO ASK YOU. I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUT MONEY KIND OF TIGHT RIGHT NOW. ANYWAY,I KNOW YOU HAD TO LEAVE THE TEAM BECAUSE OF YOUR HEART CONDITION AND ALL THAT, BUT I WAS THINNG MAYBE THE RAVENS COULD USE ANOTHER SHOOTING GUARD. YOU WANT TO JOIN THE RAVENS? IF IT'S GONNA GET ME A SCHOLARSHIP. LOOK,I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE A RUN IN THE POSTSEASON, AND SOMEBODY MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO SEE ME PLAY. YOU KNOW,A SMALL D2,JUCO,WHATEVER. I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD TALK TO WHITEY FOR ME. ABSOLUTELY. LOOK,I JUST WANT A TRYOUT,DAWG. I'M NOT ASKING FOR NO SPECIAL TREATMENT OR NOTHING. I HEAR YOU,MAN. I WAS THERE. I'LL TALK TO WHITEY. COOL. YOU'RE LOOKING OUT. MAY I? HOW'S NATHAN? I DON'T KNOW,REALLY. YOU'D HAVE TO ASK MY EX-WIFE. WHOSE FAULT IS THAT? YEAH,FAIR ENOUGH. AND COOPER? COOPER WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF HE DIED IN HIS SLEEP. EVERY TIME THAT IMMATURE PUNK COMES TO TOWN, MY SON ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL. HOPEFULLY,HE'LL BE OKAY. KAREN,WOULD IT BE THE STRANGEST OF THINGS IF WE GOT A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME? I'VE GIVEN UP COFFEE THROUGH MY PREGNANCY. A MOVIE THEN? NO. YOU'VE GIVEN UP MOVIES,TOO? NO,I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO WITH YOU. KAREN,I -- I JUST,UH... I WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU. I KNOW I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU AND LUCAS. BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RAISE ANOTHER CHILD ON YOUR OWN. I DIDN'T RAISE LUCAS ALONE. I HAD KEITH. THE CAR CRASHED  THROUGH THE GUARDRAIL... HELLO? I'M SORRY,NO COMMENT. WHY DO ALL THE HARDEST DAYS SEEM TO LAST THE LONGEST? IS IT POSSIBLE WE ONLY RENEWED OUR WEDDING VOWS THIS MORNING? IT FEELS LIKE ANOTHER LIFE AGO. IF IT WASN'T FOR NATHAN SCOTT, THIS ACCIDENT  COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. HEY. WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE AT THE RIVER? CAN YOU TELL ME? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,NATHAN. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. I DON'T THINK SO,HALEY. TODAY,FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME... IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. CODE BLUE! CODE BLUE! NATHAN,YOU'RE A HERO. YOU DID EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD. CODE BLUE. CARDIAC ARREST. PULSE RAPIDLY DEENDING. DID I? WE'RE LOSING HIM. LET'S HAVE A HIGH DOSE OF EPI. PREPARE TO DEFIBRILLATE. CLEAR. NO RESPONSE. PUSH ONE OF ATROPINE. I'M GONNA HIT HIM AGAIN. CLEAR. B.P. -- 100 SYSTOLIC. PULSE OX RISING. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWAKE BY NOW. THEY TOLD ME NATHAN SAVED MY LIFE. HOW IS HE? HOW IS HE? HE'S DEVASTATED,RACHEL,AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. I SAW YOU IN THE LIMO WITH COOPER. YOU WERE ARGUING WITH HIM. IT WASN'T WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. ? YOU CAUSED A HUGE SCENE AT THE RECEPTION. YOU STOLE THE LIMO. AND NOW EVERYBODY'S LIFE IS WORSE BECAUSE OF YOU. DOES IT EVEN MATTER TO YOU A LITTLE BIT? ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE ONE SINGLE THING BECAUSE OF IT? NATHAN DOESN'T NEED YOUR THANKS. NEITHER DO I. SO WHY DON'T YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM US? ALL OF US. HEY,MOM? IT WASN'T BROOKE. SHE'S NOT PREGNANT. ARE YOU HAPPY ABOUT YOUR PREGNANCY? WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT? WELL,WHEN ANDY PROPOSED TO YOU, YOU SAID NO BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY, AND YOU DIDN'T WANT KIDS. AND THAT'S FAIR,MOM. YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON HOLD FOR ME A LOT,BUT -- THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. THIS IS KEITH'S CHILD,TOO. OKAY. SO THEN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU THAT I WANTED TO STAY IN TREE HILL FOR COLLEGE? HE DID A GOOD JOB WITH YOU, BUT U.N.C. IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY. AND I'LL BE FINE. IT'S PRETTY COOL,THOUGH,HUH? THAT YOU AND KEITH ARE HAVING A BABY. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PART OF HIM IS COMING BACK TUS. HE DID A GOOD JOB WITH YOU. OKAY,SO,MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I BROUGHT YOU SOME MAKEUP AND THOSE SCISSORS YOU WANTED ?    A COUPLE OF OUTFITS, WHICH REMINDS ME,CLOTHES OVER BRO'S SHOULD TOTALLY BE DESIGNING HOSPITAL GOWNS 'CAUSE I WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THAT. SORRY. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE,BROOKE? I MEAN...TRULY CHANGE? WELL,I'D LIKE TO SAY YES,BUT,HONESTLY... I DON'T REALLY THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. YOU KNOW,AT THE END OF THE DAY,YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE, AND IT'S PROBABLY WHO YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN. BUT WHAT IF WHO YOU'VE BEEN IS PRETTY HORRIBLE? I BROUGHT YOU BACK YOUR HOUSE KEYS. IT'S A VERY NICE HOUSE -- BIG ROOMS,NO PARENTS. I USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE. KEEP THEM. I MEAN,YOU MOVED OUT OF PEYTON'S PLACE,RIGHT? YOU MIGHT AS WELL CRASH AT MY HOUSE. UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO. SO,THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER. THANK YOU. "SHE'S A RUNNER." BILLY SQUIER. AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED THAT YOU HAVE BILLY SQUIER ON YOUR iTUNES. ACTUALLY,I THINK YOU GAVE THAT TO ME. OKAY,UH... "THE RUNAWAY FOUND." THE VEILS. "RUNNING TO STAND --" U2. "STILL." UH-HUH. "RUNNING WITH THE --" VAN HALEN! "DEVIL"! YOU'RE GOOD. MAN,WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE JUST HUNG OUT? GOD,JUST THE TWO OF US? I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY THE DAY WE HID OUT IN THE LIBRARY AND I GOT SHOT IN THE LEG. YEAH. DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT MUCH? EVERY DAY. I WISH I COULD TAKE THAT DAY BACK FOR YOUR MOM AND KEITH. AND I WISH I COULD TAKE BACK OUR KISS FOR YOU AND BROOKE. "MOODY SUBURBAN TEENAGE LOVE SONG." NICE TRY. SLOW RUNNER. OKAY,SO THIS MAYBE BROTHER OF YOURS -- IT'S NOT ELLIE'S KID,RIGHT? NO,HE IS THE SON OF THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER I HAVEN'T MET. APPARENTLY,HIS NAME IS DEREK. ARE YOU GONNA CALL HIM? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME. YOU KNOW,IT'S HIS LIFE TO CONSIDER,TOO. SO,I MEAN,MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT ME, AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME. OR MAYBE HE FOUND A LETTER IN A LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM, AND HE'S JUST A LITTLE TOO SCARED TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND DIAL. HEY. WE WERE JUST -- I'D LIKE TO TALK TO MY BOYFRIEND...ALONE. NICE JOB NOT HITTING ON HIM. LUKE,I'LL GET THOSE CDs LATER. THANKS FOR THE SEX. SHE'S JOKING. I WAS TRYING TO CALL YOU. YOU MEAN,WHEN YOU WEREN'T HANGING OUT WITH PEYTON? COME ON,BROOKE,YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK. NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL. LISTEN,I KNOW IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU LATELY, LOSING KEITH AND YOUR HEART CONDITION AND GIVING UP BASKETBALL. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN KEEPING YOU CLOSE TO ME TO TRY TO PROTECT YOU FROM THOSE THINGS, LIKE I'M HANGING ONTO THE TWO OF US FOR YOU, BUT NOT FOR ME. I'M SORRY I KISSED PEYTON. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT,LUKE. IT'S NOT. I MEAN,I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS,BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT HER. THIS IS ABOUT ME. I LOVE YOU,LUCAS. AND I PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL. BUT WE GO DAYS WITHOUT HAVING A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION, AND I USED TO MISS YOU SO MUCH WHEN THAT HAPPENED. BUT IT NEVER SEEMED LIKE YOU MISSED ME. AND I GUESS BECAUSE OF IT,I STOPPED MISSING YOU. I MEAN,LOOK AT TODAY... Lucas: I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE  SAID SOMETHING -- ANYTHING. I MEAN,FOR A GUY  WHO WANTS TO BE A WRITER, IT SUDDENLY SEEMED LIKE  NO WORDS HAD EVER BEEN WRITTEN. BUT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT THEY SOMEHOW  STOPPED MISSING YOU, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH SCREWED  NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY. IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS,LUKE. BROOKE -- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. SEE,BUT THERE  HAD TO BE SOMETHING,RIGHT, SOMETHING THAT  NO ONE HAD EVER SAID IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, SOMETHING  THAT COULD CHANGE THIS? BROOKE. I'M SORRY. YEAH,ME TOO. THAT WASN'T IT. GOING SOMEWHERE? I DIDN'T THINK YOU WANTED TO SEE ME. I DIDN'T. I REALLY SCREWED THIS UP,MOUTH. I MEAN,WE WERE FIGHTING... AND I GRABBED THE WHEEL. I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THIS,RACHEL. HE COULD DIE,MOUTH. YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA TELL EVERYONE THAT YOU OPENED THE TIME CAPSULE, AND I SAID NOT TO,THAT YOU SHOULD BURY IT? I WAS WRONG. AND UNTIL YOU FACE ALL THE MISTAKES YOU'VE MADE, YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE. PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE,MOUTH. BUT THEY CAN. THEY JUST DON'T BECAUSE IT'S EASIER NOT TO. WE'RE ALWAYS WAITING FOR OUR LIVES TO BEGIN,LIKE, FIGURING WE'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE SOMEDAY. BUT AFTER THIS ACCIDENT AND LOSING JIMMY AND KEITH, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? ALL WE HAVE IS NOW,RACHEL. DON'T RUN FROM THIS. I AM ALL FOR LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST, BUT CAN THIS DAY JUST BE OVER ALREADY? HEY,MA,YOU LOVED DAN,RIGHT,IN HIGH SCHOOL? ODDLY,YES. OKAY,LOOK,I KNOW YOU PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER THIS FOR ME, BUT WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU BACK? HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT? WHEN I DO,I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. "MY NAME IS LUCAS SCOTT.
