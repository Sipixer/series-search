But Even In His Darkest Hours, He Knew In His Heart That Someday It Would Return To Him... * Everything You Had * * Has All Been Lost * ...And His World Would Be Whole Again ** I Swear This Stone * * Will Never Leave My Side * Jamie: Daddy, What's Wrong With Grandpa Dan? What Do You Mean? He Didn't Come To My Birthday Party. Everyone Else Came. I Really Wanted Him To Come. Yeah, I Know You Did, Buddy. But Your Party Was Still Pretty Cool, Right? Yeah, But Grandpa Dan Said He Missed Me. Well, You Know That Old Jersey That Youovove So Much? That Was From Your Grandpa Dan. Really?! I Knew It! Hey! Hey. Mama, Grandpa Dan Got Me This Birthday Present. Wow! Can I Talk To You For A Second? He's Dying, Hales. What?! Dan Needs A Heart Transplant. He Says It's His Hcm. Hehe's Got Six Months To Live, Maybe Not Even That. Do You Believe Him? He's Not Even That Old. I Don't Know. I Mean, It's Dan. But He's Even Drawn Up A Will, And He's Leaving Us The Beach House, Among Other Things. And This Time, He Seeme....Scared. I Mean, I've Seen My Father Be A Lot Of Things, Hales, But Never Scared. Well, If It <I>Is</I> True, At Least Now We Know Why He Wants To Spend So Much Time With Jamie. Nothing Like A Ticking Clock. Well, Ticking Clock Or Not, Dan's Not Spending Any Time With Jamie. Brooke: Come On, Baby Girl. Give Me A Smile. Well, Fine, Have It Your Way, But We Got A Big Week Ahead Of Us, Kid. Tonight We'll Me T The Doctor Who's Gonna Make You All Better, And Tomorrow Aunt Millicent's Goa A Watch You While I Go To My Superduper Important Meeting. Yeah. Are You Gonna Be Okay Without Me? It's Open! Hey, What Are You Doing Here? Diyoyou Think I Was Gonna Forget Something This Important? 7:00, Right? Yeah, 7:00 <I>P.M.</I> But I Appreciate The Enthusiasm, Luke. I Am Kind Of Nervous About The Whole Hospital Thing. I'm Not Really A Big Fan Of Hospitals. How's It Going? Better? Yeah. I'm Starting To Get It Down. She's Sleeping Through The Night Now. See? I Told You You'd Be A Good Mom. Is It What You Expected? It's A Lot Of Work -- A Lot More Than I Ever Thought It Could Be. But She's So Cute! Oh, God, That Was, Like, The Best Night's Sleep Ever! Luke, Hey. What Are You Doing Here? He Just Came By For Angie's Pre-Op Appointment. Talk About A Gentleman. Probably Should Have Just Called. Brooke, I'll Pick You Up Later. Sounds Good. Bye, Luke! Yotwtwo. God. They're Silly. Aren't They Silly?! He Knew There Was Practice This Morning, Right? I Told Him. Bring It In. So, As You Can All See, Q.'S Out For Six Weeks, Which Means We're Gonna Have To Make It To The Playoffs Without Him. Every Single One Of You Is Gonna Have To Step It Up. Now, There's 12 Games Between Now And The Playoffs, And We Can't Afford To Lose Many. Any Questions? Hey, Just Because Quentin's S Injured Doesn't Mean The Season's Over. Now, Here's What I'm Expecti From Each And Every One Of You. Q., Where You Going? Ain't Nothg G Here For Me Now, Man. Hey, Q., You Can't Just Quit. Yeah, I Just Did! Mmm! Look What We Got. More Squash And Peas. Yummy. She Loves It. Go Figure. Hey, About That. Um... I Just Want You To Know, I Am Available To Help With Angie. It's Just  H Hair's Been On Fire Trying To Get The New Recording Studio Done. It's Okay. You Are Excused From Baby Duty. Besides... I Kind Of Like Having The Time Alone With Angie, So Don't Feel Bad. And Anyway, Angie's Scared Of Her Creepy Aunteyeyton, Isn't She? Yes. We Like Uncle Lucas Better. Hey! I'm Kidding. We're Kidding, Aren't We? Yes. I Mean, It Is Pretty Great That He's Helping Out. It's Kind Of "Mr. Mom," But It's Nice. It's Cute. And Anyway, He's Still Pining Over "Lineyey," So... I'm Helping Distract Him. yeah Speaking Of Distractions, I Actually Have To Get Going To The Studio. Why? Who's Recording? Just This Girl You Might Know. Haley James Scott. Did You Hear That, Baby Girl? Haley James Scott's Making Music Again. That's Got To Be Worth A Smile. Yeah? Get Out Of Here, Creepy. You' S Scaring Her. Hello. Come On. Ooh. * And I Won't Break Tonight * * Only So Much I Can Take * Marvin, Do You Have A Voodoo Doll? Excuse Me? That, Or Did You Fix The Salmon Mousse In The Cafeteria? My Sports On-Air Is Sick As A Dog. He Just, Uh, Booted All Over The Stationloloor. And You Want Me To Clean That Up? No. Listen, I Know We Haven't Spoken Much Since I Took Over For Alice... And I Know You Were Close With Her. Um, Pretty Close, Yeah. Anyway, I Really Liked The Remo P Piece You Did On The Ravens. So How Would You Like To Fill In Tomorrow? Really? Uh, What About The Weekend Guy? He O Okay. But Then How Would You Get Your Big Shot? I Got Three Slots -- 4:00, 5:00, An6:6:00. I Need You To Do Sports For All Three. Yes, Sir. Thank You, Sir. Oh, And, Uh,Ararvin, I Heard About Your Omaha Offer. I Think You Made The Right Decision. Sweet! Luke, Do You Have A Second? It's Dan. He's Dying. Right. I'm Serious. It's Something About His Heart. He Had Nathan Out To The Beach House To Tell Him. And Nathan Believes Him? I Thinsoso. At Least, He Seemed Prpretty Convinced. Dan Drafted Up Ailill And Everything. Why? You Think He's Lying? Of Course He's Lying! All Right, I-I'll Get Into It, Ayay? But In The Meantime, Be Careful. All Right? Don't Let Him Suck You And Nathan Back Into His Life. I Know. I'm With You On That. But What If He's Telling The Truth? What If He Really Is Dying? Well, Then, All I Have To Say Is... It Couldn't Happen To A Nicer Guy. You'll Get It Back Again, Trust Me. What Are You Doing Here? You Told Me In The Gym You Weren't Trying To Come Back, And I Know You Are -- It's What I Would Do. It's Not A Comeback. Sure. You Know, Nathan, You May Just Have To Face The Fact That You'll Never Be The Same Playeyoyou Once Were, But That Doesn't Mean You Still Won't Be A Great Player. You Just Have To Learn How To Play Diffenently -- Revevent Yourself. The Best Players Always Find A Way. Okay, Try It Again, But Slow It Down A Tad. Stop It! Stop What? Following Me. Trying To See Jamie. This -- All Of It. Dan, I Don't Care That You're Dying, Okay? This Isn't Happening. We're Done Here. Nathan, Don't Hate Me Because I'm Proud Of Your Accomplishments. Take It From Someone Who Knows. You Don't Want To Live A Life Of Regret. It's Not Too Late. You Can Have Your Dream. You Just Have To Really Want It. Stop It! Okay, You Don't Get It, Do You?! Justtotop It -- All Of It! And Leave My Family Alone! Oh, There! Check It Out. How Awesome Is This, Haley? It's Red Bedroom Studios. Yeah, It's Great. Hey. What G Going On With You? Nothing. I'm Fine. It's Just, Um...Nothing. The Studio Looks Awesome. So, What Is It? Can I Just Ask You A Personal Question? Yeah, Please Do. If Y H Had The Chance To Get To Know Your Real Father, Would You Want To? Oh, Wow. I Mean, You Know What? Before Ellie, I Probably Would Have Said No, But She Was Awesome. And, So, Yeah, It Does Make Me Kind Of Wonder About My Real Dad Sometimes. But... You Know, Then Again, What If I Meet Him And I Don't Like Him? So, Sometimes I Think It's Just Easier Not To Know And Go With My Own Idealized Version Of Him. Yeah. Why Do You Ask? The'e's A Chance Dan Might Be Dying. Are You Kidding? Does Nhahan Know? Yeah, Nathan And Lucas Both Know. The Problem Is With Jamie. He Is Obsessed With Getting To Know His Grandfather, And If Dan's Really Sick, He Might Not Get The Chance To Do That. God, Haley. I'm Sorry. That's Tough, N.N. Um...I Mean, I Will Say That Getting To Know Ellie Changed My Life. And I'm Pretty Sure We Wouldn't Be Standing Here If It Weren't Foheher. Then Again, Ellie Wasn't D S Scott. Well, You <I>Look</I> Healthy. Come On In, Lucas. Have A Seat. Nah, That's Okay.What Iavave To Say I Can Say From Right Here. Well, Suit Yourself. But You Of All Peopie Should Take This Seriously. There's Nothing Wrong With My Heart. If I Know You, There's Nothing Wrong With Yours, Either. I Wish That Was True. But I've Got The Best Cardiologist Money Can Buy, And Even He Can't Help Me. Dr. Thorton -- Call Him Yourself. I Might Just Do That. Good. And When You Do, You'll Find Out That I'm Not Lying. Withoua A Transplant, I'll Be Dead Within Six Months. But You're Dead To So Many Of Us Already, Dan. so really, ??? matter? So, Do You Want To Put Down The Piano Scratch Track First? Yeah, That's Perfect. Hey! Who Would Have Thought That One Day We'd Be In Our Own Recording Studio Making Your Next Record Together? On <I>Your</I> Label. It's Great That You're Really Enjoying Your Work So Much, Peyton. Just As Long As Yorere Not Using It To Hide Behind. [ Laughing ] What's That Supposed To Mean? Look, Before The Wedding, I Told Lucas That He Shouldn't Marry Lindsey. Why? 'Cause I Just Read His New Novel, And When I Did, I Knew Right Away That He Was Still In Love With You, Whether He's Ready To Admit It Or Not. It's A Book, Okay? You Can't Draw Those Kind Of Conclusions From A Story. Really? What About When W Write My Music? Some Of My Subconscious Always Ends Up Sneaking Into My Lyrics Somewhere. I Don't Even Notice It Until The Song's Done I Thk K Lucas Is The Same Way With His Writing. Well, I Watched Him Up On That Altar, And It's Very Clear To Me Where His Heart Lies, And If I Can See It, I'm Not Really Sure Why Lindsey Can't. You Know, It's Unfair To Luke. He Loves Her. I Think She's Just Afraid Of The Idea Of You -- Your History With Him. Think How You'd Feel If The Roles Were Reversed. Hi. Sorrifif I Kept You Waiting. I'm Dr. Copeland. You Must Be Brooke Davis. Mm-Hmm. Clothes, Right? Yes. I Thought You Looked Familiar. Which Must Make You -- A Friend. Lucas Scott. Great. ??? so You Can Know What To Expect. Are You Familiar With Angie's Condition Not Really. She Has A Hole In Her Heart, Right? She Has A Number Of Holes, Actually, But We're Gonna Fix Them. We'll Put Angie Under A General Anesthesia. We'll Stop Her Heart, And Then I'll Do The Repairs. You Have To Stop Her Heart For How Long? Two Hours, Maybe Longer, Depending On The Extent Of Her Condition. Two Hours? Yes, That -- That's How We Do It, Brooke. Angie Will Be On A Heart-And-Lungacachine, Which Will Keep Blood And Oxygen Circulating In Her Body. Then I Will Grt T Skin From Another Part Of Her Heart And Use It To Fix The Holes. How Do You Intend To Restart Angie's Heart? After The Repairs Are Complete, We Will Use An Electric Shock. And Once She's Stabilized, We'll Take Her To The I.C.U., And You'll Be Able To See Her Then. I Know I Don't Have A Choice Here, Buththis Seems So Dangerous. I-Is The Some Other Way? Hmm, Uh, I'm Sorry, But, U N No, There -- There Is No Other Way ??? Dr. Copeland, What's Angie's Prognosis If She Didn't Have The Surgery? A Year, Maybe Two. And Then What? She'll Die. Look, Brooke, It's -- It's Okay To Be Nervous, But, Um, I-I Just -- I Want You To Focus On What A Great Thing It Is That You're Doing For Angie. Okay. Thank You. So, If There Are No Further Questions, I Will See You Next Wk.K. Actually, There Is One Thing. Do You Happen To Know A Dr. Thorn?N? You're Shooting Like Me Now. Yeah, We Both Former Ravens Now, Too. What? Why? Oh, Well, I Don't Know. Let's See -- This Thing? Hmm? You're Still Part Of Thteteam, Q. You Can't Just Quit Because You're Iurured. You Sound Like Your Brother Now. I Mean, I Exctcted A Little Grief From <I>You,</I> But What's Lucas Know About Ayaying Injured Anyway? Let Me Tell You Something About Lucas. Lucas Played Injured His Entire Senior Year. It Cost Him A Lot Of Playing Time, But He Never Gave Up On His Team. And What If They Make The Playoffs? They Won't. Even If They Do, Man, It's My Shooting Hand, Nate. I Ain't Gonna Be Ready For The Scouts Anyway. Well, Then You'll Have To Learn How To Play Differently. You're Gonna Have To Reinvent Your Game. Reinvent My -- Man, That Ain't That Easy, Okay? Who Said It Was Gonna Be Easy? But What Are You Gonna Do? Are You Gonna Quit? Are You Gonna Throw Away Everything You Ever Worked For? No, I'm Not <I>Going</I> To. I Already <I>Did,</I> Okay? You Know I Punched That Dudfofor <I>You?</I> Oh, Come On. I've Thrown A Lot Of Punches, And Every Last One Was Selfish. Now, Face It, Q., You Punched That Guy For <I>You.</I> Deal With It. You're Dead, Dude! Deal With It! Hey! These Gass Are So Addicting. I Just Waxed A 13-Year-Old Kid From Arkansas. He Was Pretty Upset. Ok.. We're Gonna Veve To Keep An Eye On That. Millie, You Won't Guess What Happened To Me Today At Rkrk. What? I'm Gonna Get A Shot To Anchor The Sports Segments Tomorrow. No Way! Yeah, The Regular Guy's Sick. And The Station Manager's Giving Me A Shot. Marvin, That Is Great! Just Think Of All Those People Who Are Gonna Be Watching You On Tv. You Want To Come? You Can Be There At The Statn.N. I Wish I Could, But Brooke Has Her Big Presentation Tomrorow, And I Promised To Look After The Baby. But I'll Watch Every Minute Of You On The Big Screen At The Store. I'm So Proud Of You, Marvin. You're Gonna Do Great. Mama, Where Does Grandpa Dan Live? Uh, Why? I Need To Thank Him For My Birthday Present. Can You Take Me? Um, Well, I-I Can't Do That Right Now, 'Cause, Well, Grandpa Dan Lives At The Beach, And It's Getting Kind Of Late. But I'll Tell You What We <I>Can</I> Do. You Can Write Your Grandpa Dan A Thank-You Note, And I Will Make Sure That He Gets It. Cooli'i'll Write The Best Thank-You Note Ever. Okay, Cool. That's My Girl. Okay. Okay. I Can't Even Get Her To Smile, Luke. Wh A Am I Doing? What If She Dies? What Then? What Do I Tell Her Parents -- These People That I've Never Met? What Made Me Think I Could Handle This? Hey, Just Remember, You're Giving Angie A Chance To Live A Full, Wonderful Life. She Couldn't Do That Without The Surgery. Yeah, I Guess So. Thank You For Being Here For Us. Thank You For Letting Me. Sweet Girl. and your ??? Yosusuck, You Know That? I Do Not. Do Too.. Ah, You Killing Me. It's True. Dan's Dying. Without A Transplant, He's Got Six Months. And You're Sure? I Spoke With The Cardiologist. So, What Are We Gonna Do? Nothing. In Six Months, Dan's Out Ofof Our Lives Once And For All. It Cldldn't Happen To A More Deserving Guy.

I Say We Push The Tempo And Just Shoot 3s -- Like, Almost <I>All</I> 3s. I Mean, We Still Got Some Good Outside Shooters, And They're In Pretty Good Shape, So If We Push It, We Might Just Run The Score Up High Enough To Whe W We Don't Need No Big Man In The Paint. Almost All 3s, Huh? He I It Wasn't My Idea. It Was Him. That's A Good Idea, Jamie. But, See, With That Kind Of Offense, We're Gonna Need A Really Strong Player To Distribute The Ball And Get Back On "D." You've Already Got That Player. Quentin.

Yes, He Wrote About A Comet, But In His Nonfiction Life, He Seems Very Much In Love With You. Have You Read The Book, Peyton? I Didn't Think So, Because If You Had, You Wouldn't Be So Sure Who Lucas Loves And How Much. Lindsey, The Book Was A Work Of Fiction. But What Wasn't Fiction Was The Fact That He Said "I Do" To <I>You</I> In That Church. It's Not <I>Me</I> That Has To Make A Decision About Lucas. It's <I>You.</I> Go Home,Eyeyton.
