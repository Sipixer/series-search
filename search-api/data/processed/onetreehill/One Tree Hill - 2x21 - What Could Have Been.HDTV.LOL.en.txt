Hey. It’s okay. I’m here for you. Mrs. Scott, how long have you been abusing prescription drugs? I love you, mom. Were you able to get a hold of Keith? Where is he, Whitey? I love you. I love you, too. I’m coming home tomorrow, okay? Don’t come home, Haley. Coz I don’t want you to. Welcome home. Oh, bill. Bill. Final notice. Way final notice. You ever robbed a bank, Luke? Hey, you got friends. We’ll help. Yeah, that sounds great. All I need is the money for these bills and… a hundred-thousand dollars to pay the hospital. Wow, woulda been a lot cheaper if you’d just hit the brakes, huh? What happened out there, Nathan? You were there. Why don’t you tell me? Look, did you… you know, feel like… - I mean, did you wanna- - Did I wanna, what? Kill yourself. Coz, if that’s what happened, you need to see somebody. I’ll check out Dr. Phil this afternoon. How long are you gonna dodge talking to me about this?! How long are you gonna dodge telling me you knew my mom was a pill-head? Now, look, I screwed up; I hit the wall. That’s all there was to it. Okay? Hey, Brooke, what’s going on? Um... total hypothetical here; say you had a friend living in your room and she was going through your closet looking for her favourite pair of Jimmy Choo’s but all she found… was this freaky bag of shredded paper that you said was a puzzle? And, let’s say she got bored. You know, or… nosey… so… she kind of put the pieces back together? Would… you be ticked off? Only if this hypothetical ‘friend’ didn’t bring me the finished product. Well then. Come here. Okay, paranoid much? Just enough. So what you got? It’s a bill of sale. For… a used car. Sold to some lady named Christine Gersio? - Who is she? - I don’t know. I think Dan might be running some kind of scam, and this bill could be tied to whatever he’s doing. Oh, you go detective-boy. In the mean time, I am off to do a little recon at my favourite clothing store. Hey, Brooke. Thank you for this. You really helped my out. No problem. Every Sherlock needs a doctor Watsit, right? Watson. Bye. Making a mix? No, just… sorting CD’s. Any of those contenders for the next… All Ages night? I don’t know. I’m not really into hustling bands these days. Have you seen Jake? He doesn’t want me to. I just wish that there was something I could do for him. Oh, you mean other than riding his lawyers to stay on the case? It’s not enough. Well… how about I distract you from something that sucks with something that sucks? And what’s that? Nathan’s having some… pretty serious money problems. So… I was thinking that maybe if… we got everybody together, we could… figure out a way to raise some cash. Cool. I’m in. Yeah? Oh, by the way, remember… right before Jake came back… and you accused me of being a crappy friend? Yeah… I’m really sorry, I- No. You were right. I don’t ever want that to happen again. So if you need anything… I’m around, okay? Okay. Thank you, Lucas. Alright. We could have a car wash. Nathan and cars, not a good combo. Bake sale? Speaking for the girls, bikini season is right around the corner, so no. What about TRIC? Peyton could hook up a benefit or something, right? Uh… well that’s where Haley met Chris so… I doubt Nathan’s gonna wanna go anywhere near there. But I bet he’d be down with a brothel. What? It worked for Tom Cruise in ‘Risky Business’. That’s it. Peyton, don’t encourage Dim! No, we throw a movie night, okay? And we can… take donations and sell concessions- Yeah, no, we can do it at the Rivercourt. You know, we could bring a big screen. And rig the AV closet for films and a projector. You mean the same closet I caught you making out with Erica last week? It’s good to be an AV geek with keys. But, I’m flying solo this weekend; Erica’s visiting her grandmother. What if it rains? I’m already on it. Oh… no, we need a plan B, it’s gonna pour all weekend. We could do it at TRIC. If you convince Nathan to go. I’m gonna pay the hospital bill; it’s just that… right now I’m… completely tapped out and I can’t go back to work yet. Let me pull up your file. Uh, Nathan, your bill’s paid. The insurance must have covered it. What kind of plan do you have? I don’t know. My… my wife usually pays attention to that stuff. Well, apparently, you’re all set. She sounds like a keeper. Don’t let her get away. Yeah… thanks. Nathan, why didn’t you tell me they were releasing you today? Coz it’s none of your business. Why don’t you move home, son? At least until you’re back on your feet. Forget it, alright!? I don’t want your help, I just wanna move on with my life. In that case, I can help. What is this, divorce papers?! Annulment. Any judge who sees how young you are will say you weren’t in your right mind when you married. Oh, so now I’m crazy? You are if you don’t sign those papers. Why drag Haley down with you? As long as you’re married to her, she’s also responsible for you debt. You don’t give a rat’s ass about Haley. This is what you want. It’s also what’s best for you. She made her choice and it wasn’t you. Why hang on? Get out. You have a chance, right now- I hit you once, dad, alright? I don’t have a problem doing it again. Listen, you wanna wallow in self-pity, fine. But she’s ready to move on, I think you know that. Just in case. So… the bill of sale you pieced together was for twelve thousand. But the one on file at the dealership… said the woman paid nine. A counting mistake? Well, that’s what I thought, too. So I called her… she said she paid twelve, in cash. So, Dan destroyed the bill with the higher price and pocketed three grand. Seems that way. Alright, I’m not math wiz, but it doesn’t seem like such a major scam. Depends on how many times he’s done it. So that’s why you’re still staying at the house? Trying to figure out what he’s doing? I need all the access to him I can get. Why didn’t you tell me about this sooner? I… didn’t know how you’d feel about me trying to take down Dan. It’s fine by me. Listen… about your mom… I did see her take some pills. Once. Okay? I confronted her… and she told me to mind my own damn business. I’m sorry, I should have mentioned it. Nah, it’s okay. My dad and I should have noticed it anyway. Ah, don’t worry about it. You know… she’ll get through it. Deb’s tough. She has to be; look who she married. So, we good? Just make sure you keep me posted on my dad. I need all the entertainment I can get these days. By the way… my insurance paid for my entire hospital stay. So… I don’t even really need a fundraiser anymore. You know, you still got… bills. Rent. Yeah, I’ll figure something out. Come on! It’ll be fun. Besides, everyone really wants to help out. Rig up the dart board with Chris’ face on it and I’m in. I love this… And I have got to have… this! And I need this. Oh… look at these adorable wedges. Brooke, pace yourself. You gotta shoot for gradual ramp up to your full shopping speed. Just don’t let me lose track of time, okay? I promised Lucas I would help him cook dinner for Nathan, although, when I say cook, I actually mean order pizza. Seems like you and Lucas have been spending a lotta time together lately, huh? Yeah. I think this whole ‘friends’ thing is actually working out. And he’s been taking such great care of Nathan. Okay. Enough with the ‘um-hm’s’ already. Fine. But, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were vibing on him again. Seriously, we are just friends. Okay, all I’m saying is on the off chance that… you wanted more… I think it would be great. Really? You’re not afraid the three of us will get… sucked back down into the Bermuda Triangle of drama? No. Not this time. But we said ‘Hoes over Bros’. Well that doesn’t mean no ‘Bros’ ever. The thing I’ve learned from all this Jake craziness is we’ve gotta grab every second you have with the people you love. Just don’t forget about your ‘Hoes’. Come here. You are the best friend ever, P. Sawyer, but… honestly, if Lucas and I couldn’t make it as a couple before… what makes you think we can now? Well, for one thing, I wouldn’t make out with him this time. And another, he’s not the same guy, and you are definitely not the same girl. Looks good fellas. Let’s just keep an eye on the clock. Hey, do you have a second? Yeah, yeah, sure, listen, listen. You know I love you, right? But you have got to lose that fluffy top you wore last night. I mean, come on this is rock n’ roll princess. This is not the senior prom. Listen… I need some time off. There’s some things going on with my husband- Again? Haley, look, I like you… I mean you’ve been a major pain in my ass, but in a good way. So, I mean, if you gotta go, I can’t stop you. But… I may need to replace you. Are you serious? The question is ‘are you’? Come on, I mean, you got talent. I mean, you could be more than just a duet girl. I know but I’ve- Look, this is a business, Haley, and I will work like hell to make you a star, but you gotta make a decision; how bad do you want the big time?! Jimmy, move that. Let’s go guys, come on, you’re on my clock, not yours. What d’ya think? It’s pretty clear; any cash transaction over ten thousand dollars gets reported to the government. Dan changes the transaction amount from, like, twelve thousand to nine thousand… Which allows him to keep skimming profits and pocketing the extra cash. Exactly. If that cash you found in the ceiling at the dealership is any indication, he’s shredding a lot of invoices. Well then I need to pull all the files for cash sums just under ten grand. No, no, no, no, no, you’ve done enough. Andy, I’m so close. Yeah, and we’ll get him, Lucas, I promise. Just let me find where he’s hiding this money. We’ll have everything we need. Yo, dude, check out this awesome footage I swiped from my mom’s garden club. Here. What’s wrong with you? Nothing, nothing… I just… you were in this… weird dream I had during surgery. Yeah? And? And, we were… kind of… showering together. Don’t be embarrassed, everybody has that dream about me. Don’t have the dream now, Tim! Nice air-ball. You haven’t learned anything, have you? What’re you talking about? Freshmen year: you rolled your ankle and your doc said ‘no basketball for a month’, and you didn’t listen. Do you believe in dreams, Peyton? What d’ya mean, like… do I think there’s some kinda message? More like warnings. About… how every choice you make… shapes your future. Like, if I hadn’t turned down High Flyers, or if I hadn’t gone after Haley… or if my dad hadn’t married my mom. I know what you mean. If my mom had left five minutes earlier to pick me up, she’d still be alive. Was your accident and accident, Nathan? I don’t know if I aimed for that wall, Peyton. Maybe I was thinking about Haley right before the crash; about how we got off-track. I mean, I feel different now. I know what’s important; my mom, my friends… basketball. And Haley? Lately, I’ve been wondering if… all the energy we used trying to hold our marriage together could have been better spent on other things. Nathan- How’re you and Jake doing? He… is really not up to seeing me these days. I’m sorry. He’ll change his mind. What about you and this place? I mean, you bringing any new bands in? Actually, I was thinking I was gonna drop that. You know, it’s just caused so many problems. What happened with Haley and Chris is not your fault. You love music, Peyton, don’t back away from your dreams. You’re gonna end up so bitter you’ll just destroy all the people around you. - What’s up, Luke? - What’s up, Junk. I’ll take some pretzels, soda… got any Crackerjack? Don’t… say Crackerjack. Alright. Hey, Peyton. Hey everybody, you guys ready for some movies?! Okay… well then grab some snacks, stretch out and we’re gonna kicks things off with a couple of cartoons. The number one killer… of young people is traffic accidents. And that’s… that’s gotta be… one of the biggest and grossest waste of human life. About… forty percent of fatal and injury accidents involve people in the age group of fifteen to twenty-four. Mouth, we can’t show this to Nathan. I know, I know. The film cans are all mislabelled. Ah, Nate, I’m sorry, man. This isn’t what we planned. What, are you kidding me, this is awesome. Come on! Turn it up! You spent thirty bucks on pay-per-view porn? That’s mine. What? You were out of town. I was lonely. Um… I got you cookies and liquorish. Hey, I got you another soda and… some popcorn. Uh… want me to scrounge up a pillow so you can elevate that knee? No, no, I’m good. Alright. Okay, well, send up a flare if you need anything else, guys. Brooke’s been really great since Jake’s been gone. Yeah… Luke’s really had my back since the accident. She’s driving me crazy. I hear ya. Luke’s this close to tucking me in and singing me a lullaby. - If you want, I could- - Tim, stop it. Looks like you got a letter mixed in with your bills. It’s from my mom. Thanks, Brooke. For what? For letting me vent about Dan. For helping… Nathan out so much. I just don’t know what I’d do without you. You look like you needed some chocolate. Don’t give up on him, Peyton. Jake’ll let you back in. Come in. Hey. Tim told me he drove you home. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I just… I was reading that letter from my mom and I didn’t… really feel like being in a big crowd anymore. How’s she doing? Rehab sounds tough but she’s hanging in there. Part of her therapy is to make amends; so she… she apologised for all the times she used work or pills to avoid problems at home. I’m sure that was hard for her to say. Yeah. She’s hoping all three of us can be together again. I mean, she seems to think that if she can change… maybe we all can. I… I don’t know if I can do it, Peyton. I’ve been trying to believe the best in people, lately, you know? Like, hoping Nikki will just back off… or that Jake’s lawyers will find a way to get him out… so I’d like to believe that… even somebody as assy as your dad could be different if he really wanted to. Yeah, but… you know all the crap that he’s pulled in the past. I mean, doesn’t it sound crazy to try to be a family again? Um… I’m probably not the right person to ask. Well, I mean, I wanna know what you think. Tell me. I would give anything to have one more day with my mom and dad together. Yeah… I’m really sorry Peyton. I wasn’t even thinking- It’s okay. Really, it’s… Truth is… you have bigger things to worry about. I opened this letter from your insurance company and your premium hasn’t been paid. So… you don’t have any coverage. That’s not possible. I mean I just talked to the… lady at the hospital and she said Haley paid this. Oh! Okay, well… maybe it was a mistake. Unless it wasn’t insurance who paid. Nathan, what’re you doing here? You’re not supposed to drive. My insurance got cancelled; it didn’t cover my accident. So I called the hospital and I found out that you paid my bill; and then I called my landlord… and I found out you paid my rent, too. Well of course I did; you’re my son, you needed my help. Help from you always comes with strings attached, dad! So what’re you looking for this time, huh? Gratitude? Respect? Love? Forget it. You think I paid your bills as a ploy to get you to love me? I know I’ve ruined any chance for that; with you and you mother. But don’t make my mistake; don’t push her away. You save it, alright, dad? Listen to me! It’s my fault you emancipated yourself, I know that. It’s my fault your mother’s in rehab! Somewhere along the line, I started hurting the people closest to me. And I haven’t figured out how to stop. You wanna stop being a dick, dad? Then just do it. I want to. I figured if Lucas moved in, I’d be my best self. The funny thing is… he’s a better man than I’ll ever be. All these years I’ve been the bad guy for abandoning him. Seems I actually did him and Karen a favour. Nice try, dad. What else you got? This is how far we’ve come? You don’t believe when I’m sincere. History’s on my side, dad. No matter what you think, I would do anything for you. That’s what family does for each other. Even if you wife doesn’t understand that. Leave Haley out of this. You almost died; she didn’t even come to the hospital! I told her not to! And you were right. Don’t you see? This is a chance, a clean break for you and her to be the people you were meant to be. This conversation is over. No, right here, right now! This is your future, it starts right here! Hey, you wanna hate me, fine! I can live with that. But don’t you become me. That will never happen. Yes it will. If you make the wrong choice… you’ll spend the rest of your life wishing you were a different man. Dear Keith, I don’t know if you’re looking at e-mail, but I need to say something. It’s hard for me not to march in and take charge when the people I love are hurting. But I get it now… that’s not what you need. If you have to go through this alone, I’ll respect that… even if it’s not what I want. I won’t call or write again. Just know that I’m here for you. Now and always. Karen. Hey. Hey, thanks for coming. Uh, I got some extra garbage bags. You’re kidding, right? Yeah. You know, we did really well for Nathan last night. Particularly since you… snuck in your allowance cheque from your folks. Oh, don’t think of it as an allowance; think of it as… three skirts, four tops, two bags and… a lot of… really hot lingerie. I thought that’d be tough for you. Just seemed like it was time to spread the karmic well. That’s gonna mean a lot to Nathan. I’m just sorry you had to give everything back. Well… not everything. Do you think I’m terrible for keeping these really cute wedges? No. Listen… we’ve been so caught up with Peyton and Nathan that I, that I feel like I haven’t… really checked in with you. How’re you doing… without Felix around? Oh, fine. He was not the guy for me. Well, I’m sure the guy is out there somewhere. Maybe. But I’m scared to open up my heart like that, again. Isn’t the alternative… even scarier? Sure, I get lonely sometimes. That’s hard. But… I guess that’s the price you pay for figuring out what you really want, right? Yeah. No, that’s perfect. That’s great. We won’t let you down, take care. Great news: Gavin’s manager is excited about you as a solo act. We should record a demo. I’m sorry… tonight’s my last show. No, no, Haley, no, no, you gotta think about this. I have thought about this. I’m going home to my husband. What if you’re making a mistake? Well… the mistake was leaving him in the first place. No, Haley. I’m sorry! Haley. Hey, mom. Yeah, yeah, it’s good to hear your voice, too. Mom, please don’t cry. Things are gonna be okay, alright? No… I’m the one who’s sorry. Listen, I shut you out… I was so sure that I was right… only you couldn’t see it or you didn’t care to see it. I was wrong to do that. I understand, now, that you had dreams too and things weren’t easy for you. I know how I didn’t make them easy. I love you, mom, for pulling it together. I just wanted to tell you that… things are gonna be different when you get home. I promise. I’m gonna make sure you get the life you want. Thank you, goodnight. Thank you. See ya later. Hey, Haley? There’s a tall, dark, hottie waiting in the Green Room. Say’s he’s your biggest fan. Thank you. Caught the show. Who knew you actually had talent? What’re you doing here, Mr. Scott? I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And since you’re clearly gonna be a big star… I want your autograph. Petition for annulment? It’ll be like the marriage never happened. My marriage is none of your business. And when Nathan finds out that you went behind his back to get this- I’m not hiding anything from him. It’s over, Haley. Why else would Nathan have asked me to come? Hey. Good news: Brooke came through with the phone, the rent, you name it! And Andy says as soon as finds out where Dan’s stashing the skimmed money, we can nail him. What’re you doing? I’m moving back home. And what is that, Dan’s bright idea? He’s right. Haley and I have been kidding ourselves this whole time. I’ve tried so hard to convince myself of otherwise but… I can’t pretend anymore. - Nah, this isn’t you talking. - It is, Luke. I don’t wanna end up some bitter man who punishes Haley for what I could have been. She deserves better than that. So do I. No, you love Haley, Nathan! It’s not enough! Alright? Listen, I thought this marriage was gonna make both of our lives better… but all it ended up doing was getting in the way of our dreams and… Lucas, it’s time for me to focus, now; on basketball and my mom’s recovery. It’ll be better this way. Just don’t do this, man. Don’t let him win. I’ll do anything I can to help you. Then stop going after Dan. Lucas, I know the man’s no saint… but I think my mom’s ready to give him… ready to give our family another try. Nathan, you’re not that naïve, you know Dan’ll never change. You may be right, but… I owe it to my mom to give this a try. So can I count on you to back off? Yeah. And since all that cool new stuff went back to its home… my closet’s looking pretty bleak so I’m gonna shove all Lucas’ junk back in and then head to a movie. Hey, Peyton, was it worth it? Giving your heart to Jake? Absolutely. Even with the way things turned out? He’s in jail and you’re alone and hurting. But I’ve also been happier than I thought possible. So… I don’t know, I mean, being in love; that’s how you know you’re alive, right? Maybe. I’m starting to wonder how much one heart can take. Well, there’s only one way to find out, so just… call Lucas. It’s just a movie. Plus, wouldn’t you rather take a chance than always wonder what could have been? I’ll call you later, okay? Hey, Brooke? Hey, back atcha. You busy? Nah, I’m just grabbing some coffee. What’s up? We’ve been doing really well with this whole friends thing, right? Yeah, we have. Yeah, I think so, too. So, I wanted to ask you something. Um… Ah, hold on. Hey, Brooke, you still there? Yeah. Okay. What’d you wanna ask me? Let’s not screw this up, now, okay? Okay. Bye, Lucas. You okay? Yeah, I think so. Uh, why’d you wanna meet? Well, I’ve found out where at least ninety-five thousand of Dan’s skimmed money’s going. That’s great, where? Seems he’s been making a lot of small cash deposits… into a college fund. For you. I don’t get it. Why would he do that? He could be using the fund to hide the cash before he moves it elsewhere. Or… in some screwed-up way, maybe Dan really does care for ya. Look, Lucas, nobody knows about this, yet. If you want, I can just destroy the papers and call it a day. You wanna quit going after him? That’s your decision. I don’t know what I’m gonna turn up and I really don’t care. Dan’s nothing to me. Somebody’s gotta end it. He hurts everybody he touches. But he is your father. So, you tell me: do I keep digging? Yes. Don’t stop until you have everything. Okay. I thought you were going to see your husband. What husband? Sure this is what you want? Yeah. It’s gonna be great having you both here. You’ll see. Uh… actually… I’m moving home. What? Why? There’s plenty of room for all of us. It’s just time. Thank you. Any time. - I’m home. - Oh, I’m so glad. Me too, mom. Hey, Brooke. Hey. Well, now that we are all here together, we need to set some new ground rules. I know that the two of you had a history. Oh, don’t worry, Karen, we’re just friends. Nothing more. Synchro: Amariss
