I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GONNA TELL YOU THIS, BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,I SAW KEITH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN,YOU SAW HIM? LIKE IN A DREAM? SORT OF. IT - IT WAS JUST SO REAL. YOU KNOW,HE SHOWED ME THINGS,MOM. HE TOOK ME TO THE SCHOOL, AND I SAW JIMMY LYING THERE ON THE FLOOR,DEAD. AND KEITH WAS STANDING ABOVE HIM, AND HE WAS STILL ALIVE,AS IF JIMMY DIDN'T KILL KEITH. LOOK,LUCAS,IT WAS A DREAM. MOM - I KNOW THAT IT IS VERY HARD FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH BECAUSE JIMMY WAS YOUR FRIEND. BUT HE SHOT KEITH,JUST LIKE HE SHOT PEYTON. YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT YOU STILL HAVE HER HERE. N' FOGRANTED. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. I,UH - MS. DAVIS,I'M GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US. SORRY. I'VE ASKED ALL THE TUTOR STAFF TO BE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITUATION. TESTS ARE MISSING FROM THE TUTOR-CENTER FILES. WHY AM I HERE? AS STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED. OH,YEAH. RIGHT. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THE EXAMS OR HAD UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS? I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE CURRENT STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING TUTORED. WHOEVER DID THIS WILL BE EXPELLED. OR WORSE. I WILL BET YOU ANYTHING RACHEL STOLE THOSE TESTS. WHAT? WHEN I WAS TUTORING HER,SHE TRIED TO BRIBE ME FOR THEM. HALEY,I LIVE WITH RACHEL. IF SHE'D STOLEN THE TESTS,I'D KNOW. HEY. WE HAVE A PROBLEM. YEAH. YOU STABBED ME IN THE BACK FROM THE FRONT. OKAY,WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS. DID YOU RETURN THE CALCULUS EXAMS THAT WE STOLE? MAYBE. OKAY,I FORGOT. RACHEL,TURNER KNOWS THE TESTS ARE MISSING, AND NOW HE'S ON A TOTAL WITCH HUNT. WHO CARES? HE DOESN'T KNOW IT WAS US. THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS HOW YOU LEFT ME HANGING TODAY. YOU SAID YOURSELF CLEAN TEENS WAS OUR ALIBI. OTHERWISE,WE CAN'T JUSTIFY WHY WE WERE IN THE SCHOOL. THAT IS NOT WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU SCREWED ME OVER FOR A GUY WHO WON'T SCREW YOU. OH,PLEASE,LIKE I COULDN'T GET CHASE AFTER A LITTLE CHASE.</i> I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING. YOU SEE,CHASE IS INTO SMART,BORN-AGAIN-VIRGIN BROOKE, NOT STUPID,SLUTTY,"I CHEATED ON THE CALCULUS TEST" BROOKE. FINE. BUT HAVE YOU SEEN ME? BECAUSE I COULD EASILY HAVE SEX WITH HIM IF I WANTED TO. INTERESTING. CARE TO BET ON THAT? TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH. DUDE,THESE OUTFITS ROCK. YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WIN THAT $1,000 HANDS DOWN. OR PANTS DOWN. I DON'T KNOW,MAN. I STILL SUCK. MAN,WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

IT WAS LIKE ANOTHER DAY,ANOTHER DISASTER. IT'S LIKE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED WE'VE BECOME CHAOS JUNKIES. SO I TOLD MY MOM ABOUT SEEING KEITH. I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WAS GOING TO UPSET HER. LUKE,YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HER. I KNOW,BUT I DID. I JUST  I  JUST WANT TO LET IT ALL GO AWAY,YOU KNOW? I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO JUST BE HAPPY,HMM? I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK. SEEMS LIKE I SPEND MORE TIME WITH KEITH NOW THAN I DID WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. I'M SORRY. I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE. DAN,UM... I BOUGHT A ROAST FOR DINNER, AND I DIDN'T KNOW LUCAS HAD PLANS TONIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE TOO MUCH FOR ME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OVER FOR DINNER? I'D LIKE THAT. OH... I THOUGHT VAMPIRES HAD TO BE INVITED IN. AND I THOUGHT WATER MELTED WITCHES,YET HERE WE ARE. THAT WAS QUITE THE PERFORMANCE YOU PUT ON TODAY. WHY ARE YOU MESSING WITH KAREN'S HEAD? HASN'T SHE SUFFERED ENOUGH? YOU DON'T THINK MY INTENTIONS TOWARD KAREN ARE SINCERE? YOU DON'T HAVE A SINCERE BONE IN YOUR BODY,DAN. DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR WEDDING? YOU POUR WATER IN MY FACE, AND NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE? YOU DISAPPEARED AFTER THE REHEARSAL DINNER, AND MY PARENTS WERE FURIOUS. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR? I DROVE TO TREE HILL... AND SPENT THE NIGHT PARKED IN FRONT OF KAREN'S HOUSE. I KNEW I WAS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE. YOU SEE... KAREN WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. YET I WAS TOO PROUD TO TELL HER. I NEVER LOVED YOU,DEB. I SETTLED FOR YOU. AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. YOU'RE A MISERABLE ASS OF A MAN. NATHAN AND I ARE SO MUCH BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU POISONING OUR LIVES. "NATHAN AND I." TAKE ANOTHER PILL,BOOZY. NATHAN CUT YOU OUT OF HIS LIFE LONG BEFORE I DID. JEEZ. WHERE'S NATHAN? I NEED TO SEE HIM. NOT LIKE THIS YOU DON'T. DON'T KEEP ME FROM MY OWN SON! YOU'RE THE ONE RUINING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NATHAN. DON'T PUT THAT ON ME. I NEED TO SEE HIM! OH,GOD. MOM. HALEY,ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHE'S PREGNANT,MOM. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HER. WHY DON'T YOU FORGET I EXIST,AND WE'LL CALL IT EVEN,OKAY? - I'M SORRY. - NO,MOM,YOU'RE LEAVING. DO NOT COME BACK. I'M NOT DOING THIS ANYMORE. YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME WEIRD. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST REALLY HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD SEX. IT'S NOT THAT I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. I JUST WANT TO WAIT UNTIL I FIND THE RIGHT PERSON. BUT YOU'VE HAD GIRLFRIENDS? I'VE HAD ONE SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND,BUT... IT DIDN'T END WELL. DID YOU BREAK UP BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO HAVE SEX? YEAH. WITH MY BEST FRIEND. IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS CHEATING ON ME PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE TIME. WOW. THAT - THAT SUCKS. YEAH. I LOST MY GIRLFRIEND AND MY BEST FRIEND ON THE SAME DAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON. IT HAPPENED TO YOU,TOO? THEY DIDN'T HAVE SEX, BUT MY BEST FRIEND FELL IN LOVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND  TWICE. YOU GUYS STILL FRIENDS? NOT LIKE WE USED TO BE. I KNOW PEOPLE THINK THAT BEING IN CLEAN TEENS IS WEIRD, ESPECIALLY BEING A GUY. AND TRUST ME,IT'S NOT 'CAUSE I DON'T LOVE GIRLS. I DO. BUT I JUST WANTED TO START OVER,YOU KNOW? I MEAN,THE NEXT RELATIONSHIP I GET INTO IS GONNA BE WITH SOMEONE I CAN TRUST, SOMEONE WHO'S COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME. MOUTH,YOU DID NOT TELL ME RACHEL AND BEVIN WERE COMING. YOU GUYS NEED PEOPLE CHEERING FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO WIN, AND WHO'S BETTER AT CHEERING THAN CHEERLEADERS? PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T INVITE HALEY. I DIDN'T INVITE HALEY,BUT SKILLS TOLD PEYTON, WHO MIGHT HAVE TOLD LUCAS,SO THERE'S THAT. RIGHT. COMING. - HEY! - HI. TURN AROUND. GET DRESSED. YOU'RE COMING WITH US. OH,NO,I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING OUT TONIGHT. WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF ADVENTURE? IT PROBABLY GOT KNOCKED OUT OF ME WHEN I GOT HIT BY A CAR. WELL,SERIOUSLY,YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS. TRUST ME. IT'LL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER. - YEAH,YEAH,YEAH. - GO! SO,WHAT DO YOU THINK? ARE YOU READY TO STUDY? WELL,WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? UM... WE COULD DANCE. OH,N- I - COME ON. COME ON. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC. IT'S EASY. I'LL SHOW YOU. THIS ISN'T SO BAD,IS IT? IT BEATS STUDYING. MY PARENTS WOULD DANCE LIKE THIS LATE AT NIGHT, AFTER I WENT TO BED. I USED TO SIT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS IN MY FOOTIE PAJAMAS AND JUST WATCH THEM. THAT WAS,WHAT,A YEAR AGO? THEY WERE SO HAPPY AND SO IN LOVE. YOUR HEART IS BEATING REALLY FAST. IS IT? DUDE,THAT GUY'S GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK. I CHECKED OUT THE OTHER COMPETITION. THERE IS NO WAY YOU DON'T WIN. DID YOU GET A LOAD OF THE GUY WHO LOOKED LIKE CHEWBACCA? OH,HEY,I SAW THAT GUY. THAT DUDE IS FURRY. SKILLS,CHECK THIS OUT. MAN,THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. DAMN,IS IT HOT IN HERE,OR IS IT JUST ME? WELL,IT'S GONNA BE EVEN HOTTER ONSTAGE UNDER THOSE LIGHTS. YEAH?

THIS PLAN WAS YOUR IDEA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T GO ON? YOU SEE ALL THEM PEOPLE OUT THERE? YOU'VE PLAYED BASKETBALL IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. YEAH,BUT THEY DON'T BE ALL UP ON YOU LIKE THAT. PLUS I HAVE MY CLOTHES ON,MAN. OUR NEXT ACT IS "DOUBLE TROUBLE"! THAT'S US. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE? MAMA CAME TO SEE HER MAN DANCE,AND HER MAN'S NOT ONSTAGE. I KNOW,BABY,BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. BUT IF YOU DON'T DANCE FOR ME, THEN YOU WON'T GET TO SEE ME DANCE FOR YOU. THINK ABOUT IT. TAKE IT OFF! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR STAGE FRIGHT? MAMA CAME TO SEE HER MAN DANCE. NATHAN LOOKED GOOD TONIGHT. NO WONDER YOU'RE PREGNANT. OH,FUNNY. HOW'S CALCULUS GOING? FINE. WHY? I JUST THINK IT'S WILD HOW YOU WENT FROM FAILING TO FINE WITH JUST A FEW TUTORING SESSIONS. YOU'RE JUST GOOD,I GUESS. ANYWAY,SEE YOU. RACHEL,SOMEONE STOLE SOME TESTS FROM THE TUTORING CENTER, AND IF I FIND OUT THAT IT'S YOU,I AM TURNING YOU IN. IS THIS IMPORTANT? I'M RUNNING OVER TO KAREN'S FOR DINNER.
