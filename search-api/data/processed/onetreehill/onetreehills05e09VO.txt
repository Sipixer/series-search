Look closer. cut! Cut! Great. Really great work, mia. Excellent. Thank you guys very much. We can check that and move on. - Hey! - Hey. How crazy is this? It looks just like your classroom. It's so crazy. All right, it's good. Let's move on. Thank you. Um, I kind of need to get out of here. I don't know if you guys need me for closeups... no, no, no. You're good. Okay. All right, see you. Oh, haley. Okay, about the whole lucas engagement thing -- I just... you got to let him go, peyton. I know. It's just hard. It'll be okay. I'll see you at the game. This is so awesome. What's next? We go hand-held. Local boys make good. A new era dawns. Come on, find the story. Tonight's the big night, baby. First game of the season and broadcasting debut for marvin mcfadden. It's just a taped segment. I'm not even sure they're gonna run it. Man, they gonna run it. Look, you gonna throw down so hard, they gonna have to run it. Got an angle, right? Yeah, I'm thinking, "former state champions take over." Something like that. Yeah, that's all good. Well, look, if you need anything, I got you. All-access, baby. Hey, mouth. Relax, dog. You gonna do great, all right? Hey, sorry. I'll just be one more minute. I've never seen jamie so keyed up. He's so excited about this game. Everything all right? I have to tell you something. It's about carrie. I should probably be the one to tell her. I have to give my two weeks notice. Wh-wh-why? Because I got accepted to a graduate program that I thought I couldn't afford, but I got a last-minute scholarship offer, and I think I have to take it. Well, of course you do. Congratulations. We're gonna miss you. I hope jamie doesn't take it too hard. Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too. More than you know. Hey, luke. You, uh, working on the game plan? Actually, uh...I was just thinking about keith. Wishing he were here, you know? I've been thinking about jimmy all week. What I wouldn't give to trade this day for that one. I see they took dan's jersey down in the gym. I'm glad. Jimmy'd be proud of you. Thanks. You too. Good luck, luke. Thanks, mouth. You too. Oh, keith, please help me out tonight. what you think, ball? It's good? Yeah, good. Hey, peyton, is that really who you used to be? Yep, that's me. Come on. You were really cool. What happened? Watch it. So, tell me again -- we're going to see the team that your ex-boyfriend coaches, but now he's engaged to haley's friend, right? Okay. You want to see where I went to high school or not? No, totally. I just want to know who we hate before we get there. You see the girl showing off her cheap-ass engagement ring to my best friend? Yeah. Lindsey, right? That's who we hate. She knows exactly what she's doing. I cannot believe that lindsey invited brooke to the game. I mean, it's bad enough she's got lucas, but now she's got to snake in on my friends, too? I once put a hex on a girl I hated, and it totally worked. Really? Maybe you could give her a horrible rash or something for the wedding. Totally. So are we gonna go back or what? I mean, I'm pretty excited about this catfight. Okay, do you want to see the place where I got shot and almost bled to death or what? The catfight can wait. - Hey, we saved you a seat. - Thank you so much! Oh, I can't wait to get a good shot of jamie... with my camera that I don't have. It's in my classroom. Can we go with you? I'm dying to see teacher girl's classroom. All right. Come on. All right, let's go. Listen up. Four years ago, we won a state championship. And since then, there's been a lot of losing. But this is a new team, and this is your house. Good teams win at home. Every game. Every game. And this is a good team. Believe in that. Believe in each other. It all starts tonight, boys. A new team da erves new look. You should win half of your games just for looking so damn good. Jamie scott! You better suit up, too, son. Look at that! If q's hand isn't right, we might need you. Go, jamie! Go, jamie! This is so weird. I feel like I haven't walked these halls in 20 years. Hey. Isn't that mia? Mia? What are you doing here? - Hey, peyton. - Hey, check it out. It's my old friends, brooke and haley, and their new pal, lindsey. Peyton, we made plans for tonight before you -- before you called me a bitch. Bitch? No. No, I did not call you a bitch. I said I didn't like you. Peyton, um-- no, you don't have to make apologies to her, just like I'm not apologizing because I'm engaged to lucas and she's not. You know, I really was gonna try to be nice to you, but I think that's officially over. Works for me. Great. I'm gonna head back. Hey! If you get tired dragging that fat ass back to the gym, there is a water fountain down the hall. Whatever, you bulimic bitch. I can'T. There's no handle. They're fixing them over the weekend. So what's that mean? I think it means we're stuck. Help! Help! Somebody! Help us! Somebody! Somebody, please! Somebody get us out of here! Help! Lindsey, lindsey, nobody's gonna hear you. They're all at the game. We cannot be locked in here. I am totally claustrophobic. But it's, like, a huge library. It's the "locked in" part. Relax. You'll be okay. Okay, they're fixing all the other doors. No handles. And the phones seem to be out. All the calls will go through the office. Nobody's answering. Does anybody have cellphone reception? 'Cause I got nothing. I don'T. Nobody ever gets cellphone reception in here. Except for me, 'cause the world loves me! I'm gonna call mouth. I'll have us out of here in two seconds. hey, this is mouth. Please leave me a message. It went to voice mail. Well, there's got to be somebody else we can call to get out of here. Uh, call the police. 911. There's someone out there getting murdered, and we're gonna bother the police? No. There is somebody that we know who's not coaching or playing in this game. Don't ask me. I just moved here. Brooke. I don't want to. - Brooke. - I don't even know his number. What are you talking about? Brooke's gonna call owen, her new bartender crush, to get us out. I am not. It's too soon. Brooke, we're gonna miss the game. I don't want to call him! It violates all the rules of dating etiquette. I am gonna look desperate, he has to do us a favor, and then he can make fun of me for it. Oh, my god. Fine. I will call him, but if he does not sleep with me after this, it is your fault ¨C all of you. I think I'm okay with that. What? My battery just died! It's great! Isn't that great? Brooke, we're stuck! Uh, stuck is not good. Come sit down for a second, okay? All right, just breathe and close your eyes and try and think of a place that makes you happy and calm. You got it? Where are you? I'm with my dad. We're walking near walden pond. It's fall. The leaves are changing. You're not here. You're there. Better? Yeah. Hey, mia, are you okay? I'm great. I actually think this is kind of awesome. I can finally get to know you guys. I have questions. No. Now is not the time. Oh, come on. You guys totally fascinate me. Especially you, brooke. Really? Well, in that case, ask away, my dear. Okay. Like, you're really successful, right? Like, really cool and rich? Yes, yes, and yes. So why do you let that horrible stink of a mom boss you around all the time? You should quit being so nosy. Come on, brooke. You know she's not nice. I'm not talking about my mom. She doesn't appreciate you. She is my mother, all right? That doesn't make it right. Okay. It's time for the two new kids to stay the hell out of it, and as for you two, I expect you both to understand. What's that supposed to mean? You know what it means. Neither of your moms were around ¨C at least not in all the time that I've been friends with you. And I'm sorry for that, but what if you had a chance to have them back in your lives? Brooke, I would love to have them back -- both of them, all right? But I would hope that they'd be coming back because they love me, not because they wanted to run my label. Oh, the label i financed? Easy. I'm with you. Now. You are with me now, peyton, but for the last four years, my mom has been with me every day, helping me create a pretty great company. That'S...not true. I was with you when you created that pretty great company, and so was peyton. Maybe your mom made it bigger, but you created it all by yourself. You did. You made it great before your mom even stepped into the picture. You guys don't know anything about it. Maybe not, but I do know that a mother's love is unconditional, and you don't have to earn it, and you don't have to sign a fashion label to keep it. It just is. You don't know anything about it. you okay? I'm thinking I can breakthis window. Lindsey, somebody's gonna comeget us out of here. I can do it. No-- Okay. Jeez, that chairis really heavy. Hi. Check it out. I found librarianglaufelte's stash. We always knewshe was boozy. Do you want some? Whatcha readin'? B. Davis. She came upwith this, peyton. The magazine, the high-end clientele -- victoria did all of it. I know. But it's not called"V. Davis, " is it? All those years growing up, I just wanted her to see me. To see me and appreciate meand maybe love me. And now that I have it, even if it's forthe wrong reasons, it's hard to let it go. Can you understand that? Yeah. This is terrible. It's lucas' first game, we'restuck in this stupid library. Ah, I wish we knew the score. Ravens down by 8. Wait, let me refresh. Ravens down by 10. Are you online? Yeah. Brooke, peyton, come here. We got internet. Hey, you guys wantto see me at trick? Okay, there's got to be a waywe can use this to get out. Or at least order a pizza. I'm starving. No, that's it. Do we need to be thinkingabout food right now? We order pizza online. We have it delivered hereso we can get out. Okay, blackwell's pizzeria -- they are...open. You can order online, and they deliver. Nice. So, what are we getting? What kind of pizza? I don't know. Mushroom and sausage. - No mushroom, please. - Brooke. Actually, I'm totallywith brooke. Canadian bacon? Canadian bacon. Extra cheese. - You guys -- - just order the damn pizza. Do not yell at me. I'll yell at you if I want. Just order it! Freaking sausage, freaking canadian bacon, freaking mushroom ¨C I want to getthe hell out of here! We all want to get the hell out of here, okay? Don't yell at me! Calm down! God. Just no mushroom. There. It's ordered. Are we all happy now? What'd we get? No mushroom, brooke, okay? No "mush, " no "room" --no mushroom! Everybody, please relax, okay? The pizza guy's gonna come, he's gonna let us out, and maybe we'll makethe end of the game, so in the meantime, everybody just calm down! You did a great jobwith my record, haley. Thank you. Where did that come from? I don't know. I just think we tear each otherdown enough, you know? And sometimesyou should tell people the things thatyou love about them, like somethingthey're really great at or a quality they havethat you admire, and, I don't know, you did a really good job. Courage. Haley's courageous. And strong. And kind. See, don't you feel likeyou're pretty awesome now? Yeah, I kind off do. Okay, do me. What's great about me? Your voiceis an amazing gift. The fact that you came upwith this game. Your boobs. And your lips. I would kill for lips like that. You know? And you've got good legs. It's like a whole -- okay. Before this turns intoa women-in-prison film, I think we should move on. Um, lindsey. Your eyes are, like, not even fair. - You're also one of the smartestpeople I know. - I am not. And you're classy. You guys... peyton, isn't theresomething nice you'd like to sayabout lindsey? She got decent tastein men. This game sucks. I'm intimidated by peyton. I spent a yearediting a book that was basicallya love letter to her. I watched how caringand meticulous lucas was with the words he chosefor her, like he was stillholding on to her. Sometimes I thinkhe still is. Which is why he proposedto you, right? Yeah, I can see that. God, I hate this library. I found it. A way out? No. Lucas' book. I never read it. They replaced the carpet. This is wherelucas and I hid out during the school shooting, but they changed the carpet. It doesn't match. I'm not gonna tell youhow to be with lindsey... but most of your life, I've known youto take the high road. I knI know, brooke. I'm so sick of looking at herand her precious ring. You mean your precious ring? All right. One more. Score me. Score me, haley. Ravens are down by 9. Halftime. Wait. Hold on. Are you telling me lucas slept with peyton, brooke, and you, lindsey? Uh, yeah. Not all at the same time. Jeez, haley, you sureyou never got in on that? Ew, he's like my brother. I'm just saying. Jamie looks a lot like him. Ah, they're like twins. They are not! Yes, they are. And what inbred moron is takingso long with our pizza? Well, well, well. Oh, my god, 4, 000 hitsfor my video at trick. Listen to these comments. "You rock. Where can I buy this?" That's really great, mia. "This song is awesome. I'd love to seethis chick...naked." It's just one comment. No, wait, there's more. "Another pop princesswho can't sing or play. She looks like she smellslike dirty feet"? What's wrong with people? You need to stop. Do you know what people usethe internet for? - Porn and complaining. - Yep. But that's so not fair. They have to knowthere's somebody reading this. It's the easiest thingin the world to tear downsomebody's work. The hard partis actually creating it. It's criticismversus creation. - Do you love making music? - Yeah. Okay, so, the restdoesn't matter. Easy for you to say. They didn'tsay you smell like feet. Oh, sticks and stones, mia. Oh, right. This coming from the girl that couldn't handle itwhen I said I didn't like her. Okay. Let's just check the scorecardon this one, miss "pity me." You dated the guy two years ago, you disappeared, then you come back and expecthim to drop everything for the loveof your bony, jobless ass. Wtf? Okay, D.U.I. Nice work, haley. Better saveol' drinky here before I kick her spoiled assall the way back to walden pond. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Guess this is the second time you'll be bleeding all overthis library. You think that's funny?! Ken smith is in the lib-ra-zee! Oh, my god. Brooke, it's s tgoodo see -- no! You idiot! The door is locked! No, it's not. I just walked in, brooke. From the outside, tim. The door is lockedfrom the outside. We cannot get out! Girl, chill. I'll just call somebodyat the pizza place and have themsend someone ¨C I left my phone in my scooter. Motorcycle. It's a motorcycle. Well, since we're lockedin here all alone... who wants a piece? Extra sausage. Ravens trail by 9. Sold-out crowd. Come on, mouth. There's a great story here. Find it. Oh, my god. If you had to eat any partof a person to stay alive, what would you eat? What? Like -- I don't know -- say we ran out of foodand haley died. Thanks a lot. Okay, someone else dies, and we need to survive. What do you eat? I know what I'mstarting with. Don't say it, perv. Love handles. I'd make, like, beef jerkyout of their love handles. You could snack on thatfor days. I so would not eatsomeone's love handles. Well, you're gonna starve, and we're all gonna eat you. No one gonna's eat me, either. No! You know, i could eat your necklike a vampire. You guys, seriously. What's the big deal? You're dead, and I'm hungry. Yeah, don't you want usto live? We're hungry, brooke. Okay. Chow down, but I am gonna haunteach and every one of you. I believe in ghosts. Totally. Yeah, don't evenget me started. Do you believein ghosts, lin? Um... I think if someonedies suddenly, especially before their time, maybe they get confused. They don't knowto leave a place. You think they're stillhere, then? Jimmy edwards and keith? I wish you were heretonight, jim. We were supposed to dothis together. And this is a pictureof my son. A lot of people sayhe looks like me, but I'm not quite surehe's that handsome. He's really something. What's his name? Nathan. Mine's snow day. My happy place. Lindsey's is walden pond. Mine's a snow day in ohio. No school. I'd stay in bedunder the warm covers, and my mom would bring mehot chocolate. How 'bout you, peyton? Your mom ever bring youhot chocolate on a snow day? No, I di I didn't have a whole lotof snow days. Brooke and I did builda pretty killer snow fort once. And you sat in it, and you worried that your liveswere about to change. Just because you edited a bookabout my life doesn't mean you know anythingabout me. I didn't mean anything by it. I was just -- it's a beautiful story. That's nice, mia. Thanks. I've had this melody forever and just don't havethe lyrics yet. Why don't you keep playing itand maybe we can help you? I think maybe we should probably just work on thatin the studio, alone. Oh, for god's sakes. What am I gonna do --steal mia's song? I don't know. Songs? Friends? What about you, scraggly? I heard you stole lucasfrom brooke once. Pot, meet kettle. Ass, meet face. Pot, meet kettle, ass, meet face I don't thinkthat's gonna work, guys. Wait! That's hot! No, drop that bomb again! I got something. Yeah? All right, ready? Okay. One, two, three, four... straight from the ghetto, packing wood like geppetto ain't gonna bathe till I look like jared leto Nice. Don't laugh at him. Uh -- you're right. Creation versus criticism. Let me try one. Two, three, four... my name's peyton fake, blond peyton I don't have a boyfriend 'cause I'm a bitch Play it again, mia. Guys, we need to stop. Mia. One, two, three, four... her name's lindsey --man-faced lindsey and her fianc? proposedto me first with the very same ring! - You're lying. - Oh, you didn't know? - Peyton. - No, is she gonna cry? - Stop it. - Go ahead --let's cry, little rich girl. I said stop it. Is daddy gonna throw youa great, big, huge wedding at walden pond for his littlecrybaby daughter? Peyton, you don't knowwhat you're talking about! It's fine, haley. Daddy'sgonna make everything better for the little rich girl thatgot everything she ever wanted! He's dead! All right, peyton? He's dead. He died two years agofrom cancer, but not until he couldn't walkor talk or even recognize me. Does that make you happy? Does that make you feel better? That his death is with meevery day, that I was the one who hadto turn off the ventilator because my mother wastoo destroyed to do it? You wantto hear the sound he made before he tookthat last breath? Oh, 'cause I can still hear itexactly how it sounded. Oh, does thatmake you happy? - Are you glad that my lifeisn't perfect? - lindsey I used to admire the peytonfrom the book. She seemed so noble...kind. I wish she were here, peyton. That version of you. What happened to her? I was true as the sky is blue but I couldn't soon say the same for you, no, no so now I find denial in my eyes I'm mesmerizedby the -the picture that's in my mind now oh-ho, so tell me when I finally seeyour shattered heart what it is, yeah 'cause I don't want tokeep on believing in illusions no, no, no 'cause I've seen your act and I know all the facts I'm still in love with you, I wish you were here and it ain't hard to see who you are underneath I'm still in love with you, I wish you were I wish you were here, I wish you were here  God, the last time I was trappedin the school was the shooting. You know how lindsey and igot so close? She was, um, editing lucas' book, and I still wasn't really sureabout her 'cause I was rooting for lucasto be with my friend peyton... or maybe even brooke. Um, anyway, she -- she was working on the chapterabout the shooting, and she said to me, "I want this to be lucas'best writing -- the best he has in him -because peyton deserves it." "Jimmy and keith deserve it, and that day deserves it." And we've been friendsever since. can I please talkwith you? I'm sorry. God, lindsey, I'm sorry. I am so sorry for what I saidabout your father, okay? I lost my mom to cancer, and I... I'm sorry. I don't know what it is, but for whatever reason, you bring outthe insecurities in me, and I end up being the worstpossible version of myself. Welcome to the club. Haley told me what you said about wanting to get thatchapter right in the book, the one aboutthe school shooting. And I think that's what makes itso hard, you know ¨C the fact that lucas has foundthis person that's so great and that has sucha big heart. And it was never my ring. I was just tryingto hurt you. And the only reasonI recognized it is 'cause that's the ringkeith gave karen when he proposed to her, before he walkedinto this school and never walked out again. So you have to know how muchlucas loves you if he wanted youto have it. Why would you tell me that? So you stop doubting it. So we stop doing this. I mean, god, you gave mea clean slate, and I said something dumbthat I didn't even mean, and I was just too stubbornto take it back. I guess it's obvious that I'm not the peytonin the book anymore. The truth is, I never was. I think you were. And I think you still are. It's just... you're notthat couple anymore. And in a way, it breaks my heart, 'cause I really was rootingfor them. But lucas and I have writtenour own chapter now, and that's a chapteri won't apologize for. No, you don't have to. And you don't have a man faceor a big ass. The fact is, you havea pretty great ass, so... Okay. Before this turns intoa women-in-prison film... maybe we should move on. Moving on sounds... overdue. "N"? Mono. Monkey. Yes! Well, guess it's time for meto get back to work. But you're forgetting something, short bus. The door's locked. No big deal. What? Oh, my god! Did you know how to do thatthis whole time?! Why didn't you saysomething? I miss you guys. Nobody keeps in touch anymore. Would you look at that? You can still see where dan'sjersey used to hang. It's kind of eerie, huh? You know, that's weird. I expected to see lindsey here. Have you talkedto haley tonight? Now that you mention it, no, but I've been tryingto avoid her. What's going on? You kissed peyton, didn't you? Okay, I know you want to call mea dick, and that's fine -- I kissed carrie. You're a dick. I know. Actually, she kissed me, but it still happened, and I feel terribleabout it, man. I'm not that guy, luke. Are you sure? I mean, if you hadanother chance to do it, would you do it again? No. Absolutely not. I love haley. Okay. Luke, every time I try to keepsomething from haley, it just makes it worse. I'm gonna tell her. She deserves to know. Ready to go home now, daddy? I got to stop beingmy father and start being the fathermy son thinks I am. There was a high schoolbasketball game tonight somewhere in america. A team won, and a team lost. That's not the real story. The real story is about fathersand sons. It's about life and time. And change. All right. I'll see you later. See ya. Girls and boyswent to the game. They dressed pand hoped to fit in. Some did. Some didn'T. if is okay, I thought, since I came with them - yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. I want you to. And you know why? 'Cause you are my best friend, brooke davis, and you always will be. Yes, I will. Love you. It's a story that has historyand chapters yet to be written. You ready, rock star? My name's peyton fake, blond peyton I don't have a boyfriend'cause I'm a bitch what? It's catchy. Whatever. You look likeyou smell like feet. Hi. I was looking for you. I was here. whatcha thinking about? Keith. He'd be proud of you. There was a high schoolbasketball game tonight somewhere in america. Reporters will report. They'll tell youwho the high scorer was and what the keysto the game were. But that's not the real story.
