to play. Well, nathan, your playing days are over. Come on. You must know that. The magazine, the line - You can have everything. Do you know they didn't even want to do a book tour? What could possibly be more important than chicago? My wedding. It's peyton. It's mick. He's my father. He's coming over for dinner. Shut up and pour, okay? I'm not dead. Sure, you are.  -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://Www.Ragbear.Com==- ÀºÇòÐÖµÜ µÚÁù¼¾ µÚ6¼¯ -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é==- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£ºÂ¬ ±ó</font> Why do guys insist on packing their bags At the last possible minute? We do it to torture you. ???? Big day, huh? Yeah. Anyhow, the first signing's always the most stressful. Yeah. But i get to see mouth today. That'll be fun. I still don't understand why they're sending you to omaha To launch the book tour. Well, they like to generate a little buzz Before the bigger markets, you know? Worked for the last book. I wish i could go with you. It's not too late. Oh, yeah. 'Cause that wouldn't be awkward - You, your fiancéE, your ex-FiancéE. Peyton. I'm sorry. I know lindsey is your editor. I just - I'm jealous that she gets you for the next week, And i get mick. Great. Why do you think he's avoiding Admitting that he's your father? I don't know. Maybe i'm wrong. Maybe he's not. Either way, i will be all right. Don't worry about me. You know i will. I'll call you when i land. Yeah. I love you. Don't forget me when you're a big star, lucas scott. Mm-Hmm. * so many years apart i've missed * You know, hales, with everything you've been through lately, I'm sure principal turner would understand If you needed a little more time off. I think two weeks of replaying that day In my head is enough. It's time for me to get back to my life. Besides, it will be nice to have the distraction. If you need me, you know i'm here. Yeah. You know what? Let's cut through shop. You can cut through shop? You were such a nerd in high school. I was an honor student! Exactly. Nerd. "Nerd." You don't know what you'd do without me. Nathan! So, you want to tell me why you were sleeping In the backseat of a car at school? Well, it was either there Or that smelly couch in the teacher's lounge. I can't believe you sit on that thing. For the record, i don't go near that thing. So, tell me where you live Because i'm pretty sure it's not in shop class. I live in a foster home. Okay. Well, give me your number. I'm gonna need to speak with your foster parents. Hell no. Please. That'll just make it worse. This is none of your business, okay? Sam, if there's a problem at home, tell me. I can get you some help. There's not a problem. This is one of the better fosteromes i've been in. The others were... Not so good. So it's just a little crowded. It's okay. It's not okay, sam. Is there anybody that was worried That you didn't come home last night? You don't get it. Nobody cares. It's kind of like being invisible. Cash their checks, i don't get slapped around. That's the deal. And it's a pretty good deal. So don't screw this up for me. Sam, i can't just pretend like this didn't happen. You're 15 years old. There has to be something better for you. You seem nice, but i'm not your girl. I'm not anybody's girl. It happens. Sam! Millie: look who it is - The world's best boss. And what are you buttering me up for? Nothing. We just have lots to do. Millie, i love you dearly, But you realize we are standing in a clothing store That has no clothes in it,</i> And i am fresh out of ideas. Are you sure about that? What is that? I wrote down a list of ideas. And then you covered them with a sheet? Yeah, that was more for effect. I've always wanted to pull a sheet off something And say "voil?" All right, well, now's your big chance. "Go skydiving"? You didn't let me say "voil?" I'm sorry. But, look. Skydiving sounds really fun and all, But how is it gonna help this company? Well, maybe before you can heal the company, You have to heal your soul a little first. "Ride a motorcycle. "Learn to speak french. "Get drunk at oktoberfest. Watch every james bond movie." Millie, why do these all sound so familiar? Because they're all your ideas. You're always talking about stuff you wanted to try, And victoria either said they were stupid Or you were too busy. So while she was telling me I couldn't do any of these things... I was writing them down so someday you could. Welcome to someday, brooke davis. * maybe they had it made somehow * * living for there and then * * under a psychedelic spell * Thank you. So, you gonna show me something? * still they had so much to tell * * whatever happens to the dreamers * Hey, man. What the hell was that? That was game. We not working on your jumper, So why would you pull up like that? You cut off the lane. So, don't let me cut the lane off, then. What if your jumper not falling that day? So, what? You too scared to get physical? You want physical? Yeah. * it's only when they close their eyes * Hoo-Hoo. That's what i'm talking about, baby. Whoo! You're doing great, honey. Thanks.Thanks. Just check the ball. * i love you, i do * * nothing's ever been this way before * * a dream is just a dream and nothing more * * nothing's ever been this way before * * a dream is just a dream and nothing more * Were you ever sober for an entire year?</i> What part of "rock guitarist" don't you get? That's what i thought. If you don't mind, i'll have that back. Why? So you can keep lying to yourself? You wouldn't understand. You're right. You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand any of this. Honestly, i wish you hadn't have come here. I would have sucked at being your father! ???At's why ellie and i gave you up. There, i said it. Are you happy now? After 22 years, That is the best you can give me -</i> "There, i said it"? That's all i got. Thanks, dad. You can go now. This is why i like being on the road. Hey, grandpa. Where's nanny deb? I'm here to pick you up today.</i> Really? Cool. So, wh do you want to do? Well, that depends. What do you and nanny deb usually do after school? Um, eat lots of ice cream. That doesn't sound like deb. Are you sure she lets you eat ice cream after school? No. She makes me eat veggies instead, Because they'll help me grow big and strong. You want to know a little secret? Most adults will tell you almost anything To get you to eat your veggies, and most of it's not true. Well, carrots really do give you x-Ray vision, right? No. What? * so let me in * So, grandpa, do i really get to make a wish For every brussels sprout i eat? No, actually, they taste bad for no reason at all. Come on. Hey, slow down there, buddy. You're gonna give yourself a brain freeze. Mmm. Is that good? Well, well. What have we here? Oh. Guess what? They kiss a lot.</i> * well, they said you was long gone * You want some more? Hey, little buddy. Hi, uncle skills. Hi, nanny deb. Ice cream after school. And i thought i was a bad nanny.</i> Yeah. Well, you know, They ran out of all those x-Ray vision carrots. *... and said all right * So, granny deb, can i talk to you? * babydoll, the men who hang like flowers in your hall * * are asking when your love... * Is skills out of high school yet? Uh, yeah, dan. He graduated the day you turned yourself in for murder. And if you've come here to criticize me - I haven't. I wanted to thank you for telling the parole board The truth about carrie. You did the right thing. Did i? Are we done here? Yeah, that's all i wanted to say. Good. Have a nice life, dan. What's left of it. * 'cause i can stay or, honey... * Let's go, antwon. See you at home, sweetie. * just to wherever you tell me so * * and find my place there * Oh, it hurts. It really hurts.</i> Yeah, i know how you feel. Oh, my head. Hey. Did you eat all the orange chicken? Sorry. Mouth usually gets9a the mongolian beef And i eat all the orange chicken. Lucky for you i like mongolian beef.</i> How you doing... Being away from him? To be honest, i wish he'd just come home. If you ever decide you want to leave, you just o. No questions asked. Thanks, brooke, but you've always been there for me. I think it's my turn to be here for you. * babydoll * Lucas scott. Lon. I'm with putnam and pratt. It's nice to meet you. So, is lindsey gonna mt us at the bookstore? No, lindsey's in new york. I'm gonna be taking her place on the tour. Oh. Well, i guess it's just you and me, then. Yep. So, uh, what'd you think about the book? To be honest, i haven't had a chance to read it yet, But, hey, it's at the top of my to-Do list. "Comet," right? I love science-Fiction. Taking a trip down memory lane? I was just dropping off jamie. I know. I heard about quentin fields. I'm sorry. He was a good basketball player. Yeah. ??? Makes you wonder how somebody could do something like that. It was good to see you, son. You saved my wife. You saved my son. But you killed my uncle, right here where i'm standing. I don't know where that leaves us. At least my son loves you. And my son hates me. Both of them. I thought i said you could go. Yeah, well, i... thought we should talk. Okay. I want to know why you came here Pretending not to be my real dad. What's a real dad? I mean, you got a dad, And obviously he did a good job with you. So why do you have to keep pushg it? Because it matters! So all this is just because i couldn't tell you the truth? No! No. All of this because you have missed my whole life, And it really doesn't seem to bother you. You know, i think you're right. It's probably a good time for me to just move on. Great. I'm glad we can agree on something. * good arms versus bad arms... * You know, this turnout isn't exactly inspiring me To read your book, lucas. Whose brilliant idea was it To put this signing in the science-Fiction section? It's a book about space, right? No, actually, um, the comet's a metaphor. It's a love story. Well, you know what? We could have had this thing out in the middle of main street, We wouldn't have gotten any more traffic. Thanks for the support. Yeah. Will you sign my book? Yeah, of course i will. What's your name? Hadley. Hadley. That's a really pretty name. You know, my best friend's name is haley. But, uh, i like "hadley" better. Thanks. Uh, actually, this is a "gossip girl" book. I know - My favorite. *... rest at arm's length * * when they reach out, don't touch them * Here you go. Thanks. Mouth. Oh, my god. It's good to see you, man. Lucas scott - Big-Time writer. Am i the, uh, last one to arrive? A- Actually, you're the first. Oh? Yeah. Oh. * i decided this decision some... * When did brooke davis become all work and no play? I am actually playing right now. I'm gonna take skydiving lessons. You want to come with me? Ah, thanks, but, no. No, thank you. Come on. I'm looking up the safest places to go. Okay, well, i'm pretty sure they're all equally unsafe. Listen. Would you be interested in fostering a child? Well, i guess it would depend on the situation. Do you remember sam? She's, um - She's the one that stole from your store. It figures she'd get pregnant. She's so young!</i> No, she's not pregnant. It's her. She's the one that needs fostering. But she's so old. Well, she's 15. Look, i found her sleeping In the backseat of a car in shop class, And her current foster parents Didn't even know that she was gone. Well, maybe they can foster her in jail, 'Cause it's where she's headed. I think she's just acting out for attention. It kind of reminds me of somebody else I used to know in high school. Haley, i'm sorry, but... I can't take in a teenager right now. Find me a cute little baby in shop class, We can talk about it. That's okay. I- I totally understand. It's just... I think of jamie and how i would do anything to protect him. And then i look at sam, And i wonder... who's protecting her. Well, this is officially embarrassing. Luke, it's not that bad. I've signed exactly two books today, One of which was a "gossip girl" book. I hear those are pretty good. That's not helping, mouth. I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's just omaha. I doubt it. My first book sold really well here. This can't be good. Well, then, look on the bright side. You get to hang out with an old friend. Can i get a picture? Yeah, sure. All right, sweet. Okay. Right there. Thanks. Sorry, luke. Say it. Actually, i'd rather not. Come on. Just say it. This is marvin mcfadden on sports, And you've just heard a mouthful. Nice! Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. So, how'd it go with brooke? She's just not ready to take in A rebellious teenager right now. Well... she could stay with us. No. I thought about that, But jamie's been through so much. It's just not a good time for him. Yeah. So have you. Hello. Nate - Mike wilson. Listen. I heard you were looking For the opportunity to play ball again. Yes, sir? Well, i have one for you. But it might not be exactly what you're thinking. * come on * * wow * * wow * Wow. ??? Man, that can't be good for nobody's back.</i> This is the coolest thing i've ever seen. You have to do this, daddy. Yeah. Brooke. What is all this? I have to tell you something. Okay. I'm sorry, but i lied to you. I didn't fall down the stairs, peyton. So, what are you thinking, man? For real? Yeah. Well, i was wondering If your mom would ever get back with your dad. Man, i'm not talking about this with you. Well, you asked me what i was thinking about. That's what i was thinking about. That's not what i meant. And will you stop trying to act Like this situation with my mom is for real? What's that supposed toúMean? You know exactly what it means. The only people signing off on this Are you, her, and jamie, okay? Look at that boy. He's just jumping around, having fun. I mean, after everything he been through lately, He just keep going. Won't let nothing beat him down. That's a strong kid right there. He gets that from his mom. No. He gets it from both of you. Owen: well, well. Guess it's official. They will let anyone play in this league.</i> I see that. How you doing, man? Good, man. You know skills, right? What's up, skills? You really think victoria Could have done something like that to you? No. I mean, i don't know. I think i needed somebody to blame. I wish you would have told me. I wanted to, but i didn't know how. Honey, i am your best friend. I love you. That is why you have me. And it kills me that i wasn't able to be there for you. It's gonna sound weird, But i was just really embarrassed. I felt weak and... You and luke were so happy,</i> And i did not want to ruin that for you. No. Hey. I never want you to think That you can't come to me for anything. I'm here for you forever. Promise? Yeah! Of course i promise. You're stuck with me. I'm really sorry that i've been distant. I'm trying to get back. It's just gonna take a little while. I'm not going anywhere... ever. Lucas. We need to talk. Okay, but, please, when we get to seattle, Don't set me up in the science-Fiction section. There isn't gonna be a seattle. And what about the $est of the tour? It's over. I'm sorry. Because of one bad signing? Let's face it. If they didn't come out to see you here in omaha, They're not gonna come see you in the bigger markets. I need to talk to lindsey. She believes in this book. It wasn't her decision. And if it makes you feel any better, She didn't agree with it. That's why you didn't read the book. Lucas - You are - You knew this was gonna happen. They sent you to deliver the bad news.</i> What are you - The grim reaper? I've been called worse. I'm sure you have. I am sorry, lucas. Go home, write another book. I promise i'll read the next one. * guess it ends here * Oh. Dude, do you know what this reminds me of? What? Um, remember second grade When you found out how much money martha stewart made, And you started your own cookie business? Oh, my god - Brookies. Brookies! The only thing worse than the name Was the actual cookie. ??? They were terrible! And you almost burnt my house down. No. No, i didn't. Yes, you did! I did not. I set off one smoke detector, And your dad acted like i almost burned the house down.</i> He was so mad at me. No, he was just worried about us. It felt kind of nice To have somebody worried for a change. Hey, speaking of larry, Uh, you're not the only one keeping secrets. I probably should have told you this. I've met my birth dad. What? Yeah, it's mick - The guitarist. Are you serious? What's he like? Ohh. Um... he's a mess. I mean, it's cool that he's a musician, But he's just really not what i expected him to be. Yeah, i'm sorry, peyton. I know how it feels. If only we could pick our parents. Yeah, but then you look at larry, And it's pretty cool when they get to pick you.</i> I'm sorry omaha wasn't everything You hoped it would be, luke. Oh, it isn't that bad. At least oed today was mine.9? How about you, huh? Is omaha everything you hoped it would be? I like it here. I mean, they love their sports. You should see this place during the college world series. The whole city gets into it. I have the job i've always dreamed of. Well, it sounds like you're right at home. That's the thing. It's not home.</i> At least not without millie. Yeah, how is that working for you? It hasn't been easy. The truth is i'm kind of lost without her, But she knows how important this job is to me, So we'll make it work. I'm sure you will. So, you're headed back to tree hill. You gonna be okay? I'll survive. Like my mom always says, you know, "Whenever you're having a bad day, "Someone else out there is having a worse day. So just stop and focus on all the good things." I mean, think about it. She's right. Today, i got to hang out with one of my best friends, And then tonight, i get to go home to peyton. Sounds like a pretty good day. I mean, i'm not gonna lie. I was really looking forward to this book tour. I guess i just thought that... I'd be on top of the world for a couple weeks. Yeah, me too. Hey, what's up, jamie? How you doing, buddy? Sorry, owen. I'm on team brooke. Did it just get cold in here? Yeah, i don't blame him. I screwed that up. It's none of my business, man.</i> So, what you think, man? You gonna come play for us? We need a scorer. I - I don't know. It's fun out there, nate - Flying through the air. Nothing like it. I'm just worried my back Can't take something like this right now. It's not as bad as it looks. Besides, they got springs in the floor. It's gonna be easier on your back than hardwood. Yeah, but on a hardwood floor, The other players can't knock you out. Just remember - They can't hit you if they can't catch you. Ohh. That won't be you. How do i look? For a guy wearing too much makeup, you look pretty cute. Thanks. I miss you.</i> Omaha's just not the same without you.</i> Tree hill's not the same without you. Have a good show. Call me later. Hi. I was just heading home. What do you got there?</i> Cookies. They're mostly burnt, but it's the thought that counts. Enjoy. Thanks. Um, i added a few more ideas to the list. "Be a mom." It's no fun being alone. Okay, before we jump into the day's scores,</i> I wanted to follow up on a story</i> We did a couple of weeks ago about darren rivers.</i> Now, for those of you who just landed on earth,</i> He's the pro-Bowl quarterback Who shocked the world last month</i> When he retired from the nfl, Turning down a $68 million contract extension</i> So he could spend more time with his family.</i> Now, naturally, i put up a czy meter</i> With darren's face in the middle of it.</i> I gave him an 8 out of 10. Well, it turns out he might be the least crazy all of us.</i> You see, he just realized that money isn't everything.</i> I think sometimes we all lose sight</i> Of what really matters the most.</i> Darren rivers just figured it out before i did.</i> So, darren, please accept my sincere apology,</i> And i'm officially moving you down the crazy meter</i> From an 8 to a 3. Because let's face it - You still turned down $68 million.</i> In the american league... hello?</i> Hi. How's my favorite author? He was just thinking about his fiancéE. Oh, well, should i give you five minutes? No, i was just packing. You off to seattle? Um... Actually, i'm coming home. They canceled my book tour. What are you talking about? Why? It doesn't matter. No, it does matter. You worked so hard for this.</i> Hey, it's okay, peyton. I still have you, and that's all that really matters. Besides, this book brought us back together, so... It's the best thing i've ever written. You come home to me, then. I love you. I love you, too. I'll be home soon. Bye. ...1-0. Two words - Batting practice. Pass it on.</i> This isn't soccer. That's it, omaha. I'm marvin mcfadden on sports, And you've just heard a mouthful.</i> We'll be right back after this.</i> What are you doing here? It's kind of late to be out alone. Well, i don't have a curfew. Yeah. Hmm. I didn't have a curfew either. When i was your age, It was just me and my parents' credit cards. Lucky you. Not really. It would have been nice to have someone to talk to. Parents are overrated. Sometimes. Two weeks ago, my mom told me she never wanted me. Well... my mom gave me up when i was born, So, in a way, she told me she didn't want me. At least she didn't wait 35 years like yours did. I'm not 35! Do i look 35 to you?! I don't know. Uh, look, i-I got to get going. Like you said, it's getting late. Listen. Look, i know this is... Totally out of the blue, And i'm surprising myself by saying it, but... I have an extra room, and it's yours if you want it. You can come and go as you please - Whatever. So, what do you say? I don't need this. I can take care of myself. Yeah, i know you can, ???Right now. * moon pours through the ceiling tonight * Sam, if you're that uncomfortable in my house, You can always sleep in my car. * shows me we're right for each other * You don't come around for 22 years, And now you won't go. Well, i wanted to leave you with something. This chip is the only truly meaningful thing that i own, And, um, now it's yours. That was ellie's the year she was pregnant with you. And, uh, to tell the truth, you saved her life, peyton. She was hell-Bent on staying sober during the pregnancy, And that was hard for her. * only the heartaches have given me sight * But it was so much harder giving you up.</i> Then why did she? Because we thought there was a better life For you out there. We couldn't raise a kid, not in our world. But i don't think ellie ever really got past it. Why didn't you just tell me that? I don't know. Maybi didn't want to mess With the picture you had in your head Of what your birth father was really like - Something better than me, something more heroic. I guess i just didn't want to disappoint you. * more than yesterday * Anyhow, i, uh, made a few calls. I'm gonna jump on the last leg Of this tour for a few weeks. It's what i do. I'm sorry. * only the heartaches have given me sight * People always leave? Sometimes that's a good thing, huh? But, for what it's worth, you're doing great, kid. I'll see ya. Mick. Thank you. For what? For giving me up. * yeah, yeah * Oh. Ugh. Hey. These are for you. I just figured you deserve to be with somebody Who gave you flowers. Mmm, they're perfect. Hey! Saw the show. What'd you think? You were great, mouth. Thanks. What time's your flight? About an hour. Well, i have this crazy idea. What if you didn't get on it? No offense, mouth, but i cangt be your millie. What do you think about driving back?</i> You're coming home. I guess i never really left. Yeah, but what about your dream job? Dream job or dream girl? Dream girl. No contest. Although i'm kind of becoming the flakiest employee ever, But i don't care. I miss millie, and i miss my friends. It just took me a little while To realize what was important. All right, let's do it. Yes! But i'm driving. You got a book to read. Are you gonna make me read your book</i> With you sitting right next to me?</i> Cover to cover. I may even quiz you. Well, it's aaood thing i like science fiction. Ohh. * the subject of some new disgrace * * her whole story was so obvious to me * Did you make the team? Well, that all depends on what my wife thinks. This league is - Is different. Different how? Well, it's called slamball. It's called slamball? Yeah. That sounds physical. It's not... really. It's a lot of dunking, and it's kind of It's called slamball. Uh... Look, here's the thing. I'm not ready to give it up yet, But no team is gonna give me a tryout Unless i prove that i'm healthy. So i thought this would... I don't know. You really think you can still play?</i> I know i can. And no one else will give you a tryout? Make that shot. Okay. Back up now and try it again. One more time. *... when we got married * * there were things i never said * They are crazy not to give you a tryout. Ugh. Go play slamball. Yeah? Yeah. And this is officially a comeback, nathan scott. * you know when a heart's in pain * So, this is it. * there's nobody... * Check it out. * the only light under the doctor's knife * * is that we're the same * * hearts in, hearts in, hearts in * This is your room.

Sawyer. * you know when a heart's in pain * Hi, dad. How are you? No, no, no. Everything's okay. I just, uh... I just want to tell you that i love you, And thanks for being my dad. I miss you, too. * to make this go away * Hey, little man. You've been through a lot lately. How you doing? I have nightmares sometimes. I get scared. You do? ??? Sure. So do i. Hey, i have an idea. How about i sleep in here tonight Just in case i get scared? Okay. I'll protect you. Oh! Okay. What if i get scared? I'll protect you, too. My hero. Oh, geez. Ohh. I didn't know it was gonna get that crowded! So, what do you think of the book so far? Dude, seriously. Quit asking me. I will throw this book out the window. That's the only signed one in the world. It's a collector's item. We'll always have omaha, mouth. You just said a mouthful. Nice.
