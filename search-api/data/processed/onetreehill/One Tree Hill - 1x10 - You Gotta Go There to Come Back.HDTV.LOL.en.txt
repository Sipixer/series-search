You ever have a tough decision to make, and you wonder if you made the right choice? Well, what kind of choice are you talking about? Well… Morning Boyfriend… again. Thank You. I think you’re good. Keith, Brooke. Brooke, my uncle Keith. Hi. Hi. We gotta get out of here, alright. Yeah okay. Oh don’t forget your moms calling from Italy 6 pm sharp. Oh right, alright I’ll be here, promise. Okay. So if my parents come home, I’m gonna act like I have amnesia, so don’t freak out if I pretend not to know you. Look, I think I should get back to the madness. But hey, if I could, I’d stay like this all day. Okay. Nathan, about last night… Hey, look, its not about sex with me, okay? When you’re ready, I’ll be too. Come here. Special Delivery for Mrs. Dan Scott. What are you doing here? I wanted to apologize for last night. We were both spent. We both said things we regret. At least I know I did. - Dan… - These are for you. And, I made a reservation at Chatley Resort. Remember the view? Dan… if you’re in the mood to mend fences, start by devoting a weekend to your son. One without your inflated expectations of him. If you hadn’t noticed the only quality time you’ve spent with him lately was in an emergency room. You figure out how to make sure that never happens again then maybe you and I can talk. It’s not that hard, alright? Peyton and I just don’t make sense as a couple. She said so herself. And then took it back. Now what are you? Her lawyer? I’m just… look, I’ve seen Peyton really try to make an effort to turn things around and it just sucks that she got bit the first time she reached out to somebody, you know? Haley, I’m not the bad guy here, okay? Peyton’s just too… hard. Unlike Brooke who I understand is nice and easy. Excuse me. She makes me laugh. She’s honest, she’s not afraid to be herself. Okay? Plus she’s not covered head to toe in issues. What’s so bad about that? Nothing! Nothing. If you’re happy, I’m happy. Are you? Happy. Yeah. I hope you’re right. Hey, I’ve been two-waying you all day, where have you been? Nowhere really. I wanted to talk to you about Lucas. You left so quick the other night. What was that all about? Did he tell you what happened? We didn’t really do much talking after you left, if you know what I mean. I was just returning a CD I borrowed. Late night? Yeah. Who’s the girl? You don’t know her. Come on, man. We’re gonna be late for practice. Nice to see you vertical. How you feeling? Same as always. What’s this all about? Seems to me, we’ve lost track of what this game’s supposed to be about. Myself included. I want you to take this time, and think about why we’re really out there. Till then, no practice. This sucks. Speak for yourself. Whitey just did me a favor. Yeah, me too. Peyton. What? Look, about last night, I feel really bad about what happened… Can we not relive it, please? I’d had this really weird, long day, and I just… - I probably wasn’t making any sense. - No, you were. But I had no idea you were coming over last night, you know. And Brooke and I were just… Make a really good couple. I’m happy for you. You’re a good guy, Luke. And she’s my best friend. Business seems to have dropped off lately, and I’m beginning to take it personally. Oh don’t, no, it’s the University, they’re on a break. It will pick up soon. Oh. You know, Karen actually always thought we should do live entertainment to bring people in, like um… like an open mic night. Hmm, well that’s a great idea. - You think? - Yeah absolutely. But  let me run it by Lucas first, you know, make sure he’s ok with the idea. Yeah or, I could talk to him. I mean, he hasn’t popped in much lately. Yeah yeah, I’ve noticed. No that’s one of the reasons I want to talk to him myself. Okay. Well, if you have this ghost town under control, then I have a study session with Nathan. Haley, I’m glad you’re seeing Nathan. He’s lucky to have someone like you. Thanks. Bye! What are you doing? D ocumenting. A day without Cheer. Hour one. There’s something wrong with this picture though. Oh I know what it is, I’m not in it! Come here. Would you please draw your freaky drawings later? There is no basketball, we’re young, we’re gorgeous, we have all this free time so lets go do something fun. What about Lucas? I’m sure he’d be up for some fun. Probably some polaroids too. Lucas, the monkey in the room. Elephant. Whatever. Look, I came to make sure there’s no weirdness about that. You’re my best friend and I would never cut you out for a guy. Okay? No matter who he is. Or how happy he makes me. Brooke, I’m cool with you and Lucas. You sure? Yeah, I just wanna draw for a little bit. How about a rain check? Count on it. Hoes over bros. I am gonna borrow this though. Incase he’s feeling frisky. Thanks! Tell me I heard this wrong It’s called knocking. You did not just cancel practice. You ever play the ponies, Danny? What do you think of a Whirly Bird in the third? You think that’s a win place or show? Have you completely lost it? You have a perfect season. You see that sign in the gym? It’s got my name on it. Means I call the shots. The game’s not fun anymore, Danny. Somewhere along the way we’ve strayed off the path. You’re supposed to be their coach, a leader. That is something that we agree on. We’ve driven him too hard, Danny. What are you talking about? Dehydration. We both know it’s more than that. So now you’re a doctor. I’ve taken steps to ease the pressure. I think you’d be well advised to take a couple of days and do the same. Hit the lights on the way out, would you? Hey. How you feeling son? Okay. What’s my bag doing here? Well I packed some things for you. - Dad, I’m not gonna move to the beach house. - You’re not gonna have to, we’ll work this out. - Well then what’s this? - You and I are going away for the weekend. - Are you kidding? - I already cleared it with your mom. I’ve got your golf clubs in the back of the car, we’ve got a 9 am tee-time. Dad, you can’t just spring things on me like this, alright? I had plans this weekend. I know you do, with me. Oh, say it isn’t so. Fergy and Skills take it 15-13. This guy's got his own personal cheering squad now? How you know she's not cheering for me? Trust me dawg, she's not cheering for you man. Hey babe. Hey Luke. So that means we’re gonna get to see a little bit more of you, I mean you know since you got some time on your hands, right? Not if I have anything to say about it, boys. See that is whack, dawg. We win the game and he get the girl. Lucas? Oh hey... I’m not playing hookie from your moms café, I just ran out of coffee filters. Okay. See you later. I’m glad we bumped into each other. Haley and I were talking and we thought it might be fun to start up some live entertainment at the café. Great. Are you sure? Because if you think it’s a decision your mom should be making I understand. No it’s… it’s a great idea. It’s good. Good. - Good. - Yeah. - Lucas, are you alright? - Yeah. Hey. Don’t you think it makes more sense to buy in bulk? Plus… for desert. Oh, Hi Mrs. Scott. Hi. Um… excuse me. Of all the things to stick in my mouth it had to be my foot. Lucas, come on, hold up. Did you see the look on her face? Yeah, total Judge Judy. Which is completely ridiculous considering who her son is. She’s friends with my mom. Right… forgot about that one. Well, your mom’s in Europe for the next month so what are the odds she remembers this? Whipped cream and condoms… Are you and mom getting a divorce? Why? What’d she tell you? She kicked you out of the house, right? That’s usually the first step. Don’t worry, things will be back to normal in no time. No,  dad. Mom doesn’t want things to be back to normal, she wants them to be better. Listen to me Nathan, you have a great life. A beautiful home and a basketball pedigree any kid would die for. Yeah, I know. I almost did. Hey, what are you doing? Oh just marveling at my lack of artistic ability. How’s the amazing race? Well, it’s about as well as can be expected. Well, I wish you were here. We’re doing this open mic thing at the café tomorrow. So I’m gone for 2 hours and you go all Hollywood on me. Yeah that’s me, Glamour girl. Hey, you want to say hi to your mom? No, it’s bad timing. Look, let me give you a call back alright? Bye. How’s he doing? Well there was no gun play or screaming so I’m assuming pretty well. He said to say “hi”. - Haley, these um, these flyers… - Suck! Yeah, uh huh! I know! I know! I’m trying everything! Hang on! Hi Keith, bye Keith. Nice talking to you too. Hey, Oh I’m glad you’re here. Yeah I heard you could use the business. Uh, yeah, that too. So let me guess, Dan did something. Of course, but actually this is about Lucas. I saw him at the grocery store today. He was with a girl. Oh yeah, that’s Brooke, he’s been spending a lot of time with her. I can’t say I blame him. Uh, they were, buying condoms. Right. I guess you could take comfort in the fact that he’s being safe, but you know mistakes happen. I’m a walking poster child for it. Oh boy. Karen’s calling tonight, what am I going to tell her? You know besides the fact that I want what’s best for Lucas, I just... I don’t wanna let her down. Well then don’t. She’s 3000 miles away, she trust’s you to handle this. I could always lock him in the cellar. I was going to suggest talking to him. Or that! Oh, hey. Hey. I need your help. Don’t worry, it doesn’t involve orphans or Nathan or any major commitment of any kind. What does it involve? Your artistic ability. Cute. I know. Can you fix it? Yeah! I can burn them! Can you come up with a design that doesn’t suck? - When do you need them by? - Tomorrow afternoon. Okay. Oh, thank you! You’re the best. I take back everything I said about you before we met. Welcome back, Mr. Scott. - Thank you. - Your room is all ready. And your wife? Uh, actually there’s been a change of plans. This is gonna be a guys weekend! This is my son Nathan. Oh well the suite that you requested has a King size. Shall I check for a double room? I’d hate to give up the view. I’ll tell you what. Why don’t you bring up a cot. Very good. Dad, are you kidding me? This was supposed to be a weekend for you and mom? Well, it didn’t work out that way did it? So this whole father son thing, this is just plan B. What difference does it make how or why we got here. The point is we’re here. And we’re gonna have a good time. It’s Haley. She’s got you on a short leash. Yeah. Hey, it's Haley. Yeah, I know. Look, its not a good time right now, alright? - Oh sorry, I just… - I’ll call you back. Nice work. Shall I send up your bags? I have some golf clubs in the back of the car too, I’m taking my son to school on the links tomorrow. They’ll be waiting on you on the tee in the morning. Perfect. Hi, Uncle Keith. Brooke. Could you maybe pick this up some other time? I’d like to have a word with Luke. Okay. - Keith. - Say goodnight, Luke I’ll… call you later. What the hell do you think you’re doing? That’s funny, I was just about to ask you the same thing. I get it. This is about Deb, right? No. This is, um, about you. And some incredibly bad judgment. And I think you should remember that Deb’s the one keeping your mothers business alive while she’s gone. Yes, but it doesn’t give her the right to butt in, alright? I mean, look at Nathan. The guy gets away with 10 times the crap I do. Well, you’re not Nathan. And you know, that’s not the point. I mean, what is this? You couldn’t even be home for your mothers phone call tonight? I forgot. What’d you tell her? I told her that you missed her. And that you loved her. And that you were at the library studying. You  know, the Luke Scott that I know, is better than this. Well look, the Keith Scott that I know isn’t my mother, alright? He’s not even her boyfriend. So this really isn’t your business. Well, that’s where you’re wrong. Cause while I’m here, it is my business. You know, you might wanna take a long hard look in the mirror. And see if the guy staring back at you is the kind of person you want to be. Well, what do you know, you actually hit the fare way this time. Watch and learn. Oh, so pretty! My ball cleared yours on the fly. Maybe you wanna hit from the ladies tee next time. Wanna drive? I just did! Vex, Cat Power, Cheap Trick. You’re all over the place! I kind of got a lot of moods. - Alright, finished. - Oh, this is great! Thank you! No problem. Hello! Best friend! Pick up the phone. Don’t pretend you’re not there, cause I can see you on your cry for help web cam. Web Cam? Hi to you too tutor girl! Hold no just one second. Hello? Look, I’m busy, I promised I would do something. Okay. Yeah I’ll call you tonight. Bye. Do you need help with those? Oh no, you don’t have to do that. No, yeah I do. I mean, if you want help. Yes, I would love help. Yeah, come on. Hey. Hey. I was just on my way down to the river court man, thought maybe you’d want to shoot around. Yeah, it kind of feels weird not having Saturday practice, right? Never thought I’d miss it. Yeah, I appreciate it, but I kind of have to stay around the house today. What, are you grounded? No, no not exactly. You sick? Alright cool, you know what? You don’t wanna hang out with me, man, its cool. Alright? I’ll see you later, man. Luke. Come on in. So, this is Jenny. Is she... Yeah. Yeah, she’s all mine. Wow, that is unbelievable. How old is she? She’s 6 months. 9 days and a couple of hours. Who’s the mother? Uh, that’s... that's a long story but lets just say shes out of the picture. So you’re raising her all by yourself? No, my parents they work nights. And they help out a lot, between the three of us we’re handling it. That explains a lot about you, man. But um, why keep her a secret? Oh come on, you know how people are. Yeah, but if you treat this like its something to be ashamed of, your daughter will carry that around with her for the rest of her life. Well no, I’m not ashamed of her. I’m just trying to protect her. You know, my mom did the same thing. When I found out, the truth about who I was, there was a part of me that thought that maybe, she kept it a secret because she was ashamed of me. Trust me man, you don’t want to hide this. Are you gonna come? I don’t know. - I want it, it's just kind of… - Brooke and Lucas. He told me about the other night. It’s my own fault. I blew it. Sorry. The worst part is though, Brooke is my best friend, you know and she doesn’t have any idea how much this is killing me. I don’t know what kind of karmic monster I was in my past life! Probably one of those sirens that lure in sailors and then kill them on the rocks. Look, between you and me, I really don’t see Lucas and Brooke as like an epic romance, okay? But I mean, he did ask me to give them a chance, so I kind of owe him that, you know? Well, what do you think I should do? The same thing. Never up never in Nathan. You really fell apart on the back nine. I think you told me that a few times already, Dad. Well, it was a nice try. Well, you sink this one you might actually break 100. Alright focus. Square your shoulders. Loose grip. Line it up. Good. Wow, what the hell are you doing?! Never up never in, right dad? - Hey! Watch it! - You know, this whole thing is just another chance for you to pick me apart and show me how much better you are. Well there you go Dad, you just kicked my ass, congratulations. It was great, really. Don’t make a scene. You know what? I almost killed myself for you. You know that? What are you talking about? Drugs dad! I took drugs for you. No! My son would never take drugs. “Your son”. It’s all about you, isn’t it, dad? You know why mom kicked you out? Cause you’re a bully. And you don’t give a damn about anything other than your own ego. Would you keep your voice down? No! You know what you should do? You should give mom a divorce. You should do her a favor and give mom a divorce. She’s never going to be happy with you, dad. Nobody is! You always were a sorry paper boy. Whenever you did manage to drag your butt out of bed, I’d get the paper either through a broken window or on a working sprinkler head. Well maybe if you tipped in Holidays, it would be a different story. Pure extortion. Well, are you here to warn me about the town lynching? No firm date has been set yet, far as I know. Taking a little hiatus, huh? Extreme times call for extreme measures. Oh yeah, that’s kind of why I’m here. I need some advice. More trouble with Nathan? Nah, its Lucas. I’m worried he’s taken some wrong turns and I think I might be part of the problem. How’s that? Well, I’m not exactly a shinning example of good choices. Well, you could take a page out of my book and step back. That’s your advice? Just… do nothing? Or you could emulate your brother and smother the kid with your own short comings. Now I’ve coached 35 teams. Some of them I’ve coddled, some of them I’ve yelled at. But each player has to find his own game. Don’t worry about Lucas. He’s a good kid. He’ll find his way back to the main road. - Hey. - Hi. You’re Gavin DeGraw. Oh yeah, that’s me. Are you playing in town? Yeah, we’re doing a gig at Carolina, and an interview. Oh, wow... Okay, not to be presumptuous or anything but you wouldn’t be interested in playing a smaller space, like a much much smaller space. There’s a thing across the street tonight. Open mic night. I know that’s way beneath you but I would score so many major cool points if you would just come and play a couple of songs. I’ll stop now! - Well, what’s the name of this place? - Um, Karen’s Café? - It’s low key though right? - No, totally low key. Um, maybe I’ll see you there. - Yeah maybe. - Okay... Bye Bye. Hey. Hey. I kind of said some brutal things last night I wish I could take back. Well, obviously I suck at this. I... I want to be your friend, but I also want to do the right thing by your mom. And I know how important that is to you. I’m not really making it easy, am I? Well, at a certain point its up to you. It’s your life. And I think the best thing I can do is back off and let you live it. And if you need help, I’ll always be there. Thanks. Hey. I guess all those flyers weren’t a complete waste of trees. Thank you so much for your help. Oh, just grab an apron. Kidding! Sit wherever you want, order whatever you want on the house, I’m glad you came. So this is the place. This is it. Very buzz worthy. Cool clientele too. Listen, Deb, um… I just wanted to say you’re doing a great job. My mom will be happy. That means a lot to me, thanks Lucas. And, about the other night... Yeah, yeah I know you think I overstepped my bounds. No, its just that if you have a problem with me, could you just talk to me about it first? - You got it. - Alright. Hey, mind if I join you? Actually, I was just leaving, I’ll see you two. I’ll be right back. Peyton! What’s going on? Are you mad at me? Its not you, Brooke, its me. I thought I was cool with this but I’m not, I’m sorry. With me and Lucas?! You do not have to feel like a third wheel. You’re my best friend. Okay? He gets that. It’s not that, Brooke. Then what is it? I just… You’re right, it’s the whole third wheel thing, I guess I just missed you. Then will you please come inside and hang out? I miss you too, okay? Come on. Hey, so I just want to remind everybody that the stage is open, if anybody has any hidden talent they want to reveal. I’ll give it a shot. Great, come on up. Thank God. Jake Jagielski, ladies and gentlemen. Um, so normally, I only sing for my daughter. But something that a friend said convinced me that I should open up to a wider audience and this seemed like the right time and place. So everyone, this is my daughter, Jenny. And Jenny, this is my whole world. Jake has a baby? You okay? - Yeah. - Such a Lonely boy Couldn’t find the joy within Such a lonely girl Such a lonely world we’re living in I watch it all go by I can’t find a tear to cry Jerk never called you back, did he? Believe me, you didn’t want to talk to him anyways. What are you doing here? - Look I’m sorry… - No… I’m glad you’re back. Yeah me too! It’s like, every time I’m with him, I just get caught in this rip tide, you know, the harder I try to get out, the harder it is for me to keep from downing. Maybe you just need to steer clear of the water for a little while. Hey, Nate. I thought you weren’t getting back till tomorrow, what happened? We were keeping score mom. What do you think happened? Oh honey I’m sorry, I should have known. Whatever, I’m used to it. Such a lonely boy Such a lonely girl It’s such a lonely world So what are you, like, married too?! Nah, its just me and Jenny. - She’s got your eyebrows - Oh, that’s not a good thing! She’s beautiful. Thanks, Peyton. Thanks for coming I thought this was going to be low key. Sorry! Is it still cool? Yeah, its alright. Listen man, some of the guys and I are gonna go down to the River Court, I wanted to know if you and the team wanted to come. Why? Cause it’s fun. Don’t you remember? Alright Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Gavin DeGraw! I don't need to be anything other than a prison guard's son I don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son I don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me Good evening everyone to a historic game of basketball. I’m Mouth McFadden and tonight this is the only game that matters. Hey. Hey, tutor girl! I guess this answers the gay question. Give me this. Get in. Cheese! I thought you might want to see this, coach. Come a long way since the last time we sat here. Uh huh. Makes you wonder where they’re all headed. Busy night? What happened today, Dan? Oh you know, we were going to spend the weekend but we missed you too much. I ask you to make good with your son and you make it worse. He flipped out on the 18th hole. It was embarrassing. And did you badger him into it? You have a problem, Dan. You’re competitive and controlling and you need some help. Since when did you become mother of the year? Last I knew you were out of sight half the month and out of mind the rest. You’re right. I have a lot of catching up to do with Nathan. But at least I’m trying to help. You on the other hand… What about me? I want you to see someone. A therapist. We’ll go as a family. Forget it. It's not a negotiation, Dan. You get some help or you’re not going to see Nathan. You really think you’re going to stop me from seeing my own son? Try me. Synchro : Amariss
