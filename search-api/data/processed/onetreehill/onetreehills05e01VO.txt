Are you happy,brooke? Sometimes. Not always. Are you? No. Okay. Then let me ask you something. What is gonna make you happy,peyton? Is it how you look or the car you drive Or the people you know? Is it money or celebrity or power or accomplishment? Because i have all those things, And - And i don't think it's enough. Well,then,what is? Love,i think. And that love can be for a boy or a girl Or a place or a way of life or even for a family. But where you find it is up to you. So where are you gonna find that love,peyton? I think i need to go home.
