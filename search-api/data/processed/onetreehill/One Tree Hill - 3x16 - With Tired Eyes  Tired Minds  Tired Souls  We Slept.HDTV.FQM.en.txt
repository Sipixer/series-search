so they stick to their cliques to hide it. The stoners are medicated, the honor students are afraid, and the jocks... well, they're jocks, man. They'll peak at 17, and their cheerleader girlfriends will be fat and lonely by 21. Losers! Everyone here is a loser. And the truth is, every day I have to come to this school is one less day I have to come back. Here we go. Hey! I heard what you said on the time capsule. Look, Russ... Nice locker, boozer. Call 911. Code red, code red. This is not a drill. All students to a designated lockdown area. This is a code red. He puts a shot up and scores! The Ravens are down by one. Okay, this is a code red. Please, go to a designated lockdown area or exit the school immediately. Peyton? Peyton! Peyton! What the hell? Hey. Somebody has a gun inside, and they're shooting. Haley! Oh, my god. Everybody back on the bus! I lost Peyton. I don't know where she is. She was right there, and a shot went off, and now she's gone. W-w-wait. Peyton was shot? No, I don't know. She was right behind me. We were by the library. Haley's in the tutor center. All students, on the bus! Code red! Now! Let's move! Come on! Nathan, get your ass on that bus. - I'll get him, coach. - Luke! Brooke, I'll be right back. Nathan! Boys! Boys! Get off me, man. Haley's inside. Nathan! Lucas! Lucas! Get on the bus. Drive, drive! Go, go! Okay, everybody just stay down and stay calm. We're safe here. Got a plan? Yeah. I'm going to the tutor center, and I'm gonna get Haley. What are you doing? The plan sucks. You got a better one? Yeah, we turn around and let the police handle this. Police are gonna wait and game plan. They always do that. And what? You're gonna stop a bullet with a baseball bat? Nathan -- Nathan, someone has a gun in here. Lucas, I know that, okay? I know this is stupid. But what if something happens to Haley, huh? What if we walk away and something happens to Haley? Are you gonna live with that? Most heroes are dead, Nate. It's Haley, Lucas. We need to get out of here. No, we need to stay put. It's procedure -- lockdown. We have to wait until it's safe. And I'm saying lockdown is crap. If whoever's out there's a student, they know where we're at. What about the windows? We could break the windows and get out. No, it just goes to a courtyard. It's enclosed. It's just for light. Yeah, besides, we get to breaking all the windows, all we do is draw attention to ourselves. You don't think a locked door is gonna tell whatever psycho is out there that we're in here? Why would you call him psycho? Something to do with them trying to kill us all, fat ass. Look, there's blood. Nate, it could be Peyton. You don't know that. Well, it's someone. The  library doors don't lock. It's not safe. Lucas, I have to find Haley. I know. Okay. Nathan... Yeah. You too, man. Peyton. Hey, it's okay. Ow, my leg! I got cut by some glass. Lucas, I lost Brooke. I'm sorry. She's fine. She's fine. But, okay, you're not. Um, we got to get you somewhere safe. Come on. No, I can't. I can't walk. I tried. Okay. Okay. No, don't leave me, please. No, look, hey, I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right? We'll -- we'll just hide, all right, wait this out, okay? Listen to me, okay? I'm not leaving you, Peyton. I won't. I won't, okay? Dude, what's happening? Mouth, what are you doing here? - I was in the -- - Shh! I was in the A/V room, and I come out, and it's like "dawn of the dead." Mouth, don't say  "dead." Someone's got a gun in the school. What? We got to get out of here. Yeah, you got to get out of here. I got to go get Haley. I'll stay with you. Let's go. No signal. All  circuits busy. It's Nathan. No way. We don't know it's him. No, it's his driver's license. How do you know somebody didn't kill him and take his I.D.? Okay, you're the one that said this is a lockdown, every man for himself. She can't leave him out there. Don't open it. - Do not open that door. - Shut up! Shut up! Always... And forever. It's him. No way. Get away from the door. Look, if she say it's him, it's him. Open the door. God, come here. Are you okay? Yeah. What's going on out there? I don't know, but we're getting out of here, okay? All of us. Let's go. Don't. Nobody's going anywhere. Get away from the door. Jimmy? Do it, Mouth! All right, all right. Just chill out. Everyone, get away from the door. Oh, Jimmy, what'd you do? Move back, Skills. Or what, you gonna shoot me? We used to be friends, dog. Yeah, used to be. So it's like that? All right. Jim, you can't do this. It's a little late for that, Mouth. I can't be here. Look, man, just let us go. I'm sorry I called you "fat ass." It's a little late for that, too. How about you, hero? Are you scared? Yeah, I'm scared. Good. Welcome to my world. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do. You're gonna tape a line down the center of the room. Go on! Why are you doing this? You're Abby Brown, right? What's my name? Jim? My full name. Come on! Who am I?! I don't know. He's  the guy from the time capsule. Jimmy Edwards. You're Jimmy Edwards, and you're a good guy, and you are better than this. Just shut up! All of you, just shut up and sit down! Jimmy, seven hostages in the tutor center? That's not you. What are you doing? What's in your pocket? - Nothing. - What's in your pocket? Stop pointing the gun at her, all right? It's just my phone, okay? Give it to me! Throw it here. Oh, Haley, I used to like you. Hi, 911? Here's the thing. If anyone comes even remotely close to this school, we start shooting students. You hear me? You come in here, your kids die. All right, I want everyone's cellphones! Let's go! And you, missy pepper spray, roll it over here. The baseball bat, too. Come on! Where's your phone, Scott? I don't have it with me. You can check me if you want. Just tape the line. You're kidding me, right? How the hell can a kid just waltz into a high school with a handgun? Where the hell is the security, the metal detectors? Security guards carry nightsticks, Dan. Handguns scare people. They need probable cause to shake a kid down because god forbid we violate their rights. And as far as metal detectors go, the school board -- which I believe you're on -- voted against them. Voted against them? Why? Because they make the school look unsafe. 911's got a possible identification on one of the shooters. Jimmy Edwards? Look, I just want to go home, okay? Not without a parent. But my parents don't live here. Then I guess you'll be here for a while. Come on, Lucas. Jimmy Edwards ? Mary Edwards? Yes. Would you come with me, please? Is my son okay? Please just come with me, ma'am. God! You're bleeding pretty good. We're gonna have to put some pressure on it. Luke, it was your friend, the one from the time capsule. He had the gun. But he didn't look evil or angry. He just looked scared. All right, nobody crosses that line. If  anybody does... just don't. Or what, Jim? Would you really do that? Would you shoot us? Don't talk to me, Haley. 'Cause I don't think that you would. Right. When's the last time we hung out? You're as bad as my best friend Mouth, who totally blew me off! You didn't want to do anything. Tell yourself that, but you changed and you know it. You became just like the rest of them. Don't do that. Don't make him feel guilty for living his life. This is not his fault. This is your fault. No, it's your fault. You think this is what I wanted? You think I got up today and wanted this? I just wanted it to stop. This is kind of screwed up, huh, Skills? It's more than "kind of," dog. For real. We could charge you, you know? If we all charged you at once, no way you shoot us all. Yeah, you're probably right, but... who's gonna be first? Besides, even if you get past me, the others will get you. Are there others, Jim? No, no, no. I was out there. It's just you. You  think so? Do you really think I'm the only one? Then ask yourself this -- you ever treat someone like crap in this school or left anyone out? You ever broken up with someone in the time it takes to pass a note and disappear? Or talk trash behind their back? Maybe you just ignored it all, you know, while you worry about the big game or the prom or or the bake sale for the pep club. You ask yourselves that, and then you tell me, is anyone else out there. Whose phone is that? It's mine. It's the ringtone for my mom. God, I hate that song. Yeah, open your eyes. Your son's a dick! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Do you think I'm playing around? Whoa, whoa, just chill out. Jimmy, please. You're not gonna do it. Shut up. Don't push me. Skills, help me out here. Yo, Marcus, man. Better back him up! - Listen to him! - He's not gonna do it! - Marcus! - What?! That help you out? Behind the line! Move, Skills! Get behind the line! Look, Reeves, with all due respect, you know where this Edwards kid is at. You need to get control of the situation and get somebody into that school. We know where one kid's at. Now, can you guarantee me that's the only kid who walked into that school with a gun this morning? Look, mayor, this is a static situation. If and when it becomes active, we will intervene. But until then, there's a mandated procedure. We secure the area, we wait for the crisis negotiator, and we pray to god that Tree Hill High doesn't become just another catchphrase that people only whisper about for the rest of time. Is it true? Is it Jimmy Edwards? One of them. I know him. He's not a bad kid. He is now. Hey. I don't even know what Lucas is wearing. The policeman asked, and I couldn't even tell him what Lucas was wearing. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. You're not gonna have to. You're not gonna have to. The truth is, every day I have to come to this school is one less day I have to come back. That's excellent. I want to air this with a live feed. I'll get student reactions, their emotions. There's gold here. Little insensitive, don't you think? And you might be? Brooke Davis, Student Council President. I'm here with Student Council President Brooke Davis. Brooke, can you put into words how you might be feeling about this tragedy? You should be ashamed of yourself. Might wanna duck. No, it's just the reporters. We're all part of the circus now. Can I ask you a question? What do you want to happen? What do I want to happen? Uh, yeah, I want to crap a million dollars and a plane ticket to Bolivia. Maybe you could just give up. Oh, yeah, that's it. I'll just call a do-over. Why not? You didn't hurt anybody... did you? Did you shoot anyone, Jimmy? I don't know. You don't have a record, Jim. You're a good student, and you're a minor. Yeah. Maybe this isn't as bad as you think. You're kidding, right? The guy shot up a school. Would  you shut up, man? You shut up. I'm not lying for him. He pointed a gun at my head and threatened to kill me. I hope they fry his ass. What's wrong with you? He's just a kid. We're all just kids, and we just have this life. And the things you say and do, we feel that. How can you have so much hate in your heart? How can you act like it doesn't matter? It does matter. What happened to us, huh? We're just kids. We can't be like this. It's not possible. It's 700 days -- high school -- out of 20,000 or 30,000. Can't you see past that? It's only 700 days. Yeah, and how many of these days do I get back? Do I get back the days I got spit on? Or the day I learned to look at the floor when I walked the halls? Or how about the day my dad came to pick me up and saw me getting my ass kicked on the quad and realized his son was a loser? You ever see the look in your father's eyes when he realizes that? Do I get that day back? 'Cause I saw that same look the day he left me and my mom. That sucks, man. I'm sorry. That's great. You're sorry. You can forget it! This ain't "breakfast club." We're not all gonna fire up a joint and be pals. I mean, let's face it. This is the most any of us have talked in four years. And we all know if I don't have this gun, it never happens! People suck, okay? It's just high school, man. Yeah, there's always college, right? M.I.T. Remember, Jim? They rejected me. And you know why? Not enough activities. I guess Tree Hill Fight Club doesn't count. One school is not the end of the world. It is for me. It's the end of my world. So what? All this because you didn't into college? All this because you're not popular? No. All this because I'm tired of it. I'm tired, Luke. Are you tired? Yeah, but you got to stay awake, all right? Talk to me. Tell me about a good day. We had a snow day -- sixth grade. Do you remember? It was like this whole other world just came in overnight and took ours away. And Brooke -- she came over. We made a snow fort with a tunnel. And we stayed inside there all day. And it seemed so safe, like everything was okay. Like everything our world was about to become, maybe we could just stop it and stay little kids for one more day. But then it got cold... kind of like now. They're gonna come now. Who? All of them. The reporters and the psychologists and the analysts and the so-called experts. They're gonna try to make sense of this, but they're not gonna be able to. And even if we do make it out of here, we're always gonna carry it with us. It's never gonna be the same. It's not glass, is it? In my leg? No. It's a bullet. Now, I may have to get you out of here, okay? But nothing will happen to you. I promise. You're always saving me. Somebody's got to. If I say I love you right now, will you hold it against me? 'Cause I've lost a lot of blood. Come here. Just in case you can't keep your promise. That warm your heart? Do you think America would tune in for that every night? Have you seen the ratings for "7th Heaven"? We're a country obsessed with tragedy, Brooke. So if examining tragedy makes me part of the problem, then so be it. But let me ask you something. How much time have you spent with Jimmy Edwards over the last four years? So maybe I'm not the only one who should be ashamed. Brooke? Hi, I'm Glenda's mom. I was wondering if you had seen her. Um... I'm sorry. I don't know anyone n-- Glenda Farrell. She's in your class. She said you were friends. Glenda. I thought you said Brenda. I'm sorry. Sure, I'll find her. I need to get out of here. Yeah, me too. Can we get a hall pass? Has it only been an hour? It seems like it's been longer than that. I have current events this period. I think this counts. Edwards, where are you supposed to be right now? I'm supposed to be in A.P. english, but I stopped going. Why? Well, because I missed a couple weeks about three months ago, and I couldn't catch up. See, one day I spent a whole day in this school without a single person looking at me or talking to me, and I realized that was the best day I'd had in a long time -- the day that nobody noticed me at all. The day I stopped being there -- that was the best day. Well, that was kind of depressing, so I went home and took an antidepressant. And then I took another one, and then for fun I took 12 more. My mom and the doctors called it an accident. And then two weeks later when I got back to school... nobody noticed. It was like I never left. I guess that's the upside of not being there in the first place, right? Nobody misses you when you're gone. It's not supposed to be this way. The artists and the scientists and the poets -- none of them fit in at 17. You're supposed to get past it. Adults, they see kids killing kids, and they know it's a tragedy because they used to be those kids -- the bullies and the beaten and the loners. You're supposed to get past it. You're supposed to live long enough to take it back. Just take it all back. Excuse me. Are you Glenda? Yeah. Okay. Your mom is here. Oh, I know. I just -- I thought I'd sit here a little while longer. Why? Sometimes I think she takes me for granted... like it wouldn't matter if I wasn't here. I guess I just wanted her to be afraid of losing me, you know, feel it a little. I don't know. That's pretty horrible, isn't it? Not really. Well, I guess I better go. Hey, Glenda? I'm really sorry I don't know you. That's okay. I know you. Hey, I'm really sorry to call. That was Brooke. They won't release her without an adult, but I -- It's okay. I'll wait here. Hey, it's gonna be okay. I'm not gonna let anything happen to our boy. Come here. You shouldn't have come back for me. I love you for doing it, but I wish you were safe. I don't want to be safe without you. I heard what you said, Scott, in the time capsule about Haley. Guys like you can get away with it. Guys like me, huh? You can pass judgment about guys like me all you want, but somebody stereotypes you, and there's gunplay? Whatever. Your worst day in this place would be my best day. Okay, okay, maybe so, all right? Maybe it is easier for me and my friends. That doesn't make what you're doing right, does it? This is wrong, man, all of this. I think you know that. Abby, are you okay? I'm fine. No, you're not. You're diabetic? Where's you insulin? - What's wrong with her? - She's diabetic. Where is it? In my locker across the quad. I'm sorry. No, forget it. It's impossible. You could let her go. Yeah, you got us, dog. Jimmy, she's really sick. Let her go, Jim. Yeah, let her go. Unbelievable! All right, just you. Come on. Come on, Abby. Hey, I'm sick, too. Seriously. I feel terrible. Stay behind the line! Come on. Go on before I change my mind! I'm scared. Of what? The others. Are there others, Jim? Does this feel well-planned to you? Go. Hey, what are you doing?! You said you didn't have a phone! Who'd you call?! They better not come in here! I just got a text message from Nathan. Is he in there? Is Lucas with him? He says this kid is the only one. They're in the tutor center. Just Jimmy Edwards, huh? Look, Danny, I know we've had our difference lately, but you got to let me try to talk to him. I know this kid. If they go in there, he's gonna get spooked, and this thing is gonna turn out bad. Please. Just let me try. No way. It's too dangerous. Dan? Please? You can get me in there. Nobody has to know. I should've known it was all about the gun. So, what -- do I have to pull the trigger again for you to take me seriously? No! Edwards, come on, man. I promise you, whoever steps into that hallway is gonna die. I got you. I guess that's my cue. Don't! Just stop. Change it. Don't do this. Please, Jim. Just turn yourself in. I can go with you. This can't be happening. Yo, Edwards, man, it don't have to be like this, dog. Yeah, I think it does. Jimmy. You know, they're gonna remember me as a monster. I wonder how they'll remember all of you. Where do you think you're going?! She's bleeding. The school's on lockdown! I know, Jim. But if I don't get her out of here, she's gonna die. I didn't mean to hurt her. We know that, Jimmy. What the hell is this?! The school's on lockdown! Please, Jimmy, just -- please just let them go, and you and I can talk about this. She's hurt, Jimmy. I didn't mean it. I know. Go on, Luke. - Keith -- - Luke... I love you. Now go. Why don't you just hand me that gun, Jimmy, and we can just follow them out of here? I can't. Well, I'm not gonna leave you here, son. I'm not gonna do that, and I'll tell you why. Because I've been there. I've bought the gun, and I planned on using it, okay? I've been there, and I want to tell you something. It gets better. Not this. It can't. It does, Jimmy. That pain in your stomach, that pain in your heart, it goes away. That voice in your head that's saying there's no way out, it's wrong, Jimmy. Would you please -- please just believe me. It gets better. It won't! Not after this! I can't take this back! I can't erase this! She's gonna die. You don't know that. I just -- I wanted -- I wanted them to leave me alone. I just -- I wanted them to like me. I understand, son. It's what we all want. It's all any of us wants. I'm not here. - I'm not here. - Jimmy, please. It's gonna be okay, son. It's gonna be okay. But it hurts! It hurts. It always hurts! I know. Please. Please. I'm sorry. No! Does this darkness have a name? This cruelty, this hatred, how did it find us? Did it steal into our lives, or did we seek it out and embrace it? What happened to us? That we now send our children into the world like we send young men to war... Hoping for their safe return... But knowing that some will be lost along the way. When did we lose our way? Consumed by the shadows, swallowed whole by the darkness. He's gone, Danny. He's gone. Does this darkness have a name? Is it your name? Transcript: Raceman - Synchro: Amariss
