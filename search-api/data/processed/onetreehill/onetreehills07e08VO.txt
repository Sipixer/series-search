with nathan scott, did you ? No. It's over. Dan : i'd been given only days to live. That was 14 months ago. So how'd you know she was lying ? Takes a con to know a con. Brooke : that night you said you were gonna take that movie in new zealand, i wrote "marry me" in the sand, and then i didn't tell you because you said you were leaving. I didn't know. Hey. I think you should go home to david. Sara : i don't want you to be alone, honey. Why'd you send her away ? I loved you so much, sara. I don't want to lose us. But now it's time to let go. Don't worry, senor. You won't feel a thing. So, tell me, doc. How many heart transplants have you done ? Dos o tres. mas o menos. Whoa, whoa, wait. Doc, i-i'm -- i'm not under yet. I'm still here. Hey, doc, doc, doc, i'm still here. I'm still here, doc. [ speaking spanish ] i'm still here. I'm still here ! I'm still here ! It's okay, baby. It's okay. It was a dream, right ? It was just another dream. He's going. All right, haley, i just wanted to spend this weekend with my son and my friends. I barely even know this guy. He's going. You're going. An entire weekend in the woods -- you realize i know nothing about camping ? What does this guy even know about camping ? He makes movies -- and not very good ones. Julian lives in tree hill now. It's time he hung out with the guys. I'm not a guy's guy. I don't have homies. I don't think anyone has had homies since 1989. I'm just saying my close friends have always been girls. You mean like alex ? Yes, exactly like... i'm going. Yeah. Hi, clay. You know how cute i always thought you were. Oh, i bet you'd like that, wouldn't you, you perv ? I-i'm sorry. "Fast times" was on cable last night. Show a little respect for the dead, you goof. Sara. This isn't healthy, is it ? Oh, i don't know -- probably healthier than all the women you've had in your pool in real life. Then again, skipping the guys'weekend to spend time with your dead wife... probably not so healthy. Man, when i said guys'weekend, i pictured us by the pool at the bellagio, room and drinks comped all'cause we're rolling with nathan scott. Yeah, that's exactly what i wanted -- a weekend in some casino sports book -- 50 tvs, 50 stations, none of which will hire me. Yeah, but the damn woods, with hungry animals and dudes with hockey masks ? Come on, man. Camping's a great way to forget your life. No tv, no internet, no cellphones. Yeah. No way to call for help. No, i guess it'll be all right. Hi, coach skills. Aw, chuck. And above all, just be yourself. Brooke, it's a camping trip, not the first day of school. Well, did you remember to bring a little thermos with the sippy cup ? I got it covered. Geez, eddie bauer ! Did you buy the whole catalog ? First rule of camping -- be prepared. I think. First rule of camping -- travel light. Attention, all campers. Bill murray ? "Meatballs"? Hey, look, everyone. It's julian. Who the hell is julian ? Have a good weekend ! See ya ! see ya ! See ya, fellas. Bye, guys. Have fun. Be safe. You think we'll ever see them again ? Oh, i wouldn't worry. Julian has enough equipment to survive in the woods for seven years. Well, i hope you're ready for girls'night, 'cause quinn made brownies. Brownies ! Mmm. They smell incredible. They should. They're taylor's recipe. Oh, sweet. I love taylor's brownies. When hales was in high school, she used get all stressed about grades and tests, and we would always make special brownies. Special brownies ? Yeah, you know, the usual -- eggs, milk, brownie mix... a little weed. Does she know that ? No. Looks like the boys aren't the only ones going on a trip tonight. Who wants to get their "go get me a beer" badge ? I do ! i do ! Nice. So, this is the same tent the japanese climbers took to the top of mt. Everest. Well, then you should be good here, 100 feet above sea level. If only the instructions weren't also in japanese. Well, i think that looks pretty good. So, would you call that a two-man tent ? You might want to slow down a little. That was the thing about Taylor's brownies. The more i eat, the hungrier i get. Yeah, there's a reason for that. It's girls'night, right -- all about spilling secrets ? Oh, no. What'd you guys do ? Okay, taylor's recipe calls for an eighth of granddaddy purple. What is that, some kind of breakfast cereal ? Not exactly. Pot ?! I have to go throw up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, relax, haley-bob. You're about to, anyway. I do not believe, all those years, you and tay were getting me high. Yeah, who knew tutor girl was actually stoner girl ? We never gave you the full-strength recipe until now. I can't do this. I have a child ! Who is away for the weekend. You have had a rough couple of months. It is perfectly acceptable to mellow out a little. I'm so getting you back for this. Oh, come tomorrow, you'll be thanking me. Well, maybe i've built up an immunity to these brownies. I mean, i've had two already, and i don't feel anything. Now, when they say they represent the lollipop guild, do you think that's a trade union ? And if it is, why did they unionize ? Did they need shorter hours or longer sticks or different flavors ? Look at their little suits. They really crack me up. Wow. That didn't take very long. Brooke, are you okay ? Will you please tell that munchkin to stop looking at me ? Great. She gets chatty, and you get paranoid. A classic overcorrection. Just give me something simple, elegant, beautiful. You just described everything i love about you. I thought you didn't believe in love. Isn't that what you told that girl kylie ? I meant... i could never love anyone as much as i loved you. Except for quinn. It's not like that with quinn. I could always tell when you were lying. The ratings are in. Last week's show with renee was our highest ever. I'm glad. We have momentum. We need something big for sweeps, and then dr. Phil can suck it. Well, maybe we can get lucas to do a guest spot. It's not like he's doing anything. Hey, lena, beat it. He's got enough eyeliner. Okay. What's going on ? Does this have anything to do with the fact that nathan never called to say thank you ? Of course not. I never expected that. Good, because we both know that's not gonna happen. Now get your head in the game. We have an empire to build. Alex isn't that bad once you get to know her. I'm just saying i've known brooke a long time. I saw how hard it was for her to get over a broken heart. Well, nobody's gonna break brooke's heart. Well, good,'cause if you do, you'll answer to me. Yeah, and i seen him naked. He been working out. Hanging with the guys rules. So, how you doing, chuck ? My mom says you can't marry miss lauren 'cause you don't make enough money. Ah, well, guess who just lost their "keep their damn mouth shut" badge. So, over the last few months, with everything that's been going on, maybe you were kind of scared ? Jamie : not really. I knew grandpa dan would save us again. So, can we forgive him now ? Last week i helped a confused young woman free herself from her tangled web of lies and deceit. But tonight is about you. So tonight i ask you to turn your gaze inward and confess the truth inside yourself... to turn your gaze inward... ... and confess. And confess -- confess the tru-- we should've saved that for sweeps. That was awesome ! One bravery badge coming right up. Whoa. It's your turn, j. Luke ! It's so far down. This was my favorite part of camping when i was your age. All right, jimmy-jam. See what you got. I can't do it. [ chuckles ] what are you talking about ? It's -- it's too high. I'm going back down the trail. I better go with julian. Jamie, we've been talking about this for weeks, man. But he might get lost. That's true. I am directionally challenged. Okay. Well, i guess i'll see you guys at the bottom, then. Whew. Thanks, man. No problem. Here. You're a genius, you know that ? I mean, who could miss a single episode when dan scott could keel over and die at any minute ? I saw something out there, rachel, in the audience. A boy -- he was bleeding. Felt like my heart was gonna burst out of my chest. You're crazy. Your heart's fine. Without a new heart, you're gonna die. Maybe i want to die. Lon called from putnam and pratt. He read the first three chapters of the book. He says it's gonna be a bestseller. Think of all the good we'll do, all the people we'll help. All the money we'll make ? That too. How much is this heart costing us ? $5,000. That's very reasonable. It's a fortune to these people. Now get some sleep. Tomorrow you're gonna be a new man. Sara, did you feel any pain... when you died, in that moment ? No. Well, i did. And i do, every day. And it's not fair. Life isn't fair, clay. But you being miserable is never gonna change that. These leftovers are incredible. I am such a good cook. What's going on with you and the hot agent ? Clay ? Who are we talking about ? Nathan's agent, clay. Right. Is something going on with the two of you ? No, but it's better that way. My psychic told me to avoid emotional entanglements. You have a psychic ? She's not really mine. Her name's zelda. Oh, my god. She does house calls. Oh, my god. We are totally calling her. No. No, no. No. Please, no creepy psychic -- i can't handle it right now. See if she can bring us a pizza. We did this in a movie i just produced. We just need one spark. All right, spielberg. Why don't you produce us some marshmallows ? So, the girl say she thinks she heard a noise scratching on the car door, right ? So she freak out. She tell the dude, "take me home now." So of course he get all mad because he know he's not getting no action tonight, right ? So he drive the girl all the way home. And get out the car to try to help her out, you know ? And there on the door handle was a bloody hook. That story isn't scary, not when you have a bravery badge. You want to hear something really scary ? Bring it, julia. Okay. Well, this is a true story about an old witch who used to live in these very woods. Her name was drag-leg laura. And they called her that because she had a wooden leg. And you could always hear laura coming because she would drag it behind her in the mud. Well, the day after laura died, some kids decided that they wanted to dig up her body and steal the wooden leg. So they took it back to their tent. And then, just about midnight, on a night just like tonight, they heard it. Laura was coming back for her leg. Wow. That was fast. It's because she's a psychic, so she probably knew that we were going to call her and started heading over here. This is so creepy. Oh, i'm sure she's not that creepy. Okay, she's creepy. Nice going, hollywood. You scared the piss out of chuck. Good thing his mama packed extra underwear. Drag-leg laura works every time. I wasn't scared. It's just a story. Drag-leg laura, zip-lines -- we're all scared of something. Not my dad. All right, buddy. I think it's time for bed. All right. Good night, guys. Good night. Good night. Dad, i'm sorry i didn't do the zip-line. It's okay, buddy. Maybe tomorrow, if you want, huh ? Sure. All right. Come here. Ah. A million dollars for your thoughts. And i'll throw in back-end points. Just thinking about sweeps. You're right. We need something big. Maybe i come clean, show them all that i've got a new heart, that i'm not really living on borrowed time. You do that, and all this goes away. Maybe not. Maybe they've really been listening to what i've been saying, and maybe they'll forgive me. No. They'll tolerate a criminal. They'll look the other way at murder. But if they find out that behind the curtain oz is just a man, they'll never forgive you. Eventually that clock has to stop ticking, rachel. Does it ? You've given these people something to believe in. Don't take it away to quiet your own guilt. Thanks. I never said thank you, mouth. You don't have to. Yeah, but you spoke up for me when nobody else would. I'm really sorry you lost your job, man. There any chance they take you back ? Probably not. I committed the cardinal sin of broadcasting. I told people to turn the channel. Networks don't really like that. Yeah, well, the whole landscape of television is changing anyway. Yeah, but what's next ? The internet -- it's faster, it's cheaper, and it's everywhere. Is your career path pretty much just laid out for you as soon as your parents name you zelda ? Zelda. It's kind of like if they call you bambi or oprah. What are your questions for the universe, my child ? I'm sorry. Okay. Will nathan play for the bobcats this season ? Prospects are hazy. Ask again. You sound like one of those magic 8-balls. You sound like you've been eating pot brownies. Okay, best sports movie ever. Easy. "Field of dreams." I'm gonna go with "coach carter." Ooh, strong. "Cool runnings." Seriously ? Yeah. What, all the sports movies of all time, and you're gonna -- you're gonna pick "cool runnings"? Yeah. I like it. "Hoosiers" -- hands down, best sports movie ever made. You're right -- definitely "hoosiers." I know the guy who coordinated the basketball for that movie. What's that ? Well, you know, the actors don't just make that stuff up. There's a sports coordinator on set who comes up with all the plays. I'm sensing something. It's julian, isn't it ? It's julian. And he's -- conflicted about something, right ? Exactly. It's -- alex duprÃ©? Yes. It's alex duprÃ©. I knew it. Zelda, you're good. You're creepy as hell, but you are good. Let's talk about what alex duprÃ© look like naked. Oh, let me guess -- chase adams. I thought bartenders were supposed to keep their mouths shut. Yeah, and they're also supposed to make good drinks, too. All : enjoy the buzz. So, that's what you meant by not that bad once you get to know her. It was a misunderstanding -- a very brief, somewhat naked misunderstanding. Yeah, there ain't nothing wrong with a little window-shopping, either, right ? Yeah, well, she's no brooke davis. But you guys have all seen her naked on film. Wait. Who we talking about ? Alex -- she's the only actress in hollywood who insists on doing nudity. Yeah, alex -- that's -- that's what i thought. Wait, who are you talking about ? Skills. Skills. Skills. Nathan and brooke kind of made a sex tape in high school. Okay. Good night. See you guys in the morning. Or maybe just one of you. I never told nathan we were married. Why not ? There was never a good time. To mention you had a wife ? I know. It's just... people mean well, but they don't really know what to say. They try, but just... ... after a while, it was just easier not to. For who -- you or them ? I don't know. Them ? Both, maybe. Well, it might help you to tell someone. And it might really help you to tell the right someone. There's a man in your life. He's suffered a great loss. He's struggling. My husband, david. No, it's not david. But whoever it is, i'm getting the strong feeling that he needs you right now. Ooh, magic 8-ball, is zelda really psychic ? What ? Outlook not so good. I told you. She's a total fake. Magic 8-ball, is zelda standing right behind us ? You may rely on it. You're not alone in this house. What ? Wait ! Zelda, you can't do that. Oryctolagus cuniculus. She just cursed us. Quinn, your creepy psychic just cursed us. Okay. On that note, i got to go. No, quinn, you can't -- the brownies. Yeah, i didn't actually have any brownies. Someone had to keep an eye on you two rookies. And you're gonna come down any minute, i promise. I knew that woman would bring a demon into your house. Hey, that's kind of harsh. She's still my sister. Not quinn. Zelda. She said we're not alone. Oh, stop it. I'm sure we're perfectly safe. If there is an evil spirit in this house, this is definitely the best way to keep it from killing us. It's just a mass-produced board game, dude. That doesn't matter, dude. Now, what did zelda say ? Oryctolagus something. Oryctolagus... cunniling-- it wasn't that. You're so bad. You're right. I wouldn't be afraid of that. Okay. Let's do it. Okay. Oh, great ouija board, is there a mean spirit in this house ? You're pushing it. I'm not, i swear. You totally are. I'm not. Okay, fine, don't touch it. Ouija board... is there anyone in this house ? So, let me get this straight. You were on a break from peyton -- nathan : oh, come on. It was eight years ago. I was so drunk, i don't even remember. Well, good thing you got it on tape. Just let it go. It's a nice tent. I have a lambskin sleeping bag. I'm quite warm. Don't change the subject. Look, i get it. The idea of me and brooke is weird for you. I lost my virginity to my sister-in-law. You don't think that makes thanksgiving a little awkward from time to time ? You still awake ? Yeah. What'd you think about what julian said ? I don't know. Maybe he's right. Maybe i could have my own sports show on the internet.</i> Then i could say anything i want. Call the website something like raw mouth. I'm pretty sure that's already taken. My father's new wife is my age, and she hit on me after she slept with my uncle cooper. Yeah. Don't even get me started on my dad. Yeah, your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling. "Breakfast club." You really got to quit with the movie quotes, man. I can quit that. But i wish i knew how to quit you. Okay, so enough about your new porn site. I'm talking about the "hoosiers" thing. See, i was planning on starting my own business training athletes, right ? But sports coordinating -- i think i'd be good at that. You'd be great at that. Julian's cool. That's not cool, man. Lighten up, francis. Everybody loves a good "brokeback mountain" joke. Not when you're over there sleeping in your lambskin condom. Oh, you should talk. You're the one who showers with dudes on a nightly basis. You think drag-leg laura is real ? Nah. I can tell you a real story.</i> It's about this girl named nanny carrie. And it actually happened... to me. You're good with the kid, you know that ? I've had my moments, believe me. Yeah, but your dad was a dick, and yet somehow you turned it around for your own son. They should give a merit badge for that. Zelda said julian's conflicted about something. I -- listen, i realize the irony of the following statement, but you can't take everything zelda says too seriously. I feel it, haley. Brooke, that boy loves you. He would move mountains for you if you asked him to. I don't know. What if the guy i want to spend the rest of my life with doesn't feel the same way ? That's just the brownies talking. No, i think they're wearing off. Julian : i could see spending the rest of my life with brooke, but i know she wants kids. And i don't know if i'm ready for that. I don't know if i'll ever be. Jamie likes you. Jamie likes that i suck at stuff. What do you mean ? I'm just saying when you have superman for a father, sometimes it's nice to hang around with clark kent. Rain ? Really ? I wouldn't worry. I hear lambskin is the safest form of protection. You'll be fine. All right. Come on. You should've gone on the camping trip. I wanted to spend time with you. You're not with me, clay. You're alone. And i don't want you to be. What can i say ? I'm good. Let her in. Hi. Hey. Look, i know this is gonna sound weird, but are you okay ? Yeah. I'm fine. Why ? Well, it's just -- never mind. Can i come in ? No. When are you gonna get it, quinn ? You can't be here. You need to go. I'm sorry. I don't get it. I-i don't even know what i'm doing. I mean, i don't know what we're doing. Are we even doing anything ? I like you, quinn. It -- it's just... her name was sara. And i loved her. She was my wife. But, um... she died. And i've never told anyone... up until now. It was sudden. It was just one minute she was there, and the next she was gone. So that's when i just threw myself into my work. But i learned that it doesn't matter how fast you run. The pain will always run faster. That's when my life just went completely off the rails. And that's why your agency sent you to tree hill. Yeah. And that's also why i told you to go back to david. I know what it's like to lose the one thing that you love more than anything in this world. I'm so sorry, clay. I wish there was something i could do for you. You're doing it, quinn. You're alive, baby. You have a new heart. Rachel. Where'd you get the heart ? What are you talking about ? It was a boy, wasn't it ? He was on life support. I paid his family the money, and they pulled the plug. You paid them ? He might have gotten better. We bought his death. We killed him. I did what i had to do to save your life. I'm not a murderer, dan. That would be you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on ? Drag-leg laura ! Listen ! That's definitely drag-leg laura. What are we gonna do ? Well, the only way to get rid of her is to catch her in the eyes with the beam of your flashlight. Don't worry. My dad will do it. What ? No. No. No way i'm going out there, man. I'm way too scared. All right. I'll go. Hey, guys, it's not drag-leg laura. It's just some stupid old gate. Wow, jamie. That was awesome. Jamie scott -- one bravery badge. Yes. Chuck, you might want to go change your underwear again. All right, buddy. Okay. If this is our last night on earth, i just want you to know that i am really glad we are spending it together. No, this is silly. You are just paranoid. We weren't even hearing things. It was just the brownies. It's coming from the closet. Whew. This is ridiculous. Cuniculus. What ? Oryctolagus... cuniculus ! cuniculus ! That's what zelda said. The evil spirit... in the closet. Here i come. Wait ! Oryctolagus cuniculus -- the latin word for "bunny rabbit." That zelda's a bitch. Kids are finally back asleep. How'd you know about the creaky gate ? Oh, i--i just saw it when i was out getting firewood. Nice performance. Julian. You knew jamie needed that. Oh, it was no big deal. Hey, being a father is 95% instinct. And you have good ones. When the day comes, you'll be ready. Thanks, man. You know, that was my first-ever fist bump. Don't overthink it. Come back to bed, baby. You need rest. You're right. I do. In fact, i've been thinking. Maybe we need a vacation. Now, that's my boy. Where do you want to go -- the bahamas, hawaii ? Tree hill. I want to go home. It's almost morning. I should go. Or, uh, you could stay.
