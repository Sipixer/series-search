BUT IF YOU FIND A LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM WITH A LETTER FROM MY SECOND DEAD MOM TELLING ME ABOUT A BIOLOGICAL HALF BROTHER I'VE NEVER MET, JUST GO AHEAD AND SKIP THAT ONE. THAT SOUNDED LIKE A WHOLE LOT OF WHITE-GIRL DRAMA I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND, BUT...OKAY. SPEAKING OF THAT HALF BROTHER, DID YOU CALL HIM YET? YES. BUT I HUNG UP BEFORE HE ANSWERED. PEYTON. I WAS GONNA CALL HIM BACK, BUT YOU CAME IN HERE, CRYING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL, SO I JUST... I HAVEN'T. LOOK, ELLIE -- SHE WAS PRETTY SHARP, PEYTON, AND THERE'S PROBABLY A REASON SHE LEFT YOU HIS NUMBER, AND THERE IS PROBABLY A REASON THAT YOU CALLED HIM. AND I DID NOT CRY LIKE A LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL. YOU FIND ANYTHING GOOD OVER THERE, SKILLS? OH, I'M ACTUALLY JUST PRETENDING TO BE LOOKING SO I CAN HEAR ALL YOUR BUSINESS.

HEY. CHECK IT OUT. SO, EVER SINCE BROOKE TURNED 9, WE'VE KIND OF HAD THIS RITUAL ON HER BIRTHDAY WHERE WE GO TO HER FAVORITE STORE AT THE MALL, HALF AN HOUR BEFORE CLOSING. SHE PICKS OUT A GIFT, AND I STEAL IT FOR HER. YOU SHOPLIFT BROOKE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT. YEAH, SORT OF. THAT'S -- OKAY, MY DAD'S FRIENDS WITH THE MANAGER, SO I WOULD JUST COME HOME AND TELL WHAT WE TOOK, AND THEN WE'D PAY FOR IT, BUT WE NEVER TOLD BROOKE. SHE WAS ALL CRAZY FOR THE JUICE. SO I JUST FIGURED, MAYBE, IF YOU GO IN MY PLACE THIS YEAR AND YOU'RE NOT A COMPLETE BONEHEAD IN THE ROMANCE DEPARTMENT, THEN MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A SHOT. YOU'VE DONE THIS EVERY YEAR FOR HOW MANY YEARS? THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 10th. BET SHE'S PISSED AT YOU NOW. SO "A," WHY WOULD YOU HELP HER? AND "B," WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE'S EVEN GONNA SHOW UP? I'M NOT HELPING HER. I'M HELPING YOU.

I TRIED TO HELP YOU, COOP, BUT I COULDN'T GET YOU OUT OF THERE. AND THEN I-I RAN OUT OF AIR, AND I PANICKED. THEN EVERYTHING WENT BLACK, JUST LIKE IT DID FOR YOU. I DIDN'T SAVE YOU, COOPER. I COULDN'T EVEN SAVE MYSELF. THAT'S OKAY. NO, IT'S NOT. PEOPLE THINK I'M A HERO, BUT THEY'RE WRONG. YOU'RE THE HERO. [ SIGHS ] I HEARD YOU TOLD REEVES THAT IT WAS YOUR FAULT, AND IT WASN'T. SURE IT WAS. HALEY SAW RACHEL GRAB THE WHEEL. LISTEN, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT BRIDGE, IT WAS STILL MY FAULT. I KNEW HOW OLD RACHEL WAS, AND I DIDN'T WALK AWAY. IT'S NOT VERY HEROIC, IS IT? ANYWAYS, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ALIVE TO SAY ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU. HEY, I TOLD YOU -- EVEN IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT, NATE, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

LOOK, COACH, COME ON. HE WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE. THIS COULD REALLY HELP HIM WITH THAT. NATHAN'S A LITTLE BANGED UP. YOU'RE HARD-SELLING ME, AND I DON'T LIKE IT. JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY? PLEASE. I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DAMN SPARE FOR THAT CAR. HI. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. UH...OKAY, WELL, THINGS ARE A LITTLE CRAZY RIGHT NOW. Rachel caught me making maternity clothes. BROOKE! ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE THAT KNOW ABOUT THIS PREGNANCY, I'M THINKING RACHEL'S NOT REALLY ON THE TOP. I KNOW! OKAY, WELL, CALM DOWN, AND... DOES SHE SUSPECT ANYTHING AT ALL? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. SO IT'S JUST YOU AND ME THAT KNOWS. LET'S JUST KEEP IT THAT WAY. I THINK THAT'S BEST. DON'T YOU? I THINK I'D FEEL BETTER IF I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT, ISN'T IT? DID YOU AND LUCAS EVER TALK ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU... YEAH. LAST YEAR, UM...YOU KNOW? I MEAN, HE SAID HE'D BE THERE FOR ME AND THE BABY, BUT I COULD TELL HE WAS SCARED AND FEELING TRAPPED, AND HE JUST -- HE WASN'T READY. Yeah, I know. DID YOU AND NATHAN EVER TALK ABOUT IT? YEAH, DON'T YOU REMEMBER? IT WAS THAT NIGHT THAT WE SPENT TOGETHER, AND THEN HE FOUND OUT I WASN'T ON THE PILL, AND HE FREAKED OUT. IT WAS THE WORST FIGHT WE EVER HAD. BROOKE, I GOT TO GET BACK OUT THERE. I'M SORRY. IT'S CRAZY, AND DEB'S OUT TO LUNCH. THIS IS AN AWFULLY LATE LUNCH. [ LAUGHS ] SHE'S HERE. SHE'S <i>LITERALLY</i> OUT TO LUNCH. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

COOPER... NATHAN. COOPER'S GONE. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU MEAN RELEASED. GONE FROM TREE HILL, RACHEL. I'M REALLY SORRY, NATHAN, FOR THE WAY I ACTED AT THE RECEPTION AND... WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. I KNOW THAT YOU SAVED MY LIFE... AND I'M GONNA FIND A WAY TO THANK YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. NO. I WANT TO. YOU HAVE COOPER'S EYES. HI, GUYS. PEYTON HERE. UH, IF YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO MY PODCASTS, THEN YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ME, BUT DID YOU KNOW I HAD A BROTHER? YEAH, WELL, NEITHER DID I. UM...HIS NAME'S DEREK. SAME FATHER, DIFFERENT MOM. IT'S KIND OF THE TREE HILL WAY OF LIFE, I GUESS. ANYWAY, I TRIED CALLING HIM TODAY, BUT HE HUNG UP ON ME, WHICH IS COOL. YOU KNOW, I-I FULLY UNDERSTAND INABILITY TO LET PEOPLE IN BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I WAS WITH ELLIE AT FIRST. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DOES LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT DEREK AND I PROBABLY HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON. SO ANYWAY, UM...DEREK, FROM ST. FLORA, NORTH CAROLINA, MAYBE YOU'LL RECONSIDER. YOU KNOW? MAYBE YOU'LL, UM, YOU'LL LISTEN TO MY PODCASTS, OR YOU CAN GO TO MY MySpace PAGE, YOU KNOW? IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME THERE, EXCEPT MAYBE THIS. I WOULD <i>REALLY</i> LIKE TO TALK TO YOU SOMETIME... ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT. AND I HOPE YOUR WORLD IS GOOD TO YOU. * AND NEVER MIND THAT BARKING SPIKE * SPRING CLEANING?

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU, AND THINGS HAVE BEEN SO CRAZY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA HAVE A CHILD. WELL, UM, IT'LL BE EASIER THIS TIME, RIGHT? I MEAN, BEING PREGNANT AT 17 WAS PROBABLY REALLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS YOU HAD TO CONFIDE IN, AND... LISTEN, HALEY, UM... [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] NORMALLY, I-I WOULDN'T GO BEHIND LUCAS' BACK, BUT... HE FOUND A PREGNANCY TEST IN BROOKE'S PURSE AT THE WEDDING, AND HE CLAIMS THAT SHE'S NOT PREGNANT, BUT... YOU WOULD TELL ME IF YOU KNEW OTHERWISE, WOULDN'T YOU? UM...I DON'T. BUT, UM, LISTEN, I CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DEB. WHAT ABOUT DEB? WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE, UM...

HALEY CAME BY AND TOLD ME THAT THE -- HALEY. [ LAUGHS ] I KNEW THAT LITTLE BITCH COULDN'T KEEP HER BIG MOUTH SHUT. I NEED THE GUN FOR PROTECTION, KAREN. GUN? TELL ME YOU DIDN'T SHOOT OUT THE WINDOW WITH CUSTOMERS. YOU COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOUR EX-HUSBAND. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. GIVE ME THE GUN. [ CHUCKLES ] I CAN'T. DEB, I'M NOT PLAYING GAMES WITH YOUR WACKY ASS. GIVE ME THE DAMN GUN! FINE. HUH. OKAY, NOW I GET IT. HOW LONG? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. REALLY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK YOU'RE A RECOVERING ADDICT WHO'S RETURNED TO HER FORMER LIFE OF POPPING PILLS AND BRANDISHING FIREARMS! I JUST HAD A LITTLE SLIP. IT'S NOT A LITTLE SLIP! LITTLE SLIPS HAPPEN. BUT GETTING WASTED AND SHOOTING UP THE CAFé DURING THE NOON RUSH IS NOT A LITTLE SLIP! DEB. YOU NEED TO GET BACK INTO REHAB. OH. OR WHAT? OR I WILL DISSOLVE OUR PARTNERSHIP. KAREN -- I WILL NOT HAVE A GUN-TOTING JUNKIE DESTROY A 17-YEAR-OLD BUSINESS. FINE. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LITTLE CAFé. I QUIT. DEB. IT'S AN ALTOID. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HEY. YOU OKAY? YOU SOUNDED A LITTLE CRYPTIC WHEN YOU CALLED. YEAH. YEAH. LOOK, UH, I GUESS THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO DO THIS, SO I'M JUST GONNA DO IT. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BRIDGE. OKAY, BUT YOU SAW A LOT MORE THAN I DID. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT. LOOK, I SWAM INTO THE CAR, AND I GOT TRAPPED. I PANICKED, ALL RIGHT? I DIDN'T SAVE ANYBODY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SOMEBODY SAVED ME. IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT? OH, NATHAN, I WISH IT WAS, BUT IT WASN'T. IT HAD TO BE. LOOK, I WAS TRAPPED IN THAT CAR, OKAY? I RAN OUT OF AIR, AND MY LUNGS GAVE OUT. NOW, UNLESS WE'RE BOTH DEAD RIGHT NOW -- NATE, NATE. LOOK, PEOPLE BLACK OUT ALL THE TIME IN SITUATIONS OF, LIKE, CRISIS OR TERROR OR HIGH-STRESS SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW, IT'S SOME KIND OF AN ADRENALINE OVERLOAD. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DIDN'T SOMEHOW PULL COOPER AND RACHEL FROM THAT CAR, EVEN IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THERE, NATHAN. IT WAS JUST US. WHAT IF I SAW SOMEONE IN THE CAR? YOU MEAN RACHEL AND COOPER? NO, SOMEONE ELSE. [ CHUCKLES ] WHO? KEITH. ?? YOU GETTING YOUR GAME FACE ON? [ Laughing ] NO. WORKING ON YOUR BROOKE DAVIS MOJO? I WAS THINKING ABOUT NATHAN. HE TOLD ME SAW KEITH IN THE RIVER. HE SAYS HE WAS TRAPPED IN THE LIMO, AND KEITH SAVED HIM. WOW. KEITH, HUH? WHAT'D YOU SAY? KEITH'S DEAD, PEYTON. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW MUCH OUR LIVES HAVE CHANGED SINCE FRESHMAN YEAR. YEAH. IT'S ALL GONNA END SOON, TOO. OR BEGIN. YOU KNOW I USED TO WATCH YOU? WHEN? OH, FRESHMAN YEAR, SOPHOMORE YEAR, BOTH SUMMERS ACTUALLY. STOP IT. WHAT DID YOU WATCH? YOUR LEGS, MOSTLY. WHAT?! NO, I'M SERIOUS. YOU KNOW, FROM UP CLOSE, THEY'RE A LITTLE CHICKEN-Y. SHUT UP! FROM WHERE I WAS HIDING, THEY WERE PRETTY AWESOME. [ CHUCKLES ] I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A COMPLIMENT. OH, IT IS. TRUST ME. I THINK IT SUCKS THAT YOUR BROTHER HUNG UP ON YOU, PEYTON. [ SIGHS ] YEAH. I GET IT, THOUGH -- YOU KNOW, THE FEAR OF LETTING PEOPLE IN, GETTING CLOSE TO SOMEBODY AND THEN IT JUST NOT WORKING OUT. ANYWAY, UM, ALMOST TIME FOR BROOKE. ARE YOU READY? YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO INSTEAD? YOU KNOW, PATCH THINGS UP WITH HER. YOU GUYS HAVE A LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP THAT'S AT STAKE HERE. YEAH. BUT YOU <i>LOVE</i> HER. [ LAUGHS ] I DO. WELL, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T HELP WHO YOU LOVE. SO THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF ME, BUT THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR BROOKE. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH. GO AHEAD. I'LL WAIT. I'll wait. YOU THINK YOUR MOM'S A SPY? OR A PIMP MAYBE? [ CHUCKLES ] WHAT? SHE'S GOT A GUN. YEAH. SHE'S PACKING HEAT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOUR MOM BROUGHT A GUN INTO THE CAFé TODAY. OH, AND IT WENT OFF! WHAT? WAS ANYBODY HURT? NO, THANK GOD. UNBELIEVABLE. I KNOW. I'LL TALK TO HER. NOW? NO. OKAY, BUT SHE'S ACTING REALLY WEIRD, AND SHE'S STRAPPED WITH A NINE. I GET IT, HALES, BUT THE PLAYOFFS ARE NEXT WEEK, AND MY MOM'S AN ADULT. BOTH MY PARENTS ARE, SUPPOSEDLY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING THEN? THE RIVER COURT. NATHAN, YOUR KNEE'S ALL -- YOUR MOM IS TOTALLY FREAKING OUT! I'M THE KID, HALES. I'M SICK OF DEALING WITH MY PARENTS' PROBLEMS. IF IT'S NOT MY DAD WITH A RESTRAINING ORDER, IT'S MY MOM WITH A GLOCK. THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE. MY ONE SAVING GRACE, MY ONE WAY OUT IS THAT IF I PLAY HALFWAY DECENT IN THESE PLAYOFFS, AND GET THE HELL AWAY FROM BOTH OF THOSE LUNATICS. SHOULD MY MOM HAVE A GUN? NO. BUT AM I GONNA LET HER STUPIDITY OR ANYTHING ELSE STAND IN THE WAY OF MY DREAMS? NOT A CHANCE. SEE YOU. BYE. KNOCK, KNOCK. DAN, YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. DOING WHAT? [ SIGHS ] COMING AROUND LIKE THIS. LOOK, I KNOW YOU SAID THAT YOU INTEND ON BEING THERE FOR ME WITH THIS PREGNANCY, BUT THE TRUTH IS, DAN, YOU ARE NOT THAT GUY. YOU WERE NOT THAT GUY THE FIRST TIME WITH LUCAS, AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE THAT GUY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT. THAT'S LUCAS' CRIB. DAN, I -- I DID IT MYSELF. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT. OKAY, I BRING YOU TO THIS CLUB. I FILL YOUR KITSCHY BUT HIDEOUS SPICE GIRL MUG WITH ALCOHOL, AND YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT. IS THIS HOW YOU SPEND ALL YOUR BIRTHDAYS? ACTUALLY, NO. I USUALLY SPEND THEM WITH PEYTON, BUT NOT THIS YEAR. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT? I MISSED A COUPLE THINGS WHEN I WAS HANGING OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER. PEYTON LIKES LUCAS. DID SHE TRY TO SLEEP WITH HIM? 'CAUSE I DID THAT, TOO. SHE KISSED HIM. THE DAY OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTING, SHE KISSED HIM IN THE LIBRARY. WELL, BY DEFAULT, IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE, OR AT LEAST BLEEDING TO DEATH, I THINK YOU GET A FREE KISSING PASS. WHAT ELSE DID SHE DO? WELL, SHE HAD THE NERVE TO SAY SHE'D BACK OFF IF I LOVED HIM. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? SHE WANTED ME TO DECLARE MY LOVE FOR MY OWN BOYFRIEND. WHY DIDN'T YOU? OKAY, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR LUCAS ANYMORE. PEYTON DOES. YET SHE'S WILLING TO HIDE THOSE FEELINGS IF YOU ASK HER TO. SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GREAT FRIEND TO ME. Woman: YEAH! CHECK IT OUT. YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT'S HERE. WELL, AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. YOU PICK. ISN'T IT A LITTLE SOON FOR YOU? IS COOPER'S TUX EVEN DRY YET? COOPER'S GONE, BROOKE. SO I'M USING YOUR BIRTHDAY AS AN EXCUSE TO DROWN MY SORROWS IN ALCOHOL AND BOY. RACHEL, A ONE-NIGHTER IS JUST GONNA MAKE IT WORSE. TOMORROW, IT'LL MAKE IT WORSE, BUT TONIGHT, TRUST ME, IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BETTER. SO WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT? I CAN'T. SUIT YOURSELF. DON'T WAIT UP. * DON'T BE AFRAID TO TELL ME THAT * * OH! * DON'T BE AFRAID TO TELL ME THAT * COME ON, BROOKE. I'M SORRY, LUKE. I REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA SHOW. BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. SHE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE, SO THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR THE TWO OF YOU, JUST NOT SO MUCH FOR ME AND HER. HERE. I STOLE THIS FOR YOU. [ BOTH LAUGH ] AH. [ LAUGHS ] IT SMELLS GOOD. [ GIGGLES ] TRY IT ON. [ LAUGHS ] BEST BIRTHDAY EVER. WHEN I WAS 12. MY MOM AND KEITH SURPRISED ME WITH TICKETS TO THE DUKE-CAROLINA GAME. OH, NO, WE DROVE UP, MADE A WEEKEND OUT OF IT. IT WAS COOL BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE WERE EVER A REAL FAMILY. AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE THAT BACK. YOU? MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY. MY MOM WAS STILL ALIVE. THAT'S THE LAST TIME WE WERE A REAL FAMILY. I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE THAT BACK. YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE YOU BY RACHEL'S? MAYBE BROOKE'S THERE. Lucas: <i>THERE ARE MOMENTS</i> IN OUR LIVES WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES AT A CROSSROADS. NO. THAT'S OKAY. WOULD YOU DROP ME BY THE RIVER COURT? IT'S WHERE I DO MY BEST HEALING. SURE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] THERE ARE MOMENTS IN OUR LIVES WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES AT A CROSSROADS. AFRAID, CONFUSED, WITHOUT A ROAD MAP. THE CHOICES WE MAKE IN THOSE MOMENTS CAN DEFINE THE REST OF OUR DAYS. * GET OUT OF BED * PICK UP THE PHONE * TIME TO TELL THE PRESS OF COURSE, WHEN FACED WITH THE UNKNOWN... * SAY TO MYSELF ...MOST OF US PREFER TO TURN AROUND AND GO BACK. DOING A LITTLE SCOUTING? I'M PUTTING HIM ON THE TEAM. REALLY? WELL, THAT'S GREAT, COACH. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE? YOU DID. NOT LONG AGO, I FOUND A KID OUT ON THAT VERY SAME COURT. IF THAT YOUNG MAN TURNS OUT TO BE THE KIND OF PLAYER AND PERSON THAT SCRAWNY KID TURNED OUT TO BE [LAUGHS] IT'S A NO-BRAINER. * GET OUT OF BED * COME OUT AND SING * BLUE SKIES AHEAD * THE MAN WHO TOLD EVERYTHING YOU JUST BECAME A RAVEN.

I FOUND YOUR BALL AT HOME. I WAS KIND OF HOPING YOU WOULD. I NEED YOU TO TALK TO ME. HALEY. I'M NOT TRYING TO SHUT YOU OUT, OKAY? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH TO LET YOU IN YET. WHATEVER IT IS, WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER. I'M RIGHT HERE. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE TESTED THAT YOU TRULY DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE. * EVERYTHI-I-I-NG AND IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE TESTED THAT YOU DISCOVER WHO YOU CAN BE. HEY. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY.
