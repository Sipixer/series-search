You're asking me to the prom? You made fun of my Mom's death, Brooke. It hurt. It did. Not anymore, 'cause you and me-- we're done. She's dead. As far as I'm concerned, so are you. Peyton... Your boot's off. You can walk on it? Yep. Even better, I'm gonna dance on it. I'm coming back later, and I'm picking you up. If you open that door. I know that you're gonna look beautiful. And if not, I guess I'm going alone. Lucas. Hi, Peyton. I guess I have my answer. I can't believe he actually left. I would never give up on you that easily. You hear me? Our love is forever. So, when you took your boot off, was it all... It was like <i>Teen Wolf</i>. Seriously, I had to use three razor blades. Nice. I'm proud of you, Hales. My girl went strong to be rehabbed by prom. Well, at least everything will be perfect tonight. We got to stop saying that. Since when have the chaperones been prettier than the prom queens? Thanks, but I'm with someone. Hi, Whitey. - You look handsome. - Thank you. Well, I better go see if Principal Turner needs anything. What the hell are you doing? I'm making the rest of you guys look bad. Years ago, I watched you screw up Karen's life. I'm not gonna allow history to repeat itself. And yet you've been trying to make that tux work since the '70s. I'll be watching you, Danny. I think -- I think the fan belt snapped. Maybe it's the -- the thingamajig. Can I please call Lucas now? I have no signal. Oh, great. Well, there's a convenience store about a mile up ahead. I'll just walk there and call for a ride, I guess. - You can stay. - No, thank you. A pregnant girl in a prom dress with a broken-down car is how urban legends get started. - I'm coming with you. - What about your leg? It'll be a good test. Come on. This is the final boarding call for flight 121, service to New Orleans. Good. You're awake. I'm sorry about the... sedative, but there were just so many last-minute details. I missed you, Peyton, so much. Oh, God, I missed that smell. You're probably wondering how I got out of jail. Miss Sawyer? Detective Wilcox here. We're just calling to let you know we have your stalker in custody. You know, I've had a lot of time to think about what went wrong with us last time. A girl like you needs romance. I get that now. So that's why you and I are gonna have our own private prom. Just... The two of us. Transcript : www.1000fr.Com present Resync : Jesslataree Version 1.1 Hey, I'm so sorry to hear about your dress. I had no idea. It's okay. I got most of it off. Now when you black-light me, it just says "ho." So... Where is she, anyway? I went over to her house to pick her up, but she wouldn't even open the door. I guess she's not coming. I need to leave for a little while. Sure. Where we going? All right, take it easy on the turns. My grandpa Mel loosened the suspension. I'll be back in time for my coronation. Aren't they still voting for prom queen? Yeah, but it's really just a formality. You know, the hardest part about the night we broke up... It wasn't your betrayal. It wasn't even falling out of a second-story window. The hardest part was losing my photos. Now I have to start it all over. Smile, Peyton. Thanks for picking us up, Mom. Just think, I couldn't have done this a month ago. Maybe I just would have spent a lot more time on the sidewalk. Pretend I'm not here. Sorry. This isn't exactly how I wanted to start our romantic prom night. That's okay. After everything we've been through in the past year, your Mom taking us to prom feels pretty good. - Kind of like we're kids again? - Yeah, like, I don't know-- Tonight we don't have to be married and pregnant. We can just be teenagers. Well, in that case, what's your curfew? You've reached Peyton's voice mail. Congratulations. Peyton, this isn't right. You're the one I want to be with tonight, prom or not. So call me, okay? Please. Miss Gattina, you're no longer allowed on school grounds. What are you gonna do, expel me? Don't make me call the police. Fine. All right, I've got a limo and a fully stocked minibar. Who's with me? This school sucks. Rachel, wait. I'm coming with you. What about Brooke? If she were here, she'd do the same thing. That's what friends do. See you, Turner. Expect a call from my lawyer about the sexual harassment. She's kidding. Relax, Turner. You need a drink. In fact... I confiscated this flask off one of your students. Give me a minute, Karen. It's time for our first dance. This song is special. I made it from your podcasts. I hope you see now how much thought I put into tonight. That's why I couldn't have you going to prom with Lucas and afterwards, giving yourself to him. I couldn't allow that, Peyton. You belong to me. We are gonna have the perfect prom. And afterwards, we're gonna go up to your bedroom and have the perfect prom night. Well, another text from Lucas. Let's see what it says. "I'm so sorry." "Please talk to me." "Prom sucks without you." Let's reply. Sorry. Running late. Wait for me. Hugs and kisses. Is an emoticon too much, you think? Oh, what the hell? Semicolon, close parenthesis. Glenda, you look great. Thank you. So I guess I'm not the only one alone at prom. Maybe Lucas Scott really is a goth at heart. Peyton's on her way, finally. But, you know, I could use company until she gets here. Good, 'cause I could use someone to help me pretend I'm above all this prom stuff. Good news. Nobody is using the "DW not I" car tonight, so it's all ours. - Sweet! - You ready to dance? Definitely. Definitely not. I think I failed the test. Okay, sit down. It's all right. No, it's not okay. Don't you always say at some point, you just gotta deal with the pain? Yeah, well, I'm an idiot. I'm gonna get you some punch. - Here you go. - Thank you. Honey, that ain't punch. Not bad, huh? Yeah, they shanghaied my flask when I came in, but I went to plan B, so it's all-- You spiked the punch? Dude, it's prom. My wife's pregnant, you idiot. Dude, it's prom. Dude. It's prom. You see that guy over there? He's got a key to a room at the Holiday Inn and a box of wine cooling in the mini fridge. You do this a lot? Helps kill time when you live on the sidelines. Okay, it's your turn. She's wondering if she should forgive the guy for being an ass for the last 17 years. Your Mom, right? And Daddy. Come on, Peyton. Your car is in the driveway, I know you're home. Okay, Peyton, your curling iron is still on, so if you wanna make it look like you're not here, at least make it convincing. Great. Hide in your creepy basement because you know I hate it. Too bad. I'm coming down anyway. Oh, my God. Well, well, Brooke Davis. One kiss wasn't enough so you came back for a second? Get off me. What happened? I thought you were leaving tonight. My flight got delayed by a few hours. Just enough time to crash prom. We'll hang out, and then I'll take you back to the airport. You sure? I mean, it's your prom night. Yeah, but it's your last night. Besides, prom just makes me think about Shelly. All right, Mouth, talk to me. I can't stop thinking about her. Her eyes, her smile, those-- Those little freckles on the small of her back. Hang on. The small of her back? The clean teen gave it up. Nice work. Yeah, so nice she never wants to see me again. Welcome to the rest of your life. Sex changes everything. Let's not talk about Shelly. This is your night. What do you wanna do? Well, I wanted to deflower you, but I guess I'm too late for that. I wanna do what you wanna do. - I want to get Shelly back. - Except that. Shelly is nuts, and this is coming from a girl who has seen a lot of nuts. I know, but... She made me feel dangerous, you know? Like I was more than myself. Mouth, quit talking about Shelly. - Yeah, I'm boring you. - No. You're making me jealous. So, when do I get the next chapter of your book? Or is that your strategy? Get me hooked and leave me hanging? No, that's not it. Truth is, I'm stuck... On the day my uncle Keith died. I'm sure it's hard to revisit that day. But telling the truth about it could help a lot of people. Maybe even you. See, that's just it. I have trouble with the details. There's a lot of things about that day I can't remember. You know, kind of like I blocked it out. Well, tell you what, why don't you walk me through the things you <i>can</i> remember? Maybe it'll help to talk it through. All right. It's a good thing I brought extra rope. Untie me, you freak! Figures you'd be good with your mouth. No one is gonna hear you. Help! You know, Peyton, you really shouldn't play your music so loud. Help! This is the weirdest prom ever. No Peyton, no Brooke, no Lucas, no Mouth. No Rachel. Good prom. Nathan, I need you to drive a student home. - What do you mean? - You have the DW not I car, don't you? Yeah, I guess I do. Who is it? Why did you come? We've been talking about senior prom since we were 8. I knew something was wrong. So you told someone you were coming? No, why-- At least I came. You should have told somebody. That is your problem, you are so ungrateful. - You're an idiot. - Don't call me an idiot, bitch. I hope he kills you first. That's a good idea. I know how much you hate her, Peyton. I was outside today, watching. I heard you tell Brooke that she was dead to you. Now I'm gonna make it official. Derek, wait. Don't you see, Peyton? I have been searching for some way to show you how much I love you. I am gonna hurt her as much as she hurt you. Look at me. If you really, really love me... Let me do it. This is my chance for revenge. You more than anybody should know that. Look, you were right about me. Look at me. You were right. We are so much alike. I have all the same feelings that you do, and I have all the same desires. I don't believe you. It's true. I just couldn't admit it before. I'm gonna prove it to you now, just untie me. You're lying. Come on, Derek. You've got the knife, and I'm half your size. Hey, baby. You better not be lying, Peyton. I'm not, baby. I promise. God, that felt good! Do it again. Why don't you make it hurt next time, bitch? All right, give me the knife. I'm gonna finish this bitch off. Give me the knife. I don't think I can trust you. Let's talk about trust, okay? See, you lied to me. You said you were my brother, didn't you? You went about everything all wrong, Derek. My God, you're-- You're such a beautiful boy. All you had to do was ask. Now, how about you give me the knife? And then when I'm finished with her, we'll go upstairs, okay? You want to cut vertically. It's counterintuitive. I know. All those times you said I was a back-stabbing bitch, you had no idea how right you were. God, did you have to hit me so hard? I'm so sorry. Peyton, he's moving. Just get out of here. No, I'm not leaving you. That was so disappointing. Oh, God. You know what? I changed my mind. I think I'll kill you first. Peyton, run! Yeah, Peyton. Run. You shouldn't lie, Peyton. It's not very nice. So this is where Peyton and I hid the day of the shooting. She told me she loved me. I just figured it was because she lost a lot of blood. But on some level, I knew it was true. I was just too afraid to admit it because I didn't want to hurt Brooke. You ever think maybe that's why you can't write about that day? Maybe you block things out because... you're afraid if you face the truth, it could hurt the other people you love. So I heard about you and Brooke Davis. High five. Well, I guess that means you guys have, like, an open marriage. That is so great. - Out. - What? - But my house is like a mile-- - Out. Cool. I'll see you guys Monday. You still want to be a teenager? Oh, my gosh. You know, I used to dream about how wonderful senior prom would be-- The last great party with our friends before we graduate. This night? This is nothing like I predicted. Yeah, well, you gotta be careful about your predictions. The school is back that way, where we going? It's a surprise. Open the door, Peyton. You already know I can break it down. You forgot to lock it. I didn't forget. Doesn't feel too good, does it? I'm not gonna run from you anymore, Derek. I'm not gonna run anymore, period. Now get up. You've been training. That's right, with my real brother. He taught me this. That is for making me afraid to sleep at night, you creepy, hair-smelling son of a bitch. Did you really think you could beat me? A girl? How about two girls? I'll get you, I'll get you! Brooke, kick him! Get off me! Peyton, 8th grade cheer camp! Hated the bottom of that pyramid. I know, you bitched about it all summer. Peyton, be careful, he's gonna lunge. They always lunge. I'm gonna call 911. Brooke, wait. Give me five minutes. Look, about earlier today... You were right. All those things that I said about your mom-- We both said a lot of things today. Besides, if you hadn't come, right now i'd-- i'd be bitching to both my moms about you in person. You saved me. You saved me, too. I guess now it's hoes over psychos. So where do we go from here? Prom? You know... I lied to you when I told you my flight was delayed. The truth is, I just wasn't ready to get on it. Why not? Because I wanted us to have our last dance. Let's have it. You're gonna break a lot of hearts, Mouth McFadden. So what do you think? Does this beat our prom? Let's see. The theme for our prom was "every rose has its thorn." Right. That night I also told you I was leaving to take the basketball scholarship. I want you to know that, for the past 17 years, I've been pretending that that was the right choice. For the last 17 years, I've been pretending that choice didn't break my heart. I want to ask you something. Do you think it's impossible for you ever to have feelings for me again? Like you once did? It's not impossible. What are we doing here? Well, do you remember the last time we were up here? Yeah, I do. It was when we were separated. I try to forget. Well, you showed me the predictions that you and Lucas make every year on the first day of school. And, well, I made a prediction of my own that night, remember? Haley and I will be together again by graduation. Did you really believe that? I was in a pretty dark place back then, but... I never stopped believing in us. My prediction came true, Hales. As far as I'm concerned, that makes this a great night. So... Think that leg's ready for a dance? I wish it were, but it's still a little stiff. - Sorry. - Then we won't use it. Well, it's my lucky night. That's me. I guess this is goodbye. I'm really glad you came back tonight, Rachel. Me too. You want to come with me? I can't. I'd miss finals and graduation. It's suicidal. It's just dangerous. It's okay, Mouth. See you later. Rachel, wait. I'm coming with you. So it's you. What do you mean? You lost your phone. - That's not my phone. - You sure? What's wrong with you? Where's my Mom? She's-- I'm sorry. I just... What are you doing here, Lucas? I guess I just keep feeling like-- I keep feeling like Keith's trying to tell me something. We already had this conversation, son. - I know, but-- - No. Keith's dead. He's not coming back. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, Luke. Open your eyes. - Keith. - Luke. I love you, now go. You ready for this, Brooke Davis? Welcome to prom, P. Sawyer. Attention, everyone, gather around the stage, it's time to announce our prom queen.
