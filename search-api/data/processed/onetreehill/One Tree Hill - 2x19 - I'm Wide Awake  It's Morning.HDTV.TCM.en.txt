To the lonely themselves, that wears a mask,… the most miserable outcast,… hugs some memory,… or some illusion. How much for the wall? Come on, man, I’m serious, I-I’ll take it. The whole thing; the… pink paint, the creepy clown. Look, I’ll give you, uh, five-hundred and… whatever fell on the floor. - How ya doing, Coop? -Better than you, you little bitch! Come here and give your uncle some love! Hey. It’s good to see you, kid. So, your mom called me. And I gotta tell you, Nate, if my big sister is calling me, then the situation is pretty eff’d up, you know? Nah, keep it. And by the way, I could beat your ass for looking like this, you handsome bastard! I mean, I’m starting to finally feel good about myself; I’m a race car driver, I’m making a few bucks and now I gotta compete with this?! -Dude, stop it. I’m serious, what’s wrong with her? What, d’ya marry a blind girl? Unless it Oh man, it's your gear, isn't it? OK, drop your shorts, let’s have a look. -No, come on, let’s see it! -What're you doing here, man? Perspective, nephew, I’m here to adjust yours. Hey Brooke, you decent? Am I dressed? Yes. Am I decent? Never have been. -What time is it anyway? -Ah, it's early. I’m sorry to wake you; I just gotta stash something in my closet. So, I went to see Jake. How’s Peyton doing, anyway? I'm worried about her. Yeah, me too. It’s hard, isn’t it? Being apart from the person you care about. Yeah. So, what’s in the bag, anyway? I don't know yet. Anyway, uh, apparently I’m… taking a road trip with Nathan and his uncle. So, just tell Peyton if… she needs anything, that Sure. I got her. Thanks. See ya. On the first day of this class I presented you with a controversial notion; that ethics matter more than profits. Anyone buying that yet? -Yes? -Yeah, I have a question. May I ask what you’re doing in my classroom? ...Auditing. I was wondering, what would you say about a person… let’s call this person… Randy. Now Randy hires a private investigator to dig up dirt on a competitor. I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave. Of course. Oh, one last question. Let’s say our guy, Randy, was teaching a class on ethics, and yet, was sleeping with one of his students… and let’s call her… Sharon. Now, Sharon, is getting an A. Now it seems to me that Randy is not only a hypocrite, but also a candidate for dismissal. Discuss! So Coop, how great is it that you… get to race cars for a living? Oh, you know; fame, money, extremely hot wives. -Ex-wives. -Look who's talking. Check it out. I’ll tell you what; there’s only one view better than this one. That one. -This is Jeff Burton’s car. -Yes it is. Hey, you guys wanna meet him? Hey Jeff! Hey Coop. -These two knuckleheads are fans of yours. -Oh, is that right? How you guys doing? -Good. -Good. -Hey, your car was really fast out there. Who’s driving it? -That my crew chief, Ray Green. Oh, yeah, I know Ray, he’s a good man. -It’s a shame what happened. -Yeah, it is. Look; you guys stay out of trouble. I’ll see you in Darlington. -You got it. So, Jeff Burton mentioned Ray Green. Isn’t he the guy that took a swing at his team owner? Yeah, that team owner was my dad. He couldn’t get a sponsor to touch him after that. I found him about five years ago down in Florida. He was trying to drink all the scotch in South Beach! It was bourbon. It was bourbon. If I knew what a pain in the ass you were gonna be, I woulda finished the job. Ray, let me ask you a question; I mean, I’m not a real smart guy but if your not in my car and I’m not in my car, who is? Hey, Tony?! No way. It’s still not right, dad; tight in, loose off. Nate, you remember my daughter, Daytona? You got your braces off. Yeah, like four years ago. -It's so good to see you. -It's good to see you too. So, Daytona, how long’s it been since you’ve seen Nate? Well, I think, last time I saw him, he was shorter than me. -By like half an inch. -Whatever, shorty. Hey, hey, we don’t let visitors in here. Uh-uh, this is all high tech, you know, complicated, secret stuff. Come on. So Lucas, this is my little brother; Garrett. -What's up? -Hey, I’m Lucas; Nathan’s brother. -Hey. So, like, your mom’s Cooper’s sister? -Oh, my mom slept with Cooper’s sister’s husband. OK. Whatever that means. Sounds messed up. It is. -So, you wanna hop in a car? -Can I? -Yeah. -Yeah, come on. -Wow, man, I ain’t seen you in forever. -I know. How's that, uh,... marriage thing going? Not so good. Oh, man, that sucks! -Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it. -Oh, no, no, I mean,… you’re gonna be, like, divorced before… I even get a girl to date me. What d’ya think, Luke? This is awesome! You guys wanna drive em? Are you serious? Take a crash course today. You learn about the cars, the track. Spend the night, you can race tomorrow. How about it? Dude, I'm so there! -Nathan? -Yeah. Hell yeah! Me too? No. Andy, the man has to be stopped! Th-the fact that he would waltz into your classroom and insinuate! You know something? I’m not sure how I was gonna tell Deb about his little arrangement with Jules… Emily; whoever the hell she was but, now, I hope Deb destroys him! Oh, uh, Peyton’s here. Ok, bye. Hi, Peyton. -How's Jake? -Same. Is there anything I can do for you? Sure. You can tell Brooke that I’m fine! Actually, I was a little worried about you, too. So we thought we’d all spend the day together. OK, I love you both, for all the caring but kind of… creepy attention you’ve been giving me, but,… what’s wrong with wearing a little misery now and then? This while thing sucks for Jake, and,... why can’t I be bummed for a little bit, you know? You can totally be bummed; you just have to do it with us and you have to do really fun stuff while you’re bumming! How you doing… boozy? Great, actually. As a matter of fact, I’m turning over a new leaf. From now on, I’m looking on the bright side of things. Staying positive. Oh, Dan paid Jules to seduce Keith. Life sucks, I need a drink! Ok, so, you wanna enter turn one, high. And then…take this curve… So, uh, you got the new 50 Cent? -Garrett, they need to pay attention. -Yeah, yeah, I got that. He's pretty good. What’s up with Tony Yayo; is he like in jail or out of jail, or what? Oh, Nathan, it’s great that you wanna talk G-Unit hip-hop with my little brother, but,… if you make a mistake at 160 miles an hour, it’s gonna be a lot more than your heart that’s broken. Whatever! No girl’s gonna out-drive my, anyway. Ok. -I miss Nathan. -I miss Keith. -I miss Jake. -I don’t really miss Felix, at all. Or my parents that much. But I miss my money. -You know what I always do when I need to feel better? -Drink? No. Dance. What? -Oh, Deb, no. I -Shut up and dance. Come on, Karen. Dance to my divorce. Oh, hell, I can dance to that. So, the one thing that drives me crazy about home schooling is just, you know, getting behind on all the fashions… and also, every now and then, I like to, you know, catch up on the gossip. I don’t know, is that wrong of me? You might just… wanna…watch the track. Yeah, ok, Daytona, we get the point, alright? You don’t need to get all crazy. Oh, you think this is crazy? No! This is crazy! So, a student reported my relationship with you. I have to see the Dean,… tonight. Tell me you don’t live in a tent all year round. No, it’s just nice to get out under the stars sometimes. Plus, Garrett hates it, so, that’s a plus. -You gonna play something? -What d'ya wanna hear? NWA? Maybe a little Tupac? Surprise us. What? It's Ryan Adams. -Did it suck that bad? -No, it's... it's not that. It's...a Haley thing. I just.. wish there was something I could do to help him. -What was he like when you were kids? -He was.. kind. Just a really… sweet guy. And a good friend... pre basketball. By the way, your marshmallow’s on fire. You know, Mrs. Scott, you really had a lot to drink. -Are you sure I can’t walk you to the door? -Oh, no, I’m fine, thank you so much, Brooke. Say hi to your big, expensive house for me. Um, Ok, nighty night! Mouth? -I am so wasted! -Why? What happened? You know, I've just been.. partying all night and, like, drinking! I can see that! Um,… let's get you home. No. No. No, no, no. I mean, we should drive around for a while because, you know, my parents are awhooo. I totally get it, but I have to take you somewhere coz I can only do one ride at a time. Are you sure, coz I am really messed up on the hooch, you know? I’m sorry, Mouth, those are the rules. Ok, here's the deal, I’m not drunk, I… just… I knew your shift was tonight and… I wanted to hang out. Sorry? You are so lucky I am lonely tonight! Hop up front. -Score! -I can't believe you. Woa! -I'm sorry. How'd it go? What'd he say? Well, the Dean presented me with two options; either I end the relationship or, uh,… I lose my job! -Well, there’s gotta be some way, -So I quit. -Andy, you love teaching. -Not as much as I love you. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was a no-brainer, Karen. There’ll be other teaching positions. But I hope there’s never another woman in my life. Erica? What happened? Oh, nothing really. I was hanging out with some of the guys from Felix’s party, and… it just kinda got out of hand. -Out of hand how? -Nothing major,... just grabby and... not what I excepted. -Sure that’s all it was? I’m sorry those guys were like that. Thanks. I feel stupid for even calling, it’s just… I got scared and… I don’t know, disappointed. Well, I’m glad you called, because we were just about to get some food. Yeah! What d’ya say, Marsh, you in? Ok. But, call me Erica. You know, when my wife left, I was a mess. You’re saying you’re not still a mess? I mean, you should have been; Kerry was… really hot. -Yeah, well they usually are when they’re supermodels. And by the way, shut up! I had to let it all go, you know; the feeling that I wasn’t… good enough for Kerry… how much I resented the fact that she wanted things besides me. I mean, it wasn’t fair to her. Hell, I wasn’t going to give up racing for her. I would have. I mean given up basketball for Haley. Kind of did. Well you think… maybe that’s the reason she left? I mean, when you met her, would you have given it up then? No, probably not. Maybe your not the person she fell in love with anymore, man. Maybe she’s not the person you thought she was. Look, I don’t say this… to hurt you, Nate, but… it's just... people change, you know? So after she left you, I mean,… was there ever a day when it… felt better? -Sure,... followed by a day when it felt worse. I mean, that’s just the way it goes! But I gotta tell ya, you’d be amazed at how therapeutic two hundred miles an hour can be. I'll bet, man. Look, Nate,… love is a pretty great thing, man, maybe it's the geatest thing. But it's gotta be true love... for the both of you. What if it was? What if it still is? Well, if it still is, man, you fight like hell for it. But the harder question is: what if it wasn't? Trust me,... that one's a bitch. I think you’re on the wrong side of the desk, little man. I think you’re on the wrong side of me. I lost my teaching position tonight. -Really? That’s terrible, what happened? -Do you have any faith, Dan? -Faith? You know,... Do you believe in anything? God? Science? Karma? -No. No, I don't believe in karma. But I do believe I’ll give you a chance to remove yourself from my establishment… before I personally remove you. You know, we’re very different, you and I. See, I’m a big believer in karma. I think it's amazing how... most of the time, tragedy befalls whoever deserves it. You know, if you’re gonna threaten me, kid,… at least do it like a man. Karma finds us all in time, Dan. But, you know, I find that sometimes it helps to just, you know, point it in the right direction. Wait. You should take a job application. I mean, now that you’re unemployed. You know, an hour ago I wouldn’t have believe it but,… it’s turning out to be a pretty night. Thank you. For hanging out with me. You're welcome. We should get you home, though. -Nah, I think I’ll walk. Are you sure? -Ok, well call if you need anything. -I will. See ya! Hey, you wanna walk with me? -I’d love to but I have to finish my shift. -I know. I meant you. I’m sorry, Brooke. Did you want me to hang out with you for the rest of your shift? No, it's fine. You should go. Are you sure? Go get her Tiger. Hello? Hi. Is this the ‘safe rides’ programme? It sure is. -Well, I was wondering if you could come pick me up. -Of course. -Good. I would love to feel safe for a night. Thanks. Thanks for walking me home, Mouth. No problem. Thanks for inviting me. Well, I-I guess I’ll see ya. I loved what you said about Brooke during the campaign. Even though it’s pretty much the reason I lost. I suppose there’s no reason to… ask you out, then? Like… on a date? I was kinda pretending this was a date. Ok. Did we have fun? You tell me. I think we had a blast! -We did. Good night. Yes! Alright, four cars, three laps. You can all talk in an open frequency in your helmets. Now if you get a little squirrelly out there, just take your foot off the gas downshift, and you either come into the pits or pull the car in the inside apron. There’s a tack in your car; tells you the RPM when it hits 6, you’re up around 140 miles and hour. Nobody goes to 7? Got it? Alright, Garrett will lead you out in the pace car. Garrett, don’t wreck the pace car. OK, may the best man win. Well that should eliminate you three girls. Good luck, Nate. Gentlemen!! Helloo! And beautiful ladies. Start your engines! This is stinking great! You sure you boys wanna be humiliated? Notice he didn't say girl? Ready guys? -Oh, yeah! Nathan? -Let's do this! So, I was thinking, maybe I should just drive in reverse for a while, you know, just to make it close. Nate, coming up on your left! So, what’s going on back here in the slow part of the world? Is that why Pokey left you? Alright, last lap, Nate. You better bring it. Ahhh, the low line is closed my friend. And the high side. Well, well, that was almost impressive, even for a man like you. Looks like you got some competition out there, Cooper. Lock and load, Nate, he’s yours. You got him, Nate! Go chick time, nephew. Nathan, I love you but I sure hope you bought a change of shorts. Oh no, Cooper, you did not just bump him! Rough as racing, Nathan! Looks like another chequered flag for me! Thank you very much. Good try, Nate. Nice run, guys. Tony, were you in second place or third from last? OK, bring it into the pits. Nathan, you not only missed your pit stall, you just broke a half a dozen pit road rules. Nathan. That’s the first victory lap I’ve ever seen for last place; I like it. Hey, Nate, you alright? Nathan? You reduce your speed and you come in! You know what I need Coop? Some of that two hundred mile therapy we were talking about. Nathan...! Nobody goes past 7 on the tack, right? Let’s see about 8. Oh god, too fast! -NATHAN!? You’re right, Coop, You’re right, Coop, this feels pretty damn good. Come one. Hold on, man. Hold on. Hold on, Nathan. I’ve got severe respiratory distress; heart rate rapidly accelerating. Tachycardiac. You’ve been in an accident, son. You’re gonna be ok, Nate. -Hey, we’re right here, buddy. -Promise me. -Anything. Six units of blood. Don't call Haley. Well, well. It’s my wife; the lawn gnome. You gonna tell me where you were all night, Anna Nicole? We’re leaving again, are we? -I know about what you did to Keith. I see. What's all this? I’m boiling water to throw on you. ...And  what's ths syrup for? -Oh, that’s so it sticks to you. I wish you would have died on that floor in the beach house. I went to the chapel and I prayed for you to die. That’s the kind of horrible, pathetic, shell of a person I’ve become. But no more. I’m walking out that door, Dan, because if I don’t,… one of us is going to die soon. What? Lucas! Where’s Nathan? How is he? -Deb, I'm so sorry. -Mrs Scott? -Yes. Your son has had severe blunt trauma to his chest and it was caused by a high speed collision. His right lung has collapsed and he’s losing a great deal of blood. -Is he in surgery? -we’re prepping him but the antigen in his blood,... it's rare. -I’m the same, I’ll donate. You better pray it's ok. You oughta lock your front door, you know? Some old crazy guy might come in here and get you. Old crazy guys don’t scare me. I know this is not really appropriate; but Jake said that you wouldn’t answer the door if I knocked so… I should just walk in. -You've been to see him? I have. Do you mind if we... sit down? -Yeah,... The bed? The PTA’d have a field day with this! Have you ever...been to Florida, Peyton? Once, with my dad. There’s a little town… just off the Gulf of Mexico. Weather’s perfect year round; kinda like today. It's almost a paradise. It’s a great place to raise a child. Or, if you’re family, to protect one till their daddy can arrive. Jenny's fine, Peyton. Jake wanted you to know that. I went by to see him this morning… and he told me he didn’t want me to visit anymore. He said it was too hard. I can understand that. I know you miss your mom, honey. Just like I miss my wife. But... think about Jake; he misses both women that he loves. Mr and Mrs Scott? -Yes. Nathan is in surgery. We were able to locate an additional supply of his blood type. He needed more than what I gave? Mrs. Scott, how long have you been abusing prescription drugs? I’m sorry, your blood was unusable. Excuse me. Lucas! It's ok. I'm here for you. How long with the pills. -Since I quit my job. Why? ...Because I'm married to you. Look, man, I was just trying to help, alright? Dan. Calm down. There's your karma, Dan. He would have turned left. Nathan's an athlete; his reflexes would have been...to turn left. But, he didn't. It's almost like like he aimed for the wall. You know? Like... like he tried to crash.
