Mom… I want to leave Tree Hill. This is from Lucas. I’m sorry; I shouldn’t have hid it from you. You’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me? I was going to. - When?! After you read it first?! - No! It’s Dan. He had a heart attack. Your father is unconscious Nathan and now you’re telling me you got married? - Mrs Scott, we’ve... - Shut up, Haley. Shut your selfish little mouth! T.H. White said; perhaps we all give the best of our hearts uncritically… to those who hardly think about us in return. The Phoenix Effect isn’t uncommon in cardiac patients. They grow… remorseful… introspective, sometimes even joyous. Really? Is it… permanent? Time will tell. The important thing is to keep him calm. Don’t upset him. Three questions. You ready? Was that your first one? Number one; what happened to your hair? I left it in Charleston. You and Haley still married? Yeah, she hasn’t thrown me out yet. Number two; why’d you come back? It was the right thing to do. Which actually brings me to my number two; how’s your… how’s Dan doing? Oh, he’s alright. He’s still alive, probably freaking out about me and Haley; like my mom. Alright, last question; you regret all that ‘you’re my brother’ stuff, now that you’re back? - Absolutely. You? - Definitely. So I can totally see your family tripping out. I mean I freaked out and I’m not even related to Haley. Actually, you are now. She’s gotta be pregnant. Or in love. I’m going with pregnant. Please, he’s a Scott boy, just look at one and snap your… never mind, um… what’s new in your musical world right now? I dunno. The new Keane’s pretty good or Modest Mouse, Pilot to Gunners. Keane… - Mighty Mouse… - It’s Modest. Why are you typing those? I’m putting them on your turn-ons. I’m adding you to Lust Factor dot com. Brooke! Oops! Too late. We can check your scores in a couple of hours. I told you; I am not about chasing guys right now. Doesn’t mean I can’t chase them for you and missy, if you’re not about chasing guys… why are there half a dozen e-mails to Jake Jagielski in your sent mail folder? He hasn’t answered any of them and I swear I am changing all of my passwords. Okay, I don’t know, alright? But ever since he-who-can’t-be-named, I just feel like I need to shake things up and not guys, okay, like… life, important stuff. Guys are important. And speaking of the nameless one; he’s waiting so we should get going. What do you think he wants? If he’s smart… forgiveness. What do you think? I was thinking; bar right over there, then some lights… DJ, right over here… and then... the three of us trying to be friends… right about... well, there. Okay, totally confused over… here. I wanna throw a party for Nathan and Haley, okay? You know, everyone’s been so… weirded out about them getting married and nobody’s stepping up and just saying ‘hey, it’s cool! Let’s celebrate.’ We’re their friends… we should do this for them. And since nobody plans a party better than you and nobody rocks a party better than you… I was hoping the three of us could work it out. The party part or the friends part? All of it. Look, I guess you found the letter. I should get something to drink. Look! I meant what I said. Okay, and now that I’m back, it’s a little embarrassing - so how about we just... - Don’t mention it! Great. So what do you say huh? You in? - Any excuse for a party. - For Nathan and Haley, why not. Great! We’ll do it together. Come on! Check it out! Fake cough? That’s the best you could come up with? I know, I had nothing. Have you ever seen the sky so blue? - It’s a nice day. - They’re all nice. Dan, - we should talk about Keith. - I don’t blame you, Deb. Lord knows I’ve given you enough reasons to stray. I think I’ll get some rest now. - Okay. - How about you bring the divorce papers by? I should sign them. You never know what could happen to me. Nothing is going to happen to you, Dan. It already has. Excellent right back at you BIL. Okay, I’ve been gone for, what; few days and you already forgotten my name? - Who’s Bill? - B-I-L; Brother In Law. That’s you! Oh-ho, crap. I’m related to you? Look, I know… I was sketchy when I left but… just, you know, you surprised me and… I just want you to know I’m happy for you, Hales. I know. And Nathan told me about you calling and asking about Dan and us and… it’s cool. Thank you. Hey! Get your own wife. Okay, that just sounds weird. Oh, crap. Can you grab that for me real quick? Thanks. Oh look, it’s our very own Britney Spears and… whoever she married this week. I have a question for you guys; what do you think? Pink booties or blue? Booties? Brooke, I’m not pregnant. No. The only way this isn’t totally screwed up is if you’re knocked up but don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me. What’s this lame-ass joke about you guys getting married? He’s in shock now that you’re officially off the market. - It’s true Tim, Haley’s preggers. - Brooke! Right; and Lucas moved away. You guys gotta do better if you gonna get one over on the Tim. The Tim Hi. This is for Mr Scott; Dan. I don’t know what to call him. You can take it to him yourself. Nathan said that probably wasn’t a good idea. And coming over here was? Mrs Scott, I’m not sorry I married Nathan but I am sorry about how we ambushed you with it. I know you’re dealing with a lot right now. Anyway, Lucas is throwing us a party and we’d… I’d love it if you could come. Nathan’s father nearly dies and you want to have a party? And even if Dan were fine, I would not and will not give you my blessing for destroying my sons life or, and you can trust me on this, your own. Hey hoe. Brooke, step away from the computer. Soon as I check your ‘Lust Factor’ score, this morning you were up to a 7.6. Out of a 10? Brooke you did not post my ass on the internet! Of course I did! And well, well, well, it raised Miss P’s overall by five tenths on a point and you now have fifty-three guys waiting to meet you. I can’t believe this. Too old. Oh, too hairy. Too… mine! Oh too female, but a 9.8, that’s interesting. Here we go; here’s an emo looking, sappy, guitar playing loser. - He’s perfect for you. - Not interested and I’ve gotta burn Nathan and Haley’s CD so get up. Move it! Fine! So, what do you think our... new pal Lucas wrote in that letter anyway? Didn’t matter when he was gone, why should it matter now? You can shave your head dawg, but you still aint as pretty as me. How you doing Skills? Question is how you doing man. I’m good! I’m good. Alright, here it is. How bout you tell me da truth in da next five seconds and I forget you jus lied to me. I woke up in Charleston and realised... nobody knows me here, nobody knows about Dan, my mom, all the things I regret. It’s all been erased. You know, it’s gone. And it felt good. Knowing that whoever I decided to be from that day forward was the person that they’d see. Then the phone rang. Well hey, what could I do to make it easier for you? My bald head brother. Actually, see if you can get the guys to help me out a little later. Okay, time and place. Beautiful, thanks Skills. No doubt. Hey yo Luke! You gotta let it flow baby. You know, like me. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. As you can see, I’m trying. Alright. No doubt. Hey, Nathan. It’s good to see you. - Haley told me what you said to her. - Nate! We’re married now mom, and you and dad can flip out all you want but it’s done! Nobody cares what you think! I only want what’s best for you, Nathan. Then how about you and dad back off… and shut up about Haley and me. Your father doesn’t even know! - You haven’t told him? - No. You’re such an adult, why don’t you tell him? The news will probably kill him and believe me, the guilt from that will stay with you a lot longer than Haley ever will. Thanks for the love mom. All these empty bedrooms. We could open a crack house; an upscale one. Yeah, like a crack resort. She came back for Mr Waffles. - Nathan do something? - No. - His… mother, she said... - You were ruining her son’s life. Yeah, basically. Of course she did. In-laws… are like the FBI, honey. They have a system and they follow it. First manoeuvre is you’re ruining her child’s life. - Yeah, then it goes to; she can’t cook. - Her house is dirty. We found some hash in the guestroom. There’s only one way to deal with them kiddo. Screw em. I mean, you know, don’t actually have sex with them. Dad! What your father’s saying is, if you’re gonna come home crying every time you let them get the best of you; you might as well move back in now, before we give your stuff to charity. You wanted this Haley. Time to grow up. By the way, the dog threw up on Mr Waffles. - Keith. - Hey. I meant to call you but… you know, this thing with Dan is… Anyway... Luke left his IPod in the truck. Oh, I’m sorry. In that you had to come back. But I’ll be honest, I’m relieved that Lucas is home. Yeah. And you too. Well I’m not sure how long I’m gonna stay but... you know, we’ll see. I’ll see ya. - That kid looks kinda like Luke. - It can’t be, Luke moved away. Ah, hey thanks for helping out guys. So you throwin a party for da devil huh? This part of your fresh start? You know what, you’re going to be surprised Skills. - Haley’s turned him into a pretty decent guy. - Hey if you say so man. Hey dawg, with dis new look of yours, really don’t impress me. Now if you get a afro like Fergie, den we can talk. - Woah, Peyton. That looks great. - Thanks. Okay, for future reference; having a convertible filled with inflated rubber, not smart! - Helium condoms? - What? If she’s pregnant, it’s a reminder and if she’s not; it’s a reminder it’s cute. - Hey Mouth, how’s your bod? - Skinny. You know Skills and Fergie, right? Of course I do. Hey guys, do you know Peyton? Hi. What’s up skinny girl? Peyton’s an 8.1 on the ‘Lust Factor’. Soon to be a 9. Now I was thinking we can take the cameras, put them out on the tables, people can take pictures for the wedding wall. Nice. Care to know what else I have planned? I know you do! I have spray string; for when Tutor Girl and Boy arrive and… Mouth, come here. Sit. What is that? This, Missy blond girl, is the Brooke Davis version of  ‘Spin the Bottle’. Only now, it’s ‘Spin the Body’. Watch. Okay, you two have to make out. And last but not least; we have ‘Five Minutes in the Elevator’. - Isn’t it ‘Five Minutes in the Closet’? - Yeah, if you’re in junior high. But the great part about this is; you know how everybody has their elevator list? What? Your elevator list! Come on! The list of people you’re allowed to have sex with if you’re ever stuck in an elevator with them. - Halle Berry. - Beyonce. - Jack Black. - Brooke Davis. Well! Everybody makes a list and if two people have each others names… five minutes in the elevator. Sounds like fun Brooke. Nice work! Thank you. Now all we need is a Nathan and a Haley. No. Yes. No. Yes. How you doing dad? I’m sorry about the play-offs Nathan. All on me. It’s okay, it’s done. - I know things haven’t been great between us lately... - Dad, listen, before you say anything... there’s something you should know. Haley and I… we got married. Uh, you trying to give me another heart attack, son? No, it’s true. Sorry we didn’t tell you but... well there it is. So that’s it for basketball. - Why should it be? - You’ll see. You think you can do it all now but, one day you’ll look up and realise all you have to live with are your mistakes. It’s not a mistake dad. We’re both happy. It’s a good thing. I was talking about my mistakes too Nathan. Sooner or later we all choose a path. Sometimes you never look back and sometimes life forces you to. Okay… I’m just gonna let you get some rest, alright dad? Nathan. Would you ask Lucas to drop by? I’d really like to see your brother. Hey! This is great, man. Hey, shouldn’t you be home getting ready? - Yeah but I… I needed to talk to you first. - Yeah? I just went down to the hospital and… he said he wants to see you. Luke, when I was younger, I thought I had the best of things; I had a father in my life but if you want my advice; just stay away, okay? The best thing I ever did was get emancipated. It feels good to be free. Lucas? - Oh hey, Nathan. - Hey. I guess a congratulations are in order. Well anyway, I was just heading out so… see ya tonight. It’s a brave new world, huh? Hm, this is interesting. Oh yeah. From the mind of Brooke Davis. For a twenty dollar donation, you get a fake ID… and… Nathan and Haley get the cash. Go on! Make me younger. Ready? One, two, three; smile! So I found a course catalogue in the recycling bin. Were you thinking about college? A couple of classes. And now, not so much. - Why not? Coz I’m back? - No, it’s just. It can wait. For what? So... Nathan told me Dan wants to see me. Way to bury the lead. Why didn’t you tell me? I just did. You gonna go? I dunno. What do you think? I think it’s a tough call where Dan’s concerned. Let me tell you a little dirty secret about being a parent; I don’t have a road map anymore than you do. This time the only advice that I can give you is whatever you decide with Dan… be careful. Hm… here you go mom. You’re a kid again. You know, on second thought, no thanks. - Hey old man, there you are. - Keith! Bought you a decent cup of coffee. Thanks. Yeah, of course it’s cold because I stopped by the hospital first, nurse told me you checked out. That’s a pretty big risk to be taking with your eyesight. Who are you to be lecturing me about risk? Oh, here it comes; the old Whitey dodge. Hey, we’re talking about you. You said you went to the hospital. How much can I bet that you didn’t bother to go see your brother while you were there? - That is not the point. - That’s exactly the point. Look Keith, we both know that Dan is a world class jerk but he’s still your brother. When you get to be my age, and you’re facing something like this… damn surgery, then the most important thing in your life becomes your life. And the person you were when you lived it. Um, I’m pretty sure that Dan doesn’t wanna see me. So what?! You be the better man, Keith. Alright, what happened this time? I kind of... slept with Deb. Oh, forget everything I said. Hey Brooke, what are you wearing tonight? I mean it’s more of a party than a wedding reception right? Brooke! Nice! We are gonna get you a ten yet. Hey, is Peyton around? She said she was gonna loan me something to wear. Yeah, she’ll be out in a second. - Oh my god! Where did you get that picture of her? - You gotta love modern technology. It’s for a little project that I’m doing, to help expand her horizons. By posting nude pictures of her on the internet? Don’t worry. She’s gonna thank me when she sees the guys that are lining up. Oh, he’s cute. Oh, really cute. - Oh that’s what I’m talking about. - Down girl. You can look at the menu all you want but from now on, you eat at home. - Great party dawg. - Hey. Thanks Fergie, enjoy. - Hi. - Hey. Kind of ironic, it says; ‘Naley Forever’ but it’s a temporary tattoo. It’s symbolic. They’re here! They’re here! - Mouth, did you get the extra spray string? - Sorta. They were outta spray string so… I got cheese instead. Lucas. - Oh hey, Mrs Scott. - Hi. - Nice to see you. - I brought a gift. Oh, great, ah just set it on the table. Okay, thanks. Are you with Nathan or Haley? Peyton. - Shot in the dark; ‘Lust Factor’? - Definitely. Okay… my friend put me on there as a joke. I’m not looking. I’m up to a 9.6. I’m not on the market. Well I’m on your page so I'm me sometime. Are you crazy? What were you thinking, letting him go? He’s gotta be like a 9.5... 6. And remind me to kill you later. How many more are coming? I thi... I need something to drink. Brooke! Do not fake cough me! - Deb, you came. - Yeah. I’m not sure why, this is... it’s pretty wild. Hm, looks fine. You wanna dance? No... I think I’ll leave the dancing to the kids. - Uh, you know, let’s sit. - Yeah okay. You're hungry? How can you be so at ease with all of this? I know this is hard for you, Deb. Oh don’t tell me you honestly think this can work? Haley’s been like a daughter to me. And Nathan used to be a son to me. On top of that, you can’t possibly know what they’re up against Karen. You didn’t get married when you were their age. - Mom? - Mrs Scott, you came. Yeah. Thought I should. I’m really glad you did. Wanna come meet my parents? Oh this is Dan, I really should take it. Hi. I was wondering if you were ever gonna come visit me. I was just… waiting for the right time and... I guess then I realised there wasn’t gonna be a right time so… here I am. I’m sorry Dan. About what happened with me and Deb. I... I wish I can take it all back. I haven’t been much of a brother to you Keith, or a husband to Deb, or a father. I guess I’ve just had other things on my mind; success, business. Well, you just worry about getting well. Okay? I’ll help out at the dealership till you… get back on your feet. I know you’re gonna have a very strong opinion about this but... Actually that would take a load off my mind. - You’re okay with that? - Things change. People change. Oh, well okay then. Um… get well Danny. There you guys are. - Hey. - Hey. Oh, now we’ve lost Nathan’s mom somewhere. She actually came? Guess she’s trying to make an effort. Well then… we will too. Oh, but first we have something to tell you. Oh yeah, it’s ah, well it’s kind of a wedding present. - Ah, for us. - Okay. What is it? Well, we got ourselves an RV. You see, we always said when the last bird flew, we’d sell the coop, buy an RV and hit the road. Who knew someday was gonna be today? You guys are leaving town? Oh baby. The beauty of a motor home is that we can launch a sneak attack anytime and anywhere. This is how we set each other free. Uh... Peyton, right? - How do you know? - Lucky guess. Coach! How are ya? Well I’m old, but I wasn’t always that way. There was a time when I was young and in love like the two of you. Here. Camilla stitched that during the first year of our marriage. It’s a baby blanket. Course, we spent all those years just the two of us in the nest but I think she’d like that to go to somebody she would have been really fond of. Oh coach, that’s so sweet of you, thank you, but I’m not pregnant. Well you never know; he is a Scott after all. Would you excuse me for just a minute? Yeah. Thanks coach. Okay, foot on orange. What do I have to do? Pee on a stick? Um… if that’s your kicks. Do I know what we’re talking about? Brooke, I am not pregnant. Look. It’s a birth control patch. I’ve had it for weeks. - So it really is just about love. - Yeah. What other reason do we need? You did a good thing here Luke man. Thanks Skills. Hey, so I was thinking about Charleston right? And about how you could have been dis new person. Yeah well see, I remember the person that you used to be. Why not just be him again? Trust me. I mean you so lucky dawg, you surrounded by so many people who you love. You see, now you gotta make yourself one of those people. - Alright? - Yeah. My dawg. I’ll be back - Hey. - Oh hey! Where you been hiding? You know, just… had some things to take care of. Luke, I know how much Charleston meant to you. But… looks like I’m gonna be taking over the dealership until Dan gets better so… we’re gonna be living here for a while. You okay with that? Yeah. You know it’s probably better to get a fresh start with the people - who actually matter in your life right? - Yeah. Um… speaking of, excuse me. You ladies throw a pretty rocking party. Yeah well, doesn’t suck. What are you smiling about? You didn’t read it, did you? - The letter. - Oh. Course we did! Oh, so you were ok with the P.S. about the three of us? - Yeah, sure. - Absolutely. Really? Really? So the threesome with the hot fudge didn’t bother you, huh? I knew we should have read the letter. We thought you’d left town. So we, sort of, burned it. Burned it, wow... You know what? I’m glad you didn’t read it. I mean all that stuff I said it’s not important now. And what matters now is that the three of us… we’re gonna be okay. Hey. Keith! Well… I’m back. I… I’ve decided to run the dealership for Dan, at least for a little while. You’ve given up a lot for Dan. He doesn’t deserve a brother like you. Actually, he deserves better. Mom. You met Haley’s parents? Hi, I’m Lydia James, this is my husband Jim. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Sorry to hear about your husband. How’s he doing? He’s... he’s struggling with a new reality, I suppose we both are. Well, I look forward to the day when we can all break bread and… argue about religion and politics and how best to raise our grandchildren. Yeah, no hurry on the last one by the way. Well you’ve raised a fine man. - He’s not a man. - Sorry? I said he’s not a man, he’s a boy and none of this would have happened if you people had had enough common sense to stop it! - Mom! - No! I am not going to stand here and make nice and pretend like this is all okay when it isn’t. Then don’t! It’s one thing for you to raise your voice at me but don’t come in here and dump on my parents! We made our decision, we got married and we’re happy and if you’re not here to celebrate with us, then you should just go home because I don’t want you here! Nicely played. I am so sorry. As if things aren’t bad enough with your family. You couldn’t make it any worse. You know what’s weird? Even with my parents leaving town, I have never felt safer in my life. You know what’s weirder? Seeing you take my mom’s head off back there actually kinda turned me on. - Five minutes in the elevator? - How bout right here? I forgot how beautiful Nathan’s smile was until tonight. What hurts most is… it went away when he saw me. What happened? I bitched out Haley’s parents and made things worse. - Nice work. - It’s not funny Dan. He has a new family now. Don’t worry. I promise, together we’ll get our son back. Ah, I guess it’s no surprise that some would criticize us; call us unfit parents. And normally… they would be right. And for those who say they’re too young, let me just say; hell you can drive at sixteen, go to war at eighteen, you can drink at twenty-one and retire at sixty-five so how old do you have to be… before your love… is real? So here’s to you Haley-bub, and Nathan; she’s your headache now. I think everybody… knows that Nathan and I got of to a pretty sketchy start. - Nathan; mutual hatred sound about right? - Worse! Yeah. You see, then a funny thing happened; Haley. She showed me that you can find the good in everybody, if you just give them a chance. The benefit of the doubt. Sometimes, people disappoint you. Sometimes they surprise you. But you never really get to know them… until you listen for what’s in their hearts and that’s what Haley did with Nathan. That’s what we should do for them. So for you sceptics out there, prepare to be surprised. So this is to my… brother and my little sis in-law, and in love. - Cheers. - Cheers. I’m glad you came, son. Synchro : Amariss
