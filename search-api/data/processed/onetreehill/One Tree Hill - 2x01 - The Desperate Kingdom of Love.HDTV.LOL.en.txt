He’s your opponent. I can describe Lucas in one word… Bastard. So what if he wins, what does he get? - He gets you. - Lucas. I don’t know what hurts worse; you and Lucas sneaking around behind my back or you lying about it to my face. If I could just get up, walk over to you, and tell you how much I need you. Haley. It’s okay. But that’s just like him. To get you branded with his jersey number right about your ass! He doesn’t even know about it! You have to right to think of him, not today or any other day of his life. How dare you! If you weren’t out helping your little friend Karen and her café, you might have been there for him like I was. I need a doctor! I want you out of this house or so help me god, I will stab you in your sleep. You’re his legal guardian? He’s my son. Where you drinking before you drove Lucas? - Yes. - I want you to leave. Were you serious about wanting to get out of here? I’ve got a way that you can go but you have to leave tomorrow. - I asked you if you had a problem. - Yeah, I do, it’s called you bitch. They handed me the consent forms, he needed surgery. You have a right to be upset but… Thank you. I need to talk to you. Okay. I think I’m pregnant. - I love you Karen. - Keith. Marry me. I thought you weren’t ready. I thought you were going to wait until you got married. We did wait. What’re you talking about Haley? We got married last night. Mom… I want to leave Tree Hill. You killed me, you bitch! Hey you. Hi. I had the strangest dream. I dreamt we actually got married yesterday. That’s weird… I had the same dream. No. Oh, that’s right, - we actually did get married. - We did get married. It’s pretty wild, huh? Yeah. How do you feel? I was just watching you sleep, thinking; - let’s always be like this. - Yeah. And then I turn my cell phone back on. No! no no no no no no. Argh… it’s my mom. She’s been calling like crazy. Do you think she found out about us? No. She probably just wants her car back. Oh. In that case, don’t worry about it. Gimme that. Holy cow! What happened to your head? Yeah. I figured; new town, new look. Okay, whatever you say, Felicity. At least the town looks nice. Yeah, it does. I think we’re going to like it here. Yeah… You know, not many people get a chance you know, just to start over you know? I mean just leave Tree Hill and reinvent themselves. And it all starts today. Yeah… Hello? Hey girl! Doesn’t anyone ring the doorbell in this town? - Some do; I don’t. Let’s go. - And where are we going? It is day two of the Brooke and Peyton ‘Hoes over Bros’ reunion tour. Come on. Come on you fake blonde goldilocks. Let’s go. Bad news? My dad’s in the hospital. He had a heart attack. Oh no. Is he going to be okay? I don’t know, my mom just left it on my voicemail. - I’m sorry Nathan. - Yeah, I gotta go see him. Yeah, I’ll go with you. Ah Nathan… maybe we shouldn’t tell them about us yet. I mean maybe we should just wait until he recovers. They’re going to find out, Haley. I know; it’s just that I saw your dad before the game and he wasn’t happy about us dating… what’s he going to say now? It’s not about him. We’re married now, Haley. I’m never going to hide that. - Brooke, what are you up to? - You’ve been on my dad’s boat before. Yeah, with you and your dad. Details. It’s like driving a car just on water and without a speed limit. Brooke. Peyton… look at us. Look at this day. We are practically a beer commercial. It would be wrong not to take it. So let’s go. Hop on bestest friend. Is it normal for him to be unconscious like this? Well, yes and no. Your husband is sedated from the angioplasty but he suffered major heart failure, he could be unconscious for a while yet. Would it have mattered if I had found him sooner? Well in medicine, earlier is always better… but you called as soon as you could, right? Dan? Dan! Dan! Can you hear me?! Deb? Deb. What?! You better hope I die! You’re threatening me? Here. Dial it yourself. Deb. You know; I came here to apologise. To tell you I was sorry, even though you’ve been the assiest ass on the planet for the better part of our married lives. - What are you doing? - I’m considering, Dan. Please. Help me. Dan? I’m sorry. Keith. Gee, who died? It’s Dan. He had a heart attack. Haley, have you seen my grey t-shirt? I wanna do something, okay? Haley. No, it’s okay. It’s okay. I could love you forever. So could I. You’re my family now, Haley. The true thing I have. I never wanna lose you. You won’t. What? Marry me. - Stop it. - What, would you? - Oh, you’re embarrassing me. - Why not? - Because… we’re in high school. - So what? I’m emancipated. Is this about sex, because I wanna wait? - No, I can see you caving on that one already. - Well maybe so. Nathan, couples don’t get married in high school. It’s just… it’s not normal. So? I’m not normal. What I’m feeling is definitely not normal and to be honest with you Haley, I don’t ever want to be normal. Not with you. I’m serious. I know you are. Okay, so I’ll say it again. I could love you forever. - Nathan, so could I but... - So then why can’t forever start today? Ah, don’t have a view like this in Tree Hill. You wanna talk about Dan? Do you think my mom knows? I don’t know. Think she cares? Do you? You know Luke, Dan’s your birth father and… even though he’s never been in your life it wouldn’t be wrong to be concerned. Would it be wrong to hope he dies? Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a genetic mutation and causes the heart muscles to thicken… eventually; it prevents the heart from pumping blood. But why now? Sometimes cardiac arrest is bought on by excessive physical activity, even excessive stress. I’ve made so many mistakes Deb, with you and with Nathan. I’m willing to change… I’ll do anything. I’ll do everything to keep you in my life. I’m not proud of who I’ve been… but don’t give up on me… because I still love you. Coach Durham? Karen. I always pretend to be asleep when the nurse comes in here. She looks a lot like Death… only uglier. How are you doing? Ah you know, they want to operate… but it’s a long story full of medical mumbo jumbo. Well I’ve got lots of time. I closed the café for the day. Huh… well… I guess your nest is feeling pretty empty huh? I guess so. You ever think, maybe that’s what Lucas wanted? You know, that silence would close in on you and you’d have to go out and make some noise yourself. Well… I was thinking that maybe I’d take some classes over at the University. Well stop thinking about it, damn it, and do it! You know what I’d do if I was your age? Everything… and then by golly, I’d turn around and do it again. I wouldn’t give a rat’s ass who disapproved or what I looked like doing it. Karen… take it from me… when you’re my age, you don’t want to be here… tangled up in that road you never travelled. Make some time. Take a few chances. Listen, do you hear that? Hear what? Silence. It’s nice. Yeah. At least it was until you started talking. So what do you want to do after this? I was thinking; maybe some ice-cream, a little lingerie, facial. It’s okay to miss him Brooke. Miss who? Lucas. I don’t… miss him, really, I mean maybe a little, you know, now that he moved but... whatever, there’s other fish in the sea. We’ll find new boyfriends. It shouldn’t be hard considering you’re you and I’m me. Yeah. His loss. Jake’s too. Wanna know a secret? I was secretly pulling for you and Jake. Even when I was at the top of your ‘Bitch List’? - Even then. You know why? - Why? Coz I wasn’t into him. Boys are so easy. We could swim if we had suits. When’s that ever stopped us? You gonna give me a hand or you gonna live in the truck? Seems like a waste. We’re going back right? Why, you're a heart surgeon? Look Luke… I want Dan to get better too you know I mean I’m really pulling for him but… you know my future’s here now, I can’t just… go back. No I get it. I don’t wanna go back either but… it just doesn’t feel right. Okay. Alright, I’ll tell you what; gimme reasons to stay. Keith. No, I’m serious. Okay? We’ll make a list. Give me one reason why you don’t wanna go back. - Dan. - Ah Dan, see? Dan’s an ass. That’s good. - What else? - I screwed up with Brooke and Peyton. You know, I didn’t even say goodbye. Not so much as saying it, I just wrote it in a letter. - You having fun P. Sawyer? - Hell yes B. Davis, you? Yeah. I’ve been thinking about Lucas. It’s not that he left, it's… kinda how he left. Just can’t believe he didn’t say goodbye. Brooke, there’s something that I need to show you. It was taped to my front door yesterday. This is from Lucas. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have hid it from you. But you did. I’ve been carrying around the fact that he left without a word and you’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me? - I was going to. - When?! After you read it first?! No! I wouldn’t do that, I promise. Whatever Peyton, we should head back. Listen, Haley, if you want, I can do this alone. You don’t have to come in. No, I’m okay. I want to. Oh good. I was hoping you’d say that. Besides we stuck together with my parents. Hey, anybody home? Mom? Dad? - In the kitchen, Haley! - Okay. No matter what happens next, I want you to know… if my parents say yes… I will marry you. Okay. Okay, yeah I would. Mom? - Hey baby. - Hey. Well don’t just stand there; give me a hug. - You must be Nathan, I’m Marion. - Hi. Is my mom here? She’s around here somewhere. Here’s that article, Marion. You know, how someone can actually type with their head up their ass is beyond me. Nathan. Did you climb through Haley’s window again or did you actually locate our front door this time? - Mom. - I came in the front door, Mrs James. Atta boy. You're hungry? Actually ah, can we just talk to you and dad? - Are you pregnant? - What!? - Pregnant, with child, bun in the oven. - Mom! Lydia stop. You know that Haley’s a virgin. - Marion. - And it’s a damn shame if you ask me. Can we just talk to you and dad. Alright, I can take a hint. Besides, your mother’s going to tell me every word of it. Call me with the details, Lydia. Is dad here? Jimmy! Kitchen! Haley’s pregnant! - Shall we sit? - I think we better. Can I help you? I’m his son. Is he going to die? You should talk to your mom. I think she’s in the chapel. Alright, just to recap on the reasons to stay side, we got; Dan’s an ass, you were an ass, my new teaching job, we both get a fresh start, your mother and I laid out my heart and this apartment has a killer view. So what else? Nathan. Oh. Yeah, that marriage thing must have been tough for you. No, I meant for reasons to go back. I was wrong about him. He’s a good guy and… yeah, okay, him and Haley, it’s kinda weird but… I’m glad for them. You know Luke, I’m really proud of you for getting to know Nathan. If you think you should go home… then you should but there are… things in Tree Hill that I’m not sure I can face. Like what? Just… something I’m not proud of. Look… I’m gonna take a little walk. Keith! I’m good, I just... gotta get a little air. - Mom. - Nathan. What happened? I found him in the beach house on the floor. I called 911 but they said I might have called too late. Mom, it’s not your fault. Remember when you were little and you had to have your tonsils out? I came to this chapel that night and sobbed because I had the worst feeling that something was going to go wrong; that I was going to lose you. You didn’t lose me, mom. Yeah, we’re here for you Mrs Scott. Whatever you need. Thank you Haley. I guess I’m not ready to let go. We were… gonna tell you today. Tell me what? I love your son very much, Mrs Scott. Tell me what, Nathan. We got married. I must be losing my mind. Listen mom, we’ll talk about it later. When dad’s well. When dad is well? Your father is unconscious Nathan, plus he may or may not be my husband at this point, who the hell knows and now you’re telling me that you got married? This has got to be a joke. It’s not a joke, mom. - Mrs Scott, we’ve thought about... - Shut up Haley. You did this to your father. You’re the reason he’s here. - Mrs Scott... - I said shut up. Shut your selfish little mouth! Mom! You walked away from him. And you helped him do it. You’re both to blame. Deb, Deb, what’s wrong? What happened? He’s gonna die. Who? Dan. He had a heart attack. Oh my god! Oh my god. He’s gonna die… and it’s all my fault. They got married? - That is not the Haley James that I know. - You mean the Haley Scott. I just, I don’t know whether to laugh or cry or… throw up. I mean Dan’s in the hospital and Nathan is apparently married and Keith… Have you called him? Yeah. Talk about your bad timing. Oh, it’s just... it would be better if he were here. Keith is good in a crisis. How is it possible that they could even get married? Well, well, Haley James in my house between the hours of 8am and midnight. Hi, Mr James. Hello, Nathan. Did you come in through the window? He found the front door. Nice work Nate. So, to what do we owe this surprise? Well, we wanted to talk to you daddy. Daddy? This is gonna be expensive. Okay, look. You guys know that I am an extremely cautious person… and I consider things from every angle and I don’t just, like, jump into things. Like getting to the point of this conversation? Mr and Mrs James… as you know, I’m emancipated from my parents and… I think you also know that I respect both of you very much. I think I know where this is going and here’s the thing Nathan; you see, if we adopt you, the making out with Haley is gonna have to stop. At least in public. Could you guys be serious for like one minute of my life, please? I’d like to marry your daughter. I didn’t see that coming. Dad, mom... I will discuss this with your father. You will? If this is what you want. It is. Brooke, wait up. - You shoulda told me about the letter Peyton. - I know. Then why didn’t you? Why would you hide it from me? Coz we were having fun again. Brooke, having our friendship back has been really, really great. You know I… I figured Lucas is gone so it didn’t matter what was in the letter because it was just gonna come between us. Why would you think that? Remember when we used to get up every Tuesday morning and ride our bikes to the Mall? So you could buy some stupid CD’s. Yeah, and you could buy make-up your mom wouldn’t let you wear. We’d spend half the day in my bedroom just listening to music and putting on awful eye shadow, and that was just the Tuesdays. We used to do a lot of really great stuff until guys got in the way. I was actually just going to the mall with you to check out Roy. Brooke, we were nine. What’s your point? Okay, I am sorry, I should’ve shown you the letter but… considering our history, it scared me so… I just… I just wanted my friend back for a little while. Come on. God! Closed during the day? Oh, I guess my heart just wasn’t in it today. Come on in, Mrs Scott. I’m sorry, I really wish you could have been there but it was so sudden. Yeah. Is Deb here? I figured you must have talked to her. She had to go back to the hospital. She was really upset. Dan’s not doing so well. I know, but I meant with me. - Does that surprise you? - Yeah, little. I could understand if it was Dan but Deb’s always been really supportive of my relationship with Nathan. Yeah, when you were dating. Is that how you feel? Haley, it doesn’t matter how I feel. It matters to me. Haley… I know that you and Nathan are in love and you know that I was also in love in high school but sometimes, love fades… and, I just hope with all my heart that… it doesn’t fade for you. Hello? Hey, man. It’s Lucas. Hey, man. Crazy forty-eight hours huh? Yeah, yeah I guess so. So listen... I know this is weird for us but… - I just wanted to call because... - Oh yeah. Yeah he’s still unconscious but, you know him, he’s just waiting to wake up on his own terms. Well look, I’m here for you okay? For you and Haley both. Just call if you need anything. Thanks Luke. So listen. How did this marriage thing happen anyway? The boy’s emancipated Jimmy. Haley just needs our permission. Need I remind you that up until an hour ago, this boy came and went through a second story window like a horny cat burglar. - How can you even be considering this? - Jimmy, you know our daughter. She has never done an impetuous, hasty thing in her life. Most days, she’s more mature than we are. - They’re in love. - They’re in high school. Besides, if it’s meant to be, it’ll still be meant to be after college. Okay; we forbid her to do it. She hates us. She keeps seeing him, maybe she gets pregnant, she drops out of school, - she turns to a life of prostitution. - Oh stop it. Oh! There she is, smoking crack and sleeping in the gutter. Did you know that my parents forbid me to marry you? Why? Because they thought that we were too young. Well why didn’t you listen? Because I loved you. And in the end we got married all the same and we’ve made quite a life together. But I always loved them less for not seeing what I saw in you. So I’ve been thinking I’m done with boyfriends for a while. Right. Brooke Davis, solo? Relationships are just too hard. Hooking up with boys is so much easier. So I’ve been thinking, I don’t wanna read the letter. I mean you can, I just whatever it says, I don’t wanna know. Are you sure? I mean it’s not gonna change how I feel. About Lucas. Yeah, about him. Or you, or me. I don’t know, aren’t you tired of measuring yourself by what guys think? I just… I need to stop chasing boys and focus on myself more so. I hear ya. Hoes over Bros? I hope it wasn’t money. This hasn’t been going on okay, it just, it just happened. Listen to me, you son of a bitch! Those are the last words you’re ever gonna speak to me. You are no longer my brother. You understand that?! You do not exist to me. Hey Keith? I thought I might find you here. Yeah I was just... standing here, listening to that voice in my head. And what’s it saying? It’s saying if we leave this place today, we may never come back. And what’s the voice in your heart say? Luke, you know that’s not fair. I mean, you know Dan’s... he’s a bad guy. You said it yourself; you hope that he would die. I said that for you. I know how bad you want this. Yeah, yeah I do want this, don’t you? - Yeah, I do but it just... - But what?! Why should we have to give it up?! I mean he was never a father to you, he leaves your mom when she’s pregnant, he rides Nathan until he cracks under the strain. Whitey, Deb, every single life that he touches is worse because of it. And now we’re just supposed to, you know, give it all up in his hour of need. I’m sorry Luke but just give me one single reason… why I should go back. Because he’s your brother. Excuse me. Could you tell me what room Dan Scott is in? I’m sorry, he’s in intensive care. Only immediate family allowed. He’s the father of my son. The tumour is pressing on your brain and affecting your vision. So… in the morning, we wanna go in and remove it. But there are risks involved. Haley. What’s wrong? Um… I was just alphabetising our CD’s and… we don’t have any doubles. Not one. So what? So, ‘Natalie Merchant’ after ‘NOZ’ and ‘Wilco’ before the ‘Wu-Tang Clan’? So you listen to crummy music. I can live with that. We made a mistake Nathan. - Haley... - No. I’m not ready for this. I just... I just really wanna go home to my room. You know, I’m not a wife; I’m not even a senior! Haley. Haley, listen this is not a mistake. How can you be sure because there is nobody that thinks this thing can work. I do. I promise you Haley. I will always be there for you, I will always protect you. Okay? I will always protect you. Always. Someday, this beach might wash away… the oceans may dry… the sun could dim but on that day, I’ll still be loving you. Always and forever. I promise you Haley. And now, Haley, please repeat after me; I Haley, take you Nathan. I Haley, take you Nathan. To have and to hold, from this day forward. To have and to hold, from this day forward. In sickness and in health. For richer or poorer. For better or worse. I promise, that I will love and cherish you... And will deny all those that would come between us. I make this promise for eternity. I promise that I will keep forever… Until the end of time. Till death do us part. Synchro : Amariss
