I'm kind of in love with, and... I couldn't be away from her for another day. I know the label's gonna run a lot smoother with you at the helm. I'm not here to run the label. I'm here to close it. You're mad because I want you to move out, but it's only because I'm trying to step things up with Millie. You trying to get rid of me with your naked ass. It ain't gonna work. You know earlier when... when I said I miss David? What happened, Quinn? You said he... I left him. Does that girl look familiar to you? Yeah, she was at the party today. Why? She says she slept with you on the road, Nate, and she's going public. One tree hiil s07e02 sync by yescool And where will you run... back to the life of a peasant harlot? Perhaps I will. But should I return to a life of more meager means, I will do so with my dignity intact, my heart pure and true. And yet you had no dignity nor purity in my bed a fortnight ago. Meager means, indeed. Harlot! Leave the dress! Millie was right. Alex DuprÃ© is the perfect choice to be the face of the new campaign. She's smart. She's talented. She is crazy beautiful. Julian? I'm shaving! How come this movie never came out? Because smart and talented and beautiful got all hopped up on goofballs and had to be checked into rehab. By the way, those dailies are top secret. I had to call in about a dozen favors to get 'em. Aww, my baby's so good to me. Damn. I am really gonna like this living-together thing. I want you to move your stuff in, okay? This is our house now, not just mine. Good. Well, then how would you feel about going back to our bedroom for a little while? I'd make a joke about meager means, but... it would simply be untrue. Hey. You know I'm not judging you, right? Clay, listen, man, you've known me for a long time now. I don't care what that woman says. I did not sleep with her, all right? All right. It's unbelievable to me that she could just show up and spout a bunch of lies, and the next thing you know, I'm in the headlines, my family's in the headlines, and I'm guilty before I'm innocent. Don't freak out. You're not in the headlines yet. And believe it or not, this kind of thing, it happens a lot. You're a public figure, and they know you make a lot of money. I'm in a contract year, Clay. I know. So, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay in shape, you're gonna stay focused, and you're gonna let me handle it. All right? All right. *yeah* It has been ringing off the hook. *waves crash along* ... Quinn, what happened? I mean, what actually happened between you and David? He just changed, you know? I mean, he used to see the world exactly the way I saw it. He just doesn't anymore. But he still loves you. I know. But I don't know if that's enough. I'm sorry. I got to go. I got to go down to the studio and take care of this whole "shutting us down" mess. Do you need my help? No. You just stay here and enjoy your day. I'll see you later. Okay. It's gonna be okay, Quinn. I love you. I love you, too. *keep your hello* *don't think about it at all* Is it okay? You're good. Damn it, Skills! What up, Millie? You and Marvin need to stop this ridiculous naked standoff! Hey, look, he started it, trying to get me to move out. Okay, look... I'm going to pick up Alex DuprÃ© from the airport. I'm gonna work a full day, and when I get home, you two idiots better have your pants on! So, what are you gonna do? I ain't moving out. That's for sure. Why not? If Chester hopped around without his fur on, I'd probably move out. Yeah, well, it's a long story. So, you ready for the beach? Totally. You think I can bury you and Miss Lauren in the sand? Cool with me. Oh, and, um, don't tell Miss Lauren about the whole moving-out stuff, all right? Why not? Just don't. Wait. Uh-Oh, here she comes. Hey, boys. Ready for the beach? What are you guys up to? Nothing. Nothing. Huh. *that girl's a genius* *whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh* Never believe that you can deceive. You might think that you can get away with it. You might actually get away with it... for a while. But your life is made up of choices and decisions. Hi, Julian. Dad. What are you doing here? I came to talk you out of the worst decision of your life. Poor choices, poor life. Bad decisions... bad life. Come on. Where is it? Page 17, item 4... It's the part of the contract that basically says we can acquire the label whenever we'd like. Wickedness... As you know, I've been there. I'm not alone. My wife was, too. She was deceptive and manipulative. She abused drink and drugs. She was promiscuous. But today she stands beside me a changed woman, a caring woman, a better woman. Ladies and gentlemen, my wife and the love of my life. *my girl's ready to take control* *she just blows my mind* *she only listens to the radio* I love you, honey. I love you, honey. *yeah* ! *she wakes up scared of getting old* I didn't make a bad decision, dad. Is that right? You walked away from a potential blockbuster movie days before production, and for what? For love. Love... with Brooke Davis. Be careful, dad. Julian, she's Brooke Davis! I read the tabloids. This is a fling for her, and it could cost you your career! I think you need to leave. *behind the tv screen I've fallen to my knees* Your career was one movie away from being prestigious... This movie. And you walk away. For what? A promiscuous fashion designer. *I need to get away* *blanket of silence* *makes me want to sink my teeth in deep* *burn all the evidence* Oh, this glass is gonna look amazing in my loft in Los Angeles. All right, Miranda, I know that you have a legal right to shut down the label, but you don't have to be a total bitch about it. You're the producer, Haley, and, potentially, a great artist, but you don't have time to record because you're running what is essentially a vanity label. Va...  vanity la... You guys would not have Mia Catalano if it wasn't for this label. You wouldn't have had the time or patience or interest to develop an artist like her. That's what small labels do. We develop and nurture artists. It's something corporate labels will never do. I've always wanted a pool table. I can't believe your dad just came all this way to tell you he thinks you're making a mistake. He couldn't call or text or tweet that to you? He's a movie producer, Brooke. He loves the dramatic. Well, what else did he say? He wanted to know what my game plan was... was I still actively producing, do I have a development staff finding me new properties, and... That is some poster. What? Oh, right. You like it? Yeah. It's... different for the living room. He was just so crazy, my father. Do you think maybe you would like that better in the spare bedroom or in your office? We could get you an office for that. Look, my dad just flew five hours to ask me if I'm quitting the business and getting married. What did you say? I asked him to leave. No, about the "marriage" part. I told him he was crazy. We're not getting married. We just moved in together. I... I don't... I don't know what the hell got into him. *I ain't got no other place to hide* *chained down like a sitting duck* *just waiting for the fall* Hey, you. The clock... it was a good idea. I think it reminds people that every second counts. It's easy. People don't have to work that hard to get it. We have that dinner tonight with the investment guys from Texas. I think you should tell them the whole "phoenix rising from the ashes" story. They'll love it. It was a good show today. I think we might have reached some people. Do you think it was a good show? I'll let you know after I see the ratings. I got to go. Hey. I love you. I know, baby. Wear your gray suit tonight. You always look good in that suit. Guys. Right here! Right here! Hey. There you go. One more. Miss DuprÃ©? Miss duprÃ©? Could I get an autograph? Oh, yeah, sure, you pretty thing. What's your name? Tanya. Tanya? I loved you in "Heart so true". You were so brave in that. Oh, thank you, sweetie. But that's just acting. You're the brave one. Thanks. Bye. Bye bye. Alex, Millicent Huxtable, Clothes Over Bros. Welcome to Tree Hill. Thank you. Can I just say that I am your biggest fan? And it's because of things like that... that you would take the time to inspire that poor girl in the wheelchair after such a long flight. They kind of creep me out. What? Cripples and, like, retarded people. They're always, like, drooling and smiling really weird. It's so gross. Water, water, water. Um, is there any wine in here? Um, I thought you were sober. You just went to rehab. Ugh, do not remind me. They took my phone away. Besides, wine's not even alcohol. It's like grape. Ugh, it's so hot out there. Where the hell are we? It's like the devil's ass in this place. When do I get paid? I think your agent takes care of that. Can I just tell you... I hate that woman. She's like a complete alcoholic, and her fingers look like chicken feet. Btw, I am starving. Is there any food? Well, I read that you only eat organic food, so we have an entire organic feast waiting at the hotel. Yeah, I just make that stuff up. Can you drive through a Mickey d's? I could totally eat the butt off a skunk right now. Um, drive on... please. Nate, it's gonna be okay. You know, we haven't heard from this woman since the one e-mail. So, until it's real, it's not real. You know, and besides, who the hell would want to sleep with you, anyway? Okay, I know it's bad timing, but damn. Dude, quit checking out my sister-in-law. Hey, dumb and dumber. Hey. Nice day, huh? I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's nothing. Actually, uh... now it is something. My hat! I'll get it. Ohh. Can you move? Not a muscle. Me neither. Man, I hope that knucklehead come back. So, listen, Peyton, here's the thing... Uh, you know how I... insisted that you keep that 1% of the label? Well, it... it kind of killed the label. But, Haley... Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I can see that I'm upsetting you, and I don't want to do that. So, um, let me just, uh... Talk to Lucas. Geez, Haley, I... I... I... I... I don't know, you know? This has really meant a lot to... peyton. I know. I know. I'm a terrible friend, and there's nothing that I can do unless I... You might be a genius, Haley. Thank you, Haley. * am I * * am I losing my mind? * Jamie? Aunt Quinn! Hey! Who let you off your leash? Uncle Skills, but he didn't bring the leash today. Okay, where is he? He's over there. Miss Lauren, too. This is her hat. Cool. Well, I was just on my way to go get a snack. Can I tempt you? Sure. Yeah? You should probably tell them you're with me. Denzel, this is Macaulay. Denzel, this is Macaulay. I'm going for a snack with my aunt Quinn. Over. Okay, all set. Stupid, crazy nanny. Hop on. Whoop! There we go. What do you want? Hey, give me a sec, okay? Okay. Mind if I join you? Spare a few bucks? First... you mind telling me how you got here? You must be one of them religious guys or something. No. I got nothing against religion. If you ask me, the one man you got to believe in... is you. I stopped believing in me a long time ago. Why? You made some mistakes? You failed sometimes? Listen. No matter what mistakes or failures you had, they weren't even close to mine. There's a book you should read. You talking about the bible. No, man, it's not the bible. It's this book. Listen. There's a used-book shop around the corner. Now, you can take this book, sell it for a few bucks, buy yourself a bottle, and feel good for a few minutes. Or you could read it and feel better for the rest of your life. Hey. What your name is, man? My name is Dan Scott. And I believe in you. He probably didn't mean it. It was just the way he said it, as if the very idea of us ever getting married was somehow completely ridiculous to him. And then he hung this ugly army-man poster in the living room. I have to talk to him. Okay, but he might freak out a little if you start talking marriage so soon. No, about the poster, you dork. It has to go. I am really excited to meet Alex, though. How is she? Um... she's really... something. She just wanted to freshen up. You're gonna love her. She's gonna hate you! Go away, you witch. "Witch"? "Witch"?! Look, missy, my ass is on the line here! You mean your big ass. Really? Really? Get up! I'm tired! Well, you better get un-tired because you're going over to Clothes Over Bros, and you're gonna convince Brooke Davis that the half-million dollars she's paying you is not a waste! Half a million dollars? So, you want to talk? Talk. What, no "hello"? No introductions? Your name's Renee. I recognize you from the picture you took when you trespassed at a 7-Year-Old's birthday party. You have a last name? You're kind of hot when you're all fired up. I know he didn't do it. I don't know what your angle is, and I don't know why you targeted Nathan Scott, but what I do know is that he didn't do it. You're quite the party boy, aren't you? I'm single. He's not. Oh, like that matters. Maybe not to girls like you, but to Nathan it does. "Girls like me." You know what's so great about justice? It doesn't discriminate against "girls like me." What do you want from me? Whoa, walk away, Nate. Huh? Hi, Nathan. You need to stop this. Outside. You need to stop this now, okay? Do you hear me? Why are you doing this to me? Come on. What the hell is wrong with you? I just wanted to talk to her. In public? In front of a roomful of people with camera phones and video, you wanted to talk with her, just thought you'd have a little chat? I'm sorry. I screwed up. Yeah, you screwed up, Nate! What does she want? I don't know. I was about to find out until Nathan Scott stormed in like a madman! Look, I said I was sorry, jackass. Let it go. I'm gonna see if she'll sit down with me again. In the meantime, you just, um... Try not to get thrown through a window, all right? Damn it, nate. Brooke? Please don't fire me. Please don't fire me. Shut up. I'm an actress. I got this. Alex, hi, I'm Brooke Davis. It's so nice to meet you. Oh... my... God. You are so beautiful. Thank you. Can I just say that I'm so happy to be here? And I think it's so great that you make designer clothes for plus-sized girls. I never knew it was based on you, but I think that's so sweet. Uh, no, I'm normal-sized. Oh, I know, but I have the best diet for you. You're so gonna lose that weight. Okay. How was your flight? You flew private, right? Uh-Huh. They let me ride in the cockpit. It was so rad. In the cockpit? Totally. They let me steer the plane and everything. They let you fly the plane. I know! I'm so a cockpit girl. That's what she said. Who? Who what? You... you said she said something, but I don't know who you mean. No, it's... it's an expression. When someone says something that sounds sexual, you say, "that's what she said". Oh. Right. Okay. Why don't we show Alex the new line? Great. You're gonna love it. It's kind of elegant and kind of edgy, and the pieces are a lot like this one. No, I don't like that. Why? Uh, first of all, it's purple. When I was a little girl, there was this dinosaur thing, and it totally freaked me out, and it was purple. You mean Barney? Yeah. That's what she said. Okay. That's totally wrong, but... I know. I'm so funny, huh? My best friend, Kimmy, told me I should totally do more comedy. She says most people are really uptight, but I'm not tight at all. That's what she said. Who? Oh, Kimmy? Yeah, she said that. She said I'm so much funnier than Cameron Diaz. I mean, plus, have you seen my ass? Come on. Way better than hers. Like way. Could you excuse us for just... One minute? Sure. I have to pee, anyway. Great. Second door on the left. Okay. I'll just clean out my things and go. Remember that time I stayed with you and uncle David for a whole week? Yep, and we made pancakes every morning with chocolate sauce and whipped cream? Maybe if David comes, we could do that again. Yeah. Maybe. Hey, are you sure Skills and lauren won't be worried about you? Oh, man! At least I got your hat. So, can I talk to you? Would you like to speak with me or talk to me? Oh, brother, you are a piece of work. So, you're excited about my record, right? John Knight's excited about my record, which is why you guys want to close Red Bedroom... to free me up to record? In part, yes. If you close Red Bedroom, I'm not gonna make an album. Haley, you need to remove the emotion from this. It's a business decision. It's not personal. It is personal. Everything about this label is personal... why Peyton started it, why she made me her partner... It's as personal as it gets. If you don't record with us, you don't record at all. We have a contract with you. We own you. But you don't own me. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mia. I've seen you perform a few times, but we've never been formally introduced. Miranda Stone. Haley's told me a lot about you. Red Bedroom records will always be important to us, but at the moment... can we just cut to the chase? How is Chase? He's good. He says hi. Thanks. Aww, I was there at your first date. Oh, I know. You and Nathan were so great. I sold more records than any artist on our roster last year. But if this label goes away, so do I. How so? You distribute my records, but I record for Red Bedroom, exclusively. Peyton made sure of that. It's true. I checked. Wow. Everyone has their price. No, actually, not everyone. Peyton and Haley are responsible for my career, and you can't put a price on that. And even if you do, I won't accept it. So, congratulations. You're about to lose your biggest-selling artist. Does that pretty much do it, Hales? Yes. Thank you. So good to see you. Oh, good to see you, too. You look so cute. Thanks. I'll let you two talk. Yeah? Who's the bitch now, bitch? I'm so sorry. I should have met with her first. I thought she was the girl from her movies. It's okay. I thought so, too. She has been in that bathroom a really long time. What are we gonna do? I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We are not gonna pay that dum-dum $500,000. We'll just have to... tell her something. We'll say the company went bankrupt or... Or maybe... we should just start speaking Spanish and she'll get really confused and she'll just leave. I don't think that's gonna work. It might. She is really dumb. Brooke? Buenos dias. Tenido mucha cerveza. Ay, mucha cerveza. It's okay. I, uh... I know I'm not what you expected. You don't have to pay me. It's just... that's one of my designs. Since rehab, this dress is all I have. When I felt like I was nothing, it gave me strength and dignity. So, no matter what happens to me or where my life takes me, I'll wear this dress... your dress... and I'll be fine. It's okay. Of course we will pay you. I... I think you look beautiful in that dress, and I think you're gonna be perfect as the face of the line. Really? That is so rad! Oh! Yay! Hey. Look at this. It's all over the internet. The buzz is really positive. I didn't really have "buzz" in mind. I know, but that's why you have me. *I'm here if you need me* *oh, this way* ... Well, hi. What are you doing? Fixing you dinner, and thinking about getting rid of my poster. Why? Because you have to eat and because... You hate it. I don't hate it. Yeah. No, I don't. I just... I don't really like it there. It's okay. My father, as you know, was always gone, always on some distant location or at the office, you know, making movies. But this one time, he came home and surprised me and took me to see "the thin red line". And then we spent the rest of the day together, just him and me. And that didn't happen very often. Actually, that really never happened again. But that day... that was a good day. That was probably the best day I ever had with him. And that was the day I decided I wanted to make movies, too, like my dad. *let it disappear into my hand* *whoa, yeah, my hand* I appreciate you meeting me. Oh, so now you appreciate me. What happened to confrontational clay? I'm confrontational because I'm protective over Nathan, and because, of all my clients, he's the last one I'd expect to be in this situation. And what situation is that? You tell me. Ask me what's in the envelope. I'm not here to play games. The night Nathan scored 35 points against Memphis, you threw a big party for him after the game. I should know. I was there. It got... pretty wild. Get to the point. The pictures of what happened between me and Nathan that night are in the envelope. Whatever's in that envelope is meaningless or fabricated, because we both know that whatever you're accusing him of doing, he didn't do. Maybe you should take a look. I spoke with john knight. He thinks mia's bluffing, and he still wants to fold the label. But I recommended we don't. Why? Because integrity and loyalty still matter. Does that surprise you... that I actually have a heart? A little. And besides, I don't think she's bluffing, and she makes us a lot of money. If I do this... if... Your album needs to be finished in the next six months. Hmm. Why did Peyton start this label, anyway? You said it was personal. She thought that major labels were soulless. We are. Don't forget it. *we just don't see it the same way* *but you're never sure* *we can't go on like this anymore* It's open. Brooke. You wanted to speak with me? You know, my whole life, I wanted to get my mother to be proud of me. And then one night, Julian threatened to exile her from our lives, and I would do the same to you. I'm just not sure it would matter. You're upset. I have this poster hanging in my living room, Paul. Of course I'm upset. And the only reason that it's hanging there is because you took him to see that movie, and for one day that boy felt close to his father. He felt loved and appreciated. And the sad part is that there was only one of those days. Because in my book, the day that he didn't feel that way should be the unique one. Fix it. *the hardest thing about this is I still care* *you know there's something better* *for both of us out there* Hey. Hey. ' *cause you wait for rain* How'd it go at the label? Um... I think I fixed it temporarily. Now I got to fix my sister. Did you talk to David? There's not that much to talk about. We grew apart. You know, we stopped laughing as much, stopped caring as much. Did something happen recently? One night in New York I went to go see "Spring awakening" with some friends. And after we took the subway to this ridiculous open-mike night in Brooklyn. And we watched these horrible performers who, for whatever reason, had to get onstage and be seen and heard. And as I'm watching them, I'm thinking that I understand them. You know, they... they were messy and... and unsure and maybe a little confused, but... but they were doing what they needed to do, you know, what their hearts needed them to do. And then David called my cellphone, and I didn't want to answer. You know, there was a time when he would have been sitting right there, and... and I would have loved that. But he hasn't been that guy in a while. You guys were great together, you know. I mean, you... you were really happy. And then one day we weren't. And I know there's supposed to be some big, huge, important reason why, but there's not. It's just a feeling that I have that this isn't what I want for the rest of my life. People have a right to change, Quinn. Yeah, but they also have a right to stay the same. They have a right to be exactly the person that they've always been. Okay? I didn't change, Haley. David changed. And now somehow I'm the one who's broken because of it. *wait for rain* *and I chase the stars* *we just don't see* ... So, tell me what the worst act was that you saw that open-mike night. Come on. There was this really angry guy who sang "Cat's in the cradle". Yeah, I swear he was a serial killer. When he got done, everyone clapped, and he, like, sneered at the people who didn't. I guarantee you they're missing right now. *I chase the stars* I miss you, Haley-Bob. I miss you, too. *bring on the wrecking ball* You're not broken. Thanks. I hope not. Hi, son. I was just... heading back to L.A. and I wanted to... say goodbye. Okay. Listen... I came here to tell you that I think you're wrong to put your relationship before your career, but... ... I think it's me who's been wrong. I wasn't around enough. And... I was too busy caring for fictional characters instead of caring for the real ones in my life. You did fine, dad. *there's just too much, my, my* That poster... that was a good day for us? The best. *my heart's as cold as ice* I don't remember it. I'm sorry. It's okay. No, it's not. I'm proud of you, son. You go live your life and... Be happy. And whatever you do, don't be like me, okay? I'll see you. *the word that I breathe is a word that I need* *and the songs that I sing don't mean anything* *don't you wonder* *why it's always been this way* ? *all our innocence is gone* What'd she say? That night after your big game against Memphis, we had that party. We got pretty wasted that night. Yeah. So? Well, that was three months ago. *if you like, I'll take the blame* *for all the things that you have done* She's three months pregnant, nate. *my songs* *on a cold night* *I can't get you out* ... And where will you run... back to the life of a peasant harlot? Perhaps I will. But should I return to a life of more meager means, I will do so with my dignity intact... She's good in this. You were right. ... my heart pure and true. What? I love you. You know that? I love who you are. I don't know how you got there, but I'm glad you did. I'm glad I did, too, 'cause you're here with me. Meager means, indeed. Mmm. Come here. Harlot! Leave the dress! This dress is all I have. When I felt like I was nothing, It gave me strength and dignity. So, no matter what happens to me Or where my life takes me, I'll wear this dress, and I'll be fine. I read your book. Did it help? It did when I sold it. How you doing? Better now. I had such a crummy day. Yeah? Uh-Huh. Well, I think it's about to get worse. Why? I have something I need to tell you. *my love*
