My mom ever asks… I got the test and I’m fine. If that’s what you want. Yesterday Dan… told me that you slept with Keith. Is it true? No, of course not. I spent the whole night waiting for you! All while you were with Chris! - Can we leave him out of this please?! - Why? Are you into him? Just because people say something, doesn’t make it true Felix. Those were rumours! Yeah? Well how do you think rumours get started? It’s okay. I already flushed it down the toilet. I’ve only done it that one time. You don’t get to have me, not my body and sure as hell not my heart. We’re done. We should do this more often. Do what? Be friends. Nathanial Hawthorne once wrote: No man… for any considerable period… can wear one face to himself… and another to the multitude… without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true. Haley! Hey. I’m sorry to bother you so early… Nathan and I had a fight last night and he didn’t come home and... I talked to him. He’s okay. Oh well, do you know where he is? - No. - Okay, well… The next time you talk to him, can you… ask him to come home please? Okay, I will. Alright, well look, don’t worry yourself, okay Hales? I’m sure he’s fine. Alright? Okay. Bye. Thanks for covering for me man. You’re welcome but it sucked. I don’t wanna lie to Haley. You just did. Why don’t you go home? Work it out. It… didn’t sound like Haley was going to school anyway. Yeah, why would they have the Formal on a Sunday? I dunno; to keep the students from partying, getting wasted. Arguing with their wives. Yeah, well it didn’t work. How’d it go with Anna anyway? Well lets just say we didn’t exactly end the night together. Who’d you end up with? Only in Tree Hill. Ew, you two realise you’re related, right? Hi Brooke. Double ew if Tutor Wife is here. She’s not. What’s up? Um… my car is now out of commission, thanks to my jealous, spiteful stain of a neighbour… and I was sort of thinking… that… you might wanna walk to school together. Unless of course, you’re waiting for your ‘Boytoy’ here. Go ahead. I’ll catch up with you guys later. Alright. Go home Nate. Work it out. Well, well. Angel of the morning. Okay, look. I wasn’t with Lucas so just… chill out. Where were you Anna? I stayed at Peyton’s. Ah, that’s great. Mom and dad will love that! Then don’t tell them. Just let me know when I need to start packing again. New digs for your return, hey Danny? No, new digs for your return. You did a hell of a job while I was away Keith. What do you say? - Who do you think did it? - Felix. We kind of… stopped benefiting. I’m glad! I mean, not about the… windshield thing but… about the rest of it. Why, because you don’t like him? No… because you’re better than that. I miss this, you know. Talking to you. What happened to you? I’m not talking to you. Okay. Well if it makes you feel any better… Brooke dumped me. You told her didn’t you? About the dollhouse and TRIC. Thought she should know the truth. Whatever, I deserved it. It’s a rule of life Mouth; whatever crap you pull… always catches up to you. It’s a part of the game. It’s not a game, Felix. Come on Mouth. It took her less than and hour to crush me and hook up with Lucas. Lucas wouldn’t do that. He’s with Anna. Really? It’s okay to freak out, Mouth. I did last night. Hi. Sorry. I was… I was wrong last night and… I found your letter from the camp and I want you to go. It’s not about the camp, Haley. It’s about trust. I want you to stop working with Chris. - He’s incredibly talented, Nathan. - I want you to stop seeing him. I won’t do that. Hey. Wanna hear about my window? Somebody bashed in my car windshield last night. You believe that? I mean, could things get any worse? You wanna ask me that again? - What’s this? - An estimate for my windshield. - And you think I did it? - I know you did. I didn’t break you window baby… just your heart. Please. With men like that in the world, it’s a wonder we’re not gay! See the way everybody’s looking at me? Nobody’s taking this seriously. Really? Because half the girls in P.E. wouldn’t change in front of me. It’s ‘cause you look better than they do, naked. Do you have any idea who did it? Well… if you ask me, they did you a favour; boys love lesbians. Come on. The old P. Sawyer woulda just rolled with this. Yeah, well I haven’t been the old P. Sawyer in a while, have I? Hey, your real friends are here for you. Unbelievable. Okay, you know what, I’m gonna get outta here. Do you wanna come with me? Yeah… but… I have a quiz next period and if I miss it – Nah it’s… it’s cool. I’ll see ya later. Okay. What’s up? Looking for your wife? You’re funny. You’re also done messing with Haley. - We’re just rehearsing, man. - No, you were rehearsing. That’s over now. Why? Can’t you trust her? I mean, isn’t that what this is about? You love her… you married her… but can you trust her? Cos if you can, you got nothing to worry about right? Come on, man, I don’t have a problem with you. You see, you do have a problem with me; a big problem. You could smile and act cool if you want to but the fact is, man: I used to destroy guys like you. Daily. It’d be a shame if something happened to this hand; you couldn’t play that little guitar anymore huh? Just like it’d be a shame if you were taking advantage of Haley. Don’t cry, rock star, ruin your make-up. Pick up. Pick up. You’ve reached Sawyer dredging. If you’d like to leave a message for Larry Sawyer, please do so after – Hey. Hey. So… I saw you cut out of lunch today. Just… wanted to know how you were doing. Been better. Hey. Come here. Sit down. So do you know who wrote it? On your locker. No. I don’t even wanna know. I just want it to all… go away. Just… all of it. You miss Jake, huh? You should go. - Peyton. - No– Okay. You can’t just walk in here and ask me something like that! When is the last time we even had a conversation about something real? I just thought you could use a friend. Yeah, I could use a friend, you know but you don’t qualify as that anymore, Lucas, because a real friend would know about all the crap I’ve been dealing with lately. Like what? Just go. Please. Okay. I’ll go. Whatever you think… I really do care about you, Peyton. You sneaking away without saying goodbye? Oh, actually I was… I was thinking about staying. Dan offered me a management position at the dealership. Did you say no to Charleston? Well, not yet but… I might. You know I care about you, Keith. Yeah. Then listen to me. I know how much teaching in Charleston means to you. I’ve seen you light up when you talk about it. Not as much as I light up when I talk about you. One of the reasons I fell for you was your independence. You made your own way in the world. You brother’s business is his. Charleston is yours. Don’t let him take that from you. - Can I give you a piece of advice? - Nice to see you too. Next time you wanna lie about something, you might wanna make sure your mom is in on it. She told me about Nathan sleeping here last night. Haley, Nathan just needed some time. If you were here, I’d have done the same thing. Lucas Eugene Scott! - Oo, that sounds bad. - Eugene? - Why would you lie to me? - Yeah, get in line. - Mom, what are you talking about? - Dan’s heart condition. Is it genetic? - Yes. - Why didn’t you tell me? - What kind of doctor doesn’t call me?! - Mom, I told him you were in Florence. Why?! When there’s a fifty percent chance you have a genetic heart defect! - Nathan- - No, he’s… fine. He doesn’t have it. He took the test. But you didn’t? - Who told you? - You are taking that test. - No! I’m not. - Are you out of your mind?! How can you be so reckless and cavalier about a potentially fatal condition? I’m gonna go home. You’re gonna give me the name of the doctor that you’ve spoken with and you’re packing a bag because I’m driving you to that test. No, I'm not taking the test. I don't wanna know! - Why not?! - For lots of reasons. Basketball... the way I wanna live my life. Lucas, basketball is a game! Now I am glad that you have a talent but do you really think that I will put a game before your life? - I would. - Oh, grow up! That tragic hero crap only works in the movies and you know what they don't show you after they fade out? The hero’s mother putting her foot up his ass! Mom, you can threaten me all you want but you can’t make me take that test. I sure as hell can! You think about that! Until you come to your senses, your basketball days are over. Mom! You need parental permission to play and you just lost yours. Hey guys! Let’s jump. How bout a little two-on-two? Come on. Luke, I don’t know much man but I do know one thing; you damn sure aint touching no ball round here. - Alright, what’s going on? - Your mom told us bout your heart. - She said you’d be in danger if you played. - Yeah, we’d be in danger if we let you play. She was scary Luke. Look guys, I’m fine. It might be true… but we’ll let your mom tell us that for sure. Let’s go. What going on with you? I heard about you heart test. I’m fine. Are you sure? I’m not gonna see Chris anymore. I don’t want it to come between us. I just-I don’t want anything to come between us. Lucas. You told my mom about the heart test. Well I’m glad she knows. If it forces you to reconsider. You promised me. Lucas! What did you see when you died? After the accident; when your heart stopped. What’d you see? Because when my heart failed, I saw you. Your mother can’t bear to lose you, Lucas. Neither can I. I… I rang the doorbell. I know. I just didn’t wanna answer. I’m sorry I blew you off at lunch today. You know, it’s really starting to be a pattern; you showing up in my room to apologise to me. You’re right. But… At my last school… there were some rumours about me. About a relationship I was having... with another girl. I tried to ignore it but the stories just… kept getting worse. Until, finally, my parents decided to move us here. And that’s why Felix is so protective of me. He was really happy in our last town. Okay, but I thought you said they were just… rumours. It doesn’t matter. You know how high school is. Once a story gets out, it… might as well be true. So when I saw your locker, and the way that people were looking at you, I guess… it scared me. It was… a horrible time for me, Peyton. What are you gonna do? I don’t know. You could always just… let it go. I mean, you’re not gay. Right? Come here. Read that. First they put away the dealers… then they put away the prostitutes… then they shoot away the bums… and… beat and bash the queers… Turned away asylum seekers, fed us suspicions and fears, we didn’t raise our voice, we didn’t make a fuss… - it’s funny, there was no one left to notice- - when they came for us. Anna, it’s not about who I am, okay? It’s about who they are, they are people who hate and they divide and the feed off of people that don’t fight back. Yeah, I… I could laugh this off. But… what about the girl that can’t? Who’s gonna help her? Silence only makes them stronger. Hey, Haley. You here to see Chris? Oh, sorry. Um… You know what, I’ll… I’ll catch him later. It’s okay. Keith? Hey. I… I accepted Dan’s offer. You know, Charleston was always about… hope for me, Jules; a place where maybe I could… find something special. But I found that right here. With you. You’ve given me that hope. You are the best. What do I owe you? Nothing. I called in a couple of favours. Are you serious? Thank you. - Hi Brooke! - Hi. Hey. You ready? Yeah. Okay. Bye. Um… so… I guess I’ll… see you at school. Yeah. Hey, Luke! Can I talk to you? I heard that you fixed Brooke’s windshield. Yeah, you know, she needed some help. Well I wanna pay for it. I took some money out of the bank. - Mouth, you don’t have to do that, alright? - Please! I want to. - Mouth... - I’m the one who did it. I broke her windshield. Miss Sawyer, you know we have a policy regarding wardrobe that’s offensive or profane. Does that policy extend to lockers, cos you haven’t removed that yet have you? You know the drill; go to the office and change or be sent home. Okay, Mr Turner, have you ever heard of Victor Hara? No? Um… he was this musician, right, and he fought in justice with his songs and when they broke his hands and when they taunted him, he just sang even louder. Look, Peyton, oppression’s not exactly a mystery to me, okay? - I feel your pain. - No… no you don’t. Okay, I’m sorry, but you don’t know anything about my pain. Maybe so but there are counsellors you can talk to. Literature you can read. Okay, I’m not gay! Mr Turner. But you know what; if I was I wouldn’t let other people tear me down because of it and I sure as hell wouldn't be looking for my answers in-in one of your pamphlets! Policy is clear Peyton. Remove the shirt or be suspended. Fine. Can you hear my song now, Mr Turner? Enjoy your suspension Miss Sawyer. You probably think I’m an idiot. Actually, I’m kinda hoping you have an evil twin. Look, vandalising Brooke’s car… Mouth, that’s just not you. I guess that’s why I did it. Girls see me as their little brother. They always tell me how nice I am. Well that’s cos you are nice! That’s why you have so many friends, Mouth. And no girlfriend. Haley fell for Nathan when he was a jerk. Brooke went for Felix. Luke, you’ve screwed up a lot this year and you’ve had a different girl every week. Sorry. I just… I try to be honest with Brooke. I told her the truth and then she left with Felix anyway. Yeah, to end things with him. But I didn’t know that at the time. All I knew was that I was at another party where… everybody had someone, but me. Then I… kinda got drunk. You were drinking? Sort of. I had… one drink. But it was a big one. Next thing I knew, I was at Brooke’s house. Wait, you drove to Brooke’s house… wasted? I rode my bike. I… fell a couple of times. In the morning, I felt terrible about what I did and even worse when I found out you fixed it. You know she thinks Felix did it. I know… and I’m gonna tell her the truth. You know, I like Brooke a lot. I guess I have for a long time. But it was okay when you guys were together. I guess I always thought your hearts were the same. Hey! Hang on a second! What is this!? - That should cover your window. - Then you did do it. No. I didn’t. - Who’s the ho? - She not a ho. Her name’s Kayla and she was my last girlfriend. We dated for two years. I was never happier. Then, one day… she passed me a note… and that was it. I don’t believe you. Cos you said you only do ‘Friends with Benefits’. I have, since then. See, I was just like you Brooke. Doing ‘Friends with Benefits’ because I was afraid of getting my heart broken again. But I guess it doesn’t matter. So what, I’m supposed to believe you didn’t break my windshield but you’re paying for it anyway? You don’t have to believe it. Any of it. But it’s true. What’s with them? Oh, huh, Dan told my mom about the HCM test. I guess that’s my bad for trusting him to keep a secret right? He didn’t tell her. I did. I told her. Why? Because I knew that if she found out, she’d make you take the test. She’s not gonna make me take the test and that sucks that you told her! After I covered for you with Haley! About where I crashed for a night, not about my life. You know what, whatever. You promised me. Guess Dan’s not the only one I can’t trust. Hey, yo, Luke. He’s right, man. I mean you’re wrong not to take that test, dawg. Come on man, it’s not fair to us or your mom. Unbelievable. You know what, Skills, why don’t you just run with Nathan from now on. How bout you take the test and we all run together? - Hey. - Hey! Um… I was gonna call you… in a while. Um… I’m sorry to just drop by. I just need somebody to talk to. Stop! I just-I need you, Brooke. I just… there’s so much stuff piling up and I don’t think I can handle it anymore. Okay. Well what’s going on? Talk to me, I mean… you said you’re not feeling like yourself but what’s wrong? Just everything! You know, like Karen is really counting on me at the club and I don’t even have a band! You know, and I’m suspended and that’s gonna look great on my transcripts and... and I miss Jake and… Jenny… and my mom. Hey. It’s gonna be okay. I should be stronger than this, you know, I should and I don’t wanna be a person that… that needs help but I… I feel all alone. You are not alone. Okay, you have me no matter what. Come here. Oh, I’m just glad you’re not seeing Felix anymore, I missed you. Um… yeah, I... Oh. Hey. - Oh god, um… - No, no. - No, I’m sorry to interrupt. - No, Peyton. Don’t go. - It’s cool, I’ll call you later. - No! Peyton! I’ll let you know When it comes When it comes I’ll let you know But don’t stay up for me, no Don’t wait up for me - Hey. - Hey. Sounds good. Thanks. It’s getting there, you know. Uh, listen. I… I hope you know how much I appreciate everything that you’ve done for me. Um… but I don’t… really think we should work together… anymore. So it got to you? Nathan. No, I just, I think it’s for the best. You know? Well… it’s just as well. You know those… labels from New York? They offered me a… showcase. I think I’m gonna take it. Wow, that’s great Chris. Yeah. I’m leaving tonight, so I won’t be able to… play the show at TRIC anyway. So… I guess this is goodbye. Thanks. Wait, Haley, come here. What are you doing? Haley. Is that what this was all about; you just hitting on me? - Haley, it’s okay. - No, it’s not okay. I can’t believe- you just did that. Come with me to New York. What!? In case you missed something: I’m married. So you made a mistake. Are you gonna let that keep you from the rest of your life, Haley? - I did not make a mistake! - Haley, you owe it to your music. You owe it to yourself. Your dreams are a bus ride away. I know you want this Haley. No, you’re wrong, I don’t. I don’t want it; I don’t want any of it. It was always there between us, Haley. Whether you admit it or not. You cancelling your club night? Yeah. Because of the rumours? Because I can’t sing and dance. You know what, I’d really rather be alone right now. Okay. But… I just wanted to tell you how inspired I was when I saw you at school today. You know what, Anna, that’s great! You were inspired, but when I needed you to stand by me, you blew me off! So I don’t need you here now! Hey, Rick, it’s uh… Peyton. Hey man, come on in. Is this my apology? No, this is Haley’s apology. I don’t owe you one. You know why? Because nobody wants to lose you, Luke; not your mom, not Keith… not Haley, not me. There’s nothing wrong with my heart, Nate. Yeah? That’s what you said after you car accident. You told me you didn’t wanna be afraid to live your life. - That’s right. - Well I don’t buy it, Luke. I think there’s something in your heart you’re running from. Okay, what are you: psychic? You can make jokes about it all you want but you know there’s a girl you had feelings for. - Nathan- - Look me in the eye. Tell me I’m wrong. See? Now you can be mad at me all you want; you can say your heart’s fine… but till you tell this girl how you feel… your heart’s gonna be flawed. You need to talk to her Luke. Peyton, it’s me. Will you call me back; I’m worried about you, okay? She’ll be okay. You can go. Do I have to? - Felix! - Brooke. Come on! Can I just say what I tried to say at the Formal? - I really wish you- - I wanna be with you. Wouldn’t. I know it was wrong to lie to you about taking you home after TRIC but when you looked at me the way you did, it felt so good to be looked at like that again. Like you saw the real me. And you liked what you saw. You can’t do this to me. I can’t not do it… because I’m tired of hiding from it. I just want you to know... I never once took you for granted. Not for a second. Deb. Come in. I lied to you. I slept with Keith. Hey Jules, its Keith. Um… I’m sorry to leave this on your machine but… I just realised something and I had to say it; I love you. Call me. Nice work, Jules. Just like we planned. Hey. I’m sorry about this. I… I just… I had to see you. Lucas, what’s wrong? You know how much I care about you, Anna? Because I do. But there’s somebody else. And she’s a part of my history that… came before you… and I’ve been lying to myself about the way I feel about her… and I need to see her tonight. Cos I feel like she’s slipping away. I’m sorry… Anna. Looking for me? High school girls. Relax. Is this what you’re after? Got some cash for me? You know this guy? Jake. I knew you’d come. I… I was on my way home to Nathan and I just… ended up here. Number 42 now departing for New York City; gate 5. You ready? Brooke, talk to me. Just… just tell me how you feel. I know it’s scary… and I know you had a tough time with Lucas… but just tell me if you can show me your heart. Because if you do, I’ll guard it with my life. Just say okay. Okay. Okay.
