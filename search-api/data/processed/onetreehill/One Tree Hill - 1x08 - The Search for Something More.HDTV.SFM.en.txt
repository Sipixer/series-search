Oh, please tell me I didn’t make a fool of myself with Lucas. Nope, that would be me. Wait. You two were totally hot for each other. Were. Until about halfway through ripping each other’s clothes off I bailed. - Because? - Because he got all serious. He was talking about this intense commitment or I don’t know. I don’t want to live in a world where two fine and willing girls like ourselves can have such a lame Friday night. I gotta change my karma. Maybe you should make some changes too. I didn’t wake up with a foggy memory. Well, you didn’t wake up with Lucas, either. Luke, did you ever hear of a UHF or their SARA? Yeah, UHF. They’re from Portland, right? They’re good. Um, but with SARA, they’re great. Cool You okay? Yeah, I can handle it. I called your house. Your mom said you're here. Crap. I should lie to her next time. Look, I didn’t know until Brooke read that note, okay? I didn’t even know there was a note until later. I wouldn’t do that to you. Okay. Great, so… cool? No, no. - Well, you believe me, right? - Yeah, I believe you’re sorry. Well then, what… Look, this whole tutoring, hanging out, whatever it is, thing. It’s just a bad idea. I’m done. I’m just done. So explain to me how this fixes your karma again. It doesn’t but it’s a total pick me up, don’t you think? Now, try this on. Now the karma thing comes next. I figured out a master plan. If I can fix the damage I’ve done to certain people’s love lives, maybe the universe will kick in and fix mine. Pretty long list. Yeah, and Nathan and Haley are at the top of it. I screwed them over royally last night. Double karma points if I can undo that one. Fabulous! You know not everybody can pull off the sceezy in the jungle vibe. Now I can fix you up to. No thanks. I am done with the drama of dating. I just wanna have fun. Then you’ll be happy to know that I got us invited to a party at Duke tonight. So much for you changing your ways. What? You promised to have fun, and I promised to indulge in boys, not booze. And now we have something to wear. My omelet was perfect, Karen. Oh, thanks. And it’s on the house. It gives me an opportunity to repay you for your hospitality last night. Oh, not necessary, I had fun. Gotta love the mail service. Is everything okay? I just um, I had applied to this amazing cooking circle in Florence and they just had a last minute opening. Oh, well congratulations. I’ve not even been waitlisted before. Wait a minute. Six weeks in Italy? - Aren’t you excited? - Starts next week. It’s not like I can go. - Then, why did you apply? - As a lark. It’s just not a good time with Lucas and the café. It’s the opportunity of a lifetime. Yeah, well, I guess it will have to wait until some other lifetime. What do you want, Brooke? To apologize. For what I did to you. You and Haley. You’re apologizing? Yeah, I know. Kinda weird, right? But I’m trying to appease the gods so… I’m sorry. Whatever. *** for drunken high school girls sick, so… Okay, I totally had that coming. I want you to know I’m going to fix it. Get you and Haley back on track. Not gonna happen. She made that pretty clear this morning. Leave it to me. What do you want to do on your date? What date? Never mind. No time to waste. I’ll call you later with details. What’s with the boxes? Oh, bookshelves. And they were supposed to come assembled. You gonna put them together all by yourself? Actually, I was going to offer you dinner to help me. Sold. Perfect. I’ll be closing the café around seven. So it’s a date? It’s a date. We’re closed. Oh, I get it. Closed to me. I don’t blame you. I’d be a bitch to me to after last night. Knock yourself out. You’re feisty. I see what Nathan likes about you. Look, you’re blaming Nathan for something that I did and that’s not fair. Okay, I was drunk and I was pissed and I found your note and you know the rest… I want to make it up to you. By going away? By hooking you and Nathan up tonight. What’s  your idea of a perfect date? Watching you get hit by a bus. And that sense of humor… Nathan’s really lucky. He’ll be here at 7. Have fun. Bonjourno. I am Marcello Vivari of the Genoculudidian Institute in Florence. - I call for Seniorina Karen Roe. - When’s that ‘do not call list’ kick in? Excuse me, but we haven’t heard from you. We sent a letter inviting you to start next week and, we haven’t heard a word so would you be call enough to call me back. Isn’t  that that school you’ve been talking about forever? Yeah… Mom, that’s great! It’s no big deal. I’m not gonna go. It is a big deal, Mom. Come on, it’s a huge deal. Well maybe I’ll just go some other time. No, Mom. Now’s the time. Come on, you’ve put your whole life on hold for me. Every choice you’ve made has been about me. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. I’m your mother. And I want you to have this. It’s time for you to do something for yourself. I’ll think about it. Don’t think about it, Mom. Do it. We’re young, we’re fun. Lets do some damage. Want some while it lasts? No thanks. Designated driver. Too desperate… Too geeky… Hello, Abercrombie. Wow, Fugazi, Sparta… on vinyl. Do you mind? Milo Goes To College. This is a great album. You know The Descendants? Yeah. I’m Peyton. I’m Gabe… You wanna hear it? That’s too easy man, you gotta play some defense. The prodigal son returns. - Hey, Mouth, how you doing, baby? - Hey sir remembers my name… heh. - Have we met? - How’s it going, Junk? Ferguson Thompson. Okay, guys, come on, it has not been that long. It feels like forever, dawg. I mean, do you still play street ball? Better than you. Aw, baby, he’s been back two seconds and he’s already talkin’ right. - Ooh… lets see what you get. - Fine. Shoot for teams. You know what, why don’t you and Fergie just take it, cuz, you gonna need it. - Oh really? Like that. - Just like that. Lock him up, man. - So what are you drinking? - I’m not tonight. Yeah? Me neither. Killer exam on Monday. Really? On what? Psychology. Human sexuality, actually. What a coincidence. I specialize in sexuality. Maybe we can be studypartners. So there’s no way you have this one. Please. I’ve got it on colored vinyl. Okay. I was wrong about you. I guess the, uh, clothes through me off. I’m into the music, not the uniform. Same as me. Yeah? Well maybe some of us can love the song without painting our fingernails black. Let me get you a drink. I’m not really drinking tonight. So that’s why we haven’t met before. You’re still in high school. Yeah. I’m a regular cheerleader. Right, right… you’re a straight edge? Not really. How about it? One drink. We haven’t even gotten to my bootleg collection. Why not? Okay. Done. Catch. I’m gonna head- Out. What are you doing here? Didn’t Brooke tell you I was going to come? I try to block out everything that Brooke says so whatever you guys are up to - I’m just not in the mood. - I’m not up to anything. Look, I apologized and I told you the truth. The rest is Brooke. She set up this whole serial date thing. One card leads to the next. Well, what does the first one say? Convince Haley to go. How am I doing so far? I don’t know. It depends on what the second card says. Go to 1423 River Street and find your next envelope. On the way, tell three things you like about each other. - I don’t know… - Look, I’ll go first. You’re the most patient person I know. You don’t go postal on me during tutoring and you don’t treat me like some kind of a moron. I really appreciate that. Look, I know I have no right to ask, but we never do anything just fun together. And plus, this is Brooke. I mean, you can bet it’s not gonna be boring. I’m free to bail whenever? A bsolutely. Trust me. Okay, what the hell. Brooke, lets go to your room. Um, you know what, yours is better. Sick roommate. You live in this dorm? Across campus. Way across. I got my car. Okay. Great. Lets start there. It’s you. Hello? I can’t hear… Right now? But you said that I could stay until midnight… This sucks. I’m sorry, was that you mom? What, are you in high school? Yeah… but these parties are a great place to meet college girls. Can I get your number? What kind of loser pretends he’s in college? I’ll take that for a no. Real funny. Hey. Are you okay? I don’t know. What’s this? Why? You like it? Did you slip me something. Oh god I… Lie down. Good idea. Leave me alone. Get off me… Get off me… Peyton! Are you looking for someone? Yeah. No, my friend’s in here. Get it open. - Hey! - Get out! Get off of her. Peyton! Oh my god, this perv attacked my friend. She’s lying. Her friend’s just wasted. Peyton, come on. She shouldn’t drink so much. What’s on your mind, Keith? What? Is it that obvious? Well, you just seem a little preoccupied. Yeah, well, last night after Dan’s party I realized something and I’m tired of settling. How so? Well, I developed a bad habit somehow just, uh, letting things happen to me instead of going after what I really want. Yeah, I know what you’re saying. Sometimes I feel like I’m too old to take risks. Well, yeah, but we’re not. Hell, why can’t we still be as fearless as we were when we were kids? Because we have mortgages and businesses and more responsibility than we ever dreamed of back then. Well, yeah, but don’t you think we should still take a chance every now and then. Find something you want and… go for it. Like what? Oh, that’s the bread. Hold that thought. And Scott is back with a vengeance, showing the locals how it’s done. That was nice, Lucas. Man, you got a cell phone too, dawg? Dang, you sure have changed, man. Hello? Lucas, Peyton’s in trouble. Somebody drugged her drink and I can’t wake her up. Okay, Brooke. Slow down. - Where are you? - We’re on the steps of Chapman Hall. Alright, call the campus police. I can’t. She’s been drinking! Okay, I’ll be right there. Gotta go, guys. Yo, Luke! - Nathan joining us? - No, he had a date with Haley. His tutor? Must be a mercy thing. Okay… you did not just say that. Come on, she’s from Westover. Her father works for the power company. So, what are you saying? That she’s somehow… beneath him? Don’t be so dramatic. I’m just saying Nathan could do better. Hmm, funny, that’s what my parents said about you. And I proved them wrong. Well that may be. You should give Haley a chance to do the same. And number three? Your loyalty. To Lucas. I know I’m not always wild about how it plays out, but it’s cool. Okay, three things I like about you. My good looks. I like the way you let me in, past all the bluster you give everybody else. And I like your smile when you solve a problem. And… you’re not horrible to look at. This is where we’re going? Nice work, Brooke. Is your friend okay? I don’t know; she can’t stay awake. Do you know where you are? Do you know your name? Just… dizzy. Brooke! Sorry, I didn’t know who else to call. Is she okay? She’s  not drunk. I think he gave her a sedative. We just need to know what it was. I’m a med student. Okay, Brooke. I need you to show me what room she was in. Okay. - Can you stay with her? - Sure. Alright, come on. It’s this one. - Hey, open the door. - Piss off. Piss off. Is this your dorm? Go get your R.A. - Hey man! - It’s him. What did you put in her drink? I didn’t put anything in her drink. You can tell me, or you can tell the police. It was nothing, man. Alright? It was one roofie. Where are they? I said where are they! They’re over there. In the box. Oh. You better hope to God she’s alright. This would go a lot faster if you helped. I’m gonna kill Brooke. Okay, here it is. Congratulations. Now, buy each other a gift and exchange them on the way to… - there’s another address here. - This is so wrong. - You want to do it? - I didn’t say that… Lets shop. - Did you see what that saleswoman was wearing? - Or not wearing. Here. You go first. Alright. - Socks. - I was playing it safe. What did you get me? Open it and see. Oh my gosh. This is really nice. Thanks. Okay. If we go to this next place and we hate it, then we can just get some pizza, alright? Okay. Says here she’ll be disoriented, may have some short term memory loss, which is maybe not a bad thing. How long ‘til it wears off? Overnight, probably. Think she’ll be okay? I don’t know, Brooke. I feel terrible. It’s all my fault. Yeah, well, what’s done is done. The med student says she’s gonna be okay, right? So we just need to watch her until she wakes up. I can do it. You’ve done way too much already. I don’t mind hanging out. Besides, I’d worry about her too much if I took off anyway. Okay. Look. It's not your fault, okay? And hey, you did get her out of there. Here you go, Miss… - Sir. - Thanks… To be honest, I’m a little afraid. Order your favorite dish for the other person. Any chance your favorite dish it… prime rib? Yeah, we have a lot of that at my house. I’m not very experienced with this so, uh… Ordering food? No. I mean, with Peyton, it was all just parties and games and drama. I never really did anything like this. This is different. Different… good? Different weird? - No, good. - Okay. I’m really glad you decided to come. So the other night, after the SPL banquet, you said something. - Yeah, I know. - You said that you… you weren’t the person you want to be. I feel the same. Yeah, well, maybe it’s time we change that. I want to. I’m a little scared. You don’t need to be. I promise. Good. Because there’s something I want to talk to you about. Me too. You first. I got accepted to this cooking program in Italy. It’s been a dream of mine since I was a teenager. Well, that’s... that’s great. When would you leave? Oh. Right away, actually. I’d have to leave the day after tomorrow. - Well, for how long? - Six weeks. But I mean, do I have a right to go traipsing half way across the world when I have a son and a business to worry about? Well, you’ve got good instincts, so what does your gut say? - That I should go. - Then you should trust that. I mean, you know, you spent your whole life putting Lucas first and he’s a good kid, but now you need to go after a dream of your own. - That’s what Lucas said. - Well he’s right. Here’s to your great adventure. Still sleeping? Here, I made some coffee if you want... I don't know how you do it. It's easy. The directions are on the bag. You know what I mean. You'd give up everything to help her after what happened at Nathan's house. She told you about that? A little... Look, the thing about Peyton; it's really hard for her to let her guard down but once she does, she's got this amazing heart, you know. Sounds like something the two of you have in common... Who knew. So you don't have any brothers, do you? You mean... besides Nathan. Yeah... How’d that work anyway? - I mean, are you… - I’m three months older. My mom got pregnant right after her senior year. Dan moved on to Nathan’s mom the first semester of college. That must have been really hard for your mom. So you two are pretty close. Yeah. We do a lot of stuff together. We talk... She's really great. Sounds nice. My parents would rather throw cash at me and send me on my way then spend any time with me. Listen, you can grab some sleep if you want. I'll watch her for a while. Okay. I'd rather stay and talk to you if you don't mind. I don't mind... I thought you’d be into lobster. Dude, macaroni and cheese is food of the gods. Yeah, if the gods are five year olds. Ready for this next envelope? Yes. Reveal a secret that nobody else knows about you. Okay. When I was in second grade, I stole some candy. Come on, that’s not a secret. Tell me for something to real. I cheated on a Geometry test last year. Haley James cheated? Yeah. My dad was out of town and um, my mom was sick and I had to take care of her so I didn’t really have time to study. Did you get caught? No. That wasn't the point. I mean, I knew what I had done and that didn’t sit right for me. So you started tutoring? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I thought it would be like, penance, or something. But it turns out I really liked it. I thought it was just to get to me. So, what about you? - What’s your… secret? - What’s up, Nathan? - Hey. - What’s up, guys? What’s this? Well, you know Haley’s my tutor, right? Looks more like a date to me. No, dude, it’s definitely not a date. Okay. If that’s your story. Hey, I’m sorry about that. Are you really that embarrassed to be seen with me? No. He just, he was gonna- Why are you only nice to me when we’re alone? You know, for a few hours there I was actually starting to think that you weren’t a son of a bitch and you just, God, fooled me again. No! Haley, wait. Hey. How are you feeling? Like hell. What are you doing here? You don’t remember last night, huh? I remember Brooke took me to a party. A guy slipped you something in your drink. Brooke called me to help out. No, nothing happened! Brooke stopped him. Alright, I’m gonna go wake her up, okay? Wait! Thanks. Again. I just wanted to make sure you were okay, alright? Lucas… I’m sorry. For what? All sorts of things. You want me to follow you home? - No. I'll be okay. - Okay. So why'd you call me, anyway? I'm not Nathan or one of the guys... Because I knew you'd come through. You're a good friend to her, Brooke. You sound surprised. Sorry, I just... I guess I just figured that you were... - A brainless slut. - No. You're not. What I was gonna say was that I just… I didn't think that you were... that tough. But I was clearly wrong about you. It's okay. Most people are. Hey Brooke... call me. If you need anything, okay? Count on that. Please tell me that you were somewhere in the land of no phones. I know. I should’ve called. Coming home would’ve been another option. You’re right. I’m sorry. You looked me in the eye and said ‘Go to Italy. I can take care of myself.’ Look, I can, Mom! A guy drugged Peyton’s drink at a party. Brooke called me for help. I took her home, waited until she felt better. Truth. As excuses go, that’s pretty solid. - Is she okay? - Yeah, she’ll be fine. Drugs, parties, and I’m supposed to leave the country. Hey, don’t not go to Italy because of this. Okay, Mom, please? We’ll see. But if I do decide to go I’m going to have Keith come and stay here while I’m gone. Great, just as long as you go. I went on Peyton’s computer and booked you a flight on the emergency credit card, non-refundable. I want you to have something for yourself, Mom. You’ve earned it. Trying to wake up my parents? That’s their room. Wait! Haley, look, I need to apologize, okay? You should write them in bulk if you’re going to hand apologies out that often. Can we just- I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’m not like you. What does that mean? I screw up a lot, alright? And being around you, I just, I don’t want to be that guy anymore. Well who do you want to be, Nathan? I want to be someone who’s good enough to be seen with you. Well you should’ve thought of that last night. You know, I keep putting myself out there, and you keep blowing it, it’s probably a good thing because at this point there’s nothing you could say or do that’s gonna surprise me. Except that. You shouldn’t have done that, Nathan. I wanted to. Yeah. Have I lost my dining privileges? Why would you? Oh, because yesterday I popped off about how you should drop everything and go to Italy. I can be a tad bit pushy. Actually, I was all set to go. But then this morning I was going over the numbers and there really is no way I can afford to shut down for six weeks. Well then don’t. - Hire me. I can take over. - Right… Well why not? I’ve got the time and the management experience, and if that’s all that’s keeping you from going. Deb, be serious. I have two things in my life. - Lucas and this café. - I know that. And because of that you know I take it seriously. You can walk me through the big stuff today and Haley can help me with the rest. I can’t. I can’t. Karen. I’d like to believe we’re friends. And, I know that’s happened quickly, but it has, and it means a lot to me, so I’m going to say this and then deny it if it ever gets out. There are things in my life I would change if I could, and running from opportunity is one of them. Go to Italy. Let me help you go. Your life is now. Okay… Okay. Are you going to play D? What? She aint coming to watch me play, dawg. Mmm-mmm. Hey. What’s your name again? Mouth. Really? That was my nickname in summer camp. Because I slept with my mouth open. Right. Of course… You know, you’re kind of cute. Do you have a girlfriend? I’ve got a real knack for hooking people up. Mmm. What smells so good? I got takeout from Karen. What’s all this? I’m going back to work for a while. Oh. Deb, that’s great. The foundation must be thrilled. Uh, no, not with the foundation. Um, I’m going to run the café for Karen while she’s away at cooking school in Italy. Keith is moving in with Lucas while she’s away and I told Karen... Oh, um, what are you doing? I’m looking for the hidden cameras. Because you can not be serious. Uh, I am, serious. Karen has had enough taken away from her and if I can give just some tiny part of that back- And you did all this without discussing it with me first? The way you discussed all those decisions you made about Nathan with me? Payback’s an ugly emotion, Deb. I thought you were going for six weeks. So, you sure you’re okay with Deb taking over? Yeah. If it means you get to go. - Oh. I love you. - I love you, too. - You ready to go? - Yeah. Great… got a little present for you. This is all that’s left of my backpacking trip through Europe. - 10,000 lyre. - Yep. It’s only worth about 6 bucks but you can, uh, get yourself a gelato. Don’t worry. It will all be waiting for you when you get back. Around six o’clock people get out of work, they want to come by... - Six o’clock. - Yeah. That’s when it starts getting really busy. - I’ll just… - Yeah. Bye… Sorry. What up, Nathan? Haley! - Don’t forget to call when you land, okay? - Alright. You remember when you said the other night that I had good instincts and that I should trust them? Yeah. You were right. Hi. I owe you. So, been to any bad parties lately? Come on, I’ll walk you to history. Synchro : Amariss
