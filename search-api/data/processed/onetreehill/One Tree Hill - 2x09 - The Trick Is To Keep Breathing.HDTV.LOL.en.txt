Yeah, but guys like me don’t get girls like her. Felix, you took care of me? Yeah… Sometimes you gotta break the rules. Relax, it’s cool. Peyton and I did a couple of lines the other night. Aint that right Peyton? You’ve got a good sound… and watching you tonight, I could definitely see us doing something together. - So you won’t be alone tonight. - Nope. - What’re you gonna do until then? - Probably just gonna… hang out with Brooke. Where do you go when you’re lonely, I’ll follow you. This is… the first time I’ve been in a church since my mom died. I think about her every day. Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a… genetic mutation. Come on man, what are the odds of us even having this thing anyway? Fifty-fifty. I’m sorry. I don’t wanna know. - You like my sister? - You know I do. Stay the hell away from her. Good morning! Rise and shine! I slaved, all morning, over the toaster, making my famous raisin waffles so eat up. Somebody wants to go to that… crummy Formal. Crummy? How could you say that? We get to hang out with our friends and get all dressed up and slow dance. How can you not be excited? Because my parents are chaperones. Okay, well there’s that. So what? Safety in numbers; I got your back. Do we really have to go to this stupid dance? Alright, well, maybe not. I mean... once I get you in that tux, maybe I’ll decide we should stay in… - Just… don’t leave me alone with them. - Okay. I promise. So good. My turn. Think of all the taffeta that had to die to make this thing. Oh, look! Oh! Maybe I could just buy it, keep the tags on and return it the next day. I mean it’s a Formal, I’m not gonna be wearing it for that long anyway. I hope. - What do you think? - No. Really? Just as well, it’s too much anyway. You are so not my best friend anymore! And what if I told you I was buying it for you!? You are so my best friend again! So, P. Sawyer, thank you for buying me the dress and if you try and take it back, I’m gonna have to bite you. But what are you gonna wear to this thing? Oh, I got it covered. I just came on this little outing for you! Oh. Well you are gonna be the best Formal date I’ve ever had. - And not Felix? - Against the rules, but Felix… has been kinda sweet lately. I might have to start giving him the benefit of the doubt instead of just the benefit. Okay. Hey look, I gotta go to the club and pick some stuff up. But I’ll call you later. Okay. Thanks for this, Peyton. Hey, anything. I don’t hear any shoplifting alarms. New dress? My Formal date, Peyton, bought it for me. I don’t suppose you have a date to this thing? I was thinking about asking you. But, that would’ve violated rule number two. Well, you know what they say – it’s not who you take to Formal, it’s who you take home. Stay away from my sister… means stay away from me too. - Just wanna talk to you. - We got nothing to talk about. I’m taking Anna to the Formal. Look, I don’t have a sister, but I’ve got Hales and I know how protective I am of her. So I get why those pictures set you off. But the one you found… I never even saw it until you showed it to me. But you had the other half. You coulda used it to win ‘Dare Night’. Why didn’t you? Anna isn’t a game to me. I’d never do anything to hurt her. Fine… take her to Formal… but you screw up with her, I’m cutting in. It’s you and me who are gonna dance. - Hey. - He-hey. I picked up your tux. - Uh, I still think you should stay home. - Oh, and miss a chance of seeing Nathan? - Dan, the doctor said – - It’s a Formal Deb, not a marathon. Hey, what’s really bothering you? Karen… is chaperoning too. How many times do I have to say it? I’m sorry I told her about you and Keith. Honestly, I thought you would have told her yourself; you two being friends. That’s exactly why I didn’t tell her. You lied to spare her feelings, I understand that. But sometimes lies have a way of catching up with us. Hello? Hello, Lucas Scott? This is Doctor Mitchell, your father’s cardiologist. The doctor I referred your brother to notified me that you refused your HCM test. Can you tell me why? I guess I’d… rather risk a short full life than… have a long empty one. Well, with the right treatment, you won’t have to do either one. Look at your father. Yeah, he practically needs a… twenty-four hour babysitter. Well that’s not true. He’s had a clean bill of health for weeks now; passed every test with flying colours. I urge you to reconsider Lucas. Please think about it. Hey. Hey. So, I had a little brush with your friend Karen. She found out. Hey, look, it’s cool. We’ll work around her, that’s all. Here’s some bands I think that might work for your club. Like what you hear, just give me a shout. I gotta go, alright? There’s a little something in there… for you too. Andy, that’s fine. Alright, I’ll see you when you get back. - Andy down-under? - Oh, New York for a seminar. Hey, there she is. Give my trusty club promoter a sack on the house. She’s earned it. Alright. Sup girly?! Actually, this trusty club promoter needs a favour. Alright. How would you feel about playing TRIC next weekend? And I don’t mean just… one or two songs. I mean… like a whole set. - Oh, wow, I’m flattered but I can’t. - Why not?! Cos I don’t have a set. I got plenty of songs. Really! See, that’s weird cos I wouldn’t know that. I’ve never even heard him play one. Ah, but you know, let’s just skip to the track where you tell me you want me to play. How do I know you’re not gonna screw me again? Been there, done that. Are you gonna have a list of crazy demands? Yeah, but just one; Haley plays with me. Uh… do you really think I’m ready for that? Uh, no. But you will be if we rehearse tonight. Oh, I can’t tonight. Tonight’s the Formal. Hmm, just as well; I don’t really wanna play with someone who’s not… totally committed. Not with record labels in the audience. I have interest. But you just went off that prom. Alright, fine, I’ll be there. Check it out. I got tipped off – Haley is gonna get crowed queen tonight. Wow, that’s great. Does she know? No. I’ve totally been acting like I don’t even wanna go. I’ve actually got a pretty incredible night lined up for her though. Haley, queen of the Formal. Now that’s hard to believe – considering… last years Formal, we spent playing miniature golf and making fun of the whole thing. Now I’m hanging out with you losers. Hey. I feel stupid; going without a date. Events like these are loaded with emotionally vulnerable girls. Ripe for the picking. Some other sucker buys the flowers… and you pluck the petals. I think petal-plucking is more your style. What’s that supposed to mean? It means… I want something more with a girl. Yeah, well maybe I do too Mouth. Or not! Hey! Oh, is this your dress? Yeah. It was my mom’s. She wore it to her Formal. Ah, so your mom was wearing vintage in the eighties. No. I know she would have loved to have seen you in it. Thanks. Well at least some part of her will be with me tonight. It’s gonna be a great night. Just the two of us. Hey! Or not. Its Anna’s first Formal so… I thought maybe we could all get ready together. - Cool. - Besides, Felix is at home, hogging the mirror. Um… I could use some help with my hair. What do you think Lucas prefers? Straight… or curly? Half and half? Dancing where the stars go blue, Dancing – - Nathan! - Hales, come on, it sounded amazing! That is a work in progress and you have a habit of sending out things before they’re finished! Well, you see how well that turned out. And when… when did you find the time to record this? Oh just… when you were in Charlotte; over the weekend. Oh… shoot. Um… Okay, so something’s come up. Peyton wants me to play the next TRIC night… with… with Chris. Haley… come on, you don’t need that guy. He’s got connections and they’re gonna see me play and… it’s just really important that I rehearse with him. Starting tonight. - Hales! - Well, come on, I’m just gonna be a little bit late. We won’t miss anything. I promise. Okay? Promise. So… whaddaya think? Do I like it? You love it! And… it’s gonna be in here, you know, just in case you need a post-Lucas touch-up. Stop it! By the way, your room is… incredible. Ah, thank you. So… who’s that? Oh, that’s… that’s Jake and Jenny. Or at least it was. They… had to move away. Do you… keep in touch? No, not really. I mean, I’ve rung him a couple of times but he hasn’t responded so… I guess he has his reasons. Okay. If you were a guy, would this dress do it for you? - You look awesome. - Yeah! Spin! ‘Dreams… Do Come True’. Well… One per ticket. Then I’ll be careful what I wish for. - Mouth, you coming? - Ah, in a sec. Felix told me to wait five minutes before going in so we don’t look like a couple. Come on. Thank you. Okay, let’s get a table and do a laugh. Oh, Anna’s saving us seats at her table. That’ll be cosy. Do you forget who she’s here with? Do you wanna sit with him? We’re gonna have to if we’re hanging out with Anna! Keep this up P. S. and I might just get jealous. Get? Wow, look at you Mouth. Looking like James Bond Thanks! But I feel more like I’m about to pull a rabbit out of something. Well, first dance of the night goes to… Double-o-seven. Thank you. I’m really glad we did this. Me too. I mean I like Anna enough and all… but I feel like I just got my friend back and now somebody’s horning in on her and I don’t feel like I should have to share her! - Know what I mean? - I know exactly what you mean. That’s why I love you Mouth; you totally get me. You’re not like the rest of the guys here. Thanks. But, sometimes I wish I was like all the other guys. - They have dates. - Are you kidding?! Girls totally fall for the sensitive guy. Look at Felix; none of his lame lines did anything for me, but what did… was when I got wasted at TRIC and he took me home and took care of me. You don’t approve of me with Brooke, do you? ‘Friends with Benefits’ is crap and you know it. Wow. Hard to believe you don’t have a date. I’m here with Brooke. Yeah… but at the end of the night… I’ll be with Brooke. Who will you be with? Where do you go when you’re lonely, Where do you go when the stars go blue. What?! Nothing, it’s fine. Okay, are you sure? Yeah. The only problem is… you know… labels don’t spend millions of dollars promoting fine. Radio stations don’t put fine into their rotation. So record execs aren’t gonna come see fine, Haley. I thought you said you had interest. I do, and if I had a great demo I can get them to come to TRIC… but right now the demo’s not great Haley. It’s just… fine. Well… I don’t know, maybe we can just pick it up tomorrow. I’ve gotta go! Oh, sure… well that’s fine. Oh hey sweetie, I’m sorry. This is taking a lot longer than I expected. Well how much longer? Why don’t you go ahead and I will meet you there not a second later than eight-thirty. Haley?! I’m sorry. What’s the big deal, I mean, so we miss a few minutes, you didn’t wanna go anyway, right? Okay. Alright, I’ll see you there. Okay, love you. Sorry, uh… you go ahead and take off. I’m not gonna need you after all. Bout time you showed up! Where’s the whip and chain? Ball and chain Tim. She’ll be here. Whatever. So how long we gotta hang here until operation ‘Reets the Beach’. Until you finish operation ‘What the Hell Are You Talking About?’. The party man. Your parents beach house? You gotta get the key first. Remember the plan? You know it! Uh-oh Phoenix and Psycho… on your twenty. Tim… just say my parents are here. Nathan. Hi Tim. You two look very handsome. Thanks mom. Dad. Nice corsage. Where’s the girl to go with it? Haley’s… recording some music right now. She’ll be here soon. Well I’m… I’m sure she’s making an effort. Which means that my first dance is with you. I’d be delighted. Don’t ask me to dance, Tim. Mouth?! What the hell? That’s what I wanna know. You told Brooke you were the one that got her home the night of the TRIC opening. So? You took first shift, I was the closer. What difference does it make? Why would you do that? The same reason I gave you the money for the dollhouse. So, what? You’re saying you’re really into her? It’s like you said Mouth; I want more too. With Brooke. You know, I always thought I’d have the first dance at your wedding. Sorry. I’m not here to give you grief, I just… I wanna make sure you’re happy. When’s the last time you were happy mom? When we were a family. And taking shots at me won’t make Haley get here any faster. I don’t get it Nathan, I try to show some concern… and all I get is attitude. And Haley abandons you at your Formal and she gets a pass? Yes! What? Whatever. Uh… thanks for the dance, mom. - The song is not over Nathan. - Yeah but… the dance is. Glow when the stars go blue. That was good! That sounded better. Better than good? Well, better than crap. Oh, that’s nice, that’s what I think I’ll name my first album; ‘Better than Crap’. Nah, it sounded good. Is that clock right? Uh, no, I unplugged it. You what?! You were that close to nailing it. - What time is it?! - Nine and change. Oh my god! I can not believe you did that. Nathan is gonna kill me! No, just play him the track. He’ll understand. No, trust me, he won’t. Having fun yet? Depends. Will I see you later? Depends. Maybe I’ll have a couple of drinks and let you rescue me again. Hey, have you seen Peyton? Yeah, she’s looking pretty fine. No, I need to borrow her lipstick. Which one’s her purse? Oh, it’s the fake findy baguette… I mean, I guess. Hey Nate, you mind standing watch? Watch what, you mean the lightweight or the flask. I just thought like… with Haley. D’ya see her here? I’ll have what he’s having. Say a… death wish isn’t it? I can pretend to know what you’re talking about, or you can just tell me. My cardiologist told me you backed out of your HCM test. Better than lying about the results. And what does that mean? Your doc told me you aced the test. Guess you were… planning on keeping that to yourself. Alright, I deserved that. But I lied because I’m trying to get my wife back and I can’t do that if I’m not in her life. Sounds like a good way to rationalise… but even though you can blow the lines, it’s still a lie - and you don’t lie to the people you love. - Is that right? Well then tell me something – does you mom know? That you backed out of your heart test? Or is that part kind of blurry? Can I talk to you? Yeah, what’s up? Hey, no secrets… unless they’re juicy. I guess I’m not used to seeing my little sis… in anything other than a Catholic school uniform. I think she looks gorgeous. Wow, I didn’t know this was a lesbian mixer. Yeah! Don’t be so gay, Peyton. Care to dance? Peyton. Oh no. Bad night? No, um… I’m okay. It’s just… Not exactly a ‘Dream Come True’? Yeah. Well it could be worse. My Formal, I went with Dan. Well there’s a smile. Now come on, get out there and have some fun. You… can’t let a stunning dress like that go to waste. Thanks, it was my mom’s. Oh Peyton. Oh! You know. I don’t know what it’s like to have a daughter… but I do know what it’s like to be a mother and… yours would be so proud of the woman you’ve become. - Oh, I didn’t mean to go make you sad. - No, no. Um… I’m gonna be fine. I know you are. I know you are. Excuse me. Brooke! I need to talk to you. Um… can it wait, just a second? Cos I’m running to the ladies. I didn’t buy your dollhouse. So what, you stole it? Why Mr Bond, you are a scoundrel. Felix bought it. He just wanted me to say I did so he wouldn’t break your stupid rules. And after the club opening I’m the one who took you home. I took care of you, not Felix, me. And I did it because I- So you both lied to me? - Brooke– - Mouth, I can not believe you, I thought we were friends! Guess I was wrong. Oh, and by the way, congratulations, you got your wish because you are just like every other guy! So I guess you’re gonna tell my mom about me not taking that test right? Don’t worry Lucas, your secrets safe with me. For now, cos I’m not gonna tell your mother, you are. I know you Lucas; you’ll do the right thing. Alright, if I could have your attention please! - Call me back as soon as you get this Hales. - Everybody, if you could gather around. - I’m starting to freak out a little bit. - The votes are in for Tree Hill High’s king and queen. As you know, over the last week, the student body was asked to cast a vote... - Nathan! I’m so sorry I’m late. I just… - Come on, come on we gotta hurry, we gotta hurry. Clock at the studio stopped and… ow! Have you been drinking? Just a little bit. This years, Tree Hill High, king and queen are… Nathan and Haley Scott! - Nathan! - Surprise! - But this- - Come on, come on. I told you, this song isn’t ready yet! I know, but you’re too critical. Everyone’s gonna love it. I told the DJ to play it if you won. This is your night Hales. I want it to be perfect. Wait, is that… is that Chris? You told me that I was in Charlotte when you recorded this. You were with Chris then and you didn’t tell me? Nathan, I was going to tell you, I swear. Yeah? You’re a little late. For the second time tonight. You know, I’m having a hard time getting my head around how you could be pissed at me. Because you deliberately did something I asked you not to! Whatever! I spent the whole night waiting for you; planning everything, dodging my parents… all while you were with Chris! - Can we leave him out of this please? - Why? Are you into him? You know what, it really hurts me that you even have to ask me that. Not as much as it hurts me. Still drinking? Not anymore. Make sure the door’s locked, okay? We don’t have to rush this. I don’t understand. - Aren’t you into me? - Oh, of course I am. I just promised myself that… I’d be in love next time. And… I’d really get to know the person first. And we’re still doing that. And I love… where it’s going… but I’m… just not ready, Anna. Not yet. I’m such an idiot. Don’t say that. Look, Anna, my parents rushed into things… look how badly I turned out. Look, I just… I wanna make sure that this is right. You know? I’m sorry. I am so embarrassed. Hey… don’t be. No, I know I’ve been sending you mixed signals. First I’m telling you to go slow and then I’m… taking my dress off. I don’t know what I’m doing. I do. We’re going for a walk on the beach. Come on. Thank you Lucas but… I think I just wanna… go home. Okay. I’ll take you. No! It’s not you, it’s just… I’m all over the place and I just need to… clear my head. I’m sorry. Hey. Oh, hey Mouth, have you seen Brooke? Yeah, she’s… ‘Benefiting’ with Felix. Oh my god. I’m sorry. I was wondering when you were gonna share the love. There is no love. We don’t do love. Do you know why? Cos it’s against the rules. But I wanna talk to you about that Brooke because- You paid for my dollhouse? Oh, and then you lied to me; about taking me home that night after TRIC. - Brooke I- - Don’t! I almost believed you were a decent guy; somebody that could care about me but you know what? I have been lied to before, Felix, and it almost killed me! Brooke! - I’m not like Lucas. - No, you’re not. You know why? Because I am not gonna let you in! You don’t get to have me; not my body and sure as hell not my heart! We’re done! Please! God. Listen, I want you to know something; I don’t have feelings for Chris, okay? The only reason I didn’t tell you about that song is because… I know you don’t like him. I don’t get you Nathan, you know, you encourage me to do this music thing and than… now that Chris is involved you just- - You don’t need that guy, Haley! - He helps me. - You don’t need to feel threatened by that. - You think I’m threatened? I know it must be hard for you; seeing me have something like this when you didn’t get into basketball camp but… it’s just not fair for you to take it out on me. I’ll tell you what Haley. Go home… and look in my top drawer. You’ll see a letter, from High Flyers. Read that… then talk to me about fair. Rough night? Yeah, you could say that. Peyton, I’m sorry for what I said to you earlier. Everybody was laughing and… I don’t know what came over me. Don’t worry about it. No, I do worry about it! We just started to be friends and… I blow it! It’s okay… Anna, we all do stupid things. I’ve… done my fair share. Peyton, at Haley’s slumber party, you said you wanted to be able to talk about anything. Well… I went into your purse, earlier, to borrow your lipstick and… It’s okay, Anna; I already flushed it down the toilet. I’ve only done it that one time. I’ve just… been fighting it. Does it have anything to do with this? Yeah, that and everything else. I know what you mean. I made a fool of myself with Lucas tonight. Why do relationships have to be so hard? Because the only thing harder is being alone. Look, you can crash here tonight if you want to. Are you sure? Yeah. It’s nice to have some company. Is this beach taken? There’s plenty to go around. Don’t worry; I’m not gonna ask you if you’re okay. Thanks. Know any good jokes? You’re looking at one. Why does everybody lie? You know, the bad guys lie to get in your bed… and the good guys… lie to get in your heart. And I’m the idiot that falls for it every time. Hey… Brooke, you are not an idiot. Not even close. You know who you are. Most people don’t, you know. I mean, that’s why they lie. They’re afraid people might find out who they are before they figure it out themselves. Let me take you home. I can get home without a guy, thanks. Okay. Wait! I really don’t wanna walk. Dan? I’m going back to the beach house. I lied to you Deb; bout the stress test. The truth is; I passed. But I lied so that I could keep you near me. After the meteor shower, I saw that you were slipping away from me… and my family was slipping away. And I know now that… nothing’s worth having that’s based on a lie. You deserve your freedom Deb and in spite of all that’s happened… I still do love you. Wait! You say you want our family to be together again; so do I, Dan. But damn you if you’re lying; because my heart can’t take much more. Neither can mine. So, do you miss being in your old town? No. The thing about moving so many times, it’s not the new places that are so bad; it’s like… not matter where you end up, it’s hard to be yourself when you get there. So, thanks for breakfast. We should do this more often. - Do what? - Be friends. We are friends. But we should be friends. I’d like that. But no benefits. Synchro : Amariss
