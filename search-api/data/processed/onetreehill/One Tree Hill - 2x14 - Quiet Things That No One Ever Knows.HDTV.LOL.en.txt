if you move in with me. I’m running for president. You realise I’ve been class president since seventh grade? Well game on, Vivica. Erica. Whatever. If you just tell me what Dan has said or done, we could fight him together. No… Mom, we can’t. Go back to sleep. I’ve got her. I’m the one who threw the brick through your car window. I’m not sure we can be friends anymore, Mouth. If you wanna go, you should go. If you do… we’re done. Turns out that popular people don’t vote and now that Felix has bailed on me, three days before the election… Yeah, who goes on a cruise in the middle of a school week anyway? Rich people. Haley? I’m sorry, Nathan. She’s gone. Octavio Paz once wrote; Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition… man is the only being who knows he is alone. You know, if Bogans keeps drilling threes, the Cats will be tough to beat. How’d you sleep? Fine. Great, grab a plate. Ah, actually… I usually grab something on the way to school. Come on, sit. We’re civilised here. Dan? I’m home. We’re in the kitchen, Deb. Oh… Lucas. Hey. Uh… where’s Nathan? Nathan’s not here, Deb. Lucas is gonna be staying with us for a while. What? You didn’t tell her. You better get to school. Nice work, Deb. That should make him feel right at home. This isn’t him home, Dan. What were you thinking? I’m gone three days and you invite Lucas to stay in our son’s room without asking me? Hey, Lucas is my son too, Deb. And before you start getting upset, there is some good news. Like what, Keith’s moved into the guest room? Haley left Nathan. When? A few days ago. Its happening, Deb. Just like we hoped it would. Well, how is he? He must be devastated. Well, ask him yourself. When he moves back in. He’s moving back in? He said that? Not yet, but trust me… it’s just a matter of time. Okay, I still can not believe Haley left Nathan for Chris. She didn’t, okay? She left for herself. The tour is an amazing opportunity. Yeah, to screw up her marriage. Okay, just because she is married does not mean she has to give up her dreams. Okay? She’s really, really talented. I know she is and that’s great but you don’t think Chris has anything to do with this? No, I don’t. She is not into him. She told me. Okay, let’s think about what Nathan was when Haley met him; good looking, rude, sexy, arrogant and talented. Okay, right, like Chris. Yeah, and then Haley changed Nathan, for the better, but I’m thinking maybe she misses that challenge. You really think she changed Nathan? Yeah. I mean, before Haley, Nathan was, like, the ‘bad-boy of Tree Hill’… and now he’s just… ‘Pod Nathan’. Dude… you look like ass. You should smell me. You know, I haven’t seen you around school lately. You mind if I come in? Actually… now’s not really a good… good time. You know, man, I… I’m really missing Haley. She aint even bothered to call me. It must be harder for you. Yeah, it’s twelve weeks. I’ll be fine. We’ll… we’ll work it out when she gets back. I’m just concerned, man. Yeah, well don’t be. So, you left early this morning. Yeah, well I had to drop off Jenny at my mom’s and then… stop by the café, talk to Karen. What’s going on? Well, um… Ted Leo is doing an in-store-run rally tonight; do you wanna go? I can’t. Come on, it’s gonna be fun. Yeah, well, fun’s not really an option these days. I mean, other than Jenny; school, finding a job, there’s not really room for anything else. Yeah. Sure. I understand, it’s cool. You coming? Campaign CD? No, I’m more of an MP3 girl. Coach Durham! I was wondering if the election week schedules were out yet. Yeah, hot of the press. Thanks. Oh, if you want, I could give Brooke Davis hers next period. We have Health together. Well, that’s nice of you, Erica. I was afraid you girls’d be pulling each others pigtails by this time. Oh, I know I’ve been a little busy with the election but how could you hold out on me like this? What? Don’t play dumb with me, blondie. You’ve been playing house with Jake Jagielski and you weren’t gonna tell me? That, that’s nothing. Oh! I would say that living in a house together, with a baby, is definitely something. Next thing I know, you’re gonna tell me you two have been sharing a bed. P. Sawyer! Hey, Freshman, hang these up for me, thanks. Okay, gimme details. Sadly, there aren’t any. Jake’s made very clear that he doesn’t have time for anything detaily. Okay, no, forget what he says because I have seen the way that that boy look at you. Okay, don’t you have Health class? I think I’m healthy enough. I have watched you mope over this guy for weeks; now you have him… in your bed. So? So take a chance. Okay, so we’re gonna pick up where we left off, discussing the process of mitosis. The... Well, Mr Scott, long time no see. Okay, so as we discussed last time, mitosis is the process by which a single cell separates- It’s about time you pulled yourself together. Whatever. I’m only here coz my Playstation broke. Hey, man, are you nuts? Prophase. Pro-metaphase, anaphase and t- Okay, please tell me you are not drinking beer in my class. Technically, it’s malt liquor. Nathan! It’s okay. I bought enough to share. Come with me please. That’s a nice skirt Miss. Ham. You know, I bet if more teachers dressed like sluts, attendance in this place would skyrocket. Funny. Principle Turner’s gonna love that one. Haley, it’s me. I don’t know if you’re even getting any of these messages but please call me. It’s Nathan. I’m worried about him. Peyton, you ready? Let’s go. Yeah, just one second. I just saw you, you look great. Come on. She feel a little warm here. You think she caught something? I don’t know. Hey, come here. How you doing, girly-girl? How you feeling? Okay, not good, I guess. Here. Here, here. You’ve got her. Oh, it’s okay. It’s okay. Here… You... You go ahead. She can’t go out like this. Stop it, I will go with you. We’ll take her to the doctor. With what? I don’t have health insurance. You know what… Here. It’s the emergency money my dad left me. - Peyton, I can’t... - Jake. Come on. What’s a bigger emergency than a sick baby? You’re pretty great, you know that? Yeah, I have my moments. Hey, Andy? Uh… you seen my mom? Lucas. I think I’ll grade these somewhere else. You need help with those? Got em. I didn’t expect to see you today. Sit down, have a drink. I just wanted to see how you were doing. What does Dan have over you? Mom- It’s gotta be something because I’ve gone over this a million times and there’s… not other explanation… as to why you would choose to live with that snake. So, unless you wanna tell me… That’s two bucks for the soda. You wanna explain this?! Looks like a wedding gown. No one asked you to pay for my dress! You know, most women woulda just sent a thank you note, but if you’re gonna yell at me, at least come inside. I want you to stay away from our wedding! Speaking of your wedding, what exactly were you planning to do about guests? I mean, considering this whole thing is just an elaborate ruse designed to bring down my brother. I’m guessing that having your parents there might be a bit of a downer. I could lend you mine but… nah. I love your brother, Dan. Why won’t you just leave us alone?! Because Keith slept with Deb. Besides, I didn’t pay you to fall in love with him. You know what? Screw it! I’ll just tell him the truth. Yeah, you could do that. Risky though. Uh… Keith’s no catch but I’m guessing even he’d have trouble dealing with this one. You like chess, Jules? Keith and I used to play all the time; until he got tired of losing. There’s a manoeuvre, it’s called the Fork. Where you take one of your pieces and attack two of your opponents’ pieces. Basically, forcing him to choose which way he wants to lose. Makes it fun coz you get to watch them squirm. Sorta like the situation you’re in now. I mean, you could tell Keith about our arrangement, break his heart… which of course, was my plan all along. What is wrong with you? Or you could go through with the wedding… put on the pretty dress… and spend the rest of your married life, knowing I have the luxury of telling him anytime I want. Either way, in the end, I win. Checkmate. Lucas? We got a call from the principle. Yeah, I was just checking on him. Uh… but since you guys are here. Stay. You’re his brother; you should be here for this. Look who it is; the Scott family. Sorry, I thought my son lived here. Kinda looks like you, only less pathetic. We heard about Haley, honey. What happened? Like you care. We do care, Nathan… all of us. Right, mom, and you just showered Haley with hugs, didn’t you? Well I hate to disappoint you guys but she’ll be back in a few weeks. Look, Nate. You can shut up. By the way. How can you live like this, Nathan? This place is a pigsty. Eh, you’re skipping school, you’re drinking in class. It’s not worth it, son. Pissing your life away over some girl. Some girl? She’s my wife, dad! Really? Well someone may wanna tell her that. Hey, come on! Nice punch, son. It’s good to see there’s still a man in there somewhere. Oh, Nathan. ‘I Slept With Brooke Davis But I’m Voting For Erica Marsh’ Come here! First of all; no, you didn’t, and second of all, where did you get it? It’s a joke. Spill! Erica! Very clever. Thanks, cleverness does come in handy in politics. Unlike, say, cheerleading which is about, what, short skirts and who can make the bitchiest pyramid? Oh, that is it. Tomorrow, you’re going down. Are you sure? Coz, from what I’ve heard, ‘going down’ is really more your style. Oh, sorry. This is the athletic department. Mommy and me classes are around the corner at the ‘Y’. Good to see you too, coach. Jagielski… for someone who’s eager to get back in school, you’ve got a funny way of showing it. Oh, sorry. Jenny’s been sick. I had to stay home with her. Sick, huh? Here, do you mind? You know anything about babies, coach? Oh, I know more than they know bout me. Right, look, I know that you’ve done a lot to get me back in here but… any mistake I make with Jenny could just make it easier for a judge to give joint custody to Nikki. Mistake, huh? You mean like dropping out of school? I know. - You’re right. - Hell yes, I’m right. Now get your... A-S-S back to class, I’ll take care of little Miss. Jagielski here. Okay. Go, get outta here. Thanks. Thanks, coach. Well, I hope you didn’t inherit your daddy’s free-throw percentage. Nathan. Hey. You heard from her? No. I would have never booked that show if I’d known that Chris was gonna be there. Not your fault. Haley’s a big girl; nobody made her get on that bus. Except for, maybe me. So, uh… you and Jagielski. What’s the deal? You two… still together? No. We’re just… I don’t really know what we are. Looks, uh… looks pretty serious to me. Not really. I don’t think there’s a possibility for me and Jake for… a lot of reasons. Yeah, trust me; you’re better off anyway. Love sucks. Nathan. No, think about it; Dan and Karen… you and Lucas… me and Haley. You got it right, Peyton. People always leave. Hey. I just had to see it for myself. See what? This, you, here. Look, Nathan, it’s complicated. You’re a fraud, Lucas. There’s nothing complicated about that. Look, why don’t you just come inside, man? Oh, so now you’re going to invite me into my own house? It’s not like that. No, it is like that, Lucas. It’s exactly like that! You realise I wouldn’t be in this situation if it wasn’t for you? If you would have stayed in your place at the Rivercourt, I would have never met Haley. You ruined my life, man. Nathan. You better watch your back. What did he want? Haley. Vote for Brooke! Get a make-over. Let’s put a whole new face on Tree Hill High, people. Here you go. Damnit, Bevin! What was that? Did Erica just convince you to vote for her? No, but… she made some good points. Bevin. She said that if you were elected president, that you wouldn’t have time for the cheerleading squad and you are… like the best captain ever. So? Brooke, the cheerleading squad needs you; so much more than America does. Bevin, you realise I’m not running for president of the United States, right? Wow, make-over… booth looks very popular. Yeah, but it doesn’t matter because Erica is so much better at the dirty politicking than I am. Oh, come on, you can get dirty. Lucas! Don’t worry. You’ll be great. How do you know? Ah, it’s just a feeling. Time to wrap up the beauty-bar Miss. Davis. The Peer Endorsement Assembly starts in ten minutes. Will do, coach. Wait! The what? Peer Endorsement. You know, where you introduce somebody who... speaks on your behalf. Oh, you didn’t forget, did you? It was in the schedule that Erica gave you! You’re gonna vote for me, right? Okay. That is so- Oh, it was, was it? It’s Andy, isn’t it? That’s right. What can I do for ya? Well, it’s a little awkward, actually. Kind of a favour, I guess you’d call it. Okay. Let Lucas go. It’s the right thing to do. And it needs to happen… now. You got some balls, kid. But this is none of your concern. Was none of my concern, until you hurt the woman I love. Oh… it’s love is it? That’s right. Well, congratulations. Now get outta my dealership. Well, just so you know, mate, I do tend to get what I want. Is that so? Yeah. It’s the strangest thing; it just seems to happen that way. It was a thrill to be asked by Erica to be her peer advocate. Because, in addition to being her principle… I also consider myself her friend. Now, of course there’s a considerable age difference... That little bitch. Double-crosses me and gets the principle to be her peer advocate. Great. ...Erica is also a great friend to Tree Hill High. From organising food drives to raising money so our folk dancing team could travel to the regional finals- Hi. I’m gonna need you to do me a… little favour. And that’s why I encourage you to vote for this marvellous young lady… who wasn’t afraid to say; hey world, get a load of me. I’m proud to endorse, your president, Erica Marsh. Thank you, principle Turner. Now… to introduce her peer advocate; here is candidate, Brooke Davis. Hi. Due to an… unforeseen circumstance, I arrived today without anyone to speak for me. But… luckily, I had a volunteer, backstage. And that person… is Erica; the backstabbing sock puppet. Hi, I’m Erica. I sure do stink. And did you know that I have to cheat to win my elections, too? Oh, really? I appreciate the attempt, hun, but you’ve got to have an actual person. I know that but I don’t, because of Erica. I’ll speak for her. Do your thing, Mouth! We just heard principle Turner read a list of Erica’s accomplishments. I could try to do that for Brooke but it would be kind of a short speech. As you know, Brooke’s probably one of the most popular people in school. Something I’m definitely not… and yet, she’s my friend. She never cared what clique I was part of, the kinds of clothes I wore or… the fact that I have to ride the bus. She looked past that stuff. And when you think about it, isn’t that what we want in our president, someone who can see past the superficial differences and bring us together? This year, Brooke’s had her share of ups and downs… just like all of us. But most of you never saw it, coz even when life got hard, Brooke never let it in. She was just… Brooke; tough, smart, one of a kind. And I don’t know about you but those are things that I look for in a leader. Brooke Davis is my friend. But that’s not why I’m voting for her. I’m voting for her because of her heart… and her spirit… and because she’s the best person for the job. You look pretty in that one. Votes are in, Erica. You can stop bagging on me now. I mean it. You look pretty. You always do. Thanks. What’re you still doing here? Just doing some work in the council office. Sometimes a job keeps you here late. Do you know why, every year, I have a faculty member speak on my behalf? Oh, I don’t know, maybe because you’re a hideous suck-up? Because I don’t have any friends that would speak up for me like Mouth did for you today. I mean, after all the great things he said, I almost voted for you. I didn’t. Please, Erica, you know a ton of people, I’m sure there’s someone. Council president is who I am. It’s all I am. Anyway… good luck tomorrow. Thanks. Looks like someone’s finally getting sleepy, huh? I guess we should try to grab some sleep while we can, huh? That’s probably a good idea. You know what, I’m gonna spend the night in my dad’s room tonight. Why tonight? Actually, from now on. What, is Jenny keeping you up? Yeah, it’s… not that. I’m just… really tired. You know what, this isn’t fair. We’ll go to my parents’ house, okay? No, don’t go. Really, it’s fine. Please stay. I… I’ll see you in the morning. Hey. What, you don’t call for… three days and then when you do it’s at... one in the morning? Oh, Luke, I’m sorry. I just finished my set. It’s crazy here, there’s so much to tell you. Yeah, wanna start with why you left without saying goodbye? Ah, yeah, I fell awful about that. Um… everything just happened so fast. How’s Nathan? He misses his wife! Lucas, don’t do this. Do what?! He needs you. He said that we were done. He didn’t want you to leave. He’s- He’s so in love with you, Hales. You gotta come back. Haley, Michelle wants to see you in her dressing room. Okay. I gotta go. I’ll, um… I’ll call you later, okay? Good morning Ravens, The ballot has been counted; the results from yesterday’s student council election are in. In the race for council treasurer, the winner is Vaughn Leiberwich. Council secretary; Tina Stone. Council vice president; Salmon Sakajahari. And finally, your new council president… Brooke Davis. Thank you! Erica. Hey. I was just… packing up. I’m sorry… about not giving you the campaign papers. I guess it worked out for you anyway, huh? I guess. Listen, I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday, how being the president is all that you have. Yeah…? Well it turns out that I have some experience in that arena. Trying to define yourself as just one thing. What d’you mean? I was always the rich girl. You know, with the nice car and the expensive shoes and the fancy house with the pool. So when my parents lost their money… figured my identity would disappear with it. You mean, you’re not rich? Eighteen bucks at Bargain Mart; my heels are practically bleeding. I’m just saying, high school is not over. You know, there’s other things to look forward to. There’s friends and guys. And… the guys. There’s a proposal in the top drawer; wireless internet for the cafeteria. I think it’d be great. Thanks. To tell you the truth, I’m totally intimidated by this job. It’s funny… you’re scared of what’s in here, I’m scared of what’s out there. You thinking about Lucas? What else? I’ve been thinking about what I can do to help you. That’s sweet, Andy. But I’ve looked at every angle… I’m gonna have to go through the courts. There’s no other way. Actually… there is another way. Hey. Hey. Sorry, the crying keeping you up? No. It’s okay. It’s okay. You know… I wasn’t entirely honest with you, before. About what? The reason I came back. You said you were tired of running. Yeah, but… that’s not the only reason. See, the whole time that I was gone, I kept thinking about all this stuff that I should have done… when I had the chance, but didn’t. Well, like what kinda stuff? I don’t know. Mostly being with you. Wow. Yeah. No. No-yeah-I mean, that too… Jenny. She stopped crying. Nathan. Ms. Roe. What’re you doing here? Looking for Lucas. Why would Lucas be here? He’s got his own court in Dan Scott’s driveway. Ms. Roe, I’m sorry my dad was such a dick to you. I haven’t really thought about it much until lately. I know that it must have really hurt you. I got over it. When Haley told me about the tour… I got mad at her. I told her that if she left with Chris, it was over. I didn’t really mean it. She left anyway. Nathan. She’s not coming back. What am I gonna do? Nathan, I know what it’s like to have the person you love walk away. Trust me. But I know Haley and she’s a good person. She’ll do the right thing. You just have to have a little faith. Bob? It’s Andy. I’ve got a job for you. ‘Call of the Wild’. You know, I’ve had that since high school? I hope it’s okay that I borrowed it. Please, it’s nice to have someone around who cares about literature. London’s great; a man’s author. Kill or be killed. It’s the way of the world. You know… if you ever need any help down at the dealership, I could come by after school sometime. Thanks, son. I’d like that. Hey, Mouth. Miss. President. I know, it does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? But, you know what? My friends just call me Brooke. Hi, this is Haley; I can’t get to the phone right now. Leave a message and I will call you back.
