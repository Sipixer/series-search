Carrie, get out of this bedroom right now. I have been through a lot with you, nathan. I have been through better and worse, in sickness and health, But i will not do infidelity.

Don't you dare turn this around on me. Jamie! Jamie jamie Oh, god, please! No, you stay away from us! This marriage is over Haley. Please, god. I want -- I want a divorce. Lucas: albert camus once wrote,</i> "Blessed are the hearts that can bend.</i> They shall never be broken." Good morning. ??? Yeah, i know. If i'd have known he'd been here a week, Then i'd clear out my mom's room. Have they even seen each other this week? Oh, no, i don't even think they've spoken. Right. The last thing i want haley worrying about Is throwing a bachelorette party When her marriage is struggling. You know, skills could do it. I mean, he was so excited about my bachelor party, He took the week off. [ Chuckles ] that worries me. Oh, yeah. Me too. You know, If a guy like me just happened to have his party in the same place A girl like you happened to have her party... Nathan and haley would have to talk. Nice. But they'll never go for it. Well, they will,if, um, th Doow about it! Oh, you're bad. You want to be bad with me? Oh, you know i do. Hey, sleepy, what's up? I saw grandpa. When? Last night...in my dream. I'm sorry, baby. We will do a double check Before you go to bed tonight, okay? Look, i made it with a smiley face. That's how you like it, right? When's daddy coming home? I'm sorry, sweetie. We talked about this. Probably not for a while. And so what were you thinking about doing for your party? 'Cause i was thinking it would be really fun to go old school, Like jello shots and '80s music. Uh, actually, if it's okay with you, I was thinking we'd do something low-Key. All right. Just the girls. Come on, man. Just the guys. And lindsey talked to haley And said she's gonna clear out of the house. Really? Yeah. All right. I'll be there. Thanks, man. I-I know you got a lot going on. I got a lot going on? Lucas, i'm living on your couch. I meant on your mind. Just the guys, right? And jamie. Joint party? Man, your parents are messing up everything. Well, i guess i got to say goodbye to the champagne hot tub. Now what am i gonna do? I went to a great party last weekend. Yeah? What'd they have? Cotton candy, Moon bounce, Wacky string... Ooh, and donkey rides. Yeah? I had a donkey on my list, too. All right, luke. Let me have it. I deserve it. Why? Lindsey didn't tell you about the library? Yeah, she told me tim rescued you, But you got to admit that story seems a little farfetched. If you girls didn't want to come watch my team play, You just say so. [ Scoffs ] okay, come on. She didn't say anything about how mean i was to her? No. Were you mean to her again? She's really great, luke. But it means a lot to hear you say that. You and owen didn't hook up in new york? Let's just say things are really good. What about you and mouth? How's that going? Let's just say things are really good. He's been so sweet. Every day he delivers a treat And just before he leaves, a kiss. It's the best part of my day. Oh, a treat every day. Two treats, if you count the kiss. Oh. Hi. Hey. I got you a pumpernickel bagel, And a surprise for you -- Mocha double latte, extra foam. I love you. And i have a bit of a surprise for u. Rachel's back. Rachel rachel? Owen and i found her in new york. She overdosed in my apartment. She's been laying loay at the house for about a week. Is she okay? She seems okay today, but i- I don't know. A visit from you would probably really do her good. Yeah. Okay. Bye, milly. I didn't get my kiss. Hey. If that's letter number 86 from the sad box of "lucas summer," You can keep it. Just open it. Does my store look like a drug front to you? It's the start-Up money you lent me for my label. I just got paid for mia's deal. By who -- A bunch of colombians? No, but cash is just more fun. It's more dramatic. Peyton, is is way more money than i lent you. It's twice as much, actually. It looks like you're a very smart investor. Well... so, what's going on? Brooke? It's amazing. Hey, lindsey. Hi. Hi. You make a very beautiful bride. Thank you, peyton. And thank you, brooke. It's perfect! It is perfect. Oh, uh, hey, so, lucas and i Decided to combine our bachelor/bachelorette parties Tonight at haley's. Wow. Have nathan and haley even talked Since nate went all jude law with the hot nanny? Didn't we warn her? Yeah. Uh, no, they're not speaking. Okay, so, how... Um, we lied. Oh, that's good. Got to start somewhere, right? Okay, wacky string -- 10 cans, jam master j. Is daddy going to be at the party? Mm-Hmm. And mommy, too? Yep. But, look, you can't tell mommy or daddy, okay? Can we play "rock band" at the party? Hmm. Good idea, kid. Man, you got this party thing down, hugh hefner. Come on. Man, who knew that old boxers Would take over the mini-Grill industry, huh? So, anything else on the wish list? Uh, you see the bar code for your next book? I got to give them something, luke. I know. I know, i know, i know. Let me give it one more pass, and then you got it, okay? Thank you. Oh, pda in the mall is so 7th grade. Owen, kiss me. They're doing it. So is peer pressure. What's going on? Oh, nothing. Just killing some time before my big meeting. O...m...g! Brooke? Lucas? [ Cheering ] r-A-V-E-N-S! Go, ravens! Hi...bevin. What's up?! Nothing. We're just... oh, i'm great, thanks. So, after i graduated four years ago, I got a job, And i got married, and i had a little boy. Oh. Isn't he cute? His name is nathan. Wow, lucas. You're marrying brooke? Huh. I always thought ghyou'd marry peyton. No, uh -- So, have you heard from rachel? That's a nice spot, huh? Yeah. How you feeling today? Honestly, i'm a little bit ashamed. You and brooke don't have to babysit me. Don't be too hard on yourself, okay? I know i can beat this. I just got so deep in it, i forgot which way was up. The light is always up. When i first came back home, i really didn't know what i wanted. And brooke believed in me, And today it felt really, really good to prove her right. She believes in you, too, you know. I know. And i'm gonna make it up to her. How's rachel doing? Really well, actually. It's been hard on her, you know, And so gross. But i think she's strong enough to stay sober. I really do. I hope so, brooke. You know, i know i was a little opinionated about how you fired rachel,but... I think i was just projecting, you know? It's really great you're trying to help her now. Well, i'm not helping her 'cause i fired her. I'm helping her 'cause she needs it. Oh. Hello, darllng. Hi. I'm confused. Of course you are. The meeting was moved forward. Not to worry -- Your input wasn't needed. But this was my meeting. It was just business talk -- Way over your head. You wouldn't have understood. So, where have you been hiding yourself all week, anyway? I've been finishing a wedding dress And handling some personal things. Well, good. You can get back to it. You're dismissed. Go play. It's what you do best. Babe, you shouldn't put up with that. I know she's your mom, But you can't be partners with somebody that treats you like that. Okay, i thought you were working on the whole "opinionated" thing. Hey, hey, hey. Where's my kiss? Okay. Careful what you ask for, i guess. How's he doing? He's okay. You know. I think he's over hating me, but i'm still the bad guy. Well, when he files for emancipation, then you can worry. How are you and lindsey doing? You guys ready for the big day? Well, not a lot of time. She wants my new pages first. I'm just not sure they're quite there. Well, if you need an extra set of eyes, I will be happy to help. You would? Yes, of course. I was your first editor. If i don't like it, don't hate me. Okay, don't hate me, But you have a date to the party tonight. One of owen's friends is in town. Supposedly he's supercute. He's coming out with us tonight. I told him you were gonna be there. Blind double date? Only half blind. Say yes because it's the peyton i know and love And because, if you show up with a date, You are gonna look classy and over it. Okay. I will go get ready. But he better be cute. I'd invite you... Yeah, but detox and parties don't mix. Yeah. But we're gonna come back early. I promise. Look, uh, i was talking to peyton today About how you helped her out with her business. And, i don't know, i'm feeling really good now And supermotivated to get back to work. And yesterday, you know, You said that maybe i could start modeling for clothes over bro's again. So, i was just wondering... Right. Rachel, i love you, But i meant maybe a job at the store. You know, like, you could learn the retail side And work your way back up. Oh. I see. Yeah. Hey. I didn't mean to get your hopes up. You're one of my best friends, And you're an incredible model. But it's that lifestyle, you know? You can't be around that. Not yet. Yeah, i know. Look, i feel like i let you down once before, And i can't do that again. Brooke, that was not your fault, all right? That was me. I am not gonna make those same mistakes again. I'm strong. You said so. Yeah. So, let's just give it time, okay? Baby steps. Sure. Okay. New basketball for your son? Actually, it's for my grandson. Wow. I never would have guessed. You keep yourself in great shapeee I had a lot of spare time on my hands. So, patty... What time do you get off? Well, that depends. What time are you gonna pick me upck Hey. Hey. You look nice. Thanks. I'm just, uh, getting ready for lucas and lindsey's party. After you go see rachel? I was thinking about it. Why? Mouth, Rachel once had me guard the women's bathroom At bungalow 8 while she did things... With a guy Or two. I know what she's about. I also know that you and rachel have history. Listen, rachel's friend who's going through a hard time, I just want to support her. I mean, i'd bring you along If i didn't think it was insensitive to her condition. Rachel's never been sensitive to anyone's condition but her own. Well, you don't know her like i do. I know. That's what i'm afraid of. Look, millicent -- It's okay, mouth. Just go. I'll see you at the party. So, look, nate, um, About this party -- ??? Haley's inside. I figured. You did? Yeah. You always meddle, luke. It's what you do. You're just lucky i miss my wife. You believe this? Ringing the bell at my own house. [ Doorbell rings ] they're here. Hi, owen. Hey. Hi... Chase? Brooke. Hi. It's chase. Like, "clean teen" chase? Uh-Huh. Oh, my god. This is getting so good. Are you sure you don't want in? Uh, i'm barely clean and hardly a teen. Team, help me. Owen never told me his friend's name. What am i supposed to do? So what? I mean, do you want to bail? No. I mean... No. It's fine. I'm with owen. I haven't talked to chase in years, but... Chase really is so cute. Are you two enjoying this? Uh, well, yeah, a little. Okay. If you hook up with chase, for the record, You're taking a cab home. Okay. Well, you're paying. Fine. Seriously, If it gets awkward, just say the word, okay? Okay. Awkward. What? Nothing. Okay, does somebody want to tell me what's going on? Hey, bud... You remember that girl i used to tell you about Back when we first moved in together? Yeah, the one you constantly talked about? Not constantly, but yeah. What, the fake virgin chick you lost your virginity to? Chick? Yeah. What about her? Do you remember her name? Come on! Haley... I'm sorry, all right? This was not my idea. Um, i can go if you want me to. No. You should stay. We need to talk anyway. Yeah. Daddy! There he is! Can we play "rock band" -- Me, you, and mommy? Yeah, sure, we can. I-I'm a little busy right now, sweetie. Sorry. We'll talk later. You should play with him. He misses you. Was that cotton candy? Nice. Man, i don't know how i never put it together. Sobriety must be going to my head. I never put it together either. You said, "brooke." I said, "brooke." Yeah, but you said, "brooke that started a fashion line." Yeah, yeah, you probably should have figured that one out. Yeah. Dude, stop smiling. You, uh, got a little something. Oh. Oh, i got it. Sorry. Just, uh, thought you were actually happy to see me. I am happy to see you. Mommy! Daddy! Let's play "rock band." Not right now, sweetie. I am happy to see you. It's just tonight's about lucas and lindsey and not us and -- Yes, jamie. What? I want to play "rock band." Well, go play, then, sweetie. Go on. [ Sighs ] i meant all of us. I know. Maybe later, okay? Come on, jimmy jam. I'll rock with you. It's okay. Maybe later. My, uh -- My college roommate Actually spent $6 on vogue for your clothes over bro's layout.</i> Your roommate, huh? Well, it's all been downhill from there. Hey, coming out of high school, We all want to rule the world, but It's tough. I basically had to sleep with my boss to keep my job. Well, you've come a long way, mouth. I'd probably still have my job if brooke had that rule. I got to say, man, I'm a little jealous of everyone's success. Why didn't you ever call me? I would have helped you. I know. That's why i didn't. Well, is there anything i can do for you now, rachel? Anything? Sure. Well, you remember that motel room at honeygrove? I could really use the release, mouth. A little natural high. Rachel, i -- Come on. You slept with your boss. How about a module? I can't. I'm sorry. I-I must look terrible. Don't. You're beautiful. And you could have whoever you want and whatever you want. But? But you don't believe that. You need to learn to let go of whatever it is That makes you think you're not good enough. 'Cause that's when you're gonna beat this -- When you learn that you matter. I should go. (Karl) (We are parting in south beach. Get your hot ass down here) Can we come in? What you got there, little man? Nothing. That's more than nothing. Those are the two people who love you the most in the world. Almost as much as i do. Is he your boyfriend? You're the only boyfriend in my life. Owen: hey. I heard i owe you one. You got me another chance with brooke. "What's under all the clothes, brooke davis?" So, you find out? On that note, boy time is over. Let's go. Give me knuckles. Hey. Look, i hope you don't feel too slighted by the setup. To be honest, i kind of expected it from you guys -- "You" being, uh... You and lindsey. Your hearts were in the right place, though. You picked the right person to spend the rest of your life with, luke. So did you. So, this is kind of weird, huh? Then again, i did find you pretty cute back in high school. Oh, god, come on. I did. But i was with brooke. And you re with lucas. You still love him? He's with lindsey now. Chase, i -- 3:00. Lucas was looking. Just trying to help you out. Hey. Did i miss all the fun? I guess not. When i was a little girl, I sprayed the boys i liked most with wacky string. But then todd pinkerton got some in his mouth, And he started to cry. Needless to say, i abandoned that tactic. I really like you, marvin. So the next time you go to visit some really hot former model Who you have some sort of sexual history with And who's in a vulnerable state... Just consider me. You're right. I can do that. So, i built it up so much. I told all these kids That my mom was gonna get me this cake with rambo on it -- Like, chest scars, flames, you know? My mom brings the cake out, And instead of a picture of rambo, It's like this dinky homemade cake. No rambo -- Ju t -Ords "rambo says 'happy birthday'" Scribbled across the top. So embarrassing. I thought it was funny, but if you have a better story... No, your mom sounds sweet. On the rare occasion that my mother Ever actually remembered my birthday, She'd just toss her gold card at me And tell me to go buy something. She never really cared to get involved. She's not exactly the nurturing type. Hey, junkie. Get up. You and peyton are like bloodsucking vermin That just won't go away. Where's my daughter? She's at a party. [ Scoffs ] of course she is. And when she's not partying with the bartender, She's running a halfway house, apparently. I'not a -- I'm better now. Yeah. Whatever. Today you're fine. Tomorrow you'll have pawned my pradas. It's different this time. Brooke believes in me. Oh, well, look out, tony robbins, Here comes my daughter. You know, i convinced her to cut you loose once. I can do it again. Brooke wouldn't do that to me. No? Look at you. You're pathetic. And the sad thing is, you're gonna lie to yourself Long enough to hurt the people who still give a damn. Why don't you think of them before you relapse And waste all their time and their money? I mean, let's be honest. You can't beat this thing. And deep down inside... You know it, too. Don't you? No! No! No! No! No! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get hi One, two, three -- Boom.. Guys, can you take it easy, please? Be careful. Come on, sweetie. It's time to go. But, mom... it's getting late. You got to go to bed soon, all right? You got to remembe rhis size. You treat him like one of the guys, but he's just a little boy. Look, haley, i don't want to disres, 'Cause i know you and nathan going through some things right now. But i never lost sight on how little that boy is. Actually, i'm amazed how little he is Because his heart is so big. You knowyo today all he wanted to do Was make sure y'all was a whole family again. That's what today meant to him. And if you hadn't noticed, I just think y'all are the ones that done lost sight of things. I can't believe we're getting married. Yep. And after the wedding, you'll be another scott in tree hill. You think you can handle that? Uh, who said i was taking your last name? So, how's our little plan working out? Uh, they're talking. That's a start, right? Look, i just wanted to say i'm sorry. Aren't you tired of that? You shouldn't have to apologize for who you are. Not anymore. I've been thinking a lot this week. And i knew who you were when i married you, And what i've realized is that it's really not fair. What are you saying? I'm saying that it was wrong of me... To try and change you. I'm the one who's sorry. I shouldn't have tried to change you or us. And now... Now... I'm done trying. Skills: hey. Thanks for all your help with the party, man. Sure. The moon bounce was the bomb, And the cotton candy was off the chain. And them was all your ideas. Yep. Word. You know i'm gonna always be there for you, right? Word. Want to hold chester? You know you my dog, right? But that's where i draw the line. I ain't never have a pet. This pet don't scare you. He doesn't bite. That ain't funny. Find your coat? Or were you just stealing wallets? Well, they call it winona syndrome when you have everything And you resort to petty theft for the cheap thrill. Come on. Your career sounds pretty thrilling. It is. What about you? You a thrill-Seeking pilot boy yet? I'm a thrill-Seeking carpet salesman paying for flying lessons. How's the big date going? You and owen, huh? He's a good guy. He is. Let me get that. So, what's the deal? You seen luke? Yeah, the moon bounce is rockin'. A'ight. [ Laughs ] Suppose keith and my dad Were sitting next to each other at a bar in heaven. What do you think they'd talk about? Well, after they had a beer... I think keith would take a long, hard look at your dad And he'd say... "Where's the bathroom?@U No, seriously, i think your dad and keith Would have been best friends. And keith would tell him what a great job he did raising his daughter. Because he did. My father loved you. So do i. I thought you abandoned that tactic. I figured i'd take the risk. Good night, mouth. Millicent, aren't you forgetting something? That's the best part of my day, And i missed it. Mine too. Come on. "Colors are"... Okay, buddy. Thank you. I had a good time tonight. Thanks for having fun with me. Um, what was that for? Brooke was looking. [ Laughs ] you're welcome. Good luck. Thanks. Are you gonna be here in the morning, daddy? [ Sighs ] i'm afraid not. Why? Mommy won't let you stay? No, it's not mommy. Your mom is the best mom in the world, okay? Don't ever forget that. It's just... Daddy's on a time-Out right now. Are you ever coming home, daddy? I hope so. I hope so, too. Rachel, we're home! She's gone. You tried, brooke. I guess she just wasn't ready. So, we didn't get to talk much tonight. What's your story? I just got out of jail for killing my brother. Right. So, did you do it? Yeah. I saw the light on. I wanted to make sure that Rachel wasn't cleaning us out. What is that supposed to mean? Have you been to my house? Did you say something to her? Nothing the mirror couldn't have told her. Leave my friends alone, okay? I was trying to protect you from making another mistake. Firing rachel was a mistake. That was business. That is not the way i want my business to be. People deserve better. She -- You see? This is exactly why you weren't included in the meeting today. You're too emotional. You need to remove emotion from business. That's why i'm here. Now. You're here now. What about all of those years i was growing up? You never wanted to be a part of my life Until i started this company. What? Cheerleading, School president... Stop being childish. You're the face of a company, And you took your company as far as you could on your own. Then you came to me when you needed help. Well, rachel needed my help. And you made me fire her. You earned my help, brooke. Rachel didn't earn yours. I earned it? A daughter is not supposed to have to earn Her mother's help... Or her love. It is supposed to be unconditional. Whatever. You'reired. What did you just say? I said... You...are fired. You're going to fire me And risk our entire company? But it's not our company. It's my company. Remember? I am not an employee. I am your mother. I know. You're fired. You can go now. Albert camus once wrote, "Blessed are the hearts that can bend.</i> They shall never be broken." But i wonder... If there's no breaking, then there's no healing.</i> And if there's no healing, Then there's no learning. And if there's no learning... Then there's no struggle. But the struggle is a part of life,</i> Hey. Hi. I need to talk to you. Sure. Is everything okay?
