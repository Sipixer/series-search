'cause he gave the bartender an excuse to talk to the gorgeous singer. "... in between when you're lookin' at me" "i know" "i know" "i know" you know, in that case, maybe you should give him two. the second one's from me. julian, give us a moment. your mother made me promise one thing before she died ... that i would always look after you. i know. i saw you making eyes at lucas tonight. i was doing nothing of the sort. i know what i saw. don't make a liar out of me. go to bed. i believe you, peyton. i know you only have eyes for me. sweet dreams. oh, i think i had a few too many tonight. oh, you have a few too many every night, mouth ... keeping me in business. now, are you gonna be okay to get home? yeah, i'm fine. all right. i'm going places, luke. i know. which way am i going? thanks, pal. i used to be great, luke. i was the best reporter in tree hill city. but i'm working on something big. i'm telling you ... no more gossip columns for me. it's big, luke. they'll see. they'll all see me again. does anybody see me here? have a good night. last chance. good night, brooke. and, brooke, those were nice days we had.</i> sure they were. sorry i had to break your heart. are you sure you can still handle your whiskey, luke? yeah, i'm fine. why? 'cause you just let brooke davis walk out of here without paying her tab. i've been working with you 10 years, and i've never seen you tear up a bar tab before. she's just down on her luck. mark my word, skills ... someday, brooke davis is gonna change the world. taxi! on second thought, i'll walk. thanks. sir? have a good night. nice night for a walk. i told you i don't have your money yet. oh, that's a damn shame, 'cause, you see, i'm a businessman, so when i make an investment, i expect to see a return on that investment. i spent it on the start-up costs for my garment line. it's just been a slow start. if you could just give me more time. you want more time. okay. i'm a fair-minded person. company needs a chance to get started, get some advertising, word of mouth, build up a clientele. that's right. okay, i understand. i'll give you until... tomorrow night ... midnight. or else. you want me to rough her up? no. no, we'll give her another day. meanwhile, go get me that nosy cop. my calluses could use a workout. tree hill city, born and raised. what brought you here? well, i know it sounds a bit corny, but, the rain. i know nobody likes the rain, but i was traveling from theater to theater, performing. and while the money was great... well, i really missed having a place i could call home, so i moved here d fell for the rhythm of the rain. unfortunately, i also got stuck at dan's place for a while. but then lucas found me, brought me here, and it was a perfect fit. great club, rainy city. home. i think i'll stay a while, if lucas will have me. well, i know karen would approve. we all kind of miss her around here. after she lost keith, she left the club to lucas, and... ... she would be proud to have a woman of your heart and talent working here at the café. well, i sure can class up a joint, now, can't i? yes, you sure can. i was ... i was wondering if maybe you might want to step out with me sometime. well, why don't you stop wondering and ask me sometime? nathan? excuse me. before you get in too deep. everything all right? how would you like to step out with me tonight? sorry, but we're closed. i know. my car broke down. right. so you can lure me outside, and dan and five of his goons will work me over? no, thanks. dan's not with me. i promise. let me grab my coat. well, i'll see what i can do. i'm not really the mechanic type. the advancements on these things are amazing, aren't they? how much she set you back? oh, hundreds. what do you drive? i don't. i guess i'm not ready to give up on good, old-fashioned walking. you know, no one ever stands up to dan that way. that right? and to be perfectly honest, i think the confrontation made him respect you. that's how he judges people, you know? "are they weak or are they strong?" it's just his way. it's not my way. i'm a kind man, unless you give me a reason to be otherwise. i'm sorry. i ... my uncle keith was the mechanic in the family. it's okay. leave it. you wouldn't mind a good, old-fashioned walk home, would you? sure. i can do that. where do you live? that way. let's go. i'm not sure how i feel about the war. i do mostly feel sorry for our boys having to leave home. i could fight, though. what? i could. or be a nurse. what do you think? would i be a good nurse? yeah, i guess. do you think i'm pretty? i don't think i know you well enough yet to say something like that. well, you certainly don't talk very much, do you? now, why would you want to walk me home if you didn't walk to talk? i'm not really the gabbing type. what does a girl have to do for some interesting conversation... short of throwing myself at you? okay. i have a question for you. why do you associate yourself with a guy like dan? he's scum. everybody knows what types of things he's into over there at the comet club. people disappear around him. and yet... you let him own you. never mind. oh, no, you said you wanted to talk. now, here i am, walking you home, against his wishes, i'm sure. i'd just like to know. it's a long story. i've got time. my mother and dan were in love. and when she died, he vowed he would always look after me. i'm not his girl. i have my own place. he just keeps me close to him and takes me out. you're a trinket. i'm cared for. is that whatou call it? i'm sorry. i'm not trying to be rude. i just ... i don't like the guy is all. it's not that. i need to get out. i have been locked up my entire life, and i need to breathe. i need freedom. i need love. "love..." when you asked me to step out with you tonight, i didn't imagine it would be at karen's café. why not? we've got the best piano player in town. and the best drinks. and the best bartender. haley, i have to tell you something. that letter that luke gave me earlier ... my unit's been called up for active military duty, and i have to report tomorrow night... which means that this is my last night here, but... i want you to know that i wouldn't want to spend it with anyone but you. is that the truth? because... because i want to believe that it is. yes. this is perfect to me. "... i've fallen" "it's your fault, baby" "if i'm a fool" "you must be..." i want to fall in love. my whole life has been planned and safe. dan won't let men court me. but for once, i want to make my own choices, even if that means my heart shatters into a million pieces and i have to find the strength to put it back together. so, that's why i came back tonight ... because i need something different, and you are the first thing i've laid eyes on that is. and i have said too much. i'm sorry. you are. what? earlier, you asked me if you were pretty. you are. but it's your heart that makes you more than that. it makes you beautiful. thank you. this is me. luke, no one knows about dan loving my mother ... no one else in the world. just me, him, and now you. i won't say a word. you know, there's a sign above the door in my bar. it reads, "people always leave... " "... but i say, 'stay a while, have a nightcap'." now... maybe you and i can do that sometime. leave? or have a nightcap? whatever you'd like. would it be all right if ... just shut up and do it. good night, peyton. well, this is a most romantic table ever reserved for me... and the most interesting of entrées. penny for your thoughts. i love you. i always have ...  ever since the first time i saw you. i know this might sound crazy, but i just had to tell you, because... what? i'm not afraid of dying. but i am afraid of dying without you knowing how i feel about you. you're not going to die, nathan scott. you're going to come home... to me. i just think it's ... why don't you let me do the thinking for the both of us? i've got a crazy idea. do you trust me? yes. you manage to find the money you owe me? no, but i have something much more valuable than money. hey, boss, officer morello will be here soon for his... appointment. hey, sugar. what could you possibly have that i would want? information... about peyton. what kind of information? forgive my debt, and i'll tell you. no, you tell me, and i'll consider it. besides, you owe me money. you really don't have a choice. what if i told you that your precious peyton was sweet on lucas scott and that i saw them together last night? i drove peyton home last night. besides, we've discussed this. she knows better than to get involved with him. well, i saw it with my own eyes late last night. and i don't think she heard you, unless you told her it's okay to kiss him. you're lying. get her out of here. such a shame about peyton's mother... considering how you loved her. you consider my debt paid in full. hell hath no fury. pretty ruthless. there may be hope for you yet, brooke davis. then we're square. not yet. there's one more thing you're gonna do for me. you need a lift? no, thanks. you know, you could be making a lot more money at the comet club. i'm doing just fine at karen's. okay. all right. you're loyal. i get it. no hard feelings? then again, i wouldn't call a piano player with a broken hand just fine. no! hi. didn't expect to see you here. i know. it might seem a little strange, but i would like for you to have this. when i was a little girl, my mother took me to a seaport. we met a sailor, and he took us out on the water. i felt free. and when he brought us back to the shore, i cried, because i didn't want to go home. and he told me that one day, i would be free to see the world, to do as i pleased, but until that day, to keep the dove as a reminder of that dream. the dove has always stood for peace and love. but for me, that dove has always stood for freedom. i can't accept this. it comforts me, lucas. and so do you. so i want you to have it. i should go. stay a while. no. no, i think i'll hold out till that nightcap. wouldn't want a girl to look too needy. you had to be stubborn, huh? you couldn't just look the other way and take my handouts. look at you ... sitting there, all strong and proud, not even begging for your life. wow, you really take the pleasure out of this. it kind of reminds me of keith scott. oh, well. i'll get over it. hiya. here, have another drink, boozy. you should have stuck to gossip columns instea where you don't belong. gossip columns won't get you killed, kid. boss? stop it! what is this?! get off me. what are you doing here? all this time... i didn't want to believe that you were evil, that you were a liar. but i think i knew all along, so i followed you. and what about you? how's lucas doing, whore? he killed lucas' uncle keith. i said i was onto something, and i was right. he murdered him. shut him up! is that true? go wait in the car. is that true?! go wait in the car! go wait in the car. no. no! no! "i want a dress, nice and pale" "with hat on the top" what are you thinking about? the house we're going to live in right here in tree hill city. anything else? well, since the house is going to be so big, i suppose we'll need children. a little girl, just like you. mnh-mnh, a son. we could name him james, like haley james. jamie. yeah. "i wanna get married" "wanna be mrs. s-c-o-t-t" well, well. the boozy reporter finally cracks the case. well done. i'll tell you what... i'm a charitable guy. you beg for your life, and just maybe i'll set you free. no. i'm not crawling anymore ... not even for you. and pretty soon, no one else will, either. they'll find out that you killed keith, just like i did. and then they'll bring you down. oh, i'd say if anyone's going down, it's you. hey, mouth, be a friend and get that for me, will you? that last drink's on me. boss, peyton's gone. hey, skills. play something good for me? what happened to you? julian, dan. they have mouth. they're gonna kill him. what? he found out that dan killed keith. luke, i didn't know. i'm sorry. luke, what are you doing? luke, we can be free. we can leave tonight. luke, listen to her. he knows she's here. you're gonna get hurt. he hurt me when he took keith away from me. he's hurt everybody, including you. somebody needs to stop him. lucas. were you serious when you told me you'd leave with me tonight? yes. skills, you've been a good man and a great friend, so i want you to have this place. it's yours. i'm coming, too. no. you'd just hold me up anyway. luke! these duracell batteries were given... get over here, peyton. peyton, now! she's with me. why does everything always have to be so messy? okay, okay. not even i'd shoot a man in the back, lucas.</i> actually, that's not true. i've shot several men in the back. most of them deserved it, but i wouldn't recommend you do it, 'cause i have a surprise for you. ms. davis? put it down. that's a good boy. isn't this fun? okay, ms. davis, finish your job and your debt is clear. i'm sorry, luke. brooke, we've all had hard times. you don't have to do this. yes, i do. i should have done this a long time ago. yeah, i thought so. women. you want something done right ... luke. peyton? i got you, i got you. hey, come on. no, it's gonna be okay. hold on, hold on, hold on. you're gonna be okay. hey, we're gonna leave, remember? yeah. just you and me ... we're gonna leave. come on. i love you. "don't fight, don't fight, don't fight, don't fight" "don't do it again" i'm coming back to you, haley. i am. is that a promise? as long as you wait for me, it is. oh, i'll wait for you. i'll wait forever. "don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say" "you're leaving this town" best day of my life. "you're all i have in this life" "don't..." "and hear me out" "don't fool" "just hold me now" "don't take, don't take, don't take" "don't take it so lightly" "when you say, you say, you say" "when you say you love me" "i miss, i miss, i miss, i miss" "the way we would laugh" "i wish, i wish, i wish..." you're free now, peyton. "... that we could go back" "when you say, you say, you say" "when you say you love me" peyton? hi. did i wake you up? no. well, maybe. i'm sorry. i'm still at tric. i'm gonna be home soon, though, okay? oh, no worries, no worries. i just had the craziest dream. i'll tell you about it when you get home. okay? all right, i'll see you soon. and, peyton... don't ever leave me, okay? okay. bye. whew. "don't take, don't take, don't take"
